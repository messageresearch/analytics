Gracious heavenly father, tonight we just thank you that we can gather together one more time in your name. &gt;&gt; We know that when we gather together in your name, the name above every name, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; that you're there in our midst, we welcome you here tonight, Father. Lord Jesus, tonight we just ask that, Father, according to your word, that you would just do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we could ask or think. Lord, &gt;&gt; let us cast down our own imaginations right now, Father, before your throne. We know that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our words here on earth, Father. And Lord, we pray that we would just have honest, sincere hearts, Lord, that we would desire, Lord Jesus, the sincere &gt;&gt; meat of your word. Father, that we would desire to be changed by this word, Lord. That it would not be on books and tapes, that it would not be in an association, but Lord Jesus, that it would truly be a living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living out through your bride tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to commit this service into your hands. Father, we pray that you would, Lord Jesus, meet each and every need that was made known unto you by way of an uplift hand. We know that you're more than able. Father, we pray that you would be with the Huckluck family, Lord, and the assembly at Edmonton Living Word, Lord. Father, we pray, Lord Jesus, that you would just be with the unspoken request tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and Father, we just want to thank you so much, Lord, for your traveling mercies. Thank you for bringing Brother Peter home to us once again. Father, we're so grateful for all that you do for us every day of our lives, Lord. &gt;&gt; We just thank you, Lord. And we just ask now all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you musicians. Thank you once again for your service unto the King. If you have your Bibles tonight, I'll try not to keep you standing long. I just like to read from Matthew chapter 24 and uh perhaps get into the scripture that I wanted to on Sunday &gt;&gt; but did not because I guess I just followed the leadership of the Lord and we didn't even get into the notes but I just think there's so much in here that's &gt;&gt; important in Matthew chapter 24 &gt;&gt; verse 10 it says and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. &gt;&gt; But he that shall endure unto the end, &gt;&gt; the same shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we just thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you that Lord Jesus, even though it's possible humanly for your children to be offended, you can bring the healing. &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that anyone who is offended will not remain that way. Because there's not going to be different divisions in heaven. &gt;&gt; There isn't divisions on earth. &gt;&gt; It's one body. Yes. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, tonight one one more time, we just invite you, Father, to surgically deal with each and every one of our hearts, Father, as your spirit discerns. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; We just commit this service into your hands. Break this bread of life fresh to us once again, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. Just have a few announcements uh that I need to make. And uh yeah, so we just have the youth hike coming up on Saturday, I believe, August the 9th. And uh this Saturday also there's going to be a a private funeral for brother Johnny Huckluck who passed away. We had prayed for him some time back and he was in our our midst not long ago and I know that it's uh it's an amazing thing to see that the Lord chose to take him home and he checked himself into the hospital and I think within about a day he actually passed away. So, uh, I asked about the funeral and, uh, I found out from the family they're having a private graveside service and, uh, they just have requested that, um, nobody really comes. So, pray for the Huckleak family. They've had a real hard time, a real hard time. The Lord has allowed that family to walk through uh, the valley for a few years now. they they lost one son, then they lost the dad, and now they've lost another son. So those uh those people who remain definitely can use prayer. Just wanted to announce uh brother Tim Ashong is coming August the 13th. We have brother Gif Marufu here on September the 7th. And uh please don't forget brother Andrew Glover here in September. Uh we have uh Friday service at 7:30, Saturday at 6:00 p.m. and Sunday at 10:00 a.m. And as usual, Saturday we will plan for a breakfast and uh maybe we'll just see if we can't have uh a group breakfast this time. Maybe the brothers and the sisters because it seems to be it's just been the brothers. Maybe we can do something with everyone. I think it would be uh wonderful just to get together and have a little a little another time of uh fellowship. Also wanted to mention that we're going to have youth services Friday uh Friday September the 26 we're going to start them and uh they will just be the last Friday of every month Lord willing and uh we can just sort of pencil that in and go forwards and trust the Lord will bless it. Are you happy tonight? &gt;&gt; Certainly wonderful to be together in his presence. I just wanted to uh read our scripture one more time here. verse 10 of Matthew chapter 24. And uh then and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. Now I just want to read that tonight out of the Amplified Bible. It says, "And then many will be offended and repelled and will begin to distrust and desert distrust and desert him whom they ought to trust and obey." And that just really kind of strikes a chord with me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because who is it that they ought to trust and obey? &gt;&gt; I believe there's many layers to that. &gt;&gt; It can be parents. &gt;&gt; It can be friends. It can be spouses. It can be leadership. There's many different different people that can fit that description. Him whom they ought to trust and obey and will stumble and fall away and betray one another and pursue one another with hatred. Now, we can look at that and say that's actually taking place even right now. And I think it's really important to even though we look at this scripture and say, well, this is Jesus telling his disciples about what will happen because we know they asked him a question and he gave them a multi-part answer to their question. They gave him a multi-art question as well. But he really went into detail with them and and sometimes reading scripture, we can look at it and think it's just going to be out there somewhere. especially when we come to prophecy, prophetic utterances that happen and uh maybe not even realize that they're actually happening, taking place in the day in which we live. And I know myself, it became a real revelation to me when brother Brandham would speak the words that I don't think anybody else has really ever spoken. Maybe they have, but have never really made it as famous as he did. and and that is that you know in the day when Jesus was on the cross they the most religious in in in the message uh which one is it now he talks about it there the most religious place on earth they the most religious people on earth crucified our Lord they took him and they put him up on the cross they scourged him they mistreated him they they belittled him they did all those things to him and not realize that he was actually the fulfillment of the scripture that they claim to believe. &gt;&gt; That's why I say, brothers and sisters, we need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we'll be just like them. &gt;&gt; We will be just like them. Brother Bradam says it very clearly that we are lost as lost can be. We are we are lost without the Holy Ghost in our lives. We will never be able to interpret this word. And and what's more, we won't be able to just interpret this word. We'll never be able to live this word. And I think that's really the stumbling block for children today when they say, "I I I just can't live it." Nobody can live it. &gt;&gt; But when he, the spirit of truth, comes and lives inside of us, he's the one that lives the word. &gt;&gt; It's not us. &gt;&gt; But you know, many false prophets will rise up and deceive and lead many into error. And the love of the great body of people. What's the great body of people? I can't help but think there's only one great body of people. The love of the great body of people will grow cold because of the multiplied lawlessness and iniquity. But he who endures to the end will be saved. It's just such a beautiful thought. &gt;&gt; I love that thought. He who endures to the end will be saved. Remember, we're not running a sprinting race. This isn't the 500yard dash. This isn't the 10year dash. It's not even a 15-year dash. This is this is a marathon. &gt;&gt; And we have got to run at a decent pace. We have to pace ourselves. And you know when we trip and fall, not if, when we trip and fall, just get up and run. Get up and go. &gt;&gt; Even if you have to walk, just walk. But get up again. &gt;&gt; We cannot just lay down. We cannot just quit. But it is until the end. He who endures to the end will be saved. You know, for some people the end will come quickly. And for some people, the end will actually last long. It will take a long time. Uh maybe they'll have good health and live a long time on earth. You know, again, we can look at this this scripture and say, "He who endures to the end will be saved." Maybe these are the people that are just going to be there at the time of the rapture or even beyond the time of the rapture when we're dealing with the wise and the foolish virgins, the the wise and the unwise virgins. You know, I I'm not going to go there with that tonight. I think that's a whole other series that can be preached on. But this this thought about he who endures to the end will be saved. When we reach the end of our road, are we enduring in this word? Is that word enduring and abiding in us? If it is, we will be saved. &gt;&gt; I think it's just beautiful. Looking at this amplified version, you know, many will be offended and repelled and begin to distrust and desert and will stumble and fall away and betray one another and pursue one another with hatred. It just really got me thinking about uh about brother Brandham and the preview of the bride. Isn't it interesting that he had we know he had two versions, two visions, it was one vision, but he had two previews of the bride. And uh it's just beautiful how he talks about it. I'm not going to get too far into that, but in the preview of the bride, she was shown twice. And you know, um I'll I'll probably read the quote a little bit later tonight. What happened with the preview of the bride? First, Brother Brham was shown the church and and that church was the church of America. And we know that brother Brham said, "Is this all that all this ministry, all that we've worked for? This is all that it's come to? It's terrible." &gt;&gt; And we know the description that he gives. I won't read it tonight just for time's sake. I've got some other quotes that I want to bring, but I I just I would recommend maybe go back and read it. go back and and listen to it and hear the way he describes the church, not not the general people, the the Gentiles in this world, not the unbelievers. He's talking about the church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It just really struck me when I was looking at this how he's speaking about the church. This is the preview of the church, but not the true church. I would say this would be this would be the unwise virgins, the ones that really think they're trying to do something. And we know, brother Brandham, he says in one place that that group was led by a what? By a witch. He said that they were led by a witch. My goodness. But that doesn't mean that they don't have a sincere heart. They could have a very sincere heart and desire to worship God. you know, and the god of this evil age. Brother Brandham says there'll be millions and billions of impersonators of Jesus Christ, thinking that they're worshiping God and actually worshiping the devil, not at a a temple set up to Molech or or Baal. It won't be temples like that. It'll be temples unto the living God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They'll be playing music. They'll be singing songs, clapping hands, jumping up and down, and thinking that they're worshiping God when they're actually worshiping Satan. Now, what's the dividing line? This is where it gets good. I'm so glad that the spirit of the Lord comes around and begins to discern the hearts of the people because what that is, the difference between the two, brothers and sisters, is real simple. It's oil. It's oil. And and to bring it right down to common terms, it's not going to be a a nebulous thing or some sort of a comparison that way. It's right simple. It's either full obedience to the complete word of God for your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which entitles you to the token or not. &gt;&gt; That's right. full complete obedience to the word of God or not. That's the dividing line. &gt;&gt; One word off is Satan's Eden. One word off caused the fall of mankind. The woman saying, "Hey, maybe we won't die." &gt;&gt; Why? Because someone who she should have trusted misled her. &gt;&gt; Who was that that she should have trusted in the garden? Yeah, she should have been listening to her husband. But we know as soon as we get out from behind the word of God, we become fair game for the devil. &gt;&gt; And how do we get out from behind the word of God, brothers and sisters? How do we get out from behind the word of God? If this is the word of God, how would I get out from I would take a step out, wouldn't I? &gt;&gt; By taking a step out, I'm actually now out from behind the pulpit &gt;&gt; to get out from behind the word of God. We take a step out. And we've heard it said probably in the past that ministers will talk about it and say there will be a red flag and alls we have to do is step over it. Step over it. Brother Brandham talks about uh from that time, right? From that time. We're familiar with that. From that time, that one time I decided to take a drink of alcohol. From that one time, I had a little teeny puff of a cigarette. From that one time, I said, "Okay, I'll allow myself to listen to that rock and roll." from that one time I watched that one movie. Getting out from the word of God is going to take us way further than we're prepared to go. &gt;&gt; But one word off is actually Satan's kingdom. &gt;&gt; And you know, to take the message of the hour and something that Brother Brandon would teach, a principle that he would teach in here, and for us to say, "Well, I don't know if I need to do that necessarily." Guess what? I'm going to say it real clear. We believe the message of the hour. We believe the message of William Mryiam Brown because it wasn't William Miams Brownham's message. It was the Lord Jesus Christ message that he gave to his prophet according to Amos 3:7. &gt;&gt; So when we decide we're going to do something just a little bit different than what that prophet said, &gt;&gt; we're getting out from behind the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's no longer full obedience to the complete word of God. Now, some people are saying, "I know it. Oh, Brother Barry, how could you say that William Miriam Brham's word is the same as the word of God?" Because he was God's mouthpiece &gt;&gt; and everything that he taught went back to the word of God. And there was times where he taught things that weren't according to the word of God and God revealed it to him and he apologized for it and changed his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we know that Satan doesn't like to be exposed. &gt;&gt; Satan likes to hide. Satan likes to deceive. Satan likes to be a deceiver. I just think it's beautiful. We can see the identification of the the church in the last day. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you, and you should be hated of all nations for my name's sake. and and then shall many be offended and betray one another and shall hate one another. I just want to say this, brothers and sisters, if we have any hatred in our lives for another human being on this earth, then we actually need to go back to that altar and repent. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this real clearly, this altar is always open. &gt;&gt; Someone might say this is, oh, now you're going all Pentecostal on us, saying the altar is open. We're going to have an altar call. We're not going to have an altar call, but if God calls you to come and deal with something in your heart, brothers and sisters, don't delay. &gt;&gt; Come up for prayer. &gt;&gt; Get that dealt with in your life. If there is hatred in our lives for any human being, that's not us. That's the devil. &gt;&gt; But he's in us. We need to get him out. &gt;&gt; We need to starve him out of our lives &gt;&gt; cuz he'll take us down if we hold on to him. And how does that manifest? Sometimes it manifests in different ways. I'm not going to say one way or the other, but we can see that it does manifest. And we need to get the Lord to deal with it in our lives. But you know, the love of many shall wax cold. This word love is G G26, agape. We're pretty familiar with this. There's two two kind of types of love that we know of from the concordance. There's a filio which is a human love and this is agapo love. Agape love is is affection or benevolence especially plural a love feast a feast of charity charity and dear and love is what it says. But we know this is a love that's not even human love. This goes beyond the love that we're dealing with. And that's what this word here is in in Matthew, the the agape love, the love of many shall wax cold because iniquity shall abound, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Iniquity shall abound. And what is iniquity? Iniquity is knowing to do something and not doing it &gt;&gt; or doing something that we know we shouldn't do. It's either one of those. And it's G458. The word iniquity is anomia, illeg illegality, a violation of law or genative case, wickedness, iniquity, transgression of the law and unrighteousness. And you know, we we've talked about this in the past in conversation and maybe even from the pulpit, but what is what is wickedness? Wickedness is masked many times in goodness. People really desiring to do good &gt;&gt; when they're actually doing evil. &gt;&gt; People that aren't raising their children correctly according to the word of God, they're not just actually making a mistake and maybe being deceived. What it actually is is wickedness. It's evil if it's not according to the word of God because it's either good or it's evil. &gt;&gt; People that are treating people in relationships, husband to wife, wife to husband, if it's not according to the word of God, brothers and sisters, let's call it what it is. &gt;&gt; It's wickedness. It's evil. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's either good or evil. &gt;&gt; There's no middle ground with that. But that's where the devil likes to hide. He loves to make it just gray. Oh, we know it's just brother so and it's just sister so. Oh, it's just the way they are. Oh, yeah. No, it ain't. &gt;&gt; It's either good or it's evil. &gt;&gt; And if it's a son and daughter of God, if it's evil, if it's pointed out that it's evil, they will repent for it. And what does repentance mean? It means to change your ways. &gt;&gt; Because we can say all we want, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. When we continually do that and continue on with our ways, what happens is people just tune out. They're like, "Yeah, whatever. Got it. Once again, you did the same thing over and now you're sorry again. Yep. I'm a believer." And and really what happens is you become a liar because you don't believe it. You just simply say you do so they'll shut up and move on and you don't have the awkward conversation. But it's iniquity. Knowing that you shouldn't do something, but going ahead and doing it. Knowing that you shouldn't do something and going ahead and doing it. Doing something that maybe you ought to do and not doing it. Iniquity. Because iniquity shall abound. The love of many shall wax cold. Brothers and sisters, I I hope and I pray that the love of many in our lives won't wax cold. That we will have a burning desire of love in our hearts for many. If we ever lose that love for people, that love for souls, that that desire to help people, then we really have a problem. You know, out of 1951, the resurrection of Lazarus, I uh I sent these on Sunday. 1951 the resurrection of Lazarus. The Bible said because the love of many the sorry the Bible said because the love shall wax cold. The love because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold. He says this is brother Brandham speaking. That's what's the matter with the world. &gt;&gt; They're dying for love. Now, we're not talking about human love because human love has been turned into a perversion. Human love is often imitated. Human love is is twisted and manipulated. But what the world is desiring is agape love. They're looking for a love that's beyond human comprehension. There's a hunger and a thirst for a real love. He says that's what's the matter with the world. They're dying for love. We got plenty of teaching, plenty of churches, but we need a love of God. Hallelujah. No. What's the matter with me today? Look, I tell you, brother, there they were. I can see her happy, rejoicing. He's talking, I believe, about Mary and Elizabeth at their discussion when they realized they were both about to give birth. and and and Mary prophesied and we know the story. Brother Brandham going back to that. He says, "Look, I tell you, brother, there they were. I can see her happy, rejoicing, and she run threw her arms around her and oh, how happy she was because that she'd heard about it. Now I can hear her say, put her arms around her and begin to love her." And they was hugging one another. &gt;&gt; I like that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I like to see women meet another like that. And I like to see men grab. A while ago, a man come out here and took a hold of my hand, just put his arms around me. A young fellow said, "Brother Brandom, I was in your meeting and my little girl was healed with something. I forget what it was." And said, "You stood there and said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, that child will be a certain thing." Watch. He said it was just exactly like that. That's right. And he put his arms around me like that. Amen. I'm just an oldfashioned backwood Sasrash preacher. I like it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just think it's amazing because that's exactly what he said he saw when he went beyond the curtain of time. Isn't it? &gt;&gt; The only thing is there was no human sensation. &gt;&gt; There was no eilio love there. It was all agape love. Brothers and sisters in their proper position. Now, I think we could take this and and say just for the record in case anyone is thinking it, if the devil is in here trying to corrupt our minds or if people watch this later, you know, we're not talking about the world's perversion of men and men and women and women. &gt;&gt; I rebuke that spirit in the name of Jesus Christ right now. And I'll go even further with it. We know the word of God says that we ought to greet one another with a holy kiss. Uh I've been in Kenya with brother Gilbert and experienced that where the brothers get so excited they come and suddenly you got a brother kissing you on your face and you're like hold on a second let's just shake hands we don't need to do that but you know what that's what the word of God says I could say my culture but my culture is not worth nothing &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters there ain't no culture with the Holy Ghost. So I would say who is in in in in in in the fault there who is wrong. I would say perhaps I ought to examine my heart just because in our culture we don't greet one another with a holy kiss, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Maybe after service, you know, I'm not promoting that. I don't want to take it and make it a perversion, brothers and sisters. But what I am saying is the word of God reigns supreme. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And just because someone does that doesn't mean it's wrong. Right. &gt;&gt; But that idea of it being maybe a perversion, a man hugging a man and a woman hugging a woman. That's what we're going to do on the other side. &gt;&gt; We're not going to a doesn't have to be a perversion. Don't do that. Brother Brown, he says this. I like this. He talks about the old time religion here. I like it. Yes, sir. I believe in it. I believe in an old time sky blue sinkilling religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what? It's the Holy Ghost. It's Jesus. The life of Jesus Christ. The baptism, the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives or bust. &gt;&gt; That's what this is right here. Yes, sir. I believe in it. I believe in an old time sky blue sin killing religion. It don't whitewash you. It doesn't give us a cloak of goodness. I'm a message believer. Oh, I was raised in the message. I've never had to have any scars in my life. Oh my. But has it washed you white? &gt;&gt; That's what I want to say. If it has, say amen. If it hasn't, then it's only a whitewash. And it has to be the true baptism of the Holy Ghost living out through us. Every one of us has to come the same way. It don't whitewash you, but it washes you white. It makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that makes the devil mad. &gt;&gt; And I like that. I think it's so beautiful. You know, we talked a little bit about it on Sunday. It's just in my notes today. I'm going to cover the notes that I didn't on Sunday. You know, we can have a religious spirit, and we've heard brother Bradom say it. We've heard other people say it. It's the worst type of spirit that there is. Why is it? Because it's a makeelieve spirit. It's the one that will come into church and sit down and and act like a believer amongst the brethren. It will be the one that actually tries to actually look like everything is okay. They'll know the quotes. They'll know the scripture. Oh, their life is just wonderful. You know, back in Jesus' day, the ultraorththodox Jews. I remember brother Canon teaching this. They could take the scroll. They could take the scroll of paper. And we know that books were scrolls back in that day. You can see that we've got the words written here, the notes. They could take the scroll that was all rolled up, the Bible, the Old Testament, the law of Moses, and they could take a pin and pierce it through that scroll, and they could undo the scroll. And before they undo the scroll, they could tell you exactly what verse and words that pin pierced. &gt;&gt; They knew their word. But it's interesting because they never knew the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. And I want to say that tonight, brothers and sisters, we can be ever so diligent with the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Ultra orthodox message believers and miss what God is doing right now. &gt;&gt; In our midst, right now, tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about in the future. Maybe sometime in a in a meeting in our church here when we're having special meetings. It's right now, brothers and sisters. He is the great I am. He wants to deliver us right now from anything we have need of. &gt;&gt; But are we willing to accept it? &gt;&gt; Or do we have a religious spirit? &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage us to make sure that we don't have a religious spirit. A religious spirit is going to take us to hell. That's where religious spirits are going to go, brothers and sisters. They are not coming up in the second resurrection. They're not going in the first resurrection. They're going to go to hell. and they will actually take whoever is willing to go with them. You know, out of the the resurrection of Lazarus in 1951, talking about this religious spirit, I think it's really important. And brother Bham talks about it, how we could actually be that type of person that would walk down the road and actually be so stuck up, so so pious in our ways, got our nose so high in the air that we would drown in a rainstorm because we believe that God sent a prophet. We believe that everything is just fine in our lives. Brothers and sisters, I'm not saying that we're wrong. What I am saying is let's shake the foundations, the very foundations of what we believe and who we are. Make sure that we've got that Holy Ghost living out through our lives. I heard it said this week. I I I I forgot to mention, brothers and sisters, Brother Cadre Digs sends his regards. He said, "Greet the church for me." He's coming in November. I I forgot the dates to put them down, but you know, I was talking to him and we're talking about this very thing, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he said, "You know what the problem is in the world today, even in message churches, is many people aren't even preaching this. &gt;&gt; They're preaching the deep things. They're getting into the mysteries. They're getting into all of that stuff. And it doesn't mean nothing if you don't have the spirit of truth in you." &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, the seals are not going to put you in the resurrection and rapture. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The thunders are not going to take you out of the grave, &gt;&gt; right? It's not going to happen. Understanding all of the mysterious things in the word of God are not going to save you. &gt;&gt; The literal life of Jesus Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what will save us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why we believe this message. &gt;&gt; It's not a a conformity. It's not a cult. It's not dos and don'ts. We we live our lives this way because we love him. &gt;&gt; He directed our path. What does the word say? Thy word &gt;&gt; is a lamp unto my feet. &gt;&gt; And a light unto my path. Thy word is &gt;&gt; But in 1951, Brother Brandham, he talks about this. I had never heard this before. Never heard anybody talk like this. He says, "That's right. 150 pound man has got enough chemicals in him to make 84 cents. &gt;&gt; That's all we're worth. &gt;&gt; My goodness. We'll go out and get a an Armani suit or a Hugo Boss suit. Maybe we'll get some really cool shades. And you know, for the brothers that have watches, I don't want to throw off on it, but we could get a really cool watch. We can get I'm a shoe guy. We could get a $2,000 pair of sho $1,000 per foot, man. Like, we could get some really nice gear and think we're something, right? Jump in our Ferrari and pull into our mansion, our house. Oh my. But what are we worth? Brother Brandham said in in 1951, 84 cents for 150 pound man. So I was like, I wonder what that means. What is 84 cents in USD in 1951 equal to today? Maybe it's a few thousand. Nope. $1023. That's what we're worth today, brothers and sisters. Now, someone like me, you know, maybe 200 plus, maybe I'm worth a bit more. But, you know, as a human being, we ain't worth nothing. &gt;&gt; That's what the point is. We ain't worth nothing. The only thing that makes us of any value is his love, his life inside of us. &gt;&gt; Because we don't have the the the the iniquity abounding in our lives. our our love won't wax cold for many. &gt;&gt; You know, I I just had to say this tonight. I think it's so good. When we talk about this stuff, we talk about understanding this has to happen by revelation. We can't do it on our own. Understanding what we're talking about, the spirit, the literal life of Jesus Christ. It it takes literal revelation. And what is revelation? Revelation is something that God gives you directly to your heart and nobody else can do it. You can hear it and hear it and hear it, but it's got to be a true revealing in your heart to you. And you know what that is? That brother Brandham calls it the new birth. &gt;&gt; God making himself known personally to the individual. Then God begins to speak to us. And make no mistake about it. I say it many times. I'll say it again tonight. You can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost without actually getting a drop of water on you. &gt;&gt; That's scriptural. We know that. That's what happened at Cornelius's house. That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; But what happened afterwards &gt;&gt; according to the word of God? Full obedience to the complete word of God &gt;&gt; entitles us. And I think it's so beautiful because there is a spirit of entitlement in this world. Why not be entitled about the right things? Why why why not be entitled about what we are entitled to truly the life of Jesus Christ living out through us? I think it's a beautiful thing. We look around and see this impersonation spirit. Oh, I'm entitled to be the first in line. I'm entitled to have the first and the best of everything. We're entitled to have the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We're entitled to actually go in the resurrection rapture. We're entitled to actually be able to speak the word &gt;&gt; and see other people become impregnated with this same word that set us free. &gt;&gt; 1951, brother Bradom and believest thou this, he says, you know what's the matter with the people today? We're getting away from that. Don't feel for one another. I say, Lord, help us. This is in 51. don't feel for one another. Why? It used to be when I was a kid, if the neighbor got sick, why we went over there and cut wood for them and help them fill the silo, which means cut their grain, cut their corn, and mama would go down and wash up the kids and get their breakfast for them when someone was sick. But now you don't even know your neighbors dead &gt;&gt; unless you read about it in the paper. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, help us to know our neighbors. &gt;&gt; Help us to know our brothers and our sisters in the church. &gt;&gt; Because that's why we gather together in the body. &gt;&gt; When one person hurts, the whole body hurts. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think it's amazing because I I haven't really been to many churches that I would call my home church. And I know many here have had a few different home churches in their lives. And I've heard it said many times that this church has something really special. And I believe that's what it is. And I don't think I started it. I think brother Ken started it. I think the founders of this church started it. What they did was they committed this church unto Jesus Christ. And the leadership of the Holy Ghost is what drives this church. It's not the leadership of man. And I think it's amazing. I I say this tonight, this quote here, because I want to encourage us to just maybe take a closer look at our brothers and our sisters and make sure that everything's okay. When we don't see someone, who's calling them? &gt;&gt; Is it the pastor? Is it the deacons? Is it the trustees? Is it the treasurer? Is it all the offices of the church? Or is it the brothers and the sisters? &gt;&gt; We need to look out for one another. We talked about in the past, you know, Cain's nature is to say, "Am I my brother's keeper?" No, I'm busy. I got a job. I'm busy. I got lots of lots to do. The pastor probably has nothing to do. So, he should be calling them. You know, if God puts him on your heart, that's God saying you should do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't think for a second that God doesn't put people on my heart, man. He does. He does. He does. But I just want to encourage us. Let's not see iniquity abound because if iniquity abounds the love of many is going to wax cold and that is a terrible terrible thing especially for our children to see. And uh you know it can actually happen. It can happen. Why can it happen? Because the scripture said so. Because Jesus said so. &gt;&gt; And you know what? When he says it, we believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that settles it. So I think it's beautiful because the disciples ask the questions and they get the answers. And when you get the answers, we have the keys to actually avoidance, the keys to preventative measures in our lives. It's just a beautiful thing, you know. I just can't help but think about this this devil. And uh we know that that's exactly what it is that's causing all of this. It's the devil. It's the Satan. It's uh it's iniquity. &gt;&gt; Let's put it back where it goes. this iniquity is actually the devil because he's going to do everything he can to stop us from doing what we should do and everything he can to get us to do what we shouldn't do. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care what side of the road we fall on, what's what ditch, the right hand or the left hand. It doesn't matter to him so long as we fall. We can be the ultraorththodox religious or we can just be lax and and laxidasical in our Christian walk. It don't matter one way or the other. But let's not take it and make it our own. I don't want to say that iniquity is ours. Iniquity is our cause. Let's put it back on the original cause of iniquity. And if you turn with me in your Bibles to Ezekiel 28, let's put it right back where it belongs. Ezekiel chap 28 11. Once again according to the scripture God speaking through his prophet prophet Ezekiel verse 11 chapter 28 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus saith the Lord God thou sealest the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in the in Eden, the garden of God. Who is this? Who has been in the garden of Eden of God? He goes on to say, "Every precious stone was thy covering. There was nothing that you didn't have. the Sardis, the topaz, and the diamond, the barrel, the onyx, and the jasper, and the sapphire, and the emerald, and the carbuncle, and the gold. You know, I just can't help but think while we're reading this, brothers and sisters, what would it be like if God would give us, and I know that he's giving it to us here in his word, but to be able to actually see it with our eyes, to see it with our hearts and our minds by revelation, to actually see Satan in his first estate, &gt;&gt; to see how far he's actually fallen. To think that he would be cast down like he is. We'll carry on here. But to hear this is where he was. This was his covering. The Sardis, topaz, diamond, barrel, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle, and gold. The workmanship of thy tabets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created. He was the leader of worship. He was the one that knew how to make every single sound. He knew how to compose every single song, how to make every single instrument, everything perfect time, perfect synchronization, perfect harmony, perfect pitch, perfection. &gt;&gt; Right? But verse 14 says, "Thou art the anointed cherub that coverth, and I have set thee so. Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God. Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee. Satan, that cherub, he was perfect in all of his ways. Everything, his environment, everything, his thinking, his his creation, all that he did. And we know, I'll take that back. Brother Bradam said that he wasn't able to create. He had everything except for the power to create. He wasn't creating anything, I believe, that God didn't create. So, I'll I'll just back that up a little bit. Forgive me. But he had perfection in the palm of his hand. He was perfection according to the word of God. But what did he do? He had iniquity in his heart. He knew that he should do something and he didn't do it. A and he knew he shouldn't do something and he went ahead and did it. He knew that he would never ever be the son of the most high. He knew that he would never be that one. That's why he said, "I want to be like the most high. &gt;&gt; I want to be on the side of the north sitting in the congregation." But I just can't help but think here in this description, who are we talking about? We're talking about the serpent. We're talking about the devil. &gt;&gt; Because who was it that was in the Garden of Eden? Let's turn back there for a sec. Let's go back to Genesis just for the sake of discussion. Genesis talking about iniquity. Iniquity. This one that was perfect in all thy ways. Perfect in all thy ways from the day that thou was created. Why? Until iniquity was found in thee. This is the one that was in the garden that we read about in this scripture here in Ezekiel. Genesis chapter 3 verse one. Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, "Ya, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden?" And the woman said unto the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die." And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall not surely die." one word. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. So what happened here? This one that was created perfect in his day. He was created perfect in all of his ways until iniquity was found in him. He was cast down to the earth and found himself in the garden. And what did he do? He took that iniquity and gave it to the woman and persuaded the woman to accept that iniquity. &gt;&gt; In verse six, it's it's amazing. I just have to say this when you look at this scripture in in verse four and five. And the serpent said unto the woman, "And you shall not surely die." Verse five, for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. Wasn't she already a god? &gt;&gt; She was the god of the earth. &gt;&gt; She was the bride of the god of the earth. God created Adam to be the god of the earth. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; God Elohim was the god of heaven. But Adam was created to be the god of the earth. And here the devil came around and tried to tell her that she would become what she already is. &gt;&gt; What? master deceiver. Hey, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; A formidable adversary is what brother Brandham said. &gt;&gt; But when the woman saw the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise, oh my, isn't that interesting? We want to be wise. The tree of knowledge of good and evil. She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. And we know that Adam was not deceived. She was deceived. She was the one in the transgression. But Adam would not let his bride go. &gt;&gt; And that's why I think it's astounding. I'll say it every single time that a human being could say, "I I believe that I could put my wife away. I could put my bride away." Who would want to do that? Right? &gt;&gt; Adam didn't want to do it to his wife. Adam forfeited his life for his wife. Jesus came and forfeited his life for his wife. And a human being could still say, "I want to forfeit my wife for my life." Huh? I don't know, man. I don't think that adds up. That's just me. But isn't it interesting to look at this one word off? Thou shalt not surely die. But this is the one that was in the garden. We read this in uh in uh Ezekiel, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel, what is it? Ezekiel 28:13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God, that cherub that was made to be perfect, &gt;&gt; which is the serpent, which is clearly identified as the devil. &gt;&gt; Now, this being the serpent, we know, I'm just going to say it this way. Well, maybe we'll just go on and read here since we're here in verse 7 of of Genesis chapter 3. And the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked. You could see that they had gone from the veil of the word. They came out from behind the veil of the word is what brother Brandham taught. And and they were actually now living behind a lust veil. &gt;&gt; Eve desired to lust is what caused this to happen. And what happened? Their eyes of them both were open. They were behind a different veil now. And they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together. They got all religious, created their own religion, and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden of the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves in the presence of the Lord amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam. Adam never called to God. He never said, "Lord, forgive me for what I've done." God came down and said, "Adam, where are you at?" &gt;&gt; God knew exactly where he was in the garden. He wasn't talking about his geographical location. He was talking about his spiritual location. Adam, where have you gone? And the Lord called unto Adam and said unto him, where art thou? And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself. And he identified now that he was seeing things through a different veil. &gt;&gt; He our speech betrays us, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Doesn't it? God knew his heart though. Verse 11. And he said, "Who told thee that thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat?" And the man said, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree." Now the finger pointing, "And I did eat." And the Lord God said unto the woman, "What is this that thou hast done?" And the woman said, "The serpent beguiled me and I did eat." &gt;&gt; Here we go with that serpent. And remember, brothers and sisters, I I just think it's so important. It's beautiful how brother Brandham brings this. But remember, it's the Holy Ghost through brother Brandham that brought this to this age in which we live in. The serpent was not the serpent the way that we know the serpent to be. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there the serpent that we talk about here is the actual missing link in the genetic &gt;&gt; study of human existence where they would say what's the link between the chimpanzeee and the human being? What's the link between the apes and the human, the animal kingdom and the humans? There's a break there somewhere that they just can never seem to figure out. And we know that that is because God placed a curse on this creature. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, we know the many times you see the story books and you hear people talk about the serpent, the serpent, how it's a snake, and you see the snake and and it's represented as a snake in the tree with the fruit and and the naked man and the woman and and you see that lovely picture in the Garden of Eden. But why would the snake be cursed to be a snake &gt;&gt; if it's actually a curse? I want to start there. Why would the snake be cursed to be what it is? It doesn't make any sense. &gt;&gt; If the English language means anything, it just doesn't add up. But she said to God when he questioned her, "The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat." Verse 14, "And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all the cattle and above every beast." So, isn't that interesting? Doesn't that mean, wouldn't you think that that would mean that that serpent was actually above the cattle? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So now he's cursed. He's got a curse greater than all the cattle. &gt;&gt; You're cursed above all the cattle, above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. But here's the critical part to this whole entire story. Why if they ate fruit from the tree, which is what mainstream Christianity talks about, and I would say this, all of those unwise virgins talks about, why is verse 15 even in the Bible? Verse 15 says, "And I will put emnity between thee and the woman." Talking to the serpent, "I'll put emnity between thee, between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed." What does that have to do with any of this? &gt;&gt; Why would he be talking about emnity between the seeds of these two creatures? &gt;&gt; If there wasn't something more to the story, &gt;&gt; why would that be? And it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. And we know this is prophecy. This is prophetic. It was actually fulfilled in in Matthew 13:25 and 28. It actually carries on. But verse 16 says, "Unto the woman," he said, "I will greatly multiply thy sorrow, and thy conception and sorrow, thou shalt bring forth children, and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee." And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake, and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns also, and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field, and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread. till thou return unto the ground. For out of it was thou taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return. I lived my whole life thinking, "Thanks a lot, Eve. You're the one that did this." But we can say, "Thanks, Adam, because you wouldn't let your bride go." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want to say this, brothers and sisters, anytime you sweat, think about this scripture here. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When we're sweating in our job, for our efforts to provide for our families, to put bread on the table, it's because of this right here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is why we don't sweat because we're created to be sweaters. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is actually the curse. &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing, too, because when we look at this, God cursed the woman in her body and he cursed man through his environment. That's right. &gt;&gt; He cursed the snake to be a different creature alto together. It's pretty amazing when you look at it. &gt;&gt; But this is exactly the one who hast been in Eden, the garden of God. This one that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created. This is the serpent. Turn turn with me over to Revelations chapter 12. I really didn't mean for this to become a Bible study, but I find ourselves here. So, let's go. Revelations chapter 12. I just think it's beautiful. Let's put this iniquity that we're talking about right back on the owner of this iniquity. This is where it was found originally. It was found in heaven in the heart of Satan, in the heart of Lucifer, in the heart of that cherub that was created perfectly. It wasn't found in our hearts, brothers and sisters. This is something that we just have to contend with. It's not something that we actually own even. It's not ours. This is the devil's and he's the one that's going to reap the reward for it forever. And uh Revelations 12:7 says, "And there was war in heaven, and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon fought against his angels and prevailed not, neither was their place found anymore in heaven. And that great dragon was cast out." Now when was this brothers and sisters we can look at the scripture here. Remember we said at the beginning of the service we can take this scripture and say well this is going to be off in the future somewhere. Is it or did it actually take place already? I think many of these scriptures, we we we we just need to have a a willingness to just step back and say, "Maybe the way that I've thought about this my whole entire life isn't exactly the way that God intends for us to see it." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Just because mainstream Christianity teaches it one way does not mean it's actually true according to the prophetic utterance in which God sends. But verse 9 says, "And the great dragon was cast out, that old &gt;&gt; serpent called the what? &gt;&gt; The devil and &gt;&gt; and Satan which deceiveth the whole world. &gt;&gt; He was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him. &gt;&gt; His agents, they became the the principalities &gt;&gt; and the powers. and the rulers of darkness, &gt;&gt; the ones that try and fire their fiery darts at us. But if we put on the whole armor of God, brothers and sisters, it's not something we can just recite. It's literally the life of Jesus Christ in us by taking the true baptism of the Holy Ghost according to the word for our day. What happens is we put on the whole armor of God and we are able to quench the fiery darts of all of those evil devils that want to come against us and stop us from actually getting the revelation of literally who we are &gt;&gt; once we realize who we are. &gt;&gt; There ain't no devil that can stop us. &gt;&gt; There ain't no minister that can beguile us. There ain't no untrue word of God that someone can bring. There is no such thing as an untrue word of God. But there's no word of God that can be manipulated in any way that would actually lead us astray. If we truly have Jesus Christ living out through us, he will never deny his word. He will deny all of men's words. He will deny all of men's traditions. He will deny all of the Christianity that people try and throw at him. But he will never deny his own word. And if someone has the genuine sincerity of heart to take him at his word, he will honor that. That's the only thing that he will honor. I just think it's beautiful to look at this because we can see the origins of iniquity &gt;&gt; because iniquity shall abound. Just because it abounds, it doesn't mean we have to say, "I'm on board with it." &gt;&gt; It's okay because it abounds. We can say, "No way. That's the devil's. &gt;&gt; Give it back to him." Amen. &gt;&gt; I just think it's beautiful because when we look at this scripture, if we just read a little further in Revelations chapter 12 verse 9 says, "And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him." I can't help but think that, you know, when we read this, we we look at it from maybe a space and time perspective. We look at it in the space and time continuum sometimes, but we need to remember we're talking about an eternal environment where Satan is cast out. This is from an eternal environment. And I think it's beautiful because let's just continue reading here and then I'll I'll preach a little. I think it's wonderful. Verse 10 says, "And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven." What do you think that loud voice was, brothers and sisters? Now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God. The kingdom of our God. This isn't God speaking, &gt;&gt; is it? &gt;&gt; Now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ. It wasn't angels speaking, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because the angels don't know about the power of Christ. Remember the angels will all be silent one day in heaven to listen to who? &gt;&gt; To listen to the redeemed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God for the power of his Christ. The one that came and gave redemption where no angel has redemption. &gt;&gt; If they fall from their first estate, they're gone. That's it. But not humans. Because of why? Because of the power of his Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; The power of his Christ. For the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night. &gt;&gt; And I just can't help but think, brothers and sisters, now what is there? There's just a bumper of blood, isn't there? Isn't that what the prophet taught? There is an accuser of the brethren there nattering, nattering, nattering, nattering. What there is is a bumper of blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet was clearly shown that when he was in that diner that day when he was accusing that woman who was an immoral woman. She was an immoral woman. &gt;&gt; The police officer who you should trust the legal guardian of society. You should be able to trust him. They were misbehaving and brother Brandham was identifying. He was condemning them. And God showed him this vision. And he showed him the sins going up and that bumper of blood protecting Christ. And he said, "You know those people, my &gt;&gt; just my words, &gt;&gt; those people. Look at those sins from those people." And what did God say to him? &gt;&gt; It ain't it ain't their sins &gt;&gt; that's hitting me in the face in that bumper of blood. I am the bumper of blood and and those sins that are hitting me are your sins &gt;&gt; as the prophet of God. And what did that do? It was exactly what he needed to hear to go back and actually say, "Listen, sister, do you know the gospel of Jesus Christ? Do you know the power of his Christ?" Because I do and I wonder if you would like to know about it. And what did he do? He went and won her. He gave her the opportunity to know Jesus Christ for herself instead of condemning her. And how ought we to behave in the day in which we live. I just think it's beautiful to read this verse by Revelation and recognize that, you know, brethren, talking about the uh the eternal time, the eternal place. There's no such thing as eternal time, but there's a little speck of time in eternity. But to look at this and think about it, how brother Brandham said that he went beyond the curtain of time. He went into an eternal realm and he saw millions of people that were screaming, "You know what? Thank you." Because we are resting on that doctrine that you preached, which is exactly what Paul preached. We're resting on that. And we know that he came back and said, you know, just keep pressing on. I don't want to go back, but if I've got to go back, that was the voice that he heard. And that was just a very highlevel flyby with that revelation. But, you know, talking about that, I just can't help but think there was a group of people in heaven that were able to recognize what was taking place here. And they recognize that he was no longer there. There's just a bumper of blood. &gt;&gt; And that bumper of blood is the Christ, &gt;&gt; the power of the Christ. &gt;&gt; And you know, verse 11, brothers and sisters, we hear this many times. I think it's so beautiful. Verse 11 says, "And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony." &gt;&gt; That's why I think it's so beautiful to have a testimony service. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because the blood of the lamb gives us a testimony. &gt;&gt; The blood of the lamb in our life gives us the ability to recognize the Christ, the power of the Christ, the one that actually gives us the life that we live. They overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death. And we know that there's a group of people that will actually have to give their lives who reject this message who reject the message of salvation. Many people will say, you know, there's there's many different ways that you can actually get there. And and if you're driving somewhere, sure enough, there are many different ways. But Jesus said that I am the way, &gt;&gt; the truth, and the life. And that no man comes unto the father but by me. &gt;&gt; That's the only way that we will actually see the resurrection and rapture in the day in which we live. And you know, from the perspective that we want because unfortunately there's going to be people that see the resurrection and rapture and they're going to know in their hearts that it's actually taken place and they missed it. And I'm not saying it to scare us, brothers and sisters. I'm just saying it because it's a true reality. &gt;&gt; But then there's other people that are going to go on having church services, wonderful times, and and worshiping God and baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins, thinking they're getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the rapture will already be gone is what brother Brandham said. &gt;&gt; I just think it's amazing to think that that could even happen. How could that even take place? I'm sure that we've all heard other ministers talk about what it will be like the moment that the accuser of the brethren sees the bride in heaven. &gt;&gt; Actually sees the queen of heaven, sees that the resurrection and rapture has taken place and recognizes that now he's got three and a half years to accomplish anything that he desires. That's all. Because after three and a half years, he's going to be bound for a thousand years. And then he'll be loose for just a little season, but he'll be bound not with logging chains. Brother Brandham says he'll be bound by chains of circumstance because he'll be able to go and tempt everyone who's in the millennium because you know what? They're going to have a brand new body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And blessed are they that are called unto the first resurrection. Right? And that's what that is, the millennium. Who doesn't want to go into the millennium? Who would want to try and make an excuse for this message of the hour? This is the message that's going to change our bodies, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I just can't imagine wanting to make any excuse for it. Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But here we have this question. Why is the devil referred to as the serpent in this scripture? I think it's just beautiful. Because that old serpent which is called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole earth out of Revelations 12, it's an identification that God gave us through his word so that we wouldn't be deceived. But we can take it and and read it and and know by revelation that that is exactly what's taken place. That that dragon was cast out and and that dragon that was cast out was identified in the garden in 1954 out of questions and answers. I'll call the musicians as we hit nine o'clock. I won't keep us late tonight. I kind of over overwent on Sunday. I hope it was okay. And uh you know, kind of like what we're talking about tonight. I could easily have preached it on Sunday. I was ready to go with it, too. But I know that if you go too far, then uh we can actually we can actually have uh we can actually have people that you lose, people get distracted. Are you happy tonight? Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of questions and answers in 1954 talking about iniquity abounding and the love of many waxing cold. Maybe stand with me as we read this last quote here. He says, "You don't find that no more." What's the matter? The spirit of God is withdrawn. Jesus said predicted this that the love because the love of many their love would fail because iniquity would abound. The love of many would fail. See, grow cold, go away. The love is dying away. And what they got into just a form. I say, "Lord, help us." Beat the piano up and down real hard and yell, "Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord." See, like that, it's just a form. I believe we have the Holy Ghost, Jesus Christ, speaking through his prophets saying this. Don't fool yourself. See, just fooling yourself. See, listen, brother. Until we I go like this. I think it's important to just remember, let's not fool ourselves. Let's make sure that we understand what we're doing. He says, "I'm not talking about our tabernacle. I'm talking about what I find around the United States. It's become just a form just kind of acting that we used to have and the travail of soul. It's just about over. Oh, brother, sister, God have mercy on us. May God have mercy. That travail of soul, brothers and sisters, I say, Lord, help us. Lord, help me. Let's just bow in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for your goodness. We thank you for your tender mercies in our lives. Father, we thank you for your word, Lord, that you would give us the ability to take the book and eat it up, Lord. And even though our flesh doesn't like it, Lord, &gt;&gt; we know that our soul thrives on it. And Father, tonight the word that we heard, help us, Lord Jesus, to not ever let our love wax cold because of iniquity. Because if we do, it's only because we allow Satan to give that to us, just like he gave it to Eve. Father, I pray that tonight you would give us discernment and wisdom, Lord, that we would recognize in our lives the things that we do, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; that are displeasing. and help us Lord to recognize the things that we need to do so that we don't have iniquity in our lives because if we do we know with the love in our life will wax cold father we just thank you for your word we know it's our delivering power we thank you for sending us yourself the Christ &gt;&gt; and Lord Jesus we know that it's not just in print it's not just 2,000 years ago it's the book that we eat every day and that sustains us from day to day. Father, we just ask that you would be with those who are traveling, who are away, Lord, that you would keep your hand upon them. Bless their their efforts in everything they're doing. Lord, we pray that you would bring them home safely at the appointed time. Lord, thank you for bringing the visitors our way. Father, bless the freezens abundantly. Father, we just ask now that you would keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways. just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we sing 881? I'd rather have Jesus. Don't forget the prayer meeting tomorrow night, 7:30. Brother Juma has a prayer request for his wife's immigration. It's fully underway and we want to continue to stand with our brother and remember her. We certainly will do that, brother. We also want to remind you of the picnic in Prairie Park on August the 31st. I'd rather have Jesus. I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold. I'd rather be his than have riches untold. I'd rather rather have Jesus than houses or land. My brother, let my dear to me That's way I'd rather have Jesus trust you and me the lost. I'd ra be faithful to him. I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide. I gather to truth to his holy name and to be the king of the master this way. I'd rather have Jesus than anything to li Our food is sweet and honey. Heat. Heat.
