poem in my life never even enjoyed poetry but two weeks ago I was driving in my vehicle and these words came to me and over the last two weeks the to help the Holy Ghost I've kind of added to it and honed it so I strongly believe that someone's meant to hear this today the title of the poem is spiritual maturity once we knew in part our vision incomplete our prophecies mere Shadows at our feet with passion our Prophet implored this beautiful Truth for us to explore oh don't be children be women and men the End Road is here let faith in you transcend transcend a little greenness left to bake he's waited for fruit on the branch to take with a heart full of compassion he encouraged us so seek God's face and let wisdom flow the time has come to own our place true love Faith and God's divine grace the perfect one has come he's arrived Shining Light so clear no longer in part we truly see and hear as a child we thought and acted like a child might but the matured are promised to be led by the mind of Christ with heart mind and speech all aligned choosing to live by God's truth each time once we saw through a mirror dark and unclear the world's turmoil often caused our hearts to fear but now we see him face to face by loves Eternal embrace our chosen place with the true anointing of his spirit we are renewed it's God's power it transfigures and imbues with all authority to discern to love and to serve his great name we abide and are preserved the anointing from above did descend guiding us always our true purpose to defend through great storms and trials we often tripped and squirmed but by his Loving Care we found the strength to stand firm for in his mighty name we did overcome because our Victory he hath already won his election persevered and will never fail it's the guide pulse that keeps you and I from drifting off the trail Our Hope and Faith have endured but it's his love his most precious and pure the anointing we received anchors Within a teacher of Truth free from all sin no need for man's teachings God's word is true simply abide in him and he will abide in you the Capstone so pure and right our Union veiled from Mortal sight Lo the spiritual bride appeared her true color showing I'm protrude by fear as we began our Revival Inner Strength bright and vital aligning ourselves with God's very word our hearts and souls with Revelation stirred behold

the elect bride of Jesus Christ welcome to the lambies God bless you and everyone we're certainly thrilled to be in his presence once again we just have a few prayer requests we'd like to bring before the the Lord this morning starting with the praise report I'm sure that anyone who is a part of the chat of the local assembly here saw this morning about brother Frank Cronkite we need to give him praise as much as we give him requests to go from a terrible prognosis by the doctors to something that they can work with we'll just trust that that report continues to change when they go to do the examination again we certainly want to thank everyone for your prayers I know on behalf of the Cronkite family and the Hoffer family thankful for the prayers and I've had the opportunity to talk to brother Frank and he has said thank you for the prayers and he's just in a good spirit it's a tremendous thing to see I just want to continue to thank the Lord for touching brother Frank and the Cronkite family I just want to remember sister Sharon Rose who was traveling in Nigeria now the clawsons who are traveling in Saskatchewan certainly thankful for Sister Mary Jeanette coming home she uh went to visit family and to visit friends believers her people and she just had a wonderful time so we're certainly excited to hear their good reports from her we just like to remember brother sister Sharon and Brother Sam Brennan they're not feeling well this morning brother Andrew Claussen is not feeling well the livesies are not feeling well we had a request from Sister Naomi neighbor for her grandfather for the James Mayfield who has felt led to travel to Burma Myanmar which is uh basically turned upside down now with war and civil one rest so we certainly want to make sure we are in the perfect will of the Lord when we put ourselves in a position like that sister Naomi's request was that the Lord would just bring her Grandpa home safely if you have a need this morning maybe just make it known unto him with an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus one more time we know that your ear is open to our prayers father we never want to treat you like a vending machine where we put our tithe in the plate and we expect a result father we thank you for your word and your word simply says that if we would just try you in these things that you would rebuke the Devourer for our sakes father and we know that that goes well beyond a financial blessing Lord Jesus we thank you for your word we thank you for the understanding that we can just follow your word according to the way that you have given it to us father Lord we know that it's evolved and it's been handed down through the centuries and many times the devil would like to put it in people's minds that somehow there's a deluded word that we can't trust or we can't believe but we know that you sent a prophet in our day and we know that you only speak to men through prophets Lord and we just accept that word that you sent through the prophet saying that you just need to take your word the way that you have given it to us and we thank you for that word because it's a perfect word and it's an unveiled word Lord there's no more mystery to it father this morning we thank you for your goodness to every one of us Lord thank you for the many needs in our lives Lord because without them we would not know the attributes that you have father we know that you are our healer we know that you provide our every need we know that you are our Banner that you are our comfort that you are our strength father oh Lord Jesus that you are our help our very present help in a time of trouble father Lord that you are a friend that sticketh closer than a brother Lord Jesus father you are so wonderful Lord Jesus this morning we just asked that you would Lord just sovereignly meet the need that was made known unto you this morning by each and every uplift hand father we know that we all have things in our lives that we're trying to understand and work through and go through father and we pray that you would just help us through them because you never said that you would take us away from the trial that you would take the trial away from us that you said you would make a way through the trial and father through that trial you would make a way of Escape for us father and Lord we thank you for that promise Lord so we just thank you for meeting each and every need this morning Lord father we pray for brother James Mayfield this morning Lord we know he has family here that loves him Lord Jesus and we just ask that you would watch over our brother Lord that he would just be in your perfect will father from the beginning to the end of his trip Lord Jesus father that there would just be testimonies of his journey father of your goodness to him and to the people around him and father according to Sister Naomi's request father that you would bring her Grandpa home safely at the appointed time father we just want to continue to ask father for those who are traveling now sister Sharon Rose Lord that you would be with her in Nigeria that you would bring her home safely father at the appointed time we pray for the clausons who are in Saskatoon Lord that you would watch over them and bring them home safely at the appointed time father we know that there's many people that are ill now in the congregation father brother Aiden and sister Michelle Lord we pray that you would just touch them Father we just rebuke that Spirit of covet in the name of Jesus Christ and father we just thank you for raising them up according to your word according to the promise in your word father we pray that you would watch over the children father that they would not have anything to do with it that it just wouldn't touch them Father Lord Jesus we pray that you would just be with brother Andrew father we pray that we could just rebuke that that Spirit of gout in the name of Jesus Christ father Lord that he could just raise up and be free from that Lord once and for all that it would not Badger him and and drag him down but father we know that that's the position of Satan is below our feet father and we know that he's trying to mess with brother Andrew's walk and we just rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ father we just love you and we thank you today we pray that you would just be with sister Sharon and Brother Sam Brennan father no doubt they would probably prefer to be here today than not feeling well but Lord we know that you know every situation and we pray that you would just touch their bodies also Father Lord that you would raise them up so they could be healthy again according to your will we just love you and we thank you today Father Lord we just ask that you would be glorified now in all that's said and done as we go forwards with this service father from the beginning to the end we pray that you would be glorified in all that said and done father we just love you and we thank you and we ask all of these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians certainly thankful to be here today if you have your Bibles I'd like to continue on sort of with what we were talking about the last couple of weeks in sort of uh uh maybe just turn to Matthew 14 while I talk I apologize Matthew 14. we'll start with verse 22. we were talking about the believer's position in Christ and uh I just maybe have gone on a little bit of a tangent but I believe it's the leadership of the Lord and I'm certainly thankful for it and I've learned enough to know that we just have to follow it when it happens so we'll just start with Matthew chapter 14. start with verse 21. this is ending with the story of the feeding of the five thousand of the bread and and the fish and we're all familiar with that story and they took up 12 baskets full afterwards verse 21 says and they had they that had eaten were about five thousand men beside women and children so who knows how many people that really was that was a lot of people they still had 12 baskets full one for each disciple verse 22 and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father Lord sometimes when we read your word just strikes our souls father and this morning one more time I pray that as we approach you father that we wouldn't do it lightly father that we would do it with reverence in our hearts that we would recognize who we've invited to be in our service today and Lord just like that story that we read some time ago father about Simon the the Pharisee father let us not be like him Lord Jesus but let us meet you and greet you with a kiss father let us wash your feet Lord Jesus let us recognize your presence and appreciate you in our midst today father as you speak to us along the way Lord we just ask that we could take this word that was spoken father and just allow you to break it open to us fresh like a fresh loaf of bread Lord Jesus father that it would just feed our souls one more time we just love you and we thank you for your goodness to us thank you for this word Lord we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated I just think it's so wonderful the words that Jesus spoke to the disciples in that moment when they were sore afraid they were dealing with the spirit they were so afraid of the storm that was happening all around them they were so afraid all together if it wasn't the storm it was the spirit and what was the first words that Jesus said is just simply be not afraid be of good cheer it is I if we could just recognize that when we're in the midst of the storm brothers and sisters there's so much to all of this I I I know there's so much to unpack I don't know if we'll get into it today but the very next part of this maybe we'll get into a little bit later is when Peter he said hey if that's you Lord then then bid me to come unto you let me do what you're doing and we know that he actually did but like I said we're not going to go too far into that we just have a few announcements we're already into June everybody knows that it's just amazing to think that it's just time just flies and uh we have brother Dale Smith will be here this Wednesday to take the service I would like to apologize it was brought to my attention that some of the folks here did not receive ballots to vote on the church offices because we did it virtually um I definitely apologize for that I don't know what happened but I just would like to let everyone know that the results that came in were unanimous it was 100 except for one person and some one person voted no and and I don't know what that means or or where it's at and I don't think it's relevant to say who it is so I'm not going to but I just wanted to let you know the lowest score was 99 percent so a couple of ballots um I don't know if it would change much but I certainly do apologize for that and moving forwards hopefully we can iron out these wrinkles and uh and make it easier for everyone um on the 11th we're going to be away that will be next weekend we're going to Saskatoon and brother Gilbert has agreed to take the service on Sunday and uh so he'll be ministering at home I I certainly would like to thank the Brethren here in the local assembly for their willingness to put their shoulder to the wheel and to minister I was just meditating on this to know that as brother Mervin took the service on Wednesday and you know the brother said that you know we're not pulling one way and the other we're all pushing together for the same goal and and that means a lot that means a lot I think to everyone but it means a lot to me personally to know that we can go away and we don't have to wonder it's not a nail biter wondering what what's going to be said or what we're going to have to deal with when we come home and most of all the most important thing is that the Sheep get fed that the Believers get a meal and and that's the critical factor with all of this and and I just want to take a moment here and just just offer a bouquet to each minister in the congregation here for your efforts thank you [Applause] we know the only reason that we can have success to come and stand behind the sacred desk is surrender our willingness to put aside our thoughts and to put aside our ideas and try and find the mind of the Lord just for a few moments to try and maybe bring something that would bless the congregation and it's not easy to do so God bless you I just wanted to mention we have a prayer meeting uh coming up on the 15th at 7 30 that'll be Thursday the 15th we have a youth event on the 16th that's going to be at our house and this month we will not have a communion service but we will have a worship service on the 25th at 6 PM that will be an evening Sunday evening service so I trust that everyone will uh maybe practice a special or if you've got a song in your heart that you'd like to sing or maybe a poem that you would like to read it's certainly an appropriate time just to get together and let our hair down so to speak and just Worship the Lord just Express to him the joy that he has put in our hearts you happy this morning we have uh brother Danny del mundo family is coming and I understand they'll be here in July and we have brother Andrew Glover tentatively arranged for the 13th of August and uh for the James nuvanda Bandy all the way into September the 27th and I was looking at this and I was thinking boy this isn't going to be long and we'll be having brother James nouveanda Bandy here at the end of September it's amazing how this goes I was uh I was awake very very early this morning and I was quite surprised actually at how early it starts to get light we're almost at the uh I guess the summer equinox it'll be June 21st the longest day of the year and uh yeah it gets light pretty early now and it's funny because it'll just change just like that and it'll start getting darker and darker and let's just enjoy the sunshine while we have it last week we talked about uh Mount Transfiguration I just want to do a little recap on that because I think it plays into uh sort of what we're talking about here today the scripture in Matthew chapter 14 and we know that Jesus he took Peter James and John up to a mountain apart and we know that he was transfigured before them we're not going to go and read the scripture this morning I'll just do a quick fast recap and we know that Jesus was transfigured before them and that's what the word says He was transfigured and the Miriam Webster dictionary says to give a new and typically exalted or spiritual appearance to excuse me transform outwardly and usually for the better Strong's g339 is metamorph foe I'm probably not saying that right but that's what it looks like and it's to transform literally or figuratively metamorphose and that is changing transforming and we know that we live in a world right now where we have a tremendous movement afoot in the world for people wanting to transform their bodies they want to transform their genders some people don't even want to change their bodies they just want to change their genders they want to transform into whatever they feel fits in the moment I'm not going to dwell on this too much but I think it's very important because it's a relevant topic to the day in which we live because it's an impersonation of the truth there is going to be a transformation of bodies on this Earth and it's going to be according to the word of God in the moment in the twinkling of an eye there is going to be a brand new body that we step into brothers and sisters and there's a reason why these people are doing this they don't understand it but they're doing it anyways it's because of the anointing on the age and it's no wonder that they're talking we talked about this as well there's no wonder that they have this idea that they need to be called I or or we and them and they the the pronouns the the personal pronouns are plural personal pronouns they're not singular pronouns and if you just you know bear with me as I go over this remember that we're talking about it is I it's not we and it's not they it's I and we know that when Moses he was looking at the burning bush he said I'm going to read the scripture a little bit later but he said who should I say sent me who is it that I'm talking to and he told them I'm the god of of your fathers of of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and and and he said yeah that's that's who I am but I want you to tell them not that I'm the god of them I want you to tell them that I am sent you not we or they or I was or I will be but I am the present tense singular personal pronoun and I think that's just an exact duplication here we are dealing with another counterfeit it's not just the trans movement it's the ideology of a plurality of spirits and it's okay to say that we have a multiplicity of personalities in people why do they want to be called we and they why is that what has that got to do with a single person it's so they can hide they can maybe just be whatever they want to be there's more than one there right we talked about this last week if we don't actually get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters we've got one of two options get the Holy Ghost in our lives and be sealed wasn't that such a good description brother Mervin so beautiful on Wednesday to be filled and sealed means he took for those people weren't here he took and did it a couple times I thought for sure that he had break the can he took cans of pop one empty that was empty used and he stepped on it and it just crashed immediately aluminum can just munch but he took a full one that was filled and sealed and he stood on it and raised up on it see how strong it is when you're full and and sealed if we're not filled with the Holy Ghost and sealed brothers and sisters we're going to be crushed under the weight of this world under the plurality of the spirits that want to change our pronouns or or the gender of of our bodies but it's because we're dealing with the plurality of spirits and we talked about this out of Matthew chapter 12 verse 43 when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walked a few dry places seeking rest and findeth none you know many many times until we come to that place of recognizing that we're Justified Sanctified and and take that that pause that rest where we need to just wait until we know that the the the the disciples they were instructed by Jesus to go and tarry and wait in Jerusalem until you're endured with power from on high we have got to do the very same thing we have to have our own Opera room experience but there Comes A Time In Our Lives before that where we have to be justified we have to recognize that he has Justified us and that gives us the ability to be Sanctified but the brown talks about it like a a glass in a chicken yard and how a glass can be just left maybe a coffee mug or a clear glass can be just left in a chicken yard with all the manure and the dirt and the worms and the food bits and the the justification is recognizing that that that cup belongs to me and and taking that cup and picking it up and saying I own this cup this cup is mine and nobody can do anything with it but it still needs to be cleaned and then it's the sanctification or the sanitization is the way that I remembered it sometimes you'll maybe run it under hot water maybe you'll put it through a Boiling Pot maybe you'll put it into a fire depending on what kind of a cup it is but it gets cleaned out and it gets sterilized that's the sanctification but what good is it if it doesn't get filled it's got to be filled sometimes in that process of sanctification there's things that have to go right and when we're dealing with human beings sometimes those things that gotta go are spirits and I'll say this brothers and sisters myself I'm a living witness I had spirits that had to go some people would say oh that's not not possible but it is possible I'll tell you I battled with spirits and you know brothers and sisters even as Believers in the word of God once you get the Holy Ghost we know this you're you're not exempt from trials and the trials that we get are spirits they're going to come around they're Devils they're tormentors to torment us to shake us down to prove who we are but sometimes we've got to be Sanctified we got to get those Spirits out and once they're out you got to get sealed and if you don't get sealed here we have this scripture here Matthew 12 when an unclean Spirit has gone out of a man you walk a few dry places seeking rest and findeth none the spirits get taken out then he saith the spirit then he saith I will return into my house from Once I came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished it's a it's a perfectly furnished flat it's all ready to go with all of his favorite things all of his favorite foods maybe everything that he enjoys it's a place of rest for him to enter into that body once again if you don't have a seal upon that door and we know that there was a type given in to the children of Israel and and I think it's the book of Exodus and that was the the Passover Lamb they had to take and and apply that blood to the the lintel and the doorpost and unless they did that the death angel would pass over and they would actually see a death the firstborn would die but the spirit then he saith I will return into my house from Once I came out and when he has come out he findeth it empty swept and garnished then go with he and taketh with him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself hey boys we've got a we've got a party place let's get together and party and that's what happens if we're not careful then go with he and taketh with him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself they enter in and dwell there and the last state of the man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation and we know that we we talked about Mark chapter five I gotta stop laboring on this and and get going because we want to we want to go forwards here we don't want to just go backwards but Mark chapter five we know the story of Legion Jesus speaking and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is Legion for we are many we talked about this that it's a it's a Roman regiment and and typically the size was anywhere from 40 4500 to 5500 soldiers forty five hundred to fifty five hundred I would just I can't get over this to think I I don't know if I could contend with one devil knowing what I've experienced in my life and I'll say it with smoking or with alcohol those are devils and they were more than I could control could you imagine having a hundred or a thousand or five thousand no wonder this man couldn't be contained they couldn't contain Legion they couldn't bind them they put Fetters on him chains they couldn't bind him he wouldn't live with other human beings he lived like an animal in the caves but you know what it's a plurality of spirits and that's what causes people to behave the way they do you know I I remember hearing it years ago that once upon a time we we saw it in Kenya too I remember brother Gilbert pointing it out on the street when we're driving he said see that that's a Madman right there and he was disheveled he had raggedy clothes and his hair was crazy and you could tell he was just walking around and you know you don't have to look very far in the news now and you see people doing that now you see people doing that now and of course they're trying to hang it on the administration and all this stuff but I couldn't believe it there's people just standing there and they're just on the street and they're just like this and they're just standing there doing that that's what they're doing there's other people they're bent right over just like this just completely just that that's what they're doing that's their life they're just there I I don't know it's a plurality of spirits they're mad men but you know we can see the obvious ones the ones that are tricky are the ones that put on a two or three piece suit brothers and sisters and go and function in this world because that's what happens without the Seal of the Holy Ghost in our lives but there's no wonder we have this plurality of pronouns and in Modern English I looked it up and and I'll just read it again the personal pronoun pronouns officially include IU he she it we and then it goes into they them us him her his hers it's theirs are and your that's the world we live in but that's not the believer's position in Christ the believer's position in Christ has a perspective through the word and that perspective is to be not afraid of all of this even though we see perplexing times we see troubling times all around Be not Afraid even though the storm is happening Be not Afraid even though we see spirits all around us be not afraid because it is I when we read this word of God when we hear the message of the hour we don't need to be afraid brothers and sisters we don't have to worry about it I talked about this out of Exodus chapter 3 when now when Moses kept the flock of Jethro as father in the law father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why this bush is not burned and we know brother Adam says very clearly that was a pillar of fire in that bush he met that Pillar of Fire and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses and he said here am I I think it's just interesting I want to pause and dwell on this not us here we are it was just Moses right and he said draw not nigh hi hither put off thy shoes off of thy feet for the place wherein thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father and of the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hit his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are on Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows he's not saying we and they and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites the Hittites the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites verse 13 and Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and what and and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them he didn't say Jehovah he didn't say Jesus I said this already we know it and God said unto Moses I am that I am the present tense and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you brothers and sisters this is such a beautiful type of the scripture that we read this morning out of Matthew chapter 14 when when you recognize your position in Christ when you recognize that you're in the promised land with the Holy Ghost in your life that you're Justified you're Sanctified you're filled with the Holy Ghost you are in a land that's large and that's flowing with milk and honey you're in a land that is sweet you're in a land where all of the the troubles are are over if you can stay in your land we know the children of Israel they had that promise so long as they're in their land they'll be blessed but as soon as they step out of their land God can't bless them because the promise is in the Promised Land but they they came into a land that was full it was flowing with milk and honey it was safe for them and we have been given that ability in our day to have that in our lives in our homes as families I think it's so beautiful even in our church you know we're going to be in a land though just like the Bible said where there's the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites and we're going to contend with all of those brothers and sisters but it's not going to be naturally speaking at least it hasn't been who knows what it will be in the future as these Spirits the plurality of spirits begin to manifest in in people's lives you know what's interesting if you were to go and actually say that I'm a Christian to some of these people you'll have a fight on your hands you say I don't believe that I don't believe in any of that we could happen potentially have a fight on our hands with how aggressive some of these people behave but the Believers aren't doing that the Believers aren't aggressors we're not going out looking for a fight but you know even in the midst of all of it brothers and sisters this is where I want to get to today just be not afraid be not afraid for it is I and what is I I is you when you're in the midst of the storm brothers and sisters don't worry if you believe this word of God if you've been Justified if you've been Sanctified if you know that you've tarried in Jerusalem in your Promised Land if you've waited until you got that baptism of the Holy Ghost when when you get that brothers and sisters you don't got to worry because when that storm comes around just just just be quiet quiet yourself and look around and see if you can see Jesus because he is there he is the ever present help in time of trouble Be not Afraid brothers and sisters it is I you know I I just I've been studying this I've been looking at all of the messages if you type in it is I think there's about 12 of them that come up and and it's just amazing to hear Brother brownie takes this text in the out of Matthew chapter 14 he does a few uh different scriptures but mostly out of Matthew chapter 14 and and I just really got into it is I out of 1960 it's 11 24. brother banham says oh they were all convinced it must have been about that time it got dark and Satan saw them alone without him now that's just what the devil wants is to see The Church Without Christ he says I don't care what your name is how much your name's in Gold letters we are the holy church we are this he says it's not a holy church there's no such a thing as a holy church there's no such a thing as a holy mountain holy relics or even holy people he says it's the holy ghost in the people that makes the holy part and that's the Holy Spirit and outside of that brothers and sisters I would say this as a Believer outside of Heaven the Holy Ghost if we resist the Holy Ghost there's people see there's people that are on their journey I want to be real clear today as I talk about this there's people that are on their Journey they're in that justification they're in the sanctification stage and and they're tearing they're waiting for that gift of the Holy Ghost and and that's happening that's the promise God will do it in his time and you just need to stay firm stay in your position don't get get weary and well doing don't don't worry about trying to make it happen don't worry that it's not gonna happen just sit still and just let God do the work but then there's people that will go all the way up to sanctification and they'll resist the Holy Ghost in their lives and they will not go all the way and you know I want to say this clearly and and I'm just going to say it I think that's the most miserable place a human being could live is to get to the place where they're just about to receive the Holy Ghost but they resist it they won't go all the way and we've talked about it many times because there's a door and a door and they can go all the way up to that place but they've got one thing in their life that they just won't open that door to maybe it's a hurt maybe it's a fear maybe it's a resentment maybe someone's done something to them but you know what we don't have the option we've got to go all that way and just open all the doors Be not Afraid brothers and sisters it is I and if we can just allow that door to open he'll come in and sup with us we've got to be willing to do the work on our part but you know to be that Christian that goes all the way up right to the end and just won't take that step over the threshold just won't go beyond that's got to be the most miserable place to be how can you function in life because you're always going to be looking over your shoulder you're always going to know that you're you haven't gone all the way and it's only between you and God it's not between anybody else nobody will even know it you know just made me think when when I was looking up this quote how we can think that we have Jesus in our lives and not have them Mary and Joseph they thought they had Jesus with them didn't they and remember it was when that time happened that they went back three days journey so they actually lost six days and it was in that moment that Mary actually denied her own testimony where she said where you been your father and I have been worried about you and he said sitting in the temple where he's supposed to be don't you know woman that I'm about my father's business we can actually leave Jesus behind brothers and sisters and and not even know it brother Brandon preaches that and knoweth it not but you know what I just I don't want to say that we're doing that I just want to say Be not Afraid because it's I if we can just recognize Jesus and invite him inside our boat according to our story today we know that there's another story that the winds were boisterous and Jesus was in the boat he was already in the boat he was in the back of the boat and Satan saw that that they were all together and this time he was ringing his hands thinking hooray I can go and toss this boat and get rid of all of them all of my troublemakers all in one go but they got all upset and they didn't recognize who was in the back of the boat but then they finally cried out and woke him up if they would have just recognized you know what this storm has nothing to do with us because you don't know who's here this is the guy who created this world he created the wind he created the water he created this universe and unless he goes down we don't go down be not afraid it is I but they brought him in this message he says it is not the Acts of the Apostles these are maybe some quotes that we're very familiar with but I think it's just really important to have the conversation once in a while just to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance brother Bradham says oh say oh he's a holy man he's not a holy man it's the holy ghost in the man I always kind of differed with the saying the Acts of the Apostles that isn't the Acts of the Apostles he says they were men it was Acts of the holy spirit in the apostles that brought forth the great victory wasn't the Acts of the Apostles I think it's so good to recognize this brothers and sisters if we've got anything good in our lives it's not the acts of brother Berry it's not the acts of brother or sister it's the acts of the Holy Ghost in US isn't it and isn't it wonderful just to give him the acknowledgment just to give him the credit just to say thank you Daddy thank you Lord that's all a parent ever really wants parents you know when they lend children money I probably shouldn't say this but typically parents will lend children money and you know they're really not too fussed about the money they want the child to learn the lesson but in the end of the day they just want to hear thank you they just want to have thanksgiven to them how much more the heavenly father that gives us everything brother Branham goes on to say here and when Satan's seen the little Church Without Christ then he said this is my opportunity and I'm sure we've all witnessed it before when things get a little upset in the church that's when Satan says oh there's my opportunity that's when I'm going to get in there that's what I'm going to try and mess things up you know we have that poster at the back brothers and sisters if you haven't seen it it's out of Christ is the mystery of God revealed don't don't think that we're all going to be one big happy Bunch all the time it's not a fairy tale here we're wrestling against flesh not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and that that word to the church it says that we need to draw closer together now more than ever we don't want to get clannished we don't want to have this group and that group and the other group inside the group as soon as we start to do that then Satan's going to get in there and start mixing things up and you know he even says in there that he'll send someone to come and sit down in the group maybe for years they'll sit down in the group and they will be a conduit for the devil to come in and inject some poison into that group of people and what will happen then they'll either get upset and leave or they'll get together with the body of Jesus Christ but the only thing that we can do as a body of Believers is draw that much closer together and when people want to step back and draw away we want to draw the circle bigger Spirit of Christ is to draw the circle bigger not to draw the circle smaller not to say no you don't believe it the way I believe it then you know you're probably going to find a better church somewhere else no we want to see our brothers and our sisters Fellowship but Satan's just looking for that window of opportunity he's looking for that moment when Satan's seen that little Church Without Christ then he said that's my opportunity this is the time when I'll teach them how to blaspheme me and and he began to blow with his breath a storm down on the sea and the little boat was just about to sink perhaps in Galilee there the waves was so heavy they went almost to the bottom and perhaps on every gleaming wave and every lightning time that flashed the devil would laugh out there and say I got them now because they've gone away without him brothers and sisters if we've ever gone away without him then I want to say this be afraid be afraid but if you've got Jesus if you recognize him in your life in your your family in your home if you're putting him first before all of our decisions be not afraid because it is I and we know I and my father are one that's where we're getting to with all of this that's our position in Christ is that he and I are one and that's not putting it out there and making it something Blasphemous that's the promise for our day because if we have his spirit in us then who are we going to be brother Bradham says if you've got the spirit of Dillinger what are you going to do you're going to be a gangster right if you've got the spirit of Mozart in you you're going to compose if you've got the spirit of Christ in you then you're going to be the word that's all I just love the story story of them being in the ship and uh and the visual that brother Branham brings when he talks about this stuff how he how he gives it a bit of drama and you know I just really love the service on on Wednesday there was so many good points and brother Mervin he brought he brought some things that I just want to mention three things that I I think are well worth mentioning and I probably will continue to do that and even if I just meditate myself on them but just for today it's for free thank you brother Mervin he said you know what if we ask for wisdom we're going to get problems to solve God's going to give us problems he'll answer our prayers but it's not going to be just a a cloud floating down with all of the wisdom and and all the intelligence in the universe that's going to come to us it's not going to be like that he's going to give us problems to solve so that we can learn from those problems and how we solve them and and really how we don't solve them how he solves them how we need to surrender ourselves just like the ministry and allow Christ to come and solve the problems in our lives if we ask for wisdom he's going to give us problems so if he does just Rejoice because those trials are more precious to us than than gold than pure gold and if we ask for courage he's going to give us trials it's not just going to be a flowery bed of ease if we ask for love this one took the cake for me my goodness if we ask for love how many remembers this if we ask for love God will give us troublemakers we're going to have problems with people because we're going to have to learn how to love prickly ones those ones that just want to find a fault with everything that's going on and that's just their Essence that's the way it is but if we ask for love God's going to give us troublemakers I thought that was so incredible because it's true it's so simple but you know what we said it earlier we're just going to draw the circle bigger brothers and sisters we're not going to draw it tighter and smaller that's not the spirit of Christ nope and if people just get upset because they want to they they want to have that sort of thing go on then what what can we do we love our brothers and we love our sisters but we love the word more we love the word most and when we have the word we love one another because the word said how will the world know that you love me not that you have all the quotes and you have all the notes and you've got all the history and the message of the hour no there's no Apostolic succession brother Branham says because their parents are in God doesn't have any grandchildren no he only has children Sons and Daughters of God that's all and the only way we're getting in is to go and have that Upper Room experience on our own my if we ask for love God will give it to us but we're going to have to deal with prickly people and I just say you know brothers and sisters I'm not saying this to to say if you're going to ask God for something you need to be afraid I want to say this if you want to ask God for something then ask big I ask bold ask God to give you all that you need to equip you for the journey because he will you know if we have to deal with prickly people maybe he'll give us a body suit he'll give us some big thick welding gloves that will be able to just grab the cactus person and hug them and not get prickles in us that hurt us maybe they'll stick to our our gloves and our our suit but they won't get in our skin they won't hurt us if we need wisdom he'll give us problems but he'll give us the ability to solve those problems brothers and sisters I'm not saying this to scare us I'm just saying that God will give us everything we need but the only way we're going to get it is to come his way you know I thought this one part of the story here Jesus what did he do after he fed the multitude I just find this really interesting and maybe it's just me it's a simple thing but did you catch the part that Jesus sent the people away he actually said it's over now show's over time to go home there's nothing to see here he constrained the people to leave and once he did that he got the disciples to get in the boat and send them across the way and brother Branham says you know in this message that somebody found fault with that to say that Jesus sent them away they left though why did they go brother Adam says I I said something about that one time and someone corrected me afterwards said but brother Branham he constrained them to go away without them I said yes but they done wrong by doing so can you imagine that the disciples done wrong by doing so here we have a prophet of God how does this how does this line up it's kind of like this it doesn't really it's not really congruent but if you take a step backwards and you listen to what the prophet says it really does because he goes on and he says I said yes but they done wrong by doing so when Elijah and Elijah was a type Christ to the church he goes into this story you remember the story of Elijah and Elisha Elijah says to Elisha what could I do for you you know what what would you like and he says I want a double portion of what you got buddy I I want some of that Holy Ghost in me I want that Spirit to be in me but I want a double portion of it and he says oh man you ask a hard thing how can I ever do that but alas you know what if you see me when I go you can have what you want right and now we have brother Brad I'm saying this is a type of Christ in the church this is the Bride of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ and he said you know if you see me when I go that's fine you can have it and then along the way afterwards he says to him he's the trainer he's the master he's the instructor how about you just wait for me here he said it three times I think it is just stay here and wait for me here I got another thing I gotta go and do over here and he said no uh-uh you're not getting out of my sight I'm not letting you go one second out of my sight I am going all the way with you because I am going to see you go when that promise comes to pass because why I believe that that promise is coming to pass and needs to be the same way for the Church of the Living God we need to make sure that we keep our eyes on Christ we don't want to get any distractions brothers and sisters don't get fussed with people don't worry about the situations and the troubles and and most of all brothers and sisters don't don't look at me don't look at men don't look at Ministry don't don't look at at pet doctrines look at the message of the hour look at the word of God for our day and get caught up in that atmosphere in that spirit and then when that promise comes to pass when your body is about to change you'll get that double portion of the promise for you in your life brother Adam says when Elijah and Elisha which is a type Christ and the church Elisha taking a double portion of the spirit these things that I do shall you do and greater than this shall you do when the cloak that was on him the Holy Spirit was on him falls upon the church I got studying this one time brothers and sisters and I don't know maybe you can call me crazy it's fine I am I know it but I I don't know if I was in a dream or if I was awake or if it was a vision I don't know I'm not a super spiritual guy I I don't know but I had a moment in time in my life sometimes we have these Impressions and and they just strike us so deeply and they're so vivid what I saw was a vision of Elijah going up and I don't know maybe I was just listening to a message and I fell into a dream it could be that simple but it was just so vivid to me Elijah went up and his mantle came down but his mantle wasn't a mantle in in my little vision or whatever you want to call it what it was was a message book it was the message of the hour that was the mantle that fell down when Elijah went up and you know what brothers and sisters I stepped back and I thought my goodness I talked to a brother about this one time and he says oh no we're not going to go and get into Elijah's mantles now there is a Doctrine about mantles and I'm not going to do that I'm not trying to do that what I am trying to say though is that we have been given that double portion already brothers and sisters if we take this message of the hour and accept it this way we just have the prophet of God say that it is a type of Christ and the church what would be that mantle a prayer cloth from Jeffersonville Indiana is that going to take us into the body change brothers and sisters an artifact from Brother Branham that's not going to change our bodies the only thing that's going to change our bodies is the message of the hour that brother Branham brought to us the Fulfillment of his purpose to be Malachi 4. but I just think it's beautiful he says Elisha taking a double portion of that Spirit these things that I do shall you do and greater than this shall you do and we know that is greater we talked about this again brother Mervin he taught me this you know Jesus he broke the bread from bread didn't he and he broke the fish from the fish it was just a regular Wednesday night service but so you know what it happens brothers and sisters it becomes yours it's your Revelation from God it's your free gift from God and it comes to the five-fold ministry but here we have brother brother Mervin explaining this exactly like brother Bradham says you can look it up God he created fish from Fish and bread from bread Jesus did that when he was here but what did Brother Branham do with the squirrels where did those come from that's more than just bread from bread and fish from Fish greater than these shall you do he says when the cloak that was on him the Holy Spirit was on him falls upon the church because he was just one man church is universal More Than This shall you do for I go to the father and Elisha knowed more about that being a prophet than the church does today okay Elijah Elijah said when there was a gathering said you stay here the Lord's called me Yonder I'm going up to the school of the prophets but Elisha like the church ought to be today as the Lord God lives I'm not going to leave you for he had an objective in his mind and his motives was certainly right you know brother Branham I'm going to jump ahead of myself here I'm just going to say it brother Bradham says if you've got the right mental attitude towards God's promises in his word then you can have what you ask but you got to have the right mental attitude and the only way you're going to have the right mental attitude is to have the right thinking when those thoughts come into your mind like brother Toby preached my goodness it's just beautiful it's so true though if we don't have the right thinking that right thinking has to be according to the word according to the word for our day we could have thinking that says we need to go up and build an ark and we can put on sunscreen so we won't get sunstroke like that guy did the one time right he got sun stroke and was up there beating on the hill even when they could prove there wasn't rain we could go down that road but that's not going to save us today because all that wood and Pitch that's going into that wood is going to burn the promise for our day is a baptism by fire it's not going to be a flood of water all right I'm not going to leave you for he had an objective in his mind and his motives was certainly right and we know that he was given a double portion he did exactly the double amount of Miracles and I don't know them offhand someone probably does but you know one of them that really speaks to me I just think is so wonderful how the the I think it was the prophets were with Elisha was with the prophets and they are working and they were trying to get some stuff done they were gonna I think get some victuals going on and they were cutting wood by the river remember this story and one of the one of the servants he he said alas Master oh I'm in big trouble I don't have much money but uh the ax that I was using the head came off of it the iron ax head came off and it landed in the water and now it's at the bottom of this stream and I borrowed this and I can't give it back I don't have any money to pay for it what am I gonna do I'm here helping you trying with all my heart and he says oh where did it go and he says well it was in that general area and he goes over there and what happens the prophet of God made that iron swim and you know it goes beyond iron swimming brothers and sisters what the word of God says what it is is a control a change of the molecular composition of the universe something changed the time space continuum for something to completely go against gravity how could iron swim the prophet of God right there and you know brothers and sisters if you believe this message of the hour and you have that mantle in you the Holy Ghost the prophet of God just said don't be afraid because it is I when you face the troubles when the storms come around don't be afraid it is I Satan's gonna say oh now I got you you're away from the church you're away from all your brothers and sisters you're away from that that really good feeling that you get in a service when we're having a really good service now you're on your own now I got you now I can get you where I want you nope just say be not afraid because Jesus is right here Jesus is here I don't know if anybody remembers the story about sister Jermaine powerful story powerful story I I don't say it to credit anything but I just say this don't ever blaspheme the Holy Ghost don't ever blaspheme the Holy Ghost sister she had problems in her body and she was before a surgeon and the surgeon said I could have this wrong but my understanding is the surgeon said to her you're gonna you're gonna have to deal with this and there's nothing you can do about it and she said oh no I don't accept that and he said what do you mean you don't accept that she said Jesus is here and the surgeon said to her what are you talking about woman it's just you and me in this office Jesus isn't here that's that's I don't know if you said that's crazy but he just dismissed it like like she was crazy and and she said no no no no no but he just completely dismissed her like she was not well in the head and I'm not sure how it went physically for her afterwards but I know if I understand correctly how it went for him physically afterwards I I understand that he had an accident afterwards after he blasphemed the Holy Ghost because she was not talking about herself she was talking about the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ himself don't ever blaspheme the Holy Ghost we can do a lot of things in this world Jesus said I'll forgive you for it when he was here when God was standing here on flesh he said you know what I'll forgive you for that now but boy oh boy when the Holy Ghost comes if you do it if you say one word against this this Holy Ghost one word will not be forgiven you know that made me shudder to my bones because I actually came in and I started to believe this message and started to get Justified and Sanctified and was looking for the promise of being filled with the Holy Ghost myself and and I remember taking the lord's name in vain to my shame brothers and sisters I'm not saying that for any glory and I thought it was it was really heavy hearted for me to the point where I was ready to turn around and walk back out that door and say I'm no good I know I know I can't be saved because I've already gone too far but thanks be to God for a prophet that would say there's only one unpardonable sin and that's the blaspheme the Holy Ghost is not to take the lord's name in vain I'm not saying go do it but I'm saying if you've done it it's not unpardonable if you come and ask the Lord to forgive you if you acknowledge that brother Branham he says what the church needs today he says that's what the church has got to do today no matter what comes or goes hold on to him I love how he says this because we can get caught up in the church and say oh there's this and oh there's that and this should be this way and that should be the other way and I thought it was supposed to be something else as soon as we start doing that brothers and sisters what we're doing is we're putting a stop we're putting a period behind the Lord behind the word of God in our midst brother Adam says that's what the church has got to do today no matter what comes or goes hold on to him if the church cools off no matter what takes place hold on to God's unchanging hand get a hold of calvary and stay there that's the way to get something from God hold to it he says Don't Let The Devil shake you away don't let the devil Shake You Down he's coming to Shake You Down and God will allow him to Shake You Down God will allow it to happen brother Bonham uses that illustration very clearly about the the train company and how they pack up the the train cars and if they're not packed correctly when the inspector comes around he'll give them a shake to see if they're packed correctly and when he shakes them if they rattle around he'll say you know what that's good everything is in there but it just needs to be packed better so I'll come back around a little while give you some time to just repack that car and that's the same with our lives we've got to make sure that everything is packed incorrectly that we have the word of God packed into our lives the correct Manner and when we do he'll come around the devil will shake us down he'll use the devil as a tool to shake us down to prove that we've got that seal and I just I can't get over that example that we got can you imagine that brothers and sisters us being just a soda can and the devil having permission to just come and step right on top of our head and just stand with one foot right on top of our head and when we're filled and sealed can't touch us nothing happens that weight just gets totally transferred down to the floor and the floor is what gets damaged but it doesn't hurt us but boy if we're not filled and sealed what happens if we've got a little tiny pinhole in there if it's just some other way if it's some other thing if it's some other filling then what's going to happen is he's going to step on it and it's just going to squish out we could be filled and not sealed right brothers and sisters what would happen if we were filled and not sealed with a soda can here on stage I kind of thought that might happen I was cringing I was thinking oh no we're going to get Coke all over the piano and the pulpit no but what happened nothing happened because he was sealed and filled but if it's just filled and not sealed it's going to spray everywhere got to get sealed brothers and sisters gotta get filled and I want to say this I think it's beautiful I'm not trying to intellectualize it and make it something weird it's not a buried doctor and don't don't think it is when you get filled you get sealed the filling is the ceiling it's not a different thing and and I think brother Mervin I think did you talk about it how yeah you did you did I won't go too far into it the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Spirit they're the same thing they're the same the filling and the ceiling is the same thing brothers and sisters it's not a pet Doctrine where we can say now once you've accomplished these tasks now you can move on to the next part and you get a badge and you can move into a different section of the church and you'll be able to get a different anointing of the Holy Ghost you know that's not the way it works not not in the Church of the Living God if you believe then just be Not Afraid brothers and sisters just receive that filling of the Holy Ghost just allow it to happen to you because when it does Satan won't be able to touch you the Gates of Hell won't be able to Prevail against that Revelation that comes into your heart when you know that you know that you know when you get to that place ain't nothing going to touch you and when we get the problems in our lives we just want to thank the Lord for them because they're only there to perfect us they're only there so that God can bring out his glory in our lives I say Lord help me give give me a trepidatiously give me courage because I know when you give me courage you're going to give me trials give me wisdom how to deal with those trials and I know that that's going to give me problems but you know what it's it's nothing is going to conquer me if I've got the holy ghost in my life so whatever the Lord wants done that's what's going to happen he's the one that's in control don't let the devil shake you away though brothers and sisters stay in our position if we can just stay in our position our position is to be seated in his throne with him to have him inside of us supping with us be not afraid it is I brother goes on to say in his message like Ruth to Naomi the moabite that your people be mine where you die I'll die where you're buried I'll bury where your God is that'll be my God I'm going to stay with you he says that's the way she won Boaz that's the way the church wins Christ when we're willing to sell out all of our our theories all of our things I said it before and I'll just say it I want to make sure that I'm clear about this I I'm really starting to explore this I heard something that I've probably heard many times but I've never it's never really resounded with me and I caught it and what brother Branham says is pet Doctrine and you don't have to look very far to see pet doctrines all over the place and and it's interesting because unless we're willing to let go of our pet doctrines brothers and sisters we're not going to be able to follow Jesus Christ we're not going to be able to go all the way with him because our pet doctrines are going to hold us back but when we're willing to let go of all of those pet doctrines all of those theories and ideas and traditions and teachings that's the way we win Christ when we sell out to him when we show him that there's nothing that we're willing to hold on to there's no grudge there's no anger there's no fear there's no frustration there's no problems there's no trials there's no situations that I'm going to esteem greater than my ability to hold on to that word and follow that word but sometimes we can do that we can hold on to things and they will hinder us from being able to go on let your people be my where you die I'll die were you buried I'll bury where your God is that'll be my God I'm going to stay with you that's the way she won Boaz that's the way the church wins Christ regardless of what the world's got to say ing you've went on went off on the deep end you've done this that or the other stay with Christ hold on to him stay with it you know brothers and sisters the world will say it they will say you've gone off the deep end you you're you've gone into a cult you've gone into some weird thing but I just want to say be not afraid because it is I Be not Afraid Brothers and Sisters of the message of the hour there's folks that maybe will be I heard somebody say recently that brother Branham was a criminal and I just couldn't believe that when I heard that it just broke my heart to think that people would actually say that go into that why would people say that what what's the matter and I know what it is it's Mark chapter six when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately he talked with them and said unto them be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and he went up into them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were so amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered could you imagine that just being in the midst of a storm and seeing Jesus walking on the water and and seeing him come and supposing it was a spirit and being afraid of being swamped by the storm and the boat you're going to drown and die and then to see a spirit and then realize it's not a spirit it's your friend it's the master it's the rabbi it's the teacher and for him to get in the boat and there they find themselves and he went up in on onto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were so amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered for they considered not the miracle of the loaves what just happened remember the story that we talked about right at the very beginning the feeding of the five thousand just the men not including the women and the children how many people were there there the feeding of the five thousand and the 12 baskets that were left over that they collected afterwards they considered not the miracle of the loaves why didn't they brothers and sisters because their heart was hardened and we know that the last days those people who scoff at the word those people who only go so far where it's a so far gospel their hearts will be hardened their hearts will be hardened and you know we talked about it last week I believe it was or maybe it was a week before it was a little while ago that it says in the word of God that he will send a delusion not just a delusion he'll send a strong delusion people's way and another place in the Bible I think it's in Isaiah or Zechariah forgive me he says that I will give them a delusion of my choosing not just anything it's going to be what he chooses to give them as a delusion it's no wonder people have all these different thoughts and ideas going on right now but why does it happen it's because their hearts are hardened people's hearts are hardened we know the word of God says that because of iniquity the love of many shall wax cold and that's a tough thing all we need to do is do what we know we need to do and to stop doing what we know we need to stop doing and just allow our hearts to remain tender before the Lord let's turn over to Luke Chapter 24. we still have a couple minutes here that's okay Luke chapter 24 thank you everyone for the specials today so beautiful the the poetry and the songs it all sets an atmosphere it all goes together everyone adding their their sacred portion to the service because the service is not just the preaching of the word it's everybody coming with a desire in their hearts Luke 24 we'll start reading with verse 32 of Luke chapter 24. picking up sort of at the tail end of the of the the story that we talked about the two on the road to Emmaus verse 31 is and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight sort of the end of that story there but then it goes into another story here verse 32 and they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us well they talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures and they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found 11 gathered together with them that were sorry found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord has risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in Breaking of bread and as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you isn't it a beautiful thing what his immediate introduction is his immediate greeting is be not afraid it is I peace be to you peace be unto you don't don't don't be afraid I'm not coming to destroy you I'm coming to love you I'm coming to encourage you but what is human nature brothers and sisters the human nature is verse 37 but they were terrified and afraided and supposed they had seen a spirit what it's the same narrative as in the boat they're afraided that they've seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts haven't you this is me speaking haven't you got thinking now don't you think according to the words that I've instructed you so that when those thoughts come you don't let them arise in your heart you take them into captivity and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as ye see me have and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye hear any meat let me show you something else and he gave them they gave him a piece of broiled fish and then honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me verse 45 is really where I want to get to brothers and sisters I don't want to dwell on the fact that they were afraided and there was a spirit verse 45 and then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures that's where we need to get brothers and sisters is to have him to recognize him in our midst that he is here and it takes him to open our understanding to the scriptures but when that happens we're not going to be afraid we're not going to be afraided and feared because we see people that we have known in the past we're going to say Amen that time is here the Rapture is upon us brothers and sisters we're now witnessing the tale end of this the Capstone the culmination of what everyone talked about through all the centuries someone has to be that person on Earth to be a living witness of it isn't it amazing that there were people that Jesus chose to actually show himself to he he chose to bring himself to and let them handle him and say handle me don't you see the the holes in my hands and in my feet the wounds that I took For All Mankind just give me some meat give me some bread give me something because this is Flesh and Bones brothers and sisters but it's a new glorified body and that's what's waiting for you just in a moment in the twinkling of an eye but it takes him to come around that he would open our understanding to the scriptures but verse 37 the natural tendency of a human being is they were terrified and afraighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit but remember brothers and sisters his first words are peace be unto you remember that God is not the author of confusion when we start to see the storm turning up and boiling over all around us excuse me don't worry because he is not looking to see us destroyed he might want to shake us down a little bit sometimes we just need a little distraction in our lives don't we sometimes we can get just focused on one thing and we can just start focusing on that one thing and just get a little too focused on that one thing whether it's a problem whether it's a hobby whether it's an interest whatever it is and what will God do he'll give us that little shake that that that little test that little thing that we need to just distract us from that to smarten us up and bring us right to the center of the road again but we all need it we all need correction and if we can't receive correction then we know what we are actually we don't you know Hebrews 13 8 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever doesn't it he doesn't change so brothers and sisters I want to say Be not Afraid it is I when the storms of life come up in our lives don't don't don't worry don't be afraid be not afraid it is I and and and peace be unto you that is his desire for us Be not Afraid peace be unto you Hebrews 13 8 Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'll call the musicians but you know out of this message it is I 1960 brother Branham says he cannot be a god of Miracles one day and not a god of miracles in the next day for the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still God and if you take the right mental attitude towards any promise when you read it in the Bible it's the truth no matter how many tries to put it on another age how many times people will say yeah you know that's coming in the future because sometimes we can do that we can say yeah it's coming in the future the Rapture is coming in the future I want to say this brothers and sisters the raptures right now this is a part of the Rapture if we could look at our lives and recognize that we're living out a part of the Rapture of the Church of the Living God the present tense I am is not going to be he he's not going to be the I will be or he's not the I was he's the I am and I want to say it again and again and again Be not Afraid peace be unto you it is I Be not Afraid brothers and sisters it is I we don't have anything to fear if we're putting him first in our lives when you read it in the Bible it's the truth no matter how many tries to put it on another age it's in the past or an age that's in the future he never did declare he was the I was he's the I am always maybe stand with me this morning as we close you know I'll just read one more scripture verse 49 of Luke chapter 24. and and I just want to encourage every one of us look for that in your life see if you can find that in your life brothers and sisters that you know that you've been filled and you know that you've been sealed and and you have to have it you have to have it there's no way around that and you're not going to be a pop can don't get me wrong that was just an example and it was just a beautiful example but you're going to be a vessel of the Holy Ghost you're going to be a temple of the Holy Ghost and I want to say it this way even if you don't believe that you have the Holy Ghost right now but you believe the word of God you've gone through justification you've gone through sanctification you are already a temple of the Holy Ghost because God chose you before the foundation of the world in him that you should be holy and Without Blame the sin the Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ so don't let the devil come around and say oh no you don't got it just tell them yes I do you'll never live above your confession maybe oh you don't see the signs of it I don't need to because it's not about a feeling and it's not about a sign or a wonder what it's about is my ability to say Amen to the word and to believe it and to have the desire to live that word not just say I know all the quotes and I've got a bunch of notes I got all the message library that there is I've got all the recordings I've even got some unique special letters that brother Bradham hand wrote That Ain't Gonna Save Us brothers and sisters it's got to be the person of Jesus Christ filling us and sealing us but boy oh boy once we get to that place where we know that we've been filled where we know that we've been sealed brothers and sisters Satan is going to be powerless before you that's what brother Bradham was talking about he wants to creep into the framework of the Christian church and make it lukewarm formal and Powerless and make us say oh that guy's a fanatic and and look at this problem I'm over here look at that thing over there don't worry about any of that brothers and sisters keep your eyes focused on Elijah keep your eyes focused on the Lord and just watch him move on the scene if anybody has any desire for the Holy Ghost let me know send me a text message and you know what if you can't do that if you don't want to do that because you maybe feel uncomfortable about it just go on your knees and sincerely ask God and I promise you he will give you his spirit because that's the promise from him and that's the promise of this age is to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when you do brothers and sisters your desires in your life will change if you wonder when you got it in your life just look back and see when your desires changed if you want to see the the overcoming power in your life because maybe you've got things in your life that you just can't seem to get Beyond just ask for that Holy Ghost in your life brothers and sisters ask for the filling of the Holy Spirit and watch him do it and when that happens that fire the baptism of the holy spirit that Pillar of Fire comes into your life it burns out all of those old desires it takes them right out of you you don't have to worry about learning how to deal with those old things he takes them right out of you and one day you'll look back and say didn't that used to bug me wasn't that a problem in my life and then you can come to church and you can worship then you can clap your hands and jump up and down and rejoice because you know what he's done for you my goodness anybody has a desire for the Holy Ghost just ask him if you've got the Holy Ghost just rejoice let's just go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your Holy Spirit Lord thank you for the promise to this age Lord Jesus that there has to be somebody here on Earth father as the representation of your very word your spirit Lord Jesus we know that the letter killeth father oh Lord but your spirit bringeth life Lord Jesus and

there's nothing that we can hide anyways Lord but father we just ask that you would help us all to take that step forwards Lord if we haven't received the Holy Ghost that we could invite you to give it to us Lord Jesus father if there's people that have the Holy Ghost help them to just have a topping up of that oil in their lamp Lord Jesus father that we could just Lord Rejoice for what you've

glorified in every area of Our Lives Lord father forgive us for any sin in our lives if there's any shortcomings father we just ask that you would help us Lord to overcome them according to your word
