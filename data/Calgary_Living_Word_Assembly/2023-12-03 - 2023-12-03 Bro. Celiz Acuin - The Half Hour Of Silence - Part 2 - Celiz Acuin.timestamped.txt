[1:03:15] to the house of the Lord what a
[1:03:17] tremendous honor and privilege it is to
[1:03:19] gather together with each one but most
[1:03:22] of all to gather together with the Lord
[1:03:24] Jesus
[1:03:25] Christ
[1:03:27] manifest in our
[1:03:29] midst we have a few prayer requests we'd
[1:03:32] like to bring before the church this
[1:03:34] morning um but first exactly the way
[1:03:38] that I'd like to do it every single time
[1:03:40] we've got a praise
[1:03:42] report sister
[1:03:45] Stella sister Stella wants to bring a
[1:03:47] praise report and she took the time to
[1:03:50] write it out as a pray a prayer
[1:03:52] request but she would like to bring the
[1:03:55] praise report to bring Thanksgiving to
[1:03:57] the Lord for protecting everyone that
[1:03:59] traveled to attend her nephew's wedding
[1:04:01] in
[1:04:03] Nigeria and you know when we look at it
[1:04:05] from a Canadian perspective it can seem
[1:04:08] like just a natural thing we jump in the
[1:04:10] car and we go to a wedding and then we
[1:04:11] jump in the car and we drive back home
[1:04:13] and that's not a big deal maybe we'll
[1:04:15] get a flat tire and maybe we'll have a
[1:04:16] an issue but when we're talking about
[1:04:18] different countries we have a lot of
[1:04:20] different
[1:04:21] issues and clearly this is a hand of
[1:04:26] Lord she
[1:04:28] said one of the people that traveled
[1:04:31] could not be contacted for 3 days but by
[1:04:35] the grace of the god the person was
[1:04:37] eventually got to their
[1:04:40] destination and we know here if someone
[1:04:43] just disappeared for 3 days it would be
[1:04:45] a big deal it's no different
[1:04:49] there but they made it to their
[1:04:52] destination his angel are encamped about
[1:04:55] those who fear
[1:04:56] Him in appreciation of all that God did
[1:05:00] sister Stella took the time and she
[1:05:03] brought some snacks and drinks for
[1:05:05] everyone this is a big deal for sister
[1:05:07] Stella I thought maybe when I read this
[1:05:09] there' be some crackers and maybe a
[1:05:11] little bit of something there but when
[1:05:13] you go downstairs into the kitchen after
[1:05:15] service if you leave here hungry it's
[1:05:17] your own
[1:05:19] fault sister Stella brought a
[1:05:22] feast praise the Lord
[1:05:32] you know I just can't help but think
[1:05:34] this is probably one of those unspoken
[1:05:36] requests that sister Stella brings
[1:05:38] Faithfully every single prayer meeting
[1:05:41] and that's not when Sunday or Wednesday
[1:05:43] it's on the Thursday that we actually
[1:05:44] have prayer meetings sister Stella has
[1:05:47] uh uh a regular attendance there we know
[1:05:50] that God answers
[1:05:51] prayer thank the Lord for touching
[1:05:53] brother Jeff pagee this morning he had a
[1:05:56] rough week feeling sick but his desire
[1:05:59] was to be in fellowship with the Lord
[1:06:01] this morning God bless you
[1:06:07] brother you know many times when we
[1:06:09] don't feel like it in our flesh that's
[1:06:11] the time to do it Satan wants us not to
[1:06:14] worship to say it's not the way that I'm
[1:06:17] used to so I can't do it that way you
[1:06:19] know what that's when God wants you to
[1:06:22] worship sister Mary Janette has a

[1:19:35] presence your ties and offering not
[1:19:38] because not because God needs or wants
[1:19:41] our
[1:19:43] money but if you read in the
[1:19:47] Bible Tidings and offerings are part of
[1:19:51] worship
[1:19:53] it's part of
[1:19:55] worship God said in the Old Testament do
[1:19:58] not appear before me empty
[1:20:01] handed
[1:20:03] amen that's what the word of God
[1:20:06] said not because God needs money or he
[1:20:09] wants money
[1:20:10] but he wants to see what's in us right
[1:20:16] titing was not a
[1:20:18] command remember Abraham was the one who
[1:20:22] gave ties right God did not command him
[1:20:25] to pay
[1:20:27] ties it
[1:20:29] was from the bottom of
[1:20:32] Abraham that he gave his ties he did not
[1:20:36] receive any Commandments of Lord it is
[1:20:39] by
[1:20:41] Revelation
[1:20:44] amen and tiing is Holy unto the Lord am
[1:20:48] because it is part of
[1:20:51] worship we don't don't give money to be
[1:20:53] blessed we don't give
[1:20:55] money to be blessed in
[1:20:58] return give our money as part of
[1:21:01] worship
[1:21:04] amen even if he does not give us money
[1:21:07] even if he lets us
[1:21:09] suffer it's still good for
[1:21:12] us he's teaching us not to trust in
[1:21:15] money amen but to trust in his grace and
[1:21:20] mercy but God is uh
[1:21:23] full of grace and mercy he said I will
[1:21:26] never leave you nor forsake you till the
[1:21:29] end of the world

[1:21:37] children
[1:21:38] amen we
[1:21:40] work so that they have food in the table
[1:21:43] yes sir amen amen and that's the way our
[1:21:48] God treated us more than
[1:21:51] that amen
[1:21:53] so if we just uh believe and trust him
[1:21:57] everything will be all right amen amen
[1:22:03] can you say Amen to that amen amen
[1:22:06] praise the
[1:22:07] Lord so
[1:22:09] uh this
[1:22:12] morning I would like to say
[1:22:16] that in studying the
[1:22:20] Bible in studying this holy
[1:22:24] Bible we need to
[1:22:26] realize or understand
[1:22:29] that the Holy Bible Bible was written or
[1:22:34] presented in many ways one of them is
[1:22:40] literally literally means it's easy to
[1:22:43] understand it's a command not to kill
[1:22:46] not to steal those things are literal
[1:22:49] it's easy to understand right
[1:22:54] but the Bible is not all
[1:22:58] literal the Bible is also
[1:23:02] spiritual it's
[1:23:04] also written in figure of
[1:23:08] speech like Eve ate the fruit it's not a
[1:23:13] literal right it's a figure of
[1:23:16] speech and in some parts it's written in
[1:23:21] typology like the two birds the male and
[1:23:23] the
[1:23:25] female god commanded Moses and the
[1:23:28] priest to kill the male
[1:23:32] bird and pour the blood on the
[1:23:35] female and then let the female
[1:23:38] Bird Go free it has no explanation yes
[1:23:43] but the prophet of God told us that the
[1:23:45] male bird is Jesus Christ who died at
[1:23:50] Calvary and his blood was poured upon
[1:23:53] the maale bird the church the Bride of
[1:23:55] Jesus Christ and she was set free
[1:24:02] amen then the Bible was also written
[1:24:05] symbolically like the
[1:24:08] dragons the
[1:24:10] Cal the eagle and those
[1:24:14] things they are written in
[1:24:17] symbols it's hard to understand those
[1:24:20] things and the Bible is written in
[1:24:23] Parables Jesus spoke in Parables and
[1:24:26] some of his disciples said why are you
[1:24:28] always speaking in
[1:24:30] Parables the people don't understand you
[1:24:34] and Jesus our lord said it's not for
[1:24:36] them to understand I heed it my message
[1:24:39] I heed it so that they won't understand
[1:24:42] it belongs to
[1:24:44] you amenallah
[1:24:50] and then the Bible was also read written
[1:24:53] in dark
[1:24:55] sayings it's so
[1:24:57] dark hard to
[1:25:01] understand and then it was also
[1:25:03] written in Mysteries that's why this
[1:25:07] Holy Bible is full of
[1:25:09] mysteries you can read and read and read
[1:25:13] and go to school and
[1:25:16] Seminary go to all the seminaries of the
[1:25:19] world and still you will not
[1:25:22] comprehend and understand these
[1:25:26] Mysteries because those Mysteries they
[1:25:28] are revealed only to one channel amen
[1:25:32] and that's the office of the
[1:25:34] Prophet amen and we thank
[1:25:37] God because he has sent a
[1:25:40] prophet Amen to reveal these Mysteries
[1:25:44] that are so hard to understand
[1:25:50] amen and then then the Holy Bible was
[1:25:53] also written
[1:25:55] in deep teachings they are so deep if
[1:25:59] you can only you only enjoy swimming on
[1:26:04] top of the
[1:26:06] ocean and then you don't want to go deep
[1:26:09] you will you will not see how beautiful
[1:26:12] under the
[1:26:13] ocean amen of course the ocean and the
[1:26:17] shore are
[1:26:18] beautiful it is enough for them who just
[1:26:20] want to stay there
[1:26:22] but some people they're not content on
[1:26:24] the
[1:26:25] shore they learn is scuba
[1:26:28] diving because they want to see what's
[1:26:32] under that
[1:26:33] surface the same thing with the word of
[1:26:36] God hallelujah amen amen amen there are
[1:26:40] simple things there are literal things
[1:26:43] there are shallow things but we know the
[1:26:45] Bible speaks of deep things of God
[1:26:49] too amen Deep Thoughts
[1:26:53] deep things means deep thoughts of
[1:26:57] God
[1:26:59] Amen and God wants us to go inside of
[1:27:05] what he has in his mind before the
[1:27:08] foundation of the world amenallah and
[1:27:12] those deep thoughts of
[1:27:14] God they
[1:27:16] are everything is good is thinking good
[1:27:21] for us
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:25] amen now some parts of the
[1:27:29] Bible they are not written but it
[1:27:33] doesn't mean that it's not the truth it
[1:27:36] doesn't mean that it's not part of the
[1:27:37] word of God because it's not written in
[1:27:39] the Bible amen remember Revelation 10
[1:27:43] 1:4 the message and the voices of the
[1:27:46] seven tunders the prophet of God said
[1:27:48] they're not written in the Bible that's
[1:27:50] right you can read and read and read and
[1:27:54] pray and
[1:27:55] fast it's not
[1:27:57] there amen it cannot be understood by
[1:28:00] prayer and
[1:28:02] fasting many people they pray and fast
[1:28:04] to understand the Bible but they still
[1:28:06] don't understand till
[1:28:08] nowen those Unwritten they are part of
[1:28:12] God's
[1:28:13] word amen he decided not to write them
[1:28:17] in the Bible so that's why when we speak
[1:28:21] about the word of God the truth of
[1:28:24] God there are is still truth yes though
[1:28:27] they may not be written in the Bible
[1:28:29] amen amen like the seven
[1:28:31] Thunders and Revelation
[1:28:34] 81 it's totally
[1:28:37] silent L not literal not spiritual not
[1:28:40] symbolical not typologically not in
[1:28:43] Parables not in
[1:28:45] symbols totally
[1:28:48] silent amen but
[1:28:52] at the back of that silence there is a
[1:28:56] great mystery message amen he amen for
[1:29:01] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:29:04] hallelujah everybody say praise the Lord
[1:29:06] the Lord thank you
[1:29:15] Jesus Psalms 92:
[1:29:19] 5-6 oh Lord how great
[1:29:23] are thy works and thy thoughts are very
[1:29:29] deep amen amen a bruist man know it not
[1:29:35] neither do a
[1:29:38] fool understand
[1:29:45] this second Peter
[1:29:50] 3:16 as also in all his
[1:29:53] Epistles speaking in them of those of
[1:29:57] these things in which are some things
[1:30:02] hard to be
[1:30:05] understood
[1:30:08] amen which they that are
[1:30:13] unlearned and
[1:30:15] unstable
[1:30:17] rest as they do also the other
[1:30:21] scriptures
[1:30:22] unto their own destruction see this
[1:30:25] Bible can destroy
[1:30:27] you if you don't have amen the
[1:30:31] revelation of it
[1:30:35] amen it is very
[1:30:38] dangerous to preach this Bible without
[1:30:41] Revelation it can kill you it can kill
[1:30:44] people that listens to you amen if you
[1:30:47] are not Guided by the Holy Spirit and
[1:30:51] the Revelation that God gave to his
[1:30:53] servant brother Bram the prophet you are
[1:30:56] just killing
[1:30:58] people
[1:31:00] amen you are sending more people to Hell
[1:31:02] than to
[1:31:05] Heaven that's why it's very scary
[1:31:09] brothers and sisters to stand behind
[1:31:10] this Pulpit to speak your own
[1:31:14] thoughts amen amen we have
[1:31:17] received the written word of God we have
[1:31:21] received the spoken word of God
[1:31:23] hallelujah the message of God came to
[1:31:25] the prophet and that's what we
[1:31:28] need to preach to the people hallelujah
[1:31:32] not my own thoughts amen

[1:31:39] good UC

[1:47:28] s if it was the coming of the Lord what
[1:47:32] did the prophet of God
[1:47:36] said the bridge between the seven Church
[1:47:39] ages and the Seven
[1:47:42] Seals in 63 the prophet of God said in
[1:47:45] paragraph 2
[1:47:47] 1 12 remember
[1:47:51] it comes at the seventh Church age when
[1:47:55] the mysteries of God will be opened up
[1:47:59] now watch real clothes this is something
[1:48:02] you must
[1:48:04] get
[1:48:05] now he had been doing his mediatorial
[1:48:12] work making intercessions for the
[1:48:16] believer for 2,000 years
[1:48:20] he had been back there a
[1:48:23] lamb
[1:48:25] now he is stepping
[1:48:28] forth from
[1:48:31] eternity to take that title dided book
[1:48:36] amen and to break the
[1:48:39] seals and reveal the
[1:48:42] Mysteries when of
[1:48:45] it at the end
[1:48:48] time do you get it amen yes now break
[1:48:53] the seals and release all the Mysteries
[1:48:57] to them to the seventh
[1:49:01] angel

[1:49:08] mysteries of
[1:49:09] God the mysteries of God lays in this
[1:49:14] Seven Seals amen that's what he said
[1:49:18] here all the Mysteries lays in the Seven
[1:49:27] Seals another
[1:49:29] message of the prophet of God the bridge
[1:49:32] between the seven Church ages again this
[1:49:35] is what he
[1:49:36] said the reason I'm reading all these
[1:49:39] codes because I do not want to add my
[1:49:42] own touch here it's very
[1:49:45] dangerous to add your own thoughts here
[1:49:49] see the prophet of God warn us when we
[1:49:52] preach about the seven seal not to add
[1:49:55] our own thoughts it's already
[1:49:58] there and that's the the purpose of
[1:50:01] bringing this quates together so that by
[1:50:04] the revelation of God to the prophet and
[1:50:07] to you as you listen to these Mysteries
[1:50:09] God will also reveal it while you're
[1:50:11] listening to this m all
[1:50:15] right paragraph
[1:50:19] 41
[1:50:21] and when the seals are
[1:50:22] broke and the Mystery is revealed
[1:50:26] down
[1:50:28] comes see that seven seal brothers and
[1:50:31] sisters when the seals are broke
[1:50:35] amen when were the seals were
[1:50:38] broke February 28 1963 right right is
[1:50:42] that correct when the seven angels from
[1:50:46] heaven in pyramid
[1:50:49] constellation appeared to the
[1:50:51] prophet and after appearing to the
[1:50:54] prophet they went back to heaven and
[1:50:56] formed the mystery
[1:50:58] Cloud the head of
[1:51:00] Christ is that clear brothers and
[1:51:02] sisters
[1:51:05] amen now I did not add my onos there
[1:51:08] that's what the prophet of God said
[1:51:09] there shields were broke from the seven
[1:51:14] angels in pyramid conciliation that came
[1:51:17] to brother Ram sir and broke the Seven
[1:51:20] Seals to
[1:51:22] him that was in 1963
[1:51:25] right and
[1:51:27] after that encounter what did the
[1:51:30] prophet of God said the seven angels
[1:51:33] went back as past as they go to heaven
[1:51:36] and formed the mystery Cloud that was
[1:51:39] featured in Life magazine May 17 1963
[1:51:44] brothers and
[1:51:45] sisters is that
[1:51:47] correct
[1:51:48] amen to God be the glory
[1:51:54] amen are you still here brothers and
[1:51:56] sisters thank you amen amen I'm trying
[1:52:00] to be
[1:52:02] slow see sometimes I preach
[1:52:05] fast but I'm trying to be slow because
[1:52:07] these are very
[1:52:08] important things to be understood
[1:52:10] brother and
[1:52:14] sisters thank you
[1:52:17] Jesus just as John was giving his
[1:52:20] message the same time that
[1:52:25] Messiah come in the
[1:52:28] days John knew he would see him because
[1:52:33] he was going to introduce
[1:52:37] himall and we realize that in the
[1:52:40] scriptures over in Malachi 4 there is
[1:52:44] one to be one like
[1:52:46] John an
[1:52:48] Elijah to whom whom the word of God can
[1:52:51] come to and he is to reveal by the Holy
[1:52:56] Spirit whole the mysteries of
[1:52:59] God and restore the faith to the
[1:53:04] children back to the faith of the

[1:53:11] back all these Mysteries that's been
[1:53:14] proved at amen through this
[1:53:17] denominational years
[1:53:20] now that's what the word said I'm just
[1:53:23] responsible for what it
[1:53:25] said it's written is right that's what
[1:53:29] it is and we see that this seven seal
[1:53:34] book now is the mystery of
[1:53:39] redemption it's a book of redemption
[1:53:43] from
[1:53:44] God it's the book where the
[1:53:47] names are written under every
[1:53:51] seal glory glory and every revealing of
[1:53:55] that seal from first seal to seven seal
[1:53:58] seventh seal is the calling of the Bride
[1:54:03] in it CH that's why the prophet of God
[1:54:06] is the messenger of that seven seal yes
[1:54:10] sir and we are the names brothers and
[1:54:13] sisters under that seven seal when it
[1:54:17] was opened it called up

[2:01:18] concluded
[2:01:19] he's not there
[2:01:24] anymore now the lamb in the time of
[2:01:28] intercessory back
[2:01:30] here he
[2:01:32] knew that there were
[2:01:35] names in there that was put in there
[2:01:40] from the foundation of the
[2:01:43] world and as
[2:01:45] long as them names

[2:02:00] intercessor do you get
[2:02:03] it Prophet asked
[2:02:06] perfectly predestination see all right
[2:02:10] he had to stay
[2:02:14] that because he came to die for those
[2:02:18] that God had ordained to eternal life
[2:02:22] see see by his for knowledge he showed
[2:02:27] them not by his own will his will was
[2:02:31] that none should perish but by his for
[2:02:36] knowledge he knew who would and who
[2:02:39] would not amen therefore as long as
[2:02:44] there was one
[2:02:46] name had not never had yet been declared
[2:02:50] in
[2:02:51] Earth Christ had to stay
[2:02:57] there as an
[2:02:59] intercessor to take care of that name
[2:03:03] brothers and
[2:03:04] sisters
[2:03:06] Hallelujah but as soon as that final
[2:03:11] name had been splashed in that clono or
[2:03:15] Blitz then his intercessory day was
[2:03:20] over let him that's filthy be filthy
[2:03:24] still let him that's holy is Holy
[2:03:28] still see and he leaves the
[2:03:32] sanctuary and then it becomes a judgment
[2:03:37] seat woe unto those outside of Christ
[2:03:42] then he's still there brother waiting
[2:03:44] for
[2:03:47] you

[2:10:20] amen now the prophet of God
[2:10:23] said the six
[2:10:25] seal was in
[2:10:32] threefold in the
[2:10:39] message the 7th seal
[2:10:45] 1963 now we find out 38 87 also in this
[2:10:50] that the six
[2:10:52] seal now being open it was for a
[2:10:55] three-fold
[2:10:58] purpose now here was the
[2:11:02] purposes
[2:11:05] first the first thing was that the
[2:11:07] sleeping virgin had to go through the
[2:11:10] tribulation period for
[2:11:14] purification that's the first
[2:11:17] fold of the sick
[2:11:21] seal she had to be
[2:11:23] purged out of her sin of
[2:11:27] unbelief and rejecting this
[2:11:33] message she was done in the tribulation
[2:11:37] period we see they wind up over here in
[2:11:39] Revelation 7 between the six and the
[2:11:42] seventh chapter here she had been
[2:11:45] purged she had been given her robe
[2:11:49] now she is not the
[2:11:51] bride but it's the church the pure
[2:11:55] people that did not have the opportunity
[2:11:58] maybe to receive the message amen or in
[2:12:01] some way they were blinded by this false
[2:12:04] prophets and they did not get a chance
[2:12:07] and yet they're really sincere in heart
[2:12:10] and God knows their heart and here they
[2:12:12] are pged during this
[2:12:14] time second
[2:12:17] fold Parra 389 you notice another
[2:12:19] purging time that's for
[2:12:21] Israel when she gathers that's the
[2:12:25] second

[2:12:36] selected
[2:12:38] 144,000 and they will be purged also God

[2:19:51] that was unfolded the prophet of God
[2:19:54] said a seven
[2:19:57] seal
[2:20:03] okay 7 SE
[2:20:10] 1963 now do you
[2:20:13] notice on the opening of this seventh
[2:20:16] seal it's also in a three-fold
[2:20:21] mystery this one I have will speak and
[2:20:24] have spoke that it is the mystery of the
[2:20:28] seven
[2:20:33] canders
[2:20:36] amen the seven thunders in
[2:20:41] heaven will
[2:20:43] unfold this
[2:20:45] mystery amen
[2:20:47] first
[2:20:51] fold the seven thunders in heaven will
[2:20:54] unfold this mystery it will be right at
[2:20:58] the coming of Christ because Christ said
[2:21:00] no one knew when he would
[2:21:04] return let's continue
[2:21:07] to paragraph
[2:21:10] 393 and there will
[2:21:12] be a seven voices of these
[2:21:16] standers that will
[2:21:18] reveal the great Revelation at that
[2:21:25] time I believe to us if we don't know
[2:21:29] it it won't be know till that time but
[2:21:32] it will be revealed in that day amen in
[2:21:35] the hour that it's supposed to be
[2:21:38] revealed
[2:21:39] so the thing for us to do is to be
[2:21:42] reverent before God Amen serve him and
[2:21:46] do all that we we know how to do and
[2:21:50] live good Christian
[2:21:52] lives here now we find that the Sixth
[2:21:55] Seal has been open to us we see it and
[2:21:59] we know that this seventh
[2:22:01] seal cannot be broke to the public until
[2:22:04] that hour
[2:22:07] arrived paragraph
[2:22:09] 394 and there was some reason that God
[2:22:13] let these seven voices be thundered
[2:22:17] because it must come we find that Christ
[2:22:20] the lamb took the book in his
[2:22:23] hand and he opened that seven seal you
[2:22:29] see it's a hidden mystery no one knows
[2:22:33] it it right along with what he said no
[2:22:37] one would know his coming right they
[2:22:40] also would not
[2:22:42] know about this seven Thunder mystery
[2:22:47] right so you see it's connected
[2:22:51] together the seventh seal and the Seven
[2:22:54] Thunders the prophet of God said it's
[2:22:57] connected
[2:22:59] together and the first fold of the seven
[2:23:02] seal unfolded into the seven tunders so
[2:23:07] the prophet of God said brothers and
[2:23:08] sisters you don't want to add
[2:23:11] anything we just presented you the
[2:23:14] coach see yes 395 that much we have an
[2:23:19] understanding of it
[2:23:21] today because the rest of
[2:23:24] it it is all
[2:23:26] [Music]
[2:23:29] unfolded but
[2:23:31] this is not
[2:23:36] unfolded but sitting in my room I heard
[2:23:39] this not heard it rather but s it
[2:23:44] unfold to the seven
[2:23:48] Thunders now that's as far as we can go
[2:23:51] right
[2:23:52] there now I trust that each and every
[2:23:54] one of you will serve God and do that
[2:23:58] which is right love him all your life
[2:24:02] serve him and God will take care of the
[2:24:05] rest
[2:24:06] am we have in the completion here now by
[2:24:09] the grace of God all the mysteries of
[2:24:11] the six seals that's been sealed up and
[2:24:13] we understand and know here that the
[2:24:16] seventh seal is not to be known to the
[2:24:19] public now he's
[2:24:21] coming at the hour of his
[2:24:24] coming when the destruction of the earth
[2:24:26] you know he
[2:24:27] said there what will be the sign of the
[2:24:30] coming of the end of the world Matthew
[2:24:33] 24 they asked him what question that
[2:24:36] question he went down to that told about
[2:24:40] Israel being gathered as a nation that
[2:24:43] first verse of Matthew
[2:24:45] 24:31 but then he started off on The
[2:24:47] Parables you
[2:24:49] see learn the parable of the Fig Tree
[2:24:52] when you see it putting forth its BDS
[2:24:54] while you know Springs is nigh and then
[2:24:57] when you see this coming to pass then
[2:25:01] you know the time is nigh Israel
[2:25:04] gathering in its own
[2:25:05] Homeland but you notice he omitted the
[2:25:08] revelation of this seven SE
[2:25:13] now is this the sign of the end sir 1962
[2:25:17] I was about to
[2:25:19] write when I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[2:25:23] amen saying unto
[2:25:25] me seal capital S seal up those things
[2:25:31] which the seven Thunders

[2:25:46] everyone one it's not for the whole
[2:25:48] Christianity amen it's for his chosen

[2:25:56] husband nobody knows even your sons your
[2:26:00] family don't know about it it's a secret
[2:26:02] right amen that only belongs to your
[2:26:05] wife and

[2:26:14] beloved
[2:26:15] wife the Bride of the the Lord Jesus
[2:26:17] Christ amen can you say Amen brothers
[2:26:19] and
[2:26:21] sisters now listen to this always
[2:26:23] prophet of God said the seven seal is
[2:26:25] connected to the seven Thunders first
[2:26:27] fold right and that's why the prophet of
[2:26:30] God said when the first seal was
[2:26:34] open what did we
[2:26:37] hear there was a
[2:26:40] thunder and this is what the prophet of
[2:26:42] God said I'm asking you the
[2:26:44] question it blasted with thunder amen
[2:26:49] when this voice rang out did you notice
[2:26:53] when the seven seal that follow the
[2:26:56] seven Church ages when the first seal
[2:27:00] was open there was a
[2:27:04] thunder the first seals in the book was
[2:27:07] open there was a
[2:27:13] thunder would not this first
[2:27:18] of the outside
[2:27:21] book open the same
[2:27:24] way God doesn't change his program right
[2:27:30] amen I saw in the lamb had opened one of
[2:27:33] the seals and I heard it was the noise
[2:27:35] of a thunder and one of the VOR said
[2:27:39] come and see and there were never was
[2:27:42] another

[2:28:27] Earth and when the first seal of the
[2:28:29] seven that was open in the
[2:28:32] Bible it came forth just one but a blast
[2:28:36] that shook the whole thing a
[2:28:40] thunder then if the seals On The Backs
[2:28:44] side would open
[2:28:47] would not it be a thunder
[2:28:51] to I don't know I can say the prophet
[2:28:55] of amen amen you don't want to PL

[2:31:04] it blasted with
[2:31:07] Thunder and the voice rang out did you
[2:31:10] notice when the Seven Seals that follow
[2:31:14] the seven Church ages
[2:31:17] when the first seal was open there was a
[2:31:21] thunder the first seals in the book was
[2:31:24] open there was a thunder would not this

[2:31:31] same
[2:31:33] way God doesn't change his program amen
[2:31:36] let's turn to Revelation 6 and I saw
[2:31:38] when the lamb had opened one of the
[2:31:39] seals and I heard it was the noise of a
[2:31:43] thunder and one of the four Beast say
[2:31:45] come and
[2:31:47] SE there was never another Thunder and
[2:31:50] the last seed was open there was space
[2:31:53] in heaven forh an hour of Silence but

[2:32:03] the Bible it came forth just one but a
[2:32:06] blast that shook the whole thing a
[2:32:09] thunder then if the seals that's on the
[2:32:12] backside would open would not it be a
[2:32:14] thunder to
[2:32:16] there was a thunder the first seal and
[2:32:19] the seal was a
