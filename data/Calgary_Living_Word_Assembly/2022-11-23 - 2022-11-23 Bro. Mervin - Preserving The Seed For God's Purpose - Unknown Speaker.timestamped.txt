[43:30] okay that's good I'll I'll just check
[43:32] whether if it will work thank you
[43:35] musician
[43:36] musicians call Musicians amen
[43:39] just wanna be relaxed tonight and I hope
[43:43] you will also relax and
[43:45] that God will be on the scene and we'll
[43:48] all be
[43:51] blessed tonight amen
[43:53] maybe as a start let's read
[43:59] Genesis 1 11-12
[44:04] as you can see I have a title here
[44:07] preserving the seed
[44:09] for God's purpose
[44:13] I I did a little bit of this in the
[44:15] men's breakfast so it's just 15 minutes
[44:18] there so it ended up 30 minutes so
[44:21] this is the full version
[44:23] this is our home church so I will put
[44:26] all the effort the one that I had before
[44:29] it's 50 pages and then in the immense
[44:31] breakfast I cut it
[44:33] but this one will be the full version
[44:35] but you know we don't have any new
[44:38] message it's just reminding us
[44:42] uh uh you know by way of remembrance
[44:45] right so
[44:47] uh Genesis 1 11-12 so that at least we
[44:50] can have
[44:52] we'll try to finish by
[44:54] a little bit uh past nine o'clock okay
[44:57] Genesis 1 11 to 12 and God said let the
[45:01] Earth bring forth grass
[45:03] the herb building seed and the fruit
[45:06] tree yielding fruit after his kind
[45:10] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[45:13] so
[45:14] and the Earth brought forth grass and
[45:18] Herb yielding seed after his kind and
[45:20] the three yielding fruit whose seed was
[45:22] in itself after his kind and God saw
[45:25] that it was good
[45:27] let us bow our hearts this evening oh
[45:31] Lord Jesus
[45:33] we know it's not easy to speak before
[45:35] your people Lord and behind this Pulpit
[45:38] everything that will be said Lord
[45:40] will be accounted
[45:43] Lord if
[45:46] if I will say something that will not be
[45:49] according to your word Lord forgive me I
[45:51] will ask for forgiveness right now but I
[45:53] don't intend that Lord
[45:55] because my basis is your word and your
[45:58] message
[45:59] and the Fulfillment of your message
[46:03] through US O Lord Jesus
[46:05] and we know everything has a purpose
[46:09] everything that is coming out from us
[46:13] Lord
[46:14] everything is the fruit of of who we are
[46:18] all our Jesus
[46:20] that's why
[46:21] Lord anything that will be manifested
[46:25] from us Lord will be your word because
[46:27] your word is in US
[46:29] oh God as we
[46:30] as we start this uh service our lord
[46:34] Jesus by the opening of your word O Lord
[46:36] Jesus may you anoint
[46:39] my lips Lord It's a lip my lips of clay
[46:43] lord it's not worthy
[46:45] it's dirty but Lord by the power of your
[46:48] word Lord it can be cleansed and be used
[46:50] Lord as long as As I will surrender
[46:52] myself and keep out of the way oh Lord
[46:54] may you be the one who will speak Lord
[46:56] before your people
[46:58] may you be
[47:00] may you have preeminence Lord from start
[47:02] to finish Jesus Christ name we pray amen
[47:05] you may be seated
[47:08] so uh preserving the seed for God's
[47:10] purpose if you can see it
[47:13] everything that we see has a purpose
[47:16] everything that God allows has a purpose
[47:18] so I'll give a background of what the
[47:21] uh what this topic is all about is uh if
[47:25] I will start with the story of Joseph
[47:27] and Judah just for for a background
[47:33] Joseph we always say is a type of Christ
[47:36] amen
[47:37] but then the thing is when you check his
[47:40] uh story
[47:42] there's a deeper
[47:44] thing in it
[47:45] because
[47:47] it is me it is said in the scripture
[47:50] uh all all of his ordeals he became uh
[47:55] slaves he was sold to Egypt and so on
[47:57] and so forth
[47:58] for a purpose the purpose is to preserve
[48:01] life
[48:02] amen
[48:04] and whose life was he preserving
[48:07] just a question there I know this is a
[48:10] it's a big topic but then just a just a
[48:13] background for this topic he preserved
[48:15] the seed of Judah
[48:18] why because Judah
[48:21] Jesus Christ came from the uh from the
[48:24] tribe of Judah
[48:25] amen so it means it's not actually
[48:28] Joseph that uh that we we see him as the
[48:33] hero there is a purpose why he became a
[48:36] hero so that he can preserve the life of
[48:38] Judah so that Jesus Christ can be
[48:40] manifested later on
[48:42] amen and and you can see also
[48:45] the Egyptians they were in Goshen before
[48:49] right I think Emmanuel preached on
[48:52] Goshen but I'll take it on a different
[48:54] level Goshen when when when the the
[48:58] Sarai lights went to Goshen they have
[49:01] fruits they are they are fruitful in
[49:03] that land
[49:04] but then if you check about it Goshen is
[49:07] not the right land
[49:09] so they have to come out of Goshen
[49:12] right if you type it to our day this
[49:16] world is not our home
[49:18] right so we can redemption you know two
[49:21] parts brother uh
[49:23] many brothers already preach on it
[49:26] coming out and getting in
[49:29] right you have to come out of gaussian
[49:31] and go to where Canaan which is the
[49:33] promised land so there's a lot of
[49:34] process there right same for us we have
[49:37] to come out of our denomination so that
[49:39] we can go to the full word of the hour
[49:42] amen which is the message of the hour
[49:45] so just a background on that you you can
[49:48] see that everything that happens there
[49:50] is always a purpose
[49:51] amen so it's a
[49:54] and it's for God's uh
[49:58] you know he's uh
[50:00] uh
[50:01] his uh uh purpose stands in election
[50:06] amen so I will start
[50:09] with a lot of scriptures and messages
[50:12] and then some graphics here so that at
[50:15] least we can we can enjoy amen
[50:18] very familiar scripture I put all things
[50:21] I know it's better to check with the
[50:23] Bible but then with limited time I'll I
[50:26] just put it I hope it's legible I think
[50:29] it is so Romans 8 20 30 which is very
[50:32] familiar scripture and we know that all
[50:36] things as I mentioned work together for
[50:39] good amen to them that love God to them
[50:42] who are the called according to his
[50:44] purpose
[50:45] I recalled
[50:47] hey man are we special people amen for
[50:50] whom he did for no for knowledge right
[50:53] he also did predestinate
[50:56] to be conformed to the image of his son
[50:58] that he might be the firstborn among
[51:00] many brethren
[51:01] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[51:05] he called he also called whom he called
[51:08] them he also Justified
[51:10] and whom he justified them he also
[51:13] glorified so you can see all the all the
[51:15] process here
[51:17] he because of his poor knowledge he
[51:20] predestinated us
[51:22] then he called us
[51:24] and then he justified we know the
[51:26] meaning of justification
[51:27] we never did it in the first place he
[51:30] destroyed all evidence though we did it
[51:33] but he didn't we didn't do it it's a
[51:36] paradox
[51:37] right so so that's a privilege for
[51:41] having a prophet of this day to to
[51:43] remind us of Who We Are
[51:46] it's it's a blessing it's it's
[51:48] glorification it's Rapture it's
[51:51] everything
[51:53] uh there is no purpose of coming to
[51:55] church if we will just stay here and
[51:57] then come back and uh get out of here
[52:00] and then be the same
[52:01] it's always being reminded that we must
[52:04] know who we are
[52:06] right and and that knowing who we are
[52:08] means we are uh being healed of our
[52:11] spiritual amnesia
[52:13] amen so you see when we are Justified we
[52:17] will be glorified meaning we will be
[52:20] ruptured amen glorified in our glorified
[52:24] bodies oh brothers and sisters so so
[52:26] important so you can see
[52:29] in Sumerian Church AIDS here
[52:32] John 6 37 and 44 it says all that the
[52:36] father giveth me shall come to me
[52:39] and him that cometh to me I shall in no
[52:42] wise cast out
[52:43] but you can see here there's something
[52:46] in between here that these are two
[52:48] different classes of people the first
[52:51] one is all that the father giveth me
[52:53] shall come to me that's the bride amen
[52:56] but the second one in him that cometh to
[52:58] me I shall in always cast out so it
[53:00] means these are this could be the
[53:02] foolish virgins amen that they come and
[53:05] and and any person that gives us a cup
[53:08] of cold water
[53:09] right
[53:10] they will not be cast out because they
[53:12] did good to the bride we will talk
[53:14] anymore no man can come to me except the
[53:17] Father which had sent me draw him
[53:20] and I will raise him up at the last day
[53:22] imagine he will be raised at the last
[53:24] day but this last day is not our day uh
[53:27] because for us first resurrection we
[53:30] will be there this is the the second
[53:32] Resurrection John 1 12 13 but as many as
[53:36] received him
[53:38] to them gave him power to become the
[53:41] sons of God
[53:42] even to them that believe on his name
[53:44] which were born not of blood nor of the
[53:47] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[53:50] but of God
[53:53] amen you can see here Ephesians 1 4-5
[53:56] it's been preached by Briar very many
[53:58] times but uh also it's good when there's
[54:01] visual because they said when you see
[54:03] something you will remember more
[54:05] right
[54:08] according as he had chosen us
[54:11] chosen we were chosen
[54:14] in him before the foundation of the
[54:16] world
[54:17] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[54:20] before him in love
[54:22] having predestinated us and to the
[54:25] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[54:26] himself according to the good pleasure
[54:29] of his will now without getting too
[54:31] involved in the subject of sovereignty
[54:33] of God because sovereignty of God it
[54:35] will take a lot of booking itself he's
[54:37] saying let me point out that according
[54:39] to these verses Jesus Christ is choosing
[54:42] his own bride
[54:44] just the same as men choose their Brides
[54:46] today
[54:47] so it's his choice
[54:49] if he chose you
[54:52] you should must be thankful
[54:54] you didn't do anything
[54:56] amen
[54:58] so that is a very important foundation
[55:01] that uh it's not because of our works
[55:04] it's always being told to us that it's
[55:07] by his grace alone
[55:10] we didn't do anything anything that we
[55:12] do as as a product of being a bride is
[55:15] just the manifestation because we are
[55:17] bright in the first place amen so let's
[55:20] continue
[55:21] the bride today does not simply decide
[55:25] she's going to take a certain man for a
[55:27] husband
[55:29] no sir it is the groom amen who decides
[55:32] which is Christ amen and chooses a
[55:34] certain woman for his bride so in John
[55:37] 15 16 you have not chosen me but I have
[55:41] chosen you
[55:43] now according to the word of God the
[55:46] bride was chosen before the foundation
[55:47] of the world
[55:49] amen this choosing of the bride was
[55:52] purposed in himself
[55:54] Ephesians 1 9 and in Romans 9 11 it says
[55:57] that the purpose of God according to
[56:00] election might stand
[56:02] you can't read it any other way amen the
[56:06] hard purpose you see the main purpose
[56:09] the Eternal purpose of God was to take a
[56:12] bride of his own choosing
[56:15] and that purpose was in himself and
[56:17] being Eternal was decreed before the
[56:19] foundation of the world so it's already
[56:21] done brothers and sisters we it's just a
[56:24] drama that we're trying to fulfill right
[56:25] now right reminding each and everyone
[56:28] who we are so we just have to to live
[56:31] the life according to the word feed the
[56:33] word amen pray
[56:35] we know we need to work man right that's
[56:38] our curse so we have to do it but then
[56:42] the things that's that's just to earn a
[56:44] living
[56:46] amen it's not to
[56:48] to gain the whole world and lose our
[56:50] souls
[56:51] amen
[56:53] I have I have this I know it's a it's so
[56:57] hard to get out of the notes when
[57:01] because the message is already there
[57:02] just put them together and then you will
[57:04] read it as long as it's it's within the
[57:07] within the parameters of the word and
[57:09] the message I will not worry at all I'll
[57:11] just read it because I don't have the
[57:14] right to correct the prophet or or
[57:16] correct the word it's just we we're
[57:18] thankful that's why we have the fivefold
[57:20] ministry building on each other not not
[57:23] distracting each other right it's it's
[57:25] building each other because Paul
[57:28] planted the seed Apollos watered but who
[57:32] does the increase
[57:33] it's the lord always amen so we that's
[57:36] why it's so important we're thankful we
[57:39] we can practice the the Ephesians 4 11.
[57:42] but then the thing is every message that
[57:45] we will preach out of this must be under
[57:47] the message of the hour because that is
[57:50] the major prophet we could be Prophets
[57:54] because the word of God is in us we are
[57:56] not God but the word of God comes
[57:58] through us and as I'm repeating what the
[58:00] word says it is that's it the Lord
[58:02] because it came it comes from the Bible
[58:04] it didn't come from my own intellectual
[58:07] conception
[58:08] right so so let's do it for the children
[58:12] this is again election you can see for
[58:15] the children being not yet born
[58:18] neither having done any good or evil
[58:20] that the purpose of God according to
[58:22] election might stand not of works but of
[58:25] him that call it who's calling brothers
[58:28] and sisters amen it's always God who's
[58:31] calling amen
[58:33] it was said unto her the Elder Shall
[58:35] Serve the anger
[58:37] as it is written Jacob have I loved but
[58:39] he so have I hated what shall we say
[58:42] then is there unrighteousness with God
[58:44] God forbid amen because he has
[58:47] sovereignty he can do whatever he wants
[58:49] right so so now
[58:53] as we will read this the purpose we
[58:57] mentioned everything has a purpose so
[58:59] let's check the purpose of the prophet
[59:02] of this age amen and and we know Malachi
[59:06] 4 1-6 there are two two uh
[59:10] uh two comings of Elijah that we can
[59:12] read here let's read it because we know
[59:15] we have John the Baptist and we have uh
[59:17] Branham here but let's let's uh dissect
[59:21] it for behold that they cometh that
[59:23] shall burn us an oven and all the proud
[59:26] day and all that do wickedly shall be
[59:28] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[59:30] burn them up said the Lord of hosts that
[59:32] it shall leave them neither root nor
[59:34] branch
[59:35] did this happen already
[59:37] not yet right
[59:40] the Earth didn't burn yet amen but unto
[59:43] you that fear my name shall the son of
[59:44] righteousness arise with healing in his
[59:46] wings
[59:47] and he shall go forth and grow up as
[59:50] calves of the stall
[59:51] and ye shall tread down the wicked for
[59:53] they shall be ashes Under The Souls of
[59:55] our of your feet in the day that I shall
[59:58] do this said the Lord this is a warning
[59:59] amen because this this haven't happened
[1:00:04] so remember ye the law of Moses my
[1:00:07] servant which I commanded unto him in
[1:00:09] Horeb for all Israel with the statutes
[1:00:12] and judgments this is a very familiar
[1:00:15] scripture behold I will send you Elijah
[1:00:18] amen the prophet before the coming of
[1:00:20] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord I
[1:00:23] underlined and put in red great and
[1:00:26] Dreadful
[1:00:27] right because if you check about it for
[1:00:31] us it's the Great
[1:00:33] coming of the Lord
[1:00:35] but for the unbelievers is the Dreadful
[1:00:37] day of the Lord but then when you check
[1:00:40] again great because the thing is in in
[1:00:44] in in
[1:00:47] in verse 6 and he shall turn the hearts
[1:00:49] of the fathers to the children
[1:00:51] that's John the Baptist
[1:00:53] amen and turn the hearts of the children
[1:00:55] to the fathers that's right Branham lest
[1:00:58] I come and smite the Earth with a curse
[1:00:59] so you can see great the coming of the
[1:01:01] Lord is great amen him physically in in
[1:01:05] Galilee in in in Jerusalem in where you
[1:01:09] know uh in in Nazareth wherever he
[1:01:13] preached the gospel right that's a great
[1:01:16] coming but then the Dreadful day of the
[1:01:18] Lord is the one that is for the second
[1:01:22] coming of uh basically for for reserved
[1:01:26] for Branham here which is the
[1:01:28] forthcoming of Elijah amen so you can
[1:01:31] see in this Malachi for for one to six
[1:01:34] here for for five and six
[1:01:37] their support for support Branham
[1:01:40] to look for for a bride for Jesus Christ
[1:01:44] he's the leader amen and and that's his
[1:01:48] purpose because it's to declare the word
[1:01:50] so that our hearts will be turned back
[1:01:53] to the fate of the Pentecostal fathers
[1:01:55] the original Faith amen so so since
[1:01:59] we're talking about Branham let's
[1:02:00] continue with the
[1:02:03] with the five comings of Elijah just for
[1:02:05] a presentation here I know I I I I did
[1:02:09] this in the Sunday school and also in
[1:02:11] Lethbridge and let's let's do it the
[1:02:14] first coming there are five comings of
[1:02:15] Elijah you can see the first one is
[1:02:17] Elijah himself so it's in 910 BC
[1:02:21] right First Kings 17 Second Kings 1
[1:02:26] uh verses one to eight we will not read
[1:02:28] those
[1:02:29] okay
[1:02:30] the second one is Elisha
[1:02:33] Second Kings 2 8 to 15 that's in 896 BC
[1:02:36] where did I get those dates so this this
[1:02:39] Bible from
[1:02:41] uh by Schofield
[1:02:44] sober Branham or I mean voice of God
[1:02:47] have been uh
[1:02:49] uh selling this basically they are
[1:02:52] available and then there are dates so
[1:02:54] you can see where these dates are so
[1:02:56] that at least you know where you are we
[1:02:58] are anti-message believers therefore
[1:03:00] it's important to know the time we're
[1:03:02] living in and it's important to know if
[1:03:05] you can put it in a timeline you will
[1:03:07] see where you are right so it's the
[1:03:09] based on dates so this is the second
[1:03:12] coming which is I mean second coming of
[1:03:14] Elijah but that brother Gilbert
[1:03:18] mentioned right
[1:03:20] the voice of Elijah and Elisha all right
[1:03:23] let's continue I don't wanna
[1:03:27] uh go ahead myself the third coming is
[1:03:30] Janda Baptist himself approximately 26
[1:03:33] A.D there are so many scriptures Matt
[1:03:36] Matthew 3 Mark 1 Luke 3 John 1 15 34
[1:03:40] Malachi 3 Isaiah 40 and 3. so this is
[1:03:44] just a background for what we will
[1:03:46] preach but then the thing is at least
[1:03:47] you will see
[1:03:49] there is a purpose for for the prophet
[1:03:51] right and then it's better to see where
[1:03:53] where he is located in the timeline amen
[1:03:57] so that's John the Baptist that's the
[1:04:00] third and the fourth is the prophet for
[1:04:01] the Gentiles which is Branham himself
[1:04:03] that is in 1909 to 1965 that is his
[1:04:07] whole life basically so it's in Malachi
[1:04:09] 456 Revelations 3 14 and Revelations 10
[1:04:13] 7. so and then we have the fifth coming
[1:04:16] of Elijah which is Moses and Elijah
[1:04:19] after the Rapture for three and a half
[1:04:21] years after we're gone then the the
[1:04:23] message which is the message of the hour
[1:04:26] which is the Gospel of Jesus Christ will
[1:04:28] be turned to to the
[1:04:32] juice because then Gentiles days is over
[1:04:36] at that time no more grace for us right
[1:04:39] but then for us because we're the bride
[1:04:42] we were chosen before the foundation of
[1:04:43] the world we don't need to worry about
[1:04:45] that it's just nice to know that after
[1:04:47] Rapture there's three and a half years
[1:04:49] of of tribulation where Jesus Christ
[1:04:53] will rebuild himself to the Jews they
[1:04:56] are special people amen but they are not
[1:04:58] the bride amen so that's why it's so
[1:05:01] important to know that uh this message
[1:05:04] of the hour
[1:05:05] is so rich and so uh clear to tie the
[1:05:09] Loose Ends amen
[1:05:11] so let's continue so you you can see the
[1:05:14] the seven Church ages is within this
[1:05:17] 2000 years here but if I'll go back here
[1:05:19] you can see
[1:05:21] between John the Baptist and and Branham
[1:05:24] it's about 2 000 years
[1:05:27] of difference but then if we read if we
[1:05:30] read the Malachi 456 we thought it's
[1:05:33] just one scripture but it's actually two
[1:05:35] thousand years Gap between the two so
[1:05:38] imagine
[1:05:39] we we must read between the lines the
[1:05:42] way the way Branham preach it because
[1:05:44] it's only through the prophet that we
[1:05:46] can read between the lines amen that
[1:05:48] Revelation is already there it's not of
[1:05:51] course it's for us it's Progressive even
[1:05:54] for Branham is Progressive but anything
[1:05:55] that we need to be raptured is already
[1:05:58] there in the message that's why he says
[1:06:00] the rupturing faith lies on the message
[1:06:03] of the hour which which are you know
[1:06:06] recorded in the tapes it's not new
[1:06:08] message amen it's just fulfilling you
[1:06:12] can see he preached two hours three
[1:06:14] hours here and there because he's trying
[1:06:15] to save the food for us and that is for
[1:06:18] a purpose so that we can be here
[1:06:20] November 23rd Wednesday
[1:06:22] uh
[1:06:24] 2022 we will be here listening to all
[1:06:27] this amen
[1:06:29] praise the Lord so you can see
[1:06:31] between here
[1:06:33] and the Baptist he's a forerunner of the
[1:06:36] first coming right and Brian Branham is
[1:06:38] a foreigner Forerunner of the second
[1:06:40] coming but Brian Branham already left
[1:06:43] the scene we can see John the Baptist he
[1:06:46] foreign the person and the person was
[1:06:48] there
[1:06:49] so Brian Branham was
[1:06:51] here so what do you expect the pattern
[1:06:54] is he must also be there
[1:06:56] where is he now
[1:06:58] amen that's why it's in you and me amen
[1:07:01] it's it's a little bit different because
[1:07:03] for gender Baptist it's physical
[1:07:06] but for us it's spiritual
[1:07:09] so
[1:07:10] the second coming
[1:07:12] we've been
[1:07:14] very thought talked about it there's so
[1:07:17] many appearings but there are three
[1:07:20] comings right so we will not tackle that
[1:07:22] because it it's in the timeline for from
[1:07:25] eternity to Eternity but uh you know for
[1:07:28] for for this second coming is also a
[1:07:30] Time timeline and it happened in 1963 in
[1:07:33] the cloud amen February 28 when he he
[1:07:36] was taken out up by the seven angels
[1:07:39] message uh the seven angels amen so
[1:07:42] going back to our topic here so you can
[1:07:45] see the church ages here it's two
[1:07:48] thousand years and we're only waiting
[1:07:50] for the Rapture right that's why
[1:07:53] by this timeline here you will see there
[1:07:55] is always a pattern
[1:07:57] every time
[1:07:59] I I preached this before you can see
[1:08:01] Before the Flood
[1:08:03] there was a message through Noah and
[1:08:06] it's a prophet amen what is this warning
[1:08:08] there will be flood there will be rain
[1:08:10] and
[1:08:11] the coming of Jesus Christ there will be
[1:08:13] a messiah
[1:08:15] right he's the word for the day amen but
[1:08:18] they didn't accept him but who who for
[1:08:21] run his first coming it's gender Baptist
[1:08:23] so is it different from this day
[1:08:26] that we're waiting for his second coming
[1:08:28] so there there must be a forerunner as
[1:08:30] well and he must be a prophet amen so
[1:08:33] you can see here the pattern that that
[1:08:35] the
[1:08:37] uh we we call it bright age right 1963
[1:08:41] February 28th that's the start of the
[1:08:43] third pool Ministry and and that's the
[1:08:45] opening of the word amen so let's let's
[1:08:47] continue
[1:08:49] so you can see these seven Church ages
[1:08:50] we have all the time here I discussed
[1:08:53] before so
[1:08:54] uh Brian Branham is saying it's a quick
[1:08:57] work for laodicea and then you can see
[1:08:59] it's uh one year so 2023 they will be
[1:09:01] equal with Ephesus here right so it's a
[1:09:05] warning only for us but we don't want to
[1:09:07] to base Our Fate on that but we know we
[1:09:10] already came right he's already living
[1:09:12] in US therefore we're living in the
[1:09:14] eighth day because whether we live or
[1:09:16] die we already manifested Christ in us
[1:09:18] so we don't need to worry at all amen so
[1:09:20] so you can see here 117 years
[1:09:24] Ephesus is 118 so because today is 2022
[1:09:28] right so doing a little bit of
[1:09:30] mathematics here right 20 to 22 minus
[1:09:33] 1906 that's 116 plus one you should
[1:09:36] include the first number or first year
[1:09:38] those uh who loves mathematics they
[1:09:41] would know that for example one to ten
[1:09:43] ten minus one is nine right but actually
[1:09:46] the numbers are 10 so 10 minus one is
[1:09:49] nine plus one so ten so that's how I I
[1:09:52] came up with all this right but then
[1:09:54] simplify they just
[1:09:56] uh the duck 170 by 53 so they end up
[1:09:59] with 117 but the actual mathematics in
[1:10:01] it is 1 70 minus 53 plus one right
[1:10:06] because you have to include the first
[1:10:07] year amen so in accounting you will
[1:10:11] it will not be a zero zero if uh if you
[1:10:14] will do it right right so and uh
[1:10:18] just a side note there so
[1:10:21] not now anyone knows that Amos
[1:10:25] 37 said that God promised that he would
[1:10:27] never do nothing until first he revealed
[1:10:30] it to his prophet
[1:10:32] amen through the church ages we've had
[1:10:35] reformers but promised by Malachi for
[1:10:38] that there would be a prophet in the
[1:10:40] land in the last days because it has to
[1:10:43] fit that pattern you see that pattern
[1:10:45] that I mentioned see before the end time
[1:10:47] come so there's always a pattern we must
[1:10:50] recognize the pattern and how can you
[1:10:52] recognize it by the message of the hour
[1:10:55] by the Vindicated prophet and then the
[1:10:57] Fulfillment of such uh
[1:11:00] prophecy by the prophet if it doesn't
[1:11:03] come to pass then it's not a Vindicated
[1:11:05] the word amen but it came to pass that's
[1:11:09] why we're so we're resting on it amen
[1:11:12] so
[1:11:13] you can see here
[1:11:15] before Jesus come the first
[1:11:17] Elijah come Elijah Malachi 3 amen that's
[1:11:21] John the Baptist Matthew 11 says so if
[1:11:24] you can understand it this is who was
[1:11:26] spoken of behold I send my messenger
[1:11:29] before me
[1:11:31] now he's prophesied all theologians
[1:11:34] believe that in the last day
[1:11:36] the spirit of Elijah is to come to we
[1:11:39] just read it right behold I send you
[1:11:41] Elijah but whose Elijah is the spirit of
[1:11:44] Elijah amen because Spirits never die
[1:11:47] they just you know come from one person
[1:11:51] to another person even even the evil
[1:11:55] spirit they went to to the swine in
[1:11:57] gadara so it's both sides but let's talk
[1:11:59] about the good ones right so
[1:12:02] now he's prophesied all theologians
[1:12:04] believe that that in the last day the
[1:12:06] spirit of Elijah is to come too it has
[1:12:09] to come five times
[1:12:10] God uses that spirit amen
[1:12:14] Elijah John the Baptist Elisha and for
[1:12:17] the Gentile Church which is Barbara
[1:12:19] Branham and then for the Jews in
[1:12:21] Revelation the 11th chapter that's God's
[1:12:24] grace g-r-a-c-e Faith f-i-t-h Jesus
[1:12:29] j-e-s-u-s Jesus the letter five
[1:12:32] can't stop at four it has to go five
[1:12:34] amen so you see numerology Branham is so
[1:12:38] so uh Keen in in telling us about
[1:12:43] numerology amen the numbers
[1:12:46] this one is a good one actually trying
[1:12:48] to do get the service now he promised
[1:12:51] that so that sets the Bible just exactly
[1:12:53] to this day and the Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:12:56] and Elijah
[1:12:58] that wasn't Elijah
[1:13:00] that was the spirit of God on Elijah
[1:13:04] Elijah was just a man
[1:13:06] amen now we have Elijah's Elijah's coats
[1:13:10] and Elijah's mantles and Elijah's
[1:13:12] everything but the Elijah of this day
[1:13:15] is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:18] so why do we need to worry because it's
[1:13:22] Jesus Christ in you and me so
[1:13:24] so it means the spirit of Elijah is also
[1:13:27] in you because that spirit is the Lord
[1:13:29] Jesus Christ amen he is to come
[1:13:31] according to Luke 17 30. the son of man
[1:13:34] is to reveal himself among his people
[1:13:36] not a man
[1:13:38] God
[1:13:39] but I'll come through a prophet that's
[1:13:42] why we have this prophetic Ministry and
[1:13:44] it's through the bride now because the
[1:13:45] the messenger are already gone right so
[1:13:48] what are we preaching we're preaching
[1:13:49] the word so the word of God is in us
[1:13:51] that's why it's prophetic right because
[1:13:53] we have blessed the Lord amen we're not
[1:13:56] adding anything to the Bible we're just
[1:13:58] repeating amen we're just rehearsing you
[1:14:01] can say now he had
[1:14:04] he never had two Major Prophets at the
[1:14:06] same time never in the world so
[1:14:08] there will not be any eight messenger
[1:14:10] per se because the bride is the eighth
[1:14:12] messenger amen because there will be no
[1:14:14] two Prophet except for for the Jews
[1:14:16] because they have Moses and Elijah there
[1:14:18] are two prophets there amen
[1:14:21] so it has to be one head
[1:14:24] God has to get one man under his control
[1:14:27] see there's one God there was Father Son
[1:14:29] and Holy Ghost but one God over it all
[1:14:31] notice and just use them offices
[1:14:34] so he has with Elijah the spirit of
[1:14:37] Elijah he used that Spirit but the same
[1:14:39] God controlling it all the time to
[1:14:42] fulfill his word amen so to fulfill his
[1:14:44] word it has he has to go through a
[1:14:46] prophet amen and and now it's through us
[1:14:49] so we we have this before but I added
[1:14:52] the scriptures here
[1:14:54] and the Very God of Peace in first
[1:14:57] Thessalonians 5 23 sanctify you holy and
[1:15:00] I pray God your whole Spirit soul and
[1:15:03] body be preserved blameless unto the
[1:15:05] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:15:07] Hebrews 4 12
[1:15:09] for the word of God is quick and
[1:15:11] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:15:13] sword piercing even to the dividing
[1:15:15] asunder of Soul spirit and of the joints
[1:15:18] and Marrow Johnson marrow that's the
[1:15:20] flesh
[1:15:21] amen so you can see Body Soul spirit and
[1:15:24] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:15:25] intents of the heart so this is a very
[1:15:29] good presentation because the thing is
[1:15:32] we discussed the first pull second pull
[1:15:34] and the third pull the first pull up
[1:15:36] first and second pull of brother Branham
[1:15:39] first pull is to contact the body which
[1:15:42] is to hold the the hand from his left
[1:15:45] right and then he can discern uh and and
[1:15:47] then he would know because of the
[1:15:49] movements of uh office veins and
[1:15:51] everything right he will see the Demonic
[1:15:53] life that will flow through his body so
[1:15:56] the first pull is to contact the body
[1:15:58] right that is sign in the hand that's
[1:16:01] healing and the second pull is to
[1:16:03] contact the spirit prophesying
[1:16:05] discernment right so his first two pulls
[1:16:08] also it is encompassed with healing
[1:16:13] Divine Healing but the third pool
[1:16:16] is the most important because the first
[1:16:19] two poles will give way to the third
[1:16:21] pool and man and that is to contact what
[1:16:23] the soul and the soul is where the word
[1:16:27] Lays
[1:16:29] and that seed right
[1:16:32] it needs to be quickened by the same
[1:16:34] material which is the word the word will
[1:16:36] Quicken the word inside us that's why it
[1:16:39] will Quicken from the inside going out
[1:16:42] and you can see it's the word of God
[1:16:44] that will that is quick which is alive
[1:16:48] powerful right sharper than 28 jet sword
[1:16:52] it will cut
[1:16:54] Pierce even to the dividing asunder of
[1:16:56] the soul from the inside and the spirit
[1:16:59] outer and joints and Marrow so you can
[1:17:02] see the third police opening of the word
[1:17:04] is very important to understand that
[1:17:06] that is for us that's the ministry of
[1:17:10] Branham since 1963 to 1965 and then
[1:17:14] it is being continued by us right now
[1:17:17] amen so you can see there
[1:17:20] there are dates here in the first pool
[1:17:23] you can see because before the first
[1:17:25] pull there are some preparations it's in
[1:17:28] 1946 to 1948 second pool is 1940 to 1963
[1:17:32] and then the third pool is 1963 to 65
[1:17:35] but then to the present also which is us
[1:17:37] we're continuing the voice ministry
[1:17:40] right now that's why the voice is in the
[1:17:42] bride right and what voice are we saying
[1:17:46] what that that's the voice of God in us
[1:17:49] amen we're manifesting so we're just
[1:17:52] waiting actually for the Trump because
[1:17:54] that trumpet which is the marriage
[1:17:56] supper of the lamb in the sky amen I I
[1:17:59] know I I did this before but then again
[1:18:02] it's another Foundation
[1:18:04] so it's the same
[1:18:06] uh how it is from latency to ripen seed
[1:18:09] from death
[1:18:11] you will have life and then you'll be
[1:18:13] dead again
[1:18:15] meaning you're dead to yourself when
[1:18:17] you're ripened because you're baked
[1:18:20] by the sun s-o-n right you're baked by
[1:18:23] the word there's no more greenness in US
[1:18:25] therefore we are perfect in in in his
[1:18:28] Gardener right to be harvested so you
[1:18:31] see from that to set to death but you
[1:18:33] cannot grow without being rotten
[1:18:37] right without being dead to ourselves we
[1:18:40] cannot live so now
[1:18:42] we grow until we become mature and then
[1:18:45] when we mature we will be dead again and
[1:18:49] then God can take us fully fully
[1:18:52] surrendered vessel is omnipotent right
[1:18:54] when we're fully surrendered we don't
[1:18:56] need our own intellectual understanding
[1:18:58] and whatnot right amen so so you can see
[1:19:02] here Dark Ages rotten right there's so
[1:19:05] 68 million Protestants or or you can say
[1:19:08] Christians were martyred here that's why
[1:19:11] Tyrant church is Dark Ages and then
[1:19:14] comes justification by Luther which is
[1:19:18] the stock so little little life there
[1:19:20] and then the tassel sanctification AIDS
[1:19:23] by Wesley and then the shock Pentecostal
[1:19:25] age that's why we're living in
[1:19:28] Pentecostal AIDS we're living in the
[1:19:29] bright age which is this guy here
[1:19:31] messenger is Jesus Christ through
[1:19:33] brother Branham and then the bride amen
[1:19:36] third pool just putting it there it's
[1:19:38] good to repeat because it's so
[1:19:40] so yummy so so rich so it's just good to
[1:19:44] to understand it
[1:19:47] okay let's let's read this
[1:19:50] Christ is rebuilding his own word
[1:19:53] see down through the age
[1:19:55] we started off from the foundation of
[1:19:58] course we have to start with Foundation
[1:19:59] right Faith uh and so on and so forth
[1:20:03] when the seed went in the ground the
[1:20:06] complete seed then it come out through
[1:20:08] the feet Luther you see from the bottom
[1:20:10] it goes up based on this Luther come
[1:20:13] back out then through Wesley then into
[1:20:16] Pentecostals the tongues
[1:20:18] in the lip see now it's in the eyes
[1:20:21] prophetic
[1:20:22] of Malachi 4 and so forth
[1:20:25] and now there's nothing else left for it
[1:20:27] to come but him himself
[1:20:30] which is the Capstone
[1:20:32] amen once we already understood who we
[1:20:36] are then the Capstone will come and and
[1:20:38] we know 1963 that's the tapping
[1:20:41] amen the third pool he will come himself
[1:20:44] to step into that because that's the
[1:20:46] last thing there is
[1:20:48] the next is the intelligence
[1:20:50] and we have no intelligence of our own
[1:20:53] it's his we have no sight of Our Own
[1:20:56] how can a man foresee those things
[1:20:59] he can do it it's God himself see it's
[1:21:02] becoming to a place and it's governed
[1:21:04] the body all the way through then the
[1:21:06] complete body of Christ
[1:21:08] is revealed in the form of what of a
[1:21:11] bride that was taken out of his side
[1:21:13] same material brothers and sisters like
[1:21:15] at like Adam was rather at the beginning
[1:21:19] so you see it's a masterpiece right it's
[1:21:21] a anything that came out of Adam is Adam
[1:21:24] it's the same material same for for the
[1:21:27] Masterpiece uh uh Moses stat uh statue
[1:21:32] the one that was hit that little piece
[1:21:34] is the same material as the as the big
[1:21:37] piece so it's just a measure of what it
[1:21:40] is so if if God is in US
[1:21:43] right so what are we then
[1:21:48] so we are Messiah it's saying right so
[1:21:52] let's continue these are very good
[1:21:54] nuggets that I I just wanted to share
[1:21:56] you can see with your hands
[1:21:59] yet it's part of the body
[1:22:01] you can see with you cannot see with
[1:22:03] your ears yet it can hear
[1:22:05] you can't see with the nose yet it
[1:22:07] smells you can see with the lips though
[1:22:11] it speaks see that was the Pentecostal
[1:22:13] age that with the tongues but now it's
[1:22:16] in the eye time the seeing prophetic now
[1:22:19] there isn't one moving
[1:22:21] faculty beyond the eye
[1:22:24] there is not one moving faculty being
[1:22:27] die it means anything let's continue the
[1:22:30] next is the intelligence because it's in
[1:22:32] the mind which is Christ itself who
[1:22:34] controls the whole body he's the head
[1:22:36] amen no moving motion beyond that see
[1:22:40] everything else has moved see move your
[1:22:43] feet move your muscles in your legs Mo
[1:22:45] move everything move your ears your ears
[1:22:48] can move your nose your lips and so
[1:22:50] forth but after your eyes there's
[1:22:52] nothing moves
[1:22:54] that's why they claim that men get
[1:22:56] bald-headed quick
[1:22:57] is because see there's no exercise to
[1:23:00] develop the muscles in in the hair the
[1:23:01] skull but I'm just wondering here how
[1:23:03] come it's only men that got belt-headed
[1:23:05] maybe the the women use their muscles in
[1:23:08] the head because they think so much
[1:23:09] right and
[1:23:11] it's a I know the one of the seminars
[1:23:16] that we went with bar Paul and the rest
[1:23:18] for for men maybe there's only two boxes
[1:23:21] but with women there are so many things
[1:23:23] they they want to solve the whole world
[1:23:25] whole wide world right so they think so
[1:23:28] much that's why they don't get bald
[1:23:30] headed I guess because they practice
[1:23:31] that muscle but
[1:23:34] anyway so you can see here and it's not
[1:23:38] got a question that they get blood up in
[1:23:41] there so there's no blood that comes out
[1:23:43] that's why
[1:23:44] there's no more moving far uh part the
[1:23:47] blood won't pump through see won't go up
[1:23:49] and furnish blood
[1:23:51] because the hair root lives by Blood
[1:23:54] and we find out
[1:23:56] that that part you see there's nothing
[1:23:58] beyond the eye so it's already the head
[1:24:00] so beyond the prophetic there's no more
[1:24:02] so are we waiting for another messenger
[1:24:04] are we waiting for another Prophet I
[1:24:06] don't think so amen it's it's very clear
[1:24:09] here
[1:24:09] that so you can see here the next
[1:24:13] so I put
[1:24:15] the colors here
[1:24:18] red orange yellow green
[1:24:22] blue indigo and violet and let's read
[1:24:25] the I will just read the a message here
[1:24:28] related to it it's in uh
[1:24:32] this one is in
[1:24:35] the original title here is 24 elders but
[1:24:38] uh actually right now the the the new
[1:24:42] the new title is Revelation chapter four
[1:24:45] number two it's in paragraph 176. it
[1:24:49] says Noah's rainbow
[1:24:50] composed primarily of seven colors red
[1:24:54] orange yellow G green blue indigos
[1:24:59] and violet that meant seven bows
[1:25:03] seven both seven churches reflecting
[1:25:06] seven lights it's light wrapped into the
[1:25:09] other one don't you see Guardian is
[1:25:11] seven colored rainbow his Covenant that
[1:25:14] he made a covenant that proved seven
[1:25:16] Church ages
[1:25:18] the seven colors he would save the Earth
[1:25:21] and if if we read Revelations 10 1
[1:25:24] and I saw another Mighty Angel which is
[1:25:27] Christ himself Revelation 10 1 and and
[1:25:29] that is uh we know that's the seventh
[1:25:31] seal amen when he when he came down
[1:25:33] cloth with the cloud
[1:25:35] and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:25:38] so it means it's together with the seven
[1:25:40] Spirit seven Messengers amen when
[1:25:42] Barbara Branham was caught up it's
[1:25:44] together with the other Messengers
[1:25:46] that's why it's a complete thing amen
[1:25:49] with Jesus Christ amen because uh uh
[1:25:53] let's continue here
[1:25:56] now if you notice
[1:25:58] seven rainbow seven colors I mean seven
[1:26:00] color rainbow that meant seven bows uh
[1:26:04] seven both seven churches reflecting the
[1:26:06] seven lights each light wrapped into the
[1:26:08] other one
[1:26:10] wrapped into the other one because uh
[1:26:12] you can see the church ages they are
[1:26:13] overlapping until we come to laodicea
[1:26:15] and then later on it will be the
[1:26:17] fullness of the word which is Christ
[1:26:18] himself that's why you were living in
[1:26:20] the bright age amen so you can see here
[1:26:24] the bride AIDS so so you uh these are
[1:26:28] the church ages episode
[1:26:30] and then these are the messengers and
[1:26:33] this is uh the typing rotten seed to
[1:26:36] matured seed rotten seed to stock tassel
[1:26:38] shop and then mature which is the
[1:26:40] rapture and the Harvest and this is the
[1:26:42] bright AIDs that we're living in and
[1:26:44] we're living now in the fullness of this
[1:26:46] nature of a perfect man because Christ
[1:26:49] already kept this Holy Spirit sealed us
[1:26:51] from inside and outside so we have the
[1:26:55] same shape as Jesus Christ right now he
[1:26:58] is the head and we are the body amen and
[1:27:00] you can see all these seven Church ages
[1:27:02] seven Messengers we they were used for
[1:27:05] because every age has a bride right but
[1:27:09] then the Bride of cloud is here which is
[1:27:11] us we we came through the next age which
[1:27:14] is the bright age we we that is on top
[1:27:17] uh I'll I'll just go quickly here so
[1:27:20] that at least we will read it
[1:27:23] you can see here we're not living in a
[1:27:25] Pentecostal age we're living in another
[1:27:27] age we're not living in the method this
[1:27:30] age we're living in another age we're
[1:27:32] living on up here
[1:27:34] because what we see over there is
[1:27:36] laodicea
[1:27:37] right you know it's uh the AIDS of
[1:27:40] Rights people's rights you see protests
[1:27:43] everywhere right especially here
[1:27:45] right
[1:27:46] everyone wants to exercise his rights
[1:27:50] it's people's rights but then you can
[1:27:52] see we're living on up here to the
[1:27:54] bright age
[1:27:55] what's the bride it's the calling out of
[1:27:58] the church and getting it together for
[1:28:00] the rapture
[1:28:01] amen if you if if you see that one and
[1:28:04] then we don't even need to worry at all
[1:28:06] amen
[1:28:08] so let's continue
[1:28:11] uh
[1:28:13] it says here in the face of the trumpet
[1:28:16] scripture is part of God reveals to us
[1:28:20] that we're in the last day
[1:28:22] we saw the timeline we're at the last
[1:28:24] day because all the patterns we're in
[1:28:26] 2022 right now it's almost 2 000 years
[1:28:29] since since Jesus Christ amen now if I
[1:28:33] come this is Barbara Branham speaking
[1:28:35] he's the laodicean church messenger we
[1:28:38] know that now if I come with the message
[1:28:40] of Pentecost I would be in the loudest
[1:28:43] loudest in church age
[1:28:45] and it wouldn't be right
[1:28:47] so that's why we we're harping on on the
[1:28:50] bride age because we're living in
[1:28:52] another age amen that's the reason that
[1:28:54] Wesley could not take Luther's message
[1:28:57] Luther was in one age
[1:29:00] Church age and Wesley was in another
[1:29:02] church age if Jesus would have come with
[1:29:05] the message of Moses it would not have
[1:29:06] worked if Moses would have come with the
[1:29:08] message of Noah it would not have worked
[1:29:10] that's why what is the evidence of
[1:29:12] having the the Holy Ghost is the ability
[1:29:15] to receive the word for what for this
[1:29:18] day
[1:29:19] we cannot have the Pentecostal message
[1:29:22] amen we need the message of the hour
[1:29:24] which is the bride H amen which is the
[1:29:27] message for this hour amen so so just
[1:29:30] these are not new I I believe so
[1:29:33] so we'll we're in the bright age so just
[1:29:35] a summary for this one the word that
[1:29:38] fell on the day of Pentecost
[1:29:40] will not work this day no sir that was
[1:29:43] for Pentecost
[1:29:45] you see after the Pentecost there was no
[1:29:47] rapture
[1:29:49] right but before Pentecost after Jesus
[1:29:51] Christ gave up the ghost
[1:29:53] right the the sleeping Old Testament
[1:29:57] Saints woke up right because they were
[1:29:59] under the law
[1:30:00] the the blood of uh bulls and goats will
[1:30:04] not make them perfect so they need to
[1:30:06] wait for the perfect sacrifice amen so
[1:30:08] that's why that's the Rapture there in
[1:30:10] for the Old Testament so right now we've
[1:30:13] got something different the Pentecostals
[1:30:16] represent that again we're in the bright
[1:30:18] age
[1:30:19] the word of Noah would not work in in
[1:30:21] the days of Moses no more than Moses law
[1:30:24] would have worked in the time of Paul
[1:30:25] here he tried to tell them you are dead
[1:30:27] to that you cannot have that amen
[1:30:30] so let let's have a parallel because
[1:30:33] we're thinking of the the ministry of
[1:30:37] Jesus Christ and Barbara Branham so that
[1:30:40] we know that there's always a pattern
[1:30:42] amen the ministry of Jesus Christ and
[1:30:44] the end time there is a parallel if you
[1:30:47] check Jesus Christ Ministry first and
[1:30:50] second pulls we talked about it it's
[1:30:51] healing and prophesying amen and then
[1:30:55] there's a quiet time for Jesus Christ
[1:30:56] because they forsake Him
[1:30:58] except some only the 12 apostles stayed
[1:31:02] with him and one is a Judas Iscariot
[1:31:05] right he's a traitor right and then his
[1:31:08] crucifixion
[1:31:09] if if you can see here and then the
[1:31:12] third pull he preached to the souls in
[1:31:14] prison
[1:31:15] and then the resurrection after uh when
[1:31:19] he was uh down there in the in the souls
[1:31:21] in prison three days and then when he
[1:31:24] came back and then they all resurrected
[1:31:25] that's the Old Testament rupture the
[1:31:28] third and the fourth rupture I'll put
[1:31:29] the timeline after and then if we put
[1:31:33] this end time parallel
[1:31:35] and time ministry first and second pulls
[1:31:37] up brother Branham healing prophesying
[1:31:39] again 1946 to 1963 but then there's
[1:31:42] quiet time for him as well because
[1:31:44] everyone was forsaking the word if you
[1:31:47] if you read the present the stage of my
[1:31:49] Ministry in 1962 August 8th you will see
[1:31:52] that he he he's actually uh
[1:31:55] uh you you can say disappointed already
[1:31:58] right because uh no one is hitting his
[1:32:01] uh his message no one is receiving his
[1:32:04] message right and and it and there's a
[1:32:08] parallel there there's always a purpose
[1:32:09] and there's always a pattern and then
[1:32:11] the crucify the crucifixion of Jesus
[1:32:14] Christ the indictment
[1:32:15] he preached in that man in 1963 July 7th
[1:32:20] and then the third pull itself opening
[1:32:23] of the word which is preaching to the
[1:32:24] law so you can see Jesus Christ went to
[1:32:27] the souls in prison
[1:32:29] right but that is in parallel with the
[1:32:31] third pool because the opening of the
[1:32:33] word is preaching to the lost but the
[1:32:35] bride will accept the message only the
[1:32:37] bride amen
[1:32:39] and then the resurrection which is the
[1:32:41] rapture which is for the New Testament
[1:32:43] rupture New Testament Saints amen let's
[1:32:46] continue with this you can see you might
[1:32:49] have seen this in the voice of God but I
[1:32:51] put some
[1:32:52] some notes on it
[1:32:54] the seven pics of Brian Branham this is
[1:32:57] in Madison actually Madison County in
[1:32:59] Montana
[1:33:00] so
[1:33:02] it's related to his name William Marion
[1:33:05] Branham right so br7 right and and
[1:33:09] before his first pool there are little
[1:33:12] picks here and then between the first
[1:33:15] and second pool and then this is the
[1:33:17] second pull it's he he rested a bit
[1:33:20] because he got sick he got sick there
[1:33:22] when he he was having a lot of Healing
[1:33:25] Ministry he rested but then before
[1:33:27] before the third pool he also went down
[1:33:30] and then he was about to go and be a bum
[1:33:32] he said he doesn't want to to proceed
[1:33:34] but then on the way back from Canada
[1:33:36] going going back there I think it's in
[1:33:39] uh standing on the Gap I I think that's
[1:33:41] the message when when Barbara Branham
[1:33:44] showed him this picks which is an
[1:33:46] everlasting sign
[1:33:48] right so so you can see the the pattern
[1:33:51] here with this name and also his three
[1:33:54] pools right and then that's the time he
[1:33:57] said that I will preach the gospel with
[1:33:59] all my heart whether I live or die or
[1:34:01] something he will preach it so these are
[1:34:05] uh uh you can say draw uh they're just
[1:34:09] drawings but this is the actual picture
[1:34:11] I think
[1:34:12] of that Madison County so if you
[1:34:15] checking Google is Brandon picks so you
[1:34:19] this might be good good to see and then
[1:34:21] Branham is uh in one of the pictures is
[1:34:24] behind it as well so
[1:34:26] you know God met him there right so so
[1:34:31] and that's why it was an everlasting
[1:34:33] sign for him that's why and there's a
[1:34:35] purpose for it so that you can be all
[1:34:37] manifested I can be manifested here amen
[1:34:39] otherwise we will not have the third
[1:34:41] pool amen so there's always a purpose
[1:34:44] amen
[1:34:45] so there are six raptures I I mentioned
[1:34:48] before I I might have preach this but
[1:34:50] then the thing is the first is Enoch
[1:34:52] second is Elijah then Jesus and the Old
[1:34:54] Testament Saints because when he
[1:34:57] preached uh the souls in prison for
[1:34:59] three days and then when he came back
[1:35:01] and then together with the Old Testament
[1:35:03] since they all went up so that's the
[1:35:06] third and fourth Rapture I mentioned in
[1:35:07] that table and then for here this is the
[1:35:11] fifth rupture which is the New Testament
[1:35:13] Saints which is us all the church ages
[1:35:15] all the seven Church ages New Testament
[1:35:17] Saints and then later on after three and
[1:35:20] a half years Moses and Elijah right will
[1:35:23] be raptured that's in uh after the end
[1:35:25] of the three and a half years
[1:35:26] tribulation that's before Millennium and
[1:35:30] then you can see the Millennium here is
[1:35:31] another one thousand years here that's
[1:35:34] not eternity yet that's a span of time
[1:35:37] right because 1 000 years so it means
[1:35:40] you can count it but then for us we have
[1:35:42] already our glorified body we already
[1:35:45] cross over here right that's why you can
[1:35:47] see it's very important to know that
[1:35:49] they were living in because every time
[1:35:51] two thousand years two thousand years
[1:35:52] two thousand years what are we waiting
[1:35:54] for we're in 2022 right now brothers and
[1:35:56] sisters it's later than we think oh we
[1:35:59] know Branham is always harping us it's
[1:36:01] later than you think later go and repent
[1:36:04] but he already got his glory he's
[1:36:05] already there with the uh you know
[1:36:08] in the sixth Dimension you can say which
[1:36:11] is the paradise of God but it's not yet
[1:36:14] in the Throne of God because they're
[1:36:16] waiting for us they cannot be perfected
[1:36:18] without us amen so that's why everything
[1:36:20] is resting on us
[1:36:22] amen so you can see this
[1:36:25] uh
[1:36:26] six raptures in the Bible and you can
[1:36:28] find this in the message uh the rapture
[1:36:32] so let's continue here uh all that the
[1:36:35] father giveth me shall come to me
[1:36:37] semicolon and then in him that cometh to
[1:36:40] me I will in no ice cast out so it means
[1:36:42] for us the bride and then the other one
[1:36:44] is anyone that wanted to come to him
[1:36:47] they might not have the Holy Ghost the
[1:36:48] foolish virgins didn't have the Holy
[1:36:50] Ghost but they will come to him they
[1:36:51] will look for the Holy Ghost it might be
[1:36:54] too late but for us we were so blessed
[1:36:57] that we we are elected before the
[1:36:59] foundation of the world without doing
[1:37:01] anything he just elected us amen so and
[1:37:04] also you can see John 16 12 here I have
[1:37:06] yet many things to say unto you but you
[1:37:09] cannot bear them now so it means it's
[1:37:12] Progressive also
[1:37:13] right but for us it's Progressive but
[1:37:15] Brian Branham everything is already
[1:37:16] really revealed to him but for us we're
[1:37:18] progressing as we feed on the word amen
[1:37:21] we're not adding any more Revelations
[1:37:23] everything is there to be raptured it's
[1:37:26] already in this message amen
[1:37:28] so let's continue
[1:37:31] a very I I read this before
[1:37:34] now then here
[1:37:37] we are coming to a conclusion as the
[1:37:40] Eternal logos was manifest in the Sun
[1:37:42] and Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:37:44] godhead badly and that Eternal one was
[1:37:46] the father manifesting flesh and thereby
[1:37:49] gained the title of sun even so we
[1:37:51] Eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[1:37:53] become became the main membered spoken
[1:37:55] word seed manifest in flesh and those
[1:37:58] Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh
[1:38:00] are the sons of God even as we are so
[1:38:04] called
[1:38:06] we did not become seed by the river
[1:38:09] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[1:38:11] for only the elect can be reborn because
[1:38:14] we were seed is the reason we could be
[1:38:16] quickened
[1:38:17] in Nancy there's nothing to Quicken I
[1:38:20] mentioned when we were having the
[1:38:22] breakfast I let's rephrase it if we can
[1:38:26] rephrase this we did not become
[1:38:29] seed by believing this message
[1:38:32] we believe this message
[1:38:35] because we were seed in the first place
[1:38:38] so it's not the other way around we we
[1:38:41] cannot we cannot sugar coat everything
[1:38:44] oh I I know all the coats ins and outs
[1:38:46] right no
[1:38:48] it is election
[1:38:50] we were elected we the seed was placed
[1:38:53] in us before the foundation of the world
[1:38:55] we we we cannot Merit it by our own
[1:38:59] righteousness
[1:39:01] so it's not like that the seed is there
[1:39:04] that's why so
[1:39:06] that's why we we pray for our children
[1:39:09] we pray for our loved ones because
[1:39:12] the seed will bring forth its own kind
[1:39:14] what kind of seed we are will our
[1:39:17] children be if they are not like us
[1:39:20] right we were Sinners Say by but by his
[1:39:23] grace we were saved amen we
[1:39:26] amen so
[1:39:28] we worshiped that's why
[1:39:30] that's why we work weekend
[1:39:32] it's not the other way around we cannot
[1:39:34] we cannot we cannot falsify or or make
[1:39:38] things work by our own Works basically
[1:39:41] amen so let me continue
[1:39:45] this one is very good also
[1:39:47] all the codes that are
[1:39:50] referring to us because the thing is the
[1:39:52] message of the hour is Christ and as the
[1:39:54] hope of glory and it's the word
[1:39:56] and if we read this look at the last
[1:39:58] days
[1:40:00] it'd be so close it deceived the very
[1:40:01] elected if it was possible but it's not
[1:40:04] possible right why the reason the
[1:40:07] elected won't be deceived you know why
[1:40:09] it's because they are the word
[1:40:11] oh brothers and sisters check check what
[1:40:15] we are right we are the word see just
[1:40:17] like the life isn't
[1:40:19] the life that's in the root I said a
[1:40:22] while ago it can't deny itself
[1:40:25] see it is the word and in the season of
[1:40:27] the word that's right the reason they
[1:40:29] elected Jesus said won't be deceived
[1:40:31] because they are that word they can't be
[1:40:34] nothing else
[1:40:36] they can't hear nothing else they don't
[1:40:39] know nothing else is that your sincere
[1:40:42] prayer brothers and sisters to be the
[1:40:44] word to be conformed to His Image amen
[1:40:47] we will have the mind of Christ amen
[1:40:51] so I will not read this but then we
[1:40:53] always take this this is related to
[1:40:56] Ezekiel because he talked to the dry
[1:40:58] bones fate comment by hearing but these
[1:41:01] are very dry they don't have ears
[1:41:04] right so it means what does what does
[1:41:07] that thing do it's it's the faith of the
[1:41:09] one speaking so brother Henry gave a
[1:41:12] good testimony he claimed it the power
[1:41:15] of the spoken word
[1:41:17] amen so if if we have that power you see
[1:41:21] the dry bones became alive
[1:41:23] it's as already the one that's speaking
[1:41:26] it's not the one that's hearing because
[1:41:28] these bones will not hear at all because
[1:41:30] they don't have any ears amen so yeah
[1:41:33] let's continue here
[1:41:37] I'm about to close maybe you'll wake up
[1:41:40] now so so now Brethren and sisters I
[1:41:45] want to ask you something then if we are
[1:41:47] born again of the spirit of God don't
[1:41:49] God don't have little weak parts and big
[1:41:52] strong parts
[1:41:53] he's all together God
[1:41:55] and if you had enough of God in you
[1:41:58] till it was just barely a shadow just a
[1:42:00] shadow
[1:42:01] that's enough power to make a new Earth
[1:42:05] brothers and sisters that's enough power
[1:42:08] to make a new moon and a new system it's
[1:42:10] God
[1:42:11] and it's strong and right now every
[1:42:14] believer in here where here we're
[1:42:17] repeating it has what it turned a life
[1:42:20] which is God's spirit in you
[1:42:24] and that power that will raise up the
[1:42:26] Dead
[1:42:26] that will heal the sick that will set
[1:42:29] orbits and conditions
[1:42:30] but you it's controlled by law
[1:42:34] that's that Spirit that's in you you are
[1:42:36] Sons and Daughters of God that same
[1:42:38] spirit that you've got in you will raise
[1:42:40] yourself up at the day of Resurrection
[1:42:43] that same spirit
[1:42:45] if that same Spirit dwells in you
[1:42:48] it will Quicken the Mortal our mortal
[1:42:51] body amen Jesus when he was here on
[1:42:54] Earth when he died his soul descended
[1:42:55] into hell and preach to the spirits that
[1:42:58] were in prison the souls in prison that
[1:43:02] repented not in the long suffering of
[1:43:04] the days of Noah his body went into the
[1:43:07] grave but before he died he commanded
[1:43:10] the spirit into the hands of God his
[1:43:12] Spirit went to God his soul went to hell
[1:43:15] and his body went to the Grave different
[1:43:18] locations and Jesus was barred out from
[1:43:21] Resurrection until the scripture could
[1:43:23] be fulfilled
[1:43:25] he could not come back because he had to
[1:43:27] stay in the grave for three days and
[1:43:29] nights because that's prophesied but
[1:43:31] when the scripture was all fulfilled
[1:43:33] this bar was taken away his Spirit
[1:43:35] descended to his soul his soul to his
[1:43:38] body and he rose again
[1:43:39] amen so you
[1:43:41] and when we die this is for us our souls
[1:43:45] will go under the altar of God
[1:43:48] where I was privileged to see yeah
[1:43:51] that's the beyond the curtain of time
[1:43:52] amen a few mornings ago as you know in
[1:43:55] the vision where the Bible speaks of our
[1:43:57] spirits will go to God who give it amen
[1:44:00] and our bodies shall return to dust of
[1:44:02] the earth 16 elements amen but someday
[1:44:05] when the scripture is fulfilled which is
[1:44:08] being fulfilled day by day amen our
[1:44:10] spirits will be released from God we'll
[1:44:13] pick up the soul
[1:44:15] and the soul to the body
[1:44:17] and I under I highlighted this and the
[1:44:20] power that will raise us up is right in
[1:44:23] us now
[1:44:25] we are now in Heavenly places
[1:44:28] we are now in the power of the
[1:44:30] Resurrection oh brothers and sisters if
[1:44:33] there was a law
[1:44:35] there wasn't a law to that Sons and
[1:44:37] Daughters of God would create them a
[1:44:39] world out here and go live a private
[1:44:41] life on it you have the power to do it
[1:44:44] oh brother the power of the spoken word
[1:44:47] isn't that wonderful whether we have
[1:44:49] money for payment or whatever
[1:44:52] forget about it right I mean God will
[1:44:54] take care of it anything between us and
[1:44:56] God is our God
[1:44:57] so that we should remove every that
[1:45:00] mortar there between between the
[1:45:02] Capstone and the body that should never
[1:45:04] be any Gap because the fullness of the
[1:45:07] world right we are he's the head we are
[1:45:10] the body we're just following him and if
[1:45:12] you got a shadow of the power of God in
[1:45:14] you you got power to do it God is
[1:45:16] omnipotent see what I mean the power
[1:45:18] that's in you will make you could speak
[1:45:20] a world into existence and go live in it
[1:45:23] Hallelujah isn't that beautiful if we
[1:45:25] can make a world
[1:45:27] and go live in it of course we we don't
[1:45:30] want all these things right especially
[1:45:32] like I forgot to mention we see the
[1:45:36] seven colors of the rainbow
[1:45:38] but you know the bright color right
[1:45:40] there are only six
[1:45:42] it's the number of men but the seven is
[1:45:45] the number of God right it's completion
[1:45:47] so you can see the numbers there's power
[1:45:49] in numbers amen so apply it
[1:45:53] I have a couple more apply it what
[1:45:57] this is the token apply the token
[1:46:01] and create that atmosphere we can create
[1:46:04] something if we can create the world
[1:46:05] into existence why not create atmosphere
[1:46:08] right
[1:46:09] create that atmosphere around you that
[1:46:12] they'll just drop right into it he's
[1:46:15] talking whoever we talk to right
[1:46:18] see oh you are you are if you get that
[1:46:21] token you create a spirit around you a
[1:46:24] power that when you walk people know
[1:46:27] that you're a Christian
[1:46:30] they love
[1:46:31] for you to say something to them
[1:46:34] they believe your word what you say they
[1:46:37] hold on to it see that's it so it's very
[1:46:40] important on what we speak because to
[1:46:43] get that power of the spoken word we
[1:46:45] must be speaking the word
[1:46:47] because if it's just by our own
[1:46:49] intellectual conception then it doesn't
[1:46:51] mean anything you can be a denomination
[1:46:54] of oneself right because that's you and
[1:46:56] and your mind and your spirit and your
[1:46:59] body but the soul belongs to God Amen so
[1:47:03] there's a power there's a power to
[1:47:05] create
[1:47:07] uh things into existence amen and we
[1:47:10] know that's that's the third pool amen
[1:47:13] oh that's that's so wonderful
[1:47:17] if you are a true seed
[1:47:22] if you are truly baptized with the Holy
[1:47:24] Ghost
[1:47:24] you will esteem this word above your
[1:47:27] necessary meat
[1:47:30] and yearn to live by every word
[1:47:34] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[1:47:37] and this is the ending of this million
[1:47:39] churches actually this is my Earnest
[1:47:41] prayer for all of us may we hear what
[1:47:44] the spirit is bringing from the word
[1:47:46] for us today
[1:47:48] and uh let's read this one also because
[1:47:51] of election because of sovereignty of
[1:47:53] God it's good to to know uh our position
[1:47:57] amen thus if God has so designed that
[1:48:01] there be those whose names are placed in
[1:48:03] a section of the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:48:06] cannot be erased
[1:48:08] for they are the names of his bride
[1:48:10] then we must accept that
[1:48:13] if it also states that there are those
[1:48:16] whose names were placed in the record of
[1:48:17] book of life but in the foreknowledge of
[1:48:20] God they were to fall and have their
[1:48:22] names removed we must accept that
[1:48:24] and if there are those whose names were
[1:48:26] never placed upon a record of life we
[1:48:28] must accept that also
[1:48:31] look at the sovereignty of God right and
[1:48:33] if there are those who will enter into
[1:48:36] eternal life they didn't have eternal
[1:48:37] life but they will enter into eternal
[1:48:39] life after the white Throne judgment
[1:48:42] solely on the grounds of being good and
[1:48:45] kind
[1:48:46] to and just to the elect of God who are
[1:48:50] his Brethren then we cannot but accept
[1:48:52] that so you see this message is so
[1:48:55] inclusive we think that we we are oh we
[1:48:57] are bright that's why you we will shun
[1:48:59] everyone that doesn't believe the
[1:49:00] message no this is very inclusive
[1:49:03] because you see because of us they will
[1:49:05] be able to enter into eternal life
[1:49:08] that's why with the hope of this
[1:49:10] generation every time that we preach
[1:49:12] behind this we're just so uh blessed
[1:49:16] that God gave us this grace and
[1:49:18] understanding and and who who can say
[1:49:21] two people will read the same Bible but
[1:49:25] for us it's it's it's alive it's
[1:49:27] quickened but but for them it's just a
[1:49:29] normal book they put the Bible in in the
[1:49:32] section of fiction when you go to Value
[1:49:34] Village or or to other bookstores they
[1:49:37] put it under fiction
[1:49:39] for them it's not true but for us it's a
[1:49:42] Living Word
[1:49:44] if there are those who will enter into a
[1:49:47] life eternal after the white Throne as a
[1:49:50] sheep as a Shepherd will uh divide the
[1:49:53] sheep from the goat but those sheep are
[1:49:56] not the bride those are it's it's a it's
[1:49:59] a type as a ship dividing as a Shepherd
[1:50:02] dividing the ship from the goat right
[1:50:04] being good and kind and just to the lack
[1:50:07] of God who are his Brethren then we
[1:50:09] cannot but accept that for who know it
[1:50:11] the mind of the Lord that he should
[1:50:13] instruct him rather let us be subject in
[1:50:16] faith to him who is our father and live
[1:50:19] so you see the sovereignty of God he
[1:50:22] we're just Clays right Clays we he's the
[1:50:26] Potter whatever he he designed us but
[1:50:29] we're so glad
[1:50:31] glory to God he made us bright
[1:50:34] he chose us he we didn't choose him he
[1:50:38] chose us amen so so now our topic is
[1:50:41] preserving uh God seed for a purpose and
[1:50:44] what is our purpose now
[1:50:48] to conclude right our purpose we must
[1:50:51] know our purpose
[1:50:53] so it's we read it it's to manifest
[1:50:57] Christ
[1:50:58] in this day we will be the living Bible
[1:51:01] walking Bible living Epistles red of all
[1:51:05] man amen and and and by doing that we
[1:51:08] will be imparting eternal life to others
[1:51:12] eternal life doesn't mean it's only for
[1:51:13] the bride there are other classes of
[1:51:15] people amen so we're so thankful that uh
[1:51:20] he gave us this election he adopted us
[1:51:24] as Sons and Daughters he he chose us as
[1:51:27] the bride right so what else can we ask
[1:51:30] for
[1:51:31] amen whether we live whether we die
[1:51:33] we're Christ that's why we're living in
[1:51:35] the in the bright age now it's the
[1:51:36] eighth day for us although eight days
[1:51:38] Beyond Millennium right Beyond
[1:51:41] Millennium that's the day it will go
[1:51:42] back from eternity to Eternity again but
[1:51:45] for us we're already living in Heavenly
[1:51:47] places in Christ Jesus and what is
[1:51:49] Heavenly places it's the position in
[1:51:52] Christ we know our position
[1:51:54] oh brothers and sisters I hope I hope
[1:51:57] this is a blessing to you because it's a
[1:51:59] blessing to me
[1:52:00] I just want to thank you for listening I
[1:52:03] know it's a Wednesday
[1:52:05] pray for me as well and uh
[1:52:08] [Applause]
[1:52:11] there's a lot this message says
[1:52:13] 1237 messages so if you
[1:52:16] but uh the thing that we need to be
[1:52:19] ruptured is already in there so we just
[1:52:21] have to dig on it and
[1:52:24] the fivefold Ministries is required for
[1:52:27] the perfecting of the Saints amen that's
[1:52:30] why he uh praise the lord we we have
[1:52:32] such and we just want to impart our our
[1:52:35] little gifts maybe so if uh
[1:52:38] yeah if if the Lord Paris because the
[1:52:41] bread needs to be perfected needs to be
[1:52:43] matured and how can he be matured under
[1:52:46] the presence of the son which is the
[1:52:48] word made flesh today through US amen
[1:52:52] God doesn't speak directly to us because
[1:52:55] uh but he does that in a prophetic way
[1:52:58] one of the fivefold ministry is a
[1:53:00] prophet right but that's not the major
[1:53:02] prophet all the fivefold in Ephesians 4
[1:53:05] 11 will fall under the under this
[1:53:07] message of the hour and we're clear with
[1:53:09] that that the rapturing faith lies in
[1:53:12] this message and we're thankful amen we
[1:53:15] have the the Vindicated Prophet we can
[1:53:17] see we have the written word
[1:53:19] we have the message of the hour which is
[1:53:21] the spoken word right and we have the
[1:53:23] manifestation
[1:53:24] vindicate to vindicate that the spoken
[1:53:27] word and the written word are correct
[1:53:30] right and we're so thankful because the
[1:53:31] thing is uh even by science how can you
[1:53:35] even by time you will see where what day
[1:53:39] we are living in amen we are the end
[1:53:41] time brothers and sisters and and we're
[1:53:43] so thankful I'll invite the musicians
[1:53:45] and uh
[1:53:47] and brother Berry
[1:53:50] so I hope it's a blessing to you
[1:53:51] brothers and sisters and uh
[1:53:53] pray for me as well
[1:53:55] this Sunday I'll be in Spruce Grove so
[1:54:00] yeah for two Services brother Jerry
[1:54:03] invited me to speak for him
[1:54:06] I might expound a little bit also but
[1:54:10] this is burberry is saying this will be
[1:54:13] your warm-up but uh
[1:54:16] but uh yeah God bless you
[1:54:18] amen
[1:54:21] [Applause]
[1:54:26] did you enjoy that tonight maybe stand
[1:54:28] with me
[1:54:32] certainly love the thought
[1:54:35] you know there's so much there but it
[1:54:36] all comes down to one thing and that is
[1:54:38] recognizing who we are and
[1:54:41] I'm looking for a visual of that
[1:54:43] triangle like he said with no mortar in
[1:54:46] it
[1:54:47] nothing between
[1:54:50] seeing that Capstone come right down on
[1:54:52] top of it and I was just thinking about
[1:54:54] it when we were looking at it tonight
[1:54:55] you know it shows the the seven Church
[1:54:59] ages and then it shows Christ and in the
[1:55:02] middle I believe it shows love in
[1:55:05] between the two and I think it's still
[1:55:07] depicting that there's a space between
[1:55:09] the two and I think there's coming a day
[1:55:11] where there isn't going to be a space
[1:55:12] between the two where we're going to
[1:55:14] start talking about it being one
[1:55:15] triangle the only thing that's missing
[1:55:17] is two little lines to make it one
[1:55:20] complete triangle that's the only thing
[1:55:22] that would change it I think it's a
[1:55:24] wonderful wonderful depiction that we
[1:55:27] saw tonight let's just bow in prayer
[1:55:30] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[1:55:32] you for your goodness to us Lord
[1:55:34] we thank you for the reassuring Lord
[1:55:37] Jesus
[1:55:38] to know that you have already chosen us
[1:55:42] way before we were even formed in our
[1:55:44] mother's womb
[1:55:45] Lord Jesus before there was even a speck
[1:55:49] of Stardust you had us in your mind Lord
[1:55:52] Jesus and father to to try and even
[1:55:55] comprehend that you being the great
[1:55:57] creator
[1:55:59] you you you
[1:56:01] condescended into the the body of human
[1:56:04] flesh Lord Jesus to try and reveal
[1:56:07] yourself to mankind
[1:56:09] and Lord Jesus tonight
[1:56:11] we recognize that you have done that
[1:56:14] once again
[1:56:15] but not the way you did the First Time
[1:56:17] Lord
[1:56:18] the way you chose to the second time and
[1:56:21] that's by your spirit and we know that
[1:56:24] the true identification of having that
[1:56:26] spirit in US is the ability to receive
[1:56:29] all of the word for our day
[1:56:32] not everyone can do that and if we can
[1:56:34] do that we have reason to rejoice
[1:56:37] father we love you and we thank you
[1:56:39] tonight for your goodness to us thank
[1:56:40] you for revealing yourself to us just a
[1:56:43] little further Lord for speaking to us
[1:56:45] about election Lord Jesus recognizing
[1:56:48] there's nothing that we've ever done in
[1:56:50] our lives there's nothing that we could
[1:56:52] ever do the only thing we could do is
[1:56:54] just Express that life that's within us
[1:56:58] and Lord we know that it's such a
[1:57:01] beautiful thing to look at the life of
[1:57:02] the the the the plant the the wheat
[1:57:06] knowing that there's a seed and it goes
[1:57:08] back to a seed but it's not even the the
[1:57:10] plant that we're interested in it's the
[1:57:12] life that's in the plant and father we
[1:57:15] pray that that life that very life would
[1:57:17] just live out through your children as
[1:57:19] we leave here tonight father we pray

[1:57:48] but father we're we're looking to that
[1:57:50] great day of resurrection and Rapture
[1:57:52] Lord as we heard about there had to be a
[1:57:55] fulfillment of scripture that had to be
[1:57:57] an amount of time that went by and

[1:58:13] those who couldn't make it tonight for
[1:58:15] whatever reason wherever they are
[1:58:17] whatever they're doing father we pray
