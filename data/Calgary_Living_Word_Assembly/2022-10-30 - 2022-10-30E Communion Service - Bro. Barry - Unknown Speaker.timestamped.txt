[42:33] with you father Lord Jesus that we're
[42:36] willing to display the outward
[42:37] expression of the inward work lord it's
[42:40] not a badge that we wear or a card that

[43:54] amen God bless you musicians thank you
[43:57] tonight if you have your Bibles I'd like
[43:59] to read from Exodus chapter 12.
[44:02] and then I would like to get into the
[44:04] maybe a couple of the gospels and
[44:06] hopefully not keep us too long
[44:09] maybe try and keep it to a half an hour
[44:11] so we don't keep everyone too late
[44:13] tonight
[44:14] but we'll just see what the Lord says
[44:16] about it all
[44:19] certainly wonderful to be in service
[44:21] once again
[44:23] communion service that we know he has
[44:27] given us as an ordinance
[44:30] Exodus chapter 12 verse 13.
[44:36] and the blood shall be to you for a
[44:39] token
[44:40] upon the houses where ye are
[44:43] and when I see the blood I will pass
[44:45] over you
[44:47] and the plague shall not be upon you to
[44:49] destroy you when I smite the land of
[44:52] Egypt
[44:54] you turn over the page
[44:56] and read Exodus chapter 12.
[45:00] verse 23.
[45:04] first we had the word coming to the
[45:06] prophet
[45:08] then we had the prophet bringing the
[45:10] word to the people here that we're going
[45:11] to read in Exodus 12 23.
[45:15] for the Lord will pass through and
[45:16] through to Smite the Egyptians
[45:19] and when he seeth the blood upon the
[45:21] lintel and upon the two side posts the
[45:24] Lord will pass over the door and will
[45:27] not suffer the Destroyer to come in unto
[45:30] your houses to Smite you
[45:32] and ye shall observe this thing for an
[45:35] ordinance to thee and to thy Sons
[45:38] forever
[45:39] and it shall come to pass when ye shall
[45:41] come to the land which the Lord will
[45:44] give you according as he hath promised
[45:47] that ye shall keep this service
[45:50] and it shall come to pass when your
[45:52] children shall say unto you what mean ye
[45:54] by this service
[45:56] that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of
[45:58] the Lord's Passover
[46:03] who passed over the houses of the
[46:05] children
[46:06] of Israel and Egypt
[46:08] when he smote the Egyptians and
[46:10] delivered our houses
[46:13] and the people bowed the head and
[46:15] worshiped
[46:16] let's just bow in prayer
[46:19] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we know
[46:21] that the scripture is
[46:23] written for a purpose Lord Jesus that
[46:25] all scripture is given for Lord Jesus
[46:28] instruction
[46:30] Lord Jesus for repu Lord for our benefit
[46:34] Lord Jesus
[46:36] father tonight we pray that you would
[46:37] just be glorified in all that's said and
[46:39] done we thank you for your word we pray
[46:41] that you would just speak to us once
[46:43] again father and that Lord in every
[46:45] aspect of this service that you would be
[46:47] glorified we just ask all these things
[46:49] now and Jesus Christ made me pray
[46:52] amen God bless you tonight you may be
[46:54] seated
[47:06] it's a wonderful thing to get into his
[47:08] presence
[47:09] to know where we stand
[47:13] this is not just an ordinary time when
[47:15] we gather together in church like this
[47:17] we know that it's a communion service
[47:19] but it's not just an ordinary communion
[47:22] service every one of these could be the
[47:25] very last one that we experience on this
[47:27] side of Eternity
[47:28] it's just a beautiful thing to take a
[47:30] look at this scripture here and
[47:33] recognize that when we talk about
[47:35] communion service it's about the last
[47:37] supper and the Last Supper is about the
[47:39] Passover and the Passover is what we
[47:42] just read That's the final plague that
[47:44] came to Egypt and that was prophesied
[47:47] even further back before this and I'm
[47:49] sorry I didn't get it tonight but it's
[47:50] such a beautiful thing he is the same
[47:52] yesterday today and forever and he
[47:54] doesn't change his ways and he doesn't
[47:56] change his nature he is the same and and
[47:59] to look at this scripture and and think
[48:01] that the LA the the the the Passover is
[48:05] exactly the the Last Supper that Jesus
[48:08] sat down to to fellowship with the
[48:10] disciples
[48:12] and it's just beautiful in Exodus
[48:15] chapter 12 here because we can see that
[48:18] you know the word of the Lord came to
[48:20] the prophet we read earlier on but then
[48:23] we read where the word of the Lord From
[48:25] The Prophet was given to the people just
[48:27] like we talked about in Joshua's day
[48:29] when when Joshua the last address the
[48:33] second last address for the children of
[48:34] Israel was the the the prophet speaking
[48:39] to the children of Israel saying you
[48:41] know this is what the Lord has done for
[48:42] us let's not forget it it was it was a
[48:45] man in his office speaking but then the
[48:47] last chapter is the same thing the same
[48:50] call to action but only thus saith the
[48:53] Lord the word of God coming to the
[48:55] people through the prophet and we have
[48:58] that example right here in Exodus
[48:59] chapter 12 and it says ye shall observe
[49:02] this thing for an ordinance to thee into
[49:05] thy Sons forever and you might be
[49:07] thinking well brother Barry this was
[49:08] about the Passover supper but we're
[49:11] talking about doing a communion service
[49:13] tonight and and the body of the Lord
[49:15] Jesus Christ and being able to take that
[49:17] blood and strike the lentils and the
[49:20] doorposts in our lives in our homes and
[49:23] we know that all of this was a shadow
[49:25] and type of that very thing happening of
[49:28] the Lamb the the male lamb coming to be
[49:31] sacrificed for all of mankind and
[49:34] without this there wouldn't be that and
[49:37] without that we wouldn't have the token
[49:39] to apply in our very homes
[49:42] in our lives I think it's just beautiful
[49:44] I want to explore the discussion uh of
[49:47] communion and I think as we have the
[49:49] community services moving forward we
[49:51] probably will do this as I said I'm
[49:53] going to try to not take too long with
[49:55] it
[49:57] excuse me
[49:59] um but I want to talk about foot washing
[50:01] as well so we're going to talk about
[50:02] communion first we'll go through that a
[50:04] little bit and uh and just see I want to
[50:07] make sure that we have a scriptural
[50:08] basis the foundation is that this is in
[50:11] the word this isn't something that we
[50:12] just do because William Mary and Branham
[50:14] came along and said let's have communion
[50:16] service and let's get together and do
[50:17] this this is an ordinance that we're
[50:19] supposed to keep forever to remember
[50:20] what the Lord has done for us to
[50:23] remember that our Brethren who were in
[50:25] Egypt they were actually delivered by
[50:28] their obedience unto the word and it's
[50:30] not going to be any different for us
[50:31] today brothers and sisters if we don't
[50:33] take and apply that blood
[50:35] to the lintel and to the doorposts in
[50:37] our lives in our homes and our families
[50:39] then that Death Angel has the right to
[50:42] to strike Our Lives has the right to
[50:45] pass over our house and I can promise
[50:47] you in this age that Death Angel is
[50:49] going to pass over our houses
[50:52] and we need to make sure that we have
[50:53] that blood applied properly
[50:56] how do we do that we just take the
[50:57] orders that the lord gave us through the
[51:00] Vindicated prophet in our day how did
[51:02] they do it in Noah's day they just took
[51:04] the orders that the lord gave the
[51:05] prophet in his day and that was simply
[51:08] to get in the boat and you know brother
[51:09] Bradham says there was three given to
[51:11] him and one of them was water baptism in
[51:14] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to be
[51:16] baptized any other way you needed to be
[51:18] re-baptized it was the same thing as the
[51:20] book of Acts the other one was communion
[51:22] service the other one was foot washing
[51:24] and you know if we take all three of
[51:26] those and we exercise all three of those
[51:28] as message Believers in our lives then I
[51:30] want to say this plainly and maybe I'll
[51:32] be
[51:33] raked over the calls for it but you're a
[51:35] message believer when you exercise all
[51:37] three of those because that's what the
[51:39] prophet said to do
[51:40] and it's interesting when you don't
[51:42] exercise all three of those
[51:44] are you really exercising all that the
[51:46] prophet said to do
[51:48] you really believe all of the message of
[51:50] the hour
[51:51] and you know
[51:52] it just comes down to this it's going to
[51:55] get this way I know it we can say we've
[51:57] got this and we've got that and we've
[51:58] got the other thing there's this reason
[52:00] there's not reason there's the other
[52:01] reason and imagine if the children of
[52:03] Israel said you know there's this reason
[52:04] there's that reason there's the other
[52:05] reason I can't put the blood on the
[52:07] lentils in the doorpost I just can't do
[52:09] it for whatever whatever my job whatever
[52:11] my family whatever my thing is if if the
[52:14] people did that what would happen
[52:16] the death angel would strike is no
[52:19] different today brothers and sisters the
[52:21] only thing is we're not witnessing it on
[52:24] a on a on a natural tangible scale what
[52:26] we are witnessing is that the devil's
[52:28] coming for our kids we are witnessing
[52:30] that the devil's coming for our marriage
[52:32] we are witnessing that that Death Angel
[52:34] is passing over the land the anointing
[52:36] is way more than we can stand on our own
[52:38] if we think that we can withstand it
[52:40] we're mistaken we will be overcome by
[52:43] the spirit of this age because brother
[52:45] Bradham says it very clearly to reject
[52:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:50] is to accept the mark of the beast
[52:53] so all this business about vaccines and
[52:55] all of that I I you know whatever it's
[52:59] irrelevant
[53:01] because brother Branham said the marker
[53:03] of the Beast is rejecting the word of
[53:05] God it's not a vaccine it's it's it's
[53:07] not a movement where you put a flag
[53:10] behind your truck and you say you know
[53:12] whatever you want to say it's got
[53:14] nothing to do with any of that and it's
[53:16] a trick of the devil for people to think
[53:18] that they're actually preventing
[53:19] something when all they're doing is
[53:21] joining up and they don't even realize
[53:23] it now that's what brother Branham said
[53:24] one day you're going to recognize
[53:27] that you've taken the mark of the beast
[53:28] and there's nothing you can do about it
[53:30] and how do you do that how do you do
[53:32] that brothers and sisters you reject the
[53:35] ordinance the direction that was given
[53:37] to us through the prophet of our day
[53:40] excuse me
[53:42] because what does the word say
[53:44] the word we'll get to this a little bit
[53:46] later tonight but the word says if you
[53:47] know these things happy are ye
[53:51] if you know these things happy are ye we
[53:54] talked about it this morning what
[53:55] happens when we're done a communion
[53:56] service I I many times every time when I
[53:59] walk out of here I feel like I'm flying
[54:01] out of here I don't feel like I'm
[54:02] walking out of here something happens to
[54:04] us when we have a communion service
[54:06] because we know these things and we're
[54:08] happy because we participate in it
[54:10] because we have the ability to but you
[54:13] know brothers and sisters we can't take
[54:14] it lightly not everyone has the ability
[54:16] to come to a communion service
[54:17] not everyone has the ability to get down
[54:19] and humble themselves before a brother
[54:21] or a sister and watch their feet it
[54:23] sounds like it's a simple thing but it's
[54:25] not
[54:27] but I want to say God bless each one for
[54:28] coming out to have the courage to do
[54:30] that because it's not me it's something
[54:32] inside of you that's causing it to
[54:34] happen something when you hear that word
[54:36] spoken is stimulated it's it's a
[54:39] stimulation of that Revelation it's in
[54:41] your life
[54:43] I can see that I'm talking more than I
[54:45] really should be let's turn over to
[54:46] Matthew 26 26.
[54:49] just want to really show that there's a
[54:51] scriptural identification for this in
[54:53] the Bible it's not just something that
[54:55] we do because brother Branham said to do
[54:57] it this is something that's in the Bible
[54:59] it's in the word for us
[55:04] just showing the scriptural
[55:06] identification for it
[55:09] Matthew 26 26.
[55:11] and as they were eating Jesus Took bread
[55:13] and blessed it and break it and gave it
[55:16] to the disciples and said take eat
[55:19] this is my body
[55:22] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[55:24] gave it to them saying drinky
[55:27] all of it
[55:29] for this is my blood
[55:31] of the new testament which is shed for
[55:33] many
[55:34] for the remission of sins
[55:37] but I say unto you I will not drink
[55:38] henceforth of this fruit of the vine
[55:41] until that day
[55:43] when I drink it new with you in my
[55:46] father's Kingdom
[55:48] can you imagine brothers and sisters
[55:51] he's not going to drink it until he can
[55:53] drink it new with you
[55:54] in his father's Kingdom
[55:56] he's waiting for us you know we talked
[55:59] about it a while ago how we're waiting
[56:01] for him to come we're waiting for the
[56:02] coming of the Lord the arrival of him in
[56:04] the clouds the the secret sudden going
[56:07] away of the Bride of Jesus Christ but
[56:09] how much more is he waiting for us
[56:11] the ones that he created in him has
[56:13] anybody ever had a a birthday or
[56:16] something special they've wanted to do
[56:18] for someone and you have something
[56:19] special that's a secret that you want to
[56:21] give to them because you want to see
[56:23] that surprise think about the surprise
[56:25] that he's got coming for each one of us
[56:27] that gift of eternal life that gift of a
[56:30] perfect body that gift of no pressure in
[56:33] your life that gift of no sin that gift
[56:35] of no condemnation he's waiting
[56:37] patiently for us to come to that place
[56:40] it's such a tremendous thought let's go
[56:42] to Mark 14 verse 22.
[56:46] okay
[56:47] it's just such a an amazing thing to
[56:50] think that he is waiting for us we think
[56:53] we're waiting for him
[56:57] he's just waiting for that fruit to get
[56:58] ripe for that fruit to get to the place
[57:01] where it needs to be Mark 14 22.
[57:07] and as they did eat Jesus Took bread and
[57:09] blessed and break it and gave it to them
[57:12] and said take eat this is my body
[57:15] and he took the cup and when he had
[57:17] given thanks he gave it to them and they
[57:19] all drank of it
[57:21] and he said unto them this is my blood
[57:23] of the new testament which is shed for
[57:26] many verily I say unto you I will drink
[57:28] no more of the fruit of the vine until
[57:30] that day that I drink it new in the
[57:34] kingdom of God
[57:37] let's go quickly over to Luke 22.
[57:45] these are the
[57:47] the scriptural accounts the historical
[57:50] accounts of this very thing happening
[57:53] they were celebrating the Passover that
[57:56] we read in Exodus chapter 12 just before
[57:59] Jesus death
[58:00] that's what was happening verse 15 of
[58:03] Luke chapter 22
[58:05] and he said unto them with this desire
[58:07] I have desired to eat this Passover with
[58:10] you before I suffer
[58:13] for I say unto you I will not anymore
[58:15] eat thereof
[58:17] until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of
[58:19] God and he took the cup and gave thanks
[58:21] and said take this and divide it among
[58:25] yourselves for I say unto you I will not
[58:27] drink of the fruit of the vine until the
[58:29] kingdom of God shall come and he took
[58:32] the bread and gave thanks and break it
[58:34] and gave unto them saying this is my
[58:36] body which is given for you this do in
[58:39] remembrance of me likewise also the cup
[58:42] after supper saying
[58:44] this cup
[58:45] is the New Testament in my blood which
[58:48] is shed for you
[58:51] you know these are Divine orders that
[58:54] that were given to the church and it's
[58:57] so beautiful when we can recognize that
[58:59] God sent a prophet and and that he is a
[59:02] prophet that he was a prophet but his
[59:04] voice that we hear on the recorded tapes
[59:06] and the words that we read on the
[59:08] printed books it's it's a life it's
[59:10] alive you know when we talk like this I
[59:14] would say this we don't have to wait for
[59:15] brother Brown to come back because we
[59:17] can hear his voice every single day that
[59:20] we want to all we have to do is open a
[59:22] book or just press play but you know
[59:24] these orders that were given unto the
[59:26] church by Jesus were in the Bible
[59:29] but the prophet for eye day just brought
[59:32] them forward and said look you just need
[59:33] to do this it's an order it's a divine
[59:36] order that God has given the church and
[59:37] we know many churches have done it many
[59:39] churches have probably done it maybe a
[59:41] little more religious wise and and maybe
[59:43] more holy but we're just talking about
[59:45] the Church of the firstborn those truly
[59:48] elected who are going to go on the
[59:50] Rapture the ones who truly believe the
[59:52] word for our day that's who we're
[59:55] talking about here and and that's the
[59:57] word that was given to the prophet all
[59:59] he did was tie up the Loose Ends he
[1:00:01] never brought anything new all he did
[1:00:02] was magnify the word that was already
[1:00:04] there that was already being sacrificed
[1:00:07] and and and celebrated rather by all of
[1:00:10] the other denominations and they were
[1:00:12] doing it in their own ways I remember
[1:00:13] when I was growing up they were doing it
[1:00:15] with uh Wafers and and uh and uh it was
[1:00:20] grape juice because you couldn't have
[1:00:21] wine wine was a bad thing
[1:00:24] even though it says in the Bible a
[1:00:25] little wine for the stomach's sake but
[1:00:27] you know many people have different
[1:00:29] opinions about it and and I'm not here
[1:00:31] to debate it one way or the other other
[1:00:32] than to say this is the way that we do
[1:00:34] it is the way the prophet did it and and
[1:00:37] we sort of Step Back From the way that
[1:00:39] we used to do it for those people that
[1:00:40] don't know it and uh who knows maybe one
[1:00:42] day we'll go back to that again where it
[1:00:44] was just one cup
[1:00:46] and and I know that that's a debate that
[1:00:48] we could have we could have a big long
[1:00:50] discussion about it but I just think
[1:00:51] with everything that we've gone through
[1:00:53] this this great pandemic and all of the
[1:00:55] illness we do want to be a little bit
[1:00:57] careful but we did right up until the
[1:00:59] pandemic we did do this with one cup and
[1:01:03] you know I never saw anybody get
[1:01:05] terribly sick from it
[1:01:07] I don't believe in my own heart that if
[1:01:10] we truly believe when we go and take
[1:01:12] from that cup that anyone will get sick
[1:01:14] from it that's my own personal opinion
[1:01:16] but I'm not going to try and push that
[1:01:18] to the church because I know there's
[1:01:19] some people that just won't buy it and
[1:01:21] you know that's fine
[1:01:23] so right now just because of covid and
[1:01:25] the way things are that's why we're
[1:01:27] doing it this way with the individual
[1:01:28] cups and we just want to make it
[1:01:30] possible for everyone to partake of it
[1:01:32] we don't want to make anybody
[1:01:33] uncomfortable but brothers and sisters
[1:01:35] when we truly believe the word of God
[1:01:37] there ain't no disease that can stand in
[1:01:39] our way there ain't nothing that can
[1:01:40] stand in your doorway when you've
[1:01:42] applied the blood to the lintel and the
[1:01:44] doorposts and that's what we're talking
[1:01:45] about tonight understanding that this is
[1:01:47] way more than just a little exercise
[1:01:49] that we do because someone said that we
[1:01:51] should do it because brother Barry
[1:01:53] harped on it and said you know if you
[1:01:54] really believe you'll come to a
[1:01:55] communion service well you know it's
[1:01:57] more than that it's got to be way more
[1:01:59] than that it's got to be the life of
[1:02:01] Jesus Christ Living out through us out
[1:02:03] of communion brother Bradham he says now
[1:02:05] I do believe that communion or what we
[1:02:07] call communion now is to talk is the
[1:02:10] Lord's suffer
[1:02:11] now we only have three physical Divine
[1:02:14] orders left to us one of them is
[1:02:16] communion
[1:02:17] feet washing water baptism that's the
[1:02:20] only three things
[1:02:22] doesn't that make it simple
[1:02:24] but yet it can be so complicated in our
[1:02:27] lives those are the only three Divine
[1:02:29] orders that we have left communion feet
[1:02:32] washing water baptism he says that's the
[1:02:36] Perfection of the three see that's the
[1:02:38] only three orders we have we realize
[1:02:40] that that was the issue given by Saint
[1:02:43] Paul in the New Testament and you know
[1:02:45] you don't have to look very far it can
[1:02:47] be a very difficult thing for people to
[1:02:49] just follow those three simple orders
[1:02:51] that brother Branham said were given to
[1:02:53] the church by God it wasn't brother
[1:02:55] Branham giving to them to the church
[1:02:58] but it's uh it's a real step of Faith to
[1:03:01] be able to look beyond that and you know
[1:03:03] we said it this morning and I'll say it
[1:03:04] again tonight if we have something in
[1:03:05] our hearts that condemns us where we
[1:03:08] feel like we can't come to the communion
[1:03:09] table what that is is the holy spirit
[1:03:11] saying just deal with that thing just go
[1:03:13] and deal with that thing and there's
[1:03:14] instructions in the word for how to deal
[1:03:16] with that thing whatever that thing is
[1:03:17] there's instructions in that word if
[1:03:19] we're willing to take the Lord add his
[1:03:21] word
[1:03:22] brother Bradham goes on to say in
[1:03:23] communion now if we would say the
[1:03:27] communion should just be taking the word
[1:03:29] I don't believe anyone has a right to
[1:03:31] take the Lord's Supper until he has
[1:03:33] taken the word of the Lord into his
[1:03:36] heart see
[1:03:39] because I'm I'm going to read something
[1:03:41] for you in a few moments and and you'll
[1:03:43] see now notice then
[1:03:46] why we would
[1:03:48] on the same basis we could absolutely
[1:03:51] justify the Salvation Army
[1:03:53] they do not believe in any form of water
[1:03:56] baptism said we don't need it
[1:03:59] now if we don't need water baptism why
[1:04:02] are we baptized
[1:04:04] said the water can't save you it's the
[1:04:07] blood that saves you
[1:04:10] I'll agree with that
[1:04:12] that's right the blood saves you not the
[1:04:15] water
[1:04:15] but we must take the water as an outward
[1:04:18] emotion that an inwardly work of Grace
[1:04:22] has been done see
[1:04:24] so we must on communion
[1:04:27] it's something that he's given to us as
[1:04:29] an instruction to go forwards to
[1:04:30] recognize just like we do black water
[1:04:33] baptism it's an outward expression of
[1:04:35] the inward work that's happened to us we
[1:04:37] have truly repented and we truly do want
[1:04:40] to be baptized correctly according to
[1:04:42] Christian baptism
[1:04:44] just like we want to apply the blood to
[1:04:46] our homes to our lives we want that
[1:04:49] token we're on display not just to say
[1:04:51] that we've got it
[1:04:53] he goes on to say when we've taken when
[1:04:56] we have taken the Lord our sacrifice
[1:04:58] into us as a matter of spiritual birth
[1:05:00] into us and his body we live by him the
[1:05:03] word
[1:05:04] we also should symbolize it because it's
[1:05:07] a commandment
[1:05:09] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:05:11] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:05:13] remission of your sins
[1:05:14] we do it because we want to actually
[1:05:17] show
[1:05:18] everyone around us and all the Devils
[1:05:21] around us that there's something that's
[1:05:23] taken place inside of here there is a
[1:05:25] Formula that entitles me to the token
[1:05:27] and I'm going to go all the way to
[1:05:29] receive that token and I don't care what
[1:05:31] anybody thinks we all have to come to
[1:05:33] that place and it can be one of the most
[1:05:35] humbling things in our lives to say that
[1:05:37] you know what I recognize that this man
[1:05:39] William Marion Branham said that you
[1:05:41] can't be baptized truly in Christian
[1:05:44] baptism if you're baptized in titles
[1:05:48] that's a humbling thought
[1:05:50] and you know the biggest thing the
[1:05:51] biggest hindrance with that is pride the
[1:05:53] original sin that's what came in the in
[1:05:55] the in in heaven right when the devil
[1:05:58] stood up and and said I'm gonna be just
[1:06:01] like the most high there was something
[1:06:03] that was working up in his heart for
[1:06:05] somebody to actually get correction by
[1:06:07] the word to say that you need to be
[1:06:09] baptized properly or you need to go to
[1:06:11] communion service you need to partake in
[1:06:13] this
[1:06:14] if we say oh I can't do it something
[1:06:17] holds us back from it if we're not
[1:06:18] willing to go and do what we need to do
[1:06:20] to take those steps to fix it so that we
[1:06:22] can go there's something in our heart
[1:06:24] that's just not right
[1:06:25] he says this do in remembrance of me
[1:06:29] he goes on to say brother Brad I'm in
[1:06:30] communion 1965 the very last recorded
[1:06:33] message it's a half hour message it's
[1:06:35] well worth listening to
[1:06:37] um as we do the communion Services going
[1:06:39] forwards I'm going to draw upon this
[1:06:40] message I'm starting at the very
[1:06:42] beginning and this is the very first few
[1:06:44] statements in this message he said Paul
[1:06:46] said I have received of the Lord that
[1:06:48] which also I delivered unto you this is
[1:06:50] Corinthians that we're going to read
[1:06:51] tonight
[1:06:53] um I think it's Corinthians that the
[1:06:55] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:06:57] was betrayed took bread and break it and
[1:06:59] gave it to the disciples and said take
[1:07:01] eat this is this do in remembrance of me
[1:07:05] for as often
[1:07:07] as you take this bread you show forth
[1:07:10] his life till he comes now we find out
[1:07:13] that they had people who come
[1:07:17] there's people that actually came in and
[1:07:19] were willing to follow the instruction
[1:07:21] of the Prophet follow the instruction of
[1:07:24] the word this is what Paul preached and
[1:07:26] this is what brother Branham preached
[1:07:28] and that's why this is what we preach
[1:07:30] we're going to say the very same things
[1:07:32] we're not going to try and bring in
[1:07:33] anything new but the only thing I want
[1:07:35] to do brothers and sisters is just make
[1:07:37] sure that we understand this is a very
[1:07:39] scripturally identified ordinance an
[1:07:41] order of the lord it's not something
[1:07:42] that we're just saying that William Mary
[1:07:44] and Branham brought to the world and and
[1:07:46] because he brought it and and he's got
[1:07:48] the signs wonders and miracles in his
[1:07:50] life and his ministry that we're just
[1:07:51] going to follow it blindly we are going
[1:07:53] to follow it but we're going to say hey
[1:07:54] there is a scriptural identification to
[1:07:57] that and we want to be able to show our
[1:07:58] children when they say what what meaneth
[1:08:00] these these Stones what what is this why
[1:08:02] do we do this why do we come to a
[1:08:04] communion service because it's
[1:08:05] scripturally identified God gave it to
[1:08:07] the children of Israel for the Passover
[1:08:09] Jesus sat down with the disciples and he
[1:08:12] showed them the Lord's Supper he
[1:08:14] actually broke his body could you
[1:08:16] imagine that they didn't even recognize
[1:08:18] what was going on in that moment they
[1:08:20] didn't even know what he was saying to
[1:08:21] them but they found out very soon and I
[1:08:24] believe as we go forwards brothers and
[1:08:25] sisters this world is just about fit to
[1:08:27] change just about fit to change
[1:08:30] and one day it'll just change and it'll
[1:08:32] be gone it'll be over it it will never
[1:08:34] be able to go back and you know
[1:08:36] unfortunately it will just be three and
[1:08:37] a half years left the worst three and a
[1:08:40] half years in the history of mankind and
[1:08:42] you know the bride will be in in the
[1:08:44] castle she'll be in the in the mansion
[1:08:47] with her King she'll be there and then
[1:08:49] he'll just say excuse me one second
[1:08:51] honey I just need to go down and reveal
[1:08:53] myself to my brethren and that's when
[1:08:55] you know it's just gonna change it's
[1:08:57] just gonna be glorious and you know
[1:08:58] we're moments just moments away from
[1:09:00] that it can feel like an eternity it can
[1:09:03] feel like a lifetime you know as even as
[1:09:05] adults it feels the same way when we
[1:09:07] think about the Rapture when we're
[1:09:08] children we might think you know I sure
[1:09:10] wish that I could have the freedom to
[1:09:12] just have my own car and get in the car
[1:09:14] and just go and drive somewhere and it
[1:09:15] can seem like a lifetime to get to the
[1:09:18] place where we have that freedom it can
[1:09:19] feel the same way for an adult we're
[1:09:21] children or all children of the most
[1:09:23] high God having that desire to just be
[1:09:25] able to travel like a thought to know
[1:09:27] that we're going to that place brothers
[1:09:29] and sisters we just need to have
[1:09:30] patients and the only thing we need to
[1:09:32] do is just keep walking according to
[1:09:34] this word that we've been given by the
[1:09:35] prophet they just needed to walk
[1:09:36] according to the word that was given to
[1:09:38] Noah you know Noah had the the ministry
[1:09:41] was just simply get in the boat and we
[1:09:42] just need to Simply follow these three
[1:09:44] ordinances it sounds very easy but it's
[1:09:47] easier said than done in the life of a
[1:09:49] believer in the day in which we live
[1:09:51] I would just like to change the order of
[1:09:52] the service now and actually go into the
[1:09:55] communion service I would like to invite
[1:09:57] the deacons to come the musicians if you

[1:10:08] Service I really do believe that I could
[1:10:11] go on and on about this so I'm not I'm
[1:10:14] not saying that I I don't have the
[1:10:17] desire to but I just want to be mindful

[1:10:23] this is something that we've been given
[1:10:24] by the Lord through the prophet and and
