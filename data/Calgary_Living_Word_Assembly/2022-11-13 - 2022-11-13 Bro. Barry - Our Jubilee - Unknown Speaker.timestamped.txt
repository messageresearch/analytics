[48:38] have your Bibles this morning I'd like
[48:40] to read from
[48:41] Leviticus chapter 25
[48:44] I just can't help it brother Gilbert
[48:46] he got me inspired on Wednesday so
[48:50] I want to talk about Jubilee I want to
[48:53] talk about just any Jubilee I want to
[48:55] talk about our Jubilee today
[48:58] Leviticus chapter 25
[49:03] sure enjoyed that service on Wednesday
[49:08] start reading with verse 8
[49:10] and then I want to turn over to
[49:11] Revelations chapter 3.
[49:17] Leviticus 25 verse 8.
[49:22] and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[49:25] years unto thee
[49:27] seven times seven years
[49:30] and the space
[49:32] of the seven sabbaths of years shall be
[49:36] unto thee forty and nine years
[49:39] then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the
[49:42] Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the
[49:45] seventh month
[49:46] the day of atonement shall ye make the
[49:48] trumpet sound throughout all your land
[49:51] and ye shall hallow the 50th year and
[49:53] Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land
[49:56] unto all the inhabitants thereof and it
[49:59] shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall
[50:02] return every man unto his possession
[50:06] and ye shall return every man unto his
[50:09] family
[50:10] let's turn over to Revelations chapter 3
[50:13] the Joshua would you mind turning the
[50:15] monitors just down
[50:17] I'm getting an echo
[50:23] Revelations chapter 3
[50:26] verse 19.
[50:31] very familiar scripture
[50:34] speaking about the laodicean church
[50:39] we know that the laodicean church age
[50:43] has basically come to an end
[50:47] and we're living in a new age
[50:50] maybe we're a new age Church my
[50:55] Revelations 3 verse 19 as many as I love
[50:58] I rebuke and chasten be zealous
[51:00] therefore and repent
[51:02] behold I stand at the door and knock
[51:06] If any man hear my voice and open the
[51:08] door I will come into him and will sup
[51:10] with him and he with me
[51:13] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[51:16] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[51:18] overcame and I'm set down with my father
[51:21] in his throne
[51:23] he that hath an ear
[51:25] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[51:28] the churches
[51:31] chapter 4.
[51:34] verse 1.
[51:36] after this I looked and behold a door
[51:39] was open in heaven
[51:41] in the first voice which I heard was as
[51:44] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[51:47] which said come up hither and I will
[51:50] show thee things which must be hereafter
[51:53] and immediately
[51:55] I was in the spirit
[51:57] let's just bow one more time
[52:00] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[52:02] you for your word thank you for your
[52:04] tender loving kindness to us father
[52:07] Lord Jesus we just ask that we could get
[52:09] out of the way father the here and the
[52:11] speaker and Lord that we could just all
[52:13] give you the preeminence this morning
[52:15] Father Lord that we could just be one
[52:17] today with you father that you would
[52:19] just speak to us that you would have
[52:21] your will and your way in this service
[52:22] Lord Jesus we just ask all these things
[52:25] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[52:27] God bless you this morning you may be
[52:29] seated
[52:32] certainly excited about the word and you
[52:35] know I
[52:36] I just can't
[52:39] I can't understand how we have a service
[52:41] like last week and
[52:43] how we're going to have a service this
[52:44] week
[52:45] and potentially meet or exceed last week
[52:48] I I don't know
[52:50] that baffles me
[52:52] last week was a pretty good service I
[52:53] felt but we certainly trust the Lord
[52:58] just have a few announcements before we
[52:59] get going here and I just wanted to
[53:02] uh
[53:04] thank everyone who came to the Men's
[53:06] breakfast yesterday that was a
[53:07] tremendous time and we'll certainly have
[53:09] more
[53:11] we just uh I wanted to touch on the
[53:13] calendar the calendar is out and uh
[53:16] a couple of high high level points I
[53:19] guess that we should talk about
[53:22] we're going to have a service on
[53:24] Christmas Day
[53:25] and uh I know that might be
[53:28] shocking for some people but maybe not
[53:30] for others and as I always say there's
[53:33] no pressure for anyone if you want to
[53:35] come come if you don't that's okay
[53:37] I would say this though
[53:40] um just be careful what traditions stand
[53:42] in your way
[53:43] we're not having service in the mid-week
[53:46] it's actually a Sunday and that's
[53:48] probably the only reason I'm doing it
[53:50] but
[53:51] if the creasers can do Christmas service
[53:54] what about the Bride of Jesus Christ
[53:57] so some people will come some people
[53:59] won't I'm not going to be upset do what
[54:01] you want to do it's got to be good for
[54:03] you so we're going to have service uh
[54:05] Christmas Day
[54:06] and we're gonna have a 31st Service as
[54:09] well
[54:10] it's a communion service I'm not going
[54:13] to plan to have a watch Night Service
[54:15] we'll get together and sing a few songs
[54:16] and have communion and then get on with
[54:19] our lives I mean we can probably have
[54:21] service until
[54:23] the next day but I don't really think
[54:25] that's uh something I want to do and
[54:28] maybe a little bit selfishly but it's
[54:30] true there won't be a service on the
[54:32] first which is a Sunday because we'll
[54:34] have a community service on the 31st but
[54:37] uh
[54:38] we will be going away on the first and
[54:41] we'll be gone until the 14th we're going
[54:43] to go and meet up with panettas in the
[54:45] Philippines
[54:46] and take a few services and I think it's
[54:49] not going to be just a few Services as I
[54:51] understand the itinerary is growing and
[54:55] we'll certainly just trust the Lord for
[54:56] that if we can be a blessing to be in
[54:58] his service we certainly want to so
[55:00] we're gonna have a Christmas service on
[55:01] the 25th we won't have a service on the
[55:03] first but we will have a 31st service
[55:06] and we're going to be away from the
[55:08] first to the 14th we'll make sure that
[55:11] we have Services lined up and and
[55:13] brethren in place for that
[55:16] The Men's breakfast as I mentioned was
[55:18] sure sure a good time yesterday thank
[55:20] you everyone who came out and and made
[55:22] it possible the only way it is a success
[55:25] is for participation and you know the
[55:28] food was really good we had three
[55:30] refills of food which was surprising
[55:33] they just kept bringing food and the
[55:36] fellowship was even better it was just a
[55:38] wonderful time if if I did miss anyone
[55:40] in the invitation list I do apologize
[55:43] and I certainly ask that you would just
[55:46] reach out to me and let me know that I
[55:48] missed you
[55:49] um because I don't want to miss you it
[55:51] was nothing intentional I just started
[55:53] to look at the list and wondered if I I
[55:55] missed anyone so if I did miss you it
[55:58] was just a mistake it's not anything
[56:00] personal please feel free to reach out
[56:02] to me so we can get you on that list we
[56:05] will have more meetings and just trust
[56:07] the Lord will bring us closer and closer
[56:08] together
[56:10] are you happy this morning
[56:13] you know I'm gonna just start with a
[56:15] quote today this is the Seal of the
[56:17] Antichrist we're talking about the
[56:19] Jubilee we're not talking about
[56:21] everyone's Jubilee we're talking about
[56:22] our Jubilee today
[56:24] this very day the present tense I am
[56:27] out of the Seal of the Antichrist in
[56:30] 1955. brother Branham says notice when
[56:33] the Jubilee sounded
[56:34] the man could drop his hoe and go home
[56:36] if he wished to
[56:38] but what if he didn't want to
[56:40] now what happened
[56:43] then they must take him down to the
[56:45] judges
[56:46] and the judges take him to the Post
[56:49] they pulled out his ear put it up
[56:51] against the post and board
[56:53] it through with an all
[56:55] and from that time on never no more
[57:00] it was a sign that he could never hear
[57:04] that Jubilee no more
[57:07] it was finished
[57:09] no matter how many jubilees he lived
[57:11] through
[57:13] he would never be able to do it again
[57:15] because he was marked because he
[57:17] rejected
[57:19] you know brothers and sisters talking
[57:20] about our day and its message our
[57:23] Jubilee sound when we come to a service
[57:26] and if we choose to reject what we hear
[57:29] if it's the truth then what's happening
[57:32] is something spiritual is happening to
[57:34] us we're getting it all poked in our
[57:37] spiritual ear and we're not going to be
[57:39] able to hear this message anymore we're
[57:41] going to find ourselves Frozen in time
[57:44] we're going to be stuck in a situation
[57:46] this is an example of what they did in
[57:48] the Old Testament days to the slaves
[57:50] that said hey you know what my master
[57:52] was good
[57:53] I love my master he treats me well he
[57:56] feeds me good there's a couple things
[57:58] that I don't like I don't like that whip
[57:59] that he puts on my back and I don't like
[58:01] the way he treats my wife and my
[58:02] children but you know the rest of it's
[58:04] good we get an education all the stuff
[58:06] that we need in our life is looked after
[58:10] they'll be stuck there they won't it
[58:12] doesn't matter how many more jubilees
[58:13] come along brother Branham says they
[58:16] were stuck in that position we don't
[58:18] ever want to be stuck in that position
[58:21] I just wanted to take a moment and
[58:23] reflect on sort of our discussion
[58:25] yesterday
[58:25] at uh
[58:27] at the Men's breakfast it was such a
[58:29] good time and we just sort of based it
[58:32] on on James 5 16. very familiar
[58:36] scripture confess your faults one to
[58:38] another and pray one for another that ye
[58:40] may be healed the effectual fervent
[58:42] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[58:45] and uh you know I just gave a little bit
[58:48] of an exhortation not long
[58:50] I just took a couple things out of that
[58:52] scripture that I thought were really
[58:54] interesting and you know the word fault
[58:56] to confess your fault one to another you
[58:59] know out of the strongs it's G 3900
[59:02] it says a side slip a lapse or deviation
[59:06] that is unintentional error or willful
[59:10] transgression fall fault offense sin and
[59:14] trespass confess your faults one to
[59:16] another and pray one for the other that
[59:19] you may be healed but you know if we're
[59:20] not willing to confess our faults one to
[59:22] another how can we ever pray for one
[59:24] another
[59:26] and how could we ever expect to be
[59:27] healed
[59:28] if we're not confessing our faults one
[59:30] to another this isn't exclusive to the
[59:32] Brethren by the way this is just a
[59:34] scripture we took for the breakfast just
[59:36] to try and encourage some some spiritual
[59:38] Fellowship amongst the Brethren to
[59:40] recognize there is power behind the word
[59:42] of God and if we're willing to apply it
[59:44] the way we've been given it then we're
[59:46] going to see the results that we're
[59:47] Desiring
[59:48] but you know brother Branham says it's
[59:50] so good I don't think I'd ever heard it
[59:52] before I heard brother Branham say it to
[59:53] do the same thing over and over and over
[59:55] and over and over expecting a different
[59:57] result what's that it's the definition
[59:59] of insanity why would we want to do that
[1:00:01] we need to make sure that we're
[1:00:03] following the word of God in our lives
[1:00:05] and you know the effectual fervent
[1:00:07] prayer of a righteous man a veileth much
[1:00:10] it's not like our prayers just go on out
[1:00:12] into space our prayers are valuable our
[1:00:16] prayers are powerful and you know I
[1:00:18] guarantee you if you haven't had a good
[1:00:21] prayer life and you start to pray
[1:00:22] Satan's going to fight you every single
[1:00:24] inch of that way
[1:00:26] but you have to go just a little bit
[1:00:27] further than what you think is far
[1:00:29] enough and so long as you're willing to
[1:00:31] go that much further what you will do is
[1:00:33] you will start to see success in your
[1:00:35] life you'll start to see victory in your
[1:00:37] life you'll start to see strength
[1:00:38] spiritually speaking in your life the
[1:00:41] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:00:43] man availeth much and effectual I
[1:00:46] thought was one word but I found out in
[1:00:48] the Strong's Concordance it's not listed
[1:00:51] as one word the definition is effectual
[1:00:53] fervent G 1754 to be active efficient
[1:00:59] to be effectual fervent be Mighty and
[1:01:02] show forth self-work effectually in to
[1:01:07] think about it if your brother or sister
[1:01:08] is willing to confess their faults unto
[1:01:11] you you have the ability to be effective
[1:01:14] and efficient in praying for that
[1:01:17] brother or that sister's specific need
[1:01:20] and when you do it availeth much
[1:01:24] that was what we were talking about
[1:01:26] yesterday it was so wonderful I'm just
[1:01:28] going to read the Amplified version of
[1:01:30] this sort of out of James 5 16 it says
[1:01:33] confess to one another Therefore your
[1:01:35] faults your slips your false steps your
[1:01:39] offenses your sins and pray also for one
[1:01:42] another that you may be healed and
[1:01:45] restored to a spiritual tone of mind and
[1:01:48] heart
[1:01:49] the earnest heartfelt continued prayer
[1:01:53] of a righteous man makes tremendous
[1:01:55] power available dynamic in its working
[1:02:00] this is what we talked about yesterday
[1:02:02] encouraging one another by the word
[1:02:05] understanding that we're all going to
[1:02:07] make side steps we're all going to make
[1:02:09] faults we're all going to have failures
[1:02:11] there's going to be problems in our
[1:02:13] lives
[1:02:14] but if we're willing to confess them
[1:02:17] and recognize that we've got issues and
[1:02:19] problems that we maybe we talked about
[1:02:21] yesterday that we can't overcome on our
[1:02:23] own
[1:02:24] when we actually are willing to ask for
[1:02:26] help someone can come on the scene and
[1:02:28] help us
[1:02:29] and the brother mentioned it yesterday
[1:02:30] it was so good remember Daniel he he
[1:02:33] actually he called for help and it took
[1:02:35] 21 days there was something hindering
[1:02:37] his prayer from getting there they heard
[1:02:39] it but he had to fight his way to get
[1:02:41] through to come and answer his prayer
[1:02:43] and that's the way it is for us brothers
[1:02:44] and sisters we sing the song about the
[1:02:46] the mountains and the valleys and you
[1:02:49] know how tremendous it is to have the
[1:02:51] Mountaintop experience but if you go and
[1:02:52] look at the top of the mountains there's
[1:02:54] nothing there there's rocks and snow
[1:02:56] that's it
[1:02:58] where's life life is down in The Valleys
[1:03:01] in the valley is where the fruit grows
[1:03:03] that's where the green stuff is that's
[1:03:05] where the life actually happens that's
[1:03:08] where the water is for the most part
[1:03:09] that's where we live is in The Valleys
[1:03:12] there isn't really a whole lot of Life
[1:03:13] on Top of the mountains though it's
[1:03:15] wonderful to be there
[1:03:17] we're living in an age brothers and
[1:03:19] sisters where I just can't help but
[1:03:21] think the Rapture is any day now
[1:03:23] imminent any day now and and if you
[1:03:26] wonder I've said it before I'll say it
[1:03:28] again today I just feel inspired too you
[1:03:30] know we can look around and see this
[1:03:32] world there's people with tattoos all
[1:03:34] over the place and I mean all over the
[1:03:36] place up their necks and up their arms
[1:03:38] there's piercings there's people
[1:03:40] actually getting body changes Desiring
[1:03:43] to change their bodies they're actually
[1:03:45] teaching body change in school now
[1:03:48] and parents don't have a right to say
[1:03:50] anything about it why is the world going
[1:03:53] that way
[1:03:54] it's the anointing for the age all
[1:03:57] creation is groaning for the
[1:03:58] manifestation of the sons of God and we
[1:04:01] can say here we are we've heard that
[1:04:02] Jubilee sound we know who we are and
[1:04:05] what we're raised up for
[1:04:09] but on Wednesday when brother Gilbert
[1:04:10] was preaching I just thought man there's
[1:04:12] something else a real interesting
[1:04:14] thought isn't it interesting that just
[1:04:18] the last I don't know what it is decade
[1:04:19] or two
[1:04:20] there's an ancestry search there's a
[1:04:23] desire to go back to see where we came
[1:04:26] from there's a desire to take a look
[1:04:28] back at where our DNA comes from where
[1:04:31] where we came from who our family really
[1:04:34] is
[1:04:35] sometimes it's it's joyous sometimes we
[1:04:38] can say maybe we're connected to royalty
[1:04:40] and other times oh my maybe we didn't
[1:04:42] want to know that we were connected to
[1:04:43] those people right it's like that but
[1:04:47] you know isn't that interesting because
[1:04:49] the natural types the spiritual is what
[1:04:51] we believe isn't it and doesn't that
[1:04:54] actually match what the profit for our
[1:04:55] day brought back in the 60s he was
[1:04:57] talking about the abstract title deed
[1:05:00] and understanding that if we came from
[1:05:02] God we'll go back to God and we can't be
[1:05:04] lost
[1:05:07] it's the anointing of the age it just
[1:05:09] became so clear to me Ah that's why
[1:05:11] they're doing it they can't help it
[1:05:12] they're breaking into God's laboratory
[1:05:14] thinking they're doing good for mankind
[1:05:16] and in some ways they are they can tell
[1:05:18] you've got to predisposed disposition
[1:05:20] something in your genes will actually
[1:05:23] allow something to come forward because
[1:05:25] of your family's history but that's the
[1:05:27] natural what about the spiritual we know
[1:05:29] that we heard it on Wednesday that he
[1:05:30] will visit the iniquity of the fathers
[1:05:32] on the third and the fourth generation
[1:05:34] many of the things that we contend with
[1:05:36] is not even our fault
[1:05:39] that's why we heard it yesterday to the
[1:05:41] brothers but to everybody we need to
[1:05:43] remember this the things we do today
[1:05:45] will affect tomorrow the things we do
[1:05:47] today might not even affect us in our
[1:05:49] family today it might affect our
[1:05:51] children it might affect our
[1:05:52] grandchildren
[1:05:54] the life that we live today
[1:05:57] it's amazing to think about
[1:06:00] we know that it doesn't take very long
[1:06:01] when we actually deviate from the word
[1:06:03] boy two generations down they won't even
[1:06:06] know God God will just be like a fairy
[1:06:09] tale to the children if we just deviate
[1:06:11] from the word even a little bit because
[1:06:13] we know just a little tiny deviation
[1:06:15] today is is setting a chorus for a
[1:06:18] Direction that's way off of our charts
[1:06:21] way off of the direction that we would
[1:06:23] want to go if you're going to shoot a
[1:06:24] gun just just to move just a little bit
[1:06:27] you know when snipers shoot their guns
[1:06:29] they actually time their breathing
[1:06:31] in between their shots they actually
[1:06:33] will time their shots in between their
[1:06:35] heartbeat
[1:06:36] that's how much you can't move it's got
[1:06:39] to be exact zeroed brother Branham talks
[1:06:41] about
[1:06:43] we know who we are and what we're raised
[1:06:45] up for and we're talking about our
[1:06:46] Jubilee today I just can't help but
[1:06:49] think that you know in Revelations
[1:06:51] chapter 3 as many as I love I rebuke can
[1:06:54] I chase him be zealous therefore and
[1:06:56] repent we've been given that Jubilee
[1:06:58] sound in our day in our age brother
[1:06:59] Branham he brought and taught the church
[1:07:01] ages the seven Church ages the
[1:07:03] revelation of the seven Church Ages
[1:07:05] which is Jesus Christ and and what it is
[1:07:09] is Jesus Christ throughout all of the
[1:07:10] ages all of the churches how he had a
[1:07:13] man raised up to manifest the word for
[1:07:16] the day we know the word always comes to
[1:07:18] a prophet and that word has come to the
[1:07:20] prophet in our day and we have taken
[1:07:22] that word and we have heard that sound
[1:07:24] and we have been willing to be rebuked
[1:07:26] and chastened and that causes us to be
[1:07:29] zealous
[1:07:30] we recognize he stands at the door and
[1:07:32] knocks If any man hear my voice and open
[1:07:35] the door I will come into him
[1:07:37] I won't just come into his house with
[1:07:39] him I will come into him and sup with
[1:07:42] him
[1:07:43] and he with me
[1:07:45] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:07:47] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:07:50] overcame it I'm sat down with my father
[1:07:52] in his throne he that hath an ear let
[1:07:54] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:07:57] churches
[1:07:58] you've got ears this morning
[1:08:01] we're in the bible study this morning
[1:08:03] and I it was my my lot to take the the
[1:08:06] study and and I just really started into
[1:08:09] this this morning so I got a little bit
[1:08:11] of a warm-up I hope it's gonna be okay
[1:08:14] but isn't it interesting to look at this
[1:08:16] this isn't talking about having physical
[1:08:18] ears every single Church age the
[1:08:21] admonition he who hath an ear let him
[1:08:23] hear what the spirit saith it's actually
[1:08:26] understand be able to recognize and to
[1:08:30] consciously take it in and consume it
[1:08:34] acknowledge it
[1:08:36] but then we go after having ears to hear
[1:08:39] Let Them hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:08:41] the churches what is that Spirit saying
[1:08:44] unto the churches
[1:08:46] verse 4 or first verse 1 of chapter four
[1:08:49] after this I looked and behold there was
[1:08:51] a door open in heaven and the first
[1:08:53] voice which I heard were as of a trumpet
[1:08:58] talking with me
[1:09:00] I just can't help but think you know
[1:09:02] once upon a time I thought that this
[1:09:05] verse here when you would hear a trumpet
[1:09:07] in an orchestra how sharp and and how
[1:09:10] true that sound is of a trumpet we know
[1:09:14] we've heard trumpets in many different
[1:09:15] applications but you know it's a similar
[1:09:18] sort of a thing to hear how sharp and
[1:09:20] true the voice of this trumpet is as
[1:09:24] we've read out of the Book of Leviticus
[1:09:26] in chapter 25 here recognizing that this
[1:09:30] trumpet sounded which was actually a
[1:09:32] voice it was a voice as of a trumpet
[1:09:35] talking with me inviting me to come a
[1:09:38] little higher we have been given that
[1:09:40] opportunity brothers and sisters through
[1:09:42] our Jubilee to come a little higher John
[1:09:44] was a type of the Bride he saw that door
[1:09:47] open in heaven and you know do we see a
[1:09:49] door open in heaven no I don't think we
[1:09:51] see a door open in heaven we see a cloud
[1:09:53] open in heaven we see an opportunity to
[1:09:56] see something different than all the
[1:09:58] rest of the world sees the rest of the
[1:09:59] world will say you know what that was
[1:10:00] just Mr Cloud that was just sunset
[1:10:02] Mountain it was just a neat event there
[1:10:04] was just something special that happened
[1:10:05] with a man of God but you know the Bride
[1:10:07] of Jesus Christ says no no there's way
[1:10:09] more to that picture than meets the eye
[1:10:11] that was actually a door open in heaven
[1:10:13] saying hey my little Bride come a little
[1:10:15] higher if you want to take a look at
[1:10:17] this you will see something that nobody
[1:10:19] else can see but you know only those who
[1:10:21] have ears to hear what the spirit sayeth
[1:10:23] unto the church can actually get what
[1:10:26] the spirit is actually saying
[1:10:29] he's speaking to the hearts of man
[1:10:33] you know I think it's beautiful we're
[1:10:35] gonna we're gonna get going here into uh
[1:10:40] into our thought today our Jubilee
[1:10:43] you know we're gonna take a little bit
[1:10:44] of a roundabout way to get there but I
[1:10:46] trust it'll be okay
[1:10:47] but if Harvest Time 1964.
[1:10:50] brother Branham he's talking about a
[1:10:52] raccoon
[1:10:53] and the behavior of a raccoon
[1:10:57] he says notice he tried his old tactic
[1:10:59] on Jesus same thing he did to Moses same
[1:11:01] thing he did to the rest of them he
[1:11:03] tried it
[1:11:04] he'll try it on you
[1:11:06] to get you to accept some great big
[1:11:09] something that looks shiny
[1:11:12] reminds me of when I used to hunt Coons
[1:11:15] just gonna pause there sort of the back
[1:11:17] story as he talks about it and we're
[1:11:19] familiar with this he says that
[1:11:20] Hollywood shines
[1:11:23] the gospel glows
[1:11:26] and this is sort of the context that
[1:11:27] he's talking from
[1:11:29] if we're looking for something shiny
[1:11:30] we're actually not going to get it
[1:11:32] because the gospel glows it doesn't
[1:11:34] shine it says reminds me of when I used
[1:11:36] to hunt Coons
[1:11:38] I I get me a papa daddy use tobacco I
[1:11:42] don't know whether you all ever knew of
[1:11:44] them old tags they used to be on a Twist
[1:11:46] of tobacco I would take that that get me
[1:11:48] a log and and bore a hole in it right
[1:11:50] around the creek where a had been
[1:11:51] running and then I'd bore a hole in
[1:11:53] there and stick his tobacco tag there
[1:11:56] and then drive me some Nails angling in
[1:11:59] like this and the Coon's always reaching
[1:12:01] for something shiny so when the moon
[1:12:04] come up and he run along there he looked
[1:12:06] back there and he pushed his hand in
[1:12:08] there to get it
[1:12:10] he says he won't turn it loose
[1:12:14] we heard someone say that recently I
[1:12:16] don't know if it was on Wednesday I
[1:12:18] don't know who said it maybe I heard it
[1:12:20] somewhere else about how a monkey will
[1:12:22] actually they'll catch monkeys by
[1:12:24] sticking their hand through a Board and
[1:12:26] they'll grab on to whatever it is the
[1:12:28] fruit or whatever on the other side of
[1:12:29] the board and they won't let go of it
[1:12:31] even when they hear the Hunter coming
[1:12:32] they won't let go of it
[1:12:34] here we have brother Brown I'm talking
[1:12:35] about raccoons and the same behavior he
[1:12:37] says he's like some church members even
[1:12:39] he knows he's caught
[1:12:42] he won't turn it loose if I do they'll
[1:12:45] put me out of the organization that's
[1:12:46] just his death that's all all right
[1:12:48] notice there when he holds on to it he
[1:12:51] won't turn loose brothers and sisters I
[1:12:53] want to say this today what are we
[1:12:55] holding on to
[1:12:58] is there anything in our lives that
[1:13:00] we're holding on to if there is let go
[1:13:03] of it the Hunter's coming
[1:13:05] he's going to get you if you don't let
[1:13:07] it go it's going to take you down but
[1:13:10] you can let it go brothers and sisters
[1:13:12] you can lay it on the altar you can call
[1:13:14] your brother or sister and say forgive
[1:13:16] me I've had this thing forgive me I've
[1:13:18] got this thing you can go to God and say
[1:13:19] it whatever you need to do you know what
[1:13:21] to do the spirit will tell you but are
[1:13:23] you going to be willing to hang on to
[1:13:24] whatever it is until the end
[1:13:27] or just let go
[1:13:29] just let go of it and be free hear that
[1:13:32] Jubilee trumpet blow in your ears and
[1:13:35] know that I don't have to hang on to
[1:13:36] nothing
[1:13:37] the only thing I've got to do is hold on
[1:13:39] to Christ and know that when you hold on
[1:13:42] to him you're not actually holding on to
[1:13:43] him at all he's holding on to you that's
[1:13:45] what that recognition is
[1:13:48] I heard a brother talking about raccoons
[1:13:50] in a sermon a while ago
[1:13:51] I heard it said that you know being at a
[1:13:54] national park in the states looking at a
[1:13:56] raccoon track in a national park
[1:13:58] and and traveling seeing that this this
[1:14:01] this ancient track is an ancient track
[1:14:04] it's not just a a fresh track it's an
[1:14:07] ancient track and that raccoons travel
[1:14:09] on this track and they have for
[1:14:11] centuries
[1:14:13] and the predictability of knowing that
[1:14:15] there will be a raccoon someone said
[1:14:16] that a raccoon will actually put his
[1:14:18] foot right there
[1:14:21] when that raccoon walks by here he's
[1:14:23] going to put his foot right there
[1:14:25] and isn't it interesting to look at this
[1:14:29] Satan's been watching human beings for
[1:14:31] six thousand years
[1:14:33] he's been seeing the iniquity of our
[1:14:36] fathers
[1:14:37] and our forefathers
[1:14:39] to the third and the fourth generation
[1:14:41] Satan knows our DNA makeup
[1:14:45] you can rest assured he's banking on us
[1:14:48] putting our foot right there knowing
[1:14:51] that thing that they just can't overcome
[1:14:53] they're going to do it again I'm going
[1:14:55] to come and tempt them we're going to
[1:14:56] get all the guns from Hell trained on
[1:14:58] them on that weak spot we're going to
[1:14:59] exploit it they're going to come and
[1:15:01] they're going to do it again they're
[1:15:02] going to put their foot right there
[1:15:03] they're not going to let go of that
[1:15:05] thing that's in their life they're not
[1:15:06] going to be willing to lay it down and
[1:15:08] just go and confess their fault one to
[1:15:10] another and pray for one another they'll
[1:15:11] be no they're Humanity their DNA all
[1:15:15] their fathers and forefathers all of
[1:15:17] that stuff the iniquity to the third and
[1:15:19] the fourth it'll they'll do it
[1:15:20] guaranteed they're going to do it so he
[1:15:23] sends out his army and they come after
[1:15:24] us and what do we do we go and put our
[1:15:26] foot there I'm speaking to myself here I
[1:15:28] put my foot there so many times and many
[1:15:30] times I put it right here but I'm hoping
[1:15:33] I'm not doing that right now but
[1:15:34] brothers and sisters we've got the
[1:15:35] ability to just let go of it and not put
[1:15:37] our foot there put your foot right
[1:15:39] beside it trick the devil
[1:15:42] don't be predictable be unpredictable
[1:15:49] we want to have a regular prayer life
[1:15:51] but I've heard this said and I think
[1:15:53] it's wonderful
[1:15:55] don't be a predictable prayer Warrior
[1:15:57] it's good to be predictable we want to
[1:15:59] know that we're consistent with our
[1:16:01] prayers and we're fervent effectually
[1:16:02] with our prayers but don't just have a
[1:16:05] very specific time or or or or or a day
[1:16:08] when we say our prayers because you can
[1:16:10] rest assured that Satan's going to come
[1:16:12] and try and interrupt you he's going to
[1:16:14] come around and try and kick the the
[1:16:15] legs out from underneath our stool he
[1:16:17] doesn't want us to spend time in prayer
[1:16:20] so what if we're unpredictable I'm just
[1:16:22] going to pull over on the side of the
[1:16:24] road here and instead of me going to do
[1:16:25] this thing I'm just going to go and pray
[1:16:27] maybe instead of doing this thing at
[1:16:30] home that I would normally do putting my
[1:16:31] foot there I'm just gonna stop I'm going
[1:16:33] to turn and go and do something
[1:16:34] different go to a different location
[1:16:35] maybe and I'm just going to go and pray
[1:16:37] I'm just going to go and remember that
[1:16:39] brother that that told me about his
[1:16:41] fault that confessed his fault to me and
[1:16:42] confidence and I'm going to go and pray
[1:16:44] for that I'm going to go to war for my
[1:16:46] brother or my sister be unpredictable to
[1:16:49] Satan don't be predictable to Satan
[1:16:52] but we can hear the Hunter coming
[1:16:54] brothers and sisters
[1:16:56] and what are we not willing to let go of
[1:16:59] it's real
[1:17:00] is it hurt in our lives
[1:17:03] we want to hold on to our hurt
[1:17:05] so long that the hunter can come and
[1:17:07] actually destroy us
[1:17:08] is it anger
[1:17:10] is it fear
[1:17:12] is it sadness these are all real things
[1:17:15] brother Branham talks about each one of
[1:17:17] these things being spirits
[1:17:20] are we willing to hang on to them to put
[1:17:22] out the welcome mat for Spirits in our
[1:17:24] lives that are contrary to the spirit of
[1:17:26] the Lord even anxiety
[1:17:29] say oh my I'm I'm so full of anxiety I
[1:17:32] just don't know what to do and and I
[1:17:33] just don't know where to go with it and
[1:17:35] so I go to my doctor and my doctor gives
[1:17:37] me a prescription and teaches me how to
[1:17:39] live with my anxiety brothers and
[1:17:40] sisters there is a Deliverance for
[1:17:42] anxiety and I can only say it by
[1:17:44] experience and that's the baptism of the
[1:17:46] Holy Spirit even though you're baptized
[1:17:49] with the Holy Spirit you can still have
[1:17:50] any one of these these these other
[1:17:52] spirits come around and try and get you
[1:17:54] to believe that you have them but you
[1:17:56] need to have the we need to have that
[1:17:58] confession in our lives that we don't
[1:18:00] own it it's a box of rattlesnakes and
[1:18:03] rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:18:07] because someone hurt me God's not going
[1:18:09] to say that's that's okay it's fine
[1:18:12] they hurt you really bad you
[1:18:14] hold on to that hurt and drag it around
[1:18:16] with you what you're doing is you're
[1:18:17] holding on to that that thing and your
[1:18:20] hand's stuck in the board man and the
[1:18:22] hunter is coming
[1:18:24] if you're anger angry with someone
[1:18:26] you've got to get rid of it and you know
[1:18:28] we can
[1:18:29] we can be free brothers and sisters
[1:18:31] because that Jubilee trumpet is sounded
[1:18:34] and you know if we choose not to heed
[1:18:37] that Jubilee trumpet and deal with it
[1:18:39] according to the way the word was given
[1:18:40] to us
[1:18:41] then what's going to happen to us
[1:18:43] spiritually speaking brothers and
[1:18:44] sisters if there's something in our
[1:18:45] lives we're holding on to what's going
[1:18:46] to happen is we're going to get that
[1:18:48] that bore whole whole board right in our
[1:18:51] ears and it's not going to be in our
[1:18:53] earlobe and it's not going to be in our
[1:18:54] eardrum it's going to be in our
[1:18:56] spiritual ear for those who have
[1:18:57] spiritual ears to hear what the spirit
[1:18:59] saith unto the churches that spiritual
[1:19:02] ear is going to go deaf and we'll be
[1:19:04] able to come to service we'll be able to
[1:19:07] go and worship around the word of God
[1:19:09] think that we're worshiping God but
[1:19:11] we're going to be frozen in time we're
[1:19:13] not going to be able to escape that
[1:19:15] thing that we're holding on to
[1:19:17] it's going to kill us
[1:19:21] but you know we speak better things
[1:19:24] to the Bride of Jesus Christ we've been
[1:19:27] given that Jubilee sound brothers and
[1:19:28] sisters we don't have to hold on to
[1:19:30] stuff
[1:19:31] we can be free
[1:19:34] out of the mark of the beast speaking
[1:19:36] about this hearing
[1:19:37] in 1961 brother Bradham says but if you
[1:19:39] hear the trumpet see hearing Faith
[1:19:42] cometh by what hearing now not just
[1:19:45] listening with your ear but if you hear
[1:19:47] that means understand it you accept it I
[1:19:51] hear you I believe it see it's hearing
[1:19:53] Stephen said you stiff-necked
[1:19:55] uncircumcised and hardened ears see
[1:19:57] uncircumcised they could hear it with
[1:19:59] their ears but uncircumcised they
[1:20:01] wouldn't believe it see uncircumcised in
[1:20:04] the heart and ears understand it oh it's
[1:20:06] all a mystery to me like Cain
[1:20:09] take it or leave it I brought my
[1:20:11] sacrifice just take it or leave it this
[1:20:13] is what I got just take it or leave it
[1:20:15] stiff-necked and uncircumcised that's
[1:20:17] what brother Branham was talking about
[1:20:18] going back to the call here before I get
[1:20:20] too far he says I joined church and
[1:20:22] that's as good as I can do all right
[1:20:24] King yo Mark it with the Beast and go
[1:20:27] right off in your denomination remember
[1:20:29] brother Ken preached it many times you
[1:20:32] can have a denomination of one
[1:20:34] you can have your own belief structure
[1:20:36] and say God bless you I know I've got
[1:20:39] the Revelation Jesus Christ the same
[1:20:42] yesterday today and forever and and have
[1:20:44] something else that's not actually
[1:20:46] according to the word it becomes a
[1:20:47] denomination any deviation from the word
[1:20:49] of God according to the day that we live
[1:20:51] in the word that was given to us through
[1:20:53] the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:20:55] becomes a denomination
[1:20:58] well the bottom says but you can come to
[1:21:00] Christ and be sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:21:03] you can take your choice now watch you
[1:21:06] hear that gospel Trump what is the
[1:21:08] gospel trumpet
[1:21:10] the good news
[1:21:12] the Holy Ghost is here
[1:21:14] how do you know it is watch it work
[1:21:18] Watch what it does it's the good news
[1:21:22] we've been given that brothers and
[1:21:23] sisters the Jubilee trumpet is the Holy
[1:21:25] Ghost
[1:21:26] and I just love to hear how brother
[1:21:28] Barnum says that because there's times
[1:21:29] where I felt like maybe I was overdoing
[1:21:31] it talking about the Holy Ghost and I
[1:21:33] know people have even gotten upset about
[1:21:35] me talking about the Holy Ghost is that
[1:21:37] all he's going to talk about well that's
[1:21:38] all there is to talk about we can talk
[1:21:41] about many different things but brothers
[1:21:42] and sisters if we don't got the Holy
[1:21:44] Ghost In Our Lives we're not actually
[1:21:45] hearing with these years that were given
[1:21:48] to the church to hear with
[1:21:50] we have to be able to have the Holy
[1:21:52] Ghost In Our Lives to be able to
[1:21:53] understand what we're talking about
[1:21:55] goes on to say now what if this man said
[1:21:58] chopping talking about a Slave Jubilee
[1:22:01] trumpets gone and this this guy's
[1:22:03] chopping wood for his master now what if
[1:22:05] this man was chopping said well I don't
[1:22:07] believe I want to go
[1:22:09] oh to turn it down what what did they do
[1:22:11] they took his master then had to take
[1:22:14] him down to the Methodist
[1:22:16] to the Baptist
[1:22:18] Pentecostal or Presbyterian Church
[1:22:21] I love the way brother Bradham brings
[1:22:22] this to real life he brings it right
[1:22:24] down and you know brothers and sisters I
[1:22:26] would even go so far as to say the
[1:22:28] message church and it's just making me
[1:22:30] vibrate saying that and I don't mean it
[1:22:31] in terms of the message just being a
[1:22:33] denomination because the message will
[1:22:35] never denominate the true message which
[1:22:37] is Christ but there's people that try
[1:22:40] and get around the word of God the the
[1:22:42] word of God for their day and say quick
[1:22:43] we got to protect it now we've seen the
[1:22:45] move of God in our lives we just need to
[1:22:47] protect it and if you do it the way that
[1:22:48] we do it then you'll have success in
[1:22:50] your lives the only way that you can do
[1:22:51] it brothers and sisters to have success
[1:22:53] in your lives is according to the word
[1:22:54] of God the way brother Branham brought
[1:22:56] it if you try and do anything else then
[1:22:57] you are moving into denominational
[1:22:59] Waters and I would say whatever you want
[1:23:01] to call that we'll put it in here with
[1:23:03] this he says to turn it down what do
[1:23:05] they do they took his master then had to
[1:23:07] take him down to the Methodist Baptist
[1:23:08] Pentecostal Presbyterian church and take
[1:23:11] him up to the wall stick his ear up
[1:23:13] against the wall and take an awl and
[1:23:14] bore a hole through his ear and marked
[1:23:17] him and never was he free no more and if
[1:23:20] you hear the the truth and turn away
[1:23:22] from it then your ear is stopped and
[1:23:25] you'll never hear it no more
[1:23:28] you'll go out from the presence of God
[1:23:29] saying my mother was Presbyterian I'm
[1:23:31] just as good as all the rest of them
[1:23:33] your mother lived in all the light she
[1:23:35] had but that ain't you that's right
[1:23:38] Caiaphas lived in all the light he knew
[1:23:40] but Jesus was on Earth at that time all
[1:23:43] them Orthodox believers they had their
[1:23:45] greats and organizations denominations
[1:23:47] and everything they walked in all the
[1:23:49] light they had but the light was right
[1:23:51] before them but they were stiff-necked
[1:23:53] uncircumcised in heart and ears
[1:23:56] didn't want to do it then God sealed
[1:23:59] them in
[1:24:00] their doomed doomed him right there in
[1:24:03] Jerusalem and died and went to hell he
[1:24:06] said that's right take your choice
[1:24:08] that's where we're at brothers and
[1:24:10] sisters we need to make sure if we have
[1:24:12] heard that gospel trumpet that we just
[1:24:15] accepted and we say hey maybe I don't
[1:24:17] understand it but I believe it
[1:24:19] don't look at man
[1:24:21] Look Away to Jesus brothers and sisters
[1:24:23] and brother Bradham talks about that in
[1:24:26] Look Away to Jesus at the very end of it
[1:24:28] I believe it is he says don't look at a
[1:24:30] pastor don't look at a man don't look at
[1:24:32] a brother or a sister look at Christ
[1:24:34] if you get caught up look at it a man
[1:24:36] thinking a man's Gonna Save You God's
[1:24:38] going to make that man fail to prove to
[1:24:40] you that no man will ever save you it's
[1:24:43] only going to be Christ he won't share
[1:24:45] his glory with nobody
[1:24:47] watch a great ministry great Ministries
[1:24:49] that rise up you know what happens they
[1:24:51] fall God allows it to happen the only
[1:24:54] reason is people start to actually put
[1:24:56] that Ministry on a pedestal it's not the
[1:24:57] right thing to do
[1:24:59] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be
[1:25:01] filled with the Holy Ghost he says be
[1:25:03] filled with his Spirit your lamps
[1:25:05] trimmed and clear
[1:25:09] we've heard that gospel trumpet brothers
[1:25:10] and sisters we can be free we don't have
[1:25:13] to worry about holding on to things in
[1:25:15] our lives we can just lay it down we can
[1:25:19] just let it go and we can just go to
[1:25:21] where we've heard that gospel trumpet
[1:25:22] sound and it doesn't matter whether it's
[1:25:24] been a day a week a year a decade A
[1:25:29] Century of things in our lives that
[1:25:31] we've got bundled up we can just let it
[1:25:33] go
[1:25:34] that's what he's asking us to do is let
[1:25:37] go of all of our thinking all of our
[1:25:38] teaching all of our things in our lives
[1:25:40] that maybe we think makes us up of who
[1:25:43] we are just let it go
[1:25:45] and accept that gospel trumpet
[1:25:51] brother Branham says that you can't be
[1:25:52] neutral about it
[1:25:54] and you can't be neutral about it you
[1:25:56] can't say I just choose not to choose
[1:25:57] because you've made a choice not to
[1:25:59] choose to do that
[1:26:00] to say that I'm just going to stay right
[1:26:02] where I'm at you've chosen we've made a
[1:26:04] choice
[1:26:05] we can't just go and sit in neutral and
[1:26:09] idle that's not going to happen not in
[1:26:11] the spiritual world and we know that
[1:26:12] doesn't happen in creation there's no
[1:26:15] animal that can say I just don't feel
[1:26:16] like getting up and eating today they'll
[1:26:18] die
[1:26:19] no plant can just stay exactly the same
[1:26:23] exactly the same it's either growing or
[1:26:26] it's dying
[1:26:27] that's the way this world has been
[1:26:29] created
[1:26:30] we as humans as the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:32] Christ we're either growing into
[1:26:34] Perfection or we're slowly dying
[1:26:37] a slow death
[1:26:38] you can't be neutral Oneness of unity
[1:26:40] 1958.
[1:26:43] he says you can't set neutral the Bible
[1:26:45] said
[1:26:46] in this day that every man that wasn't
[1:26:48] sealed with the Holy Ghost would have
[1:26:50] the mark of the beast
[1:26:53] what is the mark of the beast
[1:26:55] unbelief
[1:26:58] and you know we've talked about this in
[1:26:59] the past I'll just say it again to stir
[1:27:01] up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance
[1:27:03] how do we just get the mark of the beast
[1:27:06] because we're born in sin we're shaped
[1:27:07] in iniquity we come into this world
[1:27:09] speaking Lies We Are Born outside of the
[1:27:12] way that we're supposed to be in this
[1:27:13] world we are supposed to be spoken word
[1:27:16] Sons and Daughters of God but we come
[1:27:18] into this world by passing our
[1:27:20] theophonies in a position where we've
[1:27:22] already sinned even though we haven't
[1:27:24] sinned our parents did
[1:27:26] that's how we got here right born in sin
[1:27:28] shaped in iniquity you come into the
[1:27:30] world speaking lies doesn't matter what
[1:27:31] we do how good of people we are we're
[1:27:33] already there and so we are given the
[1:27:36] opportunity in our lives to accept the
[1:27:38] Holy Ghost In Our Lives which is the
[1:27:39] Seal of God which trumps all of our past
[1:27:42] sins we know we heard it yesterday it
[1:27:44] throws all of our sin and the Sea of
[1:27:46] God's forgetfulness
[1:27:47] and that's what we're all after
[1:27:50] but if we choose to not accept that
[1:27:52] ceiling brothers and sisters you're
[1:27:54] choosing the mark of the beast
[1:27:56] many people today are looking for a uh
[1:27:58] some kind of a mark in the forehand or
[1:28:00] the or the head and some kind of vaccine
[1:28:03] some kind of natural identification
[1:28:04] brothers and sisters if we see a natural
[1:28:06] mark of the beast we've missed it
[1:28:09] because the bride ain't going to be here
[1:28:10] for that but my goodness the mark of the
[1:28:13] beast is actually the opposite of
[1:28:15] receiving the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:28:17] and that's why I can't help but cry out
[1:28:19] for it just like Noah cried out get in
[1:28:21] the boat it's going to rain brothers and
[1:28:23] sisters it's going to rain fire get the
[1:28:25] Holy Ghost in your life know where you
[1:28:27] stand
[1:28:30] you can't set neutral the Bible said in
[1:28:33] this day that every man wasn't sealed
[1:28:34] with the Holy Ghost would have the mark
[1:28:35] of the beast what is the mark of the
[1:28:37] beast unbelief don't you know if your
[1:28:39] pastors has taught you in the Old
[1:28:41] Testament when the trumpet sounded if
[1:28:42] the man wanted to go free he could go
[1:28:44] free
[1:28:45] if you want to go three brothers and
[1:28:47] sisters you can go free it doesn't
[1:28:49] matter how complex your problem is today
[1:28:50] I'm telling you spiritually speaking you
[1:28:53] can go free doesn't matter how many sins
[1:28:55] you've created in your life you can go
[1:28:57] free doesn't matter how complicated or
[1:28:59] mixed up things can seem it's possible
[1:29:02] for you to be free
[1:29:04] if your pastor has taught you the Old
[1:29:05] Testament when the trumpet sounded if
[1:29:07] the man wanted to go free he could go
[1:29:08] free if he didn't he walked out to the
[1:29:10] post and had an all board through his
[1:29:11] ear because he refused to go free and if
[1:29:13] you refuse to go free then you'll serve
[1:29:15] that Taskmaster whatever that is the
[1:29:17] rest of your days and your lust
[1:29:21] brothers and sisters just accept the way
[1:29:24] that God has given it to us my goodness
[1:29:27] I hope it's not too much I've got so
[1:29:28] many quotes I think I'm going to have to
[1:29:30] start jumping quotes here maybe we'll
[1:29:32] get a couple more in are we okay today
[1:29:36] the mark of the beast marries belief
[1:29:41] all that didn't receive the Seal of God
[1:29:42] got the mark of the beast
[1:29:44] you know what the mark of the beast was
[1:29:46] to reject the Seal of God
[1:29:49] and I just want to say it today to
[1:29:50] reject the Holy Ghost
[1:29:52] when you hear a pastor somewhere say get
[1:29:54] the Holy Ghost when you reject that
[1:29:56] brothers and sisters when there's
[1:29:57] resistance in you what you're doing is
[1:29:58] you're accepting the mark of the beast
[1:30:00] there needs to be red flags going off
[1:30:02] all over the place and and I just want
[1:30:04] to hope that maybe we can take someone
[1:30:06] that's maybe in that position and shake
[1:30:08] them and and slap them and give them the
[1:30:10] ability to hear this because if you
[1:30:12] don't hear this you're going to be lost
[1:30:14] forever brothers and sisters
[1:30:16] all that didn't receive the Seal of God
[1:30:18] got the mark of the beast you know what
[1:30:20] the mark of the beast was to reject the
[1:30:21] Seal of God in the Old Testament when
[1:30:23] the trumpet sounded the priest sounded
[1:30:24] the trumpet if a slave did not want to
[1:30:26] go free he had to be sealed
[1:30:29] bored in his ear with an all then he was
[1:30:32] a slave the rest of his days
[1:30:34] but Faith cometh by hearing brothers and
[1:30:36] sisters if you don't hear it and receive
[1:30:39] it then you're marked on the other side
[1:30:41] then you can't come in he says let's
[1:30:43] start tonight and in a Revival and open
[1:30:46] our hearts to the Holy Spirit while our
[1:30:48] hour is here
[1:30:51] I I don't know I I'm sorry I just feel
[1:30:53] like I got
[1:30:55] so inspired by this
[1:30:59] I just don't want to keep reading quotes
[1:31:01] on and on and on because I think it can
[1:31:03] become a bit much I know
[1:31:05] out of the choosing of the Bride I think
[1:31:07] it's about to to change here we're going
[1:31:09] to change gears
[1:31:11] so
[1:31:12] out of the choosing of a bride 1965
[1:31:14] brother Branham says remember when the
[1:31:16] Jubilee year came and the priest rode
[1:31:18] with his trumpet sounding that every
[1:31:20] slave could go free
[1:31:22] but if they refuse to accept their
[1:31:24] freedom
[1:31:25] they had to be taken to the temple post
[1:31:27] and all board threw him in the ear then
[1:31:30] he served his master always and it's put
[1:31:32] on his ear as a type of hearing Faith
[1:31:34] cometh by hearing he heard the trumpet
[1:31:36] but he didn't want to listen to it
[1:31:39] how many times men and women hear God's
[1:31:42] truth and see it Vindicated and proven
[1:31:45] truth
[1:31:46] but yet they don't want to hear it
[1:31:49] there's some other reason
[1:31:51] some other choosing that they have than
[1:31:55] to face up to the truth and facts
[1:31:58] therefore their ears can be closed to
[1:32:02] the gospel
[1:32:03] they'll never hear it again
[1:32:06] and that's not to say brothers and
[1:32:07] sisters you can go to church you can
[1:32:08] hear our words we can hear our voices
[1:32:10] right we're hearing with our ears
[1:32:12] naturally speaking but remember we said
[1:32:13] he that hath an ear he that hath a
[1:32:16] spiritual ear we know the story in
[1:32:18] Isaiah
[1:32:20] speak to these bones Isaiah
[1:32:23] that they may hear and how many of those
[1:32:25] bones had ears ears are sinew and Flesh
[1:32:27] and Blood right we're not talking about
[1:32:29] natural ears here
[1:32:31] brother Branham says they'll be closed
[1:32:33] to the gospel they'll never hear it
[1:32:34] again my advice to you seventh angel
[1:32:37] messenger
[1:32:38] my advice to you when God speaks to your
[1:32:42] heart you act right then
[1:32:46] he says Elijah gave them a choice
[1:32:49] which they should choose you this day
[1:32:53] whom ye shall serve if God be God serve
[1:32:57] him
[1:32:58] but if Baal be God serve him
[1:33:00] and you know that same Elijah spoke
[1:33:03] those same words today brothers and
[1:33:05] sisters to refuse the baptism of the
[1:33:09] Holy Ghost to resist the Seal of God in
[1:33:12] our lives is to automatically accept the
[1:33:14] mark of the beast so choose ye this day
[1:33:16] whom ye shall serve you know what that
[1:33:18] Jubilee has sounded we know Revelations
[1:33:21] 10 7 Malachi 4 5 and 6 Luke 17 30 Luke 4
[1:33:25] 19.
[1:33:27] I want to go there to Luke 4 19 if you
[1:33:30] don't mind turning there brothers and
[1:33:32] sisters it needs to be for us present
[1:33:35] tense this day today
[1:33:39] alive
[1:33:51] start with 16.
[1:33:54] Luke 4.
[1:33:58] Jesus coming into the temple and he came
[1:34:00] to Nazareth this is Luke
[1:34:03] Luke 4 verse 16 and he came to Nazareth
[1:34:06] where he had been brought up as it was
[1:34:08] his custom he went into the synagogue on
[1:34:10] the Sabbath day and stood up for it to
[1:34:12] read
[1:34:13] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:34:15] book of the prophet Isaiah
[1:34:18] and when he had opened the book where he
[1:34:20] found the place where it was written the
[1:34:22] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:34:24] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:34:27] the poor he hath sent me to heal the
[1:34:30] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:34:33] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:34:35] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[1:34:38] are bruised in verse 19 to preach the
[1:34:41] acceptable year of the Lord
[1:34:43] and he closed the book and gave it again
[1:34:45] to the minister and sat down
[1:34:48] and the eyes of all of them that were in
[1:34:50] the synagogue were fastened on him and
[1:34:52] he began to say unto them this day is
[1:34:55] this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[1:35:00] this scripture we know is a direct
[1:35:02] reference to Isaiah 61.
[1:35:06] Isaiah 61 reads the spirit of the Lord
[1:35:09] God is upon me because the Lord hath
[1:35:10] anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto
[1:35:12] the meek he has sent me to bind up the
[1:35:14] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[1:35:17] captives and to the opening of the
[1:35:19] prison to them that are bound
[1:35:22] you know in this day when Jesus the
[1:35:25] unlearned
[1:35:26] call it ignorant man son of Mary and
[1:35:29] Joseph here he was in the synagogue and
[1:35:32] they knew there was something special
[1:35:33] about this boy about this man so they
[1:35:37] gave him the book they gave him the
[1:35:38] scroll and said teach us Master speak to
[1:35:41] us we want to hear from you today what
[1:35:44] do you have isn't it wonderful that he
[1:35:45] would sit down and proclaim the Year of
[1:35:48] Jubilee to them
[1:35:50] Christ himself bringing them Jubilee
[1:35:55] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:35:58] Lord
[1:35:58] and we know in Luke the scripture we
[1:36:00] just read he closed the book and he gave
[1:36:01] it back to them that's the first half of
[1:36:04] Isaiah 61 verse 2 the second half we
[1:36:07] know full well brother Branham brought
[1:36:09] out which the rest of the world didn't
[1:36:11] have and the day of Vengeance of our God
[1:36:14] to comfort all that mourn and that
[1:36:16] dovetails with Malachi 4 5 and 6 there
[1:36:20] will be a day that shall burn as an oven
[1:36:22] and they shall be stubble we know that's
[1:36:25] what he was talking about but that
[1:36:26] wasn't the day that he was in he was
[1:36:28] there blowing the Jubilee trumpet saying
[1:36:31] hey just pick up your cross and follow
[1:36:33] me if you're willing to accept me the
[1:36:35] way that I've come then you will be
[1:36:37] saved you and your house can be saved
[1:36:39] and it's the same for us today he has
[1:36:42] come and he hasn't actually given us the
[1:36:45] second half of Isaiah 61 verse 2 but we
[1:36:49] know that day is coming and it's never
[1:36:51] been sooner but the bride is out of here
[1:36:53] when that day comes
[1:36:55] you know brothers and sisters we have
[1:36:57] the opportunity to actually take and
[1:36:59] hear that gospel trumpet there's so much
[1:37:02] in the scripture that points to our day
[1:37:03] you know brother Bradham says that we
[1:37:05] should be able to see Christ from
[1:37:06] Genesis to Revelation in every single
[1:37:08] scripture and if we don't see it we need
[1:37:10] to stop go back and read it again until
[1:37:12] we actually get there and we should be
[1:37:14] able to also see the seventh seal being
[1:37:16] open in every single scripture he says
[1:37:19] that as well for some people it's only
[1:37:21] six seals and that's a troubling thing
[1:37:23] that's a problematic thing because you
[1:37:25] suddenly don't have ears to hear what
[1:37:27] the spirit says under the churches
[1:37:28] because if you listen past the seals
[1:37:31] brother Branham refers to them seals
[1:37:33] being open it's not just six it's all
[1:37:36] seven of them we have the total
[1:37:38] revelation of Jesus Christ given to us
[1:37:40] but you can come higher brothers and
[1:37:42] sisters we can be sealed we don't have
[1:37:44] to worry about being slaves and stuck in
[1:37:47] bondage not willing to let go of the
[1:37:49] things I'm only saying that just to lay
[1:37:51] down a foundation because like we heard
[1:37:53] on Wednesday it was so beautiful we
[1:37:54] talked about the iniquity but then we
[1:37:56] talked about righteousness and this
[1:37:58] morning we can talk about being slaves
[1:38:00] and stuck in bondage not letting go of
[1:38:01] stuff we can also recognize that we're
[1:38:03] not there that's not where we swim
[1:38:06] that's not where we soar we are in the
[1:38:08] heavenlies as Eagles you can come higher
[1:38:11] and be sealed out of the Easter seal God
[1:38:13] gave Abraham a promise Abraham believed
[1:38:15] God and it was imputed unto him for
[1:38:17] righteousness but he sealed the Covenant
[1:38:19] by the Seal of circumcision and God
[1:38:21] gives you a promise potentially that you
[1:38:24] will receive it and you're going to be
[1:38:25] raised up this body is going to be
[1:38:28] glorified with him at the end time
[1:38:31] I'm just going to pause there for a
[1:38:32] second something hit me astounding this
[1:38:35] week and I don't know if I talked about
[1:38:37] it on Wednesday forgive me
[1:38:39] um I'm just like a kid in a candy shop
[1:38:41] with the message and the word it's just
[1:38:43] wonderful did you ever think about it
[1:38:45] just stop and think about what it's
[1:38:46] going to be like when we get over on the
[1:38:47] other side how there's going to be a
[1:38:49] thousand years
[1:38:50] there's going to be a thousand years and
[1:38:52] we're going to be there for a thousand
[1:38:53] years I heard somebody say it I never
[1:38:55] really looked at it this way is that we
[1:38:57] see 2022 as the date that we live in
[1:38:59] today but you know what it's going to
[1:39:01] continue there's still going to be a
[1:39:03] space of time for a thousand years
[1:39:06] it's measured time so what is it going
[1:39:09] to be how far into the future are we
[1:39:11] going to be logging time 20 20 40 2080
[1:39:15] 3010 how far are we going to go into the
[1:39:18] future I don't know it's an interesting
[1:39:20] thought but what I was thinking about
[1:39:22] which I find the most fascinating isn't
[1:39:24] it wonderful to think that God allowed
[1:39:27] Satan to creep into the Garden of Eden
[1:39:29] in the very beginning and take his bride
[1:39:32] take Adam's bride that one that came
[1:39:34] from his side and actually defile her
[1:39:36] but then God waited gave Satan 6 000
[1:39:40] years you can go ahead and create your
[1:39:41] Eden and do whatever you need to do
[1:39:43] through your perversion because you
[1:39:44] can't create but make your Eden and I
[1:39:48] will go and take a bride of my own
[1:39:50] choosing and she will not refuse my
[1:39:52] voice she will say Amen just like Mary
[1:39:55] said to that angel messenger that came
[1:39:58] unto her but isn't it interesting that
[1:40:00] he's not just gonna actually say I won
[1:40:03] and that's it what he's going to do is
[1:40:05] openly display her made her before Satan
[1:40:08] for a thousand years to show his victory
[1:40:12] for a thousand years to show Satan every
[1:40:15] single one of those Thousand Days oh my
[1:40:18] it's not even a thousand days how many
[1:40:19] days is that I don't even know times it
[1:40:22] by 365.
[1:40:24] that's amazing that many days to show
[1:40:27] Satan I am victorious and you lust you
[1:40:31] lust because the Bible says that Satan
[1:40:34] is going to be bound for a thousand
[1:40:36] years with chains right
[1:40:39] but the prophet for our day he said he's
[1:40:40] not going to be bound with chains
[1:40:42] physical chains
[1:40:43] the denominations will teach you it's
[1:40:45] physical change when he's going to be
[1:40:46] bound with his chains of circumstance
[1:40:48] she is going to be the sinless Spotless
[1:40:50] bride of Jesus Christ that she is here
[1:40:52] over there she's going to be able to
[1:40:54] stand in the face of Satan and say uh-uh
[1:40:56] not this time you cannot touch me or my
[1:40:59] children or my wife or my husband or my
[1:41:02] church you have no power all of your
[1:41:05] power has been taken from you
[1:41:07] for a thousand years
[1:41:10] that's the God we serve
[1:41:13] that's such a tremendous thought I just
[1:41:15] can't get over that thought to think
[1:41:16] that's what he's going to do
[1:41:18] he's going to parade his bride in front
[1:41:20] of Satan for a thousand years just to
[1:41:23] show there's going to be people that
[1:41:24] will be able to be tempted
[1:41:26] but not the bride
[1:41:29] not the Bride of Jesus Christ brother
[1:41:31] Brown goes on is quote here and he says
[1:41:32] God gives you a promise potentially that
[1:41:34] you and you will receive it
[1:41:36] and you're going to be raised up this
[1:41:38] body is going to be glorified with him
[1:41:40] at the end time but you see you have to
[1:41:45] get clearance on that deed
[1:41:48] and the clearance is when everything
[1:41:50] against it has been stricken off and
[1:41:53] you've got the abstract to it you've got
[1:41:56] the seal and remember when we get that
[1:41:58] seal it's the earnest
[1:42:01] it's the down payment
[1:42:03] on our Resurrection it's him coming back
[1:42:06] to show us that there's nothing that can
[1:42:08] shake you from this seal because you're
[1:42:10] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:42:12] not till tomorrow not till the next time
[1:42:14] you fall not till the next time
[1:42:15] something happens in your life no no no
[1:42:17] no that's denominational teaching that's
[1:42:19] a lie of the devil if you've ever
[1:42:20] received this seal brothers and sisters
[1:42:22] there's nothing that can change you from
[1:42:25] that you can never be shaken from that
[1:42:27] seal
[1:42:29] it's a glorified body he says but you
[1:42:32] see you have to get clearance on that
[1:42:34] deed you've got to get the clearance
[1:42:36] you've got to be able to hear that voice
[1:42:38] and when you can hear that voice
[1:42:39] something inside you says amen when that
[1:42:42] amen happens brothers and sisters the
[1:42:43] spiritual conception takes a hold and
[1:42:46] you will no longer ever be able to be
[1:42:48] bored in the ear because you've said so
[1:42:50] long sucker to your former master I am
[1:42:53] not sticking around you I'm throwing
[1:42:54] down my hoe I don't have to worry about
[1:42:56] all of this slavery that I was born into
[1:42:58] it wasn't my fault it was my my
[1:43:01] grandfathers my uncles my aunts whose
[1:43:03] ever it was it wasn't me
[1:43:09] laughs sorry he says but you see you
[1:43:12] have to get a clearance on that deed and
[1:43:14] the clearance is when everything against
[1:43:16] it has been stricken off
[1:43:18] and you got the abstract to it you got
[1:43:21] the seal it's yours
[1:43:23] everything's on it belongs to you amen
[1:43:26] and when we believe on Jesus Christ for
[1:43:29] our savior and repent and are baptized
[1:43:31] and come up to believe him God
[1:43:33] recognizes our repentance and our faith
[1:43:35] towards him and sends down the abstract
[1:43:38] and the abstract is the Assurance it's
[1:43:41] the guarantee that everything was ever
[1:43:43] held against you you thoroughly repented
[1:43:46] Hallelujah and the property is bottom
[1:43:49] and you hold the abstract for the
[1:43:52] assurance
[1:43:53] isn't that wonderful to think that he he
[1:43:55] sends it to you but first you've got to
[1:43:57] be completely sold out and we know that
[1:43:59] you'll never Bluff God and you'll never
[1:44:00] Bluff Satan you'll never Bluff either
[1:44:02] one of them but you know Satan will
[1:44:05] always try and Bluff us and make us
[1:44:06] think that we've got the Holy Ghost when
[1:44:08] we don't and then make us think that we
[1:44:09] don't have it when we do he's just going
[1:44:11] to come and try and mess our minds but
[1:44:13] if we can ground ourselves in the word
[1:44:14] brothers and sisters that spirit will
[1:44:16] never have any power over us because
[1:44:18] brother Branham goes on to say let
[1:44:19] somebody try to push you off the land
[1:44:21] and say he belongs and with the abstract
[1:44:24] in your hands when you're holding that
[1:44:26] abstract let Satan come around and say
[1:44:27] nope you don't have the token in your
[1:44:29] hands you can turn around and say no but
[1:44:31] I do have the token in my hands I can
[1:44:33] receive the word for my day I have heard
[1:44:34] that Jubilee sound let somebody try to
[1:44:37] put you off the land say he belongs and
[1:44:39] you with the abstract in your hands let
[1:44:41] them try to do it there there ain't a
[1:44:43] law and the land can do it because you
[1:44:45] hold the abstract there's no devil no
[1:44:47] church no theology that can overstep the
[1:44:50] boundaries of God's proof and Abstract
[1:44:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[1:44:55] recognized us in Christ Jesus we're just
[1:44:58] as sure to raise as he raised because
[1:45:00] potentially we have already raised in
[1:45:03] him amen the whole thing what does it do
[1:45:07] to our mortal bodies it turns our
[1:45:09] opinion
[1:45:11] we let go of things
[1:45:13] it turns our opinion
[1:45:15] it just changes our Notions it sets our
[1:45:18] affections on things which are above and
[1:45:22] the smoking drinking gambling things
[1:45:23] that you used to do is dead it's beneath
[1:45:26] you and you're quickened and this
[1:45:29] quickening power brings your body into a
[1:45:32] raptured condition already
[1:45:33] not someday gonna be brothers and
[1:45:36] sisters it brings us to that raptured
[1:45:37] condition already and the only thing
[1:45:39] that does it is just by saying Amen to
[1:45:41] the word
[1:45:42] but when we refuse the word what are we
[1:45:45] refusing
[1:45:47] I just can't help but think brothers and
[1:45:48] sisters you ain't refusing brother Barry
[1:45:50] you ain't refusing whoever that minister
[1:45:52] is if they're on the word you're
[1:45:54] refusing God careful
[1:46:00] just can't help but think it's time to
[1:46:01] just
[1:46:02] should we put it in second gear and just
[1:46:04] like
[1:46:05] floor it
[1:46:08] hopefully we got the traction control on
[1:46:10] oh my
[1:46:12] Lord have mercy it's just wonderful I
[1:46:15] just can't help but think brothers and
[1:46:16] sisters there's people in the Bible
[1:46:18] in our day that maybe not in our day
[1:46:21] story in the Bible days that that
[1:46:22] actually did hear that Jubilee sound
[1:46:24] when it came through the land and just
[1:46:26] speaking about Jesus we still got 20
[1:46:28] minutes or so I just can't help but
[1:46:31] think there's a few that that really
[1:46:32] were just really good examples of people
[1:46:35] in the Bible that when the Jubilee sound
[1:46:37] was going through the land they heard it
[1:46:39] and nothing was going to shake them from
[1:46:41] getting their blessing nothing was going
[1:46:43] to shake them from receiving the full
[1:46:45] benefit of that Jubilee sound when it
[1:46:47] came and you know the first one I want
[1:46:49] to talk about this morning is is in Luke
[1:46:51] 18 and I'll just read it for the sake of
[1:46:53] time and it came to pass that as he was
[1:46:55] come night unto Jericho speaking of
[1:46:57] Jesus a certain blind man Sat by the
[1:47:00] wayside begging and hearing the
[1:47:03] multitude passed by asked what it meant
[1:47:05] what's going on and what was going on
[1:47:07] brothers and sisters the Jubilee trumpet
[1:47:09] was sounding for him and and as the
[1:47:11] multitude passed by yes what it meant
[1:47:12] and and they told him it's Jesus of
[1:47:15] Nazareth passeth by and what did he do
[1:47:18] brothers and sisters he cried saying
[1:47:20] Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
[1:47:22] and we know that they rebuked him they
[1:47:24] stopped him they said be quiet you don't
[1:47:26] want to disturb the master brother
[1:47:27] Branham says how did he know he was the
[1:47:30] son of David
[1:47:31] how did he know that brothers and
[1:47:33] sisters he had years to hear what the
[1:47:35] spirit saith unto the church and when
[1:47:37] that Jubilee trumpet sounded he
[1:47:40] responded to it and he didn't care what
[1:47:42] anyone was thinking he wasn't worried
[1:47:44] about the deacons at the door he wasn't
[1:47:46] worried about the person sitting beside
[1:47:48] him he wasn't worried about his family
[1:47:50] around him he said Amen to that I'm
[1:47:52] going to get me some of that Jubilee
[1:47:54] sound Oh my he says in 39 and they which
[1:47:58] went before rebuked him that they should
[1:48:01] hold his peace but he cried much thou
[1:48:03] the much more thou son of David have
[1:48:06] mercy on me
[1:48:07] didn't care what anybody was thinking or
[1:48:10] what they said he was willing to confess
[1:48:12] his fault he knew he was blind
[1:48:15] and Jesus stood and commanded him to be
[1:48:18] brought unto him my goodness I just
[1:48:20] can't help but think brothers and
[1:48:22] sisters when we have the opportunity cry
[1:48:24] out to Jesus if it's in a song service
[1:48:26] cry out to Jesus if we're in prayer on
[1:48:29] our knees and he brings something to our
[1:48:31] remembrance cry out to Jesus he will
[1:48:33] come Jesus stood and commanded him to be
[1:48:36] brought unto him and when he was come
[1:48:38] near he asked him saying What wilt thou
[1:48:40] that I should do unto thee Oh My can you
[1:48:43] imagine having him say that unto you
[1:48:45] that happens every time we come to
[1:48:47] church brothers and sisters if you're
[1:48:48] willing to take that Jubilee sound and
[1:48:51] Jesus said unto him receive thy sight
[1:48:53] thy faith hath saved thee and
[1:48:57] immediately he received his sight and
[1:48:59] followed him glorifying God and all the
[1:49:01] people when they saw it they gave praise
[1:49:03] unto God next one is the maniac of
[1:49:05] Galleria Luke 8 26 and when they arrived
[1:49:09] at the country of the gadarians which is
[1:49:10] over against Galilee
[1:49:12] and he went forth to land there he met
[1:49:15] out of the city a certain man which had
[1:49:18] Devils a long time and wear no clothes
[1:49:21] neither a boat at any house but in the
[1:49:23] tombs when he saw Jesus he cried out and
[1:49:26] fell down before him with a loud voice
[1:49:29] and said what have I to do with thee
[1:49:31] Jesus thou Son of God the most high I
[1:49:35] beseech thee torment me not and we know
[1:49:37] this was the devil speaking out to him
[1:49:39] and wasn't it interesting that back in
[1:49:41] that day the most religious people
[1:49:43] couldn't recognize the word when it was
[1:49:45] made flesh and manifest amongst them
[1:49:47] walked amongst them they couldn't
[1:49:48] recognize the word when he came to them
[1:49:50] but the Devils did the Devils recognized
[1:49:53] it
[1:49:55] verse 29 for he had commanded the
[1:49:57] unclean Spirit to come out of the man
[1:49:58] for off times it had caught him and when
[1:50:00] he was kept bound with chains and
[1:50:02] Fetters he break the bands and was
[1:50:04] driven out of the devil Into the
[1:50:05] Wilderness and Jesus asked him saying
[1:50:07] what is thy name and he said Legion
[1:50:09] because many Devils were entered into
[1:50:11] him
[1:50:12] and they besought him that he would not
[1:50:14] command them to go out into the deep
[1:50:17] and we know there was a herd of swine
[1:50:18] there on feeding on the mountain and
[1:50:20] they besought him that he would suffer
[1:50:22] them to enter into them and he suffered
[1:50:23] them and he went then went the Devils
[1:50:26] out of excuse me the man and entered
[1:50:28] into the swine and the herd ran
[1:50:30] violently down a steep Place into the
[1:50:31] lake and were choked
[1:50:34] isn't this story interesting
[1:50:36] that Jubilee sound came to him
[1:50:40] he didn't come to the Jubilee sound it
[1:50:42] came to him and when Jesus brought that
[1:50:45] sound to him what did he do he corrected
[1:50:47] everything
[1:50:48] he healed the Brokenhearted he set at
[1:50:50] captive
[1:50:51] set that Liberty the captive the guy
[1:50:54] that was bound in the Fetters those
[1:50:56] people who were living in sin those
[1:50:59] people who were the swine herders in the
[1:51:02] land of Israel dealing with unclean
[1:51:04] animals
[1:51:05] what did he do he fixed their lives as
[1:51:07] well and and they didn't like it the way
[1:51:09] that he fixed their lives but he brought
[1:51:11] Jubilee to all of their lives all at the
[1:51:14] same time delivered all of them of the
[1:51:16] devils
[1:51:18] but they just didn't want that Jubilee
[1:51:20] sound did they and we know the end of
[1:51:21] this they actually came and and they
[1:51:24] said we don't want you around here you
[1:51:26] got to get out of here you just
[1:51:28] destroyed our income as we live in sin
[1:51:30] and and this man this crazy stuff we
[1:51:33] don't want any of this crazy stuff
[1:51:34] around here you know where there's Holy
[1:51:36] Ghost is there's liberty where the
[1:51:39] spirit of God is brothers and sisters
[1:51:40] it's not going to be a quiet time it's
[1:51:42] not going to be a time of of just being
[1:51:45] silent and and and steady and easy as we
[1:51:49] go when the Holy Ghost comes around it's
[1:51:51] actually a little bit Wild
[1:51:54] you know another one
[1:51:56] someone who actually recognized that
[1:51:58] Jubilee sound as it came in in their day
[1:52:01] is that woman with the blood issue
[1:52:04] out of Luke chapter 8
[1:52:06] and we know this story really well
[1:52:10] this woman she had the blood issue for
[1:52:12] 12 years
[1:52:14] and she'd spent all of her money with
[1:52:16] all of the doctors looking for all of
[1:52:19] the man-made solutions for her problems
[1:52:22] and God many times he likes us to get
[1:52:24] exactly right there doesn't he we talked
[1:52:27] about it last week in the three Hebrew
[1:52:28] kids that were not gonna bow down to any
[1:52:31] image of man they weren't interested in
[1:52:33] it and they said you know what we're
[1:52:35] we're Believers here we don't have to
[1:52:37] worry about this business if you want us
[1:52:39] to Bow Down and Worship another God
[1:52:40] because our God will deliver us and it
[1:52:42] doesn't matter whether he burns Us in
[1:52:43] the fiery furnace or whether we actually
[1:52:45] survive it it doesn't matter
[1:52:47] this woman had gone through everything
[1:52:49] just like those three Hebrew kids she
[1:52:53] had tried it all and she was at the end
[1:52:54] and she heard this gospel trumpet going
[1:52:57] past her way and we know the story where
[1:53:00] she got into the press and while she was
[1:53:02] in the Press that's where she said you
[1:53:04] know what I don't care what anybody says
[1:53:06] and and we know that she would have got
[1:53:08] in big trouble if anybody saw her
[1:53:10] actually approaching a man you cannot do
[1:53:12] that especially under Hebrew law if you
[1:53:15] have a blood condition as a woman you
[1:53:18] have to go through the purification
[1:53:19] process but to touch a random man is
[1:53:23] completely outside of everything but you
[1:53:25] know she didn't care she recognized
[1:53:27] something about this man he had a voice
[1:53:30] she had ears to hear what was happening
[1:53:32] in her day and it was just that little
[1:53:34] Act of Faith reaching out and touching
[1:53:36] the Hem of His Garment and what did it
[1:53:38] do it stopped him in his tracks and he
[1:53:40] said hold on a second wait a second
[1:53:43] I sense that virtue has gone out of me
[1:53:45] virtue has actually gone from me and we
[1:53:48] know virtue is strength virtue has gone
[1:53:50] out of me and we know that the the
[1:53:52] brothers that were there they said
[1:53:53] Master what are you talking about
[1:53:54] there's a hundred people around you
[1:53:56] pressing against you how could you sense
[1:53:57] anybody touched you and he said no no
[1:54:00] everybody else isn't doing what that was
[1:54:02] that was totally different and he turned
[1:54:04] around and he found that woman right he
[1:54:06] found that woman who had that blood
[1:54:07] issue for 12 years who had tried every
[1:54:09] single man-made technique to try and fix
[1:54:11] it but she recognized something
[1:54:13] different was about this man and he said
[1:54:15] woman thy faith hath healed thee you can
[1:54:17] take this and you can go your way
[1:54:19] because thy faith hath made thee whole
[1:54:21] all of the man-made techniques aren't
[1:54:24] going to solve it today but I'll tell
[1:54:25] you what I will solve it because I've
[1:54:27] got the Jubilee trumpet and you can go
[1:54:29] free today
[1:54:31] she was willing to let go of all that
[1:54:34] she thought that she knew she thought
[1:54:35] that maybe she knew how to behave in
[1:54:37] church and what a church service should
[1:54:39] be right but she was willing to say you
[1:54:41] know what I don't care if they throw me
[1:54:43] out I don't care whatever anybody thinks
[1:54:45] I'm getting me some I am going to get my
[1:54:47] Jubilee today and because she did that
[1:54:50] she was healed
[1:54:52] what a tremendous thing you know there
[1:54:54] was there was another one another one
[1:54:57] which is so good I just can't help but
[1:54:59] think about these examples these are all
[1:55:01] examples of that Jubilee trumpet
[1:55:03] sounding and that was for a purpose
[1:55:06] brothers and sisters every single one of
[1:55:08] them is for a purpose you know the pool
[1:55:10] of Bethesda another real familiar story
[1:55:12] a certain man which was there had an
[1:55:15] infirmity 38 years
[1:55:17] 38 years with an infirmity still holding
[1:55:22] on to his religion believing that if he
[1:55:25] could just get down in that pool when
[1:55:27] the angel comes and stirs the waters
[1:55:29] when when when that special time that
[1:55:32] magical time happens if he could just
[1:55:34] get down there just one time and touch
[1:55:36] that water oh he would be made whole
[1:55:41] but every time he would try someone
[1:55:44] would jump in front of him
[1:55:46] brothers and sisters we don't live in a
[1:55:48] case like that today when the waters
[1:55:50] start to stir brothers and sisters all
[1:55:53] you have to do is just Reach Out And
[1:55:54] Touch those Waters just Reach Out And
[1:55:56] Touch the Lord as he passes by and I
[1:55:58] guarantee you you won't be the same
[1:56:00] right that impotent Man by the pool of
[1:56:03] Bethesda he was there 38 years hanging
[1:56:06] on to his religion and when Jesus came
[1:56:09] by Jesus came by specifically
[1:56:12] he saw him lying there and knew that he
[1:56:15] had been there a long time in that case
[1:56:18] and he said to him wilt thou be made
[1:56:21] whole
[1:56:23] what a thought
[1:56:25] that was against every single fiber of
[1:56:27] his religion his religion was if I get
[1:56:29] down in that water there then I'll be
[1:56:31] healed
[1:56:34] but here we have the master comes by his
[1:56:37] way and says
[1:56:39] will you be made whole
[1:56:42] that Jubilee trumpet was sounding will
[1:56:45] you be made whole
[1:56:47] the impotent man he answered him saying
[1:56:50] sir I have no man when the water is
[1:56:52] troubled to put me in the pool he's
[1:56:54] still thinking about his religion his
[1:56:57] natural way this is the only thing that
[1:56:59] I I have any conscious recognition of
[1:57:02] I have no man when the water is troubled
[1:57:04] to put me in the pool
[1:57:06] but while I'm coming another one stepth
[1:57:08] down before me
[1:57:09] Jesus saith unto him rise up
[1:57:13] take up thy bed and walk
[1:57:15] rise up take up thy bed and walk
[1:57:18] and we know immediately the man was made
[1:57:21] whole and took up his bed and walked oh
[1:57:24] but was what was so immediate right
[1:57:26] after that brothers and sisters the
[1:57:28] Believers came around and said oh it's a
[1:57:30] Sunday you can't heal on a Sunday you
[1:57:33] can't do something servile work on a
[1:57:35] Sabbath how could you do that you must
[1:57:37] be a sinner it was the Jubilee trumpet
[1:57:39] showing that there was freedom and
[1:57:41] you're no longer bound by slavery you're
[1:57:43] no longer bound by all of the things
[1:57:45] that you think that you were Bound by
[1:57:47] you know most of the times when we have
[1:57:49] fear in our lives
[1:57:51] it's just it's just an illusion it's not
[1:57:55] even real in our lives but it's what the
[1:57:57] devil uses to try and psych us out to
[1:58:00] try and make us afraid to try and make
[1:58:02] us believe that it's real it's not real
[1:58:04] at all
[1:58:06] I don't know who said it but I know it's
[1:58:07] a famous saying is the only thing we
[1:58:09] need to fear is fear itself
[1:58:12] but fear is a spirit brothers and
[1:58:14] sisters we haven't received the spirit
[1:58:15] upon us again to fear we've received the
[1:58:18] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[1:58:20] Father we recognize who we are we don't
[1:58:22] have to be a slave we don't have to have
[1:58:24] our ears bored we don't have to be able
[1:58:26] to Just Surrender Our Lives to anyone we
[1:58:30] can actually recognize that there is a
[1:58:32] jubilee trumpet sound for us today and
[1:58:34] that is the message of the hour that's
[1:58:36] Revelations 10 7. but you know it
[1:58:38] doesn't just stop there there's 8 to 11
[1:58:41] we need to take that little book and eat
[1:58:42] it up we have to do that brothers and
[1:58:44] sisters we've got to be willing to do
[1:58:46] that if we don't then that spirit that
[1:58:49] we're given will actually starve in our
[1:58:51] lives we've got to eat the book we heard
[1:58:53] it on Wednesday night a chapter in the
[1:58:55] morning and a chapter at night maybe
[1:58:56] it's two chapters throughout the day but
[1:58:58] there's something special about when you
[1:59:00] wake up the very first thing in our
[1:59:01] lives is to read the word of God and
[1:59:03] then when we go to sleep the last thing
[1:59:05] we think about is the word of God
[1:59:08] something about that
[1:59:10] how many impotent people do we have in
[1:59:12] our lives how many times have we been
[1:59:15] that impotent man I just can't move I
[1:59:17] just can't get to the waters I know that
[1:59:20] I've got this need but I just can't get
[1:59:21] there you know what brothers and sisters
[1:59:23] many times we hear people say that too I
[1:59:25] can never live it you know what you will
[1:59:27] never live it and you'll never get there
[1:59:29] the only thing you've got to do is just
[1:59:31] accept that trumpet sound when it comes
[1:59:33] in your ears if you're willing to do
[1:59:35] that you're actually going to be saved
[1:59:38] the last one that I want to get to which
[1:59:41] I think is so good because it's just at
[1:59:43] the end of Jesus life to there was two
[1:59:46] men on the cross crucified with Jesus
[1:59:49] wasn't there
[1:59:51] they're both male factors they were both
[1:59:53] guilty and the one in the middle he
[1:59:55] wasn't guilty but there was one that
[1:59:58] said come on why don't you save us
[1:59:59] imagine how they must have cried out in
[2:00:01] pain oh can't you save us you're the the
[2:00:04] Son of God the most high just just get
[2:00:06] us down off this cross come on man when
[2:00:08] you're saving yourself save me too and
[2:00:10] you know the other one he heard that
[2:00:12] Jubilee sound and in his very last
[2:00:15] breath he was saying you know that man
[2:00:17] is an innocent man and you know we're
[2:00:20] both guilty and we both deserve what
[2:00:21] we're getting right now and brothers and
[2:00:23] sisters that's the place we need to get
[2:00:25] to as Believers we need to recognize
[2:00:27] that we are male factors born in sin
[2:00:29] shaped in iniquity come in this world's
[2:00:31] vegan lives we've got to be saved but if
[2:00:33] we're willing to accept that gospel
[2:00:35] Jubilee sound in our ears that's come
[2:00:37] the way it came in our day than we too
[2:00:40] will be saved because we know that Jesus
[2:00:41] said hey you know what this guy here he
[2:00:44] actually is righteous you will be with
[2:00:46] me in Paradise today but this other one
[2:00:48] I don't know about him I can't say much
[2:00:50] for him but what a wonderful thought to
[2:00:52] think that that man was actually given
[2:00:55] the ability to hear the gospel trumpet
[2:00:57] that Jubilee sound
[2:01:00] I'll just read this here verse 39 and
[2:01:02] one of the male factors which were
[2:01:04] hanged on railed on him saying if thou
[2:01:06] be Christ save thyself on us but the
[2:01:08] other answering rebuked him saying thus
[2:01:10] not thou fear God seeing Thou Art in the
[2:01:13] same condemnation and indeed justly for
[2:01:16] we received the due reward of our Deeds
[2:01:18] but this man hath done nothing to miss
[2:01:21] and he said unto Jesus the Lord remember
[2:01:25] me when thou comest into thy kingdom
[2:01:28] and Jesus said unto him
[2:01:30] verily I say unto thee today shalt thou
[2:01:34] be with me in Paradise
[2:01:36] brothers and sisters
[2:01:38] I'm just going to stop there I'll just
[2:01:40] invite the musicians today
[2:01:43] I just want to encourage every one of us
[2:01:46] not to hold on to anything
[2:01:48] don't let there be anything that we're
[2:01:50] holding on to except for this word this
[2:01:51] message of the hour if there's anything
[2:01:53] in our life that we're holding on to
[2:01:54] it's going to destroy us that's what
[2:01:57] will happen to us it will destroy us it
[2:02:01] doesn't matter what it is it doesn't
[2:02:02] matter how it's happened if we're
[2:02:05] holding on to anything except for this
[2:02:07] word it's going to destroy us
[2:02:09] taking a look at these examples that we
[2:02:11] gave maybe stand with me this morning as
[2:02:13] we close taking a look at the examples
[2:02:15] that we've given the the the
[2:02:18] one on the cross the male Factor the
[2:02:21] pool of Bethesda the woman with the
[2:02:23] blood issue
[2:02:25] the maniac of Galleria
[2:02:27] all of these people
[2:02:30] all of their problems
[2:02:32] the blind man that cried out oh thou son
[2:02:36] of David have mercy upon me isn't it
[2:02:39] interesting that every single one of
[2:02:40] them
[2:02:41] received a body change
[2:02:45] something in their body was changed
[2:02:48] today brothers and sisters we're looking
[2:02:51] for a body change the whole entire world
[2:02:53] is looking for a body change but we're
[2:02:55] looking for the right one and the only
[2:02:57] way we're going to get that body change
[2:02:58] that we're looking for is by this word
[2:03:01] let's just bow in prayer gracious
[2:03:03] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus today we just
[2:03:06] love you we thank you for your goodness
[2:03:08] to us Lord we thank you for this word
[2:03:10] father I pray that not one of us would
[2:03:12] have our Our Gospel ears bored with an
[2:03:16] owl father I pray that every one of us
[2:03:19] Lord Jesus would let go of the things
[2:03:21] that so easily beset us father
[2:03:25] Lord Jesus we know that Satan will allow
[2:03:27] things to happen in our lives we know
[2:03:30] you will allow Satan
[2:03:33] to allow things to happen in our lives
[2:03:36] to bring things out father that need to
[2:03:38] be brought out from undercover when we
[2:03:40] have problems in our lives it's because
[2:03:42] you've allowed it to actually manifest
[2:03:44] to show us there's something more to
[2:03:47] deal with and father this morning I pray
[2:03:49] that Lord even though we long to soar in
[2:03:52] the mountaintops father we know that
[2:03:54] life is in the valley
[2:03:56] and father we pray that Lord Jesus when
[2:03:58] you come by our way that you would see
[2:04:01] fig trees full of figs Lord Jesus that
[2:04:03] you wouldn't see a fig tree that's just
[2:04:05] barren
[2:04:07] father we pray that you would just allow
[2:04:09] us to accept the word that you've given
[2:04:11] to us father in our day
[2:04:13] entirely Lord without reservations
[2:04:16] father Lord let us not hold on to any
[2:04:18] past issues or problems but just to move
[2:04:21] on with you father and allow you to live
[2:04:24] out through US father we pray that you
[2:04:26] would bless your children today Father
[2:04:28] we just ask that you would be with Lord
[2:04:30] Brother Sam's family brother Shepard and
[2:04:32] sister Sharon Lord Jesus wherever they
[2:04:35] are father we just ask that you would
[2:04:37] bless them abundantly father Lord we
[2:04:39] just love the body of Jesus Christ we
[2:04:42] love our our family that you've given us
[2:04:43] father when we pray that you would just
[2:04:45] go with each one of us as we go our
[2:04:47] separate ways Lord
[2:04:48] until we meet again father if it be here
[2:04:51] will for us to meet again on Wednesday
