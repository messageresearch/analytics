[53:41] that John
[53:42] he was in the spirit
[53:44] on the original Father's Day
[53:46] he was able to get a glimpse of heaven
[53:49] and see
[53:50] Our Father
[53:52] on his throne
[53:54] certainly like to
[53:56] thank the Lord for the ability for the
[53:59] fathers to be who they are
[54:02] you know the word says to raise up a
[54:05] child in the way they should go train
[54:08] them up in the way they should go and it
[54:10] won't depart from them
[54:13] and we know many times we can look at it
[54:15] and see
[54:17] the children making their own decisions
[54:19] after a little while
[54:21] and parents can only do so much they can
[54:23] only go so far but they can plant the
[54:26] seed
[54:27] and it's up to God to bring that seed to
[54:30] life in their lives it's not up to the
[54:32] parents
[54:33] we're certainly thankful for that life
[54:36] that God gives us
[54:38] God bless you each and every father out
[54:41] there today
[54:44] certainly excited about next Sunday
[54:48] not to diminish today because we have a
[54:51] tremendous opportunity to fellowship
[54:53] with the king of kings and Lord of lords
[54:56] right here and now knowing that he is
[54:58] here
[55:00] but next Sunday
[55:02] Lord willing will have no restrictions
[55:06] the only thing that we may have will be
[55:08] masks
[55:09] if the City of Calgary keeps it
[55:12] we will see
[55:14] we'll have two Services next Sunday and
[55:17] next Sunday evening was supposed to be
[55:19] brother Gilbert
[55:21] and then it changed and it was going to
[55:23] be brother Mervin
[55:26] nobody knew that yet but I'm just saying
[55:29] and it's changed yet again
[55:32] if we open next week all the way I would
[55:36] like to have a worship service I'd like
[55:38] to get together Sunday evening
[55:41] and have a worship service
[55:43] I I think that we have gone through one
[55:48] of the greatest trials I know that I've
[55:50] experienced
[55:51] being in the ministry being in the
[55:53] church
[55:54] to think that all of the restrictions
[55:57] that we've had
[56:00] are going to be lifted
[56:02] now we will have the opportunity to get
[56:04] together as a body of believers
[56:07] and just worship
[56:10] we certainly want to be able to do that
[56:12] so we'll see
[56:15] um what the Lord has in store
[56:19] um we're certainly looking forward to no
[56:21] more restrictions seeing the church get
[56:23] together and uh
[56:24] yeah we'll see we'll see what we can do
[56:27] next month I think we can look for the
[56:30] calendar to uh to reflect regular
[56:33] programming I I probably got it wrong
[56:36] didn't I
[56:38] can see that I I did
[56:41] sorry it's the 27th I got excited
[56:45] once the restrictions lift
[56:47] the first Sunday evening service we will
[56:49] have a worship service
[56:51] and uh I just would like to get everyone
[56:54] together who wants to come who would
[56:56] like to Fellowship
[56:57] and uh we'll just sing we'll praise the
[57:00] Lord if someone has a special if you'd
[57:02] like to bring a special
[57:04] go ahead and bring it we're not really
[57:06] going to do a testimony service we'll
[57:08] save that for the communion we just like
[57:10] to have a real good worship service
[57:12] one of the things that was mentioned too
[57:14] uh um in our discussion was if you have
[57:17] a friend somebody you think might enjoy
[57:20] a worship service bring them bring them
[57:23] out
[57:24] let's see if we can't uh witness to some
[57:26] folks as well
[57:28] we will create a schedule and we'll make
[57:31] it as clear as possible on the schedule
[57:34] sometimes I get up here and I get
[57:35] nervous I get excited I apologize I
[57:39] don't mean to confuse anyone I'm
[57:41] confused enough as it is
[57:43] but I just want to get together and
[57:45] worship again
[57:46] and I'm certainly looking forward to
[57:48] that
[57:49] next month we'll commence Lord willing
[57:52] with communion foot washing will
[57:55] commence with Sunday School
[57:57] we had the discussion and typically
[57:58] before we would shut Sunday school down
[58:00] over the summer
[58:01] but I don't know what else we will
[58:04] really be doing this summer so we'll uh
[58:06] open up Sunday school and we'll just go
[58:10] fully ahead we don't know what the Lord
[58:12] has in store we could have another
[58:14] strange shutdown we'll just see
[58:18] so we'll have uh basically regular
[58:20] scheduled items for next month
[58:23] Sunday school Lethbridge services
[58:26] and we'll just see what the Lord will do
[58:30] Lord willing we won't have to do this
[58:31] very much longer
[58:33] we have another one
[58:37] praise the Lord we've got communication
[58:40] yes sir
[58:41] we put it on the calendar and uh
[58:45] I may have confused it maybe by not
[58:48] mentioning it or
[58:50] however but we have a comedian service
[58:52] tonight
[58:53] for anyone that would like to
[58:54] participate
[58:56] the group that's on the calendar tonight
[58:58] will be the ones that come to the
[59:00] service in the building
[59:01] and then everyone else if you would like
[59:04] to participate please just queue in the
[59:06] parking lot
[59:07] and we will start the service and filter
[59:10] through just like we did the last couple
[59:12] times
[59:13] with the groups of folks and uh
[59:15] hopefully we'll have just a convenient
[59:17] service tonight
[59:18] and uh yeah
[59:21] we'll have some of the the bread of life
[59:24] commemorate the Lord's
[59:26] Lord's body
[59:30] so happy Father's Day
[59:32] my brothers my sisters
[59:34] that's it for the announcements and uh
[59:37] maybe we could just have a word of
[59:38] Prayer
[59:39] gracious Heavenly Father we're just so
[59:41] thankful that we can be called Sons and
[59:43] Daughters of God
[59:44] behold what manner of love you have for
[59:47] us Lord
[59:50] Lord Jesus we pray that you would just
[59:52] bless our little service this morning
[59:54] pray Lord Jesus that you would just take
[59:56] the bread of life and break it to us
[59:58] fresh once again Lord that you would
[1:00:01] just speak to our very Souls Lord that
[1:00:04] you would just encourage each and every
[1:00:06] one of us father
[1:00:08] by Your Word
[1:00:10] we just ask that you would be glorified
[1:00:12] now and all that said and all that's
[1:00:14] done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:00:19] thank you musicians if you have your
[1:00:21] Bibles this morning I'd like to read
[1:00:22] from Saint John
[1:00:24] chapter 6.
[1:00:29] continuing on in the
[1:00:32] the
[1:00:35] Book of John
[1:00:40] maybe just a little different
[1:00:41] perspective today
[1:00:45] Saint John chapter 6. we'll start
[1:00:47] reading with verse
[1:00:49] 26.
[1:00:55] Jesus answered them and said verily
[1:00:57] verily I say unto you
[1:01:00] ye seek me
[1:01:02] not because ye saw the Miracles
[1:01:05] but because
[1:01:07] ye did eat of the loaves
[1:01:10] and were filled
[1:01:12] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[1:01:15] but for the meat which endureth unto
[1:01:17] everlasting life which the son of man
[1:01:20] shall give unto you
[1:01:22] for him
[1:01:24] hath God the Father sealed
[1:01:27] then said they unto him what shall we do
[1:01:32] that we might
[1:01:34] work the works of God
[1:01:37] Jesus answered and said unto them this
[1:01:39] is the work of God that ye believe on
[1:01:41] him
[1:01:42] whom he hath sent
[1:01:45] then said
[1:01:47] they said therefore unto him what signs
[1:01:50] show us thou then that we may see and
[1:01:53] believe thee
[1:01:55] what Dost thou work
[1:01:58] our fathers did eat Manna in the desert
[1:02:00] as it is written he gave them bread from
[1:02:03] Heaven to eat
[1:02:05] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:02:08] I say unto you Moses gave you not that
[1:02:11] bread from heaven but my father giveth
[1:02:14] you the true bread from heaven
[1:02:17] for the bread of God is he which cometh
[1:02:20] down from heaven and giveth life
[1:02:23] unto the world
[1:02:25] then said they unto him Lord Evermore
[1:02:29] give us this bread
[1:02:31] and Jesus said unto them I am the bread
[1:02:34] of life
[1:02:36] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[1:02:39] and he that believeth on me shall never
[1:02:41] thirst
[1:02:42] but I said unto you that ye also have
[1:02:46] seen me
[1:02:47] and believe not
[1:02:49] all that the father giveth me shall come
[1:02:52] unto me and him that cometh to me I will
[1:02:55] in no wise cast out
[1:02:57] for I came down from heaven not to do
[1:02:59] mine own will but the will of him that
[1:03:02] sent me
[1:03:03] and this is the Father's will which hath
[1:03:05] sent me
[1:03:06] that all of which he hath given me I
[1:03:10] should lose nothing
[1:03:12] but should raise it up again at the last
[1:03:14] day
[1:03:15] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:03:18] that every one of everyone which seeth
[1:03:22] the son and belieth on him may have
[1:03:24] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[1:03:28] at the last day
[1:03:30] let's just bow one more time gracious
[1:03:33] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[1:03:34] your word we thank you Lord Jesus that
[1:03:37] you are faithful
[1:03:38] and true Lord that you will always come
[1:03:42] where you're invited and Lord Jesus we
[1:03:44] know that you've been invited here we
[1:03:46] know that you're here with us and we
[1:03:48] know that you are a faithful father and
[1:03:51] that you will break this bread unto us
[1:03:53] once again
[1:03:54] father we thank you for your grace and
[1:03:56] your mercy we pray that you would just
[1:03:58] be glorified in all that's said and done
[1:04:00] here now this morning
[1:04:02] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:04:05] God bless you this morning you may be
[1:04:06] seated
[1:04:12] so
[1:04:15] it looks like the uh
[1:04:23] sorry I just got sidetracked here
[1:04:26] talking about this uh
[1:04:29] the scripture this morning kind of goes
[1:04:31] back to where we left off last week
[1:04:33] talking about the woman at the well not
[1:04:35] of Saint John chapter 4.
[1:04:38] you know how the discussion with the
[1:04:41] woman at the well when Jesus was there
[1:04:43] he had this discussion with the woman
[1:04:45] and and the discussion he he led it into
[1:04:48] a spiritual discussion
[1:04:51] but we know the woman spoke carnally
[1:04:54] in our scripture this morning
[1:04:56] looking at this
[1:04:58] the sort of the back
[1:05:00] story here these people that were
[1:05:02] questioning Jesus were the ones that
[1:05:05] actually saw him break the bread
[1:05:08] remember the story about the the boy
[1:05:10] that had the loaves of bread and the
[1:05:12] people were wary and and they needed to
[1:05:14] eat and and the disciples said just send
[1:05:17] them away Jesus said no no let's let's
[1:05:20] feed them knowing what would happen
[1:05:22] and so it was actually the the natural
[1:05:25] typing the spiritual where he took the
[1:05:28] bread and broke it and fed the
[1:05:30] multitudes with that bread and he had
[1:05:33] leftovers
[1:05:35] these people they actually witnessed
[1:05:37] that
[1:05:38] and here they are saying to him
[1:05:41] will show us a sign
[1:05:43] show us something give us something to
[1:05:45] go on so that we could see that you are
[1:05:47] kind of who you you say you are who you
[1:05:50] claim to be
[1:05:51] and how many men in their lives had
[1:05:54] broken bread like that multiplied the
[1:05:57] loaves before in their lives
[1:06:00] but you know the same sort of thing
[1:06:02] repeats here in this scripture he he
[1:06:04] they say
[1:06:06] they say show us a sign and he says you
[1:06:10] know you seek me
[1:06:12] not because you saw the Miracles but
[1:06:13] because you did eat of the Loaves and
[1:06:16] were filled because you were fed that's
[1:06:19] why you seek me and and hopefully you
[1:06:21] can get another free meal but you're
[1:06:23] completely missing the purpose of what
[1:06:25] happened
[1:06:26] and here you are now saying show me
[1:06:29] another sign even though it's happened
[1:06:30] already right before your very eyes
[1:06:35] so he takes them and and starts to lead
[1:06:37] them into a spiritual discussion to say
[1:06:39] hold on a second forget about the
[1:06:42] natural that was just to get your
[1:06:43] attention
[1:06:45] and then they go on to talk carnally and
[1:06:48] he speaks spiritually
[1:06:50] similar to the woman at the well
[1:06:53] only this time he's talking about bread
[1:06:56] the bread of life
[1:06:58] and at the woman at the well they were
[1:07:00] talking about water
[1:07:04] spiritual discussion and the carnal
[1:07:06] discussion
[1:07:08] the woman at the well she spoke carnally
[1:07:12] she knew spiritual things in her life
[1:07:14] remember but she had forgotten them
[1:07:18] she was raised
[1:07:20] spiritually she was taught she probably
[1:07:22] went to Sunday school she was told the
[1:07:25] scripture she understood it because as
[1:07:28] the conversation progressed between
[1:07:29] Jesus and the woman at the well she she
[1:07:32] had an understanding that hold on a
[1:07:34] second sir I perceive that thou art a
[1:07:36] prophet because we know that when
[1:07:38] Messiah comes he'll actually do the
[1:07:40] things that you're doing something's
[1:07:42] something strange about this this sounds
[1:07:44] strangely familiar to what I'm I'm
[1:07:46] remembering from from being a child
[1:07:48] but in her life we know that she had
[1:07:50] forgotten these spiritual things because
[1:07:52] of the carnality
[1:07:54] the things of her life
[1:07:56] had gotten in the way and they clogged
[1:07:59] up the channels
[1:08:00] in her life
[1:08:02] out of this day this scripture is
[1:08:05] fulfilled in 1965 brother Branham says
[1:08:07] when the little woman at the well in her
[1:08:09] immoral conditions come up
[1:08:12] a little panoramic something like this
[1:08:14] to draw some water Jesus had sent his
[1:08:16] disciples away to get vittles
[1:08:19] he didn't want his disciples to be there
[1:08:21] to be a part of this he knew what had to
[1:08:24] happen and he knew it needed to be a
[1:08:26] private conversation
[1:08:28] goes on to say and when she come up to
[1:08:30] draw water he said bring me a drink the
[1:08:33] woman said it's not customary for you to
[1:08:35] say that
[1:08:36] we have segregation here
[1:08:39] now you Jews have nothing to do with us
[1:08:41] Samaritans and we have nothing to do
[1:08:43] with you
[1:08:45] he said but woman if you knew who you
[1:08:47] were talking to you would ask me for a
[1:08:49] drink
[1:08:51] I would give you Waters you don't come
[1:08:54] here to draw
[1:08:57] he found where her condition was
[1:09:00] what it was
[1:09:02] he said go get your husband and come
[1:09:04] here she said I don't have any husband
[1:09:06] he said you've said the truth you've had
[1:09:09] five and the one you're living with now
[1:09:10] is not yours
[1:09:14] she said sir I perceive that thou art a
[1:09:18] prophet
[1:09:19] we know that when Messiah cometh he'll
[1:09:21] show us these things
[1:09:24] Jesus said I am he
[1:09:27] and on that she run into the City and
[1:09:30] said come see a man who's told me the
[1:09:32] things that I've done isn't this the
[1:09:35] very Messiah
[1:09:37] brother Bradham says watch he did that
[1:09:39] before the Jews and the Samaritans
[1:09:42] but never before the Gentiles
[1:09:45] and we know that this is exactly the
[1:09:48] second pull of brother branham's
[1:09:50] Ministry
[1:09:51] the discernment of the heart
[1:09:53] and and I'm not going to really get into
[1:09:55] the polls today
[1:09:57] but I just wanted to identify it with a
[1:09:59] scripture that's exactly the same thing
[1:10:00] the Discerning of the heart but the
[1:10:02] Branham says watch he Jesus did that
[1:10:05] before the Jews and the Samaritans but
[1:10:07] he never did it before the Gentiles
[1:10:10] until
[1:10:11] the end of time
[1:10:13] until the prophet for our day came on
[1:10:15] the scene it wasn't done to the Gentiles
[1:10:19] the Gentiles we people were heathens in
[1:10:21] them days brother Branham says the other
[1:10:23] nations packed a club on our back
[1:10:25] worshiping Idols we wasn't looking for
[1:10:27] no Messiah
[1:10:29] he only appears to those who's looking
[1:10:31] for him
[1:10:33] and we're supposed to be looking for him
[1:10:34] it almost sounds like a contradiction
[1:10:36] the way he says this
[1:10:38] he only appears to those who's looking
[1:10:41] for him and we're supposed to be looking
[1:10:43] for him
[1:10:45] but those who claim to be looking for
[1:10:47] him the church itself when they seen
[1:10:49] that done they said he's a devil he's a
[1:10:52] fortune teller of Beelzebub
[1:10:54] and Jesus said that sin would be
[1:10:56] forgiven them because he hadn't denied
[1:10:58] he hadn't died yet but someday the Holy
[1:11:01] Ghost will come and do the same thing
[1:11:03] and speak one word against it will never
[1:11:06] be forgiven
[1:11:08] and he says that's this day
[1:11:11] where every word has to hang together
[1:11:14] speak a word against it it'll never be
[1:11:17] forgiven in this world or the world to
[1:11:19] come
[1:11:21] it's alarming when you read this and you
[1:11:23] think about the number of people that
[1:11:25] have spoken against the message of the
[1:11:27] hour
[1:11:28] that have spoken against the prophet for
[1:11:31] our day because he didn't come in his
[1:11:33] name he didn't come in his ministry he
[1:11:36] didn't come trying to take people and
[1:11:38] show them something new or different he
[1:11:40] came in the name of the father
[1:11:43] he came with the word of God for our day
[1:11:48] and and he said it so many times it's
[1:11:50] later than we think
[1:11:52] you know talking about the the scripture
[1:11:55] in John chapter 4 in the in the
[1:11:57] scripture in John chapter 6 we'll
[1:11:58] actually spend a little bit of time in
[1:12:00] John chapter 6.
[1:12:02] um we'll see how far we get today with
[1:12:03] it but
[1:12:04] the carnal versus the spiritual
[1:12:06] discussion how how Jesus he used when he
[1:12:10] was here he would use the natural to
[1:12:13] type the spiritual
[1:12:15] he would use a simple statement like
[1:12:17] bring me a drink or get me a drink and
[1:12:19] the woman
[1:12:21] would would begin to explain all the
[1:12:23] reasons why not
[1:12:24] and and it's interesting to think that
[1:12:27] the the carnal versus the spiritual it
[1:12:29] can happen to us in our day
[1:12:32] as we live our lives we contend with
[1:12:34] with all of the carnality in church we
[1:12:37] tend with the carnality in our homes and
[1:12:40] our our lives and our families
[1:12:42] but yet the spiritual is running
[1:12:44] parallel all the way along
[1:12:47] sometimes we have to take a step
[1:12:49] backwards and take a look at the big
[1:12:51] picture as we've heard it said many
[1:12:52] times
[1:12:53] and not get caught up in in in the Small
[1:12:57] Things the carnal things
[1:13:00] it can be very easy to get distracted
[1:13:02] and to see the the channels get clogged
[1:13:05] up
[1:13:06] you know there's a there's a there's a
[1:13:08] scripture in Luke chapter 10.
[1:13:10] where Jesus talks about the carnal and
[1:13:14] the spiritual
[1:13:15] and and it's an interesting sort of
[1:13:18] description of the situation in in Luke
[1:13:21] chapter 10 verse 40. I'll just read it
[1:13:25] for the sake of time this morning it's
[1:13:27] about Martha and Mary and and having
[1:13:28] Jesus in the home and and and and and
[1:13:32] fellowshipping with the King of Kings
[1:13:35] but Martha was cumbered about much
[1:13:38] serving
[1:13:39] and came to him and said Lord thus not
[1:13:42] thou care
[1:13:43] that my sister hath left me to serve
[1:13:46] alone
[1:13:47] bid her therefore that she should help
[1:13:49] me
[1:13:50] and Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:13:52] Martha Martha Thou Art careful and
[1:13:55] troubled about many things
[1:13:57] but one thing is needful
[1:14:00] and Mary hath chosen that good part
[1:14:04] which shall not be taken away from her
[1:14:06] imagine how that must have felt for her
[1:14:10] for Martha to be so caught up in fussing
[1:14:13] and trying to make everything perfect
[1:14:14] and and going and getting and bringing
[1:14:16] and doing and and making it just perfect
[1:14:18] for the master while he was there and
[1:14:20] and seeing her sister just sit back and
[1:14:23] and and have all the fun and and take in
[1:14:26] all of the teachings of the master
[1:14:29] you know this this just stirs up some
[1:14:31] memories for me I remember brother Ken
[1:14:33] preaching a real good service about this
[1:14:35] very scripture here and how we can get
[1:14:38] so caught up in our lives thinking that
[1:14:41] we need to be doing and and acting and
[1:14:44] and bringing and getting and and making
[1:14:47] it happen
[1:14:48] instead of just sitting at the Master's
[1:14:50] feet and allowing him to wash us with
[1:14:52] the water of the word
[1:14:57] the carnal and the spiritual
[1:14:59] sometimes
[1:15:01] we can get caught up
[1:15:03] being a little carnal and trying to make
[1:15:05] it happen when we really shouldn't be
[1:15:08] when we should be allowing the Lord
[1:15:11] to bring it to pass in our lives
[1:15:15] speaking about this bread of life
[1:15:19] we can uh
[1:15:22] take a look at verse 26 how how Jesus
[1:15:25] said you seek me
[1:15:27] you seek me so that you can eat
[1:15:29] but you're really not seeing the full
[1:15:31] picture today
[1:15:32] you're just thinking about the carnal
[1:15:34] side of things
[1:15:36] and you know
[1:15:38] it's interesting that brother Branham
[1:15:40] talked about it in his day how
[1:15:42] a church
[1:15:44] it got to the place with with the
[1:15:46] doctrines of men that they brought in
[1:15:48] how the churches they needed to go after
[1:15:52] people in a carnal way and and have soup
[1:15:56] kitchens and and have fellowships where
[1:15:59] they feed the people and and and sell
[1:16:02] meals to the people to try and raise
[1:16:03] money so that the church could carry on
[1:16:07] but if they were actually not doing sort
[1:16:10] of the the carnal if they would take a
[1:16:12] step back and look at it from the
[1:16:13] spiritual they would be able to preach
[1:16:15] the word in its fullness if they could
[1:16:18] do that then the Lord would actually
[1:16:21] look after all the rest of it
[1:16:23] but instead
[1:16:25] the churches try and make it happen
[1:16:27] carnally speaking
[1:16:30] and we need to be careful that way
[1:16:31] ourselves in our lives
[1:16:34] we can try and do that in our marriages
[1:16:38] try and make it happen
[1:16:40] but we have scriptural principles if we
[1:16:42] just follow those
[1:16:44] and allow the Lord to do it then it will
[1:16:46] work
[1:16:48] same thing with our children
[1:16:50] we can try and
[1:16:51] save our children
[1:16:54] but that's not going to work it will
[1:16:56] only go so far our children will conform
[1:17:00] for a Time
[1:17:02] but that word needs to come to pass in
[1:17:05] their lives
[1:17:08] and if you've trained them up in the way
[1:17:09] they shall go
[1:17:11] God's word will not be defeated
[1:17:15] Satan will come around and try and say
[1:17:17] to us maybe oh look at them look at
[1:17:19] their lives look at look at the
[1:17:21] testimony that they're they're living
[1:17:24] it won't change God's word God's word
[1:17:27] can't be stopped
[1:17:29] God's word will come to pass
[1:17:33] it has to
[1:17:36] but we can get caught up trying to do
[1:17:39] the carnal looking at the carnal
[1:17:40] observing the carnal and and missing the
[1:17:43] entire big picture of what God's doing
[1:17:46] you know the entire world is caught up
[1:17:49] in looking at the carnal right now
[1:17:52] and and totally looking at all of the
[1:17:54] carnality that's going on
[1:17:57] it's it's amazing to think that a
[1:18:00] prophet a Vindicated Prophet has come in
[1:18:04] this day and the world has just rejected
[1:18:06] them just completely rejected them and
[1:18:09] and he came and even preached the
[1:18:12] message indictment he indicts this
[1:18:14] generation for the second crucifixion of
[1:18:16] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:19] but this bread of life that we're
[1:18:21] talking about today
[1:18:23] he says to these people
[1:18:25] you seek me just so that you can eat so
[1:18:28] that you can fill your bellies and and
[1:18:29] look after the the carnal side of things
[1:18:32] but you're you're not seeing the full
[1:18:33] picture I I broke that bread and fed the
[1:18:37] multitude of people Naturally Speaking
[1:18:40] but you know what they're all going to
[1:18:42] hunger again
[1:18:43] they're all going to be hungry very soon
[1:18:46] he said labor not for the natural
[1:18:50] but labor for the spiritual
[1:18:55] the spiritual that shall come from the
[1:18:57] Son of Man
[1:18:58] it parallels the son of man Ministry
[1:19:01] today
[1:19:03] what Jesus was talking about there
[1:19:05] in verse 28 they say to him what shall
[1:19:09] we do
[1:19:10] it's very interesting because it's it's
[1:19:13] kind of like John chapter 4 verse 14 4
[1:19:16] 15 chapter 4 verse 15 the woman at the
[1:19:19] well she said give give me of this water
[1:19:22] let me try it the way that you're
[1:19:24] talking about in in sort of a a cynical
[1:19:26] way you know maybe I don't have to draw
[1:19:28] water the way that I used to that I
[1:19:31] could just get away from all of this
[1:19:33] carnality
[1:19:35] but the people said to him what shall we
[1:19:37] do and he told them exactly what you
[1:19:39] need to do all you need to do is believe
[1:19:42] he said the same thing to the woman at
[1:19:44] the well
[1:19:45] she said we know that when Messiah come
[1:19:47] he'll do all these things and he said I
[1:19:50] who talk to you am he
[1:19:52] he told her
[1:19:55] in Acts chapter 2.
[1:19:58] you know the people they heard a sermon
[1:20:00] preached
[1:20:02] after the
[1:20:03] the falling of the the Holy Spirit
[1:20:06] Peter went out
[1:20:08] under the influence of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:10] the Holy Spirit giving utterance
[1:20:13] he spoke to them
[1:20:15] and he said therefore let all the house
[1:20:17] of Israel know assuredly that God hath
[1:20:21] made the same Jesus whom ye hath both
[1:20:24] crucified both Lord and Christ
[1:20:28] and now when they heard this they were
[1:20:30] pricked in their heart
[1:20:32] and they said unto the rest of the
[1:20:34] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:20:36] do what how can we how can we do
[1:20:39] something about this there's got to be
[1:20:40] something carnally that we can do to
[1:20:41] make this right
[1:20:43] then said Peter unto them repent to be
[1:20:45] baptized every one of you in the name
[1:20:47] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:20:49] your sins and ye shall receive the gift
[1:20:52] of the Holy Ghost for the promise is
[1:20:54] unto you
[1:20:55] and to your children and all those that
[1:20:58] are afar off even as many as the Lord
[1:20:59] Our God should call
[1:21:02] they were given
[1:21:04] the opportunity to do the comparison
[1:21:06] between the natural and the spiritual
[1:21:10] and then they were given the instruction
[1:21:12] on how to actually act on it
[1:21:14] when they asked they had the desire in
[1:21:17] their heart what should we do how can we
[1:21:19] do something about this how can we make
[1:21:21] it right
[1:21:23] out of Harvest Time talking about this
[1:21:25] uh this bread of life brother Branham
[1:21:28] speaking here he says we we thinking of
[1:21:31] this
[1:21:32] that him saying himself now that I am
[1:21:37] the bread of life
[1:21:39] now how could this man be the bread of
[1:21:41] life we're speaking out of John John
[1:21:44] chapter 6 here
[1:21:46] how
[1:21:49] how could this man be the bread of life
[1:21:51] that's what we wonder
[1:21:53] my body is bread he said and now how
[1:21:57] could this man be bred
[1:21:59] that's kind of strange
[1:22:01] but don't be puzzled by it
[1:22:04] I love how how he just explains this
[1:22:06] here don't be puzzled by it
[1:22:08] people of his time they got puzzled
[1:22:11] about it they didn't know
[1:22:14] how that this man could actually be bred
[1:22:17] himself
[1:22:21] how how could this man this is me
[1:22:24] speaking now how could this man say that
[1:22:26] you know he that believeth on me as the
[1:22:29] as the scriptures said
[1:22:31] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:22:34] Living Water
[1:22:35] the natural and then the spiritual
[1:22:38] back to the Natural again he just did
[1:22:41] the comparisons and Drew the parallels
[1:22:45] also in Saint John 1 it is given to us
[1:22:47] this way brother Brown speaking here
[1:22:49] that in the beginning was the word and
[1:22:51] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:22:53] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:22:56] dwelt Among Us
[1:22:58] so the word became the bread
[1:23:01] and remember as we've talked about that
[1:23:04] scripture that we just read out of Saint
[1:23:05] John 1 there's a bunch of verses in
[1:23:08] between the two verses it's not just
[1:23:10] those two verses
[1:23:13] also in Saint John 1 it is given to us
[1:23:16] this way that in the beginning was the
[1:23:18] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:23:20] was God and the word
[1:23:22] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so the
[1:23:26] word became bread
[1:23:29] brother Brown I'm speaking here the word
[1:23:32] and the bread here would have to be the
[1:23:35] same
[1:23:37] because Jesus is the word
[1:23:40] and he is the bread
[1:23:43] now how could he be bread and word
[1:23:48] it would be puzzling to the carnal mind
[1:23:55] he goes on to say but we're hoping this
[1:23:57] morning
[1:23:58] that there's no carnal Minds Among Us
[1:24:02] that there is a spiritual mind Among Us
[1:24:07] that we could understand what the father
[1:24:09] is trying to get to us here
[1:24:12] and you might be saying we're trying to
[1:24:14] understand what the father might be
[1:24:15] trying to get to us here through brother
[1:24:17] Berry what are you trying to say here
[1:24:19] I'll I'll just say it plainly the only
[1:24:21] way that I could say it is that he
[1:24:23] Compares himself carnally
[1:24:26] to the spiritually he'll he'll use a
[1:24:30] carnal type to get our attention to
[1:24:32] bring us to the spiritual word
[1:24:36] he says but we're hoping here this
[1:24:38] morning that there's no carnal Minds
[1:24:40] Among Us that there is a spiritual mind
[1:24:42] Among Us what does he say in the word
[1:24:44] let this mind
[1:24:46] be in you which was also in Christ
[1:24:51] that's the mind we're talking about
[1:24:52] today his mind
[1:24:55] that there is a spiritual mind Among Us
[1:24:57] that we could understand what the father
[1:24:59] is trying to get to us here see these
[1:25:02] words are puzzling
[1:25:04] but at the same time they are scriptural
[1:25:07] truths see
[1:25:09] I just love the way the prophet for our
[1:25:11] Day brings this
[1:25:13] he makes it understandable
[1:25:15] in a way that I feel like I could
[1:25:17] understand it
[1:25:18] you know Jesus here in in John chapter 6
[1:25:21] he says labor not for the meat which
[1:25:23] perisheth but for that meech meat which
[1:25:26] endureth unto everlasting life which the
[1:25:30] son of man shall give unto you
[1:25:33] for him hath God the Father sealed
[1:25:38] today brothers and sisters
[1:25:40] we have been given the ability to see
[1:25:43] the full picture
[1:25:44] back in that day in Jesus day when he
[1:25:48] was there with those those folks that
[1:25:50] saw him break the bread and break the
[1:25:52] Loaves and multiply it and see all the
[1:25:55] many signs and wonders in Jesus life
[1:25:58] they couldn't see the full picture
[1:26:00] they could only see part of the picture
[1:26:03] and and up until the day that we had a
[1:26:07] prophet Vindicated on earth once again
[1:26:10] we only saw a partial picture
[1:26:13] but you know there's a group of people
[1:26:15] we know this who have been given the
[1:26:18] ability to see the full picture
[1:26:20] and it's no longer a partial picture
[1:26:23] for some folks it still is a partial
[1:26:25] picture and you know I'm not going to
[1:26:27] make any bones about it not everyone is
[1:26:29] at the same spiritual walk
[1:26:32] I think it was brother Tom Ernest that
[1:26:35] said it we live in a in a one-room
[1:26:38] schoolhouse there's people that are
[1:26:40] professors and there's people who are in
[1:26:44] pre-preschool here
[1:26:46] everyone is at a different level of walk
[1:26:48] and there's nothing wrong with that
[1:26:50] that's according to the choice of the
[1:26:52] father
[1:26:53] and we would never want to actually
[1:26:55] treat anybody any different than the way
[1:26:58] the Lord would want them to be treated
[1:27:00] we would that everyone would come to the
[1:27:02] knowledge of the truth in our day amen
[1:27:05] but we've been given the ability to see
[1:27:07] the full picture if we want to look at
[1:27:09] it
[1:27:10] you know since the Book of Genesis the
[1:27:12] world has only ever seen half a rainbow
[1:27:16] I thought that was astounding when I
[1:27:18] heard that since since the book of since
[1:27:21] the world began the world has only ever
[1:27:24] seen half of a rainbow
[1:27:26] since the Book of Genesis
[1:27:29] but you know the prophet for our day has
[1:27:31] taken us right into the throne room of
[1:27:33] almighty God
[1:27:34] the scripture
[1:27:36] that was actually written
[1:27:39] that everybody studied and learned
[1:27:41] throughout all of the ages it was a
[1:27:43] hidden Mystery
[1:27:45] but it's not hidden Mystery anymore
[1:27:49] I hear some some people
[1:27:52] speak about the message of the hour as
[1:27:54] though it still is a hidden Mystery and
[1:27:57] I'm not talking about people here I'm
[1:27:58] speaking about Ministry
[1:28:00] and and it's amazing because it's almost
[1:28:02] like they say it in such a way that it
[1:28:04] can cause a gathering around the the
[1:28:08] thought that they have in in their lives
[1:28:10] and and maybe the gift that God has
[1:28:12] given them and I'm certainly not trying
[1:28:14] to throw off on anybody what I am saying
[1:28:17] is that it's not a hidden Mystery any
[1:28:19] longer once upon a time it was a hidden
[1:28:21] Mystery
[1:28:22] we know that all of the Mysteries have
[1:28:24] been revealed in our day
[1:28:27] but the prophet for our day has taken us
[1:28:29] right into the throne room of almighty
[1:28:31] God in in the Book of Revelations if we
[1:28:34] read the church age book we can see this
[1:28:37] picture painted
[1:28:39] and he's shown for the first time
[1:28:42] through the son of man Ministry now
[1:28:45] we know that Jesus spoke about being the
[1:28:47] son of man when the son of man was with
[1:28:48] you but now we're talking about the son
[1:28:51] of man Ministry the son of man Ministry
[1:28:53] is painting the whole entire picture but
[1:28:57] you know brother Branham speaks about it
[1:28:58] in one of the messages how important it
[1:29:00] is to understand the perspective we need
[1:29:03] to take to the entire picture unless we
[1:29:07] come God's provided way we will not see
[1:29:10] the entire picture
[1:29:12] we'll just look at it and say well there
[1:29:14] is a cloud
[1:29:15] or we'll say there's a yeah there's a
[1:29:17] halo over his head in the Houston
[1:29:18] Coliseum and and that's God's man and
[1:29:21] you know it was documented and it's
[1:29:23] great the FBI has a picture and says it
[1:29:25] and and it's in the the FBI Hall of Fame
[1:29:28] and and yeah it's great
[1:29:30] but there's others that will say you
[1:29:32] know
[1:29:33] there's something about that there's
[1:29:35] something about that that means way more
[1:29:37] than what the whole world actually looks
[1:29:40] at and sees it's not just a Halo it's
[1:29:43] the pillar of fire over top of the
[1:29:46] servant of God who is actually trying to
[1:29:49] be made a mockery of but we know his
[1:29:52] word says that God will not be mocked
[1:29:55] openly in front of all of the
[1:29:57] nominational world there
[1:29:59] Dr Beth said that he would attack his
[1:30:01] hide to his study wall
[1:30:03] can you imagine that we just read that
[1:30:06] that you know there's some things that
[1:30:08] just won't be forgiven in this world or
[1:30:10] the world to come
[1:30:12] there certainly will be some answers one
[1:30:14] day
[1:30:16] but for the first time
[1:30:18] through the son of man Ministry
[1:30:21] we've been able to see the full picture
[1:30:26] understanding of why the carnal
[1:30:30] representation
[1:30:31] to give us the spiritual direction to
[1:30:34] give us the spiritual explanation
[1:30:37] in Revelations 4 verse 3 the one that
[1:30:39] sat on the throne
[1:30:41] he wasn't surrounded by half a rainbow
[1:30:44] was he
[1:30:45] he was surrounded by a full rainbow and
[1:30:48] it was the prophet for our day that
[1:30:50] actually brought that truth to us and I
[1:30:53] mean there's many truths I'm not going
[1:30:55] to try and get into all of them I'm not
[1:30:56] going to deny their there is a lot of
[1:30:58] truth but I'm just trying to make an
[1:31:00] illustration through this Vindicated
[1:31:01] prophet he gave us the ability to see
[1:31:04] our father the way that he wanted us to
[1:31:06] see him in our day again
[1:31:09] in Revelations 10 1 it was a rainbow
[1:31:13] that was around the head of the one who
[1:31:15] descended
[1:31:17] and put one foot on the land and one
[1:31:19] foot on the sea
[1:31:22] this is a Vindicated Prophet messenger
[1:31:24] who brought these truths to us who gave
[1:31:27] us the ability to see these things which
[1:31:29] gives us the ability to see the whole
[1:31:31] picture but again it comes back to us
[1:31:33] understanding that we have to have the
[1:31:35] right perspective
[1:31:37] we can't hold on to our former teachings
[1:31:39] we can't hold on to our our pride and
[1:31:42] say this is what I've known for years
[1:31:44] we've got to be willing to to to learn
[1:31:46] more
[1:31:50] and even when we get to the place where
[1:31:52] where we know that we know that we're
[1:31:54] saved God still wants to take us and
[1:31:57] grow us he wants to take us and polish
[1:32:00] us up
[1:32:01] because we are his victory we are the
[1:32:06] gems in his crown
[1:32:08] and until we actually go to the other
[1:32:10] side he's going to keep polishing us and
[1:32:13] keep working on us and keep chiseling
[1:32:16] away the rough edges on our lives every
[1:32:19] one of us has to go through that
[1:32:23] but what makes it easier in our lives is
[1:32:25] surrender
[1:32:26] when we can just surrender to the word
[1:32:28] then we don't have as much of a struggle
[1:32:32] we know that it's it's not easy
[1:32:35] our lives are definitely not easy it's
[1:32:37] not a cakewalk but we know that his word
[1:32:39] says that my yoke is easy and my burden
[1:32:41] is light
[1:32:42] and you know what I've heard it said and
[1:32:44] I probably said it before but somebody
[1:32:47] said somewhere along the way that we're
[1:32:48] going to fight our way to heaven or
[1:32:51] we're going to fight our way to Hell one
[1:32:53] of those two things is going to happen
[1:32:54] but we're going to fight our way in this
[1:32:55] life it's not going to be easy you know
[1:32:58] as a Christian
[1:33:00] especially as a Christian we are not
[1:33:02] living in a flowery bed of ease if we
[1:33:05] truly have the ability to see the full
[1:33:08] picture then Satan is going to do
[1:33:10] everything that he can I've said it
[1:33:13] before to throw banana peels in our path
[1:33:15] to trip us up to try and keep us from
[1:33:18] actually coming to the full realization
[1:33:20] it doesn't matter if we're on our faith
[1:33:23] if we're on our back if we're upside
[1:33:26] down if we're under water it doesn't
[1:33:28] matter he will not lose one of his own
[1:33:32] but Satan will take us and get us caught
[1:33:34] up in the situation in the carnal moment
[1:33:36] and take us and get us so distracted
[1:33:38] from the big picture that's actually
[1:33:40] happening in our lives
[1:33:42] that we'll just forget like that woman
[1:33:43] at the well will let a little bit of
[1:33:45] something get in the way of our lives
[1:33:47] and and we can forget what the whole
[1:33:50] picture really is
[1:33:51] brothers and sisters today we're dealing
[1:33:54] with the revelation of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:57] Christ in this world
[1:34:01] I think you know I've I've had it said
[1:34:03] to me uh
[1:34:05] in many different ways and I've tried to
[1:34:07] be able to articulate it and say it but
[1:34:09] I think that it's becoming clear and
[1:34:11] clearer to me myself
[1:34:14] and that what we've witnessed in our day
[1:34:16] and I say it many times the coming of
[1:34:18] the lord we know that's the third pull
[1:34:20] the opening of the word there's only one
[1:34:23] that had the ability to actually take
[1:34:25] the book out of the hand that him of him
[1:34:27] that sat on the throne and that was the
[1:34:30] lamb and that's the only one who had the
[1:34:32] ability to actually loose the seals
[1:34:34] thereof we know that so if we've had the
[1:34:37] seals opened in our day who opened those
[1:34:40] seals
[1:34:41] what we've witnessed in our day brothers
[1:34:43] and sisters is the spiritual coming of
[1:34:45] the Lord
[1:34:47] and we know that he will come again
[1:34:51] in his physical body
[1:34:53] but his physical body isn't going to
[1:34:55] walk on earth
[1:34:56] his physical body is going to meet us in
[1:34:59] the clouds
[1:35:01] and it's all part of the same thing
[1:35:04] it's just become super clear to me
[1:35:07] but to look at it and think that cloud
[1:35:10] in 1963
[1:35:12] the coming of the Lord
[1:35:15] sunset Mountain it wasn't just a cloud
[1:35:18] it wasn't just a sign
[1:35:21] it was actually the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:24] descending with a shout with an open
[1:35:27] book in his hand
[1:35:31] but here we have in our day the
[1:35:33] Vindicated Prophet messenger who
[1:35:35] surrendered his will to do the fathers
[1:35:38] completely
[1:35:40] he went through all kinds of things that
[1:35:42] we probably have no idea about
[1:35:45] just like many men who have
[1:35:47] packed the message
[1:35:49] through the years
[1:35:51] he bought the truth about those loose
[1:35:55] ends about the gospel
[1:35:57] and and what he did was he Shone a light
[1:36:00] on on the word
[1:36:02] allowing us to see what the father's
[1:36:04] will is for us in our day
[1:36:07] to give us the ability to see things
[1:36:09] that people desire to see throughout the
[1:36:12] ages that that prophets desired to look
[1:36:15] upon throughout the ages that even
[1:36:17] angels desired to see
[1:36:20] here we are today with the ability to
[1:36:23] just
[1:36:24] listen to it
[1:36:26] to speak it
[1:36:28] Paul said that he was caught up
[1:36:30] into a place
[1:36:32] where it wasn't even lawful to repeat
[1:36:34] the things that he heard said
[1:36:37] but brothers and sisters we've been
[1:36:39] brought up into a place also
[1:36:41] where it's lawful for us to say those
[1:36:44] things
[1:36:45] to speak the words
[1:36:47] that have been hidden throughout all of
[1:36:48] the ages it's no longer a mystery
[1:36:53] this Prophet came and he Shone a light
[1:36:56] the same light that John the Baptist
[1:36:59] used
[1:37:01] I say it that way because there was no
[1:37:03] flashlights in John the Baptist day
[1:37:06] but remember in the book of Saint John
[1:37:08] speaking about John the Baptist he spoke
[1:37:11] about a light that John the Baptist bore
[1:37:14] witness of but John the Baptist wasn't
[1:37:17] that light
[1:37:19] and in our day brother Branham wasn't
[1:37:22] that light but both of those Brothers
[1:37:24] bore witness of that light
[1:37:27] and we know that light that we speak
[1:37:28] about it's not a light as we see light
[1:37:31] as we we look at the Sun and we see
[1:37:33] light it's more than light it's actually
[1:37:37] life
[1:37:39] it's the life of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:43] but this this prophet in our day he
[1:37:45] Shone a light
[1:37:48] on the word
[1:37:49] allowing us to see the father's will
[1:37:52] I just find that statement that's a note
[1:37:55] that I wrote down I find that statement
[1:37:57] just astounding to even speak to think
[1:38:00] that we have been given the ability to
[1:38:03] understand what the father's will is for
[1:38:05] our day to understand what the father's
[1:38:07] will is in our lives and you know he
[1:38:09] said it back here in John labor not for
[1:38:12] the meat which perisheth but for that
[1:38:14] meat which endureth unto everlasting
[1:38:16] life which the son of man shall give
[1:38:18] unto you for him hath God the Father
[1:38:20] sealed then said they unto him what
[1:38:22] shall we do what's what might work what
[1:38:24] what
[1:38:26] excuse me then they said unto him what
[1:38:29] shall we do that we might do the works
[1:38:31] of God Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:38:34] this is the work of God
[1:38:37] that you believe on him whom he hath
[1:38:40] sent
[1:38:42] so if we take that and look at it there
[1:38:45] all they had to do was believe on him
[1:38:48] as the Christ the anointed one the
[1:38:50] Messiah for their day that's all they
[1:38:52] had to do there
[1:38:53] so today when we look at it the
[1:38:56] spiritual coming of the Lord what is our
[1:38:59] instruction for today brothers and
[1:39:00] sisters
[1:39:02] just believe on him
[1:39:05] this is the work of God that ye believe
[1:39:08] on him
[1:39:09] whom he hath sent
[1:39:13] who did he send in our day
[1:39:16] all we have to do is take the prophet's
[1:39:18] message and believe it
[1:39:21] but you know the devil he Creeps in
[1:39:24] to the framework of the Christian church
[1:39:27] and he causes it to be lukewarm formal
[1:39:30] and Powerless
[1:39:31] through the Creeds of man through the
[1:39:34] doctrines of men
[1:39:37] men get ideas
[1:39:39] and they surround themselves with them
[1:39:42] you know I just I just have to say
[1:39:44] thanks be to God for brothers who pack
[1:39:46] the truth
[1:39:48] who speak the truth this world is so
[1:39:51] full of people
[1:39:53] not speaking the truth
[1:39:56] and and I don't mean that around the
[1:39:57] message I'm certainly not saying that
[1:39:59] about the message I would that every
[1:40:01] single minister of the message would
[1:40:02] speak the truth that's not up to me to
[1:40:04] discern I'm not going to say that about
[1:40:06] any man it's up to God
[1:40:09] I know for sure that if you just give a
[1:40:12] man enough rope he will show exactly
[1:40:15] what's inside of him
[1:40:16] that's the way it works we can't
[1:40:19] actually put someone in or put someone
[1:40:20] out
[1:40:22] just encourage a brother
[1:40:23] show them love and see what happens I
[1:40:27] don't know what just happened there I
[1:40:28] apologize
[1:40:29] it's okay
[1:40:32] brother Branham was given the ability to
[1:40:34] shine a light on on the word allowing us
[1:40:36] to see what the father's will is
[1:40:39] and what was the theme song for the
[1:40:41] prophet in our day only believe
[1:40:44] just believe
[1:40:46] when you call on his name
[1:40:49] we sang that song Touching Jesus it's
[1:40:51] all that matters the rest of it it
[1:40:53] doesn't matter
[1:40:54] the whole entire world all the cares of
[1:40:56] this life it really doesn't matter the
[1:40:58] only thing that we have to do in our
[1:41:00] life is just touch Jesus and how do we
[1:41:02] do that it's just by believing when we
[1:41:05] call on his name
[1:41:07] but you know how can we actually get to
[1:41:09] that place in our lives
[1:41:11] the only way we can do it is through a
[1:41:14] Vindicated prophet in our day
[1:41:17] and many people would say that's that's
[1:41:19] not true I have my church I have my
[1:41:22] traditions I have my religion I've been
[1:41:24] baptized I've done everything all the
[1:41:27] way throughout my life and remember
[1:41:29] there was one that actually spoke to
[1:41:31] Jesus about that and Jesus he said he
[1:41:34] had a great conversation with them Jesus
[1:41:36] saw him run after him and he he marveled
[1:41:38] at him and and and he said Master I've
[1:41:42] done everything in my life what should I
[1:41:43] do that I would have eternal life and he
[1:41:46] said you know there's one thing that you
[1:41:47] lack you still have all this carnality
[1:41:50] around your life how about you just take
[1:41:52] it all and give it to the poor and take
[1:41:54] up your cross and follow me and you'll
[1:41:56] have exactly what you want and you know
[1:41:58] what he couldn't let go of all that
[1:42:00] carnality all of his father's tradition
[1:42:02] all of his daddy's business all of the
[1:42:05] life that he lives everything that he
[1:42:07] thought that he knew God told him right
[1:42:09] there in flesh just put it all aside
[1:42:12] forget about all of it and follow me
[1:42:14] and if you would have done that
[1:42:17] he would have been able to actually
[1:42:19] inherit eternal life but because he
[1:42:21] couldn't let go of that tradition
[1:42:23] because he couldn't let go of all of
[1:42:25] that carnality in his life the word says
[1:42:28] that he lifted up his eyes in hell
[1:42:32] and he saw the beggar Lazarus
[1:42:35] on on the other side of the chasm
[1:42:39] in in Abraham's bosom
[1:42:42] and it's interesting because the same
[1:42:44] carnality it's isn't it amazing how
[1:42:46] brother Branham Vindicated Prophet for
[1:42:48] our day he says you don't change
[1:42:49] anything when you go from here to there
[1:42:51] the only thing you do is change your
[1:42:52] body who you are here is who you are
[1:42:54] there if you look at that story he was
[1:42:57] exactly the same as he was here he had
[1:42:59] servants here and what did he do
[1:43:01] immediately he said to Abraham get him
[1:43:04] to go and get me some water because I'm
[1:43:05] in torment what
[1:43:08] immediately serve me
[1:43:11] thinking about himself carnality
[1:43:15] my
[1:43:18] all we have to do is believe brothers
[1:43:19] and sisters and here we have been given
[1:43:22] the ability to see what the father's
[1:43:25] will is its only believe
[1:43:28] only believe this is the work of God
[1:43:31] that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
[1:43:36] if we can believe
[1:43:39] in the message of the hour if we can
[1:43:41] believe that God could send a prophet
[1:43:42] and and take the word that that Prophet
[1:43:45] brought us and follow it
[1:43:48] we have the ability
[1:43:51] to see eternal life
[1:43:54] you know understanding trying to
[1:43:56] understand the first and then the second
[1:43:58] pulls
[1:43:59] and finally the third pull
[1:44:02] just to understand that every one of
[1:44:04] those polls they were not of men
[1:44:08] not one of them was about man
[1:44:11] but they're all leading towards
[1:44:12] something they were they were the bait
[1:44:14] on the hook is what the prophet said I
[1:44:16] think brother Bosworth actually said
[1:44:18] that to brother Branham it's just the
[1:44:20] bait on the hook it's the the healing
[1:44:22] campaign to get the attention of the
[1:44:24] people so that they could say well who
[1:44:26] else could do this sort of thing
[1:44:29] no man can heal
[1:44:32] has to be of God
[1:44:35] but it was so that one thing could
[1:44:37] happen
[1:44:38] so that they could see the opening of
[1:44:40] the word
[1:44:41] and you know when that happened
[1:44:43] when the opening of the word actually
[1:44:45] began to happen
[1:44:47] they rejected it
[1:44:48] it was no different than Jesus in his
[1:44:51] day
[1:44:52] we could go on and read here in in John
[1:44:54] chapter 6. I don't think we will for
[1:44:57] time's sake right now
[1:44:59] maybe we'll pick up tonight
[1:45:02] but exactly the same thing
[1:45:05] the discussion that he gets into with
[1:45:06] these people
[1:45:07] explaining to him that he's the bread of
[1:45:09] life and unless they come through him
[1:45:13] they will never see eternal life
[1:45:15] but they had a preconceived notion about
[1:45:18] the way things should be according to
[1:45:19] their tradition
[1:45:21] it's it's wonderful to say
[1:45:25] that we can actually look at the word
[1:45:26] and understand what the father's will is
[1:45:30] and his will
[1:45:32] is his word
[1:45:34] just to apply his word
[1:45:37] but to understand the first and the
[1:45:38] second and finally the third pulse in in
[1:45:41] in the prophet's message that they were
[1:45:43] not of a man it was so that we could see
[1:45:45] the opening of the word
[1:45:48] and to realize
[1:45:50] to be able to comprehend with All Saints
[1:45:53] what is the height and the depth
[1:45:55] and the breadth
[1:45:57] and the width of it to realize the
[1:46:00] second coming of the Lord
[1:46:02] is the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:46:04] this age
[1:46:06] it's the spiritual coming of the Lord
[1:46:08] Jesus Christ
[1:46:10] the unveiling of God the Mighty God
[1:46:13] unveiled
[1:46:15] if we were to listen to those messages
[1:46:17] brother Branham says it very clearly in
[1:46:19] there this is God Almighty unveiling
[1:46:22] himself
[1:46:24] how many people remembers when brother
[1:46:25] Ken brought this I hope this is okay
[1:46:27] sister Shelley we've talked about this
[1:46:29] and uh how many people remembers brother
[1:46:32] Ken he did this it's so vivid he brought
[1:46:35] this thing and he had it sitting here
[1:46:37] and he had it veiled he had a veil over
[1:46:39] it
[1:46:40] sort of like a description of the Mighty
[1:46:43] God unveiled and and it was it was
[1:46:45] covered and it was a mystery and nobody
[1:46:47] could understand what it was and he
[1:46:49] asked what do you think it is and what
[1:46:51] do you think it is and what do you think
[1:46:52] it is just a graphic description of the
[1:46:54] Mighty God unveiled and nobody knew
[1:46:59] but there came a time where the veil was
[1:47:01] lifted and brothers and sisters in our
[1:47:03] day through the message of a Vindicated
[1:47:06] Prophet The Mighty veil has the Mighty
[1:47:09] God has been unveiled the veil has been
[1:47:11] removed it's no longer a mystery
[1:47:16] to realize the second coming of the Lord
[1:47:18] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:47:21] to this age
[1:47:23] and that makes it really broad to think
[1:47:25] about it that that it's it's the
[1:47:26] revelation of Jesus Christ to this age
[1:47:28] there's a lot of people that would say
[1:47:29] that yes indeed that's that's exactly
[1:47:31] what it is that's the second coming of
[1:47:33] the Lord but you know it's not going to
[1:47:35] be
[1:47:36] a public show
[1:47:39] that's what the prophet said
[1:47:41] when he had the vision of the tent
[1:47:43] remember the vision of the tent and the
[1:47:45] angel of the Lord said it's not going to
[1:47:46] be a public show the people would go in
[1:47:48] they would go in crippled and and then
[1:47:50] they'd come out the other side of that
[1:47:51] tent healed it's not going to be a
[1:47:54] public show this is the revelation of
[1:47:56] the Lord Jesus Christ not just to this
[1:47:58] age but to a very specific group of
[1:48:00] people to those people who have been
[1:48:03] foreign before the foundation of the
[1:48:04] world to be able to receive the word
[1:48:06] those people who actually have like we
[1:48:09] said that see Gene of God forgive me for
[1:48:13] spitting that's the one thing about this
[1:48:15] that I'm not going to miss
[1:48:19] when we get excited and we're speaking
[1:48:21] then we don't actually get to see the
[1:48:22] spray but
[1:48:24] anyways Lord willing when the
[1:48:26] restrictions come down I think we will
[1:48:28] probably
[1:48:29] one of the first things we'll do is
[1:48:31] remove these
[1:48:32] but maybe we shouldn't actually for the
[1:48:34] amount of times I see myself spit I
[1:48:36] apologize
[1:48:37] if anybody ever experiences that
[1:48:40] we certainly want the news and not the
[1:48:42] weather
[1:48:45] but to realize the second coming of the
[1:48:47] Lord brothers and sisters
[1:48:49] is the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:48:51] this age
[1:48:53] but more so
[1:48:54] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:48:56] the individual
[1:48:58] that's what brother Bradham said that
[1:48:59] that's what the true New Birth is and
[1:49:02] that's really where we live
[1:49:04] it's one thing for everyone to say it's
[1:49:07] a great message of God it's it's great
[1:49:09] you could look up William Bradham on on
[1:49:11] Wikipedia or or whatever it is Google
[1:49:14] and and you would see that he was a
[1:49:16] mighty man of God and everyone would say
[1:49:17] bless God he he was a great man he had a
[1:49:20] mighty Healing Ministry and everything
[1:49:21] was good in his life except for that one
[1:49:23] thing where he sort of went off on the
[1:49:25] word you know and and that that that one
[1:49:28] thing where he went off on the word
[1:49:29] where the world would say that's what
[1:49:31] happened with him that is truly the
[1:49:33] opening of the word that's where things
[1:49:35] just start getting good in our lives
[1:49:37] because he was showing us that it wasn't
[1:49:39] just the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:49:41] this age anymore it was the revelation
[1:49:43] of Jesus Christ to the individual the
[1:49:46] ability to truly get baptized with the
[1:49:49] Holy Spirit on the sole level to realize
[1:49:53] the unveiling of God
[1:49:55] to realize the second coming of the Lord
[1:49:58] to realize that there is a true
[1:50:01] relationship between God and man again
[1:50:04] to realize that all that Adam had lost
[1:50:07] had now been restored back to
[1:50:10] the prophet
[1:50:12] no
[1:50:13] not to the prophet to man
[1:50:16] the son of man Ministry is to put the
[1:50:18] word of God as an open book back in the
[1:50:21] hand of men
[1:50:23] so that we could actually speak the word
[1:50:25] ourselves
[1:50:27] why cry speak
[1:50:30] know that he has it all under control
[1:50:32] know that everything that goes on in our
[1:50:34] lives all the carnal situations that we
[1:50:37] see
[1:50:38] he has it all under control
[1:50:41] and you know either he does or he
[1:50:43] doesn't
[1:50:44] it's not part way not sometimes he does
[1:50:46] sometimes he doesn't sometimes he's at
[1:50:49] work and everything is all under control
[1:50:50] and other times God just goes on
[1:50:52] vacation and things just get out of hand
[1:50:53] they just go crazy
[1:50:55] no
[1:50:56] he's always on the job
[1:50:59] always on the job and forgive me for
[1:51:01] making it sound so simple that way
[1:51:04] but he either is in control of
[1:51:06] everything or he isn't
[1:51:08] and that's where he's either God to the
[1:51:11] individual or he isn't
[1:51:14] because if we say that God isn't looking
[1:51:16] after us and and and the situation
[1:51:19] that's controlling our life right now is
[1:51:21] out of hand and God doesn't even know
[1:51:22] what's going on then we're actually
[1:51:24] potentially
[1:51:26] I would say this this is just my words I
[1:51:30] would say we're potentially slapping him
[1:51:31] in the face
[1:51:33] you know what I heard somebody coaching
[1:51:35] someone Once Upon a Time how to pray I
[1:51:38] may have told this story once but
[1:51:40] speaking about the face slapping
[1:51:44] someone had a new revelation
[1:51:47] a little bit of a new doctrine a little
[1:51:49] bit of a murmur
[1:51:51] we know that's the Antichrist Spirit as
[1:51:53] we studied when we looked at the seals
[1:51:56] it starts with just a discussion just a
[1:51:58] little murmur
[1:51:59] that's how the Antichrist works if you
[1:52:02] ever wonder about the Antichrist if you
[1:52:04] haven't studied it it starts with a
[1:52:06] murmur it starts with the discussion it
[1:52:08] starts with a little bit of a doctrine
[1:52:09] that actually Creeps in anyways this
[1:52:12] started to happen and and and a person
[1:52:14] was saying you know we just need to pray
[1:52:16] and open our minds and and just go into
[1:52:19] prayer and and pour out our hearts and
[1:52:21] in the end after we pour out all of our
[1:52:23] problems before God then we need to say
[1:52:25] to him don't you care
[1:52:28] can you imagine that
[1:52:30] saying that to almighty God who's been
[1:52:32] unveiled in our day
[1:52:34] but to say that
[1:52:36] it's got to be a slap in the face to our
[1:52:39] father
[1:52:40] because we're showing him that he
[1:52:42] doesn't know what's going on we're
[1:52:43] actually making him not God because if
[1:52:46] he's God he's omnipotent
[1:52:48] he knows everything
[1:52:51] there's nothing that he doesn't know
[1:52:54] he's everywhere
[1:52:57] but to be given the realization that the
[1:52:59] second coming of the Lord is the
[1:53:01] revelation of Jesus Christ to this age
[1:53:03] the seventh seal being open to us
[1:53:06] those people who have been given the
[1:53:09] ability to believe because there are
[1:53:10] people who have been given the ability
[1:53:12] to believe
[1:53:14] in Jesus day there was people who were
[1:53:16] given the ability to believe
[1:53:19] he went and chose them
[1:53:21] and it's interesting because as they
[1:53:23] went along there wasn't just the 12
[1:53:25] people who believed we know that there
[1:53:26] was 120 people in the upper room there
[1:53:29] was more people along the way that
[1:53:31] potentially believed Jesus when they
[1:53:33] heard about him
[1:53:34] and we know it because we heard about
[1:53:36] the the blind people who actually cried
[1:53:40] out
[1:53:40] thou son of David have mercy on us who
[1:53:44] were they
[1:53:45] they weren't the ones that Jesus went to
[1:53:47] and called out by name and said come
[1:53:48] pick up your cross and follow me leave
[1:53:50] your father your mother your job your
[1:53:52] income leave everything behind they were
[1:53:54] just Beggars blind on the side of the
[1:53:56] road but they had a revelation
[1:53:59] there was people who were called from
[1:54:01] before the foundation of the world just
[1:54:03] like today
[1:54:05] to realize
[1:54:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ to this
[1:54:09] age
[1:54:10] and that only happened through the
[1:54:12] opening of the seals
[1:54:14] without that it would be the same as
[1:54:16] just about any other doctrine that we've
[1:54:19] heard of
[1:54:20] knowing that there are some really good
[1:54:22] works that happened but if them seals
[1:54:25] weren't open as brother Branham says all
[1:54:28] of those seals weren't open
[1:54:30] we wouldn't have the Mighty God unveiled
[1:54:32] before our eyes
[1:54:35] we know it wasn't brother Branham that
[1:54:37] opened them seals
[1:54:40] we've said it before when John was there
[1:54:42] in heaven
[1:54:43] when he went through that open door in
[1:54:46] in Revelations chapter 4
[1:54:48] he realized that there was no man worthy
[1:54:51] to open the book
[1:54:53] but
[1:54:54] he began to weep he began to Weep For
[1:54:57] Joy because he realized there was one
[1:55:00] who was worthy to open the book when the
[1:55:03] Elder said to him weep not John for the
[1:55:06] lion of the tribe of Judah he hath
[1:55:09] prevailed and he alone is worthy to open
[1:55:12] the book
[1:55:16] in Matthew 13.
[1:55:20] Matthew chapter 13.
[1:55:22] verse 10 and the disciples came and said
[1:55:24] unto him
[1:55:26] why speakest unto them in parables
[1:55:29] why do you speak to the people in
[1:55:30] parables
[1:55:32] why did
[1:55:34] he take a man from Kentucky
[1:55:37] and raise him up
[1:55:39] to be the prophet for this day
[1:55:42] I can tell you why
[1:55:44] because the way Jesus is
[1:55:47] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:55:49] and forever
[1:55:51] he doesn't change his program
[1:55:53] he runs exactly the same way that he's
[1:55:56] always done it
[1:56:00] he created a parable for our day
[1:56:03] take a little
[1:56:05] what's been said a hillbilly from
[1:56:07] Kentucky
[1:56:08] uneducated
[1:56:10] not scholarly
[1:56:12] had to be scolded on how to say the word
[1:56:15] pulpit
[1:56:18] had to be corrected in many different
[1:56:20] ways
[1:56:21] so many different things that he went
[1:56:23] through
[1:56:24] but he used him so that it would be a
[1:56:26] parable
[1:56:27] so that it would confound the wise
[1:56:29] because there was only a certain group
[1:56:31] of people given the ability to
[1:56:33] understand
[1:56:35] in in verse 10 of Matthew Chapter 13 and
[1:56:40] the disciples came and said unto him why
[1:56:42] speaketh thou unto them in Parables why
[1:56:46] why are you speaking that way and he
[1:56:48] answered and said unto them because it
[1:56:50] is given unto you
[1:56:52] to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
[1:56:54] Heaven
[1:56:55] but to them it's not given
[1:56:58] it's no different today brothers and
[1:57:00] sisters than it was then
[1:57:02] exactly the same
[1:57:05] and I just think really in in and maybe
[1:57:09] forgive me if I sound like I just repeat
[1:57:11] this over and over again but isn't it
[1:57:14] just amazing when we can stand back and
[1:57:15] look at the whole picture and think out
[1:57:17] of the 7.8 billion people he chose us to
[1:57:21] be able to get this he gave us the
[1:57:24] ability to have eyes to see
[1:57:26] the message of the hour
[1:57:29] out of all the people in this world
[1:57:30] there's people that really desire to see
[1:57:32] this
[1:57:34] but they just don't like the way that
[1:57:36] it's wrapped they don't like
[1:57:38] the package that it came in they think
[1:57:40] that it should be scholarly
[1:57:42] they think that it should come a
[1:57:43] different way
[1:57:45] they think that it should have maybe a
[1:57:47] better education
[1:57:49] but brothers and sisters it's God's way
[1:57:51] he speaks to the world through parables
[1:57:55] he answered and said unto them because
[1:57:57] it's given unto you to know the
[1:57:59] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[1:58:01] to them it's not given
[1:58:03] for whosoever hath to him shall be given
[1:58:06] and he shall have more abundance but
[1:58:09] whosoever hath not from him shall be
[1:58:12] taken away even that he hath
[1:58:16] and you know we can look at this and
[1:58:18] apply it today brother Branham says that
[1:58:21] every scripture has a compound meaning
[1:58:22] and revelation we can take this
[1:58:25] scripture here and say that the people
[1:58:27] that have the people that have a
[1:58:30] curiosity sort of a a desire to see
[1:58:33] there's more to the gospel in our day
[1:58:35] God gives them the ability to see the
[1:58:37] message of the hour
[1:58:40] right
[1:58:41] how do we hear about the message of the
[1:58:43] hour
[1:58:44] something inside us is hungering and
[1:58:46] thirsting like the woman at the well but
[1:58:48] our life gets so clogged up with all of
[1:58:51] the stuff that we go through and then
[1:58:53] one day we meet someone that just speaks
[1:58:55] differently than everyone else that
[1:58:57] we've ever talked to in our entire lives
[1:58:59] all the people that we've ever met this
[1:59:02] one person says things in ways that we
[1:59:04] just never ever heard before and it just
[1:59:07] resounds with us something about it we
[1:59:09] just can't get away from whosoever hath
[1:59:12] to him shall be given those people that
[1:59:14] hath that desire to hear spirit and
[1:59:18] Truth to be able to hear hunger and
[1:59:20] thirst after righteousness have the
[1:59:23] desire to hear more for whosoever hath
[1:59:26] to him shall it be given but he shall
[1:59:29] have more abundance but whosoever hath
[1:59:31] not
[1:59:32] those people who are just spiritually
[1:59:34] dead they have no faith inside of them
[1:59:36] at all their parents never knew the
[1:59:39] scripture if they train them up in the
[1:59:40] way they should go
[1:59:42] that it won't depart from them
[1:59:44] they were raised maybe in a way that was
[1:59:47] completely carnal
[1:59:48] no spiritual maybe they were
[1:59:51] creasters
[1:59:53] they went to church at Chris Christmas
[1:59:54] and and at Easter and that was the only
[1:59:57] thing maybe they believed in a hybrid
[2:00:00] religion and we know brother Bradham
[2:00:02] says a hybrid religion can never
[2:00:04] reproduce the only thing a hybrid
[2:00:06] religion will do is actually just bring
[2:00:09] death
[2:00:10] there's no life to go forwards in that
[2:00:13] but those people that hath not whosoever
[2:00:15] hath not from him shall it be taken away
[2:00:18] even that he hath
[2:00:20] in the world that we live in today the
[2:00:22] parallel to that would be those people
[2:00:24] that maybe did have a tiny little bit of
[2:00:26] religion in their lives maybe from a
[2:00:28] friend or a grandma a great grandma that
[2:00:31] that believed in something
[2:00:33] but the parents bought into a hybrid
[2:00:36] religion and got completely away from it
[2:00:40] those children that were raised they
[2:00:43] don't have it they just don't have that
[2:00:44] desire there's nothing in them to really
[2:00:46] go to church or to hear the word or
[2:00:50] anything about it
[2:00:51] and the word says here those people it
[2:00:54] will be taken away from them
[2:00:56] the desire will go
[2:00:58] you know what's really hit me recently
[2:01:00] that there's no way that we can come
[2:01:02] actually against the word that we can
[2:01:04] act in our lives against the word for
[2:01:06] our day and think that it's going to be
[2:01:08] okay we can't take the message of the
[2:01:10] hour and interpret it and say that I'm
[2:01:13] going to add one word to it or I'm going
[2:01:15] to take one word away from it I'm going
[2:01:16] to do you know what I want to do brother
[2:01:18] Bradham said this and the church that I
[2:01:20] went to when I was growing up did that
[2:01:22] and and it really scarred me and so now
[2:01:24] I'm just going to take and apply the
[2:01:26] word that I think that will apply and
[2:01:28] raise my children under that you know
[2:01:29] what it becomes at that point if we're
[2:01:31] adding or taking away to it it is
[2:01:33] actually a hybrid religion and a hybrid
[2:01:36] can't reproduce
[2:01:38] so sadly if that happens our children
[2:01:41] are not being raised in the way that
[2:01:43] they need to be raised so that it won't
[2:01:44] depart from them
[2:01:47] it's frightening
[2:01:48] it's frightening to think about
[2:01:50] for whosoever hath to him shall be given
[2:01:52] and he shall have more abundance but
[2:01:55] whosoever hath not from him shall be
[2:01:57] taken away even that he hath
[2:02:00] Jesus speaking here he says therefore
[2:02:02] speak I to them in parables
[2:02:05] because seeing they see not
[2:02:09] so now he's actually going to the the
[2:02:11] the carnal side explaining a spiritual
[2:02:15] matter
[2:02:16] seeing they see not and hearing they
[2:02:18] hear not neither do they understand
[2:02:22] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[2:02:25] isaiahs which saith by hearing ye shall
[2:02:28] hear
[2:02:29] and shall not understand and seeing ye
[2:02:32] shall see and shall not perceive
[2:02:35] how many people in our lives do we come
[2:02:37] in contact with they just have no idea
[2:02:40] what we're talking about if we say that
[2:02:41] God sent a prophet they'll say Jesus
[2:02:44] check
[2:02:45] God check Church check worship check
[2:02:50] profit ooh
[2:02:54] ooh
[2:02:55] that's going a little too far
[2:02:58] somewhere along the way there's
[2:03:00] something that got in there to that
[2:03:01] teaching it's a little bit of a hybrid
[2:03:03] and when that happens it can't bring
[2:03:05] life
[2:03:08] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[2:03:11] Isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall
[2:03:13] hear and shall not understand and seeing
[2:03:15] you shall see and shall not perceive
[2:03:19] a prophecy
[2:03:21] speaking about a people
[2:03:24] for this people's heart is wax gross
[2:03:27] we live in a nation in a world of people
[2:03:31] whose Hearts have waxed gross
[2:03:35] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[2:03:38] their eyes
[2:03:39] you know it doesn't say their eyes are
[2:03:41] blind it says their eyes they have
[2:03:43] closed
[2:03:46] they've decided to just close their eyes
[2:03:47] to it I just don't even want to look at
[2:03:49] it
[2:03:50] I just want to look at something else
[2:03:55] people can't live their lives with their
[2:03:57] eyes closed so this to me says that he's
[2:03:59] speaking spiritually it's a very
[2:04:01] spiritual discussion using a carnal
[2:04:04] comparison
[2:04:07] for their eyes they have closed lest at
[2:04:10] any time they should see with their eyes
[2:04:12] and here with their ears and should
[2:04:15] understand with their heart and should
[2:04:17] be converted
[2:04:18] and I should heal them
[2:04:21] can you imagine that people would want
[2:04:23] to actually avoid that
[2:04:26] but people don't realize it
[2:04:28] they're under the influence of another
[2:04:30] spirit
[2:04:31] that's why it's so
[2:04:34] it's just becoming clear and clearer to
[2:04:36] me brothers and sisters the whole
[2:04:38] thought of this that if we reject the
[2:04:41] Holy Spirit In Our Lives if we reject
[2:04:43] the opportunity that we've been given to
[2:04:46] get the Holy Spirit In Our Lives then we
[2:04:49] accept the mark of the beast
[2:04:52] and you know when we look at it Jesus
[2:04:54] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:04:56] forever to think that there's a
[2:04:57] spiritual coming of Jesus Christ where
[2:04:59] he comes down with an open book in his
[2:05:01] hand puts one foot on the land one foot
[2:05:03] on the sea and actually declares that
[2:05:05] there should be time no more and
[2:05:06] actually opens the book opens the seals
[2:05:10] through his prophet in our day a
[2:05:12] spiritual coming of Christ you know what
[2:05:14] there is a spiritual sealing of Christ
[2:05:15] as well
[2:05:17] and that's receiving the Holy Ghost in
[2:05:19] our lives but there's also a spiritual
[2:05:22] ceiling
[2:05:23] of the Beast
[2:05:25] which is the exact opposite of that
[2:05:27] isn't there if we fail to get the mark
[2:05:30] the Seal of God in our lives the Holy
[2:05:33] Ghost the token
[2:05:35] the blood sacrifice if we fail to accept
[2:05:38] that in our lives then we accept
[2:05:41] the mark of the beast to reject the Holy
[2:05:44] Ghost is to accept the mark of the beast
[2:05:46] and you know
[2:05:48] there's going to be a physical mark
[2:05:51] of the Beast
[2:05:52] but fortunately the bride won't be here
[2:05:54] for that
[2:05:55] she'll be gone she'll be long in glory
[2:05:58] by that time
[2:06:00] where people can't buy or sell
[2:06:03] but it's interesting just to have the
[2:06:05] discussion to think about the spiritual
[2:06:07] connotation that's where we live today
[2:06:09] brothers and sisters we got free moral
[2:06:11] free morals we can do whatever we want
[2:06:13] to do
[2:06:14] you know the true bride she only wants
[2:06:16] to serve her husband she only wants to
[2:06:19] be with the one who actually gave her
[2:06:21] the ability to have eternal life she
[2:06:23] wants to minister to her husband
[2:06:28] but to reject the Holy Ghost in our day
[2:06:30] is to accept the mark of the beast
[2:06:33] it's amazing to look at it but he goes
[2:06:36] on to say
[2:06:38] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[2:06:41] and your ears for they hear
[2:06:45] and I I just believe we could stop right
[2:06:48] there and say that blessed are your eyes
[2:06:50] for they see the things of God
[2:06:53] that song
[2:06:55] the things that were brought
[2:06:57] by the prophet in our day oh my
[2:07:02] blessed are your eyes for they see in
[2:07:04] your ears for they hear for verily I say
[2:07:06] unto you that many prophets and
[2:07:08] righteous men have desired to see
[2:07:11] those things which ye see and have not
[2:07:15] seen them
[2:07:16] they've desired to see them
[2:07:19] but they haven't seen them they haven't
[2:07:21] been given the ability to see them
[2:07:23] because it wasn't for them
[2:07:25] it was for a very specific group of
[2:07:27] people
[2:07:29] you know knowing the scriptures have the
[2:07:31] compound meanings
[2:07:33] and Revelations to look at this whole
[2:07:35] scripture that we're reading here out of
[2:07:38] Matthew and to think about it he's
[2:07:40] talking about us right here we can put
[2:07:43] ourselves right there in that scripture
[2:07:46] many prophets and righteous men have
[2:07:48] desired to see the things which ye see
[2:07:52] and they haven't seen them
[2:07:54] and to hear those things which ye hear
[2:07:56] and have
[2:07:58] heard them
[2:08:00] how wonderful it is brothers and sisters
[2:08:02] to realize that this is the work of God
[2:08:06] and that if ye believe on him
[2:08:09] whom he hath sent
[2:08:11] out of your belly shall flow rivers of
[2:08:14] Living Water
[2:08:17] we're not here to labor for the meat
[2:08:19] which perisheth
[2:08:20] we're here to labor for the kingdom of
[2:08:22] God we're here to labor so that we can
[2:08:25] actually feed our souls
[2:08:28] we're going to probably talk about it a
[2:08:30] bit more tonight talking about the bread
[2:08:32] of God is he which cometh down from
[2:08:34] heaven and giveth life unto the world
[2:08:37] that light that John the Baptist spoke
[2:08:40] about that light that brother Bradham
[2:08:42] spoke about
[2:08:46] blessed are your eyes for they see and
[2:08:49] your ears for they hear
[2:08:52] you know what I'm just going to wrap up
[2:08:54] a little early this morning
[2:08:55] because we're going to have service
[2:08:57] tonight
[2:08:59] um maybe I'll just call the musicians
[2:09:04] what a tremendous thing it is to think
[2:09:06] that he has chosen a very specific way
[2:09:10] to express himself
[2:09:12] and the way that he's chosen to express
[2:09:14] himself brothers and sisters isn't
[2:09:16] through Ministry even though he does
[2:09:19] it isn't through musician even though he
[2:09:22] does
[2:09:23] he's chosen to express himself
[2:09:25] through the bride
[2:09:28] you know that that thought
[2:09:31] that
[2:09:32] Jesus doesn't come
[2:09:34] onto this Earth again until Revelations
[2:09:36] 19.
[2:09:38] only those people who actually have the
[2:09:41] ability to see this word to understand
[2:09:43] the spiritual
[2:09:46] connotation the spiritual reflection of
[2:09:49] what's being said in the carnal as we
[2:09:51] read the scripture here only those
[2:09:53] people are the ones that will actually
[2:09:54] meet with him in the clouds
[2:09:56] because he's not coming to Earth until
[2:09:58] Revelations 19 and at that time he comes
[2:10:01] with the whole bride
[2:10:02] and and it's going to be a totally
[2:10:04] amazing time when that happens
[2:10:08] but just to think
[2:10:10] that we have been given the ability to
[2:10:12] see that in our day
[2:10:14] to see that he's only called a very
[2:10:17] select few people
[2:10:19] and those people that have the ability
[2:10:21] to see that we've got reason to Rejoice
[2:10:23] brothers and sisters
[2:10:24] I know that the prophet has said it that
[2:10:27] we should be the happiest people on
[2:10:28] earth
[2:10:29] and I'm one I'd be the first one to say
[2:10:31] there's times where I have to ask the
[2:10:33] Lord to forgive me because I get caught
[2:10:35] up in the moment
[2:10:36] and and my problem seems to be greater
[2:10:39] than the promise
[2:10:41] but that's just the way the devil likes
[2:10:43] it
[2:10:44] for me to focus on my life to see that
[2:10:46] the the the problem is greater than the
[2:10:49] promise when it's actually a lie the
[2:10:51] promise is greater than any problem I
[2:10:53] could ever encounter on this side of
[2:10:55] Eternity
[2:10:56] there's nothing that's too great for the
[2:10:59] Lord there's no no nothing that's too
[2:11:01] far for him to reach his arms are not
[2:11:04] too short
[2:11:06] but just to have the understanding that
[2:11:07] blessed are our eyes for they see these
[2:11:10] things and our ears for they can hear
[2:11:12] these things
[2:11:16] How Great Is Our God maybe stand with me
[2:11:18] this morning
[2:11:24] for verily I say unto you that many
[2:11:26] prophets and righteous men have desired
[2:11:28] to see these things which ye see and
[2:11:30] have not seen them and to hear these
[2:11:32] things which ye hear and have not heard
[2:11:34] them
[2:11:36] [Music]
[2:11:38] it's absolutely wonderful to think that
[2:11:40] we can say that we're one of them
[2:11:43] let's just bow in prayer
[2:11:45] gracious Lord Jesus
[2:11:47] we're so thankful for your word
[2:11:49] so thankful Lord Jesus that

[2:12:54] into our hearts Lord Jesus and that it
[2:12:57] could actually fertilize that egg inside
[2:13:00] our heart Lord Jesus and that that thing
[2:13:02] that would start to come to life inside
[2:13:05] of us would be called the Lord Jesus
