it's kind of a you I don't know it's just my story but I love the picture in my mind of the the hands of the Lord Jesus grabbing grabbing your hands if you think you got a tough time when he grabs it that nail scar is right there so for me that just paints a visual paints a picture that Lord my trials aren't too tough when I see your hand you reach out to me those precious hands those Nails held them what is the song says it was love that held him there we thank the Lord for those precious hands it led us all through life God bless you stand with me if you would turn your eyes on Jesus where

recharge certainly thankful for the ability to gather together this way pray the Lord will just bless us tonight once again [Music] welcome brother Michael so good to see you good to have you here certainly enjoyed this special tonight 's voice if you have a need tonight maybe just make it known unto the Lord with an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer just have a few requests we want to remember Frank I want to keep him before the Lord sister Michelle Livesey has a pulled back they're back home but they're just not feeling well so they're at home and I just want to continue to remember brother Isaiah and brother Koshi and his family if you have a need just make it known unto him as we go gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we're so thankful that we have the ability Lord to look away to Jesus [Music] rather that we could look upon you Lord Jesus and we know that in the world that we live in there's so many different ideas and so many different flavors of how that could be how we could look upon you father but we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever and you'd change not Lord and that's one of the greatest tricks of the devil is to try and get us to believe that you change but we know that heavens and earth will pass away but your word will remain so father we thank you for sending us a prophet thank you for speaking to us through him thank you for giving us ears to hear and hearts to receive the word for our day Lord tonight we just want to remember each hand that was made known unto you father each need behind the hand that was lifted to you father tonight we just ask that you would meet the need father behind the request Lord we want to continue to remember Isaiah before your throne Lord Jesus father we know that we have a story in your your Bible about how the disciples tried to cast out that devil and and they couldn't do it and they came to you the father came to you distraught and asked why could they not and we know that you said it was because of their unbelief but there was a way father we just pray that you would touch that boy in the name of Jesus that you would bring healing to the family Lord that you would bring rest Lord father we thank you for your goodness we just want to remember brother Frank Cronkite Lord before your throne we thank you for your leadership we thank you for your guidance your direction and most of all your healing touch Lord we know our bodies need healing but more than anything our souls do father and we thank you for touching our brother Lord we pray that you would just raise him up father in the name of Jesus whether we want to also remember sister Michelle he's got a sore back lord and we know that can be super painful and we just pray that you would take away the pain in the name of Jesus that you would restore her health back lord in the name of Jesus we pray that you would be with all those who are traveling Lord that you would keep your hand upon them that you would bring them back home safely at the appointed time and now father we just ask that you would bless our service with your presence we know we've already invited you and we know that we're two or three are gathered together in your name according to your word that you're there and tonight father we just welcome you father we greet you father we want to wash your feet Lord and appreciate you Lord Jesus we want to greet you with a kiss Lord and we want to anoint you Lord Jesus we want you to feel welcome here in our midst Lord we don't want to just invite you Lord and seat you in a corner and just ignore you father we pray that Lord we would just have that Dynamic relationship of intimacy with you tonight father that you would speak to us Lord and father we'll be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory we just ask that you would bless our service now in a supernatural way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight thank you musicians you have your Bibles I would like to go back to the book of Ephesians and I would like to talk about our positions a little further tonight book of Ephesians chapter 5. sorry I didn't say that Ephesians chapter 5. and I just I keep going a little bit further and further backwards but the word just keeps speaking to me and so if we could start reading from verse 20 in Ephesians chapter 5. I think that'd be good it says giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I believe we could just stop right there and say Amen it's just a beautiful thing to just be able to give thanks for all things verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband chapter 6. children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the Earth and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord we thank you for the Revelation behind it thank you for your goodness to us Lord and that we can rejoice in all things father because we know that you have ordained us to be here this day father to hear this word Lord Jesus to be the living witness of your life here on Earth and father we pray that one more time you would just break this bread of life open to us fresh father that you would just reveal it to us Lord we can try and talk about it all we want and we can walk around in circles and point at it and poke at it but father unless you reveal it Lord we're just going to have a study but when you come father we know that changes everything so we just invite you Lord Jesus to take the full preeminence that you desire tonight in your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated if I had to title it tonight I talk about our positions a lot we've talked about husbands we've talked about wives we've talked about children and I think we will do all of that tonight but I want to talk about this mystery that Paul is talking about here to the Ephesian church this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church and how important it is to recognize our position in him so if I had to title it tonight I want to title it one flesh the ending of verse 31 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh I think it's amazing when you look at that we know that traditionally according to uh I would say even a Christian marriage the wife takes the name of the husband and it's not the other way around the husband does not take the name of the wife but we know that the way the times have changed and and traditions have evolved the devil has eroded the way things had been done for so many years that it's it's changed and now you can keep both names and you can hyphenate the names and sometimes the husband will just take the wife's name but it's for a strange purpose because the way it was ordained from the beginning it was simple it was that the wife took the husband's name and that is the way it works with the word of God I think it's such a beautiful thing because none of this is in my notes this whole name thing but isn't it wonderful that we take his name we take the name of Jesus Christ and if we take any other name then we're missing the point we're missing all of this mystery we're missing the revelation and I just think it's a beautiful thing you know um I just was thinking about it tonight and and I just wanted to mention something I got a quote that came to mind before I even get into that I get excited I'm sorry it's wonderful I love the word um we have announcement um we have brother Dale Smith I spoke to him today he sends a big greetings to the church and he's coming to Canada in June and uh so he'll be coming by Calgary uh on the seventh he's going to take the service it'll be a Wednesday night then he's going to travel up to Edmonton and do a little fishing and a little bit of church up there and then he will be traveling back home again so we had such a tremendous conversation this morning he just wanted to send his greetings and let you know he thinks about us and prays for us and it's certainly wonderful to have a friend that remembers us but you know talking about prayer just getting into uh sort of a for free thought tonight when we talk about prayer I just wanted to encourage us brothers and sisters we're not living in a situation where um we should expect to see miraculous great signs and wonders we talk about this a fair bit but you know we prayed for Isaiah the other night there and uh the boy with severe autism so much so that his parents don't sleep at night and and and they're afraid to come to church because he will disrupt service so they haven't come to church anywhere for a long time and you know it's kind of troubled me a little bit in terms of we pray for him and he goes away the same and keeping in touch with uh brother koshy find out that not much has changed in the house in fact it's gotten a little worse and and I said to him you know I don't want to celebrate that but I do want to remind you that that's actually a sign that something's changing we don't want to actually give up and say that nothing has happened because we've had prayer that nothing has happened but the Branham talks about it and we know in the Bible full well that Daniel Prayed for help Daniel Prayed For assistance and we know the angel of the Lord came his way but he had to fight through the Prince of Persia and it was 21 days of waiting before he heard an answer to his prayer we don't necessarily see miraculous in our day sometimes we do and sometimes we don't but we know one thing is for sure God always hears our prayers I just want to read a quote about this sometimes brother random says it sometimes God is spontaneous and sometimes he's not sometimes it just happens and sometimes it just doesn't and I personally have seen both and I'm sure we all have in our lives but he says this and and one morning after I guess five weeks or more four or five weeks I forget just what she said telling the story about two sisters that God prayed for but nothing happened in their lives nothing changed he says I forget what she said she was washing the dishes one morning the children had gone to school and all of a sudden she had a real strange feeling strike her this is a sister that couldn't eat she could not eat food she was withering away she was starving to death literally but she had a real strange feeling striker one morning it was just in the normal course of life a real strange feeling struck her she thought what is this she felt real blessed so then she thought well maybe it's just the Lord blessing me just dovetails with our scripture you know we can have joy we can just rejoice in all things for What the Lord Has Done For Us right she was a very fine Christian woman young woman in about her 30s and she got real hungry and she said oh how I would like to be able to eat just a little piece of toast can you imagine that not even being able to eat a little piece of toast just like to eat a little piece of toast and she sat down and eat the toast just in a few moments it come up would have done it but that time it stayed down felt good well she thought you know if that's so I believe I'll just eat some of these oats here that some of the children left in their plate so she sets down and eats the oats now you know what oatmeal would do on an acid stomach and she weighed about 15 or 20 minutes and it never bothered her so she sat down and had her a real gastronomical Jubilee she fried her some eggs got her a cup of coffee and just really enjoyed it and she waited about 20 or 30 minutes and usually in five minutes she done threw it up and she felt so good she said you know I just can't keep this good thing to myself so I went down the street and she went to a neighbor that had been praying for the same night who had been prayed for the same night who had a growth on the side of her neck well her husband was retired they'd gotten up late and when she got to such a house a few doors below her she thought they had the Salvation Army in there she never heard so much shouting and going on in all her life she thought well what's wrong she runs in and says Lydia what's the matter she said oh Bertha I want to tell you I just got up I was laying here I'd been awake for a little while I felt real strange feeling and we shook even the bed sheets on the bed we can't find that lump it's gone well she told her her story and they just got all enthused and got themselves somebody in the neighborhood and come into one of my meetings which was about a thousand miles away and they gave their testimony but the Branham says now what happened the angel of God who had pronounced that blessing had passed through the neighborhood confirming it many people would say well wasn't that angel of the Lord William Branham no he was just standing there when he came right isn't that the truth brothers and sisters and when tonight we're talking about one flesh this is the life we're living this is the reality of Who We Are when we pray for someone it's not even us praying brothers and sisters and if it is us praying then we've missed the mark because it's got to be his Spirit living out through us he says now what happened the angel of God who had pronounced that blessing had passed through the neighborhood confirming it you see what if they would have give up don't give up you believe stay with it God will bring it to pass sometimes God isn't spontaneously on things how many knows that Daniel Prayed and it taken I believe it was 28 days the angel said for he could get to him is that right 21 days that's right thank you sir 21 days before he could get there but he heard him and every time that you move towards god with faith God knows it see just don't worry be real full of faith and just keep believing brothers and sisters tonight I just want to encourage us don't give up on any one of our prayers just keep believing and you know if our faith starts to fail I want to say this that's a good thing because our faith has to fail we have to find the end of our faith because our faith won't get us out of here we know that in our age we need more faith than any other age we need rapturing faith brother Branham said that's the only way we're going to get there and that kind of Faith brothers and sisters it's not something we're going to drum up we're not going to have a worship service and just work it out of us that's what the Pentecostals are trying to do the only thing that's going to do and I'm so thankful I heard brother Paul say it it's his word that's the only thing that's going to do it we talked about it on Sunday it's the word to the word it's that spoken word from the angel to that genetic see Gene word of God down on the inside of the inside of the believer that when they hear it they just can't handle it it changes them from the inside out so I just wanted to encourage us don't don't worry Don't Be Afraid don't get impatient just keep believing and confessing we know that we had that that story that John Ryan I just can't get it out of my mind because I can relate to the guy once upon a time I was a blind shoe cobbler literally but you know I was never blind sorry figuratively but I was a shoe cobbler but I was blind to the word of God I had no idea who I was living in the world living in sin completely out in the world but you know one time I heard the truth and we know that this guy he heard the truth as well he was blind physically and he couldn't see and he went up and got prayed for by the prophet where all the healings were happening and he walked away from the from the platform and he was still blind and then he came back in the prayer line and we had know the conversation really well I keep talking about it but I think it's important to remind us stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance this is something that happened in our generation he came back and said to William Mary and Branham hey I I I'm not I'm not I can't see I'm still blind but I think it's beautiful when we look at this because it wasn't William Bradham that pronounced that healing on those two sisters was it it was the angel of the Lord so who was it that he was speaking to in that moment when he said I thought you said I was healed that voice said to him I thought you said you believed we have to have unwavering Faith brothers and sisters and you know when when when it gets to be shaky that's when we get strong because his strength is made perfect in our weakness that's where we see his strength and when we get to our weakest moments of Faith where we don't know we just don't know because we've never experienced it before just take that step and he'll have that stare for our foot to land on he will make sure that it happens for us I just want to encourage us don't give up don't don't doubt don't don't think that it's not going to happen it has to happen that word was pronounced we prayed God heard our prayers are you happy tonight today I want to talk about our position and our position is that we will be one flesh with him I am my father are one we have to be and and that's the beautiful part it's not optional that's where I want to get to with that tonight is not that we're going to uh potentially have a partial relation it's going to be the full deal it has to be the full deal it has to be Christ in us and and there's a few interesting quotes that I found but you know we we've talked about our position and uh understanding that we we have been given very specific directions in the word of God how to be a husband and we've had it magnified Amplified broken down in many different ways by the prophet of God how to be a wife how to be children how to be brothers and sisters Elders in the church spiritual offices all of these things have been talked about in the word of God and then magnified Amplified explained by the prophet in our day so we really don't have any questions about we shouldn't have any questions about the way things are and if we do have a question about the Bible there is a Bible answer that's the one thing that brother Branham brought out real clear for us if there is a Biblical question if there is a spiritual question there is a Biblical or spiritual answer for us we don't have to wander around we don't have to bumble around in darkness now because all of the Loose Ends have been tied up in our day but you know in order for us to be able to to live our lives like this in order for us to find our position as a husband as a wife as a child specifically in the family unit the only way we're going to be able to take these words out of Ephesians and and and I believe it's Colossians and out of First Peter and all of the word in the Bible that pertains to Family Positions the only way it's going to happen is that for it to be a revelation to us there comes a point in time where we have to say as we just said a minute or ago it's no longer our faith it's it's God's faith living out through us it has to be our position is a revelation and and it might sound funny to some but it's true the battle says when when the Great Ransom body through all the ages comes up then that's going to be a great Throne there Revelation 7 express it great number which no man could number through all the ages has come up them that's walked in the light of the Bible as far as it was revealed to them and and now we know that Wesley had more light than Luther did and we know Pentecost outshine Wesley see certainly does now where do we stand brothers and sisters if we've had all the loose ends tied up for us if we've had all the Mysteries revealed if if this mystery is history now that this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church how much responsibility is on us how much light do we have I think it's beautiful it's amazing when we think about it because it's not something that we're going to be able to just study and learn it's got to be a revelation when we get that Revelation I just personally believe this when we get that Revelation about all of the mystery being history and that we know who we are and what we're raised up for is the original life living out through us that we can actually recognize this brothers and sisters there's no shame in jumping up and down there's no shame in shouting or running around the building when you recognize that you're redeemed that you're going to be one of the ones that are one of the few that stand in heaven and say you know what I know that my redeemer lives because I live also and all of Heaven is going to be quiet to listen to you worship there but you don't have to actually wait till you're there to show your worship to show your appreciation personally I believe when we get that real Revelation down in our hearts it's going to change the way we behave church is not going to be something that we just labor into church is going to be something we desire to do David said I was glad sad when I said let's go to the house of the Lord something inside him leapt because he knew he was going to worship God and that's the only way that we're going to be able to have one flesh and I can see this is going to patch over into it I really am studying worship and I want to get right into studying worship and and really drill down on it brothers and sisters and just try and encourage us to step out of our shells don't worry about what other people are thinking and don't worry about traditions and and the way things have been in the past because we're going over Jordan we're going into the promised land and nobody has ever gone there before no one in the Gentile church has ever taken all of these unraveled Mysteries that have been tied up in in the age that we live in and gone where we're going no one has ever done it it's a personal Affair so don't worry about getting out of order brother Branham says it I didn't bring the quote tonight but I'll bring it on Sunday brother Branham says I I think it'd be a good thing if we would just get out of order once in a while so that we could actually just let the spirit of God move but many times he wants to move and we're just too reserved we don't want to move we don't want to change what would someone think about us if we got up and and shouted I I know there's people that when when the spirit of God strikes they just can't contain themselves maybe it sounds like brother Barry's just trying to trump it up into a Pentecostal slant but if you think about it if if if one of those Church ages outshine the other one and and the other one outshine the other one and here we are with all of the Mysteries being made known to us what does it do to us when we actually get in the presence of the Lord brothers and sisters we've said it before and I just think it's amazing when you look at a hockey game how people will jump up out of their seats and jump up and down he's getting he's on a breakaway he's going in and he's going to score a goal oh he didn't score a goal and they'll sit back down again and then it will go back down to the other end and then it'll start winding up and then suddenly it'll be he's scarred and then everybody jumps up and they make so much noise over a stupid piece of rubber on ice while they're drinking listening to Metallica but the Church of the Living God can get together and worship in spirit and in truth I think it's so beautiful because I'm going to get some of those diagrams that Brothers brought you know what we have the body and we have the spirit and we have the soul we're going when you're worshiping in spirit and in truth you're actually on the inside of that outside realm oh you're not worshiping brothers and sisters now we might have a discussion afterwards but you know what it's got to be that way we've got to Worship in spirit or truth and if we're not worshiping that way we're not truly worshiping God you know brother Branham says it that millions and billions of people will be worshiping but they're going to be worshiping Satan and not even knowing it and knoweth it not they don't understand I just think it's an amazing thing though to realize the magnitude of what we have what we know and not to say who we are because it's not something we want to say I'm somebody because I've got no we're nobody we recognize how little we really are by the more revelation we get the more revelation we get the smaller we become because we recognize there's nothing we could do to Merit his grace wow brother random says because it just gradually let loose as it did down through the prophets and so forth till it was perfectly made known the godhead bodily in Christ and now Christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of God to take Eve back to her right position again with her husband I just love this this is right where we're living brothers and sisters because we know Eve isn't on Earth right he she's not here on Earth and he didn't come down in the garden and take her back so so what's he saying here he's saying there's going to be a physical manifestation of the spirit of God where he's taking his bride back to his side and now Christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing is a revelation of God to take Eve back to her right position again with her husband notice and God is the husband of the church and the church is his bride this is Christ The Mystery of God revealed 1963. I just was thinking while I was thinking and uh you know sometimes it's good to have just a little comparison sometimes a little bit of a type or an explanation and you know sometimes when you have a job an employer can actually give you your job description and and you can have your job description and you can read it you can be trained in a field and and you can have the job that matches what you're supposed to do and and you can read their job description every job description is going to be just a little bit different because of the way every single company operates but there's going to be certain things inside that job description that matches what you're trained to do most of the time but when an employer explains a job to the employee it's simply text it's an explanation and and the employee can do the job to the best of their ability according to what is is written in the job description and what was explained to them and the first little while when you start the job and you work at it you you work according to what was described to you and maybe what the what the requirements are for that position but then after a little bit of time goes by you start to actually see how you need to do things a little bit here and a little bit here and a little bit here that don't actually they're not written in the job description fill in the blanks is kind of what I was thinking as I was talking about it and we've had discussions about it before there's certain gray areas sometimes in companies and small companies tend to have more gray areas than larger companies where there's more people to do the work but you wind up actually getting what I was thinking today is a bit of a revelation about your position in the company and when you get that Revelation in your position you can actually become happy in your position because you know the things that need to be done according to the job description and you know what other things need to be done to help you do that that aren't written in the job description and you just go about it because you have that Revelation about how to make it happen how to make it flow and usually when you get that Revelation about your position you can make it easier on other people other people's lives become easier and what happens is the employer can say wow look at this person look at what they're doing and then the employer will say you know what I don't think I pay you enough because I know you're doing more than what I've asked you to do but imagine how you can take that analogy that comparison brothers and sisters and put it into the family unit as a husband as a wife as a child the word of God gives us just a baseline of what we should do and and if that's how we live our lives and our families as just the Baseline that's all I do because that's what the word of God says then maybe we're letting things slip through the cracks maybe we're not making it a an easy time for the other people in the company so to speak but imagine if we just did a little bit more if we just look for those gray areas in our family and thought you know what I'm meeting the requirements according to the word but I know it's going to make my wife just that much happier if I just do a little bit more I know that she's supposed to look after the house and keep the family and and do all of that but what if I just did a little bit more secretly without even telling her or what if the wife did something for the husband and what if the children did something for the parents what if the brother did something for the sister we know the word of God says not to let the right hand know the left hand's doing sometimes we have the ability to actually go beyond just the mechanical and just keeping it mechanical mechanical mechanical mechanical when the Dynamics set in I believe we have the opportunity to make something really happen something really change and you know I just was thinking about it today if we could actually get that Dynamics and not just say let's have the Dynamics in church every time we come to service let's get the mechanics and the Dynamics together what about getting the mechanics and the Dynamics together in our positions and our families as a husband as a wife as the children to think about it as parents you know maybe I don't need to spend that much time away maybe I could actually just take another minute or two with the children you know as a child I think back in my life there's times where someone um I had an aunt I'll give you an actual example I had an aunt and and she had a boyfriend and he had this little car it was an MJB and it was a convertible it was a two-seater car and and that guy his name was rich and he came and he picked me up from school he picked me up at lunch time took me to McDonald's and then took me back to school and for him it was probably just like yeah whatever this little kid my you know his girlfriend's nephew and uh you know it was just one time one hour but you know that one time that one hour here I am 45 years later still talking about it it's amazing what we can do with just a tiny little bit of effort is what I'm trying to get at brothers and sisters I'm not saying we don't I just was these are just thoughts while I was thinking that's all things just come to me and I was just just contemplating it how incredible it can be if we just go beyond looking at it as just black and white text and this is our job description and this is the way we do it if we can actually just go a little bit further and try a little harder maybe do a little more we might see a little bit of a difference and that spills right over into church right over into church services that spills right over into our jobs right into our jobs I was talking to someone on the weekend who works for the City of Calgary and they're talking about being in the union and and and how there's so much wastage and and you went on and on and on I don't need to bore you with the details but I just I just thought how people work to rule and and and and just to the letter of of what's written there in the job description and they do no more nothing more and and it's kind of sad because it winds up being a financial waste but what about the time that we have on Earth it doesn't compare money can never compare to the time that we have with our family with our wives with our children we don't know what tomorrow holds you know brother Branham says it talking about Revelation he says the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth and I just can't help but think brothers and sisters we know this comes out of Christ is the mystery of God revealed but this dovetails with this scripture in Ephesians chapter 31 many times we look at it and say well this is exactly what we would say at a at a wedding because it's exactly what happens when the husband and the wife they they come together they have a relationship and then they have a child and and the two become one they both are represented in that child and and that's the way it is God wanted it that way because it was exactly what he wanted to do from the very beginning with his bride but this scripture here dovetails with this message quote here verse 31 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church I don't speak concerning a man and a wife I speak concerning Christ in the church but we know that this scripture was laying there for thousands of years for something yet to come and you know brothers and sisters we know we know that here we are we know that this is the day the Lord hath made this is the time for the bride to unite with Christ it's going to happen sometime out there maybe in a little bit of a different way but you know what brothers and sisters the more we talk about it I think the more it actually happens the more we recognize it the more it becomes a revelation the more that Dynamic can actually come upon the mechanic and the more we begin to recognize who we are there's so many symbolism uh so many types in the message of the hour that brother Branham talks about recognizing your position recognizing what God is actually doing but you know brother Branham he very carefully doesn't come right out and say it all the time he talks around it because it's not yet time and that's why the seventh seal was preached the way it was he got so far and the angel of the Lord told him stop don't go any further if you go any further it's going to actually not be timed because there's still people to come in you're going to actually cause the Rapture of the of the church there's still things that need to happen he was told to stop but in future preaching he explained it he explains it very well but you know brothers and sisters are true blessings they lie in us being in our position and being outside of our position we rob ourselves of our blessings and and I just wanted to say just like Harmony in the home it's like harmony with Christ because when we've got harmony with Christ we know that he's going to look after us and we know that he's going to lead us and we know that he's going to guide us but only if we're willing to let them sometimes in a marriage we can see it difficult for that to happen for many different reasons but we have to be able to trust we absolutely have to be able to trust and if we can trust then we can be in our positions we have to be willing to trust our husbands our husbands have to be willing to trust God and our children need to be able to trust our parents and and if we can't do that it becomes a very tragic situation you know Eve I think it was so good I think it was brother Mervin that brought it out over the the weekend boy the meetings last week were fantastic so good Eve she had her position and her husband and we know that God actually did the operation no I think it was brother Gilbert that brought it by cesarean he said the first operation the first Caesarean happened God took Eve out of Adam and when she was in Adam she was completely safe when she was in her husband Satan couldn't touch her because Satan had to get through the husband and you know as husbands and wives in this life as a husband if I'm in Christ then Satan can't get at my family unless he goes through Christ first but if I get outside of God look out that's where all manner of trouble can come on the scene but as long as Eve was in her husband she could not fall at all there was no way Satan could do it because he was a Son of God right but it's one she was separated that's when Satan came around why did he do that we know that God created him to be that way but he did it that way because he's a coward let's let's let's label him as he is that's why he did it that way because he knew that when she was separated that's when he could get at her but as long as she obeyed the word of God I think this is such an interesting discussion as long as she obeyed the word of God on her husband's lips she was okay even when she was separated from him and isn't it interesting because he didn't say it doesn't say in the word of God that Adam said to Eve don't eat of that fruit we're okay to eat everything in the garden honey but just don't touch that one let's not do that let's not eat from that tree the word of God says that he told Adam God told Adam when they were yet one so she knew it she had to know it it was already there but as long as she obeyed her husband's voice God in her husband she was still okay outside but as soon as she stepped out from the instructions of her husband she was doomed they they they could not fall so long as they followed the word of God I just think it's a beautiful thing when we when we look at this and recognize that this great mystery is speaking concerning Christ in the church and we know this is the day for that to happen brothers and sisters this is the day of recognizing that we're crossing over Jordan any day now we're going to see The Rapture of the church you know I just got into questions and answers this week and and I came across this and I just I had to stop and Rewind and play and stop and Rewind and play and think am I am I actually hearing this the way that brother Branham is saying it this is uh paragraph 329 out of questions and answers 1964. it says please explain people are saying brother Branham is more than a man he can create and Jesus can look just like brother Branham this is another point that uh brother Mervin brought out um months ago and I just think it's so beautiful brother Branham actually says it here I don't know if you brought that out if you brought this quote brother brother Mervin but uh he just says it so clearly you know when Christ was on Earth he created fish from Fish and bread from bread but where did those squirrels come from brother Branham says it here in this message but I'll just read this quote here that was just uh for free please explain people are saying brother Branham is more than a man he can create and Jesus can look just like brother Branham he says now let me the person said this whoever it might be I don't know but I am your brother see Jesus is your savior I cannot be your savior for he has already saved you and we know before the seals were open the Antichrist Spirit got in there that deity spirit and tried to make brother Branham Christ tried to label him that way and we know that he was faced with that same thing that Jesus was faced with when he was out in the desert he could have accepted it and said yeah sure that's cool and kept going but because he believed because he was who he was he was a true servant of the Living God he couldn't accept it and he said you know what you're going to make me Antichrist and there's no way that I can go forth with my Ministry so I'm going to pull myself off the scene if that's the way you're going to behave until we get this straightened out and he did and he straightened it up and then he went forward and preached the seals isn't it interesting how God would not let the seals be unraveled Unwound in error it had to be truth he says he has already saved you now you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth the person that told this person this he says now it's just a looks to me like it's a woman's handwriting very beautiful handwriting and I'd say that's a woman's handwriting wouldn't you brother Capps wouldn't you think that's a woman's handwrite a pretty handwrite and I don't know who it is see now brother Branham could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that I like I said I had to rewind fast forward um or rewind and play he says one sense of the word sorry I'll just read it again now brother Branham could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that one sense of the word that's exactly truth another sense of the word it's Antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist see for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high and will come again in great power and Glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him it's exactly the truth and you become Christ you don't become like Christ you become Christ so brothers and sisters I want to say to us tonight don't don't don't don't stumble at the badger skin don't look at your brother and sister and think oh that brother said this or that sister said that I'll say it all the time don't look at the badger skin don't do it because you're going to stumble and fall look at the word inside that Badger skin give it the word test brother Branham said if you can actually give it the word test and see a response according to the word then guess what that's Christ I know that's bizarre but brothers and sisters if you're looking for the word you're going to find the word and one day it's going to be that way I think we're going to say that when we look for the word in our brother and our sister and we say when we see that word in our brother and our sister and we can say that's Christ there's going to be a shout in the camp because it's a revelation it's not something that we can just say you know someone's going to tell you you're going to put it in your pocket and you get it and you're going to just be fine like that no it's got to be revealed to us individually that that new birth makes us one flesh not with our husband and our wife because Paul said I speak concerning a great mystery and that mystery is Christ in the church I no longer call you servants I call you friends I no longer call you church or friends but I call you bride so that you'll understand right but then we know it goes from bride to wife there's a transition happening and brothers and sisters we're right in that spot right now where we're going from bride to wife but it's a revelation Saint John 10 30 has to be for those who don't know it it's I am my father are one a real simple verse Saint John 10 30 I and my father are one and you know I think as the Devil comes around and starts talking to us and taunting us and poking at us and says well why would you do that why would you say that why would you think that why would you go there why would you have said that why would you have acted that way why would all of that have happened if you were Christ if you were God just keep saying it I am my father are one that's what the word of God says it doesn't matter you know I think it's interesting because we can look at I've got a bunch of notes here and I don't think I'll be able to get into it tonight but it's got to be this great mystery revealed to us individually Paul's fate concerning Christ and his church I just love it how he said that I no longer call you servants you know brother uh I think it was brother Gilbert as well that brought this out he said you know it's out of the Easter seal we've got to be able to tell we've got to be able to show and we've got to be able to prove the life that we're living that we're Believers that we believe the message of the hour and and I think that when it comes to telling and showing it can be pretty easy to do relatively speaking because we can tell people that we've been saved we can tell people that God sent a prophet we can tell people that we attend a church we can tell people that you know God's done certain things for us in our lives then we can show all kinds of quotes we can show all manner of scriptures that have been revealed to us we can show friends and family that believe this message of the hour we can tell and show a lot but how do we prove it how do we prove it brothers and sisters this is where the rubber meets the road or the brass tacks or the hard part of the conversation and this is just what the Lord I think is showing me and I'm certainly open to conversation about it but I believe it with all my heart brothers and sisters the tell and the show is pretty easy but the proof is a little bit more difficult but that proof is in our lives it's in the lives that we live it's in the examples that we show to all of the people around us and we can have like we've said many times a really good church attendance and really good polished behavior in church and we can tell and we can show but who are we with our family who are we with our enemies I think brother Gilbert says it all the time would our enemies have a good report of us in our lives the people that don't believe that work around us that work with us would they be able to say that's a believer and this questions and answers brother Bradham talks about the story about how there's the guys down at the bar the drunks they're there at the at the bar and he names the bar and names that the bar was renamed and knows exactly where it's at and and who is in there he tells it very clearly but then he says they're having a conversation in there and they start talking about the holy rollers and they say there's no such thing as a real Christian on earth now and they're all drunk talking about this I've I've experienced it brothers and sisters people love to get theological with alcohol it's bizarre but it's true and you know they're having this conversation in the bar whooping it up saying there's no such thing as a real Christian and there's one guy even even in the midst of being drunk he says oh no no no no there is I I know there is and I can show you I'll prove it to you come back to my house and he gives that example about how he treated his wife terrible and you know I wouldn't doubt that that that man call him a brother that that man he was used to that behavior he was used to treating his wife like a doormat treating her terrible like that he was used to it and so was she but you know there was a difference between the two of them he wasn't converted but she was and what happened they go back and and he said come on I'll show you we'll go back and we'll get drunk and we'll go back and and I'll show you that she's a real Christian and fix us some eggs honey and and when she did she made them all eggs I couldn't imagine that coming back after hours and just demanding that the wife would do all that but anyways they did and the wife fixed the eggs and what does he do he throws it on the floor and says that's garbage I can't believe you would do that you would make my eggs that way it's not the way I like them blah blah blah smash it on the floor and what did she do she just cleaned it up she started singing she started singing in her heart and expressing the life that was inside her don't worry honey I'll fix it for you I'll make it better for you honey because I love you don't worry I'll just make it better and she could have kicked him could have kicked him out said you're drunk you skunk get out of here but she didn't she expressed that life she was proving that life she didn't have to she didn't have to tell she didn't have to show because he did all of that and all she had to do was just be who she was she just had to live her life and by living her life she proved that there was truly christ-like people on Earth there truly was a representation of Christ Living out but to tell and show and prove it's got to be more than just telling someone it's got to be more than just telling and showing it's got to be more than Church quotes and church attendance and good dress and nice people I want to say this brothers and sisters we've got to be able to prove it we can show and tell all we want this is just just kind of fresh and I pray that you'd forgive me for it but you know elementary students have show and tell not mature Christians mature Christians just live their lives and by doing that they prove it they prove it to their children they prove it to their wives they prove it to their husbands they prove it to their brothers and sisters things don't flustrate them would you imagine that how many people will tolerate that a man just smashing his plate on the floor and saying that's garbage I can't believe you would do that can you imagine sometimes if the music is a little bit too loud in church people get upset sometimes if somebody sings the same song Too Much somebody gets upset sometimes if somebody doesn't shake your hand at the door somebody could get upset how many different little things can actually get us upset brothers and sisters are we mature Sons and Daughters of God are we there do our lives prove Who We Are how we conduct ourselves and our positions brothers and sisters I believe it proves that we recognize this great mystery it proves that we understand about one flesh you know um some of the study that I got into was talking about having having maybe having a temper and and getting upset and all the different things that can happen and you know we can cause a nervous condition and the people around us by having a temper and and it's not going to do anybody any good I'm not going to go there for time's sake I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters to recognize that even if we have a temper even if we have a situation in our lives where maybe it's just us in our flesh and we just don't know how to tame it because we can be good for weeks and months and then all of a sudden something will happen and snap the breaker flips and and we just see a red mist and we just go crazy again and turn into this person that we hate it doesn't mean that we're lost and it doesn't mean that we're not saved and brother Branham says it I'm just going to fast forward to the good stuff because I don't I don't want to say bad about any of us and remember when I talk about this stuff it's because I experience it I know what it means to have a temper and it does us no good brother random says this now a righteous man is not a sinless man if you notice he said Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he had his ups and his downs and his differences and the scripture of his life proves that he had his ups and downs like we do and he had his times of wandering he had his times that his temper got away from him and what he's referring to there is the she bears destroying those 42 kids that mocked him for not going up in the Rapture when his teacher went up he had his time he said and his times when his temper got away from him and there are a lot of things that went wrong brother Bradham says but he was still a righteous man because he confessed his unworthiness and believed in God so that's what made him righteous you know brothers and sisters if we can do that ourselves just recognize how little we really are and be willing to confess our faults one to another and pray for one another that our prayers might be heard and that we might be healed if we're willing to do that we're going to be proving the life that's inside of us but if we just hold it back and reserve it and say I never did nothing wrong you did something wrong you need to repent you need to say sorry you you you when I get anywhere we're still in Show and Tell right we still haven't Show and Tell with the class we don't want to be doing that we want to be proving just living our life just like we talked about with the the Sheep they just produce wool they don't try to produce wool doves they're just White they just are it's because of what's inside them it's the oil inside of them and I believe that with all my heart that we have the oil of the Holy Ghost Inside of us and that's why we gather together that's why we come to church that's why we worship together so that we can actually fill our cups that we can have the oil we know the difference between the virgins the five wise the five unwise of both of them had oil just that some of them ran out and the other ones went in God oil they actually made sure they had their oil topped up they were trimming their lap they made sure that they had it they were taking inventory all the time but you know he was still a righteous man and I want to say that tonight brothers and sisters just because we have ups and downs in our lives it doesn't mean we're not righteous it doesn't mean that we're not Sons and Daughters of God doesn't mean that we're not still currently showing and telling and proving Our Lives I don't mean to Discount that in any way by the way but I just wanted to try and magnify that one part if that's all we're doing then then we're missing the main point the main point is proving our lives and not proving our lives but proving his life proving that we are one the Twain have become one that this mystery is no longer a mystery through the revealing of the word for our day but you know in order to get this Revelation that we've talked about it takes the Holy Ghost in our lives and and and we'll go back to this every single time we will it takes the Holy Ghost it's got to be a revelation it's got to be revealed to us personally we heard brother Branham say it earlier that's the new birth the new birth is Christ but it's not just re realizing that God sent a prophet and there's all these Mysteries that have been revealed and the seals are unraveled and and and all of that has happened in our day and we can say that it's great it's not that it's recognizing that Christ and I are one that I invite Christ to come and live inside my heart and it's not just going to be an oath that I take and a badge that I wear it's not it at all it's simply that I invite him to be the the the life inside of me and and as we live our lives that way he will take over he will Express his life through us but it's not some crazy fundamental thing either at one time I thought that it was that it was something that would be so so dramatic and and so maybe legalistic and so so strange remember Jesus wasn't legalistic at all Jesus was the opposite of the law wasn't he even though didn't he come to magnify the law oh but what law not the Commandments of men that they were teaching for Doctrine no no no he was coming to magnify the Old Testament law to say that you know what there will be a lamb that will be offered there will be one sacrifice that will happen for all of sinful men and that's all that's going to require and that's why we've said it before his very first order of business after this last weekend that went down when he went to the Cross when he finally bowed his head and said it's finished and gave up the ghost he went directly from the cross into the temple and rent that Veil top to bottom and and that was to show openly that he triumphed over all of his enemies that there was no longer any separation between God and man and that veil has never been put back by God man has thoroughly put it back in place and we don't want to find ourselves with that Veil we don't want to be hiding behind a veil we don't want to have anything to do with the veil we just want to have the Life of Christ Living out through us and if we can do that brothers and sisters if we can formally surrender Our Lives to the Lord Jesus Christ in our day fully Embrace this word for our day then we will truly receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and once we do it will become a revelation of who we are and when we recognize what we are that's what the message of the hour says I was going to bring that quote it's right after that when he says Christ is the new birth uh he says when when the bride recognizes its position what it is then the Rapture will go and I don't think we can ever get bored of talking about that because that's that's our life that's where we stand and and that's why I want to try and encourage us tonight brothers and sisters as I call the musicians to to consider our positions consider our positions as husbands and wives but now consider our positions with Christ to recognize that as we as we near that headstone will be just like him and and I believe according to the quote we've read tonight that we won't be just like him we will be him we will be him and we're not going to be the Savior that died brother Branham said that and I'll just clarify that will never be the Savior it's not going to be that we're not going to change our flesh and and and turn into a different human being although all of our mannerisms will change they'll be altered there will be a different you and a different me living out through our lives and I believe for most of us if not all of us it's already taken place we're already living a different life we're already seeing things in a totally different perspective and that's one thing that we have talked about it living in a message home being raised being fed the pure word of God it can be so deceiving for Satan to come around and say well you never really did have a lightning bolt experience it never really did change your life entirely but something keeps holding you as a sister if you wear skirts and you want to if you have long hair that's never been cut and you want it that way what's causing that there's something on the inside of the inside that's causing that if you have a desire to go and now do that differently to go wear pants and to to behave differently if men have the desire to go and and shoot pool in a bar and maybe have the odd beer or or go and listen to the odd song and and watch the odd thing and do all these different things if we've got these desires there's still some work to do there's still some steps to take but it doesn't mean we're not righteous we're just on our journey maybe stand with me tonight as we close I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters to draw draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh unto you and when we draw nigh unto him just think about it this great mystery it's that the two shall be one flesh that it's going to be Christ Living out through his bride body the many membered bride body of Believers simply taking him had his word God bless you tonight let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight we just want to thank you for your goodness to us Lord thank you for your words of encouragement Lord to recognize that as much as we would like to try and and prove something Lord we can't do it we have to rely on you we have to trust in you entirely with our entire being Lord Jesus and we know that Satan is roaming as a roaring lion father and he he desires to devour our families he desires to devour our lives he wants to destroy our church he wants to destroy every single good thing about us but we know father you your life stops him you've said it in your word so many different ways that you you would simply rebuke the Devourer for our sakes and father we're so thankful that we can just take you at your word tonight Lord we pray that you would just help us consider our position Lord as husbands as wives as children and as the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord help us to to consider that position Lord as a as a wife as a chaste virgin to your word Lord as we go forwards and if it Be Your Will for us to gather again Lord on Sunday father will be careful to give you all the praise and glory we just ask that you would go with us now as we go our separate ways give us traveling mercies Lord if we're traveling Lord be with brother Michael as he
