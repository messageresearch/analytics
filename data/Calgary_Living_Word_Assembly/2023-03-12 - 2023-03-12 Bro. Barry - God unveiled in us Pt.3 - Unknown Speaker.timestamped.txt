[54:42] Lord Jesus Christ
[54:44] amen amen
[54:47] Hallelujah
[54:48] Welcome to our visitors
[54:51] Mr Lenae it's been a long time God bless
[54:53] you
[54:54] everyone else if you have your Bibles
[54:55] this morning I'd just like to read from
[54:57] John chapter 15.
[55:00] John chapter 15.
[55:02] start with verse 1.
[55:07] certainly a privilege to be in the house
[55:09] of the Lord this morning
[55:20] John chapter 15.
[55:24] again today talking about the the True
[55:28] Vine
[55:32] verse 1 says I am the True Vine and my
[55:35] father is the husbandman
[55:37] every branch in me that beareth not
[55:41] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[55:43] that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it
[55:47] may bring forth more fruit
[55:50] now ye are clean through the word which
[55:52] I have spoken unto you
[55:55] abide in me and I in you
[55:57] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[56:00] itself
[56:01] except it abide in the Vine
[56:04] no more can ye except ye abide in me
[56:09] I am the Vine
[56:10] ye are the branches
[56:13] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[56:15] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[56:17] without me
[56:19] ye can do nothing
[56:21] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[56:24] forth as a branch and is withered and
[56:27] Men gather them and cast them into the
[56:29] fire and they are burned
[56:32] if ye abide in me and my words abide in
[56:35] you you shall ask what you will
[56:38] and it shall be done unto you
[56:41] herein is my father glorified
[56:44] that ye bear much fruit
[56:47] so shall ye be my disciples
[56:50] the scripture here could easily be
[56:54] referred to as the scripture of Jesus
[56:57] speaking to his disciples
[56:59] which indeed he was the historical
[57:01] account
[57:02] he was speaking in a parable to his
[57:04] disciples and and it could easily be
[57:07] said that that's exactly what he did and
[57:09] that's exactly what that scripture is
[57:11] and that's all there is about it but we
[57:13] know we had a prophet in our day come
[57:15] and say that every scripture has a
[57:16] compound meaning and Revelation and
[57:20] today I I want to with you my brothers
[57:22] and my sisters take this scripture and
[57:24] lift it up out of history and make it a
[57:27] living word because it's not just a
[57:30] Jesus that came to Calvary and died and
[57:32] rose again and someday we'll meet him
[57:34] we're speaking about the Jesus Christ
[57:36] who is here right now with us in our
[57:39] midst
[57:40] we are talking about a living God
[57:43] let's just go to him in prayer gracious
[57:46] heavenly father one more time we're just
[57:48] so thankful that we can open our lips
[57:50] and and close our eyes Lord Jesus and
[57:53] open our hearts unto you father we know
[57:55] there's no greater privilege on Earth
[57:58] than to be able to commune with you but
[58:01] first we know father we need to be led
[58:03] and the only way we'll ever have
[58:05] communion with you is to be led and not
[58:07] just led by a man but led by Your Word
[58:10] father because we know that your word is
[58:13] spirit and life and father we just take
[58:16] your word the way that you've given it
[58:17] to us in our day and we just apply it
[58:19] father
[58:20] we just ask all these things now in
[58:22] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[58:25] bless you this morning you may be seated
[58:27] today
[58:29] I uh just a few announcements before we
[58:31] get into the word today
[58:35] um
[58:36] just such a beautiful thought I was
[58:37] looking at the calendar we're just about
[58:39] exactly one day away from the first day
[58:42] of spring officially
[58:44] such a a wonderful thought even though
[58:46] it looks like we're in the middle of
[58:47] winter here and it certainly feels like
[58:49] it
[58:50] but you know what I I think that we can
[58:53] actually just call the things that
[58:54] aren't as though they are
[58:56] and the things that are as though
[58:58] they're not
[59:00] um I can bear witness that down south in
[59:03] North Carolina
[59:04] it's actually Springtime the grass is
[59:07] green the daffodils are popping up and
[59:09] the trees don't really have leaves on
[59:11] them except for a few right at the very
[59:13] top you can see green buds coming out
[59:15] just like a little paintbrush on the
[59:17] tops of the trees it's beautiful and you
[59:19] know what's coming our way I have a
[59:21] lasting memory of being there last
[59:23] weekend when I got on the plane on
[59:25] Tuesday Morning leaving the hotel it was
[59:28] Pitch Black it was very early but I
[59:30] heard one sound that made me stop for a
[59:32] moment and that was a robin
[59:34] you could just hear the robin chirping
[59:36] with all of its might in the darkness
[59:38] and I thought my isn't that just a
[59:40] wonderful sound that Springtime coming
[59:42] our way
[59:44] so I just wanted to remind us that
[59:46] spring is on the way and we have Easter
[59:49] meetings coming up it's the week of the
[59:52] 5th of the ninth
[59:54] um
[59:54] Wednesday right through to Sunday it's a
[59:57] bit of a different thing here we haven't
[59:59] really done it and uh you know if you
[1:00:01] try different things you you never know
[1:00:03] you might get different results and we
[1:00:05] just want to try something a little
[1:00:06] different
[1:00:08] um just to have a little bit more church
[1:00:09] and I know that it's a lot of church to
[1:00:11] have services that many times so if you
[1:00:14] can't come because you have commitments
[1:00:16] or you have work or whatever it is it's
[1:00:18] okay the only thing is the idea is to
[1:00:22] get a little bit more Church get a
[1:00:23] little bit more of our time set aside
[1:00:25] just to see if God won't do something
[1:00:27] for us in our midst maybe we have a need
[1:00:29] in our lives maybe it's a personal need
[1:00:31] maybe it's in our family maybe we
[1:00:33] struggle with some scripture maybe we
[1:00:35] struggle with some message maybe there's
[1:00:37] something that we just don't understand
[1:00:39] we have a question or a longing in our
[1:00:41] heart if we set aside some time God will
[1:00:44] actually answer it for us if we're
[1:00:46] willing to just dedicate a little bit of
[1:00:47] time to him so if you can we certainly
[1:00:50] want to encourage you to I had said at
[1:00:52] one point if anybody has a friend or or
[1:00:55] family member that they've always wanted
[1:00:56] to invite to church it would be a
[1:00:58] perfect time for it we're going to split
[1:01:00] it up so it's not going to be all just
[1:01:02] brother Barry I'm only going to take one
[1:01:03] Service as far as I know and the rest of
[1:01:06] the Brethren are going to pitch in and
[1:01:07] and go for it so I think it's going to
[1:01:10] be a wonderful time in the Lord
[1:01:12] so pray for the April Easter meetings
[1:01:15] here
[1:01:16] and uh
[1:01:18] I'm sure we won't be disappointed
[1:01:20] this Wednesday coming up we have brother
[1:01:22] Mervin Lord willing he was going to take
[1:01:23] the service I'm not sure if that will
[1:01:25] still stand with sister Faye and the
[1:01:28] circumstances that's on the calendar and
[1:01:30] uh I haven't heard otherwise yet but you
[1:01:33] know we're always fluid and willing to
[1:01:35] just uh be be flexible we don't need to
[1:01:39] be rigid you know that's the way the
[1:01:40] Lord does things he he'll he'll take our
[1:01:43] paradigms and shatter them our ideas and
[1:01:45] traditions the way we think things
[1:01:46] should happen and and he'll just throw
[1:01:48] us off just to see if we really do
[1:01:51] believe we really do get upset we know
[1:01:54] the disciples are with them in the boat
[1:01:55] one time and that was a a real big deal
[1:01:57] but they didn't recognize who was in
[1:01:59] their boat but we know today who really
[1:02:01] is in our boat we don't have to worry so
[1:02:04] you know brother Mervin if you're
[1:02:05] listening this morning uh if it's if
[1:02:07] it's any trouble brother we'll certainly
[1:02:09] work it out we have a prayer meeting on
[1:02:12] Thursday the 16th
[1:02:14] we have a youth event on the 17th and
[1:02:17] then next Sunday we have a bit of a
[1:02:20] special Sunday we're gonna have a
[1:02:21] morning service and instead of a
[1:02:22] communion service this month we're going
[1:02:24] to have a worship service of praise and
[1:02:25] worship service and uh as the songs that
[1:02:29] we sang this morning I don't know how
[1:02:30] anybody could set still I couldn't I
[1:02:33] even came out and said to brother Peter
[1:02:34] I can't sit in that chair I have to move
[1:02:37] I have to express what's inside of me
[1:02:39] it's coming out and you know like we've
[1:02:42] said many times this is the quietest
[1:02:43] place we're ever going to be right here
[1:02:45] um there's something special about the
[1:02:47] thought of the redeemed and how the
[1:02:50] redeemed worship you know when the
[1:02:52] morning Stars sang together all of the
[1:02:53] Angels they sang together they sang
[1:02:55] together on a regular basis but there
[1:02:57] was a time where the sons of God shouted
[1:02:59] for Joy brothers and sisters and I can't
[1:03:01] help but think the reason they shouted
[1:03:03] for Joy is because they recognized they
[1:03:05] were redeemed they were not like the
[1:03:07] angels that were created to never fall
[1:03:09] they were created to fall and you know
[1:03:11] when we hear that word the the sons of
[1:03:13] God shouting for Joy I just can't help
[1:03:15] but put myself there and think you know
[1:03:17] what I was there before the foundation
[1:03:19] of the world not not from the foundation
[1:03:22] of the world because there was a time
[1:03:23] where it was starting from the
[1:03:26] foundation of the world but there's a
[1:03:27] group of people who are the sons and
[1:03:29] daughters of God who were from before
[1:03:31] the foundation of the world back in the
[1:03:33] mind of God before the before my
[1:03:36] goodness I I could just get started with
[1:03:39] that but we're going to have a praise
[1:03:40] and worship service if you have a
[1:03:41] special by all means feel welcome to
[1:03:44] bring it if you have never done a
[1:03:46] special and you've always wanted to it's
[1:03:48] a great opportunity just make a Joyful
[1:03:50] Noise is what the word says you don't
[1:03:52] have to be perfectly trained on key and
[1:03:54] and and and a master of it just make a
[1:03:56] Joyful Noise and express what the Lord's
[1:03:58] done for you and you know what if you
[1:04:00] don't want to bring a special just come
[1:04:01] and bring your lick of fire together and
[1:04:03] just see what the Lord will do
[1:04:05] next Sunday the 18th we're gonna have an
[1:04:07] evening worship service we'll just start
[1:04:09] at six o'clock and we'll just see what
[1:04:11] the Lord wants to do
[1:04:13] certainly like to thank brother Toby for
[1:04:14] the service last week
[1:04:17] really enjoyed that
[1:04:20] yeah amen
[1:04:26] you know it means a lot to to
[1:04:28] I would say a minister to a pastor to go
[1:04:31] away to have
[1:04:33] the ability the the desire to go away
[1:04:36] for whatever the reason
[1:04:38] and to know that someone is back home
[1:04:40] that is just going to put their shoulder
[1:04:42] to the wheel there's no alternate agenda
[1:04:45] it's just preaching the word of God
[1:04:47] knowing that we're together we're we're
[1:04:49] United together under one headship one
[1:04:52] leadership and we're pushing for the
[1:04:54] same thing it's just a wonderful thought
[1:04:56] it did my heart good to have a
[1:04:59] conversation Saturday night with our
[1:05:00] brother
[1:05:01] I want to bring greetings from many
[1:05:03] ministers in in
[1:05:05] all over the states actually from Ohio
[1:05:07] all the way over to I think even
[1:05:09] California there were some from Arizona
[1:05:11] there was some for Virginia I think
[1:05:13] there was Kentucky and uh and uh North
[1:05:17] Carolina South Carolina
[1:05:19] all over the place
[1:05:21] brother Wayne Lawson specifically
[1:05:23] said to send his greetings to the church
[1:05:25] in Calgary brother Daryl ward he said
[1:05:28] send his greetings to the church in
[1:05:29] Calgary Pastor Josh Bennett he was the
[1:05:32] pastor of the host Church in uh in
[1:05:35] Newton North Carolina where we were he
[1:05:38] said greet the church and brother George
[1:05:40] Smith was there he turned up and uh you
[1:05:43] know if you need any materials about the
[1:05:45] message witnessing materials he is a
[1:05:48] witnessing machine for the message of
[1:05:50] the hour he has all kinds of printed
[1:05:53] materials and we know Jeffersonville is
[1:05:55] no longer printing materials but there's
[1:05:57] some that are and so he has a lot and
[1:06:01] it's a really interesting thing having a
[1:06:03] conversation with him just before kovit
[1:06:05] I was working on seeing if we could get
[1:06:07] brother George Smith to come here and uh
[1:06:10] I really want to I want to get him here
[1:06:13] we're going to see if we can do it I
[1:06:14] invited him again he has a tremendous
[1:06:16] testimony he's a man you know it doesn't
[1:06:18] really do us any good spiritually it
[1:06:22] doesn't improve our spirituality but
[1:06:24] sometimes it's just nice to hear the
[1:06:26] stories of what it was like to be by the
[1:06:28] prophet we know that he married the
[1:06:29] prophet's daughter and he's got a lot of
[1:06:31] stories so it'd be neat to have him come
[1:06:34] and just spend a little bit of time with
[1:06:35] us he uh he said to say hello as well
[1:06:39] the whole premise of the weekend last
[1:06:41] weekend when I went to it was simply end
[1:06:44] time evangelism and and for pastors and
[1:06:47] for evangelists knowing that really we
[1:06:50] are working on the fields that are ready
[1:06:52] for Harvest but there's always going to
[1:06:54] be that last predestinated seed until
[1:06:57] that last predestinian sea comes in when
[1:06:59] that seed comes in and matures then we
[1:07:02] all go we know that day is approaching
[1:07:04] fast it's approaching rapidly and
[1:07:07] there's little points that I think were
[1:07:09] really really interesting to hear
[1:07:12] um you know brother Daryl ward he talked
[1:07:14] about it and I've mentioned this to a
[1:07:15] couple of the brothers but he he's a man
[1:07:17] now I think he's pressing 60 in in his
[1:07:20] life and he said when I first started
[1:07:22] evangelizing when I first started
[1:07:24] ministering the gospel I felt like the
[1:07:27] Lord was coming tomorrow because we were
[1:07:29] so far beyond the ministry of the
[1:07:31] Prophet I I think he started in like
[1:07:33] 1975 maybe the late 70s is when he
[1:07:37] started and uh he said I couldn't see
[1:07:41] that we would be going on as far as we
[1:07:43] have and I'm sure many of the Elder
[1:07:45] ministers those generals who are out
[1:07:47] there who have had their shoulder to the
[1:07:48] wheel for years and years for decades
[1:07:50] with this this message brother Daryl
[1:07:52] ward he said specifically though I see
[1:07:55] the end of my Ministry in sight
[1:07:58] and who knows if we see the coming of
[1:08:00] the Lord before that happens so the the
[1:08:02] idea here the premise is there's got to
[1:08:05] be someone that's going to grab the
[1:08:07] Baton and go forwards and carry this
[1:08:10] message of the hour to the people until
[1:08:12] we actually see that last predestinated
[1:08:15] seed come in and get mature
[1:08:18] so it was a really interesting time just
[1:08:20] to to listen to some of the experiences
[1:08:22] and and some of the the things that
[1:08:24] maybe work and some of the things that
[1:08:26] don't one of the things that the
[1:08:28] brothers did was talked about errors
[1:08:29] brother Daryl specifically talked about
[1:08:31] mistakes that he had made and you can't
[1:08:34] buy that kind of experience you can't go
[1:08:36] to a School of Theology and get that
[1:08:38] kind of information that kind of input
[1:08:41] it was it was really moving to hear the
[1:08:43] humility in the hearts of the brothers
[1:08:45] and just you know be able to hear things
[1:08:47] that can help so that was why I went
[1:08:50] there I was very very encouraged and uh
[1:08:52] I just think it's a wonderful time to
[1:08:55] get with Believers especially pastors
[1:08:58] and uh just to see what the Lord's doing
[1:09:00] and you know it's it's really no
[1:09:02] different there are no different people
[1:09:04] um there than they are here and and all
[1:09:06] around the world we're all believers
[1:09:08] we're all Sinners saved by grace but
[1:09:11] it's just an amazing thought to think
[1:09:13] that we're not just Sinners saved by
[1:09:15] grace we're Sinners that were saved by
[1:09:17] grace from before the foundation of the
[1:09:19] world so that we could actually fulfill
[1:09:21] the word for our day we could be the
[1:09:23] Willing recipients for that that call it
[1:09:26] the football that's going to be thrown
[1:09:27] to the end zone that long bomb that God
[1:09:30] knew someone would be there to be able
[1:09:32] to receive that word
[1:09:35] I uh wrapped up the whole weekend I was
[1:09:38] telling this on Wednesday but for those
[1:09:40] who didn't catch it I I was able to go
[1:09:42] through the Billy Graham Library in uh
[1:09:44] in Charlotte North Carolina and it's a
[1:09:47] tremendous thing to look at the life of
[1:09:48] that Minister and we know that anybody
[1:09:51] who knows the message of the hour knows
[1:09:53] that brother Branham talked about Oral
[1:09:54] Roberts and Billy Graham as those two
[1:09:57] angels that went down to Sodom he typed
[1:10:00] them as those two angels that went down
[1:10:02] to Sodom but not just out of the the
[1:10:04] story of Sodom but in the in the Sodom
[1:10:07] condition the world is in today and what
[1:10:09] did they do they went and preached the
[1:10:11] people blind
[1:10:13] and what did they preach them blind to
[1:10:15] the truth for their day but it's
[1:10:17] interesting when you look at it because
[1:10:18] they actually just even Billy Graham he
[1:10:21] preached to millions and millions of
[1:10:22] people he had answered prayers there's
[1:10:25] testimonies of answered prayers and you
[1:10:27] know brother Branham says it you know
[1:10:28] they didn't have a lot of healing
[1:10:30] but they certainly preached blindness
[1:10:33] and uh maybe we'll get into that quote a
[1:10:35] little bit later I don't know if we'll
[1:10:36] get there but it was just really moving
[1:10:39] to look at that that whole museum and to
[1:10:41] think that you know this man had such a
[1:10:43] tremendous testimony such an impact such
[1:10:46] an impact that they labeled him I don't
[1:10:48] know if it was the U.S or or the world
[1:10:50] Evangelical Society I don't know but
[1:10:53] they labeled him as America's pastor and
[1:10:57] a world the world evangelist and I'm not
[1:11:00] trying to pump the tires of Billy Graham
[1:11:03] today what I am trying to say is it's
[1:11:05] amazing because we believe in the
[1:11:06] seventh angel messenger Bar None we know
[1:11:09] who that is we know what that is we know
[1:11:11] all about that but I've just never
[1:11:12] really looked at the anointing of those
[1:11:15] two angels that went down to Sodom and
[1:11:17] when you stand there and you see the
[1:11:18] pictures and the videos of this man and
[1:11:21] you see how he impacted the world
[1:11:23] if you think about it if he is the
[1:11:25] pastor of the USA if we study
[1:11:28] Revelations chapter 13 13 stars 13
[1:11:31] stripes if you've gone down that road
[1:11:34] before you'll understand how he could be
[1:11:37] America's Pastor because he smote them
[1:11:39] blind they think that they're rich
[1:11:40] increased with Goods they have need of
[1:11:42] nothing everything is fine they can have
[1:11:44] a pastor and they can have a worship
[1:11:45] team and and they can have the smoke and
[1:11:48] the lights and and if you want to talk
[1:11:50] about a laodicean worship just go and
[1:11:52] look at one of those churches that's not
[1:11:54] what we do and we never will we're so
[1:11:57] thankful that we can actually Worship
[1:11:58] the Lord in spirit and in truth Lord
[1:12:02] willing we're going to get into that
[1:12:03] discussion down the road here in 23
[1:12:05] worship true worship and what that
[1:12:08] really means but to think about Billy
[1:12:10] Graham and how he impacted the world
[1:12:12] with his ministry and how humbling it is
[1:12:16] brothers and sisters to realize those
[1:12:17] people they they never had a chance they
[1:12:20] were smote Blind by the gospel that
[1:12:22] Jesus came he died on Calvary he was
[1:12:25] murdered he was put to death he was
[1:12:27] buried he rose again and and you know
[1:12:29] praise God I'm saved that's as far as it
[1:12:32] goes
[1:12:33] but as soon as you start to talk I just
[1:12:36] can't help but think about brother
[1:12:37] Gilbert now I and my father are one as
[1:12:40] soon as you start talking like that whoa
[1:12:41] then you're getting crazy right they're
[1:12:43] going to pick up stones and say you're
[1:12:44] nuts you're mad but that was the purpose
[1:12:46] of the message of the our brothers and
[1:12:48] sisters not to bring a bunch of
[1:12:49] mysteries but to unravel the Mysteries
[1:12:51] to unveil the Living God to say that
[1:12:54] he's no longer veiled that he's actually
[1:12:56] standing In Plain Sight
[1:12:58] as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:13:01] well we know uh the spirit of God is
[1:13:03] always moving and and and those two
[1:13:06] angels came and and they they they
[1:13:08] fulfilled their Ministry one of the
[1:13:11] things that we saw there which also I
[1:13:13] found to be fascinating they were on
[1:13:15] they showed clip after clip after clip
[1:13:17] in one of the video stations when you
[1:13:19] walk through this place of of how he was
[1:13:22] on talk shows and and they wanted to
[1:13:24] interview him as as America's pastor and
[1:13:27] they wanted to grill him and say really
[1:13:29] you're saved how do you know you're
[1:13:30] saved and just really ask them tough
[1:13:33] questions and try and rattle them and
[1:13:35] get them upset and shake them and you
[1:13:36] know what he wouldn't even Flinch he
[1:13:38] would just say you know what God loves
[1:13:40] you too all you have to do is accept him
[1:13:43] in the power of his resurrection and you
[1:13:45] too could be saved he loves everyone he
[1:13:47] would that nobody would be lost and he
[1:13:49] would just go into preaching but what
[1:13:52] that was it wasn't the man it was the
[1:13:54] anointing of that angel in the man
[1:13:58] and to close it off I thought it was
[1:14:00] just amazing because he spoke words that
[1:14:01] our Prophet spoke he said you know one
[1:14:04] day they're going to say that I died
[1:14:06] this is actually on his Tombstone one of
[1:14:08] these days they're going to say that I'm
[1:14:09] I've died but he said don't you believe
[1:14:11] them because I will have gone into the
[1:14:13] presence of God and I'll be more alive
[1:14:15] than I ever have in my entire life in
[1:14:18] the presence of God that's exactly the
[1:14:19] way brother Bradham would say it too
[1:14:21] we're never going to die we don't die
[1:14:22] Believers don't die the only only thing
[1:14:24] is it just changes our our location
[1:14:28] even unbelievers don't die which is
[1:14:31] terrible but you know it's true
[1:14:34] but we know there's only one form of
[1:14:35] eternal life we'll just clarify that
[1:14:37] there's only one form of turtle life and
[1:14:39] that's God's life
[1:14:40] the unbelieving will not be in an
[1:14:43] eternal hell
[1:14:44] brother Branham said it very clearly
[1:14:45] there's no eternal hell that's a
[1:14:47] trinitarian Doctrine to say that there's
[1:14:49] an eternal house forever and forever and
[1:14:52] that's a space of time brother Bradham
[1:14:53] said very clearly but there's only one
[1:14:56] thing that's Eternal and that's God's
[1:14:58] life Zoe God's own life and if we have
[1:15:01] his Spirit within us brothers and
[1:15:02] sisters then we've got nothing to worry
[1:15:04] about
[1:15:06] I just can't help but think about how
[1:15:07] the the spirit of God is just always
[1:15:10] moving you know and like we said at the
[1:15:12] very beginning we read this scripture
[1:15:14] here in John chapter 15 how he is the
[1:15:18] vine he's the True Vine and we are the
[1:15:20] branches and and how this scripture is
[1:15:24] moving and it's not just staying in one
[1:15:26] place saying that this is a scripture
[1:15:27] for the disciples in the time that Jesus
[1:15:29] was here on Earth under that anointing
[1:15:33] excuse me what he was doing was setting
[1:15:35] an example to say that anyone who has
[1:15:37] his spirit in them is going to be the
[1:15:40] branch and his life when when they
[1:15:42] receive his life his real life in them
[1:15:45] then that life is going to manifest
[1:15:47] through that individual and it's not
[1:15:50] something that we can put on we can't
[1:15:51] produce it we can't manufacture it it
[1:15:54] just happens it's just like the trees
[1:15:57] when the sun changes the the the the
[1:15:59] Azimuth in the sky when that sun changes
[1:16:02] and the light spectrum changes all of
[1:16:04] the trees recognize it's time to
[1:16:06] actually pull that life out from the
[1:16:08] roots and go up into the branches bring
[1:16:10] all of that that those chemicals so they
[1:16:13] can go back into the the branches and
[1:16:15] and Purge forth life that's exactly what
[1:16:18] we're talking about in John chapter 15.
[1:16:20] and I want to focus this morning
[1:16:22] specifically
[1:16:24] on verse 8 herein is my father glorified
[1:16:26] that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be
[1:16:29] my disciples we're not looking at the
[1:16:32] scripture and thinking that you know
[1:16:33] we're going to just go and bear some
[1:16:34] fruit we're going to go and do some
[1:16:36] spiritual exercises and and get some
[1:16:38] more fruit it's not like that at all the
[1:16:41] only way that we can do it is to
[1:16:43] actually submit ourselves unto the word
[1:16:45] and some people would say well submit
[1:16:47] yourself to the church submit yourself
[1:16:49] maybe to the elders or or or the Deacon
[1:16:52] board or or maybe just some more prayer
[1:16:54] all of that would certainly help but you
[1:16:57] know the only way that we're going to
[1:16:58] see more fruit in our lives is to submit
[1:17:00] ourselves unto the word unto Jesus
[1:17:03] Christ himself and if we do that then we
[1:17:06] will see this word not just stay as a
[1:17:09] stale stagnant word that was just for
[1:17:11] Jesus disciples one day it will become
[1:17:13] our word and we'll be able to say I see
[1:17:15] myself there and you know when brother
[1:17:17] Branham talks about it we probably heard
[1:17:19] it before we were talking about it on
[1:17:20] the weekend you know there's no accident
[1:17:22] that brother Branham says things and he
[1:17:24] tells that story of going to visit that
[1:17:26] little boy going to visit his auntie
[1:17:28] somewhere and he he sees himself in a
[1:17:31] mirror for the very first time but he
[1:17:33] has a recognition to say mama that's me
[1:17:36] I recognize myself there it has to be
[1:17:38] the same way in the word of God brothers
[1:17:40] and sisters this is not about other
[1:17:42] people if it's about other people then
[1:17:44] we're missing the point of the word for
[1:17:45] our day it's got to be a living word for
[1:17:48] us in our day the spirit of God is
[1:17:50] always moving and how does he move he
[1:17:52] moves by a pillar of fire uh but to lead
[1:17:55] the People by night and A Cloud by day
[1:17:58] and we know that we have witnessed both
[1:18:00] of those in our generation he is the
[1:18:02] same yesterday today and forever he is
[1:18:05] the same he does not change his ways
[1:18:08] we know that the the churches would like
[1:18:11] to say well he does change his ways and
[1:18:13] some of the stuff was just cultural and
[1:18:15] you know that was for a different age
[1:18:16] and you know the apostolic age ended
[1:18:19] somewhere along the way but nobody can
[1:18:21] put a date to it and say it ended
[1:18:23] specifically right there we know that
[1:18:26] the apostolic age is where we're living
[1:18:28] because it never ended but Brother Brad
[1:18:30] I'm the prophet for our day
[1:18:32] he said we're not just building a wall
[1:18:34] anymore brothers and sisters we're
[1:18:35] building a house
[1:18:37] and because we're building a house we've
[1:18:39] got to pay attention to the plan we've
[1:18:42] got to pay attention to the blueprints
[1:18:44] and you know from our little bit of
[1:18:46] building experience that we had one of
[1:18:47] the most important things that we could
[1:18:49] ever do when we're in the midst of a
[1:18:51] project and we're building and we have a
[1:18:53] question about what to do next is to
[1:18:56] invite the architect to come to our site
[1:18:58] our site and take a look at our plans
[1:19:01] and take a look at our building and take
[1:19:03] a look at our problem and help us come
[1:19:05] to a conclusion that will match the
[1:19:07] blueprint when we're done
[1:19:09] and it's no different for us today
[1:19:11] brothers and sisters this this this
[1:19:13] message is moving and and it's moving
[1:19:15] fast we can look at the world today and
[1:19:17] say the world is moving fast and AI it's
[1:19:20] like a freight train AI is on the scene
[1:19:22] and we know that it's continually
[1:19:23] learning and there's little voice boxes
[1:19:25] in people's houses all over the world
[1:19:27] millions and billions of them and
[1:19:29] telephones and computers AI is listening
[1:19:32] and learning and it's like a freight
[1:19:34] train but they say once it gets going
[1:19:36] they're not going to be able to stop it
[1:19:37] and what's going to happen then who
[1:19:39] knows
[1:19:40] the B system will have a pretty easy
[1:19:42] access to the whole entire world but I'm
[1:19:45] not saying that to scare us I'm saying
[1:19:46] not to say look if the world is gaining
[1:19:49] that much power and that much momentum
[1:19:52] and that much knowledge how much more
[1:19:54] the Sons and Daughters of God a
[1:19:56] recognition to who they really are
[1:20:02] the word of God is moving and one of
[1:20:04] these days it's going to move right on
[1:20:06] out of here it's going to change our
[1:20:08] bodies
[1:20:09] but I just think it's such a beautiful
[1:20:11] thought I don't think I'm done talking
[1:20:13] about this I'm not going to really go
[1:20:14] too far into it today but to think that
[1:20:16] you know the the church was was once
[1:20:19] just called out from from Egypt they
[1:20:22] were the called out from Egypt and then
[1:20:24] they were the called out Church brother
[1:20:27] Branham says they became the church the
[1:20:29] called out ones and they moved from the
[1:20:31] church to with Jesus where they were
[1:20:34] servants as disciples but there came a
[1:20:36] point in time in the relationship with
[1:20:39] Jesus and his disciples where he said
[1:20:41] you know what I no longer call you
[1:20:43] disciples I no longer call you servants
[1:20:45] but I call you friends there's a
[1:20:48] changing a developing a nurturing of the
[1:20:51] relationship it's growing and the same
[1:20:54] thing happens between a husband and wife
[1:20:55] I'm sure that we could hear the Elder
[1:20:58] say it you know I I never loved my wife
[1:21:00] as much as I do now I thought I loved
[1:21:02] her when we first got married but my
[1:21:04] goodness now many years down the road I
[1:21:06] love her more than I ever have
[1:21:09] and to think that this church now moved
[1:21:12] into the servant role and from the
[1:21:14] servant role moved into friends Jesus
[1:21:16] himself said I call you friends when we
[1:21:18] think about the prophet of God in our
[1:21:20] day thousands of years after that
[1:21:22] discussion with his disciples he said to
[1:21:24] them I no longer call you church I call
[1:21:27] you bride so that you'll understand what
[1:21:29] I'm going to hand you when I open these
[1:21:32] seals that wasn't William Mary and
[1:21:33] Branham saying those words brothers and
[1:21:35] sisters that wasn't just a fancy
[1:21:37] statement that was God himself standing
[1:21:40] on Earth saying hey something
[1:21:42] significant is about to happen the whole
[1:21:44] world is about to change in 1963 when
[1:21:46] the seals are open every one of them are
[1:21:49] all the way opened something is going to
[1:21:51] take place and I want to make sure that
[1:21:53] you understand it it's not going to be
[1:21:55] for everyone on the planet it's only
[1:21:56] going to be for a very select few those
[1:21:59] ones who were with me were in me from
[1:22:02] before the foundation of the world on
[1:22:03] the back of my mind I no longer call you
[1:22:05] servants I no longer call you church I
[1:22:08] no longer call you friends but I call
[1:22:10] you bride and so brothers and sisters
[1:22:12] that was back in 1963 where are we today
[1:22:15] this word is moving on to think that
[1:22:18] this relationship is growing it's
[1:22:21] evolving
[1:22:23] my goodness I can say it not just like
[1:22:25] my wife but as a Son of God I love him
[1:22:28] now today more than I've ever loved him
[1:22:31] so many things now I understand but you
[1:22:33] know the more I understand the more I
[1:22:35] recognize there's very little I could
[1:22:37] ever do all I have to do is just accept
[1:22:40] him and his word and when I do that I
[1:22:43] recognize that he is going to do it all
[1:22:45] he's going to perform it all like I said
[1:22:46] when I came back from North Carolina I
[1:22:49] was busy thinking that there was some
[1:22:50] way that I needed to pray some way I
[1:22:52] needed to come to church something I
[1:22:53] needed to do I had to fast I had to do
[1:22:55] all these different things so that we
[1:22:57] would see results when we pray you know
[1:22:58] what it's not up to me to bring the
[1:22:59] results
[1:23:00] it's up to him to bring the results the
[1:23:02] only thing I need to do is be in my
[1:23:04] position and that's the key brothers and
[1:23:06] sisters and I think it's just beautiful
[1:23:07] because this is just like a hand to
[1:23:09] glove it's just dovetailing together
[1:23:10] when we talk about our positions of the
[1:23:13] husband and the wife and the children
[1:23:14] and how the scriptures tell us how we
[1:23:16] should act we can act that way as the
[1:23:19] wife of Jesus Christ towards our husband
[1:23:22] and boy when we get into our position
[1:23:25] positionally placed in the word as the
[1:23:28] Bride of Jesus Christ what's going to
[1:23:30] happen is we're going to have a little
[1:23:32] bit more of a relationship that
[1:23:34] relationship is going to evolve into
[1:23:36] such a closeness that we're going to
[1:23:38] have an intimacy
[1:23:40] and you know what that means is that I
[1:23:42] believe it with all my heart there's
[1:23:43] probably people here that have
[1:23:44] experienced it as not just me I'm not
[1:23:46] someone who's super spiritual but I'll
[1:23:47] say it this way as we go we are going to
[1:23:50] be a super church we are going to be a
[1:23:52] super race and I would say we are now a
[1:23:55] super church we are now a super race and
[1:23:58] so it's not that foreign to say a little
[1:24:00] bit super spiritual brothers and sisters
[1:24:02] if we're not super spiritual then I
[1:24:04] think that we're missing the mark but
[1:24:06] you know people will say they're
[1:24:07] Fanatics when you start talking that way
[1:24:09] because really what it is is you're
[1:24:10] saying I and my father are one it's not
[1:24:13] two it's one you're having an intimate
[1:24:16] relationship with him and you know where
[1:24:18] we're going brothers and sisters is not
[1:24:19] to remain as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:24:21] we know that the word of God brother
[1:24:23] Toby said it you know on Sunday he said
[1:24:26] there's a scripture in Revelations that
[1:24:28] we need to Rejoice there's coming a time
[1:24:30] where we'll say we should rejoice and be
[1:24:32] very glad not just a little glad be very
[1:24:34] glad shout like the sons of God and
[1:24:38] recognize that the bride has made
[1:24:40] herself ready
[1:24:42] but not the bride
[1:24:44] it doesn't say bride in the word it says
[1:24:47] his wife
[1:24:48] hath made herself ready there's a change
[1:24:51] somewhere between there and where
[1:24:54] brother Branham said I no longer call
[1:24:56] you church I call you Brett there's an
[1:24:58] intimacy that comes together where the
[1:25:01] two become one where they start to
[1:25:03] actually discern each other's thoughts
[1:25:06] brother Bradham said you're going to
[1:25:08] have the mind of Christ in you and
[1:25:09] you'll know what to do with the word
[1:25:13] I would say that's pretty intimate
[1:25:15] I don't think it gets any more intimate
[1:25:17] than that don't don't think intimate in
[1:25:20] terms of a natural relation brothers and
[1:25:22] sisters although the nacho types the
[1:25:24] spiritual but we're talking about the
[1:25:26] most intimate relation ever and that is
[1:25:29] that when we have a thought we're going
[1:25:31] to have a husband that says all right
[1:25:32] I'll give it to you you didn't even say
[1:25:34] it I know you didn't say it nobody else
[1:25:37] heard you say it but somehow somewhere
[1:25:39] you're gonna have it delivered to you
[1:25:40] because I'm the one hearing your
[1:25:42] thoughts we know brother Branham said
[1:25:44] that our thoughts are louder in heaven
[1:25:46] than our voices here on Earth my
[1:25:49] goodness this word is moving it's a
[1:25:51] transition I think it's just so
[1:25:53] beautiful
[1:25:55] because we're moving into our position
[1:25:56] as the wife of Jesus Christ we're moving
[1:26:00] from bride into the wife position where
[1:26:02] it's the most intimate relation that
[1:26:04] there is where you know what we are able
[1:26:07] to have a new birth that's what comes
[1:26:09] out of it
[1:26:11] we just simply have a new birth we can't
[1:26:13] help it when we take that word into US
[1:26:15] brother Branham he said it you know I
[1:26:17] preached on it for a long time and we
[1:26:19] just say like Mary be it unto me
[1:26:20] according to Thy word that angel
[1:26:22] messenger bringing that word and we just
[1:26:24] say Amen to that word we have a new
[1:26:27] birth that happens inside of us and we
[1:26:29] know the angel messenger said that that
[1:26:30] birth that's going to happen isn't going
[1:26:32] to be you it's not going to be your
[1:26:33] child it's not going to be anyone other
[1:26:35] than Jesus Christ the power of the most
[1:26:39] high is what's going to overshadow you
[1:26:41] and that's what will bring this to to
[1:26:42] life and we know that at the salutation
[1:26:45] of the name Jesus in Elizabeth's ears
[1:26:49] when the Two Sisters got together to
[1:26:51] talk about what's going on how crazy
[1:26:53] things were getting in their lives the
[1:26:55] salutation of Jesus in Elizabeth's ears
[1:26:57] caused her baby John the Baptist to LEAP
[1:27:00] in her womb at the name of Jesus Christ
[1:27:02] how much more the Sons and Daughters of
[1:27:04] God today brothers and sisters I just
[1:27:06] can't help but think how wonderful that
[1:27:08] is as we're going forwards we're moving
[1:27:11] into our position and it's in one
[1:27:13] position it's not in two positions it's
[1:27:15] not in three positions it's not in
[1:27:16] various different positions and
[1:27:18] different angles around the message of
[1:27:20] the hour it's only one message and that
[1:27:22] one message is Jesus Christ the same
[1:27:24] yesterday today and forever and that one
[1:27:26] message is what's going to change our
[1:27:27] bodies
[1:27:29] no other message will change our bodies
[1:27:33] the only way we get there is just simply
[1:27:35] accept the word for our day
[1:27:39] but with this transition with this
[1:27:41] moving of the word
[1:27:44] we're transitioning it's it's a
[1:27:46] transition time things are moving very
[1:27:48] quickly all around us we've said it and
[1:27:51] and I just think it's so beautiful to
[1:27:53] see
[1:27:54] how incredible this transition anointing
[1:27:57] is
[1:27:59] on one hand we can look at the world
[1:28:01] around us and say this whole
[1:28:02] transitioning thing is horrible and it's
[1:28:04] terrible and and with the perversion of
[1:28:07] creation the way that God made it it is
[1:28:10] it's horrible and it's terrible and what
[1:28:13] makes it horrible and terrible I think
[1:28:15] probably the most horrible and terrible
[1:28:18] is that they're taking away the rights
[1:28:20] for parents to be able to have choice in
[1:28:23] their children's future
[1:28:25] when children don't have a developed
[1:28:27] enough mind to be able to make a solid
[1:28:29] decision the B system now has control
[1:28:32] where they're saying that children can
[1:28:35] make their own decision and it's not up
[1:28:37] to parents and if parents want to say
[1:28:39] anything against it they can actually
[1:28:40] get in trouble for it think about how
[1:28:43] far that's gone it's terrible in my
[1:28:45] opinion I think that's the worst because
[1:28:46] parents should be able to parent until
[1:28:48] they're done parenting until their
[1:28:50] children are ready to fly until they're
[1:28:52] ready to be adults according to the way
[1:28:54] parents want them to be
[1:28:57] but you know it's an anointing that's on
[1:29:00] this age and the whole entire world
[1:29:02] doesn't even recognize it we've talked
[1:29:04] about this in the past but I think it's
[1:29:05] important to just remember when we see
[1:29:08] the influence of this it's all over
[1:29:11] North America it's all over Europe it's
[1:29:13] all over the world everywhere we go
[1:29:16] there's nowhere that we can go where
[1:29:18] it's not affected and you know there's
[1:29:19] some countries you might say they've got
[1:29:21] laws and it's it's not allowed
[1:29:22] homosexuality is against the law and and
[1:29:24] maybe it's severely punished if you get
[1:29:26] caught and and you know what that's fine
[1:29:28] and good but there's still social media
[1:29:30] social media the internet has its
[1:29:33] tentacles everywhere in the world and
[1:29:35] I'll tell you that spirit is using that
[1:29:38] platform more than anywhere and and
[1:29:40] that's what's happening brothers and
[1:29:42] sisters that anointing is everywhere on
[1:29:44] the world it's come in like a flood the
[1:29:45] enemy has come in like a flood but you
[1:29:48] know what brothers and sisters the
[1:29:49] spirit of God will always raise a
[1:29:50] standard against it and you my brother
[1:29:53] my sister are that standard that God has
[1:29:55] chosen to raise up against that and you
[1:29:57] know what one day we're going to be shut
[1:29:59] down for talking this way but until that
[1:30:01] day we're going to say it we're going to
[1:30:02] say it clearly we're going to speak it
[1:30:04] you know what we we love the sinner but
[1:30:06] we hate the sin if you come against the
[1:30:09] word of God you're sinning
[1:30:11] yes but all creation is groaning for
[1:30:14] this all creation is groaning for it
[1:30:16] Romans chapter 8 you know the earnest
[1:30:18] expectation of the creature wadeth for
[1:30:21] what
[1:30:22] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:30:24] but you know what brothers and sisters
[1:30:26] take a look at how dark and gloomy it is
[1:30:28] out there how much change how much
[1:30:29] movement there is from from the way the
[1:30:32] forefathers fought I heard people in the
[1:30:34] U.S saying they were U.S citizens saying
[1:30:36] that my forefathers never fought for
[1:30:38] this country the way this country is
[1:30:40] right now they would never have fought
[1:30:42] and laid down their lives for this and
[1:30:45] to think about it the Canadian soldiers
[1:30:46] would be the same way to think that
[1:30:48] we're we're talking about trying to
[1:30:50] create an environment where men will be
[1:30:52] women and women will be men what on
[1:30:54] Earth is that that's a Sodom condition
[1:30:56] right there if we ever saw it and I
[1:30:59] would say this brothers and sisters it's
[1:31:00] never been this Sodom
[1:31:03] since before the days of Sodom and we
[1:31:05] know what happened then right
[1:31:08] but I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:31:10] present time are not worthy to be
[1:31:12] compared with the glory oh my which
[1:31:14] shall be revealed in US
[1:31:16] because if we're children then we're
[1:31:18] heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with
[1:31:21] Christ
[1:31:22] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:31:25] that we may also be glorified together
[1:31:30] thinking about this suffering
[1:31:34] you know we're not going to be taken out
[1:31:35] and scourged
[1:31:37] you can talk to many different people
[1:31:38] and get many different answers according
[1:31:40] to the message of the hour for this some
[1:31:42] say there will be a severe persecution
[1:31:44] some say they'll be hunted down like
[1:31:46] dogs you can find quotes to support
[1:31:48] everything
[1:31:50] you want but excuse me to think about
[1:31:53] this that you know
[1:31:55] if Christ has a bride
[1:31:58] and she has already judged herself
[1:32:00] does she need to be judged
[1:32:02] does she need to be persecuted and
[1:32:04] hunted down like a dog
[1:32:06] is that really what's going to happen to
[1:32:08] the bride when the prophet of God
[1:32:09] preached the sermon there's going to be
[1:32:11] a secret sudden
[1:32:12] catching away of the Bride
[1:32:17] we're judging ourselves here
[1:32:19] and I would say as we judge ourselves
[1:32:21] here we suffer here
[1:32:22] we look at this world around us and we
[1:32:24] suffer we suffer with Christ because we
[1:32:27] know that he looks at his creation and
[1:32:30] he groans he looks at his creation and
[1:32:33] and cries to think that men would want
[1:32:37] to be women and women would want to be
[1:32:38] men and children won't even be given the
[1:32:40] choice they'll just be influenced by
[1:32:42] that spirit
[1:32:46] I would say that suffering with him
[1:32:49] but that's so that we may be also
[1:32:51] glorified together
[1:32:53] verse 16 here is really what I wanted to
[1:32:55] get to with uh you know Romans chapter 8
[1:32:58] just bringing this in a little bit
[1:33:00] here and as my father glorified that you
[1:33:02] bear much fruit so that you be my
[1:33:04] disciples that's John 15 8.
[1:33:07] why is that
[1:33:09] we can try all we want brothers and
[1:33:11] sisters but the spirit itself
[1:33:13] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:33:16] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:33:18] God it's not something that we can
[1:33:20] manufacture
[1:33:21] the shape just has wool
[1:33:24] the dove he's just White and the reason
[1:33:27] for the both of those is they both have
[1:33:29] oil on the inside of them that just
[1:33:31] causes them to just be the way they are
[1:33:34] they don't have to go and have a bath
[1:33:35] the oil inside of them just cleans them
[1:33:38] it Bears witness the spirit on the
[1:33:40] inside Bears witness that we are the
[1:33:43] children of God and all of creation is
[1:33:45] groaning for the manifestation of us
[1:33:47] brothers and sisters when we look at the
[1:33:49] world and see how terribly dark it is
[1:33:51] and how maybe frustrating it is to see
[1:33:54] how it seems like Satan is getting such
[1:33:56] a victory in this world in this age it's
[1:33:58] only because it's the end of all time
[1:34:01] it's the change of everything brother
[1:34:03] Branham said it very clearly in the
[1:34:05] seventh seal the seventh seal is the end
[1:34:07] of all creation it's the end of all time
[1:34:10] it's the end of all prophecy it's the
[1:34:12] end of all things and that seventh seal
[1:34:14] is wide open before our wandering eyes
[1:34:17] we can see it and if you can't see it
[1:34:19] today I pray that you will be able to
[1:34:21] see the seventh seal all the way open
[1:34:23] because then it changes the Bible it's
[1:34:26] like brother Bradham said you should be
[1:34:27] able to see Jesus Christ from Genesis to
[1:34:29] revelation we should be able to see the
[1:34:31] seventh seal from Genesis to Revelation
[1:34:32] because really what is the seventh seal
[1:34:34] it's Christ Jesus the unveiling of the
[1:34:38] almighty God in our day
[1:34:40] my goodness
[1:34:43] you know we're not stuck beyond the
[1:34:45] spirit of bondage again to fear we
[1:34:49] talked about it on Wednesday and I just
[1:34:51] had it on my heart when we were down
[1:34:52] south thinking about it you know you
[1:34:54] hear stories and and you see the way
[1:34:55] people behave and and different
[1:34:57] situations and I I just can't help but
[1:35:00] but word it this way that you know if
[1:35:02] we're preaching do's and don'ts then
[1:35:04] then we're actually missing the the meat
[1:35:07] of the word we're missing the power of
[1:35:09] what the message of the hour truly is
[1:35:11] brothers and sisters if we've got to
[1:35:13] preach do's and don'ts then we're not
[1:35:15] getting people to Christ we're getting
[1:35:16] people to church and we're doing the
[1:35:18] same thing at that point under the guise
[1:35:20] of the message of the hour that Billy
[1:35:22] Graham did we're taking people to the
[1:35:25] Cross to say that Jesus was here and he
[1:35:27] he was crucified for our sins he died
[1:35:30] for us and he rose again and then
[1:35:32] someday he's coming back for us but the
[1:35:34] message of the hour takes us further
[1:35:36] than that brothers and sisters and shows
[1:35:38] us that he's actually come he's already
[1:35:40] come you know he's leading the church by
[1:35:43] Pillar of Fire and a cloud just like we
[1:35:46] read
[1:35:47] we're not giving back to the bondage of
[1:35:50] a spirit of of fear the bondage of fear
[1:35:54] to preach do's and don'ts and and have
[1:35:56] people live under that guy we want to
[1:35:58] get people to Jesus Christ to The Living
[1:36:00] Word for our day that's the only way
[1:36:03] we're going to have success brothers and
[1:36:04] sisters that's the only way we're going
[1:36:06] to truly see the Jesus of the Old
[1:36:09] Testament Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:36:10] being Jesus of the new the Holy Ghost in
[1:36:12] you the only way we're going to see that
[1:36:14] is to get people G to Jesus Christ
[1:36:16] brother Bradham said it I I'm afraid
[1:36:19] that we're only getting people to church
[1:36:20] we're not getting people to Christ it
[1:36:22] can't be getting people to an
[1:36:24] association if we do that then we're
[1:36:26] just another denomination
[1:36:28] that we preach Jesus Christ the same
[1:36:31] yesterday today and forever when he the
[1:36:34] spirit of Truth come he will lead us and
[1:36:36] guide us into all truth and that's where
[1:36:38] it gets a bit scary where it gets a bit
[1:36:41] frightening for some people because we
[1:36:43] know that we've seen people who have
[1:36:44] actually misused the message of the hour
[1:36:46] people who have been raised up under
[1:36:48] Ministries in under the guise of the
[1:36:50] message of the hour you know we can see
[1:36:52] all kinds of different things out there
[1:36:53] but just bringing it down home who we've
[1:36:56] had ministers who have mistreated the
[1:36:58] Bride of Jesus Christ doesn't change the
[1:37:01] people
[1:37:02] it just changes the ministers I found
[1:37:04] some quotes about that that brother
[1:37:06] Branham talks about and and it's going
[1:37:08] to be woeful for those ministers that
[1:37:10] mistreat the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:37:12] sometimes it's not a physical abuse or
[1:37:13] even a mental abuse it's a spiritual
[1:37:15] abuse they take the Bride of Jesus
[1:37:17] Christ down the road they're not
[1:37:19] supposed to go
[1:37:20] but his Spirit beareth witness with our
[1:37:22] spirit and I'll just love that I just
[1:37:25] love that I had a pastor that when I
[1:37:28] first got saved in the message of the
[1:37:29] hour that's what he did I thought maybe
[1:37:31] he would preach do's and don'ts he would
[1:37:33] he would give us direct answers to maybe
[1:37:35] some certain questions and he would say
[1:37:37] you know what you've got to do the work
[1:37:38] for yourself you've got to see what God
[1:37:40] wants from it you can't come to me and
[1:37:42] expect me to give you an answer because
[1:37:44] then every time you're going to come to
[1:37:45] me and you're going to want me to give
[1:37:46] you an answer but it's got to be a
[1:37:48] relationship between you and him
[1:37:52] because his spirit will bearth witness
[1:37:54] in our lives
[1:37:55] and if we don't have his spirit it's sad
[1:37:58] but it's true brothers and sisters that
[1:38:00] Spirit beareth witness in our lives when
[1:38:03] we behave according to the word and when
[1:38:05] we misbehave according to the word you
[1:38:07] can't hide it it beareth witness what
[1:38:10] spirit is on the inside of us people can
[1:38:12] only act for a period of time
[1:38:14] but whatever's on the inside of them the
[1:38:17] more that they're under the anointed
[1:38:18] word the more that they're under the
[1:38:20] preached word of the hour the more that
[1:38:22] that happens the more they manifest
[1:38:24] whatever seed is inside of them because
[1:38:27] we know it's the word of God that
[1:38:29] fertilizes the sea Gene of God that's
[1:38:32] inside us from before the foundation of
[1:38:34] the world and we cannot hide Who We Are
[1:38:38] but when we are truly the Sons and
[1:38:40] Daughters of God when that word comes
[1:38:42] forward that that sea Gene just leaps in
[1:38:45] the womb it just jumps to life it says
[1:38:47] Amen to that word just like John the
[1:38:50] Baptist
[1:38:51] I just couldn't help but think about
[1:38:53] this word moving and how the bride is is
[1:38:55] moving into her place moving into her
[1:38:57] position and we've talked about this as
[1:38:59] families and and how God he has a bride
[1:39:03] that he has chosen from before the
[1:39:05] foundation of the world you know Satan
[1:39:07] was given the opportunity to go and take
[1:39:08] a bride out of the perfect garden out of
[1:39:10] the perfect condition and he did but now
[1:39:13] Satan has been given six thousand years
[1:39:15] to create his own garden to create his
[1:39:17] own environment and God said you know
[1:39:19] what don't doubt that I will take a
[1:39:22] bride of my own choosing out of your
[1:39:23] garden and when I come she will not
[1:39:26] refuse my word it's not that she's going
[1:39:28] to refuse my church or refuse my
[1:39:30] ministers or refuse any of that it's not
[1:39:33] going to be do's and don'ts it's going
[1:39:34] to be my word that she will not refuse
[1:39:36] and she will go right into her position
[1:39:40] the woman the church the feminine the
[1:39:42] bride the wife in her position you know
[1:39:45] brothers and sisters there's no more
[1:39:46] powerful position in the universe is
[1:39:48] there then the Bride of Jesus Christ no
[1:39:52] longer just the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:39:53] but the wife of Jesus Christ
[1:39:56] we know that if you play chess besides
[1:39:59] the king there's only one other player
[1:40:01] that is more powerful than the king even
[1:40:04] more powerful than the king is that
[1:40:05] right and that's the queen she can do
[1:40:07] anything she wants to on that board and
[1:40:10] you know what that's he what he's done
[1:40:12] for us in our day if we can get into our
[1:40:14] position as his wife brothers and
[1:40:16] sisters I I believe it there's no
[1:40:19] telling what we could do on the board
[1:40:20] the chess board that God has we know
[1:40:22] that God is not afraid to actually take
[1:40:25] a wager
[1:40:26] right he did that with job
[1:40:28] Satan came and and and was doing his
[1:40:31] thing and God said to him hey have you
[1:40:33] ever considered my servant job knowing
[1:40:35] that job was a part of him before the
[1:40:37] foundation of the world but job didn't
[1:40:39] recognize it and we know through that
[1:40:41] whole trial that's where job was able to
[1:40:43] come to the realization of it
[1:40:47] excuse me
[1:40:48] I just think it's wonderful though if we
[1:40:50] can get into our position
[1:40:52] there's only one way that she can get in
[1:40:53] there brothers and sisters
[1:40:55] that's just to take him at his word
[1:41:00] can't believe I've gone this far and I
[1:41:02] haven't had a quote but here we go I got
[1:41:04] one
[1:41:05] brother Branham says like Israel back in
[1:41:08] her Promised Land
[1:41:11] she didn't know she don't know how she
[1:41:14] got back there
[1:41:15] she was just automatically put back
[1:41:17] there
[1:41:18] why
[1:41:20] National Force put her in her place
[1:41:24] brother Branham and this is in the
[1:41:25] message recognizing your day and its
[1:41:27] message he says now I'm going to say
[1:41:29] something
[1:41:30] National Force put Israel in her
[1:41:33] Homeland National Force will put the
[1:41:36] church in the world Council of churches
[1:41:39] we're not the church brothers and
[1:41:40] sisters
[1:41:42] that's changed 1963 that changed
[1:41:46] but the power of God will put the people
[1:41:49] in The Bride
[1:41:50] it's the power of
[1:41:53] God that's going to do that he says the
[1:41:55] world forces this way and the world
[1:41:57] forces that way but the but God forces
[1:42:00] upward the spirit of God which is the
[1:42:02] word of God my word is spirit and life
[1:42:06] will put the bride in her place
[1:42:09] isn't that beautiful
[1:42:11] we don't have to worry about trying to
[1:42:13] put ourselves
[1:42:14] in our place
[1:42:16] I think it's just magnificent when we
[1:42:19] look at this for me it just takes all
[1:42:21] the pressure off
[1:42:22] I don't have to try anything I just have
[1:42:25] to follow his word if I just follow his
[1:42:28] word he will put me in my position
[1:42:32] my word is spirit and life will put the
[1:42:34] bride in her place because she'll
[1:42:37] recognize her position in the word
[1:42:41] then she's in Christ we'll put her in
[1:42:44] her place no National Force will do it
[1:42:46] but the National Force did Drive Israel
[1:42:49] to the Homeland the national forces of
[1:42:51] the Council of churches will drive every
[1:42:52] organization into it but the power of
[1:42:55] God will raise the bride into Glory out
[1:42:57] of it he says oh people recognize your
[1:43:00] day as Jesus warned you the sign of
[1:43:02] Sodom and the church's condition of this
[1:43:05] day
[1:43:07] just don't have to look very far do you
[1:43:09] Sodom condition is everywhere and isn't
[1:43:13] it wonderful to think that the condition
[1:43:15] that we live in maybe I shouldn't say it
[1:43:17] that way forgive me strike that from the
[1:43:19] record it's not wonderful to think about
[1:43:21] I was being sarcastic and I shouldn't be
[1:43:23] from here to think that it's not just
[1:43:25] one day out of the year that we
[1:43:27] recognize it it's not like it's Mother's
[1:43:29] Day or it's Father's Day or it's boss's
[1:43:32] day or it's employees day
[1:43:34] it's pride month
[1:43:36] we've got to do a month
[1:43:38] we have to do a big show it's got to be
[1:43:40] a big deal and that's the world that we
[1:43:43] live in and go and look at churches
[1:43:46] churches get lots of lots of action and
[1:43:49] lots of likes
[1:43:50] but the reason for it is they're
[1:43:52] actually pulling on the senses of people
[1:43:54] they're not actually preaching the word
[1:43:56] of God and most of it is the music
[1:43:59] they're pulling people in they've got a
[1:44:01] worship team I heard someone speaking
[1:44:03] about it recently they said they had
[1:44:04] smoke machines they've got lights
[1:44:07] they've got all of the the wonderful
[1:44:10] gifts that God has placed in people's
[1:44:11] lives but they're worshiping and you
[1:44:13] know they're worshiping in vain they
[1:44:15] really honestly believe they're
[1:44:16] worshiping God the terrible thing is
[1:44:18] they're worshiping the God of this evil
[1:44:20] age they don't recognize that if you've
[1:44:23] got cut hair and you're praying you're
[1:44:24] not praying to God that if you've got
[1:44:26] cut hair and you're wearing pants you're
[1:44:28] not actually worshiping God when you're
[1:44:31] singing
[1:44:34] it's terrible but that's the condition
[1:44:36] we live in we can recognize our day in
[1:44:39] its message we can recognize that the
[1:44:41] word of God is moving it can feel like
[1:44:43] you know what brother Barry we've heard
[1:44:44] this so many times from
[1:44:46] 1965 onwards we've been in the message
[1:44:49] for 40 years and we've heard it all and
[1:44:51] you know what it's just going to be that
[1:44:53] way that's what the word of God says
[1:44:55] wasn't it the same since the fathers
[1:44:56] fell asleep nothing has changed and one
[1:44:58] of these days brothers and sisters we're
[1:45:00] going to start to see our loved ones
[1:45:01] because they who who went before us are
[1:45:04] going to come and they're going to be
[1:45:06] saying to us take take notice take
[1:45:08] notice all that you ever believed is
[1:45:10] actually at hand right now you don't
[1:45:13] have to look any further you can just
[1:45:15] rest we said this a little while ago and
[1:45:17] I think it's just such a beautiful thing
[1:45:18] imagine if you were just getting ready
[1:45:20] one night to go to bed or getting ready
[1:45:22] one morning getting out of bed and you
[1:45:24] had an angel of God come to you and say
[1:45:26] to you just an angel of Light that fit
[1:45:29] the full description manifestation of
[1:45:31] the word of God and said to you you
[1:45:33] don't have to worry brother Henry you
[1:45:35] actually made it everything that you've
[1:45:37] ever dreamed about even though you have
[1:45:39] faults and failures in your flesh you
[1:45:40] don't have to worry about it at all
[1:45:42] because you're already seated in
[1:45:43] Heavenly places brother just keep doing
[1:45:45] what you're doing don't worry about
[1:45:47] trying to change and be a different
[1:45:48] person brothers and sisters we've had
[1:45:51] that delivered to us in our age the
[1:45:54] prophet of God God speaking through the
[1:45:56] prophet of God saying that you are the
[1:45:58] sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:46:00] Christ that he has taken for his own
[1:46:02] choosing
[1:46:04] you don't have to do something different
[1:46:05] you don't have to try and be someone
[1:46:07] that you're not just be yourself just
[1:46:10] keep doing what you're doing just keep
[1:46:12] pressing toward that prize remember when
[1:46:14] brother Brown went across there beyond
[1:46:16] the curtain of time what that voice said
[1:46:18] to him when he had to come back he said
[1:46:19] no no I don't want to go back and he
[1:46:21] said the remaining thought that he had
[1:46:23] was that voice saying just keep pressing
[1:46:25] on don't give up brothers and sisters
[1:46:27] this is no time to give up
[1:46:29] faith I'm preaching to myself here maybe
[1:46:32] I'm getting a little excited brother
[1:46:34] Barry take a breath I I'm preaching to
[1:46:36] myself here I think about the many times
[1:46:38] that I fall and that I fail and that I
[1:46:42] have misery in my own life and think
[1:46:44] that how could I ever go on how could I
[1:46:46] ever go and stand behind a sacred desk
[1:46:48] and actually speak to his bride but you
[1:46:52] know what that voice just says get back
[1:46:54] up just get up you're either down or
[1:46:57] you're getting up but you're never going
[1:46:59] to stay in that position you're never
[1:47:01] going to be down we just have to keep
[1:47:03] pressing on brothers and sisters and
[1:47:05] have Grace one for another recognizing
[1:47:08] that we're all Sinners saved by grace
[1:47:10] and you know what's beautiful because
[1:47:12] that's the way he chose to do it
[1:47:15] and if we have any questions oh my
[1:47:17] brother Daryl took a text down there it
[1:47:19] was so good man he talked about how
[1:47:21] Rahab she's always referred to as the
[1:47:24] Harlot right
[1:47:25] she never had just Rahab the woman Rahab
[1:47:29] the redeemed Rahab anything else it's
[1:47:30] Rahab the Harlot
[1:47:32] she was a harlot and the word of God
[1:47:35] says so but you know what
[1:47:38] rahab's life was her sermon
[1:47:42] Rahab all she had to do was accept that
[1:47:45] messenger's words
[1:47:47] and she actually knew it in her heart as
[1:47:50] a harlot that's when the word came to
[1:47:53] her brothers and sisters not when she
[1:47:54] was Polished in the church she wasn't
[1:47:57] already in the congregation of Israel
[1:47:59] she was a harlot and you know what just
[1:48:01] because she accepted the word when it
[1:48:03] came she and her whole family was saved
[1:48:09] you want to save your whole family just
[1:48:12] take the word the way that it was
[1:48:13] delivered to us just accept it the way
[1:48:16] that God gave it to us and apply that
[1:48:18] token say give me a true token and watch
[1:48:21] and see if he won't do it
[1:48:25] her life was her sermon
[1:48:27] she didn't have to preach
[1:48:29] her life being a harlot was her sermon
[1:48:31] that she was a sinner saved by grace
[1:48:35] and you know what's fascinating with
[1:48:38] this brothers and sisters is this is the
[1:48:40] lineage of Christ
[1:48:42] he didn't come through any other lineage
[1:48:44] he came down through Rahab the Harlot
[1:48:49] because he needed to demonstrate he was
[1:48:51] taking sinful flesh tempting like
[1:48:54] manners in every single point so that he
[1:48:57] could take it all of the sin through all
[1:49:00] of the ages all the faults and failures
[1:49:02] and nailed them to his cross so that
[1:49:04] some people could say amen I accept that
[1:49:07] he paid it all I don't have to do
[1:49:09] anything
[1:49:11] but that's what happens when we get into
[1:49:12] do's and don'ts we're trying to take
[1:49:14] sins and nail them to his cross we're
[1:49:16] trying to take sacrifices and try and
[1:49:18] apply them and and you know what the
[1:49:20] word of God says that he went and paid
[1:49:22] the price he went and strove for sin he
[1:49:24] went a strove against blood he actually
[1:49:26] went to the cross and he nailed sin to
[1:49:30] the Cross once and for all and went to
[1:49:33] be at the right hand of the father and
[1:49:34] is set down on his throne and you know
[1:49:37] what that means to be set down that
[1:49:39] means full Authority just like the queen
[1:49:41] on the chessboard
[1:49:44] you know brothers and sisters here now
[1:49:45] we're starting to get into our text and
[1:49:47] we have like 17 minutes left looking at
[1:49:50] this scripture John 15 verse 8 herein is
[1:49:53] my father glorified that ye bear much
[1:49:55] fruit
[1:49:57] so shall you be my disciples you aren't
[1:49:59] going to be his disciple unless you're
[1:50:00] bearing fruit brothers and sister and
[1:50:02] the only fruit that you want to bear in
[1:50:04] my opinion my view is the spirit of
[1:50:07] Christ that's all and he will bring
[1:50:10] forth the fruit in your life all you
[1:50:12] have to do is trust him and he will
[1:50:14] bring the fruit in your life
[1:50:16] here's another quote brother Bradham
[1:50:18] talking about the fruit of the spirit he
[1:50:20] says what is the fruit of the spirit
[1:50:21] many times I thought the fruit of the
[1:50:23] spirit is maybe you know like we would
[1:50:25] see what the fruits of the spirit are
[1:50:27] excuse me in terms of the scriptures and
[1:50:29] we'll get into that
[1:50:30] but here we have brother Bradham saying
[1:50:32] something just so radical no wonder he
[1:50:35] he shook the foundations of Christendom
[1:50:37] of of all of the associations of all of
[1:50:41] the the the the many membered Christian
[1:50:44] people in this world how he says this
[1:50:46] what is the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:50:50] the manifestation of the promised word
[1:50:54] it sounds like such a simple statement
[1:50:57] doesn't it I said it that way just to
[1:50:59] lead us on a little bit what is the
[1:51:01] fruit of the spirit the manifestation of
[1:51:03] the promised word that's all it is if
[1:51:05] they'd just stopped to look he did not
[1:51:08] have these things that they had fruit of
[1:51:11] the spirit or anything but the word that
[1:51:13] was promised that day was manifesting
[1:51:16] himself
[1:51:17] that was exactly the light of the hour
[1:51:20] that was it see
[1:51:22] no matter how much education how kind
[1:51:25] how much you speak with tongues
[1:51:28] how much kind gentle and everything you
[1:51:31] are unless you accept that word of the
[1:51:35] hour
[1:51:36] when it's manifested before you
[1:51:39] when it's manifested before you you're
[1:51:42] in the same predicament
[1:51:44] it sounds like such a simple thing
[1:51:46] brothers and sisters I hope we can just
[1:51:48] dwell on this let it saturate just think
[1:51:50] about it doesn't matter what we do what
[1:51:52] kind of service we have how polished we
[1:51:54] remain maybe how long we've been around
[1:51:56] the message it doesn't matter about any
[1:51:58] of that unless we accept that manifested
[1:52:00] word
[1:52:01] when it's presented
[1:52:03] we're going to miss it we're going to be
[1:52:04] in that same predicament brother Brandon
[1:52:05] says that might sound crude I don't mean
[1:52:07] it that way but it's the truth
[1:52:10] just just believe it see all right now
[1:52:12] God forgive me you see what I mean
[1:52:15] who had the fruit of the spirit Jesus
[1:52:18] he said search the scriptures you think
[1:52:20] in them you have eternal life but they
[1:52:22] are they to testify of me they tell you
[1:52:25] who I am
[1:52:26] he never did come out and say who he was
[1:52:29] though did he
[1:52:30] isn't that beautiful Jesus never one
[1:52:33] time said thus saith the Lord did he
[1:52:36] why didn't he because he was the Lord he
[1:52:40] didn't have to say thus saith the Lord
[1:52:41] he wasn't just a prophet he wasn't any
[1:52:44] prophet he was the prophet
[1:52:49] they tell you who I am he never did come
[1:52:51] out and say who he was he didn't tell
[1:52:52] them
[1:52:54] and he and he got this great
[1:52:55] congregation he said unless you eat the
[1:52:58] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[1:52:59] blood who's the son of man
[1:53:03] unless you do that
[1:53:05] you have no life in you we know that
[1:53:07] everybody said oh he's a vampire he's
[1:53:09] crazy he's mad we need to leave him
[1:53:11] alone and get out of here but it was by
[1:53:13] revelation
[1:53:14] maybe people didn't understand exactly
[1:53:16] what it was but something on the inside
[1:53:18] of the inside said hey Amen to that word
[1:53:21] I don't understand it but I accept it
[1:53:23] all of it the way that he has brought it
[1:53:25] so just just to be clear to clarify the
[1:53:27] fruit of the spirit Galatians 5 the
[1:53:29] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[1:53:31] long-suffering gentleness and goodness
[1:53:33] and Faith meekness Temperance against
[1:53:34] such there is no law and you know we
[1:53:36] just heard brother Bradham say it
[1:53:37] doesn't matter how much of that you have
[1:53:39] how much of that you have unless you
[1:53:41] receive the fullness of the word for
[1:53:43] your day when it's presented to you then
[1:53:45] you'll be in the same predicament as
[1:53:47] those people Ephesians chapter 5 says
[1:53:49] for ye were sometimes Darkness not just
[1:53:51] in darkness but you were Darkness you
[1:53:54] were sometimes Darkness but now ye are
[1:53:57] light in the Lord
[1:53:59] walk as children of light for the fruit
[1:54:02] of the spirit is in all goodness and
[1:54:04] righteousness and Truth proving that
[1:54:06] what is acceptable unto the Lord
[1:54:10] when he the spirit of truth comes he
[1:54:13] will lead us and guide us into all truth
[1:54:14] and what will happen then brothers and
[1:54:16] sisters then will begin to bear fruit
[1:54:17] we'll begin to bear fruit what we'll do
[1:54:19] is we won't bear fruit maybe in terms of
[1:54:22] just being a good polished person people
[1:54:24] will come and stomp on your toes
[1:54:25] remember brother Bradham says that you
[1:54:27] can act all you want but when the
[1:54:29] pressure comes that's when we start to
[1:54:30] show who we really are when things start
[1:54:32] to get a little bit crazy when things
[1:54:34] start to maybe not go our way when
[1:54:36] things start to get topsy-turvy that's
[1:54:38] when you start to see who people really
[1:54:39] are the true inner man comes out when
[1:54:43] things start to get a little bit crazy
[1:54:44] when the pressure's on but you know
[1:54:46] what's going to happen is maybe brothers
[1:54:48] and sisters you'll be the same person in
[1:54:50] every single point of your life but when
[1:54:51] the pressure comes in your life suddenly
[1:54:53] you'll behave differently
[1:54:55] suddenly there will be a new person
[1:54:57] living there it might be as subtle as
[1:54:59] that and that's where brother Branham
[1:55:01] says the Holy Ghost is without sensation
[1:55:03] there's no lightning bolt experience
[1:55:04] where you can say wow I got it now and
[1:55:07] you know when people say that you
[1:55:08] probably want to just take a step back
[1:55:10] and say well wait a second you know
[1:55:12] let's have a conversation about it
[1:55:15] um but there's no sensation about it at
[1:55:17] all it's our lives we bear fruit and the
[1:55:19] fruit that we bear brothers and sisters
[1:55:21] is the manifestation of the word for our
[1:55:24] day and that is the evidence of the Holy
[1:55:26] Ghost and that's the only evidence of
[1:55:28] the Holy Ghost it's not saying that I've
[1:55:30] got good deeds and actions and behaviors
[1:55:32] and thoughts and and and and and I give
[1:55:35] and and whatever it's not our actions at
[1:55:38] all it's our ability to receive the word
[1:55:40] and not just our ability to receive the
[1:55:42] word it's our ability to actually be
[1:55:43] purged as the branch because he is the
[1:55:45] true vine the only true vine and when we
[1:55:47] live in our position as the queen as the
[1:55:50] Bride As the wife he will Purge that
[1:55:53] branch and we will bring forth fruit
[1:55:58] I I just think it's beautiful when you
[1:56:00] think about that too because you know in
[1:56:02] the anointed once at the end time
[1:56:03] brother Branham talks about how there's
[1:56:05] a rain that's going to fall and when
[1:56:07] that rain falls everyone rejoices the
[1:56:10] weeds and the wheat
[1:56:12] and you don't know who is who in the zoo
[1:56:14] we just don't know that it's not up to
[1:56:17] us to know that we can say by
[1:56:19] discernment well someone's not behaving
[1:56:21] according to the word of God okay but I
[1:56:24] I don't know I'm not interested in being
[1:56:26] a quick draw a gunslinger for people to
[1:56:28] say that they're in or out that's not up
[1:56:30] to me that's up to him the only thing I
[1:56:32] want to do is just continue to preach
[1:56:33] the word preach the truth in season and
[1:56:36] see God take action based on that word
[1:56:39] that's the only thing that he's
[1:56:40] obligated to our opinions don't count
[1:56:43] my opinion doesn't count if I ever offer
[1:56:45] my opinion I apologize
[1:56:47] it's not worth anything
[1:56:52] you know looking at this this this whole
[1:56:55] idea of the moving the word moving in
[1:56:58] our day and and seeing how it's changed
[1:57:01] positions
[1:57:03] what it is we've said it a little bit
[1:57:05] earlier it's the unveiling or the
[1:57:07] revealing
[1:57:08] and that happens by faith and we know
[1:57:10] that faith is the substance of things
[1:57:12] hoped for and the evidence of Things Not
[1:57:15] Seen and faith is a revelation the
[1:57:18] Rapture to the believer is a revelation
[1:57:20] it's not something that we can put on we
[1:57:23] can't just say that I'm going to go out
[1:57:25] and buy myself some Faith where the
[1:57:26] random talks about it he says you're
[1:57:28] gonna can't just go down to the corner
[1:57:29] store and buy yourself some Joy I think
[1:57:32] it'd be awesome if we could I would have
[1:57:34] a an abundance of Joy on hand in my own
[1:57:37] life in my maybe in my glove box in my
[1:57:40] vehicle just so I had it there but you
[1:57:42] can't do that that's not the way it
[1:57:44] works the joy that we're after is the
[1:57:47] the strength of the Lord the joy of the
[1:57:49] Lord is our strength
[1:57:51] but faith is the evidence of things
[1:57:55] hoped for the the the evidence of things
[1:57:57] not seen you know we're talking about
[1:58:00] living in a day where we're going to see
[1:58:01] a Rapture a body change happen and uh
[1:58:06] you know that faith when we live it out
[1:58:08] in our lives is what will come forward
[1:58:10] when the father is glorified as we bear
[1:58:14] much fruit we're going to have faith and
[1:58:16] we're not just going to have faith to
[1:58:17] say that I can move a mountain or I can
[1:58:19] lift a car by my thoughts or I can just
[1:58:22] have something that I desire set an
[1:58:24] attention for it it's not that at all
[1:58:26] brother Branham says it's common faith
[1:58:29] that moves the hand of God just like
[1:58:31] hisp that applied the blood for the
[1:58:33] children of Israel the Passover in Egypt
[1:58:35] and you know our works is our faith
[1:58:40] expressed and every one of us is at a
[1:58:42] different level of our walk where we're
[1:58:45] going to Bear forth fruit nobody is
[1:58:48] exempt from it we're all on a journey
[1:58:49] and we're all getting acquainted one
[1:58:52] another with the Lord with the word in
[1:58:54] our lives and we need to just be careful
[1:58:57] to offer the grace that we need for one
[1:59:00] another so that we can all make that
[1:59:01] spiritual journey so that we can all
[1:59:03] make that that that relationship happen
[1:59:07] we've got to be willing to make room for
[1:59:08] one another but you know our works as
[1:59:10] Faith expressed brother Bradham says
[1:59:12] that their husband and wife
[1:59:14] they're not just you know your works and
[1:59:17] your faith are kind of separated they're
[1:59:19] not our Behavior or our works is our
[1:59:23] faith expressed our Behavior expressed
[1:59:26] and you know the word of God says that
[1:59:28] we're supposed to Bear forth much fruit
[1:59:30] when we do bear forth much fruit then
[1:59:32] our father is glorified he is glorified
[1:59:34] through us and the fruit that we bear
[1:59:37] and the fruit that we bear had better
[1:59:39] line up with his word and if it doesn't
[1:59:41] you know we can set it earlier we just
[1:59:43] need to get back up we don't need to
[1:59:44] stay down and wallow in it
[1:59:47] but we need to continually keep pressing
[1:59:49] on that's what brother Branham said just
[1:59:50] keep pressing on as the believer of the
[1:59:53] word for our day just keep pressing on
[1:59:54] we know that healing is a revelation
[1:59:56] God's word says it and all we have to do
[1:59:59] is believe it
[2:00:00] we we we I I think myself I can just
[2:00:03] talk about myself I I have thought that
[2:00:06] there's something that I need to do to
[2:00:07] see healing and you know what there's no
[2:00:09] specific prayer there is the prayer of
[2:00:12] faith that we need to pray but you know
[2:00:14] the the word of God is true and that's
[2:00:16] all there is to it and we just need to
[2:00:18] say beat unto me according to Thy word
[2:00:20] and and you know we don't need to take a
[2:00:22] thought for what should be said what
[2:00:24] needs to happen
[2:00:26] we can just see the Lord move on the
[2:00:28] scene all we have to do is believe it
[2:00:29] you know where we're at today brothers
[2:00:31] and sisters is Rapture Rapture is a
[2:00:34] revelation
[2:00:36] and you know it's it's only going to
[2:00:38] happen in God's time it's only going to
[2:00:40] happen God's way it's only going to
[2:00:43] happen according to God's word that's
[2:00:45] all the only thing is we can recognize
[2:00:47] that it's the season this is the season
[2:00:50] of rapture this is the season of body
[2:00:52] change and you know what's going to
[2:00:54] happen
[2:00:55] brother banham says it's going to take
[2:00:57] more faith than any other age he says
[2:00:59] and I want you to get built up now in in
[2:01:01] this holy Oracles of God in a faith the
[2:01:04] faith of this hour not the faith of
[2:01:06] another hour the faith of this hour
[2:01:08] the faith it's going to take more faith
[2:01:12] than ever was in any age for this has to
[2:01:14] be rapturing Faith to be taken up and so
[2:01:18] we want you to believe tonight in all
[2:01:20] that you have seen heard word that you
[2:01:23] have heard preached the signs wonders
[2:01:26] you have seen done we want you to
[2:01:28] accumulate all that together in your
[2:01:31] heart and consider it whether if that be
[2:01:34] of God or not
[2:01:37] and you know looking at the message of
[2:01:38] the hour brothers and sisters I don't
[2:01:40] think it can be said any clearer than
[2:01:41] that take a look at the first and second
[2:01:43] polls of his ministry and the third poll
[2:01:45] is where they'll say well he went off on
[2:01:46] his Doctrine well what Doctrine did he
[2:01:48] go off on because he didn't follow the
[2:01:50] School of Theology Jesus never followed
[2:01:52] a School of Theology when he was here on
[2:01:54] Earth did any of his prophets follow a
[2:01:57] School of Theology when they were here
[2:01:59] on Earth
[2:02:00] none of them did
[2:02:01] so why would it be any different today
[2:02:05] take a look at the man of God who had a
[2:02:07] Healing Ministry a campaign that had
[2:02:10] many people impersonated and rise up
[2:02:13] afterwards and begin to activate that
[2:02:15] Faith but then as soon as the word
[2:02:17] started to come forward I and my father
[2:02:19] are one my goodness that was at a
[2:02:22] spiritual food and due season
[2:02:24] says the new birth Christ is a
[2:02:26] revelation God has revealed to you this
[2:02:28] great mystery and that's a new birth
[2:02:31] that's it there's a whole bunch more
[2:02:33] there I'm not going to read right now
[2:02:35] brother Branham he talks about that sort
[2:02:37] of Crisis the mystery of God revealed
[2:02:39] the new birth is Christ
[2:02:41] the new birth is not just Christ that
[2:02:43] died at Calvary and actually rose again
[2:02:46] and then is coming soon that's not the
[2:02:48] new birth brothers and sisters that was
[2:02:50] for a day
[2:02:51] but when that word came forth out of the
[2:02:53] Vindicated Prophet to say I no longer
[2:02:55] call you church I call you bride I
[2:02:57] personally my view which isn't worth
[2:02:59] much I believe that that's where that
[2:03:01] changed that was a pivotal moment where
[2:03:03] the
[2:03:04] Prophet said we're building a house now
[2:03:06] we're turning a corner and unless you're
[2:03:08] following the blueprint you're going to
[2:03:09] miss the turn you're going to keep
[2:03:10] building the wall you're going to be
[2:03:11] miles down this wall and recognize that
[2:03:13] people are over there way down there
[2:03:17] I thought it was interesting looking at
[2:03:19] the Matthew effect
[2:03:21] it's it's an interesting thought
[2:03:24] because you know what it boils down to
[2:03:26] one example they use in Wikipedia is
[2:03:28] that the rich get richer and the poor
[2:03:30] get poorer and that's what's going to
[2:03:31] happen brothers and sisters what's
[2:03:33] happening right now in our day the the
[2:03:35] spiritually Rich are getting richer and
[2:03:37] the spiritually poor getting poorer
[2:03:39] they're they're actually digressing
[2:03:41] they're going in different directions
[2:03:42] now and there's not much that we can do
[2:03:44] about it but he said he'd pour His
[2:03:46] Spirit out upon All Flesh and the flesh
[2:03:49] that is his spirit that is his his Gene
[2:03:52] his kin folk they're the ones that are
[2:03:53] going to actually rise up they're the
[2:03:55] one that are going to get more
[2:03:55] spiritually rich but those other ones
[2:03:57] they're going to get more and more
[2:03:58] spiritually poor they're going to maybe
[2:04:00] Prosper they'll have lots of money in
[2:04:01] their bank account they'll have good
[2:04:03] jobs and careers maybe great positions
[2:04:05] in the city we know that lot who was a
[2:04:07] penny in God's economy he became the
[2:04:10] mayor of Sodom we could have a really
[2:04:12] good position but that don't mean
[2:04:14] nothing
[2:04:15] that don't mean nothing where are we
[2:04:16] spiritually that's what counts
[2:04:21] we're going to take faith we need faith
[2:04:23] more faith than we've ever had out of
[2:04:25] any other age that's such a profound
[2:04:27] thought
[2:04:28] about him says this here he says now
[2:04:30] look I've said some pretty rough things
[2:04:32] about airplane automobile remember they
[2:04:35] are horsepower too all of it is
[2:04:37] horsepower the church is just moving up
[2:04:40] holy ghost power is the holy ghost that
[2:04:44] we're justified by
[2:04:46] it's not something that we do on our own
[2:04:48] he says you ministers know that don't
[2:04:49] you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us the
[2:04:52] Holy Ghost fills us the Holy Ghost gives
[2:04:56] us rapturing faith
[2:04:58] that's why brothers and sisters you hear
[2:05:00] me talk about it all the time and you
[2:05:02] will until this gets changed so the
[2:05:04] program shifts however God sees it fit
[2:05:06] I'm gonna say it we've got to get the
[2:05:08] Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy
[2:05:11] Ghost In Our Lives unless we get that
[2:05:13] we're not going to see the rapture
[2:05:16] he says we're moving up that was out of
[2:05:17] countdown
[2:05:22] I'm sorry Ed
[2:05:24] really got inspired I have a lot of
[2:05:26] notes and we have a couple minutes left
[2:05:29] here we okay
[2:05:31] I'll try not to keep us late
[2:05:34] I have a birthday party for my mom she
[2:05:36] turned 80 yesterday
[2:05:39] happy birthday Mom if you're watching
[2:05:42] you know in Isaiah 61
[2:05:46] my
[2:05:48] yeah hold
[2:05:50] Isaiah 61.
[2:05:52] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[2:05:55] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[2:05:57] preach Good Tidings unto the meek he
[2:05:59] hath sent me to bind up the
[2:06:00] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[2:06:02] captives
[2:06:03] and the opening of the prison to them
[2:06:06] that are bound
[2:06:08] this speaks of getting people to Calvary
[2:06:11] it doesn't speak to the Bride of Jesus
[2:06:14] Christ
[2:06:15] and you know it's verse two
[2:06:18] verse 2 is where we actually
[2:06:22] fall in verse two to proclaim the
[2:06:25] acceptable year of the Lord
[2:06:27] and the day of Vengeance of our God to
[2:06:30] comfort all that mourn and we know that
[2:06:32] this scripture is what Jesus went and
[2:06:35] sat down in the temple one day and he
[2:06:38] said to them he only read the first half
[2:06:40] of this though verse 2 to proclaim the
[2:06:42] acceptable year of the Lord
[2:06:44] and he closed the book and he sat down
[2:06:46] and he looked at them and they had their
[2:06:49] eyes fastened on him and he said this
[2:06:51] day this scripture is fulfilled
[2:06:54] in your eyes
[2:06:56] and they had no idea what he talked
[2:06:58] about and in 1965 if you listen to the
[2:07:01] message birth pains brother Branham he
[2:07:04] actually encountered a situation where
[2:07:06] he was given a new Bible and in this
[2:07:09] Bible the page is stuck together and he
[2:07:11] had an issue trying to find the
[2:07:13] scripture that he was after and and we
[2:07:15] know that in this message what happened
[2:07:18] was a priest with all his robes and
[2:07:22] gowns on was sitting there on the
[2:07:24] platform he said Hold Steady God is
[2:07:27] fixing to move take my Bible and read
[2:07:29] from my Bible and we know that this is
[2:07:32] exactly what happened when Jesus went
[2:07:34] into the temple and the priest delivered
[2:07:36] the Bible unto him the Scrolls that he
[2:07:38] might read from it to them they wanted
[2:07:40] to hear what he had to say and the same
[2:07:43] thing happened in our day in our
[2:07:45] generation a priest handed the Bible to
[2:07:49] the prophet and the prophet said to them
[2:07:51] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[2:07:55] your ears he says at 6 15 times in this
[2:07:57] message this day the scripture is
[2:07:59] fulfilled I've got some quotes from it
[2:08:01] I'm just going to go for it and we'll
[2:08:03] try and wrap it up quick here brother
[2:08:05] Bradham says how could he stand her that
[2:08:07] day and say this day this scripture is
[2:08:09] fulfilled right before your eyes how
[2:08:10] outstanding how so plainly and yet those
[2:08:13] people misunderstood
[2:08:16] he says why it's because they took the
[2:08:19] interpretation of some order of priests
[2:08:22] that they were listening to I want to
[2:08:24] say it this way brothers and sisters if
[2:08:26] we're not careful we can do that with
[2:08:27] the word of God for our day and we will
[2:08:30] not bear forth the fruit that is going
[2:08:33] to glorify our heavenly father if we do
[2:08:35] that
[2:08:37] paragraph 87 the word had said that he
[2:08:40] would come just the way he come and
[2:08:43] there he stood reading the word and
[2:08:45] saying to them this day this scripture
[2:08:47] is fulfilled in your eyes and still they
[2:08:51] failed to see him or recognize him like
[2:08:53] they did in all other ages 118 and about
[2:08:57] that time the Holy Ghost fell on his
[2:09:00] sister setting out there in the meeting
[2:09:02] and she raised up speaking in unknown
[2:09:04] tongues and gave the interpretation of
[2:09:07] the very thing that the priest and I
[2:09:10] were talking about on the platform
[2:09:12] the whole church the whole place went
[2:09:15] into a roar he says carried on over into
[2:09:19] Oral Roberts convention last week or a
[2:09:22] week before last and was the talk of the
[2:09:24] convention
[2:09:28] I just think it's beautiful to say that
[2:09:31] to recognize that because people would
[2:09:33] say well look at Oral Roberts and and
[2:09:35] Billy Graham and how they set the stage
[2:09:36] and how they did everything and and
[2:09:38] William Branham he was just a little
[2:09:40] Pebble on the beach actually they were
[2:09:42] following his lead that's what happened
[2:09:44] here they were following the prophet for
[2:09:47] our day
[2:09:48] he says how did the priest setting under
[2:09:50] the Holy Spirit revealed out there
[2:09:51] through a woman his sister I believe it
[2:09:54] was of that I was taking place up there
[2:09:57] on the platform and revealed that thing
[2:09:59] that we were hiding the hour that we're
[2:10:02] living this day this scripture is
[2:10:05] fulfilled this day the evening lights
[2:10:08] have come and we fail to see it notice
[2:10:13] 154 when I was baptizing my 17th person
[2:10:16] under this witness and you know the rest
[2:10:19] of the story and when I was standing
[2:10:21] there baptizing the 17th person a light
[2:10:23] come down from heaven shining down above
[2:10:26] there like a star falling from the
[2:10:28] heaven a voice said as John the Baptist
[2:10:31] was sent to forer on the first coming of
[2:10:32] Christ your message shall forerun the
[2:10:35] second coming
[2:10:37] into all the world
[2:10:39] it's beautiful to think that this is
[2:10:41] what the prophet of God was saying I
[2:10:43] just have to read this little last
[2:10:45] little bit again as John the Baptist was
[2:10:47] sent to forerun the first coming of
[2:10:49] Christ your message shall forerun his
[2:10:52] second coming into all the world this is
[2:10:54] what the prophet of God says this day
[2:10:57] this scripture is fulfilled
[2:11:01] John the Baptist the Forerunner
[2:11:04] we know that it's Elijah the anointing
[2:11:06] I'll call the musicians or I won't stop
[2:11:09] 165 and he said the Seven Seals of the
[2:11:12] Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible
[2:11:14] will be opened
[2:11:16] and fulfill Revelations 10. that in the
[2:11:19] seventh Angel's message these things
[2:11:22] should come to pass
[2:11:25] this day this scripture before our eyes
[2:11:28] is this day this scripture is fulfilled
[2:11:32] he says
[2:11:34] I don't know how you can actually come
[2:11:35] up with maybe six seals being open and
[2:11:37] not the seventh when you have the
[2:11:39] progressive revelation like he taught
[2:11:41] 1965 here he is saying the Seven Seals
[2:11:45] of the Hidden Mysteries of the entire
[2:11:47] Bible will be opened and this day this
[2:11:49] scripture is fulfilled
[2:11:53] 170 the prophet said there will come a
[2:11:55] day that Shall be Called neither day or
[2:11:57] night a dismal day
[2:11:58] a lot of rain and fog just enough to
[2:12:01] know how to join church or put your name
[2:12:03] on a book
[2:12:05] but it shall be light about the evening
[2:12:07] time
[2:12:08] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[2:12:11] and what brings it day brothers and
[2:12:13] sisters is the word the word manifested
[2:12:15] in our day people say an amen to the
[2:12:17] word people living that word people
[2:12:19] pressing on people having the desire to
[2:12:22] come out and actually put their shoulder
[2:12:24] to the wheel to say Amen to the word
[2:12:26] because as you eat the book you become
[2:12:29] the book
[2:12:32] 237 is there a man on Earth has got
[2:12:34] repentance so preached so plainly as
[2:12:36] Billy Graham maybe stand with me as we
[2:12:39] close
[2:12:41] has there been a man that has had an
[2:12:44] effect on the people like Billy Graham
[2:12:47] never has there been internationally a
[2:12:50] man
[2:12:52] Oh Billy Sunday and so forth was here in
[2:12:56] the United States
[2:12:58] but Billy Graham is known all over the
[2:13:00] world worldwide
[2:13:01] see where he's calling out of Sodom
[2:13:05] and he's got his accompanying party
[2:13:07] there with the Pentecostal church and
[2:13:09] Oral Roberts
[2:13:11] but what about the elect group
[2:13:14] this is where it gets good what kind of
[2:13:16] a sign are they supposed to see what are
[2:13:19] they supposed to have
[2:13:21] Hallelujah
[2:13:23] it shall be light in the evening time
[2:13:25] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[2:13:30] this day God's promise is fulfilled we
[2:13:32] know that to be the truth he is here
[2:13:35] tonight as he was then
[2:13:38] 240 now to preach it that I said a while
[2:13:41] ago if you preach anything and it's the
[2:13:43] gospel truth then God is obligated to
[2:13:45] vindicate that it's is that true now if
[2:13:49] that be so let God let the god that
[2:13:51] wrote the word let the god that made the
[2:13:53] prophecy let the God who is the god of
[2:13:56] the world come forth and prove that he
[2:13:59] is still God
[2:14:01] and here we are brothers and sisters
[2:14:04] this many years down the road we had the
[2:14:07] prophet standing and declaring this day
[2:14:09] this scripture is fulfilled and it's the
[2:14:12] same for us now we have the ability to
[2:14:15] accept the entire word for our day and
[2:14:17] all we have to do is say Amen to it not
[2:14:19] try and Hyper analyze it not try and
[2:14:21] make it say something it doesn't just
[2:14:23] simply eat the word eat the book the way
[2:14:25] that he's given it to us and it shall be
[2:14:28] light in the evening time and that light
[2:14:30] brothers and sisters is truly his word
[2:14:32] his life living out through you and that
[2:14:35] is how the father is glorified by you
[2:14:37] being the manifested word for our day
[2:14:41] let's just bow in prayer gracious
[2:14:43] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[2:14:45] goodness Lord thank you for your word
[2:14:47] your Vindicated word Lord thank you that
[2:14:50] we have the ability to recognize it Lord
[2:14:52] Jesus father that there's not some great
[2:14:55] fantastic there's not some fanatical
[2:14:57] rather there's just you
[2:15:00] and we know that you are your word and
[2:15:02] and so many people are looking for some
[2:15:04] kind of a physical manifestation but
[2:15:07] they're they're looking earnestly Lord
[2:15:09] for you and they're looking for
[2:15:10] something different than what they
[2:15:12] should be looking for because they don't
[2:15:13] recognize the scriptures the scriptures
[2:15:16] say that there will be a coming of the
[2:15:19] Lord but it will be a word coming it
[2:15:21] will be the bride coming of the Lord is
[2:15:23] what your Prophet taught and father we
[2:15:25] are standing here to declare that we
[2:15:28] accept that word the way that you've
[2:15:29] given it father and Lord we just say be
[2:15:32] it unto us according to your word so
[2:15:34] that we can be that light so that we can
[2:15:36] be the light to this Dying World father
[2:15:41] Lord I pray that you would just bless
[2:15:42] the words that were spoken that you
[2:15:44] would just keep your hand upon us as we
[2:15:46] go our separate ways
[2:15:47] father that you would just help us Lord
[2:15:49] to recognize our position in you and
[2:15:51] father if there's someone that we could
[2:15:53] Minister through the testimony that we
[2:15:56] have in our lives Lord knowing that
[2:15:58] rahab's testimony was her life father we
[2:16:01] all have a testimony sometimes we don't
[2:16:04] have to be a preacher we can just go and
[2:16:05] and tell how it got lit and father see
[2:16:09] people's lives get changed Lord we just
[2:16:11] asked that you would give us the ability
[2:16:13] to evangelize in this end time father
