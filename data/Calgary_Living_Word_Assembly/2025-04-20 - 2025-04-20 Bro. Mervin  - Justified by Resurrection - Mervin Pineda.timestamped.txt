[39:57] oh Lord Jesus, that we we can claim it,
[40:00] oh Lord, because it's your promise and
[40:02] you have said in your word. All this we
[40:05] ask in the mighty name of Jesus Christ's
[40:07] name we pray. Amen. You may be seated.
[40:10] Thank you.
[40:12] Amen. Amen. Just want to welcome brother
[40:15] Paul and sister Elaine and yes the
[40:18] pleasants and uh we have so many uh not
[40:22] so many uh we call them visitors but I
[40:24] believe they are not visitors anymore.
[40:26] Amen. Uh sister Ne. Amen. Amen. Uh and I
[40:32] don't think we have other visitors here.
[40:34] Yeah. So Amen.
[40:37] So we are in Easter week maybe the
[40:40] second week of the resurrection. But
[40:42] then the thing is like I've said the
[40:44] meaning of Easter is uh the resurrection
[40:47] of Jesus Christ. Amen. That's the
[40:49] central meaning of Easter which is the
[40:52] resurrection of Jesus and it took place
[40:55] uh on the third day of his resurrection.
[40:57] Amen. And uh we will uh tackle about it.
[41:01] You can see John
[41:03] 14:19. Amen. Uh I will go back and forth
[41:07] here. Yet a little while and the world
[41:10] sit me no more. But ye see me, ye see me
[41:14] or you see me in the in plural tense.
[41:17] Because I live, you shall live also. You
[41:19] can see the the out my the outline of my
[41:22] sermon is uh justified by the
[41:24] resurrection. Justified if we will
[41:26] define it. Amen. It's righteousness
[41:31] being righteous. You are made righteous.
[41:33] But then in in some uh in some
[41:37] definitions, why did he justify you? Why
[41:40] did he made you righteous? Or why did he
[41:43] make you righteous? Because he owns you.
[41:47] You are owned by him. Amen. That
[41:50] therefore he justified you. He made you
[41:53] righteous. Amen. Being
[41:56] married, right? Being a man, you must be
[42:01] ready to die for your wife. Amen. Amen.
[42:04] Otherwise, your marriage is in vain.
[42:06] That's right. Amen. Amen. Amen. Because
[42:09] he did that for us. Jesus Christ gave
[42:12] his life for us because he loved us.
[42:15] Amen. Amen. In the natural, it must be
[42:18] the same. If a husband is not ready to
[42:20] die for his wife, I don't think that's a
[42:22] good marriage to be. Amen. To be in.
[42:25] Amen.
[42:26] So, how did he do that? The first thing
[42:28] is this is the plan of redemption even
[42:32] before the foundation of the world.
[42:34] Amen. Amen. Uh I know I put a lot of
[42:37] slides there but then I will call uh
[42:40] call the scripture here and there
[42:42] brother if you can prepare. Revelations
[42:45] 138. Amen. Uh I think I will just ask
[42:49] you so that uh I don't disturb myself
[42:52] with with uh with different notes uh
[42:56] because uh you see 1200 plus messages to
[43:01] unload it in one hour is not easy.
[43:05] Amen. That's why I I I feel brother
[43:08] Emanuel. He had only one and a half hour
[43:11] and I will have one hour message of one
[43:14] hour, right? Message of the hour. We
[43:15] will try because it's Wednesday, right?
[43:18] But then the thing is let's talk about
[43:20] the importance of this resurrection.
[43:22] Amen. Justification by resurrection. It
[43:26] is as uh barberry preached, right? It's
[43:31] uh it is before the foundation of the
[43:34] world. We are already in his mind,
[43:36] right? We were part of him even before
[43:39] the foundation of the world. Revelations
[43:41] 13:18, "And all that dwell upon the
[43:44] earth shall worship him whose names are
[43:47] not written in the book of life of the
[43:50] lamb's lame from the foundation of the
[43:52] world." And in Ephesians
[43:55] 1:4-5, according I'll uh I hope you he
[44:00] he he can cope up with me. Ephesians
[44:03] 14:5 because we're talking about
[44:05] predestination and adoption. Amen.
[44:07] according as he had hath chosen us in
[44:10] him before the foundation of the world
[44:13] that we should be holy and without blame
[44:16] before him in love having predestinated
[44:20] us unto the adoption of children by
[44:22] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[44:25] good pleasure of his will. So you can
[44:27] see even before the foundation of the
[44:30] world we are already in his mind. Amen.
[44:33] And in 1 Peter
[44:36] 1:20, it's so important to understand
[44:38] this uh principles, brothers and
[44:40] sisters, so that we won't be lost and
[44:42] then we can be at rest. We don't need to
[44:45] worry at all. Amen. When when we
[44:46] understand uh uh the principles of uh
[44:49] principles of this redemption. Amen.
[44:52] Redemption even before the foundation of
[44:54] the world. 1 Peter 1:20, who verily was
[44:59] for ordained before the foundation of
[45:02] the world, but was manifest in this last
[45:05] times. For whom? For you and me. So
[45:10] manifestation declaration at this time.
[45:14] Amen. You can see God foresaw this fall.
[45:18] Amen. And the lamb was already slain in
[45:21] his plan before the world began. So
[45:24] Easter was not an
[45:28] accident. It was the unveiling of divine
[45:32] of his divine purpose. And what's that
[45:34] divine purpose? Christ was our redeeming
[45:37] redeemer long before we were born. And
[45:40] uh as brother Brandham taught uh because
[45:43] I live, you shall live also. Amen. And
[45:47] this resurrection was already finished
[45:49] in God's thoughts before time. So you
[45:52] can see resurrection even he was not yet
[45:55] dead right be but he's already made
[45:58] alive because he already provided that
[46:01] sacrifice. Amen. Even before the lamb
[46:04] slain before the foundation of the
[46:05] world. Amen. So so we can see that that
[46:09] uh bear with me here that
[46:14] cross. Amen. the cross, the
[46:18] death. You you can go to page uh six,
[46:21] brother. So I I already shared this to
[46:24] you before. Uh the cross of
[46:27] Calvary, there is a meaning in
[46:33] there. Man was
[46:36] separated from God. Why? Because of sin.
[46:41] But then because of the cross, the
[46:44] second
[46:45] page, the next page, he was the bridge
[46:49] so that we can go to God. Amen. So I
[46:52] know uh these are very basic, but then
[46:56] visually we can remember we are always
[46:59] separated from God because of what?
[47:01] Because of the fall, because of sin. And
[47:04] it's only through that cross that we can
[47:06] cross and go back to God. Amen. Not
[47:08] saying that God is different from Jesus
[47:10] Christ. God became flesh. Amen. So that
[47:14] because he's a spirit. Amen. He's a
[47:16] fountain of spirit and he cannot die in
[47:18] spirit form. So that's why he came to a
[47:20] to his flesh. He became man. Amen. He
[47:24] became flesh and dwelt among us. Amen.
[47:26] And by his death on the cross, we are
[47:29] able to cross now bridge. He's the
[47:32] bridge, right? He's the uh he's standing
[47:34] on the go for us, man. so that we can go
[47:37] back to God. Amen. Isn't that beautiful?
[47:40] That's the payment for sin, brothers and
[47:42] sisters. Amen. And in Isaiah 53:5, I'm
[47:46] not preaching different things. I'm just
[47:48] reminding ourselves, right? It's a
[47:50] Wednesday. I know uh it will be a little
[47:52] bit of a basic mid and maybe up to
[47:56] master and doctorate. Let's see if uh if
[47:58] we can go even deeper because we're one
[48:00] room schoolhouse. Amen. I Isaiah 53:5.
[48:02] So that we will be reminded. Amen.
[48:05] Right. Because like tonight there there
[48:07] are sickness. This is in the body.
[48:10] Sickness in the body. But we are being
[48:12] reminded that by stripes we are healed.
[48:16] Isaiah
[48:17] 53:5. But let's be reminded brothers and
[48:20] sisters. I hope it's okay to read
[48:22] scriptures and and some quotes. Amen.
[48:24] But he was wounded for our
[48:27] transgression. What is transgression?
[48:29] Our sins. He became sin so that we will
[48:33] become God's righteousness. Amen. You
[48:37] can see that. Oh yeah, it's not there.
[48:39] But uh you can see that he brided the
[48:40] gap. He became sin for us so that we in
[48:44] in the sight of God, he will always see
[48:47] Jesus Christ being righteous right on
[48:50] ourstead. Amen. But he was wounded for
[48:53] our transgression. He was bruised for
[48:55] our iniquities. The chastisement of our
[48:58] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[49:01] we are healed. Past tense. Amen. And
[49:05] John 19:30. Brother, I know it it will
[49:09] be a little bit of a study and a little
[49:11] bit of preaching, but then I hope it's
[49:13] okay. Amen. Uh we won't be uh afraid to
[49:17] to read the scriptures. Amen. Because
[49:19] this is life. The scriptures is the
[49:22] word. Amen. and the word. If you think
[49:24] about the book of redemption, what did
[49:27] John see? He saw his name. Meaning,
[49:31] because we are part of the word, right?
[49:33] We can see our name written in that book
[49:36] of life, lamb's book of life. Amen. And
[49:39] and therefore, the book of redemption,
[49:40] you can see it composed of our names
[49:44] which which we are part of that word
[49:46] because it's the word written, right?
[49:48] But then the word that you can see there
[49:50] are names. you and me. Amen. That's why
[49:54] book of redemption, lamb's book of life,
[49:57] they are called different things, but
[49:59] then they mean the same. And for us, the
[50:01] bride, we're so thankful because our
[50:04] names are written in that book.
[50:06] Amen. And why were they written? They
[50:10] were written even before the foundation
[50:12] of the world. Amen. A and if you can see
[50:15] in in Revelations
[50:18] 10:8-11 he was asked John the type of
[50:22] the bribe was asked to take the book
[50:25] right revelations 10:1-7 is for bar
[50:28] branam and Jesus Christ amen because
[50:30] he's the we know revelations 10:7 uh is
[50:34] the seventh angel messenger but 8 to11
[50:37] is for the bride John was asked take to
[50:41] take the book right when you take the
[50:44] book and then eat it, right? But then no
[50:49] one is worthy to take that book.
[50:51] Remember in Revelations 5, no one is
[50:54] even uh uh is even worthy to take that
[50:58] book because it's a it's a it's a closed
[51:02] book in Revelations 5, but in
[51:03] Revelations 10, it's open. Now, when it
[51:06] was opened, it's the voice that asked,
[51:08] "Take it and eat
[51:11] it." But who made the uh who made Jan to
[51:15] be worthy to take that book. It's the
[51:17] voice that that uh that asked him to
[51:21] take the book. Right? So that voice we
[51:25] know the shout is the message of the
[51:27] hour. The voice is I it's the it's the
[51:31] voice of the resurrection and the trump
[51:33] it's the one that we are waiting which
[51:35] is the which is the rapture. Amen. Which
[51:37] is the meeting in the air. That's the
[51:39] only thing that we don't know right now.
[51:41] It's the actual time when we will be
[51:44] raptured. But it will happen. Amen.
[51:46] Because the shout is the message. The
[51:48] voice is the voice of the resurrection
[51:51] which is also living in you and me right
[51:53] now. That's why
[51:55] we that's why the the the responsibility
[51:59] in the bride is is deep. It's uh very
[52:02] heavy. Uh we will we'll talk about that
[52:04] later if we can. Right. uh that's why we
[52:08] are able to impart eternal life to those
[52:10] who we will be meeting. Amen. So John
[52:15] 19:30 you can see this is the payment
[52:18] for sin. I'm I'm on the second uh
[52:22] outline here why why he needs to be
[52:25] resurrected. Amen. When Jesus therefore
[52:27] had received the vinegar, he
[52:30] said, "It is finished." And he bowed his
[52:33] head and gave up the ghost. So it is
[52:36] finished means that's the finishing of
[52:38] his uh of what is uh
[52:41] prophesied that he will die for for for
[52:44] the sinners. Amen. And in Romans
[52:48] 6:223 it's for
[52:52] us Romans
[52:55] 6:223. But now be now now right this is
[53:00] the date being made free from sin. Who
[53:03] who is free from sin right now? Ask.
[53:06] Amen. And become servants to
[53:09] God. Ye have your fruit unto
[53:13] holiness and the
[53:15] end everlasting life or eternal life.
[53:20] For the wages of sin is
[53:24] death. But it it didn't end
[53:27] there. I hope we can read it. But the
[53:30] gift of God is eternal life. How?
[53:32] through Jesus Christ our Lord. So you
[53:34] can see brothers and sisters the payment
[53:37] for sin. Amen. Brother Vanham said the
[53:42] crucifixion the crucifixion on the cross
[53:45] was the full payment for sin. But then
[53:48] it didn't end there. The wrath of God
[53:51] was satisfied. Amen. But the
[53:54] resurrection, Amen. Crucifixion is the
[53:57] payment. But the resurrection was the
[54:00] receipt receipt of that payment. Amen.
[54:04] Calvary finish it. Easter confirms it.
[54:07] Aren't you thankful, brothers and
[54:08] sisters? When you pay something, you you
[54:11] will receive a receipt, right? And if it
[54:13] is sealed, that is paid. Why worry? It's
[54:18] already fully paid. Amen. How? By his
[54:21] death. Amen. He died for our sins.
[54:27] If if we if we can just understand that
[54:29] we we will really cry because the thing
[54:31] is uh he loved us so much that he gave
[54:34] his life for us. Amen. And you can see
[54:37] those who who believe his message, the
[54:39] apostles, they are the ones who who
[54:42] first died for him, right?
[54:44] They're mostly martyed except for John
[54:48] who was tried to be martyed but was
[54:50] boiled, you know, until he's supposed to
[54:53] die but he didn't die. He died of
[54:56] uh uh old age but if you if you check
[54:59] how do how how these apostles died
[55:02] brothers and sisters you you
[55:03] won't you won't think that wow can I do
[55:07] that and even the prophets of old like
[55:10] Isaiah I think he was a sander cut into
[55:13] two you know inverted right uh you know
[55:17] uh tied upside down and then he was uh
[55:19] he was sown as into two his body was
[55:24] split into two by So, oh it's it's
[55:27] brutal when we can check that thing.
[55:31] These are Christians, brothers and sist
[55:33] brothers and sisters. And for us right
[55:35] now, we are here living in Canada.
[55:37] Everything is free, right? You have
[55:39] carbon rebate. You have all this you all
[55:43] all these handouts and everything,
[55:47] right? We should we should reflect on
[55:49] this because Easter is not a memorial.
[55:52] It's not uh a day to just remember that
[55:55] he resurrected. It's alive, brothers and
[55:57] sisters. Like brother Emanuel was uh
[55:59] preaching last Sunday. It's life. His
[56:02] his death, burial, and resurrection will
[56:06] not mean anything if uh if uh if he
[56:09] didn't resurrect, right? Uh that's why
[56:12] for us, we believe that he resurrected
[56:14] otherwise uh all the prophecies in the
[56:17] Bible will be in vain. And we're so
[56:19] thankful that uh we are part of him even
[56:22] while he is on the cross. Remember
[56:26] scripturally it is said we are his
[56:29] bones. We are his flesh. So when he died
[56:32] on Calvary we are with him. But then
[56:35] when he resurrected we are also with
[56:37] him. We rose with him. Therefore we're
[56:39] part of him. Brothers and sisters. Why
[56:41] worry now if we are part of him? A spoon
[56:44] or or an ocean has all the elements in
[56:48] it. But you are a let's say you're just
[56:50] a spoon of that ocean. So whatever
[56:52] content in that whole thing, you are
[56:55] part of it. So that's why the bride is
[56:57] many member body, right? There's no
[56:59] there's no big eyes and little use. We
[57:02] are all required in the economy of God.
[57:05] Amen. And that's why the payment for sin
[57:09] is uh uh g I mean the the the
[57:12] crucifixion is the payment for sin but
[57:15] the resurrection is the receipt that the
[57:18] price has been paid that God already
[57:21] that God himself accepted that
[57:23] sacrifice. Amen. Therefore when we sin
[57:27] we know we're not the one sinning.
[57:29] Right? It's this flesh that's sinning
[57:31] and the spirit that's sinning, but the
[57:32] soul in us because we are part of God,
[57:35] we don't sin. Amen.
[57:38] Oh, so we we talk about our uh
[57:42] justification uh uh justified by
[57:45] resurrection. It's the justification of
[57:47] believers. Amen. And Romans
[57:50] 4:25, you can see, you can see here, who
[57:54] was
[57:55] delivered for our
[57:57] offenses and was raised again for our
[58:01] justification. Justification, like what
[58:04] we mentioned a while ago, justification
[58:06] is we we being made righteous in his
[58:09] sight. Amen. We are being owned by him
[58:12] fully. That's the reason why he
[58:13] justified us. Amen. And Romans 8:11,
[58:17] it's very, we always sing this. But if
[58:19] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[58:23] from the dead dwell in you, he that
[58:26] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[58:28] also quicken your mortal bodies by
[58:31] spirit that dwelleth in you. Amen. So
[58:34] what what kind of
[58:37] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead?
[58:40] It's God God's spirit himself is the
[58:43] father. And that spirit will be the same
[58:47] that will dwell in us. Amen. That's
[58:50] why it's in the scripture. Whether we
[58:52] live, whether we die, we are Christ. So
[58:55] we don't need to worry. Brother Branham
[58:57] is saying whatever you do to this flesh,
[59:00] it doesn't matter whether you burn it,
[59:03] you you know you you torture
[59:06] it, whatever you do, it doesn't matter
[59:10] because there will be a resurrection.
[59:12] Amen. That's and and and even tonight we
[59:16] have uh we have a lot of sickness that
[59:19] are being requested uh for healing right
[59:22] because this body is is corruptible
[59:25] that's the reason why we need a body
[59:27] change amen because this one is not uh
[59:30] is not intended to uh to be like this
[59:33] but because of the fall it everything
[59:36] died because of the fall but then God
[59:38] already before the foundation of the
[59:41] world on But his thought is he wanted to
[59:44] be a healer. He wanted to be a savior,
[59:46] right? He wanted to be God basically,
[59:50] right? So all all those attributes even
[59:52] before the foundation of the world, they
[59:54] are already in his mind. That's the
[59:57] reason why uh they happened and he
[1:00:00] allowed it, right? So that we can
[1:00:04] declare those attributes. He can declare
[1:00:06] those attributes. And
[1:00:08] now the
[1:00:10] bride because
[1:00:12] uh when Jesus was uh on the cross, we
[1:00:16] were not there 2,000 years ago. Right?
[1:00:21] But then the thing is why h how how can
[1:00:25] how how would we know that we are in
[1:00:27] him? Because the word said so because we
[1:00:30] are part of him. Amen. So, so now that
[1:00:34] that uh that debt on Calvary, it's a
[1:00:37] bleeding word.
[1:00:39] Amen. Many are are preaching that the
[1:00:42] the mercy seat is
[1:00:44] over, right? But then you cannot see
[1:00:48] that in the message because mercy
[1:00:52] still is still effective right now and
[1:00:55] it's in the heart of man right now. The
[1:00:58] mercy seat is in the heart of man.
[1:01:00] That's why when when when we see other
[1:01:02] people that don't believe this message
[1:01:04] yet, we have the ability or we have the
[1:01:07] power to impart eternal life because we
[1:01:10] have that eternal life. Amen. And and
[1:01:13] and for us knowing who we are, right?
[1:01:17] The bride of Jesus Christ that uh that
[1:01:21] gave everything for us. You can see his
[1:01:24] promise is like a it's like uh it's more
[1:01:28] gas board or uh or or a buffet. Amen.
[1:01:32] It's like the gifts of God were were
[1:01:35] poured into us but the only thing that
[1:01:37] he has is uh we have to take it
[1:01:39] ourselves. If you are in a buffet uh all
[1:01:43] you can eat
[1:01:44] restaurant maybe they will serve you
[1:01:46] drinks only, right? But but most of the
[1:01:49] time you have to take your own.
[1:01:50] Everything is before you. Amen. Take
[1:01:53] what you need. Take what you want. You
[1:01:56] have to take it yourselves. Amen. It's
[1:01:58] not It's not a handout. Amen. We There's
[1:02:01] no lazy Christian. Amen. Spiritually,
[1:02:04] that's why we have to drive. We have to
[1:02:06] We have to uh sacrifice. We have to uh
[1:02:09] pray. We have to eat the word. Amen.
[1:02:11] It's important for
[1:02:13] us. I know it's a it's a curse in North
[1:02:16] America that we we have almost
[1:02:18] everything. That's why uh that's why
[1:02:21] most people they they they're just
[1:02:23] waiting for their
[1:02:24] handouts. Amen. But for us, we're
[1:02:27] Christians. We know that we have to pro
[1:02:29] provide for our family. We don't rely on
[1:02:32] the government to give us all these
[1:02:33] handouts. We we drive and work. Amen.
[1:02:36] And and it's this the same spiritually.
[1:02:39] We have to feed on the word and pray
[1:02:41] every time. Amen. So 1 Corinthians
[1:02:48] 15:2-22, you can see this is uh this is
[1:02:51] the justification of believers.
[1:02:54] Amen. And I'm so glad that uh we have
[1:02:57] this uh message of the hour which is uh
[1:03:00] which is the declaration of of the word
[1:03:04] in our day. Amen. It's the but but how
[1:03:08] sometimes we are being asked how how
[1:03:10] would you know that uh this is the
[1:03:11] truth?
[1:03:13] You know, because it's it's a written
[1:03:16] word, right? It's also a spoken word.
[1:03:19] But is it manifested unto
[1:03:22] you? That's the that's the main
[1:03:25] question, right? Because uh you can ask
[1:03:28] uh oh you you are blessed. That's why
[1:03:31] you uh that's why you can say that. But
[1:03:34] then the thing is before being
[1:03:36] blessed you you can see that uh uh you
[1:03:40] know you you went through trials
[1:03:42] sufferings afflictions we we still do
[1:03:46] but then the thing is the manifest the
[1:03:48] manifestation of the life of Christ in
[1:03:50] us it will show it's the change in us
[1:03:53] basically right if if we can think of uh
[1:03:56] it is the rising of the sun that g there
[1:03:58] is uh uh when you have the spirit that
[1:04:02] uh case Christ Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:04:05] in you. It will quicken your mortal
[1:04:06] body. Meaning also is it will change
[1:04:09] your mindset. Everything that you think
[1:04:12] before that are worldly will will will
[1:04:14] come out will be replaced by by that
[1:04:16] spirit because the Holy Spirit will will
[1:04:19] tell you oh you don't want to do all
[1:04:21] these worldly things. Amen. We're in
[1:04:23] progress. We know that not everyone is
[1:04:26] uh uh you know in in that stage already.
[1:04:30] But uh we are trying our best. That's
[1:04:31] the reason why we are here. There's a
[1:04:34] purpose why we have the five-fold
[1:04:35] ministry so that we can be reminded
[1:04:37] although it's there. We can read but
[1:04:40] then the thing is uh are we living
[1:04:42] according to it? Right? Amen. So so 1
[1:04:48] Corinthians 15:20-22 but now is Christ
[1:04:52] risen from the
[1:04:54] dead and become the first fruits of them
[1:04:58] that slept.
[1:05:00] For since by man came came death, by man
[1:05:04] came also the resurrection of the dead.
[1:05:07] For as in Adam all die, even so in
[1:05:11] Christ shall all be made alive. Is this
[1:05:15] is condemnation by representation but
[1:05:20] justification. Amen. Also by one person.
[1:05:23] Amen. And you can see
[1:05:25] uh one person condem uh made the whole
[1:05:30] whole uh whole uh world to be condemned
[1:05:35] right that is in Adam and and Eve of
[1:05:38] course right uh but then by the death of
[1:05:41] Jesus Christ we are justified we were
[1:05:45] made righteous because of that debt so
[1:05:47] it you see that substitution is very
[1:05:50] important right we don't even need to do
[1:05:54] ourselves. It's Jesus Christ himself who
[1:05:57] did it for us. The only thing that we
[1:05:59] need to do is to accept it. Accept the
[1:06:01] sacrifice. Amen. We know we believe it.
[1:06:04] We believe the message of the hour
[1:06:05] because we know the the the the original
[1:06:07] sin is unbelief in the word of God. But
[1:06:09] it didn't stop there. You have to accept
[1:06:11] the sacrifice and live according to the
[1:06:14] word. Amen. So it's important he was
[1:06:17] raised rise or resurrected to justify
[1:06:21] us. Amen. His resurrection declared that
[1:06:25] the payment was
[1:06:27] accepted. Now no more
[1:06:30] condemnation. There is not therefore now
[1:06:33] no condemnations. Revel uh Romans 8. You
[1:06:36] can see Revelation 7 uh Romans 7 it's
[1:06:39] about the flesh man. But then uh Romans
[1:06:43] 8 because it's like a new heaven and new
[1:06:46] earth. Right after the seventh day 8
[1:06:48] you'll be in eternity. Amen. There's a
[1:06:51] there there is a significance there in
[1:06:53] Romans 7. By the flesh, it's a
[1:06:55] completion. But then 8 is eternity.
[1:06:59] Amen. That that's why there's therefore
[1:07:02] now no
[1:07:04] condemnation for them who are in Christ
[1:07:06] Jesus. Amen. Revelations 8, brothers and
[1:07:08] sisters, I love it. If you if you will
[1:07:11] read the whole chapter, Amen. whom we
[1:07:14] did
[1:07:15] forno. Amen.
[1:07:18] He just he
[1:07:20] predestinate. Amen. Whom he
[1:07:23] predestinate them he
[1:07:26] called them he called he justified them
[1:07:29] he justified he glorified it means there
[1:07:32] is a hope brothers and sisters it's a
[1:07:35] it's it's a promise why why do we depend
[1:07:38] on the promise because it's in the word
[1:07:40] we can say what's the
[1:07:42] absolute we we believe that the word is
[1:07:45] the absolute amen of God which is the
[1:07:48] Bible is the absolute and the message of
[1:07:51] the hour points us to the absolute
[1:07:54] always and the the absolute which is
[1:07:58] Jesus Christ himself which is the word
[1:08:01] which is the Holy Spirit which is the
[1:08:02] father son holy ghost everything it's in
[1:08:05] the message of the
[1:08:07] hour you know what I'm saying so what
[1:08:10] what I'm trying to point
[1:08:11] is the absolute is Jesus Christ himself
[1:08:15] which is the word and the message of the
[1:08:18] hour which is your uh you can say I
[1:08:22] already explained this it's just like
[1:08:24] binocular it's just like your compass uh
[1:08:27] pointing to the north star pointing to
[1:08:29] to the right direction he will point us
[1:08:32] to the absolute that's why putting this
[1:08:34] together when you when you check the
[1:08:36] message of the hour it's actually
[1:08:38] talking about the word of god completely
[1:08:41] the fullness of the word amen and uh if
[1:08:44] if if I will I will uh give a a formula
[1:08:49] also the mechanics which is the word
[1:08:53] plus the dynamics which is the Holy
[1:08:56] Spirit will equal
[1:08:59] life. So what I'm saying is if you have
[1:09:03] the word but you don't have the Holy
[1:09:05] Spirit it's not complete. It's only 50%.
[1:09:08] So you don't have the full life the life
[1:09:11] of Christ right? If you don't have the
[1:09:13] word but you have the spirit holy spirit
[1:09:16] it's again 50%. You need to have both
[1:09:20] the mechanics which is the word and the
[1:09:22] dynamics which is the Holy Spirit so
[1:09:24] that you can have life.
[1:09:27] Amen. It's it's being asked uh sometimes
[1:09:31] uh uh you can have the right doctrine
[1:09:34] but wrong
[1:09:36] spirit or you can have the right uh the
[1:09:40] wrong the right doctrine but uh wrong
[1:09:42] spirit. Amen. Okay. Uh did I was I mixed
[1:09:46] up there? So wrong doctrine, right
[1:09:49] spirit equals still wrong. Right? So
[1:09:52] right doctrine but wrong spirit is still
[1:09:54] wrong. But for us brothers and sisters,
[1:09:56] we have both right. We have the word and
[1:09:59] we have the right spirit. That's why we
[1:10:00] have the life. Amen. It's so important
[1:10:03] to understand that that uh uh we can
[1:10:06] have both, right? Why not? Why not do
[1:10:09] that? Amen. So so you can see the
[1:10:13] justification we are made righteous.
[1:10:17] because of his death. Amen. Because he
[1:10:19] he chose us even before the foundation
[1:10:22] of the world.
[1:10:23] We It's
[1:10:25] so It's I'm I'm so glad that uh uh you
[1:10:31] know uh we we knew the message although
[1:10:35] I was not looking for it. You know my
[1:10:38] testimony it
[1:10:40] uh the good the goodness of God is
[1:10:42] running after us. Although we're not
[1:10:44] looking for it, it will run after us.
[1:10:48] Even even in in in in the Garden of
[1:10:50] Eden. Amen. It was God who's looking for
[1:10:53] them because they're the one who who who
[1:10:57] uh who wanted to uh to go away. They
[1:11:00] they were the one who went astray.
[1:11:03] Amen.
[1:11:05] Oh, there's so much things here, but uh
[1:11:08] let's see. We'll continue. So, the
[1:11:11] quickening power
[1:11:15] is in the bride
[1:11:16] today. What you can see Galatians 2:20,
[1:11:24] brother, I know we're kind of being
[1:11:26] silent here, but uh yeah, we're we have
[1:11:28] time. So, 25 more minutes. Uh but we
[1:11:30] will read the at least we we have all
[1:11:33] the scriptures here. The quickening
[1:11:36] power is in the bride today. So,
[1:11:37] Galatians 2:20, I am crucified with
[1:11:40] Christ. This is Paul speaking.
[1:11:42] Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but
[1:11:46] Christ liveth in me. Amen. And the life
[1:11:50] which I now live in the flesh, I live by
[1:11:54] the faith of the son of God who loved me
[1:11:57] and gave himself for me. So you can see
[1:12:00] here, it's the faith of the son of God,
[1:12:03] not our faith. It's the faith of the son
[1:12:06] of God in us. Amen. We are so thankful
[1:12:09] that his faith is in us. Amen. And in
[1:12:12] Romans 8:11, we we can see if the
[1:12:15] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:12:18] the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[1:12:20] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:12:22] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:12:24] dwelleth in you. Amen. And uh Ephesians
[1:12:27] 2:6, and had raised us up together and
[1:12:31] made us sit together in heavenly places
[1:12:33] in Christ Jesus. That is in Ephesians
[1:12:35] 2:6. You can see brothers and sisters
[1:12:37] when when we are here
[1:12:40] uh listening to to message or or or
[1:12:43] preaching fullness of the word and we
[1:12:46] are with believers of like precious
[1:12:48] faith. We are already sitting in
[1:12:49] heavenly places. Amen. Because uh the
[1:12:53] God that is in you is the God is in me
[1:12:55] also. Amen. And we are part of his
[1:12:58] economy. Amen. We we are part of his
[1:13:00] resurrection, his power. Amen. And
[1:13:04] that's why in John 14:12, he said,
[1:13:06] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[1:13:08] believeth on me, the works that I do
[1:13:10] shall he do also, and greater works than
[1:13:14] these shall you do, because I go unto my
[1:13:16] father." So, so you you can see this
[1:13:20] this uh greater works. Barham said,
[1:13:23] "More works also, but greater works
[1:13:25] because Jesus Christ multiplied bread,
[1:13:29] right? He fed the multitude.
[1:13:33] So from I think five loaves of bread and
[1:13:36] two
[1:13:37] fish, he fed the
[1:13:39] 3,000. Amen. And then he turned water
[1:13:43] into
[1:13:45] wine, right? In in in in uh uh that's
[1:13:48] the wedding in Canaa. But then the thing
[1:13:51] is uh in this last days with Bar Brham,
[1:13:54] he speaks squirrels into existence. So
[1:13:57] he spoke something out of nothing. So
[1:14:01] with Jesus Christ, right, he
[1:14:05] multiplied something from
[1:14:08] something, right? He turned water to
[1:14:13] wine. But then in in in in in in Baram's
[1:14:17] time, he spoke things into existence. He
[1:14:20] commanded the storm. I know Jesus Christ
[1:14:23] has that power too. But then the thing,
[1:14:25] it was declared to us. That's why we
[1:14:27] have greater works. And greater works
[1:14:29] means you can impart eternal life to
[1:14:32] others because that eternal life is in
[1:14:34] you. You cannot give something that you
[1:14:36] don't have. We always preach that. I'm
[1:14:38] I'm I'm just reminding that we are the
[1:14:41] we we can bridge the gap to to our loved
[1:14:43] ones who are not believers yet. We we we
[1:14:46] discuss or or
[1:14:48] we bar talk about the classes of people,
[1:14:52] right? Not everyone will be bright. But
[1:14:55] then for us sitting on a Wednesday
[1:14:57] night. Amen. We are we cannot say
[1:15:00] everyone is bride but uh we were
[1:15:03] claiming that we are all the bride of
[1:15:04] Jesus Christ. We are no no longer the
[1:15:07] church. We are called the bride of
[1:15:09] Christ. Amen. Amen. And and and the
[1:15:11] bride is a newly wedded wife. And it
[1:15:14] doesn't stop there. We are being united
[1:15:16] now spiritually. A spiritual union.
[1:15:18] Amen. And and we are only waiting for
[1:15:20] the body change which is the rapture.
[1:15:23] Amen. But the the process of the rapture
[1:15:25] is in us right now. It's happening right
[1:15:27] now, brothers and sisters. Upon upon
[1:15:30] receiving this word, Amen. You you are
[1:15:32] already in that process. When you're in
[1:15:34] the
[1:15:36] process, right? The only way is to
[1:15:41] progress, right? Although you might
[1:15:43] backslide but backsliding even brother
[1:15:46] Branham is saying it's part of the
[1:15:48] word because you who said that uh I back
[1:15:52] I backslide daily right or uh because
[1:15:55] the thing is we we we are still in this
[1:15:57] flesh. Amen. That's why what but but
[1:16:01] there's no excuse to backslide. We know
[1:16:03] that right? But then the thing is it's
[1:16:04] part of being human because this flesh
[1:16:07] and the spirit too is against our soul.
[1:16:12] two against one. We are three, right? We
[1:16:14] are trying being,
[1:16:16] right? We have body, we have spirit and
[1:16:19] soul. But this body is always sinning.
[1:16:23] This spirit, your memory, your your
[1:16:25] conscience, reasoning, imagination,
[1:16:27] memory, affection is
[1:16:29] all mostly worldly. But then your
[1:16:33] soul, that's what Satan cannot touch.
[1:16:36] Amen. Because it belongs to God. You
[1:16:39] see, two against one. So twothirds of
[1:16:41] our being is against against our soul
[1:16:44] against our real us. So it's difficult
[1:16:47] but then the thing is because of his res
[1:16:50] because of his sacrifice on the cross we
[1:16:53] are made righteous. We are made
[1:16:54] justified because of of that uh
[1:16:57] sacrifice. Amen. We're so thankful on
[1:16:58] that brothers and sisters. If we cannot
[1:17:01] do it by our own. Amen. That's why
[1:17:04] Easter is not just Easter means
[1:17:06] resurrection is not just a history.
[1:17:10] It's happening
[1:17:11] now. It's a continuation of uh of the
[1:17:14] death of Jesus Christ and resurrection
[1:17:16] because we rose with him. Even even the
[1:17:19] the Romans 6 when when we are
[1:17:23] baptized right we are submerged totally
[1:17:28] that means total death and when we rise
[1:17:31] we rise with him in the newness of life
[1:17:33] that's why death burial and resurrection
[1:17:36] right so so there is a formula how how
[1:17:39] how we how we can be quickened it's uh
[1:17:42] acts
[1:17:43] 238 we need to repent so that's our own
[1:17:47] valition
[1:17:48] Right? It means because gifts are uh
[1:17:52] gifts and callings are without
[1:17:53] repentance and gifts or or the rain
[1:17:55] falls on the just and the the unjust,
[1:17:58] right? Everything happens. So that the
[1:18:01] only thing that uh is required of us is
[1:18:05] to really believe and accept. So it
[1:18:07] means when we repent, it's our own
[1:18:10] valition.
[1:18:11] No one is requesting anyone to repent.
[1:18:14] Right? No one should ask someone to be
[1:18:17] baptized against their own valition. It
[1:18:20] should be free will. That's the reason
[1:18:22] why we are free moral moral agency.
[1:18:24] Otherwise, God will just make robots.
[1:18:28] Amen. That's the thing that uh uh he
[1:18:30] gave us that uh we'll require uh from
[1:18:34] our own valition. That's why the the key
[1:18:36] is you have to repent and be baptized
[1:18:39] for for what? For the remission of sins.
[1:18:42] And then what will happen after that?
[1:18:44] And then you will receive the ho uh the
[1:18:47] gift of the Holy Ghost. So those gifts
[1:18:48] are given to us freely. Amen. But we
[1:18:51] have to accept it. We have to receive
[1:18:53] it. Amen. And and and these are promises
[1:18:57] that were given and written in the
[1:18:59] Bible. Amen. So you can see it is uh in
[1:19:05] it is the rising of the sun. Barham
[1:19:08] preached you were in him when he rose.
[1:19:12] So when he rose, we were we we were in
[1:19:15] him. Amen. And and you can see the the
[1:19:18] spirit that he uh gave up when he died
[1:19:21] on the cross. That's the Holy Spirit
[1:19:23] that we received. Amen. It's not the
[1:19:25] chemistry of the blood. It's the life
[1:19:27] that it's in the blood that that went to
[1:19:30] the believer. So So you can see the
[1:19:31] wages of sin is death. So and uh without
[1:19:34] shedding of blood, there's no remission
[1:19:36] of sins. That's the reason why he
[1:19:39] allowed uh sin to come and then he's uh
[1:19:42] the penalty for sin is death. So he he
[1:19:45] being the redeemer himself, he went into
[1:19:49] into the veil of flesh so that he can
[1:19:50] die because a spirit cannot die.
[1:19:55] Amen. So
[1:19:58] Easter is the wave shift. It's the first
[1:20:02] fruit.
[1:20:04] Let's let's read leviticus 13:10-11.
[1:20:07] Yeah. Amen. This one is important,
[1:20:09] brothers and sisters, because uh the
[1:20:11] thing is uh the wave shift is uh you can
[1:20:14] see uh in the Old Testament. Let's read
[1:20:16] it, brother. Leviticus 23:10. We have
[1:20:20] time uh 15 more minutes.
[1:20:28] Speak unto the children of Israel, and
[1:20:30] say unto them, when you
[1:20:34] become when you become into the land
[1:20:38] which I give unto you, and shall reap
[1:20:40] the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring
[1:20:42] a sheath of the first fruits of your h
[1:20:46] harvest unto the priest, and he shall
[1:20:49] wave the sheath before the Lord to be
[1:20:51] accepted for you. On the tomorrow after
[1:20:54] the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
[1:20:57] Amen. So you can see
[1:21:00] here
[1:21:02] Jesus is the first sheep that is waved
[1:21:06] before God.
[1:21:08] Amen. The acceptance of that first sheep
[1:21:11] means the entire harvest is accepted
[1:21:14] and we are part of that harvest. Amen.
[1:21:17] Right now we are believers of this
[1:21:19] message of the hour. Yes. The first wave
[1:21:21] shift for this message is Bar Brham. And
[1:21:25] it just means that what he received, we
[1:21:28] also received.
[1:21:30] Amen. You receive uh if you receive a
[1:21:36] prophet in his name, you will receive
[1:21:38] the prophet's reward. And if you will
[1:21:41] receive uh a
[1:21:44] man right in his own name that is
[1:21:46] righteous, you will receive also the
[1:21:48] same thing. That's why Barb, it didn't
[1:21:51] stop with Bar Brandham. It continued
[1:21:53] with us. Amen. So that's why Jesus
[1:21:55] Christ and then uh we know the message
[1:21:57] uh uh the prophet for this message uh
[1:22:00] for for for this uh age. It was brother
[1:22:03] Brandham who who gave us he he is our
[1:22:05] waves shift for for what we believe
[1:22:06] right now. And that waves shift is in us
[1:22:09] right now also. We are the waves shift
[1:22:11] being being waved right now. Amen. So,
[1:22:14] so that's why we we need to declare
[1:22:19] Jesus Christ in our lives. How? Amen.
[1:22:22] That that's the reason why of the the
[1:22:24] scripture is we are living epistles read
[1:22:27] of all men. Amen. Our lives declare what
[1:22:30] we believe. Amen. And and if we are in
[1:22:33] church, we are believers and then uh at
[1:22:37] work we are not believers, then that's
[1:22:39] hypocrisy. Amen. That's right. Wherever
[1:22:41] we go, whether in church or at school or
[1:22:45] wherever, we should be the same person.
[1:22:47] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. It's it's
[1:22:49] important because we are part of that
[1:22:51] harvest. We we belong to the same field.
[1:22:54] Amen. Though the maturity depends. Some
[1:22:57] are already matured, right? I mean, uh
[1:23:01] maybe they they are under the uh under
[1:23:04] the presence of the sun always. They
[1:23:06] always pray. They always uh uh read the
[1:23:09] the word. Amen. and uh read the the
[1:23:11] message. That's why they are matured.
[1:23:13] But then we have also younger people,
[1:23:15] young not only young, even older that
[1:23:17] are are not reading the word, that are
[1:23:19] not praying, that are not listening to
[1:23:21] message. That's why maturity is a little
[1:23:23] bit slower. But then everyone will come
[1:23:26] to maturity at the same time because
[1:23:29] everyone must be matured before we can
[1:23:32] be raptured. Amen. That's right.
[1:23:38] There there is a message to uh to the
[1:23:41] true
[1:23:42] church, right? The true
[1:23:46] church because we we claim that we are
[1:23:49] part of the true church. Amen. The
[1:23:50] mystical body of church. We are local
[1:23:52] church here. We are we we have other
[1:23:54] churches as well uh who believe the same
[1:23:56] message but then we belong to the same
[1:23:58] mystical body of Christ. Amen. And uh uh
[1:24:02] so so for us being part of this mystical
[1:24:07] body, right? We are Holy Ghost fil bride
[1:24:12] and we are called the true church and we
[1:24:15] are not just preaching Easter, we are
[1:24:18] living it. Amen. And and you can see
[1:24:21] Calgary Living Word Assembly, right?
[1:24:23] Living Word Fellowship. We we have so
[1:24:26] many other uh uh churches that uh that
[1:24:29] name their uh churches as living word
[1:24:32] because we are the living word. We are
[1:24:34] the manifestation of that living word.
[1:24:36] And it's a it's not a dead word. It's
[1:24:38] not only in letters. It's a living word
[1:24:42] manifesting in our lives. Amen. It's we
[1:24:45] are the continuation of the
[1:24:47] resurrection. Meaning it didn't stop
[1:24:50] only. It's not a day. It's a
[1:24:51] continuation. Amen. It's a it's a life.
[1:24:54] It's a continuous thing that uh that's
[1:24:56] going on right now. Amen. And uh
[1:24:59] uh and this is the living
[1:25:02] hope for us. What's that living hope?
[1:25:06] We're hoping for the rapture, right? 1
[1:25:08] Thessalonians 4:16-7. Let's just read
[1:25:11] them. For the Lord himself shall descend
[1:25:14] from
[1:25:15] heaven with a
[1:25:19] shout. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. Brother
[1:25:26] Let's read uh this one because this is
[1:25:28] the living hope for every believer. And
[1:25:30] uh if uh if if we don't believe uh or if
[1:25:35] we don't hope for this then uh our our
[1:25:38] our faith is in vain. Amen. Living hope
[1:25:42] for the final resurrection. Amen. 1
[1:25:44] Thessalonians 4:16-17. For the Lord
[1:25:47] himself shall descend from
[1:25:49] heaven. Amen. with a
[1:25:52] shout, with with the voice of the
[1:25:55] archangel, and with the trump of God,
[1:25:57] and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:26:00] Then
[1:26:03] 17, then we which are alive and remain
[1:26:06] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:26:08] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:26:10] Oh, and so shall ever be with the Lord.
[1:26:13] That's the first uh uh rapture uh
[1:26:18] uh verse. And then in 1 Corinthians
[1:26:20] 15
[1:26:23] 51, this is also important just to
[1:26:25] remind ourselves. Amen. Because this is
[1:26:28] the hope because if it is written, it's
[1:26:30] a promise of God. Amen. And it will
[1:26:32] happen. That's the that's the reason why
[1:26:34] we're we we are believers of this word.
[1:26:36] Amen. Amen. 1 Corinthians 15:51,
[1:26:39] brother. Behold, I show you a mystery.
[1:26:43] We shall not all asleep or sleep, but we
[1:26:46] shall all be changed. Next verse. In a
[1:26:50] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
[1:26:52] the last trump, for the trumpet shall
[1:26:54] sound, and the dead shall be raised
[1:26:56] incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
[1:26:59] Amen. And uh in Job 19:25, brothers,
[1:27:03] brother,
[1:27:10] Job
[1:27:13] 19 25- 26.
[1:27:22] For I know, amen, that my redeemer
[1:27:24] liveth, do we? And that he shall stand
[1:27:28] at the latter day upon the earth.
[1:27:32] 26 And though after my skin worms
[1:27:35] destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall
[1:27:38] I see God.
[1:27:40] Thank you, Lord. 1 Peter 1 to3
[1:27:46] 1 Peter chapter
[1:27:50] 1:3, "Blessed be the God and Father of
[1:27:53] our Lord Jesus Christ, which according
[1:27:56] to his abundant mercy had begotten us
[1:27:59] again unto a lively hope." Hope of what?
[1:28:03] By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:28:05] the dead. Amen. So you can see if Christ
[1:28:09] rose, so shall we? Amen. Because we're
[1:28:12] part of him. Amen. Yeah, the shout, the
[1:28:15] voice, the trumpet, they're not fiction.
[1:28:17] They are reality. We know it happened
[1:28:19] already. Uh only thing that we're
[1:28:21] waiting is the trump because that one is
[1:28:23] when we will have that uh uh meeting in
[1:28:26] the air. Exactly. But the the the shout
[1:28:28] and the voice we I I already preach on
[1:28:31] that and it's a timeline also. We can
[1:28:33] see 1963 when when the cloud appeared.
[1:28:36] That's that's the start of the shout
[1:28:38] which is the message of the hour.
[1:28:39] Although it uh started in 1946, all
[1:28:42] those things, but then when when the
[1:28:44] angel of the Lord came in Revelations
[1:28:46] 10:1, that's Jesus Christ himself. We
[1:28:49] know that. Amen. And and and that's the
[1:28:51] start of the seventh seal being opened.
[1:28:54] Amen. And that's the book of redemption
[1:28:55] to us knowing who we are. Amen. And
[1:28:58] yeah, and these are you can see the
[1:29:02] shout, the voice, and the trumpet.
[1:29:04] They're true. They're not fiction. They
[1:29:06] are prophecy that are being fulfilled
[1:29:08] right now. Amen. In you and me. Amen.
[1:29:11] And the quick and
[1:29:13] bride, you can see we're waiting with
[1:29:16] expectation. We are making ourselves
[1:29:18] ready. Re revelations 19. Amen. We with
[1:29:23] with this message of the hour, we're so
[1:29:25] thankful that we it it can clothe us
[1:29:28] with righteousness. That means that's
[1:29:31] the the real meaning of justification.
[1:29:33] We are being made righteous. Amen.
[1:29:36] That's why it's it's so important to
[1:29:37] understand justification also because
[1:29:40] justification after justification we
[1:29:42] know the stages of grace you need to be
[1:29:44] sanctified and then baptized with the
[1:29:46] Holy Ghost once you have all these three
[1:29:48] stages and then the Holy Ghost himself
[1:29:50] which is Jesus Christ will dwell in us
[1:29:52] and then we will have a change in our
[1:29:55] natural mind thinking that we will be
[1:29:57] like him. Amen. And uh Romans 6:4 this
[1:30:02] is uh the verse that we typic most of
[1:30:06] the time use also for baptism. Romans
[1:30:08] 6:4 brother therefore we are buried with
[1:30:12] him by baptism. Amen. Into death. But
[1:30:16] like as Christ was raised up from the
[1:30:18] dead by the glory of the father even so
[1:30:22] we also should walk in newness of life.
[1:30:26] So you can see resurrection is not one
[1:30:30] day, it's a daily walk. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:33] Amen. Christ was
[1:30:36] waved. Now the bride is being waved
[1:30:39] also. We don't need to be spectators. We
[1:30:43] must be part of this rising. Right. And
[1:30:47] uh to close, oh before before I called,
[1:30:50] oh maybe I'll call the musician so that
[1:30:52] uh when we anoint uh sister Mary with
[1:30:55] doily uh at least we have some music.
[1:30:58] I'll just call the musician musicians.
[1:31:01] Uh so you can see in Jude
[1:31:10] 1:24-25 bear with me
[1:31:15] here Jude 1:24-25.
[1:31:29] Now unto
[1:31:30] him that is able to keep you from
[1:31:34] falling and to present you
[1:31:37] faultless before the present presence of
[1:31:40] his glory with exceeding joy. You can
[1:31:42] see we are
[1:31:44] presented as faultless blameless right
[1:31:49] spotless that means fully justified.
[1:31:52] That's why justified brother uh we never
[1:31:55] did it in the first place because God is
[1:31:57] seeing the sacrifice. He became sin so
[1:32:00] that we will become God's righteousness.
[1:32:03] Brothers and sisters, we're so thankful
[1:32:05] unto him. And uh if if I will if I will
[1:32:08] read the quote brother uh this one is uh
[1:32:11] at least it can increase our faith too
[1:32:15] in
[1:32:17] uh in living dying buried rising coming
[1:32:21] in
[1:32:23] 1959 April
[1:32:27] 3rd
[1:32:28] 590403 living dying buried rising and
[1:32:31] coming Branam has a a very good
[1:32:36] uh quote
[1:32:40] here in 74. Let's start with
[1:32:49] 74. Bear with me. Sorry, I didn't put
[1:32:51] that in the in the slide.
[1:32:55] So, let's read this until and then uh we
[1:32:58] can call Sister Mary and the elders to
[1:33:01] to anoint her.
[1:33:09] All
[1:33:10] right. God
[1:33:12] proved by the
[1:33:15] resurrection that he wasn't frowny. He
[1:33:19] wasn't
[1:33:19] fake. That was his son. Amen. Amen. And
[1:33:23] he raised him up. The spirit, the
[1:33:26] eternal spirit, Jehovah God, the father
[1:33:29] of our Lord Jesus Christ, who raised up
[1:33:33] that dead form in the grave there had
[1:33:36] been dead for three days and buried and
[1:33:39] God raised him up on Easter morning to
[1:33:41] justify. Amen. Then when we
[1:33:45] come, brother come into God, there's not
[1:33:50] one thing. He that cometh must come
[1:33:53] boldly to the throne. Amen. To the
[1:33:56] throne of grace. You must not come
[1:33:59] wondering. When you come into the prayer
[1:34:02] line, you must not come wondering. Well,
[1:34:06] if this minister will pray for me,
[1:34:07] perhaps maybe he's got healing power.
[1:34:09] It's not the minister. Brother, brothers
[1:34:11] and sisters. Amen. Brother, sister,
[1:34:14] healing power is in God. Amen. It's in
[1:34:19] cross
[1:34:21] in the finished work. Amen. Of Calvary.
[1:34:25] When you come, come to be justified.
[1:34:29] Amen.
[1:34:31] You are justified when you confess your
[1:34:34] faith that by stripes I was healed. I'm
[1:34:38] going to make a stand. Amen. We need to
[1:34:41] make a stand. If we were sick this

[1:35:27] But tonight, I stand because I believe
[1:35:30] that he loved me and died for me and
[1:35:33] saved me and buried my sins far away.
[1:35:36] Amen.
[1:35:39] And God justified us by believing on him
[1:35:43] when he raised him up from the dead.
[1:35:45] Amen. He accepted everything that he
[1:35:48] died for. Thank you, Lord. Amen. He was
[1:35:51] wounded for our
[1:35:53] transgressions, bruised for our
[1:35:55] iniquity. The chastisement of
[1:35:58] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[1:36:01] And with his stripes, we were healed.
[1:36:03] Past tense. and he raised him up and
[1:36:06] wrote the receipt. We we talked about it
[1:36:09] a while
[1:36:10] ago. The receipt is the
[1:36:14] resurrection because he he resurrected.
[1:36:16] That's why we have that receipt. It's
[1:36:18] fully paid. We are healed. Amen. That
[1:36:22] that was God's receipt. When the earth
[1:36:25] began to quiver and shake and the sun

[1:43:20] the first place because he became sin
[1:43:23] for you. Amen. For you and me. Amen. I
[1:43:26] was sitting alone and
[1:43:29] wondering about what I'm supposed to
[1:43:33] do. I can't deny the times I made
[1:43:37] mistake. I can't hide from you and you.
[1:43:43] But I know that deep within my soul I
[1:43:46] felt sorry as I
[1:43:50] knew. I can try to say forgive me Lord.
[1:43:55] Forgive me again. Will you
[1:44:01] justify?

[1:44:39] fall.
[1:44:40] Because he promised I'd be
[1:44:43] victorious when I know I'm not at

[1:45:41] brother Brandham used uh Hebrews 138
[1:45:46] always, right? Uh Jesus Christ is the
[1:45:49] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:45:52] Right? yesterday when he died and rose
[1:45:55] for our
[1:45:56] justification in Romans 4:25 who was
[1:46:00] delivered for our offenses and was
[1:46:02] raised again for our justification.
[1:46:04] That's yesterday. But what about today?
[1:46:07] He lives in the bride through the
[1:46:08] quickening power. Amen. That's in Romans
[1:46:11] 8:11. The spirit that dwelleth in uh if

[1:46:19] dwelleth in us. But how about forever?
[1:46:22] He's coming. We know he already came
[1:46:26] spiritually, right? He's coming for a
[1:46:28] resurrected people who have already
[1:46:31] experienced the spiritual resurrection.

[1:47:11] Christ amen you can see all the
[1:47:14] attributes of God are being manifested
[1:47:17] through us without the bride is not made

[1:47:45] but then the voice asked John John is a
[1:47:47] type of you and me to take it take it
