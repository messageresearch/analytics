[42:38] scripture I'd like to read tonight thank

[42:43] a little bit of a different direction
[42:46] but uh
[42:47] just trust the Lord will bless it if
[42:49] you'll turn with me to Daniel chapter 3.
[42:54] very familiar story
[42:57] don't know how much time we'll have to
[43:01] get into it but we'll see God bless you
[43:03] tonight certainly wonderful to have
[43:06] everyone here even our visitors we trust
[43:09] the Lord blesses you abundantly
[43:13] Daniel chapter 3. we'll start with verse
[43:16] one
[43:18] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
[43:21] gold whose height was three score cubits
[43:24] and the breadth thereof
[43:27] six cubits
[43:29] he set it up in the plane of dura in the
[43:32] province of Babylon
[43:34] the Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to
[43:37] gather together the princes the
[43:39] governors and the captains the judges
[43:42] and the treasurers the counselors the
[43:45] sheriffs and all the rulers of the
[43:47] provinces
[43:49] to come to the dedication of the image
[43:51] which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
[43:55] then the princes the governors the
[43:57] captains the judges the treasurers the
[44:00] counselors the sheriffs and all the
[44:02] rulers of the provinces were gathered
[44:05] together unto the dedication of the
[44:08] image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had
[44:11] set up and they stood before the image
[44:14] that Nebuchadnezzar had set up
[44:17] then and Harold cried aloud
[44:20] to you
[44:21] it is commanded o people Nations and
[44:25] languages
[44:27] that at what time ye hear the sound of
[44:30] the Cornet the flute heart sackbut
[44:33] sultry
[44:35] dulcimer and all kinds of music ye Fall
[44:39] Down and Worship the golden image that
[44:42] Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up
[44:46] and who so falleth not down and
[44:49] worshipeth
[44:50] shall the same hour be cast into the
[44:53] midst of a burning fiery furnace
[44:57] therefore at that time when all the
[44:59] people heard the sound of the Cornet
[45:01] flute harp sackbutt Sultry and all kinds
[45:05] of music all the people the Nations and
[45:09] the languages fell down and worshiped
[45:11] the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
[45:14] king had set up
[45:17] wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans
[45:21] came near and accused the Jews
[45:24] now note I just want to make a note here
[45:26] they didn't accuse the Jews to the Jews
[45:29] they went behind their back to the king
[45:32] verse 9 they spake and said to the King
[45:36] Nebuchadnezzar O King live forever thou
[45:40] Old King has made a decree that every
[45:42] man shall every man that shall hear the
[45:45] sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbutt
[45:49] Sultry and dulcimer and all kinds of
[45:52] music shall fall down and worship the
[45:54] golden image and whoso falleth not down
[45:57] and worshipeth that he should be cast
[46:00] into the midst of a burning fiery
[46:03] furnace
[46:04] there are certain Jews whom now has set
[46:08] over the Affairs of the provinces of
[46:10] Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[46:14] these men O King have not regarded thee
[46:18] they serve not thy Gods nor worship the
[46:21] golden image which thou Hast set up
[46:25] the Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[46:29] commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and
[46:33] Abednego
[46:35] then they brought these men before the
[46:37] king
[46:38] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them
[46:41] is it true o Shadrach Meshach and
[46:45] Abednego
[46:46] do not ye serve my gods nor worship the
[46:50] golden image which I have set up
[46:53] now if ye be ready at that at what time
[46:56] ye hear the sound of the Cornet flute
[46:59] harp sackbutt Sultry and dulcimer and
[47:04] all kinds of music ye Fall Down and
[47:07] Worship the image which I have made well
[47:10] but if ye worship not ye shall be cast
[47:13] the same hour into the midst of a
[47:16] burning fiery furnace
[47:18] and who is that God that shall deliver
[47:22] you out of my hands
[47:25] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered
[47:29] and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we
[47:33] are not careful to answer thee in this
[47:36] matter
[47:38] if it be so our God whom we serve is
[47:42] able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[47:44] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[47:48] of thine hand O King
[47:51] but if not be it known unto thee O King
[47:55] that we will not serve thy Gods nor
[47:58] worship the golden image which thou Hast
[48:02] set up
[48:03] then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury
[48:06] and the form of his Visage was changed
[48:09] against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[48:13] therefore he spake and commanded that
[48:16] they should heat the furnace one seven
[48:19] times more than it was want to be heated
[48:23] and he commanded the most mighty men
[48:25] that were in his army to bind Shadrach
[48:29] Meshach and Abednego and to cast them
[48:32] into the burning fiery furnace
[48:36] then these men were Bound in their coats
[48:38] their hosen and their hats and their
[48:42] other garments and were cast into the
[48:44] midst of the burning fiery furnace
[48:47] therefore because the king's commandment
[48:49] was urgent and the furnace was exceeding
[48:52] hot the flame of the fire slew those men
[48:56] that took up Shadrach Meshach and
[48:58] Abednego and these three men Shadrach
[49:01] Meshach and Abednego fell down bound
[49:05] into the midst of the burning fiery
[49:08] furnace
[49:09] then Nebuchadnezzar the King was
[49:12] astonied and Rose up in haste and spake
[49:16] and said unto his counselors did not we
[49:20] cast three men Bound in the midst of the
[49:24] fire
[49:25] they answered and said unto the king
[49:27] true O King he answered and said lo I
[49:31] see four men loose walking in the midst
[49:35] of the fire
[49:36] and they have no hurt
[49:38] and the form of the fourth like the son
[49:42] of God
[49:43] let's just bow in prayer
[49:46] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[49:48] word this story Lord we know that you
[49:51] have a purpose for it
[49:53] and father we thank you for the courage
[49:55] of those three young men
[49:57] Lord that they wouldn't bow down father
[49:59] that they wouldn't be careful to speak
[50:01] to the king because they knew the king
[50:04] and father we just want to commit this
[50:06] service now into your hands father that
[50:08] you would just speak to us about this
[50:10] story father and Lord that you would
[50:12] just say the words that you once said
[50:14] and you would stop the words that you
[50:16] don't father and we'll be careful to
[50:18] give you all the praise we love you we
[50:20] thank you we just ask all these things
[50:22] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[50:25] bless you tonight you may be seated
[50:29] we just had two
[50:31] praise reports
[50:33] which I wanted to mention before we get
[50:36] into the service tonight I think it's
[50:37] beautiful
[50:40] sister Marion wants to thank the Lord
[50:43] for Journey Mercies back from Nairobi
[50:46] Kenya
[50:48] and the church in Nairobi also sends
[50:50] their greetings
[50:51] and I believe that's brother Wycliffe
[50:55] is it at the moringa School
[50:57] yeah we had a service there
[51:00] uh just a tremendous group of Believers
[51:02] there
[51:03] we're certainly thankful for what the
[51:05] Lord's done in sister Marion and brother
[51:07] tabiso's lives the Lord has certainly
[51:10] worked a wonderful thing there
[51:13] and I'm very interested to hear the uh
[51:15] the report from your auntie sister
[51:19] um
[51:19] for anyone that is curious about that
[51:21] this sister has a story about serving
[51:26] the lord and I think it would be
[51:27] tremendous somehow someway we need to
[51:30] get a microphone on a camera in front of
[51:32] her and and let her tell her story of
[51:34] her husband he is uh he has has been
[51:38] I'll say it this way not a very nice man
[51:41] over the years
[51:43] um he has treated her very very poorly
[51:45] but you know what that has not given her
[51:48] license to actually change her own
[51:50] testimony about the grace of the Lord
[51:52] Jesus in her life she has prayed the
[51:55] blessing upon her family upon her
[51:57] husband and continues to do so even
[51:59] while her husband abuses her verbally
[52:02] and physically while he drinks he has
[52:05] not been a very nice man but she has not
[52:07] changed not wavered her testimony one
[52:09] iota and you know the Lord has answered
[52:13] prayers in ways that maybe sometimes we
[52:17] don't even understand sometimes we can
[52:19] ask for a prayer and the Lord will allow
[52:21] us to go through a valley he'll allow us
[52:23] to go through a circumstance or a
[52:24] situation and and that will be to see
[52:27] how we come out the other side and and
[52:30] we will come out the other side we will
[52:32] actually prove that we are Sons and
[52:34] Daughters of God even in the midst of
[52:36] great trial but it's a tremendous story
[52:39] I would certainly love it if your auntie
[52:42] could come to Canada just let her give a
[52:45] testimony it would be tremendous but uh
[52:47] anyways if you're talking to her just
[52:49] say greetings from your church here
[52:51] sister we also have a praise report from
[52:54] Sister Elaine who uh she lost the ring
[52:58] and uh it's a very special ring it was
[53:01] an anniversary ring I understand and uh
[53:04] it's a very special ring and uh she
[53:07] didn't know where it was for two and a
[53:09] half weeks and the family in the church
[53:11] said you know what we understand this
[53:14] problem and and we'll pray for you
[53:16] sister Elaine didn't tell anyone else
[53:18] she didn't tell her husband it was a
[53:19] gift from her husband for their
[53:21] anniversary she didn't tell anybody
[53:22] because it it it's serious you certainly
[53:26] don't want to lose something like that
[53:27] and and say that you've lost it but she
[53:29] committed it to the Lord we know that
[53:31] the word of God says that if any two can
[53:33] agree on asking for anything that the
[53:36] Lord will grant it to them and and
[53:38] that's actually happened that that that
[53:39] happened sister Elaine was actually
[53:42] looking in her file cabinet and she
[53:44] heard a clunk and she found the Ring The
[53:46] Ring was there now many people would say
[53:49] well she probably just had it on her
[53:50] finger and it just slipped off and fell
[53:52] in there because she's busy at work and
[53:54] you know that's the way life happens and
[53:56] we can just explain everything away
[53:57] can't we who's to say that that ring
[53:59] didn't follow it on the ground somewhere
[54:01] at a store or somewhere else we know
[54:03] we're dealing with a little bit of a
[54:04] different age here and you ask God for
[54:07] anything and there's nothing that he
[54:08] will hold back from you if it's
[54:10] according to his word so we just want to
[54:12] give God the praise for that because we
[54:14] don't know where that ring really was
[54:16] some people will say Well it had to be
[54:18] in the filing cabinet all along and
[54:20] that's fine some people will say that
[54:22] but you never know where it was God
[54:24] knows and one day we'll look back and
[54:26] say thank you Lord but we don't have to
[54:28] wait till we get somewhere to do that we
[54:29] can give him the praise and the glory
[54:31] here so God bless you Sister Elaine and
[54:33] sister Marion for your praise reports I
[54:35] believe he loves to hear it I believe
[54:37] that the body of Believers love to hear
[54:39] it because it's an encouragement to us
[54:41] we serve a living God
[54:44] are you happy tonight
[54:46] I just want to talk about Daniel and and
[54:48] this story about the the fiery furnace
[54:50] and before we get into that there's a
[54:52] few announcements we have the ladies
[54:54] brunch it's coming up on the 16th and I
[54:56] believe it's 10 30 a.m uh if you have
[54:59] any questions about that please just
[55:00] reach out to Sister Lisa we have the
[55:03] Youth Event coming up after service on
[55:05] the 10th and it's going to start at two
[55:07] o'clock and end at five o'clock it will
[55:09] be at the Claussen acreage
[55:12] uh Thursday the 14th we're going to have
[55:13] a prayer meeting at 7 30 at the church
[55:15] here it's always a good time for prayer
[55:19] and testimonies Sunday the 17th at 6 PM
[55:22] we'll have a communion service
[55:24] so uh maybe just make sure we Mark these
[55:27] down in our calendars it's on the actual
[55:29] Church calendar as well Wednesday
[55:30] September the 28th we're going to have
[55:32] brother James new Van de Bandy here and
[55:34] uh I'm trusting it'll be a wonderful
[55:36] time the Lord will certainly move I did
[55:39] send out a text message
[55:41] um for brother Andrew I'm sure that
[55:44] everyone got it and uh understands the
[55:47] the situation I sent it to the brothers
[55:49] but uh
[55:51] yeah brother Andrews being led by the
[55:53] Lord for anybody that doesn't know
[55:55] brother Andrew he's here tonight he uh
[55:57] was here on a work situation from
[56:00] Newfoundland into the Northwest
[56:02] Territories and he was forced to bug out
[56:06] because of the fires they evacuated
[56:08] everyone and he wound up in Calgary with
[56:11] his job and believer of this message he
[56:15] looked for a church and found this
[56:16] church here and so here he finds himself
[56:19] in Calgary and the employer in
[56:23] Newfoundland decided to terminate his
[56:26] employment so now he's just at large and
[56:29] he's not quite sure what to do he feels
[56:32] led to attend here I suggested that we
[56:35] look at the service you know the
[56:37] choosing of a bride by the prophet in
[56:39] our day we know that that's a powerful
[56:41] message not so much about finding a wife
[56:43] but finding a place where you can be
[56:45] spiritually fed and if we can do that I
[56:48] believe the Lord will just pour out a
[56:50] blessing that we can't even really
[56:51] contain so just pray for brother Andrew
[56:54] I believe that someone has already
[56:55] stepped up to the plate to help out
[56:57] brother Andrew we'll certainly talk
[57:00] about that afterwards but if anybody
[57:02] does have anything they can do to help
[57:03] please reach out you know healing comes
[57:07] through the body encouragement comes
[57:09] through the body
[57:10] it's a wonderful thing to be a part of a
[57:13] body
[57:14] talking about our story tonight I think
[57:17] it's just wonderful how we can see the
[57:20] the the progression of of this story and
[57:25] you know before we really even get into
[57:26] this I think it's important to just take
[57:28] a look at the maybe a little bit of the
[57:30] story of how this all unfolded
[57:34] and uh
[57:36] bear with me for a second here
[57:39] I just think it's it's it's interesting
[57:41] to look at the background story of this
[57:43] not just so much that you know at the
[57:46] time the king set up the image and and
[57:49] the children were told to come and bow
[57:51] before this image and we know that we
[57:53] refer to them as children but they were
[57:55] young men they weren't just little
[57:57] children that were unattended without
[57:59] parents the Hebrew kids were were Sons
[58:02] and Daughters of God sons of God
[58:06] um but there was probably many people
[58:07] that were carried away that's why I say
[58:09] Sons and Daughters of God it wasn't just
[58:11] uh men I believe there was a bunch of
[58:14] people that were taken away and they
[58:16] were taken away by Nebuchadnezzar the
[58:18] king of of Babylon and we know that he
[58:21] came and he sacked Jerusalem he
[58:24] destroyed the city and he was merciless
[58:27] he was ruthless and cold he went through
[58:30] and killed and destroyed
[58:33] aimlessly he he saved the Smart Ones
[58:36] though he saved the ones who were
[58:38] educated the ones who actually had skill
[58:41] and talent he did take those and and led
[58:44] them captive into his land of Babylon
[58:46] but you know while he was there in
[58:48] Jerusalem he was ruthless he was he was
[58:50] actually told not to spare a life not to
[58:53] have pity on anyone and that's actually
[58:55] the words of the Lord if you go back
[58:57] into the book of Jeremiah and read what
[58:59] God was saying to Jerusalem to the
[59:02] inhabitants of this city it's not like
[59:04] God just allowed this amazingly terrible
[59:08] uh Misfortune to fall upon the city of
[59:11] Jerusalem they were warned and they were
[59:14] warned and they were warned not just
[59:17] over and over again by Jeremiah they had
[59:20] Ezekiel there to warn them and tell them
[59:23] guys get back to Christ get back to the
[59:27] word forget about the formal Traditions
[59:29] that we have forget about all the man's
[59:31] ideas that we have half get back to the
[59:34] word of God get straight with that word
[59:37] and over and over again what did they do
[59:39] they destroyed the prophets they
[59:42] dismissed the prophets they insulted the
[59:45] prophets they treated the prophets
[59:46] poorly they said we don't have to listen
[59:49] to you because look at we've got
[59:51] everything that we need we've got these
[59:52] Great Walls of security everything that
[59:54] we need is is right here for us we don't
[59:57] have to worry about listening to this
[59:58] who is this guy he's a fanatic we know
[1:00:01] his parents we know where he came from
[1:00:03] he's just another another
[1:00:05] human being just like the rest of us and
[1:00:07] he goes and makes himself special saying
[1:00:09] that he's a prophet of God but you know
[1:00:12] not very many people have the courage to
[1:00:13] go and put their finger in the face of a
[1:00:16] king and say thus saith the Lord not
[1:00:19] many people but Isaiah did and Jeremiah
[1:00:22] did and so did Ezekiel and all the rest
[1:00:24] of the prophets get back to the word
[1:00:26] stay straight on that word and what did
[1:00:29] they do they dismissed them and so you
[1:00:31] know what God had nothing but to follow
[1:00:33] through with his prophecy he told them
[1:00:35] exactly what would happen if you don't
[1:00:38] listen to me I'm going to send the King
[1:00:40] of the North and he's going to March
[1:00:42] into your city and destroy it and you
[1:00:47] because they didn't listen that's what
[1:00:49] he did did exactly that didn't he
[1:00:52] that's where these boys in in our story
[1:00:55] come from that's the the situation the
[1:00:58] the background sort of of what happened
[1:01:00] and you know when that happened they
[1:01:03] they were taken because they were
[1:01:05] healthy they were taken because they
[1:01:07] were smart they were able to actually be
[1:01:10] used for some Purpose By The King and we
[1:01:13] know that the only reason
[1:01:15] the king wanted them was because God
[1:01:18] wanted to do something with them
[1:01:20] it's not just because Nebuchadnezzar
[1:01:22] wanted something done nothing happens
[1:01:23] unless God wants it done that that's
[1:01:25] that's the truth of the matter God
[1:01:27] wanted these boys saved and God wanted
[1:01:30] these boys to get right beside the king
[1:01:33] not just be saved but you know going
[1:01:36] back in the story right to the beginning
[1:01:37] of Daniel one of the first things that
[1:01:39] happened to them when they were actually
[1:01:41] taken into captivity one of the first
[1:01:43] things that they did to them is they
[1:01:45] renamed them
[1:01:47] they took their old names and said
[1:01:48] forget about your names that's what your
[1:01:50] parents called you you're the son of
[1:01:51] so-and-so no you're not you're the son
[1:01:53] of Nebuchadnezzar now this is your new
[1:01:55] name forget about your old life forget
[1:01:57] about all of your old traditions now
[1:01:59] even your language that means nothing
[1:02:02] now you're going to learn the new
[1:02:04] language you're going to to learn all of
[1:02:06] the new customs and traditions and
[1:02:08] you're going to be a brand new person
[1:02:10] and and if you don't want that then
[1:02:12] we'll just kill you that's all you can
[1:02:14] make your choice and so that was the
[1:02:15] first thing that they did was they were
[1:02:17] renamed it was Michelle
[1:02:19] Azariah and and hananiah Shadrach
[1:02:23] Meshach and Abednego I didn't say it the
[1:02:25] right way had an eye it was Shadrach
[1:02:26] Michelle was Meshach and Azariah was
[1:02:30] Abednego
[1:02:31] their names were changed it was a
[1:02:33] psychological method to reprogram them
[1:02:35] to reprogram their thinking to give them
[1:02:38] a little bit of Amnesia about who they
[1:02:40] were and I just can't help but think
[1:02:42] about this psychological method to
[1:02:44] reprogram their thinking take a look at
[1:02:46] at our lives in the world that we live
[1:02:49] in brothers and sisters you know even if
[1:02:51] we just look at it at a carnal level at
[1:02:53] a human level when we thought about our
[1:02:55] lives as children how did you see
[1:02:57] yourself
[1:02:58] and how do you see yourself today many
[1:03:01] of the children would say well I see
[1:03:02] myself exactly like a child and I get
[1:03:04] that but you'll find out children that
[1:03:07] when you get to be old like me or or
[1:03:09] some of the other people in the
[1:03:11] congregation that you will not see
[1:03:13] yourself the exact same way and some of
[1:03:15] it is because of learning and maturity
[1:03:17] but some of it is because of the way
[1:03:20] this world treats us the situations and
[1:03:22] and and circumstances that we have to go
[1:03:25] through it changes the way we see
[1:03:27] ourselves it changes the way we feel
[1:03:29] about ourselves and sometimes it can
[1:03:31] even change the way we talk about
[1:03:32] ourselves not to other people
[1:03:33] necessarily but it to ourselves that
[1:03:36] self-talk now some people might say
[1:03:38] brother Barry now you're really getting
[1:03:39] psychological but you know what we do
[1:03:41] have a voice inside of our head and if
[1:03:43] we're not careful we'll be listening to
[1:03:45] the wrong one the one we want to listen
[1:03:47] to is the one that actually lines up
[1:03:49] with the word of God
[1:03:51] now I'm saying it because I've
[1:03:53] experienced complexes anybody else here
[1:03:55] ever had a complex you don't have to
[1:03:56] raise your hand but you know what I'm
[1:03:58] talking about we get situations in our
[1:04:01] lives maybe where we're mistreated in a
[1:04:03] certain circumstance and will never ever
[1:04:05] allow ourselves to be in that situation
[1:04:08] again because of the level of
[1:04:09] embarrassment or or fear or whatever it
[1:04:12] is that we encountered you can't say
[1:04:14] that that's not a psychological thing it
[1:04:16] is
[1:04:18] but we're not preaching psychology we're
[1:04:20] preaching a God that can heal a mind
[1:04:22] that he can heal a body and he can save
[1:04:25] a soul
[1:04:26] he's the creator of the entire body and
[1:04:29] all of those are parts of the body
[1:04:33] but this is what they were going through
[1:04:35] a psychological method to change them
[1:04:37] into different people
[1:04:39] and I just got thinking about this you
[1:04:41] know don't we live in a world that's
[1:04:42] like that we go through a psychological
[1:04:44] method to reprogram ourselves
[1:04:47] into different people
[1:04:49] and and we we go from being children
[1:04:52] where we have just maybe a happy life
[1:04:54] and sometimes our lives are happy all
[1:04:56] the way along
[1:04:57] but sometimes we have circumstances
[1:04:59] where we go from the innocence of a
[1:05:01] child to
[1:05:03] a terrible World call it a a Babylon
[1:05:06] experience with a king
[1:05:09] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:05:10] and will say the devil in place of
[1:05:13] Nebuchadnezzar that's ruthless that has
[1:05:16] no care or concern for our emotions or
[1:05:18] our well-being or our feelings that
[1:05:20] wants to destroy us
[1:05:22] but you know what we have Angels
[1:05:25] encountered about those who fear Him so
[1:05:27] he can't touch us he can't destroy us
[1:05:29] but he can mold us and shape us and we
[1:05:32] can be assured that God will allow him
[1:05:34] God will tell the Nebuchadnezzar of
[1:05:36] today I want you to mold these children
[1:05:38] because it's going to bring forth my
[1:05:40] purpose it's going to change them into
[1:05:42] the way that I want them to be
[1:05:45] we know that that that brother Branham
[1:05:47] said it very clearly to us and I'm sure
[1:05:49] other people have said it too the only
[1:05:51] thing that we're going to take with us
[1:05:52] to the other side is our character
[1:05:55] and the character that we have when we
[1:05:57] leave this world it's not a gift
[1:06:00] we can't just say that someone gave me
[1:06:02] this great character I had such an
[1:06:04] amazing mother and and my father was so
[1:06:07] good they were both so successful and
[1:06:09] they did such wonderful things for the
[1:06:11] whole entire world and I have those
[1:06:13] genetics and so I'm going to take their
[1:06:15] character that blend with me no that's
[1:06:18] not the way it works is it it's it's
[1:06:20] what molds us and shapes us it's it's
[1:06:22] that refiners fire it's that metal that
[1:06:26] gets heated up pulled out and beaten and
[1:06:30] then heated up and pulled out and beaten
[1:06:33] and folded and heated up and pulled out
[1:06:36] and beaten and folded and continually
[1:06:38] done that way that's what's gonna happen
[1:06:41] until he sees his image in that metal
[1:06:44] brothers and sisters that's what we're
[1:06:46] dealing with that's that's what's
[1:06:47] Happening Here but will never be
[1:06:50] destroyed we'll be beaten down maybe a
[1:06:52] little bit but we'll never be destroyed
[1:06:54] remember we've said it we I remember
[1:06:56] brother Ken saying it you know we're
[1:06:58] either we're either up or we're getting
[1:06:59] up but we're never down
[1:07:01] never completely down
[1:07:03] but here we have a name and I just think
[1:07:07] it's important looking at this this
[1:07:08] scripture here tonight the story that
[1:07:10] we've read if we're not careful
[1:07:11] sometimes we can acquire a little bit of
[1:07:14] a different name in our own minds we can
[1:07:16] develop a little bit of a complex and we
[1:07:19] know that we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:07:20] God that's what the word of God says but
[1:07:22] the devil is going to tell us no you're
[1:07:23] not you're a failure you should have
[1:07:25] done this or or no you're not you're a
[1:07:28] cheater you actually did this wrong you
[1:07:30] you go you you could have done it
[1:07:32] different but you never did and unless
[1:07:34] we deal with those things properly
[1:07:36] brothers and sisters they're going to be
[1:07:37] there in the back of our mind and
[1:07:39] Satan's always going to have that voice
[1:07:41] but boy oh boy when that time appointed
[1:07:43] of the father comes that we can just
[1:07:44] drive it down we can deal with that
[1:07:46] problem properly
[1:07:48] we can eliminate that entire voice from
[1:07:51] our minds
[1:07:53] sometimes we can have a complex about
[1:07:54] our identity and that's what they wanted
[1:07:56] to do to the children here in in in the
[1:07:59] Book of Daniel the very beginning and
[1:08:02] you know it's interesting because they
[1:08:04] had already learned about the Lord they
[1:08:08] had already been taught about the ways
[1:08:10] of this gospel they knew exactly who
[1:08:13] they were when they went into Babylon
[1:08:16] I think it's beautiful in in in Daniel
[1:08:20] chapter 1
[1:08:22] one of the next things that happened to
[1:08:24] them after their names were changed they
[1:08:27] had a name change one of the next things
[1:08:29] that happened was they said you know
[1:08:30] what now you're no longer in your land
[1:08:32] you get to eat the best food the most
[1:08:36] organic food out of every single
[1:08:38] province in the Kingdom
[1:08:41] nobody has food as good as the King's
[1:08:44] food and you're going to eat it and and
[1:08:47] everyone else in the country said sure
[1:08:49] we'll eat it even the brothers and
[1:08:51] sisters the ones who were Jews
[1:08:54] they ate this food
[1:08:56] but there was a few that said nope we
[1:08:59] won't touch this food because we know
[1:09:00] that it's unclean it's sacrificed unto
[1:09:02] Idols it's killed the wrong way it's the
[1:09:06] wrong meat we can't eat this meat we
[1:09:08] can't eat this food
[1:09:10] we know that that's what males are the
[1:09:12] the the the the steward for the king he
[1:09:15] came and told them that's what you're
[1:09:16] going to do everyone's gonna do it so
[1:09:18] get on board and they stood up there and
[1:09:21] said nope we're not doing it we're not
[1:09:24] gonna we're just gonna starve if that's
[1:09:25] what we got to do but you know what they
[1:09:27] said they said prove thy servants I
[1:09:29] beseech thee 10 days and let them give
[1:09:32] us just pulse to eat
[1:09:34] and we know that that's a grain just
[1:09:35] just a a vegetable
[1:09:38] just just a a green vegetable just
[1:09:41] grind it up and eat it with water just
[1:09:43] give us this pulse to eat with the water
[1:09:45] and and just see if our countenances
[1:09:48] don't look good
[1:09:50] and you know what they did they were
[1:09:52] proving God in that moment they were
[1:09:55] saying that we don't serve a god of our
[1:09:57] imagination we serve a living God you
[1:09:59] didn't just bring children of Israel
[1:10:01] here you brought the god of Israel here
[1:10:05] is what they were telling the steward of
[1:10:07] the king and and he must have been
[1:10:09] miffed he must have been mystified at
[1:10:12] this situation he was really concerned
[1:10:14] because he said hey you know what I
[1:10:16] can't mess around with this the king
[1:10:17] said to feed you the best and if I don't
[1:10:19] feed you the best and now there's a
[1:10:21] problem what's gonna happen is he's
[1:10:22] gonna take my head off because this is a
[1:10:24] king that's ruthless you got to
[1:10:25] understand this so what he did was he
[1:10:27] took a real big chance and you can
[1:10:30] imagine that there was an anointing that
[1:10:32] came around that man those boys had some
[1:10:34] prayer for that anointing to come down
[1:10:36] but we know that they said that our
[1:10:38] accountances be looked on in 10 days
[1:10:40] come back and see and we know that the
[1:10:42] end of ten days their countenances
[1:10:43] appeared bad fairer and fatter in flesh
[1:10:47] than all the children which did eat the
[1:10:50] portion of of the king's meat so there
[1:10:52] was other Jews that were eating all of
[1:10:53] that perfectly organic beautiful best of
[1:10:56] the country food
[1:10:58] and their countenances didn't Prosper
[1:11:01] nearly as much as these three that
[1:11:04] committed it to the Lord isn't that
[1:11:06] interesting and you know what happened
[1:11:07] after that the steward of the king
[1:11:10] melzar he took away the portion of the
[1:11:13] meat and the and the wine that all of
[1:11:15] these other Jews were drinking and said
[1:11:18] give them pulse look what it does to
[1:11:20] them can you imagine that they went from
[1:11:24] living high on the hog to eating pulse
[1:11:27] just like the believer
[1:11:29] it's beautiful
[1:11:31] but that's the way God does it isn't it
[1:11:33] he just wants to be proved he's just
[1:11:35] waiting for us to say prove yourself God
[1:11:37] we just want you to prove yourself God
[1:11:39] we're not looking for signs or wonders
[1:11:41] but when the circumstances and
[1:11:42] situations come up when Nebuchadnezzar
[1:11:44] tries to tell us this is how it's going
[1:11:46] to be we're gonna say no it ain't we're
[1:11:49] going to serve the god of Heaven we're
[1:11:51] going to serve the God of this word
[1:11:52] we're not going to serve the God of this
[1:11:54] land
[1:11:56] verse 17 of of chapter 1 says as for
[1:12:00] these four children God gave them
[1:12:02] knowledge and skill in all learning and
[1:12:06] wisdom
[1:12:07] and Daniel had understanding in all
[1:12:10] visions and dreams
[1:12:12] it's just beautiful to look at these
[1:12:15] children how they came in and
[1:12:16] immediately they stood out and what made
[1:12:19] them Stand Out brothers and sisters this
[1:12:20] is what really encourages me it's it's
[1:12:22] what I need remember when I talk like
[1:12:24] this I'm preaching to myself I'm I'm
[1:12:26] getting encouragement out of this what
[1:12:28] changed them what set them apart from
[1:12:30] everyone else is they weren't afraid to
[1:12:32] stand up for the testimony of this word
[1:12:34] they weren't afraid to stand in their
[1:12:37] positions because they know their God
[1:12:40] they knew their God they knew exactly
[1:12:42] who they were we know then we go into
[1:12:44] chapter two and and the next one was the
[1:12:47] king had the dream
[1:12:49] remember the dream
[1:12:51] and and Daniel gives the interpretation
[1:12:53] of it but first the king says you know
[1:12:56] what let's let's call in all the
[1:12:58] musicians or the The Magicians and the
[1:13:00] and the wise men and the sorcerers let's
[1:13:02] get everyone in here and tell me this
[1:13:04] dream I can't believe that I had this
[1:13:06] dream and they all came in at the
[1:13:08] command of the king and the King says
[1:13:10] you know tell me what's going on here
[1:13:11] and they say well first king just just
[1:13:14] tell us the dream and and then we'll be
[1:13:16] able to help you we'll be able to give
[1:13:18] you the interpretation he's like if
[1:13:19] you're not magicians and Sorcerers you
[1:13:21] tell me the dream
[1:13:23] you give me the interpretation it's gone
[1:13:25] from me I don't know why we pay you guys
[1:13:28] who are you guys why are you even here
[1:13:30] you call yourself a sorcerer or a
[1:13:32] magician tell me the interpretation of
[1:13:34] it in fact if you don't tell me the
[1:13:36] interpretation of it then what's going
[1:13:38] to happen this was his Hallmark for the
[1:13:40] people that he cared for that he loved
[1:13:42] that your families will be killed and
[1:13:44] your houses will be turned into
[1:13:45] dunghills this was the king they were
[1:13:48] serving
[1:13:50] can you imagine that
[1:13:53] but Daniel
[1:13:55] he took a different approach didn't he
[1:13:58] he stood up
[1:14:01] he stood up and he said you know O King
[1:14:03] live forever
[1:14:05] just give us a little bit of time just
[1:14:08] give me a little bit of time in prayer
[1:14:09] alone with my God just just let me have
[1:14:12] a conversation with him let us go have a
[1:14:14] little prayer meeting and and we'll just
[1:14:17] see if we can't actually tell you and we
[1:14:19] know the story we know it well he went
[1:14:21] had the prayer meeting came back and and
[1:14:23] after Consulting the god of Heaven he
[1:14:25] told them exactly what the dream was he
[1:14:28] told them exactly what the
[1:14:29] interpretation was thereof and we know
[1:14:32] because of that all of them were
[1:14:34] appointed to the highest positions in
[1:14:36] the land
[1:14:37] and you know brothers and sisters that's
[1:14:39] where we start our story tonight
[1:14:41] and we're only like half an hour
[1:14:44] praise the Lord I just think it's so
[1:14:46] beautiful this story is amazing when you
[1:14:49] think about it because here they are
[1:14:51] these children they're they're taken
[1:14:53] from their land they're they're told all
[1:14:55] these different things that they have to
[1:14:56] do and they just won't bow down for a
[1:14:58] second not one thing will cause them to
[1:15:00] change their countenance not one thing
[1:15:02] will change their testimony
[1:15:05] and did not God reward them took them to
[1:15:07] the highest position in the land and now
[1:15:10] when they're in the highest position of
[1:15:12] the land that's why I wanted to point it
[1:15:13] out brothers and sisters it's not like
[1:15:15] they were just part of all the other
[1:15:17] children of Israel that came out of the
[1:15:19] land in captivity
[1:15:23] you would have to imagine it would be
[1:15:24] real easy for the rest of them to be
[1:15:26] able to just hide
[1:15:27] and and not really
[1:15:29] shine not really be visible
[1:15:33] but these ones
[1:15:34] were governing the provinces of the land
[1:15:38] I can only imagine that they were on a
[1:15:40] bit of a Podium with some of the other
[1:15:41] leaders and and judges and and and
[1:15:45] rulers of the lands
[1:15:47] so when it came time for them to follow
[1:15:49] the instructions of the king to bow down
[1:15:51] to this image
[1:15:53] they stood out
[1:15:55] you know I just can't help but think
[1:15:56] brothers and sisters we're coming to
[1:15:58] that place rapidly very rapidly where
[1:16:01] we're going to stand out way more than
[1:16:03] we do now
[1:16:04] a lot of the sisters stand out but you
[1:16:07] know we're coming to the place where
[1:16:08] we're going to be told if you don't
[1:16:09] believe it this way
[1:16:11] there's going to be a problem
[1:16:13] and and you know I think it'll be
[1:16:15] beautiful because we'll all of a sudden
[1:16:17] just like that we'll all be a whole lot
[1:16:19] more alike than we are different
[1:16:22] all of these fences that we had talked
[1:16:25] about will disappear you know where I
[1:16:27] brought a quote when I was in Saskatoon
[1:16:29] when we drove North to Edmonton the the
[1:16:32] fields up there are just tremendous the
[1:16:34] crops are huge north of Red Deer onwards
[1:16:38] there's corn crops there I bet you
[1:16:40] they're about eight feet tall they're
[1:16:42] ginormous I didn't think you could grow
[1:16:44] corn like that here but you know there's
[1:16:46] a quote that brother Branham talks about
[1:16:47] about an aviator flying a plane and and
[1:16:51] how he looked down and he could see the
[1:16:53] different crops and the different fields
[1:16:55] and and the fences dividing it and he
[1:16:58] said you know what happens The Aviator
[1:17:00] said this I guess to brother Brown what
[1:17:02] happens is eventually those crops grow
[1:17:04] up and when those crops grow up and
[1:17:06] mature they actually cover over the
[1:17:09] fences and you can't see the fences all
[1:17:11] you see is one big crop of corn and
[1:17:14] brother badam says I think that's the
[1:17:15] way it is with the church today I think
[1:17:17] it's exactly like that we just need to
[1:17:19] mature a little bit and as we mature all
[1:17:21] of these little offenses these little
[1:17:23] things these pet doctrines that get in
[1:17:25] the way of our lives our maturity
[1:17:27] they'll just disappear as we mature
[1:17:29] because we'll all just be one crop and
[1:17:32] we know that's what it is it's one body
[1:17:34] it's one bride of Jesus Christ it's not
[1:17:37] multi-brides all over the place it's one
[1:17:40] bride
[1:17:41] but going back to our story here
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:45] the uh Hebrew Boys in uh in the fiery
[1:17:48] furnace we know that they were they were
[1:17:51] given the opportunity even
[1:17:53] first they were identified by the
[1:17:55] accusers the accusers oh they caught
[1:17:57] them red-handed they weren't falling
[1:17:59] down at this image and and I'd like to
[1:18:01] get into the image a little bit you know
[1:18:03] brother Branham said what that image was
[1:18:04] the whole entire world runs after the
[1:18:07] idea that that image was an image of
[1:18:09] Nebuchadnezzar but it took a prophet to
[1:18:12] actually say hold on a second boys where
[1:18:14] does it say in the Bible that that was
[1:18:15] an image of Nebuchadnezzar that was an
[1:18:18] image that Nebuchadnezzar created
[1:18:21] it was a golden image but that image was
[1:18:25] actually of this man the prophet and
[1:18:27] isn't it interesting that it was that
[1:18:29] man the prophet and isn't it interesting
[1:18:32] that these Hebrew children that stood on
[1:18:34] their testimony real strong would not
[1:18:36] bow down to the image of the prophet
[1:18:41] because as soon as you do that you make
[1:18:43] that profit Antichrist
[1:18:48] but here we have these Hebrew children
[1:18:50] they're not interested in
[1:18:52] bowing down to an image of a man
[1:18:55] at all they're only interested in bowing
[1:18:58] down to the image of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:00] Christ
[1:19:01] and that is the word
[1:19:03] and you know when they actually were
[1:19:06] told to come and talk to the king get up
[1:19:09] here we want to talk to you
[1:19:10] I I thought it was real interesting I
[1:19:12] was having a conversation with someone a
[1:19:14] while back about this you know and these
[1:19:16] Hebrew children raced to the highest
[1:19:19] positions in the land they understood a
[1:19:21] whole lot about dealing with the King
[1:19:23] they understood what it meant to stand
[1:19:25] in the king's court you only addressed
[1:19:28] the king when you were told to address
[1:19:30] the king you only spoke to the king a
[1:19:32] very certain way you did not just hang
[1:19:35] out and do whatever you wanted to do it
[1:19:37] was exactly the way Nebuchadnezzar
[1:19:40] wanted it and isn't it interesting to
[1:19:42] think that those ones that were the
[1:19:44] highest position of the land they said
[1:19:45] King O King live forever but we're not
[1:19:48] going to be careful how we answer you
[1:19:50] we're not going to be careful every
[1:19:52] other time they would be careful how
[1:19:54] they answered that King because their
[1:19:55] lives would depend upon it but this time
[1:19:58] it doesn't matter what you say doesn't
[1:20:00] matter what you do we're not going to be
[1:20:02] careful we're going to tell you the
[1:20:03] truth we're going to speak this word
[1:20:05] we're going to preach the Gospel of
[1:20:06] Jesus Christ to you today
[1:20:09] you know out of an absolute 1963-0304
[1:20:15] the Hebrew children
[1:20:18] they would be thrown into a fiery
[1:20:19] furnace that would be burned with heat
[1:20:22] seven times hotter than the furnace had
[1:20:24] ever had
[1:20:27] that Hebrew children believed God they
[1:20:30] said our God is able to Deliver Us from
[1:20:31] this furnace why
[1:20:33] they had an absolute
[1:20:36] they had the word of God
[1:20:39] and the god that could deliver them
[1:20:41] Hebrew children from the death cell of a
[1:20:45] fiery furnace
[1:20:47] how much more can he deliver this little
[1:20:49] Jewish boy out here that's laying Yonder
[1:20:52] in a death cell
[1:20:54] how much more is he and he's still the
[1:20:57] same Jehovah God that he always was
[1:21:00] and I want to say this if that's the
[1:21:02] case brothers and sisters then he's
[1:21:04] still the same Jehovah God that could
[1:21:06] deliver any one of us out of any one of
[1:21:09] these death cells that we get ourselves
[1:21:10] into any one of the fiery furnaces that
[1:21:13] we encounter in our lives
[1:21:15] he's the same
[1:21:17] same God
[1:21:21] many times we'll say the same yesterday
[1:21:23] today and forever but the round says it
[1:21:24] here and he's still the same Jehovah God
[1:21:26] that he always was we like the Apostle
[1:21:29] Paul can realize that same God lives
[1:21:33] today yesterday today and forever the
[1:21:36] same
[1:21:37] then Christians can hold on to God's
[1:21:40] unchanging hand
[1:21:41] and change the whole situation
[1:21:45] Prayer Changes Things that's what we
[1:21:48] want to do
[1:21:50] I just want to throw this out there
[1:21:52] brothers and sisters
[1:21:53] this last little part here
[1:21:56] we're able to hold God's unchanging hand
[1:21:59] and change the whole situation if we
[1:22:01] want to
[1:22:02] Prayer Changes Things
[1:22:05] Satan wants to tell us we're too busy
[1:22:07] Satan wants to tell us
[1:22:09] we've had Church four times this month
[1:22:12] maybe five or six
[1:22:15] Satan wants to tell us
[1:22:17] we don't get anything out of it anyways
[1:22:20] how do you know
[1:22:23] I was talking to someone earlier
[1:22:25] and we're talking about prayer we're
[1:22:27] talking about tithing we're talking
[1:22:30] about our behavior and we've said it in
[1:22:31] the past but I'll say it tonight
[1:22:33] brothers and sisters that our actions
[1:22:35] today
[1:22:36] aren't are access towards God aren't
[1:22:39] just like uh the lives that we live
[1:22:41] where we have instant gratification on
[1:22:44] social media or an instant return on an
[1:22:47] email that we're eager to get a response
[1:22:49] from or or someone picking up the phone
[1:22:51] our prayers work in a different way our
[1:22:55] prayers will be answered every single
[1:22:57] time but it might be some time
[1:22:59] and it might not even be us that
[1:23:01] receives the blessing from those prayers
[1:23:03] it might be our children that receive
[1:23:05] the blessings for our prayers
[1:23:09] oh my or our lack thereof
[1:23:13] don't let life stand in the way of
[1:23:15] prayer brothers and sisters I say Lord
[1:23:18] help me
[1:23:19] help me
[1:23:21] I don't want to act I'm not trying to
[1:23:23] portray A Perfect Image here brothers
[1:23:24] and sisters I don't pray as much as I
[1:23:26] would like to as much as I feel like I
[1:23:28] should and I would say pray for me that
[1:23:30] that would change in my life because I
[1:23:32] believe there's a tremendous opportunity
[1:23:35] in prayer you know brother Bradham said
[1:23:37] that's the greatest weapon that the
[1:23:38] Christian has don't get me wrong it's
[1:23:40] not like I don't pray I do pray but I
[1:23:42] always feel like I should pray more we
[1:23:45] know that Paul says to pray without
[1:23:46] ceasing and that wasn't just Paul that
[1:23:48] was God speaking through Paul
[1:23:52] I just think this story tonight is so
[1:23:54] beautiful on so many different levels
[1:23:56] to think that they would just say to the
[1:23:58] king you know what it doesn't matter
[1:23:59] what you think we're just not going to
[1:24:00] be careful to answer you we're going to
[1:24:02] speak our minds you're going to hear the
[1:24:05] whole truth we're not going to shun to
[1:24:07] declare the entire gospel unto you
[1:24:10] tonight
[1:24:12] but it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't the
[1:24:14] the accusers coming to them directly was
[1:24:17] it they didn't just come to them and say
[1:24:18] you know what you know you know you need
[1:24:19] to be doing this you better get down and
[1:24:21] and worship this image no they went
[1:24:23] right to the king they went right for
[1:24:24] the juggler and what did they do they
[1:24:26] pushed his buttons didn't they they
[1:24:28] pushed his buttons in such a way that it
[1:24:31] caused rage and fury to come up in the
[1:24:34] king they knew exactly how to get them
[1:24:36] going and that's exactly what they did
[1:24:38] but we know that even though he took and
[1:24:41] made that furnace seven times harder he
[1:24:42] could have made it 20 times hotter than
[1:24:44] it wouldn't have mattered brother
[1:24:45] Branham says somewhere and one of the
[1:24:46] quotes that you know how hot it was you
[1:24:49] couldn't get within a hundred yards of
[1:24:51] that furnace
[1:24:52] 100 yards of that furnace or it would
[1:24:55] burn you up and remember it was the most
[1:24:58] Valiant men of the army of the military
[1:25:00] that the king chose and while they
[1:25:03] carried them up there what happened to
[1:25:05] them they fried because it was hot it
[1:25:07] was real hot and I just can't help but
[1:25:09] think the parallel brothers and sisters
[1:25:12] that's where we are today isn't it
[1:25:13] spiritually speaking the furnace has
[1:25:16] been stoked seven times hotter we know
[1:25:18] that Satan is is going about as a
[1:25:21] roaring lion seeing whom he can devour
[1:25:23] but we know that we have a prophet in
[1:25:25] our day that said he's toothless he
[1:25:27] doesn't have teeth but he's going about
[1:25:29] to see who he can destroy who he can
[1:25:32] actually get after
[1:25:34] and he doesn't care he's ruthless just
[1:25:36] like this King Nebuchadnezzar but we
[1:25:39] know that all of the spirits are against
[1:25:40] us oh my it's hot spiritually speaking
[1:25:44] brothers and sisters it is a hot day
[1:25:46] spiritually speaking all of the spirits
[1:25:49] the lid of hell was taken off is what
[1:25:51] brother Branham said and here we are
[1:25:54] standing in the midst of that fiery
[1:25:56] furnace and we know that as we stand in
[1:25:58] the midst of this furnace there is a
[1:26:00] fourth one in the fire and you know we
[1:26:03] have the opportunity to know him and
[1:26:05] isn't it beautiful we look at this story
[1:26:07] I'm kind of bouncing all over the place
[1:26:08] I hope it's okay I'm just preaching
[1:26:10] tonight but to look at this story and
[1:26:12] think that you know what it tells that
[1:26:14] when they went into the fire they had
[1:26:15] all of their garments on all of them
[1:26:19] shouldn't all of it have burnt
[1:26:22] but not one hair on their body was
[1:26:25] singed we know that not one part of
[1:26:28] their garment had a little coal mark on
[1:26:30] it or a little tiny burn mark and and it
[1:26:33] didn't even have the smell of smoke when
[1:26:36] they came out of that furnace
[1:26:38] and I just can't help but think brothers
[1:26:39] and sisters we have all been given Robes
[1:26:42] of his righteousness
[1:26:44] there's not one of us that are going to
[1:26:47] come out the other side with a burn from
[1:26:49] this fire from from this seven times
[1:26:52] hotter fire not one of us will come out
[1:26:54] that way
[1:26:55] in 1963 remembering the Lord Brother
[1:26:58] Brown I'm talking about this story
[1:27:01] he says then we could call another group
[1:27:03] of people or at least I'd say three
[1:27:06] and they were Shadrach Meshach and
[1:27:08] Abednego
[1:27:10] how that they had took their stand for
[1:27:12] God
[1:27:13] remembering that he keeps his promise
[1:27:16] I want to say that tonight brothers and
[1:27:18] sisters just remember he keeps his
[1:27:20] promise
[1:27:22] it's not up to us to activate his
[1:27:24] promise he keeps his promise
[1:27:29] and how that in this great hour
[1:27:31] because of their stand even their own
[1:27:34] Brethren many of them had turned off
[1:27:37] into the world
[1:27:40] I I just I could talk about that but
[1:27:45] but they were going
[1:27:47] to stand regardless and they took a
[1:27:50] stand for God
[1:27:53] and when the furnace was hit seven times
[1:27:55] hotter than it was ever hit before
[1:27:58] and they was pushed into this furnace
[1:28:01] see they didn't want to go into the
[1:28:03] furnace did they
[1:28:05] they were pushed into it
[1:28:08] I don't think any one of us wanted to be
[1:28:10] in the spiritual furnace did we
[1:28:12] were pushed into it
[1:28:14] we're pushed into it because we make a
[1:28:16] stand
[1:28:17] and in the midst of it we can make a
[1:28:20] stand and I think it's beautiful in this
[1:28:22] story it shows that they were thrown in
[1:28:25] and that they fell into it
[1:28:28] but somehow they were standing in the
[1:28:30] midst of the Flames they were standing
[1:28:33] with that fourth one even though they
[1:28:34] fell
[1:28:37] and they can certainly remember that
[1:28:39] Fourth Man was there with them that kept
[1:28:43] all the Heat and death away from them
[1:28:46] there's something about that Fourth Man
[1:28:49] might talk about him a while yes sir
[1:28:52] how that he was the only one could make
[1:28:55] that possible
[1:28:58] can you think about that for a sec
[1:29:00] how you could just be in the midst of a
[1:29:03] furnace like that so hot
[1:29:06] how on Earth is that even possible it
[1:29:08] just defies all nature
[1:29:11] it's 100 percent Supernatural isn't it
[1:29:16] but this is a story this is a real story
[1:29:18] We believe this to be an actual account
[1:29:20] of human beings
[1:29:22] an attempted destruction of the Bride of
[1:29:25] Jesus Christ
[1:29:26] he was the only one that could make that
[1:29:29] possible and he's the only one that can
[1:29:30] make it possible for us today brothers
[1:29:32] and sisters there was no other person
[1:29:34] could do it but that Fourth Man and he
[1:29:38] was the one that provided life in the
[1:29:40] jaws of death
[1:29:42] amen and he kept the fire blazes back
[1:29:46] and preserved them
[1:29:48] can you imagine what it would be like to
[1:29:49] be thrown on the fire and think that you
[1:29:52] know what we just we're gonna stand on
[1:29:54] this word I was just meditating on this
[1:29:56] those those Hebrew kids uh you know what
[1:29:58] we're gonna die today that's what's
[1:30:00] gonna happen because that's the king
[1:30:02] that we serve the king that we've been
[1:30:04] forced to come and serve he is going to
[1:30:06] do us in today and you know what he's
[1:30:08] going to make the furnace seven times
[1:30:09] hotter guys so I guess it'll be seven
[1:30:11] times faster that will die we'll burn up
[1:30:14] can you imagine what it'd be like to
[1:30:16] walk the plank with those men those
[1:30:18] Mighty Men and to see them fall and
[1:30:20] scream from the Heat and and they fall
[1:30:23] down and die and as they fall down and
[1:30:25] die they push shove you in and as you go
[1:30:28] in you wind up landing on the ground
[1:30:30] probably felt like a a air cushion or
[1:30:34] something not a hard ground but an air
[1:30:36] cushion something that would just be
[1:30:37] soft and give you the ability to wonder
[1:30:40] what just happened aren't I supposed to
[1:30:42] be dead aren't I supposed to be in the
[1:30:43] fire look at those guys that threw us in
[1:30:45] they're dead out there and look at
[1:30:47] everyone else they're looking so
[1:30:48] intently at us inside this furnace but
[1:30:51] but here we are are we supposed to be
[1:30:53] thinking like this when we're dead is
[1:30:55] this what being dead feels like
[1:30:58] I've never been in a fire every time
[1:31:00] I've gone close to fire it really hurts
[1:31:02] look at those men laying there it must
[1:31:04] have really hurt them but here we are
[1:31:05] inside this fire we're still alive can
[1:31:08] you hear me yeah I can hear you can you
[1:31:11] hear me yeah shouldn't we be dead
[1:31:14] and then oh my
[1:31:16] to see someone else there
[1:31:18] in that fire
[1:31:21] to see the one that looks like the son
[1:31:24] of man in that fire
[1:31:26] can you imagine that
[1:31:29] to look at it and think that somehow all
[1:31:32] of this is defying logic how could this
[1:31:34] possibly be and then to have the king
[1:31:37] come and say you
[1:31:40] come out
[1:31:42] my goodness
[1:31:47] and he kept the fire blazes back and
[1:31:49] preserved them and oh as long as there
[1:31:52] can be a memory and it'll Never Fade Out
[1:31:55] so that they can remember that great day
[1:31:58] down in Babylon
[1:32:01] brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:32:03] encourage us when the fires come up
[1:32:05] around us when we see it we've got to
[1:32:07] walk into that furnace there's times
[1:32:08] where we'll have to where we can't
[1:32:10] escape it he will be there in that fire
[1:32:13] he won't be a moment too late he will be
[1:32:16] there exactly when we need him there
[1:32:20] present stage of my Ministry in 1962.
[1:32:25] yes it was the Hebrew children under the
[1:32:28] reign of Nebuchadnezzar
[1:32:31] when they wouldn't bow to the image
[1:32:33] I just think it's beautiful as we read
[1:32:35] this you know how I just we know that
[1:32:38] there's an account given in heaven for
[1:32:40] all of this exactly the way it is the
[1:32:43] way it is written and and the way that
[1:32:45] it's experienced in our lives he says
[1:32:47] yes it was the Hebrew children under the
[1:32:49] reign of Nebuchadnezzar
[1:32:54] when they wouldn't bow to the image
[1:32:57] they stayed true
[1:32:59] to the god to God because God's word
[1:33:03] said don't bow before any image
[1:33:07] to worship it
[1:33:09] they stayed true to the word
[1:33:12] I think it's so critical for us to stay
[1:33:14] true to the word
[1:33:16] we don't want to put any man
[1:33:19] we don't want to put any Ministry
[1:33:21] including a prophet on a pedestal
[1:33:25] we understand the prophetic office
[1:33:28] we understand the offices according to
[1:33:30] the word but nobody deserves worship
[1:33:33] except for God remember John in the Book
[1:33:36] of Revelation when he was caught up into
[1:33:39] heaven when he saw that door open and he
[1:33:41] went up a little higher when he was
[1:33:44] there two times in the Book of
[1:33:45] Revelations while he was there in that
[1:33:47] other dimension he tried to worship an
[1:33:49] angel
[1:33:51] and that angel told him no John
[1:33:54] see thou do it not
[1:33:56] because I'm just your fellow servant I'm
[1:33:58] just a man just like you just worship
[1:34:00] God just worship God he's the one that
[1:34:03] deserves all of our worship
[1:34:05] they stayed true
[1:34:07] to God because God's word said don't bow
[1:34:10] before any image to worship it they
[1:34:12] stayed true to the word and it was in
[1:34:15] the local paper in the news all about it
[1:34:17] whatever it was in them days they had
[1:34:20] ways to scatter news
[1:34:22] not in a local newspaper of course not
[1:34:24] just saying that so you'll have some
[1:34:27] idea
[1:34:28] but it was there
[1:34:30] was going to burn them in the fiery
[1:34:32] furnace seven times hotter
[1:34:35] sounds like they made a spectacle out of
[1:34:38] it sounds like they really wanted to
[1:34:40] make it a bit of a festival they're
[1:34:42] going to make an example out of them
[1:34:43] don't don't don't embarrass the king
[1:34:45] don't don't don't cross him but here
[1:34:48] they were
[1:34:50] but it was in there they was going to
[1:34:52] burn them in the fiery furnace seven
[1:34:54] times hotter for days before that they
[1:34:58] thrown in all the material to get that
[1:35:00] furnace so hot that it was seven times
[1:35:02] hotter overheated seven times
[1:35:06] why it would have consumed them to get
[1:35:08] in a hundred yards of it but they went
[1:35:11] right in the fiery furnace and come
[1:35:13] right out without even any smell of fire
[1:35:16] on them
[1:35:17] and Nebuchadnezzar said
[1:35:19] every man that fails to worship this God
[1:35:23] let his children and him be killed his
[1:35:27] house burned and made a dung Hill
[1:35:30] his Hallmark
[1:35:31] the way that he likes to make an example
[1:35:33] of people what a tyrant
[1:35:36] that's right see they had a worldwide
[1:35:40] Revival because they were true to the
[1:35:42] word that's what happens yes sir
[1:35:45] stay true to the word yes and it always
[1:35:47] pays out wonderful
[1:35:49] I just have been so encouraged by even
[1:35:51] this quote alone brothers and sisters
[1:35:53] just to stay true to the word and and
[1:35:56] watch it start a Revival Watch people
[1:35:58] get encouraged by it and some people get
[1:36:01] discouraged by it you know what it's not
[1:36:02] up to us to to bring people in or or put
[1:36:05] people out it's up to us to stay true to
[1:36:07] the word and let the word do the Sorting
[1:36:09] because it's the word of God that's
[1:36:11] sharper than any two-edged sword it's
[1:36:14] not the man it's not up to the man to do
[1:36:16] that and uh yeah I think it's just
[1:36:18] beautiful and we can stay true to that
[1:36:20] word just say what the prophet said
[1:36:22] that's all we got to do we heard brother
[1:36:24] Andrew Glover say it just say what the
[1:36:25] prophet said I think it's so beautiful
[1:36:27] how he heard that did he talk about that
[1:36:31] testimony from Brother Wayne was that in
[1:36:33] person or was that from the pulpit I'll
[1:36:35] tell it from the pulpit though I think
[1:36:37] it's so beautiful when he was starting
[1:36:38] in his ministry he was like how do I
[1:36:40] preach to the people how do I get the
[1:36:42] the Mysteries to people how do I get
[1:36:44] this richness out to the people of the
[1:36:46] message of the hour and he said you want
[1:36:48] to speak something new you want to
[1:36:49] preach something new you just preach
[1:36:50] what the prophet said because most
[1:36:52] people aren't doing that anymore I
[1:36:54] thought wow that's incredible just
[1:36:56] preach what the prophet said because
[1:36:57] people don't do that anymore they want
[1:36:59] to put a spin on it and have an edge on
[1:37:01] it and try and make it something
[1:37:02] different that's not what it is brothers
[1:37:04] and sisters that's going to lead us into
[1:37:06] destruction what the prophet said is
[1:37:08] what the word said because he said you
[1:37:09] know what I preach what Paul preached
[1:37:11] that's that's the only thing that's
[1:37:12] going to get us out of here we know that
[1:37:14] Paul said it twice in the word if if if
[1:37:16] me or an angel ever come and say
[1:37:19] anything different to this word then let
[1:37:22] him be accursed
[1:37:24] if we try and put our own spin on that's
[1:37:26] going to bring destruction
[1:37:28] out of paradox in 61 brother Branham
[1:37:30] said it was a paradox when the Hebrew
[1:37:32] children that had decided they would
[1:37:34] stay with God's word remember the
[1:37:37] Paradox is something that's incredible
[1:37:39] but yet it's true
[1:37:40] and I want to say tonight each one of
[1:37:42] you are a paradox brothers and sisters
[1:37:44] because you have the ability to believe
[1:37:46] this word that's incredible but it's
[1:37:49] true
[1:37:52] regardless of what happened
[1:37:54] that the king built the furnace seven
[1:37:56] times hotter than it ever had been had
[1:37:59] and throw those men in there
[1:38:01] where the intense Heat Of The Furnace
[1:38:04] killed the men who walked up the
[1:38:06] Gangplank with them to the mouth of the
[1:38:08] Furnace they died
[1:38:10] but yet those men walked in the furnace
[1:38:13] for perhaps three hours
[1:38:18] got me wondering about that whole story
[1:38:19] that I just talked about and you know
[1:38:22] one part of it could you imagine what it
[1:38:23] would be like to to fall into it and and
[1:38:27] poof the coals go up the hotter coals
[1:38:29] who knows what they use to make the fire
[1:38:31] but to think you've got them on you
[1:38:33] you'd be jumping around maybe because
[1:38:35] you know what's happening but yet you're
[1:38:37] defying all nature
[1:38:39] God is defying all nature with you and
[1:38:41] to maybe just pick up a call and look at
[1:38:43] it
[1:38:44] pick up a log burning and look at it
[1:38:47] maybe hot red hot rocks and look at them
[1:38:50] and think man this is something hey
[1:38:53] had three hours in there
[1:38:56] could it be
[1:38:58] my
[1:39:00] I wonder what they talked about
[1:39:02] I wonder what the Fourth Man In The Fire
[1:39:04] said to them
[1:39:08] but yet those men walked in the furnace
[1:39:10] for perhaps three hours
[1:39:12] there would be no more even dust of them
[1:39:16] for the human life that was in them
[1:39:18] would have perished
[1:39:20] if it made one human life perish by
[1:39:23] coming close to it
[1:39:25] what would it do another human life
[1:39:28] but they throwed them in there
[1:39:30] and let's say three hours it might have
[1:39:33] been five
[1:39:36] he might have went and had lunch and
[1:39:38] come back and said open up the furnace
[1:39:40] door
[1:39:42] there won't even be dust of them fellows
[1:39:44] left
[1:39:46] can you imagine that
[1:39:48] kind of reminds me of the story of
[1:39:50] Daniel it's no different than Daniel and
[1:39:52] and one of the things that he
[1:39:54] encountered
[1:39:56] with another king
[1:39:58] he was told no praying and wasn't it the
[1:40:01] accusers that went to the king and wrote
[1:40:03] the ordinance and and did the whole
[1:40:05] trick for him and he said hey you know
[1:40:07] what I'm not changing one iota I'm gonna
[1:40:09] stay exactly the way that I've been I'm
[1:40:11] gonna pray morning noon and night every
[1:40:13] single day and in fact I'll roll up my
[1:40:15] blinds and you can actually see me in my
[1:40:17] house and that's what I'm gonna do and
[1:40:19] he did it and we know the King was his
[1:40:21] friend but the king couldn't change the
[1:40:23] word could it he couldn't change the law
[1:40:25] that was the law once the law was wrote
[1:40:27] you can't change it at all so Daniel he
[1:40:30] went into the lion's den and this man
[1:40:33] while he was in there we know the angel
[1:40:34] of the Lord another man came and closed
[1:40:37] the mouth of the Lions
[1:40:41] but what happened to the accusers in
[1:40:43] that situation
[1:40:45] it's a pretty sad story
[1:40:46] when you consider it because it says it
[1:40:48] very clearly in the word of God that it
[1:40:50] wasn't just the accusers it was the
[1:40:52] accusers their wives and their children
[1:40:54] were thrown into those lions and those
[1:40:57] Lions they overpowered them those Lions
[1:41:00] consumed that whole group of people
[1:41:03] that's the Mighty God that we serve
[1:41:06] he says here in this quote anyways he
[1:41:07] might have went and had lunch and come
[1:41:09] back and said open up the furniture
[1:41:10] store there won't even be dust for them
[1:41:12] fellows left
[1:41:13] but when he opened the door
[1:41:15] there they were unharmed walking around
[1:41:19] in that fire incredible but true
[1:41:22] paradox why he said how many did you put
[1:41:26] in
[1:41:27] they said we had put three in he said
[1:41:30] but I see four
[1:41:32] that's what made the paradox
[1:41:35] and that one looks like the son of Gods
[1:41:38] he wasn't a son of the Gods he was the
[1:41:42] son of God
[1:41:44] and they were heathens
[1:41:46] oh God in his great word
[1:41:49] I just think tonight brothers and
[1:41:51] sisters this story here it just really
[1:41:54] speaks to me in that here they were told
[1:41:59] to just obey the king just do what the
[1:42:02] king says and it will all be okay and
[1:42:04] multiple times along the way in their
[1:42:06] life's journey they said no way we will
[1:42:08] will obey the king to a certain place
[1:42:10] but you know what we can only go so far
[1:42:12] because we serve our God and you know I
[1:42:15] just think that's the way of the
[1:42:16] believer too we're gonna follow the the
[1:42:19] laws of the land as far as we can but
[1:42:22] when we're forced to actually stop
[1:42:24] actually serving God because of the laws
[1:42:27] of the land what else can we do where do
[1:42:30] we go what do we have
[1:42:32] you know there's many people that are
[1:42:33] actually through coved we got to see
[1:42:35] people rise up and try and cause
[1:42:37] conflict and declare it to be the word
[1:42:40] of God and they're making a stand for
[1:42:41] their rights and all this stuff what
[1:42:44] rights does a lamb being led to a
[1:42:46] Slaughter have
[1:42:47] what rights did Jesus have as he came
[1:42:50] and died for all of our sin he didn't he
[1:42:53] didn't claim to have rights as a lamb
[1:42:56] speechless he was led to the slaughter
[1:42:58] who are we to think that we have rights
[1:43:00] to jump up and down and scream and shout
[1:43:02] and try and make a scene in all in the
[1:43:04] name of Christianity
[1:43:06] the only thing that we need to do is
[1:43:08] just follow the word stay straight on
[1:43:09] that word just believe the word that the
[1:43:11] prophet messenger brought us and you
[1:43:13] know what that's the word that will see
[1:43:14] us through
[1:43:16] we'll still give on to Caesar with
[1:43:18] Caesar's but we'll give God what's God's
[1:43:20] and you know what it might actually not
[1:43:22] be in that order it might be the other
[1:43:24] way around but that's the way it's got
[1:43:26] to be and that's the age that we live in
[1:43:28] this age is is burned kindled seven
[1:43:31] times hotter brothers and sisters
[1:43:32] spiritually speaking than any other age
[1:43:34] and we've been thrown into that fire and
[1:43:37] you know what there is that fourth man
[1:43:38] he is in the fire he's with us every
[1:43:40] step of the way we have big challenges
[1:43:42] we have little challenges we have hot
[1:43:44] fires and we have cold fires but he's
[1:43:47] with us and we don't need to worry we
[1:43:49] just need to trust him we just need to
[1:43:51] follow his word his instruction and you
[1:43:53] know the instruction that was given to
[1:43:55] him these Hebrew kids where did the
[1:43:57] instruction come from they knew where
[1:43:59] the instruction came from it came from
[1:44:00] Ezekiel and it came from Jeremiah you
[1:44:03] know in the story of Jeremiah there's a
[1:44:05] point in the in the word I know we're
[1:44:07] almost out of time here maybe I'll call
[1:44:09] the musicians because I feel like I'm
[1:44:10] just getting started now one of these
[1:44:12] days I'm going to preach Jeremiah but
[1:44:13] you know there was a time where the king
[1:44:15] said to Jeremiah yeah I don't understand
[1:44:17] it why I I actually I I pray and I cry
[1:44:22] out and I pray but I just don't hear
[1:44:24] anything from God and hear you this this
[1:44:27] Mongrel of a person who claims to be a
[1:44:30] prophet of God that nobody respects you
[1:44:32] come in here and you say that you have
[1:44:34] the word of the Lord why don't I hear
[1:44:37] the word of the Lord
[1:44:39] he's got the prophet right in front of
[1:44:41] him telling him declaring the word of
[1:44:43] the Lord saying to him thus saith the
[1:44:46] Lord
[1:44:47] but he doesn't have ears to hear it
[1:44:48] brothers and sisters or eyes to see it
[1:44:51] and what did he do he led the whole city
[1:44:53] the whole country into destruction
[1:44:55] my goodness but these three Hebrew kids
[1:44:58] they were able they were able they had
[1:45:00] the ability to hear the thus saith the
[1:45:03] Lord in those prophets the teachings
[1:45:05] that those prophets brought and you know
[1:45:07] what some of those prophets might not
[1:45:09] even have been in the land it might have
[1:45:11] just been a recorded tape of a prophet
[1:45:13] it might have just been a printed book
[1:45:15] from a prophet it could have been a
[1:45:17] scroll that was rolled up from a prophet
[1:45:19] the words that were written by a prophet
[1:45:22] and there was one Hallmark term in those
[1:45:25] Scrolls and that was thus saith the Lord
[1:45:28] that actually was able to capture the
[1:45:31] attention of those Hebrew children and
[1:45:33] it's no different for us today we serve
[1:45:35] the same God some people would say oh
[1:45:37] the apostolic days are over there's no
[1:45:39] more prophets in the land and there are
[1:45:41] no more Major Prophets in the land the
[1:45:43] next major prophet that's going to be in
[1:45:45] the land is going to be in the Far East
[1:45:47] that's where that prophet's going to be
[1:45:49] but right now today the prophet that was
[1:45:51] here in flesh he said there is a prophet
[1:45:53] in the land and that Prophet is the Holy
[1:45:54] Ghost brothers and sisters he's our
[1:45:56] fourth man in the fire he will lead us
[1:45:58] and guide us maybe stand with me tonight
[1:46:00] take courage brothers and sisters don't
[1:46:02] worry if you're in a fire just look
[1:46:04] around and know that you're alive still
[1:46:07] because of that Fourth Man in the fire
[1:46:09] with us let's just bow in prayer
