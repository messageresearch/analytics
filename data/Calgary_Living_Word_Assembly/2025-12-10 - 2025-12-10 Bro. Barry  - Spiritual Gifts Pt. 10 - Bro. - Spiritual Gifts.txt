[music] [music] Yeah. [singing] [singing] Heat. [music] [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [music] [music] [singing] Oh, what [music] a day. We're going to sing it again. Tell you those [music] little little dream testimony. It's many many years old, but this song reminded me of some of you know Kevin Hilderbrand. I haven't had more than probably three or four dreams in my life that were so real to me. This is one of them. We we made it past those past the gates. And brother Kevin and I were were jumping and running and screaming and and and [music] clapping our hands and praising the Lord. So we made it. We made it. We made it. We're running up the streets of Glory. &gt;&gt; It was so real to me. The other one was my grandfather and a brother that sadly he was he was kicked off a horse when he was when he was young and he was he was crippled. He was he was he was lame. His name was Cornelius. We called him really bad name. was crippled corny Freezen is what [singing and music] he was known by. But I saw both my grandfather and him young walking through the streets walking through through wheat sheets like walking through the fields when we fell. You remember the wheat fields and grandpa's grandpa's behind his yard. I saw rows of them. [music] Those are that was just so precious to me and just thought I'd share it with you. Here we are tonight. Soon he'll come in clouds with glory. We'll see all these things. We'll see him. We're going to see him before we go there. That's a beautiful thing. One morning, &gt;&gt; if you ever been, we don't know how that will happen, but I believe we'll just say, "Look at there, brother Candy. There's so and so." Welcome. We made it. If you seen that, you know you made it. &gt;&gt; What a promise. &gt;&gt; What a promise. Good to be a Christian tonight. &gt;&gt; Going to be called one of his own. Well, soon he'll come out of glory. [music and singing] Oh, saints of every [music] race. We shall be [music] [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Yeah. [singing] [music] Heat. [singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [singing] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; As [singing] I come into your presence, pass the gates of [music] grace, into [singing] your sanuary [music] till we're standing [singing] to faith. Think about that. [music] That's good time. I look upon your counties. I see [singing] the world [music] and I can only [singing] [music] [music] [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] Awesome. [music] Mighty God. Oh Lord, you [singing] are awesome. [music] [singing] [music] Yeah. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] You are lives we raise. You are [music and singing] awesome in this place. Mighty [music and singing] God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord that you are awesome in this place. Lord, &gt;&gt; we thank you Lord for this building. We thank you for this service tonight. But Lord, more than anything, we thank you for the revelation about who you are. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, not just about who you are, but [music] who you are in us. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, when we sing this song tonight, we sing it according [music] to that revelation. You are awesome in this place, Lord. The throne room of your uh oh father, the place that you have chosen in this age to dwell, &gt;&gt; the hearts of your children, Lord. Father, you truly are awesome. We can't even begin [music] to describe &gt;&gt; the measure of your grace to us in the age in which we live. Father, we thank you for all of the trials, Lord. We thank you for all of the tribulations, for all of the struggles, Lord Jesus, that you allow to [music] come by our way because we know that not one of them is by accident or coincidence. Every single [music] one is for us individually, Lord. So that you can see the character that you placed in us before the foundation of the world to come to the top, to come to the surface, Lord, [music] that we can recognize who we are, oh Father. And we know when that happens, that you will take us home. [music] And Father, one more time, we've gathered together in your name that we can prepare ourselves for that great hour. We know it's upon us, Lord. The handwriting is on the wall. The prophet has made the declaration. Judgment is at hand. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, we thank you for this evening, this service. Lord, thank you for each one who's come out tonight, Lord. Each life represented here in this building. Father, tonight we pray that we could lift our our requests unto you, Lord, as they are in the hearts of your children tonight, Father. Every one of us having needs, [music] Lord, we present them to you humbly tonight, Lord, trusting that you are more than able to help us with our needs. And father, we'll be careful to give you all the praise. Lord, we thank you for your presence tonight. [music] We pray that Lord, you would just continue ministering to us, Lord. That you just would receive all of the praise and the glory and the honor from this service tonight. Father, we love you and we thank you. We just ask all these things now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, musicians. Thank you everyone. It's certainly humbling to come out on a Wednesday evening and see the building full. My If you have your Bibles tonight, I would like to read from a few scriptures. I hope it's okay. I I feel like preaching. I thought, you know, what better thing could I do than to share with you what we had going on in Grand Prairie this weekend. So, we preached three services. I'm going to condense three services into an hour if it's possible even. We'll see. But uh in in the book of James, brother Brandham, he he talks about this and the heading in my Bible says faith and works. Brother Brandham in 1965 preaches a message, works is faith expressed. And the inspiration for all of this is from that message. And I'll get into it a little bit later, but uh you know in the book of James James, sorry it's not James chapter 3, it's James chapter 2 verse 21. James chapter 2 verse 21. Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seeest thou how faith wrought his works and by works was faith made perfect. &gt;&gt; And the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's turn back. In my Bible, it's two pages. Yours, it might be one or three to Hebrews chapter 13. Very familiar scripture, but I believe it bears uh reading Hebrews chapter 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. I bring you greetings from brother Darren and sister Dearis Ber and Grand Prairie. They said say a big hello to everyone here. Uh we had such a wonderful time over the weekend. I bring you greetings from the Lake. You know on Friday night I was sitting in the pastor's study. I just got settled there with brother Darren and uh just trying to find my place to find [snorts] get into the the routine of you know getting into the service you know and after traveling and and just got into the pastor's study talking with brother Darren and the song leader came in to pray and that song leader was brother David &gt;&gt; Lok and for those people who know brother David Lok he was here in Calgary for a while while brother Ken was here and uh he went through a real real valley. He went through a hard time in his life. So for me to see him walk in as the song leader, it was such an emotionally charged moment. I was so thankful. I just hugged his neck and praised the Lord for a minute. It was incredible to see him there. &gt;&gt; My So the Lake, they send their their greetings to the assembly here. the Meyers, Brother Steven and Sis, Sister Lillian Meyers from Hudson Hope. They send a big hello especially to Sister Shelly, the stewards, Brother John and and Sister Katrina Stewart. There's just so many gems up there in that little corner in the province. And uh everyone else in the assembly, we're just so thankful that we came and uh I think we'll do some more of it. And my desire, and I told brother Darren this, is to actually maybe help uh sponsor some ministry from our assembly because we're so blessed here to actually come and just bring some encouragement. And uh we'll see. I think they can really use the encouragement. If you wonder um my excitement about seeing so many people here on Sunday morning, I think we counted 20 people in the service and that was with visitors. That was including the visitors. So the assembly is pretty thin. It doesn't mean anything. Doesn't change the word of God. It doesn't mean that anything is wrong. But it certainly is encouraging to hear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I was thankful that we brought uh brother John Panicker and brother William Pavick. He brought brought us he drove. What a tremendous time it was just to go and fellowship around the things of the Lord and &gt;&gt; to hear. Amen. We uh just wanted to mention we've got the men's breakfast coming up this Saturday. We've got the youth service coming up on Friday. Um brother Toby, he's going to take the service on the 21st and uh he's going to give us a a little synopsis of what took place in Nigeria regarding the hostage situation. He was able to fellowship with the believers that were actually in it, I believe, uh from the assembly that they were actually from. So, uh, and then whatever the Lord has on his heart, I'm sure he's got a he's got a fork full of, uh, goodness for us. So, [snorts] we're excited about that service on the 21st, and then, uh, 24th we get to have a Christmas evening mass. Doesn't that sound fun? Every year I have people say to me, "Are you going to church Christmas Eve?" And I say, "No. Why would I do that?" We know it's a traditional thing in the world, but you know, this year it falls on a Wednesday evening. So, I mean, what else are we going to do? &gt;&gt; Sit at home and eat bon bonss. We can go to church. We can have church. We can worship the King of Kings and Lord of Lords in the day in [clears throat] which we live. It's a tremendous thing. So, we're not going to have mass. Don't worry. I just thought that would be fun to throw out there. Remember, we have a communion service the following Wednesday. That's the 31st. And uh we just trust the Lord will move one more time in our assembly as we have a communion footwashing and we have a testimony service and specials. I don't know if I really want to preach too much. I just want to get together and worship the Lord and just celebrate all the goodness in our lives. What he's done for us over the last year. Hasn't he been wonderful? &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful even tonight? Amen. [applause] Just wonderful. just absolutely wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wow. [applause] We thank you for your prayers. The Lord really moved in the services, I believe. And uh you know, if nobody else was blessed, I sure was. That's why I want to talk about it tonight. I thought it was just too good to just keep it to ourselves, so I had to bring a little bit tonight. But we got home at 1. I got home at 1:00 a.m. on Monday uh morning. And uh certainly thank brother William for his efforts in driving and just keeping us in a timely fashion. It was uh really really considerate. So thank you so much brother. And yeah [applause] and brother John he's a preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got inspired while we were driving there. That was really good. So, uh, anyways, you know, um, just getting into our service tonight, if it's okay, I just want to talk about what we talked about in in in Grand Prairie and Friday night, we we, you know, how do you find the mind of the Lord for three services? And I just had this this this leadership, this leading to go to works his faith. And I kept wondering, how can I start with that? Why is it that? And I just couldn't understand it. But I just kept feeding on it and kept listening to it and studying it. And you know, this was as the weeks came by and the days were drawing near, we were going and I just waited for the mind of the Lord. I'm not the kind that will really just, you know, prepare a volume of notes and have it with me to go just to be ready. I like to find the inspiration for the moment. And all of the inspiration came in Grand Prairie. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I was certainly thankful for that. So, Friday night, we got into talking about the secrets of the heart. And uh it's interesting because it's based out of 2 Kings chapter 6. If you want to turn over there quickly, 2 Kings chapter 6 talking about the secrets of the heart. And it's based on the story of the king of uh Syria and how he was he was wondering what was going on in his world. How who's the spy? There's someone in our midst that's actually helping out the the children of Israel. How could they possibly know what's going on? In verse 8, it says, "Then the king of Syria wared against Israel." This is chapter 6 of 2 Kings verse 8. Then the king of Syria wared against Israel and took counsel with his servants, saying, "In such and such a place shall be my camp." And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place, for titter the Syrians are come down. And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice. &gt;&gt; So multiple times. This is not an accident or a coincidence. Verse 11. Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing. You can imagine he would be really upset. Who is telling our secrets? And he called his servants, and he said unto them, "Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?" And one of his servants said, "None, my lord, O king?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But Elisha the prophet that is in Israel, tellth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember Hebrews 13. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; The secrets of the heart. And you know, I I actually took it a little bit further and I started to talk about how how we have vision. We we do have vision. And you know, when you carry on in this story here, how maybe we could just jump down to verse 15. And when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and servant said unto him, "Alas, my master, how shall we do?" But you know, this is what the master said. This is what the seasoned believer said. &gt;&gt; Right? Now, some would say the prophet, and he was a prophet indeed, but I believe this is the testimony of a seasoned believer, someone who is perfect, not in the fleshly sense, &gt;&gt; not necessarily in all of the works sense, but in the faith sense. And we're going to get into that tonight, in the faith sense, because that's where it's at. It's truly in our faith. That perfection is in our faith. It has to be. But this is the testimony of a believer. He answered, "Fear not, &gt;&gt; for they that be with us are more than they that be with them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful because Elisha prayed and he didn't pray, "Oh, smite the enemy. Oh, deal with them." What did he do? He said, "Change our perspective. &gt;&gt; Take this boy's eyes and open them to the things of God. open them to the word for his day. So he doesn't have to be afraid. He doesn't have to live under the spirit of fear &gt;&gt; because he hasn't given us a spirit of fear, has he? He's given us a spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind. We don't have to be afraid. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Elisha prayed and said, "Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see." &gt;&gt; I thought he was seeing. &gt;&gt; Weren't his eyes open? Couldn't he see the enemy all around? But I took this story and and brought it in in such a way that we talk about our vision isn't necessarily what's going on. What we look at on the surface in our flesh in the world that we perceive isn't necessarily what's actually taking place even though it is. But we need to be very careful to recognize that it can be a trap. It can be the devil trying to get us to fear, trying to get us afraid, trying to accept that spirit of fear and say, "No, it's greater than those that are around us." &gt;&gt; And I mean, if we've got the open book, if we've got what what do we really have to fear? &gt;&gt; If Revelations 10:7 has actually taken place, &gt;&gt; how many here would believe that it hasn't taken place? Don't show me your hands. But if we really truly have been given an open book, what John the Baptist or not John the Baptist, John the Revelator really desired to look upon and he was told to take that book and eat it up. &gt;&gt; If we've been given that book, what do we have to fear? I know we deal with things naturally in our lives, in our bodies, in our minds, &gt;&gt; but greater is he that is in me &gt;&gt; than he that is in this world. &gt;&gt; So, we went on to talk about this story and how our perception of the situation isn't necessarily what God is seeing. It's not necessarily what's really taking place around us, even though we can see it from a limited perspective. And you know, I I remember brother Wayne Lawson, I think it was, was talking about it. You know, when you fly in an airplane and you look out and you see the world from 40,000 feet in the air, it has a a a perspective. Brother Sam probably knows all about this. But then when you start to come in for a landing and you get closer down, you can see more. And the closer down you get, the more you see. And when you get on the ground, you have a totally different perspective as you begin to look up and around. And that's kind of what I wanted to get at with this this story here is that, you know, we have a perspective ourselves. But let's not get caught up in what we see because it's not necessarily what God sees. &gt;&gt; Most times, in fact, it's not. &gt;&gt; Especially when it comes to looking in the mirror and seeing ourselves, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Many times we look at ourselves and think, my look at this, look at that, look at the other thing. But that's not how God sees us. Here I go jumping to the the punchline of the service. We're going to get into that. And you know, it's anointed of the Lord because I saw probably five markers in the song service and things that were said and the prayer that went forward that were actually already in the notes for tonight. So, I just love it when the Lord does that. &gt;&gt; But, you know, it came to pass verse 20 when they were come into Samaria and Elisha said, "Lord, open the first he said, close their eyes. Follow me. Let them let them. The man that they were chasing went out and said to them, "I know who you're looking for, but he's not here." The guy they were looking for, "But follow me and I'll take you to him." And what did he do? He took him into a trap. These were guys that were seasoned warriors, soldiers, generals. They knew how to triangulate. They knew they were warriors. &gt;&gt; But yet, he was able to take them and lead them. &gt;&gt; Now, were they blind? Was his servant blind? Did his servant not see? And then he could see he was able to have they were all able to have a different perspective. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; It's pretty interesting to see it. But he brought them here in verse 20 says, "And it came to pass when they were come into Samaria that Elisha said, Lord, open the eyes of these men that they may see." And the Lord opened their eyes and they saw. And behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. And now they realized, "Uh-oh, we've got a big problem now. Now we're in a trap. Somehow we found ourselves right in the midst of our enemy. &gt;&gt; But you know what did the spirit of God do? Immediately the king came out and said to them, "Master, shall I slay them? Shall I slay them? What shall I do?" Oh my. Shall I smite them? And what did the prophet of God say? I would say the spirit of God said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The psalm says, "Thou preparest a table &gt;&gt; before my enemies." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We're going to actually feed them food. give them food and water. We're going to accommodate them. We're going to show them kindness. And then guess what's going to happen? They're going to go their way and they're not going to bug us anymore. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it what happened there. &gt;&gt; In the end of verse 23, so the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. &gt;&gt; Just treat them nicely. Hey, sometimes our perception is so different than what's actually taking place. And and I think maybe sometimes I know myself by experience, brothers and sisters, sometimes we just need to pray, Lord, change my perspective. &gt;&gt; Give me a different fresh view of the situation. It can go so far for where we're at in our lives. &gt;&gt; We can go to sleep thinking the whole world is closing in around us, &gt;&gt; but then wake up in the morning and feel like, "Wow, &gt;&gt; I've got a brand new life to live. &gt;&gt; Look at all the things around me. Everything is so good. My My family is good and my I got a job. It's not the greatest. I don't like my job that much, but you know, I've got it and it pays the bills. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have reason to rejoice. Sometimes it's just our perspective in the situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was Friday night. &gt;&gt; That was Friday night. Saturday night, we actually got into it a little further. And uh Saturday night was more the secrets of the heart and and and and vision, being able to see. And Saturday night, we got on to perspective, how we actually see things. And you know, I took that from Second Kings. I couldn't get out of Kings and the story of Elisha. 2 Kings chapter 2. If you want to turn over there, 2 Kings, chapter 2, very familiar scriptures. Thank you, brother Dawn, for taking the service on Sunday. It was powerful, tremendous service. Thank you, brother, for yielding. certainly enjoy hearing the ministry give to us what the Lord has put on their heart. &gt;&gt; Need them all. &gt;&gt; Second Kings, did I say? Yeah. Two. Sorry, I was looking at it wrong. Second Kings chapter 2 verse one. And it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went to with Elisha from Gilgal. Now, we know that Elijah had already called Elisha and Elisha already fixed up all of his life, got rid of the oxen, changed his his complete focus on life and started following the word for his day. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. He stopped all of his family traditions. He gave everything up and started following the word for his day. &gt;&gt; And and they knew that there was coming a time that he was going to go up by a whirlwind. And Elijah, verse two, said unto Elisha, Terry here I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to Bethl. And Elisha said unto him, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethl. And and interestingly, the sons of the prophets that were at Bethl, they knew the prophecy, didn't they? They came forth to Elisha and said unto him, "Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today?" And he said, "Yay, I know it. Hold ye your peace." &gt;&gt; These were the ones that weren't completely sold out. &gt;&gt; They were pretty sold out. They're pretty good believers, most way believers, but not all the way believers because if they were, they would have been following just like Elisha. But it's interesting how they knew the prophecy too. Verse four. And Elisha, Elijah said unto him, Elisha, Terry, here I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho. And guess what? [clears throat] Sons of the prophets were there. The sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him, "Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today?" And he answered, "Yay, I know it. Hold ye your peace." &gt;&gt; And Elijah said unto him, Terry, I pray thee here, for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee." And they too went on. And 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view a far off. Now, there's a reason for that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you flip back and you read the previous story, the 50 men and this prophet was bad news. You didn't take 50 men to follow this prophet and challenge him. &gt;&gt; So they knew full well they better stand far off. &gt;&gt; 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view a far off. And they too stood by Jordan. And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters. And they divided hither and tither so that they too went over on dry ground. I just think it's so beautiful. He shows him exactly how to handle the word, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee." And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. &gt;&gt; And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, &gt;&gt; if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee. &gt;&gt; But if not, it shall not be so. &gt;&gt; And we know the next verse. And it came to pass, they still went on and talked that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and parted them both aunderder. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I was preaching this in Grand Prairie, it just occurred to me these were the exact same horses that we just already read about &gt;&gt; that the servant of Elisha actually saw &gt;&gt; standing round about saying there's way more for us than there is against us. &gt;&gt; But you know in this scripture here verse 12 we'll read this. And Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces. He didn't need them anymore, did he? &gt;&gt; He had a brand new position that he was moving into. &gt;&gt; And he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. And just the most notable words ever. And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smokeote the waters and said, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and tither. and Elisha went over. &gt;&gt; And we know, we know those ones that would stand a far off, they were just too afraid to get close. They just didn't see things the same way. &gt;&gt; They just were afraid to get in and get too close. They had their own version of the message for their day. So, they just stood a far off. Those ones were right there. And what did they do? They bugged the prophet until he was actually ashamed is what the word says. &gt;&gt; Oh, we should go and look for him. But they knew the prophecy, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; All of the believers believers everywhere they went to said, "Don't you know your master's going up?" &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But yet after he did go up, then they said, "Oh, we just can't really believe it that way. We got to actually put a spin on. Maybe we should send out some bands of men to go and find them." Right? Because he must be up on a mountain somewhere because that was one of the places he liked to go. It's interesting to look at this story. What I really got into was the fact that there was three times that Elijah said to Elisha, "Just tarry ye here &gt;&gt; because I got business to do. The Lord's called me. Just terry here and wait and and then we can carry on our way." And you know, three times it was typed, Brother Darren brought it out really good as a summary. You know, the first one was justification, Bethl, right? &gt;&gt; The second one was was sanctification. sanctification. The third one was the River Jordan, right? &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost, crossing over, dying out to yourself, the truth of the word. But, you know, I guess it just became so real to me in in this in this weekend how it wasn't after the promise was given. You know, what do you want, Elisha, for following me? Like, what do you want? What can I do for you? Because you've been such a strong supporter of me and everything that I've done. What can I do to help you? Well, I want a double portion of what you got. That wasn't the arrangement when he actually brought him and attracted him from doing his worldly deeds. What attracted him was the word for his day. And you know, he was at the place, I just think it's so beautiful where I believe it with all my heart that somewhere along the way, he read the church age book that said, "Never let anyone or anything get between you and this word." So even when the prophet said to him, "I got business to do. &gt;&gt; The Lord's called me over here. I think it would be good if you just wait here." &gt;&gt; He said, "No way. Ain't going to happen. &gt;&gt; Cuz I believe what the church age book said. Ain't nothing getting between me and that word. &gt;&gt; Everywhere you go, I go. &gt;&gt; Everything you do, I do. &gt;&gt; I am going to take that word all of the way." Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of that, &gt;&gt; it entitled him to the token, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Full complete obedience to the entire word of God entitles YOU TO THE TOKEN. AND DON'T THINK IT'S JUST READING THE word of God and saying, "Well, I believe in Jesus Christ. He died for my sins, and I'm just going to bypass the prophet with a real good wide sweep and come in at Jesus Christ at the end." If you negate the message of the hour for your day, &gt;&gt; Yes. then you're not entitling yourself to the token. &gt;&gt; In the days of the children of Israel in Gan, if they would have said, "I'm just going to bypass that token." Remember, we've talked about it. Oh man, you're going to make more flies come around. Haven't we had enough plagues of flies? I'm just going to take that blood and put it in a little vial and I'll just set it on the ground by the door so the flies can't get at it and we won't attract. But I'll have the blood. The blood's there, right? Maybe I'll set one up on the lentil. It'll be right up there and there'll be two on the doorpost down here. I've done it my way. It'll work. It's the blood, right? No, you got to do it the way the prophet said. And if you want to do it any other way, it means death. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; But in this in this message here, I just thought it was so good. You know, it was after he was already sold out on the word, after he was already a follower of the word. It didn't take something fantastic for him to commit his life to the word. And you know, going back full circle now, this is where it gets kind of full circle. I'm just going to start blending it together as we go. You know, works is faith what? &gt;&gt; Expressed. Yeah. When we've got great faith, our works demonstrate it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Brandom says it. I've got the quote. I'm going to read it. But you know what? If we're afraid to act on our faith, &gt;&gt; then we don't even have it. &gt;&gt; Because why would we be afraid if we really truly have faith? Why would we be afraid to act on it? We shouldn't fear. There should be no fear about acting on the faith that we've got. If the Lord gives us a revelation and we say, "That's for me. I claim that with all of my heart." Even brother Bradom says that if you do that, nothing's going to stop you. Nothing will stop that promise from coming to pass in your life. Even though you don't see it today, you might not see it today. You'll just know it's closer tomorrow. If you don't see it tomorrow, you'll know it'll be even closer the next day. It's the same faith that it takes for us to see a body change to see the promises come to pass according to the word for our day. It's not different faith. And brother Bradam even says it talking about goan and applying the blood. It's applied with simple weeds, simple thistle, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes simple faith, not complicated faith, NOT COMPLICATED SCHOLARLY FAITH WHERE WE'RE TALKING ALL ABOUT DEEP, DARK MYSTERIES. &gt;&gt; The mysteries are history. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We got an open book. &gt;&gt; And it entitles us to the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it gives us the ability to recognize who we are &gt;&gt; and what we're raised up for. &gt;&gt; My I think it's just so beautiful. So that was Saturday night, Sunday. Sunday service, you know, we talked about sort of um Friday night, you know, how we see as humans, we see and we don't see. We talked about Saturday, how, you know, other people actually perceive maybe perception, our perception of things makes all the difference. And and how we really perceive things because sometimes we perceive things with our eyes and sometimes we perceive things with our heart. And you know, we we're supposed to discern the spirits. That's the word of God. First John says that to to discern the spirits and and that only comes by the Holy Spirit. But I took it on Sunday. I thought, you know, I can see how the Lord was leading this now because now works is faith expressed comes into view. And you know what it comes down to, brothers and sisters, is how does God see us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how I brought Sunday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's God's perception? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we can look at ourselves all day long and say, "Well, I feel like this and I I remember that and and I I I I I Who cares about us?" &gt;&gt; What does he see when he looks our way? &gt;&gt; We know we sing that song. He no longer sees a sinner, &gt;&gt; but a saint &gt;&gt; who's been washed white as snow. Oh my. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I feel like I could sing that song, but I'm not going to right now. I'll spare you. But you know on Sunday I just got into God's perspective and how he sees us and perspective is everything &gt;&gt; and and I started the the the service with the scripture over in James James chapter 2 verse 21. Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seeest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect. And remember that word perfect means complete or mature. How works made how works was faith made perfect. And 23 says the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God. Now I I don't know if I'd even be able to get into it but I I just want to say this. You know, we have been called in this generation to a greater calling than just a friend of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember the disciples, they were actually the disciples, they were servants. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Originally, they were servants. He called them all by name, but they were servants. And there came a time where he said, "I no longer call you servant, but I call you friend." &gt;&gt; Amen. But then through the process of time, through all the ages, after Christ came and and paid our redemption and set all of humanity free, thousands of years later, he sends a prophet. And that prophet says something so significant. I've said it in the past, but I have to say it again. He said, "You know what? I no longer call you church, &gt;&gt; but I call you bride." And you know, before there's a wedding, you have a bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before there's a wedding, there's a bride. And you know, brothers and sisters, I've talked about it in the past. I'll say it again tonight, too. There is another move. &gt;&gt; It's not staying as bride. We don't keep our wives as brides. We consummate the marriage. And they move from being bride to being wife. &gt;&gt; And once they're wife, then they're one. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know the scripture says that let us rejoice and be exceeding glad. Let's be very, very glad. Why? Because the marriage of the lamb has come. Don't put it off to Revelation 19 when she's coming back with the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; The marriage is now. Brother Bradom said, "Right now is the marriage. We go to the wedding supper in the sky. His wife &gt;&gt; hath made herself &gt;&gt; ready. &gt;&gt; And you know, brothers and sisters, this is exactly how we do it. Through the five-fold ministry, gathering together in the name of the Lord Jesus under the banner of his love, this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; That's how she makes herself ready. &gt;&gt; My so what God sees, you know, talking about perspective, what's his perspective? It's I said it on on Sunday. It's nearly impossible for us to explain in one service what his perspective is. &gt;&gt; But I I went through those two quickly. Now I'm going to kind of dwell on this one. I'm going to take a little bit of time here because I can see we've got perfectly a half an hour. And I know what's going to happen. It's going to go like that. But you know, it's nearly impossible to try and explain in one service how God sees us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm just going to try my best just to try and bring us some encouragement about how he sees us. And and you know, that's why we fellowship because we crave more, isn't it? Don't we crave more every time? It's like when we're a kid and and we have a story being told to us and you know, we got to go to bed and I can't even remember this far back, but I have kids so I know how it goes. But you know how the children they get a story at night and they're going to bed and you know, a is that it? Yeah. You got to go to sleep now. You got to turn off the light and go to sleep. A just one more. Isn't that what we do when we gather together as children of the king? Just tell me one more time about who I am. I just want to hear it one more time, daddy. Give me more. And you know, the more we do that, the more we get the spirit that cries out, Abba, father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Abba, father, tell me more about who I am. &gt;&gt; My out of 1965 works as faith. Brother Brandom says, "Now we find here that James is justifying Abraham by his works." James is justifying Abraham by his works. But now in Paul, in Romans, we didn't read this tonight, by the way. I know you know that in Romans, the book of Romans the 8th, the 4th chapter 4 1-8. I won't read it all, but just read a part of it. And what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh has found? &gt;&gt; For if Abraham was justified, you remember we took the word last night which was the invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ. By the way, &gt;&gt; if you want to hear what he's talking about last night, the invisible union of the bride, the word justified by works he has whereof to glory, but not before God. For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness sake. And I think that's the critical factor there, brothers and sisters. Tonight, I'm going to dwell on that just for a second. Abraham believed God. &gt;&gt; That's what it took. &gt;&gt; It didn't take anything else. &gt;&gt; Even though his works expressed that he fully believed what God told him. &gt;&gt; And to him that workketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now what Paul is referring to here is what God seen in Abraham. &gt;&gt; Now now let's if you we was not turning too much we'd go back again to Genesis the 15th chapter and the sixth verse 156 I believe is right. We'll begin at the 5th. And he brought him forth abroad and said, "Look now towards the heavens and tell the stars, if thou are able to number them." And he said unto him, "So shall thy seed be." &gt;&gt; Abraham believed those words. &gt;&gt; And because of that, he knew that God had to provide a sacrifice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't actually a question in his mind or in his heart. Maybe turn over. Let's turn over to Genesis chapter 22. Before we read it, I'm just going to read this quote. Is works is faith expressed. Another one here. He says, "Now the two men that were t talking on faith, Paul justified Abraham by what God saw in Abraham. But James justified Abraham by what man saw in Abraham." See, now James said he's justified by his works. Paul said he's justified by faith. Now we have a prophet in this age, this dispensation, preaching a service called works is faith expressed. &gt;&gt; The lives that we live expresses the faith that we have. &gt;&gt; We can talk about all the faith that we've got, but our lives demonstrate that faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, but see, Abraham believed God. That's what God saw in him. He believed it. But then when he went to acting as though it was already done, &gt;&gt; that's what man saw in him. &gt;&gt; The works were not. Oh, I don't know. I still feel sick. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know. I can't seem to find a job. There's nothing. Oh, no. I don't know. The song leader, the pastor, the deacon. Ah, you know our speech betrays us when we say that we believe but yet we start doing all those things. Do we really believe? &gt;&gt; But then when he went acting as though it was already done, that's what man saw in him. &gt;&gt; And don't think for a second that God never saw it either. &gt;&gt; God saw very clearly that he was acting on what he believed. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was speaking on what he believed. Remember that he over the course of the years he had servants come against him and mock him. Brother Brandham said, "Oh yeah, you got the baby yet?" &gt;&gt; We know that even brother Brandham, he was mocked, wasn't he &gt;&gt; about Joseph? He was told he was going to have Joseph. &gt;&gt; And people called him and said, "Oh yeah, you had another boy or a girl, right? You had a girl baby. Huh? I guess you were wrong." And he said, "It doesn't matter what anybody says." Amen. &gt;&gt; God told me, "I'm going to have Joseph. I'm going to have a boy and his name is going to be Joseph." And we know that there's Joseph. &gt;&gt; He's even here. &gt;&gt; But Abraham had to go through all of that, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Even to the point where the closest confidant in his life, his wife, said to him, "Honey, maybe it's just not going to work the way you think. &gt;&gt; Maybe God's just not going to do it the way that you believe, the way that you understand. Maybe you just misunderstand him. Maybe we need to go acting because works is faith expressed. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Maybe we need to do something. We need to make it happen. &gt;&gt; And we know that God said, "Okay, go ahead. &gt;&gt; But it's not going to turn out right." &gt;&gt; And we know that's the example, the perfect example of perfect will versus permissive will. Perfect will is simply believing God and then acting like he is doing it all. &gt;&gt; Not just waiting for him to do it all. Remember I said acting like he will do it all. &gt;&gt; Moving forward trusting that he is in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the permissive will is saying, "No way. No, it's taking too long. &gt;&gt; You haven't responded to my text in time. &gt;&gt; You haven't answered my email yet." &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; I'll say it this way, too. You haven't let me preach, so it mustn't be right. So, I need to take matters into my own hands. I need to deal with this my own way. Well, go ahead. They that wait upon the Lord &gt;&gt; shall renew their strength. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You don't want to get ahead of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But here we have Abraham in this situation now. He's gone through all of that, all of the drama, all of the people trying to usurp their traditions and their ideas and their ways, even to his wife, &gt;&gt; saying we should just do it our way. And and we know it turned out that way. But finally, that promise that he trusted in 25 years later, they had a body change &gt;&gt; and she even laughed up her sleeve &gt;&gt; in front of Elohim. And &gt;&gt; we know the prophet said if it wasn't because she was a part of Abraham, &gt;&gt; she would have been destroyed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But because it would have hurt him, &gt;&gt; he didn't hurt her. &gt;&gt; What a what a loving father. &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thing that is. &gt;&gt; Don't ever think for a second that we don't look out for one another, &gt;&gt; that God doesn't consider us in our lives. My goodness. &gt;&gt; But here we are with Abraham. And I'll just read this last paragraph 90. And that's the same as it is to us because our works express what faith we have. But if we're afraid to act on what we believe, then we do not believe it. &gt;&gt; If we're afraid to act on what we believe, then we do not believe it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, you've got to believe it. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. It's magnificent when you look at this. It's like the key to unlock the door to every single blessing in the Bible. &gt;&gt; What's the key? Only believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when we believe, then we're going to follow the word. When we follow the word, we're going to see the apostolic blessing in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not just going to go and make the apostolic blessing so that we can say, "Wow, I've got the apostolic blessing. Now I believe. Look it. You saw this. You saw that. I was able to wave my magic wand and get God to move." That's not the way it works. But sometimes I believe even in the message it can appear that way. If we don't actually see the great mighty move of God by our our our our our efforts then something is wrong. And maybe sometimes it is. But we don't put works ahead of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word goes first &gt;&gt; every single time. You know in this message, Brother Brandham says one of the great mistakes that people make is they get hung up on emotion and they mix up emotion for faith. Faith has nothing to do with emotion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Faith is the sixth sense. It's not part of these earthly senses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we get these earthly senses involved, then we're actually not participating in true sixth sense faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's just brother Barry. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; You know, in Genesis chapter 22, let's read from verse 6. Genesis 22:6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and a knife. And they went both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, "My father." He said, "Here am I, my son." He said, "Behold the fire and the wood, &gt;&gt; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" You can imagine this conversation. &gt;&gt; Isaac was pretty smart. He was starting to dial in. &gt;&gt; He was starting to see what was going on here. Wait a second, Daddy. I know that you can be a little bit fanatical when you start talking about that God of yours. [laughter] And by the way, did you tell mama that we're coming here? &gt;&gt; Right? Can you imagine the conversation? &gt;&gt; The Bible mentions that Isaac spake unto his dad, saying, "Identify the wood. I identify the knife, but where's the lamb?" &gt;&gt; Oh my. And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering." Amen. &gt;&gt; So they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son. I can't imagine having that conversation. Just trust me, son. Let me bind your hands. Trust me, son. Let me bind your feet. I'm just going to set you on top of this altar and I'm going to light the fire after I cut your throat. Don't worry. GOD'S GOING TO PROVIDE A SACRIFICE. Naturally speaking, he'd be saying, "Daddy, you're crazy." &gt;&gt; If he's going to provide a sacrifice, is he going to make me go through all of that? &gt;&gt; Think about the emotional trauma. &gt;&gt; How many of us would do that with our children? &gt;&gt; And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Here am I." And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You could imagine that he probably just had a jubilee. Isaac was with a gag maybe in his mouth going, [crying] [laughter] "For now I know that thou fearthst God, seeing that thou hast with not has not withheld thy son, thine only son from me." &gt;&gt; We know that Abraham, he worshiped there. It was right after that he looked around and he found the ram. It had to be a ram, not a lamb, caught in the thicket. and he took that and he sacrificed it as a type of Christ as the sacrifice for all of mankind. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful because if we look at this quote that we just read and it's the same as it is to us because our works express what faith we have. Abraham was willing to go all of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Trusting that if he did kill his son, that promise that he said, "Take a look up and see those stars. your seed is going to be just like those stars. And knowing that God gave him Isaac, Isaac came from their union together through the body change. &gt;&gt; It wasn't some other manipulation of the promise. It was exactly the way God said it. And you know, when we have a promise from God, brothers and sisters, it's not going to be a nebulous manipulation of the word for our day. It's going to be exactly the way that God said that it would be. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's where he knew I can act. I know that I can march forward with the revelation that God has given me because he will be obligated to raise him up again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How it would happen, what it would look like, who knows? But talk about faith. Talk about really true, genuine faith. to be able to pull the knife back after binding your son, trusting that if you chop his neck, it's going to turn out right. Wow. But, you know, looking at this this thing here, I I just believe it's 100% fresh tonight. I just can't imagine what kind of faith this stirred up in Isaac. &gt;&gt; For him to witness his dad following the Lord, &gt;&gt; holy, &gt;&gt; pushing mama aside and saying, "Yeah, I love you, honey. You're wonderful. You're my help. You're You're my wife. I love you. But this is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I follow him. &gt;&gt; And as you follow me, you follow him. &gt;&gt; God wasn't calling Sarah. He was calling Abraham. &gt;&gt; And that must have been a very difficult situation. &gt;&gt; Very difficult. If anybody has ever seen the Bible in uh it's it's portrayed actually in I can't remember where it's at. There's a whole series called the Bible and it's really quite riveting but they portray this story and at the end of it Abraham and Isaac come down the mountain and Sarah is running up the mountain screaming frantically looking for Isaac and grabbing him and looking at her lunatic worshiping husband. It's portrayed in such a way. It's just it's just amazing to think about and and you know I I don't say that she was sacriiggious in that way that she didn't believe God herself. Don't get me wrong, but I think it's it's wonderful to look at it maybe from a human perspective because we live in a real world and and we deal with humanity. Every single one of us. We all have emotions. &gt;&gt; It's amazing to think about, but there's none of Sarah in that part of the story, is there? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; None of her. &gt;&gt; But you know, I just think it's so good. I'm going to read this quote and then we'll continue continue on here with the last few minutes we have. And that's the same as it is to us because our works express what faith we have. But if we're afraid to act on what we believe, then we do not believe it. See, you've got to believe it. And you know in this scripture here verse 12 we heard the angel of the Lord come to him out of heaven and say Abraham Abraham he said not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearthst God. Did God just learn this? &gt;&gt; It's not something he just learned, is it? &gt;&gt; If he did, he's not God. He wasn't God if he just learned that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This wasn't for God, was it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was exactly for Abraham. And I think it was exactly for Isaac because we know the promise came through Isaac. &gt;&gt; And there's so much to read and talk about with Isaac, but we're not even going there tonight. But to think about it, how this must have instilled such a great faith in both of those men. Yes, &gt;&gt; God wasn't learning this even though he said, "Now I know." &gt;&gt; Abraham was learning this. &gt;&gt; Isaac was learning this. Now you know. And you know, brothers and sisters, when we go through these trials in our lives, when our works express the faith that we believe in God and his leadership in our lives, I think about all the brothers and sisters that immigrate maybe here to Canada, to Calgary, how you must follow the the Lord, the leadership of the Lord to say, I want you to pick up everything and move to a brand new country and pick up a brand new culture and go and find a job and somehow someway it's all going to work out for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. works is faith expressed. &gt;&gt; But you know, one of the things that I think is hallmark and I remember brother Ken preaching this real serious and real straight that you know when we're going to do that, there has to be a fellowship. There has to be a church. We've got to fellowship with believers. &gt;&gt; And if we're going to go somewhere just because of a job and say, "Well, you know, I I'll just figure out church later." It's not going to turn out right. &gt;&gt; That's right. when we just leave our family at home and say it's not it doesn't matter if you go to church on Wednesday night. Just raise your kids like that and see what happens. &gt;&gt; Let them know that it's not important to go to church. It doesn't really matter. You could, you know, maybe just press play. Watch what happens. Doesn't turn out right all the time. Sometimes it does, but most times I don't know, man. &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't do it. But we need to make sure that we've got fellowship. And you know, that's part of it. making sure that I can bring my family to the house of the Lord to be a part of a body &gt;&gt; have brothers and sisters of like precious faith &gt;&gt; that I can fellowship with that I can pray for that can pray for me that's why we have a body &gt;&gt; you know this this whole story here it wasn't for God to know it was all about Abraham and his own revelation for him to realize that I actually followed God holy &gt;&gt; and we know that's exactly what Caleb said. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I followed God holy. I followed Jehovah holy. I followed him all the days of my life holy. And how did he do it? He followed him through the prophet. &gt;&gt; He followed him through the prophets. And because of that, &gt;&gt; he was able to have the faith enough to say, you know what? Now it's my time. &gt;&gt; This is my day. I want my inheritance. So give me my mountain. &gt;&gt; We know that he was able to say that. Why was he able to do that? because he was of another spirit. &gt;&gt; But he believed, he had faith to act on the word in his life. I just think it's so beautiful. You know, Abraham, he had that revelation. Ain't nothing going to get between me and that word. &gt;&gt; No person, no situation, nothing's going to get between me and that word. If there's a problem or a situation, God's going to deal with it for me because nothing's going to get between me and that word. It's got to be that powerful in our lives. Abraham needed to know this and so did Isaac and I can't help but think even Sarah. Everyone around them needed to know and you know the whole world needed to know because that's why it's written in this book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Imagine if Abraham was afraid to act on it. It wouldn't even be in here, would it? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But sometimes, brothers and sisters, God will ask the hard things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I don't discount that for a second because some of the hard things are really hard. And nobody can actually relate to how hard they really are in our lives. But God knows. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't give them to punish us. &gt;&gt; Why does he give them to us? It's to show us how much we really believe. &gt;&gt; Because our works express the faith that he has given us. &gt;&gt; So if a real hard trial comes our way, do we just quit? Do we just say there's nothing to it and go home? or do we push harder? Do we do we get up and and go further? Do we keep pressing on like brother Brandham heard? You know, our perspective, brothers and sisters, many times we see ourselves in Romans chapter 7. I'm not going to read the scripture tonight. I'm just going to paraphrase it. Paul looking at his body says, "Oh, who can deliver me this vile body that I'm stuck in? Who can deliver me from this flesh that I'm in?" And you know, we just need to turn the page, don't we? Because the turning the page goes to Romans chapter 8 verse1 says there is therefore now right now &gt;&gt; present tense now no condemnation to those who are in Christ &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh but actually believe and are willing to express their faith through their works because they don't walk after the flesh. But guess what? If we walk after the flesh, we're actually using our eyes. We're stumbling at the veil. We're looking at all of the natural circumstances and we're forgetting that there's way more for us than there are against us. &gt;&gt; Such a beautiful thing. 1955, the waters of separation. Brother Brandham, he says how God sees us. God looking through the blood. &gt;&gt; He doesn't see you no more as a sinner. &gt;&gt; He sees you redeemed. &gt;&gt; He says that. Amen. You're redeemed because he always sees you through Christ. And remember, he says it somewhere in the message. I don't have it. I didn't have it up there either, but he says it somewhere in the message that he doesn't even see you. &gt;&gt; He only hears your voice. &gt;&gt; He only hears your voice. &gt;&gt; So when you come to church, what what's your voice? &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say. Is it like that or are you really I am so glad I can recognize that my soul was hanging over hell by one link, one broken link of a chain and he redeemed me. He's the one that redeemed me. He gave me the the the the ticket to eternal life. He did it for me. Are we on fire for the Lord? &gt;&gt; If he only hears our voice, then what do we express to him? What's our works? &gt;&gt; Some people will say, "Well, you can't sing. You don't have a voice." The word says, "Make a joyful noise." Amen. &gt;&gt; How God sees us. God looking through the blood. He doesn't see you no more as a sinner. He sees you redeemed. &gt;&gt; You're redeemed because he always sees you through Christ. That's the reason we can be perfect. Not perfect in the sense of sinless. I love how he says this here. Not perfect in the sense of sinless. We're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ. And what does that mean? It means that we're mature sons and daughters of God &gt;&gt; because he sees us through the blood of Christ, &gt;&gt; our theophanes. He sees us the way he made us, &gt;&gt; not stuck in this body here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason he said, "Be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect." We're already seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Paul in the 10th chapter of Hebrews trying to explain the law having a shadow of good things to come, not the very image of the things could never make the comer unto perfect because God was looking through animal blood. But now he looks through the blood of his son. Perfection come by Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now I'm not perfect in your sight. You may not be perfect in my sight. But what about in God's sight? &gt;&gt; There's where it lays. And if you're born again into the body of Christ, &gt;&gt; then God looks upon you as perfect as Christ was himself. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As perfect as Christ was, that's how he sees the believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. &gt;&gt; It's not done by works. Wait, I thought you said it was. &gt;&gt; No, it's not. It's not done by works. The works follow &gt;&gt; and that's works is faith expressed in a nutshell. The works follow our belief. &gt;&gt; If we believe, our lives demonstrate we believe. &gt;&gt; And then sometimes we have to preach. Sometimes we'll say a word, but our lives speak volumes before people. &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. It's not by works you can do at all. It's by grace. &gt;&gt; God has given you this offer. And if you've accepted it in the sight of God, you are perfect, redeemed, washed in the blood of the lamb without fault, without blemish, without spot. Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; Now, brothers and sisters, this is 1955. &gt;&gt; The waters of separation. &gt;&gt; I'll call the musicians as we wrap up here, but you know, to think about this, that's how he sees us. You know how brother Brandham was one time in that diner? &gt;&gt; I think it was a Sunday. &gt;&gt; He was traveling. They stopped in for some food. And while he was there, he was using his natural sight, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; His perception was just a little bit off. And you know, I left out a whole bunch. There's so much in here. Maybe I'll get into it on Sunday. Perception is everything. I will. I'll save it for Sunday. You know, brother Brandham, in this diner, he's looking around and he's seeing the law men back in the 60s. It meant something. &gt;&gt; It still does today, but society has undermined it in such a terrible way. It's awful. It's just a a deliberate rebellious spirit. That's all &gt;&gt; to to to rebel against authority to say that my opinion matters. Well, it doesn't matter when in the eyes of the law, but to some people, I guess it does. But to think about it, back in that day, there was the policeman and what was he doing? He was sitting there with a woman of ill fame. And what were they doing? They were playing a slot machine or something on a Sunday. They they were playing the the whatever they were doing. They had the music going. And brother Bradomy got so so upset in the moment, judging these people, thinking they should be protecting, you know, the law-abiding citizens. And on a Sunday in here, instead of being in church somewhere, they're in here listening to rock and roll and and and falling over each other and she was dressed immorally and the situation was terrible in the eyes of the prophet. And what did he do? He got up and went to the washroom and and God spoke to him in that moment. He prayed and said, "Lord, look at them. Look at them. It's disgusting that they would behave this way." And God popped him in a vision and said, "Listen here. I've got something for you." &gt;&gt; And he showed him the earth. And he showed him a bumper of blood around that earth. And then he showed him the face of Christ before it all. And he saw sins coming up out of the earth and hitting Christ in the face like punching him in the face and hurting him and punching him and hurting him and and we know brother Bradom in that moment he was like, "Yeah, amen. That's that woman. That's that cop. That's those people, those sinners." And what did Jesus say to him &gt;&gt; in the vision? He said, "Uhuh. That's not them. That's your sin. &gt;&gt; As the vindicated prophet, that's you. &gt;&gt; Your sins. &gt;&gt; And what did it do? It changed his heart in a moment. It changed his perspective. &gt;&gt; He came out of that vision. And he went and he sat down and he sat sat down and he brought them kindness and love &gt;&gt; and LED THEM TO CHRIST IN THE MOMENT instead of judging them &gt;&gt; because he had a different perspective. Amen. [singing] &gt;&gt; If you ever need a different perspective, just trust the Lord, man. He'll show you. &gt;&gt; He'll give you another perspective. &gt;&gt; Just ask him. &gt;&gt; Just like the prophet did for his helper. Lord, open the boy's eyes. Sometimes we HAVE TO SAY, LORD, OPEN MY EYES. &gt;&gt; Show me what's going on because I'm caught up in the moment. &gt;&gt; We've got a a saying in North America. Sometimes you can't see the forest through the trees. You get so caught up in all of the three or four trees right in front of you, you forget there's an entire forest behind you. &gt;&gt; Sometimes one or two little details can just totally drive us down. &gt;&gt; Let's not forget what he's done for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's not forget [music] how he sees us. &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me. I've got one more quote that I'm going to bring for us because I think it's so beautiful. Remember the last one we read was in 1955. If it anybody wonders pre-seals post seals this is the way it was post seals that was pre-seals and that was pretty good post seals 1965 invisible union the message that was preached the night before he says oh that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word &gt;&gt; and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated brothers and sisters don't put that off on the prophet take that home and say Is the word [music] becoming flesh in me? &gt;&gt; Am I becoming the word manifested and vindicated? My faith demonstrates works in my life. I'm walking towards what I believe. That's the vindication. It's not great signs and wonders. It's putting that word first. &gt;&gt; Just what the Bible said would happen in this day. It's happening day by day. I love that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Whether we see it, whether we understand it, whether we believe it, there's people on earth, this is taking place in their lives where they are becoming the word. The word is becoming flesh in them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just what the Bible said would happen in this day. It's happening day by day. Why? It's culminating so fast out there in those deserts and things taking place that I couldn't keep up with it. We're near the coming of Jesus to be united with his church where the word becomes the word. Not people become the word. The word becomes the word. That genetic seed gene of [music] God that was in us before the foundation of the world. The word becomes the word. Calling of the Holy Spirit, searching of [music] the hearts. Here he is now. He said before, standing like you never did it before. A few paragraphs back. Here he says it now. You standing. You're standing completely. You never sinned at the first place. God don't even know nothing. It's in the sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; He says you never did it. &gt;&gt; Can we say this about our worst enemies here on earth? &gt;&gt; Because if we can't say this about our worst enemies, then we might as well take what the prophet just said [music] and put it on the shelf. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And just wait until God changes our heart. Because the way that we judge is the way that we will be judged. &gt;&gt; But when we're willing to do with our enemies what God has done with our sin, &gt;&gt; then we don't have anything in our hand holding us down. We can just raise our hands to the Lord and say, "Praise you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, because I know what you've done for me. Oh my. You don't even see my sin. It's in the sea of your forgetfulness." To think that that's exactly what he does for us. It's in the sea of forgetfulness. You never did it. You were accused of it by the accuser, but really from the beginning, you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I love it how he says that. It's not even just you're a son and all the daughters are kind of wondering, scratching their head, uh, [music] where am I standing? No, no. He says it to be a son and daughter of God. You're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead. absolutely out of existence &gt;&gt; even in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; How can that be? I don't know. And you know, I don't even care. [music] I just say, "Amen. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here he says, "You're the virtuous bride of Christ, washed in the blood of Christ, precious, virtuous, sinless son of God, standing with the pure, unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood." &gt;&gt; Amen. my that become flesh and [music] manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was. He was that great [music] attribute of God called love. Remember brothers and sisters, the way that he sees us when we take his word, the way that he's given it to us in the day in which we live, the way he sees us is the way he sees Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. Why [music] is that? Because he doesn't look at us. He looks at Christ. &gt;&gt; Help us to look away to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for these words. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that we have the [music] ability to have a different perception, Lord. That you can open our eyes to the things that [music] we need to see. And Father, that you can close our eyes to the things that we don't need to see. Father, I pray that in the world in which we live in that you would help us now more than ever to close our eyes to the things of this world, Lord, and open our eyes to the things of life, Lord. the word in its fullness, Lord Jesus, [music] for the day in which we live because we know that's what will entitle us to your token. And we know that that token is the earnest of what you have given us, Father, because eye has not seen, neither has ear heard. Oh, hasn't even entered into the heart of a man. What lies in store for us. So, Father, we're so excited for that day. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, not to res refuse you, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to consummate that marriage, &gt;&gt; to move from being just a bride, oh Lord Jesus, to becoming your wife, &gt;&gt; to have that level of intimacy where the two become one, &gt;&gt; cuz we know that's what it will take to make the rapture. [music] &gt;&gt; Pray that you would just watch over us, Lord. That you would continue revealing yourself to us and through us. We just ask that you would [music] bless each one, Father, who's made the effort to come out tonight. Be with those, Lord, who couldn't come, Father, wherever they are, whatever they're doing. We pray that you would just minister to them sovereignly wherever they are. Father, maybe some tuning in later, streaming after. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you're not bound by time or space. &gt;&gt; We just ask that you would open our eyes, Lord. We love you and we thank you. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are awesome in this place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are awesome in this place. Mighty God, you are awesome [singing and music] in this place. Aba Father, you are worthy of [singing] all [music] praise. To you our lives we raise. You are awesome [music] in this place. Mighty God, as I come into your presence, as I come into your presence, ask the [music and singing] gates of praise, into your sanctuary, [music and singing] till we're standing face to face. I look upon your mountains. I see the fullness [singing and music] of your grace and I can only bow down. [music] You are [singing] awesome in this place. Mighty God, [music] [singing] you are awesome [music] in this place. Father, you are worthy of all praise. To you [music] are mighty. You are [singing] awesome in this place.
