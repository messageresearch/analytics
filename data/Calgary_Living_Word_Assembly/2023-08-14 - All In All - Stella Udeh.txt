God bless you charge is good to be a Christian yesterday I have been carrying a burden that I could not lift up by myself I sleep with it I wake up with it I at times I will hold myself I will say God please help me so when prayer request was asked yesterday I came out I told my I said what that has been disturbing me and I was prayed for before I left the church the spirit was just you know coming back again I said no I have been prayed for so a song just came into my heart Jesus You Are My All In All I was humming it I was humming when I was going home and I got home I forgot the song I was thinking to say ah this one I I will sing it I will sing it so I used he came back again this period coming back again and gave me this song and I sang it and I sang it I don't I don't know it's of Hearts so I was just singing the one cycle thing so my mind said Come and sing it to the Lord so it's a song you know I joined me and as you listen may God bless you You Are My Strength I when I am weak you are the treasure that I Seek You are my only seeking you as a precious Joe Lord again Lord you look at it sorry Lord give up I'll be our fool you are my only [Music] Jesus Lamb of God is your name Jesus [Music] is your name [Music] taking my sin went Crossing Rising again I bless your name all right when I fall down you pick me up when I am dry you fill my cup you're my only [Music] Jesus name [Music] Jesus [Music] Lamb of God [Music] is your name God bless you [Applause]
