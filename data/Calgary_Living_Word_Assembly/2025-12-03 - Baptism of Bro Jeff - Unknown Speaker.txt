========================================

Praise the Lord. I'm sure both Thank brother Henry for his efforts to make this as accommodating as possible. I hope it will be. We might even get better Jeff just to like go on his knees here. &gt;&gt; If you do that, that'll work. Just go on your knees here and then I'll just pull you back. I trust you. &gt;&gt; Well, come on in, brother. &gt;&gt; Brother John. &gt;&gt; Wow. Big crowd. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thankful to be gathered here together. gave brother John panicker my phone but we have recordings being made so we'll be fine it's all good bless you everyone as we gather together here to witness the the testimony of brother Jeff Page and his desire to actually take a stand for the Lord and uh we know many times the devil is absolutely against this if there's one thing the devil doesn't want it's for us to actually come according to God's word. &gt;&gt; Because if we come according to God's word as we have many of us experienced, then we truly get the gift, the ultimate gift of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And the baptism of the Holy Ghost is going to give us the ability to line up with God's word. Outside of his life, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's impossible, literally impossible for a human being to line up with the word of God. And that's why the prophet taught us clearly that the evidence, the true evidence of the Holy Ghost in our lives is being able to say amen to the word. And that means to live the word, not just agree to the word, but by agreeing to it, we &gt;&gt; live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, I think it's beautiful because it goes even further than that. We just become it. &gt;&gt; We are the word made flesh today. It's what the scriptures say. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the song we sing. So we just uh we just are certainly thankful that we can gather together this way one more time in the presence of everyone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh brother Jeff's testimony on his own was that he wanted to do this dedication of his life, rededication of his life in front of the church body &gt;&gt; as witnesses for his church family that he's made this stand. &gt;&gt; And uh I just think there's no greater desire in the life of a believer. I truly count it an honor and a privilege to be able to stand here with our brother. &gt;&gt; He's become a real good friend of mine and uh I just am so thankful to be able to stand with my brother. &gt;&gt; Let's just have a word of prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for this day. Thank you for this opportunity to gather, Lord, the the way that you've ordained for us in your word, Father. That &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, if we are willing to take you at your word, then you're willing to bless us with your spirit. &gt;&gt; And Father, that's what we need in the age in which we live. When we talk about rapturing faith, it's nothing other than your life literally living through us. And [clears throat] outside of that, there's no way that we will see the rapture. Father, we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done here tonight. Father, we pray that you would keep your hand upon Brother Jeff Page all the days of his life. That you would lead him and guide him in all of his decisions. Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just help erase the past from his memory. &gt;&gt; Father, we know there's scars in our lives that we can't do anything about, but we know that you can help. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to commit each and every one of those scars into your hands tonight in the life of Brother Jeb. Lord Jesus, that when the world looks at Brother Jeb, they wouldn't see a man scarred from the past, but that they would see the literal life of Jesus Christ walking on earth again. Father, we pray for your glory that you would just bless Brother Jeff in every area of his life. Keep sickness away, Lord. Lead him and guide him into all righteousness. We ask &gt;&gt; Father, most of all, we pray that you would just bless him with your spirit in a way like he's never experienced before in his life, &gt;&gt; Lord. And I'm sure he'll be careful to give you the praise. And Father, we as witnesses, as family in this assembly, will stand and rejoice with our brethren. &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you and we thank you. commit this service on our brother into your hands now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you know in Acts chapter 2 the people they saw the people the believers spilling out of the upper room. They had been baptized with the Holy Ghost and it was visible in their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in our lives it's visible. &gt;&gt; Amen. when we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It is not an invisible union &gt;&gt; of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. &gt;&gt; But the people in Acts chapter 2, they saw these people, they heard them speaking in their own dialects, in their own tongues, and they said, "How can this be?" And we know that Peter, he preached up a storm. He preached a sermon. &gt;&gt; And at the end of it, now when they heard this, this is verse 37 of Acts chapter 2, they were pricricked in their heart. They heard the preaching of the word. and they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off. That's us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even as many as the Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So tonight &gt;&gt; we come according to Acts chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't baptize in the name of the Father and the name of the Son, the name of the Holy Ghost even though we do because all of those are combined in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, Brother Jeff, &gt;&gt; by the profession of your own faith, we're going to baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not just so that you can get the gift of the Holy Ghost, but for the remission of your sins, for all the old scars, for all of the old life. &gt;&gt; You no longer have to look back. That song that I sent you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When God looks your way, he no longer sees a sinner. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Jeff Page, &gt;&gt; by the power vested in us as believers, &gt;&gt; we're going to baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And when the devil comes around and tries to make you doubt, you just remind him of this night. &gt;&gt; And just so you know, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just look over there. You're being recorded. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So, you could look back and you can see it. So, if you just want to step forward, brother &gt;&gt; and uh as I said, just Yeah, just do that. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a tsunami here. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Jeff, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name. Blessed [singing] be the name [music] of the Lord. Blessed be the name. [music] Blessed be the name. Blessed be the [singing and music] name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen.
