like to welcome all of our visitors in our gates I trust you feel right at home if you have a need this morning maybe just defy gravity and make it known unto the Lord by the way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for this opportunity to gather together in Your Name Lord Jesus we know that the oh Father the desire in the hearts of your children is to bring Glory unto you father we know there's something on the inside of the inside that can strained us to come here this morning Lord Jesus father we know that there was a time even Before Time Lord where the the the sons of God shouted for Joy Lord we know the morning Stars sang together but father that desire in the heart of your children to shout for Joy because we know what you've done for us Lord that is present this morning in every one of your sons and daughters and father this morning we just ask you Lord now that we've reached this point of the service that you would meet the needs father in the hearts of your children that were made known unto you by an uplift hand father by Defying Gravity Lord and bringing it and giving it unto you father whatever that need is Lord wherever it's at we pray that you would just sovereignly meet that need Lord father we want to remember Brother Don Snow's Aunt Jackie Lord that you would watch over her father that you would touch her body Lord in the midst of this condition father Lord we want to remember brother Aiden Livy Lord father who is suffering from back pain today Lord father we pray that Lord you would just send your Angel by his way father this morning even while we pray Lord father that one more time he would say that I just know that he is my healer am father we miss him and Lord we just ask that you would touch our brother father you would raise him up Lord in perfect health father we love you and we thank you Lord Jesus and we just ask that you would bless our service now Amen in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen hallelujah thank you musicians you have your Bibles this morning I'd just like to read from Isaiah chapter 59 Isaiah chapter 59 a little bit of a different direction but I think kind of in conjunction to our last service I thought it was a a pretty difficult one for me but many people were encouraged by it and I'm certainly thankful for for that because I would never want to bring something on my own um we certainly want to follow the leadership of the Lord um Isaiah chapter 59 we'll start reading with verse 17 Isaiah 5917 for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay Fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your word we thank you Lord that your word is applicable to every single one of us Lord and every single day that we live amen father we pray that you would take this bread of life that we've read and that you would break it open fresh to us Lord once again that father when we leave this building today we would say that truly you spoke to us amen father we love you and we thank you we just commit the service and all that's said and done into your hands For Your Glory now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated did this morning just uh one announcement today that I thought was really wonderful that I I know was a wonderful thing for everyone but uh just wanted to announce that brother John panicker is an uncle now for the third time God bless you brother for those of you that know brother John panicker and and his situation he's living with his brother and uh his brother had a baby I guess yesterday we're certainly excited to see what the Lord has in store for you brother and uh for your brother's children are you happy this morning I uh don't have many announcements I didn't really want to go too far that way I just wanted to talk about the the spirit of the the Lord today raising up a standard in our lives and if I had to make a title for today I wanted to say a standard and uh I think that's really the age in which we live in we're living in an age where there has to be a standard set we know that the enemy has come in like a flood we don't have to look around very far to see what the enemy is doing inside the world because we know that there's two Spirits at work in this world there's the spirit of Christ and there's the spirit of the anti Christ and some people might say well there's the spirit of the devil but I want to say this the devil is the most religious individual on Earth there's the spirit of the Antichrist and there's the spirit of Christ there's Satan and there's God there's one or the other there's no middle ground there's no delution there's no mixture any mixture outside of the Holy Ghost is Antichrist right any hybridization today we're talking about setting a standard last time we spoke uh we talked about having a standard in our lives and Lord willing I'm not going to be as heavy as I was last time I'm still sort of reeling from that and I uh yeah it's not easy to be here but uh we have a standard to uphold and uh that's the standard that we will hold and uh we know that brother bradam talks about it you know what if nobody else were to go with us we're going to follow this word of God we have got to follow follow the word of God that's the only thing that's going to help us in this world before we get too far I just wanted to mention uh we put out a notice about the brethren in Philippines in the Middle Island that actually were flooded severely and uh so we actually uh I just got a couple of pictures from brother mvin that uh this this information came from Brother mvin originally and uh we just wanted to bring a little update for what's actually happened in terms of uh the flooding that that happened there so bear with me for just one second did you get an email from me this morning good stuff so You' got the pictures you can go ahead and uh post the first picture if you don't mind I'm just going to come here yeah there we go so there's some videos too that we can share if you would like um we had put out a notice for the church that this flooding happened it was because of uh was it a cyclone a hurricane yeah yeah typhoon that was the word I was thinking of it was a typhoon that happened and uh it was the worst typhoon I think that hit the island in recorded history and uh the brothers and sisters there brother mvin indicated from brother Ryan in Philippines there that directly 33 families and their congregation were severely affected most of them lost almost everything the flooding has subsided this was actually sent on Thursday as well the flooding has subsided to Knee Deep now in the ground floor of the church and so this is the before picture of the church and then we could just go to the after pictures I think there's is there another one is there another picture there that's the before and that's the after so everyone has sought refuge in there um brought their stuff into the church and we were able to raise some money and send it directly to them so I just wanted to just make a little notice about that so we understand what's actually happening and brother mvin and sister Fay are going over there next month they're going to Philippines and I believe they're going to give us a bit of a report on what's actually taking place but you can see the the church now sort of the before it was nice and orderly and now everyone's just crammed in there but it's interesting because we know the the the name of the Lord is a strong tower hey and and he provides a place for the righteous to run into and we know the natural typees the spiritual but this just really got me thinking about how the enemy comes in like a flood and it seems to be happening more and more the the more we we we see things in this world thank you brother that's all I want to show for pictures um I just wanted to bring a note with this um it goes into conjunction with what we're we're talking about today and it's out of Isaiah 59: 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun which is the East when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him what I want to talk about today is the the standard that will be lifted up against the enemy I'm going to jump right to the end of the service right now so we can just wrap up and go home because I can see it's already 20 to 12 but you know brothers and sisters I think it's really important for us to understand just to bring some balance from last time we spoke I made it maybe sound like there's so much for us to do and we need to make sure that we're in line and we're conforming which is 100% correct but not with a man this is the critical Factor the word says when the enemy shall come in like a flood mean meaning that he will when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the church shall raise up a standard the spirit of the parents shall raise up a standard oh the spirit of the family no everybody's quiet right because it's wrong the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard we cannot allow tradition we cannot allow a church we cannot allow an association or a membership it's got to be the spirit of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever outside of that it will fail and you know honestly that's why most of the people in this world are grossed out with Christianity today because everyone is trying to raise up a standard themselves but then they'll turn around on Monday morning and go and pull a dirty deal in business or they'll go and talk about someone or they or they or they you know you know what I'm talking about that's the world in which we live in but we're not living in an age where we're talking about just conforming to a church we know there was a time where there was a reformation and I think it just is so good I'm going to read out of the exposition of the seven Church ages this morning just to maybe get us going brother bam talking about the warning out of the sardan church age out of Revelations 3 3:2 Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have F not found thy works perfect before God even though they knew what they needed to do paragraph 63 here he says I wish it could be said that the sardan age was a restoration instead of a Reformation I cannot say that the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it a Reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been another penic costal age but it was not the best that could be said of it was strengthen that which remains that's ready to die and it just makes me think when I I read those words sort of a quote that I got in my heart when I grew up in the Pentecostal ranks and I I started to look around and see people living trying to live a standard but not being able to live it and and recognizing that you know what this is this is not going to work for me because I would rather just be honest about who I am and what I'm doing I would rather not go and and sin all week long and then come to church and pretend like everything is fine now I'm not saying everybody does that I know for sure that even in the Pentecostal ranks the prophet in our day said there's Believers amen there's Believers in every single denomination and we never want to Discount anyone but where I was I started to look at the carnality because I was immature and that's what we do right but I remember thinking you know what the the the word of God here it says the best that brother bam saying it not the word of God just to be clear the best that could be said of it was strength and that which remains that is ready to die those people that were there and I I remember as I was getting to it was I I thought in myself why would I pretend to be a Christian when tomorrow we die might as well eat and drink drink and just be married like everyone else in the world right there's revelings there's parties there's celebrations there's things that we could be participating in just like everybody else and everybody else still prospers they have good health they've got good jobs they have houses everything is fine in their life but is it if they were to come to the place where they were going to to to lie down on their deathbed right then would they know where they're going to go because that's what the Crux of all this is and terms of basic Christianity but when we go to the place where we are today well beyond the Reformation that brother bram's talking about here we might as well eat and drink and be merried because tomorrow we die we need to recognize we're not just reforming there's a restoration that took place which is pasted the reformation and that restoration has done something brother Ry goes on to say in the next paragraph there was something missing my yes there certainly was this age had justification but it had Miss sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost we talked about this on Wednesday we have all three of those but I want to say this brothers and sisters just to take it and make it real basic and easy for us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our life we have one all of those three are one it's not a trinitarian Doctrine it's understanding that the Holy Ghost brings all of that justification and sanctification to our lives he goes on to say that's what God's original plan was that is what they had at Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified they were filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to me the reason for being justified and Sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the Holy Ghost now sometimes we can find ourselves Justified and we can find ourselves Sanctified but not filled with the Holy Ghost you can have both of those but not have the person of Jesus Christ Living out through us we can be very good people we could be tremendous Christian people a part of a wonderful Church body but still not be baptized with the Holy Ghost and we know there's evidences of the Holy Ghost the true evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost be able to say Amen to the word for your day we know that those people who are sighing and crying for the Abominations of the land we know that and and there's varying degrees of both of those but the one who truly has the baptism of the Holy Ghost will say amen God sent a prophet and I believe it and that settles it there won't be any confusion around that but I just think it's beautiful they were Justified they were Sanctified they were filled with the Holy Ghost those people at Pentecost and I believe that's where we are today brothers and sisters Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost when we have that there's no more Reformation even the restoration it goes beyond restoration because it was restored for a reason and the reason is so that the hearts of the Pentecostal children could be turned back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers now you might say well why did you say it that way brother Barry because if they were children they always were children we didn't just become a child of God one day we always were a child of God one day but through the restoration of the word through a Vindicated Prophet it gives us the ability to recognize that always were a son or a daughter of God they were Justified those Folks at Pentecost they were Sanctified they were filled with the Holy Ghost why listen to me the reason for being justified Sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the Holy Ghost that is the reason that there is a church period there could be soup kitchens my there could be work work bees there could be things where we help people maybe in floods times of floods we go and help people we offer space for people that need a a home after their home has been destroyed there could be financial aid there could be prayer meetings for people that need prayer but you know the prophet I'd say God through the prophet says very clearly the end of it all is so that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost am and what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's Jesus Christ the person of Jesus his spirit that when he died on the cross and he said it's finished he bowed his head and the word says that he gave up the ghost that ghost was given up for a reason not to go back up to heaven but to come back upon Earth so that we could all partake of his spirit I think it's beautiful brother bam says that's the reason that there is a church it is the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost so now I want to say this Where's the temple the temple isn't a building some people would say it especially if you're a Mormon you would say well they got a brand new Temple up in Northwest Calgary if you've ever been there it's spectacular it's stunning everything that's in there is from handmade from around the world nothing really is made locally it's it's all from around the world there's a temple in Cardston there's all kinds of temples there's many different temples there's mesonic temples we know many many temples there's going to be a third temple in Israel where we're not talking about those temples though we're talking about the Temple of the Holy Ghost and what does the word of God say the word of God says know ye not that ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghost that's why brothers and sisters we're talking about setting a standard it's not just something that we talk about it's not just something that we say well you know we're good people we do this or we don't do that there's a reason why we have a restoration to the word and not a ref formation I think that's just such a beautiful thought it's a restoration back to the original word not a a Reformation we're not taught to to conform it's not about that it's not about being reformed we know uh certain kids in their lives maybe like myself when I was a kid I know there was a discussion where my dad wanted to send me potentially he actually offered it to me at one point I could send you to a military school would you like that and uh you know the reason for that is for a Reformation parents don't know what to do with their children anymore because they're rebelling they're they're they're getting out of hand and I remember my dad really wanted to see me get reformed and I'm certainly thankful for that because he held a standard in my life and I knew what that standard was and there came a point in time where I could no longer live according to my my dad's standard so I had to leave I had to go my own way and you know it's wonderful because even though the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard my dad raised his standard only so high you can only raise your standard so high for your children brothers and sisters but you've got to be the Holy Ghost for your children until the age of accountability and when you do that you hold that standard but there comes a point in time where you can no longer reach high enough to get that standard that the spirit of God will live for your children they have got to go on to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what it's all about we just read that in the church age book The Spirit of the Lord will raise up the standard not us and when we try and do itall when we try and do it you know what usually happens is we usually make a mess of it we usually do I remember when brother Ken was Pastor here there were situations that would happen and uh I was a deacon and uh there's times where you would say brother can you know this brother can you know that brother can you know the other thing and he would say yeah I know and you'd be like why haven't you acted on that why haven't you done something you're the pastor because he would say you know what when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard the spirit of the Lord will raise up the standard and it's not about jumping on and trying to do and fix we need to deal with this prayerfully we need to deal with it in a spiritual light and if we don't do it we're going to make a mess of it humanly speaking brothers and sisters today I want to talk about holding up a standard and understanding that that standard that we hold up is not our standard it's his standard the standards that we live in our lives are his standards the reason why the sisters don't wear garments that pertain to a man is because the word of God says that the reason why sisters don't cut their hair is because the word of God says that those are the standards that we live by because that's what the word of God says some people would say well brother bradam William Mariam bradam he brought that on the scene that guy that you guys follow that that that's the one that that set all these in motion no he didn't read your Bible Paul said it Paul the Apostle the first church age messenger he's the one that set the church in motion he's the one that set the church in order and any other pattern after that is false even William brandham preached what Paul preached amen for the purpose of keeping the church exactly in order he didn't bring something new in fact what he pointed to was what Paul said if anybody else comes and preaches another gospel to you then that which I've already preached to you let him be a cursed so why would we think it's any different you know I I was having a conversation with a brother the other day and I thought it was so funny it was the first time I'd ever heard it before but this is the age in which we live in if you look back into the early 1900s at pictures we we I'm just getting excited I guess we were in a a restaurant and it was all about the the early train days and there was a picture in there in Calgary of Calgary and how it was the very first time a steam locomotive had come to town the very first time and they brought fresh oysters I think from the East Coast all the way to Calgary the very first train that ever made it to Calgary and everybody came out it was on a Sunday everybody who was able to anyways came out to see this train in the train yard and it was a fascinating thing and they had one picture a black and white picture of all the people and if you looked at all the people all you could see was people dressed in their very best and you didn't see women dressed wearing pants you saw women wearing dresses back in the 1900s you could look anywhere go and take a picture over in in Europe or in Africa or anywhere you go outside of maybe tribal dress you would see people women wearing garments that pertain to a woman and you would see men wearing garments that pertain to a man there was no confusion now the the blood the lines are so blurred you can't tell which is which and I mean we don't even need to get into gender I'm not going to do that but I just want to make the simple comparison we were talking the other day about uh sisters wearing garments that pertain to a man they're wearing jeans blue jeans I grew up with girls wearing blue jeans it was normal for me in my life to see it everywhere and and it was shocking for me to see that there was there was people that just sisters females just didn't wear pants I was like what kind of thing is that but we're able to take it back to the word of God then I was able to say okay amen I'll just take it by faith that's what the word of God says that's what I'm going to follow amen but you know talking to this brother the other day he said you know talking to a a girl wearing pants and having the discussion just an open free conversation you're not supposed to wear garments that pertain to a man that's what the word of God says she says I'm not he's like well you're wearing blue jeans she says well these blue jeans are female blue jeans they're jeans for a girl that's how blurry the lines are isn't it it's the world in which we live in we need to know what's what we need to know exactly where we stand what is a garment that pertains to a man I'm not going to go too far into that today but I want to say this it's in the word of God just like not cutting your hair as a sister is in the word of God now those are two natural outwardly Expressions that are so a parent and a sister Brothers we need to pray for our sisters they're moving Targets in this world they walk in this world and everybody looks at them everybody does but you know I think that standard is interesting to see on a sister how important it is and how we harp on it I want to take it now and look at the other side of the coin let's talk about the brothers now I don't want to talk about clothes because I'm not worried about clothes in a brother I think get the Holy Ghost but what's standard are we living as brothers are we living a scriptural standard in our lives because the sisters are looking for leadership they're not looking for equals they're not looking for someone on an even Keel that's that's not going to challenge them they're looking for true leadership according to the word of God as brothers as husbands as future husbands is that what we are doing is that what we're being taught in our lives or is it just LAX isical is it just as we go we're equal we're not equal it's not because the man is greater it's because the man has a greater responsibility he's responsible for the children he's responsible for the wife he's responsible for the entire family's actions amen God did not come down in the Garden of Eden and say Eve Eve Where Art Thou fully knowing who she was and where they were knowing where they were hiding he came down and said Adam where are you because Adam is the one that was responsible Eve was a part of Adam Adam complete responsibility for her his responsibility to make sure that standard was upheld in the Garden of Eden we can eat from any single tree in the garden Eve any tree do you know that God never came down and said to Eve you can't eat from every tree in the garden he came down and told that to Adam and if you take it from the scriptural perspective from the Insight of a prophet it was actually while they were yet one the feminist was still inside of Adam so perhaps she being he inside of him heard it but you can rest assured that he spoke it that Adam said to her we can have whatever we want in this Garden except for that and we know that while she was in Adam there was no temptation there was no no issue no problem as long as she was under the leadership of her husband while she was yet inside of him but as soon as she actually came out from him as soon as she was exposed my then Satan came around then Satan came and actually tried to mess with that standard that was set Isaiah 59 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him I just want to try and encourage us today brothers and sisters I'm not doing this as a Sunday school to teach us I'm doing it maybe as a little bit of preaching just to encourage us there is a standard that's raised as we live in this world and we see how dark this world is getting we see how terrible things are getting and you know what unfortunately the the Outlook looks Grim it's not going to get a whole lot better naturally speaking in this world until there is a a a renovation of this entire world it's going to keep spiraling down and down and down darker and darker and darker and as we go you know how dark it's getting it's terrible and tragic we can keep talking like that but what I want to do today is trying and encourage us that the darker it gets the brighter the Bride of Jesus Christ shines not just to stand out as a Target brother brandom he says it you know what happens what'll happen right at the end of days it'll be a short powerful demonstration of the power of God to his bride there's going to be a persecution against the church and it's already happening it's the age in which we live in the prophet in uh Israel and the church in 1953 I know this goes back a long ways but uh I just think the thought is good you know he says no wonder Christianity can't even lift up a standard it's because not because Christ is not able it's not because Christ is not able brothers and sisters but because that the people won't do it it just made me think about it you know we can have all kinds of things in our lives all kinds of reasons I'm certainly thankful that brother Ken he taught you know I I I think it's a beautiful thing you know any excuse is good enough when you really don't want to do something but the Ken used to say that all the time any excuse is good enough when you really don't want to do it no wonder Christianity can't even lift up a standard it's because not because Christ is not able but because the people won't do it the message is ready here we are in 19 when 53 before the seals back when he was a prophet the message is ready the power of God is sufficient men and women are scared to break out yawn into those spheres before God and dare to trust him to take him at his word I want to challenge us today I want to encourage us today don't be afraid Don't Be Afraid brothers and sisters to break out yonder into those fears before God and dare to trust him to take him at his word how do you do that break out of the ordinary you know what if you want to see different results in your lives brothers and sisters speaking of myself I know this if I want to see different results in my life I got to do things different it's that simple if I just keep going on doing the same thing over and over and over again hoping for a different result that's the definition of insanity if I want to see the power of God move if I want to break out into those other places then I need to do something different and you know what the prophet said the thing that we will never do enough of is pray if we want to see God move in our lives we got to be willing to make a sacrifice in our life and that sacrifice isn't just saying you know I'm going to offer some money and say you know that's my tithe and my offering and you know God is good I'm not just going to turn up on a Sunday and say I'm just G to put my shoulder to the wheel and I'm gonna sing The Gospel we've got to have a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ ourselves personally men and women are scared to break out yonder into those spheres is anybody scared here today you don't have to raise your hand you know what it's a real thing I want to say fear is a real thing it's a big thing that we're contending with today just like anxiety the devil doesn't want to be exposed so he's going to grip your heart with fear and tell you it's not going to happen if you step out into those fears then then everybody's going to look at you and say oh look at that fanatic look at I always knew that he was a little bit weird he's always been a little bit funny that guy stepping out into those fears that sister who has always maybe cried or or or sang a little bit loud acted just a little bit funny that's the devil talking do it anyway amen the prophet of God says if you fear something just go the opposite way it just go the opposite way if you don't know or you don't like what you see just do the Opposites give the devil something to fear don't don't let him see you fear give the devil something to fear you want to do something different I didn't make any announcements I'll say it tonight or this morning there's a prayer meeting Thursday night at the church here at 7:30 you want to do something different come to a prayer meeting and see if God won't actually come on the scene for your needs when we get together and we pray we get together and we bring forth the need before the body before the few people that gather and we actually pray together for that need so that God will come on the scene and intercede many times people will say oh brother Barry I I pray in my prayer closet and that's where my success happens if that's all it is then that's great God bless you but if you want to see more there's more to have amen I want to tell you there's something that happens you know this word standard out of strongs concordance 5127 it says to subside to escape to causatively chase impel deliver a baate a way be displayed all kinds of descriptive words here the end of it I think really kind of makes the sense the most is to be displayed make to flee put to flight to hide to lift up a standard and remember brothers and sisters we can only go so far with the standard we can only go so far when we try and actually uphold the standard what we do is we actually take away the power of God not that we can ever take away the power of God we'll never diminish God but he's looking for hands he's looking for feet he's looking for bodies that he can work through amen but if we're not willing to come according to his word then his standard isn't going to be upheld by him he's going to say I'll just wait until you're ready and as soon as you're ready I will know because of your actions your actions will show when you're ready your words are one thing but your actual actions display another thing I think it's so beautiful how he will actually do it you know looking at the story of the Ducks brother randam tells the story the Ducks we're all familiar with it I'm not going to talk too far about it today but I just have two comparisons you know one of them is of the Ducks the story of the Ducks how the the man the farmer was Raising ducks and he had a pond or a stream maybe a pond by the stream and he had them segregated into different sections with fences and they were all there there were different breeds of ducks maybe they were the same breed of duck and and they were all just there but they couldn't really Fellowship together because the fences were in the way but you know what happened was the the flood came in and what happened when that flood came in the water Rose and those fences disappeared and as soon as the fences disappeared the Ducks they could have Fellowship one with another just an interesting little story another one that he talks about is the story of the Corn growing in the fields you can see the different Farmers Fields he talks about a man flying in an airplane over top of the corn fields you can see the different fields all along the way and you know as they would fly over and check the crops over the year there came a point point in time where there was no longer any fences visible why was that because the corn started to mature as it grew it grew together and it grew over top of the fences and it actually blocked out the fences and you couldn't see any division amongst them and I think that's what's happening today in in the world in which we live in as spiritual Believers we can look around in this world and and naturally speaking not say that that's what's happening it is happening when you look at the world world and how evil it's getting it's getting more and more evil and there's way less definition between the camps it's either evil or it's good that's the way it's going and I mean if you want to really nail it down we could simply say this how many parties in the province of Alberta political parties just in the province of Alberta are not supporting the lgbtq communities which political party could you vote for today that would say I take stand against it and I will not actually allow it there's not one political party all of them support it so doesn't matter what way we go my point is it's dark spiritually speaking it's dark there's nothing we can do about it but you know what I want to talk about today brothers and sisters is not actually a restoration uh a a Reformation I want to talk about the restoration the restoration is to actually take us somewhere to bring us back to a a a word of God uh a complete word of God we know that the Restoration in the age in which we live in took us back to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost before that there was many people thinking they were getting baptized and and receiving the true baptism of the holy spirit in their lives but they they maybe weren't able to because the word of God was actually not being applied correctly in their lives I wouldn't doubt for a second that there was people being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before William Mary and brandham came on the scene and that they were truly receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost I would not diminish that because the baptism of the Holy Ghost was given on the day of Pentecost and brother bradam even said it when did the apostolic age cease because there's people today that believe the apostolic age ceased he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost was given at Pentecost in the upper room and it hasn't been taken away amen but what's happened is Satan we've read it very clearly in the exposition of the seven Church ages how Satan has come in and through politics and and and all the different isms inside the churches what he's done is he's eroded people's faith and that's the way the devil Works he comes in and he erodes people's Faith it's interesting when you go to a river and you look at a river how the river banks are and how they work you can look around and you can see man everything is eroded in here but it's just a trickling little stream at the bottom how can that be there's a time once in a while where the enemy the water comes in like a flood and it's a deluge and it just absolutely reshapes everything the devil is always at work he's completely continually trying to erode the faith of the Believers and we know that he has time on his side that's why he does it that way he can do just a little bit today just a little bit tomorrow just a little bit next week just a little bit 10 years from now just a little bit here and a little bit there and what happens is before long we're away from the original word that is what the restoration of the word in our day brought it brought the opening of the seals it brought the complete understanding of the word in our day I'm not going to go too far into that but what I want to talk about is this this Reformation brought us to a place of restoration the restoration brought us to the place of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost we read that in the book here um the exposition of the church ages brother Ram says why listen to me the reason for being justified Sanctified is to the end that you might have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you might have the baptism of the Holy Ghost why would we want to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we would want to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that we could be changed ourselves amen right so that we would no longer be the same people that we used to be I used to smoke I used to drink I used to listen to nasty stuff I used to watch nasty stuff I used to be a part of this world but you know what something happened to me somewhere along the way God came into my life and changed me he did not reform me he didn't show me how to conform but he showed me how to transform we know the word of God says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service that's what we need to do is say Lord I am here I am ready fill me with your spirit Lord he goes on to say and be not conformed to this world and I want to say don't be conformed to the world but don't just come in through the doors and be conformed to a church be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God how are we ever going to prove that by simply living it that's how we're going to prove it brothers and sisters people around us will say who are you and what have you done with Buddy what have you done with that that man what have you done with that sister why are you so different what is it about you and you know what it is sometimes you hear what what is it about you people wow there's something something about us you ask me why I'm happy so I'll just tell you why it's because I know my sins are gone I know where they are they're underneath that bumper of blood that was shed at Calvary you know there were reformers they brought Reformation the ability to live in a condition they they they they we even see people today like I said earlier you know a military school oh thank the Lord that I didn't go there I didn't I didn't need to learn how to live in the condition which I was in I needed to to to learn that there was a deliverer from the condition that I was in I I didn't want to learn just to accept what's around me so that I could say that I just have to accept these genetics that I've been given in my life and all of the shortcomings of my world that's just something I have to accept and live with my no no we know brother Bram he taught the story about justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and uh he used the example of how you can have a chicken yard and if anybody knows what I'm talking about we use this example a lot we have chickens at home but if you have a chicken yard it's pretty disgusting where the chickens live they're not really clean creatures and excuse me in the chicken yard you can have a cup you can have a coffee cup maybe your favorite shiny coffee mug and and go and set it just set it on the chicken yard for a little while and see what happens if you left it maybe excuse me over the winter you would see that by Springtime that chicken chicken yard would probably have it just half covered and and maybe manure and and dirt just by the way they get in there and they scratch and they make such a mess and some rain come and and splatters mud on it and that cup would soon not be worthy of use that that cup would be written off you'd be like I'm never going to drink out of that cup again maybe I would scoop some food or something with it for the chickens but that's it but you know brother Bram using the example of a cup in the chicken yard how that cup can be there and and justification is an example of someone coming and picking that cup up from the chicken yard it's no longer there just left rotting in the chicken yard being mistreated being abused being made filthy and and that's an example of justification in this world when we become Justified we're no longer just in this world in the manure pile we're kind of set aside and and we're just taken up from that sinful place that we were in but then the sanctification is the sanitization that's how I was able to remember it that cup was taken and soaked in a bowl of bleach and after it had soaked for maybe a couple of weeks in that bleach completely immersed all the germs being killed from it the sanctification process take it out now and boil it in a bowl in a pot on the stove and and you boil all of the other stuff out of it and then maybe once all that's done you take it and put it in the sanitized cycle in the dishwasher and you now you have that cup that is Justified it's picked up out of the manure then you take it and it gets sanitized it becomes Sanctified it gets all of the nasty filth burned out of it it's cleaned out of it it's completely sanctified but then you don't leave it there if you leave it there something's going to fill that cup something will fill that cup and sometimes I think that can be to the detriment of the Sons and Daughters of God they come to the place where they recognize I'm no longer who I used to be my goodness I am sanitized I am really good in my condition I've never felt so good I've never looked so good but you know what something's going to fill it the word of God talks about how when we are cleansed human beings are cleansed the temple has a devil cast out of it what happen that devil is going to go in Rome out in dry places and say man I remember that place that I was at that Sanctified cup is so beautiful it actually wouldn't be thinking that I'd be thinking about the filthy cup in the chicken yard but he'd be thinking about that place that he was at and then he's going to come back and take a look and see is there something in that cup if there's nothing in that cup then what's he going to do the word of God says that he'll jump right back in and he'll bring seven worse Devils than he had before Justified picked up Sanctified sanitized and set aside on for service just put back in the cupboard now this cup has a purpose I missed this cup it was down in the chicken yard and now it's saved again but you know it's no good it's no good you're just going to speak naturally unless you can take it and pull it out of the cupboard and fill it with coffee and use it or fill it with water or milk or whatever it is you drink but you know that's the example the prophet brought the cup Justified Sanctified but you know what we're talking about human beings we've got to be taken out of the manure pile we've got to be cleaned up and and sanitized in our lives we have to go from just recognizing a re reformation and a and a and a justification a restoration we need to go back to the original word and actually get the baptism of the Holy Ghost when we get that in our lives then we actually seal out all of the attacks of the enemy amen you know brother Ram he talked about it I think it's so important to to mention how the polarization of covid how people were so afraid that it was you know of the devil and everything was going on some were saying the Catholic Church all the conspiracy stuff and then even with the vaccine and the vaccine and Bill Gates and all the different conspiracy theories and everything going on I'm not a conspiracy theorist I'm not trying to bring that to us what I am trying to say is this people were saying that a shot in the arm is going to give you the mark of the beast in our day today even Believers were saying that it was designed to change you genetically we know that we had a prophet that said Mark 16 in action is the only true church and all else is false amen and I remember myself coming to the place with covid and I'm not trying to say anything about me this is just my own Revelation some people might be getting grossed out right about now but just bear with me for a second I I recognize the only way we're going to get our doors open here on the church is to roll up our sleeves and say we're willing to get a vaccine so I said you know what Mark 16 in action I'll roll up my sleeve give me a shot go ahead I'll take the shot because if it's going to kill me then I'm only going to go to heaven I'm not going to die the prophet of God said the mark of the beast is already in us we can't reject it the mark of the beast is actually to reject the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the mark of the beast and you know there's coming a day sure enough there is there's coming a day where they're going to put a chip or whatever they're going to do something in the hand something in the forehead I believe that with all my heart but the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to be long gone because she recognized what the prophet of God said he said the mark of the beast is not what we think it is the mark in the back of the hand is actually the action to the thought in the forehead of the human being that's the mark of the beast spiritually speaking there's always a spiritual type before the natural because the natural types the spiritual there will be a time with the mark of the beast don't get me wrong but I just want to say we don't have to worry about that if we go and get filled with the Holy Ghost all we have to do is get the baptism of the holy spirit in our lives and you know it's the person of Jesus Christ it's his very life living out through us the person of Jesus it's not the second or the third person of a trinity it's the person God himself his manifestation in flesh that's how God chose to represent himself to the body and you know it's fine to talk about him in theory but I just want to say and it's kind of where I was feeling about the enemy com in like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against it but you know it's fine to talk about it in theory but what about us today where are we at today can we say for sure I know I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not looking for a show of hands what I am looking for is Honest Hearts I want to know if we're looking inside our hearts and saying yes I know brother Barry I know it I know I got the holy ghost in my life or no I just don't know brother Barry if I got the Holy Ghost in my life I believe this is God crying out in the final days of the final age you have the opportunity to get the Holy Ghost if you want them it's not brother Barry crying out you can say it is oh it's just brother Barry okay but is it where are we at what are we doing brothers and sisters 1954 the end time brother Bram says you always talk about how bad the world is how Wicked the world is that's true my goodness we're only just 20 after 11 here I was feeling guilty like we're 20 after 12 my we got lots of time Hallelujah you always talk about how bad the world is how Wicked the world is that's true but look how great the church is getting all the time we fail to look at that side brothers and sisters let's not fail to look at that side that's where I want to say if we do have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we got nothing to fear there's nothing in this world that we need to fear there's no person there's no government there's no issue no problem everything can be resolved in such a supernatural way that we never even imagine it could be resolved but we're moving into this place where brother Ram is talking about the world is getting dark and dark darker and darker but look how great the church is getting all the time some people here might say say yeah well where's all the signs and wonders I can tell you I've witnessed some very Supernatural things just me how about you you ever seen the power of God come into your life in such a way that you could never have imagined when the spirit the enemy has come into your life like a flood has not the spirit of Lord raised up a standard against that enemy he says that's true but look how great the church is getting all the time we fail to look at that side Jesus said let them grow together he's talking about the two Vines when the world's getting wickeder and wickeder and wickeder the church is getting more powerful and more powerful all the time the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard against it Hallelujah let's go Glory the winds are blowing set your sails Hallelujah move right into the face of the storm what human nature says I want to run inside I want to run into that strong tower I want to find that place that's out of the wind no no that's not what we're instructed to do we're instructed to set our sail plant our Rudder and go right into the face of the storm move into the face of the storm what do you care who's the captain and that's where I want to say when I see folks getting really upset and really really really up upset over situations who's the captain in your boat did you forget that Jesus is in the back just having a nap go wake Jesus call him on the scene who's your captain he will take care of it now don't fear I'm always there see remember brothers and sisters it's not our spirit that's going to raise up the standard and many times I think that's what we try we try to raise up the standard in our lives in our homes Even in our churches brothers and sisters we can be the ones that say oh my I I can see this is wrong and we need to do this another way why don't we allow the spirit of the Lord to come on the scene and actually make the changes that need to happen 1956 the junction of time and now notice again that not only that when all hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose also all Heaven turns loose also when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against it and these two forces is always showed at the junction that's why I think you know as terrible as it is when something terrible is going on as a Believer I look at the situ now and I can say you know what the Lord is actually moving this is not just Satan doing his thing many times we can look at it and say oh the devil the devil the devil excuse me but we need to keep saying or start saying the Lord the Lord the Lord Satan can't do nothing unless he first gets permission from the Lord the devil's going out around as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour we know that's the scripture but we know that nothing happens unless God first allows it there's nothing that the devil can do God is never surprised I think this verse 17 of Isaiah 59 is just beautiful 17 and 18 how he explains this here for he put on righteousness as a breastplate the Lord Jesus put on righteousness he put it on we didn't put it on our our righteousness is like a filthy rag it's but a filthy rag before him he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak and we know that this is right out of Ephesians chapter 6 maybe we should turn over there just for the the sake of a little study today Hebrews chapter 6 is it sorry it's Ephesians I said Hebrews I don't know why I said that Ephesians chapter 6 Ephesians chapter 6 this is where I think the word of God is so wonderful because some folks would say it's contrary but we know by the spirit that it never contradicts the word of God is always always in course verse 10 of Ephesians chapter 6 Paul speaking to the Ephesian church he says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might amen put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil now I just want to say how are we ever going to put on the armor of God there's no way that as human beings we're ever going to put on the armor of God we can we can we know that we've seen it in Sunday school it's a wonderful uh depiction how you can have the sword of the spirit and the helmet of salvation you can have the breastplate of righteousness you can have all these different things that we're going to read about here and as a as a Believer we can't just go and and get one of those from our church we can't just talk to the kind old priest or the pastor and and get one it's not us achieving another level in the word that gets us these things what gets us these things how do we put on the whole armor of God brothers and sisters it's a real simple answer you get filled with the Holy Ghost you get Jesus Christ the person of Jesus Christ in your life sealed until the day of your Redemption when that happens you put on the whole armor of God finally my brethren be strong in the Lord in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil so I want to say this without the whole armor of God you you ain't going to stand it's not going to be possible to withstand the Ws of the devil we will not do that why because we wrestle not against flesh and blood but it againsts principalities and Powers principalities are like a I heard a brother say it one time it's like a manager it's like a a company's manager that has a whole plethora of workers below him just waiting to do exactly what they're instructed a principality is someone that has a lot of workers so someone who has a lot of power and influence we are wrestling against principalities brothers and sisters against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God we're instructed to do this take unto us the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand we come to a place where that standard is the threshold we can only just go that far on our own and it takes the Lord to take us Beyond there wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins GED about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God we have the whole armor of God that is actually spoken about by Paul the Apostle but he didn't just come up with this on his own the prophet Isaiah already spoke about it the prophet Isaiah brought it so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and His glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard against him it's just such a beautiful thing in 1956 the infallibility of God's spoken word he said and Joel in that day I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your young men shall see Visions upon my handmaids and my Maids will I pour out of my spirit he's not just going to pour out his Spirit maybe just from the pulpit I think that's such an important thing to recognize it's important for us to understand upon my handmaids and my Maids will I pour out my spirit I'll show signs in the heaven above flying saucers and everything when has there ever been so much talk about flying saucers about UFOs and whether the US government is going to release the information or not we know the prophet of God said they're investigating judgment angels and you know if you actually take those words and and you accept them and say wow that's what the prophet said okay that's interesting because how many sightings and announcements of the investigating judgment angels are there now it it's it's quite apparent that something is just about to happen in this world flying saucers and everything all kinds of Mystic signs in the heavens above signs on the earth below there will be a sea roaring tidal waves breaking along Chicago did you ever hear that before I had never heard that before tidal waves breaking along Chicago and that's on a great lake and all down along the places Great Sea a roaring men's heart failing perplex the time distress between nations oh my if you look at the distress between nations right now it is it's getting pretty tense out there it's getting pretty tense out there and in that day the great anointed church was to rise in her power and I want to say this in that day the great anointed church is to rise in her power and in that day the great anointed church is rising in her power it's not going to happen sometime it's not just History either Jesus Christ was to come in when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against it and today when science is doing all their different things than God sending down Supernatural signs to show his church take your mind off the things of the world and look up don't be looking at this world don't be looking at one another don't be looking at Great ministers on the earth here he doesn't want us to do that he wants us to look at him take your mind off the things of the world and look up I love this you're in the ladder now you're anchored both in glory and in heaven amen that latter has two ends to it amen you know this is out of the story Jacob Jacob's Ladder when Jacob he had left he didn't know where he was going he found a pillow and and he slept and he had a dream the pillow was a rock and we know that he had the the rock of Revelation in his life and he rested upon that rock but God showed him a vision of a ladder and he showed Angels ascending and descending on this ladder and that's what this is about the ladder has two ends to it amen one's Anchored In God the other one's Anchored In Christ amen and we're caught between it with a great host of angels bringing forth ministering Spirits Supernatural gifts and things vindicating we're on our road marching up isn't that a wonderful thought brothers and sisters if we believe this message if we have been Justified if we have been Sanctified if we have been filled with the Holy Ghost then you're on that ladder and you've got angels all around you we know the word says that his angels are encamped about those who fear Him amen those who fear Him follow his word amen it's not about being afraid of God and knocking your knees together when you hear thunder cracking because maybe someone said somewhere along the way that that's the power of God that's the the voice of God we know that in the Bible it said sometime the the the Thunder roared and some people said it was an angel and some people said it was God and we know the story but you know we don't need to be afraid in terms of scared run and hide no no that's the unbeliever the believer looks right into the face of judgment because we're judging ourselves here that we would be worthy there he said that if you confess my name here on Earth then I'll confess your name before my father over there you know this uh this idea that there is a standard to raise in our lives it goes beyond just having something that we do in our lives even though we do we we we simply follow the word of God we don't actually try and do something to say that I'm I'm truly Justified Now by my actions see my action doesn't it show who I am doesn't it show how much I believe the word of God no no no all of those things they just follow just like the signs and the Wonders when when we follow the word of God we truly create an atmosphere and and he begins living out through us we we don't actually get ahead of the word we follow the word and all the signs and wonders follow us when we follow the word out of spiritual adoption in 1956 brother Bram says if he will reveal to you this morning by the revelation that this is the end of your suffering this is the end of your sickness all Devils out of Torment will never Shake That Foundation though every doctors say it's wrong for Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it though it would be against it yet it cannot Prevail for when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise a standard against it amen every time every single time brothers and sisters he says you see it you get it now Jesus being revealed to the disciples and it's interesting because we look at the the interpretation is a real important thing isn't it the the interpretation of the word the interpretation of Jesus we know that the disciples they were actually with Jesus one day and and he said to them you know who does the who who does the people the popular opinion what's the what's the word on the street who do they say that I am some said you know you're Elias or one of the prophets maybe jeremias and and we know that he said okay that's nice but who do you say that I am amen he brought it from the masses and brought it down to where we live and said who do you say that I am it's nice to know what everyone thinks out there but let's get specific about this who is it that you say that I am and we know that one of the disciples he stepped forward he stepped up and he spoke by Revelation in his life and he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and we know that Jesus being God in flesh he said Peter Simon bar Jonah flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven spoke directly to your heart and that that that word that was spoke to your heart it came to your mind and from your mind it traveled through all the neurons and it actually controlled your bodily functions and you spoke those words you actually put voice to the word that God put in your heart amen and we know the word of God says Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee that's not just saying that I went to Sunday school today and I got a good word and I just put it in there and now I'm good no no no no no it's about saying that I'm going to take every single word of God whether it takes my hide off me or not and I'm going to say Amen to that word of God Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee but we know that that Peter was taken talking about interpretation the church has said wow that's the guy that we're going to build the church on we're going to build the whole entire church the whole Catholic Church all of Christendom will be built upon Peter and his great Revelation that happened there and isn't it interesting that how the devil will do that he'll take truth and spin it but then we have the restoration Prophet come on the scene and tie up the Loose Ends and say how could God build a church on a human being that's so unstable that he would actually Curse God he would curse he would actually swear and and Deni Jesus Just Like Jesus told them how how could God build his Church of the Living God on a man so unstable that would behave that way he never did but what did he build a church on he built a Church on the Rock of Revelation amen that a man would be able to follow the word of God to the place of being justified to the place of being Sanctified to the place of actually being filled with the Holy Ghost where he can now hear from God and God could speak directly to that man but you know it gets crazy when we talk like that because now you're getting out into those heavenlies that we spoke about a little earlier and people can get all kinds of interpretations just like the Catholic church can but you know what the difference is the True Believers are going to be right back with the original word amen and if it doesn't line up with the word when someone says hey buddy what do you mean by that sister you said that but what about the word that says this we're going to all say forgive me because I'm wrong and that word is right I'm going to take that word above every single thought above every single Revelation that I get because we know the Devil comes around and he likes to speak to our hearts too and he'll use 99% truth the devil will come and speak word in our ear don't think for a second the devil won't do that he will but he'll pervert it he'll twist it just a little bit and get us to try and think that that's God but it's going to line up exact with the word of God and if it doesn't brother bradam taught us just leave it alone just leave it alone it's not up to us to go and persecute we're not going to go and persecute someone because we don't see things the same way what we're going to do as Believers matured Believers those those stocks of corn that have grown way over top of the division of the fences because we're mature what we're going to do is go and pray for that brother or that sister the spirit of God will raise a standard against it every time you see you get it now now Jesus being revealed to his disciples now look in the Garden of Eden when Cain brought an offering in worship we know the story of Cain and Abel the two sons not both of them of Eve but two sons look in the Garden of Eden of Adam I mean because they were both from Eve look in the Garden of Eden when Cain brought up brought an offering In Worship the same as Abel did he worshiped Cain worshiped sorry Cain worshiped he brought an offering in worship and the same as Abel did he worshiped he paid to the church he sacrificed he done every religious deed my I remember hearing this the first time and excuse me thinking that this is so different from the example that I thought about Cain being such a wicked person and being so evil that he would kill his brother having Blood Stained hands and and garments and Cane just being such a wicked individual that he would kill his brother no no no no no the prophet Paints the picture here God through the prophet Paints the picture here this guy was a religious guy he was really involved with the church he wasn't just some crazed Maniac out there in the world look at the Garden of Eden when Cain brought an offering and worship the same as Abel did he woried he paid to the church he sacrif sacrificed he done every religious deed brighter better more fitted than what Abel did he built a better altar he made it prettier he put glamour to his worship you see that strain still working among the sons of Adam he put glamour to it with the fruits of the field and the big Lily and he not only that but he worshiped can you imagine there is a way that seeth right unto a man but what he did he worshiped through knowledge brothers and sisters don't let us worship through knowledge we have to worship one way through spirit amen and Truth amen but that's only one way he worshiped through knowledge he worshiped not by Revelation and it's possible get it now so this is where we have to say this is either a man speaking or this is God speaking through a man and we can choose it's possible he says get it now listen you can worship through knowledge you can go to church by knowledge that you should do it but going to church church that way is worshiping in vain why did we come here this morning brothers and sisters did we come here to see our brothers and sisters did we come here just because it's what we do or did we come here because we wanted to worship almighty God and this is where we go back maybe a couple of weeks to the last time we talked about this the high priest in the days of Temple worship when he would go in behind the inner Veil once a year if he didn't do it correctly to bring glory to God he died it meant death now for us today to not go behind that inner Veil means death it's the same thing for us we have been called all of the the Flaming cherubims that were put at the Garden of Eden I just can't help but think about this brothers and sisters and if you'll just imagine with me for a second we know that when Adam and Eve were sent out of the garden for disobeying God for the ACT that they did for the children they brought forth when they were sent out of the Garden of Eden God he made the first animal sacrifice right there and what did he do he cut the skins of the animals he said that fig leaves religion is not enough the only thing that's going to cover your sin until I come myself and make a way is going to be the blood of bulls and goats so he cut skins off of animals and clothed them with those and sent them out of the garden and brother bradam talked about how when they walked out of the garden in shame those skin slapped against their thighs and their calves and the blood of the animal was slapping against Their Skin showing that there was something covering them not religion and you know when that happened what's the next part there was flaming cherubims sword that went always way around the tree of life that's the story right in Genesis there was a flaming sword that went around every single way top and bottom front back everywhere around that tree of life was guarded you were no longer allowed to do it you could not go and get close to that tree of life partake of it but you know in the day that we're living in we've gone through the restor the Reformation we've gone through the restoration the tying up of all the Loose Ends and we know that the prophet in our day he had a sword placed in his hand I can't help but think what sword was that brothers and sisters we know the word of God said that it was the king's sword I just had this thought while we're preaching here maybe just maybe it was one of those swords that was guarding the tree of life now he had the ability to cut his way back to the Tree of Life to have full access to the tree of life there's no reason no excuse to not go all the way in behind the inner Veil and we find the prophet going through all of that we know that he said that all Adam lost had been restored what did Adam lose access to the tree of life not just living a beautiful life in the Garden of Eden where he could say thou tree over here I don't like you there be planted over here oh my the wind is a little bit a little bit hot we need to cool the temperature just a little bit or maybe we need a little more mist or maybe we need a little more fruit it's not that it's the restoration of the word the restoration of the access back to Christ that tree in the garden brother Bram he says this here and it's possible get it now listen you can worship through knowledge you can go to church by knowledge that you should do it but going to church that way is worshiping in vain but when there's something happens down in your heart that makes you love God and that would be my desire brothers and sisters maybe you might be saying I just can't wait for the next 11 minutes to happen so that brother Barry would just shut up and stop harping on this word you know what it's only going to be that that many more minutes and then I'll stop but you know brothers and sisters my desire for us today is that we wouldn't just be going to church just because it's a a a a Duty or a religion that we do it's worshiping in vain if we do that but I I just pray that there would be something that would happen down in our heart that would make us love God that we would fall in love with God and recognize that he died for me it wasn't for someone else somewhere out there it was just for me he says in such a way that you can't stay from church that's the revelation God revealing we know that David said my heart was glad oh my when they said to us let's go down to the house of the Lord oh my isn't there something that happens in the heart of a Believer when we know that there's a service when we can go to church when we know that we're going to go and worship God not in vain because we've had a full restoration of the word it's no longer a partial truth he says they had no Bible then they didn't even have paper or slate to work with they had no schools of education and here we are we have 12200 messages from a Vindicated Prophet at our fingertips on our phone churches that we can go and worship in but you know you find some people they would just say no I don't I don't have to go to church the prophet of God said yes yeah go to church even if you can't get a full serving of food if you can't get a full meal go to church amen somewhere along the way that was changed though and I'll just say it this way it's by the erosion of the devil he gets in and just erodes it he takes truth and twist it but we have the ability brothers and sisters When We Gather here in this building to worship almighty God we have the ability to go in behind the inner Veil that's what we're doing here that's what this is all about when we get here it's not about about coming and and trying to be a part of something and and seeing whether we can test the waters on whether there's an anointing or not the anointing is right here we bring the anointing with us it's not sitting in this building waiting for us there's many churches that treat that that teach that way that's not the way it is in our day we bring Christ with us but when we all bring our licks of fire that Pillar of Fire our sacred portions together what happens we have one Pillar of Fire in our midst which is the Lord Jesus Christ and you know if we can come to that place where we recognize what we're doing here this ain't about church this ain't about church politics this is not about us just pretending and coming to church it's not just about in a religion where we just cover ourselves with fig leaves and say I believe the message of the hour if that's all it is then we just have a religion that's just a fig Leaf we've got to go beyond that we got to go beyond the animal skins we've got to go beyond realizing that Christ even died for us in Calvary we got to go to the place where we recognize that he's living out through us now where it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the reason the prophet spoke the way he did paragraph 111 he said they had no Bible then they didn't even have paper or slate to work with they had no schools of education so Abel by Revelation it was revealed to him by God that it was not Beauty neither was it the fruits of the field or apples that had drove them from the garden of Eden but it was blood it was blood that did it and it was revealed to him and he went and got a lamb by Revelation he foresaw the coming of the just lamb and it was revealed to him so we got a lamb and by a revelation offered it to God and it was accepted the whole church is built upon spiritual Revelation how beautiful and I I'll just throw this in there today it's built on spiritual Revelation no longer about the re the reformers even though we study and and try and learn it's no longer about the restoration it's all about who we are as Sons and Daughters of the most high God are we Justified are we Sanctified and are we stuck in either one of those positions because if we are there's more we can go on to the true filling of the Holy Ghost in our lives and you know anything else is false any other Doctrine is false any other Doctrine is going to put us into the mark of the beast any other Doctrine is going to put us in a place where we're going to say didn't wasn't wasn't Elias supposed to first come even Snoopy actually knew that remember that little cartoon if anybody doesn't know I I can actually send it to you but Charles Schultz the creator of Snoopy the cartoon he actually put that in there in one of the cartoons wasn't Elias supposed to first come there's going to be people that say well I thought that this was was supposed to happen and I thought that was supposed to happen before the Rapture of the Church of the Living God and you know what the church is already going to be gone the the Rapture will already have happened this is about knowing who we are brothers and sisters and to come to the place of recognition that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that he is alive and and the same in our lives and recognizing that when we come to this building here in here this building is not just a church building this is the sanctuary when we gather together in his name what does the word of God say where two or three are gathered in his name that he's there in their midst so how ought we to behave while he is there in their midst am should we be clipping our fingernails thinking I sure wish brother Barry would just be done man I I just got so many different things I want to do today is it is it is it just maybe an inconvenience for us to come to church and yeah I could go on and on and I I don't mean to make us feel uncomfortable brothers and sisters I just want to try and encourage us to recognize what is it we're doing when we come here we're coming to meet with God Almighty the Lord Jesus Christ amen and you know as our brother prayed earlier today one of these days this will be the very last meeting and will we think that maybe I had a little bit more amen or a little bit more worship to give God and I held it back because I was tired or I held it back because of of of of of of brothers and sisters don't don't hold back when you come here give him all you got if you want to see God move in your life give him all you got and see if he won't bless you I'll call the musicians as we pull one more quote here in 1964 the Harvest Time and I can't help but think that's exactly where we are brothers and sisters the Harvest time we know the prophet of God said in the message the invisible Union of the Bride right at the very end he said I hear the combine coming the combine's coming and we know that when the combine comes there's grains that it cuts and it sorts and it sifts the grain from all the shaft spits out the shaft and takes the Grain and puts it into the Garner the prophet in his day he said I hear the coming of the combine the Harvest Time here in 1964 he says but he is going to judge the world and he has got to have some standard to judge the World by or he would be unjust to let us go now and live this life without a standard to be judged by such a beautiful thought who would be right where could you tell us was right there has to be a standard and there has to be a standard brothers and sisters there's many different examples I could come up with and for time's sake I'm not going to bore you with it today maybe stand with me as we close as we read the rest of this there has to be a standard and he said in his Bible that he would judge the World by Jesus Christ and we read here that Jesus is the word in Hebrews 138 he said he is the same yesterday today and forever I want to say this so don't go taking Jesus and putting him out there as God don't take God and put him out there as some Dody old grandpa that's somewhere floating around on a cloud and maybe some sometimes once in a while he might hear your prayer if you pray just right or if you act just right or if you do just right no that's not who we're talking about he's the same yesterday today and forever so therefore he will judge the church by their attitude towards Christ who is the word I think that's just powerful he will judge the church by their attitude towards Christ who is the word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God not out of the mouth of man not out of the mouth of a seminary not out of the church but out of the mouth of God man must live by that and that alone not man's interpretation but God's Own word amen I want to say brothers and sisters what is that standard that he's raising up some might say well he raised up a prophet in our day and maybe he's raised up Bishops and archbishops and Elders there's a few generals I would say in this message of the hour that are in their 80s that have pressed this battle for 50 plus years Believers of this word all the Winds of Doctrine have come and gone and they have not rattled they have not shaken they are humans but they still stand upon on the word of God but who is the standard there has to be a standard today some might say it's the church my church I'd like to say it was our church but I I know for sure what I'm trying to get across is it's not that it's you you are the standard that he has raised up in this age we are the standard that he has raised up in this age you know out of 1 Thessalonians 5:22 it says abstain from all appearance of evil that doesn't leave a whole lot of room for interpretation of how close we can flirt with this world verse 23 says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy remember the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against the enemy that it's the spirit of God who will sanctify you holy the very God of Peace will sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it God bless you today let's just bow Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for the standard that you have given us Lord knowing that there is a full restoration of your word Lord there's so many things that we could talk about but we know that there's one thing father that will unlock the entirety of the message to us in the day in which we live and that is to truly receive you on the basis that you have given yourself and that is through the true baptism of your Holy Spirit Lord father today I just feel just as impressed as I have in the past Lord father to ask Lord to intercede for anyone Lord who doesn't know you in the power of your Resurrection father to the degree that we can know you father that you are the same yesterday today and forever father if anybody here has the desire for you as the holy spirit in their

Jesus that they would allow your mind to be in them Lord Jesus that they would lay aside all of their humanity and say be it unto me according to Thy word just like Mary did and father we know that you will come on the scene that you father will overshadow them with the power of the highest Lord and that your spirit will begin to live father there will be a little kick in the womb Lord and we'll feel that life jump inside of us Lord Jesus and we'll know that we'll never be the same again every time we hear something in your word there will just be an amen to it father Lord if there's anybody here that needs more of you father I pray that you would Grant it to them Lord father if our experience has grown cold Lord Jesus forgive us for it Lord help us push aside all of the things the thoughts and the ideas that have allowed us Lord to grow cold in our lives and father renew in US Lord Jesus your spirit father I pray that you would just grant unto us Lord that that opportunity father to be pleasing unto you father with a Heart Lord father we love you and we thank you we just want to commit each life into your hands now For Your Glory as we go our separate ways father if it Be Your Will for us to gather again on Wednesday Lord we'll be careful to give you all the praise Lord we won't Reserve any for you Lord when we come on Wednesday father we'll bring our best once again and we'll give it all to you father we love you and we thank you Father we just commit each life into your hands now as we go our separate ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless
