[0:01] foreign
[0:02] someone that would just be so
[0:05] encouraging
[0:06] instead of the opposite
[0:08] and that's my heart today brothers and
[0:10] sisters is to encourage
[0:12] let's go further
[0:15] let's try a little harder let's let's
[0:16] see what the Lord has in store for us
[0:20] because I don't think that he wants us
[0:21] to just be the same
[0:24] he wants us to grow
[0:26] not in numbers but in him in our lives
[0:30] he wants us to see the fullness of the
[0:33] Lord manifest in our lives
[0:35] he goes on to say here the church should
[0:37] be open early and the Believers come
[0:39] together on these nights and at least 45
[0:42] minutes to an hour before the services
[0:43] begin
[0:45] and you know I'm I'm basically just
[0:47] going to cut it off there I'll call the
[0:48] musicians I'm gonna I'm gonna pick up
[0:50] this thought again
[0:52] um
[0:53] just about coming to church early for
[0:55] the purpose of being able to discover
[0:56] these gifts and see these gifts manifest
[0:59] in in our midst
[1:01] an hour before the service begins
[1:05] maybe stand with me if you will tonight
[1:08] he says the church should be open early
[1:09] and the Believers come together on these
[1:11] nights at least 45 minutes to an hour
[1:13] before the services begin
[1:16] we we start service a half hour early
[1:18] for the purpose brothers and sisters of
[1:20] setting that atmosphere cleaning out all
[1:22] the things in our lives putting aside
[1:23] all the cares of this world not having
[1:25] anything hindering his Spirit from
[1:27] moving in our lives
[1:31] and you know
[1:35] I don't know if if what James said
[1:39] in James 2 verse 17 even so faith
[1:43] if it hath not works is dead being alone
[1:47] yay a man may say thou Hast faith and I
[1:51] have works
[1:53] show me thy faith without thy works
[1:57] and I will show thee my faith by my
[2:00] works
[2:01] [Music]
[2:02] there comes a point in time brothers and
[2:04] sisters that I'm getting at
[2:06] that that we begin to apply the full
[2:08] word in our lives
[2:10] and
[2:13] you know how it goes
[2:15] I mean you've heard it said before God
[2:17] deals with whoever's speaking it first
[2:19] before they speak it
[2:21] I'm talking about myself
[2:24] I'm just so thankful that he's
[2:25] long-suffering and kind and patient
[2:30] and just knows his children and and
[2:33] doesn't kick them when they're trying to
[2:35] learn how to walk and us as adults grown
[2:39] adults many times we have things in our
[2:41] lives that we just don't seem to be able
[2:43] to get over and seem to overcome and we
[2:45] just seem to continually do the same
[2:47] thing over and over again I'm here to
[2:49] say take courage brothers and sisters
[2:51] don't feel judged and condemned because
[2:54] that's not what this is about this is
[2:56] about exhorting one another even more so
[2:58] as we see that day approaching getting
[3:00] encouraged by the word and believing
[3:02] that one day even though we struggle and
[3:04] struggle and struggle and struggle and
[3:05] seem like we'll never be able to get
[3:07] past ourselves one day we will brothers
[3:09] and sisters one day we will God Will
[3:11] Make A Way for us if we just give him
[3:13] the opportunity don't give up keep
[3:15] pressing on that's that word that
[3:17] brother Bradham heard when he was coming
[3:18] back to his body from Beyond the curtain
[3:20] of time just keep pressing on just keep
[3:22] pressing on that day is so much closer
[3:25] than it ever has been before
[3:27] we're heading that way brothers and
[3:29] sisters
[3:30] don't fall for the scarecrows don't
[3:33] don't get caught up in all the isms in
[3:36] this world don't get caught up at one
[3:37] another and the things let's just put it
[3:40] all aside and just allow Christ to move
[3:43] in our lives allow them to reign in our
[3:45] lives and just see what happens when
[3:47] that Divine love just just goes and and
[3:50] emulates from one another and and you
[3:53] know what brother Branham says when our
[3:55] carnal flesh says to do one thing he
[3:57] says do the opposite and see what
[3:59] happens
[4:01] see what happens
[4:02] if I've stepped on your toes I apologize
[4:05] just do the opposite of what your flesh
[4:07] feels according to what the prophet said
[4:10] and just see what happens and and God
[4:13] will bless you I know he will
[4:16] let's just go to him in prayer
[4:18] gracious Lord Jesus
[4:20] just so thankful tonight Lord
[4:23] for
[4:24] a perfect word Lord
[4:26] that you would send us a prophet that
[4:28] would just reveal these truths to us
[4:30] Lord that we could understand
[4:32] a little bit more about Who We Are
[4:34] a little bit more about our purpose and
[4:36] and why we're here and maybe why we do
[4:39] the things that we do
[4:40] Lord I pray that we could just go
[4:43] forward together as a church and just
[4:45] understand that we are are built on the
[4:48] same Foundation that Paul preached
[4:49] that's the the word that that William
[4:52] Mary and Branham preached and and that's
[4:54] the word that we believe and and we just
[4:57] are so thankful that you've given us
[4:59] years to hear and eyes to see what the
[5:01] spirit said to the church in our day
[5:04] we can look back and see all of the
[5:06] other ages and think about the heroes in
[5:08] those days and and think about all the
[5:10] wondrous Mighty works that you've done
[5:12] the signs and wonders in their lives but
[5:15] father what good is it uh what if it
[5:18] can't be for me what what good is it if
[5:21] we can't see it in our own lives we need
[5:23] to see your life in ours and Lord
[5:26] tonight I believe that you were just
[5:28] speaking to us about just just giving
[5:31] you the channel to move in in our lives
[5:34] giving you the ability to move in our
[5:36] church giving you the ability to just
[5:40] see the Lord Jesus Christ when we look
[5:43] at one another that it just it just
[5:45] pains us to be apart from one another as
[5:47] we go our separate ways
[5:49] but father we know that we're not far
[5:52] away we can pick up a phone we can zoom
[5:55] call

[7:53] if we could just have such a god
[7:55] Consciousness every moment of every
[7:57] single day that every thought that we

[34:14] 10.

[34:19] over in Malachi chapter 3.
[34:22] verse 16 to 18 and I'll definitely go
[34:26] slow so we can all turn there
[34:29] what a wonderful day today it was right
[34:31] from the beginning watching the sun rise

[34:42] purpose being fulfilled
[34:44] my goodness what an honor and a
[34:47] privilege it is to be here at the End of
[34:49] Time representing the Lord
[34:53] over in Hebrews I guess I should turn
[34:55] there too
[34:57] and stop talking
[34:59] Hebrews
[35:01] chapter 10 verse 23.
[35:05] let us hold fast the profession of our
[35:07] faith without wavering
[35:10] for he is faithful that promised
[35:13] and let us consider one another to
[35:15] provoke unto love and to Good Works
[35:19] not forsaking the assembling of
[35:21] ourselves together as the manner of some
[35:23] is
[35:24] but exhorting one another
[35:27] and so much more
[35:30] as you see the day approaching
[35:33] let's turn over to the Book of Malachi
[35:37] Malachi chapter 3
[35:41] verse 16.
[35:47] Malachi 3
[35:49] verse 16.
[35:53] and this year
[35:54] is speaking about you
[35:56] speaking about me
[35:58] speaking about us
[36:00] then they that feared the Lord
[36:03] spake often one to another
[36:06] and the Lord hearkened and heard it
[36:09] and a book of remembrance was written
[36:12] before him
[36:13] for them that feared the Lord
[36:16] and that thought upon his name
[36:19] and they shall be mine saith the Lord of
[36:22] hosts in that day when I make up my
[36:25] jewels
[36:26] and I will spare them as a man's Spirit
[36:28] his own son that serveth him
[36:33] then shall ye return and discern between
[36:37] the righteous and the wicked
[36:39] between him that serveth God and him
[36:42] that serveth him not
[36:45] let's just bow one more time
[36:48] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[36:50] your word
[36:52] and we thank you for the Revelation that
[36:54] you give us about your word Lord
[36:56] we know that you have
[36:59] a very specific meaning for your word
[37:02] for a very specific people in a very
[37:05] specific age
[37:07] and Lord Jesus we know that all creation
[37:09] is groaning for the manifestations
[37:12] of your children
[37:14] of the sons of God and Father we stand
[37:17] here tonight
[37:18] believing your word
[37:20] believing your message that you sent
[37:22] through your prophet
[37:26] and Lord Jesus we are your
[37:28] representation here today
[37:30] father we pray that you would just bless
[37:31] this word tonight
[37:33] bless the feeble words that come out of
[37:35] my lips Lord let them not be my words
[37:37] but let them be yours father we pray
[37:40] that I could just get out of the way I
[37:41] have nothing to bring on my own but oh
[37:44] Lord when you come when you come by oh
[37:48] Father you make all the difference
[37:50] and we know that you always come where
[37:52] you are invited so tonight we just
[37:54] invite you
[37:55] to take your preeminence because we know
[37:57] you're already here father let me just
[38:00] step down from the pulpit now and just
[38:02] give you my flesh my Badger skin Lord
[38:04] just come and take control now we pray
[38:07] in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:09] we ask it amen
[38:12] God bless you you may have your seats
[38:14] tonight
[38:17] if I had to go by feeling I would have
[38:19] to say that I am
[38:24] I don't know why extremely nervous
[38:27] apprehensive I guess the Lord's doing
[38:31] something here I just want to welcome
[38:33] everyone tonight it's so wonderful to
[38:35] see your faces
[38:36] when we haven't seen one another for so
[38:38] long
[38:41] we have a few announcements I'd like to
[38:43] get into we
[38:45] have a Minister's meeting tomorrow night
[38:47] at 7 30. it's going to be a zoom meeting
[38:49] and we're just going to go over a few
[38:50] things that we're doing in Lethbridge
[38:51] and
[38:53] so on
[38:54] we have the musicians practice on Sunday
[38:56] at 2PM
[38:58] but one thing we would like to do if
[39:00] possible is invited first have the folks
[39:04] who are involved with the sound and the
[39:07] video
[39:09] our our media system if we could
[39:11] actually just press pause with the
[39:13] musicians and maybe not have so much of
[39:15] a musician's practice as a try and
[39:19] streamline everyone on on the new system
[39:22] that we're operating so that we can
[39:24] hopefully make it just a little better
[39:26] for those people who are streaming for
[39:28] the recording for every single aspect of
[39:31] it that way because it's such an
[39:34] important part of our service now I I
[39:36] believe that we really need to try and
[39:38] focus on on that and encouraging
[39:40] everyone to just get on the same page
[39:42] and you know we we talked about it
[39:44] before service brother Phil and I and
[39:46] and his words were basically like this
[39:49] we need to iron out the wrinkles first
[39:51] and then we can actually create a game
[39:53] plan and get everyone reading from the
[39:56] same page and right now we're still
[39:58] trying to iron out the wrinkles and work
[40:00] out the bugs and get the feedback from
[40:02] everyone so our our skin is thick
[40:05] were not insulted by someone saying
[40:07] something isn't working we're actually
[40:09] encouraging it so that we can help help
[40:11] make it better if we don't identify the
[40:13] problems we can't fix them so please
[40:16] don't don't be shy
[40:17] be kind
[40:19] but don't be shy and and just let us
[40:21] know you know it's working well just
[40:23] send a WhatsApp text and uh and we'll
[40:25] work on it we'll try and get it together
[40:27] so all that to say if we could just sort
[40:29] of Step Back From the musician the
[40:31] Musical part of it and just invite
[40:33] everyone who is involved with sound even
[40:35] if it's the peripherals if you're just
[40:37] doing the the loading of the song book
[40:39] or or whatever it is we certainly would
[40:42] like to see all of those folks come and
[40:44] you know there's probably potential for
[40:46] room for a couple other people who maybe
[40:48] want to play or or have another issue
[40:50] that you want to work on if you do in
[40:52] terms of music by all means just sign up
[40:54] but this one is going to be more focused
[40:56] on on the media portion of things
[40:59] Sunday at two o'clock
[41:01] on the 14th brother Mervin is going to
[41:04] be in Lethbridge pray for our brother
[41:07] young peoples we have on the 19th at 7
[41:10] pm it will be a virtual meeting
[41:13] on the 21st we have a communion service
[41:17] I I only thing I can say is I apologize
[41:20] it's the first communion service in who
[41:22] knows how long a year
[41:24] or so
[41:26] I
[41:28] I don't know maybe I should have thought
[41:30] it out better and I don't know here we
[41:32] are we've got it figured out
[41:34] we're going to have the deacons here
[41:37] we're going to have all the the
[41:39] musicians that we need to have for this
[41:41] the service maybe just a Pianist and and
[41:43] the the sound guy and we're going to
[41:46] have everybody cue in the parking lot in
[41:48] your cars and stream from your mobile
[41:50] device
[41:51] and if you don't want to stream that's
[41:53] fine but if you want to take a part in
[41:55] in that service just come and and park
[41:58] in the parking lot come and queue in the
[41:59] parking lot with you and your family
[42:01] whoever and the deacons will come and
[42:03] get you we're going to be just bringing
[42:05] people through as we can do it to keep
[42:08] the the maximum amount of people of 12
[42:10] people in the sanctuary it's a terrible
[42:13] thing I I I don't like it not one bit I
[42:17] can't wait for the day where we can just
[42:19] get back to a communion foot Washing
[42:21] Service where at the end of it we can
[42:23] just water all of the praise all of the
[42:26] the blessing with the songs on the
[42:28] hearts of the Believers and just leave
[42:29] here feeling completely washed out like
[42:31] we always used to but we'll trust we'll
[42:34] we'll just take what we can for now
[42:37] and uh so we'll have the people come in
[42:39] with the deacons we'll have them come up
[42:41] on this side the piano side of the
[42:44] sanctuary they will take the bread
[42:46] they'll be handed the bread they'll
[42:48] actually be handed a cup of wine and
[42:51] they can actually walk over and deposit
[42:52] their empty cup in the waste basket and
[42:55] exit through this door here
[42:57] so we'll have them come in from
[42:59] downstairs at the at the front of the
[43:00] church and then come out here and go out
[43:03] it's probably going to be a fairly uh
[43:06] straightforward service I don't know how
[43:07] much we'll
[43:08] have for a service we'll just try it
[43:11] we're just going to try it so I probably
[43:14] won't try and preach a lot but we'll
[43:16] just we'll just try and make it happen
[43:18] that's all I can say the 21st 6 p.m
[43:21] we've got a communion service if you
[43:23] want to partake cue in the parking lot
[43:27] on the 28th brother Toby has graciously
[43:30] accepted taking the service here
[43:32] in Calgary
[43:34] so that I can go down to Lethbridge and
[43:36] take my first service down there I
[43:38] haven't preached in Lethbridge yet we
[43:41] were there for the first service in the
[43:43] hotel
[43:44] and that was a really good time and I
[43:46] believe brother Toby preached there it
[43:48] was a wonderful service and uh anyways I
[43:52] don't know how how many services have we
[43:53] had there there's been quite a few and I
[43:55] haven't been there to preach one
[43:57] all the brothers with the burden on
[43:59] their heart have just put their shoulder
[44:00] to the wheel to make it happen so I'm
[44:03] going to go and put my shoulder to the
[44:04] wheel
[44:05] and see what the Lord will do
[44:08] um
[44:09] certainly thankful for the streaming
[44:11] services
[44:12] we've definitely been working out some
[44:14] stuff here and uh for those people maybe
[44:17] who who aren't aware one of the things
[44:20] that we we were contending with was a
[44:22] fluctuation and Power in the building
[44:24] and
[44:25] it was wreaking havoc I think on our
[44:27] equipment
[44:28] computers were doing strange things they
[44:31] would crash at strange times and I think
[44:35] we found the main source of that problem
[44:37] and it has been fixed
[44:39] so praise the Lord he showed us the
[44:42] problem and gave us a really easy fix
[44:44] for it so Lord willing with the
[44:46] stability of the power things can only
[44:48] get better
[44:49] [Laughter]
[44:51] tonight I want to carry on with uh
[44:54] Church order and just sort of talk about
[44:57] what we've been talking about in terms
[44:59] of church order and I trust that we can
[45:01] get out of here soon but uh you know
[45:03] there's just a few things that I think
[45:04] the Lord wants us to talk about just
[45:06] just make sure that we got in order
[45:09] we've got it nailed down and that's
[45:10] really the direction that's our
[45:12] trajectory you know we've talked about
[45:13] it and uh the profit in our day has
[45:16] given a real clear direction for what
[45:18] the church should be doing to operate
[45:20] and and see the blessing of God to see
[45:23] the apostolic blessing that's really
[45:25] what we want in our lives
[45:28] um I've got a few quotes tonight I'm
[45:29] just gonna read them and preach them and
[45:32] we'll see what happened tonight
[45:34] brother Branham says uh just I just
[45:37] wanted to preface it with this year
[45:38] brother Brad I'm talking about gifts in
[45:40] the church it's it's a quote
[45:42] um out of cod in 1954.
[45:45] closest thing
[45:47] to an Evidence of a Christian
[45:50] and again some people might say well
[45:52] this is pre-seals and uh
[45:55] you know what's
[45:57] the prophet
[46:00] he said now I'm going to I'll give you
[46:02] my estimation of what I think that the
[46:05] closest thing to an evidence that a man
[46:07] is a Christian then anything I know of
[46:11] he says you know what it is it's travail
[46:14] of soul
[46:15] a person that's always so hungering and
[46:18] thirsting for God
[46:20] they just simply day and night
[46:22] they just can't stand it
[46:24] they just got to do something for God
[46:28] have you ever felt a calling in your
[46:29] life
[46:30] this speaks exactly to someone who has
[46:34] that burden to go preach the gospel
[46:36] maybe to sing a special
[46:39] maybe to just go and be in fellowship
[46:42] with other believers they just can't
[46:44] stand being away from our brothers and
[46:46] our sisters
[46:48] there's just something there they just
[46:50] simply day and night they can't stand it
[46:53] they got to do something for God
[46:56] they're full of love and they're just
[46:58] Soul travail they're just travailing all
[47:00] the time the Bible said he that goeth
[47:02] forth sowing in tears will doubtless
[47:04] return again rejoicing bringing with him
[47:07] precious sheaves
[47:09] is that right all those things
[47:13] now look if there's if this church if
[47:16] I'd say this morning in this little
[47:18] group of people and I God say now look
[47:21] William Bradham I'm going to make you
[47:22] answer for that group of people
[47:24] what you tell them
[47:30] now do you want them all to shout
[47:32] sure I want them to shout
[47:36] do you want them all to speak with
[47:37] tongues
[47:38] I want every one of them to
[47:41] do you want them all to dance in the
[47:42] spirit I want every one of them to
[47:46] all right well that's very good
[47:49] but what would you rather have them do
[47:51] uh-huh
[47:53] he says this I'd rather have a church
[47:56] that had such a burden on their heart
[47:59] for prayer
[48:00] that they just stayed at this altar and
[48:03] would be here day and night
[48:05] and everything else
[48:07] I love how he says this because it could
[48:09] easily be taken and spun into we need to
[48:11] have all night prayer meetings that's
[48:12] going to do it for us we need to go back
[48:14] to Pentecost and and get Pentecostal and
[48:17] that's going to do it for us we need to
[48:19] have an altar call at the end of every
[48:20] single service and that's going to do it
[48:22] for us no
[48:23] we have to take what the prophet says in
[48:25] context and that's why I went way back
[48:27] now we're getting into what I wanted to
[48:29] say I wanted to make sure we get the
[48:30] context of what he's meaning
[48:33] a church had such a burden in their
[48:35] heart for prayers that they just stayed
[48:36] at this Altar and would be here day and
[48:38] night and everything else and in their
[48:40] house
[48:41] was constantly in prayer
[48:44] and humble
[48:46] and trying to get people
[48:48] to come to God
[48:50] and making calls at the hospital
[48:53] we can't do that now sadly
[48:56] but making calls at the hospital
[48:59] and visiting the sick and trying to get
[49:01] people to come to church and do right
[49:04] I'd rather have that than all the other
[49:07] put together
[49:09] although the other is right it belongs
[49:11] in the church but if I have to have
[49:13] to have it I'd put that first because if
[49:16] you've got that the other will take
[49:19] place
[49:20] so brothers and sisters I just want to
[49:21] make sure what we preach here in this
[49:23] church is the message of the hour
[49:25] according to what William Branham taught
[49:29] the seventh angel messenger that's what
[49:30] we preach here and and and that's all
[49:33] we're not preaching another doctor and
[49:35] we're not interested in getting into
[49:36] Pentecost and I think that maybe because
[49:39] some people know that I grew up in
[49:40] Pentecost I don't know maybe I'm just
[49:42] going on a rant here but I just want to
[49:44] make sure that you hear my heart's
[49:45] desire you understand really my
[49:47] perspective here I'm not trying to slant
[49:49] this from a Pentecostal perspective we
[49:51] heard what the prophet said we have to
[49:53] have the right motive and objective to
[49:55] to accomplish God's purpose but when we
[49:58] do have that right motive and objective

[1:03:33] that the people who are gifted by the
[1:03:36] Spirit come and worship with us now in
[1:03:39] most places we find that when these
[1:03:40] gifts in the people
[1:03:43] the people does not understand
[1:03:45] how and when to use these gifts
[1:03:49] and in doing so
[1:03:52] they only bring a reproach
[1:03:54] this is kind of what I wanted to get to
[1:03:56] tonight here we are just about quarter
[1:03:58] two
[1:03:58] [Music]
[1:03:59] um
[1:04:00] hope that we're getting somewhere I know
[1:04:03] it's important to go back and just
[1:04:04] refresh and and it's been so long since
[1:04:06] we've talked about this and I'll try to
[1:04:08] stop babbling and get into it here and
[1:04:10] and in doing so they only bring a
[1:04:12] reproach just because they don't
[1:04:13] understand how to operate these gifts
[1:04:14] and brother Branham gives us a very
[1:04:16] clear operation understanding it he says
[1:04:19] which we believe would just would be
[1:04:21] just what Satan could do
[1:04:24] to make The Outsiders the unbelievers
[1:04:26] and so forth afraid of this wonderful
[1:04:28] blessing that God has given to the
[1:04:30] church in these days and and what he's
[1:04:32] talking about right there brothers and
[1:04:33] sisters we could say I'll word it this
[1:04:35] way I'll just read it again
[1:04:37] in doing so they only bring a reproach
[1:04:39] which we believe would be just what
[1:04:42] Satan could do
[1:04:44] to make The Outsiders the unbelievers
[1:04:47] and so forth afraid of this wonderful
[1:04:49] message
[1:04:51] that God has given to the church in
[1:04:53] these last days
[1:04:55] when people don't understand how it's
[1:04:57] supposed to be and and don't understand
[1:04:59] what's supposed to take place and what
[1:05:01] it's supposed to be like it causes
[1:05:03] confusion and when that happens people
[1:05:05] get scared it's a scarecrow and they
[1:05:07] just don't want to go any further it
[1:05:09] just becomes I'm only going to stay here
[1:05:11] remember we talked about Joshua and the
[1:05:13] children of Israel coming out of Egypt
[1:05:16] and going into the promised land and
[1:05:19] there was a time where the people had to
[1:05:22] say nobody has gone there before
[1:05:25] but God has called us and he's shown us
[1:05:28] many signs and wonders and he's told us
[1:05:30] watch the Levites because when they go
[1:05:33] across give them the proper space follow
[1:05:35] them
[1:05:36] make sure that you understand you know
[1:05:39] we're coming to that place too brothers
[1:05:40] and sisters nobody else has gone this
[1:05:42] far brother Branham I would say this and
[1:05:45] forgive me for saying it if if maybe it
[1:05:47] sounds contentious brother Branham isn't
[1:05:50] gone as far as we are going to go
[1:05:55] and the reason I say that is because he
[1:05:57] actually went by the way of the Grave
[1:05:59] brothers and sisters we're not talking
[1:06:01] about going greater than the office he
[1:06:03] had the highest Office of the age period
[1:06:07] I mean the Holy Ghost above him but
[1:06:08] right we know that the the prophet for
[1:06:11] the age a major prophet was the highest
[1:06:13] office and nobody will will go beyond
[1:06:15] that and there isn't going to be another
[1:06:16] one
[1:06:18] but brothers and sisters we have a
[1:06:20] higher calling for those people who
[1:06:22] don't go by the way of the grave
[1:06:26] don't be afraid of it
[1:06:28] don't worry
[1:06:29] remember we read earlier that the word
[1:06:31] will always straighten it out
[1:06:33] if we have confusion the word will
[1:06:35] always straighten it out but what I want
[1:06:37] to get to tonight is what's the word for
[1:06:38] our day what's the word for us we have
[1:06:40] the Bible many ages have many people
[1:06:42] have the Bible but if they don't have
[1:06:44] the message of the hour they don't have
[1:06:45] the whole Bible I would say that now
[1:06:48] that sounds crazy that's her heretic for
[1:06:50] many people but it's true
[1:06:53] they didn't even understand water
[1:06:55] baptism they don't understand what
[1:06:57] happened in the Garden of Eden I I mean
[1:06:59] we could those are only two things how
[1:07:02] many things are there the mystery of God
[1:07:05] there's so many things that brother
[1:07:07] Branham straightened out according to
[1:07:09] scripture not just his opinion
[1:07:11] we don't want to get into that tonight
[1:07:13] we want to make sure that we're seeing
[1:07:15] that blessing that God has given to the
[1:07:16] church in these days
[1:07:19] people they they don't understand that
[1:07:22] according to the word for our day
[1:07:24] the message of the hour the importance
[1:07:26] of it I'm just going to use two examples
[1:07:28] and I'll try and make it quick here as
[1:07:30] we wrap up
[1:07:31] because I don't want to keep everyone
[1:07:32] late tonight people
[1:07:34] just don't really understand that the
[1:07:37] message of the hours according to the
[1:07:39] word entirely
[1:07:40] and you know that is the word for our
[1:07:43] day the message of the hour
[1:07:46] and we we've talked about it many times
[1:07:48] I'm just going to do it again Noah
[1:07:50] just going to say it in a different way
[1:07:52] though he had a word for his day
[1:07:54] and and how was it that he had a word
[1:07:56] for his day many of us all of us would
[1:07:58] say Amen to that
[1:08:00] right no one had a word for his day
[1:08:03] but that word that came to Noah it came
[1:08:05] to Noah
[1:08:07] it didn't come to his family
[1:08:08] he didn't come to his church
[1:08:10] it didn't come through his denomination
[1:08:12] and then handed down to Noah it was God
[1:08:15] speaking specifically to Noah
[1:08:18] and giving Noah a revelation about what
[1:08:20] he needed to do and what did Noah do
[1:08:22] Noah went and preached it Noah gave it
[1:08:25] out
[1:08:26] Noah took it in and gave it out
[1:08:29] and what was that word that he gave to
[1:08:31] the people it was at the end of All
[1:08:32] Flesh has come before me
[1:08:34] it's happening
[1:08:36] the Earth is filled with violence and I
[1:08:39] will destroy them all
[1:08:43] go on Noah build an ark here's the
[1:08:45] instructions for it
[1:08:46] and to think that the wrath of God was
[1:08:48] stayed
[1:08:49] until Noah had his family inside the
[1:08:52] boat
[1:08:54] and once he was in the boat
[1:08:56] then God shut that door
[1:08:58] and you know the same thing is happening
[1:09:00] today brothers and sisters
[1:09:02] don't look for a physical closing of the
[1:09:04] door because you're going to miss it if
[1:09:05] you do
[1:09:06] if you look for a physical closing of
[1:09:08] the door like the boat
[1:09:10] it's going to be too late because that
[1:09:12] door closed for Noah and he sat there
[1:09:14] how long was it seven days
[1:09:17] he sat there and we talked about it
[1:09:19] there was questions are you sure honey
[1:09:21] daddy is this right you know all the
[1:09:23] people outside throwing tomatoes and and
[1:09:25] whatever else and mocking them hahaha
[1:09:28] it's gonna rain it's gonna rain
[1:09:29] same thing with us brothers and sisters
[1:09:31] Believers coming into the church it's
[1:09:33] not going to be a literal door closing
[1:09:35] it's actually a spiritual door closing
[1:09:37] and choosing not to get all the way into
[1:09:40] Christ is going to close that door one
[1:09:42] day on our lives
[1:09:44] but God gave Noah a message to preach
[1:09:46] and and the people had the opportunity
[1:09:47] to accept what that Prophet had to say
[1:09:49] for that day or reject it
[1:09:52] and and there was only one way that you
[1:09:54] could accept it
[1:09:55] and it's the same thing with the message
[1:09:56] today is to accept it all
[1:09:59] or to not accept it you can't just
[1:10:01] accept part of it and think that you're
[1:10:03] actually getting in the boat right
[1:10:07] you had to get in the boat if you just
[1:10:09] tried to hang on to the outside of the
[1:10:10] boat you perished
[1:10:12] you had to get in the boat
[1:10:16] he told told Noah make thee an ark
[1:10:20] Adam just going back to the beginning
[1:10:22] just the simple simple stuff here
[1:10:24] tonight as we close
[1:10:25] Adam he had a word for his day
[1:10:29] what was that word
[1:10:32] God gave it to Adam
[1:10:34] he gave it directly to Adam
[1:10:37] and it was
[1:10:40] of every tree in the garden thou may eat
[1:10:42] freely
[1:10:44] but of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:10:46] Evil Thou shalt not eat of it
[1:10:49] for in the day that thou eat thereof
[1:10:51] Thou shalt surely die
[1:10:54] God didn't come down and tell everyone
[1:10:56] in the garden
[1:10:57] he didn't come down until Eve because it
[1:10:59] was the very next scripture
[1:11:01] in in Genesis chapter 2 that he actually
[1:11:04] split Adam and Eve that he formed the
[1:11:08] woman
[1:11:09] it was the very next scripture and Eve
[1:11:12] once Adam preached that gospel to her
[1:11:14] she had a choice
[1:11:16] she could either accept what was
[1:11:18] preached
[1:11:19] or decline what was preached
[1:11:22] and us today brothers and sisters with
[1:11:24] the message of the hour we have the
[1:11:25] opportunity to accept all of it in its
[1:11:27] entirety and to leave one part of it out
[1:11:29] brothers and sisters it means death
[1:11:32] it's not going to be well I I don't know
[1:11:35] I I'll still be fine I'll still be able
[1:11:37] to make it I'll still be able to find a
[1:11:39] way to get there maybe
[1:11:41] but I know I remember hearing brother
[1:11:42] Ken say this and it's just becoming so
[1:11:44] real to me uh this last while how if we
[1:11:47] do go and stand before that white Throne
[1:11:49] we've talked about it many times I've
[1:11:50] pondered this for hours if we do make it
[1:11:53] to that white Throne that's going to be
[1:11:55] a horrifically frightening place to be
[1:11:58] no way man we don't want to be there
[1:11:59] we've been given the ability to have
[1:12:01] ears to hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:12:03] the church why would we want to try and
[1:12:05] interpret it and make it something other
[1:12:06] than what the prophet said it was my
[1:12:09] goodness you've had a choice we have the
[1:12:12] same thing today God sent a prophet to
[1:12:13] set things in order in the church in the
[1:12:15] spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of
[1:12:17] the of the fathers back to the children
[1:12:19] and the hearts of the children back to
[1:12:21] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers if
[1:12:24] we don't actually go all the way into
[1:12:26] that brothers and sisters we're missing
[1:12:28] the point we're we're not actually going
[1:12:30] to be that bride of his own choosing
[1:12:33] remember there's five wise and five
[1:12:35] foolish
[1:12:36] which one are we
[1:12:39] but the Branham says a few things I
[1:12:41] think the first thing and I believe
[1:12:42] these things which I say is essential
[1:12:44] and must be carried out in this manner
[1:12:46] in the Branham Tabernacle for it to
[1:12:48] prosper in the Lord remember how
[1:12:51] Moses
[1:12:52] he said to the children of Israel on the
[1:12:54] last plague we've got to follow the lord
[1:12:57] very carefully for this last one here
[1:13:00] we've got to apply the token to our
[1:13:01] homes exactly follow my instructions
[1:13:04] exactly the way God has told me
[1:13:08] or we're going to see death
[1:13:10] brother Branham says it here just brings
[1:13:12] that to mind I think the first thing and
[1:13:14] and believe that these things which I
[1:13:16] say is essential and must be carried out
[1:13:18] in this manner in the Branham Tabernacle
[1:13:20] for it to prosper in the Lord I think
[1:13:23] first that every member or worshiper of
[1:13:25] the Branham Tabernacle should be in so
[1:13:27] much in Divine love with each other
[1:13:31] until their hearts would long for each
[1:13:34] other when they have to go away
[1:13:36] do our hearts long for each other when
[1:13:38] we have to go away to leave each other
[1:13:41] at the service at night
[1:13:43] he says I'm a True Believer in Divine
[1:13:45] love the Apostle Paul said that was the
[1:13:48] evidence of the Holy Spirit by this
[1:13:49] manner will all man know that you are my
[1:13:51] disciples and what manner that you have
[1:13:54] love one for the other
[1:13:56] and that doesn't mean love I have to
[1:13:58] correct you I've got to spank you you
[1:14:00] need a gospel spanking no
[1:14:02] no no no no no
[1:14:04] exhorting one another
[1:14:06] even more so as we see the day
[1:14:09] approaching many times it's taken as oh
[1:14:10] we need to assemble ourselves even more
[1:14:12] so as we see the day approaching
[1:14:13] brothers and sisters that's only the
[1:14:15] first part of a three-part verse the
[1:14:18] middle part is exhorting one another
[1:14:20] even more so as we see the day
[1:14:22] approaching encouraging one another
[1:14:24] calling one another talking to one
[1:14:25] another just encouraging one another
[1:14:28] exhorting one another
[1:14:30] he says now the next thing we believe
[1:14:31] that these worshipers should meet
[1:14:33] together
[1:14:34] these gifted people such as tongues and
[1:14:36] people who gets Revelations and
[1:14:38] interpretations and so forth these
[1:14:40] members or these Believers rather should
[1:14:42] come together at least 45 minutes or an
[1:14:45] hour before the services ever begun oh
[1:14:48] my
[1:14:50] putting this together I'm thinking
[1:14:52] goodness we have trouble getting here
[1:14:55] half an hour before
[1:14:56] 45 minutes to an hour
[1:15:00] you know one thing I'm learning about is
[1:15:02] uh just in terms of tithing
[1:15:05] if we don't give back when we have a
[1:15:07] gift
[1:15:07] that gift is going to dry up brothers
[1:15:09] and sisters in our lives God gives us a
[1:15:12] gift if we don't use it if we don't
[1:15:14] actually try and give out from that gift
[1:15:16] it might be scary it might be tough it
[1:15:18] might it might cost us financially it
[1:15:21] might cost us sleep it might cost us
[1:15:23] friends if we don't give out of that
[1:15:24] gift it's going to dry out we're gonna
[1:15:26] maybe not hit the purpose that we're
[1:15:28] here for
[1:15:30] but the Branham says 45 minutes or an
[1:15:32] hour before the services ever begin just
[1:15:34] for the record I am usually always here
[1:15:37] at least an hour before service there's
[1:15:39] the odd time where I'm not but it's very
[1:15:42] very rare these days and you know as I
[1:15:44] go into this and talk about it I don't
[1:15:46] want to talk in a way that sounds like
[1:15:47] I'm Pious and I'm here early and I don't
[1:15:50] know where everyone else is let me tell
[1:15:52] you I'll tell you straight out I I used
[1:15:55] to be a deacon in this church and uh as
[1:15:58] a deacon I should be setting the example
[1:16:00] yeah
[1:16:01] I'm not saying anything about the new
[1:16:03] deacons just for the record I'm just
[1:16:04] talking about me
[1:16:06] and uh
[1:16:08] we had a young family we had a business
[1:16:10] we're busy busy busy busy busy busy
[1:16:12] nobody
[1:16:14] as busy as us
[1:16:16] and you know what happened many times I
[1:16:18] was late to service just about every
[1:16:19] time make the service late to service
[1:16:21] late to service late to service late to
[1:16:23] service
[1:16:24] and thanks be to God for a pastor that
[1:16:27] never ever destroyed me for it
[1:16:30] he could have
[1:16:32] he could have crushed me with it with
[1:16:34] the message of the hour he could have
[1:16:36] picked it up and used it as a
[1:16:37] three-sided club and hammered me and Ben
[1:16:39] Wright
[1:16:41] but you know I never did never not once
[1:16:46] many times there would be a suggestion
[1:16:49] it would be a loving comment
[1:16:51] it would be encouragement
[1:16:54] but he never once destroyed me
[1:16:56] and told me that I was wrong
[1:16:58] he never did
[1:17:00] and what happened because of that
[1:17:02] he encouraged me
[1:17:04] and you know when I started to look at
[1:17:07] myself and and step into this role I
[1:17:09] started to look back on my life and
[1:17:12] think man
[1:17:14] man thank you Lord for a pastor that
[1:17:18] would so be so encouraging in love that
[1:17:22] would never destroy me
[1:17:23] even though he could have
[1:17:27] we come together half an hour early
[1:17:28] brothers and sisters for a purpose
[1:17:30] and we can look it up in the message
[1:17:32] further than this we're talking about
[1:17:33] gifts and and callings and if people
[1:17:36] feel like they get Revelations and
[1:17:37] different things and and they want to
[1:17:39] see this stuff operate there's a very
[1:17:40] specific formula for it and I'm all for
[1:17:42] it I'm very interested in seeing people
[1:17:44] maybe that feel led to do that if you
[1:17:46] have that caller desire whatever let's
[1:17:48] let's do it let's see what can happen
[1:17:51] but we got to come to church early we
[1:17:53] need to set that atmosphere
[1:17:55] if we're going to set an atmosphere
[1:17:57] correctly then we need to come according
[1:17:59] to the word for our day if we don't come
[1:18:01] according to the word for our day are we
[1:18:03] going to get the true Apostolic blessing
[1:18:05] that we're looking for and if we're not
[1:18:07] if we're not going to get the apostolic
[1:18:09] blessing that we're looking for because
[1:18:10] we're not taking the entirety of the
[1:18:12] word and applying it in our lives then
[1:18:13] what on Earth are we doing brothers and
[1:18:15] sisters I'm looking back on my life
[1:18:17] thinking what was I doing but you know
[1:18:20] what it was it was growing and learning
[1:18:24] and having the place to get Washed by
[1:18:26] the Water of the word and not get
[1:18:28] destroyed
[1:18:30] but encouraged
[1:18:32] exhorted
[1:18:33] even more so as we see the day
[1:18:35] approaching
[1:18:37] I can look back now and I just I'm so
[1:18:39] incredibly thankful for a loving Pastor
[1:18:41] all this other stuff will follow
[1:18:44] not lead
[1:18:45] so when I talk about church order and
[1:18:47] and and the gifts in the church and all
[1:18:49] this stuff just be clear
[1:18:51] we're not looking for that to happen to
[1:18:53] have a Vindication because we've already
[1:18:55] got the Vindication we've got the
[1:18:57] mystery of God revealed to us already
[1:18:58] through the prophet we have the open
[1:19:00] Word
[1:19:01] that's what we're after
[1:19:04] but just to look at it
[1:19:05] as we go forward as a church we've had
[1:19:08] such a crazy time to go through all of
[1:19:10] this upheaval and and covid and and and
[1:19:13] stuff
[1:19:15] as we go forward we want to make sure I
[1:19:17] don't know maybe it's just me I want to
[1:19:19] make sure that I have the right
[1:19:20] direction I have the right motive and
[1:19:23] and I'm looking for the right purpose
[1:19:25] for what we're doing here
[1:19:27] brother Branham says but if I had to
[1:19:28] have it I'd put that first because if
[1:19:30] you've got that the other will take
[1:19:32] place aha see if you've got that if you
[1:19:35] if you'll just get so hungry for God
[1:19:37] shouting will take place if you got so
[1:19:40] hungry for God speaking in tongues will
[1:19:42] take place if you got so hungry for God
[1:19:44] you'll just keep on hungering keep
[1:19:46] yourself
[1:19:48] now you go to seeing yourself getting
[1:19:50] indifferent just remember look out
[1:19:54] there's another Spirit trying to work
[1:19:56] itself in there
[1:19:59] we need to make sure that we don't have
[1:20:01] another Spirit trying to work itself in
[1:20:03] there if we're getting indifferent or we
[1:20:05] have an issue or there's a problem or
[1:20:07] there's something that hasn't been dealt
[1:20:09] with got to make sure that we don't let
[1:20:11] that happen because brother Bradham says
[1:20:12] it right here that's the indifference
[1:20:14] when that sets in that's another Spirit
[1:20:16] moving in our lives we have to be able
[1:20:19] to discern the spirits is what the word
[1:20:20] says
[1:20:21] we were talking about a little bit on a
[1:20:23] chat today you know about fear and and
[1:20:26] fear
[1:20:27] it just hit me so hard fear is is like
[1:20:30] one of the emotions that comes across
[1:20:32] people and it's a normal human condition
[1:20:34] to have fear
[1:20:36] carnally speaking but according to the
[1:20:39] word it's incorrect because it's a
[1:20:40] spirit
[1:20:43] and I quoted a scripture that God hath
[1:20:45] not given us the spirit of fear
[1:20:47] out of Timothy he's given us his spirit
[1:20:51] of power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:20:56] it just really struck me this morning I
[1:20:58] I dealt with a major major fear Spirit a
[1:21:01] couple years ago and I alluded to that a
[1:21:03] little while ago so much fear that I
[1:21:05] started to hear that voice saying that
[1:21:07] you're you're probably better off dead
[1:21:09] brothers and sisters don't listen to
[1:21:11] fear fear is an evil spirit so is
[1:21:14] indifference
[1:21:16] indifference is an evil spirit
[1:21:19] but the brown talks about the church age
[1:21:21] book he says why do people stay sick
[1:21:24] and and you know why
[1:21:25] it's because of indifference people get
[1:21:28] get ill and and they get indifferent we
[1:21:31] don't want indifference in our lives if
[1:21:33] we have indifference we need to maybe
[1:21:34] take a little closer examination maybe
[1:21:36] we need to talk to someone who is a
[1:21:38] mentor in our life maybe someone who we
[1:21:41] trust and try and find out what's going
[1:21:43] on because indifference is an evil
[1:21:45] spirit
[1:21:46] it wants to cause division
[1:21:49] I don't even know why I'm talking about
[1:21:50] that just remember he says look out
[1:21:53] there's another Spirit trying to work
[1:21:54] itself in there stay right before God
[1:21:56] humble with travail of Soul just be all
[1:22:00] that good old-fashioned
[1:22:02] you know one thing I would say it's
[1:22:04] interesting we'll probably get into it
[1:22:06] later on did anybody ever look up stuff
[1:22:09] shirt in the message
[1:22:12] stuffed shirt I'll just throw that out
[1:22:14] there stuffed shirt
[1:22:16] it's interesting
[1:22:18] look that up if you have the time or you
[1:22:21] feel inclined
[1:22:22] we need to stay humble
[1:22:25] and and that's really the contrast to it
[1:22:26] brother Branham talks about it if we're
[1:22:28] not humble
[1:22:29] then we become a stuffed shirt
[1:22:31] and really what it is is is is is the
[1:22:34] Badger skin this flesh this Tabernacle
[1:22:36] it just gets another spirit inside it
[1:22:38] that Puffs it up and it becomes
[1:22:41] something that's different than the
[1:22:42] spirit of God
[1:22:45] tonight we're talking about church order
[1:22:46] though I want I want to go back to that
[1:22:48] and and and just kind of remain there
[1:22:51] for a little while
[1:22:53] just so we know that uh
[1:22:56] we know that we're on the right
[1:22:57] trajectory with what we're doing in the
[1:22:59] church
[1:23:04] we need to receive the person of Jesus
[1:23:06] Christ
[1:23:07] and that's really the key
[1:23:09] if we can actually receive the person of
[1:23:11] Jesus Christ then we'll see success in
[1:23:13] the word we'll see the word have success
[1:23:15] in us we'll be able to sing that word
[1:23:16] song that the word is working mightily I
[1:23:19] mean it doesn't matter what circumstance
[1:23:21] is it doesn't matter what I feel or see
[1:23:23] but we the word is just doing it because
[1:23:25] I believe I've met the requirements I
[1:23:28] believe and and that's all it takes
[1:23:31] gives us the ability to receive the
[1:23:33] person of Christ out of questions and
[1:23:35] answers in in 54. he says but it's
[1:23:38] accepting the person of Jesus Christ and
[1:23:40] these other things come right on in and
[1:23:42] they fit together like let every member
[1:23:44] of this body this morning tonight
[1:23:47] let this little group of people if we
[1:23:50] could just pull back the curtains if we
[1:23:52] could just pull the curtains down along
[1:23:54] each side and every person in here
[1:23:56] receive the person of Christ Jesus there
[1:24:00] wouldn't never be a fuss
[1:24:04] there would never be an argument
[1:24:07] there would just be a perfect love
[1:24:10] yet you would still believe this and
[1:24:12] believe that because we're humans we
[1:24:14] would still have our opinion our opinion
[1:24:16] but we would have just a love there'd be
[1:24:18] a perfect love yet you'd still believe
[1:24:21] this and believe that but it'd just be
[1:24:23] so full of love that that's it now Jesus
[1:24:26] said by their fruit you shall know them
[1:24:29] and by the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:24:31] joy peace long-suffering goodness
[1:24:33] meekness gentleness
[1:24:36] it's Galatians 6 22-23
[1:24:40] that was just sort of a kind of a
[1:24:43] preamble into this church order just to
[1:24:45] to see that really that's the direction
[1:24:47] we're going brothers and sisters I I
[1:24:49] feel checked so many times when I get
[1:24:51] into this stuff I yeah I just have to
[1:24:54] say this that I feel like a kid and and
[1:24:59] and there's a bunch of adults that I'm
[1:25:01] talking to in terms of the message
[1:25:03] there's so many people that know the
[1:25:04] message better than me that have been
[1:25:06] around the message for longer than me
[1:25:09] etc etc etc and and and and mistakes
[1:25:12] I'll make mistakes I have made and and
[1:25:15] so many times
[1:25:16] I feel
[1:25:18] really insignificant and that's why I I
[1:25:21] say tonight I just felt like singing
[1:25:23] that word and I really do sing that word
[1:25:25] myself when I start to get down because
[1:25:27] it doesn't matter what I feel like if
[1:25:29] God's called me then then he'll look
[1:25:31] after me he'll make a way for me and
[1:25:33] somehow someway his children will be
[1:25:36] blessed I trust it but we just want to
[1:25:40] make sure that I I guess my heart's
[1:25:42] desire is if I could ever come across as
[1:25:45] as maybe Gruff sometimes I can say
[1:25:48] things that maybe maybe they just rub
[1:25:50] people the wrong way that's I'm sorry
[1:25:53] for that I apologize maybe that's my
[1:25:54] human nature I don't want to do that to
[1:25:56] people I want to encourage people into
[1:25:59] the word I want to encourage us to come
[1:26:01] together if if if I have said anything
[1:26:04] in a way that maybe is abrasive to
[1:26:06] people that certainly is not my intent
[1:26:08] or desire
[1:26:09] sometimes and I'll I'll probably hear
[1:26:11] about it after sometimes my wife she
[1:26:14] just says to me like we say to the
[1:26:15] children just quiet you know maybe just
[1:26:18] a little bit less Gruff a little bit
[1:26:20] softer a little bit Kinder just a little
[1:26:23] bit tempered
[1:26:25] and
[1:26:26] I guess it's my my nature but anyways I
[1:26:30] I just want to know want to try and say
[1:26:33] that my heart's desire is for us to grow
[1:26:35] together in and in the Lord and the Lord
[1:26:37] in us together it's not to make anybody
[1:26:40] feel bad or or put anybody out just
[1:26:44] if you can bear with me and I don't
[1:26:45] really have I'm not trying to feed us a
[1:26:48] sandwich tonight and start out with
[1:26:49] really good happy and then the really
[1:26:51] sticker and then end with good happy
[1:26:54] that's not it I'm just being me I'm just
[1:26:57] trying to talk that's all
[1:26:59] going into this church order though I
[1:27:00] just want to try and sort of I'd like to
[1:27:03] try and wrap it up but I see time always
[1:27:05] flies and uh you know maybe we'll try
[1:27:08] and wrap it up tonight we might have
[1:27:09] another service with it Lord willing
[1:27:11] we'll see what he wants to do
[1:27:12] and just go with it just sort of as an
[1:27:15] introduction tonight uh with this we'll
[1:27:17] try and catch up to where we left off
[1:27:19] you know brother Branham says we believe
[1:27:21] in an Apostolic Church teaching
[1:27:22] Apostolic blessing for the people of
[1:27:24] this day that's that's what we believe
[1:27:26] and I truly believe that we all believe
[1:27:28] everything that we say in here and if
[1:27:31] there's anything that I do say and and
[1:27:32] maybe there is a disagreement I
[1:27:34] certainly would like to talk about it
[1:27:36] because I don't want to represent
[1:27:37] anything incorrect according to the
[1:27:39] message of the hour and I don't want to
[1:27:40] interject my opinion because my opinion
[1:27:43] really isn't worth anything the only
[1:27:45] thing that I want to do is try and
[1:27:46] uphold the message of the hour before
[1:27:48] the people that's the only thing that's
[1:27:49] going to bring the change of our bodies
[1:27:51] that's it
[1:27:52] we believe in the Full Gospel and
[1:27:54] believe that all the signs and wonders
[1:27:56] that was spoken of by our Lord Jesus
[1:27:58] Christ would accompany his church until
[1:28:01] he returned
[1:28:03] we have seen so many miracles in our
[1:28:05] midst I know it
[1:28:07] we've had many many testimony services
[1:28:10] and they're very powerful they're very
[1:28:12] important and we'll continue holding
[1:28:14] them
[1:28:15] we're not going to stop doing testimony
[1:28:17] services
[1:28:18] we believe in those things and we
[1:28:20] believe that they are to be set in order
[1:28:21] that the church has its order
[1:28:24] and each church has its Doctrine and
[1:28:27] Order and discipline
[1:28:29] there's a reason why we do things the
[1:28:31] way we do
[1:28:32] it's not because we we have an
[1:28:34] association and we want to try and and
[1:28:37] and just carry on according to what
[1:28:39] William Branham did at eighth and Penn
[1:28:41] in in Jeffersonville Indiana because we
[1:28:44] we follow the man what what he did was
[1:28:46] he set a pattern in order for the Church
[1:28:49] of its day just like Paul said in order
[1:28:52] a pattern for the Church of its day and
[1:28:56] and and we want to make sure that we
[1:28:58] just follow it so that what we can see
[1:29:00] is that Apostolic blessing in our lives
[1:29:03] if we take and interpret this word and
[1:29:06] try and apply it in a different way
[1:29:07] maybe get a little bit more contemporary
[1:29:09] in in our services with our music maybe
[1:29:11] we get a little more contemporary with
[1:29:14] with the things that we do bring in a
[1:29:15] coffee bar in the back to try and
[1:29:17] accommodate people and encourage people
[1:29:19] and have you know maybe fresh hot baked
[1:29:21] danishes in the morning on Sundays to
[1:29:23] attract people that's not what the
[1:29:25] prophet taught that's not going to bring
[1:29:27] us an Apostolic blessing it will bring
[1:29:29] more people it might bring more tithes
[1:29:31] it might bring a greater attraction here
[1:29:34] but what are we attracting people to the
[1:29:37] attraction or are we attracting people
[1:29:38] to the word we want to make sure that
[1:29:41] we're attracting people to the word of
[1:29:42] God because we're going to need the word
[1:29:44] of God in our lives as we go we need
[1:29:47] that Apostolic blessing in our lives
[1:29:49] when we pray for our children to go to
[1:29:51] school when we pray for our children
[1:29:52] when they come home when we pray that he
[1:29:55] will give us traveling mercies to go to
[1:29:57] Lethbridge or wherever it is we go or
[1:29:59] whatever it is we do he cares about all
[1:30:01] of it and we need to make sure that
[1:30:03] we're setting the right pattern in order
[1:30:05] when we come to church we're not coming
[1:30:07] to play Church we're coming to see that
[1:30:09] Apostolic blessing we're coming to meet
[1:30:11] with the Lord God Almighty we've said it
[1:30:14] before just like the the Old Testament
[1:30:16] priests when they would go into the
[1:30:17] holiest of holies one time a year if
[1:30:21] they didn't have it all right in their
[1:30:23] life
[1:30:24] they would die
[1:30:26] and they would have to be hauled out by
[1:30:28] that rope tied to their ankles
[1:30:30] do we take it serious when we come to
[1:30:33] church when we fellowship at church when
[1:30:36] we come to play music when we come to
[1:30:38] minister when we come to just partake of
[1:30:40] the service and pull on the gift are we
[1:30:42] taking it that serious brothers and
[1:30:45] sisters I'm not trying to say that we're
[1:30:46] not but I just want to make sure that we
[1:30:48] are because it is the same Jesus Christ
[1:30:51] that was in the holiest of holies that's
[1:30:54] here tonight
[1:30:56] and and if we can just understand that
[1:31:00] if we can have that God Consciousness
[1:31:01] that it's not even just right here
[1:31:04] wherever we go in our lives if we have
[1:31:07] everything in order in our lives
[1:31:08] wherever we go we're bringing him with
[1:31:10] us that atmosphere where people will
[1:31:13] just apologize for swearing around you
[1:31:16] because they there's just they don't
[1:31:18] even know why that why did I just
[1:31:19] apologize why did I apologize for a
[1:31:21] swear they don't even know that there's
[1:31:23] an atmosphere around us
[1:31:26] brother Branham goes on to say that
[1:31:27] there's no members as joiners our church
[1:31:29] has no members as joiners we believe
[1:31:31] that the whole Universal Church of the
[1:31:33] Living God is our brothers and our
[1:31:35] sisters and it's a many membered body
[1:31:37] these are my words now it's a
[1:31:39] many-membered body the mystical body of
[1:31:41] Jesus Christ the same people that are
[1:31:43] here have the same spirit that we would
[1:31:45] see over there if we would go to another
[1:31:47] continent we would see The Same Spirit
[1:31:49] in people over there it's the same
[1:31:51] spirit all over the place God doesn't
[1:31:54] have culture it doesn't work to say that
[1:31:57] I've got a cultural difference from
[1:31:59] where I was raised and that makes the
[1:32:01] message any different no no no no no
[1:32:02] that's not going to work that doesn't
[1:32:04] fly not in God's economy nope the Holy
[1:32:07] Spirit has one spirit it's one Spirit we
[1:32:11] are baptized into his body but it's a
[1:32:14] many-membered body the mystical body of
[1:32:16] Jesus Christ and and all people are
[1:32:18] welcome
[1:32:19] Branham said that in his church and we
[1:32:21] say that here all people are welcome
[1:32:26] all people are always welcome regardless
[1:32:28] of what denomination they belong to
[1:32:30] imagine that there's some some people in
[1:32:33] in the message of the hour that would
[1:32:34] come in they would probably have
[1:32:36] different Slants to what we believe and
[1:32:38] it might make us feel really
[1:32:39] uncomfortable to see them come through
[1:32:41] the doors
[1:32:42] but as brothers and sisters
[1:32:45] we'll welcome them
[1:32:46] bring them in they might have an
[1:32:49] opportunity to hear the word preached in
[1:32:50] a way that maybe they never have before
[1:32:53] it might bring them back in off of that
[1:32:55] limb that they've been taught to go and
[1:32:56] stand out on
[1:32:58] we've talked quite thoroughly about
[1:33:00] justification sanctification to the
[1:33:02] baptism of the Holy Holy Spirit brother
[1:33:05] Bradham says we believe that the holy
[1:33:06] spirit is putting that same vessel into
[1:33:09] service we know the the story of the cup
[1:33:11] the analogy of it being picked up
[1:33:13] cleaned out and then set aside for
[1:33:15] service I just want to pick up from
[1:33:17] justification and sanctification and and
[1:33:19] go into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:21] part of it here we believe that the holy
[1:33:23] spirit is putting that same vessel into
[1:33:25] service and that Holy Spirit is not
[1:33:27] another step of Grace but more of the
[1:33:29] same Grace that fills the believer to
[1:33:32] the extent where signs and wonders such
[1:33:33] as the apostolic gifts spoken in First
[1:33:35] Corinthians 12 manifest himself through
[1:33:38] this believer when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:33:40] in to take up the gifts brothers and
[1:33:43] sisters every single one of us were born
[1:33:46] with gifts
[1:33:48] every single one of us have gifts that
[1:33:50] God has placed in US purposefully from
[1:33:53] before the foundation of the world and
[1:33:55] you know when we go forwards and and we
[1:33:58] get that that word starts to pour on us
[1:34:01] like Moses turning to look at that that
[1:34:03] burning bush that light that
[1:34:05] Supernatural light flashed upon that
[1:34:07] seed in his heart in his soul that
[1:34:10] happens to us when we hear the word
[1:34:11] being preached when we press play when
[1:34:13] we come to church when we stream
[1:34:14] whatever it is we do now when we hear
[1:34:16] the true word being preached to us it
[1:34:19] does something to us what it does is it
[1:34:21] triggers that gift that life that's in
[1:34:23] us from before the foundation of the
[1:34:25] world that seed Gene of God cracks open
[1:34:27] and starts to come to life and grow and
[1:34:30] the more we listen Faith cometh by
[1:34:32] hearing by hearing what by hearing the
[1:34:34] word of God and the more that we feed
[1:34:36] the more that we learn the more that we
[1:34:38] hear the greater we grow and and that
[1:34:41] gift within us actually grows and you
[1:34:44] know my heart's desire I'm learning
[1:34:46] brothers and sisters I am learning and I
[1:34:48] trust that you'll just bear with me I
[1:34:50] understand it now a little better and
[1:34:53] that is that when there is a gift in
[1:34:54] somebody if we don't actually use that
[1:34:57] gift if that gift doesn't have a way to
[1:34:59] express itself then that gift will
[1:35:01] either die or it will go away
[1:35:03] we have to encourage the gifts there's
[1:35:06] young people that potentially have gifts
[1:35:08] of Music we need to encourage those
[1:35:09] gifts in the assembly and and that's our
[1:35:11] our hearts desire is to do that there
[1:35:13] could be gifts and adults to sing there
[1:35:15] could be gifts in adults to play there
[1:35:17] could be gifts in adults to build to do
[1:35:20] things we want to make sure that
[1:35:22] everybody has the ability to express
[1:35:23] their gift if there's Gifts of specials
[1:35:26] whatever it is everyone has a gift that
[1:35:29] God has placed in them from before the
[1:35:30] foundation of the world and we want to
[1:35:31] encourage that we're not looking to see
[1:35:34] remember we're not looking to see the
[1:35:36] signs and wonders but there are gifts
[1:35:39] there's Gifts of tongues there's Gifts
[1:35:41] of discernment there's Gifts of wisdom
[1:35:44] there's Gifts of healing there's many
[1:35:46] different gifts and they're all alive
[1:35:48] and well in the body
[1:35:51] brother Bradham says I believe that the
[1:35:52] scripture teaches that gifts and
[1:35:54] callings are without repentance and and
[1:35:56] that when we are born in this world we
[1:35:58] are sent here by one purpose that is of
[1:36:00] god and that before we are even become
[1:36:03] adults while we are yet children the
[1:36:05] gifts that we have of God is in us then
[1:36:09] and only the filling of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:12] puts these gifts into operation
[1:36:15] brothers and sisters if you could just
[1:36:17] pause with me there and think about how
[1:36:20] many times since I've ministered behind
[1:36:22] this Pulpit that I've said holy spirit
[1:36:25] I think that sums it up right there
[1:36:28] there's an importance of having the Holy
[1:36:30] Spirit not just to be saved but to
[1:36:32] actually operate the gift there's a
[1:36:34] purpose for us to be here it's not just
[1:36:36] to be saved even though it is for God to
[1:36:39] express his purpose through our lives
[1:36:41] but it's a many-membered body and and
[1:36:43] and we tend to one another we help one
[1:36:46] another through the gifts that God has
[1:36:48] given us
[1:36:51] brother Branham says the Holy Spirit
[1:36:53] puts these gifts into operation but we
[1:36:55] have them in the beginning such as
[1:36:57] teachers and apostles and Prophets and
[1:36:58] Gifts of tongues and the nine spiritual
[1:37:00] gifts according to First Corinthians 12.
[1:37:02] now we believe that these gifts are in
[1:37:04] operation today and that they should be
[1:37:07] in every local church and there's some
[1:37:09] people that would probably say today
[1:37:10] while that was back in brother branham's
[1:37:12] era you know back in in the day in the
[1:37:15] 60s when he was on Earth in his church
[1:37:17] only and and not today but you know
[1:37:20] that's that's a lie of the devil that is
[1:37:23] a lie of the devil the word doesn't
[1:37:25] change I was having a conversation with
[1:37:27] someone this week as well talking about
[1:37:29] the Pentecostal life and how the
[1:37:31] Pentecostals live and it's just
[1:37:32] astounding it was astounding for me
[1:37:34] coming from the Pentecostal Faith to
[1:37:36] believe to understand the teaching
[1:37:38] rather that you know once you receive
[1:37:40] the the ability to speak in tongues then
[1:37:42] you know you've received the gift of the
[1:37:44] Holy Ghost and and that the the initial
[1:37:46] evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able
[1:37:48] to speak in tongues but once I actually
[1:37:50] came and started to hear the word the
[1:37:52] open word the revealed word of our day
[1:37:54] and saw wait a second the word nobody
[1:37:56] told me brother Branham didn't say it I
[1:37:58] don't think brother Ken preached it but
[1:38:00] as I began to feed on the word I saw
[1:38:03] there was nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:38:05] Bible
[1:38:06] and maybe brother Ken preached it he
[1:38:08] probably did he probably preached it but
[1:38:10] it caused me to go and read it for
[1:38:11] myself in the Bible and say I can see in
[1:38:14] the Bible forget about what brother
[1:38:16] Branham says forget about what anybody
[1:38:18] else says the Bible says nine spiritual
[1:38:20] gifts why are they saying one what is
[1:38:22] wrong with that
[1:38:24] that's crazy
[1:38:27] going on in in this message brother
[1:38:30] Branham says fanaticism
[1:38:33] fanaticism although in such we have
[1:38:35] found throughout the world that there is
[1:38:37] much fanaticism hooked along with people
[1:38:39] who profess
[1:38:41] to be Apostolic believers
[1:38:45] and right away as I was going through
[1:38:47] this it just made me think scarecrows
[1:38:49] and and anybody who feels inclined look
[1:38:52] it up in the message I'll just read a
[1:38:54] couple of quotes about scarecrows what
[1:38:55] brother Branham says I've I've read them
[1:38:57] before but I'll just do it again you
[1:38:59] know 1963
[1:39:01] standing in the gap
[1:39:03] that's how you know a Christian by how
[1:39:05] he lives
[1:39:06] so never jump any higher than you live
[1:39:10] so then just put in there
[1:39:13] but it's a devil making a scarecrow to
[1:39:16] keep the real genuine Believers away
[1:39:18] from the true thing of it
[1:39:20] but God help us to separate and be able
[1:39:23] to discern between right and wrong
[1:39:26] how would we ever do it if it would be
[1:39:28] so close that it would deceive the very
[1:39:29] elected if it would be possible without
[1:39:31] the Holy Spirit and our lives brothers
[1:39:32] and sisters
[1:39:33] without having the person of Jesus
[1:39:35] Christ come into our lives come into our
[1:39:37] hearts come into our souls
[1:39:40] it's got to be all the way in our souls
[1:39:42] if it's just on our flesh level it ain't
[1:39:45] gonna work if it's just in our spirit it
[1:39:48] ain't gonna work
[1:39:49] it's got to go all the way down right
[1:39:51] down into that throne room of our hearts
[1:39:54] but God help us to separate and be able
[1:39:57] to discern between right and wrong and
[1:39:59] the word will always straighten that out
[1:40:00] isn't that wonderful
[1:40:03] he tells us that
[1:40:05] it will be potentially a problem if
[1:40:07] we're not careful the devil is going to
[1:40:08] set that trap he's going to distract us
[1:40:11] and get us confused but the word will
[1:40:14] always straighten it out
[1:40:17] perseverance in 62 but my sons don't be
[1:40:20] disturbed now just before his appearing
[1:40:22] there's going to be all kinds of
[1:40:23] fanaticism raise up around it always is
[1:40:25] it's the devil trying to put a scarecrow
[1:40:28] out see scare you away
[1:40:32] but remember the Scarecrow is always at
[1:40:35] the good tree
[1:40:37] you know I just want to throw this out
[1:40:39] there I know there's a history to the
[1:40:41] message of the hour and uh I know
[1:40:44] there's a lot of people that have seen
[1:40:46] this history actually forming over the
[1:40:49] decades from when brother Branham was
[1:40:51] actually on the scene and sorry in the
[1:40:55] 60s and the 70s and 80s and 90s all
[1:41:00] kinds of Faith healing Ministries
[1:41:02] impersonators exactly like brother
[1:41:04] Bradham talked about in uh in sirs is
[1:41:07] this the time of the end
[1:41:10] but fanaticism
[1:41:11] and you know I could be wrong about it
[1:41:14] but I think that I perceive
[1:41:17] I just perceive
[1:41:19] that there is a real fear
[1:41:22] about the operation of gifts
[1:41:24] around the message of the hour
[1:41:27] and and maybe I'm wrong 100 wrong
[1:41:29] whether I am or whether I'm not it's
[1:41:32] just my perception and and it just is
[1:41:35] brothers and sisters we don't have to be
[1:41:37] afraid
[1:41:38] the spirit of God will always lead us
[1:41:41] into truth
[1:41:43] if somebody speaks in tongues it's not
[1:41:45] going to be the wrong thing because here
[1:41:47] here's the key to it brother Branham in
[1:41:49] this message and and another one in
[1:41:51] other places in in the message if we
[1:41:53] research it he tells how things are
[1:41:56] supposed to happen and that's really
[1:41:57] what I want to get to tonight there's a
[1:41:59] very specific order for how this stuff
[1:42:02] is supposed to work and if we don't see
[1:42:04] it happen to the way it's supposed to
[1:42:06] work brother Bradham he's got a very
[1:42:08] clear answer for it then we're supposed
[1:42:11] to say hey those people who got up and
[1:42:13] prophesied in front of the whole church
[1:42:15] and said such and such and so and so and
[1:42:17] and whatever they need to come and
[1:42:19] confess before the church and say pray
[1:42:21] this lying Spirit off of me if it
[1:42:24] doesn't come to pass it's real simple
[1:42:27] but what happens is it becomes a big
[1:42:29] huge scarecrow on one hand people are
[1:42:31] afraid to operate the gifts to see the
[1:42:33] gifts because of all of the fanaticism
[1:42:36] that potentially they've seen and
[1:42:37] experienced and heard about
[1:42:39] and on the other hand
[1:42:41] there's people that have never
[1:42:42] experienced it or seen it
[1:42:44] and I can say this myself just speaking
[1:42:47] about speaking in tongues and
[1:42:48] interpreting I've seen it as a kid
[1:42:50] growing up in the church speaking in
[1:42:52] tongues and interpreting
[1:42:54] but you know what's amazing is I would
[1:42:57] see someone speak in tongues and then I
[1:42:59] would see a woman who is wearing a mini
[1:43:01] skirt high heels painted face cut hair
[1:43:04] interpret
[1:43:07] and for me as a kid it was just like you
[1:43:09] know whatever it's just church we just
[1:43:11] go in a church and it's the way they do
[1:43:12] it I I don't know I'd rather be sleeping
[1:43:14] that's how I felt but I remember looking
[1:43:16] around in wanderment seeing this happen
[1:43:18] and thinking it's all false and and
[1:43:21] knowing that it was incorrect false
[1:43:23] vessels brother Branham says that very
[1:43:25] clearly I'm not trying to talk about
[1:43:27] that tonight but what I'm saying is
[1:43:30] that it's scarecrows
[1:43:32] those things happen the wrong way
[1:43:35] but the only way that we can say they're
[1:43:37] happening wrong is because there is a
[1:43:39] right it's just like having the
[1:43:41] understanding of the message of the hour
[1:43:42] many people will say nobody's got it
[1:43:44] right nobody's got it right what what
[1:43:46] God's done in this age and doing in this
[1:43:48] day every single religion out there is
[1:43:50] wrong but the only way that can be is
[1:43:53] because there has to be a right
[1:43:55] it's the law of the contrast there has
[1:43:57] to be a correct
[1:43:59] brother Bradham says just remember not
[1:44:01] out on the old Sour Apples no it's
[1:44:04] always where the good eating's at so he
[1:44:06] said Just remember now there will be
[1:44:08] some raise up saying they're this and
[1:44:10] some saying they're that and some saying
[1:44:13] they're so forth and claiming Messiahs
[1:44:15] and everything else
[1:44:16] but don't you believe it now the only
[1:44:19] way to be sure is take what the word
[1:44:22] says
[1:44:24] and so I just want to talk about what
[1:44:27] does the word say for a little bit
[1:44:29] we know what the Bible says
[1:44:31] and the scriptures never contradict one
[1:44:34] another
[1:44:35] but there's a specific word for our day
[1:44:39] that God sent to us and how did we get
[1:44:41] that word we got it through a prophet
[1:44:44] and many people who who could be
[1:44:46] streaming in maybe new people might not
[1:44:48] understand this we understand it it's
[1:44:50] Elementary to the believer to the
[1:44:52] message believer the people who have
[1:44:53] been baptized by the Holy Spirit we get
[1:44:55] we get it we understand it but there
[1:44:58] might be people that don't quite
[1:44:59] understand this
[1:45:01] we follow the teachings of the New
[1:45:03] Testament for we believe that Jesus
[1:45:05] Christ being the Son of God and Paul the
[1:45:07] Apostle was called and the chosen vessel
[1:45:09] by election of God to be sent to the
[1:45:11] Gentile Church to set it in order
[1:45:13] brother Branham was sent to the Gentile
[1:45:15] Church in this age to shine a light on
[1:45:18] what
[1:45:20] this is my words now I'm not talking
[1:45:21] about I'm not reading a quote here he
[1:45:23] was sent to shine a light on what he was
[1:45:25] sent to shine a light on what Paul
[1:45:26] preached the word
[1:45:29] and and only the word
[1:45:31] you know maybe he had opinions and he
[1:45:33] would say it I I have this opinion and
[1:45:35] and and I I I estimate or or anticipate
[1:45:40] but whenever he said thus saith the Lord
[1:45:42] look out
[1:45:44] that's different
[1:45:46] but he was sent to actually shine a
[1:45:49] light on what Paul preached for a
[1:45:50] purpose just just going back to that
[1:45:52] word he did he had a purpose and that
[1:45:55] was to call out a bride of his own
[1:45:57] choosing through his chosen vessel of
[1:45:59] the day
[1:46:00] to go beyond the curtain of time and and
[1:46:02] see those millions of people saying that
[1:46:05] you know he preached what Paul preached
[1:46:06] if I have to be judged that I preach
[1:46:08] what Paul preached and all those people
[1:46:10] over there you and I brothers and
[1:46:11] sisters beyond the curtain of time we
[1:46:13] said we're resting on that we're resting
[1:46:15] on that that's us
[1:46:17] brother Brown talks about water baptism
[1:46:19] we believe in water baptism in the
[1:46:21] Branham Tabernacle by immersing in the
[1:46:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is
[1:46:24] the apostolic teaching of the Bible
[1:46:27] we believe that by water baptism we are
[1:46:30] brought into a fellowship but by the
[1:46:32] baptism of the Holy Spirit we're brought
[1:46:34] into the members being members of the
[1:46:37] body of Jesus Christ which is all over
[1:46:39] the world the many membered body of
[1:46:41] Christ the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:46:44] on Earth again the outward expression of
[1:46:47] that inward work of that that spirit of
[1:46:50] God coming down into the soul actually
[1:46:53] going beyond the the flesh level and
[1:46:56] saying that I just live my life as a
[1:46:57] good person and going beyond the spirit
[1:47:00] realm and changing the way that we act
[1:47:02] and and think and and behave going Way
[1:47:05] Beyond that we know that brother Branham
[1:47:07] says somewhere in the message that the
[1:47:08] the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:47:10] without sensation
[1:47:12] and and the kingdom of God and the word
[1:47:14] says that it comes without observation I
[1:47:17] look at brother Logan and say hey he's
[1:47:19] the same look he's a little older now
[1:47:20] but he's the same looking guy that was
[1:47:23] there on the ball river that day when we
[1:47:25] got baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:47:26] Jesus Christ and I probably look like
[1:47:27] the same guy maybe a little fatter a
[1:47:29] little heavier maybe a little more gray
[1:47:31] right here but we look like the same
[1:47:33] people right
[1:47:35] we don't change the kingdom of God comes
[1:47:37] without observation we look like the
[1:47:38] same people we see our family and they
[1:47:40] say you're the same guy what are you
[1:47:41] talking about you believe some message
[1:47:43] you've got a prophet you're joined a
[1:47:45] cult well no you haven't you've just
[1:47:47] been saved truly saved
[1:47:53] says now another thing that we believe
[1:47:55] that the manifestation of the spirit is
[1:47:57] given to every man to profit with all
[1:47:58] now we believe that when these gifts and
[1:48:01] so forth are operating in the church
