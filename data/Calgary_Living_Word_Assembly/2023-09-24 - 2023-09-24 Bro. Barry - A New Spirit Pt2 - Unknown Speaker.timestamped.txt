[44:49] seated
[44:55] my goodness
[44:57] certainly thankful for the the songs
[44:59] this morning
[45:01] the atmosphere that's set
[45:04] it's just wonderful when you get in the
[45:05] presence of the Lord and you have the
[45:07] ability to just worship Him freely
[45:09] there's people that would love to have
[45:12] the opportunity to gather together and
[45:14] just worship freely in this world
[45:16] but they know that if they dare try that
[45:18] they would be thrown in prison
[45:21] so they have to worship secretly and
[45:23] worship underground but we have been
[45:26] given such a blessing to be able to
[45:28] gather together in his name are you
[45:29] happy this morning
[45:31] just a few announcements before we get
[45:33] going here I just want to remind
[45:35] everyone October 1st is a Sunday we have
[45:38] brother James nuvanda Bandy here I
[45:42] believe it's October
[45:43] 7th and October 8th we will have brother
[45:47] Danny del mundo here from Philippines is
[45:50] that right brother yeah that's what we
[45:52] had arranged so October the 7th and
[45:54] October the 8th we'll have two Services
[45:56] Saturday evening at six o'clock
[45:59] and Sunday at 10 o'clock it's going to
[46:01] be dad brother Danny del mundo and his
[46:03] family will be here from Philippines
[46:05] they're the ones that we actually
[46:06] traveled around with in Philippines he's
[46:09] a brother that has a church there and he
[46:12] has many different outreaches and we
[46:14] have supported him in those outreaches
[46:16] quite a bit and look forward to many
[46:18] more supports in the future to see
[46:21] what's going on
[46:23] um
[46:23] he has a lot of influence there and he's
[46:26] just doing a wonderful work there he has
[46:28] a youth retreat he bought a campground
[46:31] he bought just raw land and they
[46:34] actually created a youth camp there and
[46:37] I think they can host up to a thousand
[46:38] people
[46:40] um and I think this year this year
[46:42] they're going to have or is it next year
[46:44] they're going to have an international
[46:45] youth
[46:46] convention
[46:48] so if anybody is interested in an
[46:50] international youth convention in
[46:52] Philippines it's going to be there it's
[46:54] going to be a tremendous time I know
[46:56] he's had a few youth conventions so far
[46:58] and there's a lot of people that go to
[47:01] it but it's just tremendous to see when
[47:04] someone has a burden and they put their
[47:06] shoulder to the wheel and put it before
[47:07] the body of Believers and just see what
[47:10] the Lord will do you know
[47:11] so
[47:13] um October the 31st we have a gym night
[47:15] coming up so while the rest of the world
[47:16] goes and celebrates the Halloween spirit
[47:19] we'll get together with the Believers
[47:21] and just maybe have a little bit of
[47:22] steam blowing off or play some sports
[47:24] and just hang out with brothers and
[47:26] sisters for those who can come and for
[47:28] those who can't God bless you there's no
[47:30] pressure
[47:32] getting into our scripture today I just
[47:34] thought it was so wonderful on Wednesday
[47:36] I think the Lord did something real
[47:38] special for us I
[47:41] I learned something myself that I had
[47:42] never really seen before I had known it
[47:45] from a different perspective you know we
[47:47] can be having justification in our lives
[47:50] and sanctification in our lives and and
[47:52] go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:53] and I have known and I'm sure every one
[47:55] of us have known that you can you know
[47:57] maybe potentially get a little bit
[47:58] slanted in one area or the other of
[48:01] those on your journey on our journey to
[48:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we can get
[48:06] stuck in you know the justification
[48:08] portion or maybe a little bit sloped
[48:11] into the sanctification you know look
[48:13] what God's done for me I'm in a position
[48:15] where everything is good in my life but
[48:18] not really understanding that we just
[48:20] maybe haven't come all the way to the
[48:22] true baptism of the Holy Ghost but we
[48:25] heard it on Wednesday and I thought it
[48:26] was uh just an amazing thought yeah
[48:29] thank you brother I always forget these
[48:32] details even though they're quite
[48:33] pertinent we have a potluck after
[48:34] service as well it's going to be in our
[48:36] house thank you brother Peter
[48:38] if you have any questions about
[48:40] directions or anything maybe just uh
[48:42] we'll talk after service about that
[48:45] but yeah talking about this uh this idea
[48:48] that you know sometimes we can have the
[48:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost and not
[48:52] realize it Satan will come around and
[48:54] try and and throw us off and and make us
[48:57] desire it when we already have it and we
[49:00] know brother Branham tells stories about
[49:01] that people they've gone to church after
[49:03] church and meeting after meeting and
[49:06] situation after situation looking for
[49:08] the pearl of great price and not
[49:11] understanding that they've had it all
[49:12] along and you know they finally get in
[49:14] front of brother Branham the prophet of
[49:15] God for the day and he says you know
[49:16] what you've had it all along
[49:18] Satan has just pulled one over on you
[49:20] and and what a tremendous thought can
[49:23] you imagine the Liberty that would come
[49:25] from that
[49:26] or or on the other hand to to think that
[49:28] maybe you you you haven't got it and and
[49:32] you you're struggling to get it you
[49:34] really want to get to that place because
[49:35] you just don't have it
[49:37] I think that either way the Lord can
[49:40] bless us and he will bless us with the
[49:43] right desire in our heart
[49:44] it's so wonderful because it's not even
[49:48] something that we desire on our own
[49:50] naturally
[49:51] humanly speaking we know that there's a
[49:54] very small percentage of people who will
[49:56] actually be able to go on to the true
[49:58] baptism of the Holy Spirit there's many
[50:01] people that would contest that to say
[50:02] well I've got the trinitarian doctrine
[50:04] and you know look at the millions and
[50:06] billions of people out there but we had
[50:08] a prophet of God in our age that said
[50:09] there will be millions and billions of
[50:11] impersonators of a Christianity in this
[50:13] world and it's very tough words I know
[50:16] it is but you know what we're here in in
[50:18] this assembly because we believe the
[50:20] word that was given to us by a seventh
[50:23] angel messenger by the messenger William
[50:25] Miriam Branham we're not here because we
[50:27] we necessarily have a social click and
[50:30] and we really want to socialize with one
[50:32] another and we find that there's a whole
[50:34] lot of things in common in our lives
[50:36] that's not why we gather here even
[50:38] though when we do start to fellowship
[50:40] with one another we realize that we do
[50:42] have a lot more in common than maybe we
[50:44] would realize but Naturally Speaking we
[50:46] probably wouldn't just go and and hang
[50:48] out with one another in this world
[50:49] sometimes it's really good to just zoom
[50:52] out and think about that to have those
[50:53] discussions because there's one thing
[50:55] that is in common that's very much in
[50:57] common and it's the same thing as the
[50:59] book of Acts it is the true word for our
[51:02] day and some people might say well you
[51:04] know what there's there's another word
[51:06] and and that word is the word of God and
[51:08] it truly is but unless the Mysteries
[51:10] that were contained in this word of God
[51:12] are revealed then where are we
[51:15] and you know what we have the ability to
[51:17] see those Mysteries unraveled and and it
[51:19] really is the the beauty of the message
[51:21] of the hour We're Not groping in
[51:23] darkness we're not looking for certain
[51:25] scriptures to be fulfilled we recognize
[51:28] that many of these scriptures have
[51:29] already been fulfilled we talked about
[51:31] it even Snoopy the cartoon Snoopy uh uh
[51:35] Schultz is his name the the artist he
[51:38] did a cartoon of Snoopy and and the last
[51:42] words in it um I can't remember what it
[51:44] was about but I remember Snoopy saying
[51:46] wasn't Elias supposed to come first and
[51:50] then we know that there's going to be a
[51:51] group of people in this world that are
[51:53] going to say the very same thing but
[51:54] wasn't wasn't this supposed to happen
[51:56] first and and wasn't that supposed to
[51:58] happen first and not recognizing that
[52:00] it's already happened just like in Jesus
[52:02] day they said isn't Elias supposed to
[52:04] come first and he said you know what
[52:05] he's already come and they've already
[52:07] done to them whatever they've listed
[52:09] whatever they desired and they didn't
[52:10] recognize it initially that he was
[52:12] speaking about John the Baptist but then
[52:14] a revelation from Heaven came to them
[52:16] into their heart and they recognized
[52:17] wait a second he's actually speaking
[52:19] about John the Baptist when he said
[52:21] Elias
[52:22] huh so anyways I I don't want to go too
[52:26] far with that this this morning but I
[52:29] just think it's wonderful we have been
[52:30] given all of the Mysteries it's it's the
[52:32] Mysteries are histories now and and if
[52:34] we don't know them then we will
[52:37] certainly work on trying to help one
[52:38] another just understand the word of God
[52:41] for our day but today I want to talk
[52:43] about this scripture and I want to go
[52:45] into a little bit more detail uh with
[52:47] this scripture here in Ezekiel
[52:50] understanding that God speaking here he
[52:53] says you know therefore say thus saith
[52:58] the Lord God isn't that beautiful
[53:01] just those words thus saith the Lord God
[53:03] he is speaking he's making a prophetic
[53:06] utterance through man
[53:09] to his people
[53:11] and I just can't help but think we've
[53:12] had that in our day how many times have
[53:14] we heard thus saith the Lord so many
[53:16] times in the message of the hour thus
[53:19] therefore say thus saith the Lord God I
[53:22] will even gather you from the people and
[53:25] assemble you out of the countries where
[53:27] ye have been scattered and I will give
[53:30] you the land of Israel
[53:32] this morning I want to talk about this
[53:34] and say you know we understand that this
[53:37] scripture is speaking very specifically
[53:38] about the the Jews about the Hebrews
[53:41] about the real tribes of Israel
[53:44] but we know that every single scripture
[53:46] has a compound Revelation and a compound
[53:48] meaning and the promised land that we're
[53:51] talking about as Gentiles is the holy
[53:53] spirit that's what we're talking about
[53:55] so when we hear the land of Israel I
[53:58] want to highlight this underline it bold
[54:01] it exclamation mark it this morning for
[54:04] us that he's saying that he will take
[54:06] his children he will pull them out of
[54:08] the lands that he has scattered and he
[54:10] will bring them into a new land where
[54:12] they will be safe and that new land is
[54:14] in him in Christ it's not going to be
[54:18] some destination somewhere in the world
[54:20] it's going to be in the ability to
[54:22] believe all of the word for your day
[54:25] because outside of that
[54:27] is an anointing of the Holy Ghost it's
[54:29] not the indwelling of the Holy Ghost
[54:31] it's not the person of Jesus Christ
[54:36] remember once a little while ago we
[54:39] talked about the the story I guess it
[54:41] was Easter
[54:42] we talked about the story of Jesus
[54:45] and how he was an offense to the
[54:47] Pharisees
[54:49] they hated him
[54:51] because he knew the word better than
[54:53] they did
[54:54] but he wasn't educated
[54:56] and they knew his parents they knew his
[54:58] lineage they said oh he's just he's just
[55:01] the son of Mary and Joseph in fact you
[55:03] know he's actually a fatherless child
[55:06] if you follow what they say
[55:09] how how on Earth could this man be the
[55:12] one the one that's the Messiah that
[55:14] these people are claiming it we know
[55:16] that he was an offense to them
[55:19] but here we go we have him invited to
[55:22] this religious man's house he's relaxed
[55:25] invited to come to a feast at Simon's
[55:27] house remember
[55:29] and there he is he's invited to it and I
[55:32] just can't help but think how many
[55:33] Christian churches how many Gentile
[55:35] churches in the world today invite Jesus
[55:38] to their meetings
[55:40] in Jesus name come to the meetings in
[55:43] the blood of Jesus Christ come to the
[55:45] meetings oh my but when you start to
[55:47] talk about thus saith the Lord oh you're
[55:49] going too far there can't be any more
[55:51] thus saith the Lord what does it say in
[55:53] the Bible there can't be any more of
[55:54] thus saith the Lord
[55:56] doesn't say it
[55:59] but outside of the revealed word for
[56:02] your day just like every single age in
[56:04] the Bible
[56:06] are you really appreciating him when you
[56:09] invite him because he always comes where
[56:10] he's invited
[56:12] but unless you're willing to come
[56:14] according to his word you invite him to
[56:16] the meeting but then you ignore him
[56:18] because you don't want to go that far
[56:19] you can't do that no way I won't do that
[56:21] because we've gone to to our our
[56:23] theological studies and we've been shown
[56:25] that it's a trinitarian doctrine that
[56:27] there's three persons in the Trinity
[56:30] which it doesn't even make sense
[56:31] according to the English language but we
[56:33] you know we can go the wrong way a long
[56:36] way the wrong way with it and think that
[56:39] we're right
[56:40] and I want to say Lord help us
[56:43] because we don't want to be the ones
[56:44] that are saying that everyone else is
[56:46] wrong and we're right
[56:48] we want to say hey Lord I want to line
[56:51] up with your word
[56:52] just let your word be my yardstick let
[56:55] your word be my measuring stick let me
[56:57] light up with your word and at the end
[56:59] of this life when I have to stand before
[57:01] you I'll say Lord I just took you by
[57:03] your word I wasn't willing to take you
[57:05] by some man's tradition or maybe some
[57:07] other person's Grudge or some other
[57:09] things issue I simply took you at your
[57:12] word
[57:16] I want to speak exclusively today out of
[57:19] what does it take to make a Christian
[57:21] Life
[57:22] in 1957
[57:25] what does it take to make a Christian
[57:27] Life
[57:30] paragraph 12 brother Bradham says but in
[57:33] the word I find
[57:35] that God did not intend for the church
[57:36] to be governed by intellectual or by any
[57:40] Theology of man
[57:43] but the Holy Spirit was given to the
[57:45] church
[57:46] to govern and control the body of Christ
[57:51] I think it's so beautiful when we can
[57:52] look at that because that's truly what
[57:54] we believe that is the truth that is
[57:57] what the the Gentile Church according to
[57:59] the message of the hour is built upon
[58:01] and and The Business of thinking that we
[58:03] need to run it any other way is man's
[58:06] idea and I'll tell you what I'll go
[58:08] further than that and simply say it's
[58:10] Satan getting in the church it's that
[58:11] lukewarm Doctrine getting in the doors
[58:13] of the church within the framework of
[58:15] the Christian Church getting in there
[58:17] and trying to mingle it and say well you
[58:19] know what that Pastor one time he did
[58:21] that and it caused all of this and and
[58:23] now I can't just go that far anymore
[58:25] because of that Pastor that one time
[58:26] God's not going to say because of that
[58:28] Pastor one time it was okay for you
[58:30] here's a pass you don't have to believe
[58:32] my word and follow every letter of it
[58:34] he's going to say why didn't you follow
[58:35] my word what does that Pastor got to do
[58:37] with that what does that have to do with
[58:39] you follow thou me is what he'll say
[58:43] but he's intended for the Holy Ghost to
[58:46] govern the church so when we see someone
[58:48] wanting to try and run the church like a
[58:50] business try and run the church with
[58:52] control over every single area of the
[58:56] church control control who's running the
[58:59] church
[59:01] there's got to be room for the Holy
[59:02] Ghost
[59:03] there's got to be room for Christ to run
[59:05] the church and sometimes it can look
[59:07] like wait a second maybe it's a little
[59:09] bit out of control maybe the pastor
[59:11] should just be jumping on that situation
[59:12] and acting on that situation maybe the
[59:14] pastor is the right way
[59:16] spiritually
[59:18] because of the pastor goes and jumps on
[59:20] a situation sometimes maybe he'll get in
[59:21] the flesh and maybe he'll say things
[59:23] that he can't take back maybe he'll make
[59:25] the situation worse and and it's like
[59:27] that as human beings if we go and try
[59:29] and do that we're going to make it worse
[59:31] we're not going to make it better
[59:33] but he says it's not designed to be
[59:35] governed by intellectual or by Theology
[59:39] of man but the Holy Spirit was given to
[59:42] the church to govern and control the
[59:44] body of Christ
[59:46] I love how he says that because that
[59:48] means everyone right
[59:50] it's the body
[59:52] it's not the church it's not just the
[59:54] pastor it's not just the deacons it's
[59:56] the body it's everyone together
[59:59] and I think in doing that excuse me with
[1:00:03] that in mind
[1:00:05] and in God's program we will never be
[1:00:08] successfully no matter how good our
[1:00:10] intentions are
[1:00:12] until we get back to the center of God's
[1:00:15] program
[1:00:16] and and where the Holy Spirit
[1:00:19] that's where I left off too I was
[1:00:21] wondering what he said there but just
[1:00:23] get back to the center of God's program
[1:00:24] just get the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:00:26] brothers and sisters and and everything
[1:00:27] will actually change but I just think
[1:00:30] it's it's amazing because there can be a
[1:00:33] time in our lives going back to this
[1:00:35] point I'm going to keep driving this
[1:00:37] home and some people might get upset
[1:00:38] with me but just bear with me I just
[1:00:40] believe the Lord wants something said
[1:00:42] here there can be a place where we think
[1:00:44] we've got the Holy Ghost and we don't
[1:00:46] quite have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:00:48] yet we just maybe haven't gone all the
[1:00:50] way we can have a new spirit we've read
[1:00:52] it we'll read it again today we can have
[1:00:54] a new spirit he'll take our spirit and
[1:00:56] and give us a new spirit he'll reform
[1:00:59] our spirit he'll make us a new creature
[1:01:01] in Christ Jesus
[1:01:04] but we might not have gone all the way
[1:01:05] to get the Holy Ghost
[1:01:07] now there's a few markers in here that
[1:01:09] we'll get into today I think that will
[1:01:10] give us the identification on whether we
[1:01:12] truly have gone that far or not and I
[1:01:14] want to say it the word of God that we
[1:01:16] read today and and I will give them one
[1:01:19] heart and I will put a new spirit within
[1:01:21] you and I will take out the Stony heart
[1:01:24] of their flesh and I will give them a
[1:01:26] heart of Flesh I believe he's saying
[1:01:28] that I will give you my heart my literal
[1:01:30] heart will beat in you
[1:01:35] now maybe that's crazy because how can
[1:01:37] his literal heart beat in US
[1:01:39] I don't know
[1:01:41] we'll just take it with his word and say
[1:01:42] that's what his word says he's going to
[1:01:45] take out our heart of Flesh and put in a
[1:01:47] heart of Flesh why would he do that
[1:01:50] why wouldn't he give us just a different
[1:01:52] heart that's a spiritual heart probably
[1:01:54] because we still need to live in this
[1:01:55] world I would say we still have to live
[1:01:58] in this world but not be of this world
[1:02:00] there's a new spirit that lives inside
[1:02:02] of us and this this new spirit that he
[1:02:05] gives us gives us the ability to get
[1:02:07] along with his spirit
[1:02:10] I think it's so beautiful Lord help me I
[1:02:13] want to get along with this spirit I
[1:02:14] don't want to get stuck in a position
[1:02:16] where I think that I'm saved where I
[1:02:18] think that I've got the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:19] find out one day that you know what
[1:02:21] somebody did give me the keys to their
[1:02:23] Cadillac and now I've got a new Cadillac
[1:02:25] but the church has gone on
[1:02:28] you know that story brother Branham
[1:02:30] talks about
[1:02:32] for someone laughed and they gave them
[1:02:34] the set of keys for their Cadillac and
[1:02:35] said you know I won't need these because
[1:02:37] the Rapture is going to happen
[1:02:39] I don't want to be that Pastor is what
[1:02:41] I'm saying to you
[1:02:43] I don't want to get stuck with a pet
[1:02:44] Doctrine
[1:02:46] thinking that I've got my angle I've got
[1:02:48] my way I've got my thing and I know that
[1:02:49] I'm right about this I want to be humble
[1:02:52] before my brothers and sisters and say
[1:02:54] let's let's come together according to
[1:02:55] the word of God and reason one another
[1:02:57] according to the word of God let's not
[1:02:59] have a pet Doctrine and say that I'm
[1:03:01] just going to hold this with all my
[1:03:02] might
[1:03:04] if there's going to be a pet Doctrine
[1:03:05] let's let's go this way I would say I
[1:03:07] want mine to be behold I I show you a
[1:03:10] mystery that that not all of us shall
[1:03:12] sleep but we shall be changed in the
[1:03:14] moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:03:16] something's gonna happen one of these
[1:03:18] days we're not going to be stuck to this
[1:03:20] world and our our pet doctrines and our
[1:03:22] thoughts about what we think should be
[1:03:24] happening
[1:03:25] in this message brother Branham just for
[1:03:27] the sake of time I'll just cover a few
[1:03:29] things here he talks about you know new
[1:03:31] wine in an old bottle
[1:03:33] and I had you know maybe another thing
[1:03:35] I've heard him say it before but I've
[1:03:37] never really studied it and looked at it
[1:03:39] this way he talks about how the new wine
[1:03:41] is actually placed in animal skins and
[1:03:44] that's what they're referring to in the
[1:03:46] Bible when they say new bottle
[1:03:49] and I had always thought the bottle was
[1:03:51] something glass maybe ceramic Pottery
[1:03:53] something from the desert you know hard
[1:03:56] no he talks about it being an animal
[1:03:58] skin and an animal skin when it's
[1:04:00] skinned out and it's it's treated and
[1:04:02] it's fresh it gets stitched together and
[1:04:04] it can hold a liquid it can hold a wine
[1:04:07] and and specifically the wine is the the
[1:04:11] stimulation of the Revelation right
[1:04:14] brother Brown talks about that in the
[1:04:15] seals very specifically but the wine
[1:04:17] itself he says needs to be in a skin
[1:04:19] because it actually ferments it's still
[1:04:22] fermenting and back in those days that's
[1:04:24] how they did it and the reason for that
[1:04:25] when it ferments it can stretch it can
[1:04:28] grow and it can allow the wine to mature
[1:04:31] to come to the place where it's it's
[1:04:33] done growing and now it's mature and
[1:04:35] it's good wine now uh don't ask me why I
[1:04:38] would say that but I I just know that
[1:04:40] wine gets better with age that's what we
[1:04:42] hear about I guess but you know that's
[1:04:44] what that's what they did then and and
[1:04:45] brother Branham talks about how the
[1:04:47] Skins the animal skins the reason they
[1:04:49] could actually do it when they're fresh
[1:04:51] is they contain oils the oils in the
[1:04:54] flesh in the skin gives them the the
[1:04:56] ability to elasticize to stretch to have
[1:04:59] flexibility and if you've ever dealt
[1:05:01] with leather you would know what I'm
[1:05:02] talking about but but brother Branham
[1:05:04] says as long as they're wet and they're
[1:05:06] moist they won't leak
[1:05:09] but sometimes they get dry
[1:05:11] sometimes they get emptied out
[1:05:14] and you know the reason why the the wise
[1:05:16] virgin went in into the marriage supper
[1:05:19] and that door got closed and the unwise
[1:05:21] Virgin that was with the wise virgin
[1:05:23] they both had lamps they both had oil
[1:05:25] one had more oil than the other
[1:05:28] one had enough oil to trim their laps
[1:05:31] and actually make it burn bright and
[1:05:32] clear and the other one just didn't have
[1:05:34] enough oil they had oil but they just
[1:05:36] didn't have enough oil
[1:05:41] sometimes we can let our oil run out
[1:05:45] the reason why we come to church
[1:05:47] we need oil
[1:05:49] and you know what the oil typifies in
[1:05:52] the Bible is the Holy Ghost
[1:05:55] it's the Holy Spirit and we know the
[1:05:57] wine is the stimulation of the
[1:06:00] Revelation and we know that it says in
[1:06:02] Revelation you know I believe it's in
[1:06:04] six uh a measure of wheat for a penny
[1:06:06] and a measure of barley for a penny see
[1:06:08] thou hurt not the oil or the wine
[1:06:10] there's coming a time where there's
[1:06:11] going to be a spiritual famine in the
[1:06:13] earth and I don't know if there's ever
[1:06:15] been a time like there is now where we
[1:06:17] look around everywhere and we just see
[1:06:19] evil everywhere continually in the in
[1:06:21] the hearts of men in the thoughts of men
[1:06:23] mankind it's just evil the the world is
[1:06:26] turning evil there's nothing that we can
[1:06:27] do about it except for look up and
[1:06:29] praise God because we know that he's
[1:06:31] called us by name but the reason we come
[1:06:33] to church is we know that we can get a
[1:06:35] topping up of oil and if we don't come
[1:06:38] to church how can we do that brothers
[1:06:39] and sisters we know that the word of God
[1:06:42] says that the the five-fold ministry is
[1:06:44] given for a reason and that's for the
[1:06:46] perfecting of the Saints but I'll just
[1:06:49] say it the way that we're talking this
[1:06:50] morning in that slant in that vein and
[1:06:52] that's to top up our oil
[1:06:54] so we can come and and fellowship we can
[1:06:57] come and worship God pour ourselves out
[1:06:59] as a as a free will offering unto him
[1:07:01] the first beginning part of the service
[1:07:03] not caring about anybody else just
[1:07:06] worshiping God and telling him thank you
[1:07:08] Lord for saving me thank you Lord for
[1:07:10] giving me the Holy Ghost thank you for
[1:07:12] saving my children thank you for giving
[1:07:15] me a healthy marriage thank you for
[1:07:16] giving me all that you've given me if
[1:07:18] you've got breath in our lungs Lord
[1:07:20] anything in my life that's good all good
[1:07:22] things come from above thank you Lord we
[1:07:25] can take the time to worship Him and
[1:07:27] thank him and then allow him to come
[1:07:29] forward with the word from the ministry
[1:07:32] no matter who it is it could be a donkey
[1:07:34] up here and some people might think that
[1:07:35] this is one but it doesn't matter if you
[1:07:37] have the right heart God will talk to
[1:07:39] you
[1:07:41] God will speak to you
[1:07:43] but that's the reason we come so that we
[1:07:46] can get topped up with that Holy Ghost
[1:07:49] and you know brothers and sisters to try
[1:07:51] and do it any other way is outside of
[1:07:52] his word the blessing isn't there
[1:07:55] Satan's gonna come around and say oh
[1:07:57] sure it is sure it is you can get
[1:07:59] blessed no problem you can Heap to
[1:08:00] yourselves teachers having itchy ears
[1:08:02] and you'll get just whatever you need
[1:08:04] sure enough you might
[1:08:06] but it might not be according to God's
[1:08:07] word
[1:08:10] the animal skins they contained oil and
[1:08:12] as long as they're wet and they're moist
[1:08:15] with the oil they won't leak especially
[1:08:17] when that wine gets put in them when
[1:08:19] that wine gets poured in on a new bottle
[1:08:22] what happens is it's pliable and elastic
[1:08:25] and it can stretch and it swells up as
[1:08:27] it absorbs that line and all the
[1:08:29] stitching holes they swell up around the
[1:08:31] threads and everything just becomes
[1:08:32] tight and when it starts to ferment it
[1:08:34] just blows up a little bit like a
[1:08:36] balloon and I just can't help but think
[1:08:38] when they would open a new bottle of
[1:08:40] wine how it might just have a little
[1:08:42] when they open the cap just like a maybe
[1:08:44] a pup it would just let out a puff of of
[1:08:46] energy of air from the pressure that was
[1:08:49] inside of it and they could enjoy that
[1:08:51] wine they could they could be stimulated
[1:08:53] with that wine but you know what happens
[1:08:55] is when that skin starts to get a little
[1:08:57] bit dry
[1:08:59] the threads actually they can actually
[1:09:02] leak where the threads go through the
[1:09:05] the leather the leather starts to to
[1:09:07] actually shrink and when it shrinks it
[1:09:10] will crack and and that wine will
[1:09:13] actually leak out so I can only imagine
[1:09:14] they they consumed it fairly quickly
[1:09:17] they didn't just leave it open like that
[1:09:19] but once that skin was emptied out
[1:09:22] you can't pour wine in that in that skin
[1:09:24] because it's all dry and it's all
[1:09:26] cracked and as soon as you pour new wine
[1:09:29] into the old bottle we know this
[1:09:31] scripture if you can't pour new wine
[1:09:33] into an old bottle because the bottle
[1:09:35] will break
[1:09:36] when you put the lid on it you can pour
[1:09:37] the wine in it no problem and it might
[1:09:39] not even leak out but as soon as that
[1:09:41] wine starts to grow and ferment and
[1:09:43] expand what will happen is it will crack
[1:09:44] what the brown talks about in this
[1:09:46] message here and you know I just can't
[1:09:48] help but think he wasn't just talking
[1:09:50] about wine bottles he wasn't just
[1:09:52] talking about wine skins he was talking
[1:09:54] about human beings he was talking about
[1:09:56] those people that would either choose to
[1:09:59] get filled continuously with the
[1:10:01] stimulation of Revelation or actually
[1:10:03] dry out a little bit and then they just
[1:10:05] can't contain it anymore because that
[1:10:07] Revelation is just too much
[1:10:15] the wine needs room to expand
[1:10:18] when it ferments
[1:10:21] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:10:23] Life
[1:10:25] the Branham goes on to say God's Eternal
[1:10:27] Plan of Salvation for his people
[1:10:31] is the holy spirit in the church
[1:10:34] Born Again men and women
[1:10:37] operated by the Holy Spirit
[1:10:41] not them trying to operate the Holy
[1:10:43] Spirit
[1:10:45] but the Holy Spirit operating them
[1:10:47] do you see it
[1:10:51] The Madam talks about it in one of the
[1:10:53] messages I don't know if I have it in
[1:10:54] front of me
[1:10:56] where we can pray for someone and expect
[1:10:58] God to come on the scene to deal with
[1:11:01] that someone maybe they're sick
[1:11:03] and if he doesn't heal them the way that
[1:11:05] we think that he should heal them
[1:11:07] then is he God
[1:11:09] have we done something wrong
[1:11:11] he has a will
[1:11:13] and his will is going to come to pass
[1:11:15] and that's what the believer's life says
[1:11:17] that's that's where we are in in our
[1:11:20] day-to-day we can't just wave our little
[1:11:22] wand and say that we just need to see
[1:11:24] the Holy Spirit Come on the scene and
[1:11:25] now he's just going to come on the scene
[1:11:26] God don't clown for nobody
[1:11:29] I talked about this a while ago and
[1:11:30] forgive me for the comparison but I
[1:11:32] think it's important we live in a real
[1:11:33] world
[1:11:34] I saw
[1:11:36] it was it was a silly game show but I
[1:11:38] was on the floor with it I could not
[1:11:40] believe it
[1:11:41] this one woman came to the end round of
[1:11:44] this game show
[1:11:46] and one I wasn't watching a whole game
[1:11:48] show just for the record it was just
[1:11:50] just this one part that popped up and I
[1:11:52] was like what is this
[1:11:54] and uh
[1:11:55] when I was a kid this game show was on
[1:11:57] that's what caught my attention but
[1:11:59] this woman comes to the the final round
[1:12:02] where she gets to win big or whatever it
[1:12:04] is
[1:12:05] and and she's just about to start he
[1:12:07] says the host says are you ready to
[1:12:09] start and and everyone's excited and it
[1:12:11] gets a little bit quiet and are you
[1:12:13] ready to start and she's like oh wait
[1:12:14] wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:12:16] and what she did was literally this just
[1:12:18] wait one second Holy Spirit activate
[1:12:21] Holy Spirit she started doing this chant
[1:12:25] Holy Spirit activate on a game show I
[1:12:28] was like are you kidding me right now
[1:12:30] you're belittling Jesus Christ the Holy
[1:12:33] Ghost himself to a stupid game show is
[1:12:36] that what the Christian world has come
[1:12:38] to
[1:12:40] just wave your little wand and we'll see
[1:12:42] Jesus Christ come on the scene right no
[1:12:46] no get in line with his word get in line
[1:12:49] with his word and he wouldn't even be
[1:12:50] there on that stupid game show right
[1:12:52] get lying to his word and you wouldn't
[1:12:53] even be watching a stupid clip like that
[1:12:56] I'll take it
[1:12:59] you know what we need is the ABCs
[1:13:01] that's what we need in our lives the
[1:13:03] ABCs
[1:13:04] if we can get the ABCs straight in our
[1:13:06] lives brothers and sisters a lot of the
[1:13:08] problems won't even be problems we won't
[1:13:10] have the issues that we have but Satan
[1:13:12] gets in our way and throws these things
[1:13:14] they're distractions they're not
[1:13:17] necessarily sinful things but they're
[1:13:19] distractions we know that Paul said that
[1:13:22] all things are lawful but they're not
[1:13:24] all expedient
[1:13:25] they're not all going to help you
[1:13:28] and we can look at it now and say yeah
[1:13:30] you want to go and buy some pot it's
[1:13:31] legal you can go and buy some weed if
[1:13:34] you want it I'm sorry maybe I'm a little
[1:13:37] bit too bold from the pulpit but I'm
[1:13:38] just freaking real
[1:13:40] we live in a real world
[1:13:42] Once Upon a Time you could not buy
[1:13:44] alcohol but you can go and buy alcohol
[1:13:46] for decades now
[1:13:49] if we can get the ABCs right brothers
[1:13:51] and sisters
[1:13:52] just forget about the things that were
[1:13:53] in the past
[1:13:54] that's what Paul said forgetting the
[1:13:56] things that were in the past I press
[1:13:58] towards the mark for the prize of a high
[1:14:00] calling of God in Christ Jesus I'm not
[1:14:03] interested in in carrying somebody
[1:14:04] else's Grudge around
[1:14:07] I'm not interested in worrying about
[1:14:09] somebody else's problems I don't want to
[1:14:11] jump on somebody else's war wagon about
[1:14:13] their church and and how something
[1:14:15] should be a certain way and forget about
[1:14:18] it
[1:14:19] Look Away to Jesus
[1:14:22] if we can do that brothers and sisters
[1:14:24] it'll change our lives
[1:14:28] and you know the other thing we talked
[1:14:30] about I think it's so good
[1:14:32] because the Lord came and checked me
[1:14:34] with it
[1:14:38] are we are we forgetting are we choosing
[1:14:40] to forget
[1:14:42] are we choosing to forgive
[1:14:44] are we truly forgiving
[1:14:46] when situations happen in our lives
[1:14:49] or do we just keep that thing right
[1:14:50] there just in in you know a convenient
[1:14:52] pocket it's right there I forgive you
[1:14:54] but I'm just going to tuck that away and
[1:14:56] not look at it and you know you're
[1:14:58] forgiven it's cool
[1:15:00] we're talking about this
[1:15:03] but I haven't forgot it and you know
[1:15:04] what if you want to you can look up
[1:15:06] quotes to say brother Branham says you
[1:15:07] can forgive but you can't forget you can
[1:15:10] get that quote and you can put it up and
[1:15:11] you can put that in your pocket with it
[1:15:12] too
[1:15:13] and keep it there and use it
[1:15:16] and it's true
[1:15:17] right
[1:15:19] but have you truly forgiven if you're
[1:15:22] not willing to choose to forget
[1:15:24] I can promise you
[1:15:26] you can forget
[1:15:28] Satan will come around and try and
[1:15:30] remind you
[1:15:31] he'll come around and say oh no but
[1:15:33] don't you remember and you say yeah I
[1:15:34] remember but I choose to forget that
[1:15:37] because that's just gonna trip me up I'm
[1:15:39] going to think about that for the next
[1:15:40] 24 48 72 hours maybe a week maybe a
[1:15:45] month maybe a year I'll stew on that and
[1:15:47] and it'll me spiritually
[1:15:50] but when we choose to forget something
[1:15:53] Supernatural happens brothers and
[1:15:54] sisters
[1:15:56] that's pressing on towards the mark for
[1:15:58] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:15:59] Christ Jesus
[1:16:01] we want all of our sin to be thrown
[1:16:03] where
[1:16:04] into the sea of God's remembrance right
[1:16:07] no no the Sea of his forgetfulness
[1:16:09] that's where we want our sin and that's
[1:16:11] what he said he would do
[1:16:13] and unless we're willing to forgive the
[1:16:15] way he forgives
[1:16:17] where do we stand
[1:16:19] but I just want to say I think that's
[1:16:21] like ABC stuff we've got to be willing
[1:16:24] to go over this and over this and over
[1:16:26] this and cultivate it and say Amen to it
[1:16:28] I want to be able to forgive I want to
[1:16:30] be able to forget if you want to be able
[1:16:32] to forgive and you want to be able to
[1:16:33] forget you can
[1:16:36] I think we've heard it said Henry Ford
[1:16:38] said it he said it well if you think you
[1:16:40] can you can if you think you can't you
[1:16:42] won't or you can't it's your choice
[1:16:45] but we have the ability and you know if
[1:16:48] you don't understand it
[1:16:49] maybe it sounds like I'm talking rubbish
[1:16:51] just ask God
[1:16:53] what brother Barry was saying is that
[1:16:55] true can I truly forget
[1:16:58] ask him
[1:17:00] I promise you he'll show you
[1:17:04] but I just want to throw it out there if
[1:17:05] you choose
[1:17:07] to forgive
[1:17:09] but not forget
[1:17:11] have we truly forgiven
[1:17:17] I just want to say this let's worry
[1:17:18] about ourselves lining up with God's
[1:17:20] word
[1:17:22] let's just throw out the trash in our
[1:17:23] lives brothers and sisters
[1:17:25] get rid of the trash
[1:17:27] it's only going to bring us down it's
[1:17:28] only going to mix us up it's only going
[1:17:30] to frustrate us it's only going to make
[1:17:31] us angry it's only going to do all these
[1:17:34] different things and it's just
[1:17:35] distractions in our lives that's all it
[1:17:37] is like we said many things are lawful
[1:17:39] but they're not Expedia they're not
[1:17:41] going to help us so I want to say it
[1:17:43] this way the things that we do the
[1:17:45] things that we read the things that we
[1:17:46] listen to our activities are they
[1:17:49] hindering us spiritually or are they
[1:17:52] helping us spiritually because one or
[1:17:54] the other thing is happening
[1:17:56] one of the other thing is happening we
[1:17:59] know that Paul said that even physical
[1:18:01] exercise
[1:18:02] it doesn't do anything for the for the
[1:18:04] spirit it's good for the flesh
[1:18:06] profitable for the flesh but nothing for
[1:18:08] the spirit but you know what one thing
[1:18:11] that I can say for sure is if you do get
[1:18:14] physical exercise you'll have energy
[1:18:17] and you'll have the desire to get up in
[1:18:19] the morning with a little bit of vigor
[1:18:20] because you've had some exercise
[1:18:23] but what he's talking about is what is
[1:18:25] what are you what are you making it is
[1:18:26] it your absolute is it something that
[1:18:27] comes before God is it an idol anything
[1:18:30] that we put before God is an idol it's
[1:18:32] idolatry
[1:18:34] let's just throw out the trash get rid
[1:18:35] of the idolatry and just spend more time
[1:18:37] with Jesus
[1:18:40] let's get the Dynamics in our lives
[1:18:45] because really honestly it's too late to
[1:18:47] play Church
[1:18:49] it's way too late to play Church
[1:18:52] remember we were I mentioned this I
[1:18:54] think last time or sometime recently
[1:18:57] what are you going to be thinking about
[1:18:58] what are you going to be doing
[1:18:59] when that time happens
[1:19:01] where are you going to be
[1:19:03] what are we going to be doing
[1:19:04] are we going to be asleep are we going
[1:19:06] to be at work are we going to be in a
[1:19:07] service like this we're going to be on a
[1:19:09] Prayer meeting
[1:19:11] we're going to be fellowshipping
[1:19:13] or are we going to be angry
[1:19:16] are we going to be fighting
[1:19:18] we're going to be backbiting we're going
[1:19:20] to be remembering
[1:19:21] because I'm right I know according to
[1:19:24] God's word I'm right
[1:19:25] are we going to be doing that what's
[1:19:27] going to happen we know that Jesus said
[1:19:28] am I going to find faith when I come
[1:19:30] back will I find faith in the earth when
[1:19:31] I come back and and I believe by the
[1:19:34] scripture that we've read in Ezekiel
[1:19:35] thus saith the Lord I'll pull you out of
[1:19:37] all of those Lambs all around the world
[1:19:39] and I'll bring you into your own land
[1:19:40] I'll bring you into the place where you
[1:19:42] will have the Holy Ghost you know what
[1:19:44] as a son and daughter of God whether you
[1:19:46] like it or not you're coming because he
[1:19:48] can't lose one part of his own and you
[1:19:51] know what brothers and sisters that
[1:19:52] doesn't make Grace a disgrace what it
[1:19:54] means is that those people who are
[1:19:56] actually misbehaviors around the word of
[1:19:59] God they'll get a spanking and they'll
[1:20:02] get in line and they'll all come
[1:20:05] we'll all come
[1:20:07] but the random in this message he talks
[1:20:09] about an old old Forest he talks about
[1:20:12] being out in the Northern British
[1:20:13] Columbia and I'm just going to tell the
[1:20:15] story briefly I don't have it as a quote
[1:20:16] here but he just tells the story about
[1:20:19] being out on a horse and he's he's
[1:20:21] hunting and he has his camera with him
[1:20:23] and I guess he wants to take a picture
[1:20:25] of a bear he's on the trail of a grizzly
[1:20:27] bear and he really wants to get a
[1:20:28] picture of the grizzly bear and the
[1:20:29] grizzly bear just doesn't want to give
[1:20:30] him a picture and he says he's on a
[1:20:32] horse that just wants to Buck the
[1:20:33] preacher a three-year-old horse a three
[1:20:35] or four-year-old horse that just wants
[1:20:37] to throw him off but he talks about this
[1:20:38] and excuse me how he goes off on his own
[1:20:40] and he does this from his Hunting Party
[1:20:42] and finds himself late in the day and he
[1:20:45] decides he better try and find his way
[1:20:47] back and how important sometimes it is
[1:20:49] to be able to find our way back we need
[1:20:51] to know what direction we have to go
[1:20:54] and he said you can talk about different
[1:20:56] ways to to find your orientation but he
[1:20:58] finds his bearing in the woods anyways
[1:21:00] and on this horse he winds up going the
[1:21:02] right way and gets to a place where he's
[1:21:04] just cresting a hill a mountain a pass
[1:21:06] maybe and and looking over the hill he
[1:21:08] can see the moon coming up and and he
[1:21:10] can see the forest down below and he
[1:21:12] says it's all Burnt Over Forest uh giant
[1:21:15] trees that had a forest fire sweep
[1:21:17] through and and take off all the limbs
[1:21:19] and now it's just stuck with all these
[1:21:20] trees giant trees with no limbs and he
[1:21:23] said well I was there I just you know
[1:21:25] you can imagine what it's like to be
[1:21:27] there in certain situations and I'm sure
[1:21:29] we all go through it to some extent
[1:21:30] where we say Lord why are we here and
[1:21:32] brother Brown says it in that message
[1:21:34] why am I here what what do you want me
[1:21:36] to see from this situation Lord and and
[1:21:39] he says you know while I was having that
[1:21:41] conversation with the Lord I heard this
[1:21:43] sound and it was the wind blowing I
[1:21:45] realized it was the wind blowing but it
[1:21:46] was kind of a spooky sound because it
[1:21:48] wasn't like a normal Forest
[1:21:50] and what he said was it was the wind
[1:21:52] blowing through all of the dead trees
[1:21:55] that wind was just blowing up the valley
[1:21:57] through those dead trees and it didn't
[1:21:59] make the sound that a normal wind
[1:22:01] blowing through a forest makes
[1:22:03] where it's a live Forest
[1:22:06] and he goes on to talk about how the the
[1:22:08] trees that are dead they they they they
[1:22:10] had the fire blow through they had the
[1:22:13] wind blow through but they just couldn't
[1:22:14] withstand it once upon a time it was a
[1:22:17] vibrant forest with with branches and
[1:22:19] bows and leaves and and twigs maybe and
[1:22:22] and as the wind blew through it would
[1:22:24] all move together and and he talks about
[1:22:27] it as trees giving praise unto God and
[1:22:29] rejoicing having a Revival in the forest
[1:22:32] and it's not easy or it's not difficult
[1:22:34] to actually do the comparison because we
[1:22:36] know in the Garden of Eden human beings
[1:22:38] men were listed as trees trees were
[1:22:41] referenced as people in the Garden of
[1:22:43] Eden we could get into that study later
[1:22:44] sometime but here we have the prophet of
[1:22:46] God having this this time where he's
[1:22:48] talking about it's not a vision he's
[1:22:50] just experiencing this the moon and and
[1:22:52] the Darkness coming on the wind blowing
[1:22:54] through and he says it was a spooky
[1:22:55] sound as the wind blew through that
[1:22:57] forest and then he says he can't help
[1:23:00] but think it's kind of like human beings
[1:23:03] when they get burnt over they have a
[1:23:05] Revival in their life but it's a flash
[1:23:07] in the pan
[1:23:08] and suddenly the trees are burnt over
[1:23:10] and the the sound of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:12] blowing through the room causes a spooky
[1:23:15] sound because they're just stationary
[1:23:17] trees they can't move with the moving of
[1:23:20] the spirit they're too starchy in their
[1:23:23] ways
[1:23:25] he said it's a spooky sound
[1:23:28] don't let it be a spooky sound in your
[1:23:30] lives brothers and sisters let it move
[1:23:33] the bows let it let it go don't worry
[1:23:35] about what other people are thinking or
[1:23:37] or whatever it is that holds us back
[1:23:39] when the spirit of God wants to move say
[1:23:42] Amen Shout to the Lord Rejoice give him
[1:23:45] the glory
[1:23:48] because if we don't I believe he says
[1:23:50] we'll wind up like those trees
[1:23:52] where the wind will blow through and
[1:23:54] we'll just make a spooky sound
[1:23:56] boy I don't want to be one of those
[1:23:58] people
[1:23:59] I want to be free to move I want to see
[1:24:02] the Holy Spirit move in our midst I want
[1:24:05] to see our lives be flexible brother
[1:24:06] Adam tells the other story about how the
[1:24:08] trees when the wind blows what happens
[1:24:10] is the bows and the trees stretch and
[1:24:12] they move back and forth and what it
[1:24:16] does is it looks like they'll snap but
[1:24:17] they don't snap what it is is they're
[1:24:19] just stretching the holes for their
[1:24:21] roots to grow deeper and deeper and
[1:24:24] deeper and the more they Bend and bow
[1:24:26] the more their Roots grow down we have
[1:24:29] the ability to do that every single time
[1:24:31] we gather brothers and sisters every
[1:24:33] single struggle and trial in our lives
[1:24:35] is for a purpose it's to drive the roots
[1:24:37] deeper it's not to destroy us and blow
[1:24:40] us over but you know what if we don't
[1:24:42] give Glory when we should when we have
[1:24:44] the opportunity to our branches are
[1:24:47] going to shrivel up our wine Skins are
[1:24:49] going to dry out and what will happen is
[1:24:51] we'll make a spooky sound
[1:24:55] he said that if you don't cry out the
[1:24:57] rocks will immediately cry out
[1:25:02] I know we can say that some people will
[1:25:04] say my my nature is quiet I'm just quiet
[1:25:07] I'm not looking for sensationalism
[1:25:09] brothers and sisters I'm looking to see
[1:25:10] the maximum potential of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:12] and every single one of our Lives that's
[1:25:14] what I want to see
[1:25:15] the maximum potential of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:18] In Our Lives that's the only thing
[1:25:20] that's going to get us out of here
[1:25:22] but brother Branham says that you know
[1:25:24] it makes a mournful sound as the wind
[1:25:26] blows through those dead spooky trees
[1:25:28] and he goes on to talk about this and he
[1:25:30] says you know I I know you'll probably
[1:25:32] be able to type it I won't even really
[1:25:34] say it but he says in the midst of all
[1:25:36] those old trees all those big old trees
[1:25:40] they've gone through many battles and
[1:25:42] probably many different bugs and many
[1:25:44] different
[1:25:45] famines many droughts things have
[1:25:47] happened in their lives and they made it
[1:25:48] to the point where they're all up there
[1:25:51] in in the stature and and then they wind
[1:25:53] up burnt up and spooky brother Branham
[1:25:56] says when that fire blew through
[1:25:58] there was seeds in those trees
[1:26:01] that cracked
[1:26:02] and fell to the ground
[1:26:04] and what happened was those seeds
[1:26:07] started to take life
[1:26:09] and even though those big tall ones
[1:26:10] they're spooky and they won't do much
[1:26:12] boy those little ones those little ones
[1:26:15] he said you could see it from where he
[1:26:17] was his vantage point with the light of
[1:26:20] the moon shining down through those
[1:26:21] trees he said you could see the little
[1:26:23] trees moving in the breeze those little
[1:26:26] trees were moving back and forth just
[1:26:28] having a Revival of their own even in
[1:26:30] the midst of all of the other ones that
[1:26:32] are are dried up and gone
[1:26:34] the live Forest has a totally different
[1:26:37] sound brothers and sisters than an old
[1:26:39] one something that that can't worship
[1:26:42] anymore
[1:26:43] dead trees they just don't bend they're
[1:26:45] not flexible at all and brother Branham
[1:26:48] he types that as a type of the church
[1:26:50] going on in this in this message he says
[1:26:52] what does it take to to make a Christian
[1:26:54] Life
[1:26:58] that's the message so we paragraph 29 he
[1:27:00] says and so I I noticed when the winds
[1:27:03] fell
[1:27:04] the old tree moaned
[1:27:06] but the little tree had a Revival
[1:27:09] it just jumped and went around and
[1:27:12] around and around
[1:27:14] and flashed around shouting and praising
[1:27:17] the Lord
[1:27:18] when have you ever seen a tree jump
[1:27:21] and run around
[1:27:25] it just jumped and went around and round
[1:27:27] and round and flashed around shouting
[1:27:29] and praising the Lord and I thought well
[1:27:31] there's something we might say
[1:27:34] it might not have the education that the
[1:27:37] old ones got
[1:27:38] it may be green
[1:27:40] but it's flexible
[1:27:45] so that's what God was doing
[1:27:47] and I noticed it in an experience with
[1:27:50] God
[1:27:51] how it likes to shake his trees loosen
[1:27:54] them up
[1:27:55] and every time a tree moves and shakes
[1:27:57] it pulls the roots and makes them grow
[1:28:00] loose so they can grow down and get a
[1:28:03] better hold
[1:28:04] not destroy them isn't that beautiful
[1:28:09] now the Lutheran left what the Lutheran
[1:28:11] had left has the Methodist eaten with
[1:28:14] the Methodist left the Baptist eaten
[1:28:17] what the Baptist left the Presbyterian
[1:28:19] scene with the Presbyterians left the
[1:28:20] nazarines the nazarenes left
[1:28:23] Pentecostals eaten just before this in
[1:28:25] the message he he talks about the the
[1:28:27] Palmer worm the canker worm the Locust
[1:28:31] and and the Palmer worm I believe it is
[1:28:33] or the Palmer worm and the locus but he
[1:28:35] talks about all the different
[1:28:36] denominations here what the
[1:28:37] Presbyterians left the nazarenes eating
[1:28:39] with the nazarenes left the Pentecostals
[1:28:41] eaten but I will restore saith the Lord
[1:28:44] I will restore
[1:28:46] then God in his great move of the spirit
[1:28:49] is coming to restore that's his word
[1:28:51] brothers and sisters I would say expect
[1:28:53] it and you know we're not looking for a
[1:28:55] great world wild wide Revival there's
[1:28:58] many people that are prophesying that
[1:29:00] that's happening and that's gonna happen
[1:29:01] you know what's been happening since
[1:29:03] 1960s when the seals were open there has
[1:29:06] been a Revival and it's the bride's
[1:29:08] Revival and that Revival is right in
[1:29:10] line with the word of God it's not off
[1:29:12] on some other denominational Doctrine
[1:29:15] he goes on to say in this message how
[1:29:18] many times under enthusiasm and if
[1:29:20] you'll watch the life that it Bears
[1:29:22] talking about the Holy Spirit talking
[1:29:25] about the new spirit in people's lives
[1:29:27] if you'll watch the life that it Bears
[1:29:29] what life does it bear he says I hope
[1:29:32] I'm not hurting but I hope I'm
[1:29:34] uncovering and I thought oh my I don't
[1:29:37] want to read that I don't really want to
[1:29:39] say it but you know what brothers and
[1:29:40] sisters we're here to be Tried by the
[1:29:42] word of God the the house of the Lord is
[1:29:44] a house of correction all of us need to
[1:29:46] be corrected and if we can't be
[1:29:47] corrected that we're not Sons and
[1:29:49] Daughters of God he says I hope I'm not
[1:29:51] hurting I'm uncovering see a lot of
[1:29:54] times you think that you have the Holy
[1:29:56] Spirit oh said I some I spoke in tongues
[1:30:00] certainly
[1:30:01] being that close to it you might do all
[1:30:04] of that
[1:30:05] but that isn't the holy spirit yet see
[1:30:08] the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus
[1:30:11] Christ
[1:30:13] and I just can't help but stop there and
[1:30:15] say what I've always said and what I
[1:30:17] always will say maybe it makes people
[1:30:19] groan
[1:30:22] I really don't mean to do it but I think
[1:30:24] it's just so important what was Jesus
[1:30:27] like when he was here
[1:30:30] was he sitting down and saying that we
[1:30:33] need to study and we need to learn and
[1:30:35] we need to understand and we need to to
[1:30:38] be educated and we need to understand
[1:30:40] all of this and when you're done you'll
[1:30:42] actually be ordained you'll get a
[1:30:43] certificate of recognition because
[1:30:45] you've passed the exam
[1:30:47] no that's not what he told Simon Peter
[1:30:49] he said to Simon Peter Flesh and Blood
[1:30:52] hath not revealed that unto you but my
[1:30:54] Father which is in heaven hath revealed
[1:30:56] that unto you
[1:30:57] and Upon This Rock we know Revelation is
[1:31:01] what I'll build my church on not not not
[1:31:03] a study your way into it it's not an
[1:31:05] understanding intellectually and
[1:31:07] remember at the beginning he talked
[1:31:09] about the intellectuals we got to push
[1:31:10] those aside we got to get away from the
[1:31:12] intellectuals and get into the the
[1:31:14] dynamic power of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:31:16] lives
[1:31:18] but he says that is in the holy spirit
[1:31:19] yet see the Holy Spirit Bears record of
[1:31:22] Jesus Christ so once again I'll say it
[1:31:25] what was Jesus like when he was here we
[1:31:26] know that the word of God says that he
[1:31:28] was meek
[1:31:29] but that doesn't mean he was weak
[1:31:31] he was strong
[1:31:34] he went to Calvary how many people could
[1:31:37] pick up that cross and walk up that road
[1:31:39] and go to to the cross for all of the
[1:31:41] sins of man how many could just remain
[1:31:43] dumb as a as a lamb before his sheer as
[1:31:46] people buffeted him and pulled out his
[1:31:48] beard hair and spit on him and and
[1:31:50] smacked him in the head and said
[1:31:52] prophesy and tell us who did that how
[1:31:54] many of us could just remain silent
[1:31:56] through all of that
[1:31:57] he did
[1:32:00] how was Jesus when he was here the Holy
[1:32:03] Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ
[1:32:07] I just think it's beautiful because we
[1:32:09] can look at all of the different
[1:32:10] examples I'm not going to bring a whole
[1:32:12] bunch of them today but you know what
[1:32:14] I'm talking about all of the sinful
[1:32:16] nature of people that's who Jesus
[1:32:19] put himself with that's who Jesus went
[1:32:22] to he didn't go to the the smart and and
[1:32:24] shiny most religious people he went to
[1:32:27] the people who were in need he went to
[1:32:28] the Sinners and the publicans
[1:32:30] he went to the people that were ignorant
[1:32:32] and unlearned those are the people that
[1:32:34] he went to so so the Holy Spirit
[1:32:37] brothers and sisters it Bears record of
[1:32:39] Jesus Christ I'm not trying to say that
[1:32:40] Jesus Christ is looking for ignorance
[1:32:42] what I'm saying is Jesus Christ is
[1:32:44] looking for people that bear record of
[1:32:46] his spirit and his Spirit he talks about
[1:32:49] it there's fruit of the spirit and I'm
[1:32:51] so thankful we were taught that the
[1:32:53] fruit of the spirit it's not fruits it's
[1:32:56] not a multiple thing where you can just
[1:32:57] go to the grocery store of the word and
[1:32:59] say I'll just take one of these fruits
[1:33:01] and I'll just take some forgiveness and
[1:33:02] and I'll just take some long-suffering
[1:33:04] and I'll put those in my bag no no no no
[1:33:06] no no no no the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:33:08] has the fruit it's all one thing they
[1:33:10] all come together it's a package deal
[1:33:12] it's a bunch of fruit that grows on the
[1:33:14] same tree we cannot have the Holy Spirit
[1:33:17] and not have that whole bundle of fruit
[1:33:21] the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus
[1:33:23] Christ
[1:33:25] I can see here though with just that
[1:33:27] that sentence right there the Holy
[1:33:29] Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ you
[1:33:30] could easily take that and make that two
[1:33:32] persons you could easily take it and
[1:33:35] make it two separate uh of the three and
[1:33:38] and remain just sort of nebulous about
[1:33:41] about God he's not really in there but
[1:33:43] we know we're speaking of God when we
[1:33:45] talk about this the Holy Spirit God
[1:33:48] Bears record of Jesus Christ God
[1:33:52] it's not different people it's not
[1:33:54] different things it's not different
[1:33:56] places it's one God
[1:33:58] paragraph 33 he says now he taken and
[1:34:01] what did he do give you a new heart
[1:34:05] give you a new spirit and then he puts
[1:34:08] his spirit
[1:34:09] his Spirit In You
[1:34:12] I just can't help but think brothers and
[1:34:14] sisters when we understand this
[1:34:18] how easy is it to worship
[1:34:21] how easy is it to come in and just just
[1:34:24] worship you know I I we were at a
[1:34:27] volleyball tournament this weekend for
[1:34:29] the boys
[1:34:30] we live in a real world and
[1:34:33] they're playing volleyball with school
[1:34:34] but I was talking to them sometimes we
[1:34:37] need to maybe have a little bit of
[1:34:38] self-talk in our lives and maybe this
[1:34:40] would work spiritually I couldn't help
[1:34:42] but think as I was watching this maybe
[1:34:43] this would help spiritually there's
[1:34:45] there's certain things that we can do in
[1:34:47] our lives that will help us and I know
[1:34:49] the song leader has a certain thing that
[1:34:51] they'll do when they want to warm up
[1:34:52] their voice and I'm not going to do it
[1:34:54] now I'll let them demonstrate it for you
[1:34:55] sometime
[1:34:57] if they desire
[1:34:59] but they warm up
[1:35:01] they get into it they get into the
[1:35:03] spirit of it and I was talking about in
[1:35:05] in the volleyball in the game and those
[1:35:07] people who have played Sports here they
[1:35:08] probably fully understand what I'm
[1:35:10] talking about you don't start the game
[1:35:12] after you get there on the court and the
[1:35:14] ball is first sir if you start the game
[1:35:16] when you're going to bed the night
[1:35:18] before when you're waking up in the
[1:35:19] morning when when you're getting ready
[1:35:21] to go out the door when you're eating
[1:35:23] your breakfast you're in the game you're
[1:35:25] visualizing what's going to happen
[1:35:27] I can't help but think when we come to
[1:35:29] church
[1:35:30] are we still yawning and waking up
[1:35:33] and singing that song I'm so glad
[1:35:36] remember I said that that I can say I'm
[1:35:39] one of what
[1:35:40] a what if we sing it like that what are
[1:35:43] you so glad of
[1:35:45] but if you're one of them that brother
[1:35:47] Bradham came to remind that God pulled
[1:35:50] you from before the foundation of the
[1:35:51] world from his son if you're one of them
[1:35:54] that you never did anything about it
[1:35:55] from the beginning you just never did it
[1:35:58] from the start he came to remind you of
[1:36:00] that one of them oh my I'm one of them
[1:36:03] that's redeemed
[1:36:04] that he's going to give a new heart to
[1:36:06] he's going to place his own heart within
[1:36:08] me I'm one of them goodness sakes I
[1:36:11] can't help but think that's that's
[1:36:13] enough to shout brothers and sisters to
[1:36:16] run around the building
[1:36:20] but if we can recognize what he's done
[1:36:22] for us my goodness
[1:36:24] because he says this now he taken and
[1:36:26] what did he do give you a new heart
[1:36:29] give you a new spirit and then he puts
[1:36:31] his Spirit his Spirit In You
[1:36:34] he's done it all
[1:36:37] it's just like you don't have to go
[1:36:39] around and pretend that you're a
[1:36:40] Christian man
[1:36:42] that new spirit brings new life
[1:36:47] the holy spirit in your new spirit in
[1:36:51] your new heart your new heart your new
[1:36:55] spirit and the Holy Spirit goes right in
[1:36:57] the center of your new spirit and your
[1:37:01] new spirit goes right in the center of
[1:37:03] your new heart
[1:37:06] and you can't interact in this world
[1:37:08] without people seeing there's something
[1:37:09] different about you
[1:37:11] you don't even have to say it
[1:37:14] you don't even have to tell people I'm a
[1:37:16] Christian
[1:37:17] people will just stop swearing and
[1:37:19] they'll apologize for swearing in your
[1:37:21] presence and it's not because your
[1:37:23] presence is there it's because you have
[1:37:26] another spirit in you you bring another
[1:37:29] presence to the party
[1:37:32] you bring Jesus Christ himself
[1:37:35] and you know what happens all those evil
[1:37:37] spirits that are around we're not saying
[1:37:39] people are evil we're saying the spirits
[1:37:40] are evil all those evil spirits they
[1:37:42] recognize it
[1:37:43] isn't it just like in Jesus day
[1:37:46] if you zoom out for a sec in Jesus day
[1:37:48] the most religious people they call him
[1:37:50] Beelzebub
[1:37:51] didn't they
[1:37:53] oh because you believe the message for
[1:37:54] your day your Beelzebub
[1:37:57] but the Devils they're the ones that
[1:37:59] cried out and said oh no son of David
[1:38:03] have mercy on us don't don't send us out
[1:38:06] before our time
[1:38:08] they were able to recognize who it was
[1:38:10] the son of man was present with them
[1:38:13] it's the same thing today Spirits don't
[1:38:15] die
[1:38:16] Jesus never died
[1:38:18] the only thing that he did was he laid
[1:38:20] down the body of Flesh
[1:38:22] and he went down into hell and took the
[1:38:23] keys of death and hell off of the side
[1:38:26] of Satan and said you know what you're
[1:38:28] defeated
[1:38:29] you probably knew that you were
[1:38:30] somewhere along the way you know brother
[1:38:32] Branham he tells the story and says oh
[1:38:34] Satan was waiting for him to be knocking
[1:38:36] at the door
[1:38:37] and he said oh I knew you were coming
[1:38:39] now I got you and what did he do he
[1:38:42] grabbed him by the throat and said no
[1:38:44] you don't got me I got you
[1:38:47] I got you the most intellectual
[1:38:49] intelligent being ever created ever to
[1:38:52] be created I got you
[1:38:56] the holy spirit in your new spirit
[1:38:59] in your new heart
[1:39:01] your new heart your new spirit and the
[1:39:03] Holy Spirit goes right in the center of
[1:39:06] your new spirit and your new spirit goes
[1:39:08] right in the center of your new heart
[1:39:11] and you know brothers and sisters this
[1:39:13] can sound really convoluted and and
[1:39:16] confusing and I don't want it to be that
[1:39:18] way especially where we have children
[1:39:19] because there's children present that
[1:39:21] are listening to me and I know parents
[1:39:22] are probably going to say
[1:39:24] what's brother Barry talking about why
[1:39:26] are my children coming to me asking
[1:39:27] questions but it's important for us to
[1:39:29] understand these things that we can in
[1:39:31] fact get to a place where we think that
[1:39:33] everything is okay and it's not okay
[1:39:35] because why because our spirit our
[1:39:40] spirit
[1:39:41] beareth witness with his spirit and his
[1:39:44] Spirit beareth witness with our spirit
[1:39:46] where together we're United we're in
[1:39:49] accord we're not fighting ourselves
[1:39:51] we're not in in torment we're not angry
[1:39:55] one day and happy the next day we're not
[1:39:57] up today and down tomorrow we're we're
[1:40:00] stable brother Adam talks about the
[1:40:01] believer being solid and and and just
[1:40:05] ReSound not not being up or down
[1:40:09] we know that it's a false teaching for
[1:40:11] us to be saved today and lost tomorrow
[1:40:12] that's the devil he crept into the
[1:40:15] church
[1:40:16] and and that's the teaching it makes it
[1:40:17] lukewarm formal empowerless people come
[1:40:19] to the place where they say I can't live
[1:40:20] it so why would I even try there's no
[1:40:22] way that I can ever just maybe wear the
[1:40:24] dresses that that females wear or or not
[1:40:27] cut my hair like the word of God says or
[1:40:28] or or do whatever the word of God says
[1:40:31] there's no way that I can ever do it and
[1:40:32] you're 100 right as a human being when
[1:40:34] you say that
[1:40:35] there's no way that a human being can
[1:40:37] ever behave that way
[1:40:39] but you know what
[1:40:41] you get his spirit
[1:40:42] if you can get the holy spirit in your
[1:40:44] life if you can start with getting a new
[1:40:46] spirit because that's what he'll do is
[1:40:48] give you a new spirit then he'll place
[1:40:50] his heart within you when when you just
[1:40:53] take the steps that he's asking to do
[1:40:55] only believe that's really the only
[1:40:56] thing we have to do if we can do that
[1:40:58] then he will actually do it all the word
[1:41:01] of God says that he will do it all we
[1:41:03] don't do any of it only thing that we do
[1:41:05] is believe it because he said it
[1:41:08] but I just can't help but think just
[1:41:10] maybe turn with me to Romans chapter 8.
[1:41:15] the spirit itself it Bears witness of
[1:41:19] what Spirits inside of us
[1:41:21] so it's not just brother Berry saying
[1:41:23] you know this sounds good it's fantastic
[1:41:25] I just want to make sure that we're
[1:41:26] we're bringing it back to the word we're
[1:41:28] saying what the prophet said we're
[1:41:29] saying what the word of God said this
[1:41:31] isn't just something that we're trying
[1:41:33] to Cobble together and make it sound
[1:41:35] fantastic the spirit itself beareth
[1:41:38] witness if you read from verse 14 it
[1:41:40] says for as many as are led by the
[1:41:42] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:41:46] if we're willing to be led by the spirit
[1:41:48] of God how could you be led by the
[1:41:49] spirit of God if you don't get the Holy
[1:41:50] Ghost in your life
[1:41:52] come to church
[1:41:54] this is where deceit can happen you can
[1:41:56] hear preaching and if you don't have the
[1:41:58] spirit of God in your life somebody can
[1:42:00] come and tell you whatever they want to
[1:42:01] and you won't know whether it's right or
[1:42:03] not
[1:42:05] and you know what it's going to be so
[1:42:07] close that it would deceive the very
[1:42:08] elective if possible Satan is very
[1:42:10] cunning he's very interested in coming
[1:42:12] to church he came to church with Adam
[1:42:14] and Eve he came and gave her one word
[1:42:18] off
[1:42:19] that's what caused the entire fall one
[1:42:21] word off
[1:42:24] he's going to use the word he's not just
[1:42:25] going to come as a raging monster
[1:42:28] his Spirit beareth Witness
[1:42:30] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:42:33] God they are the sons of God
[1:42:35] verse 15.
[1:42:37] sometimes we get hurt in our lives but
[1:42:39] brothers and sisters get the Holy Ghost
[1:42:40] in our lives and this verse will come
[1:42:42] alive for ye have not received the
[1:42:45] spirit of bondage again to fear if we're
[1:42:48] afraid
[1:42:49] it's a spirit of bondage
[1:42:52] if we can't just let go and let the Holy
[1:42:54] Ghost have his way in our lives because
[1:42:56] of whatever because of a fear it's a
[1:42:59] spirit that's trying to hold us back the
[1:43:00] spirit is just trying to hinder us to
[1:43:02] us from going on to realize who
[1:43:04] we are but if we can get beyond that if
[1:43:07] we recognize that if we have fear in our
[1:43:09] lives we can say I rebuke you spirit of
[1:43:11] fear in the name of Jesus Christ because
[1:43:13] that's not what the word of God says the
[1:43:15] word of God says but ye have received
[1:43:17] the spirit of adoption whereby we come
[1:43:20] to church on time and we want to worship
[1:43:22] Him and cry Abba Father because we
[1:43:25] recognize what he's done for us the
[1:43:27] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:43:30] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:43:33] we don't have to tell people that I'm a
[1:43:35] Son of God or a daughter of God we don't
[1:43:37] have to go around and say I'm a
[1:43:39] Christian don't say that I'm a Christian
[1:43:41] don't do that we just have to be there
[1:43:44] we just have to live our lives and his
[1:43:46] spirit will bear witness with our spirit
[1:43:48] verse 17 says and if if children then
[1:43:51] heirs doesn't matter it's okay you can
[1:43:54] have it all I don't need the best part
[1:43:56] of the deal go ahead take it all take
[1:43:59] all the money off the table make it
[1:44:01] yours because that's all you're ever
[1:44:03] going to get because I know that I'm an
[1:44:04] heir and my father owns it all so it's
[1:44:07] fine you can go ahead if children than
[1:44:10] heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with
[1:44:12] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:44:14] that we may be also glorified together
[1:44:17] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:44:19] present time they're not worthy to be
[1:44:21] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:44:22] revealed where
[1:44:24] in US
[1:44:27] if we can just believe
[1:44:29] you know not get stuck in Romans chapter
[1:44:31] 7.
[1:44:33] Romans chapter 7 oh I want to do good
[1:44:36] and evil is present and every time I try
[1:44:38] to do good evil abounds oh my who can
[1:44:43] save me from this flesh that I am
[1:44:46] what a Wretched Man I am yes we are on
[1:44:49] our own
[1:44:50] but remember Turn the Page
[1:44:53] go to Romans chapter 8. and read verse
[1:44:56] one there is therefore now not tomorrow
[1:44:59] not some time out in the future there's
[1:45:02] therefore right now no condemnation to
[1:45:04] those who walk not after the flesh but
[1:45:07] after the spirit that's why brothers and
[1:45:10] sisters we got to get the Holy Ghost In
[1:45:11] Our Lives when we got the Holy Ghost In
[1:45:13] Our Lives we're going to be anchored in
[1:45:15] Jesus it's not just being anchored in a
[1:45:18] church it's not just being anchored in a
[1:45:20] tradition or a theology it's being
[1:45:22] anchored in him when the Devil comes
[1:45:24] around and tries to plant thoughts in
[1:45:26] our mind which he's going to do every
[1:45:27] single second of every single minute of
[1:45:29] every single hour of every single day of
[1:45:30] every single week of every single month
[1:45:32] of every single year as long as we're
[1:45:33] hearing this flash Satan is going to
[1:45:35] come and give us thoughts thoughts
[1:45:37] thoughts thoughts he's going to know the
[1:45:38] genetic weaknesses of our parents and
[1:45:40] our grandparents and our
[1:45:41] great-grandparents and he's going to
[1:45:43] continually barrage us with thoughts and
[1:45:45] we have to take every single one of
[1:45:46] those thoughts into captivity of the
[1:45:48] word outside of the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:45:50] Lives how would we ever do it
[1:45:54] if we think about how much pressure
[1:45:55] there is in this age
[1:45:58] we've got the screen in our hand brother
[1:46:00] Branham talked about them duping us how
[1:46:03] Satan did it to us and he brought in the
[1:46:05] picture shows and people can't really
[1:46:07] contain themselves with the picture
[1:46:09] shows I remember when we would be going
[1:46:10] to church Downtown Calgary
[1:46:13] on Wednesday nights or Sunday nights it
[1:46:15] was typically Sunday nights maybe
[1:46:17] sometimes on Saturdays we'd be driving
[1:46:19] down Memorial Drive
[1:46:21] right past
[1:46:23] the Firestone Tower there Barlow Trail
[1:46:25] we'd be going around there and there was
[1:46:27] a drive-in theater there when I was a
[1:46:29] kid he was on the north side of the road
[1:46:31] on the right side and you'd just be able
[1:46:33] to see downtown Calgary and at night
[1:46:35] time you'd be able to see a screen like
[1:46:37] this and and you'd be coming down the
[1:46:40] road and it would just sort of be there
[1:46:41] but it was captivating
[1:46:44] this big screen and I would always be
[1:46:46] looking to see if I could just catch a
[1:46:48] glimpse just a little bit of some kind
[1:46:50] of a movie something
[1:46:52] and why is that
[1:46:53] brother Branham said it when they pulled
[1:46:56] the lid of hell
[1:46:57] off in Hollywood
[1:46:59] he said they they thought you know
[1:47:02] we can't escape it they they brought in
[1:47:04] the picture show and people can't escape
[1:47:06] that idea
[1:47:08] but he said you know what they did what
[1:47:10] Satan did he brought in the television
[1:47:12] he brought out that television and it
[1:47:14] tells a vision all right but you know we
[1:47:17] thought that was maybe at a time that
[1:47:19] was the greatest thing and it was the
[1:47:21] greatest thing for a while but then I
[1:47:23] remember when I was young they were
[1:47:24] talking about something called the
[1:47:26] information superhighway
[1:47:28] and we know it as the internet now but
[1:47:30] that information superhighway has come
[1:47:32] in now and you can actually have the
[1:47:34] video conference with someone in your
[1:47:36] from your pocket in your hand you can
[1:47:38] actually pull out your phone and we've
[1:47:40] all got those devices we're all subject
[1:47:42] to the barrage of Satan
[1:47:44] and you know wouldn't it be nice if we
[1:47:46] could just have maybe what some people
[1:47:48] have called the truth Network and all of
[1:47:51] us who are believers just have a
[1:47:53] believer's
[1:47:54] maybe cell phone company where all we
[1:47:57] see is is Believers information that's
[1:47:59] all it's only positive it's only the
[1:48:01] word it's only our Believers it's only
[1:48:03] scripture you know that's not going to
[1:48:05] happen because we live in Satan's Eden
[1:48:07] we have got to guard ourselves we have
[1:48:10] got to guard gird up the loins of our
[1:48:14] mind we've got to make sure that we're
[1:48:15] on guard put on the whole armor of God
[1:48:17] every single day
[1:48:19] we've got to buckle it down
[1:48:22] but brothers and sisters when we look at
[1:48:24] our lives and we see all these things
[1:48:25] these Temptations these problems I
[1:48:27] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:48:28] present time they're not worthy to be
[1:48:30] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:48:32] revealed in us one of these days we're
[1:48:34] going to see their loved ones that went
[1:48:35] on before us and we're going to say my
[1:48:37] my oh my here we are finally it came
[1:48:40] this is what we've all been waiting for
[1:48:43] this is what we've preached our hearts
[1:48:44] out about this is what we've prayed
[1:48:46] earnestly for this is what we've taught
[1:48:48] our children about this is what we've
[1:48:50] talked to our neighbors about this is
[1:48:51] what we have desired our whole entire
[1:48:53] lives and all the people went to the
[1:48:56] Grave not knowing not being able to see
[1:48:58] this but we are those chosen ones I'm so
[1:49:00] glad that I can say I'm one of them how
[1:49:03] will we sing it their brothers and
[1:49:04] sisters
[1:49:06] why
[1:49:10] because that glory is going to be
[1:49:11] revealed in US
[1:49:13] because we're going to take on a new
[1:49:15] body
[1:49:17] brother Branham he takes another example
[1:49:19] in this message
[1:49:21] he says so it's like a mainspring and a
[1:49:23] famous watch
[1:49:24] and it's self-winding
[1:49:27] all right now we've got different
[1:49:29] watches now but I think some of the
[1:49:30] really good ones they're still
[1:49:32] self-winding and and some of them you
[1:49:34] even still need to whine but they have a
[1:49:35] mainspring they're really good watches
[1:49:37] and it's self-winding he says all right
[1:49:40] it sets right in the middle of that new
[1:49:43] spirit
[1:49:44] and the mainspring of a famous watch
[1:49:47] sets in the middle of the watch and
[1:49:51] makes every organ of that watch every
[1:49:54] little instrument tick just perfectly to
[1:49:57] time
[1:49:59] it's all done by a main spring
[1:50:02] and the little works out on the side
[1:50:05] move with this main spring
[1:50:08] it's the wheel in the middle of the
[1:50:10] wheel as Ezekiel said
[1:50:13] it just is perfectly balanced and it's
[1:50:16] perfectly timed and if we can just look
[1:50:18] at our lives and recognize we don't need
[1:50:20] to get fussed brothers and sisters we
[1:50:22] don't need to get upset we just need to
[1:50:24] recognize they were all those little
[1:50:26] parts of working around that main spring
[1:50:30] his will is actually making it tick his
[1:50:32] will is keeping it going it's his word
[1:50:35] in our lives and as long as we can line
[1:50:38] up with his word we will have success
[1:50:41] we will see him move in our lives
[1:50:45] you know I just think it's almost
[1:50:47] unbearable when we think about how we
[1:50:50] there's no way that we can actually how
[1:50:53] do we how do we take every single
[1:50:55] thought into captivity as we talked
[1:50:57] about a couple minutes ago how do we do
[1:50:58] that
[1:50:59] there's no way humanly possible
[1:51:02] that we can take every thought but the
[1:51:03] word says take every thought into
[1:51:05] captivity
[1:51:07] I just think it's got to become that
[1:51:09] subliminal it's it's a subconscious
[1:51:12] thing brother random talks about it in
[1:51:13] this message it has to be a subconscious
[1:51:15] thing it has to come to that place where
[1:51:17] we just don't even reason it we just say
[1:51:19] nope that's not God's word nope that's
[1:51:20] not God's word nope that's not God's
[1:51:22] word and because it's not God's word I'm
[1:51:23] just going to dismiss it I'm just going
[1:51:24] to dismiss it I'm just going to dismiss
[1:51:26] it if somebody says something to us
[1:51:27] that's not God's word we're not looking
[1:51:28] for a fight we don't want to fight with
[1:51:30] them we'll just simply dismiss it and
[1:51:31] say God bless you I'm not going to go
[1:51:32] there I'm just not willing to enter into
[1:51:34] that I'm just going to dismiss it and go
[1:51:36] forwards but I'm not going to have a
[1:51:38] bitter battle I'm not going to jump on a
[1:51:40] war wagon and say oh I've got something
[1:51:41] to prove I've got to straighten this
[1:51:43] person out on their Doctrine
[1:51:45] it's all done by the mainspring
[1:51:48] well the problem just uses a simple
[1:51:49] example it's just done by the mainspring
[1:51:51] it's done by the Holy Ghost brothers and
[1:51:53] sisters it's done by the spirit of
[1:51:55] Christ this whole entire world is
[1:51:57] happening according to the will of God
[1:52:01] every single part of it every single
[1:52:05] facet of it nothing is happening outside
[1:52:08] of God knowing about it and allowing it
[1:52:12] you believe that this morning
[1:52:16] because if we think that something
[1:52:18] happens and it's outside of God's
[1:52:21] understanding then he's not God
[1:52:24] but every single thing that's happening
[1:52:26] is for a reason
[1:52:27] and you know it's all working together
[1:52:31] for the good
[1:52:33] for a certain group of people
[1:52:35] not for everyone
[1:52:37] sometimes it's said all things work
[1:52:38] together for the good period That's not
[1:52:40] the scripture the scripture says to
[1:52:42] those who were called according to his
[1:52:44] purpose those are the ones that it's
[1:52:46] working together for the good for and
[1:52:48] the other people it's terrible but it's
[1:52:50] true it might not be working together
[1:52:53] for the good for them
[1:52:55] but what does it take to make a
[1:52:57] Christian Life brothers and sisters get
[1:52:59] the Holy Ghost
[1:53:01] what does it take to make your Christian
[1:53:02] Life
[1:53:03] it's not Church attendance it's not it's
[1:53:06] not tenure I've been in the message for
[1:53:08] however many years that doesn't do it
[1:53:10] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:53:12] Life truly surrender unto the Lord Jesus
[1:53:15] Christ surrender unto the word of God
[1:53:17] for our day get the Holy Ghost in our
[1:53:19] lives and then all of these other things
[1:53:21] will be added unto us
[1:53:24] I just heard a brother say it one time
[1:53:25] you know he caught the revelation of
[1:53:27] tithing
[1:53:28] and and I don't want to talk about
[1:53:29] tithing I'm going to have somebody else
[1:53:31] come and talk about tithing
[1:53:33] I could talk about it I mean it's
[1:53:34] scriptural and I have no reason to not
[1:53:36] talk about it but I just don't want
[1:53:38] people thinking that I'm trying to you
[1:53:40] know encourage it or whatever it can be
[1:53:42] such a sticky subject because you know
[1:53:44] the love of money is the root of all
[1:53:45] evils what the word of God says and
[1:53:47] people get so fussy over money I don't
[1:53:49] want to go there too much but
[1:53:52] money
[1:53:54] is an interesting thing it's a tool
[1:53:56] that's designed to be used by US and to
[1:53:58] work for us that's what money is
[1:54:01] but sometimes people get a revelation
[1:54:03] about tithing
[1:54:04] and and they recognize wait a second
[1:54:06] there's a blessing there for me if I
[1:54:08] tithe
[1:54:09] and and the blessing isn't because
[1:54:11] you're a active member of the society or
[1:54:14] whatever I'm not going that way with it
[1:54:16] I'm saying that the word of God opens up
[1:54:18] supernaturally spiritually for those
[1:54:20] people who catch that Revelation but
[1:54:21] where I'm going with all this is to say
[1:54:23] this I heard a brother say one time
[1:54:24] there was a guy in another church
[1:54:26] somewhere else he caught the revelation
[1:54:28] of tithing and you know what he could
[1:54:29] not wait to get his paycheck is what
[1:54:31] this this pastor was saying every single
[1:54:33] time he got his paycheck he when he
[1:54:35] first had this Revelation he would run
[1:54:37] to the bank cash the check and run to
[1:54:40] the church like Friday afternoon
[1:54:41] Saturday morning and want to pay his
[1:54:43] tithes because there was a blessing in
[1:54:45] store for him for that tithing and you
[1:54:48] know I just can't help but think many
[1:54:49] times we we look at that and it might be
[1:54:51] once a month it might be twice a month
[1:54:53] it could be however many times that's
[1:54:54] that's everybody else's personal private
[1:54:57] business between you and God but what I
[1:54:59] want to say is put the tithing aside and
[1:55:01] think about the worship he's not
[1:55:03] interested in your money he's interested
[1:55:05] in your worship that's what he's truly
[1:55:08] interested in and that's what Satan's
[1:55:10] trying to gobble up if he can distract
[1:55:12] us then he's taken away the worship but
[1:55:14] what if you were able to just push the
[1:55:15] tithing aside and say I know that there
[1:55:18] is a tremendous spiritual blessing for
[1:55:20] me to be able to give him that worship
[1:55:22] that he desires when I worship Him
[1:55:24] Something Happens something changes
[1:55:26] something Supernatural takes place in
[1:55:29] the service something Supernatural takes
[1:55:31] place in my prayer meeting in my home in
[1:55:33] my living room when I worship God God
[1:55:36] comes on the scene and you know brothers
[1:55:38] and sisters that's really the best
[1:55:40] blessing that we could ever get is just
[1:55:42] to give God all the worship of Our Lives
[1:55:44] the fruit of our lips to be able to
[1:55:46] express to him his word to say that I'm
[1:55:49] so thankful that you called me from
[1:55:52] before the foundation of the world to
[1:55:53] recognize what he's done for us
[1:55:57] I just think tithing is such a minor
[1:56:00] thing and some people might say well
[1:56:01] brother bear you might not think so if
[1:56:02] you weren't taking your wage from it and
[1:56:04] you know maybe but if I had to get a job
[1:56:07] I would
[1:56:08] we could get a job
[1:56:10] it's work it's fine and then you know
[1:56:12] what I get that blessing of tithing and
[1:56:14] I'll say this too in this position I
[1:56:17] still get the blessing of tithing
[1:56:18] because I still tithe
[1:56:20] I tithe on what I take but I also tithe
[1:56:22] on what the church takes
[1:56:24] the church tithes because there's a
[1:56:26] blessing in it
[1:56:29] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:56:31] Life paragraph 34 brother Branham says
[1:56:33] now when you receive the Holy Spirit it
[1:56:36] goes right in the middle of that new
[1:56:38] dispen disposition of yours
[1:56:41] oh you say I quit drinking I quit
[1:56:44] smoking
[1:56:46] you know I I I just feel like a
[1:56:49] different person oops wait a minute see
[1:56:53] you just got a new spirit
[1:56:56] but the Holy Spirit comes in the middle
[1:56:58] of that spirit
[1:56:59] and then he makes you every
[1:57:01] main motion
[1:57:04] every intellectual
[1:57:06] everything agreeing right into the
[1:57:08] middle of the wheel
[1:57:10] what God says that's true
[1:57:13] if the days of Miracles if Jesus is the
[1:57:16] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:57:18] Holy Spirit would bear record with that
[1:57:21] and every intellectual move of yours
[1:57:24] would say the same thing
[1:57:28] we wouldn't get hung up on things we
[1:57:31] wouldn't get sidetracked with situations
[1:57:34] and and problems
[1:57:36] we would just follow the word of God and
[1:57:38] say you know I just trust that he has
[1:57:40] this all under control this is his his
[1:57:42] business it's not mine we don't run the
[1:57:45] church like a business but what I'm
[1:57:47] saying is it's his interest it's not
[1:57:49] necessarily his business this is this is
[1:57:51] his and he'll do with it what he wants
[1:57:55] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:57:56] Life
[1:57:57] and when you have these little temper
[1:58:00] fits and you fly out and you tell lies
[1:58:04] and you proselyte and you jump fences
[1:58:08] and you so selfish with your
[1:58:10] organization
[1:58:12] that you're so narrow-minded you
[1:58:14] couldn't hear another minister
[1:58:16] just remember
[1:58:18] the Holy Spirit isn't ticking in the
[1:58:20] inside of you
[1:58:22] I think this is so important brothers
[1:58:24] and sisters this is the prophet of God
[1:58:26] speaking these words and further to that
[1:58:29] I would say because we can just put it
[1:58:31] off and say wow it's just a man he's
[1:58:32] saying it maybe he had faults maybe he
[1:58:34] made mistakes some people might say well
[1:58:35] the prophet of God he was only Human
[1:58:36] After All no I'll say it this way this
[1:58:39] is God speaking to man through the
[1:58:41] Prophet this is God's word this is the
[1:58:43] Holy Ghost speaking if you believe that
[1:58:44] God sent a Prophet this is under
[1:58:46] inspiration he's talking these words so
[1:58:49] people get it he says that if you have
[1:58:51] this if you're so narrow-minded you
[1:58:53] couldn't hear another Minister well the
[1:58:54] word of God says that it's the fivefold
[1:58:56] ministry that will do the perfecting of
[1:58:58] the Saints is it not it truly is it's
[1:59:00] not just one minister
[1:59:02] it's not just one guy somewhere maybe a
[1:59:04] few and we know that we've heard people
[1:59:06] say it in the past that there's only
[1:59:07] this many you know however many fingers
[1:59:10] you can hold up
[1:59:11] ordain people or or anointed people in
[1:59:14] the end time to be able to bring the
[1:59:15] gospel that's that's a lie of the devil
[1:59:18] he says just remember the Holy Spirit
[1:59:19] isn't ticking inside of you I I don't
[1:59:22] know I was going to say that but that's
[1:59:24] all right see and if you hear him say
[1:59:25] that you can see he's even a little
[1:59:27] surprised that he said it
[1:59:29] I believe it's important for us to
[1:59:31] recognize it we need to know if we don't
[1:59:34] have the right attitude it's not the
[1:59:37] right spirit
[1:59:39] and the only reason I would say for the
[1:59:41] most part because I believe we've all
[1:59:42] got the Holy Ghost
[1:59:44] I'm not saying that we're talking to
[1:59:46] people that don't have the Holy Ghost I
[1:59:47] want to speak the prophet of God said
[1:59:49] that you will never live higher than
[1:59:51] your confession you'll never live above
[1:59:52] your confession so if I go start saying
[1:59:54] well I believe there's some people here
[1:59:55] today they just don't have the Holy
[1:59:57] Ghost and we need to you know maybe have
[1:59:58] a prayer meeting and we need to get down
[2:00:00] to the root of things and start
[2:00:01] belittling people no way it's not up to
[2:00:04] me to say that it's up to me to
[2:00:06] encourage everyone to get to that finish
[2:00:08] line to get across that goal line to say
[2:00:10] I have scored a touchdown I know that I
[2:00:13] know that I know I don't have to worry I
[2:00:15] don't have to wonder I got that eternal
[2:00:17] security in my life I know that I'm
[2:00:19] sealed to the day of my Redemption I'm
[2:00:22] not saved today and lost tomorrow I know
[2:00:24] I've got the holy ghost in my life
[2:00:25] that's what I'm trying to to do brothers
[2:00:28] and sisters who encourage us to
[2:00:29] recognize that the holy spirit will make
[2:00:31] every movement like Christ it'll make
[2:00:34] you christ-like
[2:00:36] the fruits of the spirit is love joy
[2:00:39] peace long suffering goodness meekness
[2:00:41] gentleness patience faith those things
[2:00:44] are what the Holy Spirit controls
[2:00:47] our emotions
[2:00:50] brings it back to a flesh part a flesh
[2:00:52] level a carnal reason a space that we
[2:00:56] can maybe comprehend but it's our
[2:00:58] emotions those are the things that the
[2:01:01] Holy Spirit controls our emotions our
[2:01:04] emotions is not so much as jumping up
[2:01:06] and down
[2:01:08] I love how he says this you could do
[2:01:10] that a shindig will bring that to you
[2:01:12] remember there's people that went to The
[2:01:14] Beatles concerts
[2:01:16] and got healed because of an inspiration
[2:01:19] that was happening there just because we
[2:01:21] get a healing doesn't mean it's the Holy
[2:01:23] Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters
[2:01:24] brother Bradham talks about many people
[2:01:26] coming in the prayer line getting
[2:01:28] getting healed getting healed getting
[2:01:29] healed and lost tomorrow
[2:01:32] it doesn't matter if we get healed in
[2:01:33] our bodies this body has to perish
[2:01:37] one way or the other we're not going to
[2:01:39] take this body with us
[2:01:42] says you could go do that a ship day
[2:01:43] will bring that out in you but the Holy
[2:01:45] Spirit brings you into operation or in
[2:01:48] control of God that you walk in peace in
[2:01:52] love and in Joy with long-suffering
[2:01:54] goodness meekness gentleness and
[2:01:56] patience you see it isn't something that
[2:01:59] you do
[2:02:00] it's something the Holy Spirit does in
[2:02:03] you
[2:02:05] he says you see it's no longer an
[2:02:07] intellectual thought of your own it's a
[2:02:09] subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit
[2:02:11] oh I wish I could shout the Praises of
[2:02:14] God around the world to that
[2:02:17] isn't that beautiful
[2:02:19] turn with me quickly in your Bibles we
[2:02:21] still have 10 minutes left
[2:02:23] let's go to First Corinthians
[2:02:29] First Corinthians 15.
[2:02:36] we live in these natural bodies and
[2:02:39] many times
[2:02:41] well I would say every day it feels like
[2:02:43] I fail
[2:02:46] every day
[2:02:47] I have to fight those thoughts but those
[2:02:50] are the same thoughts
[2:02:51] not just that maybe there's something
[2:02:53] about a brother or there's this or
[2:02:55] there's that I would say they're
[2:02:56] probably the most important thoughts is
[2:02:57] to recognize our self-talk about
[2:02:59] ourselves because we fall we fall we
[2:03:01] fall that doesn't change Who We Are
[2:03:04] remember the story that that I told you
[2:03:07] brother Wayne said in Saskatoon it was
[2:03:09] beautiful
[2:03:10] he called a young brother up
[2:03:12] and he said what's your name he said I
[2:03:14] think it was David
[2:03:15] and he said fall down
[2:03:17] so he fell down he said get back up
[2:03:19] what's your name
[2:03:20] is David
[2:03:22] fall down get back up what's your name
[2:03:24] David
[2:03:25] what's your dad's name Joe
[2:03:28] he said is your falling down change your
[2:03:29] name nope
[2:03:31] did your falling down change your dad's
[2:03:33] name nope
[2:03:35] doesn't change us
[2:03:37] the only thing we do is we trip when we
[2:03:38] fall
[2:03:39] and when we're training a child to walk
[2:03:41] we help them
[2:03:44] think about how the Lord watches over
[2:03:46] his children
[2:03:47] when we're truly his children
[2:03:49] he grabs us he doesn't let us fall on
[2:03:52] our face sometimes we do trip and fall
[2:03:54] and sometimes we need a little bump here
[2:03:56] and there but for the most part he saves
[2:03:58] us from our our bruises and he saves us
[2:04:00] from our pains but brothers and sisters
[2:04:02] this this body that we live in is not
[2:04:04] going to go where we're going you're not
[2:04:07] seeing the real me I'm not seeing the
[2:04:08] real you
[2:04:10] let's start reading with uh First
[2:04:12] Corinthians 15 verse 41.
[2:04:16] there is one glory of the Sun and
[2:04:19] another glory of the Moon and another
[2:04:21] glory of the stars for one star
[2:04:23] different from another star in glory
[2:04:26] so also is the resurrection of the Dead
[2:04:30] it is sown in corruption it is raised in
[2:04:33] incorruption
[2:04:35] it's sown in dishonor
[2:04:37] it is raised in glory
[2:04:40] it's sown in weakness it's raised in
[2:04:42] power
[2:04:43] as we read this brothers and sisters I
[2:04:45] want to remind us I want to I want to
[2:04:47] just emphasize this the word of God says
[2:04:50] that it's going to be exactly the way
[2:04:51] we're living right now
[2:04:53] we're going to be contending with this
[2:04:56] flesh
[2:04:57] it's sown in dishonor verse 43 it's
[2:05:00] raised in glory it's sown in weakness
[2:05:02] it's raised in power it's sown in a
[2:05:04] natural body it is raised in a spiritual
[2:05:06] body there is a natural body and there
[2:05:09] is a spiritual body
[2:05:11] and so it's written the first Adam man
[2:05:14] first man Adam was made a living Soul
[2:05:16] the last Adam was made a quickening
[2:05:19] spirit Glory
[2:05:21] how be it that was not the first which
[2:05:23] is spiritual
[2:05:24] but that which is natural and afterward
[2:05:27] that which is spiritual the first man is
[2:05:31] of the earth Earthly the second man is
[2:05:35] the Lord From Heaven
[2:05:39] the man that we have is earthy this
[2:05:42] flesh is earthy and it's going to be
[2:05:45] earthy all the way through brothers and
[2:05:47] sisters
[2:05:48] but if we can get the Holy Ghost we're
[2:05:49] going to stop looking at this flesh
[2:05:51] that's the difference we're going to
[2:05:52] stop looking at this flesh and we're
[2:05:54] going to start looking at the promise
[2:05:56] and maybe this is only for me today I
[2:05:58] don't know but I just can't help but
[2:05:59] think about Romans 8 5 and 6 here
[2:06:04] Romans 8 5 and 6. I'll just read it
[2:06:06] quickly for us
[2:06:07] for they that are after The Flesh do
[2:06:09] mind the things that are flesh but they
[2:06:11] that are after the spirit the things of
[2:06:13] the spirit remember we read that the
[2:06:15] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[2:06:17] spirit
[2:06:18] when we look around and we see people
[2:06:19] they're busy minding the the fleshy
[2:06:22] things in this world
[2:06:23] What Spirit influence are they under
[2:06:27] verse 49
[2:06:29] and as we have borne the image of the
[2:06:31] Earthly
[2:06:32] we shall also bear the image of the
[2:06:34] heavenly
[2:06:36] just like he said he will take you out
[2:06:38] of the Nations he will give you a place
[2:06:40] to live and then he'll take and put a
[2:06:42] new spirit within you and then he'll
[2:06:44] take your old heart out and then he'll
[2:06:45] put a new heart in you he'll do that
[2:06:47] operation all on his own
[2:06:50] we shall bear the image of the heavenly
[2:06:53] now this I say Brethren that flesh and
[2:06:56] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[2:07:00] so why don't we stop trying to make it
[2:07:02] like this flesh should
[2:07:04] this flesh will never inherit the
[2:07:06] kingdom of God ever
[2:07:11] but I know Satan comes around and says
[2:07:13] oh look at you you fell you know how are
[2:07:15] you ever going to make it there well I'm
[2:07:16] not this flesh is not it's the Inner Man
[2:07:19] the second Adam that life of Jesus
[2:07:21] Christ inside that is
[2:07:24] now this I say Brethren that flesh and
[2:07:26] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[2:07:28] neither doth corruption inherit
[2:07:30] incorruption
[2:07:33] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[2:07:35] all sleep but we shall be changed
[2:07:38] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[2:07:41] at the last Trump for the trumpet of God
[2:07:43] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[2:07:45] incorruptible
[2:07:47] and we shall be changed
[2:07:50] for this corruptable
[2:07:52] must put on incorruption and this Mortal
[2:07:56] must put on immortality isn't that
[2:07:59] beautiful
[2:08:00] that's his word declaring that it is
[2:08:03] going to happen it must happen nothing
[2:08:06] will stop his word from coming to pass
[2:08:08] that means that our flesh will be put
[2:08:11] off
[2:08:12] this corruption that we deal with will
[2:08:15] actually be put down and we will be
[2:08:17] transformed into a new glorious body
[2:08:19] into incorruption
[2:08:21] the only thing that we're going to take
[2:08:22] is his character with us that's what's
[2:08:24] going to happen it'll be his character
[2:08:25] that takes us for this corruptable must
[2:08:28] put on incorruption and this Mortal must
[2:08:30] put on immortality so whether it's
[2:08:32] corruptable shall have put on
[2:08:33] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[2:08:35] put on immortality then shall be brought
[2:08:38] to pass the saying that is written death
[2:08:40] is swallowed up in Victory
[2:08:43] and I want to say this this morning
[2:08:45] brothers and sisters as we live this
[2:08:46] message of the hour as we fill our cups
[2:08:49] every time we come to Service as we
[2:08:51] worship God as we spend time with the
[2:08:53] Lord as we believe this message of the
[2:08:55] hour and we eat the book just like John
[2:08:57] was instructed death is being swallowed
[2:09:00] up in Victory
[2:09:02] it's not just one event that's going to
[2:09:04] happen it's that process of the Rapture
[2:09:06] and what's happening is the rapture is
[2:09:09] swallowing up death because eventually
[2:09:11] these bodies will give forth and we'll
[2:09:13] have a new glorious body that's going to
[2:09:15] happen
[2:09:16] and you know what will happen
[2:09:18] it'll say death is swallowed up in
[2:09:20] Victory oh death where is thy sting and
[2:09:22] Grave where is thy victory
[2:09:25] I know we've talked about in the past
[2:09:26] brother Branham he says it you know
[2:09:28] we're afraid of dying
[2:09:30] most people are afraid of death this
[2:09:32] body is afraid of death the old man this
[2:09:35] incorruption this corruption rather is
[2:09:37] afraid to die he doesn't want to stop
[2:09:39] living
[2:09:41] it it's just nature of the human being
[2:09:43] of the animal
[2:09:45] but you know what it has to
[2:09:47] and when we choose to lay it down
[2:09:49] ourselves when we choose to say just be
[2:09:51] it unto me according to Thy word Lord
[2:09:53] let this body die out so that you can
[2:09:55] live then then we no longer have fear
[2:09:58] because what happens if we die what's
[2:10:00] the worst that can happen oh you're
[2:10:01] gonna die we're gonna die
[2:10:03] but guess what we live
[2:10:06] we become more alive than we've ever
[2:10:08] been because we believe
[2:10:11] we don't lose we win
[2:10:13] Satan wants to make us think we lose
[2:10:16] oh my you're gonna die ah you're gonna
[2:10:18] get a terrible disease or you're going
[2:10:20] to have an accident or something awful
[2:10:22] is going to happen in your life yeah
[2:10:24] sure it's terrible that's tragic but we
[2:10:27] can look at Believers and say they're
[2:10:28] more alive today who have gone on before
[2:10:30] us than they ever were here
[2:10:34] but if we could look Satan in the face
[2:10:36] and say you know what I'm not afraid to
[2:10:37] die
[2:10:39] where is thy sting and Grave where is
[2:10:42] your Victory you've got none there's
[2:10:44] nothing that you can do because we can
[2:10:46] say but thanks be to God which giveth us
[2:10:48] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[2:10:51] Christ
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:53] and it just draws it back full circle
[2:10:55] I'll call the musicians well we close
[2:10:56] today but it just brings it back full
[2:10:58] circle it's Jesus Christ Living out
[2:11:00] through us the only way he does that is
[2:11:02] to get the Holy Ghost in our lives
[2:11:06] verse 58 says therefore my beloved
[2:11:09] Brethren be ye steadfast
[2:11:11] unmovable
[2:11:13] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[2:11:15] for as much as ye know that your labor
[2:11:18] is not in vain in the Lord if you're
[2:11:20] doing something for the lord it's not in
[2:11:22] vain
[2:11:23] our labor is not in vain for the Lord
[2:11:25] he's he's watching every move that we
[2:11:27] make
[2:11:29] remember
[2:11:31] therefore maybe stand with me as we
[2:11:33] close
[2:11:34] therefore say thus saith the Lord God
[2:11:38] speaking to Ezekiel therefore say thus
[2:11:41] saith the Lord God I will even gather
[2:11:44] you from the people and assemble you out
[2:11:47] of the countries where ye have been
[2:11:50] scattered and I will give you the land
[2:11:52] of Israel
[2:11:54] I'll say it I'll give you the Holy Ghost
[2:12:00] and they shall come hither
[2:12:02] and they shall take away all the
[2:12:04] detestable things thereof
[2:12:06] and all the Abominations thereof from
[2:12:09] thence
[2:12:10] and I will give them a new heart and I
[2:12:13] will put a new spirit within you and I
[2:12:15] will take the Stony heart out of their
[2:12:17] flesh
[2:12:18] and we'll give them a heart of Flesh
[2:12:21] I just want to encourage us brothers and
[2:12:22] sisters
[2:12:23] this isn't out there somewhere in the
[2:12:25] future this is happening right now
[2:12:28] this very moment every single day that
[2:12:31] we live on this side of Eternity if we
[2:12:34] are willing to Humble ourselves to the
[2:12:36] word of God say maybe I don't understand
[2:12:37] it but I believe it so long as we're
[2:12:39] willing to do that to have an open heart
[2:12:41] to have the right attitude brother Adam
[2:12:42] said the God said through brother Brown
[2:12:44] of the right mental attitude towards any
[2:12:47] one of the promises of God will bring it
[2:12:48] to pass in our lives if we want more of
[2:12:51] God there's more of God to have if we're
[2:12:53] willing to take him at his word and just
[2:12:55] say be it unto me according to Thy word
[2:12:56] he will come and he'll take away the
[2:12:59] detestable things he'll take away the
[2:13:01] Abominations thereof and he will give
[2:13:03] them one heart he'll give you a new
[2:13:05] heart he'll give you a new spirit he'll
[2:13:07] place his Spirit within God bless you
