[1:01:42] anything all
[1:01:44] right let's open our Bibles to First
[1:01:47] John 2:15
[1:01:56] take about three verses in first John
[1:01:58] and then we'll go to Joshua
[1:02:18] 7
[1:02:22] Hallelujah first John 2:15
[1:02:29] love not the world neither the things
[1:02:32] that are in the world if any man love
[1:02:36] the world the love of the father is not
[1:02:39] in
[1:02:40] him for all that is in the world the
[1:02:44] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:02:46] and the pride of life is not of the
[1:02:48] father but is of the
[1:02:51] world and the world passeth away and the
[1:02:55] last there of but he that doeth the will
[1:02:58] of God abideth forever amen let's read
[1:03:03] Joshua
[1:03:22] 7 this is a bit of a long read
[1:03:32] all right Joshua 7 but the children of
[1:03:35] Israel committed a trespass in the Cur
[1:03:38] thing for aan the son of K the son of
[1:03:43] zapi the son of Zarah of the tribe of
[1:03:46] Judah took of their ctin and the anger
[1:03:48] of the Lord was kindled against the
[1:03:51] children of
[1:03:53] Israel so he took it and it was candled
[1:03:56] against
[1:03:57] Israel and Joshua sent men from Jericho
[1:04:00] to
[1:04:01] I which is beside Beth Heaven on the
[1:04:05] east side of bethl and spake unto them
[1:04:07] saying go up and view the country and
[1:04:10] the men went up and viewed ey and they
[1:04:13] returned to Joshua and said to him unto
[1:04:15] him let not all the people go up but let
[1:04:18] about two or 3,000 man go up and smite
[1:04:22] ey and make not all the people to labor
[1:04:25] theer for there they are but
[1:04:29] few so note the assessment as well so
[1:04:33] they went up theer of the people about
[1:04:36] 3,000 men and they fled before the men
[1:04:39] of
[1:04:40] a and the men of a smoke of them about
[1:04:44] 30 and six men and they chased them from
[1:04:48] before the gate even unto shearim and
[1:04:51] smoke them in the going down wherefore
[1:04:53] the hearts of the people melted and
[1:04:55] became came as water and Joshua rent his
[1:04:58] clothes and fell to the Earth upon his
[1:05:02] face before the Ark of the Lord until
[1:05:04] the even tide he and the Elders of
[1:05:07] Israel and put dust upon their heads and
[1:05:11] Joshua said
[1:05:14] atas oh my Lord God wherefore hast thou
[1:05:18] at all brought these people over Jordan
[1:05:21] to leave to deliver us unto the hand of
[1:05:24] the amorites to destroy us would to God
[1:05:28] we had been content and dwell on the
[1:05:31] other side Jordan oh Lord why shall I
[1:05:34] say when Israel turneth their backs
[1:05:37] before their enemies for the Canaanites
[1:05:39] and the inhabitants of the land shall
[1:05:42] hear of it and shall Enon us round and
[1:05:45] cut off our name from the earth and what
[1:05:49] will thou do unto thy great
[1:05:52] name and the Lord said unto Joshua get
[1:05:56] thee up wherefor liest thou thust upon
[1:06:01] thy
[1:06:02] face may the Lord add His blessings to
[1:06:05] the reading of his word you may be
[1:06:07] seated um I'll just continue a little
[1:06:10] bit
[1:06:11] more I'll just continue so just keep
[1:06:14] your Bibles as I I go
[1:06:19] along 11 Israel ha
[1:06:24] sinned and they have also transgressed
[1:06:26] my Covenant which I commanded them for
[1:06:30] they have even taken of their ctin and
[1:06:33] have also stolen and dissembled also and
[1:06:37] have put it even among their own
[1:06:45] stuff I'll continue from
[1:06:49] 16 so Joshua rose up early in the
[1:06:52] morning and brought Israel by their
[1:06:54] tribes and the tribe of Judah was
[1:07:04] taken and he brought the family of
[1:07:08] Judah and he took the family of
[1:07:11] zarit of the Zares and he brought the
[1:07:14] family of the
[1:07:16] Zares Man by man and zapi was taken and
[1:07:21] he brought a he brought his household
[1:07:24] Man by man and aan the son of Cari the
[1:07:27] son of zabi the son of Zarah of the
[1:07:29] tribe of Judah was taken and Joshua said
[1:07:33] unto Aken my son give I pray thee glory
[1:07:36] to the Lord of Israel and make
[1:07:38] confession unto him and tell me now what
[1:07:41] thou has done hide it not from me and
[1:07:45] aen answered Joshua and said indeed I
[1:07:48] have sinned against the Lord God of
[1:07:49] Israel and thus and thus have I done
[1:07:53] when I saw among the SPs a good
[1:07:55] babylonish garment and 200 shekels of
[1:07:59] silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels
[1:08:01] weight then I coverted them and took
[1:08:04] them and behold they are HID in the
[1:08:06] earth in the midst of my tent and the
[1:08:09] silver under it so Joshua sent
[1:08:12] Messengers and they ran onto the tent
[1:08:16] and behold it was hid in his tent and
[1:08:18] the silver under it and they took them
[1:08:21] out of the midst of the tent and brought
[1:08:24] them onto Joshua and to all the children
[1:08:26] of Israel and laid them out before the
[1:08:29] Lord and Joshua and all Israel with him
[1:08:32] took aan the son of Zarah and the silver
[1:08:36] and the Garment and the wedge of gold
[1:08:38] and his sons and his daughters and his
[1:08:41] oxen and his asses and his sheep and his
[1:08:44] tent and all that he had and brought
[1:08:47] them unto the valley of Acro and Joshua
[1:08:50] said why hast thou troubled us the Lord
[1:08:55] shall trouble thee this day and all
[1:08:57] Israel stoned him with stones and burned
[1:09:01] them with a fire after they had stoned
[1:09:04] them with stones and they raised over
[1:09:06] him a great heap of stones unto this day
[1:09:09] so the Lord turned from the fierceness
[1:09:11] of his anger wherefore the name of the
[1:09:14] place was called the valley of acho Unto
[1:09:17] this day
[1:09:20] amen I know it's a long read but um I
[1:09:23] try to
[1:09:26] read as much as possible just to give it
[1:09:29] context in the in a one room Schoolhouse
[1:09:32] so to speak praise the name of the Lord
[1:09:36] now this may sound a bit of like
[1:09:39] comparing these two scriptures and then
[1:09:41] my title Is
[1:09:43] possessing our inheritance amen
[1:09:46] possessing our
[1:09:48] inheritance and so um
[1:10:00] praise the name of the Lord and so there
[1:10:02] are two things I want to say as we go
[1:10:04] into this first
[1:10:08] inheritance what um inheritance is
[1:10:12] something that is
[1:10:13] free inheritance is something that does
[1:10:16] not cost
[1:10:17] anything now when we say that even if
[1:10:22] there is a cost it is to the pretty
[1:10:26] it is to the person who worked to get
[1:10:29] the inheritance but for you at least in
[1:10:32] the natural law not in
[1:10:34] the not with the taxes of the system now
[1:10:38] but in natural laws inheritance is
[1:10:41] free and so when a predecessor lives it
[1:10:45] for an air to the air it costs nothing
[1:10:49] to the successor it cost nothing now
[1:10:53] when the Pres sucessor passes on
[1:10:55] and then he lives it and and I like to
[1:10:57] say passes on because I don't want to
[1:10:59] always to relate inheritance to only to
[1:11:02] death there are sometimes that people
[1:11:04] inherit things without the without the
[1:11:07] one who is in h the one without the
[1:11:09] predecessor necessarily being dead now
[1:11:13] if you look at this congregation you can
[1:11:16] look at every child and tell who their
[1:11:17] parents are because maybe they inherited
[1:11:20] their habits they inherited their looks
[1:11:22] their inheritance their appearance and
[1:11:23] behavior and so inh itance can happen
[1:11:26] and not necessarily be that the person
[1:11:29] has died and so when a predecessor
[1:11:32] passes on what he lives behind oh I went
[1:11:35] I bought this house and the kitchen is
[1:11:38] yellow why oh yeah we inherited it from
[1:11:41] the previous owner right and so that
[1:11:44] happens now having said that inheritance
[1:11:47] is free we have to establish something
[1:11:50] that inheritance is always
[1:11:53] conditional praise the name of the Lord
[1:11:56] inheritance is always conditional so
[1:12:01] somebody could pass on and leave your
[1:12:04] name in a will in that sense it's
[1:12:08] specific it's you it cannot be anybody
[1:12:11] else somebody can pass on and say this
[1:12:15] is to my female children or my
[1:12:18] daughters it means being a child of that
[1:12:21] person is not enough you have to be
[1:12:23] female as well they could say well
[1:12:27] um this let's let's put all the Assets
[1:12:30] in the trust they can access it when
[1:12:33] they are 18 years old so it's a
[1:12:36] condition now you have to reach 18 to
[1:12:38] access it right sometimes they could you
[1:12:41] know know this could even say you have
[1:12:43] to marry somebody to ACC access the
[1:12:47] throne and so inheritance is always
[1:12:52] conditional and yes it's free but that
[1:12:55] is where things change that much as it
[1:12:59] is free and it cannot be ended the
[1:13:03] conditions can disqualify one person
[1:13:06] praise the name of the Lord and so that
[1:13:08] is something that I wanted us to um
[1:13:11] begin looking
[1:13:16] at the other side of it is the need and
[1:13:20] the the importance of our faith in this
[1:13:22] life's
[1:13:23] journey now
[1:13:26] now all of our life Journey as
[1:13:29] Christians is Promised
[1:13:33] driven praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:13:36] that is all everything that we do as
[1:13:38] Believers is promis driven what do I
[1:13:41] mean by that we were
[1:13:44] lost we were
[1:13:45] miserable we were heading straight to
[1:13:48] hell we didn't even know it and the Lord
[1:13:51] came our way he came our way and he
[1:13:55] showed us our condition he showed us why
[1:13:58] we were headed by the choices we have
[1:14:00] made and he told us I still love you and
[1:14:04] this is my plan for you and if you trust
[1:14:07] me if you believe me this is where I
[1:14:09] want to send you and so you would
[1:14:12] realize that between the two what is
[1:14:15] happening right now is that we have
[1:14:17] believed something that we have been
[1:14:19] told and believing that defies our
[1:14:23] environment it defies the life that we
[1:14:26] live it defies how we are born because
[1:14:29] we are born in sin we are sheded in
[1:14:31] iniquity but now with that belief what
[1:14:34] we are holding on to right now becomes
[1:14:37] an inheritance amen praise the name of
[1:14:39] the Lord it becomes an inheritance that
[1:14:42] we are looking for and so without his
[1:14:45] promises we did not even know we did not
[1:14:48] even have the desire in our hearts just
[1:14:51] consider the children of Israel in Egypt
[1:14:55] all the people who moved to Egypt died
[1:14:59] and then generation after generation
[1:15:01] until 400 years later Deliverance comes
[1:15:04] the people that Moses went to meet were
[1:15:07] all people who were born in slavery they
[1:15:10] were all people that the only thing they
[1:15:13] knew was to be slaves they knew they
[1:15:16] were different but the only thing they
[1:15:18] knew was to be slaves they had nothing
[1:15:21] else but you see the word of God told
[1:15:24] them that there is a land somewhere for
[1:15:26] you the word of God told them that if
[1:15:28] you believe the Lord if you trust the
[1:15:30] Lord he will lead you there and that in
[1:15:33] that land you will not be slaves in that
[1:15:36] land it's flowing with milk and honey
[1:15:39] for you Hallelujah and so it's the word
[1:15:43] of God that placed even the desire in
[1:15:45] their hearts otherwise they didn't even
[1:15:48] know of
[1:15:49] anything praise the name of the Lord and
[1:15:51] the all of the environment was slavery
[1:15:54] and so at the best they could Aspire for
[1:15:57] was to be a better slave the best they
[1:15:59] could Aspire for was to serve their
[1:16:01] Master well so that maybe they could be
[1:16:04] the head slave or something nothing
[1:16:06] beyond that but God had other plans
[1:16:10] Hallelujah and so here we go with this
[1:16:14] if we don't allow the promises of God
[1:16:16] because the is promise driven if we
[1:16:20] don't allow the promises of God if we
[1:16:23] don't look through the Bible and find
[1:16:25] the promise somebody said there are
[1:16:27] about 7,700 promises in the Bible for
[1:16:30] the
[1:16:32] believer and so we are called to look at
[1:16:35] these things and Abraham says it says if
[1:16:37] I'm a Christian I'll look through the
[1:16:39] Bible and find all the blessings that
[1:16:42] pertain to me am praise the name of the
[1:16:45] Lord and I'll stay on my feet till the
[1:16:47] Lord fulfills them hallelujah amen and
[1:16:51] so the desire even to want something
[1:16:53] different from what the devil has given
[1:16:56] us comes from the word of God so if we
[1:16:59] don't allow these promises to dictate
[1:17:02] Our Lives then guess what we in Satan's
[1:17:05] hien our environment will dictate it for
[1:17:08] us we will look at it we'll say it's
[1:17:10] wrong it's wrong oh that's how they are
[1:17:13] well it's normal and then we normalize
[1:17:16] sin praise the name of the Lord and that
[1:17:18] is why it's important for always to
[1:17:20] focus on the word and the promises that
[1:17:24] are contained in there
[1:17:26] Hallelujah now what we read is an
[1:17:29] experience of a people who have received
[1:17:31] the word of God is the experience of a
[1:17:34] people who have believed on the Lord is
[1:17:37] the experience of the people who have
[1:17:38] acted on the word of the Lord they had
[1:17:41] seen very many victories and they had
[1:17:44] even followed the prophet or in the
[1:17:46] process of possessing the promised land
[1:17:50] but then suddenly something happens that
[1:17:53] is not consistent with with the
[1:17:55] expectation a stunning
[1:17:58] defeat and it's so stunning that even
[1:18:00] their leader Joshua is left prostrate on
[1:18:03] the
[1:18:04] floor saying Lord what shall I say when
[1:18:09] Israel turneth her back on her enemies
[1:18:12] Now understand it in their case the
[1:18:15] enemies were
[1:18:17] people because they were conquering and
[1:18:20] natural
[1:18:21] possession but let's understand it this
[1:18:24] way that these enemies were the people
[1:18:27] that they were supposed to conquer in
[1:18:29] neither to take the land so until they
[1:18:32] conquer these people the land is not
[1:18:34] theirs God has given it to them but they
[1:18:37] have to overcome these people and so any
[1:18:40] time you see a jebo side on the land is
[1:18:43] confirmation that you have not possessed
[1:18:45] your inheritance anytime you see the the
[1:18:49] people of AI confirmation that you've
[1:18:51] not possessed your inheritance anybody
[1:18:53] that you see on the land that is not
[1:18:55] like you is confirmation that you've not
[1:18:58] possessed your inheritance now like we
[1:19:01] we read the enemies are the three Giants
[1:19:06] every other thing else are just symptoms
[1:19:09] of those three Giants right amen
[1:19:12] hallelujah amen the last of the flesh
[1:19:15] the last of the eye and the pride of
[1:19:17] life praise the name of the Lord so this
[1:19:21] is what we have to overcome and so when
[1:19:24] you see that maybe I am too lazy to call
[1:19:28] a brother understand it it's a symptom
[1:19:30] praise the name of the Lord when we seem
[1:19:33] to be talking about divorce in the
[1:19:36] message understand it it's a
[1:19:38] symptom that there is something we've
[1:19:40] Not Conquered yet and it's our
[1:19:43] inheritance and we are the people called
[1:19:45] to conquer it when all the dressing only
[1:19:49] personal appearance has to be of sex
[1:19:52] appeal either shorter or maybe tighter
[1:19:56] to reveal body understand it there is a
[1:20:00] a field that we've Not Conquered yet
[1:20:02] amen
[1:20:06] hallelujah when I am too lazy to get up
[1:20:11] and get a job to feed my
[1:20:14] family understand that there is
[1:20:16] something that has not been conquered
[1:20:19] and yet most of you will be wondering
[1:20:21] what I know I've seen
[1:20:22] it where
[1:20:25] addicted to social media can you imagine
[1:20:28] that I so then I will stay on till 3
[1:20:32] a.m. 4: a.m. 5 a.m. and sleep and not go
[1:20:35] to work so I I get kicked
[1:20:37] out the devil is
[1:20:40] Raging and we have to stay focused on
[1:20:44] the only thing that can keep us sound
[1:20:46] and
[1:20:47] saying
[1:20:49] hallelujah now this happened after God
[1:20:52] had given his word to Joshua
[1:20:56] the Lord had told Joshua that everywhere
[1:20:59] the soul of your feet shall tread
[1:21:02] upon Ted upon has been given to
[1:21:06] you so for Joshua footsteps meant
[1:21:10] possession now I I just want to draw
[1:21:12] attention to a little bit on the side
[1:21:15] here that God did not say wherever on
[1:21:17] Earth you step have giving it to you no
[1:21:20] because he left
[1:21:22] Egypt he was in the wilderness that was
[1:21:25] not given to him wherever the soul of
[1:21:28] your F shallat in the promised land I've
[1:21:31] given it to you what am I saying I'm
[1:21:34] saying that the promised land itself is
[1:21:36] a promise the token itself is a promise
[1:21:41] but you see for Israel to thrive for
[1:21:44] Israel their protection their security
[1:21:47] for them to be pleasing to God and
[1:21:49] everything they do was in the promised
[1:21:51] land every provision they require was in
[1:21:54] the promised land you understand
[1:21:56] brothers and sisters that the promised
[1:21:58] land is the Holy Ghost by understanding
[1:22:01] that the Holy Ghost itself is a promise
[1:22:04] but in the Holy Ghost you access every
[1:22:07] promise that the Lord has for you
[1:22:09] hallelujah amen so the token itself is a
[1:22:12] promise but it also places the all other
[1:22:16] promises within rich and then once you
[1:22:19] have it we are in a position to possess
[1:22:23] the rest Hallelujah
[1:22:26] so let's
[1:22:28] see I will want to start
[1:22:32] reading oh
[1:22:37] nice in the message the everpresent
[1:22:40] water from The Rock barrah Says if you
[1:22:43] can believe it whatever whatever God
[1:22:46] will lead your soul to
[1:22:49] believe whatever could mean anything but
[1:22:55] remember he's talking about people whose
[1:22:57] Souls can be led by God hallelujah so
[1:23:02] that's why I'm saying you have to access
[1:23:03] the promised land first and then you
[1:23:06] have all the promises available to
[1:23:09] you he said whatever God will lead your
[1:23:13] soul to believe that is yours and I
[1:23:17] believe that if you're in the promised
[1:23:19] land God will not lead your soul
[1:23:22] to to believe all
[1:23:25] desire the garlic of
[1:23:27] Egypt
[1:23:31] Hallelujah every place the source of
[1:23:33] your food can step upon by faith God
[1:23:37] gives it to you amen it's yours you
[1:23:40] possess it if you can find a key to this
[1:23:44] law of faith that opens it up you see
[1:23:46] what I mean that power is controlled by
[1:23:50] if you're a Son of God you are a
[1:23:52] daughter of God that never leaves
[1:23:55] you hallelujah it's with you all the
[1:23:59] time but your faith gets away from it
[1:24:03] but it's still there praise the name of
[1:24:06] the Living God and so we are talking
[1:24:09] about something to begin with what
[1:24:11] they're trying to possess they even
[1:24:14] didn't know about it it's the word of
[1:24:16] God that told them about it so this is
[1:24:18] God's plan this is God's purpose which
[1:24:21] they have believed and they are going
[1:24:23] forward in that
[1:24:25] condition that God has spoken God has
[1:24:27] given them a a promise and they believe
[1:24:29] it so the Fulfillment of this word in
[1:24:33] itself is in the interest of God God
[1:24:36] desires to fulfill his own promise to
[1:24:39] his chosen people and that is more than
[1:24:42] even our willingness to receive the
[1:24:44] promises of God amen hallelujah
[1:24:51] amen I know my
[1:24:55] leaveth let's watch some of this
[1:24:59] purposes it is the purpose of God to
[1:25:01] give us the Blessed Holy Spirit how many
[1:25:04] believe
[1:25:05] that it is the purpose of God to show us
[1:25:09] signs and wonders and miracles it's the
[1:25:12] purpose of God nothing can destroy it
[1:25:15] all powers of Hell might wager against
[1:25:18] it but it will prevail we have God's
[1:25:21] Eternal promise there may be teachers
[1:25:23] there may be isms right there may be
[1:25:25] great programs right there may be things
[1:25:27] that look like that it will be destroyed
[1:25:31] but it can never be destroyed it is the
[1:25:34] purpose of God to see that it will
[1:25:36] prevail then it's not up to me it's not
[1:25:39] up to you whether it be
[1:25:42] destroyed or not it's up to God and we
[1:25:46] can rest assured on it that God will
[1:25:49] never let our heritage be
[1:25:51] destroyed it's his promise to give it to
[1:25:55] us so the heritage is that promise that
[1:25:59] we have believed is that promise that we
[1:26:01] are holding on to is that promise that
[1:26:03] we are watch walking towards Hallelujah
[1:26:06] is that promise that is driving our very
[1:26:09] lives that is our heritage so if you are
[1:26:12] sitting here this morning my question is
[1:26:15] have you received a promise from God has
[1:26:18] your identity being revealed to you
[1:26:21] Hallelujah have you received do you
[1:26:23] recogn your day and the message in your
[1:26:26] day Hallelujah I can tell you this that
[1:26:29] Moses didn't just go to Israel uh go to
[1:26:32] Egypt to preach and hope somebody will
[1:26:35] believe it no from the time God called
[1:26:38] him God told him I'm sending you my
[1:26:41] people in
[1:26:42] Egypt Hallelujah and I will tell you
[1:26:45] this brothers and sisters that brother
[1:26:47] Abraham did not come here and hope that
[1:26:50] somebody will believe no he had a
[1:26:52] mandate he was coming to seek a bride
[1:26:55] for the Lord Jesus Christ and I can
[1:26:58] assure you this
[1:26:59] 2,400 years before now god mentioned you
[1:27:03] and I in Malachi am Hallelujah so God
[1:27:08] had us in mind when he called God had
[1:27:11] you see Moses didn't go to uh uh how do
[1:27:15] I say the children of Israel were not
[1:27:18] there because Moses came Moses went
[1:27:21] there because the children of Israel
[1:27:22] were there and that is the same we don't
[1:27:25] come here because of the message the
[1:27:27] message came here because of you and
[1:27:30] I Hallelujah and God had a purpose for
[1:27:34] sending it specifically to
[1:27:38] us he forew those For Whom The Promise
[1:27:41] was intended Hallelujah
[1:27:44] am so it's not a coincidence that you
[1:27:46] are
[1:27:48] here let's understand that we didn't
[1:27:50] call ourselves the Bride of the Lord
[1:27:51] Jesus Christ right that was in the Bible
[1:27:54] years
[1:27:58] before many people thought well it
[1:28:00] applies to all
[1:28:02] Christians I just thought maybe it's a
[1:28:04] people who will come one day I just
[1:28:07] thought it's maybe some symbolism that
[1:28:09] we don't understand but like everything
[1:28:12] else in the Bible God designed it that
[1:28:15] only he can reveal what he
[1:28:17] meant and so in this time he knew you
[1:28:20] and I are here and so he sends a prophet
[1:28:23] to tell us you you are my bride
[1:28:26] Hallelujah you are my bride and so it's
[1:28:28] up to us to accept it to believe it to
[1:28:31] hold on to it and get up praise the name
[1:28:34] of the Lord and claim our
[1:28:37] inheritance
[1:28:40] Hallelujah this is why I always believe
[1:28:42] that when I question God's
[1:28:46] interpretation of the Bible to me today
[1:28:49] I'm questioning my own identity that's
[1:28:52] right but more than that I'm questioning
[1:28:53] my my
[1:28:55] destiny Hallelujah may the Lord help
[1:28:59] us CU outside the
[1:29:03] message where is the certainty that I am
[1:29:05] the bride and especially I am the bride
[1:29:08] to the exclusion of
[1:29:14] others what does it take to make a
[1:29:16] Christian Life 57 baram says may you
[1:29:19] take me on record this morning friend
[1:29:22] there isn't enough power in all hell can
[1:29:25] ever defeat the purpose of
[1:29:27] God God will do it
[1:29:31] anyhow
[1:29:34] Hallelujah and so that means that when
[1:29:37] he said it is the purpose of God for the
[1:29:39] Holy Ghost nothing will change it amen
[1:29:42] when it means that he when he said that
[1:29:44] it was the purpose of God to send signs
[1:29:46] and wonders and miracles nothing can
[1:29:48] change it amen
[1:29:50] hallelujah so we are in a very good
[1:29:53] place praise the name of the Lord now
[1:29:56] what has happened and what we have read
[1:29:59] right now is that there is a halt in the
[1:30:02] process of the Fulfillment of the
[1:30:05] promise of God the question then is does
[1:30:09] God mean what he
[1:30:11] says or was this for a different time
[1:30:15] was it for a different
[1:30:17] season is it just for a a a a select
[1:30:20] group of people and we are not part of
[1:30:22] it what is happening why are there
[1:30:26] people on earth going under authority of
[1:30:28] the word of God and then they are
[1:30:30] turning their backs on their
[1:30:32] enemies they unable to possess the land
[1:30:35] when they know their identity when they
[1:30:38] know their mandate when they know their
[1:30:41] call why are they turning their backs on
[1:30:43] their
[1:30:44] enemies but I love Joshua you know when
[1:30:48] you know your identity you know who to
[1:30:50] turn to praise the name of the Lord so
[1:30:54] Joshua called for a
[1:30:56] timeout and he asked the obvious and I
[1:30:59] believe that the boldness to even do
[1:31:01] that stands from this your certainty in
[1:31:04] the promises of God for you
[1:31:08] Hallelujah so he knew that God makes no
[1:31:11] mistakes right so if we don't get what
[1:31:14] is expected according to the promise
[1:31:17] then what's wrong don't we have a right
[1:31:20] to ask
[1:31:22] Hallelujah I'm reading
[1:31:25] from if God be with us then where is all
[1:31:28] the
[1:31:30] Miracles I think just the title should
[1:31:32] have been
[1:31:34] enough
[1:31:36] Hallelujah is the Commandment of God for
[1:31:39] they said he's the same yesterday today
[1:31:41] and forever so as long as he is to be
[1:31:44] there forever he's there no question
[1:31:48] about it he's there where is the
[1:31:50] Miracles what's hindering the Miracles
[1:31:54] God sent Christ Christ is alive ever
[1:31:56] more wherever two or three are gathered
[1:31:58] together in my name I'll be in their
[1:32:00] midst amen L I'm with you always even to
[1:32:03] the end of the world there he is his
[1:32:08] promise Hallelujah what's the matter
[1:32:11] then we've L the clouds of doubt now
[1:32:14] brother brah is explaining the clouds of
[1:32:17] Doubt greed temper selfishness
[1:32:21] denominations and other things break
[1:32:24] break in on us break in and take away
[1:32:28] from the word hallelujah now I never
[1:32:32] thought that I would you know be talking
[1:32:35] about Sin and the symptoms of sin and
[1:32:38] mention
[1:32:39] denomination but when he said take away
[1:32:42] from the
[1:32:43] word there I understood that yes it does
[1:32:49] that and so we are called today and and
[1:32:53] when we look out at our lives and we
[1:32:56] look at our manifestations we are happy
[1:32:59] we are glad the Lord has been good to
[1:33:02] us but on the basis on the authority of
[1:33:05] the word of God we should see more than
[1:33:07] we have
[1:33:09] seen and so we should be asking where is
[1:33:12] that God of the Bible where is the one
[1:33:15] we read of in the Bible where is the god
[1:33:18] of William Maron
[1:33:19] Braham
[1:33:22] Hallelujah you know last week
[1:33:30] um brother Justin I think it was last
[1:33:32] week brother Justin was here and was
[1:33:35] singing that
[1:33:37] song and I sat down I was just
[1:33:41] wondering because you see sister Becky
[1:33:45] has shared her testimony I think at the
[1:33:48] end of the year at Saskatoon and for the
[1:33:52] second time she has beaten cancer
[1:33:55] and I I was just wondering how many
[1:33:59] times has healing flowed from here and
[1:34:02] it had just passed over the tops of the
[1:34:04] people's
[1:34:07] head because every provision every
[1:34:10] promise God has given us is in his
[1:34:12] word it's not going to come that maybe
[1:34:15] one day he'll bring a superhuman to
[1:34:17] preach and they'll have some wings and
[1:34:21] walking on air no is this simple gospel
[1:34:25] amen that is where the healing is amen
[1:34:28] that is where the provision is that is
[1:34:30] where the life is and so it's flowing
[1:34:33] from here every day it's flowing in the
[1:34:35] songs it's flowing in the
[1:34:39] word and so it like I tell my children
[1:34:43] there is absolutely nothing with the
[1:34:45] word we
[1:34:46] receive the fact is can we tune in to
[1:34:52] get what is intended for us
[1:34:54] or do we just come to take off yes we
[1:34:58] came to church today and that is it a
[1:35:01] lot is going on but understand it all
[1:35:04] the things that we read about in
[1:35:05] Abraham's life it's just a Vindication
[1:35:07] of the
[1:35:08] life is that same life if we produce
[1:35:12] that same life we'll see the same
[1:35:14] Vindication
[1:35:17] Hallelujah and so there's a lot going on
[1:35:21] let's not make it simple or common to
[1:35:24] us let's keep our Focus
[1:35:30] Hallelujah somebody get
[1:35:32] here get to
[1:35:34] church and then they tune
[1:35:37] out completely tuned
[1:35:39] out what do you expect when you are
[1:35:41] coming to church and you just get here
[1:35:44] and you tune out completely let's praise
[1:35:47] the Lord let's let's get up and sing
[1:35:49] completely tuned out let's pray
[1:35:51] completely tuned out why bring that
[1:35:54] Spirit
[1:35:57] here I dare say it's even
[1:36:01] dangerous because it's just like the
[1:36:04] word is just passing on and it's passing
[1:36:06] on and then it gets to a point we are so
[1:36:08] used to it we don't we are no longer
[1:36:10] sensitive to it because whatever
[1:36:12] everybody has said or somebody can say
[1:36:14] you've heard it already but what did it
[1:36:17] do in your life because one thing has to
[1:36:20] have an effect for on you for you to be
[1:36:22] able to enjoy the next one and keep
[1:36:24] enjoying
[1:36:25] it
[1:36:28] Hallelujah I'm reading from conferences
[1:36:31] with
[1:36:32] God because that's what Joshua did he
[1:36:36] start a conference he called for a
[1:36:38] timeout and start conference with god
[1:36:41] brother says like our brother here in
[1:36:42] the wheelchair like may maybe you
[1:36:45] sitting there with cancer or with a
[1:36:48] heart trouble or something that you know
[1:36:50] you are going to die right away the en
[1:36:53] enemy has stopped you he brought you to
[1:36:56] a
[1:36:58] halt so in essence only the enemy can do
[1:37:03] that maybe you come to a a halt before
[1:37:06] the enemy overtook you maybe there is
[1:37:08] something in your life that's caused you
[1:37:11] to hold whatever it is you are you are
[1:37:15] still have the privilege of a conference
[1:37:18] let's talk it over with him let's do
[1:37:20] something about it no matter what the
[1:37:23] end enemy is he's never too great for
[1:37:25] our God we need a conference amen
[1:37:31] hallelujah so I thought to go this way
[1:37:33] because many of us might have similar
[1:37:37] questions but let's understand
[1:37:40] it it's not as if we asking God that oh
[1:37:44] I want this car so bad Lord help me to
[1:37:47] get it no we are not asking God to help
[1:37:49] us achieve our
[1:37:51] aim this was the people and what they
[1:37:55] were Desiring to achieve great as it is
[1:37:58] was first and foremost the purpose of
[1:38:00] God and still they go forward and they
[1:38:04] fail right so it is yielding ourselves
[1:38:07] to God in either to see his own purpose
[1:38:10] fulfilled in our
[1:38:12] lives and God's purpose for that time
[1:38:15] and For That season was to see the
[1:38:18] Promise he made to Abraham fulfilled for
[1:38:21] these people and when God God has a
[1:38:24] purpose brothers and sisters nothing
[1:38:26] stands before him
[1:38:40] Hallelujah I'm reading from the reproach
[1:38:43] for the cause of the
[1:38:44] Gospel brother says do they realize is
[1:38:47] that same devil that said come off the
[1:38:49] cross and I'll believe you turn these
[1:38:51] stones into bread and I'll believe you
[1:38:53] it see that's the same devil that tied a
[1:38:56] rug around our Lord's eyes and hit him
[1:39:00] on the head with a stick and said now if
[1:39:02] you're a prophet tell us who hates you
[1:39:04] and will believe you well you know he
[1:39:07] know who hit him he could have turned
[1:39:10] those stones to bread or he could have
[1:39:12] come off the cross but what would we be
[1:39:16] today if he
[1:39:18] had and that is the
[1:39:20] key see the don't know the program of
[1:39:25] God you must find out what God has
[1:39:29] promised Hallelujah so even we would
[1:39:32] have liked God to come up down from the
[1:39:35] cross and get all the people to repent
[1:39:38] but you see for my Deliverance for my
[1:39:40] salvation it takes the blood amen
[1:39:43] hallelujah and so much as that was
[1:39:46] tempting he defied it completely and
[1:39:49] humbly surrendered to death so that you
[1:39:51] and I will be sitting here today
[1:39:54] Hallelujah and so nothing stands in the
[1:39:58] way of the purpose of God hallelujah
[1:40:00] praise the name of the Lord
[1:40:04] amen God has a
[1:40:07] program it's often not consistent with
[1:40:10] what we
[1:40:10] want but it's always better than what we
[1:40:13] even dream of amen
[1:40:17] hallelujah and I want to say this that
[1:40:19] he has a program
[1:40:21] today and when he has a purpose like I
[1:40:25] said nothing stands in the
[1:40:27] way you see God had a purpose to deliver
[1:40:30] the people out of
[1:40:33] Egypt and when the time came and the
[1:40:36] season came Egypt was the most powerful
[1:40:39] country on
[1:40:41] Earth understand that they had become
[1:40:43] very powerful thanks to the fact that
[1:40:45] they rallied around a gift of
[1:40:49] God Joseph came through and in the
[1:40:53] raised him up to the position of prime
[1:40:55] minister he was running the
[1:40:58] government and so they had an excellent
[1:41:00] tax system thanks to Joseph they had an
[1:41:03] excellent economy thanks to Joseph they
[1:41:06] had an excellent farming system thanks
[1:41:07] to Joseph and they had an excellent food
[1:41:10] storage system thanks to Joseph and they
[1:41:13] built upon it and they kept building
[1:41:15] upon it if you go and R and oh yeah
[1:41:18] Africa we had this and it understand it
[1:41:21] it was because at some point in time a
[1:41:25] people rallied around the gift of God
[1:41:28] and always when you see and recognize
[1:41:30] the gift of God and you rally around it
[1:41:33] you receive the blessings that come with
[1:41:34] that
[1:41:35] gift what happened was that the people
[1:41:39] themselves the children of Israel were
[1:41:42] prospering as Egypt prospered but it got
[1:41:46] to a point that people looked at them
[1:41:48] and said these people are too great if
[1:41:51] we are not careful they will overrun us
[1:41:55] they will take over and so they started
[1:41:57] maltreating them they started enslaving
[1:42:00] them now when people do that to the
[1:42:02] children of God understand it that is
[1:42:04] the time of the
[1:42:06] Fall now I don't say that it's not just
[1:42:09] Egypt you remember um um
[1:42:12] Nebuchadnezzar's Place Babylon it was
[1:42:15] the same thing they
[1:42:17] [Music]
[1:42:18] saw Daniel they recognize the gift in
[1:42:22] him when once more they raised him up to
[1:42:24] the position of prime minister these
[1:42:26] people are just
[1:42:28] smart right didn't they do that in
[1:42:30] Persia too to modai it's the same thing
[1:42:33] but they raised him to the position of
[1:42:35] prime minister and from that position
[1:42:37] Babylon prospered and prospered but the
[1:42:40] strangest thing about Babylon worse than
[1:42:43] Egypt was that in just one
[1:42:45] generation in the by the time of
[1:42:50] belazza the the king did not even know
[1:42:54] Daniel he and that tells you the
[1:42:56] direction was going he had gone so far
[1:42:59] from God that he did not know
[1:43:01] Daniel and so he's there he's relaxed
[1:43:05] he's drinking oh bring the vessels from
[1:43:07] the house of the Lord of the god of
[1:43:10] these is people of Israel and then he
[1:43:13] gets it and then they start praising the
[1:43:15] gods of silver and the gods of gold
[1:43:19] understand that that is when the fall
[1:43:21] came but when they handwriting came on
[1:43:24] the wall he saw it he couldn't interpret
[1:43:26] it he called for all the wise men to
[1:43:29] come Daniel was not among them when they
[1:43:32] couldn't explain it and his legs were
[1:43:35] shaken he still didn't know where to
[1:43:37] turn to until the wise queen mother came
[1:43:40] around and said Relax there's a man in
[1:43:42] your kingdom who does that and the queen
[1:43:45] mother reminded him that that man was
[1:43:47] the head of the wise men and your
[1:43:49] father's time so in just one generation
[1:43:53] had completely forgotten
[1:43:57] about praise the name of the
[1:44:00] Lord
[1:44:05] hallelujah in just one generation they
[1:44:08] had completely forgotten about
[1:44:12] Daniel and that was just when their fall
[1:44:15] came so our
[1:44:19] prosperity or our failure depends on
[1:44:23] what we do with the word of God that we
[1:44:24] have received we are not like any other
[1:44:27] people
[1:44:29] hallelujah so what am I saying that it's
[1:44:32] a privilege for God to reveal his
[1:44:35] program for the time and the season that
[1:44:37] you live to you but then it comes with a
[1:44:41] responsibility and that is what we have
[1:44:43] to be very careful about because instead
[1:44:47] of being a blessing it could turn out a
[1:44:49] curse if we ignore why God revealed it
[1:44:54] to
[1:44:55] us
[1:44:59] hallelujah but in any case Egypt with
[1:45:02] all its might could not stop the move of
[1:45:05] God the Red Sea with all its might could
[1:45:08] not stop the move of
[1:45:10] godam talks about it in such a very
[1:45:13] special
[1:45:15] way it says it was said one time that
[1:45:19] Israel was walking in the line of duty
[1:45:23] to a promised land and right in the line
[1:45:25] of duty the enemy come and back them up
[1:45:29] in a corner and the Red Sea cut them off
[1:45:32] from the line of duty and in their March
[1:45:35] and God looked down from heaven through
[1:45:39] the pillar of fire and and the Sea got
[1:45:42] scared it rolled back its waves because
[1:45:45] God's waves was in the bottom of the sea
[1:45:48] and it made way for his children walking
[1:45:52] in the light of obedience Hallelujah and
[1:45:56] so nothing stands in the way of God when
[1:46:02] he has to fulfill his will to his chosen
[1:46:04] people but now watch this contrast that
[1:46:08] it says they were walking in the line of
[1:46:11] obedience so what how much
[1:46:14] power was displayed there something that
[1:46:18] had never been seen the world had never
[1:46:20] experienced anything like that that they
[1:46:22] see open
[1:46:23] for a people to walk through and what
[1:46:26] that comes for whom a people who were
[1:46:29] walking in line of
[1:46:31] obedience what I'm saying is should
[1:46:33] there be any reason why we should
[1:46:35] disobey God if we know that obedience
[1:46:39] could lead us to the such a
[1:46:40] demonstration of
[1:46:42] power hallelujah
[1:46:45] amen nothing stands in the way of God's
[1:46:48] plan and God's program amen hallelujah
[1:46:53] now there was this pursuing
[1:46:55] Army and I'm just mentioning this just
[1:46:58] to confirm the fact that nothing really
[1:47:00] stands in the way this Army had rejected
[1:47:03] the word of God in Egypt they had
[1:47:05] opposed it they had even persecuted the
[1:47:08] Believers and now they're following them
[1:47:11] and they following them and they say oh
[1:47:13] the people are trapped suddenly the
[1:47:17] supernatural camps they see the place
[1:47:19] the the see open and the people walking
[1:47:22] in them these people had children they
[1:47:25] had the sick they had the elderly they
[1:47:28] were walking on the floor these were an
[1:47:32] army they know how to March better than
[1:47:35] mad
[1:47:37] doers they had horses they had
[1:47:41] chariots and so they look at it they say
[1:47:43] why not if they can do it why not us and
[1:47:46] so they get in but you see Israel had
[1:47:50] gotten in on the word of God
[1:47:55] Hallelujah so in essence these people
[1:47:58] wanted to enjoy the
[1:48:01] benefit of the Gospel without living the
[1:48:07] life and you see this is what I'm saying
[1:48:10] when you see Vindication don't go after
[1:48:12] the Vindication go after the
[1:48:14] life because when the life is lived God
[1:48:18] will vindicate it Hallelujah
[1:48:28] in Israel and the church brother BR says
[1:48:30] and that's what's going to happen one of
[1:48:33] these days brother when the separating
[1:48:36] times come and I know that is here and
[1:48:40] now and to you you look home church
[1:48:44] member that you are trying to
[1:48:45] impersonate
[1:48:46] Christianity one of these days you are
[1:48:49] going to try to
[1:48:51] follow oh okay
[1:48:53] one of these days you are going to try
[1:48:54] to follow that Holy Ghost band and
[1:48:57] you'll find out your wheels will come
[1:48:59] off out y in the mudy
[1:49:02] samary that's right there was 10 virgins
[1:49:05] went to meet the Lord five of them were
[1:49:07] wise and five fish put oil in your lamp
[1:49:12] trim hair bright one of these days they
[1:49:15] are going up and there was weeping and
[1:49:18] wailing and nashing of teeth and those
[1:49:21] uncircumcised Egyptian I why couldn't
[1:49:24] they make it they wasn't
[1:49:28] circumcised they wasn't in the
[1:49:31] Covenant if they had been circumcised
[1:49:34] Believers God would have had to
[1:49:36] recognize them the same way as he
[1:49:38] recognized Israel Glory doesn't that
[1:49:42] excite you amen he didn't say oh if they
[1:49:45] were Jews if they were children Hebrew
[1:49:47] children
[1:49:48] no all that mattered is be part of the
[1:49:52] Covenant
[1:49:53] and God will vindicate you the same way
[1:49:58] Hallelujah so I said don't ever imitate
[1:50:01] Divine
[1:50:04] Vindication yes because when the life is
[1:50:07] lived God will vindicate it and so they
[1:50:11] were all drowned why God was in the
[1:50:15] process of profilling his promise to his
[1:50:17] chosen children
[1:50:19] Hallelujah so when one identifies his or
[1:50:22] her own place in the
[1:50:24] Bible according to the word of the Lord
[1:50:27] as his
[1:50:29] chosen nothing stands in the way of what
[1:50:31] God has spoken about praise the name of
[1:50:34] the Lord I could be talking about how
[1:50:37] much they faced hunger and God brought
[1:50:39] Mana from Heaven how much they face
[1:50:42] thirst and God brought water from the
[1:50:44] from from The Rock but we all know all
[1:50:47] of these things and but what I'm getting
[1:50:50] as right now is this
[1:50:53] that all these experience Were Meant to
[1:50:55] tell them that God means just what he
[1:50:58] says
[1:51:00] hallelujah I'm going to be reading
[1:51:02] Exodus 32 sorry there there's a lot of
[1:51:05] reading today I'm going to be reading
[1:51:08] Exodus 32 and I'll just pick so that we
[1:51:11] don't we don't go on for a long
[1:51:14] time but you see this is the other side
[1:51:17] of it that nothing stands in the way of
[1:51:19] the purpose of God yes but they also had
[1:51:22] to experience what it means to sin
[1:51:24] against God what it means to go against
[1:51:27] the word of God and all of this was part
[1:51:29] of their training now on the surface it
[1:51:31] looks like that is what they
[1:51:33] experiencing but what was really
[1:51:35] happening and I just want to take the
[1:51:37] time to explain this even I I today I
[1:51:40] intend to finish
[1:51:41] quickly what was happening was that from
[1:51:44] the journey from Egypt and to the
[1:51:47] promised land the space in between that
[1:51:51] is where Israel was
[1:51:53] there were two forces acting on them
[1:51:56] there was the force of bondage and
[1:51:59] slavery which at some point they thought
[1:52:01] was their reality it's pulling them back
[1:52:04] it's pulling them back into bondage it's
[1:52:06] pulling them back into slavery that is
[1:52:09] Egypt and then there was the other
[1:52:11] promise of the promised land now what
[1:52:14] had happened was that God had gone ahead
[1:52:16] of them and brought to them all that he
[1:52:19] had prepared for them in the form of
[1:52:22] promise
[1:52:23] and says there is a land out yonder is
[1:52:26] Flowing with milk and an if you trust me
[1:52:29] I'll send you there but that's all they
[1:52:31] had the word and so the reality of
[1:52:34] slavery was higher and so until you take
[1:52:39] all of Egypt out of you because you see
[1:52:43] it's easy to take them out of Egypt but
[1:52:46] it's not easy to take Egypt out of them
[1:52:49] and until you take Egypt out of you you
[1:52:51] cannot inherit the Promised Land
[1:52:54] Hallelujah and I believe that is where
[1:52:56] we are we need to get Egypt out of Us
[1:53:00] Praise the name of the Living
[1:53:04] God
[1:53:08] exodx
[1:53:09] 32 I'm starting from
[1:53:12] 21 it says and Moses said unto Aaron
[1:53:15] what did this people unto thee so this
[1:53:18] is a time and sorry way back in Exodus
[1:53:22] 12
[1:53:24] Moses they had come to Mount Si and
[1:53:27] Moses had received the LW and he had
[1:53:30] given it to the people he spoke it they
[1:53:32] heard it he told the others they heard
[1:53:34] it and then God came down and there was
[1:53:37] clouds and all of the manifestations and
[1:53:40] the people got scared and they said Lord
[1:53:42] uh Moses don't let God speak to us you
[1:53:45] go listen and come and tell us and so
[1:53:48] all of this had happened and now Moses
[1:53:51] is separated he go goes to the mountain
[1:53:54] and for 40 days they don't hear from him
[1:53:57] and when the people were separated from
[1:54:01] their Prophet they sought leadership in
[1:54:05] man and It produced The Golden
[1:54:09] Cal I'll just stay there because that's
[1:54:11] not the purpose of this but understand
[1:54:14] this and so after
[1:54:18] that God sees what is going on and sends
[1:54:21] Moses down and so this is when all of
[1:54:24] that had happened Moses had come he had
[1:54:25] seen them worshiping the golden Cal he's
[1:54:28] very displaced the Lord is very
[1:54:29] displaced and so this is where this
[1:54:31] interaction is going on Moses said unto
[1:54:34] Aaron what did these people unto thee
[1:54:36] that thou H has brought so great a sin
[1:54:39] upon them and Aaron said let not the
[1:54:41] anger of my Lord Works H thou knowest
[1:54:44] the people that they are set on Mischief
[1:54:48] for they said unto me make us gos we
[1:54:50] shall go before us for us for this Moses
[1:54:53] the man that brought us up out of the
[1:54:55] land of Egypt we would not what is
[1:54:57] become of
[1:54:59] him so now you see that idolatry of
[1:55:03] Egypt for just the slightest reason is
[1:55:07] coming
[1:55:13] out we know no matter how far you go you
[1:55:17] can never possess the promised land when
[1:55:20] there's Egypt in you
[1:55:24] right and so all these people paid with
[1:55:28] their
[1:55:29] lives Hallelujah am so but where I want
[1:55:34] to point to the danger is that it's not
[1:55:37] just those who did it and that is easy
[1:55:39] for us to rationalize it that's easy for
[1:55:41] us to say oh yeah they they they
[1:55:43] worshiped idols and they died but what
[1:55:46] is the effect on the rest of the
[1:55:48] congregation and this is what I want us
[1:55:50] all to think about how how does it feel
[1:55:52] like who here wants to be responsible
[1:55:54] for killing
[1:55:56] another not just you in your room or you
[1:55:59] no no you step outside go to your
[1:56:01] neighbor and put a sword through
[1:56:04] them and so much as these people died
[1:56:08] it's not any easy on the entire
[1:56:10] congregation praise the name of the Lord
[1:56:12] amen and let's imagine you kill somebody
[1:56:15] do you kill their children or do you
[1:56:17] leave their orphans them orphans and if
[1:56:20] you kill them maybe their children also
[1:56:21] went to work you kill them your children
[1:56:24] now know that you killed their
[1:56:27] friends there was no Pleasant situation
[1:56:30] in
[1:56:31] that but you see when you are part of a
[1:56:34] body your actions have consequences on
[1:56:37] the entire body let's be mindful of
[1:56:41] that
[1:56:43] Hallelujah I'll just read this uh the
[1:56:45] same Exodus st2 I'll read uh 25 to 28
[1:56:55] then Moses stood in the gate of the camp
[1:56:57] and said who is on the Lord's Side let
[1:56:59] him come unto me and all the sons of
[1:57:02] Levi gathered themselves together unto
[1:57:04] him and he said unto them thus says the
[1:57:07] Lord God of
[1:57:09] Israel put every man his his sword by
[1:57:13] his side and go in and out from the
[1:57:15] gates and through out the camp and slay
[1:57:18] every man his brother every man His
[1:57:20] companion every man his neighbor and the
[1:57:23] children of Levi did according to the
[1:57:26] word of Moses and they fell on the they
[1:57:30] fell of the people that day 3,000 men so
[1:57:35] understand it 3,000 men still holding on
[1:57:38] to the bondage of
[1:57:43] Egypt but still the good thing is there
[1:57:46] are people who were committed to the
[1:57:49] service of the Lord and when you are
[1:57:51] committed to the service service of the
[1:57:52] Lord you put your shoulder to the
[1:57:56] wheel they didn't allow social
[1:57:58] expectations to influence them they had
[1:58:01] to do it and they did it it's not always
[1:58:05] pleasant but it is life for us
[1:58:10] hallelujah I'll just give another
[1:58:12] example and then we I'll be done with
[1:58:14] this Reading part numbers
[1:58:18] 25 and this time it's after Israel bam
[1:58:24] balak they
[1:58:26] encountered uh Israel came BAC couldn't
[1:58:29] control them he called for help from Bam
[1:58:32] Bam came he tried to curse them and as
[1:58:35] long as they were in the
[1:58:37] camp he couldn't car them so Israel was
[1:58:41] supposed to stay in the camp and belac
[1:58:44] Bam watches over it and it's a spiritual
[1:58:46] man and he descends that there is only
[1:58:48] one way you can condemn these people and
[1:58:50] that is if you get them to displease
[1:58:52] their
[1:58:54] God is the same today the devil is
[1:58:57] seeking to get you to displease
[1:59:00] God and it's for us to take a stand and
[1:59:03] say no to the devil Hallelujah if we are
[1:59:06] ever going to possess anything of the
[1:59:09] promises that God has given us we need
[1:59:12] to take a
[1:59:13] stand I'm reading numbers uh
[1:59:17] 25 and isra Israel in shim and the
[1:59:21] people began to commit hom with the
[1:59:23] daughters of Moab and they called the
[1:59:25] people onto the sacrifices of their gods
[1:59:27] and the people did eat and bow down to
[1:59:30] their gods and Israel joined himself
[1:59:33] unto Balor and the anger of the Lord was
[1:59:35] kindled against Israel and the Lord said
[1:59:37] unto Moses take all the heads of the
[1:59:40] people and H them up before the Lord
[1:59:43] against the son that the fierce anger of
[1:59:46] the Lord may be turned away from Israel
[1:59:49] Moses said unto the judges of Israel
[1:59:51] slay ye every man everyone his men that
[1:59:54] were joined onto
[1:59:57] Bal so again the judges had the
[2:00:00] uncomfortable job of killing their own
[2:00:03] people but it was necessary to keep the
[2:00:05] sanity of the camp otherwise the camp
[2:00:08] will be there without God and when you a
[2:00:11] Believer without God you are the most
[2:00:13] helpless of all on Earth hallelujah amen
[2:00:17] so sin is an action and it has wages and
[2:00:21] the wages of sin his
[2:00:23] death Hallelujah so before we take any
[2:00:27] step first of all how does it affect the
[2:00:30] collective and how does it affect your
[2:00:33] brothers and sisters and how does it
[2:00:35] affect the program of God now in both of
[2:00:38] these in instances people paid with
[2:00:40] their lives but you see that did not
[2:00:43] stop God hallelujah because still
[2:00:47] nothing stands in the way of God's
[2:00:49] program praise the name of the Lord
[2:00:51] nothing stands when God is proving his
[2:00:53] way to his chosen people but there is a
[2:00:56] cause for
[2:00:57] Disobedience
[2:00:59] Hallelujah now how come the program of
[2:01:03] God that could not be stopped by Egypt
[2:01:06] could not be stopped by the Army it
[2:01:08] could not be stopped by the Sea it could
[2:01:10] not be stopped by the the walls of
[2:01:14] Jericho how come such a program
[2:01:18] suddenly has come to a halt
[2:01:22] what is it a babylonish
[2:01:25] garment a babylonish garment that is it
[2:01:28] you see how we are love the little
[2:01:30] things to get in the way of God's
[2:01:32] program a babylonish
[2:01:35] garment and all the devil
[2:01:38] did was to get aan to believe that you
[2:01:42] could still have the Garment and be in
[2:01:45] the
[2:01:45] camp think of it as we go
[2:01:49] ahead all the devil did was to get them
[2:01:52] to believe that you could have the
[2:01:54] Garment and be in the
[2:01:55] camp but before God it was either
[2:02:00] or it's either you have God on the camp
[2:02:03] in the camp or you have the babylonish
[2:02:06] Garment praise the name of the Lord why
[2:02:09] it was an accursed
[2:02:11] thing I'm reading here from
[2:02:15] presuming a can't of this little old W
[2:02:17] it won't make any difference the rest of
[2:02:20] the ladies are cutting their hair I'll
[2:02:22] do the
[2:02:23] same watch that it w't make any
[2:02:26] difference but what did it do it never
[2:02:28] brought pleasure to his family it
[2:02:30] brought death to every one of them and
[2:02:33] when we compromise on any commandment of
[2:02:35] God to please the people we kill the
[2:02:37] thing right there one little witch one
[2:02:42] Babylonian government stopped the
[2:02:44] marching Army brother one thing that we
[2:02:46] permit the church to do that is wrong
[2:02:50] one thing that we would't call out
[2:02:53] against and make the people straighten
[2:02:55] it up it'll stop the march of the
[2:02:58] church they presume you are going on you
[2:03:01] may be in name we may be in numbers that
[2:03:04] ain't what counts that isn't what counts
[2:03:07] is God With Us God in us God moving
[2:03:11] through us his word alive in us
[2:03:16] hallelujah so pretending that God are
[2:03:18] not spoken about it or pretending that
[2:03:21] it does doesn't matter or it's too minor
[2:03:24] for God to think about and pretending
[2:03:26] that God didn't mean it when he spoke it
[2:03:29] or even saying that it is subject to
[2:03:33] interpretation Brothers before we go
[2:03:35] ahead Haring the laugh of the world
[2:03:38] think of it again how does it affect the
[2:03:41] program of God and how does it affect my
[2:03:43] brothers and sisters
[2:03:47] Hallelujah I'm rushing to finish in
[2:03:51] adoption brother Braham says God made us
[2:03:53] a promise and there will be nothing hurt
[2:03:57] us our enemies will fall out our feith
[2:03:59] he's talking about Joshua now and
[2:04:01] there's something wrong here something
[2:04:04] went wrong somewhere cuz we got 16
[2:04:07] dead dead man laying there they are
[2:04:10] Israelite brothers and they are dead why
[2:04:12] did they die innocent man because one
[2:04:16] man stepped out of line you see the
[2:04:19] reason this needs to be taught
[2:04:23] Hallelujah and that's why I'm standing
[2:04:25] here the reason this needs to be taught
[2:04:28] one man gets out of the line and it's
[2:04:30] part of the body it has an impact on the
[2:04:33] rest of the body that's right
[2:04:35] Hallelujah the church lining up lining
[2:04:38] up with the word of God lining up with
[2:04:40] God and lining up with each other
[2:04:41] walking perfectly upright soberly before
[2:04:45] all man fearing God because one man
[2:04:48] stole a garment and done something that
[2:04:51] he should not done took the life of 16
[2:04:55] man I think it was 16 maybe more and so
[2:04:59] says it but I I I I I there is a little
[2:05:02] part that I want he also said right
[2:05:04] there that I want to add that when we
[2:05:06] bring the sick be up before us and they
[2:05:09] fail to be healed we need to call a
[2:05:12] Solem fast call an assembly something is
[2:05:16] wrong somewhere God made the promise God
[2:05:19] God's got to stick to that amen and
[2:05:22] he'll do it amen praise the name of the
[2:05:25] Lord am so the word of God caed for
[2:05:28] total
[2:05:30] separation God said don't touch
[2:05:33] thean and he meant what he
[2:05:37] said may the Lord help us not be not to
[2:05:40] be the ones to bring a ho to his
[2:05:42] program Hallelujah because you see the
[2:05:46] people were defeated because of their
[2:05:48] cursing all the people were being
[2:05:50] defeated because of the are Christ now
[2:05:52] when you bring that to the camp you are
[2:05:54] bringing the feet to the camp but worse
[2:05:57] than that is that you are bringing you
[2:06:00] are getting God out of the camp
[2:06:04] Hallelujah now brother Abraham visits an
[2:06:07] observatory and he's commenting about
[2:06:09] the Zodiac and this that's in the
[2:06:11] message the greatest battle ever
[2:06:13] fought and I don't know much about
[2:06:16] astrology but speaks about Leo and Virgo
[2:06:19] and all of that but there this part
[2:06:22] where it says and I thought then if that
[2:06:24] great Heavenly Host like that has to
[2:06:27] keep its place to make everything in
[2:06:29] order what about the disorder of the
[2:06:32] Earthly
[2:06:33] host how when one gets out of order how
[2:06:37] it throws the whole thing out of kater
[2:06:40] the whole program of God is upset when
[2:06:42] one member gets out of order we should
[2:06:45] continually strive to keep the order of
[2:06:48] the
[2:06:50] spirits and so just quickly when we look
[2:06:53] at this
[2:06:54] program when we look at this babylonish
[2:06:59] garment they also used to call it what
[2:07:01] the mantle of China and even the other
[2:07:04] versions of the Bible uses that it's not
[2:07:07] just an old Shepherd's cloak no it's a
[2:07:10] very stylish garment it's classic it
[2:07:14] represents luxury it represents status
[2:07:18] they lead in society among the canites
[2:07:20] wear it
[2:07:22] and and and the interesting thing is
[2:07:24] when they wear it they don't fall down
[2:07:26] convulsing to
[2:07:28] death when they wear
[2:07:32] it they don't get stricken by by by by a
[2:07:37] thunderbolt when they wear it nothing
[2:07:39] happens to them in fact they are
[2:07:43] admired aren't we humans just like
[2:07:46] them and that is what we should ask
[2:07:49] ourselves right
[2:07:52] and you look out there and when people
[2:07:56] put on their makeup they are not
[2:07:58] offending
[2:08:00] anybody and they don't die and there are
[2:08:04] female ministers putting on their pants
[2:08:06] and their makeup and getting into the
[2:08:09] pulpit and nothing happens to them
[2:08:12] aren't we humans like
[2:08:16] them you know most of us interpret sin
[2:08:19] in terms of how it affects us or it
[2:08:21] affects
[2:08:22] this and we fail to realize that the
[2:08:26] most important thing is how does God see
[2:08:29] it hallelujah
[2:08:32] amen and so we F to realize that we are
[2:08:34] chosen people for a Divine
[2:08:38] Purpose and when we say a Divine Purpose
[2:08:41] what we are saying is this it's not we
[2:08:45] doing is God doing through us so in our
[2:08:50] hearts they always have has to be room
[2:08:52] for the Lord to Reign and when God comes
[2:08:55] and he's not leading he's not even here
[2:08:58] praise the name of the Lord we may
[2:08:59] convince ourselves that he is but he's
[2:09:02] not and so if there is any Egypt in us
[2:09:06] let's get it out
[2:09:13] Hallelujah now let's look at this
[2:09:18] situation Israel got into the uh Red Sea
[2:09:22] they passed
[2:09:23] through Egypt got there passed through
[2:09:26] and
[2:09:28] died now the canites are wearing these
[2:09:31] babylonish garment now imagine it's very
[2:09:33] expensive because from Iraq and that
[2:09:36] this that was not a there was no pilor
[2:09:38] or DHL there they had to use horses and
[2:09:42] everything so for that to come all the
[2:09:44] way from Iraq to Israel think about
[2:09:47] it but they wear it and they admired
[2:09:50] Israel it and they are dead understand
[2:09:53] it we are different people and it's the
[2:09:56] call that makes you different and when
[2:09:58] you fail to acknowledge the call you are
[2:10:01] denying your own
[2:10:03] identity you want to be happy you want
[2:10:06] to feel free go the way of the message
[2:10:15] Hallelujah aen must have thought that
[2:10:17] this little this little thing doesn't
[2:10:19] matter much
[2:10:21] but if God said it then it
[2:10:25] matters Hallelujah there are many times
[2:10:28] we see things that are
[2:10:30] useful in the world that are harmless in
[2:10:34] the world and so we consider what the
[2:10:37] word of God says about and we don't
[2:10:39] consider what the word of God says about
[2:10:41] it and yet that is what matters
[2:10:44] most and we are tempted to bring it
[2:10:48] right into the midst of the people
[2:10:52] time is far spent but in the story of
[2:10:56] um numbers 25 that we read the
[2:11:00] continuation of the story was
[2:11:02] that a one of the children of Israel
[2:11:05] brought a medanite woman into the camp
[2:11:07] and the Bible says in the presence of
[2:11:09] Moses he did that but you see there was
[2:11:12] somebody who was zealous for the things
[2:11:14] of the Lord Finas took a javelin and
[2:11:17] thrust it through the two of them and he
[2:11:20] killed both of them right and the Lord
[2:11:22] was pleased with
[2:11:24] finus
[2:11:26] Hallelujah and so it's up to us to know
[2:11:29] and decide the line that we are going to
[2:11:31] th Hallelujah but when God makes his his
[2:11:35] T clear and it's for us to to that line
[2:11:39] Hallelujah we cannot go home and turn on
[2:11:43] and listen to this worldly music and
[2:11:44] listen to this and on and on and on and
[2:11:48] expect to have Victory and expect to
[2:11:50] possess the land it doesn't happen that
[2:11:55] way I think in prophets it says shall a
[2:11:58] man take fire and not be
[2:12:01] burnt praise the name of the
[2:12:04] Lord what is our disposition when we
[2:12:06] come to church you know last week I I
[2:12:09] picked a cookie rapper there and and and
[2:12:15] I was with I was with another Deacon I
[2:12:17] showed it to
[2:12:18] him and and you see the the the the
[2:12:21] bigger problem is not because there is a
[2:12:23] cookie wrapper there it's a church it
[2:12:25] will be
[2:12:27] cleaned but if that is our attitude when
[2:12:29] we come to church
[2:12:31] yes how do we expect to receive from God
[2:12:35] to eat in the
[2:12:37] sanctuary yeah maybe it was given to a
[2:12:39] little person who knows right but the
[2:12:45] bement would work it will serve the same
[2:12:47] purpose but should food be brought and
[2:12:49] used in here
[2:12:52] and so let's be mindful of these things
[2:12:54] if you really know that you wouldn't do
[2:12:56] that at the office of whoever a mayor is
[2:12:59] or the
[2:13:00] premere should we bring that to the
[2:13:03] house of the
[2:13:05] Lord respecting the sanctity of the
[2:13:10] sanctuary you
[2:13:12] know somebody has come here and not
[2:13:15] everybody can come every day somebody
[2:13:18] comes once in a month Maybe twice in a
[2:13:21] month or once a week and then they're
[2:13:25] here and for them to tune in and get
[2:13:27] what they can get from the
[2:13:29] Lord oh yeah we are going to sit with a
[2:13:32] kids so to
[2:13:34] see and completely distracted when
[2:13:38] sometimes not always sometimes all it
[2:13:40] takes is holding the
[2:13:42] hand and nobody else will be distracted
[2:13:45] should we bre the people bringing
[2:13:47] putting a ho to the program of God to
[2:13:51] somebody receiving from the Lord
[2:13:54] hallelujah let's honor the sanctity of
[2:13:57] the sanctuary praise the name of the
[2:14:00] Lord Brothers you
[2:14:04] know we are responsible for everything
[2:14:06] that happens in the house
[2:14:09] everything and as a
[2:14:12] man a family man over a family of five
[2:14:16] it's not easy for me to even stand here
[2:14:17] and say
[2:14:19] this but you see we love our
[2:14:22] wives the truth is they don't have four
[2:14:25] hands and three
[2:14:27] legs so it will help if I can hold one
[2:14:31] for her to hold the
[2:14:33] other then the children are a we able to
[2:14:36] contain
[2:14:37] them if even look I'm the more spiritual
[2:14:41] in my house I'll take all of them sister
[2:14:45] listen so that you'll be an even better
[2:14:48] wife than you have been to me it helps
[2:14:52] it doesn't help when we think that oh
[2:14:54] it's in it's our tradition and this
[2:14:58] no we are responsible for it let's hold
[2:15:02] on let's honor the sanctity of the
[2:15:04] presence of the
[2:15:06] Lord because there is a benefit there
[2:15:09] and when you recognize it and you do it
[2:15:12] that way one of the best benefits is
[2:15:15] that our children watch
[2:15:19] us and the way we behave in the house of
[2:15:21] the Lord it'll reflect on them it's way
[2:15:25] more than the what we tell
[2:15:27] them praise the name of the
[2:15:31] Lord these children they grow
[2:15:35] quickly at the time you bite your eye
[2:15:37] they are taller than you and you are
[2:15:38] talking to them up
[2:15:44] there presuming bam say he presumed that
[2:15:48] it was all
[2:15:49] right but go God's commandment will take
[2:15:52] nothing out of the curity don't have
[2:15:55] nothing around you that's cursed then
[2:15:59] how can we smoke
[2:16:00] cigarettes how can women cut their hair
[2:16:04] God says that when they do that it's
[2:16:07] wrong how can you wear these little old
[2:16:10] trousers of a thing that you wear when
[2:16:13] God said women a woman that puts on a
[2:16:17] garment pertains to a man it's an
[2:16:19] abomination in his side God don't
[2:16:23] change how can we do it and it's just
[2:16:26] pre presuming that's all right it's not
[2:16:28] all right it's not all right our
[2:16:32] Pentecostal women does a thing like that
[2:16:34] you better stop and check up shake
[2:16:37] yourself look
[2:16:43] back you know it's it's it's been about
[2:16:46] I don't know how many years but let's
[2:16:48] forget about that there was a service we
[2:16:50] held in that Community Center and the
[2:16:51] brother came around gave a powerful
[2:16:54] testimony I suppose the brother was from
[2:16:55] Manitoba and I I may get these details
[2:16:58] wrong but I I'll convey the import of
[2:17:02] what happened his testimony was about
[2:17:05] the wife being sick for a long time and
[2:17:08] Home Care was coming and it was getting
[2:17:11] worse and then when they prayed about it
[2:17:14] the Lord spoke to him that if you don't
[2:17:15] stop the gossip it's not going to get
[2:17:17] well and when he stopped the gossip in
[2:17:20] the after of a week the wife was
[2:17:22] discharged from home care right so that
[2:17:25] little thing was holding them from
[2:17:28] possessing that
[2:17:30] promise God does not change my brother
[2:17:34] God does not
[2:17:35] change you know I have been in a meeting
[2:17:37] and I know I've said this so many times
[2:17:39] and I I'll probably skip a few things
[2:17:42] and then and then
[2:17:46] close I have been in a
[2:17:49] meeting that I had had just become a
[2:17:51] message
[2:17:52] believer and in this this those times on
[2:17:55] at Christmas time we will all gather at
[2:17:57] some place isolated place and do fasting
[2:18:00] prayer meetings Easter will gather at
[2:18:02] one place and do fasting prayer meetings
[2:18:04] and they bring this girl around
[2:18:06] completely out of her mind shouting and
[2:18:09] in Chains and everything and they GI her
[2:18:13] are praying for her and they're praying
[2:18:14] they're praying and then the prophecy
[2:18:16] comes and IT addresses the mother
[2:18:19] directly you are in involved in a landed
[2:18:22] litigation that is why your first child
[2:18:25] died and if you don't stop this one will
[2:18:29] also
[2:18:31] die and so right there the woman says
[2:18:34] that's it she's done with a with a land
[2:18:36] indication by the time the meeting ended
[2:18:38] there was prophecy that the girl has
[2:18:40] been
[2:18:40] healed and we were all glorifying God
[2:18:43] and everything it was an evening
[2:18:46] everything right the next morning the
[2:18:47] girl was still the same even went by
[2:18:50] back home in it took
[2:18:53] months before she came to herself what
[2:18:56] happened why am I in chain and then they
[2:18:59] explain her situation to her she was
[2:19:01] delivered but you see we shouldn't allow
[2:19:05] things representations of Egypt to get
[2:19:09] in the way of our
[2:19:11] work because until Egypt comes out of
[2:19:15] us we are not making it to the promised
[2:19:17] land
[2:19:22] I will get to I'll will call the
[2:19:26] musicians all I'm saying at this point
[2:19:30] is let's understand that there is a
[2:19:33] reason everything
[2:19:35] happens if we get here this
[2:19:38] morning and we try the door to the to
[2:19:41] the church and it's not
[2:19:43] opening we don't just assume oh yeah
[2:19:46] it's
[2:19:48] it's the church doesn't says there is no
[2:19:52] church no there is something wrong with
[2:19:56] the door and we have to find out what is
[2:19:59] wrong we have to call where is the God
[2:20:02] we read of in the Bible where is the god
[2:20:04] of William Braham Hallelujah because
[2:20:07] this message declares far greater
[2:20:10] promises than we live as children of God
[2:20:14] and brother Braham says we live below
[2:20:16] our
[2:20:17] privileges but so long as it is promised
[2:20:20] to us and we have identified ourselves
[2:20:23] as recipients of these promises then we
[2:20:26] have to live in expectation of it
[2:20:29] Hallelujah because we possess literally
[2:20:31] the very final promise of humanity
[2:20:36] Hallelujah God has spoken so many
[2:20:39] beautiful things to
[2:20:45] us and we need to treat it as such
[2:20:51] we have to go ahead and possess our
[2:20:56] inheritance and if we believe it if we
[2:20:58] know this is the inheritance and we
[2:21:00] really believe it we'll just go forward
[2:21:02] and take
[2:21:04] it but if we don't we may work our way
[2:21:08] out of our
[2:21:09] inheritance and that is the serious
[2:21:12] position may make the fleshly desires
[2:21:15] may get out of the
[2:21:17] way Hallelujah I remember when they do
[2:21:21] it will not stop God it will only stop
[2:21:24] us hallelujah these promises we read of
[2:21:28] our inheritance let's go for it shall we
[2:21:32] be on our
[2:21:37] feet just have to cut a few things here
[2:21:42] let's s Standing on the Promises
