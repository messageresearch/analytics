at home I want to thank everyone for making the effort to come out on a Saturday night we all live busy lives and uh I know it's the only day of the week we really get to get stuff done but there's a blessing in store for each one coming out to the house of the Lord and uh we're really honored tonight to have brother Danny delondo from Manila Philippines here it's his first time in Canada and we're certainly thankful to have him here he was our host when we were there in January and uh they just treated us like family it's just amazing so we are uh certainly thankful to have him here a little disappointed that his family couldn't come that was the intention from the beginning but it just didn't work out and we know that all things work together for the good to those who are called according to his purpose so this year is exactly what the Lord wanted tonight and uh we'll just gladly take it we know how it goes there's a gift in our brother if we go to pulling he'll go to preaching and you know just for the record we have not had any conversation so whatever happens tonight it's truly anointed of the lord we talked about a couple different things uh in terms of what we did when we were there and you know maybe a little bit at Brother mervin's house and what he's done there but that's all so when you hear the Holy Ghost tonight just say Amen because he wants to speak to you he wants to speak to all of us maybe we could just have a little word of prayer before we go further in the service tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness to each and every one Lord for this time I believe father that we could just turn around close the doors of the building even right now and be blessed father if we were to go home because we know that you're here with us father Lord just to be able to worship you the way that we have to have the desire in our hearts Lord Jesus how could we express to you our love love except for worship father Lord Jesus tonight we pray that you're just glorified in every aspect of our service Lord I pray that you would just pour without measure upon each one tonight father who's made the effort to gather together in Your Name Lord that you would just speak to us sovereignly father that you would meet the needs in our hearts father Lord maybe there's a sickness in our body maybe there's a need financially father maybe there's a marriage thing oh Father it could be anything in our life lives but there's nothing in this world that you can't meet father that you can't treat that you can't help us with and father as we've sung tonight we believe father but help thou our unbelief Lord Jesus we're stuck in this body this body of Flesh and the Devil comes around and tries to remind us of that all the time oh father I pray that tonight we could just remind the devil that it doesn't matter if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved that we have a body already waiting for us father we have have that theophany body and Lord help us to hear from that theophany body tonight we pray that you would be with each one here present be with those who are tuned in Father wherever we are father Lord we know that you're not bound by time or space father we just ask that you would give brother Daniel a fresh call off the altar Lord Jesus and father now that we've invited you here help us Lord Jesus to to to

say Amen with a willing Heart Lord oh Father we know that you have called us here and we have responded father so tonight we pray that you would just bring the speaker and the hearer together as one

only believe Lord we believe only believe only believe let all things are possible because oh Lord we believe Hallelujah that's the only condition the Lord do required us to just believe amen that's the ABC of our faith that we always believe Christ amen so we have come here this evening amen of course under expectation amen but I am nervously standing before you amen but let the Lord have his own way this evening amen as we approach his throne of Mercy I bring greetings from the Philippines and from my family which supposedly we should come here together but it's just didn't work out the way we wanted it but the Lord amen has uh the best plan for all of us so we just agreed that we will be moving our trip together if the Lord ties together probably this coming year amen so you just help us pray amen that's our heart's desire and if it's it is God's will God will confirm it amen amen so you just be with me at times English is not my first language uh you know sometimes before we speak we have to process that in Tagalog and then before we throw it amen so but the Lord will help us amen I remember that uh what brother brandham said there was a boy one time and he was he was relating the the alphabets and say a b c why is this you know and uh so he just because the alphabet is a combination of words amen and uh so the boy believed that he if if the Lord will uh combine all these letters he can deliver the message I believe I will just speak something out of my heart this evening amen the Holy Ghost work between us amen and whatever the Lord's lead Lord leads leads us this evening amen so so before I let you sit down let us go straight to the reading of the word this evening amen and uh we just want to uh so tomorrow we have another service and by God's grace you just want to lay a certain Foundation this evening amen so in Revelation chapter 4 uh thank you our precious musicians Amen in Revelation 4 4 6 up to8 it says here in verse 6 and Before the Throne where was a sea of blast like unto Crystal and in the midst of the throne round about The Throne were four beasts full of ice before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a cal and the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of ice within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come let me read verse 7 again as we will uh discuss this verse and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a cal and the third Beast had the face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word de evening dear dear heavenly father we approach your throne of Mercy this evening we humble ourselves before you believing Lord that we cannot do anything without you may you have your own liberty Lord and uh set aside your the servant this evening and may your word be delivered according to your perfect will Hallelujah we ask this Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord God bless you you may be seated amen so I'm glad to see also uh my fellow Filipino Brethren here amen of course uh we love the pedo family so much because we are a family amen uh so brother mvin have long been a blessing to the ministry in the Philippines uh he uh he and his family have extended uh burdens uh not only with my little Ministry but with other ministers as well and uh you know uh probably without you knowing it uh they've been involved in uh couple of uh churches Ministries in the Philippines and they are extending their gratitude of course uh we were so blessed with uh your pastor brother uh Barry and the family and it was such a special visit for the Believers and uh we pray that you will uh what that you will send your Pastor more often to the Philippines am uh because he had we've got visited uh few churches but uh his ministry had touched a lot of hearts and I believe his ministry will also be a help amen so I would like to speak something about uh the four pillars of our faith this evening four pillars of our faith and this uh come from verse S uh we have a subtitle which is four Throne guards uh so the the lion the ox or the Cal the face of a man and the Flying Eagle these are uh beasts amen and uh so nothing happened here on Earth that had not been declared in heaven first so uh when uh when the prophet Moses was being called by the Lord and he was instructed to build a tabernacle he the Lord uh declared that uh Moses you're going to build the Tabernacle according to the pattern that I have shown you in heaven amen so uh everything thing was patterned uh in heaven and as the pro as the prophet said you know the prophets they're not just although they see Visions because they're seers but actually not every time they have to see some Vision before them but being a witness because prophets are seers they're Witnesses amen the Lord has to put them in an actual situation and personally witness amen and that's the reason uh uh brother brandham can describe how the woman in the Garden of Eden look like amen because he was uh uh uh he was taken by God and placed in such an actual situation and see amen because in God there's because although God is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same in the same that he is The Great I Am Not the great I was not the great I will be because in the mind of God everything is present and so if God can only uh uh pick us where we are right now and uh uh uh Li us in a certain real amen we can see things that we are not seeing on a regular or daily basis of Our Lives amen so here uh so in this uh scripture in verse seven these are guards uh uh surrounding the throne and you can see that this that the prophet said there's nothing nothing happens here on Earth that is an accident uh so that's why the pattern you know the center the center is the Throne of God and then there are four Throne guards we have there the lion the Cal uh the one with the face of a man and the flying eagle and these are all symbols because the The Book of Revelation is a book of symbols amen so now it was a declaration from heaven and then when God instructed Moses to build the Tabernacle amen all the the the 12 tribes of Israel three in each uh uh in each side so they have banners and their banners you have Judah as the lion amen and then on each side all these banners they represent the lion we have you have the calp you have the face of a man and also uh uh uh the the eagle so this are the banners in each side of the Tabernacle now that was in the Old Testament and then when we move to the New Testament uh I have not heard anyone preaching about that but the prophet of God said the book of box is actually in the center amen and it is being guarded by the four gospels you have Matthew amen and Matthew uh if we analyze the writings of Matthew it speaks about the kingship of the Lord amen he's uh he's the king and uh uh uh Mark uh uh if we analyze the writings of Mark we will we will have some kind of a conclusion that Mark focus on the sacrifices of the Lord Jesus Christ him being the lamb him being you know the atonement and Luke being uh describe as the doctor amen among the uh poor right uh gospel writers Luke is the most educated that why is addressed he he's addressed as Dr Luke amen but John amen is the eagle among the group amen that's why John needs no introduction Amen in the beginning of his word in the beginning was the word amen no no further introduction in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God no explanation amen it's just meat amen so uh so you see we uh we see that and then uh uh now in in and this is what I want to to point out uh now in the human anatomy the human anatomy uh we see that the center is our heart amen it is the center and probably the students may may know this that in the heart there are four four entries we have we have the atriums we call that the atriums we have the right atrium and the right ventricle and then the left atrium and then the left ventricle so this is on the natural side the heart has has poor uh entries and then now the heart being the center is being guarded also the heart must be guarded and it is being protected and even our ribs right we have 12 ribs on this side we have 12 ribs on this side amen just like the throne in heaven the center is the throne and then we have 12 Elders on one side we have 12 Elders on the other side so nothing happens by accident amen so the Lord has designed everything uh uh uh so what I'm trying to say that God has declared something in heaven amen and then went down to the Old Testament moving forward to the New Testament and now it's moving to the Sons and Daughters of God Amen so being Believers being sons and daughters of God Amen there is something that we guard and that is we need to guard our faith all right so uh that's why we uh uh uh and and and four you know four brother bham said in the Revelation uh preaching in his Revelation in chapter four he said now remember God's guards of the ark or The Mercy Seat so there are four Throne guards and there are four Throne uh uh guards also so in in in in The Mercy Seat now he said now he seen four two four living creatures now watch they both seen the same vision and four is the number of Earth did you know that how many knows now before we have to go into it four is an Earthly number like the four Hebrew amen uh I mean during uh the time now say it's a number of Earth n four is a number of Deliverance cuz I'm going to strike it just a minute he said real heart Deliverance now there were three Hebrew children in the F Peres amen but there was amen when danger come and because the the the three uh young men Shadrach mesak and Abednego stood their ground amen they were thrown amen but because they believe it doesn't matter what happened amen he said you know we uh uh the Lord that we worship is able to deliver us from this F furnace amen and look what kind of Faith these three young uh uh young men he said you know he's able he's more than able to do that but even if amen but even if we die even if something happened to us I mean if you throw us in this per Peres amen hallelujah we will not change our faith we will stand our ground we will not worship the image AG amen and God saw that Amen in God you know uh uh the the there were there were Angels the archangels were uh uh asking Lord amen would you just let these three young young people suffer this kind and they will die that kind of death amen and so uh uh uh one of the archangels said you know wormwood probably said Lord amen you called me on the scene when your judgment will come during the time of Noah we did that and we can do it again am I can just open one uh source of water and that that that fire will be faced out amen but God in heaven said no am amen and so an angel probably Gabriel amen Lord if you don't allow wormwood I can take action for that amen but said no no no no it's not you and probably Michael pulled his sword and said Lord probably this is my time amen the third but the fourth man said but the God said no no no not one of you will do that I'll be the one to do it amen so he was the for man in the ferace amen so that's why when they see the port man in the Peres it was like the Son of God Amen so now you see uh H uh so four is God's number of Deliverance John or or or or Lazarus amen he died uh first day second day third day amen on the fourth day everybody was thinking it's too late but God is never too late he always come on time because he is on top of our schedule he is absolute for everything amen so he came on the fourth day and it was not too late Hallelujah so everything so we see God so we see that God uh uh uh uh for is God's number of Deliverance now in the uh uh uh the preaching of brother Brenham the restoration of the Bride tree he said there were four death Angels amen who killed the tree and there must be for Life angels that will restore amen so that's why four is actually God's number of Deliverance and I like this statement of brother Bram he said now in the fifth seal he said uh uh and when we went on God gospels and show exactly when you enter into the ark they were guarding the ark the Covenant and then we find out that the Covenant of the new church is a representation on Earth was the Holy Spirit the blood that sent back to us the Holy Ghost and the four beasts represented the 12 tribes of Israel as it was and finding their natures and taking some nature and bringing it to each one of those four gospels exactly was exactly the same so it came down from from from the old amen and then onwards to the to the New Testament and until Amen to the human anatomy we see the design of the Lord now in in Revelation chapter 4 he said now remember God do some guards for that for that Mercy Seat Mercy Seat what is that Mercy Seat they guard amen Matthew on the East Luke Mark John all their gospels vindicate the book of Acts to come they guard it anywhere you want to amen so now it's the same thing now in the message presuming let me allow me to read some statements here before we go further now he said in the message presuming now why if there was something that was going to harm you physically you do everything in the world get lawyers attorneys and everything else to protect yourself get a bodyguard if your life was threatened this is on the natural aspect and brother brandham speaking now if your life is in danger amen you need you're are going to do everything to protect yourself get a bodyguard if your life was threatened everything else you would do it now what about your soul your eternal life is affected amen and I and we believe that in this generation in this day and age amen the bride is under attack our faith is under attack amen and we should protect our faith amen but but actually we're not protecting our faith but but God has power and God given us power to protect this Fai God is more than able to protect the seed that he had laid in our hearts amen and so these are four the four principles amen and uh uh uh we want to uh to show that these are the things that we do amen number one what what actually uh in our faith amen the first pillar of course we see that the lion amen and we see that all these things are the anointing of the Lord amen the Lord released this power we see this in the church ages amen when uh when the spirit of the Antichrist entered crept into the church ages amen he it was riding on a white horse that's why the denominations were deceived believing that was Christ because it was Christianity impersonation amen so we see that from that lion you know the the the the Antichrist Spirit was so silent although it was already in the church after 20 years of perfection the spirit of the Antichrist was already working it's just right there but the anointing was so strong from the Throne of that God which was the lion but it only takes time amen that Antichrist Spirit was just waiting for something amen but so when he moved to another Power amen from the White Horse he moved into the uh uh to the red horse amen uh representing and then then then the the Believers were being marted so forth and so on Amen but God sent another anointing and so the historian could not understand why these people could give their lives like that and how could God that they worship we'll just look at them and watch them suffer amen and and and historian could not believe how could they stand all these kinds of H H uh persecutions and sufferings and murderd them amen but the only reason was God Amen sent the Beast sent the power for them to h h h uh to stand all those persecutions they could not stand it on their own but it was the power from the Throne of God Amen that was anointed that anointed these believers amen I I read a certain story that have happened during that time and he said there was a father there's a family during that uh persecution time and there's a one one family amen the father on one corner of the uh on one side of the table and on the other side amen the mother and on both sides amen are their kids amen and the the the young boy about 12 years old was the Elder and and and the father was talking now uh listen to me son amen and uh the church is under attack amen the the uh those who who who don't believe what we believe amen they're killing our brothers and I know that my time is coming one day probably right at this very moment the soldiers are coming to our house and they're going to get me and kill me and this this father said to his son but remember this son don't be afraid because even if they kill me I'll just close my eyes and when I open my eyes I'll be on the other side amen that's what the father said and then here comes the soldiers and they kick the door amen and then suddenly they pulled the kid and the father said hey what are you going to do with my son amen we're going to kill him he said no just kill me not my son it's my son amen and the father the mother was surprised were surprised they were not expecting that probably it's the mother it's just something Norm But Here Comes the son amen about 12 years old and the father was pleading please don't amen but you know the devil the devil knows how we will suffer more sometimes the devil take our children amen sometimes you say Lord just get me because I can stand this test not my son not my daughter amen just just let me face the devil because I can stand it but when we see our children amen being being pulled by the devil out there in the world or something amen it affects our faith amen but the father and the mother was surprised when the son said father you just stole this morning amen not for us not to be afraid because father even when they kill me after this as you tell me as you tell me I just close my eyes and when I open my eyes I will be in the presence of the Lord that you're praying this preaching this morning and mean it's the same thing amen so now all those kinds of sufferings Amen the the PE the the Stans were so surprised how could they stand these kinds of persecution amen because it it's the the Beast it's the power that was sent by the Lord from his about his throne amen and then came you know when they uh uh uh come the time after this persecution they They confiscated all the Bibles and history and that that was the time of the Dark Ages amen now it's a different style of the devil because from the red horse now he moved to the Dark Horse and it from from the EC ecclesiastical power to deceive and then he moved to the political power and then he moved to the spiritual realm amen which is uh uh uh uh uh but you see now God knows what he is doing and all things work together for good to them that love God Amen and so he sent another Beast of power another anointing here sent amen not the lion not just the uh uh uh the ox but now amen he sent wisdom and that's why we have heard of Spurgeon all these Calin noxs amen they were Anointed with such a wisdom Amen to battle the anointing o of the false uh uh Christ in that day amen to to to overcome amen that Dark Ages amen but thank God in this day and age that we are are living amen because uh we're now pacing the the demons amen and he rode in a Pale Horse amen which is a combination of the three amen now the Antichrist can speak spiritually religiously amen and he has power also political power and he's also connected amen so all these combination and how can an ordinary believer an ordinary uh so-called Christian can face the devil in this generation amen that's why the Lord has given us the Flying Eagle anointing not just an eagle but the Flying Eagle anointing amen so let let me just simplify this now in these four pillars of our faith just like what we did amen we come here we worship amen and you know Judah is a lion and sometimes we see we we imagine that Judah is a warrior but you know Judah belongs to the lineage of the musicians amen and in the order of battle the musicians go first amen so we come here that's that's that's the thing that we do that's why we come here even with the simple uh instrumental because it sets the atmosphere we come here with due respect and while the musicians are playing that's why anyone that is playing music amen they're not just good musicians but the pastor amen knows who to place who to approve to sit down here because we set the atmosphere it's not just music it's worship amen it sets the thone I mean it's like it's like a a dry a dry soil that is being teed that is being cultivated just like the heart that is hard amen and because of the the the the spiritual music the atmosphere that is being set amen the hard heart becom soft amen the hard soil the dry soil is being soaped and and and and teed amen and and and in that way the soil that is being cultivated is being prepared for the sea to be dropped because the seed is the word amen and so now that's why you see the lion you so you see sometimes it's it's a it's an instrumental music it's so soft something like that but the anointing you know remember remember during the time of soul in 1 Samuel chapter 16 in verse 23 and it came to pass when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul that David took an harp and played with with his hand so Soul was refreshed and was well and the spirit and the evil spirit departed from him it's not just instrument amen but it's it's the mechanics and the spirit that is upon the musician that plays the Dynamics of it amen because whatever is in the life of the musicians you know that's why you know we just don't allow anyone I don't care how good a musician is amen if he played last night in the club or something I don't care amen we don't care but we're after the life of somebody who plays the instrument amen because it is something the vibrations the spirit the life that is in the musician is being played not just the skill but the gift amen is working the anointing the life amen is being uh uh you know is being uh impressed through the instrument that he or she is playing and because of that the atmosphere the evil spirits and brother Bram you know it's not how you know how our voices are so loud you know now we loud we worship aloud when we feel that way amen but brother bham said no it's not it's not just like that but it's the lived yes voices amen that is what the devil hates and afraid of it's your life amen so that's why from the musicians to the instruments amen and and and and the Believers who worship amen and so when somebody enters here amen probably somebody sick somebody has has has burden am mean some somebody is so problematic but somehow through the anointing through the inspiration that is being built up within the sanctuary it Chang the atmospere amen and then after that you know that's why amen after we hear the word once again we just don't go out and you know okay class dismiss right amen because after you cultivate the soil you drop the seed amen and then you water it down again hallelujah amen and so that's why we just we just don't rush after the service the preaching is is very nice we say Amen to the word of God but you see we seal that amen with the form of worship amen hallelujah because it brings something amen that is when amen the word of God being preached sink in our hearts and and and the life the spirit that is uh uh contained by the word that we here transform it to the lives that we have amen so that's why you know we don't uh uh uh get paid musicians here but we get musicians that are paid by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so now that's the lion anointing in the church that's the pillar of our faith amen you know just like a mother in the house you know sometimes you go go out the father works the mother is just right there in the house amen and then the father comes in the afternoon tired in the work and but sometimes we're guilty amen sometimes I go to the mission and uh and and you know it's tiring in the mission but we sometimes I feel guilty that thinking all the things all the suffering all the all the sacrifices that you do in the mission field but you know our our our wives also suffer amen we don't know what's happening in the house amen but you see the mother in the house amen sometimes you feel all this burden all this was stuff all the dirt that you have when you have renovation in the [Laughter] house and then the whole day you see there the mother see all these things and and then you have to wash clothes laundry you have to uh uh you know amen but what makes the mother the believer a believing mother do amen sometimes you you you uh you have that kind of self-pity because you're alone in the house doing all these things amen but suddenly you start saying start worshiping and sudden it change the atmosphere amen and then it lightens your load and the work amen that you're going to do is no more a work amen and so when you start worshiping amen hallelujah and then the ironing uh you know you you you go along with the the the the tune of the music and you enjoy what you're doing amen and before you know it before you uh you finish amen the the second or the third song and then you start worshiping and that brings another atmosphere amen you're no longer and before you know it you have cleared everything and you're no longer tired and when your husband comes what do you want honey amen worship that's our lion that's the lion of our faith John was was thrown in the aisle of Patmos he was alone it was miserable and he was thrown there because he stood his ground in the faith and brother there was nothing good in the alop Patmos if you can see creatures there you can see probably scorpions and there now Beauty in that the ruins amen but no matter what kind of place no matter what kind of circumstances we are in when the spirit of worship comes amen all this Earthly atmosphere amen hallelujah all this uh creatures that are so unwanted probably amen but suddenly when when when John started to worship he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day amen it's no longer a human day but through the kind of worship he was being lifted up come up higher John he was lifted up in a certain real and then he see things amen the Earthly things that he saw now he started to see Heavenly things he started to see not just the current situation he is in he didn't see the sufferings that he was in but he's seeing things amen God made him understand I'm going to show you things that was which is and which is to come just worship amen hallelujah so you just remember what whatever kind of situations and you know you know we We Worship the Lord not just in the things not just in the situation where everything goes in our Direction where everything every plan that we have am mean is happening right on the dot it's easy to worship you know when you go out and you're going to the market and you have money to buy something amen hallelujah but when it's the other way around but let me tell you it's the kind of Worship the Lord is looking for when Paul and Silas were preaching the word they were arrested amen look he said and the multitude rose up together against them and the Magus r sent off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the Jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sng Praises unto God beaten wounded and you know after your being wounded in a few minutes without any medication it started to bring give you pains amen hallelujah and all these pains are coming in but in the midnight amen Silas said Paul was looking at their wounds but Paul said Silas don't look at your wounds It's Time To Worship it's time to praise the Lord amen wounded beaten they were they were they they look like they're miserable amen and yet it's time when that it's time to worship Hallelujah under the Pains of all the wounds that they had amen now they started to to to stand and raise their hand and started to praise the Lord amen Hallelujah and it set the atmosphere amen and you know what happened during the time of their worship their worship Hallelujah they worship so loud that the other prisoners in the other side of the wall and the other prison cells amen heard the way they worship and it set an atmosphere and their voices their loud worship did not only reach the other side of the cell but it reached up to heaven that the Lord said sent angel down and broke the cells Hallelujah and and and release those prisoners Hallelujah remember if Saul amen could experience that the theil spirit was upon him but due to the the the the spiritual instrument the harp amen that David and because of David's life that goes with it it drives out amen the evil spirit that was upon upon Soul amen and if that kind of worship in the prison house amen could could break the walls amen and and all those that were imprisoned were released will you know we're we're placed in Freedom how many how many amen no more no more preaching yet amen amen just worship hallu just the atmosphere amen just just setting the condition of the heart amen you know uh hard-hearted people become lighthearted it changed the situation a sinner is being freed out of sinful life amen thank you Lord Jesus amen so don't don't set aside our worship our Praises amen and do this not only during good times but worship Him in Good Times worship Him in bad times amen hallelujah our god never changed so our attitude towards God Amen should not change also amen hallelujah so he changed the condition and now amen so uh uh now moving on so of course our Serv service is not just worship it's just one part it's just one pillar but there are four pillars of our faith amen but that's the lion don't say you're you're singing a soft song Amen but that has lion anointing and it can drive out the evil spirit amen hallelujah and now the the second uh uh the second is the ox which is the Cal amen and we know that the ox it is a burden Bearer amen uh you know that's why uh uh the prophet said among the team in the fold Ministry the pastor is the ox of the team and you have to realize that not because I'm a pastor but the pastor is the ox of the team if there are 100 souls in the congregation the pastor has 100 problem souls to burden amen and the the uh uh the Saints beyond the curtain of time they said you know uh that they will be they will be presented by the prophet amen what about the pastors amen I know it I'm a pastor sometimes there are situation that we could didn't even tell to our wives amen issues of one family against another amen those you know people that that you know as as pastors we may not say it directly but you know what I'm saying brother Barry we know the condition of our congregation we know where you are in the faith amen but there's something that upsets that and that is through the intercession of the pastor the pastor is the ox of the team you remember when Moses was uh this a good example in the in the book of Exodus uh when when God get tired of the people of Israel and the Lord said unto Moses I have seen this people and behold it is a stiff neck people 32:9 it is a stiff necked people now therefore let me alone that my wrath May wax cold hat against them and that I may consume them and I will make of thee a great nation look God was about to set judgment upon his people and Moses will be promoted you see he said now H I may consume them and I will make of thee a great nation and Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why do why W thy wrath waxs hat against thy people which thou Hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say for Mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the Earth so God was being I don't know if I can say questioned amen but Moses asked the Lord Lord why are you going to do this the Egyptians will laugh at you Lord you delivered them out of Egypt you let them cross the Red Sea and now you're going to kill them Lord look in verse 12 he said turn from thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people Moses ask God to repent turn from thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people H look at the position of the Prophet amen look at the position of the pastor in the church amen when when when when Jesus said to Peter whoever you loose in on Earth will be Loos in heaven whoever you bind here on Earth will be bound in heaven people just don't know amen it's not in nikonian spirit it's not something it's not an authority that you know we abuse but it's the position that the Lord amen I would say if people only understand that the pastors are more powerful than Angels who among the angels can say what Moses said Lord repent of thy evil thought against your people turn from thy Fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people remember Abraham Isaac and Israel thy servants to him thou swearest by thine own self and say unto them I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed and they shall inherit it forever amen but actually it's not the prophet here but you know brother brandham said amen when the prophets when the Servants of the Lord are in the rightful position it's not them per se but it's God in them amen he said that was God in Moses that was God in David that was God in Elijah amen so in in in other words this is the other side of God Amen a merciful god amen but God being a king God being a judge amen has to say what he has to say but there is another side of God and it is being expressed by his prophet and he said Lord why should you do this you have delivered your people the egyp Ians will laugh at you amen and you know what God did he killed Moses he did he he do that look in verse 14 and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people Ox anointing standing in the gap between judgment so the ox amen the ox anointing in The Believer the ox anointing in the church is to stand in the Gap it is intercession and the ox anointing the ox inspiration in a Believer is the power of be prayer amen we just don't pray Lord thank you for everything amen sometimes you know in social media they have all these kinds of emoticon amen and somebody please pray for me pray for my sister amen and somebody will click that emoticon that goes like this prayer is not just an emoticon prayer is intercession brother when we pray when we pray for somebody that is sick we place our position what if you are in that position what would you feel how would you pray when you are in that condition we just don't pray but we need to be identified with somebody that we are praying for you put yourself in the condition you enter in brother bham said you're an ox you bear the burden hallelujah amen so that's why in Luke 21 he said in verse 36 watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man amen in other messages brother bam said prayer changes sickness to health changes Sinners to Saints it's prayer you may laugh too much you may shout too much you may eat too much but you will never pray too much H it's something that we cannot overdo praying amen I remember one time uh when uh when Billy Graham was was a student and he had a professor named Professor art and uh uh during his student days they had a field trip and they they they went to uh uh to London in and and where the house of John Wesley was and they entered into the house of John Wesley and uh so they show The Kitchen they saw everything until they entered into the room and this is say this is the room of John Wesley this where he stays so forth and so on and then the young Billy Graham noticed something and he saw a pair of marks at the side of John Wesley's bed and Billy Graham asked asked what are those pair of marks and the uh the tour guide said oh that pair of that pair of marks in the carpet amen those were the marks of the knees of John Wesley that's the same spot where he leaned when he wakes up in the morning before he uh he retired in the evening spent hours praying that's why it left a mark pair of Mark at that spot and it's stri something in the heart of Billy Graham that when they went they went about to leave amen so the professor counted his students and there was one was missing and so the the the professor stopped the driver and he went he went up and uh he he went directly to the to the room of John Wesley and he saw Billy Graham kneeling on the same spot at the side of the bed he he paced his pair of knees on the same spot raising his hand and he and and and Professor heard said Lord please do it again and do it in me amen and you know the rest of the story amen you see how the ministry of of of Billy Graham went as as much as far as you know the age of uh uh John Wesley was called the age of missionary age amen and look at the ministry of Billy Graham amen it is if not if not uh more it's at least close and until now his ministry amen but look the Lord has given us more than Billy Graham and there is something more that we should be you know uh I I believe Billy Graham as the right thing because that's the only thing that he can get Lord do it again and do it in me amen but God sent forth a prophet not to do again what John Wesley did but did but we have we were given word to move forward to step into the prophecies Amen in this generation and why we can why why can't we spend more time in [Applause] prayers and brother bham said if there is anything that is a powerful uh uh uh tool amen he said uh in the message expectation so we believe that prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the care of a human being you know prayer one time changed the mind of God Amen we remember Hezekiah am mean Hezekiah amen he was sick of course we know the story amen and and that sickness will put him to death but because of his prayer it changed the mind of God Amen because of the powerful tool that Hezekiah used amen that's the anointing that we have in our faith that prayer can is a protection amen prayer can protect job prayed for his children Amen brother Benham said you know you might have a a a a a a h h a daughter a son amen and he said if you believe your safety and that's we can apply the token I mean he said you can claim your daughter you can claim your son you can even claim your father just like Rahab he claimed his whole pH whole family amen as long as we stand our ground and we don't get tired of praying the protection is not only for us it can protect our whole family we can apply the token in prayer if we bear the burden Hallelujah so that's why when we pray amen sometimes we pray we don't get tired of praying we spend time because we bear the burden yes amen so these are the kinds of prayer that God is looking for prayers that are being felt prayers that have really burdens in the hearts of the people am amen thank you Lord the third pillar of our faith amen is the face of a man amen and what's the man amen now let me put a scripture on this uh he said in Proverbs 23:7 for as he thinketh in his heart so is he in Revelation chapter 4 again brother Benham was being asked he said uh uh you remember remember recently the papers given given in Chicago about four years ago when the old believer old unbeliever rather used to say that God made a mistake through Solomon when he said as a man thinketh in his heart said there's no mental faculties in the heart to think with how could he think with his heart maybe he meant his head but brother bam said if God would have meant his head he would have said head but God through Solomon said as a man think it in his heart amen because a converted person does not think through his head think it in his heart because in our hearts is where the seed lays amen it is it is something that is predestinated right there and you know that in the later studies we have what we call the DNA and they said that the minds of a person uh can be changed because the mind can be programmed amen and I said amen so you see all this studies amen you know amen proves something that God is correct he can never fail amen so you know a man when he's being unconverted not yet being born again he think it by his mind his education all the information are being analyzed amen the way man is thinking but a man when he is converted he think it through his heart amen because now when you realize who you are when we re when we realize what kind of seed we have we realize that we are Sons and Daughters of God and we should think we should conduct ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God Amen so now when that seed recognize who his father is amen now you're no longer thinking through your mind but all the potentials that is in the seed will influence your mind and it will change it will program reprogram amen and you will think the way God thinks you will you will you will you will speak the way God speak because now the changes come from inside because now you realize who you are amen so now amen uh so that's why amen because the heart brother B said now the first Throne was in heaven judgment seat the second Throne was in Christ the third Throne is in man yes so God is dealing now in his third throne and what is the third Throne the heart amen amen that's why many people will miss this the Rapture one foot distance only just one foot amen because they believe God in their mind but don't believe God in their hearts amen they know everything in the message they have a lots of information amen but that did not change their mind did not change their life amen they don't know how to conduct themselves amen you know that's why we're talking this morning you know uh uh you know we we need to get the the the the the thinking of God we need to to understand the message the way it is being delivered by the prophet because when the word was being delivered to the prophet amen he had the right attitude amen so sometimes you know sometimes I see uh uh sometimes I check also I'm not uh I'm not uh uh I don't spend so much time on Facebook some but sometimes I need I I peep into it and sometimes I see people that they're so good in quoting you know and they will quote uh uh Church cannot save a man the pastor cannot change a man amen there's nothing wrong with the coat but when somebody is not going to church and he is quoting the statement you know what's coming one day you're not going to see this man again because that's the way he thinks amen there's nothing wrong in the code there's nothing wrong in the statement and we know where the prophet of God is coming amen hallelujah because brother bham said it's not my desire it's not my intention that people may follow me I will be happy if I see a man man amen has established a personal relationship with Christ amen but so it's not the man but God used the man to establish a relationship with God Amen and so God you see now so we have to guard all these things we have to guard our hearts amen and in our in our heart you see now now what is a man he's a TR being Body Soul and Spirit how many knows that what's God's approach what is his heart you remember my message God chose a man's heart for his control tower the devil chose his head for his control tower see he makes him see things look through his eyes God in his heart makes him believe things that he cannot see God is on his heart the heart of man is the Throne of God Amen so God that's why God sent a prophet in the ministry of Malachi 456 to restore the heart to restore the faith amen because when you see amen when God gets the heart of his son it's done amen so when we give our hearts to the Lord God has full control amen and so that's why he wants to stay in the heart and uh uh so you see so the heart that's why during the time of Elijah his ministry was to restore he repaired the altar amen he repaired the altar now after repairing the altar his ministry was not yet finished amen so that's why the word amen the message has turned our hearts back our faith is being restored back amen and Elijah amen when he came to the to the ministry and he faced all these challenges in uh uh uh uh in that in that mountain amen so he faced these hundreds of denominational ministers amen and the first thing that he did he repaired The Altar and you know this message come from the Lord but it must be received with the right heart so the heart must be restored first back to God so when we come here what does music what does worship do it establish our hearts to make ready and we feel when we feel the anointing when we feel the atmosphere people people that sets us in the atmosphere of repentance asking for forgiveness asking for reconciliation it it it restores our heart amen because if our hearts is not ready the word will just stay in the mind of the people will just excite us because of the new information that we have but it's not a revelation but Revelation is dropping here into the hearts so the hearts must be restored first amen so it must be prepared because when when when when when Elijah repaired the altar his ministry was not yet finished the next thing that he did was to lay down the evening sacrifice on top of the repaired altar now what I'm saying here we may worship ship you know in the denomination they can set an atmosphere and people can jump can shout can cry as if the angels and I would say they can invite Angels down they can invite the presence of the Lord probably because of their emotions because of these things amen they invite Christ because they're calling on the Lord but it is just like Simon inviting the Lord in his house house but he is not welcome amen so what good is the worship amen so dispay musicians dispay uh uh uh uh uh uh instruments whatsoever they can establish an atmosphere that that can make people cry that can make people really worship God believing that they're worshiping God because they could feel that God is just right there somehow it could do amen amen but after the worship the preacher will say Okay praise the lord we have worshiped the Lord amen I don't need to preach anymore because we feel the presence of God let's keep on worshiping so it's just like cultivating the soil and watering it but there's no seed amen but so that's the same thing when the altar was being repaired the fire did not come down yet amen but the fire came down when the evening sacrifice was laid down amen and so now God Amen God Amen was called amen by by Elijah the prophet and so amen God came down and consumed that offering consumed that sacrifice Hallelujah so repairing the altar re restoring our hearts back to God did not end up our service but something must be laid on top of the altar on top of the heart on top of the amen must be the pure word of the Living God the revealed word of the hour amen because that is what God is looking for amen and so now amen so you see in in in when we when when our hearts are right and we are in the rightful position amen I I remember uh I remember what uh uh one visitor that brother brandham made mention a tourist uh I believe that's in in in Florence he said uh he said John spra A friend of mine taking his wife in to took a trip over lorine France and the guide was taking them through a certain garden and he showed them a statue of the Lord Jesus and brother spra said he was looking at that statue he said what did the sculptor have in his mind why I don't see any sufferings of Christ I don't see nothing just look looks like the statue amen so they were looking probably at one one on one spot and the the face of the Lord was probably within their level and he said it does it doesn't convince me that it's a good sculptor because it's just normal you know you don't even sense and feel the suffering of the Lord so he criticized amen and uh the tour guide said uh yeah maybe because you're looking from the the wrong side not from the uh the the the the angle that you should see and he said you come closer and the tour guide you know guided sprowl and then he said you kneel down and then you look up and so when he knelt down and he looked up amen he saw the face of the Lord in that that was just an statue a statue but because he was in the right angle when he looked up he saw the face the actual suffering he said my heart he his heart broke down because he could feel amen because you know sometimes it's the same thing this message you know you go you you go on social media you go there are many ones who preach this message amen and if you will not we we we will not be uh careful enough amen many many people are being deceived amen because people are just right there reading the message but they have not an actual experience with this message of the hour but they can give details but they're not looking on the word from the right angle amen so I believe this message should come to our to to our hearts in the rightful conduct in the rightful attitude amen that we can kneel down and look up we can stay humble and be respectful amen and so that's why uh with those things so that's why John amen uh uh John is the eagle among the group and that's why he presented the word hallelujah so with all these things we cannot serve the Lord with only three pillars amen you may be prayerful you may be good in worshiping the Lord amen you may be good people may be good because the the the foolish virgins are also good but they don't have the word don't have the Holy Ghost they cannot make the Rapture amen but we need all these four amen worship yes but without the word it's just a cultivated soil amen and just grass will grow out of there but when the right seed is being drop there Son of God will grow the nature of the Living God will be made man manifest amen now when we enter into that closet into that room and he said you know uh uh it's not just the the room that we have but brother Benham said we that we have a hidden place anywhere brother Benham had to set himself away and be in peace with God and he said he described a certain place he entered in a certain cave amen and he prayed there and he could you know an angel some somehow amen he experience things that he could he has a sec sacred place to go to when he prays amen probably in one corner of our room one corner of our bed you know there's a certain place that we pray but this is not just a geographical location where we pray it's our attitude it's our burden amen that when we just like when we worship amen it's not just in good times but we worship also God even in the hardest situation we are in we have seen that in Silas and Paul amen and so we enter uh uh into the atmosphere of prayer we just you know when we when we pray we just uttering of course this is a communication but we realize you know brother bham said you know why our meetings are very successful amen sick people are being healed amen HHH many miracles have happened but you see but you know why there are women seven days already you don't see them but they're in prayers so brother brandham recognized the power of prayer he didn't say I'm because you know why there are many many people that are being healed because I am a Vindicated Prophet no he didn't say that he said you know why our meetings are successful because there are women behind the scene you don't see them but they are the prayer warriors not prayer warriors Warriors amen they just behind the scene but they pray they bear the burden Hallelujah you come here in the church sometimes we just clean in the house of the Lord amen it's like what I say to the cleaners on the church you know when you come here when you wash the floor and clean the chairs just don't pray just don't clean because you are in the house of God you come here prayerful as you hold the rags amen and just clean the chairs you know you we we we can put extra mile in doing things because of the prayers that we do amen how can we do that you lay hands on the chairs and say Lord I'm just the cleaner of the house I am the one scheduled to clean but Lord As I Lay My Hands on this chair whoever will sit here tomorrow amen if he is sick if she has a problem Lord please do something Lord take full control amen you know it's it's it's an ox anointing in you and everybody can do do it amen you come here you lay down amen Lord God I know Lord Jesus amen our pastors may be you know we don't know what situation he is in amen but Lord as he stands behind this Pulpit may you take full control oh God and the words of wisdom that will come out of his mouth will be Revelation Hallelujah that will change our lives that will change our lives Lord amen we can do more that's an ax anointing of a Believer amen you lay down on those on those doors and Lord amen may we come here tomorrow when we when we when we do service Lord may we come come in and as we come out May we become better than yesterday Ox anointing amen and you know prayers brother brandham said sometimes our prayers are not being heard because our hearts are not correct that's why we need to pray we need to think so if a man can think in his heart we can also pray in our hearts amen that we come and said you know the Lord Jesus said Lord I sanctify myself for their sake amen so the Lord Sanctified he deprived himself he deprived himself of a wife he deprived himself of a family during his Earthly time 2,000 years ago he deprived he said I sanctify myself for their sakes he deprived himself for the sake of us eternal life is living for others right attitude is the right life amen and so when when when all these things amen let me tell you the word of God when the when the Pastor whoever the man scheduled to stand behind the pulpit it's not the man it's because there were Ox in the team there were Ox in the church that have prayed already amen the musicians that have set the atmosphere it's not them it's the spirit of God it's all working and that's why the word of God will just come through it's not the man but it's God Hallelujah so if if brother brandham said if in this life you have to guard your life how much more our faith we need to guard our faith and these are the four pillars of our faith lion is our worship Ox is our prayers intercession heart is a clean heart a clean life restored that's why Paul said I Die daily he had had to repent daily he had to correct himself daily because he's preparing his heart for the word to lay down the evening sacrifice the word must be placed on top of the altar amen hallelujah now in closing you know what this word will do to us we know the life of Paul Amen in 1 Corinthians 15:9 he said for I am am the least of the Apostles that I am not meant to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God he said this in ad 59 he said I am the least of the Apostles when he recognized when he humbled himself amen he was persecuting the the Church of God believing he was doing Godly service amen but later on he received the word when when he met the pillar of cloud the pillar of light amen when he was about to arrest the people on his way to Damascus amen and so he humbled himself and he said I am when he humbled himself he said I am the least of the Apostles that's the reason you know I have seen many people they have received the message some of them are Theologian Bishops amen and they humbl themselves upon hearing the word it changed their condition it changed the direction of their lives amen they miss some opportunities that they should have enjoyed amen if they have not Le left the denominations that they were in they sacrific why because they humbl themselves amen but four years after that in Ephesians 3:8 this is said in ad 63 4 years apart after receiving the word after being converted by the spirit of of the Lord amen the same person Paul said after four years unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ four years ago he said among the apostles I'm the least amen four years after among the least of the Saints yes I am less what will this message bring to us humility God is looking for character God is looking amen God is looking for character amen so if Paul could humble himself I'm the least among the apostles amen but God promoted him and yet he said four years after he said Lord among the lowest of the Saints I'm the low I'm lower than them I believe whoever received this message just like brother brandham when he receiv received this message of the hour he is fully Vindicated by the Lord but look at the character they can question his Doctrine they could they have there are many people who have testified ministers we have seen people even in YouTube you can hear Benin testifying the ministry of brother Branham Tommy osbor testified on brother benam Gordon linday amen testified on big men recognize the ministry of because they cannot question his life amen people have not followed the message through but yet they could not question the life because his life has so much influence amen because the more you know when when uh when uh uh he testified on the things that have happened in Africa in in in India amen where you know this H H uh uh track loads of stretchers of wheelchairs and and crutches amen even the mayor testified what have happened during his Healing Ministry but all these things brother brandham said Lord I have done nothing yet amen but people just have done something so little and be proud of it but the prophet of God lord I have done nothing yet and he said Lord if it pleases you that you throw me in hell oh what an attitude amen if you if it pleases you amen that you can throw me in hell but said just one request Lord look down in hell where you throw me because even in hell
