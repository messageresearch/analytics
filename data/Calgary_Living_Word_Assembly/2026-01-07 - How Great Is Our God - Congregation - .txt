Description:
Splendor of The King, 
Clothed in majesty
Let all earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in Light, 
And darkness tries to hide 
And trembles at His voice 
And trembles at His voice

CHORUS
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God

On land and sea He stands
An Open Book in hand
Reveals the Son of Man
Reveals the Son of Man
Uniting time has come
The Bride and Christ are one
Soon we're going home
Soon we're going home

Unveiled before our eyes
The masterpiece of Christ
His love beyond compare
Love beyond compare
He chose Himself a Bride
Taken from His side
To reign upon His throne
To reign upon His throne

Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
Name above all names
You're worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing
How great is our God
