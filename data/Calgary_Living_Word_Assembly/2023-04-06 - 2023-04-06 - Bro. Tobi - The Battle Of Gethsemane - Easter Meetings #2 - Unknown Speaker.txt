expectations and the Beautiful part is many times he meets and exceeds our expectations it does way above and beyond what we could ask or think tonight we're so thankful that we can invite brother Toby to take the service and just Express What the Lord Has put on his heart and as I had mentioned you know I myself have been studying the last few weeks sort of the events leading up to the you know the crucifixion and the resurrection and you know Easter what it means to us and I just I don't think I could have said it better than brother Gilbert did last night than the Lord did through brother Gilbert last night what does the resurrection mean to us individually because that's the new birth that's what it is and you know what he he died and rose again 2000 years ago but that ain't good enough for today he has to be alive in us today he has to have a resurrection in our very lives today and then it's no longer us it's him you know I just couldn't help but think about it tonight and I don't want to take too much time we'll just sing that uh course again as we invite brother Toby but you know brothers and sisters it was a night exactly like tonight where they went into the garden and Jesus prayed for you and for me and we know the victory was one right there in that Garden it wasn't on Calvary and it wasn't in the Tomb it was in the garden where he laid down his will and that truly is the new birth and I'm excited to see what brother Toby has on his heart tonight we'll just invite him to come I'm Amazed I'm Amazed [Music] Through Your Precious Blood I promise [Music] your precious mind I know and myself [Applause] go away give me some monitor brother that'll be good God bless you welcome to church tonight let's just bow to pray first Dear Lord unto the Lord shall the Gathering of his people be what will our lives be like without Fellowship what will our lives be like Lord Jesus if we didn't have an opportunity to come to a place Lord Jesus Christ where fellow Believers are where we know Lord Jesus Christ are the demons that are troubling people Lord Jesus that we rub shoulders with when we go into our usual days at work dear Lord Jesus where we know we don't have to encounter those demons their lord Jesus we were in a place there father where people who have consecrated their lives dedicated their lives to the Lord are gathered together father that is the joy Lord Jesus has the peace that is the atmosphere we feel when we come to church and that is because you are here with us dear father Lord Jesus that's the beauty we are not gathered Lord Jesus just by ourselves father you said wherever two or three are gathered in your name you will be there in their midst Lord you are here Lord tonight we have no doubt we've seen you move Lord Jesus into some service dear Lord Jesus and we know Lord Jesus you will continue Lord Jesus to speak to us dear father to tell us something Lord Jesus Christ father that will build up Lord Jesus on what you did for us yesterday father we are not quick to forget their lord Jesus that you were here last night dear father oh Master we know you are here tonight Lord we know you'll be here tomorrow night Lord Jesus and we know you'll be here on Saturday night dear Lord Jesus you'll be here Sunday morning as well there father Lord Jesus to grant us the full blessings Lord Jesus that you add in store for us when you lay this on the heart of our pastor Lord Jesus to have those meetings we just want to ask you to take Lord full control Lord Jesus I mean sufficient Lord Jesus you know that father but just not the things you've laid in my heart dear Lord Jesus just bring it to your people yourself Lord in the way you want to say dear Lord with the details you want to bring dear Lord Jesus let it just be Lord Jesus fit in for the need of your people and we'll leave here thanking you for your mercies and your grace for in Jesus Christ's number for him amen amen a bless you musicians thank you very much I guess we could just read the word so I can have you take your seat for the very just uh print my message in two two sentences just before I came up here tonight I want to speak on the Battle of Gethsemane and that was such a good opening yesterday I said over the Gilbert the resurrection has to mean something to every one of us I was thinking about this in the room the entire life of Jesus has to mean something to us we have to get to that point where we start to see that same life in our lives so Matthew chapter 26 I'll read from 36 to 46 and then we'll flip over to Hebrews chapter 2. all right I'll start reading from verse 36. then come at Jesus with them onto a place called gethsemani and said unto the disciples City here while I go and pray Yonder and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy they said he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death here and watch with me and it went to little father and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this car pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt and he comes unto the disciples and finding them asleep and say it unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit is indeed willing but the flesh is weak went away again the second time and prayed saying oh my father if this cop may pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and then left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words and cometh he to his disciples and say it unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinus rice let us be going behold he is at hand the doeth betray me amen let's go to Hebrews very quickly chapter 2. verse 18. just that verse he said four in that he himself have suffered been tempted he is able to secure them that attempted amen the Lord bless the written of his word you may have your seats this sin that is before us today we find Jesus going to the guardian of Gethsemane well let's just step back a little bit and look at what had happened a few days prior I like to call this the third pool of the ministry of Jesus Christ where he was opening the word to a private group at this time he wasn't speaking to the entire World it wasn't speaking to all the people he wasn't even speaking to the Pharisees he was having a private conversation with his disciples and we know that even at that time I was thinking about that there was still one of them who was of the evil one but Jesus was having a private conversation Jesus was opening the word to them in this private conversation we found Jesus prophesying about his death is burial and his resurrection we found him prophesying about the future he talked about the destruction of Jerusalem he talked about the end of the world he talked about the sign of his coming the disciples had questions it was patient enough to answer them in the account of John We Found Jesus talking about the church he was talking about the fact that there was going to be a church and right there was letting the disciples know that there was an advancement in the relationship there was an advancement in the intimacy and we've heard that you know for many services he said henceforth I call you no more servants I call you friends it was at that time he was telling them what they were to look forward to he said the comforter was going to come when he the spirit of truth comes it will guide you into all truth and I often wondered how the disciples felt when Jesus told them that it was going to leave because it was their comforter anything they needed they went to him but he got to a point where he started to tell them I am going to take my leave and he said but don't worry I'm going to say unto you another comforter and that's why I said Jesus was their comforter because he was going to send another comforter but he explained to them you don't have to worry this comforter is just exactly as me because it's me coming in spirit form it was at this time he was telling them about the love that she bind them he prayed and told the father let it be that same love that I and my father are warned that they also can be one with us we had that yesterday how that would happen it was about this time that he also was anointed by Mary of Bethany for his burial and what we will call Wednesday nights which was yesterday was the Passover Gilbert actually turned on it yesterday I was just so excited the Passover happens and then the next day is the start of the Feast of unleavened bread and that should be for seven days I believe and we found that the disciples came to Jesus and said where would you like to eat the Passover and that's when he told them you know go to this person you'll find go to the spiritual place you find this person tell the person that the master needs a room and then you can make ready for the last for the supper which we now know as the Last Supper but as Jesus was going through all of this and if you think about my title I know a lot of people might wonder I know about getting money I've learned about read about getsy money in the Bible but I don't know about any battle that happened in Gethsemane and I'm not talking about Peter drawing out his sword to cut off the hair of of the servant of of one of uh the the the side the priests or the Pharisees but we're going to get there I want us to notice that Jesus at this point was 100 a man now this was a man that knew the future now as humans we are designed in a way that when we see something that will hurt us we either fight or we take a flight so Jesus was very conscious of what was coming right before him it was very conscious of what was going to happen and he was expressing that to his disciples he was conscious of the fact that one of the persons that have lived so close to him for the last three and a half years in fact the one that had the purse was going to betray him he knew that the one that was his right hand man was going to deny him and even curse because he was telling them this he told Peter you're going to deny me three times two times before the the Coco three times and he was also saying to them as they were having the Last Supper that one of you will betray me and Jesus had needed that he was in distress he said my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death and after he had had this last supper with them he called the three of his disciples who would probably would call the greatest of the twelve and they went into the garden with him the brand said in the message desperations so that dear Lord Jesus himself in the world's greatest Battleground gets the money he cried out in the spirit should he take the Seas of the world or should he just remain on Earth with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do but watch his humility as he humbled himself not my will but thine be done humbled himself to the wall to the word the promised word of God Of Heaven he said in adoption but the brand said in the guardian of Gethsemane the anointing left him brother brother Barry just said that he was not the god part of him left him brother Brown said he had to die as a man so whenever I'm thinking about what Jesus went through and I'm thinking about what happened in the Garden of Gethsemane I need to realize that Jesus was just exactly like me other than the fact that he knew the future In The Garden of Gethsemane the anointing left him you know he had to die as a sinner brotherbraham wasn't saying that Jesus was a sinner but Jesus had to take the place of The Sinner the punishment of The Sinner he had to take that upon himself he died a sinner you know that not his sins but mine and yours that's where that love come in how he took mine oh hallelujah how it took mine now I'm talking about a battle that was happening and you might want to ask me where was the location of that battle well the brand has an answer for us sorry um I'll just read it here and then we'll go to see what what I had uh what I was trying to show and you know let me just let me just start with this first we we know this we've all seen it we've all heard about it we as human are Triune being we have the body on the outside we know the senses of the body we have the spirit next to it we know the senses of the spirits do we know it's okay let's I'll show you over there so we have memory we have affection we have imagination we have reasoning and we have conscience but the brand told us that and if you read some earlier parts of the Brahms Ministry I know I've said this before I know you know it but the brand did call what I'm showing as the spirit but the brand did called it the soul but later on it kind of you know corrected that and told us the soul is the innermost part and one thing he said about the soul is is either of two senses you can't have the two at the same time it's either Faith or doubt and there are times you might live in the realm of faith and the next day you might live in the realm of doubts that still has nothing to do with the sweet germ that is inside you right I know I've said this and we'll talk about the sea gerb what we are talking about who is the master of that home at that point in time now we're going to concentrate more on the spirit and for just a title tonight I would rather you know want to refer to that as a human mind but Ram told us so when this great battle started on Earth it was saying this in the greatest battle ever for there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to reach and that Battlegrounds begin in the human mind why am I bringing this Jesus was going through a mind battle in Gethsemane so Jesus was going through a mind battle it was in a place where he needed to make a decision why that decision was harder for Jesus to make was because Jesus knew the future there are times that will take a flight or there are times of fights because we know a part of the future we know what it might look like so if you know that there's something that's going to hurt you you're going to avoid it or you're going to totally run away from it but you don't know the details but Jesus knew the details and just to go a little bit ahead of myself the reason I read Hebrews is that we were told that in that he himself has suffered is able to take that suffering that you're going through and go through it with you with a full realization of what it feels like the full realization of what it feels like are we insured tonight so talking about this but let me just finish reading this is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin and that is because the decisions decisions are made from the mind he called it the head we're going to get a little bit into that the brain that's where decisions are made and Jesus had to make a decision In The Garden of Gethsemane so we know that this mind the human mind that is where every sadness every anger every depression every despair every failure every fear every fight all of the arrogance you've ever seen start in the human mind that's also the place where every joy every peace every Comfort every victory all the happiness you've ever had all the victory you've ever had of the humility of the success you've ever had started from the human mind so how powerful is our human mind let me just read a few things that I kind of found from the research that's been done and when I'm talking about the mind just a lot of people will kind of researchers will kind of use mind or brain and the way I understand it is the brain is our anatomical mind it is it is the it is the visible part of our mind well there is a huge part of our mind that is not visible you can't see it you know that's why sometimes you see people going to Coma but their mind is still active right their brain might be non-functional but their mind is active so how how powerful is the human mind they said more recently a research study found that the human brain can hold 10 times as much information as previously thoughts all told scientists now believe that the capacity of the human brain is about a petabyte so I probably will find you here gigabyte you hear all of that so the first question is how powerful is the person's mind so the mind is the most powerful computer in the world at the moment that energy moving across the synapses of your neutrons sorry no your re neurons has potent potential to revolutionize revolutionize your life a single thoughts can spark a flurry of activity now the next question how are human brains so powerful since the human brain is complex in in humans it consists of about 100 billion neurons making on the order of 100 trillion connections it is often compared with another complex system that has enormous problem-solving power the digital computer is the human brain most powerful that's the next question the most powerful computer known is the brain the human brain processes about 100 billion neurons with roughly one quadrillion that is one on one million billion connections known as synapses wiring these cells together so when you are wowed by chats GPT artificial intelligence and what it can do if you've ever heard about that and those things are very impressive but your brain is stronger than it the human intelligence is stronger the artificial intelligence only makes human intelligence it has the power to bring several human intelligence together I don't want to get into all of that because I'm not at work I'm in church but just to give you an idea one of the things that people worry the most about is with all the artificial intelligence that's coming are we going to still have jobs in the future and the SR has always been that humans will still have jobs because even if you have you know artificial intelligence Robert's doing all of the things that you need them to do someone still needs to tell them what to do so God will always outsmart Satan we know that the knowledge of this world is not from God we know that scientists are watching God and trying to copy brother Brown said God gave them a sneak peek into his laboratory and then they could see some of the things that God has done so the computer is designed after the human brain is what I'm trying to tell you now it says does the human mind have a limit so the dead pen and said to this question will be no your brain is almost certainly not full sometimes I think my brain is full but we have not just used up all the potential that our brain has although there must be a physical limit to how many memories we can store it is extremely large we don't have to worry about running out of space in our lifetime sometimes I think the things are forgotten but you know I was thinking about that and when brother Brahm said you see people on their death bed and things that they have forgotten all their lives come flashing right in their face because it's been stored somewhere that's how powerful it is remember the reason we're bringing this is to point us to the fact that Jesus Christ had a battle going on is his human mind in Gethsemane now Romans chapter 12 verse 1 to 2 says this I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind proved what is that good the proof of his resurrection there has to be a renewing of your mind an acceptable and perfect will of God so God hasn't given us our human mind and intending for that human mind to rule Our Lives do you understand has anyone ever gone through a mind battle here okay just to let you know Jesus went through that as well but we are going to see how Jesus addressed the Mind battle I think that's a big lesson for us tonight but the brand told us in the greatest battle level 4. he said if you got your senses see taste feel smell and hear they're all rights but don't trust them unless they agree with the word they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them the Bible said now imaginations conscience memories reasons and affections they are all right if they agree with the word those are the senses of your spirits what we are calling the human mind but if you have faction doesn't agree with the word gets rid of it the rap said you will blow a flu right quick if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it that's right if your memory if your imaginations if your conscience anything disagrees with that what's on the inside if it's straight that's on the inside of your soul whatever signals that faith is sending remember that doubt is also doing that at the same time you don't listen to what Satan says you listen to What God Says now brother Brian made us to know that Satan takes advantage of our minds this powerful tool that God has given to us Satan tries to take advantage of it and like I said before every fight starts in the mind every hatred starts in the mind you know the the thing about this many times I will get to it we think about the thoughts that come into our minds and we'll get to the way brother the brand was asked that question where are those thoughts coming from so I'm not going ahead of myself but I just want to kind of maybe quickly say this the Bible told us that as a man thinketh in his heart so easy right as a man thinking we've read about the brain we've been told how powerful it is and he's telling us here that as a man thinketh in his heart so is he that's that's who he becomes right now there's a difference just for the for the purpose of this conversation there's a difference between your thoughts and your thinking what comes in is the thoughts it becomes your thinking when you accept it when you start to ponder over it God has such made that human mind that it is creative all the things that we see this was somebody's imagination this Pulpit the piano was somebody's imagination the organ was somebody's imagination all the things that have been created by men were someone's imagination where did he start from the human mind so what comes in they take it and they think about it now if it's a right thought that comes into your mind and you think about it that is who you become if it's the wrong thought that comes into your mind and you think about it that's who you become and this applies to all aspects of Our Lives that's why some of the things they say you know they say that's fake it till you make it and it works for people because that faking is happening in their mind they believe it so much that they become it that is how powerful that element of our life that God has given to us but Satan takes advantage of it but if I give an example many times we don't think that this happened in brother Brown's life he said I get spells too it gets Moody I get to a spot where what gets me is where I get to those spells where I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you anyone ever felt like that before Satan can take time to build something that never exists in your mind about a brother or a sister I don't know if I've said this here before but I went somewhere many years ago to prejections my father-in-law's Church the first time I was going to preach there I was waiting in the office and a brother comes and meets with me um asked if he could see me and I said sure and he said brother I have something to tell you he said a while back when you guys visited we were in church I greeted you but you did not respond to me and something told me that you don't like me you know about me you know about my family and you don't like me and that's why you did not respond I looked at him like brother I only know your first name know nothing about your family and he said when that thing came into his mind something told me because at that time I wasn't they didn't know me as a minister but something came to his mind and said what if this brother becomes a minister tomorrow so fast forward to a year or so after was when I went to take a service in the church and the brother was like wow but that's how Satan comes to take advantage of our human mind and brother Brian is telling us here I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world see remember I'm not immune to the temptation if Jesus was not immune to it then brother Brahm was not remember Jesus when he was even telling his disciples that this is what I'm going to do I almost want to think about it he was prepping himself up for something that was too great for him to even surrender himself to you was prepping himself up to to to that Journey To The Cross and all that he will have to go through and what did Satan do Satan anointed Peter and said no Lord no you cannot go and he started rebuking probably getting into some very you know old-time prayer meeting that Jesus should not go to the cross and Jesus said Satan get the behind me because if you and I were to put ourselves in in the shoes of Jesus if I don't know what what example to use but let's say we're going to do something we've never done before go on a roller coaster the fastest ever and somebody comes and starts to remind you about you know two years ago when they had an accident and someone died will that encourage you to go absolutely not so Jesus also had those mind battles the ram said I'm not immune to temptation he said like a certain friend of mine oh sorry I'll just go back to the annoying me to the Temptation see I got to overcome that then when I look back and see something like this I pull it right back in the face and say what about that what about the word of God what about this positive thing about what Satan is trying to say the negative what about that like a certain friend of mine setting and the meaning here was a clan kind of a clan that doesn't believe in Divine Healing come to this young fellow recently and said to him that stuff that they're preaching they're about Divine Healing there's nothing to it let me just say here Never Surrender yourself to Satan to be a vessel to be used to discourage someone now brother Brown was asked the question and I think that might this might help someone brother Brian please explain how a person knows if he's thinking his own thoughts or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make him think wrong especially if you know you don't want to think then anyone has been in those situations where you don't want to think I mean I I some thoughts that come to my mind I'm not even proud enough to to say well this thought ever came into my mind but that was a question that somebody asked for LeBron he wants to know are those your thoughts or not now let's listen to the answer then if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking he just told us that he himself is not immune to it he gave us an example of Sarah coming to tell him that nobody loves you and Satan knows how to come and even tell you something that there is enough evidence to disprove it I gave you know the the example of when I was giving my testimony of my new job how I needed to do criminal record check in Nigeria and there was some delay to it and I know I've never been a criminal but Satan told me that it was going to come out and it was going to be negative results since I've never been a criminal I said well you know Nigerian police they are never they're never trustworthy somebody will make a mistake somewhere and they will come back and of course you've resigned this job and you'll never get this one where is that all happening the human mind in the human mind the brand said if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking if it's with the word it's God's thinking what does this tell me it tells me that my mind is a virgin ground in its original state it's a virgin ground now depending on which of the thoughts I accept that will tell me the atmosphere I'm going to create in my human mind and invariably the atmosphere that I'm going to create around myself so if anything that is wrong is coming into your mind it is not your thoughts it is the devil's thoughts if it's good thoughts of the word and of God it's God's thinking now the question the person to ask the question goes on to save the case may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may it be overcome or got rid of so now the thoughts has come you've identified that this is Satan bringing this thought into my mind how can you get rid of it the brand said take the very vice versa from it if the devil makes you think that's if you know you are a Christian and it tries to make you think you're not a Christian just take the verse and say I am a Christian it is that simple Satan is just a bully that's just a difference sometimes we'll keep pounding it in your mind and what you've got to do is also keep pounding it in Satan's years well the ram talked about a brother who had a dream the devil came to him and said and he jumped back and he came and said boo again and he jumped back and at some point he realized Nigerians will say that you can't be chancing me or like you can't override me right I also I also have to fight back and he said boo to this to the devil now what we think happens is when we say boo to the devil we think nothing happens but actually something happens when you say bull to the how do you say bull to the devil you speak the word of God when you speak the word of God when you continue to speak the word of God it will get to a Time Satan will leave you but LeBron says if he says you another Christian just say the verse and say I'm a Christian as long as you experience matches in God's word say I'm a Christian anything else the same way now the question goes on to say when you answer this please pray for me to overcome this as I'm not by myself and brother Brian prayed and said God grant you your overcoming ever who you are may your thoughts just go right back the other side and say I am a Christian I am a believer Satan you have no hold on me and I know that all of us or some of us are in these situations we face it I face it every day but the brand this is some of those things are very amazing under the anointing the brand said frankly I'm standing right here now saying the same thing but the brand is on the pulpits Satan is not saying you know what there's so much anointing there I'm never going to go in there right on the platform Satan was still fighting him with thoughts negative thoughts say now I'm saying the same thing keep from fainting right here at the pulpit that's right four or five times I've almost speeched over on the pulpit that's the truth God knows that's right now the question goes on to say when a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex how may he overcome this so should it be if he was the only child caused this in his early use LeBron says again take exactly the opposites if you're always wanting your way and that little one little breath that wants to always have everything your way turn right back around and give everything you've got the other way if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got see do whatever just go the vice versa and that's the way to overcome anything it's an antidote so we see Jesus that night come wrapping up very soon yes Hallelujah what Iran says after the supper that night the crossover Little Brook seadrum and somewhere I went across the brook and went into a garden called Gethsemane they had to have a conference God and Christ had to talk he had to talk it over the Lamb on the Dover to sit together was the door that had to talk to the lamb it was the Lamb's death now when they sit back when they sit by that rock and all the Angels come down from Heaven to listen into this conference Ram said oh there was Gabriel Michael one wood all the thousands of them sitting around the Rock said to his disciples we read they had add lots of big meanings was tired perhaps like you are this evening but they said will you just watch with me an hour for I've got to go Yonder and have a conference I have to go alone the brand said the conf friends was set and the lamb young a beautiful life never a life like that never was never will be a life like that lamb ad but now the father said are you willing it's your love for your brethren great enough it's your love for that sinful stinking world that you were born in do you love them enough to forfeit your life do you love them enough to take their place to Bear their sins to the hardest crucial death there could be nothing die like that kind of death but him LeBron said and in that conference such a decision was made until blood dropped from his brow it was under a strain the scenes of the world was upon him and then he looked into the face of the dove and said not my will for thy will be done that was where he won the victory so the berry said it before the service brother Brian said Jesus did not die on Calvary Jesus died in Gethsemane and if there is no death there can be no Resurrection so before you totally answer that question what does resurrection mean to me you've got to ask yourself have I died already because he said if we die with him then we will be raised with him but we have to come to that point where we ask ourselves have I died to my own self have I died to my own ideas have I died to my thoughts have I die to my desires have I got to a stage where I can say not my will but thine be done the brown said oh can we have that decision in our hearts this evening can you forfeit that little filthy life of yours are you willing to look into his face and say not my will I am a drunk at but I'll drink no more I am a gambler I'll drink no more I'm immoral I'll be that way no more I am a liar but I'll stop it today I'm a foul person but in this conference this evening I'll look into your face and take like my master who died for me to May my to make my way clear not my will your will if it cost me my home if it cost me my husband my wife my father my mother my fellowship my church membership whatever it costs me in this conference this morning this evening I say I want your Holy Spirit to live in me I've heard about it I want you in me not mine but yours will that be a decision tonight the Battle of Gethsemane Jesus went there for you and for me it was tough for him but he had to let go of all his will you have to let go of all his pride he has to let go of all the benefits that he had being a master of people here always been called master it was God he knew everything the comfort that he had here we know he wasn't rich but we know he loved his disciples we know he loved the people but he got to a point he said not my will be done I'll call the musicians let's be on our feet tonight we know it was a Night Like This that happened said he prayed for us it didn't just make that decision he didn't just go to the cross he knew why he was paying the price and he he prayed for the beneficiaries of that prize it was paid and that's who we are so if he was tempted in that way to go through a mind battle if he was tempted in that way for Satan to come into his mind and try to convince him otherwise he said he was in despair even unto death the point of death and the people he trusted the most I was thinking about it what prayer requested Jesus have for Peter for John and for James when he said watch with me an hour was he asking them just join me to pray that this cup may pass over me trusted them he needed them at that point but they were too tired but because he thought about you thought about me he made the decision but Graham said at that point the anointing left him he didn't go there as God he get he went to Gethsemane as just like you and I and if he faced that situation regardless of any situation you find yourself in remember in that he himself was tempted he's able to secure those that attempted that's about right to pray tonight dear Lord Jesus as we continue to remember the price you paid for us now that you knew the future and you knew Lord Jesus Every Beat Of Our Lives even 2 000 years after you were here in flesh you made a provision Lord you ensured their father that you tasted every hardship that will ever go through so that you know how it feels and their father we have brought many requests before you Lord sometimes it's things that we are going through in our lives we know Lord Jesus Christ at every situation in our lives starting the human mind your servant said that's the Battleground every time we reject the word of God that happened in the mind first every time we accept your word that happens in the mind your Prophet said intellectually we are hearing the word before he becomes a revelation we have to hear it like Paul said Faith cometh I hear it we know Lord Jesus that's not just the hearing of how I hear Lord Jesus we know this is the hearing that happens in the hearts where where it starts to translate Lord Jesus into into into imagination not where we start to to kind of have some feeling to it there Lord Jesus where where where we start to have some understanding of it intellectually but we know you want to take it beyond that the Lord Jesus you want to make your word a revelation in our heart you want to make every promise in the book a revelation to us not that we might start to think Lord Jesus the way you think like the Bible said let the mind that is in Christ be in you that when we get to situations in our lives Lord Jesus we take the Outlook of Christ to look at that situation when someone Acts in a mean way to us we have temperance to know how to react back in kindness in love just the way Lord Jesus you used to Lord Jesus Christ father on the way to the Cross their father the the way heating you so hard they were beating you so hard yet Lord Jesus you have nothing but love for them and your servant said nothing comes there with perfect love father if there's anyone that's going through mind battles if there's anyone going through depression Satan Lord Jesus Christ father has built a house in any heart here Lord and continuously is bringing discouragement to them May tonight be Lord Jesus the night of their Deliverance their lord Jesus may we start to see things the way you see them Lord when we start to follow your word your promises Lord Jesus Christ father Lord may we start to think about it it was said Lord Jesus to Joshua this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth you must meditate upon it day and night dear Lord Jesus may we continue to meditate upon your word thank you Father for going to Calvary but much more thank you for the decision you made against me because we knew you we know that that was where it happened where you gave up your will your human will there father and you took on the will of the father we are grateful that you did it just for us Blessed Be Your holy name bless us Lord Jesus tonight and Lord Jesus continues to bless us in the meetings dear father Lord your servants that you're going to use father for the rest of the meanings just Lord Jesus take them Lord Jesus Christ and and use them to take us to higher Heights their father more glorious times Lord Jesus in your presence thank you Father Francis in our prayers in Jesus Christ's name we pray

it has to be personal it has to be something that if no one else agrees with you you stay with it because it's a personal revelation that's what the dead of Jesus means a personal if he was just you that was The Sinner on Earth today he still will admit that decision [Music] well the cross belongs face referees [Music] thank you foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah tremendous message tonight once again from the Lord to recognize when we feel isolated and alone and we think that we're not we're not connecting with the Lord and that he's not connecting with us you live 2 000 years ago here on Earth and he has no idea what kind of pressure we're under what kind of situations we're contending with he was fighting the same enemy the exact same way the battleground of the Mind tremendous and you know the only thing that Christ asked for when he did pray whether Branham says it very clearly is that he asks for our fellowship he could have asked for anything else and I just I thought brother Toby was going to get into it when this Angels met him at that rock [Music] could just imagine the conversation the conference they had with him Master are you sure we could
