before the foundation of the world he first loved us are you happy tonight we just have a couple of requests unspoken that we'd like to bring Before the Throne tonight if you have a need maybe just make it known as we go unto him amen gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're so thankful that we can come unto you Lord according to the Revelation that you have given us in the age in which we live and Lord to know that it's not just an accident we didn't just stumble into it somewhere somehow sometime along the way but you for ordained us Lord Jesus to be exactly who we are exactly where we're at to be going through exactly what we're going through father to manifest that life that you have placed within us and tonight Lord Jesus it truly is an honor and a privilege to give you praise Lord Jesus to know what it means to worship you in spirit and in truth father there's so many people in this world that are worshiping Lord Jesus but father we know that maybe they have Spirit but they don't have truth and some have truth but they don't have Spirit Lord oh Father tonight to think that we've been given spirit and Truth truth father how we can worship you how wonderful it is Lord to recognize the privilege that you have given us father tonight we just want to thank you for coming to visit with us one more time lord Jesus maybe we don't feel it Lord and maybe we don't see it maybe we can't sense it with our human senses but we're not supposed to that's not what your word says father you said that where two or three are gathered in your name that you're already there and we thank you for that Lord we take you at your word tonight father Lord Jesus we just want to give you all the praise and all the glory that you desire Lord we just want to ask that you would father meet every need that was made known unto you tonight by way of an uplift hand or maybe an uplift heart unto you father just the thought the desire Lord Jesus we know that you're not bound by time or space and father we just pray that you would sovereignly meet the need in the heart of your children father wherever they are tonight father whether they're present here or whether they're virtual somewhere else father maybe watching this later on Father we pray that you would just be with them just the same Lord and father tonight as a as an assembly here we just want to stand together United around these two unspoken requests father Lord knowing that you are more than able sometimes things can look impossible but father we know that that's what you specialize in Lord Jesus and we just commit the needs into your hands father For Your Glory tonight we just want to ask Lord that one more time you would let us walk with you father not that you would just walk with us but father that we could walk with you Lord Jesus that you would lead us tonight oh Father in the cool of the evening in this building here that you've given us Lord Jesus one more time father according to your will we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you very much musicians if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to carry on with the study and the exposition of the seven Church ages amen Revelations chapter 2 unto the angel of the church in pergamus it's Revelations chap 2:12 Revelations 2:12 it says unto the angel of the church in pergamus write these things say sayith he which hath a sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where in Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches am to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we just thank you for this word we know that Lord you said to this age that each and every Church age applies father and there's not one Church Church age that doesn't apply they all culminate in the seventh Church age and Lord we know that father we're coming out of the seventh Church age and Lord some people are even all the way out of it even now tonight Lord and father we just thank you for this and we pray that Lord Jesus these would not be words that are vainly spoken that these would not be words that are vainly heard but father each one of us would take these words and consider them Father because we know that the time is short we just invite you now father to have the preeminence in every aspect of our service tonight for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly thankful to be back it's uh certainly wonderful for the Lord's traveling mercies last week at this time we were anticipating flying to Ohio and we did that and the lord gave us a wonderful time and brought us back and we're just certainly thankful for the opportunity to be here again just a few announcements before we get going tonight we just have the potluck this Sunday we know uh my wife sent out the text this afternoon just reminding everyone uh so we can make arrangements for who's going to be there and how much food to have um so that'll be a wonderful time of Fellowship hopefully it won't be too hot for us pray for a little bit of rain maybe Saturday night and even Sunday morning it would sure be nice but we'll just trust the Lord for it um we have a brother coming here on July 31st I had the the opportunity to meet him a year and a half ago and uh he's just a wonderful brother who lives in Quebec and uh he's a minister and he was very well affiliated with the voice of God Recordings and uh I don't know if he's as Affiliated now but I think that's irrelevant because that doesn't make someone a Christian or not what that does is shows that they have a very good understanding of the message of the hour and uh his name is brother Joel Gant and uh he's just a wonderful brother I uh I got to take him up to Edmonton from Calgary here and so we had lots of time to fellowship and anyways he's going to come here he's going to take the service for us on the 31st of July and uh on August the 4th we're going to be away I was going to be away two weekends in a row there but I just don't think that's going to work um so I'm going to forego the special services in Edmonton which is kind of sad but it's the way it works I need to be at my post of Duty um we have a family event that uh we're going to attend in Saskatchewan on August the 4th so brother Jos is agreed to take the service for us on August the 4th in our stead and then uh you know it was uh kind of surprising tonight I was just considering this we're just about exactly one month away from uh brother Andrew Glover being here towards the end of August which means uh summer is I don't know half over just about it's pretty amazing in our time how quickly time goes by but we have brother Andrew Glover here for uh August 16th 17th and 18th we're going to have three services we did two last time and it was just too good to not have three this time so we're going to do that and uh see what happens and I as I understand uh we we we picked this at probably a difficult time I'm going to try and adjust that for next year so that we can have brother Paul and sister Elaine here year they go away for their anniversary and um I just didn't really think about that when we booked brother Andrew last year but we'll try and try and maybe bump it ahead or bring it back a little bit we'll see what brother Andrew's schedule has to say and uh we'll go from there so uh God bless you tonight I just wanted to say a thank you to everyone for all of your prayers for traveling mercies to and from Ohio uh we had no hiccups in terms of flights um the only thing that was a little bit frustrating was we brought carryon luggage we did not want to check our bags because we potentially could lose the bags I've had some not good experiences with that so we did that and when we got to the gate on the second flight they said everyone from this point Beyond in the lineup has to now check their bag at the gate so we were like wow guess it's the Lord's will but you know it's the way it works if that's as bad as it gets it's pretty good we didn't have any issues and uh you know the the prayers for traveling mercies were certainly answered and uh the prayers specifically for the blessings in the service there it was incredible to hear some of the testimonies and uh you know I I I can tell you that I was a bit nervous going to preach for uh I would say a general like Brother Ray um sitting in the front row and brother Wayne Lawson sitting right beside him and his grandson brother Nathan Ericson sitting right beside him and you know I I would say these are all probably real preachers and I I hardly feel like that but you know the Lord was gracious there was one sister that said in the first five words that that brother Barry spoke God answered her need and I don't know what the need was I don't really even know what I said but it was the Lord speaking clearly because uh it just you know there was just testimony after testimony the Lord was really good to us and the fellowship that we had was just tremendous and to top it all off I got to go fishing so that was incredible it was just a wonderful time and well overdue so I I really want to thank everyone for your prayers and your support the brothers that took the services brother Emanuel brother Toby just tremendous Services thank you Brothers isn't it wonderful to have brothers that just love the Lord absolutely to know that we're we're we're pulling for the same goal there's not a a jostling for some other direction and some other thing it we're fighting the same enemy it's just a tremendous thing and you know uh brother Toby he he he mentioned that uh maybe the pastor could get inspired by something that was said and I'll tell you what I'm inspired by what was said and uh you know many people will think that brother what brother Toby talked about was a Sunday school lesson for the children and and when they start getting married and start thinking about marriage and stuff I want to say hey you know what he was talking about was marriage for adults that was Sunday school for the married people that wasn't just for children if it was just for children when you listen to it I recommend you go back and relisten to it and as a married adult and say how does that apply to my life and see if it doesn't because that was from God that was a tremendous service amen sure enjoyed brother emanuel's service too but brother Toby you got me fired up you know absence really makes the heart grow fonder and just in case anybody wonders my heart is not to travel I don't have a heart to travel I get invitations to travel and and and I'll tell you over the last couple years my heart has really become grounded here and every time I'm away I just I just long to be home I don't desire to go on the road and to go and minister in other churches there was a time where that was the case but that time is not now my heart is right here in Calgary and I just consider you to be my family and so uh I don't plan to travel in the future if you're wondering so my goal is to be here with y'all certainly would like to to welcome sister Charlotte here tonight sitting at the back here behind Sister Mary I guess sister Mary's invited her God bless you Sister welcome I trust you feel right at home uh tonight we just want to carry on with our study and the exposition of the seven Church ages and like I told you in uh the last service it just does something to me I consider this to be probably one of the uh I I don't even know what you call it maybe the keystones to the message of of the hour um some people might disagree but I I just think that you know we need to make sure that when we are preaching when we're listening when we're singing all of the life that we live it needs to be according to the word for our day amen we can look forwards and put it out there to some other day we know brother Bram said that very clearly what what man is is is is famous at doing is looking forward to what's God's going to do and and looking back to what God has already done but ignoring what God is doing right now and in other places he says missing what God is doing right now and you know brother Bram he was able to discern things and and he was able to call out people in the audience way back there and say Hey you know brother sitting there with the the blue shirt with short sleeves right at the very back in front of the sound booth I see that Pillar of Fire hanging right over you and and that thing that you're here for isn't for you it's for your wife and your wife has this issue and she's talked to every doctor in the in the country and nobody has been able to help I'm here to tell you tonight in the name of Jesus thus sayith the Lord she's healed how does that work how how how can that be what a tremendous blessing that is but sometimes even though that graphic of a description is given right right it goes right over someone's head true they don't have the ability to see it they can't receive it right how much more of a blessing is it when we can take this word word into our heart and say be it unto me according to Thy word oh my oh my you know I just was reminiscing a little bit going back a little ways and I don't really want to go too far back but I just think it's so beautiful you know brothers and sisters we can get caught up in in I'll say it this way we can get caught up in in the tradition of the message of the hour and think that there's something that we've got to be able to do to produce Christ we know the prophet said that you're all the Christ that the world's ever going to see but what are we doing are we trying to make something up are we trying to polish things up are we going to polish the hubs and and and put the the the do skin conditioner on all the seats and put the best synthetic oil in the engine and the best rubber on the wheels and everything is going to be tuned perfectly blueprinted and balanced to the to the maximum potential that we could ever have but not have a dynamic spark in that engine in that car it's all good for nothing brothers and sisters It all becomes a bunch of works and really you can have a whole bunch of pushing to make that car do something but you know what brother bradam he said the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth word it's not to produce the word but to receive the truth the word to believe and Obey it and I think that's just so amazing because if we could actually totally do that in our lives then what happens is this word to the church pick up your pen and write sorry not the word to the church pick up your pen and write the the message that brother bradam was given for the church it just becomes I believe so much more real to us it's not something that we try and do we don't we don't put this on brother bradam he talks about the uh in pick up your pen and write he talks about how it is the holy spirit that gave him a message it has to do with the word and the bride and he says here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction this is paragraph 60 here the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and Herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so brother Bram he goes on to say here the very same law applies to the church today they in the bride will be so I'm just skimming over here to catch up to where we left off they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image and now some people think that means to maybe have shoulder length hair and to have a beard and to maybe try and walk a certain way and talk a certain way some people think that maybe what they need to do is actually dress like brother brandom maybe they need to speak like brother Bram maybe they need to do things in certain ways like certain people to try and actually fulfill this that's not the way it is at all the only evidence is the ability to live this word yes to believe the word is one thing right that's the first stage but this word to believe this word brothers and sisters what it does is it gets us somewhere it gets us to the light of Jesus Christ because this word that we're talking about believing the message and the word are one yes that's right and what's the word the word is Jesus Christ the message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the person of Jesus Christ so when we can say Amen to this word truly right genuinely say Amen to this word take it into our heart what happens is that Z Gene of God we talked about it comes to life and when it comes to life it's no longer I life living out what it is is the fruit of the spirit living out but many times what we do is we go that far to say Amen to the word but we don't give it long enough to let that life actually begin living out through us and so when we still start to see different fruits hanging on the tree malice hatred variance we start to see all these different things that are listed in the Bible before the list of the fruit of the spirit which is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness forgiveness all of the fruit of the spirit what happens is we still see some bitter fruit hanging on the tree and you know what we need to do we need to make sure that the life is actually coming in from the bottom and flowing up through the vine into the branches because he said it I am the vine and you are the branches and how will will will will we be able to tell how will you know that people love him he said it you you'll you'll be B to love one another but you'll know them by their fruit amen what fruit is hanging on their tree they got a temper like a bua I I'm getting totally off track here I'm going to get into that potentially on Sunday but when this word comes into the heart of a Believer it changes the believer we don't have our life our personality our genetics our problems continually dragging behind us what we get dragging behind us is signs and wonders of the Holy Spirit living out through us that's right amen paragraph 55 in the paman church age brother bam says now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God he said there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word will you can't separate God and the word they are one amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in print form but when you take this book and you eat this book then you become the literal manifestation of the word of God for your day amen that's why it's important to make sure that you eat the right book right when you eat the book that's not actually according to what Malachi 4 brought Revelations 10:7 brought the the full restoration of the word brought if if we eat another book we're going to have another word in US it'll be another spirit in us and to take one word out or to add one word to it we know that that's death right that's not going to get us where we want to go so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word in his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan can't stand before for that man I I this is just for me it's just beautiful because who wants Satan to stand before you who wants to have Satan as a stumbling block in front of you we've got enough stumbling blocks we don't need the devil coming around and trying to trip us up and giving us problems we want to know exactly where we stand so that when we speak the word of God it's deity speaking and that's why brothers and sisters I keep saying that you got to get the Holy Ghost we have to get the baptism of the the Holy Ghost there's no question there's no option to it it has to be all the way that's the only way is the full baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know what if we haven't got it if we don't know for sure whether we've got it the only thing we got to do is say Lord please according to your word daddy that's your word you said that if we repent and that if we get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins then we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so when we can actually say that I've met the requirements Daddy it's up to you I can't do anymore and I'm just going to say be it unto me according to Thy word and I'm not going to move until you bring it to me I want that blessing I want that kind of blessing but you know when the devil gets a hold in our life we have a little bit of apprehension about that that's when it starts to get a little bit funny you know now you're going to maybe be turned into one of those Holy Rollers you're going to be a different person you are going to be a different person but I can tell you from experience brothers and sisters you will never be as fulfilled ever be as fulfilled as you can potentially be when you truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah everything in your life will begin to make sense there will be things that you'll think I don't understand that and I don't think I'll ever be able to understand that but you'll be able to say that's okay that's the way the Lord's ordained it but there's things in our lives that maybe we want to just completely have control over and and control and and drive and steer and you know what God wants to be the driver he doesn't want to be the co-pilot there's people that say God is my co-pilot I I don't know I would say nominal believer maybe unwise virgin because the wise virgin has oil and oil represents Jesus Christ the life of Jesus Christ Living out through that individual you know brother Brown he goes on to say that the spirit gave me a message for the church and it has to do with the word and the bride I'm just going to read read this quickly and then pick up kind of where we left off uh actually I'm just going to skim it because I want to continue on I I trust that some have read it I know some have I got some texts and I thought it was really good I'm going to get into it on Sunday I'll give you a little precursor to it uh what I preached in Ohio I have to bring here um I got into spoken word is the Original Seed is the other place in the message of the hour where brother bham talks about this pick up your pen and write and and he has a lot to talk about in that message it's not just a little bit where it's just a few paragraphs here maybe two or three pages worth it's uh it's hours worth of discussion and uh so we're going to get into that but you know brother BR he brings it in here I just love this part paragraph 64 he says from a little group of the true oh I'm sorry I got to back up paragraph 61 whatever life was in the sea came forth into a plant and then into Fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ's seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him amen and and this isn't a a a super person with a super home and a person with a super car and a person with a super bank account and a person with a super education this is a person with a supernatural ability to say Amen to the word but also live the word not just say I believe it they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him he's not going to unite with someone who just comes to church and says that I believe it but then I go home and do other stuff I go home and treat my family a different way it's not going to work he's not going to unite with that person this is in order to be United with him they will be one just like a husband is one with his wife that's what marriage is all about the marriage is actually a description of what being saved really saved actually is it was instituted in the Garden of Eden for a purpose to show the relationship between the bridegroom and the bride the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride amen I think it's so beautiful there is an invisible Union taking place right now but you know as far as as we go forwards brothers and sisters this invisible Union is becoming more and more visible because what's happening is this world has gone completely insane it truly has what was wrong before is now become right and what was right is now becoming wrong right so as we take a stand and say this is what we believe according to the word of God they've even got legislation in place in Canada to say that there is no longer going to be any religious exemption I might not have that worded correctly but if we ever have a problem and say hey you know what I said something towards the lgbtq community and somebody feels hurt their feelings are stepped on and I say hey it's what the word of God says that's what the Bible says there's no longer any Rel religious exemption if they pass that bill I I mean there's probably someone in here that knows more than I do about it but that's something that's tabled in in Ottawa right now so there's going to be no place to hide as a Believer we're going to stand out and be more and more visible amen but blessed be the name of the Lord what time is it it's much later than we think that's right one of these days they could come through the doors and arrest me for saying stuff about the lgbtq community and you know what that's a reality but so be it that's okay the apostles were thrown in prison for standing on the word of God if that's what we need to do then then that's what we need to do maybe there's someone in prison that needs to be witnessed to we know that there was a Jailer that got saved he and his whole house got saved because of it amen this is just such a beautiful word because it's in season for us they in the bride will be so much like him they will be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God yes and you know denominations cannot produce this wrong SE they will produce their Creeds their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrelization brings forth a hybrid product and you know this has been tried in the message where people will come to the church and and the deacons will shake you down at the door and say well your heels sister are just a little bit too high and you know what your skirt isn't quite long enough and brother you've done this maybe maybe maybe you actually wore shorts for a time so how could you possibly be who you say you are right it's been tried legalism takes you down legalism is good for a little while it feels good it's sweet as honey in your mouth when you can say look at me my suit's perfectly pressed everything that I do in my life it's exactly according to the message of the hour but you know what the message of the hour came for a purpose William Mary and Brandon was sent to Earth for a purpose and that was to take a bride of his own choosing he sent elaser to the Earth to go and call his Rebecca that's the reason for William Mary and Branham and unless we're willing to go and actually meet our Isaac it's for not polishing the hub caps on the car I keep referring to that for those people who don't know it it is the rising of the Sun that message brother bradam talks about the Dynamics meaning the mechanics many times we can have all the mechanics everything perfectly in order in our life according to the word of God according to the message of the hour but we're too afraid too rigid to let the Holy Spirit take control and you know what the mechanics is designed to take us to a certain place and then the Holy Ghost has got to take over it has to happen that way it's like the parents being the Holy Ghost for the children they have to be the Holy Ghost for their children because the children don't have accountability in their life but once they reach a certain age then the parents have to take their hands off and allow God to do the work that's why the word says to train them up in the way they should go and it won't depart from them brother banam here in this book he goes on quoting and I remember last time I I said there's a part in here where he says here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after his own kind it goes into italicized writing and and that's to emphasize something and what I said last week was the emphasis is this isn't brother Bram speaking this is the spirit of God speaking through William Mari and Bram pick up your pen and write I've got a message for the church she is going to be a super Church she is going to be a super race the law of reproduction states that every seed is going to bring forth after its own kind if you have a denominational seed and you plant that seed you're going to bring forth a denominational child but if you have a true seed of God what's going to happen is they're going to become the very image of God they will actually be one and this is in order to be United with him they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God brother Bram goes on to say the first son Adam was the spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God but she fell she listened to someone else she took some other reasoning she put one word in to the word of of God that's all and you know God never came and told her we've talked about this in the past he never came and told her he came and told the husband he told Adam Thou shalt not Adam took the message to her Adam is the one that actually explained it to her and she had the opportunity the occasion to listen to her husband or not listen to her husband and fall and when she fell she didn't drag the whole mankind down Eve didn't do that Eve just simply disobeyed her husband and her husband out of love for his wife stepped out from Grace her husband stepped out to actually take her by the hand and save her he knew that if he didn't do something to redeem her she would be lost but she was a part of him isn't it a beautiful thought to think that that's the same way with Jesus Christ if we are truly his bride we stepped out by not listening to him and what happened was he stepped out and actually redeemed us he paid it all he did it all for us what a beautiful thought brother bam says here but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to Die the second son Jesus also had a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like as was Adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like Adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live live or doubt the word and die she doubted she doubted and she left the word isn't that amazing she just left the word that's all if we leave the word today brothers and sisters it's the same thing for us same thing for us if we doubt the word if we leave the word we die she doubted she left the word she died but here's where I think it just is so good he brings it back to us he br brings it to today he brings it to where we live this is the word for us in our day brothers and sisters from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride God will do this we won't do it God will do it God will present Christ with a beloved bride amen she is a virgin of his word yes sir yes a virgin of his word I I just can't emphasize this enough it's not about our works she's not a virgin of her Works she's not perfect in her Works in her ways it's not that at all it's that he did it all and we're willing to say amen he did do it all and when we do that it causes us to live differently she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no manmade Creeds are dogmas no well that's how we used to do it and that's not how we used to do it and we should do it and we could do it and you know what brothers and sisters it's not about that it's not about that at all it's about what's inside our hearts When We Gather to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ what's inside of our hearts I'll tell you what if it is truly the spirit of God it's going to be exactly according to his word amen and it's just such a beautiful thing to know that we have an absolute I can tell you what brother Barry's opinion is on something and you can tell me what your opinion is on something and someone else cany in and say what their opinion is on something and and all of us will probably have slightly differing opinions except for when it comes to the word of God when we can say this is our absolute every one of us if we are true Sons and Daughters of God will line up exactly with the word of God we won't try and make excuses and say well this or the no we'll always say forgive me you know when I was preaching in Ohio it was one of the things that came out and I I just thank the Lord for his leaders ship I would never try and and and confront an issue or make an issue or do anything like that but one of the things that happened was we got talking like this and and a little bit about it was you know the evidence of of someone who actually hasn't gone all the way is is what's going to happen is when the correction comes by the word of God they're going to say well no I don't see it that way or there's going to be resistance they're going to stop they're going to hold fast they're going to say no I don't know I don't know and maybe even want to go like that right but a true son or daughter of God is going to say wow when somebody takes the time to come and talk to me and say brother you said this or brother you said that did you really mean it that way because you're influencing a lot of people and the word of God says this yes the brother or the sister is going to stop and they're going to say wow really right amen wow I I I can see the word of God and I can see that you're bringing it to me and and maybe I can't see it myself but I'm just going to consider the words and and maybe think about it for a little bit and what's going to happen is the spirit of God is going to move in that individual and they're going to say oh my I'm not right with the word of God forgive me brother forgive me for being wrong maybe I said something wrong maybe I did something wrong will you please forgive me we're not going to try and fight and and and have a battle over it we got into that a little bit I thought it was just amazing and uh kind of part of testimonies that that came out but you know all of us are subject to the word of God and every single one of God's children has to undergo chastening correcting it's not beating and it's not harming and it's not making big problems it's just correcting back to the word of God it's recalibrating getting back on track remember there's a highway with many many lanes and then there's a way and that way that's in the midst of that highway is a way of holiness and it's always going to be straight with the word it's not going to deviate to the right or the left but sometimes we just need to recalibrate from a little group of the true seed word of God God will present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no madade Creeds or dogmas she's not interested in saying my tradition my whatever my thoughts whatever she's going to say wow his word says that amen by and through the members of the rde will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin now I think that just Bears a lot if you go back and you look at what happened in the Christmas story what we would call the Christmas story when the angel Gabriel came to Mary and started to explain to her and talk to her and tell her I'm not going to say it tonight you've heard me say it many many times all all of what God promised is to be made manifest in the Virgin The Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was he himself to be made manifest it's no different for us tonight brothers and sisters God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin so I just want to go back a little bit remember he came and manifested he came and fulfilled the word that was prophesied in that virgin amen how many virgins were there that said oh my my works are perfect I know I got a feeling I got a feeling I'm that virgin that Isaiah prophesied about I'm that virgin how many of them were there brother bradam talks about in the message there is probably quite a few that thought all of their Works everything was in line maybe the number of years had gone by this is just lining up it's getting close a virgin's going to concede but then when it happened they couldn't receive it and that was because he fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin I just love it because they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image it's in order to be United with him they will be one brothers and sisters it ain't going to be us doing it my point is he is going to come and fulfill all of his word oh my as long as we're willing to line up with it that's the evidence for us to line up with his word it was an angel that had brought her to the message it an angel that brought her the message he said but the Angel's message was the word of God Isaiah 9 and6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her so brothers and sisters I just want to point to Malachi 45 and 6 behold I send you Elijah the prophet ET and he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers right not not saying we've got signs and wonders and speaking in tongues and all these different things going on in our lives no no no no no the Pentecostal experience the Born Again experience where you truly become a new creature in Christ Jesus the members of the Virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him amen they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads I'm just going to throw something out there that I know I'm going to bring on Sunday you know what brother brandham says is when the bride does something different from the groom she is not the bride the bride always lines up with the groom the bride does exactly what the groom wants it's not of the spoken word is the Original Seed I'll bring the quote on Sunday I'm not going to do it now but it just is so beautiful we can't live Our Lives different than the message of the hour and say I'm a message believer it doesn't work it's a false representation we've got to live our lives according to the message of the hour to prove that we actually truly are message Believers notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything unless it was first showed him by the Father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride amen Harmony Harmony between the groom and the bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death amen for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again this is where we left off last time I'm sorry this is I I said it last time so I guess I'm safe um I just needed to go back and get into this and we're probably going to dwell here for a little bit I hope it's okay there's so much in here this is really vital I think for us this is the word for us in our day brothers and sisters this is not looking at the past and it's not looking at the future it's for right now here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary how is the word in each one of us if we're the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't feel it do you feel it I don't see it do you see it we can't actually just say here's the word I've got the word we can hold our Bibles up and say there's the word but it's got to go more than this and I think we talked about it a little bit last time there has to be an intimate relationship because you know there's many people that will say oh Lord in that day haven't we cast out devils in thy name and done many many mighty Works had tremendous services oh my we were a powerful church we were a super Church a super race right and we know that he said I never even knew you I'm sorry I can't help you you were not willing to go all the way into the promised land you came right up to to Kadesh barnea right up to the place where you could actually taste the fruit you could feel the fruit you could smell the fruit you could see the evidence of the promised land but you just wouldn't go all the way we don't want to be those people brothers and sisters we need to get all the way into Christ Jesus he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death when when when the devil can see that you're not afraid of death he's not going to be able to stand before you he's not going to be worried one bit about you that's right for the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word how many people here tonight know what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord period ah such a little tiny thing but I think it's so important to recognize that period right there brothers and sisters amen she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord she's not looking for thus sayith the Lord she has it she's already got the endorsement she's not going to a convention to try and gather people together to to get a vote so that she can be that one she is that one and she needs to do is speak the word and go forwards but sometimes we get a corrupted word in our lives and when that happens we speak the word I got into this a little bit last time we we can speak the word and expect it to happen and all Heaven's there to back up the word once we speak it that way right as the bride we've got the checkbook and we've got the whole bank account in heaven to supply that need when we write that check but sometimes it doesn't get answered the way that we want it to yes sir does that change the way we feel about him no not for a Believer no the real believer knows that he's chosen this way for a purpose there's a reason why we're actually getting the answer we're getting we can't understand it but we just say Amen we believe that it's for the best because he chose it then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass amen she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will and no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still remember they have thus sayith the Lord but they don't clown for nobody right we're not looking to see a sign we're not looking to see a Wonder we don't need to do that we have thus sayith the Lord we know exactly who we are amen you look at people who are loaded they got lots of money they're not out there pulling out their pockets and thumbing through the stacks of cash that are in their pockets and showing the gold cards and the black cards and all the clear cards all the cards they're not showing their diamond rings and all the different things they've got the money they got nothing to prove to nobody they know exactly who they are they know where they stand the same thing with the bride of Jesus Christ she's got nothing to prove to nobody Satan's going to come around and say well can't can't you say that word you know what if you just put yourself up on the Pinnacle of the temple here you could fall down and if you do that then the angels are supposed to take you up why don't you just throw yourself down and and just see if God's God and I mean if you believe the message obviously he's going to do that right we know that brother Bram he had a wife and a baby now going down into the grave to be buried those seeds were being planted and Satan right at that lowest moment came around and said oh you could pray for other people and raise them up from the ground yes but he won't save you he he won't give you what you desire you've served him your whole life you made yourself a clown in front of your family in front of your friends everybody that's ever known you you've you've totally made a fool of yourself for this God and here you are in this position and he's not even going to help you my isn't that just the devil that's just the devil that's why it's so beautiful he gave us the instruction it's only the only evidence is the ability to receive this word brothers and sisters it's not whether we can feel it it's not whether we can see it it's not whether we can produce it in fact we're not supposed to produce it we're just supposed to say Amen to it that's it that is all there is those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his Works while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride and she knows that you know that tonight if you don't know that I want to tell you tonight he works in and through his bride that's why he has a bride on Earth CU he wants to work in and through her and she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time now brothers and sisters I just think it's so beautiful here because he doesn't say here through the prophet God speaking the Holy Ghost inspiring the pen to write he doesn't say he will now fulfill through the prophet that work which he left for this specific time he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for the specific time and so I want to say brothers and sisters don't be looking in the future sometime out there for the specific time and don't look back and think well there was such a good specific time we had this thing happening back there and it was such a good specific time you know there's times in our life we're good like that but what about right now what about here right now in this building brothers and sisters there's enough Dynamic power to stop every single devil in hell in this building right here now tonight amen it's not something that we need to look for in the future maybe someday when we when we see Jesus when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be what about right now we've got the Holy Ghost we've got every single reason to Rejoice oh my we've only got 11 minutes left and and now I want to get started with what I wanted to preach tonight my goodness paragraph 70 I'll just I'll just start this and we'll pick up later it's f now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb remember the study in Joshua and Caleb this this just it gets me ignited here our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now our Promised Land brothers and sisters isn't somewhere it's not somewhere it's not a geographical location our promised land is Christ Jesus our promised land is the Holy Ghost our promised land is the Fruit of the Spirit in our lives our Promised Land Is The Headstone coming down and fitting on the body our our Promised Land Is Knowing exactly what our husband wants done and then fulfilling his word in this earth our promised land is coming into sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua how many calebs do we have here tonight I think this is just such an amazing thing remember this is the Holy Ghost speaking to the church amen remember God had started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different my he was their leader he was their Captain he was the one who was actually taking them and leading them and guiding them but what did they want they wanted a king why did they want a king because they started to look around remember the word of God said don't look to the right hand or to the left hand just stick with me remember God had started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day Church notice how God did not move Israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his own appointed time now the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leader and said the land is ours let's go take it Joshua you are all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have you used to hear from God and know the will of God and act quickly something is wrong with you now brothers and sisters I want to tell you this is I love it when it happens you ever hear Brother bam say this is fresh remember this is the Holy Ghost talking here and the Holy Ghost said Joshua is Jehovah savior Jehova savior is the Holy Ghost what happens is the Devil comes around and tries to tell us well maybe the Holy Ghost isn't as powerful Joshua maybe you've lost your commission Holy Ghost maybe you're just not as powerful Holy Ghost maybe you just don't want to deal with us maybe you just don't want to help us when we start to do that what we do is we start to say that there's three distinct persons in the Trinity of God this is Jesus Christ we go back and we say Jesus Christ we know that he's talking about Jehovah savior the promised land is the Holy Ghost but what is the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's the entirety of the message of the hour the person of Jesus Christ Living out through us how could God himself ever lose any of his anointing how could he ever lose any of his appointing how could he ever lose any part of himself but here we have this he's talking about the last day Church the land is ours let's go and take it Joshua I'm going to say Jesus God because that's what he's saying here the people are saying when they're talking about Joshua maybe you've lost your commission Joshua you're all through Holy Ghost you're all through can you imagine that that's right you must have lost your commission you don't have the power that you used to have what you used to hear from God and know the will the what you used to know the will of God we know the will of God is his word this is where the patch over comes brothers and sisters between the prophet and the bride we're able to say Amen to the prophet Amen to the office Amen to the position and the word that he brought but now what is that to you what is that word mean to you because that word means that you become the one you become the important one amen right he said there won't be two of us standing here right at the same time on Earth true and he wasn't talking about the bride he was talking about Christ himself coming to take his bride but I think this is just amazing I'm probably going to get into this a little more Joshua you're all through we know there's people trying to manifest the gifts we know there's people trying to push back to Pentecost we know that that's happening people want to see the move of God and and when you have maybe a pastor that's not willing to move from the word of God people might start to say well maybe you're through maybe you've lost your commission maybe it's just not as good as it used to be don't do that don't do that trust in the Lord amen don't let the devil say this to you this is just the same Spirit the land is ours let's go take it Joshua you're all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have my you used to hear from God and know the will of God we still know the will of God how many people still hear from God don't don't let the devil ever come around and say that maybe you lost your commission we need to be those calebs ah my it's N9 o' and I've got to quit and I really do just want to start here I'm not joking about that all of my notes are blessed be the name of the Lord we'll pick up from here but Joshua he was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word God could trust Joshua but not the others now this is where it ties together and I can tell you when I was talking about that I wasn't thinking this in my chair at home today thinking this is fresh this was God tonight speaking to us so will it repeat in the end day the same problem the same pressures we don't want to try and put God on and say you need to do this and it should be that and and unless we're doing it some other way we're not doing it trust in the Lord and put his word first and remember just like the children of Israel I'm going to get into it we will remember the children of Israel were instructed you know what up get ready because in three days from now we're going across that River into the promised land and you keep your eyes on that Ark and you know husbands Warriors you just leave your wives alone don't worry about all the Earthly things just focus on that word because that Ark is going to March and when that Ark marches you keep yourself exactly the right distance behind it not too far behind so you can't see it and not too close so that it doesn't have room to move you just keep yourself exactly in your position same thing for us today brothers and sisters I'll call them musicians I feel like I could really start preaching now and I don't want to I'll do that on on on Sunday Lord willing maybe stand with me as we close you know what Joshua will never ever lose his commission it's impossible Jehovah savior God himself can never lose his commission but it's when we start to chop them up and say well maybe it's just a little portion I think we heard it on Sunday and I think it was so beautiful that you know God talked about the ocean and he talked about the Potentials in the ocean and the elements in the ocean he talked about that through the prophet and the prophet said that if you had a spoonful of the ocean you had that entire ocean in that spoon you had elements from every single part of that ocean not the whole ocean but you had all of the elements of that ocean they will be in his very image in order to be United with him God bless you tonight let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to us Lord thank you for leading us and guiding us father for being our Jehovah savior Lord for showing us the way that we should go and Lord father tonight I just pray that we would recognize the position of Caleb the position that Caleb had beside Joshua supporting him encouraging Him Father there has to be those father that are willing to just simply take you at your word there has to be a bride father Lord we're so thankful that we can put ourselves there Lord not because we just decide to because father you called us to be there amen Lord tonight I pray that you would just go with us as we go our separate ways father that we would consider the words that were spoken Lord Jesus and father that we would just see how they apply in our own lives and father that we could look into the mirror of your word each one of us yes Lord and father Lord that we would stop seeing ourselves and that we would start seeing you reflecting back to us Lord father I pray that that would be the testimony of the world
