[9:35] Heavenly Father, Lord, we come before
[9:37] you, dear Lord. We want to say thank
[9:39] you, Lord, for the day you gave us
[9:40] today, Lord God. Thank you for watching
[9:43] over us and keeping us. Heavenly Father,
[9:45] Lord, for being in everything we did,
[9:47] Lord God. Lord, we want to come before
[9:49] you, Lord, and first ask if there's any
[9:51] sin, any iniquity, Lord Jesus. Lord,
[9:53] just ask you to forgive us, Lord, and
[9:55] blood it out with your shed blood,
[9:56] heavenly father. Lord,
[9:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, we set this time aside, Lord. We
[10:00] want to come into worship you, heavenly
[10:01] father. We ask that you you'd come in
[10:03] your spirit of worship, Lord Jesus.
[10:05] Lord, Lord, we just lift our voices to
[10:07] you, Lord, and praise you, Lord Jesus,
[10:09] for that's what you've created us for,
[10:10] heavenly father. Lord, we just ask that

[10:14] would come behind this desk, heavenly
[10:15] father. Lord, would you anoint him with
[10:17] your word, Lord, and speak to us, Lord,

[10:32] Lord, we'd worship you in spirit and in
[10:34] truth tonight, heavenly father. Lord,

[11:10] rapture, the catching away? We know that
[11:12] we're well into the rapture, the shout,
[11:15] the voice, the trump, but the catching
[11:18] away is just any day now. One of these
[11:20] glorious mornings, we're going to see
[11:22] our dead Christ raised and shake hands,
[11:25] hug one another's neck, and 30 to 40
[11:27] days, we'll be lifted from this earth to
[11:30] join our Lord in the air. Let's sing it
[11:31] this evening with joy in our hearts,
[11:34] expectation.
[11:35] Well, I am thinking of the rapture in
[11:39] our blessed home on high when the
[11:43] redeemed
[11:46] are gathering in.
[11:49] Oh, how we'll raise that heavenly anthem
[11:53] in that city in the sky when the
[11:57] redeemed
[11:59] are gathering in.
[12:03] Oh
[12:06] my go
[12:31] will be a Great procession over on those
[12:35] streets of gold with the redee.
[12:44] Oh music
[12:48] that will be told when the redee.
[12:55] Aren't you glad you're redeemed tonight?
[12:57] Oh,
[13:00] heat, heat.
[13:11] Oh sh.
[13:24] Oh, saints will sing redemption story
[13:28] with their voices near
[13:32] the red
[13:34] are gathering in
[13:38] all the angels
[13:41] for they cannot join that song when we
[13:48] are.
[13:51] Oh,
[13:54] heat,
[14:01] heat.
[14:11] Our
[14:15] gathering here
[14:19] the Savior will give us to
[14:24] make the Lord when the redee
[14:28] I can't
[14:33] hear that.
[14:45] Heat. Heat.
[14:59] Yes.
[15:12] Yes. When the reading
[15:16] are gathering
[15:20] like snow
[15:23] and
[15:25] oh yes
[15:29] and will see
[15:41] what the prophets say. But what did the
[15:42] angel tell him? Nothing but perfect love
[15:45] will enter there. So let me walk blessed
[15:49] Lord in the way thou has gone, leading
[15:54] straight to that land of God.
[16:01] Oh, cheer everywhere
[16:04] to the
[16:07] Lord.
[16:09] Every day we go.
[16:16] Every day we die.
[16:30] All the while with my soul.
[16:35] Fill my way every day with love.
[16:41] Love the second verse. Keep me close to
[16:44] the side of my savior and guide.
[16:50] Never
[16:56] keep my hand free
[16:59] and my soul satisfied
[17:03] till I

[17:10] I

[17:36] Oh, soon this grace will be born and I'm
[17:41] st
[17:45] in my home.
[17:48] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[17:58] Heat.
[18:05] Heat.
[18:16] Oh
[18:21] my
[18:24] god.
[18:45] Oh
[18:47] my
[18:56] god.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[19:14] the Lord tonight.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Just an impromptu song. Um, but you're
[19:20] going to help me tonight. I pray it
[19:21] blesses us all. It's a song we know. Can
[19:24] you please put up Mercy walked in?
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Mercy walked in.
[19:53] I stood in
[19:55] the courtroom.
[19:58] The judge turned my way.
[20:03] It looks like you're guilty
[20:08] now. What do you say?
[20:15] I spoke up
[20:18] your honor.
[20:20] I have no
[20:23] defense.
[20:25] But that's when
[20:28] mercy
[20:30] walked in.
[20:33] Oh,
[20:36] mercy
[20:38] walked in
[20:41] and pleaded
[20:43] my case.
[20:46] Called to
[20:48] the stand.
[20:51] not saving
[20:54] grace.
[20:56] The blood was
[20:58] presented
[21:01] that covered my sin,
[21:08] forgiven.
[21:11] When mercy
[21:13] walked me,
[21:19] I stood there
[21:21] and wondered
[21:24] how could
[21:26] this be
[21:29] that someone so guilty
[21:34] had just been set free.
[21:40] Oh
[21:42] my chains
[21:44] they were broken
[21:47] and I felt more
[21:50] again. All the moments
[21:55] that mercy
[21:57] walking.
[22:00] Oh, join me. Sing now. Say, "Mercy
[22:05] walking
[22:08] and ped
[22:10] by
[22:13] called to the stand.
[22:18] of saving
[22:21] grace
[22:23] that God was
[22:26] presented.
[22:29] It covered all our sins,
[22:36] forgiven
[22:39] when mercy
[22:41] walking.
[22:44] Oh
[22:46] mercy
[22:48] walked in
[22:51] and pleaded
[22:54] my case
[22:57] called to the stand.
[23:02] God saving
[23:04] grace.
[23:07] The blood was
[23:09] presented
[23:12] and covered
[23:14] my s
[23:19] forgiven
[23:22] when mercy
[23:24] walking.
[23:29] Amen.
[23:33] Amen.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise his name. Thank you, my
[23:41] brother. Stand with me if you would.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Lots could be said about that song.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Guilty as charged and then mercy walked
[23:51] in. Wow.
[23:53] Predestinated to receive this truth
[23:55] before the world ever began in his
[23:58] thoughts. Blessed be his name. I'm sure
[23:59] there's a poem for brother Don.
[24:02] Lots of things could be woven into that.
[24:05] The grace of the Lord is wonderful.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Reach out and touch him. He's here
[24:10] tonight to be touched. I believe he's
[24:11] here. He promises. Our brother prayed
[24:13] this morning or this evening. He's here.
[24:16] No doubt about it. He's here. He
[24:17] promised and he keeps all his
[24:19] appointments. Aren't you glad for that?
[24:22] Well, we reach out
[24:25] and touch the Lord
[24:29] as he passes.
[24:34] Oh, you'll find
[24:36] he's not too busy
[24:39] to hear your heart cry.
[24:45] He's passing
[24:48] by this morning.

[25:17] Oh, you'll find

[25:23] to hear your heart's cry.
[25:28] He's passing
[25:31] by this morning,
[25:34] your knees to supply.
[25:38] Oh, just reach out
[25:41] and touch the Lord
[25:44] as he

[26:14] to sing a song to you.
[26:18] a song of praise and honor for all the
[26:23] things you've kept us through.
[26:27] You gave a life worth living,
[26:31] a life in love with you,
[26:36] and now I just love giving all of my
[26:41] praises back to you. Oh, you're the
[26:45] father of creation.
[26:49] You're the risen lamb of God.
[26:53] You're the one who walked away
[26:58] from the empty tomb that day. And you
[27:02] set your people free
[27:07] in love and liberty.
[27:11] Now I can walk with you
[27:15] every night and every day.
[27:20] Every night and every day. Oh, you're
[27:24] the father of creation.
[27:28] You're the risen lamb of God.
[27:33] You're the one who walks away
[27:37] from me
[27:46] with love and
[27:51] we walk with you
[27:55] every night and every day.
[27:59] every night, every day.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to
[28:06] the house of the Lord. Certainly an
[28:08] honor and a privilege to gather
[28:10] together.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; The way that he's ordained for us
[28:13] &gt;&gt; on this side of eternity.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; We're very thankful to have brother
[28:18] Ethan Hammermeister and brother Maxwell
[28:22] Bang Jr. here with us. I'm certainly
[28:25] honored to be able to call them friends.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that uh the Lord has given
[28:30] brother Maxwell
[28:32] &gt;&gt; something for us tonight.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; And I believe that it's our privilege to
[28:38] be able to pull on that word.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Because it's not going to be brother
[28:42] Maxwell Bang speaking to us tonight.
[28:45] It's going to be the King of Kings and
[28:47] Lord of Lords. We've already declared
[28:49] this meeting to be in his name. So, he's
[28:51] already here with us according to his
[28:53] word.
[28:54] There's a lot that I would like to say,
[28:56] but I'm just going to save it. We're
[28:58] certainly thankful that the Lord brought
[29:00] Brother Joel back home safely.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; He was in Fernie for a few days, and I'm
[29:05] sure the roads were pretty slick. We
[29:08] just want to continue to remember
[29:10] brother Mvin in our prayers as he
[29:13] ministers the word
[29:14] &gt;&gt; in Japan before he goes over to
[29:16] Philippines.
[29:18] If you have a need tonight, by all
[29:20] means, just make it known unto him as we
[29:22] go to him in prayer.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we're so
[29:27] thankful that we can call upon your name
[29:29] tonight.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Father, we're so thankful that Lord, not
[29:32] only can we call upon you, but you
[29:34] answer.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; You always hear our prayers, Lord.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; And Father, where else could we go in
[29:41] this life, but to you,
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Father? We just want to thank you for
[29:45] keeping us all safe on the roads today,
[29:47] Lord. and as we travel for bringing our
[29:50] brothers safely down from Edmonton,
[29:52] Lord.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just
[29:54] bless them and their their journey here,
[29:56] Father.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Father, bless their time with us, Lord.
[30:00] Lord,
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just
[30:02] continue to be with Brother Mvin, Lord,
[30:04] and Sister Fay in Japan, Lord. And that
[30:08] you would just minister to the bride
[30:10] over there through our brother, Lord.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, when he goes to
[30:14] Philippines that you would continue to
[30:16] just break yourself
[30:18] &gt;&gt; to the people, Lord, open that word
[30:20] through our brother. We ask. And
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Father, we just thank you that we can
[30:24] gather together tonight in your name.
[30:26] Amen.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; We just want to commit each and every
[30:28] need that was made known unto you
[30:30] tonight, Lord, by the way of an uplift
[30:32] hand. We know that you know the need. We
[30:35] know that you already have the solution,
[30:37] Father.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; We just commit them all into your hands.
[30:40] And we thank you, Father, for your
[30:42] answers to our prayers.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, as we turn to you, we just
[30:46] want to commit all the words that are
[30:48] spoken. Father, we know that our
[30:50] thoughts here on earth are louder
[30:54] &gt;&gt; than our voices are
[30:56] &gt;&gt; in heaven. Father, we just want to
[30:58] commit the words that are spoken, the
[31:00] thoughts in our hearts into your hands
[31:03] for your care. Lord, we pray that you
[31:05] would be glorified with every single
[31:07] aspect of our service now. In Jesus
[31:10] Christ's name we pray.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song? Touching
[31:16] Jesus is all that really matters.
[31:19] Certainly thankful that Brother Maxwell
[31:21] has come to minister. I've known Brother
[31:24] Max for a few years now. introduced a
[31:27] couple times a couple of meetings, but
[31:29] we've been on a an online Bible study
[31:32] for years. I think uh we're talking
[31:34] about it tonight. I think since co since
[31:37] 2020, we've been on the same study.
[31:39] We've been going through some really
[31:40] good stuff. But we're certainly thankful
[31:42] to have him here with us tonight. We
[31:45] know how it goes. If you go to Poland,
[31:46] he'll go to preaching and God will
[31:48] minister to our needs.
[31:51] Touching Jesus
[31:54] is all
[31:56] that really matters.
[32:02] And your life
[32:04] will never be
[32:08] the same.
[32:13] And there's only
[32:16] one way
[32:19] to come
[32:26] when you call
[32:30] his name.
[32:32] Amen. Touching Jesus.
[32:34] Touching Jesus
[32:38] is all
[32:40] I really need.
[32:48] will
[32:51] the same
[33:01] way.
[33:14] Let's sing it one more time.
[33:17] Oh, touch him Jesus.
[33:21] It's all
[33:29] your life
[33:31] forever.
[33:43] always
[33:46] searching
[33:50] just
[33:53] &gt;&gt; when you call on his name.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we just want to say
[34:01] thank you tonight, Lord. And father, we
[34:04] thank you to once again, Lord, we can
[34:05] come into your presence, Lord.

[36:45] and the trust to have us come and and
[36:47] share the word of the Lord this evening.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; And uh I I know you've not come to see
[36:52] me cuz if you came to see me, you're
[36:54] going to be disappointed, but I believe
[36:57] that you came to see the Lord. Amen. He
[36:59] is faithful and he knows our needs.
[37:02] Amen. And and I believe that he's he has
[37:05] an appointment with us this weekend.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but I I
[37:10] have been praying and it's been it's
[37:12] been very special.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; It's been just just just felt God just
[37:17] moving in a special way even as we've
[37:19] been praying and and I believe that he
[37:22] he he has something that he has to speak
[37:24] to us and
[37:25] &gt;&gt; and to do for us. And you know, I know
[37:28] sometimes in the service we can be
[37:29] distracted,
[37:31] &gt;&gt; but I just say, let's give him undivided
[37:33] attention. Amen. And and just stay there
[37:36] and pull on the word. Amen. And and and
[37:38] allow God to minister to us.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I've come with a set of
[37:43] notes, but I told the Lord I'm willing
[37:45] to go off the notes. I've told the Lord
[37:48] I'm willing to do whatever he desires.
[37:50] And so,
[37:51] &gt;&gt; and I believe that God wants to minister
[37:53] personally to everyone. You know, we are
[37:56] coming to a time where we know that the
[37:57] coming of the Lord is very close and and
[38:00] we we we don't want to find ourselves
[38:02] unprepared. Amen. And and neither do we
[38:04] want to be in a place where we're
[38:06] missing the blessings that have been
[38:07] given to us or be in a place where the
[38:10] spirit of the Lord is moving and we we
[38:12] we just, you know, out of it. We want to
[38:14] be in a place that if God is dealing
[38:16] with us that we ready to respond and if
[38:18] God is speaking to our hearts, we're
[38:20] ready to open our hearts and receive the
[38:22] word. Amen. And that's our desire. And
[38:24] that's been our burden on our hearts.
[38:26] And and that's what we we we're trusting
[38:28] and believing that the Lord will do for
[38:30] us in these meetings. Amen. Amen. We
[38:33] sure do bring greetings from our pastor,
[38:35] brother Ed Hammer Meister in in Edmonton
[38:37] and the saints over there. Brother Ed
[38:40] really wanted to make sure that I
[38:42] brought greetings to you, brother Barry.
[38:44] And to the saints here and and also
[38:46] brother Jerry Fox do send us greetings.
[38:48] Some of you know brother Jerry Fox and
[38:51] he really send us love and greetings to
[38:53] you all. and and uh we we we thank the
[38:55] Lord. Amen. We we grateful to him and
[38:59] again as we said we we we appreciate the
[39:02] invitation to be here. Amen. Amen. Maybe
[39:06] let's just take a Bibles this evening.
[39:08] Thank you musicians. Amen. God bless
[39:09] you. Go to the book of Judges this
[39:12] evening.
[39:20] Judges chapter 16. Amen.
[39:23] Judges chapter 16.
[39:26] Some of you that don't know me, well, I
[39:28] think my name has been mentioned. I am
[39:30] brother Max and full name is Maxwell.
[39:33] Maxwell Bang Jr. And um I'm junior
[39:36] because my dad is brother Maxwell as
[39:38] well. And uh we we we have been serving
[39:42] the law for the past I think 13 years
[39:44] now. And uh been ministering for the
[39:47] past nine years. And uh we we we we were
[39:51] born and raised in a believer's home. My
[39:53] dad is a minister of the gospel in
[39:55] Ireland and uh held sight with brother
[39:58] brother Andrew. Good to see sister Nave.
[40:01] Amen. And uh good to have some Irish
[40:04] person in the church.
[40:07] Amen. So uh my dad ministers in Ireland
[40:11] and uh we we we grew up believing the
[40:14] message and but you know we we we it's
[40:17] one thing to be born in the message
[40:20] &gt;&gt; and it's one thing to become the
[40:21] message.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen many of us you can be born
[40:25] in the message but until you become the
[40:27] message you're just born in it.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so for for a very long
[40:32] time in my life, I I was just born in
[40:34] the message and I was just around the
[40:36] message and you know I was was serving
[40:38] the Lord but you know I was was drawn in
[40:40] the world and at different ends but God
[40:43] got a hold of me when I moved to Ireland
[40:46] and begin to turn my life around and and
[40:49] uh not long after that he called us to
[40:51] the ministry and and he's been faithful.
[40:54] Amen. It's nothing that I did what he
[40:56] did and we we're grateful to the Lord
[40:59] for it. Amen. Amen. So Judges chapter
[41:02] 16, we'll read from verse 27 to verse
[41:05] 30. Amen. Judges 16, verse 27 to verse
[41:09] 30. Amen.
[41:13] So now the case was full of men and
[41:15] women, and all the lords of the
[41:17] Philistines were there. And there were
[41:20] upon the roof about 3,000 men and women
[41:23] that beheld while Samson made it part.
[41:26] And Samson called unto the Lord and
[41:28] said,"Oh Lord God, remember me, I pray
[41:31] thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee,
[41:34] only this once, oh God, that I may be at
[41:38] once avenge of the Philistines for my
[41:41] two eyes."
[41:43] And Samson took a hold of the two middle
[41:45] pillars upon which the haze stood
[41:49] and on which it was born up
[41:52] of the one with his right hand and of
[41:55] the other with his left. And Samson
[41:57] said, "Let me die with the Philistines."
[42:01] And he bailed himself with all his
[42:03] might. And the haze fell upon the Lord
[42:06] and upon all the people that were
[42:08] therein. So the dead which he slew at
[42:12] his death were more than they which is
[42:15] slew in his life.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessing to
[42:19] the reason of the word. Amen. You may
[42:22] have your seat. Amen.
[42:30] Want to speak for for a few moments.
[42:32] Amen. And
[42:34] on restoring a shaven experience.
[42:38] Restoring a shaven experience. Amen.
[42:43] Restoring a shaven experience.
[42:46] Amen.
[42:47] You know, there's something based on
[42:49] experience. Amen. How many have ever had
[42:51] an experience before?
[42:53] &gt;&gt; There is something based on experience.
[42:55] Amen. When you have an experience,
[42:57] whatever the experience is, Amen. There
[43:00] is something that you can identify.
[43:02] Amen. With that experience, Amen. You
[43:06] take for example, how many have ever
[43:08] been sick before? If you've never been
[43:10] sick before, you're quite the creature.
[43:12] Amen. But I believe that everyone has
[43:14] been sick before. Amen. And and and you
[43:17] can identify with with what comes with
[43:19] sickness. Amen. You've experienced what
[43:21] it is like to be sick. And you can
[43:24] identify with the pain that comes with
[43:26] being sick. And you can identify with
[43:28] the weakness, the discomfort that comes
[43:30] with being sick. Amen. And how many of
[43:32] us have had an experience with God
[43:34] before? Hallelujah.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so if you've had an
[43:37] experience with God before, again, you
[43:40] can identify, Amen, with God's saving
[43:42] power. Amen. You can identify with the
[43:45] saving grace. Amen. You can identify
[43:48] with his suffering, with his healing.
[43:50] Amen. You can identify with him being
[43:52] Jehovah Gyra. Amen. The God that
[43:55] provides all our needs. Amen. We can
[43:57] identify with him to being the one that
[43:59] makes aware where there is no way. Amen.
[44:02] We're the one that, you know, the calms,
[44:03] the raging. See, we can identify with
[44:05] all these things. Why? Because we have
[44:08] had an experience with God. Amen. We
[44:11] know the God is real. Amen. We are a
[44:14] witness of the realities of God. Amen.
[44:17] And we stand steadfast on these
[44:20] experiences that we have. Amen. Because
[44:23] it's something that is personal to us.
[44:25] Amen. So we stand firm upon them. Amen.
[44:28] No one can move us away from those
[44:30] experience. Amen. Are you with me this
[44:32] evening? No one can move us away from
[44:35] those experience. Amen. Those experience
[44:38] that we will have is not an experience
[44:40] that we had from maybe our dad telling
[44:42] us about us. Amen. It's not an
[44:44] experience that we had from the pastor
[44:47] telling us about it. But this is an
[44:48] experience that we had personally with
[44:51] God. Amen. It is our own experience.
[44:54] Amen. We were there when God came on the
[44:57] scene. Amen. We were there when God
[44:59] visited us and began to turn our lives
[45:01] around. We were there when God be to do
[45:04] a miracle in our life. Amen. Brother
[45:06] Brandham will say that the greatest
[45:07] miracle that has ever happened to us.
[45:09] Amen. And is the change of a sinner into
[45:12] a saint. Amen. It is for you going down
[45:15] a certain path and all of a sudden God
[45:17] turns you around. Amen. And changes your
[45:20] life. Amen. To a place. Amen. Where you
[45:23] are not the same anymore. Amen. Your
[45:25] language has changed. Amen. And your
[45:27] actions have changed. Amen. Everything
[45:30] about you has changed. What is it? It is
[45:32] an experience that has caused it. Amen.
[45:34] Because you have come face to face with
[45:37] God. Amen. You remember Moses. Amen.
[45:40] Listen. He was a man that was called
[45:41] Amen to deliver God's people. Are you
[45:44] with me this evening? He was called to
[45:46] deliver God's people. Amen. But but we
[45:48] see we see that he tried to do it in his
[45:50] own self with his own strength and and
[45:52] with his own might. Amen. And and we saw
[45:55] that he became a failure of it and and
[45:57] ended up on the back side of the desert.
[45:59] Amen. And it felt like that there was no
[46:01] way for him probably gave an openness
[46:03] commission. Amen. But but he there was a
[46:05] moment where he had an experience with
[46:07] God. Amen. And that experience with God,
[46:10] Amen, brought him back, amen, to his
[46:13] purpose again. Are you with me this
[46:15] evening? Amen. Each and every one of us
[46:17] were born with a purpose in our life.
[46:19] Amen. And what is going to bring us to
[46:21] that purpose, Amen, is an experience
[46:24] with God.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, for Moses to go back to
[46:28] fulfill his purpose of delivering, Amen.
[46:30] God's children, he had to have an
[46:32] experience with that burning bush. Amen.
[46:35] He had to meet face to face with God.
[46:38] Amen. And that's what God wants from his
[46:41] children. Amen. That we may have an
[46:43] experience with him and meet face to
[46:44] face with him in time tested faith.
[46:47] Amen. Brother man was saying is that no
[46:49] person has a right to call themselves a
[46:52] Christian until first they've had an
[46:55] experience with God.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; So we can't even call ourselves to be
[47:02] Christians if we haven't had an
[47:04] experience with God.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; In order for us to call ourselves
[47:10] Christians, we must have had an
[47:12] experience with God. And you see today,
[47:15] Satan is busy trying to keep the church
[47:18] away from an experience.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Satan is very busy trying to keep the
[47:24] church away from an experience with God.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Because Satan knows Amen. Are you with
[47:31] me? Satan knows the effect of an
[47:34] experience with God.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows the effect of an
[47:40] experience with God. Listen, he thought
[47:42] that he had Moses whipped.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[47:46] &gt;&gt; But when Moses had an experience with
[47:48] God, the story changed.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; So, Satan is very very busy to make sure
[47:54] that the believer never comes to a place
[47:57] where they have a personal experience
[48:00] with God.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that experience, Amen, is
[48:04] something that can change the person's
[48:06] life. That experience can bring God
[48:09] Christ on the inside of that person.
[48:12] That experience can bring that person to
[48:14] the revelation of who they are. Amen.
[48:17] That experience can bring that person to
[48:19] a place where they believe for things
[48:21] that are impossible. Amen. They believe
[48:24] for things that Amen has no reason to
[48:27] even believe for them. But because
[48:29] they've had an experience with God,
[48:31] amen, they can stand firm upon the word
[48:34] and say this can happen. Why? Because
[48:37] God said so. Because all we experience
[48:39] is healing power. Amen. So whether it be
[48:42] cancer, whether it be TB, if he was able
[48:45] to heal me of a tooth ache, he's still
[48:47] the same God and he's still able to heal
[48:50] me. Whether it be cancer, it be any
[48:52] disease of my life, he's more than able
[48:54] to still heal me again. Why? Because I
[48:57] have had an experience.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And there are many people we can call on
[49:02] the Bible when know Paul. Amen. He he
[49:05] was on on a certain amen.
[49:08] Now I want you to notice that Paul a man
[49:10] believed that what he was doing was
[49:13] right.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. In going and persecuting the
[49:17] Christians. Amen. He believed that it
[49:19] was right. It was the right thing to do.
[49:21] Amen. And you know sometimes we we we
[49:23] can be so consumed and be going down a
[49:26] certain path. Amen. And feel like this
[49:28] is the right thing for me to do. Amen.
[49:31] But God came by his way in the form of a
[49:34] pillar of fire. Amen. And begin to say,
[49:37] Paul, Amen. Why are you persecuting me?
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to notice that Paul
[49:44] recognized that it was God.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul recognized that it was God.
[49:49] And I think it's very important for the
[49:51] believer that when Amen. God comes by
[49:53] your way that we recognize that it is
[49:56] God.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That it is God speaking to me.
[49:59] Amen. And when God begin to speak to us
[50:02] and listen Paul was determined and he
[50:04] knew there is no way that I am wrong.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; But now when he asked that voice and say
[50:10] you know who are you?
[50:12] &gt;&gt; And he said that I am Jesus.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now now then now then now then now
[50:16] then now then now then now then now then
[50:16] now then now then now Paul begin to say
[50:17] but wait a minute how can you be Jesus?
[50:20] There is only one Lord and and and
[50:22] that's the only thing we've known as
[50:23] Israelites. And and now you were telling
[50:25] me and he begin to cast a revelation.
[50:28] You begin to see then God is showing me
[50:31] something that I have never seen before.
[50:33] God is moving me to a greater revelation
[50:36] of who he really is. Amen. Now, it was
[50:38] up to Paul to say, "Listen, Lord, if
[50:41] this is you, I'm going to follow you."
[50:43] It was up to Paul to say, "Oh, I don't
[50:45] care whether this is God or not. I'm
[50:47] just going to go ahead and do what I am
[50:49] doing." But you see, Paul was very
[50:51] sensitive.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; That he said, "If this is the Lord, I
[50:54] will follow through." Amen. He had an
[50:57] experience.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; That turned him around.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. An experience is so important. So
[51:04] Satan heads, Amen. to see the church
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; have an experience with God.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; And when we talk about an experience,
[51:12] Amen. We we're not just talking about a
[51:14] one and done 10.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:18] But we're talking about a constant
[51:20] encounter with God, a constant
[51:23] fellowship with God, a a constant
[51:26] connection with God. Amen. And tonight,
[51:28] as I'm talking about the church, Amen. I
[51:31] am not just talking about the church as
[51:33] as just the body that is here. But you
[51:35] know that you are the church.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are the church. Amen. You are
[51:41] the call to one. Each and every
[51:43] individual of us, we bring and make
[51:45] together the body of Christ. Ask the
[51:48] church. Amen. And so I'm not just
[51:50] referring to to the group, but I'm
[51:53] speaking to you personally.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask the church. Ask the called
[51:57] age. Amen. So Satan hates Amen. And the
[52:00] reason he hates to see the church, we as
[52:04] individual come in in contact with God
[52:07] continually is because when we come in
[52:10] contact with God, we becomes the
[52:12] dynamics
[52:14] &gt;&gt; of the church.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me this
[52:18] evening?
[52:19] &gt;&gt; When we are constantly in contact with
[52:21] God,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; we become the dynamics.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Of the church.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Now, we know this quote very well,
[52:28] brother Brandham. What shall I do with
[52:30] Jesus called Christ?
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Is that the dynamics of this church will
[52:35] be a refilling of the Holy Spirit.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. that that we have worked in a
[52:41] small measure while the headstone is
[52:45] coming down to unite with the body.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; You stay with me.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; It said but when that head and body
[52:52] anoint together.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; It said the full power of the Holy Ghost
[52:57] will raise her up just exactly like
[53:00] that. Even the dead that's dead in
[53:03] Christ for hundreds of years ago will
[53:06] rise in the beauty of his holiness.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; And take a Floyd to the skies. The
[53:12] dynamics is the Holy Spirit.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; So a constant encounter with God, amen,
[53:20] makes us the dynamics of the church.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It brings a man in contact with
[53:26] the head. Now let me say this now.
[53:28] Brother Brandham here. He said that when
[53:29] the headstone is coming down to unite
[53:32] with the body. But let me declare to you
[53:34] tonight that the headstone has come
[53:36] down. Listen church, we are no longer
[53:39] talking about a future event. Are you
[53:41] with me this evening? It is no longer
[53:44] future event that is coming. It is here.
[53:47] Amen. The headstone is here. Amen. The
[53:50] headstone is united now with the body.
[53:53] Are you with me this evening? And that's
[53:55] why I'm saying it is so important. Amen.
[53:58] that we don't miss the moving of the
[54:00] spirit, that we don't miss the moving of
[54:03] God in our lives. Amen. Even in this
[54:06] meetings, amen, as God will begin to
[54:08] move, we ought to be careful not to miss
[54:10] that moving. Amen. Because listen, the
[54:13] hapstone is here. We're not waiting for
[54:16] it.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is come. It is here. It is
[54:19] anointed. The dynamics is here. The Holy
[54:23] Spirit is here. Amen. What is the
[54:25] hapstone here to do? It is here to lift
[54:28] the church up.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, many times we talking
[54:33] about the resurrection and and we always
[54:35] thinking about the resurrection of the
[54:36] dead that we buried. It's true. We're
[54:40] going to have that resurrection.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; But there is a resurrection now.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a resurrection now.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; In the rising of the sun, I believe
[54:51] brother say what a resurrection this is.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. And listen, it wasn't the
[54:58] resurrection of the saints,
[55:00] &gt;&gt; but there was a resurrection taking
[55:02] place. And brother Ben said, "What a
[55:04] resurrection this is." What is this
[55:07] resurrection? Amen. It is Christ being
[55:10] risen in you.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; It is Christ risen in you to bring you
[55:15] in your rightful position as a son and
[55:18] daughter of God.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this resurrection
[55:24] &gt;&gt; rising us from our dead works of sin.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Into a into the glorious liberty
[55:30] of Jesus Christ.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Because this bride has been called.
[55:37] Amen. To to come back into a rightful
[55:40] position
[55:41] &gt;&gt; with full power,
[55:43] &gt;&gt; with full authority,
[55:45] &gt;&gt; with full assurance
[55:47] &gt;&gt; of who she is. Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; But for this to happen, it's going to
[55:51] take a constant
[55:53] &gt;&gt; refilling,
[55:54] &gt;&gt; a constant experience,
[55:57] &gt;&gt; a constant encounter
[55:59] &gt;&gt; with God.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; The dynamics of the church. You see
[56:04] church, I believe we never have to come
[56:05] to a place where where we get away from
[56:08] from an experience with God. You know
[56:10] many times it is so easy for us to get
[56:13] to a place where we just get so content
[56:15] and and you know just just you know just
[56:18] so happy and you know we're doing well
[56:20] family's doing great and everybody's
[56:23] doing fantastic
[56:25] you know and so we just get relaxed and
[56:27] &gt;&gt; you know we we always you know we we we
[56:30] we we doing the the the chovin ministry
[56:32] you know how many know the chovin
[56:34] ministry you know is the chovin ministry
[56:37] those that you know when the word is
[56:38] being preached the chauvinist
[56:40] Oh, that's for that brother over there
[56:42] and that's for that sister over there.
[56:44] And you know, we we get into the sho
[56:47] ministry business, you know, and we
[56:49] always shoving it off to someone else
[56:51] and because we think that we good.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We think that we're doing
[56:55] fantastic. And church, I believe we are
[56:57] doing fantastic, but there is more.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening?
[57:03] &gt;&gt; There is more.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I never want to come to a place
[57:06] where I am satisfied. There is always
[57:09] more
[57:09] &gt;&gt; that we can guess. Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can because we can never run
[57:13] eyes of the Holy Spirit. It is the
[57:16] eternal spirit of God. Amen. That that
[57:18] God has released upon the bra to unfold
[57:20] this purpose in us. Amen. Because
[57:22] listen, it's the Holy Spirit that's
[57:24] going to bring us to the revelation of
[57:25] our healing. Is the Holy Spirit going to
[57:28] bring us to the revelation of our
[57:29] deliverance and our peace? Amen. See,
[57:31] God is still alive.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; God is still living. God is still
[57:36] working through his bride.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still working through you and
[57:41] me. There is another book of Acts that
[57:44] is being written again.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to read a quote that we
[57:48] know very well. If you're a believer in
[57:50] all day, you've read this quote before.
[57:52] Amen. But brother Bon begin to talk
[57:54] about the church. Amen. And the church
[57:56] age book. And it says, "Now remember
[57:58] this is that Christ and the true church
[58:00] is a continuation of the book of Acts."
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] Now I want I want us to take this
[58:06] slowly. Christ in the true church is the
[58:09] continuation of the book of acts. Now
[58:12] are we the true church?
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he said but the book of but
[58:17] the book of revelation amen shows how
[58:19] the antichrist spirit would come into
[58:22] the church and defoil it make it
[58:26] lukewarm formal and powerless.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Now this is the season that
[58:31] we're living in is the live the church
[58:34] age lukewarm powerless formal cold. Now
[58:37] that's what the antichrist spirit will
[58:39] do. Now remember what we said Satan is
[58:42] very careful that we don't have an
[58:45] experience.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Because he knows the effect of the
[58:48] experience.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; And here brother Brandham's name telling
[58:51] us that this antichrist spirit will try
[58:53] to come into the church to defoil it and
[58:55] make it look warm, cold and powerless.
[58:58] Yes.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; But it says that the book of Revelation
[59:01] said it exposes Satan revealing his
[59:04] works attempted destruction of God's
[59:06] people and the discrediting of God's
[59:09] word. It said right down to the time
[59:11] that he's cast down cast into the lake
[59:13] of fire is that he he fo that he cannot
[59:16] stand it. He knows that if the church if
[59:19] the people get the true revelation
[59:22] &gt;&gt; of the true church. Now listen to these
[59:25] things
[59:25] &gt;&gt; of what she is,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; what she stands for,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; and that she can do the greater works.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; She will be an invincible army.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Now this is you.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Listen, I am not talking about just the
[59:45] church as I'm talking about you
[59:47] personally.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; This is you.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you know who you are, what you
[59:55] stand for, that you can do the greater
[59:58] works, you will be an invincible army.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that it's time that we
[1:00:07] begin to read this message
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; for ourselves.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Behold, I sent you, Elijah the prophet.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.

[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Invisible army is that if they get the
[1:00:25] true revelation of the two spirit within
[1:00:28] the framework of the Christian church
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; and boy the spirit and and boy God's
[1:00:34] spirit discern and withstand the
[1:00:36] antichrist spirit.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Satan will be powerless before her.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to take a discernment
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; and astounding.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] Many times we discern but we don't
[1:00:53] withstand.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; We discern but we don't withstand.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; But it's going to take a discerning and
[1:01:04] a withstanding.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Of the two spirits.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] He said he he he will be talking about
[1:01:13] Satan. He said he would be as definitely
[1:01:16] twe
[1:01:18] you know as when G as when Christ
[1:01:21] bestowed his every effort to gain power
[1:01:23] over him in the desert. Yes, Satan has
[1:01:27] revelation but we love it
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; with true revelation in our lives. The
[1:01:32] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:01:36] but we will prevail over them.
[1:01:42] Man, this is you.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; This is your promise.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? This is
[1:01:50] your promise.

[1:01:53] come, amen, for us not only to discern
[1:01:56] but also to withstand, Amen. this
[1:01:59] antichrist spirit. What is the
[1:02:01] antichrist spirit? It is any spirit that
[1:02:04] is contrary to the word of God.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me this evening? any
[1:02:09] spirit that is contrary to the word of
[1:02:12] God. And again, remember, I am not
[1:02:14] talking just about the church as a body,
[1:02:16] but I'm talking about you, about me as
[1:02:19] an individual. Amen. I want that to be
[1:02:21] very clear. It's about you personally
[1:02:24] tonight. God has come to visit you
[1:02:26] tonight. He's coming to your pew tonight
[1:02:29] just as much as he came to Abraham's
[1:02:32] tent. Amen. He's made his way tonight to
[1:02:35] your tent. Amen. He's got a message for
[1:02:37] you tonight. Amen. He's coming
[1:02:40] personally to speak to your heart
[1:02:42] tonight.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only way we are going to
[1:02:46] discern and withstand amen this contrary
[1:02:49] spirit is by having the spirit of God on
[1:02:53] the inside of us. Amen. Because it is
[1:02:56] the spirit of God on the inside of us
[1:02:59] that is going to give us the revelation
[1:03:01] of the two spirits. Amen. that are
[1:03:04] operating in the framework of our lives.
[1:03:09] Amen. Because remember, there is a white
[1:03:12] dog and there is a black dog. There are
[1:03:14] two spirits, amen, that are operating in
[1:03:17] the framework of your life.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. One is trying to get you to an
[1:03:24] experience and the other one is trying
[1:03:26] to keep you away from an experience.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:36] And these two spirits, the scripture
[1:03:38] will tell us that they will be so close.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; That they could deceive us.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; But we have an assurance.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; That we cannot be deceived.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Because we have been elected.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; We've been elected for what purpose?
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. to make Satan powerless
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; before us.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; We've been elected to destroy the works
[1:04:08] of Satan.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; We've been elected to prevail against
[1:04:12] the works of the enemy.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening?
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; That's what we've been elected for. But
[1:04:18] these two spirit are going to be very
[1:04:20] close. Amen. But we have an assurance.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan has designed his scheme.
[1:04:29] Amen. his scheme that he has designed,
[1:04:31] amen,
[1:04:33] is to attempt the destruction of God's
[1:04:36] people,
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; and to discredit the word of God.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And the way he's planning on carrying
[1:04:43] out his scheme is to get us to doubt the
[1:04:47] word. Yeah.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; To get us to question the word.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; To get us to fear.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; To get us to to to Amen. to a place
[1:04:57] where we are so focused
[1:05:00] on our failures
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; and our mistakes.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice that Satan has
[1:05:07] got attacked us. And he I say this
[1:05:10] because he's done a before and he still
[1:05:13] tries it.
[1:05:15] But you see, Satan will will try to get
[1:05:16] you to a place where will try to make
[1:05:19] you think the certain things in your
[1:05:22] life is just part of your nature.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; He try to get you to think the certain
[1:05:29] things are just part of your nature
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; that you were born this way. You were
[1:05:34] made this way. It's it's been down
[1:05:36] through your your your your genes and
[1:05:38] your genetics and whatever more brother
[1:05:40] would say your human gra.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it just make you feel like
[1:05:45] this is just who I am.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; You know, he he can get you to a place
[1:05:50] that you may have. Amen. Maybe a loyal
[1:05:54] spirit or you may have a temper or you
[1:05:58] may have a tendency to be designed to be
[1:06:00] high passionate p person.
[1:06:03] It tends that we we are born with. Are
[1:06:06] you with me this evening? But now Satan
[1:06:08] will get you to a place to think that
[1:06:10] this is part of your nature.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you begin to get you to begin
[1:06:14] to feed that in
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; and still let you think this is part of
[1:06:18] your nature
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; and make you feel comfortable in it.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; And you accept it. Now when you accept
[1:06:28] it and and you take it and you say,
[1:06:30] let's take for example a lustful spirit
[1:06:32] and you take it and you accept it. Amen.
[1:06:35] And you say this is just part of my
[1:06:36] nature. Now he's gotten to your place
[1:06:39] where you're not even thinking about
[1:06:40] overcoming,
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? You're not
[1:06:45] even considering the fact to overcome it
[1:06:47] because he's made you think that this is
[1:06:50] your nature.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; You take temper. He makes you think,
[1:06:53] well, for you to fly loose is just
[1:06:55] normal.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; And so you don't even try to overcome
[1:06:59] it.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And so as he gets you to this place,
[1:07:03] Amen. And and he holds you b in this in
[1:07:05] this place. Amen. Now, an experience
[1:07:08] will come, a service will come where
[1:07:11] where God begin to moves and and he
[1:07:13] begins to deal with these things and
[1:07:14] begin to deal with these things that
[1:07:16] that you know that is part of your your
[1:07:18] life. But now you resist it because
[1:07:21] Satan has told you that is part of your
[1:07:23] nature
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; and you don't give yourself a man for
[1:07:27] God to break that band away.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening?
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] And you see the same devil that told you
[1:07:38] that this is part of your nature.
[1:07:41] He's the same one
[1:07:44] that when the presence of the Lord is
[1:07:46] coming or when when you get to a place
[1:07:48] where where you you need something from
[1:07:50] the Lord and you begin to approach the
[1:07:53] Lord and go to him in prayer or whatever
[1:07:55] it is, the same one that told you that's
[1:07:57] your nature is the same one that will
[1:07:59] come back and condemn you
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; and tell you you can't receive it
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; because of that.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; You can't receive it
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; because of that temper.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Because you're not living right,
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; but then he'll tell you, "But that's
[1:08:17] your nature."
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; But that's your nature.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; You can't overcome that.
[1:08:26] But I tell you one thing, George,
[1:08:29] my God is greater than our nature.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan can lie as much as he wants
[1:08:37] to lie.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; But let me say this. If he's been doing
[1:08:40] that to you,
[1:08:42] tonight is a good night.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; To serve him a notice.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, you're not serving him a
[1:08:50] notice. The night to say, "Listen,
[1:08:52] you've got one month to live."
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; No, this is immediate effect.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; He whispers tonight.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; This is immediate effect. You leaving
[1:09:02] tonight. Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; You were not born to be living with a
[1:09:07] temper.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? You were not
[1:09:10] born to be living with a lustful spirit.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were not born to be living
[1:09:15] with a loyal spirit.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; You were born to be a son of God. You
[1:09:20] were born to be a daughter of God. You
[1:09:22] were born to be living what the word
[1:09:24] says about you. But Satan has been loyal
[1:09:27] to you. But I say that tonight there is
[1:09:30] a spirit here that is greater than the
[1:09:33] spirit of the devil. There is a power
[1:09:35] here that is greater than the power of
[1:09:37] Satan.
[1:09:39] Amen. The presence of God is here boy as
[1:09:43] Holy Spirit to break the bands of the
[1:09:46] enemy
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; and bring a true experience to the
[1:09:50] believer.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:09:57] Oh hallelujah.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; As we said, the dynamics is here.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; The headstone is here. Christ is here.
[1:10:07] Oh, listen church. Listen. Brother
[1:10:08] Brandon will say this. Amen. He'll say
[1:10:12] this in Christ the mystery of God
[1:10:13] revealed. He'll say now notice. He say
[1:10:17] being personally
[1:10:19] identified by the original headship
[1:10:23] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:10:26] question.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; If you are personally
[1:10:32] identified
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; with the headship. Now remember the
[1:10:36] quote we read. What did he say? He said
[1:10:37] that this headstone was coming
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; and he said when he unit anoints with
[1:10:41] the with the body amen it'll be the
[1:10:44] power of the Holy Ghost on the inside
[1:10:46] offer and it will lift her up. Is that
[1:10:48] correct? That's the first quote we read.
[1:10:51] Now he is saying here amen that when you
[1:10:54] identify with that headstone with that
[1:10:56] headship with Christ coming when you
[1:10:59] identify with it he said you've got the
[1:11:02] answer to the devil's question. Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen, glory." We have the
[1:11:07] answer to the devil's question. He said,
[1:11:10] "He, Christ is risen and has paid the
[1:11:15] price."
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; And rising up the body.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Christ has risen. He's paid the price.
[1:11:24] And now he is lifting this body, you and
[1:11:27] I, up with him.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Yeah.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; He said the devil can't stand it.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; He said that's the reason why these
[1:11:37] economic ecumenical kingdoms are setting
[1:11:41] up. He said that's the reason they're
[1:11:43] all coming into into into what they
[1:11:45] doing now. He said the devil that's the
[1:11:47] reason his hell the way he is.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; His wickedness, his king has been
[1:11:56] uncovered.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:58] by the risen resurrected Christ in the
[1:12:02] headship over his body.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; The scheme of the devil has been
[1:12:09] uncovered.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; By Christ anointed with you.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Listen, church, you were raised and born
[1:12:17] to be an invincible army
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; to do the greater works.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Satan will try to keep us from
[1:12:26] an experience. Amen.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because listen, the court told us,
[1:12:30] Amen, that Satan knows that if the
[1:12:33] people,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; get the true revelation
[1:12:37] of the true church and what she is.
[1:12:40] Amen. Now, now I want you to notice what
[1:12:43] she is. Now, what she is, what are you?
[1:12:45] As I said, you are not a sinner.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Anybody believe that they're a sinner
[1:12:53] here tonight?
[1:12:57] If you claim the blood, you are not a
[1:12:59] sinner.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; You are not a failure.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; You are not a weakling.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that you are the pure,
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; virtuous,
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; sinless,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; bride of the son of the living God.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are born of the spirit
[1:13:26] of God.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; You are washed by the blood of the Lord
[1:13:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; You believe his word.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham said, "Now you are
[1:13:35] standing perfect."
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; As you never did it in the first place.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; You are perfect because he is perfect.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And then when we are talking about
[1:13:48] perfection,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I can't see lust in perfection.
[1:13:55] Are you with me?
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Now listen, we humans,
[1:14:00] there are things that will happen in our
[1:14:01] lives. There are things we'll see. Now,
[1:14:03] I'm not saying that, you know, we not we
[1:14:07] won't make mistakes. Don't get me wrong.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not saying we won't make
[1:14:11] mistakes.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; But to be dominated
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; by that spirit
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; is not what we're called to be.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah,
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; don't get I'm not saying that we're
[1:14:23] going to be, you know, we humans. We're
[1:14:24] living in this flesh that is unredeemed.
[1:14:26] That's why there is a blood for us.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We will make mistakes. Sometime
[1:14:31] without we see things we don't want to
[1:14:33] see. Amen. And sometimes we make mistake
[1:14:36] and fall. Amen. And then but listen,
[1:14:38] there is a blood that atones for us. But
[1:14:40] when it becomes the what is driving us,
[1:14:43] when it becomes something that has
[1:14:44] gotten a hold of us, when it becomes
[1:14:47] something that is completely amen has
[1:14:49] has almost taken over us to a place
[1:14:52] where Amen. we have a hard time amending
[1:14:55] a relationship with God.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Then at that point, Satan has
[1:15:00] infiltrated in our camp.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me this evening? Then
[1:15:04] he's infiltrated in our camp.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] But we have a right
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; to claim what God has given to us.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; We were born to be overcomers.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; It is overcomers that are going to live
[1:15:22] this generation. Amen. In this last day
[1:15:25] is that overcomers are going to sit with
[1:15:26] him in his throne.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "What is this brandom
[1:15:31] for?"
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Because once we know what she is,
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; that she's the pure virtuous. Amen.
[1:15:38] sinless bride of the live of the son of
[1:15:40] the living God. And what is she standing
[1:15:43] for? We standing for the word.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; She's standing for the truth. Are you
[1:15:48] with me tonight?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; And you know what? When he talks about
[1:15:51] being an invincible army, listen, we in
[1:15:54] ourselves
[1:15:56] can never be an invincible army.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; But you know what makes us invincible is
[1:16:01] the word.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; It is the word of God in us. That is
[1:16:05] what makes us invincible.
[1:16:08] Because listen, there is nothing on the
[1:16:10] face of the earth that can defeat the
[1:16:12] word of God.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; And when the word of God now has the
[1:16:16] preeminence in you, then it makes you
[1:16:18] invincible.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? When the word of God
[1:16:22] has the preeminence in you, then you
[1:16:24] have the right, Amen, and to speak to
[1:16:27] whatever spirit and defoy that spirit
[1:16:30] and push that spirit back to wherever it
[1:16:32] came from because there is authority and
[1:16:35] power in the word. Amen. The word is
[1:16:38] something that when Satan hears, he has
[1:16:40] to back off. Amen. Listen, when when he
[1:16:44] came to tempt Jesus, Amen. Listen, Jesus
[1:16:47] had lots of power that he could have
[1:16:50] used. Amen. But what did he use? He just
[1:16:53] used the word. He just spoke the word.
[1:16:56] Amen. That's all he did. That's all he
[1:16:59] used to defeat the enemy.
[1:17:02] The Bible say he did it to prove to the
[1:17:04] weakest of saints
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; that the word is more than enough.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; That the word is more than enough.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; The word is more than enough.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; But you see here as we read in the
[1:17:18] scriptures was a man by the name of
[1:17:21] Samson.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; And you see Samson,
[1:17:25] he was playing church with the word.
[1:17:29] Now remember that that where we going I
[1:17:32] don't want you to lose the train of
[1:17:33] thoughts
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; that there are two spirits in the
[1:17:36] framework
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; of our individual lives
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; and we are not only to discern but to
[1:17:42] withstand.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening?
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; And so Samson, Amen. He was playing
[1:17:47] church with the word. Amen. Samson
[1:17:51] seemed to not have caught the revelation
[1:17:54] of the two spirits that were operating
[1:17:57] in his life. Are you with me? Even
[1:18:00] though the power of God was upon Samson.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he seemed to not amen come to
[1:18:06] a place. Amen. And where he was able to
[1:18:09] discern and withstand that contrary
[1:18:12] spirit.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Let me say this church, we better defeat
[1:18:16] our enemy or destroy our enemy before
[1:18:18] our enemy destroys us.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Because he couldn't he couldn't discern
[1:18:27] it. That was what exactly brought him to
[1:18:28] his fall. But I want you to notice that
[1:18:31] Samson went to church.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Now stay with me. Samson went to church.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Samson paid his offering and to
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Samson was a faithful believer. As a
[1:18:42] matter of fact, one time Samson was
[1:18:44] bound. Amen. And he got out and pulled
[1:18:46] the gates of Gazer on his shoulders and
[1:18:49] went and stood up on a mountain.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; One time he faced the lion. Amen. And he
[1:18:53] tore the lion apart.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Samson had the power of God on
[1:18:58] him.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; But Samson had not fully surrendered to
[1:19:02] God.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? Listen, he
[1:19:06] could go to church. He could quote the
[1:19:08] quotes. He could quote the scriptures.
[1:19:10] But there was something in his heart
[1:19:12] that had not fully surrendered to God.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. There were two spirits that were
[1:19:18] operating in the life of Samson.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if Samson discerned it,
[1:19:24] Samson never bought it to withstand it.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't deceive him. But he kept on
[1:19:29] entertaining it and he kept on accepting
[1:19:32] it. Just as you know, as we said, Satan
[1:19:35] will try to get you to a place to think
[1:19:37] that is just part of your nature.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know, but maybe that's
[1:19:41] what he told Samson. It is just a part
[1:19:44] of your nature. That is just the way you
[1:19:46] born to be, Samson. You can be this way
[1:19:49] and yet you can see the power of God
[1:19:51] upon you. So what is the point of
[1:19:53] overcoming Samson?
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; What is the point? Amen. Of of even
[1:19:59] trying to be free from this.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; The power of God is still upon you.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; He still went to church and did
[1:20:11] everything.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; But he had not fully surrendered. He had
[1:20:16] not fully sold out. Listen, there came a
[1:20:18] time one time that Elijah, amen, came on
[1:20:21] a mountain called Caramel and he told
[1:20:24] the people, listen, it's time for you to
[1:20:25] make a decision. Amen. It's time for you
[1:20:28] to make a decision. If Bal is God, then
[1:20:31] serve him. But if God is God, then serve
[1:20:35] him.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? Listen,
[1:20:38] that is where we are at in this time. It
[1:20:40] is time to make a stand. It is time to
[1:20:43] make a decision. If Bal is God, then go
[1:20:46] ahead and serve him. If God is God, then
[1:20:49] it's time to dedicate and surrender all
[1:20:52] we have unto God.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you a little bit about this
[1:20:57] bad God. Because he's the God of this
[1:20:59] evil age. Are you with me? Listen. This
[1:21:02] bad God, he will give you all the riches
[1:21:04] that you want.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He will give you all the riches
[1:21:08] that you want. Amen. He He will make you
[1:21:11] feel like that you are the best. Are you
[1:21:13] with me? But at the end of it all, he's
[1:21:16] only got a hell for you.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. This bad God, listen, he will
[1:21:22] destroy your life. Are you with me?
[1:21:26] He'll tell you that forum is going a p.
[1:21:29] Are you with me this evening? He'll tell
[1:21:31] you that forum, amen, is going on many
[1:21:34] girls that you can go out with or many
[1:21:36] boys that you can go out with. This bad
[1:21:39] God will put you in a relationship and
[1:21:42] get you divorced and put you in another
[1:21:44] relationship and get you divorced again.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is all this bad God has got
[1:21:50] to offer to you.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; He'll get you to compromise on the word.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; He'll get you to sit on the pew and be a
[1:22:00] lukewarm believer. He'll get you to sit
[1:22:02] on a pew and just be warm and just be
[1:22:04] here and show your presence.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:07] just for people to know that you are
[1:22:09] doing well. But deep within your heart,
[1:22:11] you know that you are not there. Deep
[1:22:14] within your heart, you know that you're
[1:22:15] missing that experience. Deep within
[1:22:18] your heart, you know that something is
[1:22:19] missing.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; But this bad God will tell you that it's
[1:22:23] okay. This bad God will tell you that
[1:22:26] you're still coming to church. Are you
[1:22:28] with me this evening?
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; That's what this bad God will do.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you about my God. Let me
[1:22:37] tell you about this God who is not the
[1:22:39] God of this evil age, but he's the
[1:22:41] creator of this age.
[1:22:45] He's the creator of this urge. Listen,
[1:22:47] he is the God that when Bal has done
[1:22:50] destroying your life and has broken it
[1:22:52] into pieces, he's the God that will take
[1:22:55] those broken pieces. Oh, come on,
[1:22:57] church. He will take those broken pieces
[1:23:00] and he'll begin to put them back
[1:23:02] together. Amen. This is the God that I'm
[1:23:05] talking about. He is the God that he'll
[1:23:07] give you a good family.
[1:23:10] He is the God that will give you a good
[1:23:12] home. He is the God that will give you
[1:23:14] an experience, a reality of who God is.
[1:23:20] He is a God that has a mansion prepared
[1:23:23] for you. Oh, hallelujah. He's a God that
[1:23:27] will take you through a trial to give
[1:23:29] you a greater revelation of who he is.
[1:23:33] This is my God. This is the God that you
[1:23:36] are serving.
[1:23:40] Choose you this day. Who are you going
[1:23:42] to serve? If God be God, then let's
[1:23:45] serve him. If God be God, then let's
[1:23:49] walk away from this message. Oh, but I
[1:23:52] tell you, this message is more than a
[1:23:55] prophet.
[1:23:57] This message is more than quotes. This
[1:24:00] message is Jesus Christ.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; This is the God that I'm talking about.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; A full surrender.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; But Samson wanted to have one feet here
[1:24:26] and one feet there. Those days are over.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; It's time to make a decision.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; We can't be on the borderline anymore.
[1:24:36] We can't be on the fence anymore. We
[1:24:39] can't be playing church anymore. Those
[1:24:42] days are over. It's time to make a clear
[1:24:44] code decision and begin to walk with the
[1:24:47] Lord and say, "Lord, whatever it takes,
[1:24:51] I am going with you. If you taking me
[1:24:54] through the fire, I am going with you
[1:24:56] because I know that you are the fourth
[1:24:58] man that can stand in that fire and
[1:25:01] begin to blow away the fiery furnace
[1:25:05] that will try to burn me.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:25:13] Oh hallelujah.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; God once bought your strength and your
[1:25:20] heart.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] But Samson gave him his strength but not
[1:25:26] his heart. What Samson needed was a
[1:25:29] fresh experience. Amen. A fresh
[1:25:32] experience that would have quickened him
[1:25:34] to the revelation of his purpose, to the
[1:25:37] revelation of his call. That would have
[1:25:39] brought him to a place where he would
[1:25:41] have caught the revelation of the plan
[1:25:43] of God for his life. Are you with me
[1:25:45] this evening? That he was born to defeat
[1:25:48] the Philistines. He wasn't born to
[1:25:50] compromise with them, but he was born to
[1:25:53] defeat them. Oh, come on. Come on,
[1:25:55] church. He was born to destroy and
[1:25:58] deliver the children of Israel. He was
[1:26:01] born to possess the gates of the enemy.
[1:26:03] But there was a deloer.
[1:26:08] There was a deloer that was pulling him
[1:26:10] back. A deloer of unforgiveness that was
[1:26:14] pulling him back. Oh, he will let him go
[1:26:16] just a little bit, but then he'll pull
[1:26:18] him back again. Are you with me?
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Deoya,
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; oh church,
[1:26:29] the spirit of deoila
[1:26:31] will try to stop the church from a true
[1:26:33] experience.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Will try to stop the church from a
[1:26:37] true experience. But listen, church,
[1:26:40] this bride was born to be an invincible
[1:26:43] army. This bride was born to make Satan
[1:26:47] powerless before her. That is what you
[1:26:50] were born to do. Not to compromise but
[1:26:54] to defeat your enemy.
[1:26:57] Are you with me tonight church? Amen. No
[1:26:59] matter which form it comes in, whether
[1:27:01] it comes in the form of sickness,
[1:27:03] whether it comes in the form of
[1:27:05] depression, whether it comes in the form
[1:27:07] of anxiety, you have been given the
[1:27:09] authority, amen, to make Satan powerless
[1:27:13] before you.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; But it's going to take a total
[1:27:24] surrender.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; It's going to take a total surrender.
[1:27:28] It's going to take a discern and a
[1:27:30] withstanding of that antichrist spirit.
[1:27:33] Oh, hallelujah. That is what it's going
[1:27:36] to take, church. Amen. Listen, brother
[1:27:39] Brandham. Here again, we'll say we've
[1:27:41] got to make a complete surrender
[1:27:44] and come to God. Is that you've got to
[1:27:46] surrender to him both soul, body, and
[1:27:49] spirit. is that everything that you are
[1:27:52] has to be surrendered to God in order
[1:27:54] that he can work his will in you and in
[1:27:58] me.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Everything has to be surrendered to him.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And the only way that God is going to
[1:28:06] work his will in our life is for us to
[1:28:10] catch the revelation of his will.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said the will of
[1:28:16] God is his word.
[1:28:18] That's right.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; And so the secret weapon or the secret
[1:28:24] strength of the believer is the
[1:28:26] revelation of the word of God
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; in our in our own life.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, because the revelation of the
[1:28:34] word will show you God's will for your
[1:28:36] life.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, when you know that is God's will
[1:28:42] for you to do something,
[1:28:45] nothing can stand against you.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, there is nobody that can
[1:28:49] talk you out of its
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; when you've got the revelation that this
[1:28:54] is the will of God for my life.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop you.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; That is the strength of the believer.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Is catching the revelation of the word
[1:29:03] of God
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; that will show us his will for our life.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Some of you when you got the revelation
[1:29:10] that that sister sitting next to you was
[1:29:12] your wife. Oh boy. There was no other
[1:29:16] boy on earth. Oh well, glory brother
[1:29:18] Tabiso.
[1:29:24] Oh
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; because you have a revelation of us
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; and no one can beat you out of that
[1:29:30] revelation.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Now I'm just going to read some few
[1:29:34] quotes here about what Brandon said
[1:29:36] about revelation
[1:29:39] and it's all in the church age. It said,
[1:29:41] "But when the church disbelieves Satan
[1:29:45] and believe the spiritual revelation of
[1:29:47] the word, the gates of hell cannot
[1:29:50] prevail against her."
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Again, he says, "It is the revelation of
[1:29:56] God that will give you authority over
[1:29:58] the devil."
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Again, he said there is nothing of such
[1:30:03] prevailing power as the revelation of
[1:30:06] the word.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the secret strength of the
[1:30:10] believer is the revelation of the word
[1:30:13] of God in our life. Amen. That is the
[1:30:16] strength of the believer. And now what
[1:30:19] is the revelation of the word of God?
[1:30:22] The revelation of the word of God is the
[1:30:25] revelation of who you are.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:30] Yes.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; The revelation of the word is the
[1:30:36] revelation of who you are.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Because you are a part of him.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Who is the word?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And when you go back to the word and
[1:30:47] begin to feed on the word and cast a
[1:30:49] revelation of God's will for your life,
[1:30:51] you cast a revelation of who you are.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; That is what makes you invincible. Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; That's why church, this is the season
[1:31:02] that we ought to feed on this message
[1:31:04] like we've never fed Hana before.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; We ought to be in the word like we've
[1:31:09] never been in the word before.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; There is where the book
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; there is where we will know who we are
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; and be an invincible army
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; and do the greater works.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] But you see, Satan fought us. Satan will
[1:31:29] foil us
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; to keep us away from that strength.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; He was deceiving him. He will fight us
[1:31:35] to keep us away from that strength. Just
[1:31:37] as he was fighting Samson to keep him
[1:31:40] away from his strength,
[1:31:44] you know, since since the church ages
[1:31:47] began, you know, brother Brandham says
[1:31:49] that, you know, Satan has been fighting.
[1:31:53] Satan was fighting the church to find
[1:31:55] the strength of the church. And you
[1:31:57] know, brother Bram said that Satan
[1:31:58] actually did find it. And he said he
[1:32:00] find it at no. I'm talking about the
[1:32:03] church ages. He said he find it at no.
[1:32:06] And he said he bobbed off the strength
[1:32:08] of the church.
[1:32:10] But you see, God had a masterpiece
[1:32:12] bright on his mind. And so he went back
[1:32:14] and begin to build a rope again. But
[1:32:17] when we say began and went through
[1:32:18] Luther and begin to break the bands of
[1:32:20] the Catholic dogma and and then went to
[1:32:23] went to Wesley when the Philadelphia age
[1:32:25] of sanctification and Pentecost with the
[1:32:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Well, brother
[1:32:29] Bham said that Satan came all the way
[1:32:31] back again and bobbed off and took away
[1:32:33] their strength again.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because for the word he gave them
[1:32:37] dogmas and he gave them creeds. for the
[1:32:40] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:42] Ghost. He gave them the speaking in
[1:32:43] tongues and he began again to take away
[1:32:46] the strength from the church.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; But God's purpose cannot fail.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; God's purpose cannot fail.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; He was determined to have a bride that
[1:32:59] will not be deceived. He was determined
[1:33:01] to have a people that will not that will
[1:33:04] not compromise and will not give up.
[1:33:06] Amen. That was what he was determined to
[1:33:09] have.
[1:33:11] And let me say this, that bride is here.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; That brid is here. He was determined to
[1:33:19] have a bride. Amen. That that Satan will
[1:33:21] be powerless before her. And she is
[1:33:24] here. And you see, Satan is fighting
[1:33:27] her. Amen. Listen, I'm not going to go
[1:33:30] through all these notes. Satan is
[1:33:32] fighting her. Are you with me this
[1:33:34] evening? Satan is fighting this bride.
[1:33:36] Amen. For what? To try to take away his
[1:33:39] strength. Just as it did to Samson. Just
[1:33:42] as it did at Noa. Just as it did to
[1:33:45] Pentecost. But she can't do it to this
[1:33:48] bride.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? She can do
[1:33:52] it to this bride because she has been
[1:33:55] born of a spirit.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen. He got Samson, but he's
[1:34:00] not going to get you. Amen. Because you
[1:34:03] have been predestinated to be
[1:34:06] victorious. You have been predestinated
[1:34:09] to be an overcomer. Amen. Listen, this
[1:34:12] is not a time for us. Amen. To be
[1:34:15] condemning ourselves.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Because you see, when Samson was in the
[1:34:20] place that he was,
[1:34:22] you see, he got to a place where he
[1:34:24] felt, I failed.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; I failed. and he realized it was my
[1:34:30] mistakes and I should have fully
[1:34:33] surrendered.
[1:34:34] I should have done this and I didn't.
[1:34:37] But let me say this truth. This is not a
[1:34:39] time
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; to be counting your mistakes.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; This is not a time to be condemning
[1:34:45] yourself.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; This is not a time to to be feeling
[1:34:48] guilty and
[1:34:50] because this is the season of
[1:34:52] restoration.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; This is the season of restoration.
[1:34:57] No matter what you've done, God is more
[1:34:59] than able to restore.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; He said that this is the season of
[1:35:04] Jubilee.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; This is the season that the trumpet
[1:35:07] assigned that that you can go free.
[1:35:10] Amen. No matter what Satan has done, God
[1:35:12] can reverse it. He has the power to
[1:35:15] reverse it. But now the question is, are
[1:35:18] you willing? Amen. The question is, have
[1:35:20] you been able to discern to know to say
[1:35:23] this is the spirit? This is the 10 that
[1:35:25] I'm fighting with. And are you willing
[1:35:27] to withstand it? Are you with me
[1:35:29] tonight? Are you willing to withstand
[1:35:31] it? And say, "Lord, I am willing. Lord,
[1:35:34] I want to give it all. Lord, I want to
[1:35:37] go all the way." Amen. Because he is
[1:35:39] here and he is willing to restore.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Because there is still a possibility.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is still not over. If God has
[1:35:50] allowed you to be in the service
[1:35:52] tonight, it means that it is still not
[1:35:54] over. That there is still a possibility
[1:35:57] that no matter what the enemy has done
[1:35:59] to you, done to your family, done to
[1:36:01] your children, there is still a
[1:36:03] possibility. Amen. You are still in a
[1:36:07] position to claim what God has
[1:36:09] rightfully given to you. You are still
[1:36:12] in a position to stand to say, "I am an
[1:36:16] invincible army." Why? because I have
[1:36:18] accepted the word of the Lord.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Listen, while Samson
[1:36:25] Amen. and was over there and and he was
[1:36:28] just grinding away and just grinding
[1:36:30] away. His eyes has been taken away and
[1:36:33] he's just grinding away. You know,
[1:36:34] sometimes that's how Satan gets us to a
[1:36:37] place where we just grinding. Are you
[1:36:39] with me? We're just grinding as
[1:36:41] believers. We're grinding in a cycle.
[1:36:44] One day we overcome, the next day we b
[1:36:47] again. Sunday we are Christians, Monday
[1:36:50] we backsliding. Are you with me tonight?
[1:36:53] And we just grinding. Grinding as
[1:36:55] believers. And we just saying, "Brother,
[1:36:58] how are you doing? I am making it,
[1:37:00] brother. I am just grinding away. I know
[1:37:02] you're making it, brother. Oh, but
[1:37:04] listen. God has got more and more for
[1:37:06] you than just a grinding. You were born
[1:37:09] to grind. You were born to overcome. Oh
[1:37:13] hallelujah. But you know what was
[1:37:15] happening while Samson was grinding and
[1:37:18] he was grinding away. There was
[1:37:20] something that was happening that the
[1:37:22] enemy was not paying attention to while
[1:37:24] he was grinding and his locks that the
[1:37:28] loyal has saved away.
[1:37:32] What has the loyal done to you? Amen.
[1:37:35] And the locks that he had shaved away
[1:37:37] while he was growing and they begin to
[1:37:40] grow again. They begin to grow again.
[1:37:43] Listen, every time that you hear the
[1:37:46] word of God, what is it? It is a lock
[1:37:49] that is trying to grow in you and you
[1:37:52] again. But you have to open yourself.
[1:37:54] You have to come to a place of a total
[1:37:57] surrender and say, "God, I messed up.
[1:38:00] God, I made a mistake. God, I allow
[1:38:04] these sins in my life for too long, but
[1:38:07] now I am well. Now I am ready for a full
[1:38:11] surrender.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; And you watch those lock begin to grow
[1:38:15] again. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; The locks begin to grow and the enemy
[1:38:23] couldn't see him. Oh, but he was growing
[1:38:26] and it was growing. Listen, every prayer
[1:38:29] is a lock that is growing. Every service
[1:38:32] is a lock that is growing. Every tape
[1:38:35] that you press play is a lock that is
[1:38:38] growing. Every scripture that you read
[1:38:41] is a lock that is growing. Don't stop.
[1:38:44] Keep growing that lock. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:38:47] Because it may feel that you've been
[1:38:49] growing them, but God has got a greater
[1:38:52] purpose for you. Because the very enemy
[1:38:54] that seemed to have had you defeated
[1:38:56] him, God is here to save him. You were
[1:38:58] born to defeat that enemy
[1:39:03] or allowed it in your life to prove to
[1:39:06] you that you are invincible.
[1:39:08] Oh, hallelujah. Listen, you may say, why
[1:39:11] have we been struggling with this for
[1:39:13] years? God allowed to prove to you that
[1:39:17] you are invincible to prove to you that
[1:39:20] he's a deliverer.
[1:39:25] But sometimes it just feels like it is a
[1:39:27] groin and a groin and a groin. Oh, but
[1:39:31] he's here to make a way. He's here to
[1:39:33] make a way. Brother Barham said while
[1:39:35] they had Samson B. He said there was a
[1:39:38] new shock grow. He said, I am praying
[1:39:40] God that he will grow out of here
[1:39:43] somewhere. A new shock that will shake
[1:39:45] the Philistines like they've never been
[1:39:48] shook before. that is more in prayer
[1:39:50] tonight that a new shock will grow upon
[1:39:53] us to save him that will shake the enemy
[1:39:56] like he's never been shook before.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Brother said I believe that God will
[1:40:04] have it. Amen. I believe that God will
[1:40:07] have it. Oh church, let me say tonight
[1:40:10] it is your season. Amen. There is still
[1:40:13] a possibility tonight. If you have
[1:40:16] discerned and you're willing to
[1:40:18] withstand that spirit that is operating
[1:40:21] in the framework of your life, God is
[1:40:24] here saying, "I am ready. I am ready."
[1:40:27] Amen. I am ready to pull you out over
[1:40:29] them. I am ready to change your life. I
[1:40:32] am ready to give you a fresh and new
[1:40:34] experience to renew your walk with me.
[1:40:37] You don't have to be a bench warmer. You
[1:40:40] don't have to be just a church goer. You
[1:40:42] can be a full believing Christian living
[1:40:45] this message.
[1:40:49] This message wasn't given to us to be on
[1:40:52] the tape. The word wasn't given to us to
[1:40:55] be just on the pages of a Bible. It was
[1:40:57] given to us to have feet that can walk.
[1:41:01] It was given to us to have lips that can
[1:41:04] speak.
[1:41:08] As a matter of fact, in this last age,
[1:41:11] you have been called to prophesy again.
[1:41:14] What have you been told to prophesy? The
[1:41:17] word.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; To speak the word.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; To speak the word.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; What was Brrenam doing? He was
[1:41:34] meditating on Mark 11.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah, church. He was
[1:41:39] meditating on Mark 11. He was putting
[1:41:42] the word on his mind. Listen, even
[1:41:45] though he couldn't understand it, he
[1:41:47] couldn't know how it could happen, but
[1:41:49] he said, "I'm just going to meditate
[1:41:50] upon him." What was he doing? It was a
[1:41:53] shock that was growing out. A man of the
[1:41:56] throat pull. Are you with me this
[1:41:58] evening? while he was meditating on that
[1:42:00] word as shock was growing out for the
[1:42:04] manifestation of that turle. How is the
[1:42:07] turle going to manifest in your life? By
[1:42:09] feeding on the word, feeding on the
[1:42:12] word. I don't fully understand the Lord,
[1:42:14] but I'm going to keep fading. I can't
[1:42:16] fully see the Lord, but I'm going to
[1:42:18] keep fading. I'm going to keep fading
[1:42:21] because I know eternal life is here. I
[1:42:24] know the power of God is here.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Do you realize
[1:42:33] that in all the land of that day,
[1:42:37] there was only
[1:42:39] one head
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; that those shock
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; could grow upon.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Among all the people,
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; only one
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; had the promise. That's right.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Only one
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; could defeat the enemy.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Only one was chosen and called.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; There was no other head. There were many
[1:43:05] of them, but no other could those sharks
[1:43:09] grow on.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Let me say this in love this year.
[1:43:13] There's only one group of people.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Just one group of people.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. just one group of people that have
[1:43:21] been called to do the greater works.
[1:43:24] There's only one group of people that
[1:43:26] has been chosen. There's only one group
[1:43:28] of people that has been predestinated
[1:43:30] for a rapture. Are you with me tonight?
[1:43:33] No, I don't know other person but you
[1:43:35] alone.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; You alone.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Listen church, we are at another
[1:43:40] showdown and I'm closing.
[1:43:43] We are at another showdown.
[1:43:47] The lords of the Philistines are
[1:43:51] gathered.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; No days as the word has been going
[1:43:59] forth,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; they've been speaking to you.
[1:44:04] They were speaking to you.
[1:44:07] It's just another service.
[1:44:10] We've heard these things before.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the Lord of the
[1:44:14] Philistines.
[1:44:17] Because you see Satan had come to a
[1:44:19] place where he begin to look at Samson
[1:44:23] and he begin to belittle him
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; because he's like what has he got left?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; His eyes are taken away.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; They shave the the power off. What has
[1:44:35] he got left?
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; And sometimes he looks at you as the
[1:44:40] bride. What has she got left?
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:45] What has she got left?
[1:44:48] She's living in the darkest of age.
[1:44:52] I'm able to get them lukewarm.
[1:44:54] What has she got left?
[1:44:58] And the Lords were all gathered and they
[1:45:00] were having the party.
[1:45:04] We got Samson.
[1:45:06] We got Samson.
[1:45:08] And he's been he's been he's been
[1:45:09] talking to you. But I got you.
[1:45:12] before I got you.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; You've been services before, but the
[1:45:18] preacher spoke about overcoming and you
[1:45:20] went back home. Did you not fall again?
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; I got you.
[1:45:30] You've tried to fix your home. When you
[1:45:32] went back, what's happened? I got you.
[1:45:37] The Lord of the Philistines have got it.
[1:45:41] But I'm looking for Samson tonight.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for Samson tonight.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for someone that has come to
[1:45:51] a place that has recognized the Lord,
[1:45:54] the sense of a light in my life that I
[1:45:56] wasn't supposed to be there.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I am willing to die with my
[1:46:03] enemy.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; I'm willing to die with my enemy.
[1:46:10] I'm looking for Samsons tonight.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they're going to say, "You
[1:46:14] know what? Lord,
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; just take me to the pillars."
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Satan tend to think there's nothing left
[1:46:22] in you
[1:46:24] because he's got you in a cycle.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; He's got you grinding and he thinks
[1:46:29] there's nothing left.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; But let's go to the pillars.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; let's go to the pillars.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:46:39] Let's go to the pillars
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; because there is a once more.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; There is still a possibility.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; There is still a possibility tonight.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; The promise has not failed.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; When he called you invincible, he did
[1:46:57] not make a mistake.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; When he said that you can do the great
[1:47:00] works, he did not make a mistake.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; When he called you to prophesy again, he
[1:47:05] did not make a mistake. When he chose
[1:47:07] you, when you were fallen, he did not
[1:47:09] make a mistake. When he felt like a man,
[1:47:12] the world had taken you over, but he
[1:47:14] pulled you out of the womb. He did not
[1:47:15] make a mistake. When you were sliding
[1:47:18] into into the pit of a moy clay and he
[1:47:21] reached out his hand and he pulled you
[1:47:23] out of that pit and set you upon a rock.
[1:47:26] He did not make a mistake.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; He did not make a mistake when he p you
[1:47:32] names on the lamb's book of life. He did
[1:47:35] not make a mistake.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; He did not make a mistake when he
[1:47:41] brought this message across your bride.
[1:47:43] He did not make a mistake.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And now you feel surrounded.
[1:47:52] And no day. Amen. Like that day when the
[1:47:55] servant came to Elijah and said,
[1:47:56] "Elijah, we are surrounded Elijah.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; We are surrounded by the enemy."
[1:48:03] But Elijah said, "Open his eyes."
[1:48:06] Hallelujah.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Open his eyes. And if I can recall it in
[1:48:10] this age that we have been told, "Come
[1:48:12] to me and come and get some ice laughs."
[1:48:15] Come and get some ice laughs that will
[1:48:18] open your eyes. That you begin to see
[1:48:20] that there is more with you than there
[1:48:23] is against you.
[1:48:26] You might feel like you are alone, but
[1:48:28] there is more with you than there is
[1:48:30] against you.
[1:48:32] Some God was alone.
[1:48:34] Sam God was alone. But listen, he came
[1:48:38] to the revelation of who he is. But it
[1:48:41] wasn't a mistake that he was born an
[1:48:44] Israelite.
[1:48:47] All he needed was just an ox code in his
[1:48:49] hands. That's all he needed. That's all
[1:48:53] he needed.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; And you know what he be to do? Listen.
[1:48:59] And with that us gold, he couldn't have
[1:49:01] just stand there and slay all the
[1:49:04] Philistines.
[1:49:06] But one by one,
[1:49:09] little by little,
[1:49:11] one by one, the demon of loss came and
[1:49:14] it kicked him off. The demon of
[1:49:16] depression came and it kicked him off.
[1:49:19] There was more with him, but there was
[1:49:21] against him. When it came to the
[1:49:23] revelation of who he is, I'm looking for
[1:49:26] Samsons tonight. I'm looking for David
[1:49:29] tonight that can say I don't care what
[1:49:32] the Goliath is before me.
[1:49:37] I'm looking for David that will take the
[1:49:39] stone. Is it the scripture that says he
[1:49:43] that set us free has made us free
[1:49:45] indeed. That is enough of a stone to
[1:49:49] tear down the enemy.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:56] It's time to go to the pillars.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; It's time to go to the pillars.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; It is your season.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; It is your hour.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; It's time to say, "Satan, give it back."
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; You've robbed me for too long.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; But my family is mine. My joy is mine.
[1:50:21] My peace is mine. My freedom is mine. My
[1:50:25] children are mine. You have no right
[1:50:27] over them. God gave them to me.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; It's time to go to the pill church
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; because there's still a possibility.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; May the musicians come tonight
[1:50:47] restoring
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; a shaven experience.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Restoring a saving experience.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; What has he taken away?
[1:51:03] What has he robbed you of?
[1:51:06] It can be restored.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; It can be restored.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; It's taken away your experience. And the
[1:51:15] reality of God in your life
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; can be restored.
[1:51:19] You say, "I want to know God more, and
[1:51:21] I'm happy where he's brought me, but I
[1:51:23] want a deeper walk."
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; He's here to give it to you.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I've been banging, and
[1:51:30] I've been in a cycle, and I've been
[1:51:32] crying, and I've put on the smile, and
[1:51:35] because I can say the words, I can dress
[1:51:38] the dress, and I can do all that I need
[1:51:40] to do to show everybody that I am a
[1:51:43] Christian.
[1:51:45] But deep within my heart, there is a
[1:51:47] hole. There is an emptiness.
[1:51:51] And I've kept running, Lord.
[1:51:54] I've kept running, Lord.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; But I know that you've been running
[1:51:57] after me.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; You've been running after me.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; You've been running after me, calling me
[1:52:03] back home.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; But it's time to turn and say, "Lord,
[1:52:09] here I am.
[1:52:11] Lord, here I am." It might have been a
[1:52:14] prodal that have walked away for so
[1:52:16] long.
[1:52:18] The father has got his arms open.
[1:52:20] The father has got his arms open
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; to receive you.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:52:27] There is still the possibility.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "I need the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:32] It's yours.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; It's yours."
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; We need a refill of it. It is yours.
[1:52:42] He's here to restore.
[1:52:44] He's here to give you back
[1:52:47] everything that the enemy has taken
[1:52:48] away. Whatever he's shaven,
[1:52:54] the word has come to restore every shock
[1:52:57] that has been shaven off
[1:53:01] and put you back in your rightful
[1:53:03] position.
[1:53:06] Hallelujah.
[1:53:07] stand on our feet tonight.
[1:53:14] Hallelujah.
[1:53:24] Oh yes, Lord. More.
[1:53:27] Can you sing that for us?
[1:53:31] Oh, you know, Chris.
[1:53:38] Is that your desire tonight?
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:46] Cuz you
[1:53:49] me.
[1:53:58] You need to be broken tonight.
[1:54:03] Maybe it's time to be broken.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; You've tried to do it yourself, but it's
[1:54:08] time to say, "Lord, break me
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; of my love.
[1:54:18] Oh,
[1:54:21] let me be you,
[1:54:26] Lord.
[1:54:30] you.
[1:54:32] Oh, sing it once more time to Oh,
[1:54:37] consume.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Go to the pillars tonight.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, once more.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Once more, Lord.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Once more, Lord.
[1:54:59] Make me whole like you.
[1:55:04] Oh,
[1:55:06] break.
[1:55:09] Break me Lord.
[1:55:13] Unlast the broken
[1:55:17] pieces
[1:55:20] of my life.
[1:55:27] Let me be you, oh Lord. By you, Lord,
[1:55:35] by you.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; There is a possibility tonight in
[1:55:40] church.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe you find yourself like Jacob and
[1:55:46] come to a place where you
[1:55:50] feel like you've been wrestling and
[1:55:51] wrestling.
[1:55:54] Maybe you need a name change.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe you need a name change.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe you need a name change.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; You need to walk different from the way
[1:56:04] you've been walking up until now.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Jacob didn't only get a name change,
[1:56:11] but he walked different.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Everybody knew Jacob is different.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; He's not walking the same way he walks.
[1:56:21] One time there were people that came out
[1:56:22] of a room and the testimony that was
[1:56:25] said of them was that these people
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; have been with Jesus.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Can that be our testimony tonight?
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Now we can walk out of this building and
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; and the people can look at us and say
[1:56:40] these people
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; have been with Jesus.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. The same people that you see
[1:56:45] every day, the same people that you walk
[1:56:48] with and the same people that are your
[1:56:50] colleagues at work your friends at
[1:56:51] school that they can look at you.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; The same believers that you go to church
[1:56:56] with
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; they can look at you and they can say
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; he's been with Jesus.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; My name has changed.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; We ask for the barriers to come. Let's
[1:57:08] sing that again. Consume me Lord.
[1:57:12] Consume
[1:57:14] to
[1:57:16] me
[1:57:21] the fire of your spat.
[1:57:47] Lord
[1:57:50] and bless the broken
[1:57:54] pieces
[1:57:56] of my life.
[1:58:09] Lord,
[1:58:12] by you consume me, Lord.
[1:58:30] Your spirit
[1:58:37] be
[1:58:43] more like you.
[1:58:52] me
[1:58:56] and bless the broken
[1:59:00] pieces
[1:59:03] of my life.
[1:59:10] Let me be used
[1:59:18] might
[1:59:29] be
[1:59:33] in the fire of
[1:59:37] the spirit.

[2:01:13] Hallelujah.

[2:09:56] than enough
[2:10:00] for
[2:10:02] me.
[2:10:07] Jer
[2:10:18] proider
[2:10:26] you
[2:10:28] are more
[2:10:34] for
[2:10:37] me.
[2:10:52] You're my
[2:11:01] By your stripes
[2:11:06] I am
[2:11:09] set
[2:11:11] free.
[2:11:26] You are with
[2:11:30] me.
[2:11:42] Oh,
[2:11:57] heat, heat.
[2:12:06] Let
[2:12:09] you
[2:12:11] are
[2:12:15] letting up
[2:12:18] for
[2:12:20] me.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Potter's hand.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:12:33] Wonderful Savior
[2:12:37] I know for sure.
[2:12:41] All my days
[2:12:44] are held in your hands,
[2:12:48] crafted into
[2:12:52] your perfect.
[2:13:00] You gently call me
[2:13:04] into your presence
[2:13:08] guiding me by
[2:13:12] your holy spirit.
[2:13:17] Teach me dear Lord
[2:13:22] my life
[2:13:25] through
[2:13:27] your
[2:13:29] eyes
[2:13:33] and I'm captured by
[2:13:37] your holy
[2:13:39] God.
[2:13:42] Let me
[2:13:47] your
[2:13:56] Lord
[2:13:57] I pray.
[2:14:11] Oh,
[2:14:23] I
[2:14:24] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:14:36] Take me
[2:14:48] inside
[2:14:50] me.
[2:14:52] I need my love
[2:14:56] to
[2:14:58] the heart.
[2:15:02] Beautiful
[2:15:06] Lord,
[2:15:09] wonderful Savior.
[2:15:13] I know for sure
[2:15:17] that all my days
[2:15:20] are
[2:15:31] Heat. Heat.
[2:15:42] Heat. Heat.
[2:15:52] Heat. Heat.
[2:16:02] Heat.
[2:16:11] Heat.
[2:16:21] Heat.
[2:16:22] Heat.
[2:16:32] Oh,
[2:16:46] heat,
[2:16:54] heat.
[2:16:58] Heat up
[2:17:18] here.
[2:17:37] Heat. Heat.
[2:17:46] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:17:56] Heat.
[2:18:10] Heat.
[2:18:18] Heat.
[2:18:35] Heat.
[2:18:42] Heat.
[2:18:58] Heat.
[2:19:05] Heat.
[2:19:21] Heat.
[2:19:28] Heat.
[2:19:32] Heat.
[2:19:58] Heat. Heat.
[2:20:16] I give my life
[2:20:20] to the father.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Did you hear from your theophony
[2:20:31] tonight?
[2:20:33] Glory.
[2:20:48] You know, I just can't help but think
[2:20:50] about how we can get on that treadmill.
[2:20:53] We can get on that grinding circle with
[2:20:56] our eyes put out, our spiritual eyes put
[2:20:59] out, and go round and round and round
[2:21:01] and listen to that devil tell us that's
[2:21:04] the way it's always been.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; It's your nature. You're never going to
[2:21:08] escape it. It's always a lie of the
[2:21:11] devil.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight we heard from the
[2:21:17] Lord
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; and he told us there is deliverance if
[2:21:21] we want it. Yes.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; But it's like anything in life, you got
[2:21:25] to want it.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; And until we get to the place where
[2:21:29] we're grinding long and hard,
[2:21:33] he'll let us go. And he'll let us go.
[2:21:37] Tonight, I just want to declare liberty
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; because the spirit of the Lord is here
[2:21:44] tonight.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; We're not in bondage. We're not under
[2:21:50] bondage. Tonight when we go home,
[2:21:54] brothers and sisters, when we lay our
[2:21:55] heads down
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; on our pillows, remember these words.
[2:21:59] You're free.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; You're free.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; What happened at Calvary was just a
[2:22:06] manifestation of what he did before the
[2:22:08] foundation of the world when he wrote
[2:22:11] our names in that book. My goodness,
[2:22:14] I'm so thankful for the word that came
[2:22:16] forward tonight because I heard it a
[2:22:18] couple of times that it was for me, but
[2:22:20] I want to say that it was for me, too.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; He was talking to me, too.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that he is he's ever
[2:22:29] present. My goodness.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer.
[2:22:34] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful, Lord
[2:22:36] Jesus, that one more time.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, you came by our way. Thank you.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; We called upon your name, Lord Jesus.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; And you faithfully came one more time.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight I just want to pray
[2:22:52] for each and everyone who came up, Lord,
[2:22:54] and each and everyone who didn't come
[2:22:56] up, Lord. Father, that you would allow
[2:22:58] us one more time, Lord Jesus, to
[2:23:00] recognize that in this life, we can find
[2:23:03] ourselves living in cycles. Lord, I just
[2:23:06] want to pray for each and every one of
[2:23:08] us, Lord, that we would just, oh,
[2:23:10] Father, allow ourselves to go to the
[2:23:12] temple, Lord Jesus, to go to the post,
[2:23:15] Father, and Lord God, just allow
[2:23:17] ourselves to die out with our enemy
[2:23:20] tonight. Father, don't let us, Father,
[2:23:22] go from this building tonight with a
[2:23:24] desire to keep that old man alive.
[2:23:26] Father, that old man will take us to the
[2:23:29] grave. Father, let us die to ourselves
[2:23:31] so that you can live. Father,
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; I pray that you would just bless each
[2:23:35] one, Father, for their willingness to
[2:23:38] come and meet with you tonight, Lord.
[2:23:40] Father, we are blessed. We're so
[2:23:42] thankful for your ministration to us by
[2:23:45] your word, Father. As we heard tonight,
[2:23:47] you could have done many different
[2:23:49] things, but you showed us. You showed us
[2:23:52] in your word the way to defeat Satan is
[2:23:55] by your word.
[2:23:58] Father, help us to not be Lord Jesus in
[2:24:01] the message. Help us, Lord Jesus, to
[2:24:04] recognize that in this day and age that
[2:24:06] we live in, we are the message.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Let us take the book and eat it up,
[2:24:13] Lord.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, we pray that you would
[2:24:16] just be glorified. And Lord, maybe
[2:24:18] another song or two. And Father, as we
[2:24:21] go our separate ways tonight, I pray
[2:24:23] that you would keep your hand upon us,
[2:24:25] Lord. And if it's your will for us to
[2:24:27] gather again in the morning, we'll be
[2:24:29] careful to bring a song of praise, Lord.
[2:24:33] Father, tonight we just want to ask,
[2:24:35] Lord, also that you would just restore
[2:24:37] Brother Max's strength, Father.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would minister to our
[2:24:43] brother, Father, again,
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; for tomorrow morning, Lord Jesus,
[2:24:47] because we'll come and and we'll call
[2:24:49] upon you, Father, and we'll desire to
[2:24:51] hear from you one more time through our
[2:24:53] brother. And we know that you never
[2:24:56] disappoint.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight I just want to ask Lord
[2:25:00] if there's anybody that's watching that
[2:25:02] has a need, Father, that maybe just
[2:25:04] wasn't able to express it, I pray that
[2:25:06] you would just minister to them
[2:25:08] sovereignly tonight, Father.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; We know that you're not bound by time or
[2:25:13] space.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; And Father, thank you for coming by
[2:25:16] here, Lord Jesus, one more time to
[2:25:18] minister to us, Lord. Thank you for
[2:25:21] coming by here one more time to allow us
[2:25:23] to worship you, Lord.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we just ask all these things
[2:25:28] now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Can we sing all in all?
[2:25:37] You are my strength.
[2:25:42] You are my strength. When I am weak, you
[2:25:47] are the treasure that I seek. You are my
[2:25:53] all in all.
[2:26:02] Seeking you as a preious
[2:26:06] jewel,
[2:26:07] I want the Holy Ghost to rule. You are
[2:26:13] my all in all
[2:26:22] Jesus.
[2:26:28] Lamb
[2:26:29] of God,
[2:26:33] worthy
[2:26:36] is your name.
[2:26:44] Jesus,
[2:26:49] lamb
[2:26:50] of God,
[2:26:54] worthy
[2:26:58] your name.
[2:27:06] Making my sin, my cross, my shame.
[2:27:11] Rising again. I bless your name. Lord,
[2:27:17] you are my all in all.
[2:27:27] When I fall down, you pick me up.
[2:27:33] When I am dry, you fill my cup. You are
[2:27:39] my all
[2:27:41] in
[2:27:48] Jesus.
[2:27:59] worthy
[2:28:09] Jesus.
[2:28:15] Lamb of God,
[2:28:21] worthy
[2:28:23] is your
[2:28:26] name.
[2:28:31] Can we sing Psalm 34 as we
[2:28:34] close tonight?
[2:28:42] Amen.
[2:28:45] I sought the Lord
[2:28:49] and he answered me
[2:28:54] and delivered me
[2:28:58] from every fear.
[2:29:02] Those who look on him,
[2:29:06] they are radiant.
[2:29:10] They'll never be ashamed.
[2:29:15] Never be ashamed.
[2:29:19] This poor man cry. Hallelujah. Thank
[2:29:23] you, Lord.
[2:29:28] And he saved me from
[2:29:32] my enies.
[2:29:36] The son of God.
[2:29:40] He surrounds his saint.
[2:29:44] He has delivered.
[2:29:49] He has delivered.
[2:29:54] Magnify
[2:29:56] the Lord
[2:29:58] with me.
[2:30:02] Oh, come on.

[2:32:45] forever.
