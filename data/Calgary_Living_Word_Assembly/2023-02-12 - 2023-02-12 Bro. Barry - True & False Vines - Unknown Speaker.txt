down his hand for me and all of Heaven is just going to be quiet to listen how the redeemed worship those that recognize the only way they're there is because he reached down his hand are you happy this morning my goodness just have one prayer request we wanted to bring before the church the Carpenters have a family friend who is in need of a heart heart surgery he had a problem I guess there was a surgery that went wrong and uh and he needs he needs a touch from the Lord so we just want to Remember The Carpenter's family friend this morning if you have a need maybe just make it known unto him with an uplift hand as we go to him gracious Heavenly Father this morning we thank you for your goodness to us we thank you Lord Jesus that you reach down your hand father we can say it for everyone else but it needs to be for me Father we thank you for your goodness to us Lord that you would consider us Lord Jesus worthy to be able to hear your word father we just want to remember each and every hand that was lifted unto you this morning Father my hand is well Lord we all have needs in our lives and father we pray that you would just sovereignly meet the needs once again father we pray that you would just meet the friend of the Carpenters Lord I believe his name is Art Lord who who is in need of a heart surgery Lord Jesus and we don't know the circumstances we don't know what exactly needs to happen but we know you do father and we just want to bring that need before your throne this morning Lord we just ask that you would be glorified Lord in all that's said and done as we go forwards in this service this morning Lord as our brothers already prayed we thank you for being with those who are traveling Lord that you would bring them back home safely at the appointed time father Lord we just love you and we thank you we ask all of these things in the name above every name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians you have your Bibles this morning I'd like to read from John chapter 15. and then I'd like to turn over to John chapter 18. John chapter 15. it's interesting we can sing that song that we just sang by Revelation recognizing that we were lost and undone without God or his son but we know those aren't two separate persons and we know there isn't a third person involved it's one God one God this morning we want to talk about the True Vine once again John chapter 15 verse 1 I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you turn over to John chapter 18. actually 17 sorry my Bible is set up oh my John chapter 17 verse 15. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the world can you imagine that Jesus saying that Jesus declaring that they're not of the world just like I'm not of the world the same way wow verse 17 sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you for your truth Lord we thank you that you are the True Vine and Lord Jesus every branch that bringeth forth fruit you purchase it and Lord this morning we just pray that you would Purge the branch once again father Lord that you would speak to us and through US father that you would help me to get out of the way our brothers already prayed it and I just want to surrender unto you as well father we just ask that you would have the preeminence that you desire Lord that the speaker and the hearer come together to be in one mind and one Accord father let there not be any resistance let there not be any any filters Lord Jesus just have the preeminence that you desire Lord let your will be done today we pray father we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen bless you this morning you may be seated today just a couple of announcements we'd certainly like to just have a special appreciation and welcome brother Tony ojerbesa who is with us his brother John's dad God bless you brother Tony the uh the brothers did a good job protecting him he didn't come in until I guess nine o'clock last evening I didn't know that he was coming so um otherwise we probably would have had him take the service today but he's traveling to Edmonton and uh he's going to go and spend some time with brother Ed and the church there and then he's going to go over with brother Jerry and take a service there I believe but I think he has a little bit of time for us at the end of the week where maybe he'll take the service on Sunday we'll just see we certainly don't want to put any pressure on or get in the way but uh you know there's an opportunity for the Lord to use our brother and just Express what's on his heart it's always wonderful to hear how the Lord is speaking to us and through Us and how it's the same spirit it's not another spirit it's the same spirit and whether it's on one continent or another it's always the same Spirit when it's the spirit of Truth so God bless you brother Tony welcome trust you feel right at home we just have a few announcements about the calendar coming up we have brother Gilbert taking the service on Wednesday we have a deacons meeting on the 16th we have the youth meeting on the 17th and I believe that we're going to be hosting that it's going to be at our place on the 17th which will be fun we certainly enjoy the the youth um we have a trustees meeting coming up and I do believe I misannounced it last Sunday forgive me for that I believe I said it was for the 13th and originally I had done that but we have moved it it is to the 20 uh third is the trustees meeting and uh we have a gym night we'll text you with the information with the details I believe it's at Central Memorial High it's on the 24th and I do apologize it's a little bit later but we have done them in the past where they're kind of earlier and it makes it difficult for people to actually get there on time and we only get a scheduled hour in the building so if you come half an hour late then there's only a half an hour left to play so we just tried to do it a little bit later it was my fault sister Shelley gave me the opportunity to choose the time and I just went a little bit later so that we could take the time and hopefully everybody get there that wants to on time and then have the time to to rip it up and and have fun so the 24th will text you with the details and the 28th we have the annual men's meeting that will be seven o'clock in the church here and uh I trust that is all right just have a couple of housekeeping items we wanted to mention and that first one is if if you're going to have food in the church we would ask that you would refrain from having food in the sanctuary for your children just no food in the sanctuary please we would like to ask that secondly in the room the baby room at the back the the Brothers have had to clean two weeks in a row clean the carpet in the room someone is feeding their child there or something is happening with food in there I don't know what's happening but if you're going to have food please clean up after you have food we would trust that you would ask that you would take it downstairs if you're going to eat and if you are downstairs please just clean up don't leave a mess if your children have food if they have crackers if they have any food parents it's your responsibility to make sure that you're watching that child that you're you're looking after them and if there is a mess just please clean it up or if there is a mess that you can't clean up just please let someone know and I'm sure that we would have uh one of the deacons gladly help clean it up maybe get a vacuum or whatever we need to do so please um if if you're having food with your children we know that they need snacks and and that's the way it is it's the life that we live in please just monitor your children and if there's a mess we certainly want to clean it up as soon as possible so thank you for that um tithes tithing we will have tax receipts available I believe they're coming up the end of next week I think is what we talked about is that right um so we will have tax receipts emailed out to everyone by the end of next week and if you're looking for a tax receipt please ensure that your email address is in the church directory if it's not in the church directory it's impossible for us to email it so um if you do want to actually have a tax receipt for tithes that you've given um like I said just please reach out and make sure that your email address is on the church directory if it's on the church directory you will not be getting a tax receipt via email and if you want one perhaps you can ask for it at that point uh one of the things we did want to point out as well if you could bring up the picture brother we have the envelopes for tithing and uh if if you want to see a tax receipt you have to use the envelope if you do not use an envelope they have no way of telling who actually donated the funds we wind up with a bunch of loose cash that has to go into the account but there's no way of accounting whose cash it came from who it came from so if you would like a tax receipt please ensure you use the envelope and you put your name in it if if you don't do that we don't know who gave the money also on the top right there there's the opportunity to Mark whether it's a tithe an offering or missions every one of those is uh scriptural we we rely on them it's part of the body so please just make sure you indicate which one of those you would like to allocate the money for as well so if you have any questions please just reach out to us after service or even during the week we'll be happy to answer them for you um we just want to make sure that we get the advantage every Advantage we can and if you're donating there's no reason why you shouldn't get a tax receipt for the money that you donate um so like I said if you have any questions please just reach out after service or later in the week and we'll certainly try and answer them for you we have uh we have just a tremendous opportunity one more time to Feast on the word today are you happy this morning today I just want to carry on our thought talking about the True Vine and I can't get away from the thought about Revelation so some of this might be a little bit of a repeat and I apologize if it is I'm going to try and go a little faster today to get maybe a little further but it's good to just sort of go back and then push forwards go back and and remind and stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance and then go forwards I'm going to start talking about Revelation this morning our Christian walk is solely dependent on Revelation the ability for us to hear the word for our day is all about Revelation if we don't have Revelation in our lives then we miss completely what's going on uh welcome brother Gabriel by the way and your family certainly a pleasure to see you here today what is revelation brother Brown talks about it in the in the church age book he says this book is usually termed the revelation of Saint John speaking about the Book of Revelations it's usually termed the revelation of Saint John but that is incorrect it is the revelation of Jesus Christ given to John for Christians of all ages it's the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus himself through personally appearing to a scribe it's the last book of the Bible yet it tells excuse me the beginning and end of the dispensations of the Gospel the dispensations of the Gospel is something I just want to maybe put in there as a little marker as we go forwards just to think about we talked about it in the past but I don't know if I really did it justice so we'll try and push forwards think about the dispensations of the Gospel brother Bradham goes on to say now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of Statuary exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it is the revelation of his Future Works in the oncoming seven Church ages I think this is beautiful to talk about because here we are in 2023 talking about the future work and the oncoming Church ages and here we are we know that we are just blending past the laodicean church age we know we talked about this thoroughly that we are all the way into the bride age now some people are still stuck in laodicea and we're not here to put anybody in or put anybody out or say say one's up or one's down one's in or one's out I I don't think that's our position to do that our position is to discern the spirits and pray for one another and love one another not put someone in or out but here we are recognizing this by Revelation that there is a future work in a future Church age for something to be happening Brother Brown goes on to say the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be over emphasized I think that that that that that paragraph right there we could just preach a whole sermon on that the importance of Revelation by the spirit not by a minister not by a book not by a theologian not even by a tape we could say a tape we could say a book but it's got to be the spirit of God that comes by and quickens that word if he doesn't come by and energize that word then it's only reading and learning it's only chapter and verse but we have got to have the quickening spirit of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to be able to understand the Future Works in the oncoming Church ages the importance of Revelation by the spirit to the True Believer can never be over emphasized I think we could just keep talking about it over and over and over because brother Branham said so amen I just love that Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation on you and I apologize if this is Elementary for those people who understand the message of the hour people maybe who are veterans of the word who have been around the seven Church age book for years and years but this is fresh Manna From Heaven I believe this is really the Keystone Revelation for the believer if we don't have Revelation then we don't understand it what does it mean that God sent a prophet how many people can say God sent a prophet Amen to that we believe God said a prophet we know all about it we know where he came from we know where he he passed away we know all the events in between and that's fantastic we can know all the history some people are even putting together memorabilia of the Prophet but what good is any of that without revelation why did that Prophet come brothers and sisters it wasn't so that we could get memorabilia so that we could put together books and tapes it was so that we could preach the gospel brother Branham said it's not about going and printing materials he said it's not about going and creating schools and hospitals it's about preaching the gospel that's what the disciples were commissioned to do preach the gospel when we preached the gospel then the dynamic power of the revelation of who Jesus Christ truly is comes into the heart of the believer then we can recognize this word for our day we're given the opportunity to recognize Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ and that's the Crux of it right there the revelation of Jesus Christ when we get that Revelation in our lives we're no longer the same that's where we become a new creature in Christ Jesus but the battle says Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation and you I'm talking about all Revelation it's tremendously important to the church he says do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this question whom do men say that the son of man have and they said some said that thou art John the Baptist some Elias others jeremius or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but who say ye that I am and this is where we're talking about the Revelation that brother branham's talking about here it comes down from being just something that is is ministered to us and we hear it at a high level and we say Revelation and it's a buzzword it's got to go further than that brothers and sisters the message of the hour has got to come down to that place where he can say to you who do you say that I am who who do you say that brother Branham was who do you say what do you say that brother Branham came to the Earth to do was it just to have memorabilia and books and tapes in a geographical location and a and a massive industry it's not about that at all brothers and sisters it's about preaching the gospel about people getting saved and then that person when he's saved he can go to his people and he can get people saved and that person when they get saved they can go to the next people and they can get saved it's not about holding a hand and having a denomination and saying that we're a nice fine group of people look at us let's just stick together and we'll be fine you know what we will be and we'll probably even see signs and wonders if we do that but it's not going to be the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost brother Branham talks about it very clearly you know what there'll be a few people that will just vanish one day it'll be the secret sudden going away of the church and the churches will just go on and you know he said it we I I just think this is wonderful he's he had a question asked to him what will they preach after the Rapture happens brother Branham and he said they'll preach the same thing because the same thing is what they think is right but it's not according to the word that's why I think going back to our original topic here the True Vine I am the True Vine the only way we're going to see that Rapture is to have that True Vine we've got to be grafted into that True Vine but you know we're not even grafted into that True Vine that True Vine we come out of it it's a branch that grows out of that True Vine and as that Branch grows out what happens is he purges that branch and when that branch is purged it brings forth fruit and when that fruit is there he says amen look at that's my son that's my daughter I want to see more fruit on that branch and the more fruit that comes out of it the more he's glorified is what his word says and that's why we're here brothers and sisters is to glorify him isn't it to give him the fruit of our lips to give him the worship in our heart to recognize that he reached down his hand for us we did not reach up our hand for him we didn't one day decide hey I want to hear if God said a prophet I want to hear the message of the hour God came knocking on our door and said hey I know where you are I know you're down in the depths of sin you're in the gutter but hey I have come for you I have Revelation for you who do who do men say that I am they said some say they were John the Baptist some Elias other jeremius other the prophets and he said unto them who who say ye that I am he makes it personal who do you say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it to thee but my Father which is in heaven and I also I say I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock will I build my church I don't really want to go too far with that I just want to Simply say this has anybody ever had Jesus speak that to you you ever hear that in your voice in your ear in your spiritual ear you ever have a situation where something gets revealed to you and maybe it sounds a little bit crazy and you just don't understand it but you take it back to the word of God and you say wow that's actually what Jesus said there or you take it back to the message of the hour and you hear that's exactly what brother Bradham said about that where did that crazy idea come from brothers and sisters call it crazy all you want that's the word of God revealing himself to you personally and when that happens my goodness we have the opportunity to Rejoice if it's ever happened to you one time brothers and sisters I want to tell you this that's the Holy Ghost talking to you that's the Holy Ghost talking to you and you know what the Holy Ghost don't talk to everyone he don't talk to everyone if you have the ability to hear the Holy Ghost once you've got the ability to hear the Holy Ghost twice and if you've heard them once or twice if you've heard them once or twice in your life brothers and sisters I want to say likely you have the Holy Ghost you don't have to worry about praying for the Holy Ghost and hoping for the Holy Ghost and wondering about the Holy Ghost if he speaks to you you've got it you you have the spirit of Christ Living out through you we're going to always contend with this flesh though and Satan's going to come around and say look at you you're a scoundrel and you know according to this flesh we all are right that's not how God sees us because remember in the garden brother Branham said there's only one thing he asked for when he prayed over the disciples and the church and the Bride of Jesus Christ in the garden he prayed for every one of his Believers from the beginning until the ending he prayed for all of them and he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth and here we have a Prophet come in our day that says Revelation is more important to you than you realize and and you know what his will is his will is his word because his word is truth let's start though Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto you and I want to say blessed every one of us every one of you not because we're good people because we're Scoundrels and we recognize that outside of him reaching his hand down and actually putting our names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world outside of that happening we would never be able to hear this word we would never have an ear to hear what the spirits saith unto the church so blessed start you just like he says here let's start though Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it to you but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock will I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so if you've ever had a revelation in your life if you've got a revelation about who the prophet is and why the prophet was sent brothers and sisters the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you cannot Prevail against that Revelation because that's what the the whole entire gospel is built upon our Salvation is built upon the gates of hell not being able to Prevail against us the Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter now that is really carnal how could God build the church Upon A man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it God can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot and it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it's pretty heavy when you really listen to this it was the Revelation it was the Revelation he says read it the way it's written Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and Upon This Rock Revelation I will build my church the church is built on Revelation the thus saith the Lord how important it is to recognize the Revelation Brothers and Sisters of the True Vine revelation of the spirit of Truth the Revelation that he Sanctified them through his word through his truth he did it all the only thing that we did was one day recognized that he did it all and when that happened brothers and sisters it changes everything in our lives my goodness I just can't help but think about how how Jesus Christ is all that God was it's a stunning thought to think that there's people that want to try even in and around the ranks of the message of the hour try and and cut Jesus up cut God up and and try and compartmentalize the the differences and say that the the godhead is some sort of technical difficulty that unless you see it my way or the way that my teacher has given it then then you just don't see it at all that's not it he is not he has not come to be the author of confusion is he his word says that I'm not the author of confusion when we start to get confused and something's taken us astray brothers and sisters because he has hid himself in Simplicity and revealed himself in the same and and it's not as complicated as some would try and make it but this this doctrine of splitting him up and making him something other than what what brother Bradham said he was is is amazing but all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into his church is what brother Bradham said isn't that wonderful wouldn't you think he would say all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the Holy Ghost wouldn't you think that's what he would say but we know that would automatically turn into the the three-sided stick that people already wield and try and Club the bride or the female the feminine the church but you know it's not like that at all he's one all that God was he poured unto Christ and all that Christ was the prophet said he poured into his church and here we are this morning recognizing that we're not just the church he didn't pour it just into the church nominal he poured it into the bride the Bride of Jesus Christ but you know what brothers and sisters if we're not careful we're going to miss what's actually happening what's really happening Brother Bradham says in the message of rapture it would be astounding for me to explain to you what's actually taking place I want to say this let us rejoice and be very glad for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride hath made herself ready and that's what we're doing every single time we get together in service like this is getting ourselves ready recognizing that his word is what's going to address us to get over there we're putting on the wedding garment right now we're in the midst of the wedding this is the marriage of the Lamb don't look around for something great some great Fantastics brother Bradham says don't look for great signs and wonders one day will actually achieve something the only thing that we're going to achieve is the ability to receive the Holy Ghost In Our Lives because when we get that token in our lives we can hold that token over our prayers here today we can hold that token over our families here today we can hold that token over our churches here today but without the token brothers and sisters we're just another denomination we don't want to take the token and make it something that's tangible and say that I can say the token is this and and explain it perfectly who can explain God because that's what the token is the token is the Holy Ghost we know that back in in the days of the Exodus the children of Israel they were told there will be a token I'll give you a token and it will be to take that blood from the lamb take a lamb and and slay it and apply it above the door and on the link on the doorpost and on the lintel and and when that death angel passes over the land I'll pass over you and we know that was the start of the Passover but that is such an incredible thought because how were those people instructed to apply that blood God never voiced from Heaven apply the blood take the lamb and kill the lamb what he did was he spoke to his prophet according to the way children of Israel said don't speak to us no no no no no we'll die if you speak to us but if you just would talk to a man and he hasn't changed this program today he still speaks through a man but all that God poured into all that God was he poured unto Christ I'll just read the quote again of the marriage of the Lamb he says you can be an artificial professed Christian but you can't be a Christian until Christ injects himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost In You then you're connected with him and you're no longer Twain You're one and we know that's what Paul talked about in Ephesians chapter 5. this is a great mystery speaking about a husband and a wife it's a great mystery but this mystery that I'm talking about isn't about a husband and a wife necessarily on Earth not not not the sensual husband and wife on Earth no no not the way they fell in the Garden of Eden not about that at all we're talking about the mystery Christ The Mystery of God revealed that's what we're talking about that's what he's talking about here he says then you're connected with him and you're no longer Twain you are one Christ promised to be in US as the father was in Christ you know if we could we could read this in in John chapter 17 and and maybe maybe I will a little bit later maybe we can together he says you're no longer Twain You're one Christ promised to be in us as the father was in us I and my father are one you and I are one see Christ in us all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church to continue the work of the Gospel then we become not by artificial name but by reality of the Holy Spirit of Life connecting us into Christ then through the power of his resurrection we're raised from the dead things of this world and set it seated with him in Heavenly places not everyone goes through an experience where you're raised from the dead things of this world I understand that but brothers and sisters if you're not out party ended up like the rest of the world and and you have something in you that constrains you to come to church on a Sunday something constrains you to want to pray to speak to the Lord Jesus Christ yourself individually something that constrains you to want to read his Bible read his word there's something in you brothers and sisters that's the Holy Ghost I would say you too are no longer to your one your Twain his spirit is living out inside of you all that God was he's poured into the church all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he's poured into the church now remember we talked about this in the first seal 1963 brother Brown I'm preaching the seals first seal right at the beginning when the angel of the Lord came and met him in the room brother Bradham said I would have preached it wrong I would have said it wrong but the angel of the Lord the angel of the Covenant came and met me in the room and he corrected me so when he was saying these words brothers and sisters I believe with all my heart this wasn't the man speaking this was God bringing out something he wanted his church to know and what he said was I no longer call you church I call you bride and I call you this so that you might understand what's happening he says the twain become one you're no longer two you're going to be one as soon as all these seals are unraveled unopened once you can actually open rather not unopened once they're opened you're going to be one once you receive this word into you but we know it wasn't for that time I think there was a conversation that happened somewhere along the way where brother Branham asked the question do you understand what's taking place I think it was in the seventh seal and in the seventh seal some of the people said yeah and he said no I don't think you do understand what's going on I could be wrong about that I know he said it somewhere people at the time didn't understand what was happening but here we are 60 years down the road brothers and sisters that Revelation that when we listen to this when we read this when we preach this he opens it further and further to us and we recognize our position he said you know when the bride recognized it when the church recognizes its position that's the exact quote then the Rapture will go and one day that's going to happen and and he says he can discern it as a prophet he said no no no someone's Discerning saying saying something in their heart oh no he's wrong with that he says no it's true it's true when the church recognizes its position and I want to say this it's position if she is bride its position is right beside him as bride but when the twain become one brothers and sisters that's the critical Factor here that's what we're talking about when the two become one when the two become one then when she speaks he speaks it's no longer her it's him and it all is about him I just can't help but think about this that all that God was he poured unto Christ all that Christ was he poured into his church or let's say the bride he poured it himself into the bride and I think even this morning he's pouring himself into the bride every time we Press Play He's pouring himself into the bride every time we open our hearts and start to speak with our lips he's pouring himself into the bride we have so many opportunities for that we talked about this on Wednesday I believe and I just want to say it again but if that's what God would do through Jesus Christ to his bride to his church how are we as husbands to pour ourselves into our bride how ought we to pour ourselves into our families same thing with the wives in their position same thing with the children in their positions and we talked about this I'm just going to say it again we can take this quote many times Look Away to Jesus 1963. brother Brown I'm talking about his wife how she sends his clothes to the cleaners and washed his shirts and have everything wetter and and he says how how she says how can I serve God and in this quote he says she serves God the way she serves me wives the way you serve your husbands is the way you serve God and it's an interesting way to look at things because now today we have a spirit that's raising up even in the message of the hour I'll say it honestly where the wives are actually trying to use serp Authority but you know what happens is the husbands they get out from under the blood they get out from under the word they get on their own little track and what happens when that happens is the wife sees that there's nobody at the wheel spiritually speaking of the of the family and that's when the wife grabs control and you know we want to get back from that as husbands we want to say no you got to be in your position but you know what happens that's not the way to do it the only way we get it back is to get in our position when we get in our position and go to our wife and say forgive me honey I haven't been in my position forgive me Lord I haven't been in my position then what happens spiritually she will fall under that headship she will fall under that rulership but we're not going to get outside of our position and then demand someone get back in theirs there's a word for that healing line brother Bradham says this and I think this is the critical part this is the part that I really want to focus on and I'm going to as we go forwards it's so important brothers and sisters we can point the finger at everyone else and say that you know someone should be doing and and it's not about that it was what are we doing all about us this is this is a narcissistic thing this is all about me it's got to be all about you brothers and sisters don't worry about anybody else just get in your position just get this word in your life and get in your position with this word and that's where you will see the Lord move in your life he says in so much as you have done unto the least of these my little ones you have did it unto me is that right he says listen here's a lovely thing as you're serving one another you're serving God see the love of God is in every Christian heart and be kind one to another forgive one another if you don't see the scriptures just alike well you behave anyhow and and pray for the other person and just love one another you might say brother Barry that's pretty easy blanket statement but you know we're not talking about love affiliate love we're talking about agape love we're talking about the love of Jesus Christ here this is the love we're talking about in in being able to forgive when your enemy spits on you I've seen Christian believers they have a temper like a buzzsaw I'll just say it straight out if someone Stomps on their toes look out man look out and you know brothers and sisters that's the old man it's the old nature that old man's Gotta Die in order for him to live we want to make sure that we're given Christ the room that he wants that he needs that he demands in our lives when we do that he'll live out through us the beautiful part is even though we contend with the old flesh the old man he's very resilient he he doesn't want to lay down and die that's why Paul said I Die daily so long as we're willing to reconcile with this word brothers and sisters his ears are always open to our prayers he's always listening to see if his sons and his daughters are willing to actually humble themselves in the sight of the Lord so that he can lift them up you know we read that quote I think it was last week where brother Bradham said he doesn't even look at you he doesn't even look at your flesh he's not even looking at you and your deeds and all the good things that you do and all the bad things that you do he's not even doing that what he's doing is listening to your voice he wants to hear who you're talking about he wants to hear what's in the heart of the believer because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh we've talked about it in the past you know many times you can get together with Believers and some people just want to talk about sports the whole time you're together some people want to talk about whatever else it is they're into and other people you get together with them and immediately they want to start talking about the word they start talking about the word they start talking about what God's done for them and and what God's doing in their family and what God's doing their job and all these different things and you just start to pour from one cup into the other you know what are the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh brothers and sisters what are we doing with our lives what are we doing with our time you don't have to spend very much time with people to know where they're at it's not about judging people it's about recognizing you know what if we hang out with people who aren't in the word we're going to be dragged down we're not going to be built up but we have the opportunity in that situation to try and encourage them to build them up it's the Dynamics of the Lord the Dynamics of the life in US brother Branham goes on to say here he says just believe anyhow and pray for the other person and you just love one another you'll find there's no greater evidence of a Christian in the world than love I think it's so beautiful because in that in that quote he's not talking about saying you know what I love you so I'm I'm going to spank you now I'm gonna discipline you now according to the word that's not the love he's talking about amen that's not it at all God isn't like that brother Branham said it isn't it wonderful to think about he he used to think that God was mad at him there was a time in my life where I thought the same thing that God was mad at me I had no idea who Jesus who is Jesus this guy Jesus who is he I remember in my life wondering that I could never just never make the connection who is this Jesus I I don't get it and I remember thinking about it you know in school I went to a Christian School for a little while and they taught very clearly the the three circles in the Triangle the father of the son the Holy Ghost and and they're the three persons and and it just made it so confusing this this business of Jesus who is Jesus people talk about Jesus but one day he came and revealed himself to me and he made it crystal clear that Jesus was the manifestation of God because our human finite Minds would never be able to comprehend the glory of the Majesty on his throne in this Dimension we could never do it brothers and sisters the word says that no flesh will ever see him and live all this flesh has to pass away it has to perish but isn't it wonderful to think that he chose us he reached down his hand for me my goodness I think it's wonderful really what we're getting at brothers and sisters this Revelation is going somewhere we're going somewhere with this today we still have half an hour are we okay faith is the Revelation that we're talking about that's the ultimate Revelation faith in the word because what does the word of God says it says without faith it's impossible to please him but when we can have faith in the word of God that he has Sanctified Us by his word which is the truth I am the True Vine I am the I am that sent you down to Egypt Moses to do the one-man takeover the one-man Invasion I am the True Vine that is a revelation and that takes Faith but that faith that we're talking about is not our faith and and this is the trick the Devil comes in and he'll say well you know what sometimes people lose their faith if you've ever had your faith brothers and sisters you'll never lose your faith if you've ever had the holy ghost in your life you'll never lose the holy ghost that that's a denominational teaching that's a trick of the devil if you've had the faith to believe in this word of God you can never have it taken from you the reason people lose their faith though this is said very clearly by the prophet the reason people lose their faith is because they never really got the faith the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints caused them to go up in an upper room afraid and come out bold as all get out saying you know what this is that that the prophet Joel spoke about and we talked about that prophecy circling the earth for many many years but there came a time where God positionally placed his people there there had to be a people to fulfill that prophecy and when they did they stumbled as drunk people they said they must be drunk they're crazy look at them but no it wasn't that it was that they received the word for their day and you know brothers and sisters when this Revelation hits the heart of a Believer you'll stumble as a drug person something will change you to behave in a different way and you know many people in the denominations will say well you got to speak in tongues and and maybe you've got a shiver or shake or maybe you'll get slain in the spirit or all these different manifestations maybe all of that will happen who knows that's God but we're not seeking those things we're seeking the word of God the word of God is the only thing that's going to get us in that Rapture it's the only thing that's going to get us out of the graveyard if we ever find ourselves there because the only thing that's going to save us is the word the truth and the faith in that word in that truth the faith that we're talking about is the end of our faith there comes a point in time as a Believer where we have to have the end of our faith where we just don't understand anymore I just don't get it I can't understand Jesus who is Jesus who is this man Jesus talking about my own testimony and forgive me for sounding this way but it's true it's the way it was but there was a time one time in my life where where I actually saw Jesus for who he was he was actually that manifestation the literal manifestation in flesh God so we could perf we could we could we could perceive God as a human being but when that happens brothers and sisters when that happens then it changes everything it's not three persons there ain't no triangle it's not three persons it's not three personalities it's one God it's one Revelation it's one Jesus because we know that that's the only name that will save us out of the anointed ones at the end time brother Bradham talks about faith being a revelation he says you said it wasn't a rebel it wasn't a revelation he says what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be anybody believe in something today that's not yet but will be faith is a revelation of the will of God his word is his will faith is a revelation that that's all we need we don't have to have a special Ministry we don't have to have someone prophesy over us because you know what brothers and sisters that's already happened Jesus prayed for us and prophesied for us in the garden the only thing that he asked for was our fellowship that's all and it wasn't our flesh it wasn't this flesh it was our theophany and you know what he's got it because he also said in his word that we're already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus it was oh what does he say here sorry faith is something that's revealed to you that's not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God so by revelation and the churches today don't even believe in spiritual Revelation they believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system and and I want to say this brothers and sisters if we're saved today and lost tomorrow if there's that in anybody's heart you unfortunately have been given a revelation of a dogmatic teaching system but by Revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which God testified he was righteous amen I hope you see that see where we are living see the hour we talked about it on Wednesday but I just don't think it gets old recognizing that God he's not unjust he's not an unjust God Cain even though he didn't have the revelation God still came to him and said but if you would just do like your brother and and you know if he would have just received it then that would have changed everything for him wouldn't it have but he had nothing in his heart to mix with that word when it came to him right just like the children of Israel they had no faith in their heart they had nothing in their heart to mix with that word when it came for them but if you have something in your heart that mixes with that word if you have faith in your heart to mix with that word it changes it he goes I was not talking I was talking to a gentleman not long ago a Christian scholar gentleman he said Mr Branham we refuse all revelation can you imagine that we refuse all Revelations and I I think personally I guess excuse me it would be a safe place wouldn't it did this refuse all Revelations because if you've seen people manipulate the word of God you've seen false prophets false anointed ones false christs is what brother Branham says out of the false anointed ones if you've seen people misrepresent the word of God you'd want to refuse Revelation too and we can be clear when people talk about profits it's scary if you don't know about the the word of God and how he speaks to people through prophets if you don't understand that it can be a scary thing to say the word Prophet there's been some terrible terrible example some very very naughty false anointed ones that have come forward over time but you know to refuse all Revelation would just be easy wouldn't it to just say that we have a church and we have a a an idea book and and this is where all of our our our our inspiration comes from we just don't go outside the parameters of this and it would be a safe place but you know there's no room for the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost to move in that church and we want to see the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost move in our life so I can't help but imagine that that's why this this man this Christian scholar would be saying that you know what we just refused all Revelation because there's some quacks in the world and they're going to bring something really weird into the church and it's going to cause people to be lost or go astray and that's true we've seen it but here he is talking to the prophet of God now the seventh angel messenger he said Mr Brown and we refuse all Revelations I said then you have to refuse Jesus Christ for he is the revelation of God God revealed in human flesh unless you see it you're lost and I can say it myself when I realized who Jesus was it changed everything for me amen when I recognize that Jesus was God it changed everything for me I was able to recognize that God came down to die on the cross for my my sins for for my shortcomings for all of my faults and failures that's who Jesus was God's expression his sacrifice I couldn't understand who the sacrificial the sacrificial lamb the blood Jesus all that was just kind of Mumble jumbo to me in my mind until I caught that revelation of who Jesus Christ was but boy oh boy when you recognize that it changes everything brother Adam says accept your belief that I am he you'll die in your sins he is the revelation of God the spirit of God revealed in human form if you can't believe that you're lost if you put them in a third person second person or any other person besides God you're lost except you believe that I am he you shall die in your sins it's a revelation and you have to have faith in order for a revelation to come you have to have faith in God's word that it is the absolute we I remember one time one time I I went in a situation and and and I may have told this Story Once Upon a Time and I I can't remember but I was in a situation where where I was stuck with some guys that were drinking and I was a believer I was in in London England and and and I was out on the town it was a a a wedding stag party and nothing untowards really happened except for they were drinking and and honestly they wanted to go and do untowards things and I said I'm out I'm not doing it but this one guy he he was really upset because I I was the the spoilsport I was the party pooper for the group I didn't want to go and do what they wanted to do and and here I am I'm in a foreign country as a Believer and I'm with a bunch of people who are not Believers and and they want to go out and start doing stuff that's not proper for a Christian even a a man to go and do and and I said no no no I'm not doing that I won't do it I'll just find a way to go home and at that point I had no idea even where home was I was staying with this fella that I was actually standing up to now and it was strange because what happened was I stopped the party I stopped them from going and doing the rest of that and they just carried on in the pubs drinking and and I was just loathing it and I was drinking a Coke or something with them and and maybe it's too much information forgive me but I just want to bring a point with it and the point that I'm bringing is there was one man in the group the rest of them were sort of semi-respectful they never really had any harsh words they were bummed out because it didn't happen and and they kind of just cracked jokes a little bit about me being the spoil sport but this one guy there he wanted to argue he wanted to argue argue argue he wanted to say oh you're one of those guys and clearly he had seen the mistreatment somewhere along the way the misrepresentation of a believer of someone who claimed Christianity and how many people haven't seen that in their lives so I couldn't help but become sympathetic to this man and I knew that he was inebriated but we still he wanted to have this conversation so we we talked about it and we went in circles and talked about it and and God and what what's with this and all this and we talked about it and I won't bore you with it any more than I am already but the end of it was I had to say to him do you believe in the Bible to be the absolute do you believe it to be the word of God that he chose to give to the world to express himself in word form do you believe that and he said no I don't and I said well good we're done then carry on get him another drink you know there's nothing more to talk about at that point if you don't believe that to be the absolute story we can't talk there's no there's no equal ground here but he chose the word of God to be his expression to this world and it's got to be our absolute but when it's our absolute brothers and sisters when we make it our absolute something happens when we read it we know that in the Book of Revelation it says everyone who reads and hears the Prophecies of this book is blessed everyone doesn't matter whether you're a Believer or not but if you can read it and hear it something supernaturally happens that's why we come to church many times there's things that are said that aren't even in the preacher's notes and we don't even understand why why am I going off on this tangent I don't know it's the spirit of God the spirit of truth that's coming around Discerning a need in the heart of a believer but it's one God it's not as not a third person a second person or any other person besides God and and outside of that he says you're lost except you believe that I am here you'll die in your sins you know I just got thinking about this and and how God all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church and and to think about it go back to the very beginning and think about how Adam in his position what that must have been like for him to be in his position now he is created in excuse me in God's Own image here he is in the garden and and and God's expressed him and there he is now he's looking around and it's interesting because God wanted all of the animals to be named and God didn't come and name the animals what did he do he used man he went through man and got man to express his will and man expressed it Adam named every single animal how did he do that how would he have the ability how would he have the knowledge can you think about every single animal every single organism on Earth that got that Adam named how would he do that except the mind of God but Adam here he is in the Garden of Eden and God saw that it was not good for him to be alone so he took a bride out of him right we know the story he he put him to sleep and and he took a rib from his side is what the word says and then he woke him up and suddenly he introduces him to this woman now can you imagine what this woman would be like and really the point that I want to get to with this story is how do you think Adam would have poured himself into his bride can you imagine being a Son of God not not born by flesh but all the knowledge that he had oh the sun's on you a little bit honey just move that sun over a little bit maybe just a couple more clouds over here oh it's a little bit a little bit cool we'll just have a little bit more heat maybe not more sun but just a little bit more heat maybe coming from that direction oh you're hungry honey okay well we'll just get some fruit here just a little bit of fruit right there on that tree I want fruit right there right now just the way that she's thinking about it you know how he would pour himself into his bride can you imagine that I hadn't thought about that until this morning and I just thought my goodness to think about that that's that's the heart's desire of a man and a woman you know we've talked about it in the past too how how when a man and a woman they start to court there's something in the heart of each one of them they just can't get enough of one another but sometimes we can get into our marriages and our marriages somehow the burdens of Life can get us to the place where things can just be complicated and we're like we just take it for granted that we're together but if we can just go back and think about the beginning think about what it was like way back there once upon a time there was some real common ground and and on that Common Ground there was something in the heart that just wanted to be with my bride she she was that one and I knew she was that one and I could not get enough of her and no doubt she would probably say the same but to think about how it must have been for Adam and Eve I can't even really comprehend what that would have been like but just thinking about how he would have expressed himself then we go on and we know that God he had the church called out of Egypt we talked about this in the past but I just want to try and go somewhere with it today hopefully Lord willing that God called Israel out and we know that the called out of bondage was the church brother Bradham said that was being called out in the church lived for hundreds and hundreds of years under the called out name of church they lived there and we know that God he eventually came in Jesus and came to personally pay that debt of sin for all of the called out all those people who had come year after year brother Bradham talks about it how they would come year after year with their sacrifice and no doubt the sacrifices that came the majority of them for the longest time were pure they were true they were holy they brought the best that they had to sacrifice for the Lord and you know what happened was it meant the need for that day and and that was all they left that sacrifice with the Satan desire but after the Revelation came and hit the heart of the Believers who Jesus Christ was they would get that sacrifice in their heart where they would want to dial to themselves because they recognized the sacrifice that he made and they would no longer have the desires he would take those desires away and that is such a major change in the dispensations and that's really what I wanted to talk about here with this now he changed to the dispensations of time the church came out from under bondage and that was a change Jesus came and that was a change he came and he came to sanctify All Mankind we read it in in John 17 verse 14. I've given them Thy Word he could have given them a complete deliverance could have gave them a great sword an army of angels that would have came and just got rid of the occupiers that would have just slayed pilate and and went after the emperor and just got rid of Rome completely could have snapped his fingers and had an earthquake and Rome would have just rattled right down into the ocean but he didn't do that did he they expected that they expected a mighty conqueror to come forward but they weren't recognizing what he actually was supposed to do in their day he says in verse 14 of John 17 I've given them Thy Word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but thou should keep keep them from the evil such a beautiful scripture there he's not going to Deliver us from our trials he's going to take us through our trials he's going to be that Fourth Man in the fire but we're going to have to step into the fire there's no way around that brothers and sisters he's going to express himself he's not going to take us out of the world he's just going to keep us from the evil he says they are not of the world verse 16 even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth so brothers and sisters here we are talking about the called out the church God called out his bride from his side on the cross we know that there's water blood and spirit first John 5 for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are two right they're one there's no room for two in there is there these three are one we can't go outside of that and there are three that bear witness in the Earth Spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one and we talk about the spirit the water and the blood we're talking about us right there Spirit the water and the blood his spirit the water and the blood inside of us they agree in one we agree in one and again hundreds of years later his word is still in full force the prophecy God raises up a prophet in the wilderness of Revelations chapter 13 in the United States of America just at the opening of the seals he says I no longer call you church I call you bride why will I call your bride why am I doing that so that you'll understand so that you'll have a be the ability to comprehend with All Saints what the height and the length and the breadth of it is that you'll be able to be filled with all the fullness of God you you remember that scripture in Ephesians I believe it's in Ephesians let's turn over there for a second I just think it's so important brothers and sisters so important to recognize he didn't want us to just come here and and be ignorant he didn't want us to not understand these things the mystery Christ The Mystery of God revealed verse 16 of Ephesians chapter 3. we can actually read verse 15. of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world verse 16 that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by what by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love we heard the prophet say that didn't he just love one another there's no more powerful force in the universe Than Love you've got to be rooted and grounded in love Verse 18 that you may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God sometimes I feel like maybe we can preach this or or teach this or talk about this in such a way that we're only going to get a partial understanding that we're only going to get a harsh part of of God but the word of God says the fullness of God to dwell in us it's not something that we're we're just going to have a portion of maybe a little bit here and there I think it's beautiful so here we have God raising up a prophet telling us telling a certain group of people so that you'll understand so that you'll be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the length and the breadth and the depth and the height to be able to to understand with with an understanding that passeth all knowledge you're not going to be able to learn your way into this the only way you're going to be able to get there is by that quickening power of the Holy Spirit but when that comes into you brothers and sisters all of it will come into Plain View I just think it's like Revelations 19 verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready isn't that wonderful to think that that's talking about a past tense she already hath made herself ready she isn't going to make herself ready she already half made herself ready just by accepting his word his truth understanding that I am the True Vine and the words that I speak are truth and he came to sanctify us so that we would be able to get this this revelation of who he is not just who he was but who he is and so you know we're talking about there being a change in in the age in the dispensation there was a change in the age from the laodicean age to the bride and brother Branham talks about how there's always an overlapping it's not a hard stop and a hard start between the ages there's always an overlap and you know he says it that we're building a house we're not building a wall they're building a wall for hundreds of years but then there came a time where there had to be someone that could interpret the blueprint and that person that was chosen to interpret the blueprint we never would have been able to interpret the blueprint on his own outside of the quickening power of the Holy Ghost in his life but that man William Miriam Branham was given that ability to interpret that blueprint to say hey guys wait a second we're not building that wall anymore that wall for hundreds of years has been built it's been it reinforced it's all there now we're turning a corner and I no longer call you church but I call you bride and many people will say well that was just a man that was just brother Branham and for some people it will always be that way but for other people they'll say that was God speaking to me it wasn't speaking to anyone else it was speaking to me to say I no longer call you church I call you bride but then there comes a place where we recognize brothers and sisters we go from being the bride we're not just the bride walking up the aisle in the wedding dress we become the wife where we have that intimate relationship with him the husband and when that happens there is a conception and that life that comes forward inside of us is Jesus Christ it is Jesus Christ and I believe Jesus Christ it becomes the revelation of Jesus Christ to this age brother Branham says it too that we are all that all the Jesus that this world is going to see the lives that we live right here right now I just can't help but think I talked about it on Wednesday I believe that how Esther she didn't she didn't intend she didn't she didn't just decide one day she's going to be the queen she was just going about her life doing her business in the story of Esther she she didn't know who she was she was just trying to make the best of it and we know that something happened and someone called her and said no no no no you need to come and why do you need to come so that the king can show you what he likes not so the king can slap you around with a three-sided club and say that I have dominion over you and unless you see it my way you're you're not seeing it at all no no no no no no he didn't bring her in there to to say that we're going to conform you and change you no he brought her in to show the Chamberlain needed to show her God's or his his servants the king's servants needed to show her how she needed to conduct herself and that's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters the Sons and Daughters of God we have been called to be his bride we have been chosen selected to come and stand before the king where it's not even allowed to happen without there being an invitation but you know John he was shown that open door in Revelations chapter 3 there was an open door it's Revelations chapter four that open door he was shown that Open Door told to come up a little higher the same invitation has happened to us brother and says we've been given that opportunity to come in where anyone else could never come but that gives us the ability to recognize our position through faith to recognize it you know the word true I can't believe it's almost over here let's just keep going just trust the Lord you okay still the word true and Strong's is uh G 228 and it just means true just means honest it just means truth but it's interesting because the word true is used many times in in the word and and we know that Jesus said that I am the True Vine and and we know that it's the true word we read it in John 17 those verses it's the same word that's used in in Revelation that that he is faithful he who is faithful and true it's the same word and and I just can't help but think about Isaiah 43. let's turn to Isaiah 43 quickly just talking about true sorry that Pulpit mic is still on Isaiah 43 I I got into this and it's just like brother Branham talked about the the Bears getting into the tent with the honey or the Molasses depending on which one of those you read the most or whatever you compare it to you get into it and it's just it's so rich it's so sweet when you look at this because I just can't help but put myself there let's just start reading with uh verse 6 of Isaiah chapter 43. it's a prophecy Prophet speaking here God speaking through a prophet I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth excuse me every one that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yea I have made him bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears isn't that wonderful to think about there's people that are they're blind but they still have eyes and they're deaf but they have ears bring them forth verse 9 let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth ye are my Witnesses saith the Lord and my servant whom I have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after me talking about the word truth and recognizing there's prophecy about this word truth I can't help but put myself in there and well I know that some would say but brother Barry that's that's talking about the children of Israel and it is but brother Bradham says that every scripture has a compound meaning and revelation everyone and I I just can't help but put myself in there and think that I had ears and I had eyes but I was blind and I was deaf and there's many people in this world that are and many people still are brothers and sisters but that doesn't mean that God won't actually use you to Quicken those ears and those eyes to be able to see the truth because how does birth happen comes through the body how does healing happen it comes through the body it always comes through the body it's not because we do anything special it's because we live our lives and you know I want to say this praise be to God Sister Mary Jeanette we have a man who is going to come to church on Wednesday night he wants to come to church every night but he can't he's in a position where he can but Sister Mary Jeanette witness to another person we got him baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he recognized that he needed to do that according to the word the true word for his day and because of that now he's coming to church he's going to come to church Wednesday night we're going to bring him here Eric McKay pray for Eric McKay he's had a very difficult life but God is not done with him yet he wants to come he had a position where he he had eyes but he was blind he had ears but he was deaf but somewhere along the way God said now this is the time appointed of the father it's time for his eyes to see and it's time for his ears to hear and how did that happen is because God chose to use the body to speak to him that's why I said when we come to Easter brothers and sisters think about the people in this city think about friends and family there could be someone that might be able to hear there might be able to someone that might be able to see this word that they never have anyway it's by truth the truth if we can hear the truth the truth shall make us free first John 2 but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him talking about truth I am the True Vine how how Jesus when he prayed for his disciples over in John 17 I sanctify them through Thy word Thy word is truth it's over in the next chapter isn't it John 18 or 19. it's 18 sorry Pilate gets a chance to have a conversation with Jesus the same one that just Sanctified them pilate entered and said this you can turn over there John 18 verse 33. might as well John 18 verse 33 some people have eyes some people can see some people have eyes and they can't see pilate was here and he didn't have eyes to see he had eyes he could see Jesus standing before him but he couldn't see who he was he couldn't see the truth John 18 33 says then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him Art Thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered him say sayeth thou this of thyself or did others tell tell it thee of me pilate answered am I a Jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered the unto me what has thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then when my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and saith unto them I find no fault at all what is truth he had ears but he couldn't hear he had eyes he couldn't see the truth the word was standing right before him but he did not have that Revelation not everyone had that Revelation very few people even had that Revelation in that day and the same thing today brothers and sisters very few people have the revelation of the truth standing before them isn't it wonderful to think though there are some people there are some people I just can't help but think this is just like the parable of the story I hope we're okay we're still should I keep going or or should we just end it I don't want to keep you over time I know we're past 12. I can we can end I don't know I have lots boy oh boy I just can't help but think of the parable of the sower you know I don't want to hold anybody if you have to go by all means uh just feel free we'll just go and and see what the Lord will do here talking about the parable of the sower in Matthew 13 I'll just go hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when anyone would Hearth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catch us away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the wayside but he that received the seed in the Stony places the same as he that heareth the word and Anon with joy receiveth it he says yet hath he not root in himself but dearth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by He Is offended someone steps on his toes somewhere along the way oh no you said too much you know what I am my father are one oh oh you're going too far we're all just Believers here we're all just Sinners safe by Grace we're all Sinners saved by grace for a purpose and that's to be his very bride the very elected not just be the nominal Christian someone's going to be the nominal Christian there's nothing wrong with that to be an eternal life to be saved on the other side is better than not actually being annihilated there's only one form of annihilation and that's the opposite of eternal life but you know brothers and sisters there is still a calling for the very elected bride of Jesus Christ and that's what we're talking about this morning that's who we're talking to here he says yet have he no root in himself but duress for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by He Is offended whatever's in the seat is going to come forth when that rain falls on it right whatever's inside that seat is just going to come forth we can't help it we cannot stop it all we want to do is preach the word and allow the word to do the separating allow the word of God to come forward and water that seed he also that receive a seed among the Thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that receiveth seed in the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it remember we read there in Ephesians his will is for us to comprehend his word for it not to be a great mystery that we don't understand some some some deep thing that we just don't get we can't really comprehend it and one day maybe we're going to get it he wants us to understand it he wants us to catch the revelation of the message of the hour that he's called out a bride of his own choosing out of Satan's eat and that's what he wants us to get he wants us to understand that brothers and sisters but he that receiveth a seed in the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and some bringeth forth and some and hundredfold and some 60 and some 30. we heard it said brother Toby preached on it there's talents God's given us talents and you know when we take our talents and we say Lord be it unto to to me according to Thy word I want to take this gift that you've given me I never got this gift I never developed this gift you gave it to me and I want to place it before you and I want to put it before you and I want you to anoint it because I want you to get the glory from it well we can take it and do that brothers and sisters he will come and he will Purge that bridge and that Branch will bring forth the fruit that he's talked about here in this scripture it might be a hundredfold it might be 60-fold it might be 30 fold and it might be just just a little bit but it's it's all that he's given us and we want to make sure that we are good that we can give a full accounting for it you know there's a chew in a false Vine we talked about this in the past Brother Brad or Jesus said in in John chapter 15 here 15 1 he said that I am the True Vine out of the anointed ones at the end time these these trees the True Vine and the false Vine you've heard me preach on that since from years ago how they growed up together brought them in individuals and showed that from Cain and Abel the two vines that met in an altar both of them religious both of them anointed both of them Desiring life and worshiping the same God and one was rejected and the other received and the only way that the one was received could have done anything different from his brother it was revealed to him for the Bible said by faith Hebrews the 11th chapter by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which God testified that he was righteous Jesus said the spiritual revelation of who he was who does man say that I the son of manam said Thou Art Thou Art the Christ son of the Living God blessed art thou Simon barjona for my Father in Heaven has revealed this unto you brother Adam says there's the True Vine again that's the one out of anointed ones he goes on to say I said there you are methodists will bring forth methodists every time Baptists will bring forth Baptists every time Catholic will bring forth Catholic every time and I want to say this message Believers will bring forth message Believers every time but the Church of the Living God brothers and sisters now that's a different level now forgive me for saying that but let's not make ourselves clicky and denominational and say that we're message Believers let's say that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we're the ones that have ears to hear and eyes to see and a heart to receive that word that's come forward for us not just try and fit in and blend in otherwise we're going to be no different than these he says the Catholic will bring forth a Catholic every time but the Church of the Living God will produce Christ from The Roots the word every time if it ever puts forth another Vine of its own it will be Jesus Christ it won't be a church member church members will bring forth church members but we want to live a life so so sincere before the world around us that they see Jesus Christ don't we we don't want to live a life where we say I'm a good Christian I go to a message church and everything is just fine because that's what I do brothers and sisters it's good to do that but there has to be the dynamic power of Jesus Christ manifesting in our lives otherwise it's all in vain first John chapter 5 the spirit is truth brothers and sisters not our words not our Behavior the spirit that lives out through us is the truth first John 5 6 this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth we read this before earlier today for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word the Holy Ghost these three are one and there are three that bear witness and Earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one not two just one and you know what we just want to see one we just want to see that one that was Seated on the throne and we don't want to see him in another dimension brothers and sisters even though one day we will because we'll be seated with him in his throne but if we are willing to look at him right now where we're at the Judgment seat of Christ where we're at examine our hearts with all of our hearts Have No Reservations in our lives then we will too be able to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit if we're going to receive the the anointing of the church if we're going to come and be a good member and everything is going to be okay what will happen is we will fall under the anointing of the church everything will look good from the outside we might even be fruitful in our lives God might bless us with a good job and a bank account we we might have many manifestations of real good things in our lives but brother Branham says don't let Financial blessings actually be an indicator of God's blessing in your life because sometimes that can be a curse what we need to do is make sure that we take the word of God and make that our barometer and say am I following the word of God for my day because if I'm following the word of God for my day then I won't be led astray nothing will take me off my path it's only going to be his spirit that bears Witness I apologize if I've come off on message Believers I don't want to do that but I just want to make sure brothers and sisters that we're put in Christ first because that's what the message of the hour is the message of the hour is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and not just in a church body but in our own lives he's got to be living out through us for the world around us to see and if that's not happening something's wrong maybe stand with me this morning I'll call the musicians I'll quit now his word in Matthew Chapter 5 it says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect maybe we'll pick up from here down the road how are we ever going to do that brothers and sisters we'll never do it on our own there's no way that we will ever be perfect on our own the only way that we will be able to do it is through his Spirit living out through us thank you brother Emmanuel it's true I had the conversation on the way to church today and uh and I just forgot I'm sorry Mr livesey's last service with us they'll be traveling to South Africa I believe on Tuesday and uh we pray that you'll just
