about the specials this morning and certainly love the the efforts put forth look forward to the service this evening but just couldn't help but think with that last special the sister sang you know the story where the radam talks about Dwight Moody do you know Grace and the men said Grace who Dwight Moody said to them the grace of God that's exactly what we were singing about this morning that's what we were hearing and brother Branham goes on to talk about that in the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ that there was only one one woman chosen amongst many and that's the grace that we live under brothers and sisters why if you have a need this morning make it known unto him with an uplift hand I know we've already had some needs and just want to continue to uphold sister Tina brother Paul and sister Elaine who would prefer to be here I know but are once again at home because of this illness and I can only assume that the snows are at home with the illness and anyone else who's dealing with it let's just go to him in prayer this morning a gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness to us we thank you for your grace Lord and father we don't just thank you for the grace that you've given to us but Lord we thank you that you have given us the grace but then you have expressed it to us Lord You've explained it to us Lord you've given it to us freely and then and then explained it so that we can understand it Lord Jesus father this morning we pray that your grace would abound in our service father Lord that our hearts would be open and receptive to your words Lord Jesus father that it wouldn't be words of man but it would truly be the words of Our Lord father this morning we know we have many needs in the body and and that's why we have a body so that each part each member of the body can supply to the other parts of the body that which we need father we just ask that you would touch those who were down with an illness father we know this illness has gone through the the group The Body here father so many people have been sick by it and Lord Jesus we thank you for your healing touch in their lives many people have been healed from it and father we trust for the healing in the rest of the body as well Lord Jesus father we just want to rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ it has no part in this body father we pray that you would just allow our brothers and sisters to come back to be in their position father in the body Lord we just want to remember sister Tina father who would much rather be in service than be in the hospital Lord knowing that she is battling between this this thing that's attacking her heart father and and and the desire to have your healing touch in her body Lord and in the meantime the surgeons are are looking after her father we pray that you would just bring a deep seated peace to her soul father just a real rest that she can trust in you father because we know that your hand is in complete control whether it's the doctors or whether it's you father you're in control and We Know It And we thank you for that control Lord we pray that you would just bless our sister raise her up again at the appointed time we ask now father as we go forwards we pray that you would just bless each one who's made an effort to to bring their lick of fire to this service this morning Lord Jesus all those who have come to hear the word all those who have come to participate to play in the musical realm Lord and those who have sang father Lord each one Desiring to to hear from you father we pray that you would bless them abundantly for their efforts Lord father that when we leave here today we would say truly we heard from you Lord Jesus that's why we've gathered father we haven't come to hear from a man oh Father we pray that you would just be glorified in every aspect of this service Lord be with those who are streaming now father wherever they are we pray that you would just flood their living rooms Lord wherever it is they're at maybe their basements maybe their cars father wherever it is Lord make your presence known we ask in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians certainly wonderful to have the musicians the many many talents in the body I I just think it's tremendous we just want to turn to Romans chapter 12 again this week I trust it's okay I believe that I'm just just about over this thing in my own body certainly thankful for the thankful for the illnesses because without them we wouldn't know that he's a Healer we have to see the law of the contrast to fully appreciate it unfortunately in this hybrid condition otherwise we get prideful and we get full of ourselves and we think that everything that happens is because we do it but the Lord shows us that no he he does it all Romans chapter 12 we'll just start with verse one I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service in my Bible the footnote there it says yield your bodies verse 2 says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word we know that it's eternal and we know there's no other Foundation Lord Jesus that we would desire to build our our spiritual health upon Lord we know that any other foundation will be washed away we know that every other foundation will be Tried by fire in this next judgment that's coming to this world lord it's not going to be washed away by a flood and every man's Works will be made manifest Lord Jesus we pray that you would just be glorified now when all that's said and done that you would take this bread of life once again and break it open fresh to us Lord Jesus that it would be nourishing to our spiritual life that when we leave here father we would say that truly you spoke to us while we walked with you along the way we love you father and we thank you Lord and we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a few announcements we want to say farewell to Brother John Gunn one this is his last service with us and we'll be going for lunch after service and if anybody is Desiring to come we certainly wouldn't appreciate your company with us we have reservations made for a few people so we certainly would enjoy your company if you'd like to come um if not maybe just greet him and and wish him well he's been so journeying with us in Calgary for a year now as uh a doctor and I believe it's an emergency room doctor not a student and now he's earned his stripes as it were and he's taken on a job up north I don't think it's in Edmonton is it North of Edmonton brother it's in Edmonton okay so that's wonderful he gets to go back to his home church and and his family that's a tremendous opportunity so greet brother John if you don't get to come for lunch with us this afternoon the brennans are heading back to Georgia they said this is their last service with us as well so be sure to greet them I invited them for lunch but they have plans already so just make sure you shake their hands and say God bless you it certainly is wonderful to see you once again remember we have the passion play next weekend in Jerome Heller it will be uh just a wonderful time of fellowship and uh we have the worship service tonight at 6 p.m if you have a special you'd like to bring by all means come on if you play an instrument you'd like to play uh certainly a wonderful time if you just want to come and sing if you just want to come and and just sit and not do a thing you're welcome to do that and I trust it will be a blessing because the atmosphere that's created is just wonderful so God bless you this morning this this morning I really want to carry on with the thought that we've been talking about transformation and and and the the translation and Transfiguration all of the all of the thoughts about the body change but I I just thought this morning maybe for a little bit we could talk about this in in the way that not not so much as we have been in the past talking about being transformed we know that we need to be transformed and the whole world knows that they need to be transformed whether they consciously recognize it or not that's why there's people trying to change their bodies and and alter things and and have things made differently on the outside but what I want to talk about today many times we can say the the the the the the problem this is the problem but I want to get to potentially what the solution is with this we know the the what but but let's get into the how it's one thing to say that we need to be transformed but how do we get transformed brothers and sisters and this is what I think is so crucial for us especially in our day the word of God says be not conformed to this world don't try and get worldly don't try and dress worldly don't try and listen worldly don't try and watch worldly don't try and be worldly trying to be worldly is contrary to the word of God I forgot to say God bless you Sister Rosie it's a pleasure to have you with us she was in India and she has returned she just got back last night and her desire was to be in service so I said boy if you feel tired we understand [Applause] but you know we don't want to be conformed to this world we don't want to look worldly we don't want to talk worldly even though you know what I'm guilty I like to use worldly words sometimes because it sounds cool but is that according to the word of God I'll say no and I'll accept that correction myself right now we don't want to conform to this world brothers and sisters we've got to live a testimony of Jesus Christ where we're Christ like that's what Christian means but be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed we've we've labored on this be transformed by the renewing of your mind that's what I want to talk about today brothers and sisters by the renewing of our minds our minds we say many times in the world that our eyes are the gateway to the soul brothers and sisters our minds are the gateway to our soul we know that the word of God says as a man thinketh in his heart and we know brother Branham he brings this so clearly I don't think I've ever heard anybody else say it has anybody else ever heard anybody else say it brother Branham says how do you think with your heart isn't a heart just a muscle that pumps it's it's controlled by electricity that comes from the central nervous system that just sends pulses sometimes they get interrupted and you need to actually have a doctor's intervention and they put in a pacemaker and it causes a heart to beat more regular but but how do you think inside your heart don't you think inside your your brain isn't the brain where it happens the word of God says as a man thinketh in his heart out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh how does a heart have anything but blood inside of it it's talking about the Mind brothers and sisters and I don't want to try and put words in it and I don't want to twist the word of God but I just want to bring out sort of what the prophet says in a high level he's talking about our hearts and our our minds getting into the the root of all Humanity right inside the man and and this word renewing I think is such an important word out of Strong's it's G three four two it's an anacanni osis I apologize I'm probably pronouncing it way wrong but I just want to say this it's such a simple thing the the Strong's Concordance says it means to renovate and when I read this as I looked into it I was like oh my I know how to renovate I know how to renovate I know exactly how to renovate and there's some steps that you have to take to be able to renovate brothers and sisters I'm not going to give us a full rundown but I'm just going to do sort of a high level flyover there's some people that I know are attempting to do a renovation there's other people that might want to do one we we want to do one in time there's other people that do it for a living we used to do it for a living but the only way that you can do a real renovation anywhere on a building is to First assess that building you have to determine what there is there for a building and you have to look at it all around inside and out you can't leave a stone unturned sometimes people will be sloppy with it and they will leave Stones unturned they'll leave rooms not looked at they won't look at certain details and you know that's the difference between somebody that has experience and it doesn't have experience I'm really not trying to preach Renovations here but this is what this word means it's important if we're sloppy and we don't actually look at every aspect of our lives inside our minds we might miss a detail and you know what the biggest thing with Renovations is when you miss the detail brothers and sisters anything can be fixed people ask me can we do that can you do that and I always say you can do anything it just comes down to time and money how much money have you got if you leave a detail out if you miss a detail it gets expensive and it costs time and we know in our lives as humans if we let a little bit of sin if we let a little bit of sin in our lives something that's overlooked that's just not dealt with all the way something that's just lingering there in the background and we just sweep it under the rug and say I slept it under the rug and I put it under the blood it's all gone it's dealt with I don't have to worry about it anymore if you didn't do what the word of God says to go to your brother or sister and and do everything you can to try and make the situation right then you haven't dealt with it and if that thing lays there you can have 20 years go by and that thing is still going to be there and the thing is Satan knows it Satan will know that thing is there and he's going to have every right to come and tap dance in your land but when we have that little detail that's Overlook brothers and sisters it's going to cost us 20 years down the road it's so much less expensive to just deal with it when we have the situation at hand that's why when we renovate we want to make sure we renovate properly and that's why brothers and sisters we can just get right to the punch line like I always do you know what there's only one way one truth and one life we can talk about the message of the hour and that's great and God sent a prophet that's great but have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed that God sent a prophet because that's where the rubber meets the road outside of of a new birth experience brothers and sisters we're all just fellowshipping together and you know we're kind of good people and having kind of a good time but what good is it if we don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives there's so many promises in the Bible that are are eligible for us to experience and enjoy but the first step for all of this to renovate properly is to assess it properly and as Believers we want to assess it according to the word of God we don't want to assess it according to what our church says according to what maybe our parents said according to what maybe our Traditions have told us and maybe even our culture has has dictated something about that that's not the way it is at all we want the Bible to be the absolute it has to be the absolute we've got to have an absolute otherwise we're just what are we doing you know the second step in a in a in getting after a renovation we know that the natural types of spiritual so I thought that it would be okay to just go this way a little bit um the second step is is to determine what parts of the of the renovation are going to be infected because you're not building new you're renovating right that's that's kind of what this this renewing is it's renovating we're not building new building new before the foundation of the world has already happened but we know that when we were built new we bypassed our theophanese our perfect condition our perfect bodies and we came into this word world born and sin shaped and iniquity come into this world speaking lies under the curse that Adam and Eve caused the fall here we are in this world and we have got to be transformed we've got to renew our mind that's the only way we're going to be transformed and the only way we're going to be transformed is to renew our mind according to the word of God and it's just beautiful because we had a prophet in our day come and say you know what if you can't take my word for it take God's word for it it's so beautiful for me that brought me so much rest many times when when people would say the word prophet in the past I would be like whoa aren't they the ones that actually take people into a jungle and and get them to starve themselves to death or in the name of Jesus Christ or aren't they the ones that take them into a jungle and actually get them all to drink Kool-Aid because it's the Rapture it's the time to go all of these things have elements to truth to them and the people genuinely want to believe but you know brother Branham he says it very clearly that you can be so sincere but sincerely wrong brothers and sisters and we want to be right and and the only way that we can be right is to be right according to the word of God excuse me because if you have someone who claims to be a prophet and and they're outside of the word of God you can just leave it alone and say no you know it's incorrect it doesn't get any clearer than that but many times when that word Prophet is used it causes a little bit of anxiety but I would say just take it back to the word and see if what that man says is according to the word of God and if it is brothers and sisters you can follow it you can have rest you can know that it's okay but you know the second step in a renovation is to look at what parts are going to be affected and and there's parts that you want to change and there's parts that you don't want to change and and Naturally Speaking that's the way it is in your house we're not like I said we're not talking about building new we're talking about renovating so we're going to take an existing building and we're going to change a part of it and when we're going to renew that part we need to determine how do you get that part to fit the rest of the building because if you're going to renovate it you don't want to have one part look totally different than all the rest of it even though you would like it to be newer I I learned in in in the renovation business that that's one of the most difficult things there is is to actually blend the old with the new and make it look like it was supposed to be that way and a great example of that is on the outside of a building when you do an addition or when you change Windows or you do something really dramatic on the outside of a building you don't want to put a great big building on top of the outside of a building as an addition that's hanging out over the street it will look like a sore thumb you want to make it so that it looks like it's supposed to be there and isn't it interesting that when we get renovated when we get renewed in our minds the world will look at us and say you look like the same person you don't look any different but you won't be the same person because you won't talk the same you won't want to go to the same places you won't want to hang out with the same people you won't want to look at the same things you won't want to listen to the same music something happens on the inside it's not an outward fix but sometimes there's things that get overlooked when when you're going to do a renovation and and those things I I think it's just amazing when you look at this if you have any experience with Renovations one of the things that is so tremendous when you're doing a renovation because you're not changing a whole building remember you're only changing one part of it um is is the parts that aren't going to be fixed you have got to protect them you have to guard them and you have to guard them carefully and many times when we were doing renovations people would say why would you put so much money towards that because the dust from Renovations is nasty and I just can't help but think you know brothers and sisters when we're renovating Our Lives there's things in our lives that if we don't protect the rest of it while we're doing that we can actually get a little bit Dusty on other parts of our lives and and we don't want that and I would just liken the dust to be like sin as we're sweeping out all of that sin in our lives and getting rid of all that garbage it can actually get on the other parts of our life if we're not careful we have to be so careful to guard those areas in our lives but you know I just want to say this when it comes to our lives it's easy to do a comparison and say you know I've renovated and and we can talk about protecting protection budgets and we can talk about renovation budgets and and how you renovate and all the stuff the engineering and everything that would go into that but you know when we're talking about our lives there's nothing in our lives that we really want to be preserving is there when we're going to renew our minds I would say this brothers and sisters when we're renovating Our Lives when we're renewing our minds we're going to do a complete gut and if you're not willing to do a complete gut then you're not going to be completely renewed we have to be willing to subject ourselves entirely to the word of God if we have just a portion that I'm willing to renovate in this body in this Temple I just want to renovate my bathroom that's all I want to do or I just want to renovate the kitchen in my life that's all I want to do God's going to say that's great I'll give you a brand new kitchen I'll give you a brand new bathroom you can have both of those that's no problem but what about the rest of your house brother Brandon preaches that message doors indoor if there's a place that we're reserving that we're keeping back from him he's not going to be able to to deal with us the way we we really want him to we've got to be willing to go to the complete gut Renault and you know many times when people look at that that's expensive that's the most expensive renovation that there is where you take everything out of the building and you just have the walls and maybe you even don't even have the windows in the building maybe you're going to do an addition but you strip absolutely everything out and you just say you know what it's an open budget do everything that you need to do to make this renovation brand new perfect so it looks like a brand new building and you know that's what happens to the human when we do get renovated when we renew our minds according to what the word of God says being not conformed to this world but being transformed by the renewing of your mind why do we do that so that we can prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that we can show that we become a new creature in Christ Jesus but not just in Christ Jesus when we're in church that Christ Jesus is actually inside of us and as we live our lives we demonstrate the life of Christ Jesus to the world around us and it just comes down to this brothers and sisters get saved just get saved we have to realize that it's only by his grace as we heard this morning it's only by his grace that we are saved can you imagine thinking about this we were driving yesterday we drove to Lethbridge and we went to talk to the Saints down there but we were just talking as we were driving and I was looking out at the Foothills and the mountains in the background just couldn't help but talk about how brother Branham he said you know I'm going to be singing that song Here we have the seventh angel messenger he's going to be singing that song Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me throughout the Millennium out somewhere in the Rockies by Bamford Jasper how many people are going to be out there singing that same song my goodness what a tremendous thing it is to recognize Grace for oneself when we can recognize Grace then we understand oh it's not me at all the only thing I have to do is just surrender to it the only thing that I have to do is just say hey it's an open po you're the renovator and you've got the checkbook can you imagine that usually it's the homeowner that has the checkbook not this time brothers and sisters this time it's the Lord Jesus Christ we know Jeffersonville came up with those checkbooks at one time and and said that it was from the bank of heaven and you could just write in whatever your need was and it was a prayer request sheet and and it's just an amazing description of really what it's like brothers and sisters how do we renew our minds how do we do that there's one thing to talk about it it's so good to talk about it's amazing to think that we are already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and very much right now this moment Brothers and Sisters You Are we are and I just want to I just want to say that and pause there for a little bit because we have got to come to that place that we recognize that's where we stand We Stand seated in Heavenly places and what that means is that we're seated with authority because we know that Christ once he died and he went down into hell and took the keys of death and Hell from the devil and told him you are defeated and I told you you were and you were completely duped and now you can only wait until your time comes for the Lake of Fire you're going to wait for that he took those keys and he came up and he we know that he led captivity captive right and Abraham and Sarah they said oh can we just make a little Whistle Stop back in Jerusalem we just want to look at the home we just want to look at the Home Place we've done that recently the place that we moved from we drove past it there's something in the heart of a person that just remembers where they were and and it's nice to just go by once in a while but then he actually took them all up into heaven and what did he do after he conquered death and hell he went and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty and what that is is power brothers and sisters full Authority and power and that is where you are seated today not just in a chair in heaven somewhere with angels all around you you're seated in the throne with him many times we talk about the gates of hell they won't Prevail against the Revelation and you know what's fine and good to talk about the Revelation but let's connect the dots with the Revelation the Revelation isn't that God sent a prophet the Revelation isn't about the Seven Seals it's not about all of the Mysteries brothers and sisters it's about the mystery of Who You Are that one that he chose Grace that one woman amongst many women the church being feminine one woman being called out and many times we can say it hey I'm I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you're going to live this word all of it not going to have to try and create a list of do's and don'ts in our church this is what we do and this is what we don't and everything in between we need to size it up with the deacons and we need to have a little bit of a council meeting and and talk about the way things are no the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to know what her husband likes we were having this conversation too weren't we Brothers Josue the husband he knows what his wife likes and the husband just does it for his wife and the wife she knows what her husband likes and she just does it for him she doesn't have to say don't you know I like this and she doesn't have to say don't you know I like that they just know because they love one another they're a part of one another and they want to serve one another but how do we renew our minds brothers and sisters I just want to say it this way today just in my own little way just take inventory of your mind look at your beliefs I remember brother Ken he said one time take 10 of the most important items in your life and write them down what are the 10 most fundamental beliefs that you have in your life write them out put them on a page and then take them back and line them up with the word of God do they line up with the word of God if they don't line up with the word of God it's not a big deal just get rid of it just push it to the side but if it does line up with the word of God say Amen to it we need to take an inventory of Our Lives that's how we renew our mind and you know Paul said I Die daily I want to say this I believe Paul renewed his mind daily Paul took inventory daily and said did I hurt that person that I spoke to today did the words that came out of my mouth yesterday really cause pain in that person did I did I overstep somewhere did I do something Lord show me help me and as he would pray the Lord would show him and help him same thing for us if we're willing to allow him and that's the key we've got to be willing to allow him to just come and renew my mind come and and take a look on the inside take a walk through my life take a look at my my my my listenings take a look at my viewings take a look at my thoughts take a look at every single aspect of my life and if you're willing to do that Lord I know that you'll be able to help me and unless we're willing to do that brothers and sisters we're just going to remain as church members we're not going to take that next step to get to that place where we really want to be where when we say we know where the Bride of Jesus Christ and Satan hears our voice and trembles because he doesn't believe that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ if he believed that we were the Bride of Jesus Christ he wouldn't come near us because he knows he would get a spanking he knows that he wouldn't be able to touch us but he doesn't believe it for a second just like they didn't he didn't believe that Jesus was the Christ otherwise he wouldn't have put him on the cross that spelled his Doom but just like Jesus came and totally totally duped the devil now you've come and he's chosen you to totally dupe the devil once again as his bride and he doesn't believe it for a second and you know I think it's just incredible for us to be able to gather together this way to be able to talk about the message of the hour and to recognize that we are already seated in Heavenly places all the Mysteries throughout all the ages all those loose ends they're now history I'm not here to try and teach us all the Loose Ends what I want to do is teach us the new birth I want to teach us to renew our minds to make sure that we are transformed the right way from the inside out that when we go out into this world we don't have to show people that we're a new creature created by some pharmacist or some doctor somewhere but we are truly new creatures in Christ Jesus and the people in this world will say what is it about you why do you behave the way that you behave and then we'll have a quick answer for them that it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's the word of God living out through me because I've taken the book according to Revelations 10 8-13 and I've eaten that book that book is now a part of me and it exudes through every single part of of my life in my business in my school in my travel in my home life in my relationships in my church in every single aspect of my life everywhere I go people see Christ Jesus living out through me isn't that what we want brothers and sisters the only way we're going to get there is to take inventory in our lives and look at our beliefs look at our Traditions do they align with the word of God or do they not if they don't it's not a big deal like I said just set them to the side I said throw it away but just maybe set it to the side just just push it off just a little bit nobody wants to cause conflict or or a frustration or anger but you know what we've we've got to believe the word of God that's the only thing that's going to get us out of here I've got the quote but I'm going to jump to it right now you know what brother Branham said we all want to get the token don't we the token of the Holy Ghost in our lives but there's only one way we're going to get that token and that's only by full obedience to the entire word is going to entitle us to the Token anything outside of that brothers and sisters we're going to experience other people who have come according to that instruction because there are people who will get the token and there are blessings for hanging out with people that have the token there are the people that truly have the token they can sing and create an atmosphere the people that truly have a token they can speak the word of God and create an atmosphere we know that the prophet said we have the ability to speak worlds and go and inhabit them but we have no need to do that so why would we we need to make sure that we are actually carrying that token in our lives for ourselves but the only way we're going to do it brothers and sisters is to be renewed in our minds to make sure that this mind lines up with the word of God because we know the word of God said let this mind be in you there was also in Christ Jesus so how could we have any other mind and we know that that's one of the one of them this world today and it happened many many years ago was that the woman was given the ability to vote now that might sound shocking to say it but what happened was now we have critical thinking that's happening in the world and women will say I don't have to listen to the voice of my husband I can be the one who is in control I'm the one to the point where maybe even people won't even take their husband's name when they get married a husband and wife will say no no I don't have to actually take his name I can keep my own name and we see it many times there'll be a hyphenated name or they'll just take the woman's name and we know that the worst one or maybe what happens I shouldn't say the worst one forgive me what happens is people just disregard marriage altogether entirely and just live together but we know that you're actually married and if you want to say that you're not officially on paper then why is it that there is actually a law on the land that says there is a common law law where when you live together you're still responsible financially for one another and physically and in many different ways it's the way it works we can deny it all we want but you know what's the perversion to the original the word of God and that's what I want to get to brothers and sisters when when we have to say I as a woman and and I want to type this spiritually so don't don't don't think I'm coming down on on the sisters in in the congregation because I'm not but what can happen is we can say well I need to be critical about the thinking that I have about what I'm hearing and I need to make a decision for myself based on all of the factors that I see with my own senses to see whether this is actually going to be something that I accept and apply in my own life or not but that's not what Paul is saying here he's saying just be transformed by the renewing of your mind according to the word of God you need to listen to the word of God for your day this was Paul speaking to the church in Rome and they needed to listen to what he had to say you need to stop thinking about the way the Romans have been teaching for centuries and you need to start listening to the way God has actually taken and used me as the prophet for the age to show you that you need to be transformed you need to have a body change but it's only going to happen from the inside out it's not going to happen from the outside in but why renew brothers and sisters we've talked about how kind of the what and the how why I already jumped to it because we want the token in our lives don't you don't you want the token of the Holy Ghost in your life don't you want to know for sure that you've got the holy ghost in your life brother Branham says it's like having a baby How could a woman ever have a baby and not know that she had a baby to me I find that astounding because many times people don't know whether they've got the Holy Ghost for sure and you know what I just want to encourage you if you have the ability to receive the word for your day you've got the holy ghost in your life that's the identification because if you can receive the word for your day if you can receive the word for your day you're going to live the word for your day you're not just gonna say oh I believe God sent a prophet and I believe the message of the hour and I'm a good Christian and then go and live whatever else you do you're going to live your life according to it and when someone brings correction when God uses someone to bring correction we're going to say hold on a second I'm going to recalibrate I'm going to go and get on my knees and say well I don't think I like what they said to me but Lord is that you speaking to me we're going to accept the correction that God brings to us and we know that if we can't accept the correction that God brings to us then we're fatherless children we don't have a father it's a terrible place to be but you know we're not living in an age where we need to sugarcoat this brothers and sisters we need to know that we've got the Holy Ghost because one of these days it's not going to be the same one of these days we're going home I hope we can sing that song tonight it's going home time I I hope so brother Mervin maybe you can help us with that but you know brothers and sisters it's going home time it's not getting comfortable here time as much as there's things in this life that we like and we appreciate and we have to sojourn here and while we're here we we do things while we're here to to pass the time to fellowship with one another and and on and on it goes but we don't love this world we don't love the things of this world we love the word of God and you know what else we love one another and the love for one another shows that we love the word of God but why renew because full obedience brothers and sisters entitles us to the token brother Branham says it but oh brother when that token is once placed in your heart and you know it's the resurrection of Jesus Christ I love this not 2000 years ago it's the resurrection of Jesus Christ in you something is happening there isn't nothing going to turn you you know where you belong I think it's so beautiful sometimes this can be just so common and and it just flows off our our lips I just want to pause here and just dwell on this for a little bit brothers and sisters when when the token is once placed in your heart and you know it's the resurrection of Christ in you something is happening I remember speaking to a brother who was talking to another brother who was a part of another website thing that came out and it stirred a lot of people away from the message of the hour and this one brother came to try and persuade this other brother all about this business and and and and to try and undermine the the validity of God sending a prophet and and you know the one brother he told this guy who was coming to try and persuade him he said you know what you're too late now because I already believe you're not going to persuade me any other way I love how brother Toby said it even if brother Branham were to come back from the grave come back as being a dead man to say that I made a mistake about the message of the hour there's people that are going to say it's too late I've got the token I believe you can't change me that's what brother Branham is talking about here but oh brother when the token is placed in your heart and you know it's the resurrection of Jesus Christ it's not the resurrection of the message of the hour it's not the resurrection of a prophet it's not the resurrection of a prophet's son it's the resurrection of Jesus Christ in you something happens there isn't nothing going to turn you you know where you belong full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the token and nothing else he says blessed is he that does all of his Commandments he might have right to the Tree of Life who wants right to the Tree of Life today I believe every one of us speaking about this token about being transformed but renewing our minds we want to renew our minds to the word of God brothers and sisters it's got to be to the word of God we all have got to get this token that we're talking about we know the token was I believe first mentioned in the Book of Genesis when the children of Israel were slaves in Goshen we've talked about this many times but just for the sake of this moment I'll bring it again the children of Israel are in bondage in Goshen and there's all the plagues Moses was sent and and he told Pharaoh over and over again let my people go and Pharaoh's heart was hardened by God it wasn't just Pharaoh the word of God says I Harden his heart I'll Harden his heart over and over again and anyways the last plague that's brought is the death plague the death angel is going to fly through the land and when that Death Angel flies through the land it's just gonna be whoever doesn't have the token whoever doesn't follow the prophet's word to the letter is going to die the firstborn of that family will be dead and you could imagine even the Believers in that day were checking and rechecking the husbands and the wives the wives were probably saying honey have you done it right are you sure maybe we should just compare what's going on let's just get the plans out that the prophet distributed to everyone and we'll just go and compare it to the house on the outside and make sure the blood is exactly the right height exactly the right place on the lintel and the doorpost everything has to be exactly the right way because if not our oldest son is dead tonight according to the word of the prophet exactly according to the word of the prophet full obedience entitles us to the Token full obedience to the word of God and I love the way brother Branham says this brothers and sisters full obedience to the full word of God we can't just take a part of the word and say well the other parts that I don't like they're for a different age they're for a different culture that was for back in Israel's day brother Branham said it very clearly the word of God means exactly what it says it is not something that we need to try and interpret because he brings the word of God to pass that's how he interprets the word of God in our lives book of Titus says not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost we've talked about the five wise virgins and the five unwise virgins in the past and it's just a wonderful thing to think that you know they were all virgins weren't they Jesus gave that Parable and they're all virgins and they all had lamps they all slumbered and slept and they all had oil five of those virgins had more oil than the other five that's the difference and the five that had more oil they were renewing their oil they were renewing it but there came a point in time where they all slumbered and slept maybe they all went to bed and some of them had the token with them when they went to bed and some of them they just experienced everyone else's token when they went to bed and thought that they had the token we want to know where we stand brothers and sisters this ain't no time to play church this ain't a time to play the message this ain't a time to play we could leave this building and go in a rapture we could see things change very quickly in our lives but you know there is a renewing of the Holy Ghost according to the word and Titus here brothers and sisters and I just want to encourage us get that renewing get that oil make sure that you've got that oil lift up your cup we sing that song Here's my cup Lord I lift it up oh Father just fill it fill my cup until there's no more Lord Jesus I don't want to leave here with my cup partially full and mostly full and a little bit empty I want it running over David said my cup runneth over we need to make sure that our cups are running over with this oil brothers and sisters that's why we Gather in church isn't it that's why we come so that we can get our cups full of this oil and this oil is the Holy Ghost it's a type of the Holy Ghost we need to go out of here knowing that we've got the Holy Ghost because remember the devil Satan he is roaming around as a roaring lion seeing whom he can devour and I guarantee you he's going after those ones who are hanging out with the people that had the token he was going after those ones first because they're the ones that really desire it but they're the ones that don't have it and he knows it we need to be very cautious very careful we need to know exactly where we stand it's only by grace that we're saved through faith in the word of God isn't it it's only by his grace I just love the special this morning it's only by his grace that we're saved through faith and not of yourselves it's a gift of God there's no Apostolic succession because we're born in the message of the hour I got it I'm safe no we all have to have that Upper Room experience we all have to die out to ourselves daily every one of us brothers and sisters I have I I I I don't know it sounds like I'm getting pretty heavy with this and I want to apologize but I I don't want to sound too hard but I know it's time it's time brothers and sisters time is now it's not of works if it was of works then we'd be able to boast wouldn't we and you know sadly I'll say this sadly I'm sure that every one of us can look around the message of the hour today and say we can see people that have lived their lives and said that somehow their Works have actually merited them something in the kingdom of God and that's not true it's entirely false our works do nothing for us according to the word of God it's only by his grace that we're saved brothers and sisters and by his grace alone we sing those songs and I think we just don't want to overlook it we don't want to take it for granted it's his grace that gives us the ability to hear this word of God we're talking about this yesterday it's his grace that gives us the ability to be healed when we're sick it's his grace that gives us the ability to open our eyes in the morning and take a breath of air it's his grace that gives us the ability to have a job to have cognitive thinking to have the ability to walk so many times we can just take for granted his grace oh my I know the word of God says don't frustrate his grace we don't want to frustrate his grace it's not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them my it can become really difficult because some folks would say well then I don't even have a choice how I live my life well you do you do have a choice if you're called in him before the foundation of the world you can take the Hard Road or the easy Road I remember somebody said I don't know who said it but you know when you look at a road a road you see the road we talked about the highway and and there's many lanes on the highway but then there's a way of Holiness you know there's always a ditch and on a road there's always two ditches and you can choose to ride in that ditch or you can choose to ride in that road or you can choose to ride in that way one of those things but if we are truly Sons and Daughters of God we'll go one's going to be a lot more bumpy maybe wet and smelly the other one is going to be in the midst of a bunch of people and confusion and the other one is going to be easy it will be with his yoke which is easy and and his burden will be light but the only way we ever get there is by complete surrender unto the word of God full surrender unto the word of God give me a full gut renovation Lord I'm willing to take you as the Lord Jesus Christ and I want you to just take me and flip me inside out you know brothers and sisters when they do uh open heart surgery we talked about this years ago when I was thinking about this while I was studying we have to be willing to say I'm willing to go for a quadruple bypass surgery Lord take my heart right out of my chest stop my heart and just take it right out of me and create in me a Clean Heart Lord Jesus Take take all my organs outside of me and just examine me set them on the table and just look at me from the inside out because I need to have that kind of a renovation in my life I don't want to have any of the old man in there we know that brother Branham said the old man's got to die every single Speck of the old man's gotta go you know out of the Amplified Bible Romans 12 2 it says do not be conformed to this world this age fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial customs I think that's beautiful isn't it so many times we can just get clothing that's just a little groovy and we can maybe get shoes that are just a little bit like the world they're fashionable and maybe we get close we get whatever we get maybe our houses all these different things we can get in our lives but what are we doing are we fashioning and and conforming to the word of God or are we actually getting closer to the world we need to make sure that our trajectory is correct brothers and sisters do not be conformed to this world this age fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial Customs but be transformed Changed by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideas and its new attitude I thought this was so beautiful because that's exactly what we're talking about with the young people we were we were talking about that it's our attitude our attitude is what changes everything our attitude towards our jobs our attitude excuse me towards our spouses our attitude towards the word of God it will make all the difference in our lives if we've got a bad attitude it doesn't matter we we talked about this when we were when we were fellowshipping with the young people and I'll just say it now it is feel led to we worked for a man who was very wealthy very smart and what he said is I don't really hire for for education I don't really hire for credentials per se though they do they have to right you can't hire an engineer without having the a Pega stamp they have to have the certain requirements to be able to get there but you can have an engineer that's got a real bad attitude or you can have an engineer that's got a really good attitude and as a business owner which one are you going to hire you're going to hire the one with a good attitude you could have all of the credentials but what good is it if you can't get along with people the attitude counts for everything goes on to say I'll just read this here but be transformed change by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideas and its new attitude so that you may prove and I love this this is what it says by yourselves what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect in his sight for you I love the way that this makes it it's about you brothers and sisters so that you may prove for yourselves remember we've talked about Abraham when he went up to to sacrifice his son waited for the for the thing I apologize if this is a repeat I always seem to bring this up but to prove for himself Abraham had to come to the understanding that he knew God as his provider God said now I know Abraham that you love me but he was God he knew that all along Abraham is the one that needed to know that and I think as as we go forwards brothers and sisters we have got to come to that place where we're willing to take all that we know up to the Mountaintop and be willing to sacrifice it for the Lord to say I just want to give it all to you Lord because I don't have anything to bring on my own because I know that you're Jehovah Jireh and you've brought me this far and if you have brought me this far and you haven't chosen to destroy me yet then you'll be obligated to raise me up again after I lay it all down for you you'll be obligated to to fix everything that I need just like Abraham said I know that this is the sun according to the promise so if he wants me to sacrifice him he's obligated to brace him up again because it's through him that all of this seed comes forward but it's so that you may prove for yourselves what is the good acceptable perfect will of God who doesn't want to know what the good acceptable perfect will of God is did I cough in your ears I'm sorry but I just thought about this you know looking at this we want to prove it don't we and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God just wanted to take a quick little look this morning at these words and just I did take a look at them and you know to prove is G 1381 to test literally or figuratively by implication to approve allow discern examine this is the Strong's Concordance of the word proof we have to be able to test it literally or figuratively the only way we're going to do that is by the word of God we need to test this experience that we're talking about by the word of God if what we're hearing if what we believe is according to the word of God then we're able to say Amen to it but we need to allow to discern and examine it and to allow the word to discern and examine us that's what's going to renew our minds I promise brothers and sisters when we go on our knees and Die daily when we spend time in prayer before the Lord and we say Lord what do I need to do to make my life better what can I do to be more pleasing unto you as my husband what can I do I promise he will tell you but many times it can be very difficult answer and I'll speak from experienced brothers and sisters some of the most difficult answers that we could ever imagine in our lives are the answers that he'll give us and we have the choice then to act on that or to say well that's too hard I don't know I can I I don't know how can I do that that's that's so difficult Lord how many people in the Bible must have thought that had those thoughts that is difficult how can that be how can it ever work the way that you want it to work if it's the word of God and it's according to the word promise you brothers and sisters it will work out it will work out exactly but we need to allow it to discern and examine we need to prove what is good and and it's just simple it's G18 and it's good and well it's good and well it's positive we need to prove what is good and acceptable g2101 fully agreeable well pleasing it's acceptable fully agreeable with the word of God and the word of God fully agreeable with our lives could you imagine being that way I I know most of us have probably had times in our lives you we can't live in this world without actually being contaminated with sin it's just impossible isn't it and I said it before years ago but you know he's been he's given us the no stick solution for this world's filth in our lives and it's the oil of the Holy Ghost many times when you're going to cook with something you put a little bit of non-stick something in the in the pan whether it's a little bit of butter a little bit of oil and we've been given the oil the Holy Ghost and that's our no stick solution the sin will come in our lives but it can't stick brothers and sisters because he has already paid the price for every single sin that's ever happened he doesn't look at our lives he looks at the sacrifice for our lives and the sacrifice for our lives is Jesus Christ that one that's already seated that we were talking about that's got to be fully agreeable and well pleasing acceptable what an amazing place to be and I say Lord help me I want to be fully agreeable and I want to be not just myself fully agreeable with everything that you say Lord I want to know that you are fully agreeable with me and my behavior and my reasoning and my thinking and my mind and my heart and my soul I want to know that I am well pleasing unto you as my husband isn't it interesting that we talk about it being the bride and the husband and how the male men are talking about being the bride but yet there's all this other business going on in the world the only reason that's happening brothers and sisters is because we're here in our positions and as long as we're here in our positions unfortunately it's not them squeezing us it's not that that Spirit of the age that's squeezing us I have thought about this so much recently it's the other way around brothers and sisters because if we're saying that it's that Spirit that's squeezing us we're saying that Spirit stronger than he that is in US it's us that's squeezing this age we sang that song I think it was on Wednesday or last Sunday it's this power God's power in his church that's shaking this hour brothers and sisters it's not this hour that's shaking the church don't look for a squeeze to get squeezed out of here we're going to squeeze them and I'm not saying them about people we're talking spiritual we're going to squeeze those spirits and as long as we preach this as long as we're here as long as we have our tokens and we can take it out and hold it over our prayers brothers and sisters you're shaking the powers that are out there in this hour you're shaking the spirits in this world and you know it's going to be this way unfortunately to the very end we are either going to shake those Spirits or those Spirits are going to come and Shake us and the only way we're not going to get shaken is to have his mind inside of us to make sure that we are renewed in our mind and that we can prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God the next word is perfect G 50 46 teleosis complete in various applications of Labor growth mental and moral character completeness of full age man perfect that Strong's Concordance I thought it was just you if I almost had a shout and fit this morning G50 46 teleosis complete in various applications we sing that song complete complete complete in him we are complete in him you know what that song the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelleth in my Lord I just want to sing that song now my goodness doesn't just dwell in our Lord does it second Peter 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ maybe turn there with me I always get a little excited and start reading let's go to Second Peter chapter one just want to encourage us brothers and sisters take inventory let's renew our minds let's make sure we know exactly where we stand because this this world is shaking this world is teetering right on the brink of something major happening and unless we know where we stand unless we know we've got that token we will be soon shaken in our minds second Peter 1 says Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ I love the way that he introduces himself this is the Lord speaking through our brother Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as he as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye may be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and looking at this world boy oh boy if it's the lust of the flesh or the lust of the eyes it doesn't matter is lust right but this is what we want to get to here verse 5 and beside this giving all diligence brothers and sisters not just a little bit not just when we go to church but all of our diligence giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience to patience godliness to Godliness brotherly kindness the brotherly kindness charity the reason I'm saying all of that I'm not going to preach the statue of the perfect man we all know that that's what it is that brother Branham taught very clearly I want to say this for if these things be in you and abound they make you that she you ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you'll know exactly where you stand when you have this the only way you're going to have this though is to get your mind renewed brothers and sisters to recognize that we need to be living in this realm this is the place we need to live in not according to this world verse 9 says but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins I think this is amazing because this isn't talking about a a sinner is it because a sinner doesn't believe he has sins this is someone that was forgiven of his sins this is someone who Once Upon a Time tasted of the Heavenly gift but he that lacketh those things these blind and we know that the word says that their their minds will be blinded we know that that's that's that's the way it is but they can't see far off they've forgotten the the prize at the end they started to look at the right here and right now and the situations and the problems in front of their eyes and they're not living by that Faith sense that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure make sure give diligence for if you do these things you shall never fall I just think it's a beautiful scripture to think brothers and sisters there is a place that we can live where we will never fall and that's when we're renewing our mind where we're actually going on our knees and saying Lord renovate me take me and break me and bless those broken pieces Lord and and I know that you'll bless them they'll be beautiful but it's tough speech I know it to say Break Me Lord I don't want to be broken I don't think any one of us want to be broken but if it's the Lord's will for us to be broken then it's just going to make us better it's going to be his will for our lives and sometimes it's physical sometimes it's mental but we need to do what we need to do you know when you're going to do a renovation you've got to make some mess it gets messy doing a renovation brothers and sisters and you know it gets dusty it's unpleasant it's on on unwelcome but you know that's the way it is brother Bradham says when you have a new birth it's messy if anybody has ever seen a birth happen it's messy you ever see a baby cow or horse come into the world it's messy it's not pretty but that's the way it comes we come by the blood that's the only way we can have a new birth but he that lacketh these things is blind cannot see you far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brother and give diligence to make your calling and elections sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that's what we want to do is just abundantly Minister this Everlasting Kingdom the only way brothers and sisters is by the Holy Ghost in our lives we could go on to talk about how you get the Holy Ghost in our lives and and and pray through and I would say this if anybody has the desire for the Holy Ghost he'll give it to you all you have to do is say Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word if I repent and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of my sins then I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we know in the Bible it says that you know go into all the world and preach the gospel to All Creatures baptizing in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost it says that in the Bible and maybe not exactly like that but it does say in the name of the father of the son the Holy Ghost but that's not the scripture that we live by because we know that we've had a light shine on that to say what is the name of the father and what is the name of the son and what is the name of the Holy Ghost I could have a checkbook we have in this conversation too I could have a checkbook and my checkbook says Barry Johnson that such and such an address and everything is correct on the checkbook and I've got money in the bank and and I can write the check I can make it legible and I can write it out to whoever the receiver is for that check and everything could be perfect but if I wrote father instead of signing Barry on that check the bank would reject it would it not yes if I wrote sun on that check the bank would reject that check they would say something's funny going on here why what what is that who's a son it's supposed to be that signature that we have right here right on the card that they keep in the bank or if I said in in the spirit of Barry they'd be like man this guy's crazy right it would never get cached it's no different for us to receive the Holy Ghost in our lives we've got to be willing to come according to the word of God for our day that was a word of God for a day but we have a word of God for our day and the word of God for our day is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins then we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we can't bake a cake and substitute one thing for another and think that it's going to taste good if we took out sugar and put in salt maybe the cake would bake it would look exactly the same but maybe even smelling it would taste horrible but one little taste of it would just be ridiculous you've got to follow the recipe and it's so amazing because the devil knows that and when you look at it it's shocking and astounding to think that there's so many people out there that are baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost who truly believe the word of God with all their hearts but what happened somewhere along the way through tradition maybe just mistaken teaching their minds were blinded maybe they were never given the ability to see what you see and it doesn't give us license to come down on people like that to look down on them it causes us to sigh and cry for the Abominations that are in the land because remember that man that walked through the city with the ink horn who was told to go and set a mark on the people I think it's in Ezekiel he was told to go and set a mark upon the people that that man with the ink horn and we know it was an angel setting a mark on the people but he wasn't out in the Heathen Nations setting marks on the people was he he was in the land and you know brothers and sisters it's important for us to recognize that there is one in the land right now setting a mark on the people and giving them the token of the Holy Ghost it's the ones that are sighing and crying for the Abominations of the many times we say well if you're going to receive the word of God for your day that's what the prophet said and you can say Amen to the word then you have the Holy Ghost and truly indeed you do because you will never be able to say Amen to the word if you don't have the Holy Ghost you can't even call Jesus Lord unless you have the Holy Ghost is what the word of God says but you know brother Branham he brings it out on another angle and he says only those who are sighing and crying you want to see if you've got the holy ghost in your life are you sighing and crying for the Abominations in the land not in the Heathen land not out there we can look around and say out there but what about right here what about the people who actually did come to church for a while but then they stopped coming for some reason do we know the reason do we know where where they are today do we know what the problem is where are those people are we sighing and crying for those people or or is it just easier that they're gone brothers and sisters we don't ever want to have that attitude we want to have the attitude where we're sighing and crying for the Abominations for our brothers and our sisters that maybe they just can't come for whatever reason and maybe reach out a hand to them and see if they'll come with the Branham talking about this out of the power of transformation I can't seem to get out of it I just I think it's so amazing we're almost out of time here apologize um are we okay brother Branham out of the power and transformation he says hi beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body's a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service he says I thought that was so beautiful for this group this morning what you've done did now and and is a conjunction as I understand I love how someone with a seventh grade education had such a handle on the grammar of the English language he says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God brother Branham says that's what we all want to do is be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now we want to have the mind that was in Christ to be in US that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word I want to say this this morning brothers and sisters when we go to church we hear the word of God and it washes us when we listen to the message of the hour we listen and it washes us it changes us and when we read the word of God it washes us and it changes us it when we go on our knees we're renewing our minds all of that is renewing our minds but there's a conversation that takes place between us and our husband and even though he talks according to his word he'll talk through a preacher he'll talk through the tape to us he'll speak to our brother and our sister we'll hear him dealing with us and you know he'll do it in such a way that only you will know and you can try to explain it to other people and other people will say yeah okay maybe I don't know maybe I don't know sometimes it can sound really crazy when you try to explain how God has been dealing with you sometimes it's just in Little Things brother Branham talked about how nature spoke to him right God will deal with us however we need to be dealt with the way that he created he will speak to us and the key to this brothers and sisters I think that was just burning within my heart that I had to just bring today is that when he speaks do we listen do we hear his voice for ourselves and when we hear his voice for ourselves are we willing to act on it I say Lord help me help me act on your voice when I hear it because you know brothers and sisters I'm not going to try and pretend to be Almighty and and holy and religious because none of us want to be that but I'm no better than anyone I'm I'm probably the cheapest chiefest of Sinners and you know I I look at my life and I think about the times I know the Lord has spoke to me as a Believer and said do this and I haven't done that we don't want to do that we want to follow the word of God every single time he talks to us and if we're willing to do that then we know where we stand then we know that our mind has been renewed and our we can't just have a one-and-done renewing of our minds I'm sorry it doesn't work that way we could say that we've had a one and done renewing with our marriage I got married 16 years ago 17 years ago 20 years ago maybe 50 years ago and I said to my wife that I love her then I told her I love her she knows that I love her but if I don't tell her that I love her on a daily basis on a weekly basis on a monthly day on a regular basis does she know that I love her she's going to think that I don't love her anymore we've been created that way for a purpose he wants to hear us say I love you honey he wants to hear our voice speak to him I just want to encourage us when the devil says Nope you've done that you can't talk to him he won't listen to you tell the Devil he's a liar tell the devil you can't even see me the way that he created me you can't even see me the way he created me Satan I can't see me the way he created me but he can see me the way he created me and he's listening to hear my voice come to him the way that he created me and the only way that he created you is exactly according to his word you can say brother Barry I don't understand anything about this and you don't have to understand anything about this the only thing you got to do is believe it the only thing you got to do is say Lord be it unto me just transform me according to your word transform my mind renew my mind so that I can prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so that you can prove it through me Lord and you know what something will happen if we can have that genuine attitude towards him if we have the right attitude the right mental attitude to any promise of God we'll bring it to pass is what the prophet of God says and and let's just back up for a second and say that's what God Said through the prophet God said that through the prophet so that we could take that and put it in our pocket and say wow man I want to get the right mental attitude how do I get the right mental attitude you say just renew your mind just renew your mind according to his word if you're willing to renew his mind your mind according to his word you're going to have the right mental attitude every single time initially you might not initially you might actually have a problem but the Holy Ghost he's going to come around and say brother you did that wrong you need to go and make that right and if you're truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you're going to turn around and you're going to go and make that right but you're Renewing Your Mind brothers and sisters that's the life of Jesus Christ Living out through us I think it's beautiful the way brother Branham says it I I so much and it's already 12. maybe we'll just pick up next week I don't want to keep us here we have a service tonight brothers and sisters you know this world it teaches us to be strong but we don't want to be strong we want to be weak maybe stand with me as we close this morning brothers and sisters we can't be strong on our own we have no strength we know that Paul he had strength in his own body in his own mind recognizing that he was a part of the message for his day he was the messenger for the age and Satan was allowed to bring him a little bit of buffeting God will allow that in our lives just to Humble us a bit just to get us to that place where we recognize oh yeah I forgot it it truly is you Lord every single bit of it is you and there's nothing that I've got second Corinthians chapter 12 says for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me Paul speaking this Thorn that was given to him in the flesh Satan that Messenger to come and just rattle his cage a bit and he said unto me my grace Not Your Grace not someone else's Grace not your righteousness but my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness Paul the messenger for the age the first church age messenger the pattern that was set for every other age this is what he said most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities power of Christ might rest upon me my goal my objective my desire brothers and sisters is that the power of Christ will rest upon you today and not just today but tomorrow when the Devil Comes Monday morning and and Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning and Thursday and Friday and every day that ends in why that the power of Christ will rest upon you so when Satan comes around and tries to buff at you you can say yep you're only doing it because God's allowed it and it's for his his righteousness to be expressed in my life you're only going to squeeze out what's inside of me and the only thing that's inside of me is the word of God so go for it I'm going to stop I I just trust that the power of Christ will rest upon each one of us as we go forwards brothers and sisters get the token know where you stand just renew your mind according to his word gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you today and we thank you for your goodness to us we thank you for your word Lord because we know that it is sure we know that this whole entire world now is on shifting Sands Lord oh Father there's no sure footing in this world except for your word father we know that there's man already creating dens in the rocks oh Father they're creating bunkers and storing up food provisions and ammunition and all the things that they think they need they're saving seeds Lord so they can potentially pull them out of after a holocaust Lord but we know that all of it is coming to an end all of it is for not nothing will stop the Judgment that is coming upon this world that is happening right now on this world father and Lord I pray with all my heart that this morning each one of us father could just lift our cups unto you and just fill them up Lord Jesus is our desire that you would fill our cups Lord that when we leave this building this morning that we would know exactly where we stand father there would be no question in our hearts Lord Jesus about your grace in our lives whether that when the devil would come around and try and tempt us that we could just know exactly where we stand that we could not look to ourselves and and not look to anything else except for you Lord because you are that perfect sacrifice you are the sacrifice just like the high priest looked at the lamb father we know you as God you only look at the lamb father we just ask that you would be glorified in our lives you would go with us as we go our separate ways father pray that you would just keep your hand upon the brennans as they travel Lord watch over Brother Sam as he flies Lord Jesus be with sister Sharon and brother Shepard Lord while he's away father we just ask that you would just continue to keep your hand upon them Father that they would be a light of this Gospel of your life to the people in Georgia Lord and father we just asked that you would be with Brother John father that you would continue watching over him Lord father that it wouldn't be brother John's hands in the ER oh father but that you would just take his hands and put them on like gloves father and that it would be you tending to the people father that he comes in contact with Father we just asked that you would bless him abundantly father that he would be able to just minister to people the way that you have created him oh Father we just love you and we thank you we just ask now that you would be glorified in a few songs Lord Jesus that we would just renew our minds a little further with some song Lord and as we go our separate ways that our desire would be to come back tonight father to just worship you because you deserve all the praise and all the glory be with those who are traveling Lord whether Joel Sister Crystal Lillian Elias father we pray that you would just give them a nice rest Lord and bring them back safely at the appointed time we ask in Jesus Christ's name we
