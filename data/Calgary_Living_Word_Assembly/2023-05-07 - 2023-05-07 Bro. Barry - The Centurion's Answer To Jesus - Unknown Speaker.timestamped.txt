[1:04:20] can bring them to you father that you
[1:04:22] can be that good father and just show us
[1:04:24] your wonderful way Lord Jesus one more
[1:04:27] time we just want to commit everything
[1:04:29] in this service Lord everything in our
[1:04:31] lives into your hands father help us to
[1:04:33] step aside from this world Lord father
[1:04:36] that we could just blend the dimensions
[1:04:37] this morning we know we've heard it said
[1:04:39] that there's coming a day where this
[1:04:41] this Dimension will slightly speed up
[1:04:43] father and that other dimension will
[1:04:44] slightly slow down lord and there will
[1:04:46] just be a blending of Time and Eternity
[1:04:48] Lord Jesus where we'll hear from our
[1:04:51] theophories Lord that's why we've
[1:04:54] gathered today
[1:04:55] so once again we want to hear from our
[1:04:57] theophories that we would just have that
[1:04:59] reminder that this world that we see
[1:05:01] this is not it this is only the negative
[1:05:04] father but there's something great in
[1:05:06] store for your children and father we
[1:05:08] press towards that Mark for the prize of
[1:05:11] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:05:13] according to your word Lord
[1:05:16] father we love you and we thank you
[1:05:18] today we just ask that you would bless
[1:05:20] our service now in the name of Jesus
[1:05:23] Christ we pray
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:27] Hallelujah God bless you this morning
[1:05:30] musicians
[1:05:33] just wanna
[1:05:35] invite you to Matthew chapter 8 this
[1:05:38] morning
[1:05:39] have your Bibles
[1:05:54] Matthew chapter 8.
[1:05:59] start reading with verse 13.
[1:06:04] actually sorry Matthew 8.
[1:06:07] Matthew chapter 8 verse 5. I apologize
[1:06:19] Matthew chapter 8 verse 5 when Jesus was
[1:06:22] entered into Capernaum that came unto
[1:06:24] him a centurion beseeching him
[1:06:27] and saying Lord my servant lieth at home
[1:06:29] sick of the palsy grievously tormented
[1:06:33] my Bible says paralyzed there
[1:06:36] and Jesus saith unto him I will come and
[1:06:40] heal him
[1:06:41] the Centurion answered and said Lord I
[1:06:44] am not worthy that thou shouldest come
[1:06:45] under my roof
[1:06:47] but speak the word only
[1:06:51] and my servant shall be healed
[1:06:55] for I am a man under Authority
[1:06:57] having soldiers under me
[1:07:00] and I say
[1:07:01] to this man go when he goeth
[1:07:04] and to another
[1:07:06] come and he cometh
[1:07:08] and to my servant do this and he doeth
[1:07:11] it
[1:07:12] and when Jesus heard it
[1:07:14] he marveled
[1:07:15] and said unto them that followed verily
[1:07:17] I say unto you I have not found so great
[1:07:20] faith
[1:07:22] no not in Israel
[1:07:25] and I say unto you that many shall come
[1:07:27] from the East and the west and shall sit
[1:07:29] down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in
[1:07:33] the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:07:34] but the children of the Kingdom shall be
[1:07:36] cast out into outer Darkness there shall
[1:07:39] be weeping a gnashing of teeth
[1:07:42] and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy
[1:07:44] way
[1:07:45] and as thou Hast believed
[1:07:48] so be it done unto thee
[1:07:51] and his servant was healed in the
[1:07:53] self-same hour
[1:07:55] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[1:07:58] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:08:00] word
[1:08:02] thank you for the ability to hear what
[1:08:04] the spirit saith unto the church Lord
[1:08:07] father we pray that today would not be
[1:08:09] just a bunch of words father that are
[1:08:11] spoken that are just buzzwords according
[1:08:14] to the message of the hour but Lord
[1:08:16] Jesus that your spirit would Quicken
[1:08:18] this word as it's spoken today and
[1:08:21] father that it wouldn't even be me that
[1:08:22] speaks it Lord that you would come by
[1:08:24] here and speak to all of us this morning
[1:08:26] Father we pray that we could just Commit
[1:08:29] This service into your hands Lord we
[1:08:31] have Lord we've set the atmosphere we
[1:08:33] have all the mechanics lord it's all
[1:08:35] oiled up now and father we just desire
[1:08:37] the Dynamics father to come on the scene
[1:08:40] and add a spark Lord Jesus to this word
[1:08:43] father that when we leave this building
[1:08:45] as our brother prayed already that we
[1:08:47] would say just like those on the road to
[1:08:49] Emmaus oh Father our hearts burned
[1:08:52] within us but Lord Jesus let our hearts
[1:08:54] not just burn within us while we're here
[1:08:57] but let our hearts burn within us as we
[1:08:59] go from here father as we live our lives
[1:09:02] Lord Jesus let it be the testimony of
[1:09:04] Jesus Christ in our lives father we love
[1:09:07] you and we thank you and we just ask all
[1:09:09] these things now in Jesus Christ's name
[1:09:11] we pray amen
[1:09:13] I bless you this morning you may be
[1:09:15] seated
[1:09:19] I just have a couple of announcements
[1:09:21] before we get too far here
[1:09:24] um it's shaping up to be a wonderful
[1:09:26] summer
[1:09:27] we uh
[1:09:29] we have a gym night coming up at Central
[1:09:31] Memorial
[1:09:32] on the 12th
[1:09:34] that's seven to nine PM we have two
[1:09:36] hours
[1:09:37] so we'll probably have uh
[1:09:39] just a good time maybe some volleyball
[1:09:41] and some other games we're working on
[1:09:43] some other stuff so hopefully we'll be
[1:09:46] able to have a good time and uh just
[1:09:48] fellowship with one another let our hair
[1:09:50] down so to speak
[1:09:51] on the 13th there's a ladies brunch it's
[1:09:54] going to be at our house I guess and on
[1:09:57] the 19th we have a prayer meeting
[1:09:58] scheduled for the seven 7 30 in the
[1:10:01] evening here at the church
[1:10:03] the 21st we have a potluck scheduled at
[1:10:07] two o'clock at our house
[1:10:09] once again it'll be the the first one
[1:10:12] actually of the season and we're very
[1:10:13] much looking forward to it
[1:10:19] uh oh I got the dates wrong I apologize
[1:10:21] please refer to the calendar that's
[1:10:23] online
[1:10:25] we have those items happening I think we
[1:10:28] have a convenience service on the 28th
[1:10:30] I think that's correct
[1:10:32] um just just refer to the calendar
[1:10:33] that's online
[1:10:35] um yeah
[1:10:37] so we have all of those events happening
[1:10:39] but please confirm online to the
[1:10:41] calendar
[1:10:42] that would be greatly appreciated it's
[1:10:44] going to be a busy month and I think the
[1:10:45] Lord will certainly bless us
[1:10:48] be happy this morning
[1:10:50] we have some guest Ministry coming in
[1:10:52] and I think I mentioned it a while back
[1:10:54] but we have brother Dale Smith coming
[1:10:55] June the 7th and it's surprising because
[1:10:58] that's not very far away
[1:11:00] I was looking at the calendars and I'm
[1:11:02] sure that's the date I confirmed that
[1:11:04] one so brother Dale Smith will be here
[1:11:06] on June the 7th for one service that's a
[1:11:08] Wednesday evening and if you've never
[1:11:10] heard brother Dale Smith I highly
[1:11:11] recommend checking it out it's uh it's
[1:11:14] real good I remember when I first
[1:11:16] started coming to church in the upper
[1:11:18] room brother Dale Smith he was here in
[1:11:20] the upper room and he preached a sermon
[1:11:22] called a snake bit dog
[1:11:24] and and what a tremendous sermon that
[1:11:26] that was all about a man that get gets
[1:11:29] bit by a snake a dog that gets bit by a
[1:11:31] snake man's best friend and how that dog
[1:11:34] is supposed to be man's best friend but
[1:11:36] once it's bit by the snake and that
[1:11:37] poison that Venom gets running through
[1:11:39] his veins he'll never come to his best
[1:11:41] friend his best friend is a man
[1:11:43] but he won't come to his best friend and
[1:11:45] he likened it to a human that gets bit
[1:11:48] by the devil that gets bit by a spirit
[1:11:50] and when that Spirit starts coursing
[1:11:52] through the veins oh he had such graphic
[1:11:54] descriptions boy I won't go too far into
[1:11:57] it but uh it was a tremendous message
[1:11:59] brother Dale Smith has a way of of
[1:12:01] really bringing things to life
[1:12:04] um that's in June in July we have uh
[1:12:06] brother Danny Daniel del mundo from
[1:12:09] Philippines we don't have the dates
[1:12:12] confirmed but he's coming with his
[1:12:13] family and we'll see what we can do for
[1:12:16] the dates and how it will all work out
[1:12:18] but we're trying to facilitate that in
[1:12:20] July and then we have another brother
[1:12:22] coming I don't know if he's ever been
[1:12:23] here before brother Andrew Glover I'm
[1:12:26] sure that some people have heard of him
[1:12:27] he's from the south and uh he'll
[1:12:30] probably be coming in August again it's
[1:12:33] sort of soft dates we're just trying to
[1:12:35] put it together it takes a bit to
[1:12:37] actually get these schedules lined up
[1:12:38] but we'll just see what the Lord has in
[1:12:40] store because we know when
[1:12:42] things line up it's the will of the Lord
[1:12:45] so uh yeah we're trying to see what the
[1:12:48] Lord will do isn't it wonderful I I
[1:12:50] never want to forget it and I want to
[1:12:52] always try and remember what was it like
[1:12:54] with covid there was a time where these
[1:12:57] doors were closed and I remember sitting
[1:12:59] here with a laptop one time maybe two
[1:13:01] with nobody else in the church at all it
[1:13:05] was just me and there's times where we
[1:13:07] had 12 people I think uh just enough
[1:13:10] people to lead songs remember singing to
[1:13:12] nobody brother Paul except for the Lord
[1:13:14] there's no people here we don't sing to
[1:13:16] one another but we sing to the Lord I
[1:13:18] get it but it's kind of tough to preach
[1:13:20] to no no audience here it's kind of
[1:13:22] tough to sing to nobody with nobody but
[1:13:25] when we get together there's something
[1:13:26] special that happens when we bring our
[1:13:28] licks of fire together and I think it's
[1:13:30] important to just remember that we have
[1:13:32] this ability this is a gift from God we
[1:13:35] never want to ever take it for granted
[1:13:37] that this is just the way it's always
[1:13:39] going to be because we saw it and just
[1:13:41] about in the moment in a twinkling of an
[1:13:43] eye it changed forever
[1:13:44] is what it seemed like
[1:13:47] but you know the Lord is good I believe
[1:13:49] that was just an example of what's yet
[1:13:52] to come
[1:13:53] that was simply a birth pain brother
[1:13:55] Branham talked about that the world is
[1:13:57] going through birth pains and that's
[1:13:59] exactly what we've experienced in our
[1:14:02] day we know that the world is now under
[1:14:04] the complete control we know it's been
[1:14:06] for years according to what the prophet
[1:14:07] said but now it's under the complete
[1:14:09] control of someone somewhere somehow and
[1:14:13] I don't know whether there's a live
[1:14:14] virus I don't know whether the vaccine's
[1:14:16] good or bad the only thing I know is
[1:14:18] that the word of God stands true and you
[1:14:21] know we can say one way or the other way
[1:14:23] and that's exactly what the devil wants
[1:14:24] us to do is to get into a thing about
[1:14:26] whatever whether it's real or whether
[1:14:28] it's not the one thing that is real is
[1:14:30] something got the attention of the
[1:14:31] entire world all at the very same time
[1:14:34] and I would say it's just a test
[1:14:37] of the Beast system
[1:14:39] just to see if we can actually put our
[1:14:41] finger on the pulse and push the button
[1:14:43] in every single country around the world
[1:14:45] and everyone will comply to some way or
[1:14:47] another and every country did this
[1:14:49] affected the whole entire world so
[1:14:51] brothers and sisters we never want to
[1:14:52] take it for granted what a tremendous
[1:14:54] thing it is to get together maybe I'm
[1:14:55] just going on and I apologize if it
[1:14:58] sounds like I'm rambling but
[1:14:59] it's just wonderful to get together with
[1:15:01] our brothers and sisters of like
[1:15:03] Precious faith
[1:15:04] because that's what we're instructed to
[1:15:06] do
[1:15:07] that's why it does something to us
[1:15:09] talking today about this Centurion and
[1:15:11] you know kind of just going forwards
[1:15:14] with the thought that we've had in the
[1:15:15] past talking about our words and and we
[1:15:18] had talked a bit about spiritual viruses
[1:15:20] and how we can be a carrier of a
[1:15:22] spiritual virus and not even recognize
[1:15:24] it and pass it off to someone and
[1:15:26] someone can take it and maybe it won't
[1:15:28] affect them and they can pass it off to
[1:15:30] someone and maybe it won't affect them
[1:15:31] and it can just do that it can just go
[1:15:33] around and be alive but not really
[1:15:35] affect anyone but there's one person
[1:15:37] might pick up that that spiritual virus
[1:15:39] and it travels by words that we speak
[1:15:41] and when they get that it can actually
[1:15:43] put them on spiritual life support
[1:15:45] brothers and sisters they come to a
[1:15:47] place where they start to question uh
[1:15:49] the word of God and maybe even the
[1:15:51] message of the hour wasn't it a
[1:15:52] beautiful message on Wednesday that
[1:15:53] brother Toby got got up here and
[1:15:55] ministered just took the time to lay out
[1:15:57] you know what we believe is not he said
[1:15:59] it a couple times cunningly devised
[1:16:01] fables of men what we believe is the
[1:16:04] truth according to the word for our day
[1:16:06] and we're going to get into it a bit
[1:16:08] today I think it's such a beautiful
[1:16:09] beautiful thing you know we're not just
[1:16:11] gathering around a man we're gathering
[1:16:14] around the word of God
[1:16:15] and all that we believe is what Paul
[1:16:18] preached and all the people that claim
[1:16:20] to be the Christians around the world
[1:16:22] claim to believe what Paul preached
[1:16:25] but does everybody take what Paul
[1:16:27] preached and apply it
[1:16:29] or do they say that well that was for a
[1:16:31] different day that was for a different
[1:16:32] culture that was for a different thing
[1:16:35] sometimes that seems to be the way it is
[1:16:37] and we don't want to put anybody in or
[1:16:39] anybody out but all I can say is God's
[1:16:42] not going to say did you did you did you
[1:16:44] accept my word according to what you
[1:16:46] were taught or did you accept my word
[1:16:48] according to the way I sent it to you
[1:16:51] we're going to be given the option to to
[1:16:53] accept it or reject it and you know
[1:16:55] choosing to reject Truth for our day is
[1:16:58] making a choice
[1:17:00] and we want to make sure that we make
[1:17:01] the right choice
[1:17:03] because we know that just a little
[1:17:05] further in uh backwards actually in in
[1:17:08] Matthew not everyone
[1:17:11] that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter
[1:17:14] into the kingdom of heaven but he that
[1:17:16] doeth the will of My Father which is in
[1:17:18] heaven many will say to me in that day
[1:17:20] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:17:23] name
[1:17:24] and surely to goodness they will have
[1:17:26] prophesied in the name of Jesus
[1:17:29] and in the name in thy name have cast
[1:17:32] out Devils sure
[1:17:35] they will have cast out devils
[1:17:38] and in thy name done many wonderful
[1:17:40] works
[1:17:42] tremendous works
[1:17:44] maybe people raised from the dead may be
[1:17:46] healed from sickness maybe bank accounts
[1:17:49] full maybe vehicles that just die
[1:17:51] someone prays over maybe they lay hands
[1:17:54] on a vehicle and it just comes to life
[1:17:56] again we hear about stories where people
[1:17:58] are crashing having a terrible accident
[1:18:00] in their vehicle and suddenly they're
[1:18:02] just on the side of the road and
[1:18:03] everything is fine there's no issues
[1:18:06] many wonderful works
[1:18:09] but he's going to say not that you do
[1:18:10] all of that did you follow my word did
[1:18:14] you follow the word of God for your day
[1:18:17] because we know he's the same yesterday
[1:18:18] today and forever and we always go back
[1:18:20] to it but I think it's such an easy
[1:18:21] simple description and God is like that
[1:18:24] he likes to make sure that we understand
[1:18:25] he doesn't give us such a a great
[1:18:27] mystery that we just can't understand it
[1:18:29] and I think if somebody does preach a
[1:18:31] mystery that is incomprehensible that we
[1:18:33] don't understand it I want to ask are
[1:18:36] they preaching Truth for our day because
[1:18:38] we've been given the entire mystery the
[1:18:40] entire word of God has been open to us
[1:18:43] it's no longer a mystery brothers and
[1:18:44] sisters
[1:18:45] [Applause]
[1:18:48] but Noah his message was simple
[1:18:51] It's Gonna Rain God said build a boat if
[1:18:53] you want to be saved get in a boat
[1:18:56] quite simple
[1:18:58] but then what happened
[1:18:59] Satan got into reasoning part of
[1:19:02] people's minds and said well it's never
[1:19:03] rained before and we've got scientific
[1:19:05] achievement and we can send Rockets up
[1:19:07] into the atmosphere and prove contrary
[1:19:09] to the word that you're trying to tell
[1:19:11] us Noah
[1:19:13] we can prove it scientifically it's
[1:19:15] never rained before and it's never going
[1:19:16] to rain consciously reasonably you're
[1:19:19] talking about something that's insane
[1:19:21] why would you talk that way and Noah
[1:19:23] would say because God said so
[1:19:24] because I heard God speak to me directly
[1:19:27] he made me his his Messenger on Earth
[1:19:29] for the day and now the people had the
[1:19:31] opportunity to accept him as the
[1:19:33] messenger or reject him as the messenger
[1:19:35] and those people that accepted him as
[1:19:37] the messenger they survived
[1:19:40] and the people that rejected him
[1:19:42] they didn't live
[1:19:45] the the breath that was in their lungs
[1:19:46] that was that gift we prayed about
[1:19:48] earlier it was just taken away they lost
[1:19:50] that gift
[1:19:52] there might have been people that said
[1:19:53] you know I I believe that you're his
[1:19:55] messenger but I just don't like your
[1:19:57] boat
[1:19:58] I just don't like the way you've built
[1:20:00] your boat I think it could be done
[1:20:02] better so I'm just gonna go and build my
[1:20:03] own boat and I'm going to be close by
[1:20:06] and I'm going to be watching what
[1:20:07] happens and we'll just see what happens
[1:20:09] if it starts to rain we'll just jump in
[1:20:11] our boat and maybe we've built all of
[1:20:13] the the technology that you've built
[1:20:15] into your boat into our boat but God
[1:20:18] said there's only one messenger in that
[1:20:19] day and if you follow his word you'll
[1:20:22] live but any other way you'll die
[1:20:26] not everyone that's saith unto me Lord
[1:20:28] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:20:30] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[1:20:33] Father which is in heaven I had spoken
[1:20:37] about this little while ago brothers and
[1:20:38] sisters what is his will which is in
[1:20:40] heaven what is his will his will is his
[1:20:43] word right that's what his will is it's
[1:20:46] not what a theologian would say it's not
[1:20:49] what a pastor would say it's not what an
[1:20:51] evangelist would say and I will go so
[1:20:53] far as to say it's not even what a
[1:20:55] prophet would say if it were not the
[1:20:57] inspiration of the Holy Ghost living out
[1:20:58] through that Prophet because the prophet
[1:21:00] original
[1:21:01] right Paul he said if an angel or
[1:21:04] anybody else speak anything different
[1:21:06] than what I've already told you let him
[1:21:08] be accursed even if it's an angel from
[1:21:11] heaven and he says hold on a second
[1:21:13] let's talk about this again just so you
[1:21:15] get it straight if anybody says anything
[1:21:18] contrary to what we've already taught
[1:21:20] you
[1:21:21] let him be accursed
[1:21:25] his will is his word
[1:21:29] brother random talks about this
[1:21:30] Centurion
[1:21:32] and uh
[1:21:33] I just want to check it I believe
[1:21:36] could be wrong I want to be sure yeah
[1:21:38] it's out of the message respects I don't
[1:21:40] know if anybody's listened to that but
[1:21:42] there's so many points in that message
[1:21:44] talking about God's word and to be able
[1:21:46] to respect God's word and you know
[1:21:48] brother Bradham he even says it if
[1:21:50] someone is wrong
[1:21:51] if someone is incorrect and you know
[1:21:54] they are
[1:21:55] just respect them anyways
[1:21:57] because that could be God working
[1:21:59] through that person and you know what
[1:22:01] happens in our lives brothers and
[1:22:02] sisters we get faced with so many trials
[1:22:03] do you think that any one of our trials
[1:22:05] is an accident
[1:22:06] any one of our trials is ordained and it
[1:22:09] just happens the the cosmics Collide and
[1:22:11] suddenly we've got this problem God knew
[1:22:13] it before the foundation of the world
[1:22:14] and he allowed that trial to happen in
[1:22:16] our lives he allows the trials that are
[1:22:18] going to happen in our lives so that he
[1:22:19] can show Who We Are
[1:22:22] the trials
[1:22:24] of our faith are precious
[1:22:28] they're more precious than the gold that
[1:22:30] we see in this world they're more
[1:22:32] precious than the cars we have than the
[1:22:33] houses we have than the bank accounts
[1:22:35] and Investments that we have
[1:22:39] out of this message respects Brother
[1:22:40] Brad I'm talking about this Centurion he
[1:22:43] says so we find one time that there was
[1:22:45] a Roman and he was a great man
[1:22:47] and he loved the Jews and he had a
[1:22:49] servant that was sick
[1:22:51] himself he didn't feel worthy to go ask
[1:22:53] Jesus
[1:22:54] see you always want to feel
[1:22:57] a lot littler than what you are
[1:23:01] he says don't never be big in your own
[1:23:04] sight see
[1:23:07] was this brother Bradham speaking here
[1:23:09] it was but what was the inspiration
[1:23:10] behind it brothers and sisters
[1:23:14] this isn't just some gimmick to try and
[1:23:16] psychologically make you feel better or
[1:23:18] make other people feel better it's not a
[1:23:20] psychological tactic to go and sell
[1:23:21] things or or gain favor in people's
[1:23:24] sight what this is is pleasing in the
[1:23:26] sight of the Lord
[1:23:29] he had a servant that was sick himself
[1:23:31] he didn't feel worthy to go and ask
[1:23:33] Jesus so you always want to feel a lot
[1:23:35] littler than what you are don't you
[1:23:37] never be a big man in your own sight see
[1:23:40] now and if you're big let somebody else
[1:23:43] say it about you
[1:23:49] but now
[1:23:50] I just want to stop here and say this
[1:23:52] you know brother brownie tells that
[1:23:54] story
[1:23:55] probably remember it where he had
[1:23:57] preached a service and and he went out
[1:23:58] back out outside of the church and he
[1:24:00] was shaking hands with the people and
[1:24:02] people came and said God bless you
[1:24:04] brother Bradham I really enjoyed that
[1:24:06] service and there was a man who was a
[1:24:08] minister he was standing there and he
[1:24:09] watched brother Bradham a few times
[1:24:11] receive the thank you for that service
[1:24:13] and what a wonderful thing it was and
[1:24:15] the minister came up to him after and he
[1:24:18] said you know God bless you brother
[1:24:20] I just don't agree with what you're
[1:24:22] receiving that that that thank you for
[1:24:24] those services and and brother Branham
[1:24:26] he I'm you're gonna have to listen to it
[1:24:28] for yourself but brother random he says
[1:24:29] to him you know there's there's a
[1:24:30] difference here between you and I and
[1:24:32] and that Minister said what's that the
[1:24:35] minister was saying that he shouldn't
[1:24:36] receive it I'm I'm totally mixing this
[1:24:39] up but what brother Branham he said was
[1:24:41] you know what there's one difference
[1:24:42] between you and me is that I'm honest
[1:24:43] about it I like it there's nothing wrong
[1:24:46] with getting a compliment and receiving
[1:24:47] a compliment but when we do brothers and
[1:24:49] sisters we need to make sure that we
[1:24:51] understand where that compliment
[1:24:53] ultimately rests and if we have any good
[1:24:55] gift in our lives it's only because
[1:24:57] God's given it to us it's not because we
[1:24:59] have done anything we've just simply
[1:25:01] allowed the Lord to manifest in our
[1:25:03] lives take a look at Daniel what did he
[1:25:05] do he applied the word in his life and
[1:25:06] God manifested greatly Joseph he applied
[1:25:09] the word in his life no matter what came
[1:25:11] his way and God manifested through him
[1:25:14] mightily
[1:25:16] never be big in your own sight see now I
[1:25:18] know somebody say you're big let
[1:25:19] somebody else say it about you see now
[1:25:22] when you were This Woman This Man rather
[1:25:24] he said he was a Roman Centurion and he
[1:25:27] had a sick servant so he sent to get his
[1:25:30] sixth servant healed
[1:25:32] and Jesus said I'll come heal him can
[1:25:34] you imagine that knowing that the
[1:25:36] prophet was in the land maybe it was
[1:25:38] brother Bradham with the great healing
[1:25:40] campaign you just send a note and say
[1:25:41] hey come and pray for my servant my
[1:25:43] servant's sick will you come and pray
[1:25:44] for him this was Jesus Christ and he
[1:25:47] said sure I'll come
[1:25:49] what a tremendous thing
[1:25:51] yeah so on his Road the Romans seen him
[1:25:53] coming
[1:25:54] it's Brother Brad I'm speaking I imagine
[1:25:55] he said oh my here comes the Holy One
[1:26:00] here comes that Holy One well I'm a non
[1:26:04] uh uh non-count Gentile I'm I'm a Roman
[1:26:08] Centurion I'm a general or an officer
[1:26:12] I really not a Jew
[1:26:16] I have no right for that holy man to
[1:26:18] come
[1:26:19] see the respects
[1:26:23] see I don't have no right to have that
[1:26:25] Holy servant of God come to my house
[1:26:31] and you know I just want to pause here
[1:26:33] too
[1:26:34] just to think about it there's only one
[1:26:37] that can receive that kind of accolade
[1:26:40] and that's God in flesh who is Jesus
[1:26:44] Christ
[1:26:46] we know there's a few examples in the
[1:26:47] Bible Joshua when he went out to meet
[1:26:49] that man he saw
[1:26:51] standing there with his sword he drew
[1:26:53] his sword and said who are you
[1:26:55] are you are you for us or are you
[1:26:57] against us and what did that man tell
[1:26:59] him he said loose the shoes off your
[1:27:01] feet because the ground you're standing
[1:27:03] on is Holy and and he worshiped him he
[1:27:06] understood he received that worship too
[1:27:08] but we know the two witnesses in in the
[1:27:11] two men in Revelations John the type of
[1:27:14] the Bride tried to worship those Angel
[1:27:16] Messengers and what did they say they
[1:27:18] said see thou do it not
[1:27:20] for I'm just a servant just like you
[1:27:22] don't don't try and worship me worship
[1:27:24] God
[1:27:27] so I just want to point out that the
[1:27:28] true servants always going to point to
[1:27:30] Christ
[1:27:31] always going to point to Christ
[1:27:34] so I'm coming down coming to the door
[1:27:37] and he called him said Lord I'm not
[1:27:39] worthy that you should come under my
[1:27:40] roof probably had a palace of a home
[1:27:43] a centurion said I'm not worthy that
[1:27:46] you'd come under my roof
[1:27:49] and I I didn't think myself worthy to
[1:27:51] even come to you
[1:27:53] can you imagine that
[1:27:55] I sent a messenger because I didn't
[1:27:57] think that I could even come into your
[1:27:58] presence so I sent some some of your
[1:28:02] your own blessed people the Jews but I
[1:28:04] have a servant here that's very sick and
[1:28:07] he said I'm a man under Authority said I
[1:28:10] say to this Soldier you go and he goes
[1:28:12] and to this one you come and he comes
[1:28:14] what did he say there
[1:28:16] I know that you have all power
[1:28:20] you can say to this disease go
[1:28:24] and it goes
[1:28:26] and you can say to this one come and it
[1:28:30] would come see
[1:28:32] he recognized
[1:28:34] this just makes me think brothers and
[1:28:35] sisters we got to be so careful when we
[1:28:37] pray
[1:28:38] we were having a conversation a little
[1:28:40] while ago we can have Bulldog faith and
[1:28:42] say that God's word says that we should
[1:28:44] be healed and and by his stripes we're
[1:28:46] healed and we should be getting God to
[1:28:48] activate because we're actually
[1:28:50] declaring his word but what if God put a
[1:28:53] disease on someone for a purpose
[1:28:55] brother Branham talks about that we
[1:28:58] don't want to be saying God I want to
[1:29:00] change your will
[1:29:01] we we don't want to do that sometimes
[1:29:04] God will allow something to come on a
[1:29:06] person for a purpose
[1:29:07] so now we kind of go in in Full Circle
[1:29:10] and it could sound very nebulous brother
[1:29:12] Barry where you going with this is is
[1:29:14] there's only one way to pray as far as I
[1:29:16] can tell brothers and sisters and say
[1:29:17] not not my will but thy will let thy
[1:29:20] will be done in this situation Lord if
[1:29:22] you want this disease to be on a person
[1:29:24] then it's going to be on that person but
[1:29:26] if you don't want it there guess what's
[1:29:28] going to happen because you're a man of
[1:29:30] great Authority if you want that disease
[1:29:32] to come it'll come if you want that
[1:29:33] disease to go it'll go
[1:29:37] but that's kind of what I think causes
[1:29:40] such confusion today even in around the
[1:29:42] message of the hour
[1:29:44] is that we have a a I had a mental
[1:29:47] conception that maybe we should be able
[1:29:49] to just activate the faith of God and
[1:29:51] and get him to move on a situation and
[1:29:54] then we'll know that we believe but
[1:29:56] that's not the evidence of the Holy
[1:29:57] Ghost as we read in the beginning here
[1:29:59] in in Matthew chapter seven not everyone
[1:30:02] that has many signs and wonders that can
[1:30:05] prophesy that can heal the sick maybe
[1:30:07] raise the dead go through all the many
[1:30:09] signs and wonders that's going to cause
[1:30:10] you to believe anymore no there's people
[1:30:14] that are going to try and get in there
[1:30:15] we know the other story that Jesus gives
[1:30:17] that there is a wedding a wedding
[1:30:19] happened and and everyone in the
[1:30:22] Oriental tradition is giving a wedding
[1:30:23] garment and they're invited into the
[1:30:25] wedding supper and while they're in
[1:30:27] there at the festive Festival
[1:30:30] he finds one without a garment on and he
[1:30:32] says friend how did you get in here
[1:30:34] brother Branham he says you know what he
[1:30:36] did he crawled around the backside
[1:30:37] through a denomination through the
[1:30:39] window he tried to get in his own way
[1:30:41] and we talked about that in the story of
[1:30:43] Noah already we can't come any other way
[1:30:45] because he is the door to the Sheepfold
[1:30:48] he is the great Shepherd and we know he
[1:30:51] also talks about it brother Bradham does
[1:30:53] it the shepherd what does the shepherd
[1:30:54] do he lays down in front of the door he
[1:30:56] doesn't just close the door and go back
[1:30:58] into his house again he lays down in
[1:31:00] front of the door and if anybody's going
[1:31:02] to get into that Sheepfold they're going
[1:31:03] to go through him
[1:31:05] they're not just getting it on their own
[1:31:08] but if we want to come to that wedding
[1:31:10] supper we've got to come with a wedding
[1:31:12] garment on the only way that we're going
[1:31:13] to make ourselves ready is to dress
[1:31:16] ourselves in his word
[1:31:19] we know that in Revelations 19 let us
[1:31:21] rejoice and be exceedingly glad let's be
[1:31:23] very glad for the marriage of the Lamb
[1:31:26] has come and what his wife hath made
[1:31:29] herself ready how does she make herself
[1:31:31] ready she puts on that wedding garment
[1:31:33] that wedding garment is the word of God
[1:31:35] in her life
[1:31:37] living out
[1:31:40] he goes on to say come come and it and
[1:31:43] it would come see he recognized as he
[1:31:45] had authority over these soldiers so
[1:31:48] Jesus had authority over all the
[1:31:50] sickness and diseases only thing you
[1:31:53] have to do Lord is just speak the word
[1:31:57] that's it
[1:31:59] just speak the word and my servant will
[1:32:03] live
[1:32:04] can you imagine that the people on that
[1:32:06] day must have thought he was a little
[1:32:08] crazy why would he be that way why would
[1:32:10] he be acting that way but somehow
[1:32:12] somewhere along the way God God gave him
[1:32:14] a revelation it wasn't something that a
[1:32:17] man gave him he had a revelation of who
[1:32:19] this this man Jesus was in his day
[1:32:23] just speak the word and that's it
[1:32:26] Jesus stopped turned around to them Jews
[1:32:30] and said I haven't found Faith like that
[1:32:32] over in Israel
[1:32:36] he said it's all right with your servant
[1:32:38] amen why
[1:32:40] because he respected it
[1:32:43] he respected Jesus Christ
[1:32:46] who was the god of Heaven
[1:32:49] I don't know how we can read quotes like
[1:32:51] this and come up with another
[1:32:52] identification for Jesus Christ
[1:32:55] I don't get it but you know what it was
[1:32:58] the respect that he had
[1:33:00] for Jesus and today brothers and sisters
[1:33:03] how does this apply to us today it's the
[1:33:05] respect that we have today for the Lord
[1:33:08] Jesus
[1:33:09] because this is the Lord Jesus right
[1:33:11] here brothers and sisters we'll get to
[1:33:14] that in a little bit I I hope but you
[1:33:16] know what the word of God is print form
[1:33:18] Jesus Christ in our day and if we're
[1:33:20] willing to accept print form word of
[1:33:22] Jesus Christ entirely then we're willing
[1:33:25] to accept Jesus Christ himself but if
[1:33:28] we're not willing to accept print form
[1:33:30] word of Jesus Christ in our day then
[1:33:32] guess what
[1:33:34] we're only accepting a part of Jesus
[1:33:36] Christ himself
[1:33:38] and that's the troubling part with the
[1:33:40] world
[1:33:41] I was no better until I was shown a
[1:33:44] further light and you know when I say
[1:33:46] that some people might say wow that's
[1:33:47] getting a little bit crazy now you're
[1:33:49] really stretching it brother and I know
[1:33:50] everyone here probably believes what I'm
[1:33:52] saying but you know what there is a
[1:33:54] further light and that furtherance of
[1:33:55] the light isn't a new word that
[1:33:57] furtherance of the light is an unfolding
[1:33:59] of the existing word and that's what
[1:34:02] makes our Prophet a prophet because he
[1:34:04] pointed to this word
[1:34:07] and he even said the same thing that
[1:34:08] Paul said hey if you can't take my word
[1:34:10] for it take his word for it if we would
[1:34:12] just listen to what he said if we would
[1:34:13] ever get the chance to hear that that's
[1:34:15] what he said if you can't take my word
[1:34:16] for it take what God Said for it the
[1:34:18] print form Jesus Christ in our day
[1:34:22] the ink on paper
[1:34:25] you know brother Adam he says this when
[1:34:26] we want to be healed why do we want to
[1:34:28] be healed
[1:34:29] I think it's so important brothers and
[1:34:31] sisters to recognize when we talk about
[1:34:33] speaking the word there has to be a
[1:34:36] purpose for the words that we speak
[1:34:38] whether it's simple conversation or or
[1:34:42] whether it is speaking the word of faith
[1:34:45] in our lives why do we speak a word what
[1:34:47] is it that we're doing
[1:34:49] you probably want to find this brother
[1:34:50] I'll oh sorry I boy I copy and paste and
[1:34:54] I forgot to bring it up there it's out
[1:34:55] of 65 I've heard but now I see
[1:34:58] I'll give you the paragraph even
[1:35:01] you have it 58
[1:35:04] someone come not long ago a group of men
[1:35:06] some of them listening in tonight and
[1:35:08] told me said I kept telling them go to
[1:35:10] Kentucky oil's down there I knew it was
[1:35:13] I seen a vision
[1:35:16] kind of tremendous story here and it
[1:35:18] almost sounds like he contradicts
[1:35:20] himself but sometimes I think the word
[1:35:22] of God comes to us a certain way and we
[1:35:24] can either choose to accept it in that
[1:35:25] moment or just reject it and if we
[1:35:27] choose to accept it then you know what
[1:35:29] sometimes a great blessing can come our
[1:35:30] way and if we choose to reject it then
[1:35:32] we lose it we've lost it we can't go
[1:35:35] back to it
[1:35:37] someone come not long ago a group of men
[1:35:39] someone I'm listening in tonight and
[1:35:40] told me said I kept telling them go to
[1:35:41] Kentucky oil's down there I knew seen in
[1:35:43] a vision well brother Dimas and them
[1:35:46] didn't go for a long time
[1:35:49] after a while finally they said after
[1:35:51] Texas had moved in and they said now
[1:35:53] we're going down they saw other people
[1:35:55] had interest in it I said you ought to
[1:35:58] have went a long time ago but they
[1:36:00] didn't do it Dima said I made a great
[1:36:02] mistake by that in in that by by not
[1:36:05] doing that brother Bradham I said if
[1:36:07] you'd have went down there you'd have
[1:36:08] had it all
[1:36:11] I don't know if it's in here or further
[1:36:13] on but he talks about how much oil
[1:36:14] flowed from this
[1:36:16] from this uh well here
[1:36:18] well they wouldn't listen
[1:36:20] then the first
[1:36:22] then for we left that night the place
[1:36:24] where we were having lunch the Holy
[1:36:26] Spirit showed me a great crack in the
[1:36:27] earth and then that was full of oil
[1:36:30] and these overflows in Kentucky was just
[1:36:32] little beds of oil that they were
[1:36:34] pumping from but this one come from the
[1:36:37] mainstream and I said brother Dimas it's
[1:36:39] there
[1:36:41] so they went to searching for it said go
[1:36:43] down and tell us where where the oil
[1:36:45] well is
[1:36:48] now he says oh no no no no no no
[1:36:51] see we don't use the gift of God for
[1:36:53] commercial no no
[1:36:55] he could tell me where it was at
[1:36:57] but I don't have any need of it
[1:37:00] I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask
[1:37:02] him see
[1:37:04] if I'd had a need of it I believe I'd
[1:37:06] ask him and he'd tell me
[1:37:08] isn't that interesting it sounds like a
[1:37:10] total contradiction
[1:37:13] but here we have now these brothers are
[1:37:15] seeing that there's actually something
[1:37:17] to this and they're getting greedy over
[1:37:19] it now they want a clamor for this
[1:37:21] because they can see the dollar signs
[1:37:23] and the cash register ringing and see
[1:37:25] their stock counter going up and and on
[1:37:27] and on and on
[1:37:28] but now he backs away and says no no I
[1:37:31] told you I told you all I needed to and
[1:37:32] there's no doubt in my mind when you
[1:37:34] look at this story here by him telling
[1:37:36] them what they what he told them if they
[1:37:38] would have just gone to Kentucky they
[1:37:39] could have gone and sat down in a cafe
[1:37:40] and said well I wonder where we would
[1:37:42] need to go this is just me saying this
[1:37:44] this is just my view uh
[1:37:48] dramatizing it they could have gone
[1:37:50] anywhere and and I bet you somebody
[1:37:52] would have said something that would
[1:37:53] have triggered them to know exactly
[1:37:54] where to go to find this oil if they
[1:37:57] would have just listened to the prophet
[1:37:58] in in their day there but they didn't
[1:38:00] and so once they realized the greed
[1:38:03] started to rise up and then he said no
[1:38:04] I'm not you know what you had your
[1:38:06] chance you passed up now it's gone
[1:38:09] says I I believe if I'd asked him he'd
[1:38:12] tell me but see this is what I want to
[1:38:13] get to today brothers and sisters he
[1:38:15] says but first you see your motives and
[1:38:17] objectives has to be right
[1:38:20] you have to have reasons for this
[1:38:23] God don't give you those things just
[1:38:26] because you ask
[1:38:29] how many times do we ask according to
[1:38:31] the word of God
[1:38:32] or do we ask like in the Book of James
[1:38:35] so that we can consume it upon our the
[1:38:37] lusts of our flesh the things in this
[1:38:39] life that we we desire so greatly we
[1:38:42] maybe Pine away for a fancy new house or
[1:38:45] or or tremendous wardrobe of clothing or
[1:38:49] or maybe a a fancy new church building
[1:38:51] or or maybe a a really fine car what
[1:38:55] would it what is it that we're asking
[1:38:56] for
[1:38:57] but first your motives and objectives
[1:39:00] has to be right you have to have reasons
[1:39:02] for this God don't give you those things
[1:39:04] just because you ask
[1:39:06] and you cannot ask in faith unless
[1:39:09] there's a real objective to that to be
[1:39:12] in the will of God
[1:39:14] and I can't help but think brothers and
[1:39:16] sisters as we read this as we talk today
[1:39:18] we we hear it's got to be in the will of
[1:39:21] God what's the will of God
[1:39:23] it's his word that's the will of God
[1:39:25] I've said this many times I told you I
[1:39:27] was perplexed over it for a long time
[1:39:29] but God made it so clear to me his will
[1:39:32] is his word it's got to be according to
[1:39:34] the will of God he goes on to say see if
[1:39:37] you want to be well what do you want to
[1:39:40] be well for
[1:39:44] see if you want to be healed what's the
[1:39:47] reason you want to be healed
[1:39:49] what are you telling God
[1:39:54] what do you want to do with your life
[1:39:56] when you get healed see
[1:39:59] there's got to be you've got to have a
[1:40:01] motive and objective
[1:40:03] and they have to be right according to
[1:40:05] the will of God
[1:40:08] many times we'll pray I was
[1:40:10] this way for many years Lord just show
[1:40:13] me your will show me your will if I
[1:40:15] could just know your will in the matter
[1:40:17] then I would be able to be okay I would
[1:40:19] I would know what is his will brothers
[1:40:21] and sisters it's his word of his word if
[1:40:24] we can actually take the word and apply
[1:40:25] it in every situation and make sure the
[1:40:27] thoughts that we're thinking the
[1:40:29] thoughts that come to us and run through
[1:40:31] our thinking they actually go through
[1:40:33] the mind of Christ we take every single
[1:40:35] thought into captivity not just into the
[1:40:38] pocket not just into a memory bank but
[1:40:40] into the word of God when a thought
[1:40:43] comes into our mind we've got to be
[1:40:44] running it through the mind of Christ
[1:40:46] that's why he said let this mind that
[1:40:47] was in Christ Jesus be in you
[1:40:50] because he knew the greatest battle ever
[1:40:52] fought is going to be in the mind
[1:40:56] you've got to have a motive and
[1:40:57] objective
[1:40:59] and they have to be right according to
[1:41:01] the will of God and then when faith is
[1:41:04] revealed to you and God by his Sovereign
[1:41:07] Grace places that faith in there then
[1:41:10] it's over see
[1:41:13] now we can talk about a few different
[1:41:14] examples than we did in the past one of
[1:41:16] them is is the squirrels
[1:41:18] he was out there squirrel hunting and
[1:41:20] there's no squirrels around and and he
[1:41:22] says he wanted to get Three Squirrels
[1:41:24] here's the voice and starts to have a
[1:41:25] conversation with seemingly nobody there
[1:41:27] was nobody around but he has this
[1:41:29] conversation and he has a conversation
[1:41:31] with god
[1:41:32] he says you want three squirrels okay
[1:41:35] however you say it that's how it'll be
[1:41:37] you say the word why would he do that
[1:41:40] because it doesn't sound like it's
[1:41:42] anything rational
[1:41:43] I I would say it this way brothers and
[1:41:45] sisters as far as I can tell is is so
[1:41:47] that sister Hattie Wright her sons could
[1:41:50] receive their salvation
[1:41:51] because if they were just sitting around
[1:41:53] talking about cherry cobbler or sitting
[1:41:56] around talking about the weather or how
[1:41:58] poor they were or how her sister had
[1:42:00] been sick for so many years or all the
[1:42:02] different problems in life maybe what
[1:42:03] was going on in the church or what
[1:42:05] wasn't going on in the church if they
[1:42:06] were just sitting around spreading
[1:42:07] spiritual viruses do you think God would
[1:42:09] have come on the scene but he gave him
[1:42:11] an occasion to say hey wait a second
[1:42:13] there's something greater going on now
[1:42:15] that this word is open to us and what
[1:42:18] happened she said the right thing is
[1:42:19] what the Holy Ghost said to her she said
[1:42:21] the right thing whatever you want you'll
[1:42:23] have and he even gave her the example
[1:42:25] you won a million dollars go for it just
[1:42:27] say the word and it's yours but what
[1:42:30] what triggered it
[1:42:32] brother Branham said the Holy Ghost said
[1:42:35] true brother Branham you said the right
[1:42:36] thing
[1:42:38] that's why I want to harp on this for a
[1:42:40] little bit brothers and sisters we got
[1:42:41] to be saying the right things
[1:42:43] we've been given examples for a purpose
[1:42:45] so that we'll say the right things if we
[1:42:48] say the wrong things we're just putting
[1:42:50] ourselves in neutral we're putting our
[1:42:51] gear shift lever into neutral and we can
[1:42:54] step on the gas pedal all we want we're
[1:42:55] going to blow our engine if we keep that
[1:42:57] up
[1:42:58] but boy oh boy if we can ever just get
[1:43:00] it into gear and let the RPMs go low and
[1:43:03] then slowly let out the clutch and
[1:43:05] slowly step on the gas pedal we're gonna
[1:43:06] go somewhere
[1:43:08] something's gonna happen
[1:43:11] he says and then when it's
[1:43:13] then's when the faith is revealed to you
[1:43:15] and God by his Sovereign Grace places
[1:43:17] that faith in there
[1:43:19] then it's over see
[1:43:21] sister how do you write she said the
[1:43:23] right thing
[1:43:24] and and she asked for the right thing
[1:43:26] first she said the right thing which
[1:43:28] pleased the Holy Spirit right that ain't
[1:43:31] nothing but the truth but then after she
[1:43:33] did that
[1:43:34] she could ask whatever she wanted say
[1:43:36] whatever you want your sister's been
[1:43:38] sick and we've prayed for her for years
[1:43:40] we talked about that why did she want to
[1:43:43] be healed why would she want what was
[1:43:44] the motive and objective why wouldn't
[1:43:46] she want the money they were poor
[1:43:47] brother Bradham says it you're poor
[1:43:49] you've been poor your whole life you
[1:43:51] need money you could use it naturally
[1:43:52] speaking but she knew in her spirit she
[1:43:55] might not have consciously recognized it
[1:43:57] I personally believe she didn't
[1:43:59] consciously recognize it but but maybe
[1:44:01] we could have a conversation about that
[1:44:02] but I believe something spoke from the
[1:44:04] inside of the inside the only thing of
[1:44:06] Eternal value that that word that she
[1:44:08] spoke it triggered something because she
[1:44:10] was speaking the right way having the
[1:44:13] right words
[1:44:14] the Holy Spirit was pleased by it and
[1:44:16] said ask what you want but the holy
[1:44:19] spirit will never deny himself the Holy
[1:44:21] Spirit would never allow her to ask for
[1:44:23] a million dollars so that she could
[1:44:24] consume it on her lust and go buy a
[1:44:26] fancy car or a big fat house
[1:44:28] only the salvation of her sons only the
[1:44:31] only thing that would last for eternity
[1:44:34] right the salvation of her sons and we
[1:44:36] know that in that moment the ones that
[1:44:38] were snickering and jeering over in the
[1:44:40] corner they came and fell over the lap
[1:44:41] of their mama
[1:44:42] can you imagine that brothers and
[1:44:44] sisters as parents to be able to have
[1:44:46] that kind of that kind of word to speak
[1:44:48] over our family to speak over our
[1:44:50] children that we would know for sure
[1:44:52] that they would have salvation eternal
[1:44:54] life
[1:44:57] I want to say it here now brothers and
[1:44:59] sisters you have that power
[1:45:02] if you come according to the word
[1:45:03] because your motive and your objective
[1:45:06] is going to be right
[1:45:08] but if we're asking about temporal
[1:45:10] things and we don't get them
[1:45:12] don't be surprised
[1:45:15] now sometimes we can get sick in our
[1:45:17] bodies
[1:45:18] and not get healed according to this
[1:45:21] flesh
[1:45:23] you know what whether we live or we die
[1:45:25] we're christs
[1:45:27] but unless we go in the Rapture brothers
[1:45:29] and sisters we know that God has a time
[1:45:32] appointed for every single one of us
[1:45:34] where he's going to pull our flower he's
[1:45:36] going to pluck our flower from the
[1:45:37] bouquet and say it's time to come home
[1:45:39] you've reached Perfection you've reached
[1:45:42] your place
[1:45:44] that's the way it is we can't change
[1:45:46] that but that's why we need to know
[1:45:48] where we stand
[1:45:50] that we don't have a spiritual virus
[1:45:53] and if we have one
[1:45:54] you know how you'll know if you have one
[1:45:57] when you hear the word of God if it gets
[1:45:59] you upset
[1:46:00] if you hear the word of God and
[1:46:02] something says I don't know if I can
[1:46:04] receive it that way that's how you're
[1:46:06] going to know if you've got some kind of
[1:46:07] a virus going on your life
[1:46:10] and that's not to say that any one of us
[1:46:12] brothers and sisters I've been infected
[1:46:14] that's why I'm saying it I've been
[1:46:16] infected
[1:46:18] and someone would come and baby bring
[1:46:20] correction and I would get upset because
[1:46:22] I know they're right
[1:46:24] but it doesn't mean that it changes the
[1:46:26] word of God
[1:46:28] but what was the motive of this
[1:46:30] Centurion brothers and sisters
[1:46:32] he cared about his servant
[1:46:35] he wasn't looking at a dollar value and
[1:46:37] saying you know that slave's worth a lot
[1:46:40] a good one
[1:46:41] right he he's makes me a lot of money
[1:46:44] and I know I could rely on him
[1:46:47] no he he cared about him over in the
[1:46:49] Book of Luke I had it marked out but
[1:46:51] we're not going to go there today for
[1:46:52] time's sake if you read it the same
[1:46:53] story in the Book of Luke it says that
[1:46:55] he cared for him
[1:46:57] that's why he had the right motive
[1:47:02] you know out of one in a million 1965
[1:47:04] paragraph 46.
[1:47:07] he says let me give you a shocking
[1:47:09] something see not all that says unto me
[1:47:11] Lord Lord will enter in
[1:47:14] but the one that doeth the will of my
[1:47:16] father
[1:47:18] his will is his word
[1:47:23] not asking about the things in this life
[1:47:25] not not asking about the temporal things
[1:47:28] but understanding that the word that we
[1:47:30] ask when we ask why are we asking it
[1:47:33] what's the purpose of it
[1:47:35] his will brothers and sisters is his
[1:47:38] word
[1:47:40] out of 65 the choosing of a bride
[1:47:43] paragraph 166.
[1:47:48] I'll just pause and let you get there
[1:47:51] paragraph 166 out of choosing of a bride
[1:47:54] notice
[1:47:55] just a minute a nun in the Catholic
[1:47:57] church that woman to become a nun and
[1:48:00] takes that last Veil she is absolutely
[1:48:03] sold out to that church
[1:48:05] she is soul body and spirit property of
[1:48:08] that church she has no mind of her own
[1:48:12] she can't have
[1:48:14] when she takes that last Veil no mind
[1:48:16] over all no will of her own see out
[1:48:19] there
[1:48:20] that Satan makes them
[1:48:23] his bogus like the true
[1:48:27] she is just like the bride right
[1:48:30] she's veiled
[1:48:31] brother Branham talks about the world
[1:48:33] how the world is veiled with the Lost
[1:48:34] Veil and how how Eve in the Garden of
[1:48:37] Eden she was veiled by the word
[1:48:39] originally
[1:48:41] but here we have the veil over top of
[1:48:43] the nun she just gives her life entirely
[1:48:46] but we know here here we have brother
[1:48:47] random saying that that's the bogus but
[1:48:50] there is a true and the true is the
[1:48:52] Bride of Jesus Christ and she's taking
[1:48:54] that word Veil and putting it over top
[1:48:57] of herself
[1:49:00] she has no mind of her own she can't
[1:49:02] have when she takes that last Veil no
[1:49:03] mind of her own no will of her own see
[1:49:06] out here that Satan makes them his bogus
[1:49:10] like the true I believe I could just
[1:49:12] keep talking about that on and on isn't
[1:49:14] that just a way of the world today
[1:49:15] brothers and sisters brother Bradham
[1:49:17] said in 1933 one of the Visions one of
[1:49:19] the things that's going to change the
[1:49:20] world forever is the right to vote where
[1:49:23] women stop wearing dresses and garments
[1:49:26] that pertain to a woman and they start
[1:49:27] wearing pants and going to work in the
[1:49:29] factories and we know that it turned
[1:49:31] into a revolution and it turned into a
[1:49:32] whole bunch of different things and I'm
[1:49:33] not here to slam the women I'm just here
[1:49:35] to say what the prophet of God said but
[1:49:38] but when when we start to have a mind of
[1:49:40] our own we get out of our position I'm
[1:49:43] not saying that a woman should be
[1:49:44] barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen
[1:49:45] either that is not at all what I'm doing
[1:49:48] brothers and sisters I want to be very
[1:49:49] clear I want to say look at Ephesians
[1:49:51] chapter 5 and make sure the husbands are
[1:49:54] in their position and the wives are in
[1:49:56] their position and the children can look
[1:49:57] up to their parents in their position
[1:49:59] because you know what happens is when
[1:50:01] one person gets out of their position
[1:50:02] and the other person knows it they're
[1:50:04] going to say I don't know if I can have
[1:50:06] confidence in that person I'm gonna have
[1:50:08] to start running everything that they
[1:50:10] say to me to the filter of my own mind
[1:50:14] can you imagine that
[1:50:16] what happens to a marriage when that
[1:50:18] happens brothers and sisters
[1:50:19] what happens in a marriage in a church
[1:50:22] when that happens when a pastor starts
[1:50:25] running stuff through the filter of the
[1:50:27] of his own mind and giving it to the
[1:50:29] people
[1:50:30] you got to kind of run it through your
[1:50:32] own filter at that point and say well I
[1:50:34] don't know
[1:50:36] but what if what if everything that said
[1:50:38] is truth according to the word what what
[1:50:40] what if what the husband does is he
[1:50:42] lives a life so holy before the whole
[1:50:44] entire family that when he walks he's
[1:50:47] like the priest of the home that says
[1:50:49] holy holy holy art thou Lord God
[1:50:52] Almighty and then when the wife walks
[1:50:55] the children hear the same thing holy
[1:50:57] holy holy art thou oh Lord God Almighty
[1:51:00] what a tremendous home that would be
[1:51:05] but if we start to show a mixed signal
[1:51:07] brothers and sisters what's going to
[1:51:08] happen we're going to start to question
[1:51:10] and when that happens we're going to say
[1:51:13] no I need to be able to make decisions
[1:51:14] on my own you know what honey I know
[1:51:16] that you're the boss and everything like
[1:51:18] that but I just don't know about this
[1:51:20] decision this decision is getting me a
[1:51:22] little bit upset and when that happens
[1:51:23] if it happens once it's gonna rattle
[1:51:26] everyone's ability to follow
[1:51:30] because we know the husband is the one
[1:51:32] that's going to answer for the wife
[1:51:33] not the wife for the husband
[1:51:36] and we know that the children are
[1:51:38] looking up to the parents
[1:51:42] she takes that last Veil
[1:51:45] no mind of her own no will of her own
[1:51:49] see out here that Satan makes them his
[1:51:51] bogus like the true
[1:51:53] the True Church of Christ the bride is
[1:51:57] so sold out to him and his promised word
[1:52:00] till the very mind that's in Christ is
[1:52:03] in you
[1:52:04] what a difference
[1:52:06] it's not a theological mind it's it's
[1:52:08] not the Catholic Church mind
[1:52:11] it's not our own traditional teaching or
[1:52:13] culturalistic mind
[1:52:17] it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:52:19] the mind of Christ and how do we get
[1:52:22] that mind of Christ the only way we get
[1:52:23] that mind of Christ is to be truly
[1:52:25] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:52:26] Christ for their mission of our sins and
[1:52:27] then we shall receive the gift of the
[1:52:29] Holy Ghost and outside of that we're
[1:52:30] looking at the bogus it's going to look
[1:52:32] exactly like the same thing it's just
[1:52:35] going to be one word off one word off
[1:52:37] we've heard it said so many times as
[1:52:39] Satan's kingdom the True Church of
[1:52:40] Christ the bride is so sold out to him
[1:52:42] and his promised word till the very mind
[1:52:45] that's in Christ is in you what a
[1:52:46] difference and we find today that the
[1:52:48] modern Church a modern World Church the
[1:52:51] modern world church and also that the
[1:52:55] spiritual church are both pregnanted to
[1:52:58] give birth to Sons
[1:53:01] now we change gears a little bit how are
[1:53:03] they pregnated it's by the word
[1:53:07] it's a spiritual word that happens
[1:53:09] brothers and sisters
[1:53:11] one of them a denominational birth is
[1:53:13] going to be give one of of day to to
[1:53:17] these days at the World Council of
[1:53:19] churches which will produce the world to
[1:53:23] the world the Antichrist
[1:53:25] through a denomination
[1:53:28] that's pretty powerful right there
[1:53:30] but that's what's going to happen and
[1:53:32] how is that going to happen it's not
[1:53:34] because the the world is going to wander
[1:53:36] after the Beast and say I want to follow
[1:53:39] a monster
[1:53:40] no they're going to follow cunningly
[1:53:42] devised fables something other than the
[1:53:46] word of God it's going to be something
[1:53:48] so subtle that it would deceive the very
[1:53:50] elected if it were possible how could it
[1:53:52] be possible to be so subtle that it
[1:53:54] would deceive the very elected if it
[1:53:55] were possible it has to be 99 truth
[1:53:58] otherwise people are going to say no
[1:54:00] it's wrong it's so easy to see it's
[1:54:02] wrong
[1:54:04] I'm not going to harp on it today but
[1:54:06] trinitarian baptism is not according to
[1:54:08] the word of God
[1:54:12] so do you truly receive the baptism of
[1:54:14] the Holy Spirit baptized in trinitarian
[1:54:16] baptism
[1:54:18] or is it just an anointing
[1:54:20] because it's got to be the indwelling of
[1:54:22] Jesus Christ and when that happens
[1:54:24] brothers and sisters it's not something
[1:54:25] that we're just poking at and saying you
[1:54:27] know I I think it it looks good and and
[1:54:30] maybe it's worked for some people but I
[1:54:31] just can't live it you know what no one
[1:54:33] can ever live it but if you ever get
[1:54:35] that life of Jesus Christ that lives
[1:54:36] inside of you it changes you from the
[1:54:38] inside out you become a new creature in
[1:54:41] Christ Jesus that's not a cunningly
[1:54:43] devised word it's not a poem it's not
[1:54:46] something that a man came up with that
[1:54:47] is the word of God
[1:54:49] you become a new creature in Christ
[1:54:52] Jesus
[1:54:57] that's exactly the truth he says I may
[1:54:59] not live to see it
[1:55:01] I believe I will
[1:55:03] but you young people remember that you
[1:55:05] heard a minister say that
[1:55:07] that'll finally wind up and that is the
[1:55:09] mark of the beast
[1:55:12] when she forms the World Council of
[1:55:14] churches
[1:55:16] and she'll give birth to her son the
[1:55:18] Antichrist
[1:55:19] that's why I can't believe anybody ever
[1:55:21] talking around the message of the hour
[1:55:22] about the vaccine being the mark of the
[1:55:24] beast or anything like that you hear the
[1:55:26] prophet of God what he says very clearly
[1:55:29] what the mark of the beast is if you
[1:55:30] reject the holy ghost in your life by
[1:55:32] just saying hey you know what I'm going
[1:55:33] to do it my way I'm not going to do it
[1:55:34] the way the word of God says the way the
[1:55:36] message of the hour says I'm just going
[1:55:37] to do it my way when you do that you
[1:55:39] reject the Holy Ghost it's that simple
[1:55:40] it's plain and simple maybe it's really
[1:55:43] too plain for some but I think it's
[1:55:45] coming to that place brothers and
[1:55:46] sisters we need to recognize it it's
[1:55:47] going to be so close it will deceive the
[1:55:49] very elected if it were possible what's
[1:55:50] going to happen if they come around and
[1:55:52] say hey if you believe any of this
[1:55:53] randomism then we're going to shut down
[1:55:55] your bank accounts you're not going to
[1:55:57] have a mortgage you're not going to have
[1:55:58] insurance for your cars you're not going
[1:56:00] to be able to work because your social
[1:56:01] insurance number won't work now you're
[1:56:03] going to be on the street as a bum are
[1:56:06] you going to reject it and say no I got
[1:56:07] to feed my family
[1:56:09] what if they say it to me and say no we
[1:56:11] you got to sign this paper that says
[1:56:13] that you'll accept same-sex marriages in
[1:56:16] your church and if you won't do that
[1:56:18] then you won't have a charitable
[1:56:19] organization anymore am I going to say
[1:56:21] oh you know what I'll just fudge that
[1:56:22] that's okay no one will ever know it'll
[1:56:24] be okay we'll keep the church open it'll
[1:56:26] keep going we've got to be able to make
[1:56:27] a stand somewhere along the way brothers
[1:56:29] and sisters we've got to be able to
[1:56:31] stand on the word of God and know that
[1:56:33] it's the truth for us and nobody will
[1:56:35] ever be able to take it away
[1:56:38] because remember we talked about it just
[1:56:40] like we saw with covid they shut it down
[1:56:43] right quick
[1:56:44] and we're not looking to be fanaticals
[1:56:46] to go out there and try and act like
[1:56:49] something's going on we're gonna live
[1:56:51] right right just the way that we're
[1:56:53] supposed to we're going to Render unto
[1:56:54] Caesar what's Caesar's but before that
[1:56:57] we're going to give God what's God's
[1:56:58] we're not going to let anybody tell us
[1:57:00] we can't give God what's God's
[1:57:05] but the random goes on to say in
[1:57:06] paragraph 170 the other is pregnated by
[1:57:08] the word of God and will bring forth the
[1:57:11] body the finished body of Jesus Christ
[1:57:14] which is the bride
[1:57:17] the finished body of Jesus Christ which
[1:57:20] is the bride
[1:57:22] how does she do that brothers and
[1:57:23] sisters she accepts that word in its
[1:57:26] fullness she receives it
[1:57:29] oh my I just I get so many thoughts
[1:57:32] coming to me and it just it just yeah it
[1:57:35] gets me so excited the other is pregnant
[1:57:37] by the word of God and will bring forth
[1:57:38] a body the finished body of Jesus Christ
[1:57:40] which is the bride the body of Christ
[1:57:43] isn't finished yet
[1:57:45] how many knows that
[1:57:47] such a tremendous statement right there
[1:57:50] because that means there's still some
[1:57:51] more people that need to come in
[1:57:53] and it's not just finished this business
[1:57:56] of saying us for and no more you know
[1:57:58] that that's not correct because until
[1:58:00] the Rapture he's still calling
[1:58:02] they're still people that are given
[1:58:04] Grace there's the 11th Hour workers the
[1:58:06] story of it and we know there's some
[1:58:08] people that got their nose out of joint
[1:58:09] because they've worked their entire
[1:58:11] lives their whole careers maybe served
[1:58:13] for the master and the vineyard all
[1:58:15] those times and all those ways they did
[1:58:17] so much for the kingdom and the body oh
[1:58:20] my and somebody comes in off the street
[1:58:21] a little rat that comes in and gets
[1:58:23] saved and suddenly they're just going to
[1:58:25] get the same reward that these people
[1:58:27] that have labored all along
[1:58:28] and we know that Jesus said so so so
[1:58:30] what's wrong friend didn't I agree to
[1:58:32] give you a a eternal life was wasn't
[1:58:35] that what we agreed upon wasn't that
[1:58:37] good and we know that he equates it to a
[1:58:39] value of a dollar
[1:58:41] but sometimes people do that he said he
[1:58:43] that that would be the case I just think
[1:58:46] this is beautiful the other is
[1:58:47] pregnanted by the word of God and will
[1:58:48] bring forth the body
[1:58:50] the finished body of Jesus Christ we've
[1:58:54] said it so many times wasn't there
[1:58:55] supposed to be a finished body of Jesus
[1:58:57] Christ that descends from heaven with a
[1:58:59] shout
[1:58:59] with a voice and the Trump of God we had
[1:59:03] a prophet in our day that he said the
[1:59:05] first two have already happened so how
[1:59:07] could they happen if he hadn't already
[1:59:08] descended brothers and sisters and we
[1:59:10] know that we get into the mysterious
[1:59:12] discussion of Revelations 10 1-7 where
[1:59:14] he put one foot on land and one foot on
[1:59:16] the sea raised one hand onto heaven with
[1:59:18] open book in his hand and said there
[1:59:19] shall be time no more and what that is
[1:59:21] representing is that there's time no
[1:59:23] more he has come down he has opened the
[1:59:25] word he has revealed the entire word to
[1:59:27] us and now those people who accept it
[1:59:29] become pregnated by that word and what
[1:59:32] happens when they're pregnanted by that
[1:59:34] word
[1:59:36] they have a little drink of water
[1:59:38] when they're pregnant by that word
[1:59:40] brothers and sisters there's something
[1:59:41] that grows inside of them
[1:59:43] we know that it's that mind that was in
[1:59:45] Christ Jesus it starts to grow in the
[1:59:48] heart of the believer in the very soul
[1:59:50] of the believer the body of Christ isn't
[1:59:52] finished yet how many knows that a man
[1:59:54] and woman is one
[1:59:56] we've talked about this so many times in
[1:59:58] Ephesians chapter five husbands in their
[2:00:00] positions wives in their positions
[2:00:02] Ephesians chapter 6 the children in
[2:00:04] their position but right at that little
[2:00:05] tiny bit at the back end of the
[2:00:07] Ephesians chapter five he says I speak
[2:00:09] to you concerning a mystery a great
[2:00:11] mystery about Christ and his church
[2:00:14] the bride will have to be the rest of
[2:00:17] that body and the two together makes
[2:00:20] them one body again
[2:00:23] like Adam was at the beginning man his
[2:00:26] wife are one now she the true bride so
[2:00:29] sold out to him that she used no mind of
[2:00:34] her own
[2:00:35] his mind of course is his will and his
[2:00:40] will is his word
[2:00:44] imagine if we experienced something with
[2:00:47] God where we had to say well I just
[2:00:48] don't know because you made a mistake
[2:00:50] over there and maybe you were misquoting
[2:00:52] stuff and maybe you're getting your own
[2:00:54] idea and maybe you're making yourself a
[2:00:56] little big in your own sight and now I
[2:00:58] just can't trust you God because the way
[2:01:00] things are the things that have happened
[2:01:02] in my life I just can't trust you
[2:01:03] according to your word your word is a
[2:01:05] little bit shaky to me now I'm saying
[2:01:07] what would happen we would say I've got
[2:01:09] to start thinking for myself I have to
[2:01:11] start the the reason in my own mind the
[2:01:14] critical thinking about God's word about
[2:01:16] everything that comes across the pulpit
[2:01:18] about everything that happens brothers
[2:01:19] and sisters when we truly get the
[2:01:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[2:01:22] we're just going to say Amen when we
[2:01:24] hear the word and you know what when we
[2:01:25] don't hear the word if we do hear an
[2:01:27] error with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:28] we're just going to say it's a pit and
[2:01:30] I'm just going to spit it out because I
[2:01:31] know most of that is truth
[2:01:34] we talked about it a while ago and
[2:01:36] somebody asked me for the quote brother
[2:01:37] Bradham says I would rather go to a
[2:01:39] church that preaches partial truth than
[2:01:41] not go to a church at all and I would go
[2:01:44] to that church and support them and
[2:01:46] potentially help change them until I
[2:01:48] actually had the opportunity to go to a
[2:01:50] church that preached the whole truth
[2:01:53] the business of staying home and not
[2:01:55] going to church I don't know
[2:01:57] just have to go with what the prophet
[2:01:58] said
[2:01:59] but you know what some people are going
[2:02:01] to get pregnant by that word brothers
[2:02:02] and sisters and that's really where we
[2:02:04] want to get to today some people truly
[2:02:06] are being pregnated by that word and
[2:02:08] that might sound a little coarse but you
[2:02:10] know what it's true
[2:02:12] it's true It Happened One Time
[2:02:15] spiritually didn't it
[2:02:17] Eve
[2:02:19] she was created
[2:02:21] in the image of God wasn't she
[2:02:23] because God created Adam
[2:02:27] and then he created both Adam and Eve
[2:02:31] male and female created he them
[2:02:34] and we know that they were two in one he
[2:02:38] hadn't split them apart yet that first
[2:02:40] operation had never been performed
[2:02:43] Eve was created
[2:02:45] to be pregnated by the word
[2:02:47] she wasn't created to be pregnated by
[2:02:50] man
[2:02:51] but we know when Satan got into the mix
[2:02:53] what happened
[2:02:55] that changed everything that was the
[2:02:57] fall of mankind
[2:02:59] she began to create on her own Adam and
[2:03:02] Eve began to be creators and that's why
[2:03:06] it's so important for us as parents to
[2:03:08] recognize we're creators
[2:03:11] we have the power of creation
[2:03:14] and I I was blown away when I heard that
[2:03:17] the first time but brothers and sisters
[2:03:18] it's true she was
[2:03:21] she was completely safe with Adam though
[2:03:23] wasn't she when she was in Adam Satan
[2:03:25] couldn't even get to her because if
[2:03:27] Satan came and tried to talk to Eve he
[2:03:30] would have to talk to her
[2:03:31] through Adam
[2:03:33] because Satan wouldn't be talking to Eve
[2:03:35] he'd be talking to Adam he'd be speaking
[2:03:37] to Adam
[2:03:39] because Eve was in him but when she
[2:03:41] became separated from him that's when it
[2:03:44] became treacherous isn't it
[2:03:46] because she began to reason she began to
[2:03:48] have her own critical thinking she began
[2:03:51] to think her own thoughts and when that
[2:03:54] happened Satan slipped in and got one
[2:03:56] word off one word off and caused the
[2:03:59] fall of mankind
[2:04:01] you know we could say whether it was an
[2:04:03] apple or an apricot whatever it was
[2:04:06] that spoken word that she heard it
[2:04:10] became a thought
[2:04:12] you know
[2:04:13] it was one word off you shall surely not
[2:04:17] die
[2:04:18] you can you can eat of every tree in
[2:04:20] here and you will certainly not die just
[2:04:22] one word not right and what happened
[2:04:25] that word
[2:04:27] impregnated her
[2:04:29] and it pregnated her spiritually
[2:04:32] because that word became a thought
[2:04:35] and that thought became expressed
[2:04:38] in her life right
[2:04:40] and because of that and we can say you
[2:04:42] know whether some people would say I'm
[2:04:44] just saying it this way for the people
[2:04:46] who might be tuning in some people would
[2:04:47] say maybe she had a a a relation act
[2:04:50] with that that serpent in the garden or
[2:04:52] or whether she ate an apricot we could
[2:04:54] go down a rabbit hole of discussion
[2:04:56] about that but let's just push that
[2:04:57] discussion aside for a second and just
[2:04:59] simply say it this way she disobeyed
[2:05:01] God's word
[2:05:03] if we disobey God's word we're going to
[2:05:06] get repercussions
[2:05:07] just like she did
[2:05:10] whether it's an apple or an apricot or
[2:05:12] whatever it was it was the word that was
[2:05:14] spoke to her that became a thought that
[2:05:16] she acted on that's why we've got to be
[2:05:19] so careful with the words that we speak
[2:05:21] and the thoughts that we take in
[2:05:26] when that thought became accepted in Eve
[2:05:29] it caused a pregnation
[2:05:31] before she became pregnant because she
[2:05:34] acted on it that word changed something
[2:05:36] inside of her she no longer said wow I
[2:05:40] just believe everything my husband says
[2:05:42] and I won't take one step out from what
[2:05:44] he says
[2:05:45] she took that reasoning from what her
[2:05:47] husband had given her as the word
[2:05:50] because we know that God came and he
[2:05:52] told Adam you can eat from any tree in
[2:05:54] the garden but just don't eat from that
[2:05:55] tree
[2:05:57] of knowledge of Good and Evil right
[2:06:00] you can eat from the Tree of Life but
[2:06:02] don't touch that other one
[2:06:03] that other one's going to cause death
[2:06:06] he didn't come until Eve
[2:06:09] make sure Adam that you tell Eve that he
[2:06:11] told Adam that
[2:06:12] and she received the instruction from
[2:06:15] her husband
[2:06:17] but somewhere along the way the devil
[2:06:19] got in and caused her to just go one
[2:06:21] word off of what her husband's
[2:06:22] instructions were that's why brothers
[2:06:24] and sisters I'll tell you what for
[2:06:25] myself when I look at this the magnitude
[2:06:27] of this I hope it's coming across the
[2:06:29] way that I've been thinking about it and
[2:06:30] feeling about it the way the Lord's been
[2:06:31] reviewing it puts such a tremendous
[2:06:34] amount of responsibility on the husbands
[2:06:36] to make sure that we are truly living
[2:06:38] according to the word of God because if
[2:06:40] our wives are going to start doubting us
[2:06:42] and our wives are going to start
[2:06:43] reasoning on their own Brothers we're in
[2:06:45] trouble
[2:06:50] as long as Eve was in her husband she
[2:06:52] was totally safe but as soon as she
[2:06:53] stepped out and just began exploring the
[2:06:56] reasoning on her own that's when Satan
[2:06:57] got her
[2:07:00] and because she fell Adam fell because
[2:07:03] Adam knew that she was a part of him
[2:07:06] he couldn't let her go
[2:07:07] just like Christ couldn't let his bride
[2:07:09] go and isn't it wonderful brothers and
[2:07:11] sisters to recognize that as Adam
[2:07:13] stepped out and said I know as a Son of
[2:07:15] God I'm forfeiting all of my rights to
[2:07:18] eternal life but I love her so much I'm
[2:07:20] just gonna go right after her and I'm
[2:07:22] gonna I'm gonna make sure that I seal
[2:07:24] the deal and she's going to be my bride
[2:07:26] my wife I am not going to let anyone
[2:07:28] else pregnant her and he went with her
[2:07:31] and you know what Christ has done the
[2:07:34] same thing with us today brothers and
[2:07:35] sisters he's given us a word today to be
[2:07:39] pregnated by my goodness and you know
[2:07:42] what when that happens
[2:07:44] changes everything
[2:07:46] and we know that God wasn't surprised in
[2:07:48] Genesis 3 and 9 when he came down into
[2:07:50] the garden and said Adam Where Art Thou
[2:07:52] sometimes it's it's worded in such a way
[2:07:54] that God was wandering through the
[2:07:56] Garden of Eden the cool of the evening
[2:07:58] crying out Adam where are you you're
[2:08:01] lost I can't find you is God he knew
[2:08:03] exactly where he was and he was
[2:08:05] declaring to Adam do you know where you
[2:08:07] are Adam
[2:08:09] do you know where you've Fallen to Adam
[2:08:11] and he came and had the discussion with
[2:08:13] him
[2:08:14] and he explained it to him
[2:08:17] I just want to say this today brothers
[2:08:18] and sisters just get behind God's word
[2:08:21] don't don't don't don't start to reason
[2:08:23] God's word out in our own minds because
[2:08:25] we'll never be able to do it because his
[2:08:27] word says that his thoughts are not our
[2:08:28] thoughts and neither his ways our ways
[2:08:30] it's it's totally different than what we
[2:08:32] think that's why we're told to get the
[2:08:34] mind of Christ in us you know there was
[2:08:36] another one who actually got pregnant by
[2:08:38] the word we've heard this before I'm
[2:08:40] going to start speeding up for time's
[2:08:41] sake here but in Luke chapter one let's
[2:08:44] just turn here well we still have a few
[2:08:46] minutes Luke chapter one
[2:08:53] very very familiar scripture
[2:09:02] to start reading with verse 28.
[2:09:07] story of Mary and the angel Gabriel
[2:09:10] coming to visit her
[2:09:13] the angel came unto her and said hail
[2:09:16] thou that art highly favored the Lord is
[2:09:19] with thee blessed art thou among women
[2:09:24] I just I'll go on here sorry before I
[2:09:27] start talking and when she saw him she
[2:09:29] was troubled at his saying and cast in
[2:09:32] her mind what manner of salutation this
[2:09:35] should be
[2:09:36] the angel said unto her fear not Mary
[2:09:39] for thou Hast found favor with God
[2:09:41] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[2:09:44] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[2:09:46] call his name Jesus he shall be great
[2:09:48] and shall be called the son of the
[2:09:50] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[2:09:52] him the Throne of his father David and
[2:09:54] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[2:09:56] forever and all of his kingdom there
[2:09:59] shall be no end
[2:10:01] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[2:10:05] this be seeing I know not a man and the
[2:10:07] angel answered and said unto her the
[2:10:09] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[2:10:13] power of the highest
[2:10:15] shall overshadow thee
[2:10:17] therefore also
[2:10:19] that Holy thing which shall be born of
[2:10:21] thee shall be called The Son of God and
[2:10:23] behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath
[2:10:25] also conceived
[2:10:27] a son in her old age and this is the
[2:10:29] sixth month with her who was called
[2:10:30] Barren for with God nothing shall be
[2:10:34] impossible and Mary said behold the
[2:10:37] handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[2:10:39] according to Thy Word
[2:10:42] and the angel departed from her
[2:10:45] we know that this is the key part of
[2:10:47] this Mary said behold the handmaid of
[2:10:50] the Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[2:10:51] word I just can't help but take this
[2:10:54] brothers and sisters and type it to the
[2:10:55] angel messenger of our day we have had
[2:10:59] an angel messenger come and say hail
[2:11:01] thou
[2:11:03] highly favored among women
[2:11:08] behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[2:11:12] and bring forth the son and shall call
[2:11:14] his name Jesus
[2:11:17] you know the natural types of spiritual
[2:11:19] we've talked about this so many times we
[2:11:21] know it that's what we hear in the
[2:11:22] message of the hour if you do not accept
[2:11:24] the word of God for your day you're not
[2:11:28] going to get a spiritual conception in
[2:11:31] your spiritual womb brothers and sisters
[2:11:33] and what's it going to do it's not going
[2:11:35] to bring forth another man-child like
[2:11:37] Jesus Christ called Jesus Christ that's
[2:11:40] not what I'm saying I'm talking
[2:11:41] spiritually speaking we have got to get
[2:11:43] pregnated by the word of God and when we
[2:11:46] do the power of the highest the same
[2:11:49] holy ghost that visited Mary here
[2:11:51] actually Came Upon her and caused a
[2:11:55] birth to happen and what we're talking
[2:11:57] about today is that new birth brothers
[2:11:59] and sisters we've got to get that New
[2:12:01] Birth the only way we're going to get
[2:12:03] that New Birth is according to the word
[2:12:05] of God unless we get pregnated by some
[2:12:07] sort of other teaching some sort of
[2:12:09] denominational teaching if we do that
[2:12:11] then we're going to have a
[2:12:12] denominational birth brother Bradham
[2:12:14] says it very clearly we can have a new
[2:12:16] Baptist we can have Revenue Presbyterian
[2:12:18] we can have a new Pentecostal we can
[2:12:20] have a new non-denominational and we can
[2:12:23] go even farther and say we could have
[2:12:24] another message believer but do you
[2:12:27] believe the message of the hour do you
[2:12:29] have Christ of the message in your life
[2:12:32] if the power of the highest overshadows
[2:12:34] us brothers and sisters there is going
[2:12:36] to be a thing that shall be born inside
[2:12:39] of us we become new creatures in Christ
[2:12:41] Jesus then
[2:12:42] it's not going to be a physical birth
[2:12:43] it's going to be a new birth
[2:12:45] where we become a new creature in Christ
[2:12:47] Jesus
[2:12:50] but you know what had to happen before
[2:12:52] this
[2:12:53] we still have 10 minutes I think it's so
[2:12:55] beautiful in in this in this scripture
[2:12:58] here in Luke it's just so beautiful if
[2:13:00] you just flip a page back in Luke just
[2:13:04] to actually bring it forward to to to
[2:13:07] show how the natural types the spiritual
[2:13:09] where we're at today brothers and
[2:13:10] sisters in Luke 1 15 to 17.
[2:13:14] we're talking about how this had to
[2:13:16] happen first
[2:13:17] there had to be someone that came to
[2:13:19] prepare the way of the Lord first right
[2:13:22] for he shall be great in the sight of
[2:13:24] the Lord and shall drink neither wide
[2:13:26] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[2:13:28] with the Holy Ghost
[2:13:30] same holy ghost that happened to Mary
[2:13:33] there in the womb
[2:13:35] and many of the children of Israel shall
[2:13:38] he turn to the Lord their God and he
[2:13:39] shall go before him and the spirit and
[2:13:41] power of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[2:13:43] fathers to the children and the
[2:13:44] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[2:13:46] make ready a people prepared for the
[2:13:49] Lord
[2:13:50] what we're talking about here is this
[2:13:52] Elijah anointing
[2:13:53] and we know there's a five comings of
[2:13:56] the spirit of Elijah I'm not here to
[2:13:58] name them all I just want to get to one
[2:14:00] thing brothers and sisters this Elijah
[2:14:02] anointing is supposed to happen
[2:14:03] according to the word of God and what
[2:14:05] happened was this spiritual anointing
[2:14:07] came at the same time the New Birth was
[2:14:10] coming the same time the message of the
[2:14:12] hour happened to Mary the same thing was
[2:14:15] going on in parallel in her cousin but
[2:14:19] this one was born just a little bit
[2:14:21] sooner so that he could prepare the way
[2:14:23] of the Lord there has to be a
[2:14:25] preparation made for the Lord to come
[2:14:28] for that body to happen
[2:14:31] the Elijah anointing was to turn the
[2:14:32] hearts of the fathers to the children
[2:14:34] the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[2:14:36] just to make ready of people prepared
[2:14:38] for the Lord and we know that that
[2:14:39] completely dovetails with Malachi 4 5
[2:14:43] and 6. behold I will send you Elijah the
[2:14:46] prophet
[2:14:48] so I want to say brothers and sisters
[2:14:49] this is a this is a statement in the
[2:14:52] word of God that says behold I will send
[2:14:54] you Elijah the prophet so when is that
[2:14:57] going to happen
[2:14:58] when is Elijah the prophet gonna happen
[2:15:01] I know why it's completely silent
[2:15:02] because we know it's already happened
[2:15:04] Elijah the prophets already come he's
[2:15:07] already prepared
[2:15:09] the way of the Lord
[2:15:11] behold I will send you Elijah the
[2:15:12] prophet before the coming of the great
[2:15:14] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[2:15:15] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[2:15:17] the children and the Heart of the
[2:15:19] children to their fathers lest I come
[2:15:21] and smite the Earth with a curse we know
[2:15:23] this is a very familiar scripture but
[2:15:25] it's exactly in line with chapter with
[2:15:28] Luke here chapter one
[2:15:30] before Jesus could be born in the womb
[2:15:34] of Mary there had to be one come to
[2:15:37] prepare the way for that to happen
[2:15:40] and we know that she said amen to the
[2:15:42] angel and and that gave her the ability
[2:15:44] to receive the Holy Ghost it's got to be
[2:15:46] the same way for us that doesn't change
[2:15:47] the fact that there's still an Elijah
[2:15:49] anointing that has to come before we can
[2:15:51] receive this word the Elijah anointing
[2:15:53] is the one that presents it to us that
[2:15:55] prepares the way of the Lord that's what
[2:15:57] preparing the way of the Lord is is
[2:15:59] showing the word of God for our day
[2:16:03] brothers and sisters he's as immutable
[2:16:05] in his nature as he and it is in his
[2:16:07] ways he's not going to come and do
[2:16:09] something one way one day and do
[2:16:11] something totally different outside of
[2:16:12] his word the other way it's going to be
[2:16:14] exactly according to his word
[2:16:18] just like there has to be Apostolic
[2:16:20] fathers there has to be new birth
[2:16:22] children
[2:16:23] and and you know when we look at it in
[2:16:25] that light doesn't it make it so easy to
[2:16:27] say I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[2:16:30] of them I recognize my position it
[2:16:33] doesn't make it a belaboring song where
[2:16:35] we yawn oh I'm so glad that I can say
[2:16:39] I'm one of them you know the song leader
[2:16:42] singing that song again you know what
[2:16:43] the song Leader's got nothing to do with
[2:16:45] your worship here we go down a different
[2:16:48] direction he's got nothing to do with
[2:16:49] your worship and I would say this
[2:16:51] brothers and sisters the instruments got
[2:16:52] nothing to do with your worship if
[2:16:54] they're grating on your skin it's
[2:16:56] because God's allowing it to see what
[2:16:58] you're going to do about it are they
[2:16:59] going to stop you from praising what
[2:17:01] he's done for you
[2:17:03] is anybody going to get in the way of
[2:17:05] your relationship with God
[2:17:08] my goodness when we've received the
[2:17:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost that new life
[2:17:12] that comes inside of us it changes us
[2:17:15] from the inside out we can't help it
[2:17:17] anymore
[2:17:20] he's not gonna say oh it was too fast oh
[2:17:23] don't worry you didn't worship me that
[2:17:25] day that's okay don't worry about it I I
[2:17:27] didn't want it anyways or it was too too
[2:17:30] slow or it was too loud or it was too
[2:17:33] soft or whatever it is brothers and
[2:17:35] sisters we've been given the ability to
[2:17:37] worship because we recognize what he's
[2:17:39] done for us
[2:17:41] when we recognize that it makes it so
[2:17:43] easy to worship
[2:17:44] when we recognize that his word says
[2:17:46] that if if we can believe then we and
[2:17:48] our families can be saved we just need
[2:17:50] to apply the token when the prophet in
[2:17:52] our day said if your children aren't
[2:17:54] serving God just keep applying the token
[2:17:56] just keep praying for them and they will
[2:17:58] be saved
[2:18:01] we've got every reason in the world to
[2:18:03] worship
[2:18:05] to recognize that we have the ability to
[2:18:07] hear this word of God for our day oh my
[2:18:10] goodness
[2:18:12] there has to be Apostolic fathers there
[2:18:15] has to be new birth children
[2:18:17] oh we were talking a little while ago
[2:18:19] about some people that that just were
[2:18:22] able to worship so freely and and how
[2:18:25] wonderful it is to get in that
[2:18:26] atmosphere when everyone is worshiping
[2:18:29] and no one cares about what's going on
[2:18:31] around you when that happens brothers
[2:18:33] and sisters it changes the atmosphere
[2:18:35] and you know what the prophet of God
[2:18:38] said that's where we're bound to hear
[2:18:39] from heaven and why do we gather
[2:18:40] together on a Sunday not to hear a
[2:18:43] brother preach not to just hear quotes
[2:18:46] I I strongly hope that that that with
[2:18:49] all of our hearts that we gather
[2:18:51] together to fellowship with the Lord
[2:18:53] to hear from our theophonies to change
[2:18:56] our bodies to give us the strength we
[2:18:58] need from day to day
[2:19:01] we have to be turned back to something
[2:19:02] and that's the faith of the Pentecostal
[2:19:04] fathers
[2:19:06] isn't that wonderful many times we can
[2:19:08] hear that and say well the the faith of
[2:19:10] the Pentecostal fathers is that Azusa
[2:19:12] Street no it's not
[2:19:13] no it's not that was a type of the Holy
[2:19:16] Ghost outpouring sure enough I won't
[2:19:18] deny that for a second but what we want
[2:19:20] to do is go right back to the
[2:19:21] Pentecostal experience back in the upper
[2:19:23] room where they came out they stumbled
[2:19:25] out like drunk people in the streets and
[2:19:28] Joel or Peter he stood up and said this
[2:19:31] is what the prophet Joel had to say this
[2:19:33] is that that they spoke about he told
[2:19:35] that this would happen I'll pour out my
[2:19:37] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[2:19:40] daughters shall prophesy
[2:19:42] back to the faith of the Pentecostal
[2:19:45] fathers not a denominational Azusa
[2:19:47] Street but back to the upper room even
[2:19:50] though Mary gave natural birth to Jesus
[2:19:54] Christ remember brothers and sisters she
[2:19:56] had to go in that upper room also she
[2:19:58] had to have the new birth experience too
[2:20:00] we all have to have that experience and
[2:20:03] brother Bradham says it very clearly
[2:20:05] that if you've ever seen a birth it's
[2:20:07] messy
[2:20:08] if you've never had a new birth I want
[2:20:10] to recommend that you have one
[2:20:12] search until you get it ask the Lord
[2:20:14] Jesus Christ give me that new birth
[2:20:18] he'll give it to you
[2:20:21] if you want it
[2:20:24] but even though Mary gave birth
[2:20:25] naturally to the man Jesus she had to be
[2:20:28] there
[2:20:29] to receive her baptism
[2:20:31] just like all the rest of them
[2:20:34] just like all of us
[2:20:36] because the
[2:20:38] Spirit of Elijah came
[2:20:40] didn't he in that day and he said I I've
[2:20:43] come I'm the voice of one cried in the
[2:20:45] wilderness when they said who are you
[2:20:46] are you the prophet are you the Messiah
[2:20:48] who are you who are you I'm just one
[2:20:51] crying in the wilderness prepare ye the
[2:20:53] way of the Lord and we know that our day
[2:20:55] we had a light come down over top of the
[2:20:58] Ohio River when he was baptizing was it
[2:21:00] his 17th person that day and what
[2:21:03] happened that that same Spirit came and
[2:21:06] spoke to him and said just as John the
[2:21:09] Baptist was sent to forerun the first
[2:21:10] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so you
[2:21:13] and your ministry will forerun the
[2:21:16] second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:21:18] and we read it earlier today brothers
[2:21:20] and sisters what is the second coming of
[2:21:22] the Lord Jesus Christ it's a word coming
[2:21:24] of Jesus and when the word gets in the
[2:21:27] bride when she accepts that word and
[2:21:29] accepts it into her spiritual womb and
[2:21:31] starts to have a new birth experience we
[2:21:34] become that body of Jesus Christ here on
[2:21:37] Earth we begin to complete that body and
[2:21:40] you know there's still more to come
[2:21:43] I want to say it until he takes us away
[2:21:45] there's still more to come
[2:21:46] the ministry that says us for no more
[2:21:49] you know you know there's problems there
[2:21:51] just leave it alone still shake their
[2:21:53] hands and say God bless you still
[2:21:54] fellowship with them don't ever turn
[2:21:56] your back on anyone that's a doctrine of
[2:21:58] a devil to say that I've got to build a
[2:22:00] camp and we can't fellowship with them
[2:22:02] people over there because they don't
[2:22:03] Fellowship here that's a doctrine of a
[2:22:06] devil don't believe it for a second
[2:22:08] that's exactly what Satan wants you're
[2:22:10] giving Satan a day off when you do that
[2:22:14] even the people in denominations because
[2:22:15] brother Bradham he said it I would say
[2:22:18] God said it through brother Bradham that
[2:22:20] God has people in every denomination
[2:22:21] doesn't he
[2:22:23] so how could that be that we count
[2:22:24] fellowship with the Pentecostal people
[2:22:26] or or the fullness people or the Oneness
[2:22:28] people or the whoever people why can't
[2:22:30] we fellowship with every single person
[2:22:32] and talk about Jesus Christ because the
[2:22:34] prophet of God said it that when we talk
[2:22:35] about Jesus Christ what happens he comes
[2:22:38] on the sea we invite him on the scene
[2:22:41] because the spirit of Prophecy is when
[2:22:44] you speak Jesus Christ
[2:22:45] [Music]
[2:22:48] my goodness we've been given the ability
[2:22:50] to come back to this new birth
[2:22:51] experience I'll call the musicians as we
[2:22:53] start to close today brothers and
[2:22:55] sisters I just want to encourage us to
[2:22:57] receive the new birth and the only way
[2:22:58] we're going to get the new birth is by
[2:23:00] the word for our day and it's got to be
[2:23:02] the word that was delivered to the
[2:23:04] Saints through the messenger of the age
[2:23:07] and you know I just want to say it this
[2:23:10] way just take a look at what he said
[2:23:12] don't take Google's response for it
[2:23:15] because I would say this we all know
[2:23:17] this but for those people who are maybe
[2:23:18] questioning it and have have discussion
[2:23:21] about it is everything that you see on
[2:23:23] Google true
[2:23:25] that's one word answer not not an
[2:23:27] explanation or a discussion either yes
[2:23:30] or no is everything on Google true I'll
[2:23:32] just leave it with you
[2:23:34] because if it's not then then how can
[2:23:37] you just take that as your answer
[2:23:40] I think we've all experienced it enough
[2:23:42] we know that we need to investigate a
[2:23:44] little further when we want to know
[2:23:45] something and we've learned to take the
[2:23:47] law of averages we'll take the majority
[2:23:49] of what we see on Google
[2:23:51] but I want to say this brothers and
[2:23:53] sisters maybe stand with me as we close
[2:23:58] once again I got a whole bunch to say
[2:24:00] but you know what it's just so beautiful
[2:24:01] that woman that was at the well she
[2:24:03] didn't go in run into the City and say
[2:24:05] let's get the textbooks out and let's
[2:24:07] examine to see if this guy that is up
[2:24:09] there on the hill says that he is the
[2:24:11] Messiah let's examine it to see whether
[2:24:13] he's the one let's get everyone's
[2:24:15] popular opinion and determine whether
[2:24:17] this is the case or not she said come
[2:24:19] and see a man who told me the things
[2:24:21] that I've done she had an experience
[2:24:24] herself and that gave her the ability to
[2:24:26] offer that that that testimony of Christ

[2:24:32] brothers and sisters is the spirit of
[2:24:34] Prophecy if you want to be prophetic
[2:24:37] testify Jesus Christ to this world
[2:24:40] speak the name of Jesus to the world
[2:24:42] around you and see if people don't
[2:24:44] respond let's just bow in prayer
[2:24:48] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[2:24:50] you for your word Lord thank you for the
[2:24:52] ability to hear what the spirit has to
[2:24:55] say to the church today Father we don't
[2:24:57] want a word for yesterday and we don't
[2:24:59] want a word for tomorrow we want the
[2:25:01] word for right now in this moment Lord
[2:25:03] Jesus and we know that you haven't left
[2:25:06] us high and dry you have not abandoned

[2:25:15] father we pray that Lord you would help
[2:25:17] us to not look forwards or Look
[2:25:19] Backwards Lord but to just accept you as
[2:25:22] you are today Father accept the
[2:25:24] provision that you've given to us today
[2:25:26] in every single aspect of it Lord Jesus

[2:25:37] happened to us that have hurt us or or
[2:25:39] things that we long for in the future
