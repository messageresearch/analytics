your prophet stood in the gap for for us Lord Jesus and we know that that place is what you provided for us in this age and father we thank you for that tonight we thank you for your goodness to us Lord Jesus every single day of Our Lives Lord father from the moment we wake up to the time we go down and all the way in between father in the night and in the day father is a gift from you to be on this side of Eternity father and Lord while we're here we pray that you would just help us to be about your business father we know that you said very clearly how will the world know that you love me

tonight father we would say that truly we heard from you we just Commit This service now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you thank you musicians certainly wonderful to have musicians play the way these ones do with the dedication they do you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to go back to Ephesians chapter 5. I'd like to maybe take a look back at some of the things we spoke about in 2022 and maybe just push forwards a little ways in 2023 understanding that although we're talking about this in a a natural sort of a setting husbands and wives and children we want to look at it from a spiritual standpoint according to the message of the hour from a bride's standpoint from a wife's perspective Ephesians chapter 5 first scripture I like to start with is verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God if we can't do that then all the rest of it is for naught submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so what men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nonetheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord I pray that as a wife we could reverence our husbands father it's so easy to put that off on a woman then that applies to us father help us to take this word tonight and ingest it father Lord Jesus that we would become it father we love you we thank you we ask that you would bless this word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly thankful to be back in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday we have a prayer meeting tomorrow evening we have the February calendar coming out this week as well it's going to be a busy month and we have a few few things coming up that I think is going to be really good one of the things that we're working on I'll just let everybody know um is gym night we have gym night coming up and we're working on getting that back into the program not the program wrong word into the assembly and we just want to create an environment where we can get together and have a little fun I know a lot of the brothers like to play basketball and the younger kids like to just run around and rip it up and it's a lot of fun so we haven't done it since covet I believe is that right that's a long time so sister Shelley has been investigating for us and I think that we have uh landed on something but we'll confirm that and we'll put it in the calendar when the time is right so you can look forward to that one of the other things I wanted to put out there as well is uh I'm going to do something a little bit different this year and usually um for Easter we'll just have a regular Easter meeting and maybe if we do something special we'll have a guest Minister come in and do that sort of thing but this year we're going to attempt to do something that we haven't done and that is to have a little bit of a Revival and some people might be into it some people might not be I don't want to put too much pressure on anybody but one thing I do know is when you have a series of meetings what happens is there's a climax meeting and the reason for that is because everyone has come and spent the time to be in church and usually if you have a Saturday evening meeting and then you have a Sunday morning meeting that Sunday morning meeting is usually a pretty good meeting because everybody has been gathered together thinking the same thoughts being in one mind and one Accord and so um I believe we've gotten a mission field right here in Calgary it's kind of been my burden for a long time and haven't really been able to put it together in my mind but I believe the Lord's leading me so we're going to have Easter meetings here and uh we'll just see what the Lord has in store so we're working on getting all the uh things figured out and we're not going to have a minister come in from abroad we're going to use the ministry that is in our midst we have some tremendous gifts in the body that we want to give the opportunity to preach and what has been on my heart is simply this brothers and sisters we don't want to grow our church to have a great number of people what we want to do is find that lost last rainbow trout that one soul that God is looking for and the only way he's going to find it is through the body birth and life comes through the body healing comes through the body and so it takes every one of us to be missionaries in our own backyards in our own Fields brother Branham talks about it he says you know we can have the desire to go abroad and into foreign lands in different countries and Minister the gospel but do what does our mailman know what we believe do our neighbors know what we believe do the people around us no we've got a tremendous Mission field and honestly we live in a city of one point whatever million people and there's one and a half churches in Calgary I don't know maybe there's two churches in Calgary and an assembly in Airdrie I don't know how many message churches there really are in Calgary maybe somebody knows that exact answer and we could talk about that but you know when you look at places like Edmonton they have the same sort of number of people but yet there's a couple or three or four maybe even five big Assemblies of people that believe the message of the hour so I don't know what the Lord has in store in Calgary I believe there's people in Calgary that know the message of the hour and just don't know where to Fellowship so anyways we'll just see what the Lord has in store I believe we can have some wonderful Easter meetings so what we're planning and I know everybody I'm glad you're seated maybe we should have the oxygen masks come down and everybody just have a breath what we're going to do is start on Wednesday night we're gonna go Thursday night Friday night Saturday night and we'll end with the Sunday service as well so it's going to be a busy week but I think that something wonderful can happen when we just focus on the Lord and we just have our minds focused on one thing and and my thought was you know if we could just invite that one person that we've thought about witnessing to over the years there's just one person that we just keep talking to and thinking you know I believe there's something special about that person if we just mention that one person you know come and see a man that told me the things that I've done and just see what could happen we never know so anyways um that's coming up in April at the beginning of April we're going to have a formal announcement coming but I just couldn't wait to announce it so here we are um talking about Ephesians Ephesians chapter five you know we we go right back to Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21. we we can talk about the the roles of wives and and the roles of husbands and the roles of children and there's so many different things that we've covered over I guess the the services where we've talked about this but tonight I want to talk about submission and understanding that you know we have said that some not everybody can be a husband not everybody can be a wife but we're all children but we're also all claiming to be the Bride of Jesus Christ Living in the bright age so I believe all of this discussion about wives submitting yourselves to your husband is actually applicable to the men it's applicable to the women it's applicable to the children it's very applicable to the lives of the Believers and welcome home brother Mervin and sister Faye I just have to take a moment and and tell you that they were so kind to us they looked after us in a tremendous way thank you [Applause] I believe they had an itinerary set up for uh services and visiting people and the last week when Lisa was so ill they just did everything they could to try and accommodate us and and make Lisa as comfortable as she possibly could be and rearrange things and the schedule just did everything and uh certainly know that you guys sacrifice for us and we thank you for that I just would like to uh invite anybody if you have the opportunity to go and visit someone from the congregations people in the land that they come from I highly recommend it I've done it twice with brother Gilbert in Kenya did it once in the Philippines and uh there's something special about going to meet the Believers and and the people of the people that we fellowship with here it's very powerful it does something really special for everyone I'm sure but uh I've asked brother Mervin as I said last week I'm not going to try and do a presentation because I don't think I could even come close to what brother Mervin could do so I've asked him if he would take the service on Wednesday next week and give a formal presentation of what happened in Philippines before we got there and then maybe when we got there and just talk about it so God bless you thank you so much it was a real honor and privilege to be there with you talking about our scripture tonight um understanding that you know Jesus in this scripture here speaking we know that it was Paul speaking to Ephesians church but verse 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word what he's talking about is is sanctifying and cleansing the church with the washing of the Water by the word and I'd like to just sort of dwell on that tonight what word is that it's the word of the Lord the word that's given to us in the age in which we live in we can say as many people do say well it's the word of God it's the King James version It's The New International Version maybe it's the Amplified version it's it's some of the versions of the Bible but you know we're not talking to the general masses tonight we're talking to the Bride of Jesus Christ who's living in the bride age so tonight when we talk about this we're talking about the word that he is talking about here that he might sanctify and cleanse it with a washing of the Water by the word that's the word of the Vindicated Prophet because as we talked about on Wednesday if you hearken to his voice and listen to my word then you will receive the blessing that I have in store for you but that word that comes forward from a Vindicated Prophet is not just a word of a man that word is the word of God and some people can receive that and some people can't and we know we're not talking to the cats tonight we're talking to the people that can and so I think it's just a wonderful thing to to recognize that he wanted to sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word of the Vindicated prophet in the age in which they live in that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot a wrinkle or any such thing that it should be holy and without blemish so there's nothing that we can do brothers and sisters except for receive that word because that word is what's going to sanctify us so then he will present us to himself as a glorious church not having any spot or wrinkle remember the Prophet this one that that the voice of God spoke through to this age he gave that that Vision that said that there was the preview of the bride and how he saw that church come forward and it was Miss USA say the Church of the United States and and he said oh Lord have mercy all that we have preached for all of the work that we've done over all of the years and this is what it's come to and we know that it was a naked woman a witch brother Branham said dancing to the beat of rock and roll and brothers and sisters I'm not putting off on anybody but you don't have to look very far to see the beat of rock and roll inside a church today you look at most churches and there's the beat of rock and roll that's why we need to temper the music that we have in the church that's why we need to say that if you're going to play an instrument in the church you're not going to play it unless your Holy Ghost filled sorry you have got to have the Holy Ghost otherwise you have another ghost and you're playing music for that ghost remember brother Bradham says it very clearly that many people many people think they're worshiping God it's harsh it's a terrible statement but they're coming to church and worshiping thinking they're worshiping God but they're worshiping Satan he's going to sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by his word that he might present it to himself a glorious Church and I want to say a glorious bride not having spot a wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish and it's interesting when we read this because brother Bradham he says that I'm going to keep saying it over and over again he says that when the when when the church recognizes what it is when she recognizes her position when it recognizes its position but that it should be holy and without blemish and how how does that happen by being washed in the water of the word by by dressing herself in his word not in her righteousness her righteousness is but filthy rags before him we know that so as we go forwards in Ephesians getting into Ephesians Chapter 30 Ephesians chapter 5 verse 32. he says this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church but then he goes back to nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself see that the wife that she reverence her husband how does the wife reverence her husband by reverencing his word when he speaks she says okay okay honey and she doesn't challenge him now some people would say brother Barry you're making her a doormat she he can just say whatever he wants to but remember he is going to sanctify her and cleanse her by the washing of the Water by the word so he's only going to live according to the word that's the commitment that he's making is to live according to the word and we know that we can't live not according to the word at home but according to the word at church because we were talking to the boys about this how sometimes people can behave in different ways at home and different ways at church and I say Lord have mercy on me let me have the same face that I have at church at home because the word of God says that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways we want to make sure that we don't have two faces we've got one face and that face is Christ that we represent to our family to our brothers and our sisters but this is a great mystery I speak concerning Christ and the church now this is where we get into kind of what I want to talk about tonight I think it's so good we're probably going to dwell on this for a little while as we go forwards into um the new year so I hope it's okay we'll just see what the Lord has in store with it over in Titus we talked about this last year and Titus Chapter 2 if you want to turn there tonight maybe we can just sort of recap I don't want to take too long covering all the scriptures that we talked about but I just think there's so much to it you know my Bible it says in the in the margin sound Doctrine above chapter 2. and we know chapter 2 verse 1 says but speak thou the things which become sound Doctrine talk about these things speak them that the Aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity and patience I really want to get into that as we go forwards as well there's some really important things that the men have laid out in the word for them to be and and there's things that the women have laid out in the word for them to be verse 3 that the Aged woman likewise that they be in Behavior has becometh Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young woman to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed young men also young men likewise sorry exhort to be sober minded in all things showing thyself a pattern of Good Works in Doctrine showing uncorruptness gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you just by living your life Brothers you will preach this gospel you will show people that there's something wrong with their behavior over in First Peter chapter 3 remember we're speaking about the Bride of Jesus Christ Living in the bride age which is the astronaut age the countdown is on First Peter chapter 3 verse 1. likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives the wives can intercede for those husbands that are just a little bit unruly verse 2 while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of planting the hair and of wearing gold or of putting on apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek Spirit a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in Old Time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement like why is he husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers your prayers be not hindered looking at this I just wanted to recover recap these because it's what we talked about in 2022 and I believe myself I can say I have thoroughly grown and learned talking about what brother Branham has has brought forth and and the many many quotes of of recognizing our positions as husbands recognizing our positions as wives and even recognizing our positions as children and even as employees as servants we can say servants that was for a different age a different era but we are all servants when we work for someone and even when we don't work for someone when we work for ourselves we're actually the biggest servant I would say because if you've got your own business ain't nobody going to do it for you you've got to get up and run and make it happen so anyways looking at all of this brothers and sisters tonight I just wanted to talk about the Bride of Jesus Christ Living out through the bride Age and and recognizing really our position and how we are to submit ourselves unto our own husbands we can look at this and say you know about the wives but I don't want to do that tonight I want to talk about the spiritual position of the Bride of Jesus Christ and how we are to be cleansed by the washing of the water of the word as we have read in Ephesians 5 verse 26 and 27 he plans to present it to himself a glorious church and so I I just want to throw this out there as we go forwards to recognize it as brother Gilbert has said I am my father are one that is really the call for this age that really is the the requirement for us to come to that place because when we start to do that brother Bradham says it that the shuck will start to pull away and then we go back to that seed portion but but you know what brothers and sisters I think I want to caution every one of us myself included to think that that shock has to pull away because that seed needs that shuck that seed will not live without that shuck and remember we talked about it on Sunday we're not talking necessarily about the seed the shock the tassel the the stem The Roots we're talking about the life inside it that is the key part we can say this seed but the seed is for the life and that seed has got to die brother Mervin brought it so good he said brother Branham says that that seed has to rot that seed has to die out that's the only way that it can come to life again every single seed that goes in the ground it has to rot in order for that life to happen and and here we are talking about being the Bride of Jesus Christ and how God and man are together again the wedding is happening right now and for many people the wedding has already happened and and as we saw the a transition we see the transition I talked about it on Sunday how it's no longer the laodicean church age it's the bride age according to the prophet for our day if we believe the prophet for our day then it is very much the bright age it's no longer laodicea some people might be in laodicea but they might not have all the seals open and that's just up to God to open their eyes it's not up to us to judge anyone but we can see it by people's behavior and how they receive this word of God but to recognize that we are living in the bride age there is a change of dispensation something has happened brother Branham says it in the message the Rapture it will be astounding for me to tell you what's actually taking place right now we're not building a wall any longer we're building a house and and when you come to the corner you have to be ready and willing to read the blueprint and make the turn when that happens and we have been given that in our day we talked about it on Sunday how he no longer calls us friends oh it no longer calls us servants but he calls us friends and you you know it goes further than that I no longer call you church but I call you bride and that was right when he was opening the word that's going to sanctify us to wash Us by the water of the word the word that God came and brought through the Vindicated Prophet the opening of the seals is what gives us the ability to be Sanctified otherwise if those seals are closed brothers and sisters we're just in a denomination we're the same as all the rest of the people maybe we live good lives and and we can gather together and have an assembly of people who believe that Jesus died and rose again but what good is it to to not actually see that the seals are open there was a purpose for it and it wasn't just so that we could say you know the the mystery that Paul spoke about over in Ephesians he speaks about this of being a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church this is a great mystery that a wife in in this day in laodicea in in the bride age can actually want to serve her husband and and that a husband would want to actually love his wife and not just say when things get tough you know what we'll just call a lawyer and we'll just do a separation it'll be a clean separation no that is that is the mystery that Paul is talking about no you and I are one the husband and wife are one there is a blending of the two this is the mystery that Paul was talking about and and brother Branagh makes it very clear in the message all throughout the message but a little bit later on maybe just a little bit more so I just want to read a quote today he says oh God if the world could only see that God and man are one the super sign was the first man that God come into that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church now remember Branham says in the seals the first seal I no longer call you church I call you bride so where did this get poured into brothers and sisters he didn't pour himself into denomination he poured himself into the bride all that Christ was he poured into the church super sign God and man together that was to be the Super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last day a super sign a virgin shall conceive I just love this and this conception when it's brought forth will be God manifested In the Flesh now some people are going to stop and say well brother Barry that was Jesus Christ according to Isaiah and sure enough it was but what about now what about today when we take this word into our spiritual womb who are you what is that that grows inside of you what is that that comes to life when you fall down and you make a mistake whose voice is that that speaks to you that says you know what you need to make that right you just need to go on your knees and and make a correction you just need to go and talk to that person what is that that's speaking to us a virgin shall conceive and this conception when it's brought forth will be the will be God manifested In the Flesh a super sign they still don't believe it but it was anyhow it's a super sign notice super sign they've got a Superman today they've got fictions of Superman all these other kind of super things but the church has got a super sign God back in the church I just love this God back in the church manifested in human flesh God United with man his sure super sign I'm sure you can guess which message this is out of 1963 it's super sign 11 29 this is God back in the church and again many people would say well brother Barry it's the church it's the greater body and God's back in the church when you have service you call him down and and and the music brings him and the preaching is good and when it's talking about the word of God it's it's it's God back in the church again and to some extent it is brothers and sisters but I'll tell you this unless we're doing it according to the message of the hour we're bringing something into the church but I don't know what it is because if we're not bringing it according to the message of the hour then we're actually missing the word we're missing that super sign that super sign brothers and sisters is you and I receiving the word for our day that's what the super sign is that's God back in the church inside the believer he doesn't just come to the church when we get here and somehow we just blend the dimensions and he comes brothers and sisters you bring him with you he comes with you that's why we need to come to church prepared don't come to church to meet with Jesus come to church to bring Jesus and brothers and sisters when you do that then we'll see Super Signs in our midst he says notice super sign they got a Superman today they got fictions of Superman all these other kind of super things but the church has got a super sign God back in the church manifested in human flesh God United with man his sure super sign and I just want to go back to what we said on Sunday the the greatest Miracle of our day brothers and sisters is for man to be able to be converted into a new creature in Christ Jesus according to this word not the first poll signs and wonders not the second post signs and wonders but to have this to be the Super sign when you receive the word for your day when you get the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Spirit when you're truly converted and made a new creature in Christ Jesus according to the word for your day you are that super sign to the world around you you are that super scientist Satan when he comes around that's where we come to the place where Satan just won't know what to do with us well we'll get so far into the word that Satan just won't even want to deal with us he doesn't want to get that close to the word we know that Adam and Eve as long as they were in the Garden of Eden and behind that word of God the word of God don't do this if you do this you're going to die and Satan comes around and said oh you're not surely you're not going to die one word off caused the fall of all of mankind as long as they were behind that word they were safe but as soon as they stepped out from behind that word look out they were fair game as soon as the children of Israel stepped into their promised land they were safe all their enemies were dead before them all they had to do was be in their position but as soon as they stepped up to that borderline and got outside of their Promised Land brothers and sisters it's the same for us today all we have to do is stay in the word all we have to do is keep that word in US you know sometimes we can have times in our lives where we get up to that borderline where we get up to the edge of our promised land and and I want to just sort of bring it down to where the rubber meets the road in our lives as the Bride of Jesus Christ we can go from being the the chaste virgin and and having really good positive conversation and and being quiet and having that Meek Spirit to actually getting to the place where corrupt communication comes out of our mouth and how does that happen and I'll say this I just want to be real clear you don't have to be a woman to gossip and and it sounds funny brothers and sisters I'm not saying that women gossip more than men but I think I've heard it inferred that it kind of is that way and I want to say it this way it's not that way human beings are subject to gossip so don't put that off on anyone but the word of God says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers many times we'll read the next scripture and saying grieve not the holy spirit of God worry about you're sealed unto your day of redemption you're sealed to the day of redemption that's what the prophet of God said but don't grieve the Holy Spirit by bringing corrupt communication say nice things brother Branham said talk about your brother uplift him talk about your sister uplift her talk about your husband talk about your wife talk about your children children speak about your parents speak positive things we're living in the third pole ministry here if we're living under that Ministry the third Paul the spoken word what words are coming out of our mouths who wants to give Satan a day off and that's what we do when we start going that way brother Adam says no he's talking about the word and the bride being one this super sign I just think it's so beautiful recognizing we're living in the bright age we're we're in the position where any day now the the Rapture could go we are having a conversation today uh Lisa was listening to a message and and she just said you know isn't it fantastic when you think about it we're 60 years down the road but brother Branham spoke about it like the Rapture was happening that day or or tomorrow like here we are 60 years down the road the grace of God we should have not a quiet person in the building when we recognize the grace of God was just waiting for all of us to come to the place where we could lift up our hands close our eyes and say thank you Lord for saving my soul for giving me ears to hear what the spirits saith unto the church bye the grace of God who knows how many more days he'll go maybe it'll be another week maybe it'll be another decade we don't know that's why we've got to hold our potatoes that's why if the church keeps growing we're probably going to need another building that's why other churches are building new churches some people say oh the prophet of God said you shouldn't do that you know what we need to do is keep preaching the word keep seeing people get Washed by the Water of the word that's what we need to see we still have to provide for our families I never had anybody tell me this if you don't get your stuff together and get an education how are you ever going to provide for your family when that time comes nobody put it into words like that that would have clicked with me in my mind it was just go to school do what you're told don't get out of out of order that was kind of the way it was in my life I'm sorry Dad I know you weren't that way but that's the way I perceived it anyways if somebody would have said to me you know what we don't know what's going to happen in 10 years 20 years 50 years from now you might have one kid you might have five kids you might have 14 children how are you ever going to provide food enough for your 14 children how are you ever going to give them the opportunity to go to university how are you ever going to be able to get their teeth fixed by the dentist if you don't go to school and provide an income for your child family for your children if I would have had those kind of words I might have thought wow you know brothers and sisters don't think the Rapture is going to save us from doing the harder work we've got to do the harder work in this life whether it's go to school whether it's go to church whether it's raise a family whatever it is we got to do we got to do it brother Bradham says hold your potatoes like he's coming in a hundred years but live like he's coming tomorrow brother random says now here you are a person I'm preaching the word saying that he's not dead He's Alive and you know that's I just have to pause there I didn't say it before but that's kind of the theme uh that I have for Easter this year is that he's risen and we've said it before in the past and we'll probably get right into it in time but he's got to be risen right here right here 2000 years ago it's not good enough two thousand years ago won't save you today brothers and sisters he's you've got to accept him today in the person of Jesus Christ in the form of his word but that word becomes a life when we live it when we accept it into our womb he says here you are a person I'm preaching the word saying that he's not dead he's alive he's alive and promise to identify himself in our flesh human flesh like he did back there see all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church that's him Christ in US now if the Lord Jesus has raised him from the dead he just has dot dot dot I just want to say my own words then we're raised from the dead because if we are in Christ Jesus then we went to the Grave with him we went to Calvary with him we were with him when he spoke those words for that logos to come out of him to say let there be light and we know that it was life that came out of him but if we were with him if we're with them today then we were with him then isn't it a beautiful thing to recognize that there's nothing that we we can do there's nothing more that I can do for Jesus done at all there's nothing more that I can do where Jesus Paid It All didn't he isn't that the song there's nothing more that I could do for Jesus Paid It All we're just complete in him and you know our wives husbands are complete in us and our children are complete in in our parents and all we need to do is follow the pattern that was given to us in the word but when we do that then he will take and sanctify us and cleanse us with the washing of the Water by the word the word of the Vindicated Prophet for our day I uh I was talking to Eric Eric McKay I spoke about him on Sunday I baptized him on Saturday and somebody mentioned you know it it's too bad that we couldn't have done it on a on a Sunday and unfortunately we couldn't do it on a Sunday he's in a treatment facility where he only has a pass on uh Saturday between one and nine and so that's the reason we did it he said he wanted to get baptized he understood the gravity of it so I said amen let's do it and so uh brother Henry fixed us up thank you brother and we met here and I just went and picked him up actually and brought him here and we have the baptism after the musician's practice but you know we were just talking about it and how wonderful it is to recognize the grace of God the goodness of God and and I I see in this man that God is still calling and it's just a wonderful thing because he's talking about the word and the importance of the word and how people are so confused about the word in our day but here we have this man who has gone through so very much in his life and and he's just craving the word and wanting to follow the word he knew that he needed to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to Acts 2 38 to see that word washing a man washing a person bringing them to the place where they become a new creature in Christ Jesus and you know brothers and sisters the the end of that is where people will say to him you know who are you and what have you done with with Eric where where is that guy at because you're not the same person that I knew you're not the same person that I used to party with but the thing about it is you just no longer desire to hang out with those people it's such a beautiful thing if we could only ever just get to Christ and get Christ in us all of the old things will just pass away and behold All Things become new our lives are no longer our lives it's such a beautiful thing going on in the quotes tonight brother Branham says you know it's like I said a big arcade for we're baptized into that arcade by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is Christ which is the Royal Seed of Abraham and heirs to everything that's in it amen and you can see the theme that I'm I'm getting at tonight and I believe this is the way it is as husbands we pour ourselves into our wives and into our children into our families we pour all that we have into them that's that's the role of the husband is to be the servant unto the the body of the family and that's the role of of of pastors is to pour themselves into the congregation that's the role of a prophet to pour himself into the age everything that was in God God poured into Christ everything that was in Christ he poured into the believer amen God above us God With Us and God in us everything every promise in the book is yours if you can believe it if you have faith enough to accept it and believe it I just can't get past this thought tonight I know I'm having the devil kick me with this saying everything that God was everything that God was he poured into Christ and Christ poured it into the church well where is it then where is it then I want to tell him it's right here it's right here and it's in exactly that the amen it's in the amen to the word for our day that's where it's at that's the supernatural that is man and God being one that's man being the Flesh of God that's God manifesting In the Flesh brother Bradham goes on to say you know look around if I find something that's a little too high wonder what's in that I'll get me a ladder and push it up around and keep climbing till I get to it he says that's the way a promise in the Bible if anything seems like it's kind of mysterious to me I just keep on praying till I reach it that's all that's the way to do it keep praying Keep Holding On climbing up believing until you're heir to it you got a promise to it and you gotta write to it Satan will say no you don't got to write to it don't you remember what you did yesterday don't you remember what you thought before church don't you remember what you're thinking right now you don't got to write to it if you were doing all that stuff then then then you would have a right to it but I know who you are no Satan you don't know who I am you can't see the real me one day you will see the real me you'll see the real us and we'll be like are you the one that troubled all the nations you'll be just defeated just like you are right now sorry it's bizarre if I had to go on how I feel I would just walk off the stage right now my goodness I I just believe it with all my heart that Satan does not want these words spoken he doesn't want the Bride of Jesus Christ recognizing her position when she recognizes her position that all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he's poured into her now let's just take it from saying the church to her to the Bride of Jesus Christ if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ then all that God was he has poured into you today brothers and sisters when you believe this message of the hour and that means that Satan is powerless before you there's no mechanical climbing to a place where someday you're going to achieve it all you've got to do is say Amen to it I just believe it there's no achievements going to get us there he says that's the way to do it keep praying Keep Holding On keep climbing up believing until your heir to it you got a promise and you gotta write to it and ask and you shall receive for all things are possible to them that belief that's out of Jehovah Jireh number one in 1964. I just think it's such a beautiful thought that all that God was and what was God God was the self-existing one remember God is the one that spoke let there be light God is the one that divided the night from the day he's the one that hung every single star and named them how many stars are there wow how does the universe keep spinning how do the planets keep in Balance he created gravity all of the dark matter that people talk about everything that there is everything that there ever was or ever will be was created by this God this is the one that we're talking about that poured himself into Christ but then Christ being the man manifestation of God poured all that he was into the bride we don't have to tolerate the devil and his antics don't worry about how you feel how you feel has nothing to do with it the Holy Ghost is without sensation the Holy Ghost says Amen to the word for my day all that God was John 1 1 Saint John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God we know that brother Bradham he quotes it that way many times I just want to say it this way in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with God and the logos was God and the logos became flesh and dwelt Among Us that logos is now in US it's not just an inanimate object it's not just something that's out there that we can say wow Before Time was time there was the logos no no no no it was all poured out and it's all poured out and someone somewhere has to be the one to say amen I just accept it the way the word says it I don't understand it I don't understand how we could have the logos living out through us I believe it with all my heart that if we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters that picture that we see of brother Branham you could take his face out and put your face in if we had the ability to see on that Spectrum we would see the pillar of fire over top of every single one of the Believers in this room tonight and you know what good would it do us though to be able to see that we would be able to say well I can see Believers here and Believers there so what what we need to do is say can we see the word can we believe the word if we can believe the word for our day we know that Pillar of Fire is there but that logos became flesh and dwelt Among Us we know that he had attributes that he wanted to be a father that logos wanted to be a husband and and wanted to be a son and we know that there were seven Redemptive names for this logos Jehovah the mighty Jehovah when he became a savior we know there's Jehovah rohay Jehovah Jireh Jehovah he is the Lord is my shepherd Jehovah Jireh the Lord is my provider Jehovah Rapha the Lord my healer Jehovah shalom the Lord my peace Jehovah Nissi the Lord my banner Jehovah Sid canoe the Lord my righteousness not not me with my righteousness but the Lord my righteousness Jehovah the Lord is there for me he wanted to take a bride of his own choosing with all of those attributes to let her know that every single time she has a need he's got it covered honey I've got it covered could you imagine if we were able to go into marriage and say that to our wives honey don't worry about it I got it all covered everything is looked after it's all going to be fine you don't have to worry about one single thing in our entire lives it's all good I know myself I had to go into marriage saying you know what I got a little bit of scratch of of money and I I think that maybe I've got a job and you know maybe it'll be okay we'll just go and try this together I believe if we have the word of God and we've got the Holy Ghost then it will work out somehow it'll be fine that was kind of my experience with my wife I didn't have the ability to say don't worry honey everything is looked after I don't know how many men in the room could do that tonight I'm not asking for a show of hands but there's one that could and there's one that did brothers and sisters he's given us that invitation to be his bride if we can receive this word of God he's got it all covered he's going to be our sacrifice he's going to be our Banner he's going to be our healer every single thing that we have need of he has got covered such a beautiful thought all that Christ was all that God was he's poured into Christ which was all of those attributes right and now all that Christ was he's pouring into the church and you know we don't have the time to explain all of these I think we could probably preach all of 2023 in each one of these but here we are all that Christ was in John 8 verse 12 then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life John 9 4 I must work the works of him that sent me while it's day the night cometh when no man can work as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world brothers and sisters tonight you are the light of the world if you have been the Bride of Jesus Christ and he has poured all that Christ was into the Bride of Jesus Christ you are that light of the world by receiving this word for your day and all that Christ was he's poured into the believer and you know brothers and sisters this is where we have the reason to Rejoice we know that he's got it all covered we cannot miss it you won't miss it you will not miss the day of redemption you will not miss being there at the Judgment Day where you know you're seated with him in his throne if you receive this word for your day you don't have to worry about being saved today and lost tomorrow that is a nicolaitan lie of the devil you will not be lost if you are saved that's how God operates it's impossible for you to be saved if your name is written in heaven the Lamb's Book of Life nobody's going to strike it from there that's why it's so important for us to recognize brothers and sisters don't focus on the first and second polls don't do that remember the disciples did in the first and second polls of Jesus ministry he sent them out and they came back and they were rejoicing they had some great Services they cast out devils and and healed the sick and raised the dead they did all that and and what did Jesus say to him don't Rejoice because of that don't Rejoice by the many good works that's happened Rejoice for one reason and that reason is because I have taken a bride of my own choosing and your names have been written in heaven in my blood before the foundation of the world that's what you need to Rejoice about so brothers and sisters if we have the ability to hear the word for our day the message of the hour then we have all the reason to Rejoice all the reason to Rejoice don't get upset if we don't see God answer the prayer the way that we think that he should answer it or the way that we would want him to answer it just say be it unto me according to Thy word Lord Jesus if you want it to be this way then it's going to be this way I don't think that it should be this way but Lord if it's this way it's this way because you're allowing it to be this way because there's no accidents that happen on this Earth everything is under your control if our names are written in heaven brothers and sisters it causes a humility I would say it causes The Godly humility we don't get puffed up there's nothing in us that says I'm better than anybody you know what if we truly have a revelation of the godhead in our lives if we truly recognize that all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church the Bride of Jesus Christ if we have that recognition then it causes a humility in our lives that's Second To None something about it we recognize the only reason that we're saved is because of his grace and what he's done because he chose to take us and sanctify and cleanse us with the washing of the Water by the word of the Vindicated prophet in our day he chose me to be able to have ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the laodicea in church come out of her my people don't be partakers of her sins and you know what you can come a little higher just like John there's a door open in heaven if you want want to go there the recognition of his grace remember when John made it into heaven what did he do he saw that there was a book in the hand of that one that was Seated on the throne not three not two one on the throne what did he do he wept much because he knew there was nobody in Earth or in heaven or anywhere that could open that book or even look upon it but we know that John being a type of the bride was told he was told just Rejoice John for the lion of the tribe of Judah he prevailed so that you could live he actually didn't just Prevail he poured himself into the church so that she could prevail you know looking at Second Corinthians 11 looking at just maybe a little bit of a different perspective in the last five minutes I hope we're okay looking at it how God is our husband Jesus is our husband the Holy Ghost is our husband all three of those are the very same being they're not different they're not separate they're not separate persons one God Jesus Christ God almighty and the Holy Ghost second Corinthians chapter 11. maybe turn there with me I just think this is such an important thing that I don't want to overlook it tonight I don't know if we'll go much further than this but to look at this to think about the word to think about the bride age to think about how we've been called to be the Bride of Jesus Christ it's not something that we can take lightly and say that I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and while they're cannon fodder or or their serpent seed you know what that's that's not the humility of Jesus Christ he came to the Sinners he came to the ones who were actually Bound in Chains naked living in the caves with thousands of devils in them to save them second Corinthians 11 verse 1 went to God ye could bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me why is that for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ sometimes I believe we can take the message of the hour and make it a great mystery and and a bunch of dark things and and seals and a bunch of different things Brothers and Sisters Let's Not stray from from the beaten path let's remember that all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he's poured into his bride now and and it's that simple according to the message of the hour we are Jesus Christ on Earth today we are all that many people in this world will ever see of Jesus Christ I I've said it before many times many other ministers have probably said it brothers and sisters before the Rapture comes don't look for some great fantastic thing to happen don't look for a squeeze don't look for anything just look around because this is probably all that's going to happen right here what we're living right now this is what's going to happen and one of these days it's going to be the secret sudden going away of the Bride of Jesus Christ it'll just be a silent thing that'll happen the world wants it to be something great and big it's not going to be because not many people can truly receive this word but when we can truly receive this word brothers and sisters we have the ability to discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit within the framework of the Christian church and know that Satan is powerless before us and it doesn't cause any sort of Pride to rise up in our lives we don't get to a place where we're better than anybody we're worse than everyone we recognize that we're we're the we're the chiefest of sinners but we are one thing and this is what I think the critical thing is tonight I'll call the musicians as I as I close and I'll say this we're subject to his headship we haven't said this word since we started talking about this but I think we probably will as we get going in terms of the family stuff but now we're going to talk about Christ in the church this mystery but you know what it is it's headship and if we can't accept the leadership of Christ in our life if we can't have that headship then we will never have proper headship in our homes that will never happen and you know what we talked about it before in the past I'll say it again if we want to have true communion with Jesus Christ then we have to be willing to be led we will not ever get to Jesus Christ in terms of communion we'll go and have the bread we'll go and have the wine brother Barry I have communion all the time okay we have communion services but we're talking about when I say communion I'm talking about fellowship with Jesus Christ one on one communion with the Lord Jesus Christ all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the ones who are willing to be led those ones who aren't willing to be led they don't get it that that pouring out just goes by them but there's some who are subject to his headship the first son was a spoken seed word of God he was given a bride I'm just reviewing brother Brown speaking the spirit now is picking up what I said see a bride for to produce himself she fell see that's what the bride was given to produce himself again another Son of God but she fell by high breeding see produced himself but she fell caused him to die the Second Son a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like Adam but before he could marry her she had fallen also for she was put to free moral agency like Adam's wife was to believe God's word and live or doubt it and die and she did then from a little group of true seed then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the Virgin who knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas looking at this quote here many times I've read the other part of it a little further on and I'm sure you know what that is if you don't it's the word is in the bride she has the mind of Christ to know what to do with it but I just think this part is so wonderful because she has the ability to recognize the headship submission to her husband and you know brothers and sisters if we want to see this life lived out through us we have got to have headship in our lives we have got to be willing to submit ourselves to headship if we can't do that we will not see true communion with God in our lives he goes on to say the Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself made manifest maybe stand with me tonight as I read this he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb type of the spirit womb now so will the Virgin now accepting his word be it unto me as thou Hast said though it was said by an Angel while it yet was the written word Isaiah 9 and 6.
