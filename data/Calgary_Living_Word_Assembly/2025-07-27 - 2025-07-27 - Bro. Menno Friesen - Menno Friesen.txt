The redeemed of the Lord are sitting amongst us this morning. Blessed be his name. Good to be in the house of the Lord. Just a reminder this morning. I'm looking for a city.

Father, that is our testimony. Father, Lord, we thank you for this day, this opportunity once again, Father, to gather in this manner. Father, &gt;&gt; not so much just in the building, but Lord, that's a part of it. Father, we gather ourselves according to your word, but a true desire in our heart to do it, Father. Not out of tradition, Father. Not of something that we were told we must do, Father. We do it openly, Father. We know this is your word. And Father, we want to apply and fulfill your word in every aspect of our lives, Father. Lord, we stand here today, Father, your purchase, your redeemed, your bride. &gt;&gt; It brings such humility to us, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. to be able to stand here in the last day with a testimony of knowing you personally in our lives. You gave us your word, Father. You made us overcomers by even giving us of yourself, Father. We thank you for this opportunity, Lord. So therefore, we assemble once again, Lord, in your name, &gt;&gt; with the revelation and of understanding, Father, that this is how you spoke it and meant it to be, Father. Lord, and you told us, Lord, all the total obedience to the whole or complete word of God entitles us to your life. Father, we stand here today with a testimony we have your life in us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That overcoming power, Lord, not us and our will of ourselves, Father, but by your life, Father. Lord, &gt;&gt; as our brother comes and brings the word of life, Father, Lord, may it find more room in our hearts, Father, Lord, that more of you would come forth, Father. That is what we desire, Lord. We're called for a purpose, Lord, and we want to stand in this day for that purpose, Lord, in every avenue, every aspect of our life, Father. Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, as we come humbly before you to receive of you, Lord, we lift our hands and our mouths and our hearts to worship you, Father, to sing songs, Lord, to give testimonies, Father, of your greatness and your goodness, Father. And as a part of that, Lord, we bring our tithes and our offerings, Lord. Father, may you bless it, Lord. You know the needs of this assembly, the financial needs, Lord, and your body, Father, Lord. But we commit it all into your hands in full faith and full assurance that you will provide a way. In Jesus Christ's name, Lord, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To God be the glory. to God be the glory. Won't you God be the glory? [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] with his hand. He has to go the glory for the days he has done. Sing that once more as you're seated. Just going to ask uh brother Justin Dubsky has a special wherever he's at. can come right after this. To God be the glory. Oh, to God be all the glory. [Music] Oh, to God be the glory for the things he has done. Heat. Heat. [Music] to God. Give the glory for the things he has done. [Music] Amen. God bless you this morning. &gt;&gt; I want to greet you from the home church, brother Ron Peterson. I know he wanted to pass along his greetings to each and every one of you. Barry, bless you. And u you know, I couldn't help but just sit there and think about um you know, a young man that was born in a message church, raised by message good parents, but still had to come to a place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where God had to meet him face to face. And each one of us have to go to that place. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's something that we all want for our kids. It's something that we all want for our families. And so I just ask that uh if you know this song, just sing it with me. [Music] Where would I be? Lord, you only know. &gt;&gt; I'm glad you see through eyes open. [Music] If not for grace, Oh, where would I be? for you know you see I was such Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] the world. [Music] If not, where would I be? for you only know. I'm glad you see through us. I was a homeless such a sweet [Music] Thank you, my brother. We have a testimony this morning as well. Could help out with the mic. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Good morning. God bless. Just wanted to take this opportunity to give glory to God as we just sang. Um, for those of you who um know me and have heard my story the last little bit, I've been looking for a car and God provided that car for me um on Friday. &gt;&gt; So, I just wanted to give a praise report um about the situation around that. And um I'll just I wrote it down so I'll just read it to you. In August of 2024, Brother Jose here, our one of our preachers, um he preached and in that sermon, he encouraged us to pray and ask God for something we've never asked him for before. Something that only God could do for us, as then we would know that had been provided by God. With some thought, I decided to ask for $20,000 off a car in the new year. To me, I thought that was a big ask, a crazy ask. Um, I'd already asked God to watch over my rust bucket of a car, a 2009 Ford Focus with 330,000 km on it. Occasionally, it screeched when I started it, but it always started, and I would praise God every day for that. Although I knew God was going to not going to just drop a car in my yard. I had no savings for this car. By the end of the year, a bathroom renovation, necessary kitchen appliances, and a week of lost income while hospitalized had depleted my daily savings. Despite this, I had paid my thighs and thank God for the opportunity to step out in faith for my finances as I also made a donation to missions. This year, I was able to begin saving money again. I began looking for a vehicle in March and completed my taxes. I also imagined how God was going to answer my prayer. Perhaps it would be a hail damaged car or a demo car, maybe an estate vehicle. I didn't know, but I believed he would answer my prayer. In April or May, I received my tax refund. Due to my charitable donations, it was the largest refund I had ever received. Shortly after, as I balanced my budget, I realized this refund and my new savings were going to add up to 20,000 by this summer. I begun to understand that this this is how God was going to answer my prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God kept my old rust bucket going. It is almost 360,000 kilometers on it now. And God brought it right up to the possession of a two 2025 Subaru Impreza RS. &gt;&gt; Praise God for answered prayers. I just want to also say that I know that some may belittle this, not I don't believe anybody here in church would, but um some may belittle it and state that it's mathematically possible to achieve this considering the factors, but I did not know those factors would play out this way when I said this prayer in August of 2024. I prayed that prayer on a Sunday and I was hospitalized for mental health concerns the following Friday. Satan wanted to squash that prayer, but I'm here to say God answers prayer. &gt;&gt; So, I want to also ask everyone to join me at my car if it's not raining or downstairs. I brought a celebration cake and I think we can all enjoy that together. Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Amazing how God works. were talking to our grandkids the other day about things and don't don't hopefully you don't take this wrong sister sister Amber and but little things like it could be considered a little thing. were talking about the possum story and the little puppy that got run over that brother Ram said, "Well, you know, if they said just go shoot it." Well, he said, "No, let's just wait for a bit &gt;&gt; and he ra and the Lord raised those animals up." So, those little things that God does for us, we just appreciate it. I I was telling a few people, I lost my cell phone this past week and it was a bad loss as you know, we live on our phones. SIM cards in there, everything's in there. &gt;&gt; And I asked the Lord, "Lord, would you just show me?" Sorry to don't mean to trump your your testimony, sister, but I I I went right to the He guided me right to the place, pulled aside some bushes and there it was. Like I I said, "Lord, that just that was you. We thank you, Lord." Never quit asking. Never quit asking. Our Lord is an amazing husband, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amazing provider. We thank the Lord. Thank you for the special, Brother Justin. That was so so moving to me. It's just by grace we're here. Let's stand. We start a service. Change the order of the service. Uh chorus first. The course, please. the course this morning. Lord, feed your children. Who else would we want to be fed by this morning? He's the fountain of all life. When our brothers come, we certainly appreciate brother Menow and his testimony to stand. He happens to be my uncle on top of it. My one of my favorites is probably my favorite, but I certainly he's my living favorite. Just good to be here in the house of the Lord amongst friends amongst believers. Like brother Mitch said, isn't it amazing that we're going to spend all of eternity with each other? What a what a incredible hope that is and what a blessing. We just thank the Lord for bringing our brother by. Lord, would you feed me this morning? Would you just come by my way? Sing it as a prayer this morning. Well, Lord, feed your children. As we stand here to the table to that mountain and go around the [Music] Let's sing that one more time. Lord, feed your children. Oh Lord, feed your children. Are you willing today? [Music] [Music] the mountain [Music] the father. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today. Welcome one more time to the house of the Lord so we can eat at that table. My heart is absolutely full. There's so many visitors here today. I'm just going to say welcome visitors, each and every one of you. God richly bless you all. &gt;&gt; It's tremendous to see everyone and just to know that as we've heard, we're going to spend eternity there. What a blessing that is. My we just uh we had the wedding yesterday for brother Logan Ber and what a tremendous day that was and is as they embark on their new life together. And uh we're certainly looking forward to see what the Lord will do in their life. &gt;&gt; We also want to acknowledge Sister Rebecca Odelene who has gotten married yesterday as well in Nigeria and her sisters traveled this last week to go and celebrate with her. And we know we have been praying for those sisters that they would find husbands that husbands would find them and the Lord has answered prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's continue praying for the other three sisters. There's four of them in total. That the Lord would just bless them with that abundance of opportunity if he should terry. What a tremendous thing it is. My goodness. I just feel like I could preach today. Just would like to acknowledge brother Dwayne Far, Pastor Saskatoon Tabernacle, Sister Connie. God richly bless you. Welcome sister Irene and brother Menow Fzen, the founders of that church and uh our elder certainly honored and privileged to have him here today to one more time step up to the front line and just allow the Lord to use him for our benefit. &gt;&gt; Sister Amber Lassard, God richly bless you and thank you for the testimony. Brother Paul, I believe we could just have a testimony service here this morning and just talk about that third pole power of the almighty God moving in our lives. But &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we want to hear the word. So, if you have a need this morning, let's just go to him in prayer and as we heard, just ask him. &gt;&gt; He's more than able. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Gracious heavenly father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we know that you're here. Thank you for each and every life represented here, Lord Jesus. All of us desire more of you. And Father, we know that you said through your prophet to this bride in this age, if there is a desire for more, then that means there has to be more to be had. So, Father, let us drink from that fountain one more time today. Lord, if there's any needs in our midst today, Father, help us to not be bashful, but Lord, help us to come boldly according to your word to your throne of mercy and grace in our time of need. Father, we pray that you would sovereignly meet the needs in your hearts of your children. Be with those who are traveling, Lord. Bless the newlyweds, Lord. Father, we pray that you would just go with us now. Take us by the hand, Lord Jesus, and lead us where you will through your word today. Father, we just ask that you would be glorified in all that's said and done in our service now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Let's just sing that chorus one more time. Lord, feed your children as we invite brother Mano to come. Oh Lord, feed your children. [Music] of life. Oh, let me drink from the fountain that flows from the mountain. Let me feast from the table of life. Amen. Let's just pray one more time. Lord has already has been prayed and sung. The specials are sung and the offerings been taken. The time's come to where we like change the drama now to to speak from your word something that would be eternal. Maybe further fortify the faith that we now have. Lift us a little higher. bring us to a place to where our choices would be clear. &gt;&gt; Maybe there's something that's troubling us along the way. Oh, there is an answer, but we have not found the answer yet. So, we ask Lord that you would do that for you are the great I am. &gt;&gt; Said, I'm never going to leave you. I'll be with you even in you to the consummation of time. And if we ever knew, Lord, we are looked through all of history of the Bible and the vindicated word of this age confirms that the gentile dispensation has run out. The world's the book of redemption is about to be closed. &gt;&gt; And there's be a rapture, a physical change of mortal bodies to immortality. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We we revel in the glory of the changes that's going about now. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. as we labor daily laying in the presence of the som &gt;&gt; letting it bake out all the greenness and the imperfections &gt;&gt; for it isn't the mistake Lord it's like the our brother was singing we felt like we were so helpless &gt;&gt; but we realize now &gt;&gt; if we are a seed of God today we always have been a seed of you &gt;&gt; waiting to be quickened &gt;&gt; waiting to be made alive &gt;&gt; when the true word struck our soul, something sprung up and said, "That's nothing but the truth, Lord." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that is our testimony again today. &gt;&gt; It's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, &gt;&gt; but your word will never pass away. &gt;&gt; It's passing from glory to glory now &gt;&gt; into a greater glory till finally it'll end up into immortality. So, as we spend some time around your word, Lord, I pray that you'll enlighten us and strengthen us and encourage us and guide my mouth, Lord. And when I've said enough, nudge me that I've would understand to everything. There's a time and a season &gt;&gt; and a purpose. &gt;&gt; This has been a good season at the wedding here. &gt;&gt; We love to see a young couple start in Christ &gt;&gt; where they can labor together to build a home. for that we thank you and we ask your blessing on them again one more time and of course we'll pray for them daily Lord we pray for every family here that's raising children and and the children and the the old and the young Lord there's no age in Christ &gt;&gt; yes thank you &gt;&gt; but here we have different areas some are just being born others are old as far as the the body is concerned but our soul is immortal Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you now for your grace. Bless us around your word. We thank you for this music and the songs we ask in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You could be seated. Thank you. I'd like to just sing one course and then step down, but I better not. I lit the sister giving the testimony. You know, I thinking uh when I heard that I think how many times have I been there? I remember in the early years by I thought I would I be able to pay the next bill. Little is much when God's in it. &gt;&gt; Labor not for wealth or fame. &gt;&gt; There's a crown and you can win it &gt;&gt; if you go in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; And it takes sometimes it takes all those things. We don't really like to talk about the things along our own life. Sometimes we don't like to talk about our own weaknesses and our shortcomings and our failures. But I was always so blessed in my life since I've heard brother Brandham speak. Uh you know the first time I heard him speak I was just a boy. But then when I heard him the next time I was 22 years old and the one thing I always noticed that he was not afraid or ashamed to say I was wrong. &gt;&gt; I thought he meant this. Then he revealed it. Now I know &gt;&gt; that changed my mind. Which one of us would say here today, you haven't been hadn't had a mind change? &gt;&gt; I've had it &gt;&gt; and we'll continue to have it as long as the Lord is leading and guiding us. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think if you if you know you're standing on the word of God, then just stay there. And if he leads a little higher, walk with that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Good to see all of you. And of course, family. This morning, I'm preaching to family. My own children are here. And brother Mitch, Sister Vicki, it's good to see you. uh you know you you've been a good part of our friendship life and Saskatchewan all of them from Saskatchewan uh here Dwayne Connie and and uh Dave and Leanne Darren Denise will all of you um let me see of course you know you're here because of Shelly and the family and the Boyers they've uh they have been a great part of our life I I I grown every once in a while um this might sound a little bit odd that uh that Ken's been gone. How many years has Ken been gone? &gt;&gt; Six. Still have a picture on the fridge of him. It's it's something that never will leave you. you know, he was my oh, maybe my first convert in the he was my convert in the Lord and then later on into the ministry and and uh and uh you know how later on uh Dwayne got married and they both became ministers and and uh Ken moving over here, but it always a secret prayer, you know, that uh Calgary didn't seem to have a fellowship. There was brothers around here. I'm not criticizing that at all, but there wasn't a real body here of believers. And today, I thank the Lord. You know, it took it takes time. It takes seasons. But in all things, uh God be glorified. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm glad to be here today. I know I'm an old man. I don't even like to talk about how old I am about how many years I've been here. But uh my Irene and I will be celebrating our 63rd year of being married. in November the 1st. And I want to say this humbly and and to the glory of God. I was just telling brother Barry, you know, it was in our life uh when I believe every person needs to find their place in the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; in a home, husband, wives, children. You know, God has an order that he goes down and pushes us places us in the family. But with that order comes a responsibility. With that order comes an action. We know that when we're called to something, we're called to action. Not just to hear the word, but to be doers of the word. And there's where our problem starts coming in. &gt;&gt; Then when we begin to do those things, then we learn along the way how to handle them. And I I uh I thank the Lord that that in the 63 years that the Lord has always been the head of our home. &gt;&gt; I believe he's been my head. &gt;&gt; The reason I cut my hair is because he's my head. &gt;&gt; The reason my wife doesn't cut her hair because I am her head. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And the children are under the headship of Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. For even as Christ and God is the head of Christ, so is Christ the head of the husband and the husband the head of the wife. And together that union makes a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I think so many times and I'm I'll probably just speak and uh see where where I enter in. But &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I told brother Barry, if I if I uh speak too short, then you take over. Finish it. If I speak too long, it go like this. But I don't think I will. I just uh I I just want to say that I thank the Lord for the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And if you're standing in a place where you don't feel like you have the full understanding, just wait on the Lord because he is a giver &gt;&gt; of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man can understand God &gt;&gt; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ himself. No man knows the order of God, &gt;&gt; but by the divine revelation &gt;&gt; of the son of man, the son of God, the son of David, which is Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we pray daily. Brother Aram said, "Whatever you do, whatever you do, pray daily for divine revelation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For we cannot give revelation, &gt;&gt; we can preach it. Right. &gt;&gt; The angel through the age taught us how to conduct oursel in the midst of the most perverse nation and world that'll ever be. &gt;&gt; In one sense, it's the worst condition that we've ever had it. In the other sense, it's the most glorious age we've ever lived in. &gt;&gt; Now, that's a paradox. &gt;&gt; And it's not easy to take. it it's hard to know the vastness the difference between the two because Matthew 24 tells us that that when uh they were talking about the Jesus was speaking about the coming and so on and when shall you be and when shall be the sign of your coming and so on and Jesus stopped and the first thing he said take heed that no man deceive you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So while this is the two banks of of the most glorious age, the revelation of the very vindicated Christ who had his picture taken &gt;&gt; in the return of the pillar of fire back into the church again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring in the headship of the word &gt;&gt; to bring a people in line with the word for the body change. &gt;&gt; That's what it why we're here. &gt;&gt; That's why we still wrestle and every church has it. Don't think it's strange when there's differences in the body of church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's like a home. Uh could I say that we've lived 63 years and we've never had a single fuss about anything. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's been a glorious road. She's done everything I wanted her to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; And then I woke up and found out Yes, she did. I'm not afraid to say this that if you husbands are all as happy with your wife as I am with mine, you're a blessed person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because because of the revelation of Jesus Christ to her personally, which I believe every wife has to have the same revelation that every husband has to have. And if you're going to have a home where Christ is the center of it, it starts at the headship because it when God if God's going to ask something of me or of our home, he's not going to go to Irene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to come to me. &gt;&gt; What have you done with the word that I gave you? &gt;&gt; For we are on earth. God is male. He's not female. But in him was the female attribute which we know in Adam and Eve the story. And I'm not going to go there but just to reckon ourselves today that in this age that we're living in now these two spirits are so strong. The rapture message is so real and so glorious to a people on earth right now around the world. There's people that's laying in the presence of this message worth all they've got. Amen. &gt;&gt; They've given everything to it. They know that the angel God vindicated the pillar of fire returning and vindicating even to where the seven angels appeared and made up the headship. Did you ever notice how uh somebody took that and the seven angels and put the head of Hoffman head in there and then he took and and uh printed it the biatitudes and printed the biatitudes in there and then wherever it was dark where the face was to come out he put it darker and then lighter and brother and somebody gave that to brother Brandham and gave him the the picture and uh and brother Bram looks at it and said oh what a revelation that is &gt;&gt; there he is Christ &gt;&gt; the word looking right out of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there is the face of almighty God veiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yet revealed &gt;&gt; coming right out of the word. &gt;&gt; And the very things even brother Bram said many times in his in his ministry, he said now when he talked about the seven seals and so on. Oh, how how adamant he was. He said, "We're waiting for that time, that third pole, when that comes. You just wait. It's not even written in the book. &gt;&gt; It's not even written the B in the Bible." He said, &gt;&gt; "Yeah, &gt;&gt; he kept on saying that." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And even when the first seal came and the second seal came, you you that are familiar with the message and not going to go and explain everything because you know how it is. We throw a pitch and say, "Oh, I know what that one's that was a curveball." Yeah. This Oh, that's a fast ball. I don't even play ball. So, why am I talking about that? Well, it did a little bit, but very little. But what I'm saying, when God throws something, you know, you you've read the message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You're not ignorant anymore. you you people are you're you're gathered maybe there's a few some here that's just starting but I tell you what you mean sure real quickly when you start when you get into the word of God &gt;&gt; he knows how to quicken it &gt;&gt; but but the word of God is sharp and in in this putting it together he knows just how to feed his sheep &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm grateful today and I I want to I want to say this um I I look down here I I had one little thing I wanted to recognize and I I'm I'm very happy also in the thought before I turn to the scripture uh just to be here and to be a part of this wedding. Uh it meant a lot to me too to see Logan who we have so prayed for and and uh you know see Lucas Kristen here today. Is anybody good to see you and all the family you know that they they uh they mean a lot to me because I I realize uh I want to actually spend eternity with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I know I've always, this is a little bit personal, but when we travel, I love to travel. One of the reasons is because somebody said, "Why don't you fly more?" And said, "Well, personally uh I'm not ready to fly yet. I I'm still earthly." And uh so when I drive and I see uh all of a sudden I I get around this Calgary area and years ago, I I parked in top. I looked I looked at that cowboy. Where's that that place there? I won't even know the place, but it's somewhere here, west of here. And they they said the cowboy rode in one day and he looked at that that country, beautiful rolling hills. He said, "Here's where I want to settle." And you ever get that feeling where you say, "Oh, I would just love to live here to have my family all around me and all of them with one accord, one oh, just a be." See, when you get married, you get a family then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's be good to be a husband, wife, but then the family comes. Now you become a unit. &gt;&gt; Now you want to do things and then you think, "Oh, wouldn't that be glorious just to see there goes my son over there, there goes my daughter there and there goes this one. Oh, and the cattle everywhere and oh, oh, this is this is it." And then I remember, hey, I'm 83 years old. And now if I was still on the ranch, I'd say, "Yeah, it looks good from here. Yeah, it looks good from here. I don't have the zeal anymore. &gt;&gt; It's dying. But do you know that the earth is actually made for man? &gt;&gt; We're actually made to live here. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when we get into that eternal body? Brother says when you find a spot there, you'll you you say, "I wonder if Brother Brown made it." &gt;&gt; I was saying, "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound." Say, "Oh, he made it. It's down there." And you know, he gives different illustrations about where he's at. Down there by the little cabin. And besides what is a home? &gt;&gt; I've seen things that looks like a beautiful home, &gt;&gt; but it's basically just a house. &gt;&gt; You can have 50 rooms in there, &gt;&gt; but it's just a house, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Unless love dwells there. &gt;&gt; It's just mortar, buildings, and brick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And take a little cabin. It might look broke down, be nothing, but have love there. And it's a home sweet home. &gt;&gt; And the buffalo don't roam there. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is home sweet home. &gt;&gt; That's what I believe about this gospel. To me, when I heard the angel speak to this age, it became home. &gt;&gt; The deep calling to the deep. I be something begin to settle in my heart. I knew not then, but later on I found out that I'd always been a part of God. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why I could respond &gt;&gt; to the voice of the age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read a scripture before I close. and 1 Corinthians 1. And uh if you just bear with me a little bit, I this is maybe quite a bit of longer service than I than I've got more notes here than I'll use today, but I want to just bring a little something that was dear to me. You know, after 60 years or 50 years, 52 years of preaching, I' I've thrown away stacks of notes, you know, over the years. Now everything's on computer, but I'm just a little bit behind. Uh, I still uh I still like to write it down. &gt;&gt; Uh, because usually the battery dies when I'm up here or I didn't charge it right or and that makes me more nervous than if I write it down. But first Corinthians, why don't you stand just a little change and uh I'm &gt;&gt; 1 and 18 if you drop in there or let's start with the 17th verse. For Christ sent me not to baptize, Paul's speaking here, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to unto us which are are saved, it is the power of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of the world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that the wisdom of God of the world, pardon me. For after that in the wisdom of God, the world by the wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the Jews required a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, unto the Greeks foolishness. But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God, because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is greater than men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. Father, we could continue to read, but drawing from there just a thought that I pray that will help us, strengthen us, and encourage us. Ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be seated if you would. I like St. John 5:24. I always like to quote it, but it's good. He, not they, not them, but he. It's a personal relationship. He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting or eternal life, Zoe, and shall not come into condemnation or judgment, but is passed from death into life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's another quote, Brother Bram, uh that I would like to read, discerning the body. And uh you've read it many times. I'm sure you have. But our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see or what we hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let that sink in. Our eternal. Every one of us sitting here today realizes you're heading somewhere. &gt;&gt; You can't stay here. There's a little song said, "You don't have to go to heaven and you don't have to go to hell, but you can't stay here." Amen. &gt;&gt; It's uh supposed to be a gospel song, but it okay. It is. But I see u we we can't stay here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's not a morning that I don't get up here that it doesn't tell me. You remember? You know why? &gt;&gt; Cuz the the bones they begin to So that wasn't that way at one time. But you can't stay here. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to stay here and see all of my great grandchildren grow up and go to the get married. And I'm glad to see some of the grandchildren, but great grandchildren. We loads of them now. Like to see every one of them. Those little ones. Yeah. But I probably won't see them if life continues. But we're all determined. We all have to go. We have to make that choice. No one's going to force you into it. No one's going to talk you into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the revel faith comes by hearing the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you hear it and are obedient, you shall live. You hear it and don't obey it, then it becomes judgment and condemnation to you. &gt;&gt; No man can quench the the grace of God when he pours it out. And I like the song, Brother Justin, that you hear Brother Bram talk about. I'd like to talk about misgrace. &gt;&gt; There's something most precious. We're saved by grace. &gt;&gt; And we're kept by the mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "You're not even saved by the blood. &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace." And the blood is what keeps you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keeps washing by the washing of the water by the word because it's the bleeding word that we're feeding on daily. It's the lifegiving word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not religion. This is not cre. We all had religion. I had menite religion. I don't know what you had, but I had menite religion. Some very good thoughts. Women didn't cut their hair. They didn't wear pants. They were obedient to their husband. They had home. They stayed home. They worked out of the home. Whether they had much or little, that was the Menite way. You still see it. Now, there's a blessing in that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. when I see today women living every kind of a life and women getting out there with the men into the world of the of men and so look at the perversion of the world today which that that's not my my message today but but I don't even want to spend time on that because that's got its own judgment &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; and it's going so fastly to that place to where that stream you can't slow it down &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; like a snowball you an avalanche you can't just hold your hand and hit back They keep back an avalanche. It It'll take its course. &gt;&gt; But our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see or what we hear, but it's determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear. &gt;&gt; Pastors can't give discernment. Ministers can't give that. When Jesus was on earth and his prophets were here, they spoke the word. And if the seed laid in there, it quickened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like the Lord in the beginning when he saw it was void and and uh dark. But one day he looked down and he spoke the word and the sun be to shine giving life to every seed that already laid there by predestination on this earth. Do you know before light came every seed was already planted here &gt;&gt; waiting for the su n &gt;&gt; and so is the predestinated will of God waiting for the s o end to shine in your heart and when the seventh angel now remember when the church ages changed and uh the last one was Pentecostal the pouring out of the spirit of God upon all flesh but out of that come a message that would turn the hearts of the children back to the original faith &gt;&gt; and every predestinated bride seed would be quickened by that and come out of denomination, come out from among them. Be your shepherd, sayith the Lord, into the word fellowship. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why every time we hear something or see something, we we go back to the word. Go back to the message. &gt;&gt; And brother Barry and I were just talking a little bit. I appreciate that. I'm a little older than he, but uh but he's probably got more wisdom than I have already. But but to go and and to to take it to the word of God when you hear something say, "Wait a minute, that sounds a little strange." &gt;&gt; Well, we have a urine &gt;&gt; thumb. Yes, &gt;&gt; we have a year thumb. This Bible, not the scripture, not the writing of it, the revelation by the seventh angel upon &gt;&gt; this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For there is a portion of this word that's being fulfilled now. Most of it, did you ever go over there in Romans where Paul talks about how the Old Testament could not do away with with sin? &gt;&gt; It could just cover it, &gt;&gt; right? But Jesus Christ so he knowled all of that those all of that old testament they never did come to the place to where it took away the desire of sin or unbelief. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came he not only set a person free but he took the desire of sin out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad today that when I hey there's all kinds of things that flash in front of you and immorality and all kind but oh sometimes I just walk around and say Lord God it's so good to have blinders on you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. just keep on walking. What's that to thee? Follow thou me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we ask, "What if this happens? What if that happens?" Jesus said, "Never mind that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's that to thee? &gt;&gt; Well, if one lives longer than the other and said, "Well, no. What's that to thee? Follow thou me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay with the word. Stay with the message. And if I've got one advice for you, this place here of of discernment comes by one way. Lord, &gt;&gt; feed me. &gt;&gt; Open my understanding to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, usually in life, we find that it's easy to correct with the beam in our eye. &gt;&gt; Did you ever notice how Jesus doesn't say when he talked about that, he said, uh, when thou correct thy brother, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Remove the beam of thine own eye first, &gt;&gt; and then you shall help the moat of your brother. That's just that's usually we don't like to I I Lord remove this molten from my eye so I can take the beam out of my brother. &gt;&gt; That's not what he said. &gt;&gt; He actually said remove the beam out of your own eye first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let your spirit be right first &gt;&gt; before you go to correcting &gt;&gt; your brother, your sister. &gt;&gt; Let your spirit be right before the Lord so that when you're being judged by the word, you say, "Lord, I did that at your will and for your purpose. I have no other purpose to help my brother, my sister, or whoever it might be. It might be a sinner. It might be so like even in the scripture, you'll find out there were some strong things. I think that time when when uh Paul had to rebuke Peter &gt;&gt; about circumcision, you know how we sometimes get a little partial and a little bit, well, I that brother believes the doctrine different. I I sure hope nobody saw that I was standing with him. &gt;&gt; Maybe he'll think I'm like him. &gt;&gt; Right? So when the circumcision people walked in, Peter was sitting with the uncircumcised Gentiles &gt;&gt; and they looked around and they kind of looked at him and said, &gt;&gt; you know, walked by and sat down together. So Peter said, "Excuse me." Um, and he walked away and sat with them. &gt;&gt; And Paul saw it one day, &gt;&gt; said, "Are you that carnal?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Having started in grace and now go back to works again. Let me say this church. &gt;&gt; Are we that carnal that we started in the grace of God, in the joy of God? Now go back to works again. God forbid. &gt;&gt; Give grace to someone else. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to myself. That's always there. &gt;&gt; And but you but let's just move on a little bit. I want to just spend a little time on this. Look at the we talked about the marriage yesterday and uh the two shall become one. I show a great mystery. He said, Paul said, I I love that Ephesians part and he sets it in order so that you needn't even question about it. But he sets it in order. And and the two shall become one. Yet really what we realize a union of husband wife is a great thing. But what really is the glory of the husband wife is the family that comes into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They begin to glorify or bring shame or disgrace. Many times that happens as well. And uh yet the children is what binds a family together. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd imagine there's many of people maybe that would get to that place and being that we're in the age now uh we we've gone I would say this respectfully and and been around long enough that I know that after the message to the age after the messenger's gone little by little little things begin to seep in among what we call message believers &gt;&gt; and all of them are there to dilute the sincerity and the reality Satan has but one motive just to dilute it a little bit because to move one part of the word that's all it takes then the next thing do you know what the first lie you ever told was hard &gt;&gt; but the second one came easier &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; the third one came so and you got there's people that actually tell lies actually believing their own lie &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; they're convinced the truth just tell it often enough. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Do you ever tell a story about how big the fish was you caught? &gt;&gt; Like some of my good brothers that said, "Don't let truth stand on the way of a good fish story." &gt;&gt; But you know what? They grow every time. Ah, you know what? You wouldn't believe it. What? Well, you you should have seen what we caught. It was probably like that. But it's something about nature. Brother Bram tells himself on himself. He said, you know, uh I I exaggerate. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It it's true. Some people extremely exaggerate. Some have a little bit more modified way of doing things. But but but there is something about exaggeration that that now if you're going to exaggerate and if we get let's talk about the Lord, how great he is. how how he's going how he's he's watched over me. He oh man down there in the pit, &gt;&gt; but he never left me. &gt;&gt; And I and and uh I don't know what it was. This was this morning I was dreaming about Daniel being in the lions that I don't even know why. I don't know what what I was thinking about. It was very short, but all I remember him being in the hole and then afterward uh you know the king looking in there and uh and I I wonder how did they get Daniel out of there in the dream? How did they get out of them? How do they Well, there must have been a way underneath there where they got in there to the to let the lions out. Then I woke up. So, I don't know what that means. But the thing is, how do you get sometimes into a situation where you say, "How do I get out of this?" &gt;&gt; The same way you got in, &gt;&gt; make it right. Turn around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sell all you have. If if if it gets in the way like like brother brother Paul you're talking sometimes it takes bankruptcy &gt;&gt; to make you appreciate &gt;&gt; oh yeah I've been when I first started ministering and let me put it this now I'm going talk about myself but let me talk about the grace of God &gt;&gt; that called me &gt;&gt; listen when God called me to preach it was by dreams and by understanding and by revelation there was no church supporting me. There's no financial backing. &gt;&gt; I sold what I had and I had a wife and two children. Or did I have three? Oh, yes, she came up three. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good time. Thanks, honey. David was born then already. You were. I had nothing. But in the in the vision, and I say this uh all my life, I've been a dreamer. But you know what? Dreams are awfully dangerous, &gt;&gt; right? until I heard what Brother Bam said, how to handle them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If they're scriptural, watch it. If you don't understand them, leave them alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's a I'm sure some of you would have hand said, "Do you dream a lot?" Hell, I do. &gt;&gt; I dream a lot. Maybe it's because my mind is always busy. It is. It is one of those things. I I have the hardest time falling asleep. My mind's always going. I'm either preaching or I'm standing. Oh, I'd like to say it this way. Some of my best sermons I've ever preached is it while I'm going to bed. &gt;&gt; Oh, and it flows. And brain, you know what I'm talking about. Sometimes you get a you oh, you get like an anointing. Uh you sleep there and say, "Oh, if I could just bring this the way it's come to to the church this morning, there would be a revival." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you get behind the pulpit and then it's uh oh yeah, this one has this spirit. That one has that spirit. This one has that spirit. This is that. And that's what it is. makes it a church, a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask us all to have the same problem, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But there's something though when you go through it. You talk about financial sometimes financial trouble can be big. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can be real hard. And I remember when I sold all I had. I think I had maybe about $500 in my pocket after I I sold my truck and I knew I was on the way. What are you going to do? I'm going to tell how the fire got lit. I didn't have a deep message. I just wanted to go tell that God had sent a prophet &gt;&gt; and that I was a believer of this message and I just wanted to go tell. That's what I did. Made the rounds. Found little churches along the way. I knew that because they used to come to our camp and different little house meetings for years and years, 10 years as an evangelist. There's always more month than money. That's what it was. &gt;&gt; It talked to my wife said many times we had to scrape and get pennies just to get milk for the children. &gt;&gt; But I was never happier in my life because I knew I was in the will of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. As you get older and and things change. I thank him for that. But I never will forget &gt;&gt; the making up of the trust of God. When you've done all to stand, then just stand there and wait. God's heard your prayer. If it's sincere and you're not got the right motive, you're not trying to get rich. I never thought of anything like that. Riches is not the purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, the richest people many times have hardly two nickels to run together. But if you're rich in Christ, &gt;&gt; if you're rich in Christ and your heart burns daily for the Lord and you know that you're walking in this light, &gt;&gt; but it's the discernment of it. What have you heard the prophet say? And what is your discernment of what he's been saying? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what's important. Where are we standing now? See, and in our homes, see, but sin has a separates us and and in the new birth and as I was I was thinking before, one day when this all is over now, the work on earth is done and our our and the rapture takes place, do you know he's going to renovate this earth and set it up so that we can come back and spend eternity here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Hebrews says they're waiting on us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. But they're waiting on us. Maybe you some of you want to be a farmer. You want to be this and said when we get wait till it's perfect again all the disasters there'll be no more hail and no more storms. There'll be no more tornadoes. There'll be no more mudslides and look at look at the world over right now. If you if you're if you're like me every once in a while I get on the YouTube and and uh by the way I I should say something about that too. But uh I'll be very careful. All of the devices all right but they have a limitation. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with a new car, sister, new what do you get? There's nothing wrong with any new house. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with the things, computer, internet. They're all inventions &gt;&gt; from the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But they are not eternal. &gt;&gt; And they'll pass away with the using. And AI, what you think is so intelligent now, hasn't even got close to where what we see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? The the intelligence of a real true believer, the smallest young person here could literally set a a theologian &gt;&gt; back on a seat. &gt;&gt; At one time, Brother Bam gets a little that little bit excited behind the and he's talking about said why I couldn't make their head spin. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Said just a minute. I I didn't mean to say it. Lord, forgive me. Said I couldn't make anybody's head spin, but he said the Lord could. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew with the revelation that he had, he spoke lipto ear with God. &gt;&gt; God spoke lip to ear with his prophet &gt;&gt; and said, "Go tell the people what I think of them. &gt;&gt; Go take this message to the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't don't take money, women, or or or popularity. Watch those three. But they you need them. &gt;&gt; Do you ever What good would it be if you had no if nobody had confidence in his ministry? &gt;&gt; Yeah. But you know, there's some of us that would lay down our life for that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it's thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not some just a little something that we made up or some good stories. No sir. It's thus sayith the Lord. See, and that's the that's where how we raise our family here. I want to just close with this. Discerning the Lord's body. And you know, and this is the age Matthew 24. I said about deception before, but did you ever see an age more perverted than this age? &gt;&gt; I I we when we were kids, you didn't hear the names and the words they got today. &gt;&gt; There's a whole new volume of of words and interpretations and and uh uh some of the the latest things. Uh uh here the other day, somebody called me bro. Well, of course I'm looking around. All right. What's wrong with brother? Oh, but it's short. Yeah, I know we I know we spell BR O. I mean, that's fine. I just never heard it before. You Oh, bro. There's a few things I haven't heard yet. &gt;&gt; But I'm thinking, oh, okay. &gt;&gt; I wonder where that started from. Amen. Bro, hey, [Applause] something's a little bit wrong. &gt;&gt; Where did it come from that I don't know what I am? Whether I'm a male or a female, I don't know what I am. Where do you think that came from? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where do you think all the language changes of this age taking on a slang? &gt;&gt; Right. There are things we use as slang and I hey and I I probably do it myself. Not willingly, but I'm I'm not trying to say they're wrong because in Christ we also recognize that we're neither male nor female. &gt;&gt; Sisters, you got the same Holy Ghost that your husband has. &gt;&gt; Same Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Your ministry on earth is different &gt;&gt; and your position on earth is different. but in Christ. And when we get over there, there'd be neither male nor female. Yet, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; in the souls as they came running, women and men, they were every bit women, every bit men, &gt;&gt; but the sex glands were gone. &gt;&gt; And there was no more reproduction by the sex glands. &gt;&gt; It was spoken word children, &gt;&gt; what God intended to do in the beginning. But how could else could he have been a savior, a healer, a deliverer, a king, a shepherd, a judge? How could he be all these attributes delayed in him waiting there to be delivered and loosed? But now we see them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we see them clearly. All of his attributes been expressed. &gt;&gt; Right. Turn to the very last one. Now you say, "What about who is he? What's he what's he uh to the people that don't accept him?" Well, he's their judge. &gt;&gt; He's their jury. &gt;&gt; Just like he's our judge and our jury unto righteousness. So he's a judge and jury unto unrighteousness. He'd have one plea. He said, "Did you hear my word when I spoke it?" &gt;&gt; "Well, I heard it, but I didn't listen." &gt;&gt; There's your judgment then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man will condemn you. &gt;&gt; No woman will condemn you. &gt;&gt; But let me close with this thought here. But in all of this, you as parents, I'm thinking since we had the wedding, let me just close a little bit on closing that. parents, you've got a tremendous opportunity &gt;&gt; to raise sons and daughters for God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Teach them truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No matter how it hurts, &gt;&gt; because truth is the only thing that will prevail. Not my word, but God's truth. &gt;&gt; Tell them the truth in love. you you've got to raise the children uh in the midst of what we call all these perversions, wisdom, weakness, unbelief. It's all over. See, and and yet in all of that, think of this age of all of the all of the ages that God had taken a bride out of the most sinful, perverted, twisted minds. So that great theologians in the universities of the teaching class don't even know what they are anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're teaching children that they shouldn't know what they are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Chaos. &gt;&gt; Completely twisted so far. And they were once made in the image of God &gt;&gt; and now twisted so by Satan's gradual deviation. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. I say this, a little clip came up on the YouTube and one of our prime ministers way back when I was a young man, they proudly declared him to be the one that declared the same-sex marriages and it became law in Canada as a hero. &gt;&gt; A hero of perversion. Any animal is smarter than that. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All of God's creation is smarter than that. Only man who's made in the image of God has so been so deluded by wisdom, &gt;&gt; right? by technology, &gt;&gt; by twisting the truth, by operations of truth, by operations taking away, taking the power of God and twisting the minds of the people so much that today you hardly blame, and I'm going to say that, hear me right. You hardly blame men and women for not getting married anymore. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because there's a divorce on the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. within five years if they don't agree on this and and there's and the responsibility it's so awful now that let's say 50% of of the people that get married now within five years are divorced &gt;&gt; that's the ones that get married &gt;&gt; but the ones that just live together &gt;&gt; common law &gt;&gt; and it's the easy way around it &gt;&gt; yes it is &gt;&gt; say well yeah all that twisted I don't know what religion to believe and so But God has a word. &gt;&gt; He said marriage is honorable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said earlier, it's not an agreement. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not a marriage license. It's a covenant. &gt;&gt; Your marriage, my marriage to Jesus Christ is not just a document. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or religion or had a title such Methodist, Baptist, or Pentecost. It doesn't have a title. It's born of the spirit. &gt;&gt; When they asked brother, said, "What church do you belong to?" You said none said then what what what where where you at? Said I was born into a kingdom. &gt;&gt; And when we're born into a kingdom, we become part of that kingdom. &gt;&gt; You are the kingdom then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jude, I think put it about the best. I won't read it, but you read it when you get home. He put it about how debauchery it would become at the end time. And if you know, it's a short little book before Revelations. read it and see how degrading it would become by the end till God finally said it's over. &gt;&gt; Do you know in 1964 when brother Brand was here? He said I used to call it the church. He said he said but I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. They could never kill him again as a person. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; he was once he was once here and I had a a real kind of a blessing something. You know you how it is when you listen to the tape sometimes you hear something special. I you hear it over and over again but I heard something the other day it was so beautiful in a little message called influence. Brother Abraham talks about Isaiah and you know the prophet and how he's influenced and but then he comes to the place he said you know do you know Jesus you know why God became flesh and blood so that he could fully understand &gt;&gt; what sin was &gt;&gt; he could fully understand what it means to be challenged by the temptation that becomes to a human being. &gt;&gt; But he stopped on one little spot that I really loved. He said, "You know what? when you're misunderstood in life. How many of you wives have ever been misunderstood by your husband? Don't even raise your hand or vice versa. &gt;&gt; How many times you've been misunderstood at work, at school, wherever you go, or you're just a religious threat. No. How many He said, "When you're misunderstood, remember Jesus was misunderstood." &gt;&gt; Oh, that blessed me. I said, 'I'm so glad, Lord, &gt;&gt; that you knew the very smallest thing. We think, oh, well, we're misunderstood. No, there's much that goes with being misunderstood. &gt;&gt; You ever try to do something right and you know it's right, but you're misunderstood as a husband, as a wife, as children. Maybe your parents misunderstand you. Sometimes everybody misunderstands &gt;&gt; your boss at work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're trying to, you know, you said it right, but he understood it wrong. That's true. I just read that part here. It's it's not by what we read or hear. It's what our understanding is. Our discernment is of what we hear and read. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and you see the age that we're coming in when we're talking these things. We're not talking about that. Hey, it's over right now. Look, I we thought Brother Brand was when Brother Bram died, we thought the rapture was going to take place. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We didn't even think that Brother Bram would die. &gt;&gt; I'm saying we I was there. We were followers of this measure with all our heart in ' 65. When he died, it was beyond our belief. We said, "Ah, he'll rise up again. &gt;&gt; Oh, he couldn't die. It's not finished." &gt;&gt; But God said it was finished. &gt;&gt; And then God blinded the world &gt;&gt; by the way he died. &gt;&gt; And right out of there looking is the promise of the word takes the prophet off the scene. Even so now they cannot deny the first and second pull. Even denominations today, you you ask any man, was brother a prophet? Did he have visions? Did he have miracles inside? Oh, he said there was a nothing greater than in in all of in all of life than the ministry of William Brham's divine healing ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They knew that when he stood there and began to discern the thoughts, the intents of the heart, that wasn't a man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. when he told them where they come from, what they come for, and why they were here, and what they should have done or shouldn't didn't do. &gt;&gt; They knew he was a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, they have to find an answer. Brother Bram said, "Let it go 50 years and they'll start saying, "Oh, Brother Brham was a man, mighty man of God." Within 50 years, I noticed it because I lived long enough. I said, "Uhoh, now they're beginning to say he was a man of God." But &gt;&gt; God loved him so much that he took him out of the way because he went off the word at the end. When he went to the third pull, yeah, he went off the word as far as they're concerned. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But that's when the word caught the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when the word caught the bride. &gt;&gt; She's not she's not deceived. &gt;&gt; Oh no, &gt;&gt; she's not blind. She's not walking in blindness. She's walking in the light. And you notice when brother Bam got gone to that third pole, he said, "Now remember this is not to the world." &gt;&gt; I I would like to spread it to the whole world. &gt;&gt; He said, "I was so excited." He said, "Watch the first pull, second pull." He said, "This third pull, don't try to explain it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you hear ministers try to explain the third pull alto together, be careful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Be careful. There's an element of revelation that lays there waiting for God as it unfolds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be ahead of God. &gt;&gt; Just stay right with him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's an element of revelation that goes with the revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it moves on and we're right in it now. We've been there. Be very careful. We as ministers, we we we stir ourselves up daily. I I'm fading off the scene, but you younger ministers, watch. Because what little bit we sow, right or wrong, we picked up on our grandchildren. &gt;&gt; And if it's off a little bit, by the look, when you fire a rifle and you go 25 yards, you know, they tell you to start with about 25 yards because you're bound to hit the target in 25 yards. Or if it's off a quarter of an inch, you shoot a couple of times. Yeah. Quarter an inch to the left. You turn it. They said, "Ah, yeah, there it is. Right on." Now I got zero but a little bit to the left a little bit but it's only quarter inch. Now you put it 200 yards and you lay it there again and shoot the same way you'd be about four inches off &gt;&gt; out of the range. Anything that's more than a quarter or tw you don't you go back to the drawing board. &gt;&gt; Listen what we plant what we plant in our homes our children reap. So plant right, husband and wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ring of fire is stirring. You know that when brother Bam talks about the ring of fire said, "Look at all that." It's it's any thing. And even this morning while we're here, while we're sitting here, do you know we've never been closer to a nuclear war than we are right now? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says it'll only take one fanatic one of these days. &gt;&gt; Yes. and put a finger on the trigger of nuclear weaponry. &gt;&gt; And if you notice the attitude and he says this, I believe that God raised up Russia to drop a bomb on the Vatican and on America. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what he says. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The seventh vision was annihilated was a he said it was a burnt over ashes. &gt;&gt; He says as far as I could see. &gt;&gt; Yes. Do you know there's a man right now on the earth, his name is Putin &gt;&gt; in Russia &gt;&gt; who's being stroked the wrong way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; By our greatest politicians and by by the world. It's going to get him angry one of these days. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But there's got to be a bride that leaves here before that happens. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Do you see where we're sitting? &gt;&gt; You see where we're positionally placed? It's a glorious church &gt;&gt; without spot or wrinkle. She's washed in the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; It's a glorious church without spot or wrinkle. She's washed in the blood of the lamb. Let the musicians come up. Let me sing that once. It's a glorious church without spar wrinkle. She's washed in the blood of the lamb. Oh, it's a glorious church without spot wrinkle cuz she's washed in the blood of the lamb. It's a glorious church without a wrinkle. Cuz she's walked in the blood of the lamb with the glorious church without spot. Walk in the blood of the lamb. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid out somewhere beyond the blue. All the angels beckon to me from heaven. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know that I have no like you. If heaven is not my home, then Lord, what would I do? the angel back from and I can't feel that home [Applause] [Music] just over in glory land eternally. The saints of every hand they're shouting victory. The sound of sweetest praise rings back heaven shore and I can't anymore [Music] the angels [Music] and I feel at home in this world and Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you today for your goodness. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; this world is truly not our home. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for all the blessings and those things. We do not take them for granted, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We thank you. &gt;&gt; And if there's any needy person here, Lord, let them anchor their soul &gt;&gt; in the haven of rest. Lord, &gt;&gt; there's someone that's never known you in the power of your resurrection. They don't know what it's like to be born of the spirit. Lord, if there's a thirst in their heart, quicken it. Bring them to life. Take away the guilt. Let the blood of Jesus Christ wash them whiter than the driven snow. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; If there's others that are sick and body, maybe parents struggling financially, domestic problems, home problems. The nation that we're in, Lord, is hardly a a church, a nation that isn't affected through many dangerous toils and snares. We have already come. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But it's grace that brought us safe thus far. &gt;&gt; And grace will lead us through &gt;&gt; when we've been there 10,000 years, bright, shining as the sun, we'll have no less days to sing God's praise &gt;&gt; than when we first begun. Bless this tabernacle. The pastors, the deacons, the trustee, the musicians, the laborers, the moms, the dads, the children. Let the power of the resurrection be their daily meat. &gt;&gt; Feed them with things that that's pure and holy of this message. Lord, &gt;&gt; we know where to go. This little bride has the devil's answer. &gt;&gt; She knows. She's set on Christ, the solid rock. All other sand is sinking sand. &gt;&gt; All other ground &gt;&gt; is sinking sand. &gt;&gt; As the writer said, "My hope is built on nothing less." &gt;&gt; That's where I stand, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, if we're wrong, correct us. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; chasen us severely, Lord, till we line up with your word for your love. Lord, &gt;&gt; I'd rather be chasened by you &gt;&gt; than by the devil, Lord. chasing us in your own way. Bring us into subjection in every way. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we might never quite meet like this again. &gt;&gt; But it's been good to be here, Lord, &gt;&gt; this weekend with this le lady. And I pray that you'll bless all your children as we separate from this building today. May you be in every home, and every situation &gt;&gt; as I commit them to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus love and his righteousness. I cannot trust the street, but holy, [Music] but on Christ rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All the ground is stand. God bless you. It's been good to be here. I thank my brother for I didn't feel like it was a privilege at first, but I glad I did. You know how it always is. The flesh is weak, but the spirit is growing. I want to honor one family. Where's Brother Paul at? Did he Did he leave already? big as life. There you are. God bless you for your you got your 44th year coming up. God bless you. Doesn't seem like maybe I got to tell a little something. We were very happy when he was born. He was life in our grandma and grandpa's home. Paul, you were very important then. You still are important. Love you. Love your family. Love you all. You're all part of the family of God. God bless you. Pray for us in Saskatoon. We pray for you here. Shalom. God bless you. Love you. Hey. Amen. You know, something else that I forgot to mention and I really want to um is that we have uh in our midst, we know that it's Christ that we celebrate. But in just an in honorable mention, we have two of the believers, the original believers music group in our midst here, brother Menel Fzen and brother Abe Dole. Certainly thankful to have you here, brother A. Now, I don't know if Brother Abees sang, but I certainly know he played the steel guitar. And unfortunately, we don't have one here. Otherwise, we'd be asking for a special, but just wanted to mention it, brother. God richly bless you. We're certainly honored to have you with us, Brother Gourd. Thank you for bringing him and each and everyone for making the effort to come out today. Did Did you hear from your theophony today? &gt;&gt; Did you hear from the Lord? You know, I heard one thing today and I'm sure we all did. I think it's so important. This is the only part that I'm going to preach and then I I believe we've got some time. So, I want to sing. But, you know, the one thing that I heard I heard it three distinct maybe even four, but at least three times. It's the only thing that really matters is what is our discernment of what is being said. &gt;&gt; So, what did we hear today? What did we hear today? I I heard that, you know what? There's a madman on the throne in Russia that a prophet declared when it was still called USSR. &gt;&gt; Watch Russia, the king of the north. And here we have that madman. Brother Brandham says one day someone will just have one too many sips of vodka and push the button. But we heard we heard today that before that happens, the bride goes home. What a privilege that is. &gt;&gt; What's our discernment of hearing that? &gt;&gt; That's why we preach get the Holy Ghost because without the Holy Ghost, we're going to be in those ashes. &gt;&gt; We're going to live through that or die through it. &gt;&gt; But to have the Holy Ghost, we will actually be in that rapture. And you know, that's the only way we'll be in that rapture. There ain't no other interpretations. The vindicated prophetic utterance to this age was get the Holy Ghost so that you don't have to. &gt;&gt; He's not going to judge his bride. His bride has already been judged. She judged herself according to the word. &gt;&gt; And because of that, she's given discernment about what that prophet said. My goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Can we sing that song? Let's talk about Jesus. We okay to sing for a few minutes. &gt;&gt; If anybody feels pressured that you do need to go, you're certainly welcome to. We certainly don't judge here. Um, remember we've got a potluck for those people who don't have somewhere to go for lunch. Just uh ask one of us before you leave here. I know that there's another gathering on on the the Boyer side and we're certainly sad because we're not going to fellowship over lunch, but you know, we had some spiritual lunch this morning. So, we're certainly thankful. &gt;&gt; Is that Sister Pamela back there? &gt;&gt; Sister Pamela Kronhite. God bless you. Did you bring your husband? No, he's not here. God bless you. It's good to see you. Let's talk about Jesus. Let's talk about Jesus, the King of Kings. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, [Applause] heat, heat. Oh, [Music] [Applause] heat, heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music] Amen. Can we sing down on the cross &gt;&gt; where my savior died? &gt;&gt; Oh, down on the cross is where my savior.

Let's just bow in prayer one more time. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, it's been good to be here with you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that we had a man speak to us, but we know the inspiration behind that man is you. &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful, Lord Jesus, that we believe in a five-fold ministry that you have ordained for your church, Lord. Not for the idea of getting together a great organization, but for the perfecting of the saints, Lord. That is your word. And we're so thankful for your direction. We're so thankful for your leadership, Lord. Thank you for the direction in the homes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, for the husband's position, &gt;&gt; for the wives position, for the children's position, in the church, Lord Jesus, all of the positions. We know that you're a God of order, and we're so thankful that you've given us direction for that, Lord. Help us Lord Jesus to understand that we cannot understand. The only way that we can understand the word for our day is by your spirit living out through us, discerning that word. Lord, help us to surrender our will to die out to ourselves. Oh father, as your prophet said to us in the invisible union to write a bill of divorcement to ourselves so that you could live inside of us so that our old husband could be dead. &gt;&gt; Oh father, that we don't live in an adulterous existence thinking that we're saved and we're actually lost. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord, to surrender our lives fresh unto you every single day of our lives. Lord, let us die to ourselves daily as Paul said that you will live. &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, we pray for brother Menow and sister Irene that you would just continue to pour yourself out to them and through them. Lord, bless them abundantly. Father, bless their marriage of 63 years, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What a privilege. What a blessing. Lord, we pray for the saints back in Saskatoon at Saskatoon Tabernacle. Lord, we just stand with Brother Dwayne and Sister Connie and all the saints there, Father, that you would strengthen them and encourage them all. Bless them abundantly, Father. Lord Jesus, we thank you for all the brothers and sisters who have gathered here from the many different churches around the world. Father, bless them abundantly as well. And all of our visitors, Father, if there's anybody here that doesn't know you in the power of your resurrection, the way that we're speaking, Father, I pray right now that they would desire to know you that way. Father, that they would decide to surrender their will for the first time maybe ever, Lord, and allow you to manifest yourself. We know that you're a gentleman. &gt;&gt; You don't want to abuse your wife. &gt;&gt; You want to love her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful for your love, Lord. &gt;&gt; Today, we just want to commit each life now into your hands as we go our separate ways. &gt;&gt; Father, help us to keep you as the central theme of every aspect of our lives. Lord, &gt;&gt; we love you and we thank you for your goodness. We just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song? I think it's Psalms 34 as we dismiss today. I sought the Lord. [Music] I sought the Lord. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Music] Oh, [Music] heat, heat.
