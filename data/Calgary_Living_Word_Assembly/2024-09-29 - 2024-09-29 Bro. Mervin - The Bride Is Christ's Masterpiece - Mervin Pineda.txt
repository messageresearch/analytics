and savior I surrender all can we sing we are standing on Holy Ground we are standing [Music] on Holy [Music] Ground and I know that there are angels all around so let us pray Jesus [Applause] now we are standing inpr on Holy Ground amen are you happy this morning amen are you fully surrendered amen we might not be but uh I hope by the end of the service we will fully be surrendered to him amen uh while you're standing maybe if we can read one scripture and I will let you sit and I'll just uh I have few slides this morning uh but lots of notes so maybe if we can be with me I mean uh as I put myself uh away or or set aside uh uh that God will use my lips amen I I have a little topic here little but lots you can say little is much when God is in it amen amen the bride is Christ Masterpiece this is about us right so uh that's the topic but then let's read this verse although although it's a bit uh bar brandham didn't use this uh scripture but I I was just uh led to to use this because uh Proverbs 29:18 says where there is no vision the people perish he did but he that keepeth the law happy is he amen let's bow our hearts this morning again oh Lord Jesus we ask that you have uh bless blessing amen upon the reading of your word and Lord with this little gathering we know we are full this morning oh Lord may you speak Lord just use me Lord lips of clay You Are The Potter yes I am just the clay I am just your mouthpiece this uh this morning oh Lord may you speak through me oh Lord I want to set aside myself I know it's been a while and I ask that you settle my nerves Lord and that you will speak through me and Bless the people we ask that you you'll be in control of all things now have preeminence from start to finish Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen you may be seated okay the my the thought that came to me is uh uh while while reading the Masterpiece we know some might be or most of the people here right now are believers some might not be believing this message yet but uh you know just a summary of the message we're not believing anything except Jesus Christ himself amen and uh we might be saying a lot about the quotes from BR Branham which is the message of the hour right we know the word is the absolute but the absolute is in the message of the hour amen amen so just to be clear that uh we're not cult right we believe the message of the hour which is Christ in us the hope of glory when you see each and every one of us it's Christ in brother Berry it's Christ in brother Paul their wives their families it's Christ in you amen the hope of glory so the last time I preached uh my topic was uh full restoration by the full word but then it's just like a continuation you can say uh because the bride is restored to become Christ Masterpiece amen because the first Masterpiece we know it's Adam he fell but you know Adam is not only man he's male and female he was created Created he them but then you can see that uh Adam was taken from the side of Adam he was his sman right it was preached before how come Adam uh restored Eve he has a lot of ribs why not just took a why why didn't he just take another rib there and then replace Adam or or replace Eve but he he didn't do that he loved ad uh Eve so much that uh he wanted to restore her amen amen amen but you know that uh the fall came when F didn't come when when Eve was in Adam that's right amen but then when she oh when he was smitten and Eve was a separate being then that's the time she fell but because of Love knowingly right just I'm giving a background here that uh the Masterpiece of God is a masterpiece a masterpiece family amen it cannot be complete without a bride and a bridegroom amen so that's why uh we'll continue uh the the previous uh the next slide please just a summary of what uh we have uh talked about last last time I know this is a busy slide but it has a lot of nuggets in it and it Encompass the whole message of the hour and it's a St nature of a perfect man right and to be perfect we know it goes through process but then it's a whole thing it's not partial once you receive the Holy Ghost and you're sealed you're sealed right amen don't be don't be uh uh uh tossed to and fro thinking that you don't have the Holy Ghost where in fact you have it amen because in simple terms what's the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost you have the ability to receive the word for your day remember that for your day because it's not the most uh it's not the word of Moses that will lead us to Perfection or to Rapture it's not the words of Moses it's not the words of David it's not the words of the prophets previous prophets but we have the word for our day that's the reason why we believe what we believe amen because it's present tense word of the hour amen it will lead to uh to Perfection amen so you can see here it's a it's a stature stature of a perfect man amen and uh it goes through a process until Jesus and the bride will be one right so so next slide thinking thinking that uh uh so that we can thank the Lord Our God for his grace and mercy you can see from eternity to Eternity what does the mind of God uh what is the mind of God basically you can see here from eternity to Eternity we are put into time amen so just uh giving a background here next slide please I didn't have the clicker so you can see eternity is like a circle right it has no end and no beginning right this just a background I know you have seen this but uh not many people have seen it so might be beneficial but then you see the word is always fresh right when we when we preach it although we have seen it oh I've seen that but then when when it's being tackled in detail we would know that it's important and we we might know the message of the hour 1200 tapes 1200 messages but then how come the pastor still preaching here how come ministers are still preaching here is to bring us to remembrance amen because Christian Living is what feeding the word prayer worship giving adoration to to our Lord Jesus Christ and knowing who we are and fellowship with one another amen so many things so just as a background here in the mind of Jesus or or or God right uh be before even time began he you know he's not even God right he's an object of worship God means object of worship but nobody uh will worship him because in the beginning he was Elohim self-existing one right so in his mind he has the attribute that he wanted to manifest in each and every one of us that's right the the main thing there is he wanted to be a Healer or or or he the first he wanted to be God but God is an object of worship so our prophet of God said he created angels first so that somebody will will worship him right but then he he saw alone right so he wanted to have a companion amen so he wanted to have someone to fellowship with that's why he created man but he not only man but man in his own image amen but then man you know man you me we cannot even uh uh keep our covenants right right because we're human beings we are born and shaping iniquity born speaking lies right we cannot even do that so what did God do he he put an unconditional Covenant through Abraham amen amen whether whether you're a sinner or not sinner as long as you you accept him as your lord savior healer bridegroom then you can be saved you can be redeemed amen so the fall you can see here before it's eternity right Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden talking lip to ear having Fellowship in the cool of the evening right but then fall came so you can see the first thing here is eternity is like a A Perfect Circle has no beginning has has no end but then the next slide time came because of sin time means although it's very long time it's still time right Millennium it might be a thousand years but still time it's a time element but then that's not our goal only is to be in the Millennium no we want to be in eternity right because Millennium there will be some people there bar Bram said that there will be hens there and even the Bible said that right there will be hens in the Millennium but how would they go that's not the topic here but uh the point there is time came because of sin but then how can you be back to Eternity again it's because of Jesus blood right it breeds the Gap so that you can come back to Eternity again right so simple simple thing in a in a graphic form or uh you can say presentation form so that it can can be uh instilled in our minds one picture paints a thousand world uh words they're saying right so although we we speak a lot of words without uh without picture sometimes we we typically forget but then for those who who didn't accept Jesus Christ yet when when we try to evangelize or or or witness to someone we know that the blood of Jesus Christ still bleeding yes still effective and it is it Encompass everyone amen right so it's not only for believers of this message which is full Believers you can say uh we don't follow a man we follow the god of that man amen just to be clear on that okay uh the next uh slide uh just to prove the point there that uh it's a quote all right past the old Sabbath is passed Jesus raised on the eighth day that was a solemn day holy and it wasn't a day cuz day A Time had done run run out it passed into eternity see it Swang right back to the first day again so with that picture you can see it's a ring we are in time very long time but then we will go back to Eternity so eternity is like a ring you can't find no corner to it you can't find no stopping place in A Perfect Circle you go on and on I don't care how far you go you're still going you can start going around like this go through the floor go through the Earth go beyond the Earth you're still go so you can see based on that uh coat as well and even with a proper when when I see a ring here there's a it's very symbolic right uh the the picture of uh or or you can say the the backdrop of uh sister Marian uh Marian and brother tabo's wedding at Barber's places there are two rings that are interconnected so that's a sign of Eternity actually because that's Infinity amen right and the Ring The Ring represents Circle there's a purpose in it right there's a symbolic significance on it that that our God wanted us to be with him Amen in eternity we know it's a process marriage you can say it's a process right engagement right consumation honeymoon uh and then living together so I think uh brotheris and sister Marian has already gone with the honeymoon so they are now living together this is the real life now being husband and wife right living together so you will see you're not in hanimon anymore so it's uh knowing each other right so it didn't stop with honeymoon it's living together right now so why why why do I want uh or how maybe let's go to the next slide so that you can see here I I I've have taken the the thought here from from the two services from bar brandham which is the Masterpiece Masterpiece in uh when was that uh 1964 July 5th the Masterpiece and 1964 December 5th the identified Masterpiece of God they're pretty similar messages but uh uh yeah uh and they have a little bit of a different title but they're talking the same thing amen you can see it's uh in his background in in that sto in in that message is the Masterpiece of Michelangelo you know Michelangelo is a is an artist right and one of his masterpieces is the sculpture of Moses and BR Branham was saying that uh uh being an artist he has the vision first on what he wanted to do he wanted to to sculpt the Moses basically that is the thing he wanted to do so you can see as he progressed being an artist and being human you see the process right his vision first came that's why without Vision you will perish anything that you will do on uh in here uh which will be like a workshop later on I'll I'll do that anything that we want to do it must start with a vision amen hallelujah it must start from our mind amen so we will be the Mastermind of what we want to what we want to do and uh we know in a project in a project if I can put it a little bit different uh like a like a testimony in in doing projects like what I'm been doing the past 29 years 30 years there's a there's a vision or there's a purpose of what you want to achieve first it's it didn't come when okay I'll do this let's see what happens it's the end from the beginning it's always we we have a lot of Builders here Paul Barry Sister Lisa sister Ela B Dan they they they know a project means there's a beginning and an end but it's the end first first that you need to know so that you can start from the beginning right so there's a we're so thankful from eternity to Eternity so God's mind he wanted a bride of his own choosing amen right he want to create a man in his own image right that's his vision in a project for example I I'll put it home I I hope it's okay somebody might not know me but uh uh but just so that you can see that it's real thing so we have a project it's to produce oil just to simp simplify produce oil here in Alberta so we were given a mandate okay we want to produce 125,000 Barrel per day of oil so okay so now that is given as a project Charter what do you need to do now of course you have to start from the beginning you have to plan you have to you know uh check your resources is it technically feasible is it financially feasible right all those things you need to to check whether this is feasible or not but the thing is okay how come our company was able to ask for that Charter to produce 125,000 Barrel per day first thing is do you have the financial cap capability right because even though it's technically feasible because in with God nothing is impossible amen but there is feasibility right uh but in the natural world world there's some limitations do you have the money okay oh there's money oh now do you do you have the technical knowledge to do it right you will have you will place all the people that will be part of that project and then then that's the execution phase right and then at the end of the day are you going to produce 125 uh th000 Barrel per day that's the end so it means once you achieve that then your project is successful because your vision your purpose of o of of that project is achieved amen so let's put it in Michael Angelos uh or or uh uh sculpture at first he wanted Moses to be sculpt right and then during the execution what what does he need he needs marble he needs materials he need the Chisel hammer and most importantly his time right right hard work right so upon doing it says bra Bram was saying he did it for many many years I don't know how many years but then he did that day in day out but then he had a vision I want to I want to sculpt the Moses basically right but then upon doing this and thinking about his vision he doesn't have any uh picture of Moses brother brandham was saying I don't think uh Moses there there might not be cameras at that time right so so in his mind Moses might look like this so he did day in day out hard work but then when he finally shaped it with this Vision he was thinking wow it's a beautiful sculpture he considered it Masterpiece of himself but then the thing is his vision is even more than that he thought that it's so real that his might smitten the his knee BR banam was saying that made it the Masterpiece because when you checked it you can see the the the little there right uh this one is just from from the internet so you can see it but I don't know if this is it but it's just to represent whether it's true or not yeah you I think you got the picture so you can see he did it and then he Smite it he he I don't know the past tense of that sorry I'm not an English person so but anyway it was his smen right and then that made it the Masterpiece that's why when bar Branham went there he just checked it and wow and everyone is there but then the Masterpiece being the Masterpiece is must it must be put on a pedestal right so that's why I represented it that way so that you can see that it's on a foundation so that we we can see you don't put a candle under a bushel right if if if it is a light you have to put it up so that it can shed or or it can uh uh emit more light amen so it's it's like a masterpiece when it's a masterpiece you want to put it in a beautiful place amen amen so next uh slide uh 11 okay that's good we have time we have still have one hour amen so the Masterpiece of God just uh to put it so that at least Barberry has a little bit of there because there's no in between right between the foundation that's right the brotherly kindness and the love there should not be any but then it's like that put on a foundation on top of each other no mortar in between amen right until it is full sture right so in I I I suggest you you read the the master oh I mean listen to the Masterpiece those two uh two messages they're great right I'm just putting in one slide here what what it meant to me there's a lot of it we're trying to break things into pieces amen right uh because in a project if you think so much of it and you don't break it into little pieces it cannot be achievable that's why we break things we call it work breakdown system them right so so that everything that you will do can be done and there should be an owner of every task is the same as this church right amen that's right bar Barberry cannot do all right bra Paul cannot do all we need each other brothers and sisters we have a part in this body amen we have to break it down into little pieces based on our capability and the gifts that is placed in us right and and uh and you know as a whole will be a whole Masterpiece amen amen we might be in this local body right and it was preached last Wednesday the the shepherd and the Sheep right in a mystical body we know the shepherd is Jesus Christ right right and the ship is many member body in different churches but in a local body the shepherd here is the pastor we have to respect that office no matter who he is amen amen there's a there is a an authority there Spiritual Authority we're not following a man right right it's important to understand that we have to respect that Authority because if we are not under subjection of any Authority who are we believing right so what I'm saying here is we are part of that body everyone is a part of this body so just summarizing what the Masterpiece of God the message is he said he said at first his first Masterpiece is uh Adam he created man in his own image and then he was put to to uh sleep and then he was also smitten the first uh surgery that happened and then uh in in this world basically according to the Bible and then uh Eve came out of uh from the man which is Adam that's why it's called woman womb of a man man right out of the womb of a man just uh so that it's easy to to understand that it came from the womb of a man that's why it's a w a woman it's called woman and he named her Eve right so the Masterpiece because of uh at first it's so perfect he put them into Garden of Eden that's where he placed them same for for for the Masterpiece of Michelangelo it was put on a pedestal right but uh bar Branham he put it he narrated it in a way that uh the foundation is based on the Patriarchs amen right of Abraham which is Faith father of faith and Isaac love Jacob mercy and Joseph Perfection if you will read the message the Masterpiece you will find it so beautiful how he put it there amen amen but then the thing is it didn't stop there that's just the foundation amen but then the the point there is how it came to have a unconditional Covenant as compared to uh conditional one because in the beginning thou shal not do this it's a dos and don'ts right he commanded uh Adam not to eat the fruit thereof of of that three of the threee of knowledge of Good and Evil that's a commandment it means don't do this don't do that right if you don't do this then you will have eternal life but if you do this you will you will you know uh against it you will you will fall so it's conditional but then God found out thatth man really we're hard-headed right I I'm the most hard-headed person you can say but then the thing is because of the grace of God he puts us in L and yeah you might you might be better Christian than me but uh the good thing is uh we are we want to be subjected with the word amen and uh with that he put because of his love for for his Masterpiece he wanted to restore yes sure right and and then he put that Restoration in a process amen so you can see the foundation is based on Abraham which is Faith Isaac love Jacob mercy and Joseph Perfection so it means you cannot put something on a pedestal when your pedestal itself or your foundation is not right amen anything that you build right if it's is if the foundation is wrong you cannot do it it will just collapse we have just a story here uh something coming up so bear with me here I'll just share and I I want to relax you know brother brandham the the uh the message the identified Masterpiece he he the second one he uh he preach it after three months more than three months so that is his first time he's saying that uh he's been out of the pulpit for three months and then he was nervous so I'm nervous too because uh so bear with me I just want to be relaxed because I know we're brothers and sisters and if I say something that is wrong forgive me in the first place but I just want to feel relaxed and then the Lord can can use this uh presentation here so in this Foundation it must be perfect so it based on you can see it he didn't put do you have the clicker brother I mean uh so that I can it is here no I mean the the pointer maybe just so at least it's not difficult yeah so you can see here he didn't put he didn't put the Masterpiece on Abraham because Abraham is not perfect right nobody's perfect but then the thing is in terms of their uh uh sorry I'll just put this year okay now it's good so you can see here the first one is Abraham right he didn't put right away the Masterpiece on top of Abraham he has to go through a a process here and it's by the Patriarchs and Isaac we know is the next because he's he's uh portrayed us uh father of Love here by BR Bram because uh uh it's like Abraham being God and then he wanted to sacrifice Isaac right it's it's the same as God wanted to sacrifice Christ right Jesus Christ for our Salvation amen so he's a god of he is the father of love and then Jacob Mercy because he's a deceiver so we are all born in born in sin safe and iniquity that's why we need Mercy right we need Grace from the Lord right because Faith cometh by hearing but then it's not by our works so righteousness but by his grace alone that's why we cannot say we know the message of the hour that's why I'll be saved it's not knowledge brothers and sisters right we know it's Revelation and it's a life amen and then come Joseph Joseph we know his story he's just like a perfect person whatever he touches it prospers right but then the thing is the only uh floww of Joseph here bar Bram is saying and I checked it in the Bible is when he said that uh uh because he's the is the right hand of pharaoh right he's the governor of Egypt and then he wanted his family the whole family to come to to Egypt and then he told them specifically tell the phoh that you are cattle Racers right right not uh so that uh but in fact they are they are uh they've been uh uh you know uh cattle cattle Racers anyhow because I checked the he I did Joseph really told the LIE right did he did he tell a lie no he he didn't but then the thing is strategically he said he wanted the family to tell them to to uh to be cattle Racers rather than Shepherds so that they can be put in a special place which is gosan because in the mind of Joseph he didn't want them to be mingling right with the Egyptians so they were in gsan right they were because they are cattle Racers so that's the only thing bar branam is saying that uh that is not perfect in Joseph but then he has a good intention and uh he didn't tell a lie right but he didn't say exactly that they are Shepherds uh or they are Shepherds because shepherds are Abomination among Egyptians and I checked also why they are Abominations there are so many things they're saying because oh farming is a low low class uh work uh because they they are nomadic people and so on and so forth what but whatever it is whatever the reason it's an Abomination to the Egyptians because the word says so right I I I don't want to I don't want to think otherwise because the word says so so so be it right because if we believe that the word is the absolute and if it says whether we we know it or not we'll just accept it we'll just believe it amen so so what happened there is Joseph is considered perfect foundation and then br Branham said let's see I think uh it's in in the quote here let's uh you can see I want to show you here that after Joseph the restoration comes through the prophets and these prophets are we know a lot of prophets Moses David Elijah John the Baptist BR Branham and the bride why is the bride here in this uh in this level here or in this class which is called the body BR Bram was saying that as as the body let me let me just check it I think it is in 59 uh maybe if you can I didn't put the the thing here in the Masterpiece brother 1964 July 5th bear with me here I just want to put this as a as a foundation in our discussion here uh uh okay bear with me okay okay amen the body okay okay right with me here it'll be there okay sorry about that I will I'll just uh okay anyhow while while I'm looking for it brother brandham is saying before Christ came to be the perfect Masterpiece the body was uh was formed by prophets right uh I have the the quote there but uh cannot find it here but it's there while while we're looking for it what does that mean so it means we are given this word which is the word of God we are not God but the word of God through US amen and we have believed all throughout the days even in the Old Testament that the word of God comes through prophets right and then that's the reason why we believe what we believe we believe that God sent Malachi 4 right 5 and six to be the Prophet Elijah for this day the forthcoming of Elijah and then he handed over to us a message that will what that will that we will prophesy again so just just want to read that uh I'll uh amen it's it's it's so important to to understand that uh that uh we were given this message is not to be only staying here and and be fed all throughout there is an action that is required from us am because the thing is he said in in Revelation 10 11 to 12 brother if if we can read it uh so that at least uh amen we can put a good uh foundation on it Revelations 10 11-2 yeah you can open it I think yeah well while we're waiting okay and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen so and then 11:12 uh uh verse 12 is okay that that that's it right so yeah okay so there is a there is a require uh there is an action that we need to do here we don't only need to feed the word accept the message and then you know live happily ever after without doing anything because the thing is the message of the hour is so full that it was tked to us so that we can feed it and then when full when we are full of it we have to share it amen because we need to impart eternal life what BR Bram is saying is a greater work we might let's say we want to get married right if that's our purpose let's say right we're talking about Masterpiece uh I have uh different examples here if we want to get married that's our vision right being young young man for example our vision is okay I will have a great family that is serving the lord financially stable all these things and whatnot that's the vision of typical man typical young man amen so to make that happen you have to do some actions too right you have to plan you have to plan but then the thing is your your vision is to have a good life who who doesn't want good life here amen we we we want all good life we want to be all financially stable all our children uh serving the lord all our uh uh loved ones amen amen that's a very good uh very good desire but then let's come to the point let's say I'm a young man and I wanted to marry a uh to to marry to get married so the action I just want to put it into three things Vision action and result okay Vision First my vision is to get married right if I want to get married what's the action that I will take of course I have to look for a bride right also right the bride to be so that's one of the actions so I have to have the Holy Ghost because the prophet of God said uh you must have the Holy Ghost before you you get married right and then all this checklist right but then the thing is I've been telling when when you you're full with the word of God then you wanted to impart it that's right right right so the thing is whoever your bride is if your vision you wanted it to manifest as you've envisioned it then you have to do the proper actions amen you have to follow the instructions in the message of the hour right because uh uh the prophet of God will not give us any instruction that will not be good for us amen because he said if I'm telling you something that is out of the word forget about it that's right his ministry will be in vain if he will not put us back in line with the word but then the thing is something can happen within that action but you wanted it to be perfect so you have to do the right action you have to work on it work on our own if if if we need the Holy Ghost let's make it simple we have little kids here what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost you have the ability to receive the word for your day okay how can you receive the Holy Ghost it says repent because we are all sinners and be baptized how the right baptism be baptized with the the name of the not the name of the father Son and Holy Spirit which is the Lord Jesus Christ be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right because the father is is is uh the Lord the name of the father son holy spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ so we we might think it's uh trinitarian no it's not right the compound name of of God is the Lord Jesus Christ I don't know why I went there but uh anyway amen so but the point there is you repent that's the first step because we're all Sinners yes everyone here we all we are all sinners no no no one is excused that's the reason why we need the blood of Jesus Christ so so that we can be saved but how can you how can you say that uh uh you you can be saved by not repenting right so repenting means it will change your mind amen and it will change your action right change your heart and change your action so first it will change your mind that's the number one step right when you repent once you change your mind then your heart will be also change it will be turned towards doing the right thing and then that chain of heart will manifest in your in the chains of action amen so that's why Christianity is life it's not a ritual it's not coming to church only during Sundays and Wednesdays and even prayer meetings or even worship Services it's life it's in it's instilled in our lives right right it has been said you know uh uh priorities change they said right amen but values don't that's right so being Christians we have common dyam Ator brothers and sisters we want to be we want to please the Lord we want to Worship the Lord we want to praise the Lord amen and even in worshiping I will say here can I preach a little bit yeah I just want to talk about worship we talk we think of worship it's only singing no there are other forms of worship and the most important one also is giving giving means giving everything to God amen amen right even titing for example we want to to be blessed right we want to be financially stable if if that's our vision to be financially stable then let's do what is required to be financially stable what are the requirements right in being financially stable number one is pay your tights amen why is why it is said as paying tights because it's not yours right you have to pay it back you have to give it back to the Lord because everything belongs to him amen it's not because we work so hard that's why I'm only giving this much no tights means 10% anything above that is an offering right but the tithes it's payment right although we're bringing it it's not asking you to to give uh or or or or or or to render but it he is asking for what is his it is his in the beginning amen amen so to be financially stable you have to do all those things right so so my point here is everything that we envision right we want to do it in a small piece we want to to break it down so that it's achievable amen I was thinking about let's say we want to finish a biking track the the bikers uh yesterday I guess or or the hikers they want to hike or bike uh on a certain place where they want it might be a little bit difficult or what so their vision is to finish that track right they want to finish successfully but doing that before doing that they have to prepare so what do I need to finish that track oh my bicycle must be good right I must have the skill to do biking if you don't know how to bike how can you run the Tru right so it means you have to have the skill to have that first right what do I need I need food right I need uh oh where will I park lots of planning before that would happen amen that's part of the action that you need to do right but once you're successful that's the result of what you have envisioned so now let's say a young person wanted to be good in mathematics for example I I'm putting small breakdowns here of of something achievable oh let's say I want to have 100% uh average in mathematics right so let's say maybe may maybe I think I has 100 I guess so maybe let's say he envisioned that I want 100% uh mathema uh average in my in my mathematics class or course so can he do that by just biking can he do that by just hiking amen only doing for example he loves to do mechanics mechanic thing can he do that by doing only mechanics no right you have to to plan and and and do what is related to that Vision amen so who said this I think it was Thomas said this on I guess he said genius is 1% inspiration and 90 99% perspiration what does that mean 1% oh I love I want to have 100% mathematics uh average but to do that you have to have the 99% yeah action it doesn't come overnight right you have to you have to study all those things right so there are there are it's called progression right it's called process that there's no instant thing in my case when we talk with my yeah forgive me miles and my family when we talk as a family of course they're open right so the thing is they want to have salary same as me for example miles he has one year two years experience I have 29 years experience he wanted it to have the same as me it didn't come overnight brothers and sisters right 29 years of hard labor although I came from a very poor family I'm not saying I'm rich but uh God is good God is merciful and provide all our needs but then it took a lot of work for me but my vision I remembered it's just like when I was in high school before graduating so so my English uh teacher they ask everyone it's like a Futures blueprint or whatever on what you see your what do you see yourself how do you see yourself 5 10 years from now so you have to have a right you have to write a short story about it so of course five years oh I want to have this much I I I want to have a house blah blah blah get married all these things right the they are Visions right so the thing is although although you have those Visions sometimes big Visions they cannot be achieved right away so that's why to have you have to break it down into little pieces and that's why even even climbing a ladder it's better to climb little by little rather than big climb you wanted to reach the top there's a power in small steps amen and even coming up we cannot be on the top with even spiritually without feeding the word how can you be how can you be spiritually stable without feeding the word amen I'm guilty oh Lord help me but it's better to to understand our limitations it's like brother Bram is saying everyone has complex agree but the thing is a complex is already resolved once you acknowledge that there is a complex any problem has a solution amen otherwise it's not a problem it's a fact right so any problem must have a solution remember that and knowing that there is a problem it's already 50% solved and then you have to work the next 50% I'm just putting a hypothetical thing here but to be honest half of it is solved once you know that there is an issue if my wife will tell me oh how come you're like this like that oh I have to step back and no no no no you're the one who has an issue right would I react that way or I will just say okay you know a fish that is uh that has a mouth that is not that is shot will not be you know hooked sorry I don't know where that come from but remember that I mean maybe that that might be a good thing amen I think I think it might be good yeah because when we're always talking like that if a fish is always ah then the bite will you know you'll be hooked it's the same for us when we don't hear we're just wanted to hear what the other will say and then counteract why don't we put ourselves in silence one mouth two ears listen 50 uh 200% talk 100% but listen so we'll put it 100 because we will love to to speak right so but listen to 100% amen so so I don't know where is coming but then the thing is this is the summary the way I see it so it is based on Perfection and then the body of Christ is built on the word of God Amen that's why the word of God is the body of Christ and the head is him himself amen right the body means it's a progression on how so that he can go up to here without any mortal amen this bottom here must have the same size as the top here amen no uh no no leaks y it must be totally sealed amen a rocket that has a liak will not come up right that's right it will explode in midair if there is a leak so and a rocket needs to have pressure underneath so that it can come up so that's why we need pressures trials sufferings it's all for our good amen amen so here before the head can come down the word of God the body of Christ must be shaped exactly the same as his so that he can put and then now brother ready now it's full no mortar thank you brother God bless you no mortar no nothing and it's a whole thing this is the full Masterpiece of God just a summary it's the masterpiece pece family you me many member body and Christ am that's the second Masterpiece the first Masterpiece fell Adam and Eve right but then you see the typing there Adam was smitten oh let's go with the let's step back Moses sculpture was Mitten it made it a masterpiece Adam was Mee to get the bride but then they fell so he restored through through this process of the word through Patriarchs Patriarchs through the word of God and Jesus Christ so it's a love story whole thing so that we can be in we we can be Masterpiece family again am amen because uh because uh Adam and Eve fell amen and but but we can never fail amen because we are his we are in him we are one with him amen right amen all that is in God he poured it into Christ all that is in Christ he poured it into the bride which is the church Capital C Hallelujah he is one with us we are one with him amen so with that the preaching last Wednesday he is the door right the shepherd is the door Jesus Christ is the door in a mystical body no one can come to the ship to take them unless unless the door will allow it amen and he will a true Shepherd will not allow his his ship to to to to to be in destruction to be destroyed by anyone right he will lay his life that's why he sleeps on the door no other no no no other uh evil evil uh evil forces can come except through that door amen and for us brothers and sisters we cannot be deceived if we if we are in Christ amen but if we we go on our own uh on our own way away from the Lord away from the word of God then we will be it's it's a bit of a destruction amen we heard it also last last Wednesday he might break your leg so that you can you can be closer to him amen we don't want that no because we have a clear instruction by the prophet of this age it's it's so important brothers and sisters because this is a way of life right so that we how can we be a perfect Masterpiece if uh because uh it's impossible for us not to be perfect Masterpiece amen if we believe the word of the Lord amen because he's the one controlling you know what he wanted us to do is just to surrender amen hallelujah and not to be you know the three Giants br br can just preach that loss of the flesh loss of the eyes pride of life the most problem here in North America is about pride of life because we have we have a lot here even during covid right the government will give you although they will just print money and then later on you'll pay anyway but at least you can buy food right but you know pride of life is hard to to overcome amen right so so so the thing is uh I in in yeah just to be honest with you in my career when I when we see when we see that we're we finish a a project we started almost 3 years ago 2021 and now it's being commissioned and it cost I'll be honest 325 million so that that is for the sake of discussion it's a huge project many moving Parts many members but then I'm just one of the pebble of the on the beach being being part of that project but I have a a a a a piece to uh to carry out a role an assignment that I need to deliver so tomorrow I'll be flying there because the thing is they will produce now because they want us to be on standby in case of any issue but my point there is uh knowing that we finish that big project it looks like oh oh wow I I did it I did it no the way I see it it's a it's it's just the Lord that will give us to show us that uh we think that we are valuable because we we we we did our best it's successful for example we think that oh this is our 1.8 billion uh project for example in 11 years for example it looks like it will make you very very prideful pride of life is but the best thing what what God is asking us is to think that we're no one that's the only time he can uh he can he can tell us that uh he can prove that uh he's in control when we surrender because we we have this principle in uh especially me when when I uh uh train uh one of our or our Engineers or students my EIT just got his license bn's license and I was the one who coached him and vouch for him and it's a lot of work also for me but then the thing is when he joined my team and he became my engineer in training uh he knows everything right so all right okay so I I've been telling this but every time even with students because aristotel although it's he's not a Believer I guess he said that the more you know the more you realize you don't know right right and it's the same with the word the more we think that uh we know all and then come trials sufferings and then you don't know what to do and even now with the young people because they have J GPT they can resolve the whole world right so it's different it's it needs experience right but then the thing is also an instruction that we need to follow right God already valued us right how because his purpose is the purpose of God stands in a ction amen we know that it's in sardan church age right so what does that mean he created or he chose a bride of of his own choosing even before the foundation of the world I want to I want uh uh brother Peter here to to be my bride in type right because uh he's a man how come he can he could be a bride but with this day and age it doesn't matter now right because they have a lot of pronouns anyway so but uh you know so but but what I'm saying is in type right in his mind he already predestinated because of his for knowledge he already predestinated brother Peter here to be a bride of his own choosing so to be a bride of his own choosing there are steps right for that Vision to manifest there are steps and and that step is he needs to be baptized he needs to be attending church he needs to be perfected right so that he can get married with Jesus Jesus Christ meeting in the air and then uh come Millennium which is uh married supper and so on and so forth and live happily ever after amen so so my point is it's always a process but then the thing is anything that we value here sometimes okay oh okay I pay a lot of tights for example it it might think that uh we can be puffed up right but then the thing is it's just the Lord it means the reason why he blessed you because you're a good steward amen remember that the reason why he give you a lot of blessing financially because he knows that you will use it for the glory of God you will share it to brothers and sisters who who didn't have that uh capability right because think of this even even before uh after after the after the experience in the hoer room remember all the apostles and the Believers they put all their wealth together right right are we ready to do that because that will happen brothers and sisters because later on whatever your bank account uh is it doesn't matter right because this is only paper fiat currency remember it's not backed in gold right it can just disappear it's happening everywhere but uh it will come so let's let's be loose not to hold things tightly that we think that it's our oh oh because I work hard of course we work hard that's why we were given that way but then God has a purpose not every hard worker will receive the same thing amen but how come he gave you this because he knows that you are a good Steward of anything that he he owns everything belongs to God remember that amen we're just stewards here and when we go for Missions we see oh there's a need for church here oh building here oh yes of course we we have to help if we can right if we cannot send if we cannot go ourselves we have to send someone right missions is part of the ministry five cold Ministry remember Apostles is they're the one that establish churches Apostle that's Mission missionary brother Branham is saying so I'm not saying that uh I'm I'm not that what I'm saying here is there are some principles that we need to to do so that uh that Vision can manifest amen amen so I hope this one uh summarize a little bit what what the Masterpiece is it means at the end of at the head here with the prophets means including the bride this is a perfect Masterpiece one whole thing that's right right founded by the Patriarchs right formed by the word of God through the prophet amen right because we were asked to prophesy again we were not the seed is not only given to be a seed it needs to be cultivated it needs to be watered so that it will grow and bear fruits amen so that's that's what we need to do be being uh a Christian because it's a life amen and then come Jesus Christ as a whole thing so this is a whole thing so remove every step here it will not be a a perfect Masterpiece anymore it's not complete that's why we're so glad we have this message of the hour because it's tying the Loose Ends amen so I hope you got it a little bit uh but it's okay I guess we can talk more I think let's go to the next one these are a little bit of summaries here and then we will close maybe in few minutes here I think we're on time so to do things we have to break it down I I mentioned so that it's achievable right amen at but at first before doing anything you should have a vision first on what you want to achieve right and then act on it and then that will be the result right so so that it's easy because even young young person what does he want to do oh I want to learn bike Biking For example of course he he needs to study with the help of the mom and the dad or the brother right they will try to to to to study or to learn biking by training and everything and then that's a result it's achievable right so with Michelangelo I I mentioned a while ago I'm already ramping down here he has that uh mind or Vision to to sculpt Moses right so what did he do as a plan of action lots of hard work he looked for material right he did it day and night and uh oh oh this might be a little bit wrong I have to uh you know being humans we're not perfect right but then in the image of God we have a lot of uh imperfections but then the thing is he will beat us up like the gold so that the full reflection will be shown or can be he his image will be on the gold it means through trials and sufferings we will be made perfect amen and while he he's having this action lots of hard work then he formed Moses the sculpture of Moses but then the thing is the result it's a masterpiece but then the thing is with his vision maybe it just came that it's so true that he said oh I want him to be alive that's why he bit it speak then he didn't want to speak so he he bit it he SM smitten it Smite it uh with with a hammer or or a chisel right yeah so and God the great sculptor the first Masterpiece his vision is to do the first Masterpiece and that is First Man created in his own image reflecting Divine attributes amen because if you want to be in the image of God or he wanted to create a man that in his own image image means the same as what he can that's why Adam is a miniature God he has the power to speak right he named all the animals trees and whatever in front of him but then he did that and then once uh once Eve came out of him that's is SM thing also right so he created man on the sixth day Adam and then Eve and then he placed them in the garden Masterpiece family but then it didn't end in in uh in Garden of Eden because uh sin came a Twist of the story and then that's why we need to be restored right and then the SEC the second Masterpiece which is the Jesus Christ and the bride which is perfect Masterpiece family maybe I call the musicians so at least we can sing some songs here so the second second Masterpiece here is the second Adam which is the perfect one right that is his vision right to have a perfect Masterpiece family through the second Adam which is Jesus Christ and he was also smitten right on the cross yes so that the bride can come out of him right amen amen so because we are we fell we needed restoration amen amen and the restoration I we we summarize it it's through the word word of God perfect word of God through what through the prophets amen good foundation so that we can we can put Christ as our head it means we need to be totally surrendered amen so and then you can see it's the full Masterpiece family amen yes so now I can I can preach now I guess oh so you can see the Masterpiece cannot be perfect without each and every one of us amen it means we need to look for the last predestinated seed yes and if we cannot do that by our own work you have to help someone to do it because there are missionaries in the field that have that desire that's the reason why we have a church in lead bridge and everywhere we're trying to do that if you know and and that's a good motive and that's what God asks us to do is to look for the last amen everyone in this room as I've mentioned has a role amen right you cannot just say I'm just a member here I'm just a janitor here or everyone is required amen because in a million without a penny it's not a million anymore right amen little Pebble on the beach it compos the whole thing right but you're just a pebble on a wide variety of uh Beach but everyone's required so don't think too little of ourselves amen yes it's not because one is preaching here is a big eye there's no big eyes and little use brothers and sisters we are all required to make a body and if one body or one part of the body is hurting the whole body is hurting including the head I'm talking about body means includes the body and all the parts of the uh the head and all parts of the body amen so learn or I mean uh understand that we are we belong to a mystical body and we have a role to play amen we are God's Masterpiece brothers and sisters we are Christ Masterpiece of even amen he IM imagine how valuable you are he gave his life what else can he give better than life imagine if they give you a billion but you will die tomorrow you will you accept the one billion no no one will will because life is precious and that's what God gave to us his life his he said only begotten son but that's him right we know about it that uh he came he needs to have a flesh so that he can die because God is a spirit that's the reason why he came down with this his body of Flesh in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and he became flesh and dwelt Among Us so there's a reason why he came to flesh because he cannot die as God because he's a spirit so he need that body and where's that body now he's in you and me yes sir amen we have that presentation before if if if this is a lot of uh water here and then if you drink it where is God now it's in you right amen oh I have bloods here but uh so you see it's a Redemption story amen right he knows that uh you can we cannot save ourselves it's impossible we're just playing the drama here the role that he gave to us in a play right everyone as a as a even those in the background even here without the without the musicians without the song leader without the the the song the sound technician most importantly without the congregation that's pulling so that there will be preaching it's not a complete service we cannot preach on our our own but we want to bless God right amen and about worship we always Worship the Lord we want to Worship the Lord and giving is one of them right it's not only in music in everything give worship I we've been talking me and my wife what's the difference between prayer and worship prayer is asking God for all the petitions right but worship is about him him alone is not about us when we when we set aside ourselves that's real worship amen when we set aside ourselves and give all the Adoration praise and thank uh Thanksgiving to him because of what he did in Calvary that's worship when so many nuggets Brothers but then yeah it's a I just told my wife I will not put a lot of uh uh you know uh slides and I'll just take but uh upon writing I have already three pages and I am just in the first page but we we have to I hope you got the the point though I mean uh we're special people it's always we believe a positive message amen this message is not a dos and don'ts it's Grace right it's uh it's encompassing it's bringing everyone inside it's imparting life right imparting life to those who don't believe it right it's important and when we think that uh we we we we are acquainted with the world because we are still in this world we have colleagues we have you know families that don't believe this message but are we going to just Shan them no we we need them right we we want them to be inside inside the fold amen it's so important brothers that's why how can you how can you impart eternal life when you don't have it right you must have it first before you can impart it how can you share the word of God if you don't have the word of God God in you oh brothers that's why we need to feed the word I'm guilty oh help me help me Lord I think we are all amen we cannot just say we're oh I'm already good I'm good for Rapture but remember if you believe the word for your day you're already in the Rapture you're just being perfected you're being processed how can you be processed by trials suffering so that you can have Perfection you you see how Joseph became perfect it's true trials and sufferings every everywhere he went is almost oh wow he was sold for 30 pieces of silver he was in the prison he was accused so many things but then what what happened he was restored as a right hand of pharaoh right so that he can give way for the Messiah to give life to impart life to whom to Judah because the because Christ came from the tribe of Judah not not from the tribe of Joseph right Joseph was given that uh that that that uh assignment you will be given this imagine don't think that Joseph is the main there no it's about Judah preserving life am of Judah so that the seed which is Jesus Christ can go through Judah oh there is always a purpose brothers and sisters and everything that we do there's always a purpose and it's for our good Romans 8:28 and it's a transformation of life we need to be transformed to His Image because his vision is to be the same In His Image right his his vision is uh to to create a man in his own image and likeness so that we can be like God like him amen so don't go outside the fold amen which is Jesus Christ himself amen that's our only hope there's no other hope right oh again the word is the absolute but the absolute is in the message it's a binocular so that we can see we can understand and when it's it's very far we have to put things into proper perspect hallelujah oh brothers and sisters feel good I hope uh I hope the Lord is blessed we want to bless him when we are here it's not only for us to be blessed we want to bless him we want to adore him we want to worship him give everything to him amen oh amen you know without God we are nothing right remember the mountain is Holy because God is in that mountain this room is just a normal room if God is not in it amen hallelujah there there's a a bit of a story just uh just to break it I think we have a little bit of time uh it's not a true story just to to put a context in it there are two donkeys walking and one donkey was saying I can't understand it said to the other donkey he said yesterday Jesus Christ is on top of me and everyone is just putting all the good things so that I can uh walk on that uh thing right a donkey because Jesus Christ is walking to at the Palm Sunday there what what they call it uh right uh they're putting all uh all all leaves and whatnot so it's it's a gr entrance because the Messiah is coming is is is on that donkey so the donkey was saying wow I'm special because uh you know they're putting everything on my path so that I can walk on it then but now after Jesus is not here they just don't know me and then the other donkey was saying that's life bro he said without Jesus you're nothing same for you and me if we take that principle brothers and sisters without Christ we are nothing right it's so important to understand that that uh we are nothing no matter how knowledgeable we are we can go cover to cover on the Bible without life we are nothing without the Life of Christ in US is we are nothing amen everything is about him Lord let's worship Him brothers and sisters Worship the Lord Brother I hope uh with this little thought here I I just want to Worship the Lord if we can just uh one song maybe God God God reject your pray pray makes you

wisdom and knowledge and Lord you even told Solomon that's the full duty of man is to to fear the lord and obey his Commandments oh Lord but how we obey something that we don't know that's why the word came through a prophet so that we know what to obey Lord we doesn't mean that we know how to read Lord that you that we will understand it's your Revelation oh Lord Jesus Oh Lord It's just by your grace and mercy you have put that Faith which is a revelation unto us Lord your faith faith of Jesus Christ that is living in US that is infilled in us that's the reason why we are able to to to move ahead oh Lord Jesus Oh Lord without you we are [Music] nothing but when we understand the perfect Masterpiece you will also not be perfect without us a beautiful Redemptive Redemption story oh Lord when the bride and Christ are one oh Lord we might have different levels of Faith here this morning oh Lord with lots of younger ones lot of older ones we might have a lot of uh Lord doubt sometimes but then for those who already walk this Faith Lord we know we can give guidance to those who are still stepping into that uh age Lord let's say in in in getting married it's a it's a desire oh Lord Jesus because that's a even yourself didn't want to be alone that's why you created us same for us oh Lord but we want to have a vision oh Lord Jesus that will not be contrary to your word oh Lord Jesus we want to always be checking theim is it according to the word is it according to the word Lord let that be our guide in everything that we do is it according to your word Lord help us oh Lord Jesus when when we are stepping outside that lane Lord oh God help us to be Lord walking in the middle Lord not not to be liberal or not to be too conservative but balance oh Lord You Have you have put us and and we're so thankful Lord that the that the message of the hour is preached on this Pulpit with balance not with uh with with dos and don'ts or do that are not according to your word Lord because we believe the prophet already mentioned to us Lord clearly his message is to bring us back to the full word not partial word but full word oh Lord that's why we believe what we believe and we thank you for that Lord for opening our eyes of understanding Lord for enlightening us Lord without you we are nothing Just Want to Thank You Lord For Your goodness and mercy in our lives we're

The Worship the Lord worship [Music] wor the Hallelujah could you hear from your theophany today certainly thankful for the dedication of brother mvin and his desire to serve the Lord and the word that we heard this morning we know that was from the Lord I I just can't help but think it's such a beautiful thing I'm fully inspired to get right back into talking about families again but to think about the Masterpiece family that thought is something else and you know many times we think of the Masterpiece as as being absolutely perfect and it is absolutely perfect but what makes the Perfection is the imperfection amen it's the imperfection that makes the Perfection and isn't it a beautiful thing to think about Adam who had all of the right in the entire world we heard about it this morning we could have simply said forget about her I got a bunch more ribs let's make another rib let's make another rde do we have something wrong is that headset still on he could have easily chosen another bride but he didn't what he did was he stepped out of his first estate to rescue his bride what a tremendous thing it is to think and we have the opportunity as husbands As Leaders of our home gods of our families to restore and we know that's what the word says that I will restore saith the Lord Redemption doesn't come from the bride Redemption comes from the husband and we have the ability to impart that with our families I think it's a beautiful thought the the the Perfection is actually in the imperfection or the weakness or seemingly even the error my goodness didn't Eve make an error but her husband was willing to step out completely and look past her error and take her back into him what a tremendous thought vision and purpose we need to have the vision and purpose that vision and purpose will give us the ability to cause and action and that action will create a result and I just couldn't help but think while brother mvin was bringing this while the Lord was ministering to us whether we actually intentionally do a vision and purpose and we actually intentionally do an action looking for a result we're still doing that whether we're planning to do it or we're actually just living Our Lives because not planning failing to plan is what planning to fail and the way we're talking about planning brothers and sisters isn't according to the Natural Realms in this world it's according to the word and the word we heard for our day it's got to be according to the message of the hour it's got to be the full Redemption for each and every one of us and when we can see that it gives us Grace it gives us Grace for everyone for our brothers and our sisters we no longer look at our brother and sister and see a fault or a failure or an error or a mistake what we see is the Perfection what we see is the Masterpiece of God working out through their lives it becomes a beautiful thing we don't look at this world the same anymore we know that brother bandam said when he got the Holy Ghost this book became a brand new book to him and it's the same for every one of us I could I could preach I feel like I could preach I got some notes here I'm certainly thankful for for the word this morning you know there's no other Foundation that we want to base our Salvation on except for that which was already preached what Paul already said and we know he said that if an angel or anyone comes and preaches something else than what was already said just let that person be a cursed and uh we certainly are thankful for what Paul already preached we just want to remind everyone that there was the grocery pickup this week There's groceries downstairs if you would like some by all means help yourself we don't want to have any leftovers we don't want any church mice eating our food so help yourself to what you see and and uh God richly bless you let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for this word that we heard today Lord we thank you that you gave us a solid foundation a foundation that's sure and Lord Jesus we thank you that father we can have the desire in our heart and if we have that desire in our heart it's because you placed it there before the foundation of the world it's not because of works of righteousness it's not because of tenure it's not because of what someone has done for us oh Lord Jesus it's only what you have done and we thank you for it Lord help us to take the words that were spoken today and and consider them Father in a spiritual realm Lord Jesus that we would be able to produce fruit that's worthy for you Lord we love you and we thank you we just want to commit each life now into your hands For Your Glory as we go our separate ways we pray that you would be with those who are traveling for your gospel today Lord bless brother mvin restore his strength we ask and if it Be Your Will for us to meet again on Wednesday Lord we'll be careful to come and give you all the praise we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray am amen can we sing that song We Are redeemed in him is that the is that the song it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone it's not by works of righteousness his alone it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone it's not by works of righteousness but by his grace alone
