[0:00] you and just just a real honor and a
[0:02] privilege to be here this morning. Amen.
[0:05] And I cannot believe this. This is this
[0:08] is unreal. The last time we're here,
[0:10] there wasn't was it here or wasn't the
[0:12] other church? The other church, there
[0:13] wasn't that many people. Oh, wow. Is
[0:16] there is there any congalles in
[0:19] here? Oh, you know, brother DDA and
[0:21] brother
[0:23] Christiana. I guess you listen to him
[0:25] singing on on Yeah, he brother DD is our
[0:28] pastor.
[0:30] Uh we live in Washington
[0:32] State and
[0:35] um is I have a very very unique
[0:39] testimony cuz Sister Katie and myself
[0:42] were raised in a Hutterey colony and
[0:46] then we became Hutter lefts cuz we left.
[0:50] So, so anyway growing
[0:53] up we grew up well from five years old
[0:59] when you start you grow up actually in
[1:03] fear.
[1:05] So no
[1:07] music. So that fear followed me for 55
[1:11] years
[1:13] and at the age of 60 I was delivered
[1:16] from that fear. I would have never been
[1:18] able to come up here and do
[1:21] this. But no music at the
[1:25] colony.
[1:27] So the only thing you could really hide
[1:30] was a
[1:32] harmonica. But when they found it on me,
[1:36] I was whipped. I don't know how many
[1:38] times they took it away. I got another
[1:40] one and kept
[1:42] playing.
[1:45] And so, so here I am. I I played a
[1:48] harmonic. I after I give my testimony, I
[1:51] want to play a song for you. Brother
[1:54] Brandham, he said, when you come over
[1:57] yonder, he says, when you come up, he
[2:00] says, you'll hear me singing on the top
[2:03] of my voice, Amazing Grace.
[2:06] [Applause]
[2:07] And then then he said, then you'll see,
[2:10] oh, brother Bill made it. So that is my
[2:13] testimony. But we all we all went
[2:16] through 2020. I guess the sc we call it
[2:20] a scandmic, right?
[2:23] Scandmic. So October the
[2:26] 2nd,
[2:29] 2020, I come home. It was a Friday. I
[2:32] come home from work and I felt really
[2:34] sick. Told my wife, you
[2:38] know, I can't go to church tonight.
[2:41] you'll have to go by yourself. So, I
[2:42] stayed home and I started to throw up.
[2:46] By the following Wednesday, she took me
[2:47] into the hospital. They did an X-ray and
[2:50] said I had
[2:52] pneumonia. So, they give me penicellin
[2:55] twice, but they give me the wrong
[2:58] penicellin. So, I got sicker and sicker
[3:00] and sicker, just throwing up and
[3:02] throwing up. Like, every time she would
[3:04] feed me with a dropper and and a
[3:07] blueberry, I would just throw it up.
[3:11] And then and that I lost 40
[3:14] pounds. And uh so anyway, by the 14th
[3:18] day on it was a Friday evening. It was a
[3:22] service and our nephew, Brother Daryl
[3:25] Hoer, some of you know him. He had
[3:27] written a song, cast the Mamba in the
[3:31] fire, tell the devil he is a liar, and
[3:34] then turn up the heat and burn his
[3:36] deceit. And they kept singing that over
[3:39] and over. and I'm listening to that. I
[3:40] was very very tired because my lungs
[3:42] were just totally given
[3:44] out and from my oxygen was down to 83
[3:49] and I was actually between life and
[3:51] death at that time. So I I am actually a
[3:55] walking miracle.
[3:57] [Applause]
[4:06] So, I went to
[4:09] sleep and at 3:00 in the morning, I was
[4:12] awakened and I'm standing beside the bed
[4:15] here and I'm looking at myself. I'm
[4:17] laying in the bed. I'm on my
[4:19] elbow and I'm looking out the window at
[4:22] 3:00 in the morning. It's usually black,
[4:23] but it's daylight outside.
[4:27] And as I'm as I'm laying there, this
[4:29] black sheet come flying over my shoulder
[4:32] and into the garbage
[4:34] can. I said, "Cast the mamba in the
[4:37] fire." At 3:00 in the afternoon, I told
[4:40] Sister Katie, "Come take this mamba, tie
[4:43] it up, and go back in the fire pit and
[4:45] burn it." And that's what she did. Amen.
[4:49] Then I knew that Satan could not take my
[4:51] life.
[4:54] Now, by the by the following Friday, I I
[4:59] I couldn't walk, so I had two brothers
[5:03] come and and take me out of the bed,
[5:05] lift me in a chair, and rolled me out to
[5:08] the car. Sister T sister Katie hauled me
[5:11] to the
[5:13] hospital. So, they took me in. As soon
[5:15] as they put the
[5:16] oxygen, I I just completely
[5:20] revived. But I stayed in the hospital
[5:23] for 21
[5:25] days. And so what happened is at 1:30 in
[5:30] the morning by ambulance because the
[5:33] hospital that she took me at didn't have
[5:35] the facility. So the ambulance at 1:30
[5:38] in the morning called me to another
[5:41] hospital. So when
[5:45] When the attendants took me into the
[5:48] elevator, they pushed the floor. I
[5:49] didn't have a clue where I was going to
[5:50] land up. I landed up on the fifth floor.
[5:55] Grace, God's grace. That's all I I can't
[5:58] say anything else. So, they they put me
[6:00] in a room, put oxygen on me, put wires,
[6:03] you know, there won't be no wires in
[6:04] heaven, but I was full of them at that
[6:07] time. So, next morning, I got
[6:11] up about probably quarter after 8 or
[6:15] something, they brought me breakfast and
[6:18] I was I was I was hungry because I
[6:20] hadn't eaten for a long time. For the
[6:22] first time, I ate that breakfast and it
[6:24] stayed down.
[6:27] So,
[6:29] there's a big window there on the side
[6:31] of the of my bed where I was laying. And
[6:33] the building that was a flat building,
[6:35] and there was the metal flashing was
[6:37] going around the
[6:39] building. And uh and as I'm looking out,
[6:42] I see these two little birds hopping.
[6:45] They're hopping and they stop dead
[6:47] center in the middle of the window. And
[6:48] I'm looking at these birds. I could see
[6:51] their heads going like this. And I then
[6:54] I said, "That's turtle
[6:56] doves. They're cooing. They're they're
[6:58] speaking to me." I couldn't hear them,
[7:00] but I knew the way they were going. And
[7:02] they were they were white. And they
[7:04] stayed there about 10 minutes. And when
[7:06] they flew up, I didn't see the third
[7:08] one. It was sitting down. And then you
[7:10] miss and all three of them. Brother
[7:12] Brandham said, "Three is life."
[7:16] So then I knew for sure, Satan, you
[7:19] cannot take this life.
[7:21] There was such a presence that came into
[7:23] the room for two days. I just wept. I
[7:26] just wept. The Lord the Lord was so so
[7:30] it it was it was absolutely incredible.
[7:31] Amen. And then he gave me a song. He
[7:34] said, "When you come out of the
[7:36] hospital, you will sing this song with
[7:38] your fam family." And I don't sing, but
[7:41] when he tells you you sing, you
[7:44] sing. So here's the song. Satan tried to
[7:48] take my life through prayer. The answer
[7:50] was on the way. Three turtle doves so
[7:53] pure and white. A glorious victory was
[7:56] in sight. This bloodline Satan cannot
[7:59] cross. He was stopped by love divine.
[8:04] Doves came to lead this eagle home.
[8:09] Pure and clean, made fully whole. And
[8:12] here I stand. And the Lord give me a
[8:14] brand new set of lungs.
[8:22] [Applause]
[8:24] So
[8:25] now now the the new lungs I'm
[8:28] unstoppable. I can play whatever
[8:31] anywhere, whoever.
[8:33] So here I want to play in the key of G.
[8:36] I want to play Amazing Grace for it.
[8:39] Hallelujah.
[8:44] [Music]
[9:54] Amen.
[10:14] Heat. Heat.
[10:17] [Music]
[10:25] Heat.
[10:26] [Music]
[10:35] Heat.
[10:37] [Music]

[11:06] [Applause]
[11:08] [Music]
[11:09] [Applause]
[11:15] Lord glory.
[11:22] That is my desire. Just if I can just
[11:25] instill in you a little bit of faith as
[11:29] my desire to leave here and and if you
[11:32] need healing or whatever, I just said,
[11:34] Lord, if that testimony will touch
[11:36] somebody's heart, that is my desire. God
[11:39] bless you and thank you.
[11:41] [Music]
[11:42] [Applause]
[11:43] [Music]
[11:58] Thank you Lord. Thank you
