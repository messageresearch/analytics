Let's bow our hearts for prayer. Our dear heavenly father, Lord, this morning this is what you have done. Lord, your grace has brought us all together in your house. &gt;&gt; Father, we've come this morning bringing our praises and our worship to you. We didn't deserve to come here this morning by your grace. Call us when we didn't know what we were doing. And here we are this morning once again with our brothers and our sisters. Lord, you protected us when we went to work, when we went to school, our businesses, Lord. And this morning, we want to defy gravity and lift up our voice and our and our hands and worship you this morning, Lord. It is always good to see brothers and sisters some going through very difficult time but when the doors are open Lord you give them strength. You give us strength to get up and come here. Sometimes it's not difficult for someone. But it is my prayer this morning that we don't come here this morning to look after one another. But we come here because of your strength. And you have also promised us to be among us when we meet. May you move from person to person this morning. Lord, may you look through the people this morning. Lord, every need that is not made known, Lord, may you touch that need, Lord. And I believe, Lord, we will come back and give you thanks. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we pray for each and everyone that is tuning in. &gt;&gt; May you touch their hearts, Lord. May you meet their needs, Lord Jesus. As our prophet told us, if we are traveling and we see a red light, what do we do? We wait. If we have brought something before you and it's not there yet, we wait. Father, this morning, help us to have the faith to wait that you would do it. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we want to invite you to come and minister your word to us. Your servant has done what he can do, but when he's going to come here, it takes you to move him aside and speak to the individual needs that we have here this morning. Once again, we are bringing our tithes and offering to you. We ask you to receive it for Jesus name that we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. Oh, heavenly father, I appreciate you. [Music] I love you. I adore you. I bow down before you, heavenly father. I appreciate you.

There's a request for brother Andy Vanderplass. We would like to continue to remember brother Jeff's cousin who in is in need of a touch. And we also would like to just continue to uphold the the Huckluck family at this time. And if you have a need, by all means, just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for this opportunity to &gt;&gt; gather together one more time the way that you've ordained for us. Lord Jesus, you gave us the direction and we follow it, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful that we can do that. And Lord, I know that our desire is to be able to follow your directions even closer, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Many times it feels like we fall short, probably because we do, Lord, and we just ask that you would forgive us for it. And Lord Jesus, this morning we just want to remember the needs that we we spoke about. Lord, each and every uplift hand, Lord, is a need. Maybe multiple needs &gt;&gt; made known unto you today. We just ask that you would meet them sovereignly according to your word, which is your will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we'll be careful to give you praise, Lord. We're so thankful for the many praise reports that we get because they equal answered prayer. And we're so thankful that you're not a god of the past and you're not somewhere out in the future. You are the great I am present tense in every one of our lives, Lord. Father, we just want to remember, Lord, the Huckluck family, Lord, the passing of brother Johnny. We know that he's come up to your house today and we're so thankful for the testimony in his life. Lord, &gt;&gt; just pray that you would comfort those in need, Lord. that you would bind up the brokenhearted. It's not easy on this side, Lord. And we know that the the holes of those loved ones that pass on can never be filled. &gt;&gt; And we're thankful, Lord Jesus, for the time that we have with one another. So, we pray that you would just bless the memories and Lord, give us the the promise. Lord, help us to look to the promise where we know that we'll meet with them again. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to remember Brother Jeff's cousin. just want to hold him before your throne, Lord. He needs a touch from you. And Father, more than anything, we pray that he could just come to know you in the power of your resurrection for himself, Lord. Father, we just want to remember brother Andy Vanderlass. Lord, he needs a touch. And brother Jerry Carpenter, Lord, he needs a touch. Father, we're so thankful that we can bring our needs &gt;&gt; to the altar. Lord Jesus, we just ask now as we go forwards that you would just lead the way, that you would speak to us gently one more time. Father, just ask all these things now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just ask you to take your seats and we're going to we're going to sing that song. Bring them in as we have a baby dedication today.

It's the Lobe family that moved here from Cameroon early in the year and brother Peter and sister Janet have diligently looked after them. God bless you the Bochi Manus. We certainly appreciate your efforts there. We know the Lord doesn't uh doesn't let those things go lightly when we help one another. Um so we would just like to sing that song. bring them in if you don't mind as we invite them to come forward with a new member of their family. Jemule and uh her name means beauty or day of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jeule Azerel means God has helped lobe. God richly bless you. If you want to just come forward, brother, we will dedicate the baby. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the field of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the big ones to Jesus. [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. [Music] Look at that. My I'm starting to see now what it's like how it's hard to believe that they can be this small. Can you see her? She's absolutely adorable &gt;&gt; and fast asleep. My Let's just pray. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, it's truly an honor and a privilege to stand before you this morning with the Lobe family. Lord, Sister Michelle and Brother Emanuel and Sister Karen. Father, as we see the baby, Lord, we prayed for a safe delivery of the baby, Lord. And we're so thankful that you never disappoint us, Lord, that you always answer prayer. And Father, we're so thankful for this life that you've delivered to the Lobe family. Lord, you brought them from a foreign land to Calgary. And Lord Jesus, by your leadership, now they've had a baby here. And Father, you answered the prayer and gave Brother Emanuel a job and a baby all at the same time. We know that you're more than able to meet each and every need, Father. And Lord Jesus, this morning we just gather together and we dedicate this little life, Lord, of Sister Chimule, Lord Jesus, that you would take her and use her for your glory. Father, we pray that you would keep sickness from her life, Lord Jesus. We also ask, Father, that she would have not only the desire but the ability to dedicate her life, that the time of accountability would come swiftly in her life, Lord, as we live in a world of darkness, that her desire would be for you, Lord, and that she would be able to receive the true baptism of your Holy Spirit, your very life living out through her, Lord, that would lead her and guide her and protect her. Father, as parents, we can only do so much for our children. But we know your word says to train them up in the way they should go and it won't depart from them, Lord, and they won't depart from it. And Father, we know that it is you. &gt;&gt; So, Father, this morning we stand together as a as a body of believers here in Calgary. And we just dedicate this little girl unto you, Lord. Sister Jimule, we pray that you would just watch over her and keep her, Lord. Bless the Lobe family, Lord. Help Brother Emanuel as he navigates in Calgary, Lord. It's not easy coming to a foreign land. We pray that you would just be his lead and his guide. Father, watch over Sister Michelle, Lord, as she has the children now at home. We pray that you would just keep your hand upon them all the days of their life. We just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. musicians get to see her. She's absolutely beautiful. God richly bless you. Amen. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus. Amen. If you don't mind, maybe just stand with me as we turn to the word. Thank you, musicians. If you have your Bibles, we'll just turn to Genesis. Genesis chapter 15. Genesis chapter 15. I want to keep talking today about the covenant. Genesis chapter 15. We'll just read from verse 17. And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land from the river from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates. the Kennites, the Kennesites, and the Kammonites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Raphims, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Gegosites, and the Jebusites. Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful for your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're so thankful that we can gather together around it freely, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just ask Lord now that you would bless it Father as we go forwards. We just ask that you would break it open to us freshmen &gt;&gt; once again. This this loaf of bread, this bread of life, Father, break it open fresh to us, Lord. Nourish us with it, we ask. And we'll be careful to give you all the praise. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. You may be seated. I see we have the uh brother Peter Hoffer here. Is Timothy here with us? He didn't come today. We're certainly thankful for the safe delivery of brother Timothy and uh yeah, the Lord sure is good. You know, we have uh just another little announcement that I wanted to make this morning. I got a text message very early this morning and if you don't mind just bringing up the slide in the email that I brought. We have a thank you from the uh from the newlyweds over in Nigeria. Certainly beautiful brother Victor and uh sister Rebecca Yumok. They just wanted to send a thank you to the congregation here. Says, "Dear Calgary Living Word of Family, we're so thankful for your love, prayers, generous support towards our wedding. Even though distance kept you away, we truly felt your presence and spirit. Your kindness has been such a blessing to us, and we pray God rewards you abundantly. We can't wait for the day we get to celebrate together. With love and gratitude, Rebecca and Victor, and what a beautiful wedding that looked like. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe these must be the engagement photos. And it looks like they had a little bit of fun with it. And just a beautiful couple. It's amazing how the Lord does things. When uh we try and do things, we can make a mess, but when we wait upon the Lord, he will renew our strength. &gt;&gt; So, it's a wonderful thing to be able to just see them together. and they sent me a little video and it was just wonderful to to hear from brother Victor and Lord willing one day we'll get to meet them in person. So &gt;&gt; just wanted to pass the regards along to the body here. So uh God richly bless them continue to pray for them. Continue to pray for all the newly weds. Certainly thankful for the what the Lord has done in brother Logan and sister Neve's life as well. &gt;&gt; I believe uh was the same wedding day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we have uh an anniversary in common. It's wonderful. I have uh just another thing that I wanted to mention here. It's a a prayer request to the congregation from uh Sister Mariel Larte. She has a request uh for a trip that she's taking to Colombia on August 15th. She'll be traveling with her grandson and two brothers. Says we're traveling to Bogota to attend a few fellowship meetings with the bride there. and uh many want to send their greetings to the bride in Colombia and I believe from Colombia. So she said, "God bless you all, Sister Mary Olerte." So we'll continue to remember Sister Mary and uh her request for the meetings there that the Lord will bless them abundantly. &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; Boy, we have a lot going on in the last uh few days, the remaining days of summer. We were just talking about it on the way to church this morning how it's going to be back to school in in just a few weeks and uh boy and then as I usually do I I had to say yes and we'll be shoveling snow as well very soon. And it's true unfortunately but you know the winters are beautiful here aren't they? But summers are nice too. We'll enjoy that while we have it. I'm certainly thankful to be back back in front of you once again and uh I just can't get away from this thought about the covenant and how God made an unconditional covenant with Abram even before he had a name change. And you know in our scripture this morning out of Genesis chapter 15, we have the story about how Abram, if you go back and read it, we won't for time sake. We've read it a few times in the past here and uh I just have other scriptures I want to get into today, but it's a story about how Abram was given the instruction to take the animals and divide them. And we had talked about this in the past about the brother Bradam called it the Chinese laundry. How there has to be a tear. We know covenant means a breaking, a tearing apart of the flesh is what it says. and uh in the meaning of of covenant. And we might be able to get into that a little bit later. And I just think it's a a neat thing here. Brother Brandon brings out like in verse 17, after Abram had laid out all the parts of the animals according to the instruction of the Lord for the sacrifice, the birds, the fowls came. And we had talked about this last time about how those birds and fowls will come and actually try and get into our sacrifice when we wait upon the Lord and when we present our sacrifice to the Lord. God bless you Odelene sisters. I didn't realize you were back. They were there for the wedding. It's certainly wonderful to see you again. But we can actually create a sacrifice unto the Lord and actually present it to the Lord which is a maybe a prayer and supplication and trust that the Lord will bring it to pass in our lives. And many times the Lord will make us wait for it because uh many times there's many different reasons for it. We know that in Daniel's day, Daniel cried unto the Lord and when when the angel of the Lord came to meet him, he said, "Hey, I've been fighting my way here for 21 and one days to get here for your prayer." And uh from the moment you said it, God heard it and we've been dispatched to come and deal with it. But we were fighting against the prince of Persia. And you know, that was back in the day of of Daniel. And I I just can't help but think, you know, now that the lid of hell has been pulled off, how much more they have to fight to get through to answer our prayers. And we know God can just snap his finger and make it happen. But he allows things to happen so that something can happen in our lives. And what that is is a change of our character. And we know that's the gold that we are counseledled to buy in the Leodysian church age. Brother Brham brings it out in the church age book very clearly that even though God says in the Bible, I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire. But the Bradom says very clearly that that is the trials of fiery afflictions. And that gold is not gold as we would suppose. Gold, not gold bullion, not from Fort Knox, not from Switzerland, not gold as we would see it as an element on the periodic table, but character, Christlike character that only comes through fiery trials. But in this scripture here, we have Abram following the instruction of the Lord. And and it it came to pass that the day went long and it turned to night. And even though he had laid out his supplications and his sacrifice, his prayer unto the Lord according to the instructions that the Lord had given him, the fowls wanted to come and and get in it. They could smell that flesh and they wanted some. And the devil's no different today when we do it. But you know, there's got to be a time where that pillar of fire comes down just exactly like happened in this scripture prior where he comes and examines our sacrifice. And brother Brandham says it in a little bit of a different way. I think it's so good. He talks about the packing of a box car on a rail on on the rail cars, how box cars get packed. And you know when the box car gets packed, the inspector has to come and close the door and put the seal on it until its destination until the day of its destination. And that seal can't be broken. And you know what happens is it the inspector will come and he will see if that car is actually packed correctly. If it's not packed correctly during transit, it's going to get damaged. And I can't help but think about all of the people who haven't been given the solid foundation in and around the message of the hour. And through transit, through different ministries and experiences in their lives, somehow the car shakes and they lose their experience. They get damaged. &gt;&gt; But the inspector comes around and says, "No, you need to change this and no, you need to change that." And we talked about this in the past. I think it's so rich. The inspector does not unpack and repack cars. &gt;&gt; He tells you to do it. &gt;&gt; We do it. &gt;&gt; It's up to us to unpack it all if we have to to get down to that last little thing in the bottom. &gt;&gt; You couldn't take a carton of eggs and put them on the bottom. They'll get crushed. If we've got something fragile that's not dealt with properly in our lives at the foundation level, don't think you're going to build a spiritual kingdom on top of it. &gt;&gt; In this scripture here, he sets out his sacrifice and gives it to the Lord and the fowls come. And I just couldn't help but think about it last time we talked about this. How those fowls are just like the devils, just like those evil spirits that want to come around and upset us and say, "Oh man, God, he's heard your prayer. He must have heard your prayer the first time you said it. And here you sit, months, years, sometimes later on. Isn't he going to come and answer your prayer?" And sometimes he doesn't even answer our prayer the way we pray it. But brother Brandham says that's when you know if you love the Lord &gt;&gt; and sometimes we need those in our lives &gt;&gt; because you know when Abram this one here who was given the promise the promised seed we know that there was the singular seed which was Isaac the promised child and then there was the seed plural which is the royal seed of Abraham which category we fit into by the way. But Abram he was given a name change. He was given the promised son. His son grew up to about 14 years of age, wasn't it? And then God said, "Hey, Abraham, I've got another assignment for you, my servant." And no doubt, he woke up and said, "Yeah, Lord, right on. I got the promise. I'm ready to go." He said, "Bring your son to the top of the mountain that I'll give you instruction to, and I want you to offer him as a sacrifice." Can you imagine how many of us fathers would just be gloriously excited about that fiery trial? &gt;&gt; I'm going to take my son to the top of the mountain and offer him as a sacrifice. But we know that Abram, remember we said it last time that he did not stumble at the promise of God through what? &gt;&gt; Unbelief. But he was strong giving glory &gt;&gt; because he knew that God promised this. And if God actually allowed him to take his son, he would be obligated according to his word &gt;&gt; that he would raise him up again. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine having a relationship with God that way to know that he's obligated to his word that way? Not just for Abraham, but for us. &gt;&gt; That's for me. He's that obligated to me in my life. He's just waiting for us to catch that revelation, brothers and sisters. But verse 17 says, "When it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces, the inspector came down to investigate what was going on to see if everything was set in order according to his will." And you know, brother Brandham, he talks about this very scripture here. And he says that when it came to pass that the sun went down and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace was a type of death, death to oneself, the separation of the body and the soul and the spirit. There had to be a time where there was an experience of death. And the only reason for that was so that that life in the pillar of fire could actually come and pass through. It could happen in the daytime, but would you be able to see it? We don't know. But it was actually a type of death is what brother Brandham says in this in this message that we're going to get into today. But I just love it in verse 18. In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham, saying, "Unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates." And that was given the promised land. That was the dedication, God's covenant. It was unconditional to the children of Israel. And the beautiful thing is it's still in force today, brothers and sisters. And I'm not political. I'm not going to get politically charged, but I'm going to say this because it's according to the word of God. They've been struggling and striving for decades, probably even centuries, for some kind of a multi-state solution. They're never going to have it. It's never going to happen. It will never ever happen. Why? Because it's the word of God. That land is not given to two states. It's not given to all of these other inhabitants. That land is given to one group of people according to the word of God. And it doesn't matter what happens, whatever we try and do. Doesn't matter what great leader gets involved and whatever they try and do. Doesn't matter what anybody on earth says or does because God has spoke. His word will never fail. But there has to come a time where there's a death, a burial, then there'll be a resurrection. And we know that Jesus was another part of the covenant that was given and and that happens. But you know, I just I just where I got inspired for this, I'll tell you, was the the covenant of marriage, talking about marriage and and how marriage is actually a covenant and it's not a contract. It's not a contract. It's not an obligation. It's not something that we just do just because. It's an actual unconditional covenant. It's our unconditional love. And I I just got so inspired with this, how the covenant is so beautiful because it's not something that you can just enull. And and some people will say, "Well, you sure can." Well, you can in the world, but when you're married before God, when you give your vows before God, guess what? You've made those vows. And and you know, Brother Brandham says it in the message that we don't want to say something. We don't want to make a vow to God and then go back on that vow. We don't want to do that. And you know, when we make a vow before God, it is done. It's permanent. And I know there's some that say, well, it could be anulled and you know, it could be just as well with Jesus Christ in our lives as well. And I can't help but think about how our salvation is a covenant because we are the bride of Jesus Christ. And many times we love to fit ourselves into that category. But boy oh boy, who has the right to put us away? If anyone has the right to put us away as a wife, it would be Jesus Christ. But here we are today, brothers and sisters, encouraging one another around this thought that this covenant that I'm inspired by is not a conditional covenant. If you do, I will. That's the Old Testament law. We are living under a new covenant. I don't want to dwell on this old covenant today. We're starting there, but we're going to move into a new covenant or a new testament is what brother Bradom talks about. We don't want to live under the Old Testament law. I mean, some people do. you see them, they're legalists and they just want to continually dwell there. And if your skirt isn't long enough, if your heels are too high, if your hair, if whatever it is you're doing doesn't measure up to what their spiritual ideology matches to, then there's a problem. But what's happening is those people are actually living under the wrong covenant because it needs to be the life of Jesus Christ. We can bring people through the door here and say, "You don't do this, you can't do that, you shouldn't do the other." and God will bless you and they'll do it for a time, &gt;&gt; but then eventually those devils that will come down upon their sacrifice will know there's something wrong with that foundation. It's a legalistic Old Testament covenant that won't stand in a day of a New Testament new covenant that's absolutely unconditional if you're following his word. &gt;&gt; But marriage is a covenant. It's something that we enter into and it's for life. It's absolutely for life. And you know, the the word of God says it that if we actually go and get another spouse, and some will say, you know, well, it does say it in in Romans that if a man takes a woman who has a living husband, she shall be called an adulteress. And you know, that's the word of God. That's true. It's 100% true. But you know, I think it's important how brother Brandham brings it in the invisible union of the bride. It's so amazingly beautiful when you listen to that message because he talks about our spiritual covenant in that message in the invisible union of the bride. And I'll say this, I say it a lot. I'm going to continue to say it because I believe the Lord's revealed it to me. The invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ, it comes to a place in the life of a believer's life where it's not invisible. And sometimes people will say, "It's the invisible union, brother Barry. It's the invisible union." Well, it becomes visible after a while because what happens is it's not actually you living out. It's Jesus Christ, the life of God, literally living out through the body of his bride on earth. &gt;&gt; And we can claim Christianity all we want, but what's the life we live? &gt;&gt; Because we know it. We hear it many times. Talk is cheap, isn't it? And that's what turns kids off of this message of the hour. The people that talk spirituality. I'm I'm a Christian. I'm a message believer. But then I'll go and just do a dirty deal behind the scenes and the children will hear about it about how good we scored. We scored today or mistreat the wife or mistreat the husband or smack talk the brother and the sister in the church. You know those meal time conversations brother Brandham talked about is what happened when the she bears came out when God's prophet got upset and and they said go up baldhead. How come didn't you go up Elisha like your leader? Oh my. If you would have been spiritual like him you would have gone up too. But he had a commission to fulfill. Brother Bradam said it that those parents are responsible for the deaths of their children because of the conversations they were having about God's prophet. And don't think it's any different today. Those devils are going to come around and eat your kids' lunch if you're going to be smack talking about the ministry. &gt;&gt; Don't think it's just about the prophet. God has a five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; The devil wants to eat our lunch. He wants to devour us. And you know, I think it's so beautiful because if we are truly sons and daughters of God, he can't. Woo. But we're going to go down a bumpy road if we don't listen to them. &gt;&gt; But you know, marriage is an unconditional covenant. And when we enter into it, it doesn't matter. I know brother Brandham says it in the message. You know, if his wife went out and cheated on him, she she he would probably take her back. He he wouldn't put her out. You know, he talks about it in such a way that if he were to go over to a foreign land and they lived in a marriage that was maybe not unconditional and how she would say to him, he would say to her first, "Now, while I go away, you better keep yourself pure. You better not go out and party. You better blah blah blah." I'm just paraphrasing just for the discussion. and and he said, "Yep, she would hear that and she would probably grab me by the lapel and pull me in close and say, "Now you listen here, my husband, while you're out there in the different land, and nobody can see where you're at, what hotel you're at, and on and on and on. You better not be seeing other women, going out for dinner, and all this stuff." And he said, "What kind of a marriage would that be? What kind of a family would that be?" Now brothers and sisters, he's talking about that in a natural realm. But I want to take it and let's just step it up a little bit and talk about it from a spiritual element. Sometimes I think we look at our salvation from that perspective where it's conditional. Could you imagine living in a conditional marriage where it's always tit for tat, pardon the term, you did this, so I get to do that &gt;&gt; and then the other. What kind of a life is that? What about laying our lives down for one another just like Jesus Christ laid his life down for us? &gt;&gt; Oh my, my wife's going to get more out of me. I'm going to vacuum more or I'm going to do this more. My wife, I did this and that and the other and she hasn't done anything. &gt;&gt; So what? &gt;&gt; It's awfully quiet. Now the brothers are now the brothers are saying, you know, Brother Barry, you're picking on us. Hey, we're the feminine, right? &gt;&gt; Think about our husband and what he did for us. &gt;&gt; How many of us would let people tear out our beard without lashing out? How many people would let someone slap us in the head? We know what Jesus went through for his bride. How could we have have just unrelenting, rigid behavior towards our brides? It doesn't make sense, does it? I I just don't understand it. I believe it's a traditional thing. I don't think Brother Brandham was that way at all. Not at all. I think it's somewhere somehow someone something happened and they started to actually behave this way and it just became a thing. You know what? Our wives are not doormats. &gt;&gt; Our wives are to be cherished. &gt;&gt; But our salvation is just as much of a covenant &gt;&gt; as our marriages. Could you imagine if we treated oursel if God treated our salvation the way we treat our marriage? It's quiet. Can you imagine it? And and I say that because there's times I'm not going to lie, we've had troubles. It hasn't been a bed of roses. When you go through things in life, that's when the real you comes out. And I ain't talking about little things. And I mean little things. You know, maybe some of the bumpy things that we just encounter in our lives where it becomes frustrating when when you start to actually go through deep things. It can really challenge you in ways that you never even imagined. But you know, God allows those things so that he can prove his word. &gt;&gt; And one time I'm going to preach on it. I've got a note in here. I was I was just talking to someone. I just got so inspired. How many times do we try and prove God's word in our lives? He don't need nobody to prove his word. The only thing we need to do is just be obedient to his word. And when we're obedient to his word, then he'll prove his word through us. &gt;&gt; But sometimes we want to see God move in our life. We want to be able to see the power of God in our life. We want to be able to make God move in our life. And we're not going to be able to do anything except for believe his word. &gt;&gt; But it's through the fiery trials that we really see who is who. And and I know for sure that when we go through a real fiery trial beyond what we ever thought we would go through, and we find ourselves in church, still wanting to worship God, still loving him because he is our God, still recognizing that it's an unconditional covenant. It really is the grace of God to us. Because many people would burn up through the fiery trials, but it's his gold. It's so beautiful. his character. Our salvation, brothers and sisters, is a covenant and it's an unconditional covenant. You know, this word covenant is H1285. It's bareth out of the uh concordance, Strong's concordance. And uh you know, it's from 1262 in the sense of cutting a compact because made by passing between pieces of flesh, confederacy, covenant, league. I just can't help but think it is absolutely when we can see this as a covenant, our salvation as a covenant. Brothers and sisters, remember this. It is com a compact by passing between pieces of flesh. It's passing between our soul and our spirit. It goes beyond our flesh. It goes beyond what we sense in our five outer senses. And it goes beyond even what we sense in our five inner senses. And it moves into that sixth sense. That's the realm of covenant. We're talking about the word of God being quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword. Being able to get right into the very soul of a man to discern his thoughts. But, you know, talking about this guy Abram, I just think it's beautiful. We we have the story this morning in revelation or sorry in uh Genesis 15 how God came and actually instructed Abram first and then he actually followed his word and then he came down and confirmed his instruction in his life. We know that he told them here that you're going to actually have a seed that will be greater than the stars in the sky and the sand of the sea. You're going to have that promised son. We know that he tried to do it on his own by listening to his wife. And we know that that became a bit of a mess. But it was actually according to the word of God. It wasn't his will. But God took that and actually made it something that we can see today. But God before all of that came, before the promised son came, I just think it's beautiful how he came and he actually vindicated his promise. He came down to Abram and said, "Did you remember? Did you remember my covenant with you? He gave him the covenant, but then he came and he actually met him personally in the plains of memory. And you know, this is just over a little further in uh the book of Genesis. We're not going to read it today for the sake of discussion. I just want to be able to move forward with this idea uh of the covenant, but how God comes down. He'll give us the covenant. He'll let us know, but then he'll come by our way. We don't know when. We don't know where. We don't know how, but he always does it. And here we have Abram just going about his business. He's in this the door of his tent in the heat of the day. And what happens? Three men appeared is what the word of God says. And he said to Abram, "I've come to visit you according to the time of life." And we know that Abram in that time he saw one. And we know Lot he saw two. That was the the the course of action that was going to take place. They came and they met Abram first and Abram was able to fellowship with them. What was that meeting like? Every time I think about this, I just can't help but pause there and just just think about that. What would it be like to actually hustle out to the herd and get the fattest calf and and give it to a man, a young lad, and get him to dress it out and get get your wife to go and and churn some butter quick and maybe make some bread, get things fixed up and hope that these men are still sitting in the yard out front waiting for you to come back? Cuz how long would all that take? &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; It would take a while. Even today with all of our luxurious technology to go and slaughter a calf and to get some butter and bake some bread and then cook the calf, it would take some time. They'd be hours. &gt;&gt; But here he was just hanging out in the heat of the day. And God came to visit him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Elohim, &gt;&gt; the Lord appeared to him." And this is in Genesis just a little further. But in Genesis chapter 17 verse 10, it says, "This is my covenant which ye shall keep." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God giving his covenant to his man. We know that he actually was 99 years old. And I don't believe that he actually had the promised son yet, but here he is in in a position where God is ready to give him the promise, but he makes sure that he's ready for it. &gt;&gt; He wants him to know that because of my covenant, I'm going to give you a mark. I'm going to set a seal upon you that's going to prove my covenant with you. In Genesis 17:10, this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed. After thee, every manchild among you shall be circumcised. And we know that Abraham was 99 years old. &gt;&gt; This is a very important part of even the Hebrew life today and and many other humans lives, this mark in the flesh. And we know that it is still in force for the Jews. But Paul came around and he said very clearly in in the New Testament under the New Covenant that whether you are or you aren't, it doesn't matter because Jesus Christ came and actually gave us a new covenant which is the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I just want to pause here for a second because it is the word of God. I just want to take some time and dwell on this for a little bit. We know that it's not going to do us any good to to be circumcised or not circumcised. That's not going to change God's covenant with us because we are under a new covenant which is the New Testament. &gt;&gt; But it's interesting because if you look at the children of Israel when they actually went across when they were delivered after their bondage a after all that they went through what God showed Abram they would do all of their seed after they came out of Egypt they were delivered of their bondage. They went through the sea. They brother Brandham talks about it. They were born again. They were baptized in the sea and they were now positionally being placed in the land. And before they could actually go forwards, what did God say? He said to him, Joshua, you need to take and get everyone in line with my word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've forgotten my covenant. My covenant is still in force. and the gentile traditions of the lands have crept into the church and caused it to become just a little bit lax and just a little bit lukewarm and maybe just a little bit powerless. And you need to get back in line with the word so that you can actually be blessed before you enter into that promised land. I just can't help but think, brothers and sisters, even though the covenant was there and it was unconditional, there was a sign that God gave them in their flesh. And today there is a sign that God gives us in our flesh. And what that sign is is not that our flesh changes. It's that our nature changes. That we get a true baptism of the Holy Ghost. But the only way that happens is to submit ourselves fully unto the word of God. &gt;&gt; And I want to preach it this way today, brothers and sisters. We can say, I believe the message of the hour. I serve God. I've got tenure. I've got investment. I've got all this stuff. But how do we live our lives according to the word of God? Do we love our wives? &gt;&gt; Because how we live our lives according to the word of God is how we serve God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, we might say, "Wow, we do a lot of service for the kingdom of God." Maybe we do. But if we don't serve God according to his word, it doesn't matter what we do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We've got to live our lives exactly according to his word. And that is the mark of his life in us is that we will be obedient sons and daughters to his word. &gt;&gt; We won't say, "Well, you know, I could just I could just deal with it a little bit later." The children of Israel, if they didn't follow God's word, they weren't going into their promised land. And even if they did go into their promised land, we know it's probably likely that the enemy would have their way. &gt;&gt; True. But it was important for them to actually just stop, maybe take a step back and just recalibrate with the word of God &gt;&gt; and say, "Okay, let's go through the camp." And anybody that needs to make it right, just make it right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a doctor and a nurse down at the end. Anybody who needs it can just go and do it. And we'll all wait patiently for you &gt;&gt; because we want success, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want God's blessing in our life. I can't help but think, brothers and sisters, sometimes in the church of the living God, maybe we just need to stop, take a step backwards and say, "If someone needs help, if someone's hurting, just come and actually get that help." &gt;&gt; Say the word. He's able to deliver us. &gt;&gt; And then we can all just go forwards together. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And inherit our promised land. &gt;&gt; But let's uh let's turn over in our Bibles to Jeremiah. Jeremiah chapter 31. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah chapter 31 verse 31 should be easy to remember. Behold the days come saith the Lord. that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. Can you imagine what this must have been like to hear for the believers in their day? Those who actually listened to God's prophet in that day. Most of the church didn't listen to God's prophet in that day. And we know that Israel was completely sacked. And uh we're not going to go too far into that, but what it would have been like to hear God's prophet say this. There's going to be a what? A new covenant. Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which my covenant they break, although I was an husband to them, saith the Lord. But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts, &gt;&gt; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. &gt;&gt; Now remember, this is to the house of Israel, but every scripture has a compound meaning and revelation. And I believe we can take this and put it in our lives. We can put ourselves there and say, "Yeah, has anybody had him put his law in your inward parts?" And you know, brothers and sisters, when the Holy Ghost comes into our life, that's exactly what happens. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But I just can't help but think when you see the legalists, that hasn't happened yet. True. &gt;&gt; It hasn't happened yet because they still have their list on the outward parts. &gt;&gt; And they're still looking at all of the outward parts. &gt;&gt; God's not looking at the outward parts. &gt;&gt; He's looking at the inward parts. &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Brandham says what happens is this uh this word that we're talking about, this law that we're speaking about, it will actually wash us white from the inside out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It won't whitewash us from the outside in. We know that that will fade because of that filthy oil that's in our bodies. We know that Job said, "The worms are already in me. The skin worms are already This flesh will never in inherit incorruption, brothers and sisters. This flesh has to perish &gt;&gt; one way or another. It's got to go to the grave or or it just needs to vaporize." But I just love this covenant and and the study of this covenant because it's unconditional and how God takes it and makes it, but then he comes around and says, "I know that you can't live it. I knew that you couldn't live it, but I knew that it would shake down enough people to come to the place where they'll recognize my new covenant and they will appreciate it and they will rejoice in it and they will actually be able to accept it. &gt;&gt; But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; I can't help but think he says that with his bride today. This will be the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayaeth the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts. And what will happen is they will just begin to live the life. &gt;&gt; They won't be looking to study out in a book and to get a quote and to have a quote versus quote. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Verse 34. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor. They won't be busy bodies going around looking at everyone else &gt;&gt; and looking at every other church and looking at all the different things and trying to make it the way they think it should be. &gt;&gt; They'll teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord. &gt;&gt; You get to know him. &gt;&gt; He'll change. He'll rewire the way you think. &gt;&gt; He'll rewire the way you worship. He will completely change the way you come to church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For they shall all know me. &gt;&gt; I love this. From the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord. Why? &gt;&gt; For I will forgive their iniquity. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? We talked about this on Wednesday, that iniquity thing. And I'll tell you, I never studied this out to iniquity. This is the Lord weaving it together. He is the one that will forgive the iniquity, brothers and sisters, that started in heaven from that one that was the covenant angel. Oh my, he had everything perfect in his life. All that he had was perfect. All of his ways were perfect. All of his worship was perfect. You can imagine his hair was perfect. &gt;&gt; Everything in his life was perfect &gt;&gt; except for one thing. &gt;&gt; We read about it. It was iniquity. &gt;&gt; And you know, there's no forgiveness for his iniquity. And I can't help but think it's vengeance of the Lord, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if someone came around and tried to give your wife a bundle of iniquity and she accepted it because she was out from where you were at the moment? What would your vengeance be like on that person? That kind of thing. You'd be like, there was no forgiveness, unfortunately. And I mean, we're supposed to forgive, but just look at it from him as a husband, &gt;&gt; her as the wife, Satan coming around and trying to give it to her. &gt;&gt; Deceiving her. &gt;&gt; I just love this scripture. And they shall teach no more, every man his neighbor, every man his brother, saying, "Know the Lord, for they shall all know me." Yes. &gt;&gt; And I can't help but think, brothers and sisters, everyone of the bride of Jesus Christ shall know him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There isn't going to be ignorance here. &gt;&gt; We're all going to have that same experience. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be that old time religion, isn't it? &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; They shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them, sayaeth the Lord. for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more. &gt;&gt; Now, which one of us could dare &gt;&gt; hold on to iniquity or offenses in our own marriages or in our relationships with brothers or sisters? Which one of us would dare do that? How could we do that? I'll say it. Maybe we just haven't gotten to know him just enough. &gt;&gt; It just hasn't become intimate enough. Brothers and sisters, there has to be an intimate relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. And what happens is there becomes a new birth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why what happened in the Garden of Eden happened in the Garden of Eden. And that's why the whole denominational world, religion in general, has taken it and dumbed it down, for lack of a better term, to some sort of fruit that was eaten. &gt;&gt; How could eating fruit take mankind and throw them into the transgression and bring death into the human race? &gt;&gt; It couldn't happen &gt;&gt; because what happened was an encounter. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was actually a sexual affair &gt;&gt; because the serpent was cursed &gt;&gt; to be the serpent. &gt;&gt; He wasn't created to be the snake serpent that we know as serpent. &gt;&gt; That was his curse. Remember? &gt;&gt; So what was he before the curse? &gt;&gt; That's what I want to say. We know it. I'm preaching to the choir here. But there could be someone that just maybe has never understood this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. From the greatest to the least, they shall know me, sayaeth the Lord, for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. You can see it when you have a believer when something happens, when an offense comes and you ask them, you know, I'm so sorry. Have I done this or whatever? And they might say, yeah, you know, there was this thing, but it's gone. &gt;&gt; Where did it go? &gt;&gt; I can't help but think it went into the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; But humanly speaking, we can't do that. And some people will say, "Well, brother Barry, I could bring out a quote that says, "The prophet says we can never forget." But we've talked about this. The devil comes around with a jar of memories and he wants to shake them and rattle them in our head. And we can choose to say, "Get lost, Satan. That's actually dealt with. It's under the blood. I put it out of my mind." Or I'm going to say, "No, no, no. Let's get out that jar." And I'm going to look at that memory. And you know, as I look at that one, it's going to remind me of the next one. And then it's going to remind me of the next one. And it's going to remind me of the next one. And before long, I become a bitter person in my heart. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And then we're exactly where the devil wants us to be. And alls it is, brothers and sisters, is a distraction because he can't change us from being a son and daughter of the most high God. Alls he can do is distract us. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he distracts us, then we're actually missing out on that blessing. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I just love this how there's a promise of a new covenant. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; And you know that promise for the new covenant, it came right in the midst of a terrible, terrible tragedy. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about it how in the Bible, you know, when the city was under siege, &gt;&gt; the king of the north came just like the prophet said, you know what? If you don't repent, the king of the north, his fury is stirred up. God has stirred up his fury. It's ferocious. and he's going to come and he's not going to spare at all. And we know that the Bible says that there was those that were instructed to go through the land, three angels, two of them, and then another one who had an ink horn. And they were told to put a set a mark upon those who are sighing and crying for the abominations. &gt;&gt; And brother Bradom, he says that, you know, we can say, we say amen to the word of God, but which one of us are signing and crying for the abominations in the land? &gt;&gt; And where is the land, brothers and sisters? I don't want to say North America, even though it is. We're not talking about a geographical location. This is brother Barry's notes here. But you know what we're talking about is the land of the living God. &gt;&gt; He's trying to get through to his church. Are we sawing and crying for the abominations where people are actually taking and making the message of the hour something to suit their own lifestyle? Or are we actually getting on our knees and actually taking the time to intercede for our brothers and sisters? Because we recognize what's actually going on. We recognize what's at stake. &gt;&gt; The prophet said that time is short. Back in the 60s, back in the 50s, back in the 40s, it's later than we think. Where are we at today? &gt;&gt; But I can't help but think we're just living under that promise of a brand new covenant. &gt;&gt; And many would say it's an old covenant, Brother Barry. Yeah, it is. But I think it's important for us to look at it this way that he said that even from the least of them unto the greatest of them, they will know me, saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A prophecy. And this is well after the original covenant that was set. God who is rich in mercy comes around and in the midst of all of their sinful nature in the midst of the city being sacked starved out to the place where they start to boil each other's children to survive. &gt;&gt; His man, his prophet Jeremiah speaks these words, God's words to a few faithful people, very few faithful people. And isn't it interesting? The king of the land completely rejected the word of God in his day. The the king of the land was taken captive and and caught. And we know the king of the land, he actually was able to witness uh the king that took over. It's a terrible story. He said, you know, God actually allowed this to happen to him because he would not listen. He would not hearken to the word of the Lord through the vindicated prophet in his day. And God said, okay, if that's what you're going to do, then this is what you're going to get. The prophet even told him, "If you would just go out and surrender right now, you'll live the rest of your life as a slave, &gt;&gt; but you'll live." &gt;&gt; And he wouldn't listen. &gt;&gt; So God allowed the king that took them over to take them back and actually slay all of his sons in front of his eyes. And then he put his eyes out and said, "That's the last thing that you'll ever see &gt;&gt; is the death of your children." And I can't help but think, brothers and sisters, if we're not willing to completely follow every single letter of the word of God from the vindicated prophet in our day, don't think that we're separate and we're special. The devil is going to come around and actually take our children's lives. They're not going to want to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; What's going to happen is that's going to be the last thing that we see. &gt;&gt; We need to follow the word of a vindicated prophet, not try and make excuses for it and say that we can do it differently. True. &gt;&gt; We just need to humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord and he'll lift us up. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said that true revelation, true revelation. There's lots of revelation in this world, but there's true revelation. And I'll say this, too. There is baptism of the Holy Ghost, but there's true baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, why do I say it that way? Because Brother Bradam says you could be baptized with the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and still go to hell. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; How does that work? &gt;&gt; You're living under the anointing. I can't help but think you're actually living off of someone else's experience in the church of the living God. We're around believers. We see a wonderful song service. There's many blessings that fall. &gt;&gt; But are we willing to humble ourselves completely to the word of a vindicated prophet in the day in which we live? If we're not, brothers and sisters, we are at great risk. I want to tell us we're at great risk. But if we do humble ourselves, then we got every single reason to rejoice. &gt;&gt; We got every single reason to run around the room. If we can't let off the pressure in here, then where can we do it? &gt;&gt; Remember, we should be just as exuberant here &gt;&gt; as they are &gt;&gt; there. &gt;&gt; How exuberant do they get there? &gt;&gt; I mean, when you can recognize that he said to them, I will forgive their iniquity. There ain't no iniquity in your life. Even though we feel like, oh Lord, I need you to forgive my iniquity. Please take it out of the way. And I know there's much in my life. Brother Barry speaking here. &gt;&gt; My personal prayer. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I will forgive." &gt;&gt; I I can't help but think, "I'll forgive your iniquity, Barry. &gt;&gt; Oh my." And and I will not remember any more of your sin, Barry. I can't help but think, let's just put our names there, brothers and sisters. He won't remember your iniquity. He won't hold your sin against you. He puts it into the sea of his forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to say this. If we've got things in our lives, let's take them. If they're about other people, take them and throw them into the sea of God's forgetfulness right now. Don't hold on to it and see if God won't bless you in ways that you never imagined. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, which is life. It's freedom. We're not under bondage anymore. I don't have to look at that memory. I don't have to let that thing haunt me. &gt;&gt; It's an evil spirit. Rebuke it in the name of Jesus. Give people forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgive your spouse even if they continually do it to you. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, I'm going to say this and I hope it's okay. &gt;&gt; Some people might not like it or whatever, but it's okay. I I'm I'm going to say I'm the pastor here, so Lord willing, we're going to do it. Sister Marian's auntie is going to come, Lord willing. Is Sister Marian here today? Brother Tabiso. Sister Marian, she's right there. Yeah, she texted me and said she's going to come. And when she does, I want her to give her testimony about Lord Stanley. She has a testimony that is unreal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A believing wife with a husband that doesn't believe, that drinks. I don't know if he still does, but there's a terrible, terrible time in their life. And she is dealing with the kids. And you should hear this woman talk because what does she do? She takes and just gives forgiveness. Continually forgiveness. He's my husband. Continually forgive him, Lord. Continually forgive him, Lord. Continually forgive him, Lord. And she'll fill in the blanks. But what an incredible testimony. &gt;&gt; He wasn't even changing his ways. &gt;&gt; He wasn't even changing his behavior. In fact, I think he was getting worse at times. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But she just kept forgiving him. and looking after him because why? It was her husband after all. &gt;&gt; Imagine if we lived our lives that way. &gt;&gt; I I just want to say it, brothers and sisters, there is a tremendous amount of power available to the church of the living God. But I'll tell you what, as long as we're holding on to junk in our lives, it is going to ground that power. We're going to walk around that power. We're going to pack that power. We're going to talk about that power. But as long as we're holding on to things in the past in our lives, that power is not going to be activated the way that we should be activating it the way that he wants to activate it in our lives. Remember, Brother Brandham said that we're living below our privileges, aren't we? What is it? A thousand miles below. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; but there's a promise of a new covenant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; My Let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 8 as we start to change gears. certainly love the Lord. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 8. And you know, I I thought it was going to be a bit long, but I think it's okay. &gt;&gt; I could say a lot, and I usually do, I guess, but let's just let the Lord speak here. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 8. Paul's speaking to the Hebrews now of the things which we have spoken. This is the sum. We have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens. A minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not a man. So beautiful. For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices, wherefore it is of necess necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law, who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle. For see, saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount. But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. But finding fault with them, he saith, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, &gt;&gt; and with the house of Judah." Now, here we have Paul admonishing the Hebrews, not with his own words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What he's doing is admonishing the Hebrews with the word of the vindicated prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though he himself is a vindicated prophet, &gt;&gt; we know Amos 3:7, the the the the scripture there, it says, "Surely I'll do nothing unless I first reveal it unto my prophets, my servants, the prophets." Right? &gt;&gt; So, he's not bringing a new message. &gt;&gt; All he's doing is saying what we already read. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That God gave Jeremiah. for finding fault with them. Verse eight, he saith, "Behold, the days come, sayaeth the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day, when I took them by the hand, and led them out of the land of Egypt, because they continued not in my covenant, and and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I love how he says this here because he just magnifies what Jeremiah said, right? I will put my laws into their mind will become mindful of the law &gt;&gt; and there won't be a list of dos and don'ts on the outside. &gt;&gt; It will be inside us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people. I just want to say this, brothers and sisters, as we read this, we know that God will put it into our mind. We can become mindful of the word of God, mindful of the message of the hour, mindful of the quotes, &gt;&gt; mindful of our salvation, mindful of the new covenant, of the unconditional covenant, of the better covenant. &gt;&gt; We can be mindful of all of these things. He'll give it to us in our mind. &gt;&gt; But the true test is that it will actually be in our heart. &gt;&gt; Remember, the longest journey of any human being is for this word to go from here &gt;&gt; to here. &gt;&gt; The longest journey that we could ever take, the most adventurous journey that we could ever take is for that word to be hid in our heart that we might not sin against him. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know many times we can have it in our minds but not have it right in our heart. And how will we know that? We'll know that by the response we get when someone or something speaks to us and brings correction according to that word that we have in our mind. &gt;&gt; Because if it's in our heart if it's moved down into our heart, we'll say, "Oh Lord, forgive me. Brothers and sisters, please forgive me. I was wrong. I I stand corrected." or will say, "Nope, I've got it right that I'm going to take another step out on that limb. And I'm just going to keep stepping out on that limb, and I will not ever go back because I have too much what? Iniquity in my heart. I've got too much pride in my heart to actually go and repent." But I think it's amazing here. I will put my laws in their mind and write them in their hearts. And I will be to them a god, and they shall be to me a people. And they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother, saying, "Know the Lord." Oh my. For all shall know me. I just can't help but think that this is a perfect example of a believer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, I think it's Brother George Smith that says it. You know, we should uh we should preach often &gt;&gt; and once in a while when we need to, we should speak &gt;&gt; because our lives actually preach. The life that we live preaches way louder &gt;&gt; than all the words that come out of our mouth. &gt;&gt; And they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother, saying, "Know the Lord, &gt;&gt; for all shall know me &gt;&gt; from the least to the greatest." &gt;&gt; Verse 12, I think, is where it really becomes a little bit more real and tangible to us. the way that the Lord expresses the same word through his prophet for this day. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness &gt;&gt; and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. In that he saith, a new covenant, &gt;&gt; he hath made the first old. Now that which decayth and waxth old is ready to vanish away. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; It's just wonderful to see how the word of God moves. How God moves his word to accommodate his people to look after his people. &gt;&gt; But he's given a new covenant. Let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 10. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10. I'm hoping that I can get us done at a decent time, but we'll just trust the Lord here. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10 verse 11. I I just think it might be good. Maybe I'll just read verse one just to set the example and you know for the sake of time maybe if you desire to just read the rest of this when you go home. Hebrews chapter 10 verse one. For the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there onto perfect. Living according to the old covenant will never ever do it. It never could do it for them in the day in which we lived and it will never do it for us today. So why would we ever want to go back to a legalistic covenant? Why would we ever want to go back to live under the law is beyond me. I don't understand it. I I I guess I do, but I I think just for the sake of discussion, I think it's difficult to understand. when we have been given this glorious liberty of the freedom of the life of Jesus Christ living out through us through this message of the hour. Why would we want to go back to a legalistic perspective and think that's going to do anything good for anybody &gt;&gt; when God who is rich in mercy &gt;&gt; when when we were dead in sins and trespasses &gt;&gt; oh my he considered us in our position &gt;&gt; but in Hebrews chapter 10 here I just wanted to start reading with verse 11 and every priest standeth daily ministering ing and offering oftent times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. &gt;&gt; How many of us have gone on our knees and offered the same sacrifice over and over again and find ourselves doing it over and over again &gt;&gt; because it never takes away the sin. Verse 12. But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, &gt;&gt; sat down on the right hand of God, &gt;&gt; from henceforth, expecting till his enemies be made his foottool. For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. &gt;&gt; Are we sanctified this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if that's the case, then he has actually perfected us forever. &gt;&gt; Verse 15, whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us. And you know, brother Bradom says it this way. I think God through brother Bradom to this age. He says that the Holy Ghost is actually the earnest. The Holy Ghost is the down payment. It is our assurance that we have made it. &gt;&gt; That we have actually packed that box car to the place where the inspector has come around and shook it and said, "You know what? &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; I am pleased with him. And I'm going to close that door myself and I'm going to put the seal on that door. And there ain't no devil in hell or in earth that's going to be able to mess with that load or that seal. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; This is our covenant, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; This is the covenant that he's given it to us. And the only thing it takes for us is to believe it. &gt;&gt; If we really believe it, then we'll live it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Verse 15 says, "Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us. For after that he had said before, this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayaeth the Lord, I will put my laws into their Isn't it interesting? It's the word of God being said over and over again. &gt;&gt; He's saying it for a reason, brothers and sisters. And now we can look at it from the perspective of the new covenant, which is the New Testament. And I want to say it this way, maybe the new testimony. the life of Jesus Christ living out through us. &gt;&gt; This is not about the Jews &gt;&gt; in Israel. &gt;&gt; This is not about the Hebrews. This is not about Paul. This is not about Aranius. It's it's not about Luther. It's not about Wesley. It's not even about Brother Brandom. It's about you and I. &gt;&gt; This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayeth the Lord. I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about doing it. He will do it. I will put my laws in their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. We have read this three times this morning. How could we retain anything against anyone when he is not willing to retain anything against any one of us? &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I just believe the Lord is showing me this so loud and clear. Brothers and sisters, this is the trick of the devil for us to actually have something that we harbor. &gt;&gt; You hold on to something, you got a ball and chain, it's taken away your ability to fly. &gt;&gt; I want to say that we serve the God that is a chain breaker. Let's give him those chains and say, "Break those chains, Lord. I don't want to be bound down by this memory, by this situation, by this hurt, by whatever it is in my life any longer." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Cuz I guarantee you, when something's bugging you about someone, it's bugging them. And they might not know why. They might not understand what's going on. &gt;&gt; What does the word of God say? I want to say it. It doesn't say text them. It doesn't say call them. And it surely to goodness does not say send an email or a letter. &gt;&gt; It says go to him. &gt;&gt; Now maybe you'll say, "Brother Barry, I can't I can't just go and book a ticket to go to a foreign land. Do you know how much money that will cost? &gt;&gt; Do you know how much it will cost to retain that thing?" &gt;&gt; True, &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters, there ain't nothing that's worth holding on to any kind of hurt or problem. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this. If you've got something, if we've got something in our life with someone in a foreign land, think about it. If you take of your money and you stretch it to the last dollar, don't you think that God will honor that beyond your wildest dreams for you to say, "I'm willing to take the sacrifice and to lay it out before you, and I'm going to trust with all of my heart that your pillar of fire is going to come down and examine this sacrifice that you're going to go with me according to your word and help me deal with this situation sovereignly." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can tell you, I don't even know why I'm talking like this, but praise the Lord. When the anointing comes, we're going to go with it. &gt;&gt; It is the truth. &gt;&gt; Verse 17. And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. So, how can we possibly remember anybody else's sins or iniquities? &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Boy, if we've got a friendship and we continually bring it up and say, "You remember how you hurt me? &gt;&gt; Remember how you hurt me? Remember how you hurt me? Remember that thing you did? You did. You did. You did." How how good is that friendship going to be? &gt;&gt; Not a good friendship. &gt;&gt; Think about it. If you got a marriage, if you continually say, "You did this, you did that, you did this, you did that." &gt;&gt; What's that going to be like in the marriage? &gt;&gt; Children, my you always do this. &gt;&gt; You always do this. &gt;&gt; What are they going to do? They're always going to do it. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom says, "We never are going to live above our confession." That's right. &gt;&gt; We have an unconditional covenant with the Lord and we love his salvation. And we love how he taken our sin and iniquity and thrown it into the sea of his forgetfulness. Let's do the same with our brothers and our sisters. But let's not do it with the devil. Let's take that iniquity and put it right back on him. He's the owner of that iniquity. &gt;&gt; We were talking about it this weekend. I think it's beautiful. Well, there's coming a day, brothers and sisters, where we're going to walk by and we're going to see that one on the side of the pit and we're going to say, "You're the one that brought every single hurt to my life. &gt;&gt; You're the one that hurt my children. You're the one that hurt my parents. You're the one that hurt my brothers and my sisters. You're the one that caused all of the afflictions in this world." &gt;&gt; We're going to look on them narrowly. We're going to squint our eyes and say, "You, you're the one. Let's put it back on him, brothers and sisters. He's the owner of it. &gt;&gt; He's the owner of it, not us. &gt;&gt; Don't own it. &gt;&gt; And I will say this, as long as we're willing to hold something against someone, I have no notes about holding stuff against people. Praise the Lord. I love this this leadership of the Lord. If we're holding something against someone, &gt;&gt; we're holding it against us. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's grounding us. &gt;&gt; We can say it's against them, but what it's doing is hindering us. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Brother Ken used to preach it that way. It's just like taking poison and drinking it &gt;&gt; and waiting for it to take effect in the other person's life. &gt;&gt; And what's going to happen is we're going to see cancer. &gt;&gt; We're going to see all kinds of diseases that will happen in our lives when we're carrying bitterness and aggression and anger. &gt;&gt; We need to let all those things go, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; and just forgive. That's right. &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus, God in flesh, he said it, just like we forgive is how we'll be forgiven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, if we're continually keeping a laundry list of things, you know, mentally, I know that this happened on this date and it hurt me so bad and that thing happened and the other thing happened and and I just can't let go of it. I can't forget about it. You know what? You can't on your own. I agree. But if you're willing to actually take God at his word, &gt;&gt; if you're willing to take God at his word &gt;&gt; and give it to God to deal with, he'll change you. &gt;&gt; We will become a new creature in Christ Jesus. In fact, you have to become a new creature in Christ Jesus. There's no option. It's not an option. Brother Bradom said it. Without the Holy Ghost, we're lost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the message, the token. &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, we're lost. exact quote. &gt;&gt; This is the covenant. Verse 16 of Hebrews 10. This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayaeth the Lord. I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. &gt;&gt; And I I know Brother Barry just keeps saying it. Isn't it wonderful to hear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's talking about me right there. &gt;&gt; I say, glory to God. I'm so thankful to read this. How encouraging is it? &gt;&gt; Verse 18 says, "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can kind of change our nature. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And we can change our ways &gt;&gt; to match his nature and his ways because he doesn't change his nature, nor does he change his ways. Verse 19, having therefore, brethren, boldness. When we recognize this, this is what happens. &gt;&gt; When there's no condemnation in our lives, we're already seated in heavenly places. Romans chapter 8, right? There is therefore now no condemnation. Some folks want to live in Romans 7. Oh, this terrible man that I am, I continually have this problem and never seem to be able to get over it or progress. &gt;&gt; Turn the page. &gt;&gt; Turn the page. Those people who walk not after the flesh, &gt;&gt; they're not looking at the outward appearance of man, but they're looking at the inward &gt;&gt; workings of the heart. &gt;&gt; Verse 19, having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. We've preached it many times that once upon a time it was actually death to the individual to go beyond that veil into the holy of holies in the temple. Now, after Jesus died at Calvary, his first order of business was to go and rip that veil and say, "Now to stay out is death." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, &gt;&gt; and having an high priest over the house of God. Verse 22, brothers and sisters, kind of where I want to get to today. And then we're going to bring up a quote. Let us draw near with a true heart. &gt;&gt; One that he has written his laws in. &gt;&gt; One that he has actually done surgery on. We talked about it early on in the ministry. We need open heart surgery. We need the Lord to come by our way and change our hearts. Take out that stony, miserable, unforgiving, sinful heart, and put in a heart of flesh, something that's full of love and forgiveness. &gt;&gt; When that happens, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, &gt;&gt; for he is faithful that promised. &gt;&gt; And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. &gt;&gt; My brother and my sister didn't mean that. Maybe they said that, but I just don't think they meant it that way. I just don't believe it because I can't see the real them, &gt;&gt; right? goes on to say, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together &gt;&gt; as the manner of some is." Let's not just stop there and say we have good works because we go to church, brothers and sisters. Let's read the whole verse here &gt;&gt; as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another &gt;&gt; and so much more as ye see the day approaching. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let's remember to exhort one another &gt;&gt; as we see the day approaching. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to follow up with this now with a little quote here that brother Brandham talks about and uh it's it's a beautiful quote as all of them are and uh it's out of the token in 1963. The token in 1963 just sort of kind of along the lines of what we're talking about here. What brother Bradam says, he talks about this covenant and he says, "Why isn't it called eternal covenant?" Because that it wouldn't be eternal. &gt;&gt; When we're redeemed, it's all over then. It's an everlasting, which means a certain amount of time till time is out. And we know, brother Bam talks about this in the seals about how there's everlasting fire. There's going to be a time where there will be a punishment, but it's not going to be eternal. &gt;&gt; Because eternal is God's life. That's the only eternal that there is. &gt;&gt; He says it's everlasting, which means certain amount of time. Till time is out. There'll never be another one. When time runs out, we won't need no covenant. &gt;&gt; But until time runs out, we need the covenant. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need the covenant, brothers and sisters. Now, remember Hebrews 13:10-20, an everlasting covenant, God's bloodbound promise makes us free from sin. Amen. There is no sin in him. Sin self flesh. Worship him and show forth his promised power. God's bloodbound token power. covenant people has the spirit of Jesus Christ hear that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also &gt;&gt; I I just think this is beautiful brothers and sisters displaying the covenant see this is what brother Brandham says displaying the covenant so what is displaying of the covenant I want to say it this way it's not going to be in prayer lines and great healings and great surprises according to miraculous things that take place according to the word of God which is according to his word. There's many different things that can happen. But it's not about that. I believe it goes a little bit deeper here because remember we're we're talking from the message the token. Now I'm not going to say the prophet was saying this. This is what the prophet meant. I'm not saying that. What I am saying is that the whole entire message goes a little bit deeper. The message of the hour, the idea that what we're talking about is displaying the covenant, &gt;&gt; living the life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Day to day, action to action, moment to moment. Not just when we come to church. Not just when somebody says, "Oh, you you're a Christian. You you you act differently." What is it about you? It's not about that at all. It's about the quietest moments of our life. Who are we? Where are we at? &gt;&gt; It's displaying the covenant. See, brother Bradam says here the new testament testament means covenant. That's right, isn't it Dr. Vale? Testament means covenant. The new testament means the new covenant. The old testament was the old under the lamb and the life could not come back on the believer. Remember the people would bring their sacrifice according to the word of God, observe it seven days, make sure that it was free of any blemish, and they would have a perfect sacrifice, bring it in exactly according to the word of God, and have it sacrificed, be identified with that blood. They would go in as a sinner, and they would leave with the exact same desires that they had going in. Nothing would change in their lives. But as long as they followed the word of God for their day, they had redemption. The New Testament means new covenant. The Old Testament was the old under the lamb that the life could not come back on the believer. The New Testament was the lamb of God. And his life comes back on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, brothers and sisters, his life doesn't just come back on us and then bounce off. &gt;&gt; And we can look back and say, 40 years ago, his life came upon me and now I'm good and I can do whatever I want. No, &gt;&gt; no, no, no. His life comes upon us and stays on us if it's truly his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His life comes back on us. Blood's life. See, blood is the life in the new testament. See, life is from the blood of the lamb, which means the new testament, new covenant, that God after those days will I write my laws upon the fleshy tables of their heart. See, not upon the stony tables and a lamb's blood which you had to say, "Yeah, I got the blood over here." But what does it say do? But upon the tables of your heart. See, the spirit covenant. I just think how many different covenants he uses here in the descriptive terms. The spirit covenant will I make with the people &gt;&gt; and it displays his power. Now remember, let's not try and get all of the fanatics. We're not worrying about seeing mighty signs and wonders. Let's worry about seeing a new creature in Christ Jesus because that is the identification of the new covenant, brothers and sisters. Seeing the mighty works of God is one thing, but you know what? The devil can impersonate any gift. I'm sorry we're a little bit after 12, but I just I feel so impressed to continue on. We just have a few more paragraphs and then we'll wrap up. I'll even call the musicians in earnest to prove that I'm going to quit. But you know, brothers and sisters, the spirit covenant will I make with the people. &gt;&gt; And it displays his power. John 14:12 says, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also." Amen. &gt;&gt; If we get this guy right, &gt;&gt; if we get this guy right, brothers and sisters, if we recognize there is therefore right now no more condemnation, that way I can't hold any condemnation against any brother and sister because I want to have no condemnation in my life. If we're willing to hold on to condemnation in our life, then we have condemnation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The way that we judge others is the way that he's going to judge us. If we're going to have a laundry list against our spouse, he's going to have a laundry list against his spouse. &gt;&gt; That's his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, but his word will remain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to stand before him having a laundry list against my wife. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; I want to stand before him knowing that I'm behind the blood, that bumper of blood. &gt;&gt; The New Testament is new covenant, new life. &gt;&gt; Amen. shows Jesus has met every requirement for us that God required. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Jesus met all the requirements. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we need to do except for accept it. We just need to believe it the way that he's done it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. He's met every requirement for us that God required to make us back truly sons and daughters of God under the blood where there is no more condemnation. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Romans 8:1. There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not those who are believing it. I I actually have this in bold in my notes here. Maybe stand with me as we close. Brother Brandham talking here. He says, "Not those who are believing it." Which is shocking to me. Do you understand what I'm saying? His his theme song was only believe. And here we have him saying now, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in, not those who are believing it, those who are in Christ Jesus. that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. And my word is spirit and life. See? Oh, I couldn't couldn't I take a text from that and stayed a couple more hours, but we'll hurry over it. You see, no more condemnation. Free from sin, free from cares of the world, no condemn. Why? To them that have been by one spirit baptized into one body. That's why, brothers and sisters, outside of his spirit, we're going to have condemnation. We're still going to be living under the law. We're still going to be looking at things carnally. We're going to be looking at the flesh. We're going to be judging things according to the way we think we should be doing it and thinking all along that the spirit is leading. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Shocking position to be in. &gt;&gt; But when we have his spirit, we're going to have forgiveness. I think that's going to be one of the greatest hallmarks. And that truly, brothers and sisters, came out today fresh from the throne. Somehow someone here needs forgiveness. I know I need forgiveness. There's things in my life, people that have stepped on my toes that I feel like I've I've been hurt by. I need to forgive them. &gt;&gt; Maybe he's talking to me. &gt;&gt; But no more condemnation. Free from sin. Free from the cares of this world. Who wouldn't want to live right there? I don't have any condemnation in my life. I'm already seated in heavenly places. I'm free from sin. am free from cares of the world. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; To them that have been by one spirit baptized into one body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One spirit, one body, there ain't going to be departments or or zones or districts in heaven. And I'll say this too, brothers and sisters, to the glory of God, there ain't going to be race in heaven. &gt;&gt; There's sons and daughters of God. If there was race in heaven, then it would be documented in his word. Yes. &gt;&gt; If we're busy with all that business here on earth, then there's something wrong with our heart. &gt;&gt; There ain't no culture in the Holy Ghost, someone who is saved in Africa is going to act exactly the same as someone who is saved in North America who is going to act exactly the same as someone that's in Australia or in China or anywhere we go. &gt;&gt; Because it's one body and one spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To them that have been by one spirit baptized into one body. There the blood of the lamb has been applied. The God of heaven has accepted you. &gt;&gt; And your I love how he says this. I'm bold again. His life is in you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And you are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; I got some more bold here. &gt;&gt; Your character &gt;&gt; is what? It's God's character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, when we see some other character slipping in, brothers and sisters, we can tell right away that it ain't God's character. &gt;&gt; It's just the devil trying to hand us iniquity. Just don't take it. &gt;&gt; Your character is God's character. What is it? A little pushover? &gt;&gt; No, sir. God is a God of judgment. He is a God of correct. It must be on the line. nothing else will do. That's the kind of character you are because you're the character of your father. See &gt;&gt; you &gt;&gt; what &gt;&gt; the life watch when it the life took for the blood. See the life itself is took see the life it took for the blood. See the blood was applied and the life could not come back on the believer then for the life of the animal. But see, instead of a human being, it was a super super super human being. See, and that makes the human being now not only a human being. And I can tell you, brothers and sisters, Satan hates hearing this because Satan was deceived. &gt;&gt; And he hates that. Those are searing words to the devil &gt;&gt; to be deceived just like he deceived Eve. Satan himself was deceived &gt;&gt; because instead of a human being, it was a super super super human being. See, and that makes the human being now not only a human being, but he's a son and daughter of God of the super super super life that was in him &gt;&gt; comes back on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't just remain somewhere out in space in another dimension. It actually literally comes back on us. &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Super super super super &gt;&gt; life that comes back was in him comes back on you and changes you from a sinner and the things of the world. And and I love how he says this, not just as a sinner out in there in the barrooms and and maybe at the stampede and doing all that stuff. What does he say here? He changes you from a sinner and the things of the world and a church member, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The legalist, &gt;&gt; and a denominational goer, just a message believer. Are you a Christian? Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believe &gt;&gt; to a born again Christian filled with the spirit. &gt;&gt; Let's not be message believers. Let let's let's be this description right here. I'm a bornagain Christian filled with the spirit. &gt;&gt; When someone asks us what do we believe? That's what I believe. &gt;&gt; I'm a born again Christian that's filled with the spirit of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. the life of God just flowing from you like little sparks from an anvil. Anybody ever hit an anvil? &gt;&gt; You hit an anvil, some red hot metal, you get sparks as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness. And as the Holy Spirit moving, speaking, oh my, there you are. And with what? Hearing the message, watching the pillar of fire and the blessed assurance, I've passed from death unto life. Note therefore no condemnation at all. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If our hearts condemn us not, &gt;&gt; then we have our petition. &gt;&gt; But when we've got that little tiny thing that that inspector has told us over and over and over again at the bottom of the box car and every year that goes by, we just get more stuff piled on top of. It's just going to be a bigger mess to take it all apart on the side of the railroad tracks when it's time for that train to go. &gt;&gt; That's true. If we would just take him at his word. I say, "Lord, help me. I'm not just preaching to you. I'm This is the Lord preaching to me." &gt;&gt; If our hearts condemn us not, then we have our petition. See, we know. But if sin is in our heart, then it condemns us. We just might as well not even start. See, you've got to get free from sin. And the only way you can get free from sin is to get in him. &gt;&gt; That's the only covering there is for sin. &gt;&gt; Christ. Amen. And that truly is the baptism of the Holy Spirit, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; He is more than able. &gt;&gt; Do you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we're so thankful for your covenant, Lord. Oh, Lord Jesus, to know that you have given it to us unconditionally. Father, we don't have to try and do anything. We just need to accept it the way that you've given it, Lord. And it causes us to become a new creature. And Lord, as you show us things in our life that you want to see changed, the forgiveness that you want to see offered, Lord, oh Father, help us to have the courage, Lord Jesus, to do what we've maybe never done before and to step out by faith and trust that you're leading us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, we just want to thank you for your word. Thank you for the covenant. Thank you for the encouragement, Lord, that we know that we can have this no condemnation position in our lives. that we could be free from all of the effects of this world. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, as we walk to walk in our lives full of virtue and love. Lord Jesus, like the sparks flying from an anvil, as we step, oh Lord Jesus, more sparks of life from that pillar of fire to the people around us, Lord, help us literally, Father, in a spiritual sense, set spiritual fires with those sparks, Lord, in the hearts of other people in this world. Father, we don't know how many days we have left. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, through your testimony of life living out through us. Find that last predestinated seed, Lord, &gt;&gt; that we could fulfill our commission here on earth. Lord Jesus, we love you and we thank you. We pray that you would be with those who are traveling, Lord, the Odonovos. Just just bless them abundantly, Father. Brother Toby and his family and brother Farah and his family. Keep your hand upon them, Lord. Bring them back safely at the appointed time. Father, we pray, Lord, that you would be with anyone else who is traveling. Father, we're just so thankful for your goodness and your tender mercy to us. We just ask that you would be glorified now in a couple songs before we part ways, Lord, as we worship you. We just ask, Lord, also that you would give our our friends and our our families, Lord, our brothers and sisters who will be traveling after the service traveling mercies, Lord. keep your hand upon them, Lord, as we go our separate ways. We just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Is that grace? Grace, &gt;&gt; marvelous grace of our loving Lord.
