[38:59] us and father you're so kind and so
[39:02] loving you've enabled us father to
[39:04] experience it once and we know that you
[39:07] had a prophet here on Earth just like
[39:10] you had many times in the past and he
[39:13] was declaring to the world to repent to
[39:16] get back in line with the word and
[39:18] declaring that this world is going
[39:20] through birth pains and the contractions

[39:31] are are getting stronger Lord and father
[39:34] we know that this world can't have very
[39:36] many more

[39:40] promise to your elect lady at the End of
[39:43] Time father that you would not leave her
[39:46] nor forsake her Lord Jesus and father
[39:49] that in a moment in the twinkling of an
[39:51] eye that we would have our bodies
[39:53] changed Lord God and that we would not
[39:56] hinder those who have gone before us
[39:58] Lord oh Lord Jesus that they would come
[40:00] first out of the graves Lord Jesus and

[40:56] allow them to prosper ER just like

[41:00] Lord Jesus shining your light in the
[41:03] corners of the world that they travel to
[41:05] father and the companies they work for
[41:07] and Lord each one of the members of your
[41:10] body Lord Jesus that father when we go
[41:12] to work we would not be normal people
[41:15] father that we would Lord have something
[41:17] that would attract the people Lord that
[41:19] they would see a life being lived out
[41:22] that they would be able to see a Living
[41:24] Word father that it wouldn't be
[41:26] something that we just say we're members
[41:28] of a church but we are that Church
[41:30] Father a tabernacle that you have
[41:32] prepared without hands father that the

[43:25] 2 start at verse one
[43:33] Revelation 2 verse1 unto the angel of
[43:36] the Church of Ephesus write these things
[43:40] saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in
[43:42] his right hand who walketh in the midst
[43:46] of the seven golden
[43:47] candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy
[43:50] labor and thy patience and how thou cast
[43:53] not bear them which are
[43:55] evil and thou tried them which say they
[43:58] are Apostles and are not and H has found
[44:01] them liars and Hast borne and Hast
[44:05] patience and for my name's sake has
[44:07] labored and Hast not fainted
[44:10] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[44:12] thee because thou Hast left thy First
[44:15] Love remember therefore from whence Thou
[44:18] Art fallen and repent and do the first
[44:21] works or else I will come unto thee
[44:24] quickly and will remove thy candlestick
[44:27] out of his place except thou repent but
[44:31] this thou Hast that thou hatest the
[44:34] Deeds of the
[44:35] nians which I also hate he that hath an
[44:39] ear let him hear what the spirit saith

[45:09] we know that your word says that where
[45:11] the carcass is that the Eagles will be
[45:14] gathered and Lord we just ask that you
[45:17] would have your preeminence tonight that
[45:20] father we could all get out of the way
[45:21] and just allow you father to minister to

[45:29] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[45:33] bless you tonight you may be
[45:37] [Music]
[45:38] seated I just can't help but think about
[45:42] the carcass in the
[45:45] Eagles and uh the other morning I was
[45:48] driving back home from dropping the kids
[45:50] off at school and I uh I Saw an Eagle
[45:54] sitting on a fence post just off the
[45:56] highway it was a secondary road so it
[45:58] wasn't a big Highway not a very big
[46:00] ditch either it was minus 20 and uh
[46:04] there was lots of Mag pies and some
[46:05] Ravens and there was this Eagle you
[46:08] could see all the little birds and mag
[46:10] pieses and Ravens are not really small
[46:12] birds but they were tiny compared to
[46:14] this one eagle and this Eagle was
[46:16] sitting on the fence post and uh you
[46:19] know I bet he was probably as far away
[46:21] as the sound booth is from here sitting
[46:23] on the fence post it was minus 20 and he
[46:26] had uh taken from a deer a fresh carcass
[46:30] that was right on the side of the road
[46:32] on the shoulder that must have been hit
[46:34] by a car and uh he had a piece of meat
[46:39] in his Talons on top of that fence post
[46:42] and and I stopped I rolled the window
[46:44] down and I just watched and and I was
[46:47] able to actually watch him for quite a
[46:49] while and I started to have a little
[46:51] conversation with them and uh you know
[46:54] Eagle to Eagle and it was interesting
[46:57] because there was magpies chirping
[46:59] around and flying around and there was
[47:01] the Ravens were chirping around and
[47:02] flying around they were jumping on the
[47:04] fence close to him just looking for him
[47:06] to drop a piece of the meat that he was
[47:08] eating and you know what he didn't even
[47:10] lift his head he wasn't bothered in the
[47:14] least he knew he had fresh meat he was
[47:17] feeding on the carcass and nothing was
[47:20] going to disturb him even my
[47:22] conversation to him I've got the video
[47:25] and I I I might send it out just because
[47:27] of this I shared it with this Bible
[47:29] study in the morning and uh I I'll send
[47:32] it out just because but it just made me
[47:34] think when I was I was there watching
[47:36] him there was nothing going to shake him
[47:38] he wasn't interested in any anything
[47:40] else going on the only thing he wanted
[47:42] to do was Feast on that food and he
[47:44] needed it to sustain him it was C out it
[47:48] was minus 20 and it was it was his Feast
[47:50] it was just wonderful are you happy
[47:53] tonight amen I just want to do a little
[47:55] recap from last week it's just such an
[47:58] amazing topic this exposition of the
[48:00] seven Church ages and the Ephesian
[48:03] Church age we know that a bit of each
[48:06] age applies to this age this is a
[48:08] culmination of all of the ages it's not
[48:11] just exclusive to one age just like
[48:13] scripture is not exclusive to one time
[48:16] or place every scripture has a compound
[48:19] meaning as well as
[48:22] Revelation but you know out of page 90
[48:25] in uh in the exposition of the seven
[48:27] Church ages this is uh under Christ
[48:31] Praises his own paragraph 70 just the
[48:35] end of it brother maybe I'll go back and
[48:38] just read that part paragraph 70 and see
[48:41] what those false apostles were doing
[48:44] they came with their own word those
[48:47] Ephesians knew that word as Paul had
[48:51] taught it they were full of the Holy
[48:53] Ghost by laying on of Paul's hands they
[48:56] looked those false Apostles in the eye
[48:58] and said you are not saying what Paul
[49:01] said you are therefore
[49:03] false brother the BAM says oh that sets
[49:05] my heart on fire get back to the word
[49:09] it's not you that really tries the
[49:11] Apostle and the prophet and the teacher
[49:15] it is the word that tries
[49:17] them he says one of these days there is
[49:20] going to come a prophet to the leoan
[49:22] church age and you will know if he is
[49:24] the real one sent from God or not yes
[49:27] you will for if he is of God he will be
[49:31] in that word exactly as God gave it to
[49:34] Paul he won't deviate from that word for
[49:38] a moment not by one ioda and we know
[49:41] that word ioda is a very small
[49:44] particle from from the Latin language he
[49:49] says in that last age when there will be
[49:52] many false prophets appearing watch and
[49:55] see how they keep telling you that if
[49:58] you don't believe them and what they say
[50:01] you will be lost how many times have we
[50:05] seen that and I I just think it's
[50:06] astounding because I I mentioned it last
[50:09] time and I want to mention it again you
[50:11] know forget about the denominational
[50:13] world but how many people have you seen
[50:16] in and around the message preaching this
[50:19] gospel that if you don't believe them
[50:21] and what they say you will be lost not
[50:24] afraid to destroy families not afraid to
[50:27] destroy churches Not Afraid you know the
[50:31] book of Jude speaks about those
[50:34] men but they're not men they're spirits
[50:37] but they're spirits that get in
[50:39] men brother Brown goes on to say but
[50:41] when that last day Prophet comes on the
[50:44] scene if he is truly that prophet he
[50:47] will be crying out get back to the word
[50:50] or you are lost he won't build on a
[50:53] private Revelation or interpretation but
[50:55] on the word amen and
[50:58] amen and it's just such a an amazing
[51:01] thing when I think about it how isn't it
[51:04] wonderful how much we have with this
[51:07] word from a Vindicated Prophet to give
[51:10] us the
[51:11] absolute Key to Our Success to
[51:15] understand who we are to give us
[51:16] authority over the devil to give us
[51:19] authority over ourselves to understand
[51:22] that we we we will overcome and we will
[51:25] sit with him in his throne we don't have
[51:27] to be judged we don't have to go to the
[51:28] white Throne right we're going to be in
[51:31] that Throne
[51:33] amen you know the leoan church is the
[51:35] only one that's with him in that Throne
[51:38] that's the only one that has that
[51:40] promise but I think it's just amazing
[51:42] how we've been given this opportunity to
[51:46] understand so
[51:48] much we won't be uh misled as long as we
[51:52] have this word and as long as we're
[51:54] willing to take the whole word and
[51:55] nothing but the word
[51:57] there's no false Apostles that are going
[51:58] to come around and be able to mislead us
[52:01] and we might not be able to say I've got
[52:02] an exact scripture and verse where
[52:04] you're wrong I know you misquoted one
[52:06] word we might not be able to do that we
[52:08] might be able to actually say however
[52:11] that's not right there's something in
[52:13] there that's not right and then go and
[52:16] actually study it and find out what's
[52:18] not
[52:18] right but that's the Holy Ghost brothers
[52:21] and sisters when that happens and then
[52:23] the beautiful part is when you bring
[52:25] that and you say Hey you you know what I
[52:26] don't understand this you said this but
[52:29] the word of God says that or you said
[52:31] this and the message of the hour says
[52:32] that what are you saying did you
[52:34] actually do you really believe this and
[52:37] if they're a true son and daughter of
[52:39] God they'll actually fall right in line
[52:40] with the word there won't be any problem
[52:43] saying hey oh my I'm off on that I I
[52:46] actually am wrong do you know that
[52:48] message ministers who truly preach the
[52:50] word of God can say they're
[52:53] wrong right I would fear the ones that
[52:56] say they're not
[52:57] wrong those would be the ones I would be
[53:00] questioning right because man is is
[53:03] always going to make mistakes absolutely
[53:05] the word of God corrects those errors
[53:07] though thank you Lord the spirit of
[53:09] Truth paragraph 72 these false prophets
[53:13] are the Grievious wolves that Paul spoke
[53:15] of this is where we left off last week
[53:19] he said once I am gone they will try to
[53:21] come and claim equal
[53:25] Revelation but they purpose is not to
[53:27] help you but to destroy
[53:30] you and you know what's interesting with
[53:32] this is they're not going to come in and
[53:34] say we're going to take over the
[53:35] building and we're going to toss the
[53:37] chairs and flip over the desks and
[53:39] everything is going to become ours we're
[53:40] going to come in and do that no they're
[53:43] going to come in as an angel of Light
[53:46] and say oh did you ever hear this
[53:48] Revelation did you know that God told me
[53:51] this there will be something different
[53:54] that they're going to bring and you know
[53:56] what it is it tickles the ears of the
[53:58] people who are looking they've got itchy
[54:00] ears looking to Heap to themselves
[54:02] teachers but you know what when you've
[54:04] got the spirit of Christ you're not
[54:05] interested in
[54:06] that you're going to say buddy I've
[54:08] heard it already I I know I've got the
[54:11] pearl of great price I don't have to
[54:13] have a new revelation there's no new
[54:16] revelation Acts 20
[54:20] 27-32 for I have not shun to declare
[54:23] unto you all the counsel of God take
[54:26] heed therefore unto yourselves and to
[54:28] all the flock over which the Holy Ghost
[54:32] hath made you overseers to feed the
[54:34] Church of God which he hath purchased
[54:38] with his own
[54:39] blood and we know that's his inheritance
[54:41] and he is not going to give not one iota
[54:45] of his inheritance away that's right
[54:49] continuing on he says for I know this
[54:50] that after my departing shall Grievious
[54:53] wolves enter in among you not sparing
[54:55] the flock also of your own selves shall
[54:59] men arise this really struck me I've
[55:01] been studying this all week also of your
[55:04] own
[55:07] selves shall men
[55:09] arise speaking perverse things their own
[55:13] word and ideas not God's to draw away
[55:17] disciples after
[55:19] them not even men coming in yes
[55:23] sir therefore watch and remember
[55:26] remember that by the space of three
[55:28] years I ceased not to warn everyone
[55:31] night and day with tears and now brother
[55:34] and I command you to God commend you to
[55:36] God and to the word of his grace which
[55:39] is able to build you up and to give you
[55:42] in inheritance among all them which are
[55:46] Sanctified did you ever think about it
[55:49] we were talking about this but it's just
[55:51] such a powerful Revelation a powerful
[55:54] thought that when we are persecuted for
[55:57] Christ's sake it's his grace towards us
[56:01] and we know brother Bram he has a quote
[56:03] for it I can't remember it off hand I'll
[56:06] probably mix it up if I say it but we
[56:08] know that persecutions when they come
[56:11] for Christ's sake it's his grace towards
[56:13] us and his correction according to his
[56:16] word is his grace towards us it's not to
[56:18] punish us and to destroy us and to break
[56:20] us down is to build us
[56:24] up first joh John
[56:28] 41 brother brandham he says John knew of
[56:31] them also for he said many false
[56:34] prophets are already gone out in the
[56:37] world and brothers and sisters I'm I'm
[56:39] going to say it again we don't need to
[56:41] worry about the denominational world we
[56:43] don't need to worry about all of the
[56:45] ranked sinners in the world what we need
[56:46] to worry about is the people who claim
[56:48] to believe this message of the hour and
[56:51] we need to just call it plainly like
[56:53] that I'm not saying that anyone in here
[56:55] is that way but you know just like most
[56:58] of us we have probably favorite Ministry
[57:01] and and we can get online and go and
[57:03] listen to a Ministry it's so easy to do
[57:06] and and sometimes it's very uplifting
[57:08] but you know what there's a lot of
[57:10] different ideas in this world and now
[57:12] that we have this connection it's a very
[57:14] big pool that we can swim in brothers
[57:16] and sisters and there's a lot of false
[57:19] doctrin swimming around in that pool
[57:21] we've got to be very careful I would
[57:23] never tell you you can't watch anyone
[57:25] else
[57:26] you have to follow just this
[57:29] ministry that's actually falling in line
[57:31] with that what we're talking about you
[57:34] know the word of God says that you
[57:35] should have a pastor there's a five-fold
[57:36] Ministry and that's the way it is there
[57:38] is a five-fold Ministry yes and to try
[57:41] and rule that out is incorrect there's a
[57:43] balance to it though to stay home and
[57:46] say no I'm just going to stream because
[57:47] somewhere somehow some man hurt me or my
[57:50] family and I'll never give them the
[57:51] opportunity to do it again you're
[57:53] discounting discrediting the word of God
[57:56] amen you're saying that there's no way
[57:59] God can still operate in the office of a
[58:02] pastor God helped the pastors pray for
[58:05] the
[58:08] pastors cuz they're going to answer for
[58:10] every single thing that
[58:12] happens every single
[58:15] action but you know it's wonderful to
[58:18] think that even though those false
[58:20] prophets are out there there is a truth
[58:23] and we don't need to be afraid amen I
[58:26] would encourage you to actually listen
[58:29] to different Ministry now I'm going the
[58:31] other way with it but I would encourage
[58:33] you to listen with the ear that God has
[58:36] given you through his Spirit if you can
[58:39] listen through the holy ghost in your
[58:41] life you will be able to tell what's
[58:43] being preached and it won't matter who
[58:45] it is and it won't matter where it's at
[58:48] some of it is very very bold there's one
[58:52] Ministry that I heard of where they're
[58:54] actually praying in this man's
[58:56] name in the
[58:59] message but then there's other ones that
[59:01] will be mostly exactly right even
[59:05] praying in the name of Jesus Christ but
[59:07] one word off is Satan's kingdom one word
[59:10] off is what deceived Eve and you know
[59:13] the church is the feminine Christ is the
[59:17] masculine the church is the feminine so
[59:20] for us to say that the woman she's the
[59:23] weaker vessel who's the the woman in
[59:25] that scenario
[59:27] we need the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[59:29] brothers and sisters we need his spirit
[59:31] in our lives this is a spiritual battle
[59:33] that's being waged and you know when we
[59:34] look around the world we can see natural
[59:36] circumstances and situations and they've
[59:38] got tanks on the ground they've got
[59:39] boots on the ground they've got planes
[59:41] in the sky they're moving forward and
[59:43] they're just crushing the enemy you know
[59:44] what that's what Satan's kingdom is
[59:46] trying to do it's trying to just do an
[59:48] onslaught to the Believers of this age
[59:52] outside of the Holy Ghost we won't
[59:55] stand paragraph 73 that Antichrist
[59:58] Spirit was already infiltrating the
[1:00:00] church and it was doing it by going
[1:00:02] against the word why here is where it
[1:00:05] all started right here in the first
[1:00:08] church age already they were denying the
[1:00:10] word and setting up their own Creeds and
[1:00:12] philosophies instead of the word and we
[1:00:15] know that's a way of thinking the
[1:00:17] philosophy right he says that is
[1:00:20] Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be
[1:00:23] anti- word is to be anti- Jesus to be
[1:00:27] anti- word is to be
[1:00:31] Antichrist you don't have to have the
[1:00:33] mark of the beast remember to reject the
[1:00:35] Holy Ghost is to accept the mark of the
[1:00:37] beast we're born in sin shaped in
[1:00:39] iniquity come into this world speaking
[1:00:40] lies you've already got the mark of the
[1:00:42] beast when you came into this world
[1:00:43] brothers and sisters through this hybrid
[1:00:44] condition to reject the acceptance of
[1:00:47] the Holy Ghost at the age of
[1:00:49] accountability is to already accept what
[1:00:51] you have already you've got the mark of
[1:00:53] the beast that's the way it is but this
[1:00:57] Antichrist for Jesus is the word to be
[1:00:59] anti- word is to be anti- Jesus to be
[1:01:02] anti- word is to be
[1:01:05] Antichrist because the spirit and the
[1:01:07] word are
[1:01:08] one if you are anti-
[1:01:11] word you will have to be Antichrist you
[1:01:14] know I just can't help but think while
[1:01:16] we're preaching this someday and
[1:01:18] hopefully not really soon but someday
[1:01:20] we're going to get shut down for these
[1:01:22] words because people don't want to hear
[1:01:25] this people want to have the Liberty to
[1:01:27] do whatever they want to do right and
[1:01:30] and they want to have the Liberty to
[1:01:31] worship however they want to
[1:01:33] worship but the Believers will say it's
[1:01:36] going to be exactly according to the
[1:01:38] word right yes if you're anti- word you
[1:01:43] will have to be
[1:01:44] Antichrist and if it started in the
[1:01:47] first church it will have to grow until
[1:01:50] the
[1:01:51] end when it takes
[1:01:54] over and that is exactly what you will
[1:01:56] see as we cover all the ages it starts
[1:01:59] out real small in the Ephesian age and
[1:02:01] it grows in every age until the antiw
[1:02:03] word Antichrist system takes over
[1:02:07] entirely and the infallibility of the
[1:02:10] word is
[1:02:11] repudiated by the false Pro false
[1:02:14] Apostles of the false
[1:02:17] church now it's easy to get the wrong
[1:02:19] impression of what we are talking about
[1:02:22] because I'm making this so
[1:02:24] strong it could sound to you as though
[1:02:27] this anti- word Antichrist spirit is a
[1:02:30] complete repudiation of the word a
[1:02:34] denial of the Bible C culminating in its
[1:02:37] rejection no sir it's not that what it
[1:02:41] is Revelations 22:18-19 for I testify
[1:02:45] unto every man that heareth the words of
[1:02:47] the prophecy of this book If any man
[1:02:50] shall add unto these things God shall
[1:02:53] add unto him the plagues that are
[1:02:54] written in this book and if any man
[1:02:56] shall take away from the words of this
[1:02:58] book of this prophecy God shall take
[1:03:00] away his part out of the book of life
[1:03:03] and out of the holy city and from the
[1:03:06] things which are written in this
[1:03:09] book it always goes back to the
[1:03:12] scripture paragraph 75 it is the
[1:03:15] changing of even just one word by taking
[1:03:20] way or adding to it and this is why
[1:03:23] brothers and sisters I mentioned it a
[1:03:25] while ago but you know the prophet in
[1:03:27] our day he used the King James version
[1:03:29] Bible and some of the other Bibles that
[1:03:33] that are out there they're available I I
[1:03:36] I look at the Amplified Bible once in a
[1:03:38] while and compare words just maybe
[1:03:40] scriptures just to maybe get a different
[1:03:41] perspective on it but I always go back
[1:03:43] to the King James version and that's my
[1:03:45] desire is to encourage people always
[1:03:47] just go back to the King James version
[1:03:49] make that your anchor and if there's
[1:03:50] something in there that we can't
[1:03:51] understand just ask God for Spiritual
[1:03:53] Revelation ask him to reveal what
[1:03:55] scripture means and he is obligated by
[1:03:58] that because he is his word his word is
[1:04:00] him in print form but some Bibles
[1:04:03] actually eliminate entire verses some
[1:04:06] Bibles eliminate words out of verses
[1:04:09] they change the meaning of the verse
[1:04:11] right one of these days we'll do a very
[1:04:13] clear demonstration of that we'll show
[1:04:16] which Bibles actually do some of those
[1:04:18] things it's it's important it's vital
[1:04:21] it's the trick of the devil that's what
[1:04:23] he did in the very beginning In the
[1:04:24] Garden of Eden take one word or add one
[1:04:28] word you take your part out of The Book
[1:04:30] of Life paragraph 75 it is the changing
[1:04:33] of even just one word by taking away or
[1:04:37] adding to it it is the original trick of
[1:04:39] Satan in the Garden of Eden he just
[1:04:42] added one little word to what God had
[1:04:44] said that did it it brought death and
[1:04:47] destruction and in Ephesus it was just
[1:04:50] the same just a word added just a word
[1:04:53] taken away and the antiw word Antichrist
[1:04:57] Spirit began to flourish remember the
[1:05:01] the statue of Diana that brother Bram
[1:05:04] talked about it was just a very vague
[1:05:06] figure it just was a a very fague
[1:05:09] feminine feminine figure and it didn't
[1:05:12] have very much to it it wasn't very
[1:05:13] appealing and it just had two arms of
[1:05:15] iron it was a very very subtle thing and
[1:05:19] and that was actually just the beginning
[1:05:22] but that's how Satan does it very subtle
[1:05:25] brother Bram he says that that anti-
[1:05:28] word Antichrist Spirit began to flourish
[1:05:32] just by one word one word
[1:05:35] off he says do you get it now paragraph
[1:05:38] 76 there are those twins
[1:05:41] again there are those two trees again
[1:05:44] growing side by side in the same Earth
[1:05:48] partaking of the same nourishment
[1:05:51] drinking in the same rain and benefiting
[1:05:55] by the same
[1:05:56] son but they come from different
[1:06:00] seeds one tree is for the word of God
[1:06:04] exactly as God gave it and loves and
[1:06:07] obeys it the other
[1:06:10] tree is from the seed that is anti the
[1:06:15] word of God and changes it where it
[1:06:18] wants to it substitutes its own Creeds
[1:06:22] and dogmas for the living true word
[1:06:27] exactly as Cain did who ended up killing
[1:06:32] Abel remember they both woried they both
[1:06:35] were raised in a good message home they
[1:06:39] had message believing parents yeah Adam
[1:06:42] was the son of God he never had a belly
[1:06:45] button God formed him and I can imagine
[1:06:49] Eve never had one either because God
[1:06:52] formed her out of Adam's Rib she was
[1:06:55] actually a part of him but these two
[1:06:58] boys they actually had the same parents
[1:07:00] they knew how to worship but one had a
[1:07:03] revelation and one just had an
[1:07:06] instruction and isn't it interesting
[1:07:08] even the one that just had an
[1:07:11] instruction he couldn't receive the
[1:07:13] instruction right even though he was
[1:07:15] given the
[1:07:16] correction he wasn't able to receive
[1:07:18] that correction which identified him it
[1:07:21] identified his seed it identified his
[1:07:23] nature his father's nature because he
[1:07:25] turned into a a murderer he was angry he
[1:07:28] turned into a murderer a liar uh uh it's
[1:07:31] just ridiculous what what what happened
[1:07:34] the depths of Satan but that's you know
[1:07:36] that was his father he was a chip off
[1:07:37] the old
[1:07:40] block the other tree is from the seed
[1:07:43] that is anti- word of God and changes it
[1:07:45] where it wants to it substitutes its own
[1:07:46] Creeds and dogmas for the living true
[1:07:49] word exactly as did Cain who ended up
[1:07:53] killing Abel he said says but fear not
[1:07:56] little flock stay with the word we just
[1:07:59] want to stay with the word that's all we
[1:08:01] want to do keep that word between you
[1:08:04] and the devil Eve did not do that and
[1:08:08] she failed and when the church lets down
[1:08:12] on the word she goes into the depths of
[1:08:15] the darkness of
[1:08:17] Satan but remember the church doesn't
[1:08:20] actually close the doors and shut off
[1:08:22] the lights and and go out of existence
[1:08:25] the church goes on worshiping and you
[1:08:27] know what the church might actually
[1:08:29] begin to prosper the church might
[1:08:31] actually begin to thrive and bring new
[1:08:33] members in and actually have just a
[1:08:36] wonderful time of signs wonders and
[1:08:38] miracles but it doesn't mean they're
[1:08:43] right Revelations
[1:08:45] 2:3 and Hast born and Hast patience and
[1:08:48] for my name's sake H has labored and
[1:08:50] Hast not
[1:08:52] fainted he says this is just about the
[1:08:54] same as was said in verse two but in
[1:08:57] verse two the work labor and patience
[1:09:00] were from guarding the sacred word which
[1:09:04] was committed unto them how they kept
[1:09:07] away the
[1:09:08] adversaries what a credit they were to
[1:09:12] Paul and I remember thinking about this
[1:09:14] a long time ago and I just remember
[1:09:15] thinking I have an opportunity to be a
[1:09:18] credit to my pastor I have an
[1:09:21] opportunity to be actually something
[1:09:24] that would be a ability or a debit to my
[1:09:27] pastor or I could be a credit to my
[1:09:29] pastor and you know I chose to try my
[1:09:33] best to be a credit to my pastor and I
[1:09:35] know many times I probably failed that
[1:09:37] way but I thought it was so wonderful
[1:09:39] because I had the opportunity to try and
[1:09:41] actually encourage him and just show him
[1:09:45] that there was someone in his Corner
[1:09:47] that that someone is pushing for him and
[1:09:49] and this just really kind of encouraged
[1:09:51] me that way what a credit they were to
[1:09:53] Paul but in this verse their
[1:09:56] persecutions and trials and Patience are
[1:09:59] over the Blessed name of Jesus it had
[1:10:02] nothing to do with them it was all about
[1:10:04] the name of
[1:10:07] Jesus he says you know that is not at
[1:10:09] all strange for it is the word and the
[1:10:12] name that brings the enemy pouring after
[1:10:14] us like a flood that Mighty word which
[1:10:18] was manifested in healing signs and
[1:10:20] wonders and other
[1:10:23] demonstrations caused the Pharisees to
[1:10:25] to scream out for the death of the True
[1:10:28] Believers and now that name hated and
[1:10:32] despised by the Jews is mocked by the
[1:10:35] cultured as they laugh to think anyone
[1:10:39] could be so foolish as to believe in a
[1:10:41] man who died and rose again and is now
[1:10:43] seated in
[1:10:45] heaven I just can't help but think it's
[1:10:47] the exact same spirit that would say
[1:10:50] everyone else is baptizing in the name
[1:10:53] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:10:54] Holy Ghost
[1:10:56] and your little groups of people are
[1:10:58] baptizing in this name isn't it the same
[1:11:01] Spirit brothers and sisters it's the
[1:11:03] name that brings the persecution because
[1:11:05] the name is what contains the power we
[1:11:09] can claim the blood all we want but if
[1:11:12] you've got the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:14] that's where demons
[1:11:17] tremble but he goes on to say who to
[1:11:19] them was a false Messiah they were they
[1:11:22] were I'll just go back and pick up that
[1:11:24] again I always get in the
[1:11:27] way oh this word is so
[1:11:30] good they hated and despised by the Jews
[1:11:33] is mocked by the cultured as they laugh
[1:11:35] to think anyone could be so foolish as
[1:11:37] to believe in a man who died and rose
[1:11:38] again is now seated in heaven so here
[1:11:41] were the religious persecutors the Jews
[1:11:44] cursing this
[1:11:46] Jesus who to them was a false Messiah
[1:11:49] and here were the others laughing with
[1:11:52] delight and mocking sarcastic ially at
[1:11:56] the name of a new God who to them wasn't
[1:12:00] God at all
[1:12:03] right this just made me while I was
[1:12:05] studying this pondering it made me think
[1:12:08] about the the two maleactors on the
[1:12:11] cross you know yeah both of them
[1:12:14] committed crimes worthy of death a and
[1:12:18] one on one hand and one on the other and
[1:12:20] one of them was saying the same thing as
[1:12:22] the most religious as these Jews that
[1:12:24] were mocking him and laughing at him
[1:12:26] while he was there on the cross in the
[1:12:28] middle of the two a and he was saying yo
[1:12:32] Jesus you're you're a a miracle man get
[1:12:34] us down man let us get out of here
[1:12:36] there's no reason for us to perish if
[1:12:39] you're if you're this Christ if you
[1:12:41] could save everyone else save us and the
[1:12:44] other one is the one that corrected him
[1:12:46] isn't that interesting the other one is
[1:12:48] the one that said hey you fool we're
[1:12:52] worthy of this punishment you know that
[1:12:54] we are but this man this man is innocent
[1:12:57] he has done
[1:12:59] nothing and we know that Jesus said hey
[1:13:01] you know what he asked him will you
[1:13:04] remember me remember me when you're in
[1:13:06] your in your kingdom don't forget about
[1:13:08] me man and Jesus said you
[1:13:11] know for that saying you'll be with me
[1:13:14] in Paradise isn't that interesting and
[1:13:17] we've all probably heard the story
[1:13:18] recently but I just want to throw this
[1:13:20] out there because you know what will
[1:13:22] people say how are you bapti AP
[1:13:25] ized what did you do how how long did
[1:13:28] you serve in your church what was your
[1:13:30] tenure what's your lineage how long did
[1:13:32] you believe the message of the hour this
[1:13:34] guy's going to say hey you know what I
[1:13:36] just met this man I met the man named
[1:13:39] Jesus that's all I can tell you I don't
[1:13:41] have any theology I can just say that I
[1:13:44] met him and I believe
[1:13:47] him but here we have these people
[1:13:49] mocking him and and it's no different
[1:13:51] the same Spirits yes sir paragraph 79
[1:13:55] now here is something else that started
[1:13:57] in that age and will continue right down
[1:13:59] Through the Ages getting deeper and
[1:14:01] darker that is
[1:14:03] people were repudiating that
[1:14:07] name it was not the true Ephesian church
[1:14:10] that was doing it no sir it was the
[1:14:13] false Apostles yes it was The Outsider
[1:14:18] trying to get in and defile the
[1:14:21] Believers the Ephesians knew that name
[1:14:25] and loved it recall the origin of that
[1:14:28] Ephesian church a little group of people
[1:14:31] who were looking for the Messiah heard
[1:14:34] that a prophet who called himself the
[1:14:37] Forerunner of the Messiah had appeared
[1:14:39] in the desert of Palestine and was
[1:14:41] baptizing people unto repentance of
[1:14:44] sins these then receiving the baptism of
[1:14:48] John but when Paul came to them he
[1:14:51] showed them that a prophet that the
[1:14:54] prophet was dead said that Jesus had
[1:14:56] come and fulfilled his life as a
[1:14:58] sacrifice for sin and that now the Holy
[1:15:02] Ghost was come and would enter in and
[1:15:05] fill all True Believers in Jesus the
[1:15:09] Messiah when they heard of this they
[1:15:12] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:15:15] Jesus you know just as I was studying
[1:15:18] this I couldn't help but think there was
[1:15:19] a time and a place where there was a man
[1:15:22] on Earth who was baptizing in an
[1:15:25] afternoon about the 17th person in the
[1:15:27] Ohio river and what happened something
[1:15:30] very similar to this scenario happened a
[1:15:33] light came down and said just as John
[1:15:36] was sent to forerun the first coming of
[1:15:39] the Lord so you and your ministry will
[1:15:42] forerun the second coming of the Lord
[1:15:44] Jesus Christ and even there in that
[1:15:47] situation we know there was a girl
[1:15:48] sitting up on the bank I think even in a
[1:15:50] boat and she was mocking the prophet she
[1:15:53] was laughing she wasn't taking it
[1:15:55] serious one bit isn't that the exact
[1:15:57] same spirit that we were just talking
[1:15:59] about at the cross of Jesus and the most
[1:16:01] religious people those most religious
[1:16:03] ones not everyone can see it if we have
[1:16:06] the ability to see this it's truly a
[1:16:09] blessing truly a gift from God goes on
[1:16:13] to say and when Paul had laid his hands
[1:16:14] upon them they were all filled with the
[1:16:16] Holy Ghost they knew what it was to obey
[1:16:19] the word to be baptized in His Name Lord
[1:16:22] Jesus Christ and in that way they knew
[1:16:27] they would be filled with the Holy
[1:16:29] Spirit you could not get that people to
[1:16:32] change they knew the truth of Acts
[1:16:36] 19 veres
[1:16:39] 1-7 paragraph 80 they knew the power of
[1:16:43] that name they saw that name was so
[1:16:46] powerful that even aprons taken from the
[1:16:50] body of Paul and sent in jesus' name to
[1:16:53] suffering people could deliver the sick
[1:16:55] from all manner of diseases and cast out
[1:16:58] evil spirits so manifestly wonderful did
[1:17:03] that name perform that reprobate Jews at
[1:17:07] Ephesus attempted to use it to exercise
[1:17:10] Devils I'm just going to pause there for
[1:17:12] a second brothers and sisters make no
[1:17:14] mistake about it that was not just
[1:17:16] something from Paul that was not just
[1:17:19] something from William Mary and branam
[1:17:21] the same principle applies and it's all
[1:17:24] based on faith if a True Believer any
[1:17:27] True Believer even the smallest of child
[1:17:31] prays over a
[1:17:33] garment and gives that to someone that's
[1:17:36] a prayer cloth if they have the same
[1:17:39] spirit that was in Paul then the same
[1:17:42] action has to take place he's the same
[1:17:45] yesterday today and forever it does not
[1:17:48] take a great ministry and I know some
[1:17:50] folks might be saying Oh Brother Barry
[1:17:52] now you're pushing it we either have the
[1:17:53] same Spirit or we don't brothers and
[1:17:55] sisters he is either the same yesterday
[1:17:57] today and forever it it's got to be
[1:17:59] Jesus
[1:18:01] Christ I I think I would be very afraid
[1:18:04] if we actually look to other Ministries
[1:18:06] maybe pastors or or prophets or
[1:18:09] evangelists or teachers and said they're
[1:18:11] the only ones that have the ability to
[1:18:13] pray over a prayer cloth and actually
[1:18:15] give it to someone and see that someone
[1:18:17] put it against their body just like we
[1:18:19] talked about here in this in this book
[1:18:21] tonight the scripture about Paul having
[1:18:23] prayer cloths it's got to be the same
[1:18:26] Jesus Christ I think I would be afraid
[1:18:29] if we have a trust in somebody else more
[1:18:32] than we would have faith in our ability
[1:18:34] to take him at his word
[1:18:37] ourselves and I know that's a stretch
[1:18:39] maybe for some people but brothers and
[1:18:41] sisters we're not here to stay in the
[1:18:44] same
[1:18:44] place God is only interested in one
[1:18:47] thing in every single one of our lives
[1:18:49] and that is spiritual
[1:18:50] growth and if we're not growing we're
[1:18:53] dying that's the law of the universe
[1:18:55] here there's no neutral ground where I
[1:18:58] can just say hey I can just coast and
[1:19:00] I'll just be fine that's where the
[1:19:02] devil's going to come and get you and
[1:19:04] you know the devil he can't get you
[1:19:06] entirely God will say you know what if
[1:19:08] you're my son I'll I'll just say who's
[1:19:10] going to who's going to bring my word to
[1:19:12] pass in my son or my daughter's life
[1:19:15] they're just a little bit out of line we
[1:19:16] need somebody to come and actually do
[1:19:18] something for them who's going to do
[1:19:19] that for me and we know there's spirits
[1:19:22] that are right there saying I'll go
[1:19:25] they can't wait to get a chance and
[1:19:26] he'll say do what you want to do but you
[1:19:28] cannot go any further than what his
[1:19:31] parameters are we're not wrestling
[1:19:33] against flesh and blood brothers and
[1:19:34] sisters it's a spiritual Onslaught that
[1:19:36] we're dealing
[1:19:38] with going into this scripture here I
[1:19:41] think it's so good I don't know how far
[1:19:42] we'll get acts 191 to1 17 you want to
[1:19:46] turn there tonight or we could just read
[1:19:48] it here you don't have to
[1:19:50] turn it's it's in
[1:19:53] here I for that we have
[1:19:56] this and God wrought special Miracles by
[1:20:00] the hands of
[1:20:01] Paul so that from his body were brought
[1:20:05] unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons
[1:20:08] and the diseases departed from them and
[1:20:10] the evil spirits went out of
[1:20:14] them I just love how it's it's Crystal
[1:20:16] Clear in the scripture here it's not
[1:20:18] just diseases something scientifically
[1:20:20] classified and named it's a devil that's
[1:20:25] then certain of the Vagabond Jews
[1:20:27] exorcists took upon them to call over
[1:20:30] them which had evil spirits in the name
[1:20:33] of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure You
[1:20:37] by Jesus whom Paul preacheth
[1:20:42] workers of iniquity right here and there
[1:20:46] were seven sons of one CA a Jew and a
[1:20:49] chief of the priests which did so and
[1:20:53] the evil spirit answered answered and
[1:20:55] said Jesus I know and Paul I know but
[1:20:58] who are ye and this just really speaks
[1:21:00] to me because when I first became a
[1:21:03] Christian when I first started attending
[1:21:05] I remember brother Ken preaching a
[1:21:07] sermon on this scripture in the upper
[1:21:09] room and man it was powerful it just
[1:21:11] really captivated me to think that
[1:21:14] there's people that will try and and
[1:21:16] deal with Spirits they will try and
[1:21:19] actually act like they've got some sort
[1:21:21] of a a thing going on and the reason I
[1:21:23] say this is because I was raised in a
[1:21:25] church and I went out into the world and
[1:21:26] I used to stay up very late and watch
[1:21:28] television and I would watch the
[1:21:30] televangelist and I would click and
[1:21:32] watch another Tel evangelist and click
[1:21:34] and watch another Tel evangelist and see
[1:21:36] the the things that they're doing with
[1:21:37] the people and how there's healings and
[1:21:40] and and there was one of them that would
[1:21:41] that would scream and yell and he would
[1:21:43] talk about death deaf girl and I
[1:21:45] remember him pulling on her ears saying
[1:21:48] come out in the name of Jesus and just
[1:21:50] doing all this and but I just remember
[1:21:52] seeing all of that and thinking is this
[1:21:54] even real is there anything to this this
[1:21:56] is all just a a bunch of Lies they're
[1:21:59] all just pretending false Pretenders but
[1:22:01] here in this scripture I'm able to see
[1:22:04] that no there's people that actually do
[1:22:06] attempt to do this there's people that
[1:22:08] really do try and control the
[1:22:12] situation my goodness we can carry on
[1:22:15] and the evil spirit answered and said
[1:22:17] Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are
[1:22:20] ye and the man in whom the evil spirit
[1:22:23] was leapt on them and overcame them and
[1:22:26] prevailed against them so that they fled
[1:22:28] out of that house naked and
[1:22:31] wounded and this was known to all the
[1:22:33] Jews and Greeks also dwelling in Ephesus
[1:22:35] and fear fell on them all and the name
[1:22:38] of the Lord Jesus was
[1:22:42] magnified we talked about it a while ago
[1:22:44] brothers and sisters Spirits are nothing
[1:22:46] to play with you got to know where
[1:22:48] you're
[1:22:49] standing and you know it's it's a real
[1:22:52] thing it's a very real thing but we know
[1:22:56] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:22:58] is in the world and we need to be able
[1:23:00] to say those words that scripture with
[1:23:03] authority with conviction we need to
[1:23:05] know where we
[1:23:06] stand because if we don't we can be
[1:23:11] overrun paragraph
[1:23:14] 81 they knew the righteous life that
[1:23:17] accompanied the bearing of that name for
[1:23:20] whosoever nameth the name of the Lord 2
[1:23:23] Timothy 2 19 let him depart from sin be
[1:23:27] holy ye that bear the vessels of the
[1:23:29] Lord Isaiah 52:11 Thou shalt not bear
[1:23:32] the name of the Lord thy God in vain
[1:23:35] Exodus 20:7 these Ephesians were
[1:23:39] Christians they bore a name and that
[1:23:42] name was Christ who was the spirit of
[1:23:45] God within them and which was one of the
[1:23:48] three-fold names of their lord and for
[1:23:52] my name's sake has labored and has not
[1:23:55] fainted these Believers weren't laboring
[1:23:57] for Paul or for an
[1:24:00] organization they weren't committed to
[1:24:02] programs and institutions whereby they
[1:24:05] built up Holdings of value they worked
[1:24:08] for the Lord they were his servants not
[1:24:12] the ponds of
[1:24:15] organization they didn't go to church on
[1:24:17] Sunday and talk about that name and then
[1:24:21] forget it the rest of the
[1:24:23] week
[1:24:26] I just want to pause there that's a very
[1:24:28] important
[1:24:32] point they didn't give lip service to
[1:24:35] that name no sir it was their lives that
[1:24:39] were given amen and you know brothers
[1:24:42] and sisters those ones who were the
[1:24:44] seven sons of one siba they were the
[1:24:47] ones that gave lip service to that name
[1:24:50] they were the ones that spoke the name
[1:24:52] probably on Sunday and maybe Wednesday
[1:24:56] but didn't give a thought about it the
[1:24:57] rest of the week there was no
[1:24:59] consideration for
[1:25:01] it paragraph
[1:25:03] 83 all they did they did in that name
[1:25:07] speaking about the Believers the
[1:25:08] Ephesian Church the real Church in that
[1:25:11] name they acted but if they could not
[1:25:14] act in that name then they refrained
[1:25:16] from acting these were Heavenly placed
[1:25:20] Christians whose Behavior was in the
[1:25:23] Lord but that false fineing group that
[1:25:26] wanted to defile that name hung like
[1:25:30] skull king wolves in the dark waiting to
[1:25:34] get in and tear down but the Saints
[1:25:37] stood the test and kept the word and the
[1:25:41] name you know brothers and sisters when
[1:25:43] we look at this we can see that there is
[1:25:45] the True Vine and there is the false
[1:25:47] Vine and and they're always going to be
[1:25:50] together and you know the True Vine
[1:25:53] doesn't behave like the false Vine the
[1:25:56] True Vine has the ability to perceive
[1:26:00] because of the spirit that's in her the
[1:26:02] True Vine has the ability to see those
[1:26:05] people who maybe aren't acting like True
[1:26:07] Vine but the True Vine doesn't have the
[1:26:10] ability to determine whether someone is
[1:26:12] a True Vine or isn't a True Vine the
[1:26:15] only thing that True Vine does or has
[1:26:17] the ability to do is to perceive their
[1:26:20] behavior right
[1:26:22] now the True Believer doesn't work like
[1:26:25] a skullking wolf and say oh my where's
[1:26:28] the Believers doesn't anybody believe
[1:26:30] like I
[1:26:31] believe how can that be no that's
[1:26:35] getting a little Pious and a little
[1:26:37] puffed up the True Believer says my if
[1:26:40] the people won't believe that I'm going
[1:26:42] to pray more if the people won't sing
[1:26:44] that I'm going to sing louder if the
[1:26:46] people won't go to church I'm going to
[1:26:47] go to church
[1:26:49] more the True Vine is going to be an
[1:26:51] encouragement to everyone the false Vine
[1:26:55] is going to be the one that just can't
[1:26:56] take it but it's not up to the True Vine
[1:26:59] to determine who the false Vine is right
[1:27:03] the True Vine just wants to encourage
[1:27:05] life
[1:27:10] amen but that false fine group that
[1:27:12] wanted to defile the name hung like
[1:27:15] skullking wolves in the dark waiting to
[1:27:17] get in to tear down but the Saints stood
[1:27:21] the test and kept the word and the name
[1:27:24] I just love how brother Bram said that
[1:27:26] earlier in this book they just kept the
[1:27:28] word between them and Satan we need to
[1:27:31] just keep that word between us and Satan
[1:27:34] and we need to do that in such a way
[1:27:36] that we know where we stand and you know
[1:27:39] some people are going to say you're holy
[1:27:40] rollers but you know there's there's
[1:27:43] those who are Holy Rollers that are
[1:27:44] praying and looking out for others and
[1:27:46] then there's those who are the Holy
[1:27:47] Rollers that we would say holy rollers
[1:27:49] that are saying oh my nobody is good
[1:27:52] like me look at me I never see
[1:27:54] everything in my life is good I want to
[1:27:57] say this which one is the skullking
[1:28:00] wolf remember the word of God says that
[1:28:03] Grievious wolves will get in not sparing
[1:28:05] the flock it's not going to be out there
[1:28:08] somewhere brothers and sisters and you
[1:28:10] know what was the biggest sin what was
[1:28:12] the first sin in heaven the very first
[1:28:15] sin in heaven was
[1:28:17] Pride that was the biggest one brothers
[1:28:19] and sisters and we know that we suffer
[1:28:21] from one of three the lust of the flesh
[1:28:24] the lust of the eyes or the pride of
[1:28:26] life now we might not be like maybe one
[1:28:28] of these high rollers in the states that
[1:28:30] are billionaires and have the the suits
[1:28:32] and the Jets and the cars and all of the
[1:28:35] watches and everything else going on the
[1:28:37] houses and whatever but we could just be
[1:28:41] full of Pride sitting in a church
[1:28:43] thinking that I'm okay that I've never
[1:28:46] done anything wrong and it's the same
[1:28:48] Spirit that's anointing that person
[1:28:50] that's anointing these other people who
[1:28:51] are blatant full of pride but we need to
[1:28:54] know where we stand the True Vine is not
[1:28:57] going to be puffed up the True Vine is
[1:28:59] going to be humble amen and meek and of
[1:29:04] a good nature and we know the fruit of
[1:29:06] the spirit we can go into that but I'm
[1:29:08] not going to tonight maybe on Sunday we
[1:29:09] will but you know it's very
[1:29:13] clear the true and the false but the
[1:29:16] True Vine doesn't destroy the false the
[1:29:19] True Vine doesn't judge the false the
[1:29:21] True Vine
[1:29:23] encourages
[1:29:24] the complaint of God Revelations 2:4
[1:29:27] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[1:29:29] thee because thou Hast left thy first
[1:29:32] love to understand this you must realize
[1:29:35] that the spirit is not speaking to the
[1:29:38] original Saints of Ephesus alone this
[1:29:41] message is to the entire age which
[1:29:43] lasted about 120 years its message then
[1:29:47] is to all the generations in that span
[1:29:50] Now history keeps repeating itself in
[1:29:52] the generations of Israel we see Revival
[1:29:54] in one generation only to see the fires
[1:29:57] fading in the next in the third
[1:29:59] generation Embers may be growing
[1:30:01] slightly glowing slightly but in the
[1:30:04] fourth there may be no vestage
[1:30:06] whatsoever of that original
[1:30:09] flame then God lights the fire again and
[1:30:12] the same process is repeated it is
[1:30:15] simply the manifestation of the truth
[1:30:18] that God has no
[1:30:21] grandchildren there's no Apostolic
[1:30:23] succession brothers and sisters and the
[1:30:26] prophet says it here but just because
[1:30:28] Mom and Dad believed this message of the
[1:30:31] hour doesn't mean automatically the
[1:30:33] children are
[1:30:34] saved right we have to work out our own
[1:30:37] salvation with fear and
[1:30:40] trembling but I would go a step further
[1:30:43] to say that if we can believe then we
[1:30:46] have the ability to apply the token to
[1:30:48] our family amen and maybe maybe we could
[1:30:54] in a situation where our family doesn't
[1:30:56] get to go in a Rapture with us that's
[1:30:58] God's choice that's not ours and we're
[1:31:01] not going to say one way or the other
[1:31:02] but just to maybe bring some some light
[1:31:04] to the situation that doesn't mean that
[1:31:06] they're lost doesn't mean they're lost
[1:31:09] one bit right amen they might actually
[1:31:13] be saved it's not up to us to say who is
[1:31:16] or who isn't brothers and sisters it's
[1:31:18] not the spirit of Christ that does
[1:31:21] that we just want to believe
[1:31:25] my God then God lights the fire again
[1:31:28] the same process is repeated it is
[1:31:30] simply the manifestation of the truth
[1:31:32] that God has no grandchildren salvation
[1:31:35] is not passed on by natural birth
[1:31:37] anymore than there is any truth to
[1:31:40] Apostolic succession it isn't the word
[1:31:44] you start out with truly Born Again
[1:31:47] Believers and when the next Generation
[1:31:49] comes along they are no longer just
[1:31:52] plain Christians
[1:31:54] but they have taken a denominational
[1:31:56] name and are now Baptists Methodist Etc
[1:32:01] that is exactly what they are to they
[1:32:04] are not
[1:32:05] Christians you have to be born of the
[1:32:08] will of God not the will of man to be
[1:32:10] saved and that's why I say brothers and
[1:32:13] sisters just because we're in the
[1:32:14] message of the hour don't mean nothing
[1:32:18] right you got to be
[1:32:20] saved our children need the baptism of
[1:32:24] the Holy
[1:32:25] Ghost our friends and our family need
[1:32:27] the baptism of the Holy Spirit we all do
[1:32:30] but just to say that we're a member of a
[1:32:32] church it doesn't mean nothing that's
[1:32:35] right when we go out and try and contend
[1:32:37] in this world and there's people that
[1:32:39] hear that we're a part of a
[1:32:42] church and and their behavior the Devils
[1:32:45] that are inside of them begin to loathe
[1:32:48] our
[1:32:48] existence those devils are going to come
[1:32:51] after you they're going to come after us
[1:32:54] we need to know where we stand brothers
[1:32:56] and sisters this ain't no time to play
[1:32:58] church and say that I believe the
[1:33:00] message of the hour but I'm not willing
[1:33:02] to give my life all the
[1:33:07] way I just can't I just can't help it
[1:33:10] brothers and
[1:33:12] sisters I would say it's the anointing
[1:33:15] maybe call it the gift we have to get
[1:33:17] into Christ we cannot be playing church
[1:33:20] we can't just be coming to church we've
[1:33:22] got to get the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:33:25] maybe this is a little bit about how the
[1:33:27] the prophets have felt in the past I'm
[1:33:28] not trying to make myself anyone like a
[1:33:31] prophet or anything but the only thing
[1:33:32] we've got is the holy spirit brothers
[1:33:34] and
[1:33:35] sisters outside of that we can have a
[1:33:38] Bible and it's not going to mean
[1:33:39] anything I I heard someone saying that
[1:33:42] they have children that go to school a
[1:33:44] Christian School and and they're being
[1:33:46] taught to memorize entire chapters of
[1:33:48] the Bible and isn't that wonderful I
[1:33:51] thought my goodness how could they do
[1:33:53] that and I know that there was a time in
[1:33:55] my life where they were doing that with
[1:33:56] the children and of course I was not
[1:33:58] that studious I don't know if I ever
[1:34:00] will be but you know it's interesting
[1:34:02] because the children they can do it they
[1:34:05] can learn the entire book the entire
[1:34:08] chapter upon chapter upon chapter and
[1:34:11] that's good isn't it but do they have an
[1:34:14] understanding of that
[1:34:15] word is there an actual Revelation
[1:34:18] that's coming into their life many
[1:34:21] people can be book smart
[1:34:24] but not very Street
[1:34:26] wise and we need to know exactly where
[1:34:28] we stand the only way we're going to be
[1:34:29] able to have this word have power that
[1:34:32] manifests in our lives is to have the
[1:34:34] Holy Ghost because when the two come
[1:34:37] together that's the power that's the
[1:34:38] mechanics is the word and the Dynamics
[1:34:41] is the spirit and when those two come
[1:34:43] together in the heart of a Believer
[1:34:44] watch out brothers and sisters that's
[1:34:46] where the devil has no power over
[1:34:51] you my you have to be born of the will
[1:34:55] of God not the will of man to be saved
[1:34:57] but these folks are all coming together
[1:35:00] now by the will of man I don't say that
[1:35:02] some of them aren't right with God not
[1:35:04] for a minute do I say that but the
[1:35:06] original fires has died down they are
[1:35:09] not the same anymore the fervent desire
[1:35:12] to please God the passion to know his
[1:35:14] word the cry for reaching out in the
[1:35:17] spirit all begins to fade and instead of
[1:35:21] that church being on fire with the fire
[1:35:23] of God it is cooled off and become a bit
[1:35:27] formal now I want to say this brothers
[1:35:30] and
[1:35:31] sisters I don't want to be formal and I
[1:35:34] don't want us to get too
[1:35:36] formal if we're being led by the spirit
[1:35:38] then we need to be led by the spirit we
[1:35:41] can start to create parameters and start
[1:35:43] to set things up and make things certain
[1:35:46] ways and do things certain somehow and
[1:35:48] and make things just perfect according
[1:35:50] to our thinking but is that what he
[1:35:53] wants
[1:35:54] he wants the praise from our hearts the
[1:35:58] fruit of our worship on our lips that's
[1:36:00] what he's looking for and if we're
[1:36:03] holding back because of some program or
[1:36:05] some thing in our life that we're doing
[1:36:08] brothers and sisters let's just take a
[1:36:09] step backwards and say Lord what do you
[1:36:12] want from me what's my purpose of coming
[1:36:15] to worship am I just coming to say that
[1:36:18] I'm going to church and and it's a nice
[1:36:20] way to say I go to church I'm going to
[1:36:22] worship this morning or am I going like
[1:36:25] the sons of
[1:36:27] God like the morning stars that sang
[1:36:30] together and what did the sons of God do
[1:36:33] they shouted to the
[1:36:35] Lord they weren't
[1:36:38] quiet and I can imagine they never let
[1:36:40] nothing get in the way of their worship
[1:36:42] nothing nothing stopped them not one
[1:36:46] ioda of anything can hold back worship
[1:36:49] true worship from a son or daughter of
[1:36:52] God Jesus said that the rocks will cry
[1:36:55] out that was God speaking through him
[1:36:57] right if you won't worship then the
[1:37:00] rocks will immediately cry
[1:37:03] out
[1:37:07] why oh
[1:37:09] my we don't want to get a bit
[1:37:12] formal that is what was happening back
[1:37:14] there to Ephesus they were getting a bit
[1:37:17] formal the abandonment of God was dying
[1:37:20] out and the people weren't too careful
[1:37:23] about what God thought of them as they
[1:37:26] began to be careful about what the world
[1:37:28] thought of
[1:37:29] them that second generation coming on
[1:37:33] was just like Israel they demanded a
[1:37:36] king to be like the other nations when
[1:37:39] they did that they rejected God but they
[1:37:42] did it anyway remember Samuel he was
[1:37:46] heartbroken because he did everything
[1:37:48] that he could to be in his position and
[1:37:50] God had to tell the prophet hey you know
[1:37:52] what don't worry because they're not
[1:37:54] rejecting you they're rejecting
[1:37:56] me and I can only imagine that broke his
[1:37:58] heart
[1:37:59] more but they did it
[1:38:03] anyway paragraph
[1:38:04] 88 that is the history of the church
[1:38:08] when it thinks more of conforming to the
[1:38:10] world instead of conforming to God it
[1:38:14] isn't long until you see them stop doing
[1:38:16] things they used to
[1:38:19] do and you know he says and start doing
[1:38:22] things they would do initially I just as
[1:38:25] I was reading this I was thinking this
[1:38:27] happens in
[1:38:28] marriage it happens in marriage we get
[1:38:31] so used to being married we can just
[1:38:33] take it for granted the husband's going
[1:38:35] to be there the wife's going to be there
[1:38:37] we're just husband and wife and we've
[1:38:38] got this life now and things are
[1:38:40] different what's different brothers and
[1:38:43] sisters the only way that it's going to
[1:38:45] work that you're going to go forward is
[1:38:46] that you remember your first love that
[1:38:49] you actually keep that romance alive now
[1:38:52] this is sounding crazy crazy for me to
[1:38:54] go here but I just think it's so
[1:38:55] important the natural type's the
[1:38:59] spiritual that's not what I say that's
[1:39:01] what brother brandham
[1:39:03] said but you know we can get comfortable
[1:39:06] in our position and we can just stop
[1:39:07] doing the things that we used to do we
[1:39:09] can stop being kind and loving and
[1:39:12] emotional and supportive and encouraging
[1:39:15] and and we can just allow ourselves to
[1:39:17] express ourselves our real self the self
[1:39:19] that maybe we didn't ever express before
[1:39:22] and start doing things that we wouldn't
[1:39:23] do initially like just have a temper
[1:39:25] tantrum and just blow our tops and and
[1:39:28] it's just
[1:39:29] whatever but you know we can start doing
[1:39:31] things like that in the church too
[1:39:33] brothers and sisters we can just forget
[1:39:35] about our first love we've got a good
[1:39:36] church everything is fine but forget
[1:39:38] about doing the little things that we
[1:39:39] used to do brother Bram talks about
[1:39:41] having all night prayer
[1:39:42] meetings I'm not saying we should or
[1:39:44] shouldn't do that but what I am saying
[1:39:46] is are we forgetting the first love we
[1:39:49] don't want to do that let's not get too
[1:39:51] formal and starchy we know that the
[1:39:53] Antichrist spirit is going to creep into
[1:39:54] the framework of the Christian Church
[1:39:56] causing it to be lukewarm formal and
[1:39:57] Powerless who wants to be lukewarm
[1:39:59] formal and Powerless not one of
[1:40:03] us he goes on to say they change their
[1:40:05] manner of
[1:40:07] dress their attitudes and their
[1:40:11] behavior they get
[1:40:14] lack now I think we could dwell here for
[1:40:17] a little while brothers and sisters they
[1:40:19] change their manner of dress their
[1:40:22] attitudes and and behavior they get
[1:40:26] lack that is what Ephesus means
[1:40:30] relaxed drifting I'll call the musicians
[1:40:34] I don't want to keep us late
[1:40:36] tonight he says that cycle of Revival
[1:40:39] and death has never
[1:40:41] failed all you have to do is recall this
[1:40:45] last move of God in the spirit when men
[1:40:48] and women dressed like
[1:40:50] Christians went to church
[1:40:54] prayed all night took the street corners
[1:40:57] and weren't ashamed of the
[1:40:58] manifestations of the spirit they left
[1:41:01] their old dead
[1:41:03] churches and worshiped in homes or old
[1:41:06] store
[1:41:07] buildings they had
[1:41:11] reality you know maybe stand with me as
[1:41:14] we close here I
[1:41:20] remember once upon a time in my life
[1:41:24] I got
[1:41:26] LAX did you ever get
[1:41:34] LAX I got to the place
[1:41:38] where I got a bad
[1:41:41] attitude my behavior
[1:41:44] changed and I even changed my manner of
