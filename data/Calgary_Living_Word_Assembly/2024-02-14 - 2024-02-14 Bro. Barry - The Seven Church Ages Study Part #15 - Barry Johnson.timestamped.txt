[37:49] testimonies and we want them to have the
[37:52] opportunity thank you musicians if you
[37:54] have your Bibles tonight would just like
[37:57] to read from uh two places in the
[38:00] scripture just a little bit of a
[38:02] different direction for the same thing
[38:05] but uh let's turn to Ecclesiastes
[38:07] chapter
[38:10] 3 Ecclesiastes chapter
[38:13] 3 and then
[38:17] Hebrews the book of
[38:19] [Music]
[38:20] Hebrews
[38:25] 13
[38:29] Ecclesiastes chapter 3
[38:41] verse4 it says I know
[38:44] that whatsoever God
[38:47] doeth it shall be
[38:50] forever nothing can be put to it nor
[38:54] anything taken from it
[38:57] and God doeth it that men should fear
[39:01] before him
[39:03] yes that which hath been done is now and
[39:08] that which is to be hath already been
[39:13] and God
[39:14] requireth that which is passed there's
[39:18] nothing hidden from
[39:21] God Hebrews
[39:25] 138 very familiar scripture I just
[39:27] thought it might be good to turn
[39:30] there just to turn Our Eyes Upon
[39:35] Jesus Hebrews
[39:39] 138 very simple scripture but probably
[39:43] the Keystone of the Bible brother
[39:44] brandham says and we'll get into that
[39:46] tonight Jesus
[39:48] Christ the same yesterday today and
[39:53] forever let's just bow one more time
[39:56] heaven Heavenly Father we're so thankful
[39:58] that you are
[39:59] unchanging Lord Jesus that everything
[40:02] around us will change that heavens and
[40:04] earth will even pass away father but
[40:06] your word and you will not change father
[40:09] you will remain we just want to commit
[40:12] the words that are spoken tonight into
[40:14] your hands father that you would speak
[40:16] the words you AR spoken and that you
[40:18] would stop the words that you don't and
[40:20] that father when we leave here tonight
[40:21] we would say truly we know that we met
[40:24] with you we just ask all these things in
[40:27] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[40:29] bless you tonight you may be
[40:33] seated just a reminder of the uh
[40:36] announcements we have a prayer meeting
[40:37] tomorrow evening at
[40:39] 7:30
[40:42] um we will be traveling this week we
[40:45] leave Friday and then we come back again
[40:46] on
[40:47] Saturday um the following week and uh we
[40:52] have brother John parizot coming down to
[40:55] take the service here in Calgary on
[40:57] Sunday and I think it's just going to be
[40:59] a wonderful opportunity I've had the
[41:01] desire to have some of the brothers from
[41:03] Edmonton to come here for years now and
[41:07] uh I just thought it would be the time
[41:09] so I felt led to do that and uh so we're
[41:12] going to have brother John perzo here
[41:13] I'm really actually kind of disappointed
[41:15] because I wanted to be here for that and
[41:17] I'm sure I could have orchestrated it a
[41:19] little better but we trust the Lord and
[41:21] uh we'll pick up the streaming on our
[41:23] 7-hour journey um on the high way so uh
[41:28] we have brother John parizot coming here
[41:29] this Sunday and uh then we have brother
[41:33] Toby who's going to take the service
[41:35] next
[41:36] Wednesday and then we have the Youth
[41:38] Event coming up on the 25th after
[41:40] service it will be at our house and then
[41:43] on the 29th we have the annual General
[41:45] men's meeting at the church here at 7:30
[41:49] p.m. are you happy tonight amen tonight
[41:53] I want to get into the next portion of
[41:57] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[41:59] and I'm I I just can't help but get more
[42:04] and more excited about this as we get
[42:05] into it it's just seems to do something
[42:08] to me anyway I trust it's the same for
[42:11] you but you know we're going to get into
[42:13] the Ephesian Church age this is where we
[42:15] actually start to get into the church
[42:17] ages but even still even so uh brother
[42:21] Bram he doesn't really get into the
[42:23] Ephesian Church age right away
[42:27] but what he does is an introduction to
[42:29] the church ages and you know even before
[42:32] we do that I I would just like to do
[42:34] something maybe a little unorthodox and
[42:37] go right to the very end of this book
[42:40] before we get into the church ages
[42:42] because I I feel like we could look at
[42:45] this if if someone is listening or
[42:47] someone is streaming and you know they
[42:50] would say Well they're just reading a
[42:51] book that this man uh sent from God or
[42:55] this man they call the prophet or
[42:57] whatever we want to call it um we could
[43:01] say that perhaps we're just listening to
[43:03] what this man has to say and he's got
[43:05] some new doctrine and I just I just love
[43:08] the way he closes this book and I think
[43:11] that many times it's too bad you have to
[43:13] read the whole book before you actually
[43:14] get to this paragraph so I'm probably
[43:17] going to refer to this paragraph a lot
[43:19] as we go through this because I believe
[43:22] it's so important it's important for us
[43:24] to recognize what this man if we say it
[43:27] that way the prophet of God the
[43:28] dispensational prophet is actually
[43:30] saying to this generation and you know
[43:33] paragraph
[43:34] 75 the last page in the book and it's
[43:39] the resume of the ages is is the
[43:43] [Music]
[43:45] chapter he says not for one
[43:48] moment do I bring a message to the
[43:52] people that they may follow me or join
[43:57] my
[43:58] church or start some fellowship and
[44:03] organization I have never done that and
[44:07] will not do that
[44:10] now now which cult leader out there or
[44:13] false prophet would be saying words like
[44:16] this I have no interest in those
[44:20] things but I do have an interest in the
[44:22] things of God and people and if I can
[44:25] accomplish just one thing I will be
[44:29] satisfied that one thing is to see
[44:32] established a true spiritual
[44:35] relationship between God and Men amen
[44:39] wherein men become New Creations in
[44:42] Christ filled with his spirit and live
[44:45] according to his
[44:47] word I would invite plead and warn all
[44:52] to hear his voice at this time and yield
[44:55] your lives completely to him amen even
[44:58] as I trust in my heart that I have given
[45:01] my all to him God bless you and may his
[45:05] coming Rejoice your heart amen
[45:07] hallelujah what a tremendous paragraph I
[45:10] think that is it's so important for us
[45:12] to recognize this was his desire this
[45:14] was what he was doing was encouraging
[45:17] people to
[45:18] Christ so brothers and sisters I I I
[45:21] think I said it before but it was just
[45:22] on my heart and I'm going to say it
[45:24] again we need to make sure all of the
[45:26] things that we call our message beliefs
[45:29] they line up with the message of the
[45:31] hour they line up with what this man
[45:33] said because many times we can have
[45:36] little isms that come around and we
[45:38] begin to practice them and we'll say
[45:40] well it's part of the message well I
[45:42] want to say is it we've got to be able
[45:44] to take it back to the word we got to
[45:47] take it back to the word of God and back
[45:48] to the message of the hour and if we
[45:51] can't take it back there and find it
[45:53] there then I believe the prophet of God
[45:55] said himself just leave it
[45:58] alone but you know what it takes is
[46:00] pride we've got to kill that Pride many
[46:03] times we've got Traditions that are in
[46:06] the way of the word of
[46:09] God we don't want anything to be in the
[46:11] way of the word of God it can't be if we
[46:14] have anything there we talked about a
[46:16] little while ago it's idolatry anything
[46:18] that comes before God whether it's our
[46:20] Traditions whether it's our thinking we
[46:23] can say we've always done it this way
[46:24] and God's given us good results if it's
[46:26] not according to the word of God it
[46:28] doesn't matter if it's given you good
[46:30] results because you're not going to see
[46:32] his
[46:33] coming and that's the objective here
[46:35] isn't it to see his coming it has to be
[46:38] the objective not to be good people not
[46:40] to just live good Christian lives but to
[46:43] actually see the change of our
[46:46] bodies so for anyone who might be
[46:49] concerned that maybe this man that we're
[46:50] talking about this whole book has an
[46:52] objective to get people all brainwashed
[46:55] and and all weird the only thing that
[46:57] these people do that's different is is
[46:59] to Simply follow the word of God now
[47:01] some here in person tonight might be
[47:03] wondering why on Earth am I saying it
[47:05] like this I want to be very clear I I I
[47:07] understand there's some people that I
[47:09] know that are actually looking us up now
[47:12] they're watching it on YouTube I had a
[47:13] conversation this week and it's part of
[47:15] testimonies testimony service is coming
[47:18] up but you know what there's people that
[47:19] are watching this so I'm going to talk
[47:21] about this so they might understand it
[47:23] we need to know that we're not following
[47:25] a man we're following the Lord Jesus
[47:29] Christ but just like anything and just
[47:32] like any church just like any church
[47:35] group that's ever gone around and gotten
[47:38] close to the Lord what's happened is
[47:41] there charlatans there's people that
[47:44] spin off there's people that have
[47:46] ulterior motives we know the word of God
[47:48] says to to beware that that there's
[47:51] ravening wolves have entered into the
[47:53] flock men they come in dressed as sheep
[47:58] right but they're raving wolves on the
[48:00] inside we need to make sure that that's
[48:03] actually not what's going on and there's
[48:04] only one way we can do that and that's
[48:05] by the word of God but if we don't know
[48:07] what the word of God says then how would
[48:08] we ever know if one's right or wrong
[48:11] that's why it's important to read our
[48:13] Bibles tonight we're going to start the
[48:15] Ephesian Church age it's chapter three
[48:18] of the exposition of the seven Church
[48:19] ages and uh I just think it's absolutely
[48:24] beautiful I think though myself I could
[48:26] just continue preaching from the uh you
[48:28] know the first two chapters that we went
[48:30] through here it's just been so good and
[48:32] I know there's so many nuggets in there
[48:33] that really we didn't cover and uh I
[48:36] know I read past you can't really dwell
[48:38] on all of it so long but you know the
[48:40] revelation of Jesus Christ is what it's
[48:42] all about brothers and sisters it is the
[48:45] New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ
[48:47] him making himself known personally to
[48:49] the individual and then the patmas
[48:51] vision and all of the different things
[48:53] getting in the spirit recognizing that
[48:55] you know we we we can't just be
[48:57] Christian people and not act like human
[49:00] beings because human beings get right
[49:02] into the spirit of things amen
[49:04] hallelujah that's what they do but uh
[49:06] anyways we're carrying on with the
[49:08] Ephesian Church age tonight is chapter
[49:10] three and an introduction to the church
[49:12] ages brother brandom takes the time to
[49:14] just introduce that the church ages is
[49:17] something that's actually coming to pass
[49:19] that there is an actual description of
[49:22] the seven Church ages and here we have
[49:24] the introduction to the church ages
[49:26] before he actually officially gets into
[49:28] the Ephesian Church age paragraph one of
[49:30] this chapter it says in order for you to
[49:31] fully understand the message of the
[49:33] church ages I would like to explain the
[49:35] various principles that allowed me to
[49:38] arrive at the names of The Messengers
[49:41] the length of the ages and the other
[49:44] factors involved therein now I'm just
[49:47] going to jump out of there for a second
[49:49] I just want to make a note of this right
[49:51] at the beginning of this book I'm not
[49:53] sure if the blue one has this does
[49:54] anybody know if the blue one has this
[49:56] right at the beginning it shows The
[49:57] Messengers and it actually shows the
[49:59] duration of the age these books here
[50:02] they have it the Ephesian Church age was
[50:05] the Apostle Paul this is the conclusion
[50:08] that he came to he's got a key to it and
[50:10] we'll explain that as we go but I just
[50:12] want to just want to lay this out here I
[50:14] thought it would be really good to talk
[50:15] about the Ephesian Church age was from
[50:18] 53 ad to 170 ad and it was the Apostle
[50:23] Paul the saman church age
[50:25] was from ad. 170 to 312 ad and that
[50:31] messenger one of the these are the seven
[50:34] stars that were in his right hand first
[50:36] was the Apostle Paul second was irus of
[50:40] Gul then there was the perian church age
[50:42] 312 to 606 Martin of
[50:46] Tours the thyrian age is 606 to
[50:51] 1512 Columba of Ireland the sardian
[50:56] church age 1512 to 1750 Martin Luther
[51:02] the Philadelphian Church age 1750 to
[51:06] 1906 John
[51:08] Wesley then the leoan church age from
[51:12] 1906
[51:13] to who knows some people have some
[51:17] scenarios and I I i' I've I've been
[51:19] intrigued to hear it because we know
[51:21] that some people have taken what was
[51:23] spoken by this man and said it was
[51:26] 1977 other people would say it's till
[51:28] 1963 when the seals were open other
[51:31] people would come up with their own
[51:33] theories and say different things but
[51:35] you know I would say God's still calling
[51:37] we know that there's a blending of the
[51:39] ages they always blend there's not a
[51:41] hard start and stop there's always a
[51:43] blending we know that these men crossed
[51:45] over there was one man alive while the
[51:47] other one was still in his position in
[51:49] his office it wasn't as though God just
[51:51] left the church vacant and void but who
[51:54] knows um I think it's beautiful if you
[51:56] listen to what brother Bram says he
[51:58] never says that I'm the messenger I've
[52:02] come to bring the message to you it's
[52:05] not the way it works but we know in this
[52:06] book it says the leoan church age from
[52:08] 1906 until is William Bram and he lived
[52:12] from 1909 to
[52:14] 1965 and and could it be that the church
[52:17] age ended there I don't know while he
[52:20] was still here we know very well you've
[52:22] heard me harp on it quite a bit that
[52:24] we're living in the bride age is what he
[52:25] said very clearly it it has actually
[52:28] shifted into the bride age and we know
[52:30] that the great revivals are
[52:33] over they rejected God they choose to
[52:36] reject chose to re reject God in in 1956
[52:40] 57 58 they took God out of America and
[52:44] what happened all the Devils they could
[52:47] just creep in because they took God out
[52:48] they kicked God out and what they did
[52:50] was actually paved the way rolled out
[52:52] the red carpet and said welcome Satan
[52:54] you can just take over over now and we
[52:56] know that uh we have spiritual
[52:58] wickedness at the highest places in the
[53:00] US in Canada everywhere you go in the
[53:02] world we know that uh all civilization
[53:04] is of the devil because this is not the
[53:06] way God created mankind to
[53:10] live in order for you to fully
[53:13] understand the message of the church
[53:14] ages I would like to explain the various
[53:16] principles that allowed me to arrive at
[53:18] the names of The Messengers the length
[53:20] of the ages and other factors involved
[53:23] therein since the study was to be the
[53:26] most serious one I had ever undertaken
[53:28] up to this time I sought God for many
[53:31] days for the inspiration of the Holy
[53:36] Spirit then only did I read the
[53:39] scriptures on the church ages and delve
[53:41] into the many Church histories written
[53:44] by the most unbiased historians that I
[53:46] could
[53:47] find God did not fail to answer my
[53:49] prayer for while I read the word and the
[53:53] histories I was enabled by by the Holy
[53:55] Spirit to see unfolded a pattern that
[53:58] runs through the centuries and right
[54:00] into this present last
[54:04] day as I read that I know I can feel
[54:08] skepticism in my own mind naturally
[54:10] speaking and I'm not saying that I I
[54:13] don't believe this but just thinking
[54:15] about this if I was to look at it
[54:16] objectively from someone who maybe has
[54:18] never heard about the message of the
[54:19] hour to hear a man talk like that is
[54:22] pretty out there isn't it it can be a
[54:24] little bit much to think that you know
[54:27] man has a direct relationship with God
[54:29] but you know what that's the intent is
[54:31] that man would have that relationship
[54:33] with God and not just a man that would
[54:34] be potentially a prophet or maybe a
[54:37] pastor or an evangelist so that every
[54:39] single man could have that relationship
[54:41] with God because that's where we're
[54:43] going but here he has the uh you know
[54:46] sort of the the the the brass tax of it
[54:50] paragraph three the key given me of the
[54:53] Lord whereby I was able to determine the
[54:55] messenger for each age is a most
[54:58] scriptural one isn't that beautiful he's
[55:01] not saying I've got my own version I've
[55:03] got my own idea first it's the
[55:05] leadership of the Holy Ghost and then
[55:07] it's going to actually go right back to
[55:09] the word it's not just someone's ideas
[55:12] that's coming from some alien Source
[55:15] somewhere out there some some place
[55:18] somewhere this is actually exactly what
[55:21] we read earlier in in the scripture
[55:23] right it's got to be a revelation
[55:25] revealed by the spirit but then
[55:26] confirmed by the word but then what
[55:29] happens it's got to be manifest it has
[55:31] to have results that are born in in its
[55:34] life so he says the key given me of the
[55:37] Lord whereby I was able to determine the
[55:39] messenger for each age is a most
[55:41] scriptural one in fact it might be
[55:43] called the Keystone of the Bible I have
[55:46] that highlighted here the Keystone of
[55:48] the Bible it is the Revelation that God
[55:52] never changes and that his ways are as
[55:55] unchangeable as he
[55:57] is and we know the Antichrist Spirit has
[56:01] crept into the framework of the
[56:02] Christian church and caused it to become
[56:04] lukewarm formal and Powerless and we
[56:07] know the leoan church age why is that
[56:09] because theed leoan church is Rich it's
[56:13] increased with goods and it has need of
[56:14] nothing don't need God we can look after
[56:17] ourselves we're educated people we're
[56:20] smart we've got everything going for us
[56:22] we're the masters of our destiny that's
[56:24] this age that we live in and if we're
[56:26] not careful even Believers of this
[56:28] message we can get caught up in that
[56:31] Doctrine the only way we won't is by his
[56:34] Spirit brothers and sisters by having
[56:35] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives if we resist
[56:38] getting the Holy Ghost in our lives that
[56:40] world Doctrine will just take us over
[56:42] there's no way that we can prevent it
[56:44] the Keystone of the Bible is that the
[56:46] revelation of God never changes and his
[56:48] ways are as unchangeable as he is and
[56:52] this takes us to our scripture reading
[56:53] tonight out of Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ
[56:57] the same yesterday today and forever and
[57:00] we know the prophet of God what he
[57:02] taught so many times was people go and
[57:05] put them out there somewhere out in the
[57:06] future they'll look back and see what he
[57:08] did in the lives of the others and
[57:10] ignore what he's doing right now and
[57:12] what's he doing right now he's on the
[57:14] outside of the door knocking to get in
[57:17] and all we've got to do is open the door
[57:18] and let them
[57:20] in you know I was having a conversation
[57:22] with someone this week part of
[57:23] testimonies but how there's doors
[57:27] there's doors and and unless we're
[57:28] willing to open all the doors for him
[57:31] he's still going to be knocking we could
[57:33] open the front door of our house and say
[57:35] come on in come on in no problem but
[57:38] he's going to knock on every single door
[57:40] in that house and see if we'll open it
[57:43] for him or see if there's something
[57:44] we're hiding see if there's something
[57:46] we're just not willing to deal with see
[57:47] if there's something we're not willing
[57:49] to give over to him because he wants it
[57:51] all he's not going to actually just
[57:53] settle for standing in the foyer of our
[57:56] house the next part of this is is the
[57:59] other scripture that we read out of
[58:00] Ecclesiastes I know that whatsoever God
[58:03] doeth it shall be forever nothing can be
[58:06] put to it nor anything taken from it and
[58:08] God doeth it that men should fear before
[58:11] him remember he's the same
[58:15] yesterday tonight and
[58:18] forever that which hath been is now and
[58:21] that which is to be hath already being
[58:25] and God requireth that which is PED it's
[58:29] just amazing it just makes our brains
[58:32] makes my brain uh stutter when I think
[58:35] about it because there's no past and
[58:38] there's no future it's only present with
[58:40] God isn't it all of it it's just present
[58:43] he's already been in our future and he's
[58:45] already been in our past but right now
[58:48] he is right here and he's just wondering
[58:50] what we're going to do with the word
[58:51] that we get
[58:52] tonight you know the next paragra 4 it
[58:55] says here it is an unchanging God with
[58:58] unchanging ways when you think about
[59:01] that imagine if we had to deal with a
[59:04] changing god with changing
[59:07] ways if we had to deal with a changing
[59:10] husband with changing ways and and and
[59:13] you know what that's the Paradox as
[59:15] people young people don't realize this I
[59:18] know I never did the the girl that I
[59:20] married the bride that I married I
[59:21] didn't realize that she was going to
[59:23] change had an idea that she would be the
[59:26] same forever and I was in love and I
[59:30] still am happy Valentine's Day
[59:34] darling but you know unless we realize
[59:37] as human beings everything that we know
[59:40] on Earth is going to change the people
[59:43] that we know are going to change the
[59:45] people that know us need to recognize
[59:47] that we're going to change but we have a
[59:50] God we have a god that is unchanging in
[59:53] his ways and his his nature brothers and
[59:55] sisters his word is his absolute and he
[59:58] cannot change one ioda from his word
[1:00:02] it's so beautiful an unchanging God with
[1:00:04] unchanging ways what he did at the first
[1:00:06] he will have to keep on doing until it
[1:00:09] is done for the last time there will
[1:00:11] never be a
[1:00:14] change apply that to the church ages the
[1:00:18] kind of man that God chose for the first
[1:00:20] age and how God manifested in that man's
[1:00:23] Ministry would be the example for all
[1:00:26] the other ages what God did in the first
[1:00:28] church age is what he wants to do in all
[1:00:31] of the other Church ages and we know
[1:00:33] that Paul is the first church age
[1:00:35] messenger we'll get into it a little bit
[1:00:36] I always Jump Ahead a bit but we know
[1:00:38] that Paul was the first church age
[1:00:40] messenger chosen by God and we know that
[1:00:43] he was chosen to go to the Gentiles
[1:00:45] because the Jews wouldn't receive him
[1:00:47] and we know that the church ages are all
[1:00:51] about the Gentiles they're not about the
[1:00:54] Jews the seven Church age Messengers are
[1:00:57] all to the all the Gentile Ministry
[1:01:00] we'll get into
[1:01:02] that that's what he wants to do in all
[1:01:04] their ages paragraph five now we know
[1:01:06] exactly from the word which was recorded
[1:01:09] by the Holy Spirit how the first or
[1:01:12] original church was founded and how God
[1:01:14] manifested
[1:01:16] himself in her not to her in her the
[1:01:22] word can't change or be changed
[1:01:25] because it's the word of God John 1:1 in
[1:01:28] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:01:30] was with God and the Word was
[1:01:35] God to change one word of it as did Eve
[1:01:39] brings sin and death even as it says in
[1:01:42] Revelations 22:18 to19 If any man shall
[1:01:47] add unto these things God shall add unto
[1:01:49] him the plagues that are written in this
[1:01:51] book and if any man shall take away from
[1:01:54] the word words of this book of this
[1:01:55] prophecy God shall take away his part
[1:01:58] out of the book of life and out of the
[1:02:00] holy city and from the things which are
[1:02:03] written in this
[1:02:06] book we don't want to do that we don't
[1:02:08] want to add to it or take away from it
[1:02:10] and that's what I'm saying brothers and
[1:02:11] sisters when we when we when we examine
[1:02:13] Our Lives we need to know that the life
[1:02:16] that we're living isn't adding to the
[1:02:18] message of the hour it's not adding to
[1:02:19] the word of God and we need to know that
[1:02:22] the way we're living the Traditions that
[1:02:24] we have in our lives they're not taken
[1:02:25] away from the message of the hour or
[1:02:27] taken away from the word of God because
[1:02:29] if they are then this scripture applies
[1:02:31] and our position is going to be sitting
[1:02:33] in the throne with him judging Angels
[1:02:36] it's not going to be standing before
[1:02:38] that Throne that's not our
[1:02:42] calling paragraph s thus what the church
[1:02:45] was at Pentecost is the
[1:02:48] standard going back to what we talked
[1:02:50] about you know what those people did
[1:02:52] they got in the spirit didn't they they
[1:02:54] didn't sit around like dried up old
[1:02:56] sticks is what brother brandham said
[1:02:57] they got right into the feel of things
[1:03:00] and if there's ever a place brothers and
[1:03:02] sisters that we have the ability we
[1:03:04] should have the Liberty to it's right
[1:03:06] here this is it in the house of the Lord
[1:03:08] he's provided this building he's
[1:03:10] provided the heat that's in here he's
[1:03:11] provided the light that's in here for
[1:03:13] one purpose and that's to worship
[1:03:19] Him thus what the church was at
[1:03:21] Pentecost is the standard that is the
[1:03:24] pattern there's no other pattern no
[1:03:27] matter what the scholars say I love that
[1:03:29] no matter what the scholars say God has
[1:03:32] not changed that pattern what God did at
[1:03:35] Pentecost he has to keep on doing until
[1:03:38] the church ages
[1:03:39] close though Scholars may tell you the
[1:03:43] apostolic age is over don't you believe
[1:03:45] it such a statement is wrong on two
[1:03:48] counts first of all it is wrong to
[1:03:51] Suppose there aren't any more apostles
[1:03:54] just because the original 12 are dead an
[1:03:57] apostle means a scent one and there are
[1:04:00] many scent ones today but they are
[1:04:03] called
[1:04:04] missionaries as long as men are being
[1:04:06] called and sent forth with the word of
[1:04:09] Life they is an Apostolic age going
[1:04:12] on doesn't he make it so clear so easy
[1:04:15] to understand it doesn't have to be
[1:04:18] shrouded in mystery a and dark and and
[1:04:21] and mysterious it's so clear secondly
[1:04:24] they refer to an age of manifested holy
[1:04:28] ghost power as being over since the
[1:04:30] Bible has been
[1:04:32] completed that is
[1:04:34] untrue there is not even one scripture
[1:04:36] that suggests that but many conclusively
[1:04:40] state otherwise here is our proof that
[1:04:43] both of these charges are false acts 238
[1:04:47] and 39 then Peter said unto them repent
[1:04:49] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:04:51] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:04:53] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:04:56] of the Holy Ghost for the promise is
[1:04:58] unto you and to your children and to all
[1:05:01] that are AAR off even as many as the
[1:05:04] Lord Our God shall
[1:05:06] call the promise of
[1:05:08] Power with which the apostles were
[1:05:11] endued at Pentecost is to you Jews and
[1:05:15] to your children Jews and to all that
[1:05:19] are AAR off Gentiles and to as many as
[1:05:23] the Lord our God God shall call both Jew
[1:05:25] and
[1:05:26] Gentile until he stops calling the
[1:05:30] Pentecostal message and power will not
[1:05:37] cease you know brothers and sisters one
[1:05:39] of these days he's going to stop
[1:05:41] calling the word of God says that his
[1:05:43] Spirit won't always strive with
[1:05:46] man there comes a point in time where we
[1:05:48] have to make a
[1:05:50] decision we've got to get our lives in
[1:05:53] order we have to go according to the
[1:05:55] word of God and follow him to the letter
[1:05:58] and you know there comes a time where if
[1:06:00] we choose not to we could actually go
[1:06:03] beyond the day of our Grace and we know
[1:06:06] it we know it God will make it very
[1:06:09] clear to
[1:06:10] us but we heard it said many times and I
[1:06:12] just want to maybe just remind us of
[1:06:15] this because it's it's vital this isn't
[1:06:17] a time to play Church Brothers and
[1:06:19] Sisters this is the time to get ready
[1:06:21] because we're on the Launchpad and the
[1:06:23] as asona ages here the bride AG is here
[1:06:25] the countdown has been on for over 60
[1:06:28] years and now any moment this rocket
[1:06:31] could take off could lift off but you
[1:06:35] know people had that lived as slaves in
[1:06:38] in in the days of the children of Israel
[1:06:40] we've all heard this many times I'm sure
[1:06:43] but there were slaves in those days but
[1:06:44] there was a 50th Year of Jubilee and
[1:06:47] when that Year of Jubilee came around we
[1:06:49] know the law of the land according to
[1:06:51] God was that when that trumpet blew all
[1:06:53] the people who were slaves they could
[1:06:55] actually throw down their shovels throw
[1:06:57] down their rakes they could say goodbye
[1:07:00] to those slave masters those taskmasters
[1:07:03] every debt that was owed was was renewed
[1:07:06] it was forgiven at that sounding of the
[1:07:08] Jubilee trumpet but we know those people
[1:07:11] that decided to go free they were free
[1:07:12] indeed they could go back to their
[1:07:13] possession they could go back to their
[1:07:15] inheritance they could go back to
[1:07:16] everything that had been lost for that
[1:07:18] 50 years or however many years they were
[1:07:20] in bondage to pay the debt but there
[1:07:22] were some people that just didn't want
[1:07:24] to go they were comfortable in their
[1:07:25] position they wanted to stay with that
[1:07:28] slave master they wanted to raise their
[1:07:30] families under the task Master's whip
[1:07:34] they wanted to be bound to that slave
[1:07:37] master and what happened was they were
[1:07:39] taken and taken down to the temple not
[1:07:42] taken to a a a a a slavery taskmasters
[1:07:46] uh joint
[1:07:47] Association conference they were taken
[1:07:50] to the temple for a reason so that they
[1:07:52] could be bored in the ear they could
[1:07:55] have a an all put through their ear to
[1:07:57] show they have a hole in their ear they
[1:07:59] are now permanently a slave and they
[1:08:02] will never be able to be free again even
[1:08:04] if they live for another 50 years and
[1:08:06] another Jubilee trumpet blows they will
[1:08:09] still remain a slave for the rest of
[1:08:11] their days because that that that all
[1:08:13] has gone through their ear and you know
[1:08:14] brother bradam talks about that he says
[1:08:17] that spiritually speaking we will have
[1:08:19] the opportunity to hear the gospel for
[1:08:21] the last time and if we choose to reject
[1:08:25] to resist the Holy Ghost calling Upon
[1:08:27] Our Hearts then we will be spiritually
[1:08:30] bored in our ears and we will no longer
[1:08:32] be able to hear the Jubilee trumpet and
[1:08:35] go free we will be bound and you know
[1:08:39] what happens at that point the voice of
[1:08:41] God that we once heard in our lives
[1:08:44] slowly goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer
[1:08:47] and there's no restraints on a human
[1:08:49] being at that point and outside of the
[1:08:51] Holy Ghost a human being is a brute
[1:08:53] Beast and this world is set up brothers
[1:08:55] and sisters in as a vacuum as a
[1:08:58] spiritual vacuum if we don't have the
[1:09:00] Seal of God on our our bodies then that
[1:09:04] vacuum will just cause us to explode
[1:09:06] we'll just be completely exed uh
[1:09:09] consumed by all of the spirits in this
[1:09:11] world there's no way that we would be
[1:09:13] able to resist it outside of the baptism
[1:09:15] of the Holy Ghost that's why the world
[1:09:18] is so crazy now that's why we're seeing
[1:09:20] so many different manifestations of the
[1:09:23] devil and and you know what I mean when
[1:09:25] we talk about it there's so many people
[1:09:28] acting in so many different
[1:09:30] ways when did it become normal to teach
[1:09:33] children that they could be a boy when
[1:09:35] they're a girl or for a girl that she
[1:09:37] could become a boy if she's a girl what
[1:09:40] on Earth is going
[1:09:42] on you
[1:09:45] know you have the idea to think that
[1:09:48] people fought and died they laid their
[1:09:52] lives down so that we could have have
[1:09:54] freedom of choice in this country on how
[1:09:57] we want to worship and what we want to
[1:09:59] do they did not fight so that we could
[1:10:02] choose to change our
[1:10:04] genders I don't care if someone's
[1:10:06] listening to me say that because they
[1:10:08] need to hear it that is contrary to the
[1:10:11] word of God and this country was founded
[1:10:14] upon that and so was the United States
[1:10:16] of
[1:10:17] America but they've chosen to reject it
[1:10:20] so God said okay have it have it your
[1:10:24] way and what happened at that point was
[1:10:27] the lid of hell was pulled off and now
[1:10:29] you can see all the seeds that were swn
[1:10:32] way back way back now all those seeds
[1:10:35] are actually starting to grow and people
[1:10:37] are are going oh my goodness look at
[1:10:39] this world we're living in what's going
[1:10:42] on it's because they rejected
[1:10:45] God so now those seeds are going to come
[1:10:48] to fruition they're growing up and
[1:10:50] they're going to manifest and there
[1:10:52] ain't no stopping it but you know what
[1:10:55] even better than that there ain't no
[1:10:56] stopp in Sons and Daughters of God
[1:10:58] because all creation is groaning for the
[1:11:01] manifestation of the sons of God and
[1:11:03] when that happens we're out of
[1:11:07] here an unchanging God with unchanging
[1:11:10] ways that's who we serve my goodness the
[1:11:14] promise of Power with which the apostles
[1:11:16] were endued at Pentecost is to you Jews
[1:11:19] and to your children Jews and to all
[1:11:22] that are a far off Gentile
[1:11:24] and to as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:11:26] call both Jew and Gentile until he stops
[1:11:29] calling the Pentecostal message and
[1:11:32] power will not cease what the church had
[1:11:35] at Pentecost is her inalienable right
[1:11:40] that means nobody can take it from us
[1:11:42] nobody can say that that it's we're
[1:11:44] aliens from that right no that's our
[1:11:47] inalienable right that's who we are that
[1:11:50] that power they had at Pentecost
[1:11:52] brothers and sisters originally she had
[1:11:55] the pure word of God and isn't it
[1:11:57] interesting because that's what this
[1:11:59] Elijah Ministry has done was restored
[1:12:02] the faith of the children back to the
[1:12:04] faith of the Pentecostal fathers right
[1:12:06] back to the pure word for our day
[1:12:09] original she had the pure word of God
[1:12:11] she had the power of the spirit
[1:12:14] manifested in diverse signs wonders and
[1:12:17] Gifts of the Holy Ghost and you know the
[1:12:19] devil is right here right now saying
[1:12:21] where's all those gifts and where's all
[1:12:23] the man estation and I want to say take
[1:12:25] a look right here take a look right here
[1:12:27] take a look at all the people that
[1:12:28] aren't here who have had that
[1:12:30] manifestation in their lives because the
[1:12:32] Lord is moving in his bride and there's
[1:12:35] some people that are going to say where
[1:12:36] are all the signs where are all the
[1:12:38] gifts and I want to say to those people
[1:12:40] get to the Altar and get right with God
[1:12:42] and you too will see those signs and
[1:12:44] wonders in your
[1:12:46] life he's not going to come down and
[1:12:48] just take us and say it's time to to to
[1:12:51] see the signs and wonders in our lives
[1:12:53] people have to sell out to
[1:12:56] him got to recognize that we're his
[1:12:58] inheritance we are his inheritance we
[1:13:01] have an inheritance that's in heaven
[1:13:04] reserved for us that's undefiled that
[1:13:06] nobody can touch and it's going to be
[1:13:08] there waiting for us but brothers and
[1:13:09] sisters he has an inheritance also and
[1:13:12] that is the lives of his sons and
[1:13:14] daughters of God that he came and died
[1:13:17] for and paid the price in Blood and
[1:13:20] wrote
[1:13:22] pardon every single one of us Hebrews 2
[1:13:26] 1:4 therefore we ought to give the more
[1:13:29] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:13:32] heard lest at any time we should let
[1:13:35] them
[1:13:36] slip you know if you don't use it you
[1:13:40] lose
[1:13:41] it and I know I'm not an a a musician
[1:13:45] but I I know that that can be the case a
[1:13:48] and like riding a bike if you don't ride
[1:13:50] a bike you'll become unsteady on that if
[1:13:53] you speak a different language and you
[1:13:55] don't practice it you'll actually get a
[1:13:58] little bit Rusty won't you and if you
[1:14:00] serve God but you don't actually serve
[1:14:04] him all the time what's going to
[1:14:06] happen the channel is going to get
[1:14:09] clogged up the pipe's going to get
[1:14:10] clogged up the lamp that was once
[1:14:12] burning bright and clear is going to
[1:14:13] start to actually get so and and all
[1:14:16] that soot will actually start to build
[1:14:17] up on the inside of the glass and even
[1:14:20] though there's a light burning inside
[1:14:21] there it won't be very bright at all but
[1:14:24] we have the opportunity to trim our
[1:14:26] lamps brothers and
[1:14:29] sisters therefore we ought to give the
[1:14:31] more Earnest heed to the things which we
[1:14:33] have heard lest at any time we should
[1:14:36] let them slip for if the word spoken by
[1:14:39] Angels was steadfast and every
[1:14:41] transgression and Disobedience to the
[1:14:45] word received a just recompense of
[1:14:47] reward how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:14:50] so great salvation which at the first
[1:14:53] began to be spoken by the Lord and was
[1:14:55] confirmed unto us by them that heard him
[1:14:58] God also bearing them witness both with
[1:15:01] signs and wonders and with diverse
[1:15:03] Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:07] according to his own
[1:15:09] will brother Bram goes on to say that
[1:15:11] original church was not organized by men
[1:15:15] it was led by the Holy
[1:15:17] Ghost and that's one of the things
[1:15:19] brothers and sisters we've got to be
[1:15:21] very careful about when it comes to you
[1:15:24] know you hear me harping about
[1:15:25] Traditions all the time we need to be
[1:15:27] very careful that we don't try and get
[1:15:29] too organized and and become businessmen
[1:15:32] with the church because as soon as we
[1:15:34] start doing that what happens is we take
[1:15:37] the place of the Holy Ghost we need to
[1:15:39] make sure that we are sovereignly led by
[1:15:41] the holy
[1:15:43] spirit because that original church was
[1:15:46] not organized by men it was led by the
[1:15:48] Holy Ghost and I want to say if we have
[1:15:51] a pattern to follow this is it
[1:15:54] he says it wasn't very big it was hated
[1:15:56] and despised it was oppressed it was
[1:15:58] persecuted unto death but it was true to
[1:16:01] God it stayed with the original word
[1:16:05] pattern now don't get LED astray here
[1:16:07] when I said that God and his ways never
[1:16:11] change I did not say the church and its
[1:16:14] Messengers could not change the church
[1:16:16] isn't
[1:16:18] God so she can
[1:16:20] change but what I said
[1:16:23] but what I said was that because of the
[1:16:26] unchanging God with unchanging ways we
[1:16:30] can go back to the beginning and see the
[1:16:32] first and perfect ACT of God and then
[1:16:35] judge by that standard that's how it's
[1:16:40] done the true church will always try to
[1:16:44] be like the original at
[1:16:46] Pentecost now I just want to clarify
[1:16:49] this we're not going to try and speak in
[1:16:53] tongues we're not going to try and
[1:16:56] manifest the gifts of the Spirit we're
[1:16:58] just going to try and live good
[1:17:00] Christian lives we're just going to try
[1:17:02] and follow the word of God a and as we
[1:17:05] try and do that and put Christ first in
[1:17:07] our lives in our homes in our our minds
[1:17:10] in our existence in our beings as we do
[1:17:12] that then you know what happens is we
[1:17:15] just live like the first church that's
[1:17:17] just the way it works it it's not us
[1:17:20] actually trying to do anything it's just
[1:17:23] doing what the word of God said to do
[1:17:26] the true church will always try to be
[1:17:28] like the original at Pentecost the true
[1:17:31] church of today will try to approximate
[1:17:34] that early first one and The Messengers
[1:17:37] to the churches having the same spirit
[1:17:39] of God in them will try to approximate
[1:17:43] the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly
[1:17:46] like him but the true Messengers will be
[1:17:50] the ones that come the closest to Paul
[1:17:53] who was free of all men sold out to God
[1:17:56] and gave forth the word of God only and
[1:18:00] manifested the Holy Ghost in power none
[1:18:04] else would
[1:18:05] do you have to work from the original as
[1:18:09] like begats like the true church will
[1:18:12] always be the one that tries to follow
[1:18:14] in the steps of her Founders at
[1:18:17] Pentecost and her Messengers will follow
[1:18:20] the Apostle Paul the first messenger to
[1:18:23] the first age it is that simple and that
[1:18:28] wonderful he says with this key so
[1:18:31] simple yet so wonderful I was able by
[1:18:35] the help of the Holy Spirit to read the
[1:18:37] book of Revelation and the histories and
[1:18:40] find there in each age each each
[1:18:43] messenger the duration of each age and
[1:18:47] the part each played in the purpose of
[1:18:49] God from Pentecost to the consummation
[1:18:52] of of those
[1:18:54] ages since you now understand how we
[1:18:57] judge what the true church was like what
[1:19:00] she was at Pentecost and what she was in
[1:19:04] the apostolic age as set forth in the
[1:19:07] word in the book of Acts we can now
[1:19:11] apply the same rule to show how the
[1:19:15] church
[1:19:19] failed I know that's kind of a tough one
[1:19:23] because where did the church fail Church
[1:19:25] didn't really fail did it well as soon
[1:19:27] as they started to actually organize and
[1:19:30] say now we've got the Holy Ghost we need
[1:19:32] to quickly get behind it and create a
[1:19:35] book of Creeds and and and and and and
[1:19:38] what happened was the Holy Ghost just
[1:19:39] moved on from that church and that's
[1:19:41] where the church failed and that's what
[1:19:42] brother bram's talking about here he
[1:19:44] said the basic error or errors that
[1:19:46] crept into the first church and were
[1:19:48] revealed in the book of Acts and in
[1:19:50] Revelation and also in the Epistles will
[1:19:53] become more and more visibly manifested
[1:19:56] in each subsequent age until we come to
[1:19:59] a complete blackout of Truth in the last
[1:20:02] or Leo Dean age now as I was reading
[1:20:06] this I thought you know I've I've read
[1:20:07] it and I've seen it and and we know it
[1:20:10] we we know there was a time where
[1:20:11] brother Bram was preaching this and and
[1:20:13] he had a a board a Blackboard in the
[1:20:16] Tabernacle I believe and and what did he
[1:20:18] do he drew this out on this Blackboard
[1:20:21] and we know that when he drew it out
[1:20:24] there was I think another time it was
[1:20:25] another service that the Holy Ghost came
[1:20:28] and and this is where people might say
[1:20:30] wow this is getting out there but there
[1:20:31] was a hand that wrote it on the back of
[1:20:33] the Tabernacle wall exactly like he
[1:20:36] wrote it out on the Blackboard
[1:20:38] confirming that that is exactly what
[1:20:42] happened what my point is with this here
[1:20:46] is to think that we're talking about the
[1:20:49] the the the complete blackout of Truth
[1:20:52] truth in the last or leoan age if that's
[1:20:56] what's happened and we know it is how
[1:20:59] are we able to know the the word how are
[1:21:01] we able to know the truth I just was
[1:21:03] having a little Jubilee at home today
[1:21:05] when I was studying this thinking about
[1:21:07] it how in the leoan church how can the
[1:21:09] leoan church be able to receive the
[1:21:12] truth when there's a complete
[1:21:14] blackout only God brothers and sisters
[1:21:17] only Grace there's no thing that we
[1:21:20] could ever do or say we've done to be
[1:21:23] able to receive the word of God if we're
[1:21:25] able to receive this word it's all his
[1:21:27] grace to
[1:21:29] us and we have the ability to
[1:21:34] rejoice and I just can't help but think
[1:21:36] when we truly catch that Revelation that
[1:21:38] we're redeemed only because he chose us
[1:21:40] not because we we went and cashed in a
[1:21:42] token and now I'd like to be redeemed
[1:21:45] please I want to say this if that's the
[1:21:47] case where'd you get the token who gave
[1:21:50] you that token because you didn't
[1:21:52] produce it
[1:21:53] you didn't make it you didn't buy it
[1:21:55] nobody in Earth gave it to you your
[1:21:58] parents can't give it to you the only
[1:22:00] person is Jesus Christ the same
[1:22:02] yesterday today and forever and the only
[1:22:04] way we could ever get that token is
[1:22:06] because he gave it to us before the
[1:22:07] foundation of the world so when we catch
[1:22:10] that Revelation brothers and sisters
[1:22:11] there should be no restraints to worship
[1:22:14] I'm not saying that you should do
[1:22:15] anything but alls I'm saying is the more
[1:22:17] I actually catch this Revelation the
[1:22:19] more it makes me want to shout
[1:22:23] hallelujah thank you Jesus Oh My to
[1:22:27] think that he actually did this for me I
[1:22:29] have the ability to see in the midst of
[1:22:32] Leo to seea and
[1:22:33] darkness
[1:22:35] what it just makes it clearer and
[1:22:37] clearer when we get over there and say
[1:22:39] you know how did you make it through
[1:22:41] being eaten by lions they're going to
[1:22:43] say how did you make it through not
[1:22:44] getting consumed by all the
[1:22:48] Devils now out of this first key that we
[1:22:51] have received of the Lord there comes
[1:22:54] another and slightly less wonderful
[1:22:57] truth I said that the true church would
[1:23:00] always try to be like it was in the book
[1:23:02] of Acts that's exactly right but we have
[1:23:06] discovered that the word also teaches an
[1:23:09] invasion of error until there is a
[1:23:12] complete blackout of Truth in the last
[1:23:14] day when the Lord is about to appear
[1:23:18] brothers and sisters I don't know if
[1:23:20] it's ever been
[1:23:21] darker
[1:23:23] the question now arises in our minds
[1:23:26] does God forsake his own and let them
[1:23:28] fall into a state of complete
[1:23:30] deception on no account for the
[1:23:34] scripture says very clearly the elect
[1:23:37] cannot be
[1:23:39] deceived but you know brothers and
[1:23:41] sisters we know the word of God also
[1:23:43] says that it would be so
[1:23:45] close that it would deceive the very
[1:23:48] elected and that means that it's not out
[1:23:50] there somewhere we said this and we'll
[1:23:52] just keep saying it it's right here
[1:23:54] unfortunately it's right here the two
[1:23:55] Vines are intertwined and I'm not saying
[1:23:57] in this building I'm saying in and
[1:23:59] around the message of the hour brothers
[1:24:00] and sisters there's false Doctrine and
[1:24:03] if we're not careful we can be consumed
[1:24:05] by it because you know it's not a great
[1:24:07] screaming shouting salivating smoking
[1:24:10] fire breathing monster that we need to
[1:24:13] be afraid of we need to be afraid of 99%
[1:24:16] truth and 1% error brothers and sisters
[1:24:19] one word off is Satan's kingdom and
[1:24:21] that's what caused all mankind to fall
[1:24:24] into death isn't it Eve taking one word
[1:24:28] thou
[1:24:29] shalt not surely die but God told her
[1:24:33] husband you will surely die the day you
[1:24:35] eat
[1:24:38] thereof
[1:24:40] my the elect cannot be deceived Matthew
[1:24:43] 24:24 for there shall arise false
[1:24:45] christs and false prophets and shall
[1:24:47] show great signs and wonders in so much
[1:24:50] that if it were possible ible they shall
[1:24:54] deceive the very elect and we know what
[1:24:57] is the key how can we know what's right
[1:25:00] and wrong how can we discern what's
[1:25:02] right and wrong the only way we're going
[1:25:03] to be able to discern what's right and
[1:25:04] wrong is to have the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:25:06] Lives brothers and sisters that's the
[1:25:07] only way it's the only way we can study
[1:25:10] our way into the word of God but he's
[1:25:12] going to hide himself in Simplicity and
[1:25:15] he's going to reveal himself in the same
[1:25:17] he's not going to be as mankind thinks
[1:25:20] that he's going to be he's God he can do
[1:25:23] whatever he wants to do the only way
[1:25:25] we're going to be able to discern right
[1:25:27] and wrong is to have the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:29] our
[1:25:29] lives he goes on to say what then the
[1:25:32] answer is clear before us there is a
[1:25:34] true church and a false Church there is
[1:25:37] a True Vine and a false Vine and we have
[1:25:41] talked about the vines you're going to
[1:25:42] know them by their fruits and we know
[1:25:45] that branches can be grafted into the
[1:25:47] main Vine and they will have fruit they
[1:25:50] will have blossoms they will have great
[1:25:52] lives and they'll be living off of the
[1:25:54] main life but you know what their trunk
[1:25:57] is not the same as the original trunk
[1:25:59] and their fruit is not the same as the
[1:26:01] original Fruit and we know that their
[1:26:03] seed is not the same as the Original
[1:26:05] Seed and they can try and reproduce all
[1:26:07] they want and they will but they'll
[1:26:10] never be able to produce the right seed
[1:26:12] but there is one that can produce the
[1:26:15] right seed and that is the true
[1:26:18] vine the ratom he says but of course
[1:26:20] that false Church false Vine body will
[1:26:23] always try to usurp the position of the
[1:26:27] true church and contend that she and not
[1:26:31] the elect are the real and authentic the
[1:26:35] false will try to kill the true and you
[1:26:40] know we were talking about this a little
[1:26:41] while ago but I just want to emphasize
[1:26:42] this I want to emphasize this and this
[1:26:45] is just in my own way and some people
[1:26:46] might say brother Barry you're putting
[1:26:47] words in the prophet and you know what
[1:26:49] it's okay I want to say that it's okay
[1:26:51] you know to today we can't just take out
[1:26:54] a gun and go and persecute another
[1:26:55] church can we if we're the false we're
[1:26:58] not just going to take out a gun and go
[1:27:00] and shoot our brother that believes a
[1:27:02] little bit different than we do we're
[1:27:03] not going to do that we're not going to
[1:27:04] go with a baseball B I'm I'm getting a
[1:27:06] little bit crazy here we're not going to
[1:27:07] go and do that because we're Believers
[1:27:10] oh my but what about going and speaking
[1:27:12] bad about your brother and your sister
[1:27:14] the prophet of God says you can
[1:27:15] assassinate them you can kill their
[1:27:17] character just by your
[1:27:21] words the false will always try to kill
[1:27:24] the
[1:27:26] true that is how it was in the book of
[1:27:28] Acts that is how it is set forth in The
[1:27:31] Seven Ages and that is how it is
[1:27:33] declared in the various Epistles th it
[1:27:35] is how it has been that is how it is now
[1:27:39] that is how it will be it can't change
[1:27:41] because you know them by their
[1:27:44] fruits just have to give him enough life
[1:27:48] just keep pouring on the word just let
[1:27:50] the life manifest and event eventually
[1:27:52] their fruits are going to come man and
[1:27:54] you know what we can't manufacture
[1:27:57] fruits I can't if I'm an orange I can't
[1:28:00] be a lemon and if you're a lemon you
[1:28:02] can't be an
[1:28:04] orange but if we're the fruit of the
[1:28:06] Holy Ghost we're going to Bear the fruit
[1:28:09] of the Holy Ghost we're going to live
[1:28:10] the life of Jesus
[1:28:13] Christ he goes on to say now let us be
[1:28:15] very
[1:28:18] careful that we are not confused at this
[1:28:21] point that we will seek the word to
[1:28:24] validate this claim once again let's
[1:28:26] take it right back to the word of God
[1:28:28] right this this this Prophet let's take
[1:28:31] it back to the word to validate this
[1:28:33] claim let us go back to the book of the
[1:28:36] beginning Genesis in the Garden of Eden
[1:28:38] there were two trees one was good one
[1:28:41] was evil one produced life the other
[1:28:43] produced death there were two children
[1:28:46] who originally offered sacrifices to God
[1:28:50] let me repeat that both offered
[1:28:53] sacrifices to
[1:28:56] God Genesis 4
[1:28:59] 3-5 and in the process of time it came
[1:29:02] to pass that Cain brought of the fruit
[1:29:04] of the ground an offering unto the Lord
[1:29:07] and abble He also brought of the first
[1:29:09] things of his flock and of the fat
[1:29:11] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[1:29:14] Abel and his offering but unto Cain and
[1:29:16] to his offering he had not respect and
[1:29:19] we know the story all too well he went
[1:29:21] and said hey if you would just do like
[1:29:23] your
[1:29:24] brother I would respect you but he
[1:29:27] didn't have it in him did he because
[1:29:28] that wasn't his father he couldn't
[1:29:29] actually honor his father he couldn't do
[1:29:33] it it wasn't in him but we know that
[1:29:35] they both offered sacrifices and aren't
[1:29:37] you thankful for a prophet in our day
[1:29:39] that would be able to go back and
[1:29:40] actually see those sacrifices he lays it
[1:29:44] out so many times how beautiful the
[1:29:47] sacrifice that Cain must have brought it
[1:29:50] must have been the biggest church it
[1:29:52] must have had the tallest steeple he
[1:29:53] must have had all the greatest
[1:29:55] vegetables and the and the most
[1:29:57] fantastic fruits of the land everything
[1:30:00] the absolute best and then his
[1:30:04] brother Abel he brings a stinking lamb
[1:30:08] before God and brings it in and puts it
[1:30:11] up on the Altar and grabs a jagged Rock
[1:30:14] and starts to chop its neck and the
[1:30:17] animal starts squirming and kicking and
[1:30:19] bleeding and we know the cane must have
[1:30:21] been like ah look what's going on I've
[1:30:24] Got My Sacrifice you're squirting blood
[1:30:26] all over it and Abel was probably
[1:30:29] shuddering himself thinking what am I
[1:30:31] doing but I got to follow the Revelation
[1:30:33] that God's given me and we know that God
[1:30:36] said I respect you you did what I wanted
[1:30:39] you followed the Revelation that I gave
[1:30:42] you and the other guy who did all the
[1:30:45] work he was like the the mule brother
[1:30:47] bradam talks about he's a good worker he
[1:30:49] could go and harvest all of it he's a
[1:30:51] good businessman he was able to get it
[1:30:53] all there but it wasn't respected by
[1:30:57] God here we are in our day in this time
[1:31:00] of Total Blackout Darkness with a man
[1:31:03] that could paint those pictures to us to
[1:31:05] tell us the way that sacrifice went and
[1:31:08] and so many others in the Bible but just
[1:31:10] that story oh my there were two children
[1:31:13] both offered sacrifices to God let me
[1:31:15] repeat that they both offered sacrifices
[1:31:18] to God we read it Genesis 4: 3 to5
[1:31:21] brother B goes on to say but one Cain
[1:31:25] was evil being of his father that Wicked
[1:31:27] one while Abel was righteous before the
[1:31:31] Lord who was his
[1:31:34] father goes back to the original sin
[1:31:36] what really happened in the Garden of
[1:31:37] Eden did did they really just eat an
[1:31:39] apple or an apricot is that really what
[1:31:42] happened what conjures up in the mind of
[1:31:45] of everyone when when you say the
[1:31:48] original sin Hollywood knows it
[1:31:50] Hollywood came out with movies about it
[1:31:53] what is it music movies everyone knows
[1:31:57] what it is I'm just going to let that
[1:32:00] hang I'm not going to get into that
[1:32:01] tonight because I could just use up the
[1:32:03] rest of the time and then some with that
[1:32:04] one brother bam goes on to say again
[1:32:07] there were two children from the Flesh
[1:32:08] of the same parents they were the twins
[1:32:11] of Isaac and
[1:32:12] Rebecca and one was elect of God and the
[1:32:15] other
[1:32:17] reprobate both worshiped God brothers
[1:32:20] and sisters if we can Rec recognize that
[1:32:22] we have the ability to worship God that
[1:32:24] we truly are
[1:32:25] elected we have every single reason to
[1:32:28] Rejoice because some people are created
[1:32:31] to be
[1:32:33] destroyed some people are created to
[1:32:35] actually be saved some people are
[1:32:38] created to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:41] who are you
[1:32:42] tonight who are we tonight if we can
[1:32:45] recognize that we're truly elect of God
[1:32:47] there ain't nothing we did about it the
[1:32:49] only thing that we can do is recognize
[1:32:51] it and
[1:32:53] rejoice Rejoice for what he's done but
[1:32:56] you know he here he's laying it out both
[1:32:58] worship God in every single case there
[1:33:00] was worship of God involved in every
[1:33:03] case the evil hated the righteous and
[1:33:05] persecuted the righteous in some cases
[1:33:08] the evil destroyed the righteous but
[1:33:10] notice they were planted together they
[1:33:12] lived together they both made claims
[1:33:14] upon God and worshiped
[1:33:18] God these illustrations depict perfectly
[1:33:21] the parable of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:24] when he said that the kingdom of heaven
[1:33:26] was like unto a man who sowed good seed
[1:33:29] only to have an enemy come and plant
[1:33:31] tears amongst those good seeds God did
[1:33:34] not plant the tears Satan planted those
[1:33:37] tears right amongst the good seed of God
[1:33:41] those two kinds of plants people from
[1:33:44] two different seeds grew up together
[1:33:47] they partook of the nourishment in the
[1:33:49] same Earth they shared in the same Sun
[1:33:53] rain and all other benefits and both
[1:33:56] were harvested in their turn do you see
[1:34:00] it he says don't ever forget these
[1:34:03] truths don't ever forget these truths
[1:34:05] brothers and sisters as we study the
[1:34:09] church ages and latter the seals and
[1:34:12] above all don't forget that it is in
[1:34:14] this last age when the tears are getting
[1:34:16] Bound for their burning and they will
[1:34:19] shove out the wheat that is to be
[1:34:22] garnered for the Lord and we know we've
[1:34:25] heard it said brother Gilbert has
[1:34:26] preached it when the bride begins to say
[1:34:29] I and my father are one when the elected
[1:34:31] begins to say those words brothers and
[1:34:33] sisters the tears are actually going to
[1:34:35] pull away they don't like that now
[1:34:37] you're going and making yourself God but
[1:34:38] what about me but you know what we know
[1:34:41] them by their fruits we just heard it in
[1:34:43] this word here they're going to be the
[1:34:44] ones that
[1:34:46] persecute we can't prevent it we can't
[1:34:49] stop it we can't change it we love our
[1:34:51] brothers and our sisters they're still
[1:34:53] our brothers and our sisters it's up to
[1:34:54] God to sort them out it's not up to us
[1:34:57] to sort anybody out it's up to God
[1:35:00] entirely and promise I promise a money
[1:35:03] back guarantee he will sort every one of
[1:35:06] us
[1:35:07] out but as the elect we won't need to be
[1:35:11] sorted because we'll be actually with
[1:35:13] him doing the Sorting in his
[1:35:18] throne he says don't ever forget these
[1:35:20] truths we studi the church ages latter
[1:35:22] of the seals above all don't forget that
[1:35:24] it is in this last age when the tears
[1:35:26] are getting Bound for their burning and
[1:35:27] they will shove out the wheat that is to
[1:35:30] be garnered by the Lord I want to carry
[1:35:33] this thought all the way through so let
[1:35:35] us go a step further we've got just a
[1:35:38] few minutes here have you ever studied
[1:35:40] the history of revivals now a Revival
[1:35:42] signifies a move of God in power and
[1:35:45] every time God moves Satan is there to
[1:35:48] move also it never fails and we know
[1:35:52] that in the ministry of William Mari and
[1:35:53] Bram after his ministry suddenly Faith
[1:35:57] healing campaigns rose up all over the
[1:35:59] place isn't that interesting and if you
[1:36:00] were to go back and look at it on
[1:36:02] Wikipedia you would actually see it in
[1:36:04] the days of the great Welsh Revival and
[1:36:06] most didn't know this the insane asylums
[1:36:09] filled up quickly and there was a great
[1:36:11] display of devil power to take away the
[1:36:14] attention from God it is written that in
[1:36:17] Wesley's day the people would do the
[1:36:19] most peculiar things that were
[1:36:21] definitely of Satan to try to mock the
[1:36:25] goodness and power of
[1:36:28] God now I I I I haven't read about that
[1:36:31] but I'm going back to read that I want
[1:36:33] to see what that was that just sounds
[1:36:35] amazing to me not in a good way but to
[1:36:38] think that that's what happens take a
[1:36:39] look at what's going on in the world now
[1:36:41] think about all the distractions of
[1:36:43] Devils coming up all over the world and
[1:36:45] whether it's in sport whether it's in
[1:36:47] music whether it's in movies politics
[1:36:50] whatever ever it is the devil doesn't
[1:36:52] care he just wants our attraction he
[1:36:54] just wants to get us distracted off of
[1:36:56] the word of God so long as we're not
[1:36:58] looking at the word of God everything is
[1:36:59] fine in his world but boy oh boy when a
[1:37:01] true son or daughter starts to actually
[1:37:03] look towards Jesus starts to actually
[1:37:06] surrender their lives submit themselves
[1:37:09] therefore unto God and become to realize
[1:37:11] that he can resist the devil now then
[1:37:13] the devil has to
[1:37:15] flee in Luther's day it is said the
[1:37:19] miracle of his ministry did not lie in
[1:37:22] the fact that he successfully protested
[1:37:24] the Roman Catholic church but the
[1:37:26] miracle lay in the fact that he could
[1:37:30] and did stay sound and sane amidst the
[1:37:34] Fanatics who were often filled with and
[1:37:38] guided by wrong
[1:37:40] spirits and if you have been aware of
[1:37:43] this last day Ministry you will have
[1:37:45] noted the same invasion of false and
[1:37:48] wicked spirits and you know brothers and
[1:37:50] sisters we don't have to look very far
[1:37:52] Spirits don't die just because the
[1:37:54] prophet of God was taken off the scene
[1:37:56] those Spirits didn't die those Spirits
[1:37:58] have jumped into other people those
[1:38:00] Spirits under the guise of the message
[1:38:01] of the hour will allow people to
[1:38:03] actually worship them they will actually
[1:38:06] say in the name of some
[1:38:09] man they'll baptize in Christ brandom
[1:38:12] those are all false doctrines of
[1:38:15] devils it's terrible but just like any
[1:38:18] great move of God you get Fanatics that
[1:38:20] rise up it's not just exclusive to the
[1:38:22] message of the hour wouldn't it be
[1:38:24] interesting if we could just say that
[1:38:25] all of that fanaticism is just exclusive
[1:38:27] to the message of the hour you get it
[1:38:29] with the Pentecostals you get it with
[1:38:31] the Baptists you get it with all of the
[1:38:33] different denominational people out
[1:38:34] there you even get it with people who
[1:38:36] are maybe what they call secretari
[1:38:38] anisms they're they're separate from all
[1:38:40] of it they'll they'll have things like
[1:38:42] Waco Texas what was that I'll tell you
[1:38:45] what that's not this because anybody
[1:38:48] that wants to leave here you can leave
[1:38:49] at any time right
[1:38:51] there's no cult status here you're not
[1:38:53] here for life you're not threatened to
[1:38:56] stay here we encourage people to get to
[1:39:04] Christ
[1:39:08] my the miracle lay in the fact that he
[1:39:11] could and did stay sound and sane amidst
[1:39:13] the Fanatics who are often filled with
[1:39:16] and guided by wrong
[1:39:18] spirits and he says it right here and if
[1:39:20] you've been aware of this last day
[1:39:22] Ministry you'll have noted the same
[1:39:23] invasion of false and wicked spirits and
[1:39:26] he says it it has to be that way we have
[1:39:29] to recognize that it has to be that way
[1:39:31] brothers and sisters I'll call the
[1:39:32] musicians we'll try and end on time here
[1:39:35] it has to be that way he says now I hope
[1:39:38] and trust you are spiritual minded
[1:39:40] enough to get that and capitalize on it
[1:39:43] it has to be that way don't be surprised
[1:39:46] when we see Fanatics rise up when we see
[1:39:48] people rise up when we see people slaugh
[1:39:51] one another with their words don't be
[1:39:53] surprised by that those are the false
[1:39:55] and and wicked Spirits it's the devil
[1:39:58] that's all it is and that devil is
[1:40:00] either possessing that person or or or
[1:40:03] afflicting that person we don't know we
[1:40:06] just want to trust the Lord we want to
[1:40:08] trust the Lord that he's in complete
[1:40:09] control of all of it and I think when
[1:40:11] that happens brothers and sisters then
[1:40:13] we get that place of perfect rest that's
[1:40:15] where our Sabbath comes into play where
[1:40:17] we know that he's in control it doesn't
[1:40:19] matter though though though though he
[1:40:21] slay me yet I'll serve him we know that
[1:40:24] even David the king had that man spit on
[1:40:27] him and what did his say his man say the
[1:40:30] soldier that was with him he said you
[1:40:32] know what just just hold up one second
[1:40:34] maybe just take a step aside I don't
[1:40:35] want to get any blood on you I'm just
[1:40:36] going to draw my sword and take that
[1:40:38] dog's head off because he spat on my
[1:40:40] king and what did the king say you know
[1:40:42] what just just just just scale down
[1:40:45] don't worry about it God wanted him to
[1:40:47] do that God just wanted to see the way
[1:40:49] that we would react so don't worry about
[1:40:50] it I I know it's all okay we don't have
[1:40:52] to worry God's in control if he wants us
[1:40:54] to Exile from Jerusalem then we will and
[1:40:57] and we'll just let all that needs to
[1:40:59] happen happen and all of it will come to
[1:41:01] fruition all of it will manifest the way
[1:41:03] that it's supposed to it's not up to us
[1:41:04] to be pulling out tears we know that
[1:41:07] Jesus said that no just let them all
[1:41:08] grow up together and and and the Reapers
[1:41:11] will be the ones that actually do the
[1:41:12] separating and you know who the reapers
[1:41:14] are the reapers are angels and the angel
[1:41:16] Messengers by the preaching of the word
[1:41:19] they'll do the separating because
[1:41:21] they're preaching the word of God that's
[1:41:22] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:41:25] two-edged sword it's able to discern the
[1:41:27] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:41:29] and just slice and dice just completely
[1:41:31] get right down to the heart of the
[1:41:33] matter to separate the spirits from the
[1:41:35] natural but he says now I hope and trust
[1:41:39] you are spiritual minded enough to get
[1:41:41] that and to capitalize on it that it's
[1:41:43] going to be that way brothers and
[1:41:44] sisters there nothing we can do about it
[1:41:46] it's just the way it is there's the
[1:41:48] false and there's the truth and if you
[1:41:50] have the ability to hear the truth and
[1:41:52] to see the truth then I suggest that you
[1:41:55] just Rejoice because you might not
[1:41:58] always have that ability to hear that
[1:42:00] truth a and if you don't Rejoice you
[1:42:02] know what brother uh Jesus Christ he
[1:42:06] said that if you won't Rejoice if you
[1:42:09] won't worship then immediately the Rocks
[1:42:11] they'll cry out because all creation is
[1:42:13] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:42:15] sons of God you know what we're going to
[1:42:17] worship it's just the way it is maybe
