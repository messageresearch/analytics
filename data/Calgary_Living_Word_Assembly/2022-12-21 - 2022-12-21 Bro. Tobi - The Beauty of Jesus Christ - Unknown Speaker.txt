you um maybe we just turn on the scripture this evening thank you musicians to the Book of Esther read from Esther chapter one I want to thank brother Berry for the opportunity to be standing before the purchased possession of the Lord Jesus Christ but with his precious blood and we don't take this opportunities for granted it's not a we're not here to to give a motivational speech or give a presentation it's it's the word of God it's the Eternal Word of God that's we're trusting that he gives us the grace to step out of the way and he will present to his bride so we're going to read from the book of Esther chapter one I'll start from the first verse and read up to verse 12. since now it came to pass in the days of hazarus these are zeros which reigned from India even onto Ethiopia over 107 and 20 provinces that in those days when the king hazarus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in sushan the palace in the third year of his Reign he made a feast unto all the princes and his servants the power of Persia and media the Nobles and the princes of the provinces being before him when he showed the reaches of his glorious Kingdom and the honor of his excellent Majesty many days even a hundred and four score days and when these days were expired the king made a feast and to all the people that were present in shushan the palace both onto Great and Small seven days in the courts of the garden of the king's Palace where were white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black and marble and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels been diverse one from another and Royal Wine in abundance according to the state of the king and the drinking was according to the law none did compelled for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that it shall do according to Every Man's pleasure also vashti the queen Made A Feast for the women in the Royal house which belonged to King hazarus on the seventh day when the heart of the King was married with wine he commanded mehuman [Music] and cash the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of hazarus the king to bring vashti the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the prince is a beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's Commandments by his chamberlains therefore was the king very rough and his anger burned in him let's just have a quick word of prayer there father we've read from the pages of the scripture this scripture that we have before us is inspired your Prophet told us that every portion of this Bible is inspired so father the inspiration that was upon the writer which we know that was the inspiration of the Holy Spirit we ask that that same inspiration we bring context to those words that we've read tonight that's loaded to be used speaking to us just something that we need to have Lord on a night like this Lord Jesus Christ to go ponder over when we go to our homes and the glory of the honor and the praise will be thine for in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you you may have your sin I know it's Christmas time and I was wondering whether it will be appropriate to bring a Christmas message something like a Christmas message I know maybe the pastor will bring one on Christmas Day and Sunday but I was just thinking about you know whether this world fit um a Christmas message my title tonight is the beauty of Jesus Christ and that might you know sound very different from where we read the story of Esther um but as we go along you're going to see that this little story here shows us that the beauty of Jesus Christ is in a certain people and that's where we're going tonight so if I could jump ahead of myself a little bit is to let us know that the beauty of Jesus Christ is in certain people the world is looking for a baby Jesus and many times babies are very cute we look at them we want to spend time with them they smile it's different and that's what the world is looking for today but there is no baby Jesus today Jesus came in flesh God came in flesh for repurpose and that's the purpose is what we need to focus on today now where we read is the story of Esther but more of the story of part of the Journey of the children of Israel and we know that when Israel decided that they wanted a king over them God decided to give them a king it was Saul later on God gave them his own choice of a king which is David one of the things that God said to David is that if this people will serve me then I'll continue to bless them and you your seat will continue to sit on the throne which is my throne by God to a time when Israel decided to go away from the teachings of Moses the law that God had given to them and they went after all the gods and God punished them and the way God punished them was God made another country to come take over Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took over Israel we know that he got to a time where Nebuchadnezzar himself started to feel some level of Pride and he felt that he placed himself there and God gave him a heart of an animal that made him go into the Wilderness for for a number of years but God showed a vision to Daniel and part of the vision that God showed to Daniel God showed Daniel several kingdoms a number of Kingdoms that were going to come and Daniel seen in the future could see that there was also going to be the the um the kingdom of the passions and the Maddies and when he saw that that was going to happen God made him understand that this kingdom was going to go on for a while and then that kingdom was also going to fail it was going to be destroyed now the first king of the past the Persia and the Maddies was Cyrus and one of the things that Cyrus did was he gave the children of Israel the opportunity to go back to Israel the book of Ezra told us about how they started to build Jerusalem again but this King that we are reading about here was after Cyrus and his name is arazerus and the Bible told us that he had a domain of 127 provinces and those provinces included Israel now in the third year of his Reign this King I mean historians talked about the fact that it was about the time he was going to have a war with Greece and he wanted to get the support of all of his you know the leaders of his provinces so he invited all the provinces the Bible tells us that it's from India to Ethiopia which was in the Bible days but if we look at you know modern day it's a lot of countries put together now we had all those leaders come and the intention he had was to show the reaches of his glorious Kingdom and the honor of his excellent Majesty and for his leaders one of the things he did was to show them this thing so they can get their support to be able to go to war with Greece now that's party was for six months I don't think any of us has been a party that lasted six months but it was six months of feasting it was six months of having you know an opportunity to see how powerful this King was and after I was done with this Francis then he had seven days where he said you know what bring everybody in my kingdom stories also feel that maybe he got the approval of his princes and he wanted to celebrate and seven days he opened it up to everybody come to the Palace come have some food come have wine and he gave them the best I could give them and the wine that was given was not the wine that they were buying you know from the outside it was the King's Wine and brother Brown would always tell us that the physical types of spiritual so I'm not here to really give us a story that we probably know or some part of it that we don't know but to start to bring us to the realization that God allowed this to happen so that we can look at those examples and start to see our lives because there's also a king of kings and a lot of Lords today that stepped out and it's going to be interesting some of the things we're going to find the god of Heaven came down in flesh and the entire world is celebrating it but it did not come down in flesh just for you know the fact that he wanted people to see that he could condescend to to our level as humans he came in flesh for a certain purpose the Bible told us that he was sent to his own and his own received him not but to them that received him he has given the power to be called the sons of God so this kingazarus if we could go back to that after you had spent seven days feeding everybody giving them all that it could to make their hearts merry was a time of Joy was a time of Celebration he himself had taken some wine and he was happy he was married and the next thing he wanted to do was to show the beauty of his Queen now what I want us to understand is that the Bible never told us anything about the beauty of that King and the Bible told us about Jesus he said that Jesus agreed before God in Isaiah 53 I'll just read the message version I think he's really quite uh explanatory he said the seventh gree up before God speaking about Jesus is Crown is seedling it's probably plant in the parched field there was nothing attractive about him King James said no beauty that we should Behold Him there's no beauty that we should desire him nothing to cause us to take a second look why didn't he have the beauty because the beauty was not meant to be expressed through him his beauty is to be expressed through his bride and Jesus told us he said I am the vine ye are the branches he said the why cannot bring forth fruit of itself the fruit of the vine has got to come through the branches so when the king sent the seven chamberlains there were seven chamberlins and it's quite interesting that there were seven chamberlains that were sent to vashti vashti being the first bride of this King she was told to come and show her beauty now one of the things that you realize is that the reason that vashti refused to come and show a beauty to the King was because she did not realize that the beauty that she had was not cars in the first place it wasn't ours in the first place that beauty and as we will you know go on to see how Esther became Queen you will realize that the provision was made when Esther was going to be Queen just to go a little bit ahead of myself what was said to to the people what was the advice that was given to the king as we'll get there was that go and look for a lady she has to be a virgin and she has to be fair that was all she could be a common lady on the streets but when she comes into the palace everything that she requires for her beauty was made available by the king it had nothing to do with what she brought as a matter of fact she was not expected to bring anything in so vashti had gotten to a point where she got comfortable in the palace and started feeling that you know what this beauty I made it up myself it was because of my own resources it was because of my own intellect it was because of I was the fact that was more beautiful than others that was why I was chosen and that was one of the places that will see that she got it wrong so the beauty that we have as the bride of Christ is not ours what is the beauty that we have is the righteousness of Christ and he told us that if we try to bring our own Beauty it's filthy racks before him so he expects us to realize that the beauty that we have is his own Beauty because he has no Beauty that we shall be that we shall desire him so we realized that you know the seven chamberlies were sent to to to to vashti she refused she thought that the beauty that she had was ours and another thing that she did was that she had her own agenda a desire was not to the king we keep reading you know in verse 9 and he tells us that she made A Feast for the women in the Royal house so she was having her own party she was having our own mini domain where she was impressing certain people within the kingdom she was almost running a parallel government within that Kingdom so when the king asked her to come she refused remember Brown will tell us you know that's what he was talking about Esther you know looking at how Esther became king uh became Queen I'll get to that later but let me just take you know us to to that place because that's something I want to bring out here everything that Esther required was provided by the king monaster was also given a king's Chamberlain and something that was remarkable about Esther is that she refused every other thing apart from what the Chamberlain gave to her she refused every other thing she wouldn't take anything other than what the King has provided she understood that the Chamberlain was the closest to the king if we go back he told us about those seven chamberlains and he ex explained to us that they were the ones that were always before the king they had an opportunity to always be before the king they knew what the king liked and brother Brahm was sent to bring us the desire of the king what does the king like you know many times we can find ourselves in a situation where the enemy wants us to be like vashti where we feel like there's something more that we can do by ourselves where we feel like somebody said something somewhere that's different from what the brand said and it sounds a little bit more aligned with the Bible where you read something the brother Brahm is given maybe an analogy and explaining from the Bible and it doesn't sound exactly correct yet is the closest to the king so you take what he has brought to dress you up and brother Braham told us when he was here he was recording those messages he said that God told him to do that so that he can put them in the storehouse for the bride now when he put those things in the storehouse he also like Paul would tell us selected it shows before the foundation of the world will explain because these are callings of the lives of men of fivefold ministry brotherbraham called them God's dress wear what is their duty to go and bring the things that the King has provided and dressed the bride with it nothing more nothing less but the brand said in the message putting out the whole armor of God said now God fortified his army he said with what himself I know we're talking about a queen but it's the same in the applies of the analogy of an army for a nation none of those soldiers will ever need to think about where will my uniform come from none of the soldiers we ever think of where will the animation come from none of the soldiers we ever think of where will my training come from is the responsibility of the country to make that provision for them and brother Brahm said that every country will equip his army with the best the best that they have there's a war going on with Russia and Ukraine and Ukraine is of course getting the um the sympathy of the western world and the Western world is supplying as much as they can without getting put into to to go crazy you know with us with what can help Ukraine to be more fortified the best that they can that they could have and Ukraine is giving that to their army to fight the battle so brother Brian said is the same with God God fortifies his army with himself now this is the one that might stumble you he said in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors how did he fortify his army where do you find the ammunition in the fivefold they've got a calling in their life to do something many times we stumble at the vessel we stumble at the Badgers came but the Bible has taught us enough David has started running taught us enough to realize that when the anointing of God is upon the life of a man you've got to separate the man and the anointed the fault of Saul was not accounted to him by David because David recognized the anointing he said what did he do what was God doing he said listen did you ever think of that offices of the church is the Bible said is God's dress inside the dress an apostle the prophet a Seer for seeing it before Satan ever gets to it Don told it what is it God dressed up his church these offices is God's dress wear when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelists what is that that's God's dress wear God's presence God's spirits working through men then brother Birmingham gave us a caution here he said and if that offers denies any of this word then it's not God's dressing you see said no not that that's wolf in sheep's clothing what that fellow beware of him but when he takes what the word says remember that's God because he's speaking his word so but Abraham is explaining to us here that we as the bride of Christ God has also made provision for us for a certain set of men of God to bring what has already been stored remember it's got to be what is in the storehouse it's got to be that which has been kept in the storehouse being brought back to us and we've got to take it as was told John and eat it up vashti has no regard for the Lord because according to the law when the king gives a Commandments no one can change it it's quite interesting that when vashti refused to come as a call of the king of the Commandment of the king the king did not take the decision himself the king turned back to the princes the seventh princes it's chamberlings and I asked them what do I do in this situation and there were seven of them and it's interesting that it was the seventh that gave the council and I'm reminded by Brother Brown preached the message he said that the indicts mate and in preaching that message he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ who was indicting the church the small Sea church the original Queen that refused the Commandment of the king so this man came and said this is the council we have to ensure that this Behavior does not Cascade down to everyone in this Kingdom because as she has refused the the Commandment of the king other women in the Kingdom imagine we are talking about 127 provinces I don't know what size of the entire world that was at that time but must be significant all the women in the Kingdom there was a potential that they would become disobedient and disrespectful to their husbands they are going to reject leadership they're going to reject headship and that is exactly what happened to the denominations when they refused the word they rejected headship and God's Own Chamberlain God's Own messenger the seventh messenger came and said I inject this generation for crucifying Jesus Christ a second time and because of that she was deposed to set an example I don't want to get into families because brother I take it you know uh um a huge chunk of time to to get into that and I have been blessed my testimony is that those messages you know when you say Amen to the word you don't realize what he does you don't know when changes happen but I know that my marriage has been better by the grace of God from all those messages that have been coming I believe every one of us should have that testimony as well because when we say Amen to the word the Holy Spirit goes in and by itself starts to make that word come to pass Jesus Christ said the words I speak unto you they are spirits and life there's a spirit behind the word but that Spirit takes the word and brings it to pass in your life you've got to accept that word before that will happen so I used to say to sisters I say when the word says that you should be subject to your husband I said You shall enjoy that submission and when the word of God tells us as husband as well to love our wives we should enjoy that process and and you know the interesting thing is is unconditional he didn't say when she's good to you when she's respectful when she gives you food no and brother Brown you know I believe the word also tells us because brother Paul what he told us in Ephesians is as Christ loved the church and the question is when did Christ love the church when she was the best that could be she could be no when she was the worst when she was the Bible said we're enemies to go that was when the love happened so vashti was you know taken away from a position because she refused her headship I'm not going to be long tonight but let's take a look at Esther Esther she was a Jewish lady that lost her parents a cousin are taking that responsibility of Parenthood and she was one of the fair ladies and virgin so she met the criteria because the Council of the seventh Chamberlain was that let's look for a lady who's a virgin and they were supposed to look from all of 127 provinces and all those Maids were brought into the palace and handed over to a Chamberlain verse 15 of Esther chapter 2 says now when the churn of Esther the daughter of Abby held the uncle of Mordecai who had taken out for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what a guy the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so Esther she had no desire what was different about her it looks very simple but very important all the other mates were virgins as well all the other mates were afraid to look upon sometimes you look at other people I know if I should get to this but many times we look at Pentecostals young people sometimes you ask the question what's different about them sometimes they even probably live Better Lives the way you will see it they have better music they pray more than we do they probably witnessed more than we do two women came knocking on our door in the cold couple days ago we probably don't do that I think they're Jehovah Witnesses But realize this that though all those other Maids seem to meet the criteria their desire was different they did not exclusively desire only what the king provided they did not exclusively desire only the word they looked for more because when you show them the words they're going to tell you that no but my pastor said our church said accredit said so no matter how much they look like virgins with they could be virgins because they're foolish virgins as well but something that made us a difference was that she desired nothing else other than what was provided to her by the king and that's why brother Brahms said that the bride in this last age she will be not just a virgin but a virgin of the word a virgin of the word she will take nothing else into our spiritual womb other than the word of God and if there's any time that Satan is subtly coming to deceive it is right now it will bring something that doesn't that looks so much like the word but just has a little bit just like it did to if thou shall not surely die so we found out that's something that made Esther outstanding she had that desire she did not drink anything into the king's Palace she just came just as she was she ensured that the clothing that was put upon her because she was listening to the king's Chamberlain was according to the king's instruction she had to be purified for six months and that time of purification she was like a lamb she was like a sheep willing to give our wool because she knew that if she can meet the requirements or the instruction of the Chamberlain then she would have fulfilled the desire of the king and we cannot be purified by anything else because this bride of Jesus in this last closing moments of time will not be purified by man's ideas will not be purified by our traditions we will not be purified by anything else other than the word of God that's been given to us so we've got to take the word Ram said in the message the marriage of the Lamb he said he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle in her amen she's wholly Washed by the blood of his own self that's right so we see where we stand the wedding getting ready to come so now we find out she commits spiritual fornications going out with the world professing something living something different that won't never work I told us brother Brian indicted this generation and indicted the the religious organizations he said I have nothing against the people but there's a system that I'm against and he's saying that these people they have committed spiritual fornication so that will never work what the church ought to do is do like Esther deep Esther refused the adorning of the world so we know that little Book of Esther how that Mordecai his uncle other daughter and was down during the times of the Reigns of the Medics and Persians it's a very beautiful type there the king one of the greatest kings in the world that day he had a great feast and he called the queen to come said by him but she wouldn't do it she refused to do it so what did he do he was so humiliated they know what to do that his own wife wouldn't come I think that's a lot like Christ today Christ has invited us to set in Heavenly places with him and we are ashamed of it many people are ashamed to say that they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Pentecostal people that's right they are ashamed to say it we are ashamed of him and so the queen wouldn't come she refused to come it humiliated him his face changed red everybody noticed the Bible said I wonder if Jesus's face don't turn a little red too when he calls on us for a work calls on the Pentecostal movement for fellowship and Brotherhood and we are so tightly organized into little groups till we won't Bend for the other and the time of the brand was the Pentecostal church is the head of divisions but the time will come where those that accepted the message of the prayer will also allow the Visions to come in their midst but I believe that time is over because there's a promise that there will be a uniting time of the Bride and brother Brian said that first will come a Unity of the spirit before we'll have the unity of the faith and we are beginning to see the unity of the spirit now we are beginning to see those walls break we are beginning to see what the Bible give us an analogy somewhere he talked about a kind of a field of corn and how they had fancies in it and he said when they are small when they are not yet mature you can see the fences and he said but when they start to grow and get mature they grow above the fences and when an aviator is going on top of it you don't see the fences the fences are still there but they have now started to come and fellowship together but this Pentecostal organizations they refuse the ram said some people is afraid to say say well I belong I'm a Christian but I'm glad I got a Pentecostal experience well the ram said they are afraid to say that they've got a Pentecostal experience said amen I'm glad to Bear the name of Jesus Christ is the greatest privilege I ever had to say I'm a part of him so the question tonight is Lord help us we don't want to be like vashti want to be like Esther we want to show the beauty of Jesus you know that song says who would be Jesus to her who will be Jesus to them who will show the word that restores them again they don't need a judge they need a friend his time will stop to look at people and judge them it's time to start to look at them and ask ourselves the question what can I do to represent Jesus to this person what can I do to be Jesus well the Peter told us in First Peter 5 said likewise ye younger submit yourself unto the Elder yeah all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resists said the proud and giveth grace to the humble so he's telling us we should be clothed with humility remember tonight we're talking about the beauty of Jesus and right from the start we said that Jesus would not show his Beauty he has no beauty that we should desire him but that beauty must be somewhere that beauty is in you and I that songwriter says let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me I want the beauty of Jesus to be sitting with the sweetness of Jesus that's fruit has anyone ever tried to eat the back of a tree no no it doesn't taste good back in Africa we use it for medicinal purposes you boil it in water boy you put it in your mouth it's beet but take the fruit of that same tree and try when it's ripe try to eat it you will enjoy it why because it's the vines fruit is the trees fruits but the beauty of that tree the sweetness of that tree is not in the tree itself is the tree's choice or the Maker's choice to express the sweetness of that tree in the fruits So when you say oh we've got a mango tree we've got an apple tree an apple tree is giving us Good Apples you're not talking about the tree being sweet you're talking about the fruits being sweet and juicy so he wants us to be clothed with humility Isaiah says I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyfully my God for yet clothe me with the garments of salvation he had covered me with a rope of righteousness so how do we show the beauty of Jesus covet with the Robes of righteousness doing what is right regardless of the circumstances as a bridegroom decades herself with ornaments as a bride I don't like herself with her jewels Isaiah says again to appoint unto them that morning Zion to give them Beauty for Ashes that's what happens when you give your life to Christ you're coming from a life of Ashes but he's putting his Beauty on you give you beautiful ashes the oil of Joyful morning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified Romans 13 12 tells us the nicest fire spent the days at hand so let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light and brother Paul told us in Ephesians that finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the walls of the devil he told us we don't wrestle against flesh and blood we're resting against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places so he said for that reason we should take on the whole armor of God that we might be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand now how do we equip ourselves with the armor of God he said stand therefore having your loins got about with truth truth Thy word is truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness the breastplate is always in the front the breastplate is what you see first let people see us and see the righteousness of Christ in US let people see us and see the beauty of Christ in us when we you know when we're in our workplaces when we are doing our businesses don't let's you know go with the world and tell White Lies right lies I don't know if we use that technology here or that saying here but yeah it's it's it's almost the truth but not exactly the truth but let's be sincere let's let them be able to say if you want to know the truth go and meet this person they're the ones in school let them be able to say if you want to know the truth go and meet this person because I know they will always tell the truth and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith where we we are with ye shall be able to quench all the fairy darts of the wicked and take the elements of Salvation And The Sword of the spirits which is the word of God said praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all things and one of the things that we know is that the reason why we are here to be manifested is because it's preparing us for our home so it's clothing Us in his righteousness so that we might be acceptable before him that on the day when he will say oh I'm pulling up I'm pulling out your cards or he's saying that I'm taking you up in the rapture we might be acceptable and Paul told us he said for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved and many times when we actually look at this Earthly body you you see how quickly it starts to to lose its strength right and uh you know when we're young it's you feel like you can carry the entire world on your shoulders and you start to get to that fourth floor and things start to change so it's telling us if this Earthly Tabernacle the Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands he channeled in the heavens he said for in this one we groan we are groaning because we fall sick we're groaning because we fail God because our flesh gets in the way but we are not just groaning we're earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with a house which is from heaven so it gives us his righteousness I think what Barry was talking about that we have a down payment of our Redemption when you receive the Holy Ghost you have received a down payment what's a down payment a down payment is like a deposit you get the Redemption of your soul but there's still some more to do in the future in the future the full Redemption includes the Redemption of our body where we will never die I heard somebody say this but I never thought about it before that time do you know what is going to build I think but the very said it do you know what's going to be like to live for a thousand years on this Earth not heaven on this Earth but no school no work no getting old nor having to feel tired there is nothing to worry about no bad feelings towards anybody no evil for a thousand years I can't imagine it it will blow your mind to even think about it but that's the promise that we had that is the full payment of our Redemption that is where we are going that is why all the efforts were put in that's the reason we come to church that's the reason we listen to tapes at home that's the reason when we do something wrong we can't wait to repent of it and we go crying to God and say Lord I'm so sorry that's the reason when we hear the word of God something drops in our heart and we cannot just control our emotions anymore because there's a down payment there she said he saw that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we are in this for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan been burdened not for that we will be on clothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life Ram said in birth pains he said the Bible said his wife has made herself ready at the End of the Age do you notice he said his wife Revelation he's always talked about the bride in the first part you know the bride the bride the bride he gets to the last part and when he was going to introduce the school man he introduces r as the wife why because the marriage is happening right now that invisible Union is happening now but Abraham said at the end of the age the Bible said his wife has made herself ready how did she make herself ready to becoming his wife Remember by the time she's wife a relationship has happened the consummation has happened she has taken on his seed in our womb and what does and what does she what kind of a garment she had on but the RAM said she had on his own word she was dressed in his righteousness said that's what is it's his right and brother Brian gave us you know I was just close with this musicians maybe you can come was talking about a vision that he saw and he told us about this in recognizing your day and its message and I think this just kind of wraps up our thoughts tonight that God decided to show his prophet two different Brides he showed that the world bright and I want us to remember that when we talk about the fact that all through the church ages God had a bride but she kept organizing she kept leaving the word and God kept rejecting her we should always remember that at a point she was God's bride just like vashti was Queen at some point God's move was the Pentecostals Azusa Street was not a put on Azusa Street was the move of God and at that time if you wanted to find where God was you had to be in that group but from what I heard they said one of the most popular prophecies when that Revival was on is that God kept telling them if you organize I will leave you and I don't think it took up to three years or just about three years or three and a half years and they organized and he left them so but the brand saw a vision and in the vision he saw this people when they started out they were like us their women did not wear pants they had long hair they did the things that the word said they should do as a matter of fact I think if I'm not mistaking some of them probably baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean I'm not 100 sure on that but what I'm sure about is I was seeing an interview of some of them and they talked about when they received the Holy Ghost and they started to speak in tongues and I was asking this woman what was it like I said oh we had people from different parts of the world they were hearing these people in their own local languages just like it was on the day of Pentecost not the one they are doing today that they out they have to teach you how to speak in tongues I don't want to share my experience those years when I was I was finding myself in that group but they'll push your head until you say something so what am I trying to say this bride started out right but she got to a point I'm going to quickly read what Abraham here where she became naked the Bible said that I remember that vision of last week that when the bride came to be preview of it there came up a little bright lovely in the vision and I'm not thinking about it just sitting there watching outside and there come the bride I had a voice by the side of me saying here is a preview of The Bride and she came by I noticed her the way she was very lovely pretty young she was working just the step as she could not a much just in the stride of a woman how the work gracefully ladylike that's the way she was walking coming to my left on this side and she went on my side and he turned me to the right side and he showed me each church as they've come up out of the ages and oh how vulgar and the last one was this last day Church age which was led by a witch and they were so immorally dressed so filthy looking and they were matching the time of twist and rock and roll and those women throwing themselves just in twists and holding just paper great hypocritical the gray is between a white and a black which is a deceiving color gray is neither white nor black it's a deceiving color and gray looking paper holding in front of them with less like hula skirts holding in front of them and completely nude from their waist up I was marching or type of twisting and carrying on with that music working up and said the voice told me the Bram said that's the church a small Sea church and when it passed by me my heart like fainted I thought if that's what is trying to be presented to Christ as a bride of all the efforts and the things that man has put forth to try to bring for the bride for Christ and a vulgar dirty filthy looking prostitute like that to be the bride of Christ Graham said it made me sick at my heart and as she passed coming before where we were standing she was all on the paper in front of our twisting and rocking and moving herself one side and then the other side as she went like the modern dances they have of this day using herself in an immoral act as she was marching on LeBron said I'm not responsible for these things I can only see what I seen and God has my judge but that was the church from USA now as she passed by the old back Parks had no covering at all and then as she passed by I felt faint and sickly then he said the bride will come into preview again and here the bride came behind her the very same looking bride that passed at the beginning then my heart jumped for joy to know that there will be a bride do we believe that tonight does that make us rejoice as well he said there will be a bride regardless of what's going on in the in the world today regardless of how people have denied Christ regardless of how more and more the church is embracing the world and the world has become the church and the church become the world but there will be a bride is a past age for the bride it's in the past we are not in the loud Asian age we are in the bright age but Ram said I know that there will be a bride and she will be made of the same thing and clothed in the same thing that the one was at the beginning we are going to be dressed just like the first church but first churches I'm not saying the the domination church but the first church age where the brand said that the the Pentecostal age is coming back again foreign he said there's going to be a time where it's going to be like the time of ananias and Safir that no man don't join himself till then because the power of God will be so much displayed the righteous the righteousness of God will be so much in her that no one will come near no John Lewis spirit is that what's will come near she'll be made of the same clean and clothing the same thing that the one was at the beginning she is to be called and I know that is the truth but the problem said if that isn't truth then every Vision that I've had in the back has been wrong and anyone knows not one thing as ever as he ever told us but was the truth so if every other Vision has come to pass if we've seen him shout about the lives of people and tell them they're going to be healed and they got healed then the promise the vision that there will be a bride we also come to pass let me just say in closing and brotherbraham saw the preview of that bride he said he saw that some of them started stepping out of line and that's always a check for me Lord help me so they started stepping out of line I said right in the vision he started to scream get back in line and that's what he was screaming until he came out of the vision so if I checked my life tonight if you check your life tonight and you see that you started to step out of the line hear the word of the messenger he had the one of the prophets what has he said to us get back in line let's be on our feet tonight [Music] feel the chamber be free [Music] Speak to Me Gently as I close the door my heaven lover let thy presence cover she cried Earth [Music] is all I know blessing that once born till

tonight that Jesus has no other way to show his Beauty without yourself and myself in our little corners and the places that he want us to be in this assembly in the callings of Our Lives as husbands as wives his parents his children is waiting to manifest himself through us his promise to have a bride and he gave a description of our he said she will be without spot without wrinkle without blemish I want to be a member of that bride I believe he has called me to be it but I want to be sure like you said let everyone that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity I want to look in my life if there's any iniquity in me I want to say Lord please take it away let the beauty of Jesus the sin in me let it be Jesus alone that I project and when people see me they will know that something is different about me and when I see that happening in my life if I see that happening already let me know that I'm I'm to clothe myself with humility and know that my beauty is not mine but
