[46:55] have brother
[46:56] Danny delondo here from Manila
[46:59] Philippines with us once again for the
[47:01] second service this is his first time in
[47:04] Canada he's been to the us a few times
[47:07] when we were in Philippines in January
[47:09] we were able to fellowship with brother
[47:12] Dany he took us into his home and
[47:15] brought us around Philippines and
[47:16] introduced us to the many different
[47:18] churches the many many outreaches that
[47:21] he is involved in he showed us the Youth
[47:23] Camp I believe it's coming up mentioned
[47:26] it in the past but this is the brother
[47:28] right here who is putting together the
[47:29] Youth Camp it's going to be an
[47:31] international Youth Camp I believe is it
[47:33] 24 it's 2024 in Philippines so it's open
[47:38] to uh International youth so I'm sure it
[47:41] will be a huge uh event and a time of
[47:44] Fellowship around the things of the
[47:46] lord we were having a conversation uh
[47:49] the boys and I about brother Danny and I
[47:53] said to the boys you know it's kind of
[47:56] too bad because I didn't get to hear
[47:57] brother Danny preach when I was there
[48:00] and I think it was Benjamin that said to
[48:02] me but you did get to hear him preach
[48:04] and I said well no I didn't I didn't get
[48:06] to sit and hear him and he said no you
[48:08] didn't you heard him interpret for
[48:11] you so you know it's a it's a thing and
[48:15] we've all seen it I'm sure um when you
[48:17] have an interpreter and you have a
[48:19] minister you both fall under the same
[48:22] anointing and and it's a real a real
[48:24] thing so we did hear brother Danny
[48:26] preach but uh not directly like we did
[48:28] last night or today and we're certainly
[48:30] excited to hear what the Lord has placed
[48:32] on our brother's heart and we know how
[48:34] it goes if we go to pulling he'll go to
[48:36] preaching and uh we'll hear from the
[48:39] Lord today maybe we could just sing that
[48:41] last uh song that we were singing the
[48:44] fourth verse of it as we invite our
[48:47] brother to come and just take his
[48:48] Liberty

[54:09] man and the face of a lion and the right
[54:13] side and they for had the face of an ox
[54:17] on the left side they also had the face
[54:21] of an
[54:22] eagle thus where their faces and their
[54:26] wings were stretched upward two wings of
[54:29] everyone were joined one to another and
[54:32] two covered their bodies and they went
[54:35] everyone straight forward with the
[54:38] spirit was to go they went and they
[54:42] turned not when they
[54:44] went then
[54:46] let's uh passed
[54:50] forward to the Book of Revelation the
[54:52] scripture that we used last night in
[54:55] Revelation 4:7 and the first Beast was
[54:58] like a
[54:59] lion and the second beast like a cal and
[55:03] the third Beast had a face as a man and
[55:07] the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle
[55:10] amen may the Lord adds blessing to the
[55:14] reading of his word let's all bow our
[55:16] heads in prayer dear heavenly father we
[55:18] thank you this morning Lord you just
[55:22] make your way once again uh I'm
[55:26] entirely dependent upon you Lord I
[55:30] cannot speak anything that is
[55:33] outside your will and may you have your
[55:37] Liberty just
[55:39] use this yielded vessel
[55:42] Lord to speak whatever is pleasing to
[55:46] you and would be a blessing to your
[55:49] people this morning Lord bless your
[55:52] people bless the family Lord for all
[55:55] their
[55:56] kindness just such a spiritual and
[55:59] Heavenly atmosphere with your people and
[56:03] with the family and we thank you Lord
[56:05] for this message that you have given us
[56:08] as we give you Lord all the glory and
[56:10] the honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[56:14] amen hallelujah let's give clap worship
[56:17] to the Lord this
[56:18] morning amen praise the Lord God bless
[56:22] you amen you may now be seated
[56:25] thank you so much amen so uh so last
[56:30] night we uh the Lord has shown us amen
[56:33] you know these things are actually uh in
[56:36] US because uh the seed of God Amen it
[56:39] contains all the potentials amen and
[56:42] just like a a mango mango tree that you
[56:46] it has you know it's
[56:47] bearing thousands of fruits alog
[56:51] together amen but it only comes from one
[56:53] seat amen amen so when you uh when you
[56:57] see the seed you don't see anything and
[56:59] it's just simple but you don't have to
[57:03] add anything into it but everything all
[57:06] the attributes all the uh uh the things
[57:10] that is being contained by that seed is
[57:12] already in there it has just to die and
[57:16] you know to the the the soil must be
[57:19] watered and in due time it just breaks
[57:22] out and you know just like the word just
[57:25] like the Roman Candle you know it keeps
[57:27] on it keeps on unfolding itself amen
[57:31] showing that the Lord has given
[57:34] potential in that seed amen so it's the
[57:37] same thing with the word of God Amen uh
[57:40] the word of God in in every generation
[57:43] there is an alloted Revelation for that
[57:46] age and people in that age cannot live
[57:49] higher than the Revelation that God has
[57:52] given amen you cannot live higher than
[57:55] your Revelation you only leave what is
[57:57] being revealed to you amen so uh uh when
[58:02] you are deeply revelated by this word
[58:05] amen the light that is being shown
[58:07] manifested in US amen uh uh it only
[58:10] depends on that amen so that's
[58:14] why uh in in in the lion age uh uh the
[58:20] early church ages they check every
[58:23] spirit they're not afraid so that's why
[58:27] the the spirit of those people who say
[58:29] you know we are uh uh we are we're
[58:33] Apostles amen the lion anointing amen
[58:37] that check those kinds of spirit are
[58:39] being exposed amen and they found out
[58:42] that they are not uh uh the apostles
[58:45] amen but they are synagogue of Satan
[58:47] amen they call themselves Jews because
[58:49] you know uh all these things but later
[58:52] on Amen when the spirit moved into the o
[58:55] anointing and that they have to give
[58:57] their life and they value amen the life
[59:00] that is eternal Beyond this temporary
[59:02] life they were willing to exchange the
[59:06] life that they had amen because you know
[59:09] when you buy something when you buy
[59:11] something you are willing to sacrifice
[59:15] what you
[59:16] have in exchange of what you desire to
[59:19] have amen sometimes you look at a
[59:22] picture and without any knowledge on a
[59:24] picture on the painting you see you know
[59:26] especially if it is an abstract painting
[59:28] amen people would pay millions of
[59:32] dollars but people who don't understand
[59:35] the value the the uh uh the one who who
[59:39] made that painting you know they will
[59:41] not spend any single penny on that but
[59:45] the the the the one who is revelated the
[59:48] one who has the understanding of you
[59:50] know the background of this painting the
[59:53] background of the painter and how he had
[59:56] you know H H prior to his completion you
[59:59] know he's willing to give that he's
[1:00:02] willing to give everything he has in
[1:00:05] exchange of that amen so that's why in
[1:00:08] in in those generation under the O
[1:00:11] anointing they gave their lives amen the
[1:00:14] Bible said you know they did not
[1:00:16] consider lives their lives dear to them
[1:00:19] because there is something more amen
[1:00:22] there is something more that if they
[1:00:24] give their lives they close their eyes
[1:00:27] and once they open it they are on the
[1:00:28] other side and they enjoy the blessings
[1:00:30] of the Lord amen and so now all those
[1:00:33] people you know the uh during the Dark
[1:00:36] Ages the the the Lord has given wisdom
[1:00:39] and uh uh the the preachers the
[1:00:41] ministers were highly educated because
[1:00:43] that was the anointing given to them you
[1:00:45] know they they're willing to you know
[1:00:48] Martin Luther even uh exposed the more
[1:00:52] than 90 uh false teachings of the Roman
[1:00:54] Catholic church and and and he was so
[1:00:57] una afraid Amen to post
[1:00:59] that at the door of the castle church
[1:01:03] and even challenged the pope to to
[1:01:05] refute what he has uh discovered amen as
[1:01:09] the he was he was uh inspired by that
[1:01:14] amen but we come to this point amen that
[1:01:17] uh uh that the Flying Eagle anointing is
[1:01:20] vested upon us and just like in the in
[1:01:22] the parable of the good Samar
[1:01:25] where you know uh we see the the God's
[1:01:28] predestination there because the one who
[1:01:30] who came down brother Brenham said he is
[1:01:33] he is from Jerusalem he just went down
[1:01:36] to Jericho amen he's not he's not a a
[1:01:40] resident of Jericho he came from
[1:01:43] Jerusalem he backl amen meaning he he he
[1:01:46] left his his glorious
[1:01:49] position and and and went down to that
[1:01:52] level and that's why he was wounded
[1:01:55] everything was stolen out of him amen
[1:01:58] but you see the Good Samaritan there is
[1:02:00] not just somebody who who who who does
[1:02:02] good things in the community in the
[1:02:04] neighborhood but the Good Samaritan
[1:02:06] there is the Lord
[1:02:08] himself who came the Bible said he came
[1:02:10] where he was he came where he was
[1:02:14] meaning you know our uh Our
[1:02:18] Redeemer came where we
[1:02:20] were amen we just come here this just
[1:02:23] tempor
[1:02:25] amen we came we we go back to the
[1:02:27] Heavenly Jerusalem because we belong
[1:02:29] there we come from there amen and so he
[1:02:32] uh so when when the Good Samaritan found
[1:02:35] this this uh this guy who who Baxley
[1:02:38] left his position amen he was wounded
[1:02:40] everything you know he sacrificed
[1:02:42] everything he he was robbed until
[1:02:45] nothing is left of him amen and that's
[1:02:47] the good thing in the in in the grace of
[1:02:50] the Lord amen the Good Samaritan left
[1:02:52] his throne and went down amen and that
[1:02:55] Fallen that man under the Fallen
[1:02:58] condition it is each and every one of us
[1:03:00] we were wounded we were robbed amen and
[1:03:03] and and that oil and uh H uh that
[1:03:06] healing uh wound and and remember after
[1:03:09] that he said the the the Good
[1:03:11] Samaritan he attended to
[1:03:15] him and brought him to the host
[1:03:19] yes brought him to the host
[1:03:23] pastor brought him to a home church
[1:03:27] that's why you are here amen and and
[1:03:29] remember the Samaritan said to the host
[1:03:32] Pastor take good care of
[1:03:35] him I'm the one who brought him to you
[1:03:38] take good care of him he might have some
[1:03:41] shortcomings he might have some
[1:03:44] weaknesses but do everything you can
[1:03:47] amen but remember he he asked the uh uh
[1:03:51] uh uh the uh the host said
[1:03:54] whatever you do on top amen whatever you
[1:03:58] do beyond what you have to do he said
[1:04:00] when I come amen when I come
[1:04:05] again I shall repay
[1:04:10] you amen hallelujah thank you Lord so
[1:04:14] that's why we're here and so all these
[1:04:15] anointings Through the Ages being sent
[1:04:18] by the Lord to call and Peak and he said
[1:04:21] you know uh after that you know he said
[1:04:23] before being into the host the Samaritan
[1:04:26] said and he set him in his own
[1:04:32] Beast the Samaritan after uh touching
[1:04:36] him healing him the Samaritan said he
[1:04:40] set him in his own
[1:04:43] beast and Beast is power amen so the
[1:04:48] Good Samaritan placed Us in his own
[1:04:51] Beast not somebody else's Beast beast
[1:04:54] but his own Beast amen so all the
[1:04:57] generation amen all the bride in history
[1:05:00] they sat amen they were set in his own
[1:05:04] Beast amen so lion anointing Beast amen
[1:05:08] Ox anointing Beast amen man anointing
[1:05:11] beast and now God the bride has set us
[1:05:14] in his own Beast the pling anointing H
[1:05:18] uh uh Eagle anointing Beast the power
[1:05:21] Amen to overcome the challenge of the
[1:05:24] enemy in this day that we are living in
[1:05:27] so how should we be
[1:05:30] afraid
[1:05:32] amen so
[1:05:34] now uh let's compare let's
[1:05:38] compare uh verse 10 of Ezekiel to
[1:05:43] Revelation 4:7 now look here in verse 10
[1:05:47] it says As for the likeness of their
[1:05:49] faces notice the first one he mentioned
[1:05:53] was they for had the face of a
[1:05:57] man second the face of a
[1:06:02] lion and then the third the face of an
[1:06:07] ox did you notice some
[1:06:12] difference but in the Book of Revelation
[1:06:16] look at the sequence John said the first
[1:06:19] Beast
[1:06:20] was like a
[1:06:23] lion
[1:06:25] oh if Ezekiel and John met in a
[1:06:29] Minister's
[1:06:34] meeting I imagine how could that
[1:06:39] be amen so John said the first Beast was
[1:06:43] like a lion but to Ezekiel the first was
[1:06:46] man amen the second beast mentioned by
[1:06:50] John was a cal Amen to is jel it was
[1:06:55] lion amen but the third to John is face
[1:06:59] of a
[1:07:00] man but to Ezekiel the third was the
[1:07:04] face of an
[1:07:05] ox it's it looks like it's
[1:07:08] rumbled right
[1:07:13] amen but I see something good
[1:07:16] here it looks like they're differ in the
[1:07:19] first three but in the
[1:07:22] end
[1:07:25] at least they agree In the
[1:07:28] End Amen they both agree that the last
[1:07:32] will be the
[1:07:33] eagle amen but let me just show you
[1:07:36] there's no argument in this if you see
[1:07:39] there's no argument because if you're
[1:07:41] going to find out amen uh uh Ezekiel was
[1:07:44] not actually uh mentioning the Beast or
[1:07:48] the creators in
[1:07:50] order but
[1:07:52] Ezekiel was mentioning them said on the
[1:07:56] right side and on the left side all
[1:08:00] right so it is only uh uh you know
[1:08:05] that's why in in the message of the
[1:08:07] Prophet there's no
[1:08:11] argument it's only on which side on
[1:08:15] which angle or point of you we're
[1:08:19] looking at amen and uh so that's why I
[1:08:23] would like to give a title on this
[1:08:26] message the placing of the prophecy amen
[1:08:30] the placing of the prophecy and uh we
[1:08:33] have to understand that it's
[1:08:36] not uh it's not the fold
[1:08:39] Ministry placing the
[1:08:42] prophecy
[1:08:44] but in the message hear ye him he said I
[1:08:48] do not mean to be sack religious my by
[1:08:51] making this mistake or this statement
[1:08:53] and if it's a mistake God forgive me but
[1:08:56] it's like a jigo pule that you have to
[1:09:00] and he said putting it
[1:09:03] together you have to have the Holy
[1:09:07] Spirit to put it
[1:09:09] together amen hallelujah so I believe
[1:09:14] I'm not misquoted in saying it's not the
[1:09:16] Bold Ministry because it should be the
[1:09:18] PIP ministry under the inspiration and
[1:09:22] the placing of the holy spirit amen in
[1:09:26] that way amen there should be no man
[1:09:28] there should be uh no Ministry no church
[1:09:31] that is on top of the other amen I am
[1:09:34] not highly revelated than brother uh
[1:09:37] mbin than brother Barry or otherwise
[1:09:40] amen but we're just doing our portion to
[1:09:44] accomplish God's commission amen and we
[1:09:48] all have a portion I may have a little
[1:09:50] portion in the ministry amen but but
[1:09:53] realizing that I am part of the ministry
[1:09:56] the body will not be completed without
[1:09:59] meah amen somebody might be deeper amen
[1:10:03] uh uh uh uh in in seeing things in this
[1:10:06] message but somehow my shallow
[1:10:09] understanding of the message Still
[1:10:11] Remains a part of a big body mystical
[1:10:15] body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:10:17] that's why we need each other we
[1:10:19] compliment one another we encourage one
[1:10:22] another amen Hallelujah we care for one
[1:10:26] another amen thank you Lord so now uh I
[1:10:31] said uh uh uh the I let me quote
[1:10:35] Jeremiah chapter 29 he said in verse 11
[1:10:38] for I know the thoughts that I think
[1:10:41] toward you thoughts of peace and not of
[1:10:44] evil listen to give you unexpected end
[1:10:48] hallelujah amen I can close my Bible
[1:10:51] from here and say goodbye God bless you
[1:10:55] amen because the Lord has given us
[1:10:57] unexpected end so that's why the Lord in
[1:11:00] these two scriptures we can compare that
[1:11:03] in the end they see the same thing amen
[1:11:05] it must be in the end the eagle
[1:11:08] anointing amen so we see but why so it's
[1:11:13] you know when when uh uh bam said when
[1:11:16] when Satan tempt you when Satan
[1:11:19] challenge you and you're certain
[1:11:21] struggle amen and uh Satan will always
[1:11:25] point us to who we
[1:11:31] were
[1:11:33] amen but bam said when the devil points
[1:11:37] you to your
[1:11:40] yesterday Point him to his
[1:11:46] future amen because I want that there
[1:11:49] are two there are two significant points
[1:11:52] that I want to live with you and I hope
[1:11:54] the Lord will help me to deliver these
[1:11:56] two points number one God keeps his
[1:12:01] appointment he keeps his promise he
[1:12:03] keeps his word and he always backs his
[1:12:08] word amen no matter how you how people
[1:12:11] can interpret misinterpret amen God
[1:12:14] backs up his word amen he always keeps
[1:12:18] his
[1:12:19] appointment amen uh and so that's why in
[1:12:23] in the book of habac the the the the the
[1:12:26] the the Bible said in verse three for
[1:12:28] the vision is yet for an appointed time
[1:12:34] amen but at the
[1:12:38] end amen hallelujah that's why no matter
[1:12:42] what kind of condition we are in right
[1:12:44] now remember in the end hallelujah
[1:12:48] hallelujah we shall overcome because he
[1:12:52] greater is he that is is in you than he
[1:12:55] that is in the world no matter how hard
[1:12:58] your situation no matter how how far our
[1:13:02] loved ones are no matter how hard our
[1:13:05] family situation is right now remember
[1:13:08] in the end of this world God keeps his
[1:13:12] promise God will piix
[1:13:15] everything Hallelujah and so he said now
[1:13:18] but at the end it shall speak and not
[1:13:20] lie though it t what are you praying for
[1:13:24] sometimes you look go it might be too
[1:13:26] late Lord I've been praying for this and
[1:13:29] and yet I don't see it in our mind don't
[1:13:32] it
[1:13:33] t wait for it there is virtue in Waiting
[1:13:39] amen they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:13:44] renew their strength amen because the
[1:13:47] promises though it t weit for
[1:13:51] it because it will surely come it will
[1:13:55] surely
[1:13:57] come
[1:13:59] Lord the word of God is being placed in
[1:14:02] the mouth of the
[1:14:05] Bride amen though it t wait for it
[1:14:08] because it will surely come it will not
[1:14:12] t amen and number two second point is
[1:14:18] just keep moving forward now notice here
[1:14:21] in verse 12 after saying the it look the
[1:14:25] the sequence uh uh man lion ox and then
[1:14:29] the eagle and then in verse 12 and they
[1:14:31] went
[1:14:32] everyone straight where
[1:14:37] forward the four
[1:14:39] beasts that the Bible and they went
[1:14:42] everyone straight forward with the
[1:14:45] spirit was to go and they turned not
[1:14:49] when where they went amen so this is The
[1:14:54] Secret of perfectly placing the prophecy
[1:14:58] as the Lord says it amen Ezekiel
[1:15:02] mentioned uh uh H uh man lion ox and the
[1:15:09] eagle amen but in verse 12 he said this
[1:15:13] Beast keep on moving
[1:15:16] forward they were Not Looking Backward
[1:15:20] they kept on moving forward amen now so
[1:15:24] as long as they're moving forward now we
[1:15:28] see them in the Book of Revelation in
[1:15:30] the end Revelation is the book of
[1:15:32] endings amen so that's why we see all
[1:15:35] these beast in the Book of Ezekiel it
[1:15:38] looks like they're being in this array
[1:15:39] they're not out of place if we look to
[1:15:41] see from the point of John amen but the
[1:15:44] secret is they kept moving forward amen
[1:15:48] they keep moving forward Not Looking
[1:15:50] Backward amen moving forward no matter
[1:15:52] how slow
[1:15:57] yes there must be a big challenge before
[1:16:00] us a huge mountain yes of problems of
[1:16:05] struggles before us but keep moving
[1:16:09] forward if you need to climb climb make
[1:16:12] sure you're moving forward if it's so
[1:16:14] steep go around you may spend longer
[1:16:17] time but keep moving forward if you
[1:16:20] cannot go around you cannot go up go
[1:16:22] underground
[1:16:25] just keep moving forward and in the end
[1:16:28] everything will be in
[1:16:32] place hallelujah amen thank you Jesus
[1:16:37] keep moving forward amen so now in in
[1:16:41] that's why brother BR made mention in
[1:16:43] Revelation 16:3 quoting this and he said
[1:16:46] then clean spirits come out of the mouth
[1:16:48] of the Beast do you know what an unclean
[1:16:50] spirit said like frogs did you over
[1:16:53] notice how a frag looks a frag is always
[1:16:55] looking backwards he never looks forward
[1:16:59] looking back always back look back Amen
[1:17:02] in paragraph 74 he said
[1:17:05] now Christian don't do
[1:17:08] that a Christian don't try to be what he
[1:17:11] used to be he's not looking where he's
[1:17:14] been he's looking where he's going where
[1:17:18] are you looking this morning Hallelujah
[1:17:21] see don't pay no attention to what you
[1:17:23] were then you've done live that out you
[1:17:27] will never return to it that's in the
[1:17:30] past and any man that drives life's Road
[1:17:33] looking through a rear view mirror will
[1:17:35] go to wreck and so will you on this
[1:17:37] Christian Road Don't Look Back what you
[1:17:40] were look what you're going to be Paul
[1:17:42] said forgetting those things which are
[1:17:44] in the past I press towards the mark of
[1:17:48] the High Calling of Christ Hallelujah
[1:17:50] don't look back
[1:17:53] amen hallelujah so that's why sometimes
[1:17:57] when you greet a a a a positive
[1:17:59] Christian how are you amen hallelujah
[1:18:01] what do we say sometimes you know when
[1:18:03] we look at ourselves and we we see the
[1:18:06] the uh the stature of a perfect
[1:18:08] man it's our mirror and we see our face
[1:18:13] which stage we are in amen it's
[1:18:17] different some of us might be might be
[1:18:19] you know in a certain uh condition you
[1:18:22] might be sick or somebody seeking the
[1:18:24] family and then then you need healing
[1:18:26] from the Lord you just get virtue out of
[1:18:28] him amen all of us you know in a stature
[1:18:31] of a perfect man you know it's it's we
[1:18:34] sometimes we Face different step steps
[1:18:39] at the same time amen maybe some are you
[1:18:43] know uh fighting for their
[1:18:48] patience amen others with their
[1:18:51] temper others brotherly
[1:18:54] kindness
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:58] hallelujah I remember one one sister
[1:19:01] approached his her pastor and he said
[1:19:04] pastor can you pray for me yeah what do
[1:19:07] you want me to pray for
[1:19:09] you oh Pastor I I need this
[1:19:13] virtue that patience will be developed
[1:19:17] in me amen you know I see these children
[1:19:21] running around and playing something
[1:19:24] it's just get me out of myself and lose
[1:19:27] my patience amen and and so the the
[1:19:31] Pastor said okay let's
[1:19:33] pray so while they were praying the
[1:19:38] Pastor said okay Lord here is my
[1:19:41] precious
[1:19:42] sister she's Desiring to have that
[1:19:45] virtue of
[1:19:47] patience and so Lord I pray that as she
[1:19:53] desired is I know you're going to give
[1:19:55] her desire so I pray that give him
[1:19:58] problems
[1:20:00] Lord give her
[1:20:03] trials and if you permit sickness may
[1:20:07] come on her
[1:20:11] way this is hey Pastor wait a minute
[1:20:14] wait a
[1:20:16] minute I'm I'm Desiring
[1:20:19] patience why you're praying for all
[1:20:21] these things to come my way way and and
[1:20:24] the Pastor said close your eyes you're
[1:20:26] losing patience
[1:20:34] again sometimes we're not aware of what
[1:20:37] we're asking for amen because all those
[1:20:40] virtues require certain
[1:20:42] challenges amen these things are being
[1:20:45] developed amen based on the
[1:20:48] need hallelujah amen thank you Lord
[1:20:52] don't lose your
[1:20:54] patience so amen so you know that when
[1:20:57] you approach your pastor amen you're
[1:21:00] asking for patience you know what your
[1:21:02] pastor will pray for you amen hallelujah
[1:21:05] but you see all these things will come
[1:21:08] because we need to go to a certain
[1:21:12] process we need to go to a certain
[1:21:15] process so if if we stop in the Book of
[1:21:19] Ezekiel and don't go Mo move forward to
[1:21:22] the book of re Revelation then we have
[1:21:24] this thought of the sequence that it
[1:21:26] seems that there's
[1:21:27] something there some something wrong
[1:21:30] along the way amen but this the the
[1:21:33] thing is Ezekiel said this Beast keep on
[1:21:37] moving
[1:21:42] forward amen not backward Christians
[1:21:46] brother Bram said don't look backward
[1:21:49] amen because when we look always on the
[1:21:51] rear view mirror there will be a rock
[1:21:54] wreck along the way amen so that's the
[1:21:56] secret amen so all these Visions all
[1:22:00] this Pro prophecy will come to pass amen
[1:22:04] and it is not our problem it is God's
[1:22:07] problem amen it is God's you know
[1:22:09] because God is absolute what we have to
[1:22:12] do is just to keep moving on Amen
[1:22:17] so sometimes you know in the Philippines
[1:22:20] there are so you know Min uh uh some
[1:22:23] Ministries that are so excited you know
[1:22:25] when when we when we talk of the
[1:22:26] prophecy and who is not when we talk
[1:22:27] about prophecy that are being fulfilled
[1:22:29] around us we get excited because that is
[1:22:32] a proof that this message is actually
[1:22:35] Vindicated by the Lord amen and so
[1:22:39] that's why uh I remember when
[1:22:43] when when Obama was the president of the
[1:22:46] United States and there's there's so
[1:22:50] much you know going around in the
[1:22:51] Philippines maybe in some other
[1:22:53] countries as well because Obama you know
[1:22:56] he had a a a Muslim background and I
[1:22:59] knew it because I uh I go to uh to
[1:23:02] Indonesia many times actually in 2007
[1:23:06] That was supposed to be my first time to
[1:23:08] come into to Canada with brother Vernon
[1:23:10] brother Ed bcal wanted both of us to
[1:23:13] represent the Philippines in the 2007
[1:23:16] witness witness 2007 amen but at that
[1:23:20] time I was so active in Indonesia so I
[1:23:22] knew it was true because the Indonesian
[1:23:25] Believers pointed me to the school where
[1:23:27] Obama studied when he when he was uh in
[1:23:31] the
[1:23:32] elementary okay so so the so continuing
[1:23:37] and said so there there there there's
[1:23:39] some preachings amen sermons going
[1:23:41] around amen that we will not last long
[1:23:44] because uh you see Obama they type Obama
[1:23:48] to pharaoh to the king who knew not
[1:23:51] Joseph
[1:23:54] and it's good to hear amen and who would
[1:23:57] not amen so so and then so that's why he
[1:24:02] said uh during the time of Obama amen
[1:24:05] and then uh uh prior to that you see uh
[1:24:10] it was George Bush amen and P to Obama
[1:24:15] then here's come here comes George buo
[1:24:17] and said oh amen and that that that was
[1:24:21] the World Trade Center
[1:24:23] amen the the 911 amen and uh uh George
[1:24:27] Bush amen was so mad and he attacked
[1:24:31] Afghanistan and you know they they they
[1:24:33] Wag war and everything and so they
[1:24:36] there's another he said this is prophecy
[1:24:38] being fulfilled because it's like uh uh
[1:24:41] uh it's like Moses he was in the burning
[1:24:45] bush because
[1:24:48] Bush wiar and he is the burning bush
[1:24:54] see is the end and then comes Obama and
[1:24:57] then this is the is now rise a king
[1:25:01] Rises Amen in America who knew not
[1:25:05] Joseph amen he he knew not brother
[1:25:07] Brenham amen and then afterwards after
[1:25:10] Obama Here Comes you know Hillary
[1:25:12] Clinton amen and then Donald Trump amen
[1:25:15] so you see both will fulfill the
[1:25:18] scripture if Hillary Clinton will be he
[1:25:21] will be she will be the the the one one
[1:25:24] president and this is another
[1:25:25] fulfillment of the prophecy amen but
[1:25:28] Hill Hillary Clinton lost and it was
[1:25:32] Trump and yet they still said oh this
[1:25:34] must be the last
[1:25:44] Trump amen
[1:25:47] but Trump lost the
[1:25:50] election amen and they say Amen oh it's
[1:25:53] not the the White House don't doesn't
[1:25:56] belong to Trump it's
[1:26:07] forbidden so they don't run out of
[1:26:10] things they they're pulling things and I
[1:26:14] what I see is that they are forcing the
[1:26:17] prophecy to be
[1:26:20] fulfilled amen it's not ours to force
[1:26:24] the the the prophecy to be fulfilled our
[1:26:28] portion is just to keep moving on just
[1:26:31] keep living the life that this message
[1:26:34] produce amen so that God can say there
[1:26:38] is my bride amen hallelujah all these
[1:26:41] prophecies will just come after it will
[1:26:45] just be fulfilled within our
[1:26:47] midst Hallelujah and so now we see all
[1:26:51] all all the these things so it's just
[1:26:53] the secret prophecy number one God keeps
[1:26:56] his
[1:26:58] appointment just keep
[1:27:00] waiting amen it will not t god is never
[1:27:04] light God is never light amen so you
[1:27:08] just keep moving and and and and and and
[1:27:10] and God will fulfill his word and so
[1:27:12] another statement here now you must not
[1:27:14] misinterpret the word well I believe it
[1:27:17] means this it means just what it says it
[1:27:20] needs no interpreter
[1:27:23] and you must not misplace the word and
[1:27:26] you must not dislocate the word and if
[1:27:30] we would do either of this it throws the
[1:27:32] whole Bible in a confusion and in a
[1:27:35] chaos amen we don't do that because
[1:27:39] brother bham said if we misplace things
[1:27:43] amen although it is a portion of the
[1:27:45] Scripture it is a good statement of the
[1:27:48] Prophet but when it is me being
[1:27:50] misplaced and mislocated we are
[1:27:54] presenting a different picture just like
[1:27:56] brother brandham said you know just like
[1:27:58] a complete uh uh uh uh pieces and then
[1:28:03] you you you past it and then you see a
[1:28:05] cow eating grass or or or you see a cow
[1:28:08] on top of the tree amen which is not the
[1:28:11] right picture amen so it must be the
[1:28:15] Holy Spirit brother bam said you have to
[1:28:17] have the Holy Spirit to put it
[1:28:21] together amen and we say that this is it
[1:28:26] we say Amen this is it amen but we don't
[1:28:29] have to force the
[1:28:30] prophecy amen it must be the Holy Spirit
[1:28:33] placing the
[1:28:36] prophecy and we are just stepping into
[1:28:40] the prophecy being fulfilled hallelujah
[1:28:44] we're doing we're moving forward to
[1:28:46] accomplish what has been alloted to
[1:28:49] us amen thank you Lord
[1:28:53] so that's why brother mam make mention
[1:28:55] of this jigo pule being you know we
[1:28:58] should place them in their proper order
[1:29:01] proper placees to give us the right
[1:29:03] presentation the uh uh the picture amen
[1:29:07] uh brother bam you know you're very much
[1:29:10] familiar with this they went to hunting
[1:29:13] amen and he saw a vision and he said I
[1:29:16] saw I saw he said uh brother Eddie he
[1:29:19] said was along when the lord gave me the
[1:29:21] vision of about the bear and the Caribou
[1:29:24] amen and he said how many remembers when
[1:29:26] I told you all right he was there he was
[1:29:28] the young fellow referring to brother
[1:29:30] Eddie Bisal had an on the checkered
[1:29:33] shirt brother Eddie Bisal and he stood
[1:29:36] there and I asked I asked them if they
[1:29:39] had a checkered shirt any of them no no
[1:29:44] one had it I said well it might it's got
[1:29:46] to be a checkered shirt there going to
[1:29:48] be a big Silver Tip grizzly and some
[1:29:52] kind of an animal that's got 42 inches
[1:29:54] over its horn like this look like a deer
[1:29:57] so you see all the pieces amen a man
[1:30:01] with a a a a checkered
[1:30:05] shirt and a a a caribou a a uh Silver
[1:30:11] Tip Grizzly amen and the horn with 42
[1:30:15] Ines so all these things have seen by
[1:30:19] the prophet and he knew it was a Vision
[1:30:22] you know in these simple things you know
[1:30:24] it's just you say it's just a hunting
[1:30:26] trip and why why the prophet would would
[1:30:29] say and testify something like that
[1:30:31] because you know we should be
[1:30:32] appreciative of what the Lord is doing
[1:30:34] for us it might be little it might be
[1:30:37] something that you might think it's not
[1:30:38] scriptural you go hunting and so forth
[1:30:40] and so on but with the little
[1:30:43] things we appreciate what the Lord is
[1:30:45] doing in our lives amen so but God has a
[1:30:50] purpose in doing these things because he
[1:30:52] is testing his Prophet now Paul said I
[1:30:56] was not disobedient to the hly vision
[1:30:59] and I believe is the same thing with the
[1:31:00] prophet of God in this generation he
[1:31:02] never at one time
[1:31:05] deviated from the heavenly vision that
[1:31:07] the Lord has given him so now in this
[1:31:11] situation no one was
[1:31:15] wearing the checkered
[1:31:20] shirt but look when the vision was about
[1:31:25] to be
[1:31:26] fulfilled amen there were Temptation
[1:31:29] along the
[1:31:31] way uh uh
[1:31:35] uh brother Benham and his guide I think
[1:31:39] the uh uh B said he said now you see
[1:31:44] they they saw the grizzly
[1:31:48] bear
[1:31:49] and his company was so afraid because
[1:31:54] the rifle was not
[1:31:56] designed amen and I said now brother bam
[1:32:01] you shoot him while well he's not
[1:32:02] looking at us because they saw the back
[1:32:04] of the grizzly bear it's huge amen but
[1:32:08] brother Benham said wait because in the
[1:32:11] vision I shoot him in the
[1:32:14] heart so he must be
[1:32:16] facing and that's kind
[1:32:20] of frightful
[1:32:22] amen and that huge and you know as it
[1:32:26] was approaching them and brother Brenham
[1:32:28] was so accurate in that vision and he
[1:32:31] had confidence because he saw it in a
[1:32:34] vision he shoot it in the heart amen and
[1:32:39] so he
[1:32:40] waited for that for a certain
[1:32:44] distance before he pulled the trigger
[1:32:48] amen and then suddenly there's no they
[1:32:50] look around and uh they saw nothing amen
[1:32:54] until until uh uh that Beast came out
[1:32:58] and and you know what the rest of the
[1:32:59] story when uh when when they get it and
[1:33:02] checked it even the horn which is 42
[1:33:06] in is
[1:33:09] exactly as it was shown in the vision
[1:33:13] even even the small hand like a hand of
[1:33:15] a child it was just right there proving
[1:33:19] that it
[1:33:20] was the Lord showing him amen and not
[1:33:25] only that Amen brother Ed Bisal was not
[1:33:28] wearing a checkered shirt he never knew
[1:33:31] amen but his wife amen put that
[1:33:34] checkered shirt without brother the
[1:33:37] Bisal knowing it amen and then brother
[1:33:41] brother Ed Bisal was wearing another
[1:33:43] shirt and then he stumbled his leid and
[1:33:47] he gets wet and
[1:33:50] dirty amen and now he has to
[1:33:53] chains amen now when he has to chains he
[1:33:56] open his bag and there is the SEC shirt
[1:34:00] so who is orchestrating all these things
[1:34:03] amen so what so brother bham was not
[1:34:05] influenced by somebody who was afraid
[1:34:08] amen because of the attack of that gasly
[1:34:11] bear amen but brother Brenham was just
[1:34:14] faithful in what the Lord has shown him
[1:34:17] he was
[1:34:18] waiting amen the way it was being shown
[1:34:21] to him there must be something like that
[1:34:24] I shot the bear amen the greasely bear
[1:34:26] in The Heart amen that that means he was
[1:34:29] not I did not shoot him at the back amen
[1:34:32] at a certain distance and then there's a
[1:34:35] man that that is wearing a a a checkered
[1:34:38] shirt when it was completed what did the
[1:34:41] the the prophet of God do amen he just
[1:34:44] moved forward he waited until the vision
[1:34:49] is completed amen now he become
[1:34:53] everybody was part of the vision and who
[1:34:56] is orchestrating it's
[1:35:00] God Amen Hallelujah the vision will come
[1:35:04] to pass it will not t amen it will
[1:35:07] happen in God's appointed time amen your
[1:35:11] prayers may be your vision amen you may
[1:35:15] not be literally seeing Vision but look
[1:35:18] but when your prayers become your vision
[1:35:21] you hold on to it amen and it's God
[1:35:24] inspiring you to claim what you are
[1:35:26] praying for one day when you keep moving
[1:35:30] you will step one day and your prayer
[1:35:33] becomes your vision and your vision you
[1:35:35] step into that and it becomes a reality
[1:35:39] hallelujah amen hallelujah we're not
[1:35:41] challenging God we just believe
[1:35:45] God amen amen God showed brother benam a
[1:35:50] vision because there was a woman who
[1:35:54] said the right
[1:35:55] thing is said ha right and he is
[1:36:01] right amen so B seen the vision that God
[1:36:05] was so pleased with this woman that that

[1:36:12] placed his word upon this
[1:36:15] woman and and the spirit said tell that
[1:36:19] woman whatever she said says whatever
[1:36:22] she asks for it will come to pass

[1:38:37] you know he was expecting bundles of
[1:38:38] dollars just to fall between
[1:38:41] them
[1:38:43] because the same voice that spoke to
[1:38:47] brother Brenham where do you want those
[1:38:50] squirrels
[1:38:52] it's the same voice amen that throws
[1:38:55] that little bitty

[1:39:08] that right it's the same
[1:39:11] voice but you

[1:40:06] going to say this is it thank God I
[1:40:09] moved
[1:40:10] forward and God plac everything amen
[1:40:14] hallelujah so so in those simple things
[1:40:17] so you see
[1:40:19] now uh even
[1:40:21] in the the in the bridge between the
[1:40:23] seven Church ages and the Seven Seals
[1:40:25] said it's a mysterious book it's a book
[1:40:27] of redemption well get into that and now
[1:40:30] we know that this book of redemption
[1:40:32] will not be totally understood it's
[1:40:36] proved that through six Church ages but
[1:40:38] at the end amen when the seventh angel
[1:40:42] begins to sound his mystery he winds up
[1:40:46] all the Loose Ends that these fellows
[1:40:49] probed at and the Mysteries comes down
[1:40:52] from God as the word of God and reveals
[1:40:55] the entire revelation of God then the
[1:40:58] goded and everything else is settled all
[1:41:00] the Mysteries s serpent seed and
[1:41:03] whatever more is to be revealed amen
[1:41:06] ding all the Loose Ends amen all the
[1:41:09] previous Messengers amen they spoke what
[1:41:13] the Lord says amen what the spirit amen
[1:41:17] says in their churches in their ages
[1:41:20] amen just speak the message that the
[1:41:22] Lord has placed in their hearts amen but
[1:41:26] you know when the in the end when the
[1:41:31] seventh angel comes he tie all these
[1:41:34] Loose
[1:41:35] Ends it seems like you know Martin
[1:41:38] Luther still preach Trinity
[1:41:40] Doctrine amen how could you consider a
[1:41:43] messenger still drinking
[1:41:46] wine is it in order in the standard that
[1:41:50] we have right now
[1:41:51] Amen brother brandham said Trinity
[1:41:53] Trinity is of the
[1:41:55] devil it's out of place when you when
[1:41:58] you use when you gauge Martin Luther in
[1:42:02] the statement of the Prophet this day
[1:42:04] Martin Luther and his people will be
[1:42:06] disqualified amen but we need to see
[1:42:11] amen that's
[1:42:12] why the the the Lord was being shown in
[1:42:16] that Vision he was walking in the midst
[1:42:20] of the the seven golden
[1:42:22] candlesticks fulfilling his word that
[1:42:25] I'm not going to leave you nor forsake
[1:42:28] you until the time of the
[1:42:31] end so we always look to the End Amen we
[1:42:35] always look to the conclusion of the
[1:42:38] matter amen because if we look back we
[1:42:41] cannot fit the previous messages to our
[1:42:45] generation today amen but thank God we
[1:42:49] continued on that's why we we need to
[1:42:51] walk in the light because he is in the
[1:42:54] light keep moving forward Hallelujah if
[1:42:58] God can do this in the church ages he
[1:43:01] can also do that to you individually he
[1:43:03] can do that to us or to our families he
[1:43:06] can do that to our churches just keep
[1:43:08] moving
[1:43:09] forward amen hallelujah and so now he
[1:43:13] said now you see I'm not making that up
[1:43:15] it's thus sayth the Lord I'll read it to
[1:43:17] you out of the book The sounding of the
[1:43:19] seventh angels's message the mystery of
[1:43:21] God should be finished that's been
[1:43:22] declared by his holy prophets that's the
[1:43:25] prophets who were wrote the word at the
[1:43:27] sounding of the seven Church age the
[1:43:29] last Church age all the Loose Ends that
[1:43:31] through this church ages have been
[1:43:33] probed out will be wounded up together
[1:43:36] and when the seals are broken and the
[1:43:38] Mystery is revealed down comes the angel
[1:43:41] the messenger Christ setting his foot
[1:43:43] upon the land and upon the sea with a
[1:43:45] rainbow over he said now remember this
[1:43:47] seventh angel is on the earth at the
[1:43:49] time of his coming and so forth and so
[1:43:51] on God is
[1:43:54] completing and we thank God we are part
[1:43:57] of its
[1:43:59] completion aren't you happy this morning
[1:44:02] you are part of God's completion you are
[1:44:05] part of the age conclusion yes
[1:44:10] amen hallelujah we just have to go
[1:44:14] through a certain
[1:44:16] process amen and you have to yield you
[1:44:19] have to abide
[1:44:21] with the process of justification
[1:44:24] sanctification baptism of the holy
[1:44:26] spirit amen and you know with all these
[1:44:29] things so we always look at the End Amen
[1:44:32] now remember he is the Alpha and the
[1:44:35] Omega amen he's the Alpha and the and
[1:44:38] the Omega now
[1:44:41] so we have to go through a certain
[1:44:44] process and let me just share you a a
[1:44:48] certain uh illustration that brother bam
[1:44:51] made mention this one time he said in an
[1:44:54] he said some time ago I was reading a
[1:44:56] little article where the Queen of
[1:44:58] England not this queen the other Queen
[1:45:00] she went to see a paper company that had
[1:45:02] been making such fine paper and when she
[1:45:05] was interviewed by the president of the
[1:45:07] company he taken her through she wanted
[1:45:10] to see how that fine paper was made he
[1:45:15] taken her and showed her all the great
[1:45:17] presses and things and in those days
[1:45:20] they made paper out of rugs we will
[1:45:22] remember that so he went into a room and
[1:45:25] opened the door and there was nothing
[1:45:27] but a bunch of rugs the queen in
[1:45:31] astonishment said what's these dirty
[1:45:35] things the man the president of the
[1:45:37] company said that was clothing
[1:45:41] yesterday it has become
[1:45:43] dirty we do not throw it away but it's
[1:45:47] the paper of Tomorrow amen
[1:45:51] amen she said I don't understand this
[1:45:55] the queen he said you'll understand it
[1:46:00] tomorrow so when they run these rugs
[1:46:02] through the Press through a certain
[1:46:04] process of cleansing and certain thing
[1:46:06] it had to go through a process when it
[1:46:09] come out it was beautiful sheets of
[1:46:11] paper the president thought he would
[1:46:14] show the queen something that she never
[1:46:15] knew he put her profile on it and
[1:46:19] pressed it into his beautiful paper when
[1:46:22] the queen receiv it she's in her own
[1:46:25] profile in what was dirty rugs
[1:46:29] yesterday because through a certain
[1:46:34] process if Luther Wesley and all of them
[1:46:37] could see that that yesterday's stuff
[1:46:40] can only be used as it goes through a
[1:46:42] process when the Holy Ghost reveals the
[1:46:46] light from justification to
[1:46:48] sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:46:50] Holy Ghost and now the last hour of the
[1:46:53] coming of Christ it's got in it the
[1:46:57] profile not of the queen but of the king
[1:47:00] of
[1:47:01] Heaven amen that represents himself as
[1:47:04] the chart has become closer into the
[1:47:07] minority like the ministry has to be the
[1:47:09] same kind of a Ministry that he had Amen

[1:47:15] dirty rags of yesterday that went
[1:47:18] through a certain process it did not
[1:47:21] stop up being dirty but he went it went
[1:47:24] through a certain process of cleansing
[1:47:27] in the end it become a clean shining
[1:47:31] white paper and look the
[1:47:35] Queen the Queen's profile was printed in
[1:47:39] that clean white shining paper you don't
[1:47:43] see any more the dirty rugs but you see

[1:51:02] Christian hallelujah amen because that's
[1:51:05] the only way we can reflect Christ
[1:51:08] Christ suffered not for
[1:51:11] his but for
[1:51:13] us so Christ amen because our faith is
[1:51:18] being perfected by
[1:51:22] trials Who Wants to Be
[1:51:26] Perfect amen so you know what that means
[1:51:30] when you want to be perfect expect
[1:51:33] trials amen so now as I said now God is
[1:51:37] an everpresent
[1:51:40] help okay because he is The Great I Am
[1:51:44] right he is
[1:51:46] present we may not feel him we may not
[1:51:50] see him in our literal eyes but God
[1:51:54] keeps his
[1:51:56] appointment he is true to his word am if
[1:52:00] the Bible said he is
[1:52:03] present he is
[1:52:06] here he is here amen so he comes he is
[1:52:13] present help in times of trouble amen
[1:52:17] and because of that we can we can
[1:52:19] understand the scripture when he says
[1:52:21] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:52:22] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:52:25] that was set before
[1:52:26] him the joy that set before him he
[1:52:31] endured the
[1:52:32] cross despising the shame and he sat
[1:52:35] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:52:36] God somebody asked me what was before
[1:52:40] him that made him that posted the reason
[1:52:44] for him to endure the cross and I said
[1:52:47] let us rephrase the question
[1:52:50] the right question is who is before him
[1:52:54] amen who is the
[1:52:56] joy that is before
[1:53:00] Christ than who is your joy brother
[1:53:03] Barry just re sitting beside you right
[1:53:07] she he she is your
[1:53:08] joy sister you are brother mervin's Joy
[1:53:14] amen so the bride is the joy of Christ
[1:53:20] so when you put yourself in this
[1:53:21] scripture looking unto Jesus the author
[1:53:23] and finishes of our faith who for the
[1:53:26] joy that was set before
[1:53:29] him endured the
[1:53:32] cross so it was not an easy thing for
[1:53:36] the Lord Jesus Christ to get the
[1:53:39] joy the
[1:53:41] bride there were certain things that he
[1:53:43] needed to
[1:53:45] endure even the cross he endured the the
[1:53:50] cross because it was placed between his
[1:53:58] Joy how can I how can I disappoint my
[1:54:03] bridegroom when I am his
[1:54:06] Joy when he endured
[1:54:10] everything to get me and bring joy to
[1:54:14] him amen hallelujah and so now amen and
[1:54:18] so he endured everything thing but
[1:54:20] there's something in between them amen
[1:54:23] so that's why he is Alpha and Omega he's
[1:54:26] the beginning and the end now it's
[1:54:29] always good amen we have faith to
[1:54:31] continue on because we know what will be
[1:54:33] the end all right because he already
[1:54:37] declared it is
[1:54:38] finished amen when you come to a game
[1:54:41] and the game is already
[1:54:45] fixed you know what what will be the
[1:54:47] come out what will come out after the
[1:54:50] game amen now Hallelujah now let me tell
[1:54:53] you this game this story is already
[1:54:57] fixed because Jeremiah declared already
[1:55:01] I will give you an expected
[1:55:05] End Amen so what is there to stop you
[1:55:09] what is there to discourage you you just
[1:55:11] have to keep going on you just have to
[1:55:15] keep moving forward so that we all make
[1:55:19] it to the end Hallelujah those who
[1:55:23] remain Until the
[1:55:25] End
[1:55:29] Amen Hallelujah don't stop serving the
[1:55:32] lord no matter
[1:55:34] what Hallelujah don't be
[1:55:37] sidetracked with everything that is
[1:55:39] going now is another thing he's the
[1:55:41] author and the finisher of our faith the
[1:55:44] author knows
[1:55:46] everything now I used to be a public
[1:55:48] school teacher teaching
[1:55:50] English in the school I teach literary
[1:55:52] how to write short story how to write
[1:55:55] you
[1:55:55] know and so I can teach you how to write
[1:55:59] a short story in five
[1:56:02] minutes okay because if you know the
[1:56:06] formula you can write something short
[1:56:09] story is just like this amen of course
[1:56:12] you have characters you have seen you
[1:56:14] have to develop the story from the the
[1:56:16] from the beginning to the end and so it
[1:56:18] must come to a certain
[1:56:20] Climax and then at the end you give a
[1:56:22] conclusion no matter what ending you
[1:56:24] want okay so in a love
[1:56:27] story okay number one two people meet
[1:56:31] probably it's Love at First s side and
[1:56:35] they know it's other amen and then
[1:56:38] challenge may come in between there
[1:56:40] should be a challenge now think of a
[1:56:42] challenge probably one will work abroad
[1:56:45] one will study abroad they will separate
[1:56:47] or there might be something a third
[1:56:49] party of somewhat or you know the
[1:56:51] challenge might be the woman is rich and
[1:56:53] the man is poor and so the parents is
[1:56:57] against their you see that's the
[1:57:00] challenge okay so the story will come to
[1:57:02] a certain climax amen that it that the
[1:57:06] the situation the relationship will come
[1:57:10] yes sir to an End Amen maybe they don't
[1:57:13] agree how they will finish the the trust
[1:57:17] in the
[1:57:18] renovation
[1:57:20] you know you come but that that comes to
[1:57:23] a climax amen but when it comes to a
[1:57:26] climax it cannot go higher than that
[1:57:28] after the climax it will go down and you
[1:57:31] choose how their relationship ends of
[1:57:33] course we want the story to have a good
[1:57:37] ending all right so that's how simple it
[1:57:40] is you just think of a problem amen and
[1:57:43] solve the problem and that's the End
[1:57:46] Amen so God is the author and the
[1:57:48] finisher of our faith amen we were part
[1:57:52] amen we were in him we were in his body
[1:57:55] uh uh Adam amen Eve was part of Adam
[1:58:00] amen and then God took one of the ribs
[1:58:03] of Adam and that was the woman amen here
[1:58:05] comes the serpent that's the problem
[1:58:08] that separated them that separated also
[1:58:11] them from God but God is the author and
[1:58:13] he is the finisher amen there will be
[1:58:15] challenges between them amen so he h uh
[1:58:19] uh the woman was deceived amen but
[1:58:21] because he was part when when the woman
[1:58:24] he she was dirty she was not deserving
[1:58:26] probably of Adam's love but because Adam
[1:58:31] was an expression was a a person perfect
[1:58:34] personification of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:37] amen when Adam when when when when when
[1:58:40] the woman went back to Adam and Adam was
[1:58:42] not sinful yet
[1:58:45] amen Adam could have said no stop right
[1:58:48] there right you are dirty you are being
[1:58:51] polluted thank you Lord amen you
[1:58:54] separated from my headship you have no
[1:58:56] part in me
[1:58:58] anymore amen I will allow God to kill
[1:59:03] you I still have many ribs
[1:59:11] here but Adam is a perfect reflection of
[1:59:16] Christ Hallelujah that the polluted
[1:59:21] physical situation of Il did not stop
[1:59:25] but his perfect love covered those
[1:59:29] multitudes of sins amen hallelujah it
[1:59:33] was a perfect realization of what will
[1:59:36] come in the end Hallelujah we were dirty
[1:59:39] rags of yesterday but God did not reject
[1:59:42] us because he's not complete without
[1:59:46] us amen hallelujah huah amen we were out
[1:59:51] of order we were out of place but God
[1:59:54] keep his side open for us to take our
[1:59:58] portion and be in
[2:00:01] there no one no one nobody can take your
[2:00:05] place in the
[2:00:07] church you are part of the body of
[2:00:10] Christ Hallelujah it shape its weight
[2:00:14] Hallelujah only belongs to you and no
[2:00:16] one can take your part and nobody and
[2:00:19] you cannot take some other's
[2:00:22] part you just have to keep on
[2:00:27] going amen thank you Lord wait for the
[2:00:32] conclusion amen because he is the author
[2:00:35] he
[2:00:38] knows we know him as Alpha and Omega
[2:00:42] right he's the beginning and the
[2:00:44] end but no let me tell you this morning
[2:00:49] that the Lord is not all only Alpha and
[2:00:53] Omega the god of beginning and the god
[2:00:55] of
[2:00:56] ending but he's the same God in
[2:01:01] between same God in
[2:01:04] between Joseph was well loved by his
[2:01:07] father that that Jacob you know that his
[2:01:12] father amen made amen a a a a clothing
[2:01:18] amen of many colors to separate him from
[2:01:22] his Brethren amen he was well- favored
[2:01:26] he was the favorite of his father and
[2:01:29] then we go at the end we see how
[2:01:34] Joseph was highly favored he became next
[2:01:38] to
[2:01:40] Pharaoh Egypt was blessed through
[2:01:43] Joseph nobody can go to Pharaoh without
[2:01:47] passing through Joseph yes if we look at
[2:01:50] this situation well favored highly
[2:01:52] favored by his
[2:01:54] father and highly favored by
[2:01:58] Pharaoh amen we we can
[2:02:02] say God bless Joseph so much but how
[2:02:06] about in
[2:02:12] between the true
[2:02:14] jealousy he was wounded he was he
[2:02:18] suffered a lot that's
[2:02:21] right don't look at God as just the
[2:02:24] Alpha and the
[2:02:26] Omega yes there is beginning of a story
[2:02:29] and there is ending of the
[2:02:32] story but the climax has to be
[2:02:36] developed but let me tell you in between
[2:02:38] no matter how hard it
[2:02:40] is is the same
[2:02:42] God he the same God he is
[2:02:47] present he is hearing your prayers
[2:02:51] amen he's placing the
[2:02:57] prophecy he's fulfilling your
[2:02:59] prayers one day you will step into it

[2:03:28] of job's
[2:03:31] life so blessed the greatest of all the
[2:03:35] men of the
[2:03:38] East so we read chapter one and we go at
[2:03:41] the end of the chapter chapter 42 so the
[2:03:46] Lord blessed the latter end of job more
[2:03:48] than his
[2:03:49] beginning

[2:04:13] beginning of his life more
[2:04:17] blessed beginning
[2:04:19] and
[2:04:21] ending what about in between tell
[2:04:28] me but during the
[2:04:31] time Amen in between the beginning and
[2:04:34] the end of job's life in between was God

[2:09:53] verse 18 judges 20 and the children of
[2:09:56] Israel arose and went up to the house of
[2:09:58] God and asked counsel of God and said
[2:10:01] which of us should shall go up first to
[2:10:03] the battle against the children of
[2:10:05] Benjamin and the Lord said Judah shall
[2:10:08] go up

[2:10:18] children of Israel and God had to deal
[2:10:22] them heal of his revolt and the children
[2:10:26] of Israel arose up in the morning and
[2:10:27] encamp against GI and the men of Israel
[2:10:30] went out to battle against Benjamin and
[2:10:32] the men of Israel put themselves in
[2:10:33] Array they put themselves in order to
[2:10:37] fight against them at GI you know we
[2:10:39] cannot we cannot fight the devil in this
[2:10:43] array that's right
[2:10:45] amen and the children of Benjamin came
[2:10:48] forth out of GI and destroyed down to
[2:10:51] the ground of the Israelites that day 20
[2:10:53] and 2,000 men and the people the men of
[2:10:56] Israel encouraged themselves and set
[2:10:59] their battle again in array in the place
[2:11:02] where they put themselves in Array the
[2:11:03] first
[2:11:05] day
[2:11:07] listen they did the right
[2:11:09] thing before going to war they went to
[2:11:13] the temple
[2:11:14] prayed and seek counsel from the Lord
[2:11:18] Lord should we fight the
[2:11:23] battle the Lord said fight Lord what
[2:11:26] should be the arrangement the order of

[2:11:45] Judah the worshippers in the Forefront
[2:11:48] of of the
[2:11:48] battle amen that's the order of the Lord

[2:12:27] of the battle you go to the battle with
[2:12:30] such a confidence that you can win it
[2:12:34] but in day one 22,000 men fall
[2:12:39] dead that means thousands of women were
[2:12:42] left without a
[2:12:44] husband children without a father
[2:12:51] sisters who left without a brother
[2:12:54] thousands of them after
[2:12:58] obeying the instruction of the Lord they
[2:13:01] did the right thing and yet they had so
[2:13:05] much
[2:13:09] casualties and in verse 30 other the
[2:13:11] children of Israel went up and wept
[2:13:13] before the Lord until even and asked
[2:13:14] counsel of the Lord for the second time
[2:13:16] saying shall I go up again to battle
[2:13:18] against the children of Benjamin my
[2:13:20] brother and the Lord said go up against

[2:13:33] children of Israel again 18,000 men all
[2:13:38] this through the
[2:13:40] sword
[2:13:42] how how would we
[2:13:45] react that after we listen to the
[2:13:47] council of the
[2:13:49] Lord following his
[2:13:51] instruction losing 20,000 day one and
[2:13:55] then another
[2:13:57] 18,000 on the second
[2:14:02] day did they
[2:14:04] doubt did they doubt the Lord after all
[2:14:08] these
[2:14:09] casualties on the third day and he said
[2:14:12] and the children came near again oh

[2:14:51] went up and came unto the house of God
[2:14:52] and wept and sat there before the Lord
[2:14:55] and fasted that day until even and
[2:14:57] offered burnt offerings and peace
[2:14:59] offerings before the Lord and the

[2:15:02] for the Ark of the Covenant of God was
[2:15:04] there in those days and pineas the son

[2:22:15] thing you know the scripture said that I
[2:22:18] hath not seen nor hath ear heard neither
[2:22:21] has it even entered into the heart of a
[2:22:23] man what lies in
[2:22:25] store but yet in our day we had a
[2:22:27] prophet that he was
[2:22:30] invited would you like to see beyond the
[2:22:32] curtain of
[2:22:34] time and he said it would help me so
[2:22:37] much he was broken in his Spirit he was
[2:22:41] down he wondered if he had done any good
[2:22:44] in this
[2:22:45] life he didn't know it at the
[2:22:49] time but when we went over and he tells
[2:22:52] the vision he tells the story about it
[2:22:55] the last thing that he heard that voice
[2:22:57] say to him those people on the other
[2:23:00] side say to him was just keep pressing
[2:23:03] on I just can't help but think that's
[2:23:05] what we heard this morning brothers and
[2:23:07] sisters forget about all of the junk
[2:23:10] push aside all of the problems and
[2:23:12] circumstances the distractions of the
[2:23:15] devil just keep pressing
[2:23:19] on we're so close to that finish line
[2:23:22] and whether we go by the way of the
[2:23:24] Grave or by the way of the sky we're his
[2:23:27] we have nothing to
[2:23:30] fear I just am so thankful for the word
[2:23:32] of God so thankful for the the ministry
[2:23:36] of our brother taking the time to come
[2:23:38] by our way to just yield himself before
[2:23:42] the
[2:23:43] Lord let's just remember brother oh my
[2:23:47] brother Daniel and his family and his
[2:23:50] church in prayers and not with an emoji
[2:23:53] as we heard last night not with just an
[2:23:55] emoji and a text message but with that
[2:23:58] we spot on our floor from our prayers we
[2:24:02] know that brother bradam said the true
[2:24:03] sign of a man isn't the muscles in his
[2:24:05] body or the health that he has it's
[2:24:08] truly the bags in his knees from his
[2:24:10] time in
[2:24:12] prayer let's just go to him in prayer
