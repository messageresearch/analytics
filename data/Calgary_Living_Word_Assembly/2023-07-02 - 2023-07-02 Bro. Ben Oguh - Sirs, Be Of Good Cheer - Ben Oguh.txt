congregation father we're so thankful for your tender hand of Mercy in our lives Lord father this morning we just want to continue thanking you for your word Lord we know that we could see many signs or wonders father but we know your Prophet said rather you said through your Prophet the greatest Miracle ever done on Earth is that a man could recognize in his sinful nature that he has been called before the foundation of the world to full adoption Lord that we could become a new creature that we could have our minds renewed according to your word father not that we would conform to this world father but that we would be transformed father oh Father into your very image and Lord Jesus this morning we thank you for each each one represented here father we know we have many visitors with us oh Father some from Saskatchewan some from all around some from Lethbridge Lord we pray that you would just bless each one accordingly father and Lord feed your children today we ask father we thank you for your servant who's in the back lord we know that he's been laboring father that you put a burden on his heart father and we know that you have something to say to us today through our dear brother Ben and father we pray that Lord as we often ask for Lord Jesus a fresh call Off The Altar for the minister Lord give us Hearts to receive that word today Father Lord Jesus let us not be trying to filter it through the filter of a man oh but Lord Jesus let us have a thinking man's filter and let us run it through the filter of your word Lord Jesus when we hear the word we'll say Amen father we love you we thank you we pray that you would just pour out your spirit Upon Us in great measure today Father once again careful to give you all the praise and all the glory in Jesus Christ made me pray amen just want to welcome all the visitors I know we have a family here from Saskatchewan I understand I don't think I know your names I apologize we'll certainly get acquainted after service we have brother brother Lewis and sister Diane and their children here with us sister Mary's daughter and her husband and kids God bless you welcome [Applause] and we have sister Susan from Cameroon I believe I choke your hat shook your hat in the parking lot sister God bless you [Applause] just come with brother Gabriel and his wife sister Sabina and brother Paul from Lethbridge this morning [Applause] certainly in an effort to travel that kind of distance to be in service so I trust the Lord richly blesses you now as we uh we prepare to move forward we just have a couple of announcements I wanted to make we have the special meetings that we've been invited to at the end time message Tabernacle July 27th to 30th I believe it'll be a wonderful time of fellowship and uh just feeding at the table of the lord we have brother Ron Spencer will be coming and I believe Brother Ray Erickson or brother Nathan Erickson will be there as well so it would be a wonderful time just to fellowship with the Saints it's always a good time to get together with the bride of Jesus Christ and so that's July 27th to 30th if you need more any more information by all means just reach out or you can even look at the end time message Tabernacle website and we'll have it there as well one last thing I want to mention is that we had requested a little while ago if anybody has the desire in their heart to serve in the body of Christ here in Calgary to put their name forward and we had two names come forward uh one brother said that he would he would do whatever he we needed help with in the body and we're still working on that and one of the other brothers said that he wanted to position himself in the office of a deacon and so I had said that's a wonderful desire according to the word of God we certainly need another Deacon in our body brother Phil mcgowby he was a deacon until he decided to move and so we have a hole that he has left so Brother Don snow has put his name forward for the office of a deacon and so we've prayed about this for many months it's not a new discussion and we've talked it over with the deacons and everyone is in uh in one mind about it that it would be a good thing for the body here so I just want to read in the scripture First Timothy chapter 3 verse 8. you don't have to turn there just for time's sake I don't want to take too much time here but it says likewise must deacons be grave not double tongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy looker holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses well for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus but I believe I have witnessed as I'm sure many others if not everyone has seen these attributes in our brother Don and we know that this is not something that's taken lightly the deacons are to assist the pastor and everybody in the body when there's a need so we're certainly uh we're certainly excited to see someone put their name forward it's a it's a major step and it's an obligation and you know brother Branham says it that God will hold us accountable for those positions that we put ourselves in so we certainly want to thank Brother Don and sister Rebecca because it's not just a a one-person thing even the word of God says it's about the man and the wife and uh we're certainly thankful for a body of Believers people who are willing to put their lives ahead of others to serve the body so what we've determined is we will we will initiate this office with Brother Don for six months and uh after the six months we'll actually take a vote with the regular votes for the church which will likely be in February of next year so early in the year we will take a vote to verify that he feels good in the office of a deacon and that the body of Christ here in Calgary receives him in the office so please take the time to shake brother Don's hand and just encourage him as he steps out by faith and without any further delay I would like to call on brother Ben if we could just sing this song again Almighty infinite father as we invite our brother to come and just take his Liberty know how it goes the way it works is when he comes up here we can just go with his notes and the thoughts that he has in his mind as a human or we can say Amen to the word and we can pull on the word and we can have God discern the needs in our very midst right at every one of our lives in every one of our homes and every one of our hearts take our brother right off of his notes where he'll say I don't even know where that came from then he'll remember right away oh oh [Music] foreign thank you thank you [Music] shall we pray as we bow our head with our humidity [Music] their lord Jesus Christ the almighty God before you humbly this morning to worship you to express our love before you thank you for your sons and daughters gathered here Lord thank you for the worship Lord I'll be rendered maybe acceptable unto you in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you for giving us life to see another day before Sunday of this second half of the year we thank you for the six months that have gone by indeed You Can Count our blessings and see what you have done for us we are thankful we bless Thy Name Lord Jesus we have gathered this morning unto you not unto any man or to any system but unto you our God who is the author of our life we therefore look unto you for that which you have for all this morning father you know the thoughts of every heart you know all the needs here represented Lord Jesus I pray that you look upon her with Mercy Lord may you meet the need of every heart somehow some way physically spiritually whatever it is May you say something Lord that law will meet our needs we are needy people and we love you in our hearts have mercy upon us Lord I need my members unto you for service have your way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord I want to thank the pastor for the opportunity oh God bless the report it's been a long way I'm glad to see you I I want to appreciate your pastor for giving me this opportunity to come here to fellowship with the brethren um to me it is a privilege and I believe there's a reason for everything and I trust that God will help me this morning I also I want to thank every one of you once again for Your Love towards my family I've rapita John said silver and gold we don't have was such as I have I give unto you I pray that God will use me to give something to you this morning in appreciation of Your Love towards my family I'm not such a good preacher but I love the Lord and I always like to talk about him especially in the midst of the brethren so please bear with me and I trust the Lord will bless us I know we are standing I want us to read from the scripture before you see that let's quickly turn our Bibles to ask the book of Acts chapter 27. reading from Verse 18 to verse 25 Acts acts 27 verse 18. oh are we being exceedingly tasked with agree with a tempest the next day the Latin the ship and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship and when neither son no stars in many days appeared and no small temples lay on us our hope that we should be saved was taken away but after a long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sounds we should have hearkened unto me and not have lose from crit and to have gained this harm and loss and now I exalt you to be of Gucci foreign of any man's life among you bought the ship for they are stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am are whom I serve saying fear no Paul that must be brought before Caesar and Lord God are giving thee all them that say with thee we are forces be of Gucci for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me may the Lord Jesus add His blessings to read of his word God bless you every seated praise he the Lord once again I welcome us back to church this morning I quickly want to go through this someone amen [Music] the password last Sunday told me to preach today whatever the Lord puts in my mind and that is why I'm here and this is what you put in my mind well however on the on on Wednesday he started the preaching so I want to continue from where I stopped blessed be the neighborhood amen we are living in such a a dangerous world the world we live in is filled with crisis uncertainties problems everywhere uh but the people of the world don't seem to know that they are in trouble we talk about Dark Ages to me I don't think there's any age that is as dark as a solution Church age if you remember the you know discuss that the prophet Drew about the ages the darkest of the old ages acceleration Church age but it doesn't seem so and that is where the problem lies that is why the deceit lies and that is where we have to be very very careful the people are in problem but they don't know the Bible said that they are poor they are blind they are miserable but they don't know but thanks be to God that has another set of people upon the face of the Earth that knows the condition of the age and I pray that God will help us so this morning I I want to tell you to be a gutier amen in in in John I think John 16 that the Lord spoke to the disciples as a popular scripture John 16 let me quickly read it I think for 32 he said uh behold they are coming yeah it's not come that you shall be scattered every man to his own I shall leave me alone and yet I'm not alone because the father is with me these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace is only in Christ that we can have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be a good chair I have overcome the world blessed be the name of the Lord so I want to accept you all this morning no matter the trouble we are going through as we assisted here I know we have challenges if you have it could be Financial or whatever it is I want to tell you that it should be a good year somebody has overcome for us amen he came after us he overcame and has given the victory unto us and because he came and overcame that is why we should be of good cheer it's not because of fears are happening if you look at this thing that happened it is hopeless miserable if you think about the conditions of the world well brethren we should be a good chair because Jesus went ahead of us overcome for us blessed be the name of the Lord this morning I'm not going to talk about heaven you know we talk so much about heaven I'm not going to talk about heaven this morning because that's no need to talk about heaven Heaven is a prepared place for a prepared people Heaven is a place that God has made for his children and if a child of God you will be in heaven because you have no place in hell there's no space for your health your place is heaven so if you are saved fill the Holy Ghost you are going to heaven so that is not a problem go to heaven is not a problem the problem is the space between here and Heaven and if you notice in the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ he spoke more about this face you know in heaven there's no Satan in heaven no sickness no trouble no trust no temptation it's just rest but here that's where the problem is he wants to talk about the present time that is what the problem is the Bible said I think it is I can't remember now uh somewhere and I said my people perish for lack of knowledge and the knowledge is the work of God and the way we need to apply the word of God now for our lives here we are this morning he left her home you left your businesses you left everything and you you you just you got out here why why are you here where are we seated what is he needs for us do you know someone other questions sometime in the scriptures I think it was Peter he said Lord we have left our houses we left everything I follow you so what is the news for us I thought it's good we did we did that let me if I can quickly get it now uh I think it was better said in in Mark The Book of Mark that means if I can get it now he said what is in it for us Mark 10 somewhere there uh Mark 10 Mark 10 I think 28. the Peter began to say unto his law we have left all I have followed thee but I'm actually put in a better way especially ask what is the need there for us and Jesus answered and said verily I said unto you there's no man as I have left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or Lance for my sake at the Gospels listen but he shall receive a hundred fold now in this time are you following me now now now houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecution and in the world to come eternal life did you get your graduate so there is something for us they are now there is a privilege that's that's something for the source and Daughters of God right now sometimes we believe us we shy away from our challenges and we need to face it here we are this morning people from different parts of the world my brothers from Africa Africa is far from Canada yeah I don't think they are here because of to see the snow I don't think so I I think they are here to make a living maybe in a better environment is that true that is true that is the truth money uh but we shy away from it we don't have to talk about it sometimes we fight difficult God please give me money it's just maybe it's a worldly thing it's sinful but we live off because of that we go to work because of that sometimes we live service because of that it is the truth well that is a right way to approach it there's a way God has made for the source and for his sons and daughters to approach it amen I don't care what you are going through this morning whether you are sick or you have some challenges Financial whatever God has made a way for you [Music] the problem is to follow God's provided way and that is what we want to look at this morning here let's talk a little bit about brother Paul before we move on but our Paul was in that ship in that ship he represented the kingdom of God two kingdoms were represented in that ship the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil there are just two kingdoms he had a kingdom of Satan the kingdom of the prince of this world and then he had the kingdom of God you are working for one of those two kingdoms consciously unconsciously whatever we do in life you are doing for one or two or two kingdoms I will must remember that we as Sons and Daughters of God and God put us here to work for his kingdom no matter what comes amen and the kingdom will work for influences Us in all that we do now if you read this scripture carefully for the beginning of chapter 27 but Paul won them that look this journey is not going to be saved let us stop here but the people he was a prisoner I hope you remember that he was a prisoner and he appealed his case to to Caesar they were taking it to Rome but the journey between where he was at room was very rough they almost lost everything for lack of knowledge they almost perish for lack of knowledge what was the knowledge report to them you will have listened to me but Paul because it came from his part of that Kingdom the kingdom of God look in the kingdom of God if a member of that Kingdom you have certain privileges you have access to the almighty God we don't have all that is all that is God in us but the little portion of God we have in US is directly connected to all of God in other words at any point in time that we have a need that little portion will have in us we connect to God and provide that need being part of that Kingdom warned them that we should not proceed but they did not listen to him because uh he was a prisoner I mean they saw him they looked at him as an ordinary man say this guy and also they were deceived if he followed the reading if you look at the reading they were deceived if you look at um verse 13 He said I went the sad wind blew Softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose losing theirs they sailed close to Great you know that was the software that came they said oh the weather is okay they don't mind this man you know he's a fanatic that's what she's talking about but I learned the line the problem came it is not the beginning it is the end that matters sometimes the beginning can be deceitful in everything it could be rough and you want to quit you know many people some people have left this message I'm sure we all know that even they took it to a point they said to speak a bad thing they don't know about you know the reason why they are leaving the message is because they don't have what it takes to live for the message and they want the privileges in the message they read through the sermon books and see the signs and wonders that God did through a servant and they want to put into practice but it's not working it's all this thing is all working we are just wasting our time but they don't live the life of the message [Music] they want to get the benefit of the message without living the life of the message it's not possible you cannot separate the two brother Paul he was able to have that privilege because something happened to him I think it's better we're talking about that it was not always like that that was a time but Paul persecuted that way if we truly it's a book of Acts chapter 9 I believe sorry I I like to read scripture just bear with me it's just I I think the word of God will start my own words we failed but the word of God will never fail because there's a secret behind uh Rapport that's a secret what happened to him oh it's going to be a Landing reading let me just read it I'll be fast if I can and that verse chapter 9 from verse 1 and Paul yet breathing abstractness and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went onto the high priest and inside of him led us to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any or this way whether they were men or women he might bring them back unto Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near the Damascus and suddenly they are shared around about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and had a voice saying unto him so so why pass scooted out me and he said who are thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted it is hard for you to kick against the prick and as he trembled and astonished said Lord what would thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and he shall be told thee what thou must do and the man will join it with him stood speechless he had a voice was seen no man and saw a rose from the earth and where his eyes were opened he saw no man but that but they led him by the hand and brought him into the Damascus and it was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananias and to him said the Lord in a vision ananias and he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of tacos for behold he prayed and has seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then the last answer Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he had done to thy sins at Jerusalem um here he had Authority from the chief priests to bind all that called on thy name but they lost it unto him go thy way for he is a choosing vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and kings are the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my namesake and ananias went his way and entered into the house and put his hand on him said Brother song can you imagine that brought us all the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou cometh has sent me that thou might receive that sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as there being skills I received fat forfeit and a rose I was baptized blessed be the name of the Lord that was where the change started but of course something happened to him he was conver it was filled with the Holy Ghost and that brought a transformation blessed be the name of the Lord the Holy Ghost put him into the kingdom of God he sees from being in the Kingdom of Satan he was transformed to be in the kingdom of God and because he's in that Kingdom he had the Privileges that followed those that are in the kingdom of God blessed be the name of the Lord many times we'll read the Bible we read the messages we say Great and Mighty promises that God has promised his children but sometimes we struggle with those sins the secret is that you must be in the Kingdom before you can have access to the Privileges and that is the conversion of our souls blessed be the name of the Lord and the Lord said unless you are born again unless you are born again they were born into the kingdom amen not joining the kingdom here I am I'm in Canada you know I wasn't born in Canada I just came to Canada so by coming here don't make me a Canadian I'm in Nigerian I want Nigerian passport you Canadians you have some privileges that I don't have not because I'm a bad person no simply because I was not born here it's all right so also is the kingdom of God we can talk about it we can think about it unless you are born into it the Privileges that follow believer will not follow you and it brings frustrations it brings frustrations along the way you will not be able to stand sometimes to read the Bible be difficult for you so I'm trying to come to church well let me go it's not supposed to be so and that is why there must be a definite change amen blessed be the name of the Lord that was why the prophet came to introduce Christ to us to take us from our denominations our Chris our dogmas and bring us into the body of Christ that was the peace that Paul had although in the midst of trouble he had peace because he had the Prince of Peace the Holy Ghost brings peace it stabilizes Us in the times of trouble blessed be the name of the Lord but Paul has so much peace in him that he could even give it to those around him blessed be the enemy of the Lord amen can read these creatures the angels I give them to you these people's lives I give them I give their life to you their lives were in the handsome brother Paul and the Apostle gave you a good chair amen and he just spoke to me and I believe God that it shall be even as he has said they have time to listen to him remember they did not listen to him before now they have time to listen to him it wasn't an easy thing no sun no stars for 14 days the ship was they were not in control of the ship anymore you are not in control that's why they could not eat for 14 days they have saved from food waiting for death and that is where this world we live in is this was the way it's going it is it seemed that is act of control people don't think rightly anymore they have so much so-called freedom that can do almost anything they want to do and Satan because they are not in Christ Satan has seized that opportunity to enter into them and begin to suggest evil things to their heart and they call it Freedom there's no true Freedom outside of the word of God the only Freedom we have is to serve God according to his world and that is the true freedom is not to do anything we want to do in Canada you have a constitution you cannot go beyond your Constitution they will put into jail the word of God the Earth the world we live in there's a constitution and that Constitution is the Bible if you go against it it will be touching to hell because God will not be justified to create us to create human beings without giving them Constitution how to live on Earth and that is the scripture that is the Bible is the Constitution that we have we have to live by it blessed be the name of the Lord and when we live by it will become good citizens and if a good citizens we have the Privileges that follow good citizens that is why we are called Christians amen christ-like blessed be the name of the Lord therefore brother Paul derived his power from the infinite of the Holy Ghost and we must be filled with the Holy Ghost amen sometime when we talk about it some people feel somehow but that is fundamental Foundation of our faith is the holy ghost that is what brings us into the body of Christ who cannot over stress the importance of the Holy Ghost no the Bible says if we don't have the Holy Ghost you are none of his that's a very strong statement the evidence that your sins are forgiven you is the Holy Ghost when you are giving the Holy Ghost is a confirmation that God has accepted your faith amen and that was the first thing but that Peter preached on I know many of us have feel the Holy Ghost but maybe some are not fill the Holy Ghost I know most of our little ones they gave up touching water they've come to church but they need to exceed with the Holy Ghost coming to church doesn't mean that you're a Christian sometimes people say well I believe the message therefore I feel the Holy Ghost no around wrong some clear Ed and you cannot be filled with the Holy Ghost and live blessed be the name of the Lord the Holy Ghost is a definite Act in the life of a man a woman it brings a change he said we baptize in water for the remission of your sins I receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it must come to us we must we must ask God to fill us with the Holy Ghost who must intentionally ask God to fill us with the Holy Ghost and when we ask who must believe that you have received because the verse said God is willing to fill us with the Holy Ghost more than we are Desiring to receive it what a great thing that's a wonderful statement so we must everything about Christianity is by faith we receive it God is not giving the Holy Ghost now we all know that they have been given over 2000 years ago now what you do is to receive it amen it's not difficult it's to receive it but why would you save it we believe when we pray we believe but we must see the action in our lives our lives will begin to change you know the all things will pass away and All Things become new you become a better brother a better sister a better husband a better wife that will be a definite change in our lives and you will be the first one to know that you have changed and that those around you we know that this guy is no longer the same something that happened to him blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen that happened to Paul and he knew he knew that he was a child of God amen and we must know that we are we are Sons and Daughters of God we will be conscious of that whatever we do wherever we go we must know we are the sons and daughters of God blessed be the name of the Lord amen see if if we if we if we don't have that confidence you know that we are children of God then our coming to church even our existence will not be meaningful once had our confidence in us we must believe that we are children of God and why are you a children of God you belong to the kingdom of God Amen and then those privileges in the scriptures the promises and what have you then they belong to us we have access unto them because these are the things that God has freely given to us because we are his sons and daughters blessed be the name of the Lord amen sometimes we live and underprivileged life because of the lack of knowledge I said we I'm part of you are not just talking to you also talking to myself sometimes we live under privileged lives physically and spiritually because we are not conscious of who God has made us what God has made us to be amen we are not like other human beings that is the truth that is why we cannot compare ourselves with others you cannot compare yourself to a neighbor we don't live under the the the the the budget of Canada or the economy of this world do you know that because we belong to another kingdom we belong to a separate Kingdom this Kingdom of the Earth this world is of Satan we cannot live by that will be disappointed we live by the word of God by what God says about the time we are living in that is what is important to us is not what the the prime minister or the governor anybody says is What God Says what God's God's mind about this time blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen when we live by diet when you are members we use our thinking our heart will be filled with the word of God who think about it we dream about it we live in it and it works in our lives it most are the most us day by day who become more like him blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible said the kingdom of God is within us amen the kingdom of God is the will of God is that correct yeah is the will of God let that will be done as it is in heaven the kingdom of God is the will of God therefore we members of this Kingdom will live to do the will of God bless me the name of the Lord and that's what the Bible said me and you should seek fast the kingdom of God and his righteousness then all other things whatever it is will be added unto us amen wow that is a great statement I think we should dwell on that a little bit how do we see the kingdom of God do we stop walking and go to the mountain somewhere be fasting and praying read the Bible you know sleep and wake up seeking for the kingdom of God no no as a matter of fact we are seeking for the kingdom of God that is why we are seated here this morning amen we must seek for the will of God to be done in everything we do God has a kingdom and we are his children let's go back to the Bible if you look at Genesis 1 I think 28 they are God's commission Adam to replenish the Earth he said be fruitful is that correct let's read it I think I thought and God bless them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply okay be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth and subdue it amen we are supposed to subdue the ACT subdue minister to conquer I have control over well he will tell me that where that was then it cannot be done now but brothers and sisters that is our mission that is what we must do between this space from between us and Glory we must submit the Africa they are where we live in God has given us the authority to subdue the Earth and every man every woman on Earth are going to read from the prophet because we are we are created of God look at what is happening look at that electricity look at people going even they want to subdue the space or we as Christians we expected to survive the Earth your Earth is your own little space if you're a carpenter it will subdue that little space it must be the best Carpenter because we are working for the kingdom of God and we depend on God as I used to tell people if you are the best capital in town I do the best job at a very good price people will come to you is that correct people will come to you Christian the Bible said we should not he said we should we should seek to do the will of God then these things will be added to us when we do the will of God money will come to us whether it's house life whatever is money is that correct money will come to us when we do the will of God but sometimes we don't do the will of God we cannot walk like unbelievers who cannot live like unbelievers we are believers starting from our own our our own life our personal life must bring our body our everything under the subject under the subjection of the word of God even the way we sleep it's true because we are we are Christian Soldiers you know we need to talk about these things it may look Elementary but these are the things that affect us the way we live it doesn't mean that if we don't do this thing will not will not go to heaven no let me read the scripture to you uh Corinthians chapter 3. maybe that that will help us understand what I'm trying to say First Corinthians chapter 3 foreign [Music] according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have led the foundation and another buildered their own but let every man take him how he builded there upon the prophet has brought a message to us we have the message now we are the people who told manifest the message we have to walk on this way alone it is you and God we have to manifest it for other Foundation can no man lay it and that is there which is Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hairs trouble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work or what such it is if any man's work abide which he has beat there upon he shall receive a reward is that correct are you following me if you do the will of God you will receive a reward okay if animals walk shall be burned it shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yes sir as by fire your soul will be saved but you have no reward because you have not obeyed this world you have not manifested the word of God for your age you have not lived by those things you have been taught those things we have read in the Bible in the message we have not lived by them who have not lived according to the will of God because we live for the fortrans of the kingdom of God blessed be the name of the Lord remember those three people that were given talents one was given five talents and he produce another five is that correct that is 100 gain another was given to and he produced another two that is also 100 gain that guy was given one and he produced zero it doesn't mean that he will go to hell are you following me but there'll be no Rewards he has not put into use the talent that was given to him in the body of Christ every member of that body is important you have a role to play amen and we should never ignore that that is why we are here I asked somebody that I said how many uh how many people will go in Rapture in Calgary do you have an idea only God knows what we can guess we can guess I'm guessing if I say 500 would that be a good number so we say ah that is too high you cannot get 500. out of me but I don't know what is the population of Calgary it'll be one million I don't know now let's do 500. okay I have one million people so here in Calgary we have 500 representatives of God 500 people standing for God and those one million they are depending on you whether you agree with me or not but that is the way God sees us they're looking up to you and God is saying ye are my Witnesses so if we are in that Kingdom we must walk for that Kingdom it affects all that we are from The Young to the old The Young Ones they must live by the word of God the word of God must obey your parents in the Lord I know it's all fashioned but the word of God is not all fashioned is never out of fashion you must obey your parents listen to them if you have anything to say talk to them with all respects and if they say no they'll follow them if they are wrong God will hold it as possible but you must first of all to obey your parents blessed be the name of the Lord amen the wife will be subject with your husband I don't care what anybody says that is what the word of God says and the husband must love the wife as his own body amen if you follow the law of God who will reap the fruit yeah while we are here if the wife is subject to the husband and the husband loves the wife and his own body you have heaven in the home and the children they asserted their parents and the parents brings up their children according to the word of God you have Heaven on Earth we have problem because we don't obey the word of God amen you can you can read books have to make marriage work even the author is the divorcee to start with so so what do you want to get from so it doesn't the word of God look look look the word of God has power in itself to reproduce himself again I can give you an example look at Noah go to Noah Noah I'm going to bring water upon the face of the Earth the water will be so much that because flood and the flood with someone that will wipe off every living thing but you have to build an ark this Dimension this Dimension this Dimension listen to me Brethren Noah had the word of God the word of God worked in him comparative to be the ark the ark is the manifestation or the word of God to Noah is that correct when you believe the word of God we have to manifest it we have to bring it to pass do you think no one knew how it will build the ark he didn't know what he started from somewhere God said I should build the ark should get gopher wood then he got to go forward I don't know if he was a carpenter I don't know maybe he was a farmer because that was a common trait among the Believers then but because God said build the ark God must show him how to build the ark you preach God more sure you have to preach yeah this morning and depending on God it's not very easy to be here don't think it is easy I have to give myself to God if he has called me to preach then he will speak through me he will be the one doing the preaching so when we believe the word of God and accept it without any doubts and if the design that I know I believe the word of God is that he went to the bush to cut wood to build to cut off our wood to be that to be the ark that is the sign no I could repeat it over and over oh oh I bet God is how should be the ark I should be the ark that's just storytelling go and build Ark if you believe and he built the ark and the Ark saved himself and his family why because you obeyed the word of God when we receive the word of God sometimes it'll be difficult I wish you I will read it we are going to read it from the psalm for his own book sometimes will be difficult the reason is that our sisters have been clogged up by the things of the world and that's very difficult for us to even believe God and sometimes when when certain things happened as long as a testimony he said can it be so that the pastor gave a testimony about his dog do you believe it do you believe God can still work today maybe I should give you one testimony if you don't believe the pastor testimony surely will not believe my testimony we had a brother in our church we went for we went for an event and we have a voice of God building in Lagos all the churches in Nigeria came together built a very very nice uh building there we have all the materials from the voice of God so we went there for an event I forgotten what you went for actually um and just to call the story short one of the brothers the boss you are traveling with had a problem they packed by the roadside they were trying to fix it by the roadside a truck came you know this 30-ton truck that carries Granite is that what you call that stool and ran over him turkey tones and threw him to the bush and of course he was dead I was in my own private car I wasn't in the bus they call me that's what happens they pass a puzzle conquer you know everything is come this has happened well I told the brother my going there will not my Rashida will not make a difference let us pray right from here so by the head we prayed and then I drove to the place when I got I took him to the hospital and when I got there I called his name he opened his eyes and I pray for him again even me I was surprised amen I was pitching myself because it became difficult for me to believe and we took India from there to and to especially hospital for a proper express car when they did that I said please do this candle they bring everything and there's nothing as I called the doctor a brother doctor said look this guy 30 ton trailer ran over him he said there's nothing all the bones everything perfectly fixed up I was lucky the brother is alive today what am I trying to say I said I pitted myself because uh if I truly believed I would have told him to go home there's no need to go to the hospital you know because of unbelief but he wants me to go and check and check again and check again you know but we we the prophet said because of the situation we find ourselves on half today our system that channel between us and God has been locked up to the point that we have forgotten what we used to be but Jesus Christ came to bring us back to what we used to be to clean off to clear the system so we can believe and Brethren this is the only life we have on Earth for now we must live this life to its fullness and that is during the will of God whatever we find our hands doing we must do with all our might with all our heart and the prophet told us that if I Carpenter it will be the best if you're a farmer you must be the best if you cannot produce the best don't do it because we are created to subdue the Earth around us we must subdue our space whatever we are called to to do we must be the best in it that is what God expect from us we don't you know Christians don't run after money we don't run after money no no no no no no money comes to us because we work for the kingdom whatever you are doing please listen to me are key to our existence on Earth because we we are in a battle we're in a battle as Satan is is is is a very Wicked guy he watches and his accuser or the brethren whatever we're off the line we accuse us hey but he cannot do this and the Bible studies while some are sick some are are weak some even die because they failed to desire the body of Christ the body of Christ is the kingdom of God where members of that Kingdom we must have the right examine for that membership amen who must conduct ourselves in that way and that is the only way God can walk through us we we all need God we need God brethren and let me tell you it says become more difficult if you get to a point that only the just only the deposit the joy shall live by faith is only those that are living by faith can be successful amen to live at what God says no matter what any man or any woman says books as somebody said he said um say we cannot we can we can we can repeat we can repeat this but we cannot say it you know how we should be able to say it you know what I mean maybe you don't understand what I'm trying to say I carry these scriptures and say well uh whether Paul I mean brother Peter and brother John they were they were the gate called beautiful and they told the you know to rise up and walk is that correct they told it they said rise up our work I can repeat that but can I say it can I say it huh can I say it can you say it is a different ball game to say it rise up and walk and we can repeat it but we are not supposed to be repeaters well I don't think we are created to be repeated we are created to see it blessed be the name of the Lord we must we must think about those days we should never limit ourselves brethren we should not limit ourselves you are is you are more than a super human being it's not because of your righteousness it's not because of anything we have done but if you cause Jesus Christ came to make a way for us Bless That Be The Name Of The Lord and he has made a way for us already he's not making it he has made it already amen amen the Holy Ghost will give you to us to Quicken the word of God in us in order to reproduce it is not just to say it I mean it's not just to repeat it but to bring it to pass and that's the time we are living in we are expecting the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ now we are received the full word of God for our age therefore we must manifest the full word of God not half of the world but the full word of God we must manifest blessed be the name of the Lord amen and that is why whatever we do whatever we claim to be we might be conscious of that that should drive us that I'm representing a kingdom amen today you have problems everywhere you know in in countries like India that they understand they are they are burning churches and what have you people suffers persecutions because of Christ in India you have many religions have Muslim mother why Christian the same thing in Nigeria the kid pastors they burn their churches they bought Christians just because you're a Christian why Christianity that will be something about Christianity that Satan hates you know I used to tell my people look look at the look at look at uh uh some Christian preachers and pastors so they have a lot of money so have private jet in Nigeria some of them I think one of the biggest church in the world is in Nigeria very religious accommodate 100 000 people yeah they have private yes some one two three private jets preachers you can't find people of other religion to do that cannot find a Muslim Imam with private jets a Hindu priest with a private jets why is because Christ Christ is marketable that is the reason but they will pay for it because it was not given for that but they are using it for that they will pay for that so watch I want to try to say that what you have is marketable is a good product you can afford to sell other things and buy it it will never offend you hey man is a good product it's a pearl blessed be the name of the Lord and we are the Believers at this end of time what a privilege we should be happy we should gladly live for him no matter what happened bless me the name of the Lord amen whatever we find our hands doing let us do it well we must do it well amen because God has given unto us what it takes to do it well and because we are living for the kingdom we must gladly do it blessed with the name of the Lord amen because God has given us the Commandment if God says do this then he has already deposited in you what it takes to do it all you need to do is to act instead we should subdue the art we should be the best if a student you have take first class that is the will of God for you that is the will of God for you we don't compete with people no no no no we only go for what God has really given to us that is not competition God is true Brethren God give me the best I'm going for it that is not competition no what has been freely given to me it belongs to me then I must do everything I know how to do lawfully to take it because it's mine we should not you know become a second class you know okay this is good enough it's good enough it's not good at all right well let me as long as I go to heaven let me struggle to get to heaven no oh brother no no no no no no who should not be slothful in business we must put in all that we have whatever we have a janitor do you have utmost best if a dick can be the best King in the world if I a preacher preach amen God created you to preach then you must preach amen if I Pastor you Pastor you do your best not to please the people because sometimes it's tempting you know it's what is to be to be a pastor because you don't want to offend the people I want to begin to well I wanted to come I wanted to come I had to come it's good but you have to tighten the truth if they don't come let them go go will feed you amen if God has called a man God will take care of that man our duty is to tell the truth because you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free and it's only the truth that can set you free amen may God help us what time am I supposed to stop I'm sorry I didn't ask you okay all right because I just named foundation for I want to start that's why I actually two o'clock is that two o'clock I write sorry 12. either it's not too F now oh no okay I have to start now I'm sorry please can you project uh I gave one summer can you projected for me oh sorry what somebody would have won me all right please please just give me a few more minutes please please you don't have evening service today do you no fine ah please let's let's have a good Fellowship play please please all right all right right please has already helped me I I I want to I want to read from the prophet and that is uh the fundamental foundation for faith if you can be projected okay all right okay let's leave it there let's start from ah so we're there then now God when he made man in the beginning that is okay it's not here now God listen please now God why he made mine in the beginning he made him Superior to anything on Earth he gave him the jurisdiction of everything on Earth to control everything you see I was not speaking my words I was saying what the prophet said he controlled the animal life he control the foul life the fishes of the sea he controlled the winds he controlled the plant life he controlled everything now to us as human we may find difficult to comprehend but God sent the prophet to show to prove to us at those things are true that's right he control the wind did he do that he did not say sorry the Lord wind he spoke to the wind he spoke life into existence said this this career should go from here to here to here and stay here and it happened do you believe it it's a little fishy I give you a life the finishes so those things can be done now in our own time I'm not saying we should go ahead whatever I say hey I created no no I mean you can't just say anything the problem you know just say anything he wanted to say he had a mind of Christ we should have the mind of Christ when we have the mind of Christ we will do the will of Christ it was the will of God for that little fish to have his life are you following me and then he used that body to bring it to pass if he's the will of God if today you get an inspiration to say this turn that in your mind don't say it is not possible God sent the prophet to us to assure all that those things are possible amen it's not only the word it's not only the world but also the action okay man was made as a secondary God on Earth it was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was man Adam was given this great power but when the power that he was given to make himself where to make himself is where he failed he fell and Adam could speak to the winds and it will stop he could speak to the trees and they will bear him he could speak to the wildlife he should obey him he could speak to the waters ever what it was everything obeyed him now that is the beginning of man that was the original intention that was why God created man before the fall that's what God gave him in power for uh power over everything on earth now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father those things either could not do them anymore because he lost his fellowship with God because sin came between man and God then he lost that and all of his great channels became clogged up he could not even imagine ever doing that their man began to run from lions you heard from snakes all those things run away from them you know who could not control them anymore because something happened in the Garden of Eden now what Adam was in God cry back to that [Applause] don't let it be too difficult for you to believe now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to his original again and the prophet demonstrated that or rather God demonstrated that through the prophets do you believe it it is part of the message that we believe the message was not given to Earth I was only but by power and the action of the Holy Ghost when we are born again we are born into the kingdom of God to have access to the power of God amen you know here you know um this place is not like Africa maybe in Africa we have more demons I don't know or maybe we have black demons maybe here I have white demons I'm sorry you know um sometimes you have to prove that you're a Christian I will tell you certain things that you will not believe that happens I mean I'm sure how African Brothers here in fact people do certain things with the power of the devil I'm telling you in Nigeria you can be in Nigeria and kiss somebody in Canada you bring a bowl of water call his name and it will appear and then there you kill him you see blood in the water I'm sure you can't believe that it's wild but it happens you can take a gun and find somebody you get the bullet and throw it at you Brahma is that correct in Ghana they don't have Juju in Ghana they do no I'm I'm just tell you what's the time does well we talk about don't think it is impossible that's the point I'm trying to make any Satan can do that God will do more amen God we do more you don't think it's impossible because having that feeling oh oh no we're talking of now that is time we are living we are getting the the the the the more we get closer to the coming of the Lord the more we are like him not just in words but in action in our ways of life in power amen we demonstrate him it is here on Earth because over there we don't we have no work to do there all that we need to do if we have to accept but it is now amen [Music] so don't say don't begin to think oh can it be done no don't say that can be done and it's being done amen I remember we went to somewhere to preach before I came here very remote area very very remote area and the road was very bad that was his dream we have to literally drive through the stream he said well you are lucky because it has no rain if it rain you cannot do it so we drove and we got there so brother we witnessed a long time ago you know uh well let me start from there I'm sorry please are you are you are you happy with me yeah well I'm taking your time you know I may not see you anymore no it's true we will not see a game just bear with me those brethren we preached today about three years ago the very much area and he said look is this church maybe about 100 or 120 church members so I will preach to them about 80 percent of them believed so because what they have they have to live it was a denomination they have to leave the church so the 20 they were claiming ownership of the church building and this will say no we are more a number so we have to own the church building you have to go and it was like you know it was I told the brand they called me what must we say brother leave the place for them go and fellowship under a tree or a classroom it's not the building it is God in your midst God will give you another another building and within I don't know that was lightning turned out from heaven and removed the building completely destroyed Asus as you cannot fight against God so they call me to visit them so when they are and they had a problem they didn't have rain they are farmers they planted they plant rice he played their rice brother were in trouble because there's no rain this year you know to be I think don't worry I think God is able to make cream and we pray together it was around maybe two o'clock in the afternoon and so we left starting was telling me move fast because if it rains you will not get back home and then we moved when we go to our destination within two hours they called us that is raining heavily God sent rain and the following day they called again that the rice are already dominating said they said what has happened I said God I answered your prayers amen what am I trying to say that was I have confidence in the prayers we make we are not speaking to the same air we are talking to the creator of Heaven amen blessed be the name of the Lord sorry I was reading something uh he said now one man fell he lost this and now what he lost in the fall Christ came as a redeemer did you ever stop to think one crowd within us for what did he redeem us for in the Kingdom oh don't we stand the power of this world that they gave our heart that we must live for him that is what he did not to be nice well it's good to be a good brother God bless you God bless you we eat we sleep come to church clap our hands and go home and come again next Sunday no we have something to do right unless you are not in the body of Christ amen he has sometimes we Overlook it the small small things if a housewife be a wonderful housewife that is your postal Duty be the best that is why he redeemed you because you have a neighbor I did your judgment did not say about that you see I didn't say no wait a minute hey come here my daughter do you know this person yes that's my neighbor this is the way she lives so he may not have preached it but you saw his life you saw her life why didn't you do like that that's what what got to the king it's a kid I just was able to go and do likewise I will accept you now there's no need to fight just do what you did but it was not a hymn to do it right so let us do eBay when he was doing it he himself you understand so why should I just kill this innocent lamb why because whatever you do it just do it doing it he couldn't get away from it so he had to do but that was the will of God by Revelation he did it by faith believing that it is the will of God but Cain uses intellect say oh he's a nice God he's a wonderful god let's prepare some flowers and some good tomatoes apple and saying the best that guy he did not give God rotting things he gave the best but it was not according to the word of God so God rejected it so what God is looking for is what you do I according to his word and that is why he redeemed us amen amen now we are okay uh now the thing of this is the sincere restaurant man back that is paragraph 11 now now the thing of it is since he already did man back to his place man in the fall has lost his conscience or what father put him here on Earth to do right in other words all of the plumbing as it were in our brain and the atlas the faith have been clogged up with business affair with some with home love domestic things it all becomes so clogged up without until God can't operate through those channels that he made a man fall do you understand those channels had to be cleansed the way we do our business we should not do with our own intellect when we are walking we should work as if you are working for the Lord the government may be or the devil or the office if you are the devil but when you walk you think about God hey man you do the best [Applause] you don't

our needs we once desired him [Music] amen I know we have fake things out there for the general belongs to the house of God the original belongs to you and me we are the original Pentecostals yes we are the original Pentecostals blessed be the name of the Lord you know remember the children of Israel Roma you know went to our father what is Samaria and there were few in number where the enemies were more in number but God was revealing the secret of the enemies to them and through that they were safe those gifts they belong to the body of Christ who should not despise them so we have often we should notice we need them we need them they help you blessed be the name of the Lord they can warn us of dangers ahead don't travel don't travel today travel tomorrow don't do this do it this way that's how God leads us and then we reap the fruit of the land we have this people we have to think that God has freely given to us that we made manifest blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen we can go on and on and on and on uh but let me let me try to stop because the time is gone by his power can make his long walk a man the Lord Satan is death he brings cancer being sickness those in the Working Man ah they're working man you know bring problems in the family those I don't see they came from Satan they are not from God if Satan can make those you to walk a man the power of God should be able to also walk a man and much more [Applause] in September his wife can make his Lord work a man how much more certain all God with his power make it make his law working man he said I can make his Lord be sure and US recognize this how much you want all God to to his children to make his law be recognized among his people of Divine Healing Revelation power gives manifestations of the gift the law of sin and death Works in people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things if this one is real if sickness is real healing is more real [Applause] amen don't let it become too difficult for you to be no matter what the sickness is he came from Satan he came by the law of Satan but there is also the law of God who must hold on to that if this can work this will work better blessed be the name of the Lord don't see they belong to us our sons and daughters of God I was literally see those things in our life you can truly claim to believe in Divine Healing when you are sick and you hold on to the hand of God and you see healing then it shows that you believe it's not by saying it but when you are feeling that pain when this doctor says sorry we can't help you anymore then you say I appeal my case and you hold on that is when you believe the Divine Healing you know the promise that will be tested on the thing to have claimed to believe you'll be sick I'm not causing you I'm just telling you the truth you'll be sick and you'll be made to prove that you believe in Nevada by your attitude towards that sickness when you're running up and down as as hopeless and helpless human being just ensure that we believe we believe we go to the hospital is fine but healing comes from God the daughters cannot heal they can't heal because they're to die that is he cannot heal pharmacists die so so we cannot have absolute confidence in them blessed be the name of the Lord this war we are living in we need God in every aspect of our life let's read this as I've said Faith doesn't come by fasting say those who come by praying reading a book although that is good fasting praying and reading those are wonderful but Faith Comes by a settled something that is in the human heart that tells you just assure as you come to this church this afternoon when you came when you uh when you come home you told your wife you'll be home after the service was over and you do that unconsciously you just go out and get into your car and go home now you could not do it unless you have faith you could do it you've never moved from where you are sitting if you didn't have faith you could raise up but you you've done it so much and just become so accustomed to those laws till it's become natural to you and that is what happens in the kingdom of God to members of the kingdom of God is as simple as my brother standing up or sitting down you don't you have faith on the on the on the seat you believe it you carry your weight you have done it several times over and over so you now do it unconsciously you gotta I'm going home you're getting to your car say my darling I'll be there in five minutes and five minutes he was here that was an Act of Faith you have done it over and over that you got used to eat therefore you don't struggle to do it and that is the way faith is sometimes when we talk about things oh when will I have faith in my life you already have faith but you are not putting this into use the same thing when you feel headache you lay a hand on this I rebuke that demon or headache and it will go when you rebook it you don't expect it to stay and increase you're expecting a relief and you insist on it until it goes when you do that today tomorrow every day you get used to it are you following me if his leg he will not be bothered say Satan you are coming again that is my leg okay I rebuke you in Jesus Christ's name are you still there it must go because listen to me Satan has God's command human beings are the only ones that disobey God cannot disobey God so that is better than some people Satan cannot disobey God he knows he has a command that when we resist him it was flee from us who resists until he flees are you follow me he will come to you and then you resist he will say ah is he serious is he serious I do resist ah because the more you resist the more painful it is for him because he cannot continue because of the word of God God said we must leave that guy I must have that at the back of our mind in any way Satan shows himself we must resist him to the end he will fleeing don't worry it may take time if we may take a month well he was go don't confess negatively be positive stand on what you believe and you see he take his life that is what God put us here to do so who must be a good chance which always Satan comes God has given us Victory already all we need to do put our houses in order live the life amen of the people around you we see that you are a different human being and then you put the word into action and you stay by the world then you are doing the will of God you are working for the kingdom yeah and when you make your money your friend said you put yourself last God fast yeah we must follow those principles God Falls you take care of what belongs to God you're tired and offering it's true we take care of your family you take care of others the brethren and then take care of yourself last that is the principle uh where you do that we are working for the kingdom God will take care of your business because you are working for the kingdom if you don't give you cannot get we should not deceive ourselves it's a law it's a spiritual law you must give amen have one another by this people we know that were his followers because when he was here he did not live for himself he live for others we also must live for others we must get used to it so it will not struggle because part of our life God understands blessed be the name of the Lord because here we need him and the prophet said if you want to get a help from somebody then he must please the person you want Christ to help you then live by his word please him and then he will show his power he will manifest his presence blessed be the name of the Lord I'm really sorry I know I've taken our time but I I want to close by saying this that we have been redeemed we have been brought back to what God made us originally situations may arise in our lives to put those things into manifestation who should not be afraid and we are not living by the law of of Satan here no we are living by the law of God because we belong to another kingdom no matter what happens we should be a good chance according to the word of God because the Bible said he will never leave us not forsake us those are two different things he will never leave you as a Believer if you are doing the right thing he will stay with you but if you are doing something wrong he will not forsake you he will wait for you to repent and come back to him blessed be the name of the Lord so we should be a good chance because he has made a way for us he has brought us back to what we should be blessed with the name of the Lord
