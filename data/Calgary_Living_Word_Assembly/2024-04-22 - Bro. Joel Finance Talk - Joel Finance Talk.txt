TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for for for what for for sound guys are doing a lot right now trying to get everything together so I'm going to give him give him a moment okay I'm getting the thumbs up so I think everything is ready to go ahead I'm a guy that likes to start on time if at all possible so I think we'll just let people kind of stream in as they get here but for now I recommend if you want to be able to read numbers when I have numbers up here the closer you sit the better that's why I asked all the young people to sit pretty close because there will be an Excel spreadsheet at some point and uh the numbers in there might be interesting to uh to use yeah that's fine I'm good with that uh okay so I'm just going to start off with a word of prayer if you would all just bow your heads with me for a moment dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this day thank you for the spiritual food this morning father I pray that you would just uh bless it to our souls help us to recall it father and uh to be inspired by it and go study it ourselves Lord and just live the word that you've given to us we pray that you'd also restore the minister strength father help him to be um re-energized and and uh enjoy the rest of his trip in Canada now Lord we just ask that you'd bless this little meeting that we have father knowing that I don't have any um any gifts to to preach or to teach Lord but I just have uh something that could be of use to some people Lord I ask that you would bless the service bless the words that I speak Lord help me to not mislead or say anything that would be incorrect father and I pray that you would just bless it to the people as they listen we love you father and we ask all these things in Jesus name amen okay so I'm not used to this format I'm very usually a a dynamic conversational presenter um I think I'm gonna try to keep this as as close to a a church service format just because of the fact that we're in the sanctuary normally I would totally want banter and back and forth conversation but I think today we'll keep it relatively one-sided and at the end I'm going to stop the stream and then we'll go into a Q&A and I'll also be sharing um our personal budget and just kind of what it looks like when it's done and you've finished you've been put it a year of numbers and how you can use that data to kind of you make decisions and and track your own progress so um guys at the back just give me a wave if something doesn't make sense that you're seeing because I'm going to be looking at my screen mostly more so than your screen okay so very very early in uh my walk with the Lord this was one of the first scriptures I think that I I understood what a revelation felt like when it was no longer me just reading it and hearing it but it was something that was so real to me that it changed the rest of my life and um I want to start with this so I'll read the full scripture here most of the scriptures I'm going to paraphrase because there's quite a few of them and I I don't want this to be uh hours of of length um I'll keep it to maybe half an hour longer than the service this morning just kidding okay so Matthew 6:30 uh 6: 30-34 wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which is today and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you therefore take no thought for the moral for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof so just keep this in mind with everything we talk about today I'm going to show you as quickly as I can that there is a lot of scripture that talks about your money and a lot of scripture that proves that God is very interested in it and he wants you to um to to be successful materially and spiritually a lot of times we tend to shy away from talking about the blessings naturally but it's it's it's not God does not ask you to be destitute to be spiritually successful and um I want to show that to you but I also want to just everything to be filtered through this context at the end of the day no matter what advice you take from me if you seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness everything that you have need of is going to be added to you and um like I say this is the first scripture that was made completely real to me um divinely and it changed the rest of my life this was right before I got married and um I'm so thankful to God for it so I believe that God doesn't want you to be stressed about earning a living as we'll soon read God is not telling us to have no plan for our finances uh but he's telling us to not let it consume our minds and I think that's what this scripture talks talks about when it says um you know don't uh take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink it doesn't mean don't literally plan at all for what you're doing it means don't be consumed by these things don't let materialism become the ruler in your life if we seek Him First and follow his principles he'll take care of us the scripture establishes why we shouldn't be praying for wealth just as a means to no end but we should be praying for Revelation so um I'm going to briefly paraphrase a few of these scriptures so Matthew 25:1 14-29 this is the parable of the man who gave talents to his three servants I think we're all pretty familiar with this one so two of them invested it and uh they had returns that they gave back to their master and he rewarded them for that and then the third one just hid it he didn't make any return he did not invest what the the gifts and the talents that God had given him so I think this is a very important lesson for us um Luke 16:10 it says he that's faithful in that in that which is the least is also faithful in much he that is unjust in least is also unjust in in much so I believe we're accountable to God for how we use the blessings that he gives us and a quick like um maybe example of this would be you know you get your first job and that God has blessed you with a job some sort of income and immediately you spend every paycheck without thinking about how you're going to be off in like 6 months 12 months 6 years if you're looking for a family you're not providing for that family you're not preparing for the family to come I believe that is somebody that is not being faithful in the least and how is God going to trust you with what you think is going to be a very successful opulent career if you can't even use this basic you know $2,000 a month income to to do what God calls of you so from day one as soon as you get your first income for me I don't want to make this about me but I want to just demonstrate that I'm I have practiced these principles for many many years um when I got a paper route uh I was nine eight something like that very young and I was very accountable to my clients made had to make sure that we were up at the right time every day that we delivered the paper I had a flyer route so it was much less stressful than a real real paper route but um I and I saved that money I didn't have a a structure like I do now but it was just intrinsically my parents had kind of ingrained this thing into us where don't spend everything you make there wasn't like a a ideal amount to spend or save it just don't spend everything so we did and I saved it and I think that's um being being faithful in the least uh Galatians 6 verse 7 and8 says be not deceived God is Not mocked what a man Seth that shall he reap that's the paraphrase of that of that scripture so what I interpret this as is be intentional with your resources all of them your money your time your health your spiritual and natural gifts that God has given to you because as you sew with those gifts that's how you're going to reap later on so um although we're talking about finances and money and God wants us to prosper getting rich just for the sake of materialism is not the goal he Hebrews 13:5 don't let your conversations be jealous be content with what you have uh God said that I will never leave thee nor nor forsake thee so don't let jealousy and comparison rob you of your current Joy Crystal has a saying that I really like which is comparison is the thief of Joy because we can be content with whatever we have when we when our lives are ruled by the Holy Ghost but if you let income and money and cars or clothes become your God that is what's going to consume you and that's what you're going to think about that's what you're going to look at you're when you see somebody else you're always going to equalize well where do I rank compared to him or her and it's a horrible place to be and even though I believe I got that Revelation very early on of um seek first the kingdom of God this absolutely consumed me when I was um in in banking because I was always around my peers who were doing the same thing as me but I was going going like this and I felt like they were going like that and um it was really hard not to be comparing all the time and thinking well I deserve more um but really I had so much more because I I was the only one that had a family I was married with a wife and a kid and uh like ultimately that was worth way more and I wouldn't trade places with anybody but I kept on focusing on this one narrow Slice of Life and I think that's a a horrible Trap Of Satan to get into Matthew 16 or sorry 6 19- 21 paraphrasing uh don't lay up your Treasures on Earth where moth corrupts and thieves steal lay up your Treasures in Heaven uh because where your treasure is your heart will be also so again just getting rich is not the goal here 1 Timothy um I think I've got the whole scripture written out here because I couldn't think of an effective way to paraphrase it charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-m minded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the Living God who giveth us richly to all things to to enjoy that they do good that they be rich in Good Works ready to distribute willing to communicate laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may hold lay hold on eternal life so I believe with when you have the Holy Ghost and and you acquire wealth it does not create Pride if it does I think there's a lot of proof in where your heart really is if you think that you're a big shot because of what you're driving or because of where you're vacationing or what your house um it really shows where where your heart is because where your heart is that's where your treasure is going to be in your mind but um when you do get blessed if you have a a a heart for the body of Christ it really creates a desire to share not in like a socialist way in like a directing to needs way so if you see a need and you have a resource that would address that need it's a beautiful thing to be able to go out directly you don't have to talk to anybody else you don't need to to ask for a donation or a support from the church you can go directly to that person either um uh face to face or you can do it anonymously and it's a wonderful blessing to be able to have the the key for somebody else's lock and be able to get them through a certain situation or scenario and I believe that if you become wealthy with the Holy Ghost your life will go through that cycle often because you'll find that there's other people that you that you see that have needs that you can address Proverbs 11:28 he that trusts in his riches shall fall but the righteous shall flourish as a branch so as Believers we can't secure our future with just wealth you know um brother Nest just said it today you can have all these things in the world and lose them all tomorrow that's not up to you that's up to God and his plan for you so all blessings are from God and he alone knows what our future holds so I believe this is kind of a a lot of scripture I'm not going to read through all of them but this again talks to the importance of using your blessings to bless other people whether it's with music whether it's with Ministry whether it's with you know a gift of U maybe I I see I see Gifts of mothering Gifts of fathering mentorship Gifts of wealth and resources all of these gifts can be used in the body effectively and I think that's what every one of us is called to do and that applies equally to those who have um who have uh wealth so rounding out some of the scriptures here budgeting is in fact a scriptural principle does anybody know when the first time a budget was used in the Bible it's kind of on the slide but I thought it was fascinating when I was just looking it up Jo when he had uh interpreted Pharaoh's dream of the seven years of famine and the seven years of plenty what did he tell them to do he said make a budget put up this amount for the seven years and this amount for the next seven years and if you do that right as this depletes you'll have this Surplus that will deplete as well and you'll end up at the end with what you what you needed and they save their nation and many other nations as well just because they were the only ones wise enough to Budget on a national level for the future um so I I I firmly believe that the the Bible teaches us the importance of of budgeting with your resources uh Proverbs 21:20 says there's no treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man lot of times that That's essential especially in Calgary on one income it's very very hard to have Surplus at the end what I'm talking about is you're not just frivolously spending it you have a plan for where that money is going to go and that includes tithing and savings Luke 16:10 he that's faithful in the least is faithful in much and he that's unjust in the least is unjust in much I think we went through that one already so whenever you can find something to be thankful for Joy is always possible and I think no matter what your circumstances we talked about this a little bit on the car right here today is uh no matter where you are you you can have joy that you're gods that your soul is owned by by Christ no matter where you are what kind of health condition you have so at the very base level I believe we have a reason to have joy doesn't mean you're not going to be sad sometimes but you still have the joy of the Lord in your heart and if you apply that principle to scripture as or sorry to to your finances as well no matter what income you're making uh you can have joy and and and gratitude for where you are oh man I'm trying to get through these as quick as I can uh 1 Timothy 6: 6-10 godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it's certain we can bring nothing out having food and rment let us therewith be content for they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and predition For the Love of Money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith and pierced them through themselves through with many Sorrows isn't that an incredible statement that the love of money is the root of all evil you can boil down any motivations that are evil and find money somewhere in the root of it uh it's an amazing thought so money is not good or bad on its own it's the love of money that makes it evil it's what you do with what you're given that determines the morality of it and I've said before that you know if you have $100 and you buy a Bible or a pack of cigarettes that's not the $100 fault that's the user and what you're planning to do with it so the don't think of money itself as an evil thing to talk about or an evil thing to own it's how you use it that's important attitude is what will determine whether the money is good or evil in your life and in that in that regard I would just quickly throw in a little uh I talk about this a lot in youth group is mentorship find somebody who can mentor you if you if you don't want to talk to your parents about this for some reason find somebody else who you respect but I think your parents should be your very first Avenue to talk about money at an early age the second you start making a little bit of money I don't want I'm not teaching this I'm just as an example we do give a tiny allowance to our kids and they have responsibilities every day of the week and big chores on the weekend and if they complete those every week they get a little paycheck and it's like uh a dollar for each year so um like Elias would get $10 but then he has to take savings off of that he has to take tithing off of that and then he's allowed to do what he wants with the rest live on it so um I think having some mentorship at an early age will affect your attitude towards money going into the future that's just a little little drop for free I think these are my last scriptures here um so just kind of getting now into some fundamental financial principles I have been just applying you know my thoughts towards money for years and I never thought they were scriptural I just knew somewhere in my heart these were not against scripture the way I was using my money was not against the word of God but I found it to be very uh enlightening and relieving to find that there's actually a lot of scripture that tells you what to do with your money and how like budgeting how to plan with your money how to invest and make a return from it tithing um giving to other people your attitude to Mort's money so it's it's really amazing to find out that it's not just the Bible's telling you how not to use your money but there's actually a lot of lessons in in what you can be doing and I think um that gives me a lot of Peace uh so Malachi 3: 10-1 this is the one that talks about tithes and offerings so the bringing the my ti into my Storehouse that there may be meat in my Storehouse and then I will pour out a blessing that you can't contain and yes that's definitely spiritual we've said it many times but I believe there's also a natural blessing in that and um for Crystal and I we have a lot of evidence of that many many scenarios where we had to make a we didn't have to make a choice I'll will rephrase that because we always knew the first thing that happens to our our paycheck is it went to tithes we just have that carved out immediately at the top but there was many times when there wasn't enough money left for everything else and um that was really stressful very very stressful uh but we always found that we had a little bit of something somewhere that we forgotten not money for example groceries we had a car problem and we had already paid our tithes now we had to pay this mechanic it was due when we picked up the car so we only had one car and then we had nothing left for groceries that month uh very little like a couple maybe $100 but we had a pantry and we had a lot of canned stuff so we ate through our whole Pantry for a month just to make sure that we didn't use our line of credit we had a line of credit as like a last case scenario but we didn't want to put groceries on our on our credit um so uh I think God has blessed those kinds of decisions down the road is um I'm not saying that it's a sin to use your line of credit I'm just saying the attitude for us was first pay the tithes before everything else and in fact um again I'm not teaching this I don't have any Doctrine to bring I'm not a preacher and and I'm just saying some examples some some things to maybe think about uh when you're paying your tithes do you pay Justin Trudeau first or do you pay God first uh just something to think about um there is uh I think there can be a blessing in tithing on your gross but uh again it's not not not a principle that I'm I'm saying is is Doctrine or anything like that um Proverbs 99 is uh oh I don't think I actually summarized this one um but uh it's um Solomon talking about the importance of giving wisdom to people when you have some knowledge when you have a resource like I've said before passing it around to people around you um this is a Biblical principle and and uh that's kind of I guess why I feel okay uh teaching this in the in the church because I do believe that God uh cares about it and it's very important so one of dad's friends kind of told us this term and I think it's really important uh but it was John Wesley that coined the term make all you can save all you can and give all you can and that's in he I think he actually says that's an order as well if I'm not mistaken so if you're giving all you can but you're not making all you can your family is going to be in rough shape um and if you're again if you're giving all you can but you're not saving you're going to be in rough shape uh God can provide but it's not uh there's a saying don't bet the farm when it's coming up to an investment or a risk don't bet your nest egg don't bet don't make an investment or take a risk with your money that could hinder your family this is to some older people maybe not so much the young people on that one um but you don't want to take risks with your money that are that are um that are unsure unless it's money that you can afford to just give away or lose so now getting down to some initial numbers tithing obviously we say 10 10% tithing and then offering is in addition to the tithing um minimize your taxes and then save 10% and whatever is left that's your remainder so when we get into the budget here we're going to talk about that of how to start with your your income and and then all these uh these numbers will make sense as you as you build your budget up I also believe that it's important to make goals annually and review them regularly um before you make your budget probably important to review some of your goals with and if you're married with your spouse for example a few years ago Crystal and I uh we needed a car Crystal wanted a larger vehicle because she was transporting the kids to school and she was also noticing that we're often transporting kids to and from youth events and she wanted a larger vehicle to be able to hold all those people people we said this will probably cost $30 to $40,000 if we if we get a a nice one that is bigger than what we have now and we didn't have the money for that obviously at that time so we put it into our budget and we made a plan for I forget what the timeline was let's say a year to save up enough so that we had a good down payment and a deposit on a vehicle so that we could afford the loan and um that's what we did so at the beginning of the year we had a line for short-term savings maybe you know $300 a month or whatever it was to go towards this vehicle and um I think that's why it's important to make your goals and review them before you start your budget because you might get three months in and realize oh yeah I was planning to do this thing or if you're saving up for a house that's a big one uh start putting money aside for that now and um and stay with your parents a bit longer that's the best financial advice I can give you okay so um for some people this is going to be incredibly basic sorry to you folks but uh to others it's shocking that none of this is talked about in in mandatory curriculum at least when I went to high school none of this was mandatory you could learn a little bit about budgeting if you took some curricular extracurricular courses but who did that not me so credit cards are definitely a trap if you're not disciplined and how to use them so for my quick example here you put $1,000 on your credit card the typically the lowest minimum payment that I've seen is around I think 4% of the balance uh and that is evil to make that the minimum payment because it it entraps you and that is the purpose is to allow people to over leverage themselves with interest rate that they don't even understand into a commit that they don't even need and then they're paying for it 4 years so if you pay that 4% um payment it'll take you three years to pay off $1,000 that's if you don't spend a cent another Cent on that credit card in the reality people are spending every month and paying their minimum payment and their balance keeps going like this and it becomes you know those bell curves where that just starts accelerating and it gets out of control and then you find yourself with with you know $118,000 in useless credit that you didn't even uh want and it's just because you know you spent an ex $0000 here and there every month so in addition to the balance that you borrowed the $1,000 it'll cost you another $350 of interest if you make that minimum payment that's with today's interest rates about 22% is the average interest rate uh sorry 20 to 23% is the average interest rate on a credit card so that means on $1,000 you're paying $200 of interest every year just to have it there so the moral of the story is never ever ever buy something on a credit card if you cannot pay it off immediately um and I am an advocate of credit cards I know there's a lot of Dave Dave Ramsey listeners and I believe he's very anti-red card and I am anti- immaturity with your money uh if you're not financially responsible if you don't have the maturity to discipline your spending then yes don't get a don't get a credit card it's it's the worst trap you can probably set for yourself um imagine you're wanting to propose to somebody and and you haven't told them yet that you have $10,000 of credit card debt that's going to be a hard pill to swallow um so when uh when you're starting out I recommend if you can get a credit card when you turn 18 if if if you can can do some of the things I'm going to tell you here don't panic so if you turn when you turn 18 get a credit card with like a $500 limit that's typically a student credit card um they will usually approve you on your own but it might even be an okay idea to get your parents to coign what that does is it unfortunately ties them to your debt so if you default they're going to have to pay for it but what it also usually gives them is a is access to your statement so they can review your transaction and they can see what you've got as a balance and they can make sure that at the end of each month you've paid it off don't make your parents do that but it's not a bad idea to have them on there so that you have some accountability in the back of your head hey my my dad might check this at any time I better be paying this off uh but if you get it when you turn 18 you prepay this so for example say you need to buy $100 of uh of uh clothes or something you can put $100 on your credit card to day and then go buy the clothes tomorrow and make a rule with yourself that you'll never spend more than what you've paid already so this essentially makes your credit card like um uh like a bit of a a cash like in your pocket you only have $100 in your pocket you can't fabricate more cash on the spot you've got to stick to what you've got so if you do that to yourself with your credit card you can prepay $100 and just you got to be disciplined but it's it's really valuable in the long term um you're only going to spend what you've prepaid and uh if you have a budget that's not that hard to do but again takes discipline so sometimes an accountability partner like your parents is a good idea just to know that they can check on you and make sure that you're staying on track Never carry a balance ever ever ever whatever you have to do uh sell something if you have to don't even start because it sounds like a little thing to have a $100 balance but it's the principle that it enables that's really destructive get a l of credit if you absolutely need credit for something maybe you're going to school maybe um you you know you're going through a career transition or you're moving you might actually need some credit I'm not against any credit I'm just against credit cards having credit that's absolutely the worst worst way to have it um payday loans as well I I hope I don't have to mention them but I will never ever look at payday loans they're worse than credit cards um review your statement each month ensure you're not carrying a balance and if you are maybe you forgot or you miscalculated pay that before it's due so I get my credit card statements on like the 15th of the month and I think they're due on like the third of the next month you usually have about 20 days to pay your balance which is actually amazing um that's I think some of the some of the great things about credit cards is um uh actually maybe I'll just go through some of the the things that I I've put together as benefits um they they give you credit rate which is going to be really important when you try to get your first mortgage or a student loan or something like that they give you access to oper to things like booking a hotel room renting a car you can't do that these days without a credit card um they also teach you a little bit of you know Financial budgeting discipline that kind of stuff uh but also the perks Crystal and I take a vacation about every two years and we don't pay for anything and that's because we use the points that we've used for our credit card we buy everything on credit card that we can now because we're you know we've got a budget we've been doing this for decades but um well not quite decades but getting close um and uh yeah at the end of two years we have X thousands of points and we just say okay where can we go for these points for free and last time we went to Mexico I think and stayed in the we got the flights and the hotel with no expense because of the points and it didn't cost us anything to do that that's all the people that use credit cards and pay interest paying for my Hotel um yeah so don't pay for my hotel please let other people do that um so finally about interest rates here for those who don't know um all loans have different interest rates you need to understand what they are before you commit to it 22 23% is for credit cards that's extremely high the lowest loans you can get right now in today's market are probably about like 5 to 6% that's for a mortgage where you have a house securing the loan there's almost no way to get cheaper debt than a mortgage um so anywhere between 5 and 23% is what you're going to be paying you always want the lowest rate possible um if the if the payments are a bit harder you should you should just make a budget that's going to include that because sometimes you'll get a shorter term maybe two years at a lower interest rate versus 5 years at a higher interest rate the 5year plan might sound nice if you've got lower payments but if you can't afford the 2-year and uh your pay your interest rate is going to be 15% or something crazy uh I think you I think you should reconsider that that proposition in my opinion this is not again Doctrine if you're paying over like 7 to % for anything you should probably just not do that um it's it's way too high uh if you're a student you can usually get a parent to coign on something for like a student loan not for cars I mean for student loans and those will have relatively low interest rates because they know students don't have a ton of money this is actually like a like a gift from the government to allow students to borrow and go to school and not have crazy loans at the end of the at the end of the term um so student loans are actually relatively affordable um most of the time and I'm I'm definitely okay with them if if you're using it for what it's meant for okay if you have questions please just hold them I I I just want to not take your entire day here so I'm trying to Blitz through am I going too fast is is it making any kind of sense okay there's a lot more detail we can go into on these and if you want follow up just talk to me afterwards and we can we can follow up on any topic or we can have a one-on-one I would love to Mentor anybody who thinks that I can be use ful to you um I I don't think I'm exemplary in any specific Mark uh but I'm happy to provide input and and advice and uh mentorship to anybody who was looking for it okay so I think I only have a couple more slides but these ones are going to be a bit longer um because we're actually getting into building a budget now so this slide kind of summarizes the process of building your budget and Crystal and I go through this every year um we've been doing it for 16 17 years now so it's uh it's gotten a lot easier now we take last year's budget we estimate the future for this year I I mine's complicated because my income is variable so I have to take a like a couple of days to calculate my income but most of you will probably just have some sort of hourly wage or a salary or a projected summer job that you're going to get and you just got to estimate how much am I going to make on average going forward for this year start with that that's the first thing you need so um I'm going to briefly talk about gross versus Net Income because we're going to use net income on our budget so you start with your gross which is say you make uh I looked this up actually in Calgary the mean salary annual income for a single income earner is $65,000 a year so income the average single income is 65,000 a year when when you pay your taxes uh what what is that a month 5,000 I I should have known that yeah I think you're right 5,000 a month is uh what that uh comes out to but after you pay your taxes you're probably at roughly 4,200 a month that's what I estimated um that's that's pretty aggressive actually you might even be closer to 4,000 if you have CPP and any kind of um benefits or if you have an investment plan which is a great thing by the way with your employer your income could be lower so it's hard right now I've got to be honest in Calgary even on $65,000 a year it's going to be tough to live on your own uh and we'll show that I worked on these numbers for a long time to make them balance and uh um it's not easy so again my advice is if 65,000 just sounds crazy to you because that's a lot of money to be making in a year uh or if you're making 65,000 or more and you still can't find a place to live with your budget you got a room you got a roommate with somebody find a find a partner somebody that you can uh co- rent with or stay with your parents if at all possible stay with your parents that's the moral of the story um and pay them rent though so you've got your gross income of 65,000 a year you deduct you subtract your benefits from your employer if you have uh co-share co-p paid benefits your EI which is Employment Insurance that's mandatory if you're making a Sal like any kind of hourly rate you're going to have a uh employment insurance that goes to the government in case you ever lose your job CP p is mandatory as well that's Canadian pension plan um and then after that you deduct your taxes this should all be on your paycheck by the way but it won't be on your offer letter you'll get an offer letter that'll say this big juicy $65,000 and you won't really understand that it's actually 50,000 after taxes and uh and deductions if your employ I don't have this on here but if your employer has any kind of investment matching plan sometimes they'll have um pensions or they'll have RSP matching always try to make that work there were times where we couldn't afford it we didn't have the enough enough to pay for the whole um shared investment portion and you're kind of almost get robbing yourself because uh a good return on the stock market on average is about 7 to 8% and your employer is offering you 100% on day one that'll take you seven years I think it is or six years of what you're doing to make what your your employer is going to give you for free so if your employer offers you a benefit or sorry a investment matching or RSP matching please try to do that because you're going to set yourself up for rapid growth um they'll usually give you an option of what you invested in and that's where you need to talk to somebody who knows a little bit about investing and uh they'll probably want you to invest it in their stock which is not always the best option but anyways if you can take their they're matching definitely try to do that so after that is your take-home pay that's your net income that's what actually goes in your bank account so if you if your bank account says $4,200 got deposited that's your net income after that there's nobody else that's forcing deductions off of you so from there your budget begins so you you start with your tithes and your offerings then you are going to take your savings your your investment plan after that then you're going to go to your most important expenses which is going to be your housing so if you're renting it's typically rent plus utilities um if you're owning a home it's mortgage plus utilities plus taxes and maintenance I'm going to go for a rental option just because I'm I'm mostly talking to the young people for families and partners there's a lot more we could delve into here very way more variable when you're talking about mortgages there's much more complicated um option that you can be paying so we're not going to go into that today but if all things go well you want your housing expense to be less than 33% of your net income uh or sorry that your gross income your gross income um and that is just kind of a golden principle um I don't know if anybody knows this but I used to be in banking I did retail banking for a couple years uh hated it with a passion and got into commercial Finance which I really enjoyed but I learned a lot of horrible things about finance and how people ruin themselves in the retail side and uh if you can if you can get your housing cost under 3 33% of your gross income it's going to set you up for a much less stressful future so that's what we're going to use in our budget today then enter your fixed expenses if you have a debt payment that's a fixed amount or if you have insurance phone internet that kind of stuff after that you go to your variable expenses so variable expenses mean things that are going to change every month fixed expenses it'll be the same amount each month like your rent is fixed uh if you have insurance that'll be a fixed cost things that are variable will be like your gas your groceries you're not going to spend the exact same amount on that every month it depends on how much you drive or how much you eat um your insurance doesn't depend on how many times you crash well it it will don't don't test that but if you don't crash forever your insurance is still going to charge you and uh that's just an unfortunate reality but um after your variable expenses are in now you have discretionary income this is stuff that you can now spend on whatever you feel like um so it could be eating out it could be entertainment maybe you want to travel someday maybe you're trying to save up for um moving out and you're trying to get a down payment or get some other thing for a car that is all after the first six lines are already done so don't don't kid yourself it's it's hard it's really really hard in Calgary um to be on a flip side though Calgary has some of the most incredible opportunities in Canada uh the opportunities versus The Living cost we are far ahead if you were living in Toronto right now um I sure everybody knows this already but it's impossible to get a house for less than 33% of your gross income unless you're making like $2 million a year uh 33% is not possible um so the banks actually have changed the rules and they actually allow you now to borrow up to like 50% of your income which when I was in banking was you would get like almost fired if you tried to do that the credit guy would look at you and say you need to go down a few ranks but now they do it because the housing cost is just out of control so although Calgary is hard unfortunately it's one of the best places in in Canada from a ratio of income to uh cost of living so uh I think I think I'll actually go through the budget quickly okay that's that's not as bad as I thought it could be uh let's go through the budget now I just need to get the right screen shared anybody see any of that good okay oh you can zoom there okay do what you have to I guess to to make it work okay so if I move it still moves okay all right so income I'm going to I'm going to go through this a little bit slower now because this is the actual process of building the budget and I think this is being recorded so if anybody wants to they can go back review the recording take your own numbers I'm going to give you this template after as well so you can take this blank template put your own numbers into it and come up with with a budget at the end of the day that you can you can take into the future or you can use uh right now did you have a question or were you just yawning no okay that's allowed uh so we said 4200 was going to be our our net income on a monthly basis so say you work some extra time then you can put in you know if you made $100 mowing somebody's lawn you can put that in there as well um this budget is tries to be quite flexible so I I built it with a template and then refined it to kind of make it work for me but I I intend that it should be able to work for almost any situation not for a business just for households and um there should be extra fields in almost every category that you can enter your own things you can obviously change the names as well so if you need to to make modifications like that so here's where I am going to get out my cheat sheet so I don't have to do math while I'm talking okay so uh 65,000 a year grow if you do uh on a on a monthly basis it's actually it's $5,400 a month gross so just for my purposes of calculations I'm going to show that um I'm going to take 10% of that for our tithes and I have a thing in here saying use a negative number that's because I don't consider ties an expense and it kind of messes with the and picture that you'll get if you put it as an expense line it's much prettier and makes your data a little bit easier to interpret if you put it in your income so basically this comes off before your expenses start so I'm going to put minus 540 for tithes and then for offerings I'm going to say uh 20 so now at the bottom you will see does this highlight when I click okay so go down I'll go down a little bit so there is the the total cash available for expenses so this is your income minus tithes and offerings $3,740 a month sounds amazing right for all those who maybe are not making 65 Grand wait till we get to what the cost of living looks like uh these were supposed to be blank I am on the right one kind of wanted to just show the effect of of building this up on your own not just looking at numbers okay so that's all zero okay so when you're building your budget can you see the far yeah you can see the right side so this column here this is your budgeted uh allowance so these are the numbers that you would actually be manipulating when you're building your budget um I'm going to use them as uh I think those are my yeah those are my numbers that are going to go um uh in into into calculating expenses here but so let's just say you have a a student Landing credit or something you you're going to have some sort of a fixed payment or an interest payment every single month on that depending on where you're at in your loan so let's just say for sake of example you have a $100 loan that that's due every month so you'd put that into your budget field here um sorry in here so you guys can see that there's a column for budgeted and then there's rows for each expense category so student line of credit other loans maybe of a car or something like that never credit card um and then you have personal you know these are different categories that I've just made up so when you're doing your budget make it personal to you and uh and then enter some numbers that are going to make sense so we're going to say $100 a month for your L of credit that's one of your your your mandated expenses um so then uh after that slide not changing okay your savings and Investments should be um right right uh at the beginning of your of your budget so we're trying to go for 10% of our income in savings and Investments this is like a another one of those golden rules that if you can start at 10% and you can continue this for your whole life your investments will change as your income changes and you'll be setting yourself up if you have like a 40-year career or something like that by the time you hit your 40 45 years you should be set up for a a decent Nest Egg for retirement or not Nest Egg but a decent uh asset for retirement so that is um what I'm going to use here we're going to start with our I'm not going to explain these today uh we can go into this in another session if people want is different investment vehicles that's a little too complex for today um but we're I'm just going to say you're going to put $200 a month in your taxfree savings account and $100 a month into your RSP and then short-term savings maybe this is for a car or uh a very small down payment for a house and then emergency fund emergency fund is uh is a great principle hard in practice until you actually have a bit of cash rolling around it's very hard to justify an emergency fund if you're at zero every month already um but it is it is a given that something will happen in your life whether it's in six months or six years that will be an emergency and it could be you lose income for a few months it could be your car blows up and you need something else um it could be that uh one of your kids has a health situation or needs braces or or something like that or your your Appliance breaks but my point is there's a lot of things that will happen over the course of your life and you just hope they don't all happen at once but uh having an emergency fund is the way to Shield yourself from that kind of risk so um if you never have an emergency congratulations what we do is once our emergency fund hits a certain threshold like an investable amount say like $3 to $5,000 or something like that we would take a little bit of that out and and put it into a longer term investment that's going to make more money but still accessible if we really need it but I don't want you know if you don't have an emergency for a decade which is unlikely I don't recommend that you keep a ton of cash in a in almost zero interest savings account it's a it's a bad use of money again topic for another day but the when you're making your budget if you can afford to put a little bit aside for emergency this is not in your 10% savings uh your 10% is longterm you want to save for long-term stuff so you can see here on this uh this sell overall we have $450 a month of our income is going towards uh some sort of savings accounts and 300 or so of that is your um your long-term investing I'm assuming as well that there'll be some CPP coming off your paycheck which is Canon pension plan and that's also counted for longterm because you'll everybody will get that if you pay into it when you retire uh again another day we won't get into the details of how it all works just got to have a little bit of faith on that one um so then after that I think it was housing yes so your rent and utilities I'm sorry that this is not laid out in chronological order I don't know how I laid it out I think it might have been alphabetical at one point and now it's no rhy or Reason so mortgage and rent um I I did some time looking this this up on like rent faster which is a website for rental properties and I was able to find a few options for $1,400 a month which is the most that you can afford at this level so if you're making $65,000 a year you should try not to be spending more than about $1,500 a month on your total housing cost so uh for an example on a like a $400,000 house your mortgage payment is going to be around $2,000 a month I I didn't do the math I'm just guessing on a $400,000 house that's hard to find these days um then you have insurance then you have utilities then you have maintenance so I Rec sorry property taxes yes not insignificant if you're in a condo you have condo fees as well so my point is home ownership is a great aspiration but it's not necessarily practical if you're living at your parents and you're hoping you know to stay there till you're 45 and you can afford a house that's probably not recommended um no matter how much of a mama's boy you are you're going to get sick of each other so uh I think renting is probably more realistic for the vast majority of people looking at your first house the what what makes saving up for a home a lot easier is sharing that rental with someone so find a good friend or get married that's the best advice to the right person and uh and share that expense a little bit that like two incomes is a completely different picture on your household and um you know uh every family has to make the decision on how they're going to balance out their um their workloads and that kind of stuff but if you can put in a couple years of dual income uh that will probably help you to get your first house on a payment that the single income can afford so I'm going to say 1,400 is our rent and I can't believe how hard this is on my voice can I actually I feel like I might need some monitor or something I hear people say this all the time and now I think I see why I'm really losing my voice already okay um so 1,400 1400 a month mon for the rent and uh you won't have property taxes if you're renting um furnishings and additions this is not included in your 33% but this is like say you need a table or Cutlery which you do need um Crystal and I add a line in our budget for this so that every month we're saving or we're budgeting a little bit of money for that and then maybe in like in October she goes to CCO and she sees a a dinnerware set that that we would uh wanted well we have money that has been kind of been sloshing it's not in a designated account but it's just kind of accounted for if you know what I mean so these are not things you're going to pay every single month but having it in your budget allows you to acrew just a little bit of wiggle room down the line or if if something comes up you can steal that money from that that wiggle room um and we've definitely done that as well so I think I said $50 a month for that category and then um supplies again this could roll into your Furnishings but this is things like cleaning products toilet paper you know all the the less fabulous parts of living on your own that does doesn't just appear out of nowhere you got to go buy it and uh and then consume it in some time okay so I have here I don't know why these numbers are are not that's going to frustrate me but I'll try to let my OCD go for a sec so we got just under $1,500 a month as our our total uh for month uh sorry for for housing so out of a $4,200 a month uh income that's actually really good uh let me do a quick math here that's just under 30% um off of your 65,000 a year so there's even a little bit of wiggle room here if you're willing to compromise in other areas of your life you could spend a little bit more on your housing or you could put that extra into saving up for a down payment on something that you really want okay so after that we're going into our more fixed expenses which are um not finding okay so like your phone bill is going to be uh usually a fixed expense if you're on some sort of a plan so uh I don't know if this is unreasonable I thought $100 a month you could probably find a phone plan um for most people that will work for 100 bucks a month it doesn't include the phone so buy uh buy a phone on their plan for extra 20 bucks a month or something or um you already have a phone maybe because you've been using one for a few years or something like that so that's going to be a fixed expense your electricity and gas I estimated about 75 and that's pretty realistic all these numbers by the way I took a lot of time to vet these These are numbers that based on your income a family or a household of some sort would probably end up with real numbers just like this we're also landlords so we have a couple of of rental properties and these numbers are right in line with where they are so just so you know this is current day dollars basically that we're looking at um so water and waste if you are um renting that's not going to apply to you that's usually included but what I would say is internet you're going to need an internet connection no matter what you're doing I would think that's roughly going to be $100 a month as well as well so your fixed costs there are about 275 a month and right now you can see as as we're doing this there's a a total at the bottom that's running so on our uh on our current numbers we're at $2,300 a month and we have $4,200 or sorry no wait after tithes it was $ 3740 so you can start to play around and and and come closer and closer to that net number where you're going to be able to afford everything and now at this point I'm just going to go from top to bottom through all the categories because I think we're we've done the very uh important ones so now these are these are ones that you could probably um Flex based on your own needs discretionary cash Crystal and I call this mad money we each give each give um give each other we each get I don't know how to say this all of our money goes into one account it always has from day one both of our paychecks go to the same account all the expenses come out of the same account we both have access to all the accounts nobody is superior I don't have special privileges because I make more I'm not saying that this is Doctrine again I'm just saying this is how we decided to to set up our budget for the first five or six years Crystal made more money than I would than I did and we expected that someday mine would overtake hers so we just decided like we want this to be to feel Fair all the time because if I want her to work less I don't want her to have to feel to feel like I'm getting more privilege with the spending money she spends way more than I do just because she manages the house but it's not on herself so we get the same amount of spending money I could go burn this money if I wanted to I could go hang out with the guys I could go um buy a bunch of food that she doesn't think we need like I can go out for meals or something like that so discretionary cash we call Mad Money and this is just money that's not budget it at all it's just there you get it we have separate accounts for our own mad money and that money neither one of us has influence over so she can spend it on anything she wants for herself if she buys $500 of shoes all I can do is roll my eyes but I can't say no so and uh I think this is important in any household to have some amount when we first got married this was like $25 it was really small but we had something there that we had autonomy over and we could feel like you know treating ourself once in a while on ice cream or a burger at the University something like that so I do think that some sort of discretionary cash should always be budgeted for because you're not a robot and you can't live off of a spreadsheet every day um Fitness again up to the individual I estimated a gym membership or something or maybe saving towards a bike or a good pair of shoes about 50 bucks a month health and dental this is really hard to say everybody's going to be different um I put immediately $25 in there if you have dental problems that's going to be different uh but a lot of employer benefits plans they have gen General stuff that you'll need you know like chiropractor and that kind of thing they're a lot of and of course with AHS all of your your Essentials are covered through um our Healthcare System okay so we already did our investments food this is a a fun one not so we spend an Unholy amount on groceries and I don't know how it happens but that's not my my department so I tried to estimate without a lot of authority how much people spend on a single income um I said $350 a month no what's more realistic is that is that high or low it's very low for for one person 500 I don't think I can afford 600 this person is eating more instant noodles yeah so that's going to throw my numbers off we're going to have to to compromise somewhere else because I I massively underestimated the groceries um but yeah it's it's getting pretty intense out there depending on your diet obviously everybody's going to have different needs protein powder is the first thing as Daniel knows and then you pay for vegetables at the end okay so maybe it comes out of your restaurant budget I had put $50 a month for restaurants I think that could be in your mad money that could be your discretionary for Crystal and I we we put a separate line item for groceries and I think it's literally $50 we we eat out very very rarely uh maybe like four times five times a year we eat out as a family so we use our own mad money if we want to go out with friends that's where we what we use that money for so one of the ways that we keep our budget in check is we almost never eat out and we learn to be good cooks and we actually really love it when we entertain we have people over to our house that's one of the reasons why our grocery budget is where it is but um we take a lot of joy in cooking and serving it to other people so if you want to eat out more you're probably going to have to make compromises in other areas uh but that's kind of what what I allowed this person so Family Care there's lots of categories here for a family with with multiple people in it but for one person we thought gifts is probably the the one mandatory item in there you likely have a parents you likely have siblings maybe you even have a friend um but somebody in your life needs a card or a gift once in a while uh this is this is something that's completely personal so if this number looks ridiculous to you you got to make compromises elsewhere uh Crystal and I we don't give very expensive gifts to each other or to our kids uh because we do other things that that are valuable so um but for this cheap person I put $25 a month which uh what's that like 7 650 bucks a year so you got to spread the love or just have very few friends that's what I chose okay so insurance this one uh is assuming this person has a cheap car my first few cars I didn't have comprehensive I think it's called I don't know the terms I just had liability so if I if I crashed into somebody their car was paid for mine was not and that I didn't care cuz my car my my first car literally cost $700 and it it ran for like 3 years so I was really happy with that so I'm assuming this person has a cheap car cheap insurance no accidents $100 a month I think it is possible it's it's very very close and a a very cheap car or or like I said no no um comprehensive at all so maybe a high deductible I think it's possible to get there home insurance if you're renting it's super cheap it might not even be $50 a month if you're like a small a small property with very few items basically all they do is they cover your furniture so if your house burns down you they're not covering your house because you're renting it they're covering the stuff inside the house so your clothes or your furniture that kind of stuff life insurance this is another conversation but I'm not going to go into it so I'm very grateful uh um my parents basically forced me to get life insurance when I was like 17 and they forced all of all the kids I think they paid like a few uh months for us and they put a little like lump sum in it or something but then we had to pay the monthly premiums and I've been paying that since I was 17 Jeremy has been paying it since he was like 15 and Andrew's been paying it since he was 19 and I'm pretty sure they're both uninsurable now so they got life insurance at an early age before they knew about their health problems and they can't get that insurance anymore so there's a lot of I'm not going to you know I'm not going to get into it too heavy if you've never thought about life insurance start thinking about it no matter how old you are um if you thinking about having a family really think about life insurance because you might not be insurable in 2 years uh you might be dead in two years um so the premium when you're young I think I'm still paying on that first policy which I think is a $200,000 death benefit I think I'm paying like $60 a month it's really low and if I did that today it would probably be five or six times that number not because of inflation just because I've gotten riskier because I'm older I'm more likely to die so um life insurance as a at a young age is a really good thing to look at um if you believe in the value of it at all some people have no faith in it and whatever that's fine but I think there is some some benefit to it so I I put that at $100 and I also consider this an investment of of sorts because this will go to your estate if you have more than the cost of your funeral like you can get funeral insurance which is like $10,000 or something benefit very very small just to cover your casket and the dirt but if it's a few hundred, um that'll be your you know to your wife or your husband or your Offspring so this can be included as a it can be rationalized that this is kind of an investment in a way and there are ways to actually make it an investment to put real value into it and make it something you can liquidate before you die not getting into it just throwing little nuggets out there um okay so fees I couldn't think of a lot of annual fees for a single person like Crystal has a nursing fee association fee I don't I think this is very specific I can't think of an annual fee that you'd have to pay other than like your credit card if you have a special one uh school fees that's again proam is likely we have a school fee for our kids um entertainment I'm not a big believer in a lot of entertainment so this person's living on YouTube or something uh they get $20 for games movies books $20 for random hobbies and $20 for clothes you already have a wardrobe okay you're not you're not starting naked you're starting fully clothed with years of wardrobe and your body is hopefully staying a similar shape for a long time so I I I don't know if this is valuable information to anybody but up until 6 months ago I have not bought clothes for about 4 years um I just don't it's not my thing I know a lot of other people would spend what I spend in four years every two months so just do you but this person also understand has a low income to housing ratio they need to live on their own but they don't make more than 65,000 a year so clothing is something that realistically you could swall your pride if you had to and wear last year's clothes hav't forbid um okay this is actually a category the entertainment I think that's how I made this this budget balance was I stripped I stripped this way down oh boy uh fuel this one really depends some you might be able to live on Transit and maybe you don't even need a car at all in which case you're saving a ton of money over this person like if you don't need a car you're you're much better off Calgary is a hard place andless unless you live near your workplace there's not even there's not even transit to the church here which is unfortunate um so I put fuel I think pretty high I said $200 a month um we we spend a little bit more than that but Crystal has an SUV and we drive from Okat coses so if you live in Calgary um and you commute every day I think you could probably find a way to make this work it might be tighter than I think that's one I could be a little bit out of touch on but I said if you're having a small four-cylinder car you're you're making it on 200 bucks a month and again like say you spend 221 month you got to find somewhere else to pull that from maybe you're not buying any more clothes socks or whatever you're going to buy that month maybe you spend less 150 bonus put that into your maintenance budget for your car um or a down payment for a new car someday don't don't just spend that money if you can help it um I should balance that a little bit though I like what brother Nester said enjoy life don't don't be too too rigid everything that I'm saying is from a place of balance your budget at all costs and I think that's the way that you should think but once you get experienced in managing your own money there's definitely flex and you'll see that on my budget when I show it there's a lot of variance um so it's not like you're breaking the law if you miss your budget once or twice maintenance fund um I said cheap car probably a high maintenance fund 100 bucks a month this is basically your own insurance so instead of giving your insurance to a black hole that will never come back to you make your own Insurance Fund and in a year you have $1,200 sitting here maybe you needed an oil change so you have $1,100 in there um maybe you needed tires so you only have $400 in there maybe you needed a transmission so you just said forget it I'm buying a different car um but if you if you use your maintenance fund you can make it like your own self-funded insurance plan and over time you can have a few thousand dollar if you just roll that for years be humble about your car and then one day you know you're sitting on three or 4,000 that's worth more than your first car was and now you're upgrading to something a little bit nicer or if you get married and you only need one car we leave done one car for I think six years something like that five or six years I had no car for a very long time time CU I took Transit everywhere I went I was a student for the first few years of marriage and and a co-op student so I just took Transit everywhere and didn't didn't have a car so and Crystal's car was quite cheap and she owned it already before we got married so it was a it was a nice situation um registration for for vehicle this is cheap I said 20 bucks a year that's going to be your registration and your driver's license just just put a little money aside for stuff like that so you know to think about about it every time you make your budget but it's only like an annual expense it's not going to not going to hit you too hard okay just about through here um utilities we did okay vacation this person doesn't take expensive vacations uh I said $20 a month this is like a road trip to Edmonton Maybe maximize your vacation by spreading it with friends you know uh go hang out with Miles they they have a motor home I don't know find find a friend with an asset that you want to share with them um miscellaneous expenses so there's obviously going to be things you didn't account for and I don't have a lot of money left over so I said $50 a month let me just check something oh we have $40 left so um now you can kind of choose where you want to uh treat yourself maybe you just add that to your MK and you just have this extra $40 a buffer every month we use our miscellaneous expense all the time uh things that we just didn't think we would get and we end up uh splurging on something so we just have a little line item and and we don't we don't usually say what it is unless it's a big thing like when we move to the to the acreage we had to get a few things so in the cell if you right click and then you insert a comment you can say um alone $90 so then in like eight months when you're reviewing your budget and you're like why did I spend so much money in in January oh yeah then you smell the cologne and you thank yourself so uh I just think these comments are useful sometimes I think that's kind of it for the budget so now if you imagine you've got this budget and you filled this in so I did this on the expense line so column D is January's expenses so if we were in January at the end of the month this is where I'd be putting all these expenses but when you're doing your budget you obviously want to do it in this line and that's important because over the year it will show you what your or sorry what your average is so right now my average per month is $100 because I only have one month in there but if you if your average goes up you'll start to see it on this line and it'll tell you you're kind of getting out of check um your annual total will also show here and then on the summary page which doesn't make sense yet I'll show it to you on our budget this is why you want to put that budgeted number in there and why you want to put the tides in your income because it will actually net everything out and you'll see at the end of the year all this data happens automatically once you've entered the the um sorry all this calculation happens automatically when you enter your data at the beginning so if you've ever seen like the Mint app there's a lot of apps that do this kind of stuff the problem is they are littered with ads the platforms come and go like there's been some that we've used that are dead now and I have this data going back to 20 2009 I think I have budgets going all the way back to 2009 which is kind of fascinating because sometimes we look back at them like wow um and it wasn't this pretty at the beginning but if you do with your own spreadsheet it takes a little bit of manual labor Crystal does this thank the Lord um so every month she opens up our bank statements and she inputs down to like the nearest I think all of our expenses some of them are repeated so she just enters it once and it goes through the whole year um but like groceries is the big one she like that takes a bit of time she just enters you know the Costco receipt if it's like $300 she'll add $300 to the food line and then in 3 weeks if we have another $200 she'll say plus $200 um she doesn't you know oh there was a there was a supplement in there or there was shoes in there she doesn't get that granular usually but at the beginning we did we broke out anything that mattered because we had to balance our budget and there was no room for error so you can be as liberal or as tight as you want on this but I do think that if you have your own spreadsheet you own that data nobody else is farming it out and um I'm still hoping that you appreciate the kind of graphing that you get at the end it gives you some pretty rich illustrations of what you've done um and that can be a benefit in the future I think I just have one more slide and then I'm going to go into uh I'm going to stop the stream and and go into a little bit of personal information and a [Music] Q&A okay so this is what we just did um it'll probably take you if you if you have um no expenses no understanding this will probably take you a day to do your very first budget if you already have been living on your own or as a family it'll probably take you a few hours because you'll know what your housing costs you'll know what your roughly what a lot of your stuff costs um but it's if you have never budgeted before I urge you to do it even if you're doing fine even if your money is great because what it helps you to do is it really makes your budget efficient Crystal and I uh obviously we spend money on some things that other people would disagree with but there's not a lot of waste in our budget we we see Peaks and we see outliers right away because we review this together as a couple every month and um we catch outliers and we mitigate them as soon as we can so if we see oh wow gas was way higher last month what happened uh she'll say oh yeah well we had to do such and such and I'll be like okay so next month uh what can we do sometimes nothing sorry we can't change it we got to swallow that cost uh other times it's well um you know let's drive this car because it's more efficient let's go to let's not go to this place um let's wait till we can carpool um let's use the bus for the kids instead of driving to school like we'll find ways to to scrape back a little bit and um I I can't tell you how valuable it is to run your life off of a budget it it seems maybe a little stressful initially but over the course we've been doing this ever since we got married in 2008 and I I can't even think of the tens of thousands of dollars that we've acred over that time just by knowing where all of our money goes when when money goes somewhere we know about it it's not an accident and it it gets accounted for and it either influences future decisions or it inspires a retraction maybe we go return something it's like wait uh we don't need that as much as we thought we did and we can't afford it so uh we don't just have our budget to have numbers we do live by it and we keep oursel very accountable and nobody else cares like it doesn't influence anybody else uh but it's really helped our retirement plan and um our ability to help others and our ability to kind of Finance certain Adventures that we wouldn't be able to before so that's my Soap Box can you see this now okay this is I think the the last point on just maintaining your budget so this is a relatively obvious process maybe but I just wanted to lay it out for the recording so you enter your actual income and expenses at the end of each month and then adjust your spending if you need to if you're going off track adjust your spending a little bit don't just you know have a budget and never check it look at it every every month and uh enter the data every month if you overspend you might need to compensate we've kind of already gone over this um you can either eliminate some expenses cut back somewhere you can add to your income pick up an extra shift or supplement it with some side gig maybe you drive for Uber or something like that you just pick it up when you need to um but never use a credit card to cover your shortfalls um and never reduce your Investments so our strategy and I think every advisor's recommended strategy is to have your investment come automatically off of every paycheck so that you can't influence it it's a such a pain to change that you never do it and you just live off of what's left and I promise you it's true like if you think you can't afford to invest $50 a month just take it out automatically and watch your spending change uh if you don't live on credit cards that is um so if you're if you're Comm to not using your credit card when you can't afford it you just have your investment go out the out the window and you never even think about it and then you look back in a year and you're like wow I've got $1,000 here already and then in five years oh that ,000 has gotten interest and I've put more in there and you put that through um again we won't do this today but we could have someday do an investment plan what it would look like to retire at the age of 65 no matter where you are in life right now and you can calculate what that costs and what you have to do now to get there um with some assumptions so if you haven't done that I would urge you to do that someday as well um ideally with an independent adviser not with a bank because I worked at a bank and I can tell you they do not have your best interest in mind we had our our Targets in mind that was all we wanted you know if we could make it work for the client and US bonus but it was all about making it work for you for me as the adviser advisor I was trying to to make commissions and that's what everybody wanted to do so banks are a horrendous place to get advice for for finance for investing for loans you know they're probably the best thing you have right now but uh private loans are much worse than bank loans okay review your actual numbers at the end of each three-month period um that's just so you get if you if you don't review your so you review your numbers every month but then you review it on aggregate in three months or so so you can see the trend there's no Trend established in one month but over 3 months you can start to maybe see some of your habits and then adjust going forward strategically save for large purchases oh yeah this is this is kind of important um I think I've implied it a few times so say you're trying to save up for a car and you know it's going to be $5,000 if you think like like with Crystal's car we we we put aside like $300 a month every month and didn't spend it it went to a separate savings account and we just let it sit there and fester and then when we needed it we had uh you know a sizable down payment for it so if you if you know there's a big expense coming up then I would just say um put money aside for that now with our acreage uh we knew our monthly payment was going to go up and uh we decided to live as though we had that payment before we had it and this was before we committed to an Anchorage we just said we think we want to do an Anchorage so for like 6 to 12 months we tried to put money aside and live as though we had that payment already and then we knew oh we could actually do this like with a few tweaks or if I make a little bit more we could make this happen but you know if you tried that and then you find out oh man I'm getting $400 a month not a thousand I can't do it well you just saved yourself a lot of headache um so for houses and cars fixed term payments I would advise you to live as though you have that payment when you start thinking about it because once you commit to it the bank would love to saddle you with that before you're ready they will find a way to get you that loan um as much as it might sound the opposite they actually really want to uh to approve you um and sometimes it's not in your best interest so uh does does that make sense just start paying your payment to yourself before you pay it to the bank for like six months or so okay this is the very last slide oh yeah so this is this is I guess a uh an offer I I wouldn't say a pitch I'm not trying to do more of this but if you think there's any value in someday doing a second session we can talk about anything uh my first idea is investing um how to do basic Research into investment vehicles like tfsas rssps pensions why you should be skeptical about financial advisors especially your bank but almost anybody who earns a living by telling you how to use your money they have motives for themselves um never risk your portfolio on an opportunity that promises unrealistic returns I know too many tragic accounts of people that have thrown their investment towards something we personally got hit by something like that it was on the advice of our adviser um but I've seen people lose their entire like 30-year portfolio because somebody said this opportunity is too good to miss uh you only have like 8 hours to decide well that is the first reason why you should never do it people try to as soon as there's a time limit on when you got to invest you know there's something wrong with it so if it's a good opportunity it's waiting for solid research to get there and um they won't be pressuring you like that so I guess just something to think about would you like a presentation about savings and investment strategies if yes then uh just talk to me later if we get enough interest then someday um I'll do some sort of follow-up and if not then uh thank you very much for your time I think we'll stop the Stream
