========================================

Watch an eagle fly today. Soaring on wings of golden gray, he glided upon the wind so high, carefree, unbound, with regal pride. He seemed the freest heart in flight, yet he even he knows not my height. Though his wings may kiss the blue and ride the heaven's deepest blue, he knows not what my soul feels when Jesus comes and breaks my seals. For I, a child redeemed by grace, am soaring beyond time's dwelling place. The eagle flies though his wings The eagle flies yet bound he's still he's bound to nature's pool to earth's own ground but I have been loosed from sin's dark chain from self from flesh from inward shame no longer clothed in rags of pride but robed in Christ beyond sanctified no voice of guilt no whisper sly I no fear beneath the serpent's lie can hold me from my place above. I've tasted perfect holy love. The law fulfilled. The curse undone. The war is over. Victory won. Free from the grave. Free from fear and night. All things now brought into the light. My thoughts confined. My steps made sure. My soul proved clean. My heart made pure. No veil remains. No shadow hides. The living word within me rides. Oh eagle, noble in your flight. You rise on wings of sheer delight. Yet you know not the liberty bestowed by Christ who dwells in me. I've been raised from dust and sod to reign as son, a child of God. True freedom breeds where spirit dwells. Where living water breaks the wells. Not just the fly but to become one with the father. Spirit son. This is liberty. The world cannot see. The holy blood that purchased me. So let me fly but not alone. I mount the wings that lead me home. Beyond the eagle's elevated heights to where my savior and king awaits. This is my freedom, pure and true. Not just to fly, but to be made new. Lord bless you. [Applause]
