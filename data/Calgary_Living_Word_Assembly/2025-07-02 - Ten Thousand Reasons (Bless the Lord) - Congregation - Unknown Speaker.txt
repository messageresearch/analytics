[Music] Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Oh my soul. Worship his holy name. Sing like never before. Oh my soul, I worship your holy name. Oh, the sun comes up. It's a new day dawn. It's time to sing your song again. Whatever may pass. And whatever lies before us, let me be singing when the evening comes. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul. Oh my soul, worship his holy name. Sing like never before. Oh my soul, I'll worship your holy name. Oh, you're rich in love and you're slow to. Your name is great and your heart is kind. For all your goodness I will keep on singing. and thousand praises for my heart to find. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul. Oh my soul, worship his holy name. Sing like never before. Oh my soul, I worship your holy name. Oh bless Lord, oh my soul, my soul, I worship your holy name. Sing like never before. Oh my soul, I worship your holy name. Oh bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul, I worship your holy name. Sing like never before. Oh my soul, I worship your holy name. [Music]
