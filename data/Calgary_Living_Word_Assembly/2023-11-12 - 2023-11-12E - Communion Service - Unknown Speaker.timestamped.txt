[1:05:21] encouraging for me to see the build
[1:05:24] almost as full tonight as it was this
[1:05:26] morning Hallelujah that just does
[1:05:28] something to meise doesn't show that

[1:05:32] you're you're obeying me it shows that
[1:05:34] you're obeying the word of God and that
[1:05:37] means something tonight we just would
[1:05:39] like to while we have everyone standing
[1:05:42] we just want to invite brother Aiden to
[1:05:44] be Anointed with oil and we'd like to
[1:05:46] invite all of the elders in the church
[1:05:48] to come forward tonight there a request
[1:05:51] that brother Aiden had to be Anointed
[1:05:53] with
[1:05:55] oil we know that
[1:05:58] James
[1:05:59] 5:14 it says is any sick among you let
[1:06:03] him call for the Elders of the church
[1:06:06] and let them pray over him amen
[1:06:09] anointing him with oil in the name of
[1:06:11] the Lord yes not in the name of the
[1:06:14] church not in the name of our families
[1:06:17] not in the name of our ideas or even our
[1:06:20] Idols but in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:23] Christ yes so tonight we just are so
[1:06:27] thrilled to be able to stand with our
[1:06:29] brother and just apply the word tonight
[1:06:32] and we know the oil typifies the Holy
[1:06:35] Ghost and tonight we just want to just
[1:06:38] take a moment to pray for our dear

[1:06:43] move mightily in his life because he's
[1:06:46] willing to take the Lord at his word he
[1:06:48] just wants to take the Lord at his word
[1:06:50] we know brother bradam in the seven
[1:06:51] Church age book the exposition of the
[1:06:53] seven Church age he says that if we
[1:06:55] really understood this scripture here if
[1:06:57] we were sick then we would just call the
[1:06:58] Elders get anointed and that would be
[1:07:01] that and I believe brother Aiden
[1:07:03] believes that
[1:07:04] tonight so we're just going to apply
[1:07:06] that exactly the way that we have

[1:10:30] you you have your Bibles tonight just
[1:10:33] like to read from John chapter
[1:10:36] 6 try not to be
[1:10:39] long have many people here and there
[1:10:42] might be many testimonies we would like
[1:10:45] to ask if you do have a testimony please
[1:10:47] just try and keep it short just for
[1:10:50] time's sake I know sometimes it's not
[1:10:52] always possible but we want to give
[1:10:54] everyone an opportunity if you have a
[1:10:55] testimony of what the Lord's done for
[1:10:58] you
[1:11:00] so uh John chapter
[1:11:03] 6 we'll start reading with verse
[1:11:08] 48 John chapter
[1:11:11] 6 St John chapter 6 verse
[1:11:17] 48 Jesus speaking here and he's speaking
[1:11:22] to his disciples as well well as all of
[1:11:25] the religious people of the day I just
[1:11:28] love that he says I am the bread of
[1:11:32] life your fathers did eat Mana in the
[1:11:35] wilderness and are
[1:11:37] dead this is the bread which cometh down
[1:11:40] from heaven that a man may eat thereof
[1:11:43] and not
[1:11:44] die and we know as we read this I just
[1:11:47] want to throw this in there we know that
[1:11:49] the religious ones were looking at this
[1:11:52] through natural eyes when they should
[1:11:54] have been the ones looking at this
[1:11:55] through spiritual eyes they should have
[1:11:58] been looking at this one saying what is
[1:12:00] he saying and we know the disciples
[1:12:02] didn't say anything they just let him
[1:12:04] talk he goes on to say this is the bread
[1:12:07] which cometh down from heaven that a man
[1:12:10] may eat thereof and not die I am the
[1:12:12] living bread which came down from heaven
[1:12:15] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[1:12:18] live forever and the bread that I will
[1:12:21] give is my flesh which I will give for
[1:12:25] the life of the world Amen the Jews
[1:12:29] therefore strove amongst themselves
[1:12:31] saying how can this man give us his
[1:12:33] flesh to eat and you have to remember
[1:12:36] now the true Hebrews they weren't even
[1:12:39] allowed to touch a dead
[1:12:42] body without having to cleanse the law
[1:12:46] of Moses had a very strict guideline for
[1:12:50] them so it's really no wonder they were
[1:12:53] striving that way and we know that they
[1:12:55] were veiled for our sake but he goes on
[1:12:59] to say in verse 53 then Jesus said unto
[1:13:01] them verily verily I say unto you except
[1:13:05] ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[1:13:07] drink his blood ye have no life in you
[1:13:09] who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:13:11] blood hath eternal life and I will raise
[1:13:14] him up at the last day for my flesh is
[1:13:17] meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
[1:13:21] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:13:23] my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as
[1:13:28] the living father hath sent me and I
[1:13:30] live by the father so he that eateth me
[1:13:35] even he shall live by me this is the
[1:13:40] bread which came down from heaven not as
[1:13:43] your fathers did eat mana and are dead
[1:13:47] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[1:13:50] forever amen let's just bow one more
[1:13:53] time time Heavenly Father we've just
[1:13:55] read about this bread father we know
[1:13:58] that you're the bread of life and we
[1:13:59] pray that you would just break it open
[1:14:01] fresh to us once again that Lord when we
[1:14:04] approach this table tonight we would
[1:14:06] recognize the gravity of this situation
[1:14:08] Lord father we love you and we thank you
[1:14:11] we just Commit This reading of the word
[1:14:13] into your hands and the remainder of
[1:14:15] this service in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:14:17] we pray amen God bless you tonight you
[1:14:19] may be
[1:14:21] seated I don't have any announcements
[1:14:24] tonight I just want to get right into it
[1:14:27] I just think it's amazing when we look
[1:14:28] at this this this scripture here Jesus
[1:14:32] instructed all of the people to eat his
[1:14:35] flesh and drink his blood speaking
[1:14:37] naturally to them and and they because
[1:14:40] of their laws because of their
[1:14:41] Traditions they had to say wow how can
[1:14:44] we ever do this this man is crazy this
[1:14:47] is a Madman that we're dealing with here
[1:14:49] we knew that he was weird but now we
[1:14:51] know he's a Madman because he's asking
[1:14:53] us to go exactly against the law of
[1:14:55] Moses but yet he claims to be a
[1:14:58] religious leader and and you know I
[1:15:01] don't think that he claimed it not until
[1:15:03] a little bit later on he did claim it
[1:15:05] but we know that the people declared it
[1:15:07] and usually that's the case isn't it the
[1:15:09] people begin to declare something and
[1:15:11] cause people to actually fit into a
[1:15:13] certain category but with Jesus here his
[1:15:16] disciples brother Bram said they didn't
[1:15:18] know what to think so they just sat
[1:15:20] quiet but we know that some of the other
[1:15:22] people that were there they thought that
[1:15:24] when Jesus died that because he said
[1:15:27] this scripture here that they went and
[1:15:29] took his body and actually cut pieces of
[1:15:31] his body off and actually went and ate
[1:15:32] it I was scrambling to try and find that
[1:15:35] quote but I couldn't find it I I I think
[1:15:37] it's in possessing the gates of the
[1:15:38] enemy I'm not sure I'll find it if
[1:15:40] anybody's interested but brother Bram
[1:15:43] says that that that they got so carnal
[1:15:45] they thought that that's what he was
[1:15:47] actually telling the disciples to do but
[1:15:49] that wasn't what he was saying at all he
[1:15:50] was saying he that heareth my word and
[1:15:52] believe believeth on me he they'll
[1:15:54] they'll they'll actually have eternal
[1:15:56] life it's not something that can just
[1:15:59] come without actually receiving him but
[1:16:01] you have to receive the word and
[1:16:04] understand that that word is actually
[1:16:05] the Bread of Heaven I think it's
[1:16:07] beautiful because the fathers that were
[1:16:08] in the wilderness they were given mana
[1:16:10] and all they had to do was go out and
[1:16:11] collect it they just had to collect
[1:16:13] enough for that day and that was it and
[1:16:16] then the next day go and collect enough
[1:16:17] for that day and the next day collect
[1:16:19] enough for that day and not take any
[1:16:21] more don't have any extra don't try and
[1:16:23] and do anything different than what the
[1:16:25] word said he said just take enough for
[1:16:27] your day for your family and that's all
[1:16:29] and if you tried to it's spoiled yes but
[1:16:33] we know that many people even though
[1:16:35] they had that Heavenly food they still
[1:16:37] had to do what they had to murmur and
[1:16:38] say oh my goodness if we could just have
[1:16:41] some garlic sausage like we had back in
[1:16:44] Egypt back when we were slaves and many
[1:16:47] times in our lives we can have the word
[1:16:49] of God that that Heavenly gift that
[1:16:51] Heavenly Mana that comes down but still
[1:16:53] have the desire for something different
[1:16:56] but you know once you actually do eat
[1:16:58] his flesh and drink his blood you
[1:17:02] understand that there's no more life
[1:17:03] inside of us it's his life that lives
[1:17:05] out through us we're actually consuming
[1:17:08] the Lord's body we're doing what he told
[1:17:10] us to do we'll get into that scripture
[1:17:11] later when we uh proceed into the
[1:17:14] communion service but I just have two
[1:17:15] quotes that I want to read tonight I
[1:17:17] think it's it's it's just worth worth
[1:17:19] talking about out of 19593
[1:17:24] 31e what Dost thou
[1:17:27] here he says that doesn't need any
[1:17:31] explaining and he's talking about the
[1:17:33] scripture that we read in
[1:17:35] Corinthians how the Lord he he took the
[1:17:37] bread and and break it and and gave it
[1:17:40] to his disciples and said take eat this
[1:17:42] is my body we're going to read that but
[1:17:43] this is what brother badam is talking
[1:17:45] about here he says that doesn't need any
[1:17:47] explaining it's just this if we eat and
[1:17:50] drink unworthily we eat and drink
[1:17:52] damnation to our own self not Discerning
[1:17:55] the Lord's body for this cause many are
[1:17:58] weakly and sick among you and many are
[1:18:02] dead see when we come to take communion
[1:18:04] how could you be dead and come and take
[1:18:07] communion how can that be you can't walk
[1:18:10] when you're dead can you but he's
[1:18:12] talking about something else isn't he
[1:18:14] he's talking about spiritual death
[1:18:16] people that just don't ever believe they
[1:18:17] can't believe but yet they just go
[1:18:19] through the motions it's just a religion
[1:18:20] it's just what they've been taught to do
[1:18:22] so they just do it that's all it's not
[1:18:24] real to them tonight I'm so thankful as
[1:18:27] I said to see the church almost full of
[1:18:29] people that believe because I trust
[1:18:31] we're all believers here tonight I I
[1:18:33] trust that all the unbelievers and the
[1:18:35] make Believers are elsewhere they're not
[1:18:37] here because it's not going to do you
[1:18:39] any good if you're a make believer or an
[1:18:41] unbeliever it's actually going to cause
[1:18:42] you damnation it's not going to cause
[1:18:44] anybody else in the body it's just going
[1:18:46] to be you that's what the word of God
[1:18:47] says you'll eat and drink damnation to
[1:18:50] your own selves not to serve in the
[1:18:53] Lord's body for this cause many are
[1:18:55] weakly and sick among you and many are
[1:18:58] dead sometimes you see people that have
[1:19:01] continual problems in their lives and
[1:19:04] and and maybe it's not a sickness in the
[1:19:06] body maybe it's just continual problems
[1:19:08] stumbling tripping falling could never
[1:19:10] seem to get the victory you got to be
[1:19:13] able to just worthily partake of the
[1:19:16] Lord's body and you know sometimes we
[1:19:20] don't feel like it sometimes we might
[1:19:22] not feel like it and if we actually
[1:19:24] don't do it because we don't feel like
[1:19:26] it then we're giv Satan the victory
[1:19:29] because he's going to do everything he
[1:19:30] can to throw banana peels in our way to
[1:19:33] try and get us to slip up and not come
[1:19:34] and take communion he doesn't care how
[1:19:36] we feel so long as we don't take
[1:19:38] communion but boy if we don't feel like
[1:19:40] doing it and we know in our heart that
[1:19:42] we've asked God to forgive us and we
[1:19:44] don't have odd against a brother come
[1:19:46] and take it it gives a victory to the
[1:19:49] Christian brother BR goes on to say
[1:19:51] every Christian should take community
[1:19:52] Union period it's your
[1:19:56] duty so to be a Christian to claim the
[1:19:59] message of the hour that God sent a
[1:20:01] prophet and I believe everything he said
[1:20:03] and not take communion there's something
[1:20:04] wrong there's something not lining up
[1:20:07] with that experience and I I I I just
[1:20:10] like I said I'm so thankful to see
[1:20:12] everyone here tonight God richly bless
[1:20:13] you I believe he will I believe he
[1:20:15] already has and that's why you're here
[1:20:17] it's such a wonderful thing he says it's
[1:20:20] your duty it's a showdown
[1:20:23] see Jesus said if you don't take it you
[1:20:26] have no part in me that is strong words
[1:20:30] to think we could just stay home and not
[1:20:32] take communion Jesus said you have no
[1:20:34] part in me now some people might say
[1:20:37] well we just take communion at home
[1:20:38] brother Berry we just make our own bread
[1:20:40] and we just get our own wine and we just
[1:20:41] do our own thing and if that's the case
[1:20:44] that's you know I I'm not going to say
[1:20:46] anything about that I I just think that
[1:20:48] the Believers gather together and have
[1:20:50] communion with other believers amen I I
[1:20:53] just believe that's the way it is that's
[1:20:54] the way the prophet of God instructed he
[1:20:57] goes on to say but he that eateth and
[1:20:59] drinketh unworthily eats and drinks
[1:21:01] damnation to himself that is if you're
[1:21:04] still out with the world and doing
[1:21:06] things of the world and people see you
[1:21:09] taking communion you're doing
[1:21:12] wrong it's important brothers and
[1:21:14] sisters nowadays we've got so many
[1:21:17] distractions maybe we're not out in the
[1:21:19] world in the
[1:21:20] barroom maybe we're in a virtual room
[1:21:24] maybe we're just doing things that are
[1:21:26] worldly but with
[1:21:28] Believers and what does that look like
[1:21:31] for other believers that see that does
[1:21:33] that make it right because it's
[1:21:35] Believers doing worldly things I'm just
[1:21:38] going to leave it there I'm not going to
[1:21:39] say another word about that but he that
[1:21:42] eateth and drinketh unworthily eats and
[1:21:44] drinks damnation to himself remember
[1:21:47] that Satan is Crafty Satan is cunning
[1:21:51] Satan is a liar he is a deceiver and he
[1:21:54] will not come in through the gates
[1:21:56] yelling and screaming he will come in
[1:21:58] the back door if we let our guards down
[1:22:01] and eat and drink unworthily if we come
[1:22:04] to this table unworthily then we eat and
[1:22:06] drink dnation to ourselves we might not
[1:22:08] be eating and drinking damnation to
[1:22:09] ourselves necessarily but we could be
[1:22:11] bringing it into our
[1:22:13] families right that's the way the devil
[1:22:16] works but if we do it worthily watch out
[1:22:20] Satan you got no room here
[1:22:23] this Fortress Is sure we can make sure
[1:22:26] that we apply the token and we know that
[1:22:28] it always goes back to that we've got to
[1:22:30] know that that token is sure in our
[1:22:32] lives in our homes because that's what
[1:22:34] eating and drinking worthily
[1:22:36] is he says that's if you're still out
[1:22:39] with the world and doing things of the
[1:22:40] world and people see you taking
[1:22:43] communion you're doing wrong you're only
[1:22:46] bringing disgrace to you and it'll only
[1:22:49] harm you it isn't that will harm God
[1:22:53] it'll harm you and so a person should
[1:22:57] examine themselves their selves and
[1:23:00] before we approach this sacred moment
[1:23:04] you ask God to search my life and if
[1:23:06] I've done anything that's not right
[1:23:08] forgive me for it I don't mean to do it
[1:23:12] I'll make it right if he'll reveal it to
[1:23:15] me and I'll ask the same thing for you
[1:23:18] said when you come together Terry one
[1:23:20] for another that is wait on one another
[1:23:24] and pray for one another we want to take
[1:23:27] this
[1:23:28] communion and if we don't do it we have
[1:23:31] no part in
[1:23:33] him I think that's so alarming if we
[1:23:36] don't do it if we don't come to
[1:23:37] communion service we have no part in
[1:23:40] him that's what he said we know that's
[1:23:43] in St John the 6th chapter that's where
[1:23:45] we were tonight and and we know that
[1:23:48] we've come to take communion so I'm not
[1:23:50] trying to lay this on us and such a way
[1:23:53] that we feel bad because we're here to
[1:23:54] take it I want to say it in such a way
[1:23:56] that we can Rejoice because this is a
[1:23:58] revelation brothers and sisters to come
[1:24:00] and take communion people can say it and
[1:24:02] say it and say it but if we don't
[1:24:03] actually understand what it means why it
[1:24:06] was instituted why the Lord Jesus Took
[1:24:08] bread that night and broke it and said
[1:24:11] this is my body take it and eat it and
[1:24:14] do this in remembrance of me until I
[1:24:16] return again don't ever stop doing it
[1:24:19] continue to do it don't say I've done it
[1:24:22] once a year and I'm good that's a
[1:24:23] religious tradition I've done it once in
[1:24:26] six months I'm good I've done it once in
[1:24:28] my life I'm good no do it as often as
[1:24:32] you
[1:24:33] will in 1964
[1:24:36] 0306 a greater than Solomon is here
[1:24:39] now in this in this speech that Jesus
[1:24:44] had in John chapter 6 I think it's so
[1:24:47] beautiful he didn't explain it to the
[1:24:49] people what he wanted to do was thin out
[1:24:51] the crowd because there's a lot of
[1:24:53] people that really like the tremendous
[1:24:55] Ministry that love the wonderful
[1:24:57] meetings that love the buzz that was
[1:24:58] going around because there was these
[1:25:00] Mighty signs and wonders the first and
[1:25:02] second PS of his ministry were happening
[1:25:04] it was wonderful to be around it but
[1:25:07] there came a point in time where he knew
[1:25:08] it was too busy there was people there
[1:25:10] that really were getting in the way of
[1:25:12] the of the true gems of the the children
[1:25:14] of God really being able to catch the
[1:25:17] revelations that they were supposed to
[1:25:19] and and we know that here he says
[1:25:21] brother br he's talking about this
[1:25:23] scripture he says he never explained it
[1:25:26] he didn't have to explain it he had to
[1:25:29] shake off the parasites that was around
[1:25:32] him brothers and sisters what's a
[1:25:35] parasite it's an organism that lives off
[1:25:37] the life of another
[1:25:40] organism right he had to shake off those
[1:25:43] parasites right and and I would say
[1:25:45] those Devils he had to just get rid of
[1:25:47] them he had to shake them off that was
[1:25:49] around him instead of trying to baby and
[1:25:51] put their their name in a book he was
[1:25:54] shaking them away he had no re reuse for
[1:25:58] them so we find out there he was he said
[1:26:02] except he never explained it watch those
[1:26:06] disciples sat
[1:26:08] still they never said nothing many times
[1:26:11] it's like that sometimes we don't
[1:26:13] understand things that we hear don't say
[1:26:15] anything if you don't understand it
[1:26:17] don't say anything just ask God Lord
[1:26:20] help me understand that that's what we
[1:26:21] need to say if we don't hear something
[1:26:23] and we don't understand it just say Lord
[1:26:24] help me understand that sometimes you
[1:26:26] might have to go and say brother Barry
[1:26:27] what did you say here why'd you say it
[1:26:29] that way what' you mean how did you mean
[1:26:30] that and you know we can reconcile
[1:26:32] together that's what the word of God
[1:26:33] says we could we can sit down and we can
[1:26:35] reason together according to the word of
[1:26:38] God but those those disciples they never
[1:26:40] said nothing they knew that Jesus was
[1:26:42] actually saying stuff that was really
[1:26:44] hard speech because remember that was
[1:26:46] against the law for
[1:26:48] them brother bam says I see the doctor
[1:26:51] and I see the Pharisee
[1:26:52] said see the man he's out of his
[1:26:56] mind he's
[1:26:57] crazy he wants us to cut up his body now
[1:27:00] and eat it and drink his
[1:27:03] blood human
[1:27:06] vampire well we couldn't do a thing like
[1:27:08] that oh that's crazy the man is out of
[1:27:12] his mind and walked away and you know we
[1:27:16] know the story he said to his disciples
[1:27:18] will you go also and and Peter once
[1:27:20] again having those those those
[1:27:22] tremendous Revelations he said to whom
[1:27:24] would we go who who who else has the the
[1:27:27] words of Life who is going to give us
[1:27:29] this encouragement that we need where
[1:27:31] would we go but Naturally Speaking
[1:27:33] without Revelation he was out of his
[1:27:35] mind wasn't he I think it's beautiful
[1:27:38] tonight brothers and sisters when we
[1:27:39] come and we eat this bread it's not
[1:27:41] bread it's not a bread that a sister
[1:27:44] with the Holy Ghost just put together
[1:27:45] and and made according to the tradition
[1:27:47] that some some prophet of God said this
[1:27:49] is actually the Lord's body here this is
[1:27:51] exact L what he instructed us to do
[1:27:54] 2,000 years ago with his disciples in
[1:27:56] that upper room that he told them to go
[1:27:58] and set up for that last supper and you
[1:28:00] know many people celebrate the Last
[1:28:02] Supper they'd have the tremendous
[1:28:03] paintings of the Last Supper but you
[1:28:05] know I I want to say those people who
[1:28:07] are willing to come and partake of the
[1:28:08] Lord's body and and get down and wash
[1:28:11] one another's feet and and and honor the
[1:28:14] Lord Jesus Christ in the ordinances that
[1:28:16] he's given you know blessed are your
[1:28:18] eyes for they see the things of God
[1:28:20] blessed are your ears for they're able
[1:28:21] to hear and and you know to have a heart
[1:28:23] to be able to receive this word to have
[1:28:25] the desire to come out on a on a Sunday
[1:28:28] evening to do this something tremendous
[1:28:30] is in store for you brothers and sisters
[1:28:33] and I just think it's beautiful so
[1:28:35] encouraging for every one of us I'm sure
[1:28:37] to see that there's Believers here these
[1:28:39] are our brothers and sisters of like
[1:28:41] Precious Faith it's not coming to church
[1:28:44] on Sunday morning and seeing it full
[1:28:46] house and then come to church in the
[1:28:48] evening where there's a communion
[1:28:49] service where we're all believers of the
[1:28:51] message of the hour but there's only a
[1:28:52] few people how does that work it's so
[1:28:56] beautiful I'm celebrating tonight I'm
[1:28:59] encouraging tonight brothers and sisters
[1:29:01] I want to say God richly bless you and I
[1:29:03] know he will for you taking him at his
[1:29:06] word this isn't brother Barry's word
[1:29:08] this isn't anybody else's word except
[1:29:09] for the word of God oh my says I see the
[1:29:13] doctor and see the Pharisees said see
[1:29:14] the man is out of his mind he's crazy
[1:29:17] wants us to cut up his body now and eat
[1:29:19] it and drink his blood human vampire
[1:29:22] well we couldn't do a thing like that oh
[1:29:24] that's crazy the man is out of his mind
[1:29:25] and they just walked away and he never
[1:29:27] explained he didn't call him back and
[1:29:29] baby him like brother Bram said then he
[1:29:31] looked around to those theologians
[1:29:33] sitting around him them 70 and he said
[1:29:36] what will you say when you see the son
[1:29:39] of man ascending up into heaven from
[1:29:41] whence he
[1:29:42] came them doctors of divinity looking
[1:29:45] around said the son of man Ascend up
[1:29:47] into heaven from where he
[1:29:48] came from a stinking stable a Manger a
[1:29:53] manure
[1:29:54] pile my goodness why we know him we've
[1:29:58] been to the stable where he was born we
[1:30:00] seen the Cradle he was rocked in we know
[1:30:03] his
[1:30:04] mother we he fishes with us he hunts
[1:30:07] with us he's out here on the Hills he
[1:30:10] wears the clothes that we do eat the
[1:30:12] food and this son of man where did he
[1:30:15] come from come from
[1:30:18] Nazareth this is too much for us and
[1:30:21] away they went
[1:30:23] he still didn't explain it see you know
[1:30:26] brothers and sisters when we look at one
[1:30:27] another it's the same thing today if
[1:30:30] you've got the Holy Ghost which I
[1:30:32] believe you do that's why you're here
[1:30:34] tonight we're looking at the son of man
[1:30:37] ministry right here this literally is
[1:30:40] the son of man Ministry and it's a
[1:30:42] Ministry to the total lost the rest of
[1:30:44] the world out there would say you're
[1:30:45] doing what tonight you're going to do
[1:30:48] what you're going to wash someone's feet
[1:30:51] are you
[1:30:53] crazy it is to the world it's crazy but
[1:30:57] to those people who really believe the
[1:30:58] word of God they'll say you know what
[1:31:00] the word of God says happy are ye if you
[1:31:02] do these
[1:31:04] things it's not something that we just
[1:31:06] make
[1:31:08] up I think it's absolutely beautiful
[1:31:10] tonight brothers and sisters I just want
[1:31:12] to encourage you and say God richly
[1:31:13] bless you because I know there's a
[1:31:15] blessing in store for each one who's
[1:31:17] willing to take God at his word and we
[1:31:20] know sometimes there's things that come
[1:31:21] up in our lives we we just can't make it
[1:31:23] to communion service I'm not judging
[1:31:25] that but it's when we actually live our
[1:31:27] lives in another realm we live our lives
[1:31:30] in another vein we claim the message of
[1:31:32] the hour but yet we still don't actually
[1:31:34] live the life it's strange how does that
[1:31:38] work things just don't add up we just
[1:31:41] want to pray that all of our brothers
[1:31:42] and sisters would catch the Revelation
[1:31:44] that they would be able to partake of
[1:31:46] the Lord's body that they would be able
[1:31:47] to wash one another's feet that there
[1:31:49] would be nothing that would hinder us
[1:31:51] from coming and taking part in this
[1:31:53] because as every one of us knows you
[1:31:55] know when we leave the building here
[1:31:57] tonight we're on fire we know that we've
[1:32:00] done the right thing we know that we
[1:32:01] followed the word of God the will of the
[1:32:03] Lord for our day so tonight brothers and
[1:32:06] sisters I just want to say God richly
[1:32:07] bless you I'm certainly encouraged and
[1:32:10] uh we'll just change the order of the
[1:32:12] service now we'll go to the communion
[1:32:14] portion I'll invite the brothers to come
[1:32:16] to the front if you don't mind standing
[1:32:18] with me we'll call Brother Joel to play
[1:32:21] the
[1:32:23] piano when we
[1:32:26] prepare if you have your
[1:32:32] Bibles turn with me over to First
[1:32:42] Corinthians and we'll just read the
[1:32:45] scripture the story from the Last Supper
[1:32:48] that we're referring
[1:32:50] to
[1:32:54] it's so beautiful because we can see
[1:32:56] that this just lines up we know when
[1:32:58] we're following the word because it
[1:33:00] lines up the instruction lines up with
[1:33:02] the word of
[1:33:04] God John chapter 6 is what he's talking
[1:33:07] about right here living
[1:33:09] it verse 23 of 1 Corinthians chap
[1:33:14] 11 it says for I have received of the
[1:33:17] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:33:20] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:33:23] in which he was betrayed took
[1:33:26] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:33:28] break it and said take
[1:33:32] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:33:36] you this do in remembrance of
[1:33:40] me after the same manner also he took
[1:33:43] the cup when he had s saying this cup is
[1:33:47] the New Testament in my
[1:33:49] blood this do ye
[1:33:52] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:33:54] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:33:57] and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's
[1:34:00] death till he
[1:34:01] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:34:04] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:34:06] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:34:09] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:34:12] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:34:14] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:34:18] that eateth and drinketh
[1:34:20] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:34:23] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:34:26] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:34:30] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:34:34] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:34:37] be judged but when we are judged we are
[1:34:40] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:34:42] be condemned with the
[1:34:44] world wherefore my brethren when ye come
[1:34:48] together to eat t one for another and if
[1:34:51] any man hunger let him eat at home that
[1:34:55] you come not together unto
[1:34:58] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:35:00] order when I come let's just take a
[1:35:03] moment or two and T one for
[1:35:20] another
