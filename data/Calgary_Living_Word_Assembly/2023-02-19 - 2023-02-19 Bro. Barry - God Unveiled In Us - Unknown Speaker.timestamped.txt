[1:01:14] sovereignly we pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:01:17] name amen amen God bless you this
[1:01:21] morning thank you musicians you have
[1:01:24] your Bibles today
[1:01:25] I'd like to take a little bit of a
[1:01:27] different
[1:01:28] Direction Maybe
[1:01:32] maybe uh
[1:01:35] familiar one
[1:01:38] to some
[1:01:43] story second Corinthians chapter three
[1:01:47] if you don't mind turning there
[1:01:52] second Corinthians chapter 3
[1:02:04] start reading with verse 6.
[1:02:10] who also have made us able Ministers of
[1:02:13] the New Testament
[1:02:16] not of the letter but the spirit
[1:02:19] for the letter killeth but the spirit
[1:02:22] giveth life amen
[1:02:25] but if the ministration of death written
[1:02:27] and engraven in Stones was glorious so
[1:02:30] that the children of Israel could not
[1:02:32] steadfastly behold the face of Moses
[1:02:36] for the glory of his countenance which
[1:02:38] Glory was to be done away
[1:02:40] how shall not the ministration of the
[1:02:42] spirit be rather glorious
[1:02:45] for if the administration
[1:02:47] of condemnation be glory
[1:02:50] much more doth administration of
[1:02:53] righteousness exceed in glory
[1:02:57] or even that which was made glorious had
[1:03:01] no glory in this respect
[1:03:03] by reason of the glory that excellith
[1:03:08] or if that which is done away was
[1:03:11] glorious
[1:03:12] much more that which with that which
[1:03:15] remaineth is glorious
[1:03:18] seeing then that we have such hope we
[1:03:22] use great plainness of speech
[1:03:25] and not as Moses which put a veil over
[1:03:28] his face that the children of Israel
[1:03:31] could not steadfastly look to the end of
[1:03:34] that which is abolished
[1:03:37] but their minds were blinded
[1:03:40] For unto this day remaineth the same
[1:03:42] Veil untaken away
[1:03:45] in the reading of the Old Testament
[1:03:47] which Veil is done away in Christ
[1:03:51] but even unto this day when Moses is
[1:03:55] read the veil is upon their heart
[1:03:59] nevertheless when it shall be turned to
[1:04:02] the Lord the veil shall be taken away
[1:04:06] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:04:09] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:04:12] Liberty
[1:04:13] but we all with open face beholding as
[1:04:17] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:04:21] changed into the same image from glory
[1:04:24] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:04:28] Lord
[1:04:29] let's just bow in prayer
[1:04:31] gracious Heavenly Father we're so
[1:04:33] thankful for your word we're so thankful
[1:04:36] for the promise Lord
[1:04:38] Lord we know that the children of Israel
[1:04:41] were blinded for our sakes Lord Jesus
[1:04:45] and father what an amazing promise it is
[1:04:48] to know that we are being changed from
[1:04:51] glory to glory father we came from you
[1:04:54] Lord Jesus and we are going back to you
[1:04:57] father we're so thankful for your word
[1:04:59] we pray that you would Quicken it father
[1:05:01] with your spirit to our very Souls today
[1:05:03] Lord that when we leave this building we
[1:05:06] would say truly that our hearts burned
[1:05:08] within us because you spoke to us along
[1:05:10] the way
[1:05:11] father I pray that I would be able to
[1:05:13] step aside and just give you the
[1:05:15] preeminence Lord that you would speak to
[1:05:17] us today in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:05:20] amen God bless you this morning you may
[1:05:22] be seated
[1:05:27] just a couple of announcements we wanted
[1:05:28] to mention
[1:05:30] we have the trustees meeting coming up
[1:05:32] this week
[1:05:34] um we have Jim Knight coming up as well
[1:05:38] on Friday
[1:05:39] we will certainly text out some details
[1:05:41] we did to the youth but we'll text it
[1:05:43] out to everyone so we have all of the
[1:05:45] particulars
[1:05:47] uh for Friday night it will be a fun
[1:05:49] time so if you want to get together and
[1:05:52] just have a little bit of fun maybe
[1:05:54] sweat a little bit it's a it's a good
[1:05:56] time
[1:05:57] um so 24th we'll have gym night
[1:06:01] on the 26th next Sunday we're actually
[1:06:03] going to have brother Tony oh gerbesa
[1:06:06] take the service
[1:06:08] it'll truly be a privilege to have him
[1:06:10] take the service and then in the evening
[1:06:12] we'll have a communion foot washing
[1:06:14] as per the schedule
[1:06:16] just wanted to mention the annual men's
[1:06:18] meeting we have moved it from the 28th
[1:06:21] which we had scheduled originally to the
[1:06:23] 27th we had some scheduling conflicts so
[1:06:26] we had to move it we really didn't have
[1:06:28] a choice
[1:06:29] so if you'll just bear with us
[1:06:32] if anybody has an issue with that maybe
[1:06:34] come and see me
[1:06:36] um I don't know how we can really get
[1:06:37] around it though but
[1:06:39] that's the way it is so Lord willing
[1:06:41] will aim for Monday the 27th for that
[1:06:44] meeting
[1:06:45] it would be the same time in the same
[1:06:46] place we'll meet at the church
[1:06:48] be happy this morning
[1:06:51] scripture that we read this morning
[1:06:53] second Corinthians chapter 3
[1:06:56] we have Paul writing a letter to the
[1:06:58] Corinthians we know full well and uh
[1:07:01] it's such a an interesting thought
[1:07:05] speaking about how the
[1:07:07] the children of Israel they reverenced
[1:07:10] the stones that that Moses brought down
[1:07:14] off the mountain they reverenced the law
[1:07:16] we know that it was the Ten Commandments
[1:07:19] it was the the direction that God gave
[1:07:22] Moses when he went up onto the holy
[1:07:24] mount
[1:07:25] and that was the time where the children
[1:07:26] of Israel said you know don't let God
[1:07:28] speak lest we die
[1:07:30] speak to us through a man and we know
[1:07:32] that that's where prophets came into the
[1:07:35] into the scene onto the stage
[1:07:38] for God's Great drama
[1:07:40] and brother Branham talks about it as uh
[1:07:43] changing of a mask and he talks about
[1:07:46] how God used people throughout the ages
[1:07:48] and so some of you might understand
[1:07:50] where I'm going with this today if you
[1:07:52] don't I just want to mention that I'm
[1:07:55] going to be ministering directly from
[1:07:58] the Mighty God unveiled in 1964. brother
[1:08:02] Branham talks about some really
[1:08:04] significant things in there that I think
[1:08:06] is worth mentioning and I just felt led
[1:08:08] to go this way and you know we had
[1:08:10] talked about how we we need to have a
[1:08:13] perfect realization brother Branham in
[1:08:15] the Philadelphia Church age
[1:08:17] he said this we've read this quote a few
[1:08:19] times and I just think it's so so vital
[1:08:21] for us in the day in which we live and
[1:08:23] maybe we're preaching to the choir but
[1:08:25] maybe some people just haven't really
[1:08:28] understood what I meant by this it can
[1:08:30] sound a little bit complicated and maybe
[1:08:31] I'll just read it slow and we'll just go
[1:08:33] through it again here he says these
[1:08:35] things saith he that is true and we know
[1:08:38] that's the spirit the spirit giveth life
[1:08:41] we read that already in the scripture
[1:08:42] here this is Jesus Christ the the white
[1:08:45] wigged one in the beginning of the book
[1:08:47] of Revelation that we have have all read
[1:08:49] he says these things saith he that is
[1:08:52] true now this word true is a very
[1:08:55] wonderful word it does not mean true in
[1:08:57] just the sense that it's the opposite to
[1:08:59] false
[1:09:00] it expresses the perfect realization of
[1:09:05] an idea as contrasted with its partial
[1:09:08] realization
[1:09:10] for example we recall that Jesus said in
[1:09:13] John 6 32 Moses gave you not that bread
[1:09:15] from heaven but my father giveth you the
[1:09:18] true bread from Heaven John 15 1 I am
[1:09:21] the True Vine we have spent some time on
[1:09:24] that one he's not just the vine but he
[1:09:26] is the true vine the only Vine now we
[1:09:30] know brother Branham talked about that
[1:09:31] if that vine ever puts forth another
[1:09:33] Branch if that tree ever puts forth
[1:09:35] another Branch it will be the same as
[1:09:37] the original and really the end of the
[1:09:39] sermon today is very much that that
[1:09:41] branch is putting forth today and what
[1:09:44] that Branch actually is is Christ it's
[1:09:48] not us plus Christ it's not Christ plus
[1:09:50] us it's not an association it's not a
[1:09:52] church it's God himself in flesh brother
[1:09:56] Bradham says it in the in the in the
[1:09:57] church age book unless we get that
[1:09:59] Revelation the Revelation that Jesus
[1:10:02] Christ is God the fullness of the
[1:10:04] godhead bodily then we're lost
[1:10:07] Jesus Christ was God all God he wasn't
[1:10:11] part God and to try and say that he was
[1:10:14] only God at this specific point and and
[1:10:16] a little bit of God at that specific
[1:10:17] point brothers and sisters don't get
[1:10:19] caught up in semantics don't worry about
[1:10:21] that the devil is in the details but the
[1:10:23] spirit of God giveth life
[1:10:26] he says for example we recall that Jesus
[1:10:28] said in John 6 32 Moses gave you not
[1:10:31] that bread from heaven but my father
[1:10:32] giveth you the true bread from Heaven
[1:10:34] John 15 1 I am the True Vine Hebrews 9
[1:10:36] 24 for Christ is not entered into the
[1:10:39] holy places which are which made our
[1:10:42] holy places made with hands which are
[1:10:44] the figures of the true but into heaven
[1:10:47] itself now to appear in the presence of
[1:10:50] God for us John 2 8 because the darkness
[1:10:53] has passed and the True Light now
[1:10:55] shineth since this word indeed expresses
[1:10:59] perfect realization as against the idea
[1:11:03] of partial realization as Illustrated in
[1:11:07] these verses we can Now understand as
[1:11:10] never before anti-type contrasted with
[1:11:12] type and substance with Shadow I believe
[1:11:15] that that speaks directly to the
[1:11:17] scripture that we read this morning out
[1:11:19] of second Corinthians the law being a
[1:11:22] shadow of the grace that was coming
[1:11:24] through Jesus Christ this was is a
[1:11:26] shadow and a type of this grace that we
[1:11:29] have been given today in our lives you
[1:11:32] know we talked about this in the past as
[1:11:33] well last service I think it was all
[1:11:36] that God was he poured into
[1:11:38] the church into Christ sorry
[1:11:41] out of the marriage of the Lamb 1962 he
[1:11:43] says you can be an artificial professed
[1:11:45] Christian but you can't be be a
[1:11:47] Christian until Christ injects himself
[1:11:51] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into
[1:11:53] you
[1:11:55] that's the new birth brothers and
[1:11:56] sisters the new birth isn't saying I
[1:11:59] just accept that Jesus Christ died and
[1:12:01] and rose again I believe that he rose
[1:12:02] again from the dead and now I'm saved
[1:12:04] and it's all good it's not that that's
[1:12:06] not what it is we have to get the
[1:12:08] baptism of the Holy Spirit and what that
[1:12:10] is is coming completely subject to the
[1:12:13] word of God for our day we can have the
[1:12:16] word of God for another day but that
[1:12:18] won't get us the Holy Ghost brothers and
[1:12:19] sisters we could say let's build a boat
[1:12:21] like Noah did and and everybody get
[1:12:23] together and pull our resources and
[1:12:25] build a boat build a ship build a great
[1:12:27] ship in fact I think they've done it in
[1:12:28] Kentucky to do a a replica of it but
[1:12:31] that boat down there isn't going to save
[1:12:33] them and if we all clamored to get on it
[1:12:35] it's not going to save us because the
[1:12:36] baptism of the earth that's going to
[1:12:38] happen now according to the prophet for
[1:12:39] our day the word for our day is going to
[1:12:41] be a baptism of fire and that boat's
[1:12:43] gonna burn it's not going to float the
[1:12:46] only way that we're going to be able to
[1:12:47] pitch ourselves according to the way
[1:12:48] Noah did it is with the Holy Ghost In
[1:12:50] Our Lives that's the only thing and I
[1:12:52] know Paul talks about it that all men's
[1:12:54] work will will be revealed whether it's
[1:12:56] of wood whether it's of straw but if
[1:12:59] it's of the elements the even the
[1:13:00] elements are going to melt with a
[1:13:02] fervent heat but they will become as
[1:13:04] pure as they ever could be
[1:13:06] only his life will live
[1:13:11] he says Christ injects himself by the
[1:13:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost into you then
[1:13:14] you're connected with him and you're not
[1:13:16] you're no longer Twain You're not too
[1:13:19] according to Ephesians chapter five
[1:13:21] we've talked about this so many times on
[1:13:22] Wednesday I think that it might be
[1:13:24] getting tiring to some extent but Paul
[1:13:27] says at the end of that chapter he's not
[1:13:30] talking about a husband and a wife he's
[1:13:32] actually talking about the mystery of
[1:13:33] Christ in his bride Christ and his bride
[1:13:36] becoming one
[1:13:38] which is exactly what we're talking
[1:13:39] about here Christ promised to be in us
[1:13:42] as the father was in Christ
[1:13:46] can you believe that
[1:13:48] that's pretty hard to believe
[1:13:50] and the reason that for that is because
[1:13:52] we deal with our feelings we're in a a
[1:13:54] body that that contends with feelings
[1:13:57] and emotions and affections we have the
[1:14:00] five outer senses and we have the five
[1:14:02] inner senses and that's really where we
[1:14:04] live but we've got to go beyond that
[1:14:06] we've got to go right into the the
[1:14:08] innermost part of ourselves which is our
[1:14:10] soul that that little tiny space that
[1:14:13] God created for himself and sometimes
[1:14:15] that can be the hardest place to get
[1:14:16] into because we've got so many other
[1:14:19] things in the way on all of those 10
[1:14:21] outer senses they can keep us from being
[1:14:24] able to get in there brother Brown
[1:14:25] preaches that message doors indoor and
[1:14:28] and that very much speaks to that
[1:14:30] sometimes there's one place where we've
[1:14:32] got so much hurt so much problem so much
[1:14:35] issue that we close that door and we
[1:14:37] just build brick wall in front of it and
[1:14:39] we fortify it and nobody is ever going
[1:14:41] to get that door open again we just
[1:14:42] don't ever want to feel that hurt again
[1:14:43] but sometimes we have to sometimes we've
[1:14:46] got to in fact I would say if there is
[1:14:49] something like that in your life you're
[1:14:50] not going to be able to get the true
[1:14:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost until you open
[1:14:54] that door because he doesn't want to
[1:14:56] have a partial residence he doesn't want
[1:14:58] to live in just part of the house he
[1:14:59] wants the whole house the whole entire
[1:15:02] Tabernacle is his
[1:15:04] but he says then you're no longer Twain
[1:15:06] You're one Christ promised to be in us
[1:15:09] as the father was in Christ
[1:15:11] I and my father are one
[1:15:15] you and I are one see Christ in us and
[1:15:19] truly brothers and sisters have we've
[1:15:21] been baptized with the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:15:23] Lives then then we're one
[1:15:26] we're one today we're not many many
[1:15:29] different people all together with many
[1:15:31] different personalities even though we
[1:15:32] are but we need to go beyond that and
[1:15:34] look at one another and say hey I see
[1:15:36] Jesus Christ I'm not willing to look at
[1:15:38] the badger skin and say I don't like the
[1:15:40] way that Brother Talks to me and I don't
[1:15:42] like the way that sister doesn't talk to
[1:15:43] me and and I don't think that this is
[1:15:45] right or that's right with our brother
[1:15:46] or sister if we're doing that then we're
[1:15:48] just doing Satan a favor and we're just
[1:15:50] actually giving him a day off but if we
[1:15:52] can look beyond that and actually say
[1:15:54] you know what I think my sister might
[1:15:56] have said something or my brother might
[1:15:57] have said something but I know they
[1:15:58] didn't mean it because that wasn't truly
[1:16:00] the spirit of God and I believe their
[1:16:02] son and daughter of God I believe that
[1:16:04] they're saved
[1:16:07] remember we talked about in the past
[1:16:09] we're living in the third pole condition
[1:16:12] one day we're going to speak squirrels
[1:16:13] into existence
[1:16:15] Maybe
[1:16:16] or maybe we'll be so thirsty we'll need
[1:16:18] a drink of water and and and maybe our
[1:16:21] children will need a drink of water who
[1:16:22] knows what will happen what the world
[1:16:24] has in store for us many different
[1:16:26] theories and ideas have come out in
[1:16:28] conversation about what that third third
[1:16:31] pole manifestation will be like we know
[1:16:33] brother Bradham says in places that
[1:16:34] limbs missing limbs will be restored
[1:16:37] can you imagine that that's not going to
[1:16:39] be a prophet of God doing it that's
[1:16:41] going to be God doing it
[1:16:43] that's going to be God doing it but
[1:16:44] where is he going to be doing it it's
[1:16:45] going to be doing it in you it's going
[1:16:47] to be doing it to me he's going to be
[1:16:48] doing it us we live in the third pole
[1:16:50] condition but how's he going to do it
[1:16:51] he's going to do it by the spoken word
[1:16:52] right
[1:16:54] how much more detrimental is that spoken
[1:16:57] word if we start talking negative
[1:16:59] if we start giving voice to the enemy
[1:17:02] anything negative is of the Enemy by the
[1:17:04] way
[1:17:05] any negative is of the enemy
[1:17:08] not just a part of it not just or we
[1:17:10] could say well it's truth it's truth so
[1:17:13] it makes it okay to say it does it just
[1:17:15] because it's truth
[1:17:17] I don't know
[1:17:20] I believe that we have the ability to
[1:17:22] actually
[1:17:23] remit sin don't we
[1:17:25] isn't that what the word of God says
[1:17:26] who's ever a sin you remit shall be
[1:17:28] remitted
[1:17:29] we have the ability to do that
[1:17:33] but the battle goes on to say here all
[1:17:34] that God was he poured into Christ and
[1:17:36] all that Christ was he poured into the
[1:17:38] church for a reason and that reason is
[1:17:41] to continue the work of the Gospel then
[1:17:43] we become not by artificial name not by
[1:17:47] an associate church member I'm a part of
[1:17:49] this denomination no
[1:17:51] Brother Brad Thomas says then we become
[1:17:53] not by artificial name but by a reality
[1:17:56] of the Holy Spirit of Life connecting us
[1:18:00] into Christ
[1:18:03] then through the power of his
[1:18:04] resurrection
[1:18:05] we are raised from the dead things of
[1:18:08] the world and setting with him in
[1:18:09] Heavenly places
[1:18:11] and that's where we need to soar
[1:18:13] brothers and sisters we need to go to
[1:18:14] that place where we recognize that it
[1:18:16] doesn't matter what we feel like it
[1:18:17] doesn't matter what we're going through
[1:18:18] we're already seated in Heavenly places
[1:18:20] in Christ Jesus if we have the Holy
[1:18:23] Ghost In Our Lives that's why brother
[1:18:25] Barry just continually harps on getting
[1:18:26] the Holy Ghost we've got to know that we
[1:18:28] have the Holy Ghost in our lives and if
[1:18:30] we do I believe we should be able to
[1:18:32] just say Amen you know brother Bradham
[1:18:34] talks about that old lady that had had
[1:18:36] said to him he was talking having
[1:18:38] fellowship with her whatever and he said
[1:18:40] to her you know how long have you had
[1:18:41] the Holy Ghost sister and she says
[1:18:43] praise God I remember it's been however
[1:18:45] many years we should be able to have
[1:18:47] that kind of conversation without it
[1:18:49] being awkward or weird as Believers we
[1:18:52] have nothing more to celebrate in our
[1:18:53] lives than the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:55] brothers and sisters it should be
[1:18:57] something to Rejoice about
[1:18:59] don't let Satan hang a weapon on you and
[1:19:01] say no you don't got it no you don't
[1:19:03] know if you got it say I got it brother
[1:19:04] Bradham said you you'll never live below
[1:19:07] your Confederate above your confession
[1:19:08] if you say you don't know whether you've
[1:19:10] got it you're given Satan a day off
[1:19:13] say you got it I believe it it's mine
[1:19:15] it's my promise
[1:19:17] we want to have healing in our lives
[1:19:20] brother Bradham says it you got to say
[1:19:21] I'm Healed I believe I've got my healing
[1:19:24] we have to have that confession in our
[1:19:25] lives
[1:19:26] and if we don't have that confession
[1:19:28] what's going to happen
[1:19:31] great
[1:19:34] I think this is just beautiful it's just
[1:19:36] like a bucket of Honey brother bottom
[1:19:37] talks about that story about the Bears
[1:19:39] Ram wrecking his tent getting in there
[1:19:41] and tearing it up
[1:19:43] you know some people will say well
[1:19:44] brother Brad him in one place he said
[1:19:45] that it was a bucket of honey and
[1:19:46] another place he said it was a bucket of
[1:19:48] molasses
[1:19:49] who cares what it was it was sweet and
[1:19:52] it was the word of God he was referring
[1:19:53] to and that's what we want to do
[1:19:55] brothers and sisters is push aside all
[1:19:56] the humanity and just get right into the
[1:19:59] holy of holies today I think I just love
[1:20:01] it when the Lord comes around and
[1:20:03] actually confirms the direction of a
[1:20:06] sermon by the songs that are sung the
[1:20:08] songs that we sang today dovetail with
[1:20:10] what we're talking about today
[1:20:12] you know there's there's there was a
[1:20:14] time where man had the ability to walk
[1:20:16] in the cool of the garden with with God
[1:20:18] Adam was able to just spend time with
[1:20:20] God and and and and and just fellowship
[1:20:23] with him
[1:20:24] but something happened we know the fall
[1:20:27] took place the woman was deceived the
[1:20:30] man wasn't the man stepped out why did
[1:20:33] the man step up because if he didn't
[1:20:34] step out his wife would have been lost
[1:20:36] so he stepped out to redeem his bride
[1:20:39] that's the reason Adam fell it wasn't to
[1:20:42] just go and fall he did it with intent
[1:20:44] within purpose in mind just like Jesus
[1:20:46] Christ stepped out to actually redeem
[1:20:48] his bride
[1:20:50] but man has had a desire since then to
[1:20:52] speak to God he's always desired to
[1:20:54] speak to God
[1:20:56] and you know in Genesis 4 it took until
[1:20:59] Genesis 4 for this to take place the end
[1:21:01] of this chapter Genesis 4 25 and Adam
[1:21:04] knew his wife again and she bear a son
[1:21:06] and called his name Seth for God said
[1:21:07] she hath appointed me
[1:21:10] she hath appointed me another seed
[1:21:12] instead of Abel whom came slow
[1:21:15] and to Seth to him also there was born a
[1:21:18] son and he called his name Enos
[1:21:21] and be and then began men to call on the
[1:21:24] name of the Lord
[1:21:27] I just found this interesting when we
[1:21:28] look at it there was a desire for men to
[1:21:31] speak to God but there seemed to be a
[1:21:33] bit of a lapse in time from when Adam
[1:21:35] and Eve left the Garden of Eden to the
[1:21:38] time they actually had the desire to
[1:21:40] speak to God again
[1:21:42] think about the condemnation that there
[1:21:44] must have been what it must have been
[1:21:45] like
[1:21:46] to no longer be able to fellowship with
[1:21:48] the Lord to just have the the complete
[1:21:53] everything just shut off
[1:21:56] I just I think it's amazing to think
[1:21:58] about
[1:21:59] but you know once upon a time it was
[1:22:02] death
[1:22:03] to actually go back to that tree of life
[1:22:05] wasn't it God put the swords the flaming
[1:22:08] swords in the hands of the Angels at the
[1:22:10] Garden of Eden blocking it from all
[1:22:12] access to mankind but now we know today
[1:22:16] to not go back to that tree of life that
[1:22:18] has been completely exposed and open to
[1:22:20] us and the invitation has been written
[1:22:22] we've been given a written invitation by
[1:22:24] the way haven't we from Jeffersonville
[1:22:26] Indiana we've been given the message of
[1:22:27] the hour and books and tapes it's a
[1:22:29] written invitation to that tree of life
[1:22:31] brothers and sisters whether we see it
[1:22:33] or not it truly is the word of God in
[1:22:35] print form the Bible is is a is a
[1:22:38] written invitation to come right back to
[1:22:40] that tree of life
[1:22:41] we know job he was one who had a desire
[1:22:44] to speak to God Brother Brad him in this
[1:22:45] message he talks about how job desired
[1:22:47] to speak to God but God did not come
[1:22:49] down and actually speak to him face to
[1:22:51] face God came in a whirlwind and we know
[1:22:54] that the brother Brown talks about the
[1:22:56] South Africans they call it a Moya and
[1:22:58] and it's an unseen force that word
[1:23:01] expresses that there's an unseen force
[1:23:03] and God was unseen you could see the the
[1:23:06] Whirlwind but you couldn't see God we
[1:23:08] know in our day brother Bradham when he
[1:23:10] was young he saw that tree and and that
[1:23:12] tree the leaves were were rattling and
[1:23:14] that voice and the Whirlwind and that
[1:23:16] tree spoke to him directly
[1:23:18] God evales himself
[1:23:22] there was a time where people didn't
[1:23:23] want to hear from God we talked about
[1:23:25] that and and and and and just thinking
[1:23:27] about how incredible it is
[1:23:30] how far things drifted from the
[1:23:33] perfection in the Garden of Eden
[1:23:34] so far that the voice of God do you
[1:23:37] think the voice of God changed from the
[1:23:39] Garden of Eden to to the voice of God
[1:23:42] that spoke to the children of Israel did
[1:23:45] that voice change I don't know I'm not
[1:23:47] saying that it did or it didn't but I
[1:23:48] can only imagine because he the word of
[1:23:50] God says that he's the same yesterday
[1:23:51] today and forever I can only imagine
[1:23:53] that it was the same voice but for some
[1:23:55] reason they didn't want to hear his
[1:23:57] voice they only wanted something
[1:23:59] different they wanted a substitute for
[1:24:01] it so God said okay I'll give you a
[1:24:02] substitute but you're still going to
[1:24:03] hear my voice you're not going to have
[1:24:05] excuse on that day to say you didn't
[1:24:07] hear my voice you didn't hear the truth
[1:24:09] for your day so he gave him a prophet he
[1:24:12] raised up a prophet for them to actually
[1:24:14] hear his voice that's Exodus 20 verse 18
[1:24:16] and all the people saw the thunderings
[1:24:18] and the Lightnings and the noise of the
[1:24:19] trumpet and the mountains smoking and
[1:24:21] when the people saw it they removed and
[1:24:23] stood afar off and they said unto Moses
[1:24:26] speak thou with us and we will hear but
[1:24:29] let not God speak with us lest we die
[1:24:31] and we know that that scripture God
[1:24:33] granted it he said okay that's fine
[1:24:35] that's what you want that's what we'll
[1:24:37] do and and so he did just like the
[1:24:39] children of Israel they got into their
[1:24:41] promised land and they started to look
[1:24:42] around and and everything was fine fine
[1:24:45] all their needs were met everything was
[1:24:46] good but they wanted to be like the
[1:24:48] Joneses didn't they they wanted to be
[1:24:49] like the other other nations surrounding
[1:24:52] them they wanted to have a king with
[1:24:54] skin on they they didn't like the idea
[1:24:56] of there just being a prophet in the
[1:24:58] land and you know that's really I think
[1:25:00] in my opinion I don't know I could be
[1:25:02] wrong but I think that's really where
[1:25:04] prophets started to fade off the scene
[1:25:05] where people didn't really want to deal
[1:25:07] with prophets anymore because the only
[1:25:08] thing that prophets did was bring them
[1:25:10] condemnation and judgment the prophets
[1:25:13] they always spoke mean against the
[1:25:14] people especially the Kings they weren't
[1:25:16] afraid to go and put their finger right
[1:25:18] in their nose and say it's not lawful
[1:25:19] for you to do that
[1:25:22] but you know after some time
[1:25:24] after some time Moses he went up on the
[1:25:27] mountain something happened to him
[1:25:29] the people said send them up go ahead
[1:25:31] talk to him don't talk to us nope your
[1:25:34] voice scares us we're gonna die and and
[1:25:36] why is that because they knew they
[1:25:38] weren't right with God they had
[1:25:40] condemnation in their hearts there was
[1:25:42] something wrong with them they didn't
[1:25:44] have that relationship with God so they
[1:25:46] didn't want to hear his voice and it's
[1:25:48] the same thing for us today brothers and
[1:25:50] sisters when we have condemnation in our
[1:25:52] lives we just don't want to hear his
[1:25:54] voice we just don't want to go to church
[1:25:56] we just don't want to press play we just
[1:25:58] don't want to pick up our Bible we just
[1:25:59] don't want to go on our knees and pray
[1:26:01] it's condemnation in our lives but you
[1:26:03] know what we have more than a conqueror
[1:26:06] on our side we have the ability to cut
[1:26:08] through that and you know the moment
[1:26:10] that we do cut through that the moment
[1:26:12] that we cry out to God he's right there
[1:26:14] waiting for us and he's right there
[1:26:16] willing to receive us and all we need to
[1:26:18] do is just give one second of effort
[1:26:21] into it and all of those spirits that
[1:26:23] are trying to afflict us through
[1:26:24] condemnation and all the things that
[1:26:26] we've lived through all of them are
[1:26:28] defeated all of them have to step back
[1:26:30] in the name of Jesus you speak the name
[1:26:32] of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ say
[1:26:35] those words when you're going through
[1:26:37] condemnation and Watch What Happens that
[1:26:39] Veil that's blocking you it will
[1:26:41] actually separate it will move out of
[1:26:43] the way you won't be blocked from
[1:26:45] getting getting attention of God being
[1:26:47] able to talk to him
[1:26:49] but you know for some time
[1:26:51] Moses face glowed when he came down off
[1:26:54] the mountain didn't it
[1:26:55] you know Exodus 34 28 and he was there
[1:26:58] with the Lord 40 days and 40 nights
[1:27:01] he didn't either eat bread nor drink
[1:27:03] water and he wrote upon the tables of
[1:27:05] the words of the Covenant the Ten
[1:27:06] Commandments
[1:27:08] this is the law that we're reading about
[1:27:09] here
[1:27:10] being a foreshadow
[1:27:12] and it came to pass when Moses came down
[1:27:14] from Mount Sinai with the two tables of
[1:27:17] testimony or stone I'll say in Moses
[1:27:19] hand when he came down from the mount
[1:27:22] that Moses wished not that the skin of
[1:27:24] his face Shone while he talked with him
[1:27:27] and we know that Moses actually had to
[1:27:30] put a veil over his face and why did he
[1:27:32] have to do that because of the glory of
[1:27:35] God spending that time in the presence
[1:27:37] of the Lord caused him to radiate and
[1:27:41] brothers and sisters Jesus Christ the
[1:27:42] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:27:44] wasn't just someone different up there
[1:27:45] on the mount that was God himself and
[1:27:48] and the same one when we get in his
[1:27:50] presence you cannot help but radiate
[1:27:52] that same radiation that same Pillar of
[1:27:55] Fire that really the world wants you to
[1:27:58] fail the world can't stand it when you
[1:27:59] get around them and you start to radiate
[1:28:01] that Pillar of Fire that light they they
[1:28:03] scramble they don't like it it causes
[1:28:06] conflict many times
[1:28:08] but other times people can respect it
[1:28:10] people can say wow there's something
[1:28:12] different about you and I like it I
[1:28:14] really like it something happens when
[1:28:16] you're around or maybe they'll come to
[1:28:18] your house and they'll say there's just
[1:28:19] something special about the presence in
[1:28:21] your house why is it like that and you
[1:28:24] can give them an opportunity you can
[1:28:25] give them a reason for that testimony
[1:28:27] well I can I can tell you why
[1:28:30] if you want to hear it
[1:28:33] but it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:28:35] today and forever it's beautiful when we
[1:28:38] look at it
[1:28:39] this is out of the Mighty God unveiled
[1:28:41] this is the inspiration for this the the
[1:28:44] unveiling of God the Mighty God unveiled
[1:28:46] he preaches a few different sermons in
[1:28:49] in in that space of time and and they're
[1:28:52] just tremendous
[1:28:53] but uh you know Moses
[1:28:57] he was different than the rest of the
[1:28:58] children of Israel wasn't he
[1:29:00] the rest of the children of Israel they
[1:29:02] said oh my don't let God speak unless we
[1:29:05] die let somebody else speak to us and
[1:29:07] Moses he had a desire for God to speak
[1:29:10] to him he wanted to hear from God
[1:29:14] he wanted to have that relationship with
[1:29:16] God and and so much so that as the
[1:29:19] relationship developed where it became
[1:29:21] that amoya for him to deal with he he
[1:29:25] wanted to desire he desired to see his
[1:29:27] face he got to that place where I don't
[1:29:30] want to just talk to you on the phone
[1:29:31] anymore I I don't want to just talk to
[1:29:33] an unseen face and have this this
[1:29:36] untangible conversation I want to see
[1:29:38] him will you show me your countenance he
[1:29:41] asked him that and God said to him you
[1:29:44] know what just stand on this rock and
[1:29:46] when I pass by you'll see my glory but
[1:29:48] you won't see my face because that's not
[1:29:50] for you Moses that's for a different
[1:29:52] group of people to see my face it's not
[1:29:55] for you we know it's the same thing for
[1:29:57] Daniel Daniel desired to see all of
[1:30:00] those things that were told he was told
[1:30:02] to seal up he wanted to look upon it he
[1:30:05] wanted to study it because Daniel was
[1:30:07] was a study or Daniel was smart Daniel
[1:30:09] understood where he stood by the reading
[1:30:12] of the books he under understood that 70
[1:30:15] years would come to pass and when that
[1:30:17] time came he'd be able to go back home
[1:30:19] they'd be able to go back and rebuild
[1:30:22] Moses he desired to see God he had this
[1:30:25] desire in his heart Exodus 33 21 and the
[1:30:28] Lord said behold there is a place by me
[1:30:31] isn't that wonderful to think there is a
[1:30:34] place by me and and he said and thou
[1:30:37] shalt stand upon a rock
[1:30:40] not just any Rock
[1:30:43] Thou shalt stand upon a rock and it
[1:30:46] shall come to pass while my Glory
[1:30:47] passeth by that I will put thee in a
[1:30:49] cleft of The Rock and I will cover thee
[1:30:51] with my hand while I pass by and I will
[1:30:54] take away mine hand and thou shalt see
[1:30:56] my back Parts but my face shall not be
[1:30:59] seen
[1:31:02] just such a beautiful thought there's so
[1:31:04] much in there I believe we could take a
[1:31:06] whole entire service right there maybe
[1:31:07] sometime we will but to think that the
[1:31:10] Lord said you know you're you you want
[1:31:11] to see me you want to have that
[1:31:13] relationship the only way that you're
[1:31:14] going to have that relationship is to
[1:31:16] hear my word and my word says that I'm
[1:31:18] going to put you up upon a rock and that
[1:31:20] rock is a rock of Revelation because you
[1:31:23] believe my voice you believe my word I'm
[1:31:25] going to put you on that rock Moses and
[1:31:28] you're going to stand there and you're
[1:31:29] going to see me you'll see the part of
[1:31:31] me that I have ordained for you to see
[1:31:33] what a tremendous thought that is today
[1:31:36] living in the in the in the shadow I'll
[1:31:38] call it of the message of the hour but
[1:31:40] in the sunshine the s-o-n shine of the
[1:31:43] rising of the sun it's truly a
[1:31:46] magnificent thing because we're not
[1:31:48] shown we're not given the direction to
[1:31:50] see the back part of God we're actually
[1:31:53] given the direction to see him face to
[1:31:55] face in our day
[1:31:57] brother Branham out of the Mighty God
[1:31:58] unveiled he says and while standing on
[1:32:00] the Rock Moses seen him pass and he saw
[1:32:03] the back of him and he said it looked
[1:32:06] like a man a man's back
[1:32:08] yet he did not see God he only seen the
[1:32:11] veil of God
[1:32:13] it's a tremendous thought
[1:32:15] God gave him the opportunity to see him
[1:32:17] but he still wouldn't let him see him he
[1:32:19] would just only let him see the back
[1:32:21] part and remember we're talking about
[1:32:23] the seventh angel messenger the the the
[1:32:25] the prophet for our day the the one who
[1:32:27] brought the word to us the Ellie easer
[1:32:31] the Elijah for our day and and what does
[1:32:33] he preach here he's preaching the Mighty
[1:32:36] God unveiled Moses the one who who was
[1:32:39] friends with God God called him a friend
[1:32:43] he wasn't able to actually see him
[1:32:46] there's a word that brother Branham uses
[1:32:48] here in 1964. and he doesn't say it
[1:32:51] before it and he only says it after it
[1:32:53] and that is in morphe
[1:32:56] he speaks it 19 times in the message of
[1:32:59] the hour and morphe
[1:33:02] he says in Dr Schofield here we find
[1:33:04] that his word changing
[1:33:06] from form
[1:33:08] we find the work and the word Amore in
[1:33:11] Greek which means the Unseen was made
[1:33:15] visible
[1:33:16] something that cannot we know it's not
[1:33:19] we know it's there
[1:33:21] it can be cannot be seen but yet we know
[1:33:25] that it's there
[1:33:27] and when he changed his form of the en
[1:33:31] morphe which mean that he changed from
[1:33:34] Supernatural to Natural
[1:33:38] he went from the supernatural being to a
[1:33:41] natural being
[1:33:42] we know that the word of God says in the
[1:33:44] beginning was the word
[1:33:45] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:33:47] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:33:51] dwelt Among Us
[1:33:52] the word is God
[1:33:56] not some other person
[1:33:58] he goes on to say and he just changed
[1:34:00] his mask
[1:34:02] and otherwise it's like a drama
[1:34:04] he was acting and in the Greek when they
[1:34:08] would change their mask maybe one plague
[1:34:10] One play player may have acted in
[1:34:13] several different parts
[1:34:15] and and he goes on to talk about this in
[1:34:17] in this message it's it's such a
[1:34:19] beautiful thought but you know God has
[1:34:22] chosen many different veils over the
[1:34:25] ages
[1:34:27] many different veils and what is it
[1:34:29] according to the prophet of God it's God
[1:34:31] and morphe he's just changing his mask
[1:34:34] he's going from one to the other all
[1:34:37] that God was
[1:34:39] Elohim the self-existing one but he went
[1:34:41] from that to being God on object of
[1:34:43] worship all that God was in that mask he
[1:34:46] poured in behind another mask Jesus
[1:34:48] Christ
[1:34:49] right and it didn't change who he was he
[1:34:52] was the same person one person one being
[1:34:57] the same person poured into Christ but
[1:35:01] then he goes on to say that all that
[1:35:02] Christ was God Elohim poured into the
[1:35:07] church
[1:35:09] it's a tremendous thought brothers and
[1:35:11] sisters to think that he's poured all of
[1:35:13] himself out into the church so where is
[1:35:15] he today everyone's hands should go up
[1:35:18] right now he's right here God in flesh
[1:35:22] if we believe what the prophet of God
[1:35:23] said
[1:35:25] and I think it's you know
[1:35:28] it can sometimes seem like maybe it's a
[1:35:30] bit crazy
[1:35:32] almost like a heretic talking like this
[1:35:35] but I I just believe there's a a
[1:35:37] direction for it and there's a purpose
[1:35:39] for it brothers and sisters we'll read
[1:35:40] the quote I've got it today but you know
[1:35:42] when the church recognizes its position
[1:35:45] then the Rapture will go
[1:35:47] who wants to stay here one minute sooner
[1:35:50] I believe there's one message for us and
[1:35:52] that's to get into Christ because if we
[1:35:54] can get into Christ we'll recognize our
[1:35:56] position that's just my thought I just
[1:35:59] believe that with all my heart if we can
[1:36:01] truly get into Christ and get beyond all
[1:36:04] of the outer Veil all the badger skin
[1:36:06] stuff that we deal with on a day-to-day
[1:36:08] basis if we can get beyond all of that
[1:36:11] the Rapture is going to go
[1:36:15] you know in the wilderness God gave
[1:36:17] Moses instruction
[1:36:19] gave the children of Israel instruction
[1:36:20] through Moses I just love it we can see
[1:36:24] it all the way through the Bible God
[1:36:26] speaks to the people but through the man
[1:36:28] he doesn't boom his voice out and scare
[1:36:30] everyone it doesn't want to alarm
[1:36:31] everyone he wants to be a gentleman and
[1:36:33] say you know I I know that scares you so
[1:36:34] we'll just I'll just give you a prophet
[1:36:36] I'll just raise up a man then you know
[1:36:38] what he'll speak to you and it's up to
[1:36:39] you to decide whether it's actually
[1:36:41] according to the word or not you're
[1:36:42] going to have to do the research you're
[1:36:44] going to have to have the right Spirit
[1:36:45] to be able to receive that word for your
[1:36:47] day
[1:36:48] but in the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:36:50] Exodus 25 verse 8 he says and and let
[1:36:53] them make me a sanctuary that I may
[1:36:56] dwell among them
[1:36:58] he wanted to give them a veil he wanted
[1:37:00] to give them a mask he wanted to give
[1:37:03] them something tangible that they could
[1:37:05] actually say that's where God is
[1:37:08] when God comes down that pillar of cloud
[1:37:11] or that Pillar of Fire that's where he's
[1:37:13] at and it's no different for us today
[1:37:15] God is not in this building we bring God
[1:37:18] to this building
[1:37:20] this is not the place that he dwells
[1:37:22] when that Pillar of Fire comes down when
[1:37:24] that when that pillar of cloud happens
[1:37:26] it's because we bring it here to this
[1:37:28] building and we we bring him here then
[1:37:30] he's here and you know where the the
[1:37:32] word of God says where two or three
[1:37:34] gathered together in his name he's there
[1:37:35] so he's here right now brothers and
[1:37:37] sisters he is here with us right now
[1:37:40] Exodus 25 8 and let them make me a
[1:37:42] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[1:37:44] according to all that I show thee after
[1:37:46] the pattern of the Tabernacle and the
[1:37:49] pattern of all the instruments thereof
[1:37:51] even so shall you make it and we know we
[1:37:54] talked about this in the past we even
[1:37:55] had the picture on the overhead here how
[1:37:58] there was the outer Court there was the
[1:38:00] inner court and then there was the holy
[1:38:02] of holies
[1:38:04] and he actually instructed Moses to
[1:38:07] build this out of badger skins the veil
[1:38:09] for the holy of holies was built out of
[1:38:12] badger skins on a very deliberate
[1:38:15] purpose it wasn't just by accident it
[1:38:17] wasn't because there was an abundance of
[1:38:18] badgers all over the land it was to
[1:38:20] represent something and brother Bradham
[1:38:22] says the reason he chose Badger skins is
[1:38:24] because it's an honorary little creature
[1:38:26] a badger represents Humanity human
[1:38:29] beings outside of the Holy Ghost our
[1:38:32] brute Beast is what the prophet of God
[1:38:33] said without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[1:38:36] we're brute beasts we're created in in
[1:38:38] the in the hybrid condition from the
[1:38:41] Garden of Eden and think about how much
[1:38:43] Purity there is in our lives I don't
[1:38:45] think there's very much of anything in
[1:38:47] us outside of God is there
[1:38:49] for How Far We've gone how many
[1:38:51] different generations of of Life have
[1:38:54] happened since the Garden of Eden but
[1:38:56] anyways
[1:38:57] brother Adam says that God used Badger
[1:39:00] skins for a very deliberate purpose
[1:39:02] to actually represent Humanity
[1:39:05] Exodus 26 32 and thou shalt hang it upon
[1:39:08] the pillars four pillars of of wood
[1:39:10] overlaid with gold their hooks shall be
[1:39:12] of gold upon the four sockets of silver
[1:39:15] and thou shalt hang up the veil under
[1:39:19] the touches that thou mayest bring in
[1:39:22] hither within the Veil The Ark of the
[1:39:25] testimony and they and the veil shall
[1:39:27] divide unto you between the holy place
[1:39:30] and the most holy
[1:39:33] and thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat upon
[1:39:36] the Ark of the testimony in the most
[1:39:38] holy place
[1:39:42] build the temple build the Tabernacle
[1:39:45] according to all of the instruction you
[1:39:47] can go and read it it's a very detailed
[1:39:49] account of instructing and and they
[1:39:51] built it all with cunning Works God
[1:39:53] anointed them I believe brother Bradham
[1:39:55] says that God anointed all of them to
[1:39:57] have the skills to have the skilled
[1:40:00] labor to be able to do it and we know
[1:40:01] they learned it from a youth and in
[1:40:03] bondage in Egypt they they learned it
[1:40:06] from the Egyptians but they were able to
[1:40:08] take all of that and build a temple a
[1:40:10] temple a tabernacle for God to live in
[1:40:12] behind Badger skins you know the the
[1:40:15] term Badger skins brother Brana mentions
[1:40:17] that only after 1964. and he mentions it
[1:40:21] 18 times he mentions in morphe 19 times
[1:40:25] both of those only after
[1:40:27] 1964. I think it's amazing when you look
[1:40:30] at it because what happened in 1963
[1:40:33] why could he start talking this way
[1:40:35] because it truly was the Mighty God
[1:40:38] being unveiled the unveiling of God in
[1:40:41] our day that's what the word of God was
[1:40:43] given to us for he came to select a
[1:40:45] bride of his own choosing but you know
[1:40:47] when those seals were opened it became a
[1:40:49] new book brother Bradham said this book
[1:40:50] became completely wide open to us there
[1:40:53] was no more Mysteries the mystery was
[1:40:55] history at that point
[1:40:57] but you know even then he asked people
[1:40:59] do you understand what's going on do you
[1:41:01] understand it and some people would say
[1:41:03] yeah and he said no you don't because
[1:41:05] it's not for you I was given a vision to
[1:41:08] go and store up food in the Tabernacle
[1:41:11] for a season and the reason he was told
[1:41:13] to do that was so that there would be
[1:41:15] food provision just like Joseph in his
[1:41:18] day there would be a famine in the land
[1:41:20] and today there's a famine in the land
[1:41:22] one of the greatest famines that there
[1:41:23] ever has been but not for food
[1:41:26] it's a famine for the word of God a
[1:41:29] famine for the hearing of the word of
[1:41:31] God the desire in the heart of man to
[1:41:32] hear the word of God they don't want to
[1:41:34] hear that they want to hear about other
[1:41:35] things they want to hear about Pride
[1:41:37] they want to hear about gender
[1:41:38] reassigning they want to hear about the
[1:41:40] Liberties they want to hear about all
[1:41:42] this other stuff anything but the word
[1:41:44] of God the word that God would give to
[1:41:46] Mankind through a prophet even Christian
[1:41:49] people denominational folks
[1:41:52] they want to hear anything but the word
[1:41:54] of a prophet oh you start talking profit
[1:41:56] and they'll get uneasy they'll say oh
[1:41:58] now you're getting crazy just like they
[1:42:00] did back in the days of Jesus I and my
[1:42:02] father are one as soon as you start
[1:42:04] talking now you're talking funny talk
[1:42:05] now you're a heretic and we gotta do
[1:42:07] something about you but you know what
[1:42:09] that is exactly what's happening and
[1:42:11] when the bride recognizes its position
[1:42:13] in Christ Jesus then the Rapture will go
[1:42:16] and it'll be a secret sudden going away
[1:42:18] of the Bride of Jesus Christ it won't be
[1:42:20] a big cataclysmic event
[1:42:24] but people want to see it the way they
[1:42:26] want to see it but God gave them what
[1:42:28] they asked for they said speak to us
[1:42:30] through a man oh my we're going to die
[1:42:32] if you talk so he said okay so what's so
[1:42:35] crazy to believe that God would send a
[1:42:37] prophet in our day where did that come
[1:42:38] from who said there wouldn't be a
[1:42:40] prophet
[1:42:43] I know I'm talking to people that
[1:42:45] believe that God sent a prophet so
[1:42:47] forgive me
[1:42:48] but I know I'm also talking to people
[1:42:49] that don't believe that God sent a
[1:42:51] prophet but you know my prayer is that
[1:42:53] we would be able to come together and be
[1:42:55] in one mind and one Accord and think
[1:42:57] could it be could it possibly be that
[1:42:59] God sent a prophet and if God sent a
[1:43:01] prophet what did that Prophet say what
[1:43:03] would he say to the world in this day
[1:43:04] and age if he did send a prophet you
[1:43:07] know what I'm I'm telling you you could
[1:43:08] find out and if you find out then you're
[1:43:11] going to be placed in a position of
[1:43:12] judgment because you're going to have to
[1:43:13] choose whether you're going to accept it
[1:43:15] or reject it and one day you're going to
[1:43:17] stand before the white Throne of
[1:43:18] judgment and you know we're all going to
[1:43:20] stand there I heard this said the other
[1:43:21] day we're all going to stand before that
[1:43:23] Throne of judgment
[1:43:25] probably saying brother Barry wait a
[1:43:26] second the word of God says that we'll
[1:43:27] be seated with him in his throne and we
[1:43:29] will and and we will stand before that
[1:43:31] Throne of judgment it's just a matter of
[1:43:32] when and where
[1:43:34] are we going to stand before that Throne
[1:43:35] of judgment here and now or then and
[1:43:38] there some people are going then and
[1:43:40] there but we have the opportunity today
[1:43:41] through the word of a Vindicated Prophet
[1:43:43] to stand before that Throne of judgment
[1:43:44] Here and Now
[1:43:46] it gives us the way back to the Tree of
[1:43:48] Life
[1:43:50] it doesn't scare us
[1:43:52] to say the name of Jesus Christ
[1:43:55] and to know that that's the Lord Jesus
[1:43:57] Christ we're not saying it in a
[1:44:00] derogatory way we're not saying it as a
[1:44:02] curse word you know every single time
[1:44:05] that it's used as a curse word people
[1:44:08] will answer for it and I say Lord have
[1:44:11] mercy on me because I know I used it
[1:44:14] that way
[1:44:15] oh but one day he revealed to me he
[1:44:17] pulled back the veil and showed me you
[1:44:19] know what it's not like you think not at
[1:44:22] all like you think
[1:44:24] you know he mentioned Badger skins 18
[1:44:26] times after 1964. in the unveiling of
[1:44:29] God brother batam says now he was behind
[1:44:31] what
[1:44:32] a skin Veil see
[1:44:34] amen Badger skins
[1:44:36] behind the veil
[1:44:38] and when that veil was rent
[1:44:40] on the day of crucifixion
[1:44:46] the veil that he was wrapped in was rent
[1:44:49] on that day of the crucifixion
[1:44:52] he says it twice
[1:44:56] the whole Mercy Seat came into view
[1:44:59] now the Jews cannot understand how that
[1:45:01] God could have mercy upon a sinful foul
[1:45:06] people like we are and I'll say this
[1:45:08] neither could Satan
[1:45:10] Satan couldn't believe that either Satan
[1:45:12] couldn't believe that the god of Glory
[1:45:15] Elohim the self-existing one the one
[1:45:17] that Satan knew created him and all the
[1:45:19] angels and all the universe he couldn't
[1:45:21] believe that God that being would
[1:45:24] condescend so far to be in a human being
[1:45:27] to come down to actually be that one to
[1:45:31] die and be the Redemption for man
[1:45:34] now the Jews cannot understand how that
[1:45:36] God could have mercy upon a sinful foul
[1:45:39] people like we are
[1:45:41] but they couldn't see this one who was
[1:45:43] giving Mercy because he was hid he was
[1:45:47] behind the mercy seat on the inside with
[1:45:51] Badger skins
[1:45:53] isn't it amazing to think brother
[1:45:55] Branham brings it out so clearly he says
[1:45:57] those most religious ones the priests
[1:46:00] the the Levites those those Pharisees
[1:46:03] and the Sadducees they were talking
[1:46:05] about this Messiah that was going to
[1:46:07] come someday there was going to be a
[1:46:09] great deliverer for for for Israel and
[1:46:12] they knew it they believed it that there
[1:46:13] was a messiah coming but they didn't
[1:46:14] recognize that while they were singing
[1:46:16] their worship their chants their their
[1:46:19] Worship in vain teaching for doctrines
[1:46:21] the Commandments of men they were
[1:46:23] teaching those and singing those in the
[1:46:25] temple while they were crucifying their
[1:46:27] Messiah right there
[1:46:29] but why were they doing that brothers
[1:46:31] and sisters the word of God says that
[1:46:33] they were blinded they had a veil put
[1:46:35] over their eyes for our sakes
[1:46:38] brothers and sisters if there's nothing
[1:46:39] else that we got to worship for maybe
[1:46:41] God didn't give us the money we wanted
[1:46:43] maybe we're sick in our bodies maybe
[1:46:45] we've got a problem in our family maybe
[1:46:47] there's a situation that we just don't
[1:46:49] know how to deal with if we don't have
[1:46:50] anything else to worship about we can
[1:46:52] worship about that that a whole entire
[1:46:54] generation of people a whole race of
[1:46:57] people was actually
[1:46:59] terribly treated so that we could have
[1:47:02] the Salvation that we've been given it
[1:47:04] is amazing when we think about that
[1:47:08] when that word
[1:47:09] that was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:47:12] brothers and sisters
[1:47:13] was on the cross
[1:47:16] was on Calvary
[1:47:18] when they took that word
[1:47:20] and they nailed it to the cross
[1:47:23] that word
[1:47:25] he bowed his head he cried with a loud
[1:47:27] voice
[1:47:29] and yielded up the ghost
[1:47:31] that's what the scripture says
[1:47:33] but the scripture also says the very
[1:47:36] next thing that he did his very first
[1:47:39] order of business when he changed his
[1:47:40] mask
[1:47:41] right
[1:47:43] and morphe he changed his mask he said
[1:47:46] his Spirit free on his way up to heaven
[1:47:48] he went into that Temple where they were
[1:47:49] worshiping and he ripped that Veil he
[1:47:51] ripped that tradition in half from the
[1:47:54] top to the bottom and he said right now
[1:47:56] you're seeing the full view there's
[1:47:58] nothing hidden from you and right now
[1:48:00] you're not going to be able to see it
[1:48:01] but there's going to be a people one day
[1:48:03] that are going to be able to look right
[1:48:05] in to the holy of holies they're going
[1:48:06] to be able to look right into The Mercy
[1:48:08] Seat they're going to take the word of
[1:48:09] God and the whole word of God for their
[1:48:12] day and they're going to be able to see
[1:48:13] it the first order of business he had
[1:48:16] was to go and tear down their Traditions
[1:48:18] to rip that Veil from top to bottom
[1:48:20] Jesus Matthew 27 verse 50 when he had
[1:48:24] cried again with a loud voice yielded up
[1:48:26] The Ghost and behold the veil was of the
[1:48:28] temple was rent in Twain From the top to
[1:48:31] the bottom
[1:48:33] the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent
[1:48:34] and the graves were open and many bodies
[1:48:36] of the Saints who had slept a rose and
[1:48:38] came out of the graves after his
[1:48:40] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:48:42] and appeared unto many and I personally
[1:48:44] this is just my view brothers and
[1:48:45] sisters as we preach this word this word
[1:48:47] for our day the message of the hour that
[1:48:49] God himself has now come down and
[1:48:51] manifest In the Flesh what we're doing
[1:48:53] as we do this brothers and sisters is We
[1:48:56] are tearing back the badger skins of the
[1:48:58] veil and saying that this is I and my
[1:49:01] father are one it's not two we are not
[1:49:04] going to one day get there we are there
[1:49:06] he is here with us now brother Branham
[1:49:08] says it in the message he is here he
[1:49:11] doesn't say he's coming he says he's
[1:49:13] here so where is he brothers and sisters
[1:49:15] he's behind the badger skins and I want
[1:49:17] to recommend today that when we look at
[1:49:19] one another look at God look at Christ
[1:49:21] Jesus recognize that he is and morphe
[1:49:24] according to what the prophet of God
[1:49:25] said he's hiding behind that Badger skin
[1:49:28] of humanity when we want to speak about
[1:49:30] our brother or our sister think about
[1:49:32] who we really are speaking about because
[1:49:34] his ears are always open and listening
[1:49:37] to what our voice has to say remember
[1:49:39] brother Bradham says he doesn't look at
[1:49:40] our work she's not looking at our works
[1:49:42] he's not looking at us in our Humanity
[1:49:44] he's not looking at our Badger skin he
[1:49:45] doesn't care about our Badger skin
[1:49:46] that's why he's not afraid to put us
[1:49:48] down or bring us up what he's looking
[1:49:50] for is our response to the word he wants
[1:49:53] to see spiritual growth in our lives and
[1:49:55] he ain't afraid to do anything to see
[1:49:57] that happen in our lives he will always
[1:50:00] have his will come to pass and his will
[1:50:03] is his word in our lives
[1:50:06] I just can't help but think that you
[1:50:08] know what when we get that recognition
[1:50:10] that veil of the badger skin is actually
[1:50:12] just going to tear apart
[1:50:14] I remember hearing it preach that
[1:50:16] there's coming a time where we'll have
[1:50:17] so much Revelation that that wine skin
[1:50:20] will burst and that badge your skin will
[1:50:23] burst because of the Revelation and what
[1:50:25] will happen is the the rocks will run
[1:50:28] the Earth will shake and the graves will
[1:50:30] be open and you know it'll be a
[1:50:32] spiritual thing that happens it's not
[1:50:33] going to be a big cataclysmic thing like
[1:50:35] the world thinks it's actually going to
[1:50:38] happen in Revelation towards the end of
[1:50:40] the world there will be tremendous
[1:50:41] earthquakes and and all of that will
[1:50:43] happen but when the resurrection and the
[1:50:44] Rapture happens it's going to be a
[1:50:46] spiritual awakening a spiritual
[1:50:48] Resurrection out of the graves and I
[1:50:51] think it's so beautiful because brother
[1:50:52] Bradham says it that you know he talks
[1:50:54] about 30 to 40 days he doesn't say it's
[1:50:56] going to be exactly a month he doesn't
[1:50:57] say it's actually going to be 40 days he
[1:50:59] says about 30 or 40 days about 40 days I
[1:51:03] think he says and you know that's coming
[1:51:05] brothers and sisters that's the prophet
[1:51:07] of God he said that it has to happen his
[1:51:09] word has to come to pass and you know
[1:51:11] we're going to see the loved ones come
[1:51:13] to us just like the the many people saw
[1:51:15] the people come out of the graves and go
[1:51:16] into the City and they were seen by many
[1:51:18] it's going to happen there's many
[1:51:20] Believers in this world many people who
[1:51:22] say I am my father are one many people
[1:51:24] who can say be it unto me according to
[1:51:26] Thy word if this word says that if
[1:51:27] that's what you wanted to say the Mighty
[1:51:29] God is unveiled from before our eyes in
[1:51:31] Badger skins of human beings again if
[1:51:33] he's here in flesh and I'm that flesh
[1:51:35] hey be it unto me I don't want to argue
[1:51:37] with that I just want to say wow I can't
[1:51:39] even hardly believe that he would choose
[1:51:41] me and again it just comes to the place
[1:51:43] where if that's what the prophet of God
[1:51:44] is saying to us then how much do we have
[1:51:46] to give him praise how much worship do
[1:51:49] we have already right there to give to
[1:51:51] him to think that he would choose you
[1:51:53] that he would choose me how would he
[1:51:55] choose me living in a world of sin
[1:51:57] living in a world of Darkness not
[1:51:59] knowing up from down not knowing right
[1:52:01] from wrong not not understanding that
[1:52:03] God even sent a prophet
[1:52:05] but one day God will send someone across
[1:52:07] your path to say you know what God sent
[1:52:09] a prophet
[1:52:10] he actually sent his word and I think
[1:52:13] it's so fantastic I'll say it again I
[1:52:15] said it already but I'll say it again if
[1:52:17] God were to send a prophet to the world
[1:52:19] for the people who are Christians who
[1:52:22] maybe haven't fully accepted this
[1:52:24] wouldn't you want to hear what that
[1:52:26] Prophet had to say
[1:52:29] but so many people are so caught up with
[1:52:31] the theory that oh it's got to be some
[1:52:32] kind of doctrinal thing and we've got to
[1:52:34] get all caught up and all this other
[1:52:36] stuff it's it's the devil's in the
[1:52:38] details
[1:52:39] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:52:41] and forever
[1:52:44] you know what we read this morning that
[1:52:45] the spirit is what giveth Life as we
[1:52:48] come into the the Resurrection season
[1:52:50] the the spring season I heard it said
[1:52:53] the other day and and it's probably only
[1:52:55] about 30 days now but a few days ago
[1:52:57] they said on the radio that it's spring
[1:52:58] is 35 days away
[1:53:00] we get into the the cycle I always do
[1:53:03] anyways of of it is the rising of the
[1:53:05] sun it's it's time for Easter when we
[1:53:08] start to have Easter we start to think
[1:53:10] about life coming back into the world
[1:53:12] again in our area the leaves start to
[1:53:14] turn green the birds start to come back
[1:53:16] and we start to think about the life
[1:53:18] that's going to happen and you know
[1:53:20] can't help but think that one of these
[1:53:22] days maybe it'll be a spring morning
[1:53:24] with with no clouds in the sky somewhere
[1:53:26] between six in the morning and nine in
[1:53:28] the morning sometime when we're in the
[1:53:30] midst of our devotions we'll have
[1:53:31] someone that we love come and sit down
[1:53:34] and just fellowship with us around the
[1:53:36] word of God and say just keep pressing
[1:53:38] on brother you've made it you don't have
[1:53:41] to worry anymore all of your troubles
[1:53:43] all of your trials all of it was for
[1:53:45] this moment and you know what nobody can
[1:53:48] change it not even you if you want to
[1:53:50] you've come too far to change it you
[1:53:52] can't go back even if you want to
[1:53:54] you know brothers and sisters we're
[1:53:56] having a conversation this week and last
[1:53:58] week and the week before and and I'm
[1:54:00] just gonna keep talking about it I can't
[1:54:01] help but think about it what would
[1:54:03] happen if you had an angel of God come
[1:54:05] to your house and visit you and tell you
[1:54:07] not to worry about a thing because
[1:54:09] everything that you're worrying about is
[1:54:11] irrelevant to the word of God in your
[1:54:13] life that you are already seated in
[1:54:15] Heavenly places you are going to make it
[1:54:17] when the Rapture happens you don't have
[1:54:19] to have any fears about anything in your
[1:54:22] life anymore you know what I want to say
[1:54:24] is that that's that's happened the angel
[1:54:26] of God has come to your house if you've
[1:54:28] heard the message of the hour he told
[1:54:30] you that you already are the sinless
[1:54:32] Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ
[1:54:34] that he has chosen for his own wife and
[1:54:38] you know the more we feed on this word
[1:54:39] the more we can rejoice and be very glad
[1:54:42] because the bride the wife has made
[1:54:45] herself ready as we feed on this word
[1:54:47] brothers and sisters it's the spirit
[1:54:49] that gives us life this resurrection and
[1:54:51] Rapture it's gonna happen from inside of
[1:54:54] here it's not going to be out there
[1:54:56] somewhere it's going to be the same
[1:54:58] voice brother Branham says they're
[1:54:59] called Lazarus from the grave that same
[1:55:02] voice is going to speak from the Bride
[1:55:04] of Jesus Christ and say I and my father
[1:55:06] are one and it's time brother Branham
[1:55:09] says in the message oh the invisible
[1:55:12] Union of the Bride there's a time where
[1:55:14] they were waiting for the fire to fall
[1:55:16] then he said we've been expecting it we
[1:55:19] were in Glacier National Park watching
[1:55:21] for this to happen and where there came
[1:55:23] a voice one time that said oh things are
[1:55:26] ready Let the Fire Fall brothers and
[1:55:30] sisters the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:55:32] going to recognize it one day she's
[1:55:34] going to look past the Bale The Veil The
[1:55:36] Badger skins and she's is going to say
[1:55:38] those very words I believe it with all
[1:55:40] my heart
[1:55:41] all things are ready Let the Fire Fall
[1:55:44] oh my and you know brother Branham says
[1:55:47] it before one bomb goes off before one
[1:55:49] bomb goes off and I I want to say this
[1:55:52] one bomb that can affect the Bride of
[1:55:53] Jesus Christ before one bomb goes off
[1:55:55] that can affect the Bride of Jesus
[1:55:57] Christ boom
[1:55:58] it's gonna happen but you know what does
[1:56:01] it it's not us it's not our own
[1:56:02] inspiration if we try and get ourselves
[1:56:04] excited about it if we try and work it
[1:56:07] up it's not going to happen and that's
[1:56:08] what's gross people out over the years
[1:56:10] over the decades even around the message
[1:56:12] of the hour people trying to work it up
[1:56:13] looking at the first ball looking at the
[1:56:15] second poll we've got great signs and
[1:56:17] wonders amongst us it's got nothing to
[1:56:18] do with it the only thing those things
[1:56:20] were for was to get people's attention
[1:56:22] on the word if you've ever fished before
[1:56:24] you put bait on the hook to get the fish
[1:56:27] you can throw them the hook out but the
[1:56:29] fish are going to look at it and think
[1:56:30] whatever I don't want nothing to do with
[1:56:32] it but if you put a little bait on that
[1:56:33] hook then the fish are going to come and
[1:56:35] nibble and you'll be able to catch them
[1:56:36] and that's why Jesus said I want to make
[1:56:38] you Fishers of Men I don't want to make
[1:56:40] you just Fishers of fish that's nice but
[1:56:44] there's something more important here
[1:56:45] and that's two thousand years ago how
[1:56:47] much more important today brothers and
[1:56:49] sisters the spirit giveth life out of
[1:56:51] second Corinthians 3 verse 12 seeing
[1:56:53] then that we have such a hope we use
[1:56:55] great plainness of speech we don't have
[1:56:58] a mystery anymore more we're not talking
[1:57:00] about great mysterious things we're
[1:57:02] talking about the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:57:04] flesh now walking around on Earth in his
[1:57:06] bride
[1:57:08] verse 13 says not as Moses which put a
[1:57:11] veil over his face that the children of
[1:57:13] Israel could not look steadfastly could
[1:57:16] not steadfastly look at the end of that
[1:57:18] which is abolished living under the law
[1:57:21] we're not living under the law some
[1:57:23] people are some people are living under
[1:57:25] works I'm a good person I've I do
[1:57:28] everything right you know what I would
[1:57:31] say this the most saintly person is the
[1:57:33] one who does wrong now you're going to
[1:57:35] say brother Barry you're getting crazy
[1:57:37] but I want to say this they're the ones
[1:57:39] that will say I did wrong
[1:57:41] forgive me for it
[1:57:43] will you forgive me for it
[1:57:45] the ones who are living under the law
[1:57:47] will say I never did nothing wrong ain't
[1:57:49] nothing wrong with me look at me
[1:57:51] you know what that is that's pride gets
[1:57:54] in our lives it's the original sin goes
[1:57:56] back to Heaven That's what Satan did and
[1:57:58] that's what he wants to do to the church
[1:57:59] today is get so much pride in them they
[1:58:01] say I've made it everything is fine in
[1:58:03] my life I go to church I pay my tithes
[1:58:06] I'm a good member I do all kinds of
[1:58:08] things for the community i i i tithe I
[1:58:12] give offerings I even give to missions
[1:58:13] I've got all this goodness in my life
[1:58:15] but you know what there's still
[1:58:18] something wrong inside there's still one
[1:58:19] little spot inside that's just not dealt
[1:58:21] with
[1:58:22] we have to let him in to deal with it in
[1:58:24] our lives
[1:58:25] oh my verse 14 says but their minds were
[1:58:29] blinded
[1:58:30] For unto this day remaineth the same
[1:58:32] Veil untaken away in the reading of the
[1:58:35] Old Testament which Veil is done away in
[1:58:39] Christ
[1:58:41] but even unto this day when Moses is
[1:58:43] read
[1:58:44] the veil is upon their heart
[1:58:47] can you imagine that brothers and
[1:58:48] sisters think about World War II and all
[1:58:50] the children of Israel
[1:58:52] how many of those people that went
[1:58:54] through concentration camps
[1:58:57] their families were torn apart
[1:58:59] how many of those people's minds were
[1:59:01] blinded
[1:59:02] all of them
[1:59:04] why were they blinded
[1:59:06] so that we could be here today
[1:59:08] to receive the word
[1:59:11] oh my I got too excited this thing's
[1:59:13] come apart
[1:59:16] but even unto this day when Moses is
[1:59:18] read the veil is upon their heart
[1:59:21] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[1:59:24] Lord the veil shall be taken away
[1:59:26] there's come in a day and it's very soon
[1:59:28] brothers and sisters where there's going
[1:59:29] to be two witnesses on the scene and
[1:59:31] that Veil will be taken away from the
[1:59:33] 144 000 will be called the elected of
[1:59:37] Israel and we know we talked about that
[1:59:39] uh quite a time ago quite a while ago
[1:59:42] you know isn't it wonderful to look we
[1:59:44] can see down and is it Ashbury in
[1:59:46] Tennessee the university they've got
[1:59:48] that great revival going on and it's
[1:59:50] gone on for days and you know back in
[1:59:52] the 70s they had the same thing happen
[1:59:54] and it's going on and people are coming
[1:59:57] from all over the place because why
[1:59:59] because they're desperate to get the
[2:00:01] spirit of God they want to hear from God
[2:00:03] and they don't want to hear religion
[2:00:04] they don't want to hear religion I
[2:00:06] personally would say this brothers and
[2:00:08] sisters if they won't receive the
[2:00:09] message of the hour then then we don't
[2:00:11] want to put anybody in or better anybody
[2:00:13] out but those are people that are hungry
[2:00:15] for the word of God and it's amazing to
[2:00:18] see when that hunger for the word of God
[2:00:20] is out there because the prophet of God
[2:00:21] says when they go looking for that oil
[2:00:24] when they start crying out for that oil
[2:00:27] we know the oil is the Holy Ghost and
[2:00:28] they're even saying it on Fox news that
[2:00:30] that's the Holy Ghost is outpouring of
[2:00:32] the Holy Ghost is what they're saying on
[2:00:34] National Television my goodness when
[2:00:37] they go looking for that that's when the
[2:00:38] Rapture goes
[2:00:40] how close is it
[2:00:43] maybe it's today maybe it's tomorrow
[2:00:45] maybe it's in a week maybe it's in 10
[2:00:47] years we don't know but it's wonderful
[2:00:50] to see the spirit of God moving brother
[2:00:52] Branham says that it's the same spirit
[2:00:54] don't say that it's the wrong spirit
[2:00:56] it's the same Spirit falling on those
[2:00:59] people but if they can't receive the
[2:01:01] message of the hour
[2:01:03] I don't want to say anymore
[2:01:06] brother Adam says nevertheless when it
[2:01:08] shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be
[2:01:09] taken away there's coming a time where
[2:01:11] the the children of Israel the veil will
[2:01:13] be taken away and they'll receive this
[2:01:15] message of the hour they'll receive
[2:01:17] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:01:19] and forever they'll say oh my how did
[2:01:21] you get those scars in your hands and
[2:01:24] he'll say don't worry I got them in the
[2:01:25] house of my friends and and they'll just
[2:01:28] start to mourn and lament because
[2:01:30] they'll recognize when the Messiah was
[2:01:32] with them they actually are the ones
[2:01:34] that killed him and he'll say no it
[2:01:36] wasn't it wasn't actually so that you
[2:01:38] could be mean to mankind it wasn't so
[2:01:40] that you could miss it it was to
[2:01:42] actually preserve life because look out
[2:01:43] there look at the millions of Christians
[2:01:46] look at the millions of Bride of Jesus
[2:01:49] Christ truly elected that you saved
[2:01:51] because you actually did that
[2:01:54] what a tremendous blessing that will be
[2:01:56] for them people
[2:01:58] verse 17 says now the Lord is that
[2:02:01] spirit and we're the spirit of the Lord
[2:02:03] is there is Liberty
[2:02:05] I just love that because you know what
[2:02:07] that that that right there will just
[2:02:10] dovetail with what's happening in
[2:02:12] Ashbury Tennessee right now
[2:02:14] they ain't reserved they don't care they
[2:02:17] want to worship God
[2:02:18] there's people coming from all over the
[2:02:20] place and they don't care if it's time
[2:02:21] to close or go home or if the custodians
[2:02:25] want to clean up
[2:02:26] they want to worship God and they're
[2:02:28] just going to keep worshiping God
[2:02:29] because where the spirit of the Lord is
[2:02:31] there's liberty and that's why these
[2:02:33] people are staying there because the
[2:02:34] spirit of the Lord is there and I just
[2:02:36] can't help but think the more I think
[2:02:38] about this how much more the Sons and
[2:02:40] Daughters of God those people who never
[2:02:43] had the veil those people who were truly
[2:02:45] elected before the foundation of the
[2:02:47] world where the spirit of the Lord is
[2:02:48] there is Liberty my
[2:02:51] but we all with open faces beholding as
[2:02:54] in a glass looking into the mirror the
[2:02:57] glory of the Lord
[2:02:59] are changed into the same image from
[2:03:02] glory to glory
[2:03:04] even as by the spirit of the Lord when
[2:03:08] we look in the mirror at home brothers
[2:03:09] and sisters who do we see
[2:03:11] do we see the badger skin
[2:03:13] Satan wants us to see the badger skin
[2:03:17] or do we look in that glass and do we
[2:03:19] see Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:03:20] today and forever the word coming of the
[2:03:23] Lord the bride coming of Jesus Christ
[2:03:27] you know what it takes is it takes
[2:03:29] Revelation faith is a revelation
[2:03:32] faith
[2:03:34] is the substance
[2:03:36] the evidence of things hoped for
[2:03:41] but it actually takes a revelation of
[2:03:43] the spirit
[2:03:45] to Quicken the word in our lives we
[2:03:46] can't do it on our own
[2:03:48] we can't just say I want a revelation
[2:03:52] I'm going to get me a revelation I'm
[2:03:54] going to go to the library and get a
[2:03:55] revelation I'm going to go on Google I'm
[2:03:56] going to get a revelation
[2:03:57] it ain't going to happen that way we
[2:03:59] have to sit down with our Bible and
[2:04:00] invite the spirit of God to actually
[2:04:02] give us a revelation but if we do that
[2:04:04] if we open ourselves up to the Lord
[2:04:06] Jesus Christ and say give me a
[2:04:08] revelation will you please give me a
[2:04:10] revelation about this word about this
[2:04:12] truth about this message about this this
[2:04:14] this Prophet if you'll do that
[2:04:17] he'll do it
[2:04:20] he'll never leave you hanging
[2:04:22] but it takes the spirit of God to
[2:04:25] Quicken the word to bring it to life to
[2:04:27] give us that revelation
[2:04:28] and the Mighty God unveiled
[2:04:31] brother Branham he says this and I I
[2:04:33] told this to a man the other day
[2:04:37] when this peace had come out about this
[2:04:39] man being healed
[2:04:40] the same Minister said
[2:04:43] they make a God out of you brother
[2:04:44] Branham
[2:04:48] I I heard this many many times but I
[2:04:51] just never heard it this way
[2:04:52] I think it's beautiful he says well he
[2:04:55] was a Critic so I thought I'd just kind
[2:04:57] of break it off
[2:04:58] just a little bit not to hurt you know
[2:05:01] but just I I said
[2:05:03] is that too far from the scripture to be
[2:05:05] that see
[2:05:07] is it too far he said see I said no it
[2:05:11] isn't I said because Jesus called
[2:05:13] prophets God see
[2:05:15] that's right now some people would stop
[2:05:18] right there and say well then you're
[2:05:20] making brother Bradham God you're saying
[2:05:21] that William Mary and Branham was God
[2:05:24] but isn't that what he said the prophets
[2:05:26] would be they would be God to the people
[2:05:29] he told Moses that you'll be God to the
[2:05:31] people and that Aaron will be your
[2:05:32] priest
[2:05:34] and if we have the Holy Ghost In Our
[2:05:36] Lives whose spirit is the Holy Ghost
[2:05:37] what spirit is the Holy Ghost brothers
[2:05:39] and sisters
[2:05:41] this is where it gets hair uh I don't
[2:05:44] even know how you say it you'll be a
[2:05:45] heretic
[2:05:46] to talk this way when you got the holy
[2:05:48] ghost in your life denominations will
[2:05:50] say no you know when you when you
[2:05:52] actually just represent part of the gift
[2:05:54] when you just say that I've had this
[2:05:56] manifestation or I've had that
[2:05:57] manifestation then you've got it no it's
[2:05:59] not about that the only evidence is the
[2:06:02] ability to receive the word but the word
[2:06:04] is going to be the fullness of the word
[2:06:05] it's not going to be a partial word we
[2:06:08] don't want to say just speaking in
[2:06:10] tongues because that's only one of the
[2:06:12] nine spiritual gifts that was given to
[2:06:14] the church when we get it we get the
[2:06:16] fruit of the spirit his spirit in our
[2:06:19] lives
[2:06:20] he goes on to say and then and and and
[2:06:22] and they say well you people try to take
[2:06:24] the place of God
[2:06:26] that's not too far out
[2:06:28] that's exactly what it is that's exactly
[2:06:31] he says
[2:06:33] for me I was like wow I don't think I've
[2:06:35] ever heard this before he says God
[2:06:36] manifested in flesh just as he promised
[2:06:39] now we could take it from the maybe the
[2:06:41] unbeliever's perspective that people
[2:06:43] don't believe that God said a prophet
[2:06:44] and we could actually take it and let
[2:06:46] the pendulum swing all the way the other
[2:06:47] way and there's people that will say
[2:06:49] well you know what yeah William Mary and
[2:06:51] Bradham he had the spirit of God and he
[2:06:53] was the wave Chief and he had all the
[2:06:55] manifestation all that God was he poured
[2:06:56] into Christ and all that Christ was he
[2:06:58] poured into William Mary and Branham and
[2:06:59] that's where it stays and now we have to
[2:07:01] actually wait for him to come back and
[2:07:03] finish something off you know what that
[2:07:04] does that stops the spirit of God we
[2:07:07] can't make him God he took himself off
[2:07:09] of the mission field to say you're
[2:07:11] making me Antichrist to make me God he's
[2:07:13] not God he was pointing to God and it's
[2:07:15] the same thing for us today brothers and
[2:07:17] sisters the reason he came was to call
[2:07:19] out a bride for God's own choosing it's
[2:07:21] the same story as Ellie easier going and
[2:07:24] finding a bride Rebecca for Isaac that
[2:07:27] whole story we're not going to get into
[2:07:29] it today but it's the same thing he came
[2:07:31] to call out a bride for Jesus Christ he
[2:07:33] says that's exactly what it is that's
[2:07:35] exactly God manifested in flesh just as
[2:07:39] he promised
[2:07:41] I don't think I ever really caught him
[2:07:43] saying that ever before I thought man
[2:07:46] that's good and you know some might say
[2:07:48] while he was just trying to put that man
[2:07:49] off would brother Bradham lie ever
[2:07:52] he admitted to lying once
[2:07:56] just by I think attrition by saying you
[2:07:58] know I know who's on the phone so I'm
[2:08:00] just going to step outside and and I'm
[2:08:01] not here right and we know that God
[2:08:04] dealt with him on that but he wasn't a
[2:08:06] liar
[2:08:07] so if God was manifest In the Flesh then
[2:08:09] where is he
[2:08:11] I think it's just beautiful brothers and
[2:08:13] sisters
[2:08:15] he goes on to say
[2:08:18] oh my
[2:08:21] out of the Mighty God unveiled and God
[2:08:24] what he does he just changes himself
[2:08:27] to become to that generation
[2:08:30] to make known himself to that people
[2:08:34] and that's what we're here to find out
[2:08:36] tonight
[2:08:37] in what way is God supposed to make
[2:08:40] himself known to this people in this
[2:08:43] time
[2:08:44] he changes his mask
[2:08:47] he changes his act
[2:08:50] but he doesn't change his disposition
[2:08:55] he doesn't change his nature
[2:08:58] he just changes his mask
[2:09:00] from one to another
[2:09:03] he does it to reveal himself more
[2:09:07] more plain to the people I'm really
[2:09:09] sorry this thing is
[2:09:11] starting to poke me in the
[2:09:13] in the head here
[2:09:14] it's really annoying
[2:09:16] he says I'm going to go back and read
[2:09:19] this without distraction I apologize
[2:09:21] and God what he does he just changes
[2:09:24] himself to become to that generation to
[2:09:26] make known himself to that people
[2:09:29] and that's what we're here to find out
[2:09:31] tonight in what way is God supposed to
[2:09:33] make himself known to this people
[2:09:36] and in this time
[2:09:38] and I just think
[2:09:39] why we're here today is to hear that to
[2:09:43] understand that to get the revelation of
[2:09:45] that what what God is actually doing in
[2:09:48] our day
[2:09:49] what that's what we're here to find out
[2:09:51] tonight in what way is God supposed to
[2:09:53] make himself known to this people and in
[2:09:55] this time he changed changes his mask he
[2:09:58] changes his act but he doesn't change
[2:10:00] his disposition he doesn't change his
[2:10:02] nature he just changes his mask from one
[2:10:05] to another he does it to reveal himself
[2:10:08] more plain to the people that they might
[2:10:11] know who he is
[2:10:13] and what he is
[2:10:15] when the church recognizes its position
[2:10:17] brothers and sisters then the Rapture
[2:10:19] will go
[2:10:21] the church isn't going to be a
[2:10:22] denomination it's not the message of the
[2:10:24] hour will never be denominated because
[2:10:26] it's Christ it's the life of Jesus
[2:10:27] Christ the spirit is what gives it life
[2:10:29] it brings this word it quickens this
[2:10:32] word that he's given us
[2:10:35] but it'll never be denominated it's not
[2:10:37] going to be a denomination that actually
[2:10:40] gets it what it is going to be is Jesus
[2:10:43] Christ in plain view no longer hidden
[2:10:46] behind the veil of the badger skins and
[2:10:49] for some people it's almost like he is
[2:10:52] hidden behind the badger skins that we
[2:10:54] have to come into a holy nature we have
[2:10:56] to come into a a royal priesthood which
[2:10:59] is what the word says we have to come in
[2:11:01] and and have some kind of works some
[2:11:03] kind of first or second pole
[2:11:04] manifestation but that's not where we're
[2:11:06] at today brothers and sisters we're
[2:11:08] already inside the inner Veil where the
[2:11:11] Ark of the Covenant is we're not going
[2:11:14] to get there someday we're already there
[2:11:18] you know brother Bradham says it in uh
[2:11:21] my
[2:11:23] someone would probably know the message
[2:11:26] I think it might be Christ The Mystery
[2:11:27] of God revealed I can't remember now
[2:11:30] but brother Branham says that you never
[2:11:32] did it in the first place
[2:11:35] yeah it is invisible Union isn't it
[2:11:38] you never did it
[2:11:40] he says first it's as though you never
[2:11:43] did it in the first place
[2:11:45] but then a couple paragraphs later he
[2:11:47] says you never did do it in the first
[2:11:50] place
[2:11:52] the only thing that happened is we
[2:11:53] bypassed our theophanes
[2:11:55] he chose to express us through the
[2:11:57] parents that we have and we came to
[2:12:00] Earth with that seed Gene of God and and
[2:12:03] we didn't know it we have spiritual
[2:12:06] Amnesia every one of us but somewhere
[2:12:09] along the way maybe it's from birth
[2:12:10] maybe it's not maybe it's somewhere
[2:12:12] along the way in the Journey of our life
[2:12:14] somewhere along the way the word of God
[2:12:16] quickens that seed Gene to life in our
[2:12:19] lives and we can't help but manifest
[2:12:21] what we are and you know that's the way
[2:12:24] it is for everyone the rain's going to
[2:12:25] fall in the just and the unjust and the
[2:12:28] word of God is what's going to do the
[2:12:29] dividing brothers and sisters it's not
[2:12:31] going to be us putting someone in or
[2:12:33] taking someone out there's times where
[2:12:35] we need to exercise that in the church
[2:12:37] sure if we have someone dealing living
[2:12:39] in rank sin where we need to actually
[2:12:41] address it because that will offend it
[2:12:44] will upset the spirit of God but when
[2:12:46] we're all just brothers and sisters
[2:12:47] coming together there's no need for us
[2:12:49] to be judging one another we should be
[2:12:51] judging ourselves and if we can judge
[2:12:53] ourselves then what will happen is we'll
[2:12:55] set the atmosphere to come together in
[2:12:57] one mind and one Accord and we know he's
[2:12:59] the same yesterday today and forever and
[2:13:00] when we do that brothers and sisters
[2:13:02] don't be the same way as it was in in
[2:13:03] the day of Pentecost he'll come in the
[2:13:05] room and it'll be like a rushing Mighty
[2:13:08] Wind
[2:13:09] we're not looking for great signs and
[2:13:10] wonders some might be saying well
[2:13:12] brother bear you got a Pentecostal
[2:13:14] background so maybe you're looking for a
[2:13:15] great manifestation you know what where
[2:13:16] the spirit of the Lord is there's
[2:13:18] liberty and I think that if they can get
[2:13:20] that excited about the word in this
[2:13:22] place down south what about the Sons and
[2:13:24] Daughters of God
[2:13:26] you know the mercy see today brothers
[2:13:28] and sisters was just like it was on the
[2:13:30] day of Calvary when when Christ was
[2:13:33] crucified his first order of business
[2:13:35] when he was crucified when his work was
[2:13:37] completed In the Flesh on Earth was to
[2:13:40] separate that veil was to say it is no
[2:13:43] longer going to stand between man and
[2:13:46] God and and what it was was the
[2:13:48] traditions of men he went in and he tore
[2:13:51] it and we know that he was doing that
[2:13:52] from the very beginning of his ministry
[2:13:54] they they thought he was a heretic in
[2:13:56] his day Jesus eating with unwashing
[2:13:58] hands and dealing with all this stuff
[2:14:01] you know he was actually tearing that
[2:14:03] Veil from the beginning of his ministry
[2:14:05] they couldn't deal with him they didn't
[2:14:06] know how to deal with him because he was
[2:14:08] making himself God in many different
[2:14:10] manifestations they wanted to kill him
[2:14:12] because it was just too much for them to
[2:14:14] deal with and it's going to be the same
[2:14:15] way for us today brothers and sisters
[2:14:17] they ain't going to want one of any one
[2:14:18] of us claiming that we're God
[2:14:20] but you know what when you have
[2:14:23] a lot of money in your pocket when you
[2:14:25] got a lot of money in your bank account
[2:14:26] you don't need to brag do you
[2:14:30] you don't have to go and tell the world
[2:14:32] hey I got lots of money you don't see my
[2:14:33] bank account I don't have to carry a Big
[2:14:35] Fat Sweaty wad of cash in my pocket
[2:14:37] bulging out for the world to see I'm
[2:14:39] loaded man look at me you know what
[2:14:41] spiritually speaking brothers and
[2:14:43] sisters you're loaded your bank account
[2:14:45] is endless you don't got nothing to
[2:14:48] prove we don't got nothing to prove
[2:14:49] we're going to go forward and just live
[2:14:51] this word
[2:14:52] and he'll do the dividing he'll do the
[2:14:55] the separating
[2:14:56] this Mercy Seat came into full view
[2:14:58] Brother Brad I'm out of the Mighty God
[2:15:00] unavailable for us now when the veil was
[2:15:02] rented Calvary The Mercy Seat came into
[2:15:03] Plain View but what happened it was
[2:15:06] hanging on Calvary dripping in blood
[2:15:10] many times we talk about that veil in
[2:15:12] the temple but what was on the cross
[2:15:13] brothers and sisters that was a veil
[2:15:16] it was there he says but what happened
[2:15:19] it was hanging on Calvary dripping in
[2:15:21] blood as they had took blood year after
[2:15:24] year at the cleansing of the sanctuary
[2:15:26] and the sprinkling of The Mercy Seat
[2:15:27] there
[2:15:29] god with his Great Mighty stroke of
[2:15:32] lightning power split the old Badger
[2:15:34] Veil from the top to the bottom and The
[2:15:37] Mercy Seat came into Plain View we can
[2:15:40] look at that and say Jesus Christ was
[2:15:43] The Mercy Seat that came into plain view
[2:15:45] my goodness to think that we have been
[2:15:48] given access back to that tree of life
[2:15:51] he goes on to say the real genuine Lamb
[2:15:53] of God was hanging in plain view on
[2:15:56] Calvary the real Mercy Seat when God had
[2:15:59] paid the price himself and became one of
[2:16:02] us and had manifested himself as a man
[2:16:06] to get acquainted with us and we
[2:16:09] acquainted with him The Mercy Seat was
[2:16:12] in plain view of all Israel on that day
[2:16:14] of atonement
[2:16:16] I just think this is fascinating I don't
[2:16:19] think I've ever looked at it this way I
[2:16:21] don't think I've ever looked at Jesus
[2:16:22] Christ as a veil I know that the
[2:16:25] children of Israel were veiled through
[2:16:27] Jesus Christ in his ministry but I don't
[2:16:28] think I've ever looked at Jesus Christ
[2:16:30] himself as a veil
[2:16:34] goes on to say but alas the traditions
[2:16:36] of the church fathers in that day had by
[2:16:39] their traditions
[2:16:40] had veiled the true Mercy Seat from the
[2:16:43] people
[2:16:45] if they would have known the scripture
[2:16:47] each piece would have come like the old
[2:16:50] Chinese tag you remember brother I'm
[2:16:52] talking about the Chinese Laundry how
[2:16:53] they would they couldn't write English
[2:16:55] so what they would do is they would
[2:16:56] write on it in in Chinese and they would
[2:16:58] just tear the tag and give you half and
[2:17:00] and and keep half and when you came back
[2:17:02] you would have to have the other half
[2:17:04] that would match up that's what he's
[2:17:05] referring to the old Chinese tag the Old
[2:17:07] Testament prophecy would have been
[2:17:09] fulfilled and it was and if they had
[2:17:11] been taught the scripture they would
[2:17:13] have seen The Mercy Seat as Moses said
[2:17:16] here that to this day they're veiled
[2:17:19] it's still over their hearts they don't
[2:17:21] see it and some people many people today
[2:17:23] are still failed they just don't see it
[2:17:26] they feel like there's something that
[2:17:27] they've got to do there's something
[2:17:28] where that they've got to go there's
[2:17:30] some some someone they've got to talk to
[2:17:32] maybe a great minister or a great
[2:17:34] ministry brothers and sisters you have
[2:17:36] all the ministry inside of you right now
[2:17:38] if you have the Holy Ghost in your life
[2:17:39] you have all of the ministry that you'll
[2:17:41] ever need right now in your life
[2:17:44] you don't have to have a healing
[2:17:46] campaign you don't have to have a great
[2:17:47] ministry you don't have to travel to a
[2:17:49] geographical location you just have to
[2:17:52] have the faith in your heart the
[2:17:54] evidence of Things Not Seen to be able
[2:17:56] to call the things that aren't as though
[2:17:57] they are and the things that are as
[2:17:59] though they aren't
[2:18:01] it gets crazy when you start doing that
[2:18:03] when you start saying No this problem
[2:18:04] it's not a problem no it's not a problem
[2:18:06] it's just the devil when we start doing
[2:18:09] that other people don't see it
[2:18:10] necessarily the same way
[2:18:14] I love how brother Bradham says it was
[2:18:16] the traditions of their fathers
[2:18:18] Traditions sometimes we can have
[2:18:20] Traditions brothers and sisters that can
[2:18:21] get in the way they can create a veil is
[2:18:24] what brother Branham says in this
[2:18:26] message the the the tradition can be you
[2:18:29] know what we've never done it this way
[2:18:30] before so why are you trying to do it
[2:18:32] this way this is different than we've
[2:18:33] always done imagine how much different
[2:18:35] it was in Jesus day
[2:18:37] when he was living out his ministry when
[2:18:39] he was the word made flesh dwelling
[2:18:41] among them if we're going to live in a
[2:18:43] position where we say you know what we
[2:18:44] have to do it the way that we've always
[2:18:45] done it you know we're only going to get
[2:18:47] what we've ever got because we're just
[2:18:48] going to keep doing the same way we've
[2:18:50] done it the children of Israel they
[2:18:51] didn't have a choice they had to follow
[2:18:53] that Pillar of Fire when it marched they
[2:18:55] had to follow that cloud
[2:18:57] the traditions of the fathers is what
[2:18:59] blinds them brother Branham says it now
[2:19:01] men women and delegates of this
[2:19:02] convention I want to say this without
[2:19:04] respective persons but in the my in in
[2:19:07] in in The View today in the view of what
[2:19:10] we're here for today I'm afraid that the
[2:19:12] traditions of the fathers the church
[2:19:13] fathers he's talking about it in 1964
[2:19:16] USA I'm afraid that the traditions of
[2:19:19] the fathers the church Affairs has hid
[2:19:21] this from too many people since the Holy
[2:19:23] Ghost has come in this last days
[2:19:26] as prophesied in the veil has been rent
[2:19:28] too many people try to hang to their
[2:19:31] traditions of the fathers and that's why
[2:19:33] they can't see this extreme joy and
[2:19:35] peace and things that the church has
[2:19:37] today yet it's in plain view of those
[2:19:40] who believe
[2:19:41] again I just can't help but think about
[2:19:43] that that thing going on in the United
[2:19:45] States in that University do you think
[2:19:47] those young people care about the way
[2:19:49] their parents worship back in the
[2:19:51] Anglican church or in the Catholic
[2:19:53] church or whatever Church they they're
[2:19:55] from they don't care about their
[2:19:57] Traditions they can see the spirit of
[2:19:59] God as moving and there's liberty here
[2:20:00] and they just want to worship they just
[2:20:02] want to praise God how much more the
[2:20:04] Sons and Daughters of God brothers and
[2:20:06] sisters don't let the traditions of the
[2:20:08] fathers get in the way you know Matthew
[2:20:10] 15 if if we could just turn to Matthew
[2:20:12] 15 we still have two minutes
[2:20:15] Matthew 15 verse 1. are we okay today
[2:20:21] maybe that's 20 minutes according to a
[2:20:23] preacher not that we lie
[2:20:25] Matthew 15.
[2:20:34] Matthew 15 verse 1.
[2:20:36] very familiar scripture
[2:20:38] then came Jesus came to Jesus scribes
[2:20:41] and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem
[2:20:44] saying why do the disciples transgress
[2:20:46] the tradition of the elders
[2:20:49] here he is tearing the Veil
[2:20:51] right there
[2:20:53] why why do why why do the disciples
[2:20:56] transgress the tradition of the elders
[2:20:59] for they wash not their hands when they
[2:21:00] eat bread
[2:21:02] but he answered and said unto them
[2:21:05] why do ye also transgress the
[2:21:07] Commandment of God by your tradition
[2:21:10] for God commanded honor thy father and
[2:21:13] mother
[2:21:14] and he that curseth father or mother let
[2:21:17] him die the death
[2:21:19] but ye say whosoever shall say to his
[2:21:23] father or his mother it is a gift by
[2:21:26] whatsoever thou mightest be profited by
[2:21:28] me and honor not his father or his
[2:21:30] mother he shall be free
[2:21:32] thus he have made the Commandment of God
[2:21:34] of none effect by your tradition
[2:21:38] he says ye Hypocrites well did isaiahs
[2:21:40] prophesy of you saying the people
[2:21:42] draweth nigh unto me with their mouth
[2:21:44] and honoreth me with their lips but
[2:21:46] their heart is far from me
[2:21:49] but in vain do they worship me teaching
[2:21:51] for doctrines the Commandments of men
[2:21:54] and he called unto the multitude and
[2:21:56] said and and said unto them hear and
[2:21:59] understand not that which goeth into the
[2:22:02] mouth defileth a man but that which
[2:22:04] cometh out of the mouth this defileth
[2:22:08] the man
[2:22:10] our traditions and our teachings
[2:22:12] brothers and sisters can get in the way
[2:22:14] of this word of God from having the
[2:22:16] position that it rightfully wants in our
[2:22:18] lives that he rightfully wants in our
[2:22:20] lives you know it's interesting that he
[2:22:22] talks about honoring your father and
[2:22:23] mother and and saying in verse 5 but she
[2:22:26] say whosoever shall say to his father or
[2:22:28] a mother it's a gift by whatsoever thou
[2:22:31] mightest be profited by me what he's
[2:22:33] talking about is saying you know what
[2:22:34] I'm I'm your gift I'm the one that's
[2:22:37] actually here for you I know more than
[2:22:40] you I can actually teach you I actually
[2:22:43] can give you you need to respect me now
[2:22:45] because I'm me see me and it goes
[2:22:48] against the word of God it's not a
[2:22:50] conditional thing to honor your mother
[2:22:52] or your father and we talked about it
[2:22:53] how teenagers come to a place I'm sorry
[2:22:56] but I've experienced it I'm sure a
[2:22:58] couple other people might have where you
[2:23:00] might just become equally smart with
[2:23:02] your parents I'll say it that way I felt
[2:23:04] like I was smarter than mine
[2:23:06] but you know what it's just this
[2:23:08] scripture it's this scripture coming to
[2:23:10] pass thinking that there's maybe
[2:23:12] something good in me you know what
[2:23:13] there's nothing good in any of us all we
[2:23:15] need to do is humble ourselves to the
[2:23:17] word of God and not let any tradition
[2:23:19] not not think that we can do anything on
[2:23:21] our own it's only by his spirit that we
[2:23:24] have the ability to live and do what we
[2:23:26] do it's only by his grace that we're
[2:23:28] saved through faith in his word
[2:23:30] not of Works lest any man should boast
[2:23:35] you know what we're talking about is god
[2:23:36] with skin on brother Bradham says in
[2:23:38] this message will you when you come out
[2:23:40] from behind the veil you'll be in full
[2:23:42] view of the people then
[2:23:44] that they can see that something has
[2:23:46] happened to you
[2:23:48] the veiled word
[2:23:50] I just love how he brings it right down
[2:23:52] to our level I'll call the musicians
[2:23:54] because I am actually ending and look at
[2:23:56] that can you believe it
[2:23:58] I got it in at the end
[2:24:01] oh
[2:24:02] I'll show you afterwards it's been a
[2:24:03] needle poking me in the back of the
[2:24:05] skull
[2:24:06] for half the service
[2:24:08] we're talking about god with skin on
[2:24:12] he says well you when you come out from
[2:24:15] behind the veil you'll be in full view
[2:24:16] of the people then that they can see
[2:24:19] that something has happened to you
[2:24:22] the veiled word to the unbeliever
[2:24:26] but in full view of the believer
[2:24:29] it's beautiful isn't it when we look at
[2:24:31] one another when we see Believers we see
[2:24:33] the full word and view this is what
[2:24:35] Brother Brad I'm saying here we're
[2:24:36] seeing the full word in view it's not
[2:24:39] another man it's not another woman it's
[2:24:41] Jesus Christ a full word in plain view
[2:24:44] in our day
[2:24:46] he says that Jesus Christ the same
[2:24:48] yesterday today and forever
[2:24:50] then it was God in them days it was God
[2:24:52] in a man his son Jesus Christ we believe
[2:24:55] that not just a prophet not just an
[2:24:57] ordinary man ordinary human it was God
[2:25:00] in Christ God in a man the fullness of
[2:25:03] the godhead bodily in man God in man and
[2:25:07] we've read this in Ephesians we could go
[2:25:10] there but for time's sake I won't I'll
[2:25:12] spare you for it you know what it says
[2:25:13] in there that we should be able to
[2:25:15] comprehend with All Saints what this
[2:25:17] mystery of God is
[2:25:19] the height of it the depth of it the
[2:25:20] length of it the breadth of it that we
[2:25:22] should be able to comprehend this with
[2:25:23] all saints that we should be able to
[2:25:25] recognize that there's no more mystery
[2:25:27] and and and that we should be filled
[2:25:29] with not just a part of the fullness of
[2:25:31] God but all of the fullness of God
[2:25:35] brother Adam says we believe that not
[2:25:36] just a prophet not just an ordinary man
[2:25:38] ordinary human it was God in Christ God
[2:25:40] and a man the fullness of the godhead
[2:25:42] bodily in man God in man that's who
[2:25:46] Jesus Christ was and is and forever will
[2:25:49] be we don't want to ever go off on a
[2:25:52] tangent that way maybe stand with me as
[2:25:53] we close this morning he says now it's
[2:25:56] God in men
[2:25:59] it's not just God and a man don't put
[2:26:01] God and William Mary and Bradham and say
[2:26:03] it's just God and a man now we're
[2:26:05] waiting for something to happen if you
[2:26:07] do that you're doing what brother
[2:26:08] Branham said man is always good at
[2:26:10] looking back at what God has always done
[2:26:12] and looking forward to what God's always
[2:26:13] doing but ignoring what he's doing right
[2:26:15] now brothers and sisters right now he's
[2:26:18] trying to tell you that you are God in
[2:26:20] flesh now it's God and Men the fullness
[2:26:23] of God in the godhead bodily in his
[2:26:26] entire church manifesting himself
[2:26:28] fulfilling his word
[2:26:31] as we March forwards as we live this
[2:26:33] word in our lives brothers and sisters
[2:26:35] it's exactly what the prophet of God
[2:26:36] says here he says now we find God in all
[2:26:38] Angels ages has had skin on it he God
[2:26:42] has been hid behind a veil badge your
[2:26:45] skin
[2:26:45] you know I'm going to close with this
[2:26:47] scripture here
[2:26:49] because we we read this here in in
[2:26:52] second Corinthians
[2:26:56] I'll just read it here not as Moses
[2:27:00] which put a veil over his face that the
[2:27:02] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[2:27:04] look to the end of that which is
[2:27:05] abolished but their minds were blinded
[2:27:07] For unto this day remaineth the same
[2:27:09] Veil untaken away in the reading of the
[2:27:11] Old Testament which Veil is done away in
[2:27:13] Christ
[2:27:14] but even unto this day when Moses is
[2:27:16] read the veil is upon their heart
[2:27:17] nevertheless when it shall be turned to
[2:27:20] the Lord the veil shall be taken away
[2:27:22] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[2:27:24] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[2:27:25] Liberty but we all with open face
[2:27:30] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[2:27:33] Lord are changed into the same image
[2:27:35] from glory to glory even as by the
[2:27:38] spirit of the Lord
[2:27:41] we know that in First Corinthians 13 He
[2:27:43] says for we know in part and we prophesy
[2:27:46] in part but when that which is perfect
[2:27:47] is come brothers and sisters then that
[2:27:50] which isn't in part shall be done away
[2:27:51] with
[2:27:53] that which is perfect is coming
[2:27:56] the word of God for our day we have a
[2:27:58] perfect word and you know what we've
[2:28:00] been given through Revelation in this
[2:28:01] word we've been given a perfect
[2:28:03] realization of this word a perfect
[2:28:06] revelation of this word if we accept
[2:28:08] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:28:10] and forever if we don't put them out
[2:28:12] there and make them something in the
[2:28:13] future and look at them in the past and
[2:28:14] say that he's something back there but
[2:28:16] if we accept him as he is today then we
[2:28:19] have a perfect realization a perfect
[2:28:21] revelation of this word when that which
[2:28:23] is perfect is come and that which is
[2:28:25] perfect is come then that which is in
[2:28:28] part shall be done away when I was a
[2:28:30] child I spake as a child and understood
[2:28:31] as a child but thought as a child but
[2:28:33] when I became a man I put away childish
[2:28:35] things
[2:28:36] spiritual maturity understanding there
[2:28:38] comes a time where our maturity level
[2:28:40] grows to a place where we're no longer
[2:28:42] children coming to church we're
[2:28:44] recognizing that we don't need a great
[2:28:45] ministry somewhere out there that we are
[2:28:48] that great ministry as we live this word
[2:28:50] in our lives when I was a child I spake
[2:28:52] as a child I understood as a child I
[2:28:54] thought as a child but when I became a
[2:28:55] man I put away childish things for now
[2:28:57] we see through a glass Darkly he know
[2:28:59] that he was talking to the Corinthians
[2:29:01] back there now we see through a glass
[2:29:02] Darkly but then as Moses desired
[2:29:05] brothers and sisters he could only see
[2:29:07] the higher parts of God and he said I'll
[2:29:09] put you up upon that rock of Revelation
[2:29:11] and your face will shine because of that
[2:29:13] Revelation oh but Paul prophesying of
[2:29:16] that he says now we see through a glass
[2:29:18] Darkly but then we'll see face to face
[2:29:20] brothers and sisters as we look into
[2:29:22] this word of God for our day we see him
[2:29:25] face to face oh my
[2:29:27] we see we'll know then face to face face
[2:29:31] to face and now I know in part but then
[2:29:33] shall I be known even as I am also known
[2:29:38] you know this is the last quote and then
[2:29:40] I'm gonna quit brother Branham says the
[2:29:42] new birth
[2:29:43] is Christ is a revelation
[2:29:45] God has revealed to you this great
[2:29:48] mystery and that's the new birth it's
[2:29:51] not just being a Christian and saying
[2:29:53] that I'm Associated and I I do good
[2:29:55] things in my life it's truly having the
[2:29:58] baptism of the Holy Spirit of Jesus
[2:30:00] Christ in your life it's not just being
[2:30:03] an associate member the new birth is
[2:30:05] Christ is a revelation God has revealed
[2:30:08] to you this great mystery and that's the
[2:30:10] new birth now what are you going to do
[2:30:11] when you get all that group together
[2:30:12] well the Revelation is in Perfect
[2:30:14] Harmony and God expressing it through
[2:30:16] his word by the same actions the same
[2:30:18] things that he did making the word
[2:30:19] manifest think about those people down
[2:30:21] in the states brothers and sisters when
[2:30:23] you read that quote when you listen to
[2:30:24] that what are you going to do when you
[2:30:26] get that group together whether
[2:30:27] Revelation is perfectly in harmony where
[2:30:29] they know the spirit of God is there and
[2:30:31] where there is Liberty where the spirit
[2:30:33] of God is it's God expressing it through
[2:30:35] his word by the same actions the same
[2:30:37] things that he did making his word
[2:30:39] manifest he says oh if the church only
[2:30:41] knew its position it will one day
[2:30:44] then the Rapture will go
[2:30:47] when it knows what it is
[2:30:50] what is it
[2:30:51] Jesus Christ
[2:30:53] manifest in flesh
[2:30:55] because the great mystery is that the
[2:30:57] twain will become one we're going to
[2:30:59] talk about this message further I think
[2:31:01] there's more to it but you know brother
[2:31:03] Branham talks about how different people
[2:31:05] have different claims on his life
[2:31:07] he's he's a husband to his wife he's a
[2:31:10] father to his child he's a son to his
[2:31:12] parents there's different manifestations
[2:31:14] but it can still be just one person and
[2:31:17] many different claims on that one person
[2:31:19] it's the same with Jesus Christ
[2:31:22] oh if the church only knew its position
[2:31:24] it will one day then the Rapture will go
[2:31:26] when it knows what it is he says now
[2:31:28] notice you say brother Branham but that
[2:31:30] that ain't he says oh yes it is too
[2:31:33] prophet of God saying this oh yes it is
[2:31:35] too don't doubt it brothers and sisters
[2:31:38] yes it is too you know I just couldn't
[2:31:41] help but think about this When I Was
[2:31:42] preparing this this is getting a bit
[2:31:44] crazy talking like this but I just
[2:31:46] believe it's really the call for our day
[2:31:47] brothers and sisters it's it's it's not
[2:31:49] about learning how to live better on
[2:31:51] this world it's understanding that there
[2:31:52] is a call for our day where the spirit
[2:31:54] of the Lord is there is liberty and the
[2:31:56] Liberty isn't to get excited and have
[2:31:58] great song services and have a a great
[2:32:00] big feel-good group of people it's about
[2:32:02] recognizing that that Liberty is going
[2:32:05] to be an eternal Liberty that when we
[2:32:07] truly realize our position than the
[2:32:10] Rapture is going to go the dead in
[2:32:12] Christ will rise first and then we who
[2:32:14] are alive and remain shall meet together
[2:32:16] with them in the clouds we will see
[2:32:19] Jesus in the clouds and you know the
[2:32:21] children of Israel when they are
[2:32:22] crossing over into their Promised Land
[2:32:24] that's what we're talking about crossing
[2:32:26] over into our promised land when they
[2:32:27] went they said you know what no one has
[2:32:29] ever gone this way before you need to
[2:32:32] keep your eyes focused on that Ark the
[2:32:34] the the the the Levites are gonna go
[2:32:36] They're Gonna March they've been given
[2:32:38] the marching orders from God through the
[2:32:40] prophet
[2:32:41] there was a transition from profit to
[2:32:43] profit and we know that Joshua didn't
[2:32:46] have his commission until Moses was off
[2:32:48] the scene but then God started to speak
[2:32:51] to the people through him and he said
[2:32:52] you know what I'm going to magnify
[2:32:53] myself through you because he's gone but
[2:32:57] he said keep your eyes on that Ark
[2:33:00] keep your eyes on the word
[2:33:02] and I want to say today brothers and
[2:33:04] sisters keep your eyes on that word
[2:33:06] don't don't keep your eyes on the works
[2:33:08] don't look for Works to say if I see
[2:33:10] works then I'll try and keep my eyes on
[2:33:12] the word don't don't do it the whole
[2:33:14] world's doing that there's a whole bunch
[2:33:16] of people down in the states at a
[2:33:17] university right now doing that don't do
[2:33:19] that keep your eyes on the yard keep
[2:33:21] your eyes on the word
[2:33:24] gotta recognize that nobody has ever
[2:33:26] gone this way before nobody has ever
[2:33:28] gone the way of the Rapture the general
[2:33:30] resurrection and Rapture of the church
[2:33:32] that's never happened before there's
[2:33:34] been a couple of people that actually
[2:33:36] pleased God and we're not we know that
[2:33:38] but but the general resurrection and
[2:33:40] Rapture has never happened nobody has
[2:33:42] ever gone this way before and I'm not
[2:33:43] saying I've got the words of wisdom to
[2:33:45] get us there all I'm saying is put the
[2:33:47] word of God first in your life take the
[2:33:49] word that was given to us through the
[2:33:50] message of the hour the ministry of
[2:33:52] Jesus Christ through William Mary take
[2:33:54] that message and just make that your
