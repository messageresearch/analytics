something dropped in my heart tonight when I was picking the songs on I thought Lord you know as we're studying this this church age book this isn't the words of a man as brother Logan prayed it's the words of almighty God and and we thinking about it it was the same mzc I was thinking Lord this is amazing the mzc that appeared to Abraham told the secrets behind behind him Sarah's secret his heart that same God came and min ministered to us and spoke through our Prophet we are so blessed I just thought my goodness Lord I I I'm sorry I I haven't maybe paid enough attention to that that thought but that mzc that created a body that stepped into that body spoke to Abraham is here tonight that same Lord Jesus let's sing these songs in Zion give him praise as brother Logan prayed I believe it's so important to adore him to worship him he's our Heavenly bridegroom he's our husband let's sing it to him tonight who taught the son where to stand in the morning who told the ocean you can only go

each one for coming tonight if you have your Bibles like to continue on in our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages from the sardan church age in Revelations chapter 3 Revelations chapter 3:1 and unto the angel of the church in Sardis is right these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we just thank you for your word thank you for the the explanation Lord the exposition of the seven Church ages thank you for the Revelation that you've given us Lord the ability to hear what your spirit says we just ask that you would bless the reading of your word tonight father bless the reading of this book tonight Lord help us father to maybe digest this in just a different way father maybe be able to look at what you have written here in just a different way father just a little different tonight father we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated thank you each one for the specials incredible just uh couple of announcements before we go um tonight we uh have a prayer meeting on December the 5th we want to remember the panetas uh sister Fay is leaving on the 29th and uh brother mvin is going to leave on the 18th of December as well we have brother GIF marufu here on December the 8th uh the Youth Event is on December the 15th and a communion service communion testimony service on December the 31st God bless you tonight carrying on in our our study of the exposition of the seven Church ages I'm just really enjoying this section on Election understanding that it pertains to us uh there's a lot of people that it pertains to but uh I believe when we understand that we're truly elect it really means something when we can hear it um spelled out this way I'll just get right into it we have uh 40 minutes is and that's just fine for the record I want you to know that I enjoy the specials and I don't get fussed I'm not excited I'm not rushed I'm I'm not worried if the Lord wants us here for 15 minutes then that's what we'll do God bless you brother Paul it's good to see your face again he's back from Nigeria visiting his wife hopefully she can come soon paragraph 150 out of the uh sardan Church age here now let us go another step he says but before we do let us review our case thus far first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was purposed in himself I just love that it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the the foundation of the world in him she was forn and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her wow when I when I think about this and I I read these words and I hear myself say them I think who is she I would like to meet her can you imagine meeting that one that sin won't even be able to be imputed unto wow she's a special woman that one but I can't help but think tonight brothers and sisters go home and look in the mirror don't even go home just go to the washroom and look in the mirror go and stand in front of the window and look in the glass because that's her sin can't even be imputed you won't even come to the Judgment why can never come into condemnation she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her my my my my my just think about it it's kind of like Joseph's bride hey nobody could bring an accusation to Joseph's bride not one of his Brethren not not anybody in the land could actually bring a single accusation to Joseph's wife Romans 4:8 blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin so that's I just love the way the prophet does this he always takes it back to the scripture this is not just him bringing something up saying that she will never come into the Judgment hey if if if she is the bride then then she truly is a man my blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin Romans 48 he goes on to say but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members is written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second Resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as are spoke of in Matthew 25 in this class also are those who do not worship the Beast or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life thirdly there are the borderline Christians such as we saw in Israel coming out of Egypt these had their names in The Book of Life and their Works written in the books these having failed to obey God and being void of the spirit though even the signs and wonders were amongst them will have their names removed from The Book of Life amongst this group will be the ones like Judas who though entirely void of the spirit but are religious will have a manifestation in their lives and though on the books were not the elected in him such also as balum will in that group fourth and finally are the ones whose names have never been or will ever be written on the books such are found in Revelations 138 and Revelation 17 verse 8 I I personally believe brothers and sisters when we look at this the bride doesn't doesn't elect herself by realizing ing that there's people that will never be able to see this I believe it causes a sigh and a cry for this to think that there's people we just freely get this gift of life we just freely get this opportunity to hear what the spirit says we get to go and you know even just to be in the city just to have eternal life however that looks however that happens but to think that we're truly elected bride of Jesus Christ and then to see these other people that's why I can't help but Marvel when you hear someone talk about people being Canon fodder I know that we've all heard about it we've all heard it foolish virgin at best that kind of discussion I don't believe that's truly the elected bride speaking when we hear that if it is maybe it's an immature version of that person and I say Lord help me because I know I thought it but these people they never had a chance they were created for for one purpose just like pharaoh to be a tool in the hand of God to be destroyed my Revelations 138 and 178 and all that dwell on the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into ption and they that dwell on the Earth shall wander whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world yet they beheld the Beast that was and is not and yet is Jesus said that a certain group would accept one who came in his own name that one is the Antichrist so he wasn't saying that they would accept the one that came in jesus' name there except the one that came in his very own name and said look at me and and that is exactly what it said says of them in Revelations 138 and 178 these were ordained of God but not unto election and with this group is such that are as Pharaoh Romans 9:17 and 22 for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction none of these would be placed on the records of life I'm not saying that there is no record of them no doubt there is some kind of a record of them but not in the records of Life their purpose of existence has been dealt with slightly in the rest of this book but we can add two more scriptures Proverbs 16:4 the Lord hath made the wicked for the day of evil job 21:30 the wicked is reserved to the day of Destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of Wrath since this portion of the word is hard for the human mind to grasp it must be accepted and believed by faith some will be offended but what I have set forth because they fail to understand the sovereignty of God which sets forth that God is God and because he is God one cannot defeat his counsels or thwart his will and purpose and I personally believe the ones that get offended by this are potentially the ones that maybe love the Lord but just don't have the ability to hear what we hear and that's nobody's fault because of election and we need to have Grace for those people because it certainly could be an elected bride of Jesus Christ who just hasn't come to maturity yet I love how brother depicts it a little later on in this discussion he talks about the wheat plant and how you can't have the grain you can't have the truly elected seed without the plant you have to have the plant the life comes through the plant but it always starts in the seed but this is God's purpose he goes on to say but he being omnipotent is ruling in all Affairs and is doing whatever he will with all his creation because all were created for his good pleasure period therefore as Paul says if God should take one lump of clay and make of that same lump one vessel unto honor and another vessel unto dishonor who can be offended and cry against him that he has the right to do this on the grounds of creation alone we cannot deny yet he went even further for according to Romans 14: 7-9 we have the irrefutable proof that Jesus Paid the purchase price of the whole world and therefore he can do as he Wills with his own I love what brother Bram says a little later here Romans 14: 7 to9 for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living now this is what I was talking about here brother Bram says ownership not relationship is here but because of the ownership because of the Revelation that comes through that ownership for the elected there becomes a relationship a very intimate relationship that only a husband and wife can have John 172 says as thou Hast given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou Hast given him now if we impute omniscience to to God we must also accept that he is perfect in wisdom and righteousness this plan of election and reprobation is the wisdom of God revealed in all ages even as it says in Ephesians 1 verses 3-1 and I I just can't help but think this has to be one of my all-time favorite scriptures here he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us nobody else having predestinated us and that doesn't mean just Calgary Living Word I want to say it this way having predestinated us he that hath an ear to hear what the spirit saith to the church today having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Christ Jesus to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved just made me think about it how do we know that he loves us because he said so right he his love is divine and his love for us is only in the Bel loved he says in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will not looking for the discovery of the mystery we know what his will is it's been made very clear to us through the Vindicated prophet in the age his will is his word and if we're willing to apply his word to the letter then we know his will having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will brothers and sisters there's no accidents there's no no mishaps there's no things that happen just incidentally everything is after the counsel of his own will thus if God was so designed has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that if it also states that there are all are if it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of the book of life but in the forn knowledge of God they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that and if there are those whose names were never placed upon a record of life we must accept that also reading through this it just makes it so real how we cannot look around we can't look at a brother we can't look at a sister and say well that brother does this and that sister does that and and it'll be okay for me if I just do it their way you can't do that you have to do it according to the word brothers and sisters you have to do it according to the spirit inside of you that leads you through the word this is how close it is today so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible but by that token Spirit of the life of Jesus Christ Living out through us we're going to follow this word and it's going to take us to this predestinated position in Christ Jesus I think it's just aming amazing when we look at this though we can't look around and and judge anyone let's just judge ourselves and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white Throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of God who are his Brethren then we cannot but accept that for who knoweth the mind of the Lord that he should instruct him rather let us be subject in in faith to him who is our father and live to understand this subject even more clearly it will now be wise to approach it from the standpoint of the church Through the Ages up until now we have been thinking in terms of the removal of the names of individuals now we want to consider not the individuals but the groups represent Ed in the church my excuse me there been a couple of Sundays I haven't preached I guess I feel like preaching certainly enjoyed what brother mvin had to say and I think there's so much there that uh I just appreciate appreciate brother mvin and his approach and all that he does for the body God bless you brother brother Ram goes on to say to do so so we will liken the church Through the Ages to the wheat plant a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce and multiply itself through a certain process during a certain period of time that Single Seed will die but in dying the life that was in it will come up into a plant which will turn in turn be the bearer or Carrier of that life which is to come back to originality in a multiplied form Jesus the great Royal seed died that matchless one who is the life of the church stands in the midst of the church for all seven Church ages giving his life to the church carrier or Bearer to the end I just love this his very life will be reproduced in bodies like unto his in the resurrection and I I just can't help but think about this brothers and sisters I I don't think that he's just talking about the resurrection and Rapture I think he's talking about the literal life of Jesus Christ Living out through his bride speaking the word and actually causing other people to hear what the spirit says to the church he goes on to say it is at the resurrection that the Royal seed will see many Royal seeds like unto himself and they will be even as he is for it says John we shall be like him this is what John the Baptist was referring to when he said Jesus would gather the wheed into the Garner that was the resurrection where the redeemed who had been elected unto eternal life came in now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce The Original Seed in a multiplied form is The Book of Life I repeat this history or record of this wheat plant is The Book of Life of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life this is convincingly seen by examining the wheat plant a bare seed is sown soon a blade is seen but that is not the wheat yet then it grows into a stock this is not yet wheat life is in there but not the wheat then at the end of the stock is a little Spike that sends out a tassel still a wheat plant but no wheat yet then the plant is polonized and we see the chaff grow this looks Mighty like the wheat but is not yet seed then forms the wheat in the husk it is now back to what it was originally now the ripened wheat is harvested Jesus Christ died he gave his life that life was to come back upon the church and bring many sons like unto himself unto glory in the resurrection but as the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat seed even so there had to be a church which would be the carrier of the Life of Christ and that's where I my last statement comes from there has to be a church who is going to be the carrier of the Life of Christ as the blade stock tassel and husks were the carriers for the seed but not the seed itself so the church corporate Through the Ages has been the carrier of the true seed though not the seed itself that is why we can say The Book of Life is the whole wheat plant let's go over that again here is the that Original Seed that was planted it produced a blade that wasn't it it produced a stock not it either here come husks in which the wheat is to form that isn't it the tassel appears then pollen falls on those pistols I just can't help but think brothers and sisters there's a time where that true plant gets pollinated by the words someone somewhere along away says something some words of life and it pollinates those pistols the spirit of Jesus Christ in that person imparts life pollinates that seed he goes on to say part of that plant is quickened something out of that Original Seed that came up through the rest of the plant turns into a seed why didn't the whole plant go into seed because it was created to that end just part of that plant can go back to being seed because just part of that wheat plant is eternal life wheat you have a perfect type of that in Israel leaving Egypt I just love how brother Bram does this because he's already said this in this in this chapter but just to hear him say it again he just continually um underpins it you have a perfect type of that in Israel leaving Egypt they came came out about 2 million strong all escaped through the sacrificial blood all were baptized in the Red Sea all came up out of the water enjoying Holy Spirit manifestation and blessings all ate angel food all drank of the rock that followed them yet except for a very few they were not but carriers for the children who should follow them and go into Canaan land all Israel is not Israel and all but a tiny minority had their names blotted out of the book of life so sad but it's God's choice why we have the same right today in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the Book of Life first John 51-12 and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and that life is in his son he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the Son of God hath not life how do we have the Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Bram says it loud and clear without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're lost am it's vital without the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are lost carrying on he says and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that great Royal seed Jesus Christ was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because by Spirit they are original I just can't help but think he makes that present tense the way that paragraph is written it's so good he goes on to say now we can see why the redeemed bought back by original owner bride she was in him as Eve was in Adam cannot ever have her member names taken off the Record She is a part of him she is in the throne she can never be judged everyone in the Bride is a member of him and he loses none John 639 but that is not so concerning the all in the Book of Life for amongst them are even those like Judas Etc who have a part in the record but their names are removed we can see those who come in the last days and after having done wonderful Works Jesus will say that he never knew them that's why brothers and sisters don't look at Works don't look for Works to be your manifestation of whether you've got the holy ghost or not don't don't be trying to to do things don't be working your way into heaven because it's not going to work the only thing you can do is get the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true seal of God according to the Vindicated prophet's message when you do that all of the rest of the works and manifestations will follow but if we try and make it a Works based gospel a Works based message we're gonna find ourselves exactly where he's talking about right now it is not that he was not aware of them his omniscience precludes that but they were not forn as in the bride and neither were they forn as amongst the righteous of the second Resurrection they bore no fruit because they were outside the word did not abide in it and they therefore were sentenced to death Lord have mercy then as we have previously shown there are those who stood for the bride and were an aid and comfort to her those had their names remaining on the book of life and go into life Everlasting finally there are those such as pharaoh who never had their names on the book of life and these are cast into the Lake of Fire also thus the grain of wheat that became a plant for the Harvest is the record of the church even as not all the wheat plant is wheat seed and is not all the plant used in the Harvest so with the church all the church is not the bride and neither is it all given eternal life but a part of it is gathered into the Garner and a part of it is kept that it might enter into eternal life in the second resurrection and a part of it is a counted chaff is burned in the Lake of Fire and that is exactly what John the Baptist and Jesus said for John said that the wheat would be the garnered and the chaff burned Jesus said bind the tears and then gather the wheat The ecumenical move will bind the tear churches together for the tears must be bound first and though their end is burning they are not burned at their binding but are reserved to a later date which is at the end of the Thousand Years or the second Resurrection I just love this next sentence here brothers and sisters this caught my attention and I'm probably going to study this out for a bit it but once the tears are bound the Rapture can take place and does so at some time between the binding and the revelation of the Antichrist it's an interesting sentence that one then will come the day when all will stand together as seen in Daniel 7:10 the king will be there with his bride and in front of them will be the multi udes who are to be judged yes all are there we talked about it last time what a scene that will be to see every single human being that was ever created before the foundation of the world all in one place at one time how many people will that be wow all the books are opened a final disposition of all is made the Harvest is indeed over the books once opened are closed closed in concluding this subject for this time let me refer to a statement made at its beginning wherein I said that not one scripture spoke of the Lord presently compiling a record of names that is indeed so however there is a scripture pointing to a future compilation it's in the 87th Psalm this Psalm speaks of the Lord writing up the names of all those born in Zion let's just turn over there we still have a few minutes this is working out perfectly we're going to wind up the sardan church age tonight and next time Lord willing will'll begin the Philadelphian Church age Psalms 87 Psalms 87 it says his foundation is in the Holy mountains the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob glorious things are spoken of thee Oh city of God saah I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me behold philistia and Ty with Ethiopia this man was born there and of Zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her and the highest himself shall establish her the Lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born there saah and as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there all my Springs are in thee I think that's just an amazing scripture there's so much we could get into but he just mentions it here and he doesn't really say it so I wanted to make sure that we read it we had a reference point for it Lord willing we'll get into it a little bit later um just picking up where we left off here that is indeed so however there is a scripture pointing to a future compilation it is in the 87th Psalm this Psalm speaks of the Lord writing up the names of all those born in Zion on no account can it be presumed that God has to wait until the end of the ages or that period of time dealing with Zion in order to know who all might be born in Zion again that would preclude omniscience surely he knows who all comprise that number but what is it is it not simply the revised rule wherein God simply places in a new record those names which remained after the second resurrection that pertained to Zion surely that is it and I will confess his name before my father and his angels roll call in heaven my is there going to be people born there that's what my mind says are there going to be people born there I don't know job for job 144 and 15 if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change Come Thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou Wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands the great Shepherd is calling his Sheep by name I'll call the musicians the creative voice of God is calling them forth from the dust or changing their atoms even though they had not fallen asleep it is the rapture it is the great marriage supper of the Lamb and his bride and we know the prophet for our age the Vindicated prophet he said the Rapture is a process it is not a single event it culminates with a single event but it's been taking place for a long time am but the Rapture is not the only roll call there at the second Resurrection at the great white Throne judgment will be names will names be confessed before the father and his angels now I have been told by those who know that the sweetest sound to a human ear is the sound of that person's name how people love to have their names before the public how they love ACC claim but no earthly voice will ever sound your name as sweetly as will the voice of God if you your name is in the Book of Life and remains there to be revealed before the Holy Angels my what a day that will be when we hear Jesus say father they confessed my name before men in the days of their Earthly pilgrimage now I will confess their names before thee and all the Heavenly angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches once more the spirit hath spoken once again we have reviewed the record of what the spirit said to another age and we have found the record correct another age has gone by and it was fulfilled exactly as he said it would be what a consolation that is to us who hope to be in the last day Bride for it causes our hearts to leap for joy that he is faithful and will perform his every promise if he was faithful and true to those of the sardan age then he is just as true to this our age if they by his grace and power will be received and commended by [Music] him then so are we let us go there for to Perfection and meet the Lord in the air and be forever with him maybe stand with me tonight as we close God bless you let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we know that there's nothing that we can do there's nothing that we could have done there's nothing we could ever do father to Merit your grace and Lord Jesus to know what it means to experience your grace father it's not about works of righteousness it's by your grace alone that we are able to hear your spirit speak to this age and father when we do heed that voice when we humble ourselves to that voice that speaks to the age it causes something to Stir It causes a life to come forth and Lord we know that we are in the wheat stage of the wheat plant father we don't want to try and put anybody in or anybody out father we just want to look at ourselves in the mirror of your word and say Lord Jesus be it unto me
