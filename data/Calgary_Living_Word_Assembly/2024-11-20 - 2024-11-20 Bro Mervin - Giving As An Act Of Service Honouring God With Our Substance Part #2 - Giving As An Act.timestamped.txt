[42:36] just put things together and I know you
[42:39] cannot exhaust the word of God because
[42:41] it's it's overflowing amen and even the
[42:45] message of the hour with 1,00 sermons
[42:48] when you read it and listen to it it
[42:50] will always be a new book amen because
[42:54] Revelation upon Revelation but we cannot
[42:56] go beyond the revelation of the Prophet
[42:58] amen we know that but then the thing is
[43:01] it it's already revealed to
[43:03] him right and then it's revealed to us
[43:07] when we think that it's a new revelation
[43:09] to us and then you will check the
[43:11] message of the hour it's already there
[43:14] amen even BR Branham was will just speak
[43:16] it under the anointing and then he will
[43:18] just even don't understand or didn't
[43:20] understand what he meant right but then
[43:23] for us we were given this message for
[43:26] rapture
[43:27] amen it's a special message for us Class
[43:31] A people A1 of the best quality I will I
[43:35] will encourage you brothers and sisters
[43:37] that you are special I special we are
[43:39] special amen and uh maybe if you can put
[43:44] the slides brother just for a test uh it
[43:46] will be a part two amen so giving as an
[43:51] act of worship honoring God with our
[43:54] substance amen and it's a part two
[43:57] and uh while you're standing I don't
[43:59] want to keep you standing too long still
[44:03] the same scripture Proverbs 9 to10 honor
[44:07] the Lord with thy substance and with the
[44:11] first
[44:12] fruits first fruits of all thine
[44:15] increase so shall thy barns be filled
[44:19] with plenty and thy presence shall burst
[44:23] out with new wine let's bow our hearts
[44:26] this morning oh Lord Jesus we want to
[44:28] thank you Lord for your goodness and
[44:31] mercy to us oh
[44:35] God we're just so thankful unto you oh
[44:37] Lord Jesus that uh you have elected us
[44:40] even before the foundation of the world
[44:42] Lord to
[44:44] understand these things
[44:47] lord it's not because we're good we're
[44:51] intelligent or we're righteous but
[44:55] because you have elected us
[44:58] you have sovereignty you have your you
[45:02] you have the choice Lord to to elect
[45:07] whom you wanted to but we know because
[45:09] of your forn knowledge you were able to
[45:12] elect us you called us Justified us and
[45:15] transform
[45:17] us according to your image oh Lord and
[45:20] we want to be transform this this
[45:22] morning oh Lord not
[45:24] only the the day uh going moving forward
[45:28] Lord but every time Lord that
[45:31] we we in our lives Lord that you will
[45:35] you will be in us and with us Lord so
[45:39] that we can represent you Lord wherever
[45:42] we go because that's your main purpose
[45:45] Lord to have a bride Lord where you can
[45:49] dwell in that can represent you
[45:52] Lord in this
[45:54] world oh God we love you and we glorify
[45:57] you have preminent on the service in
[46:00] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[46:02] amen you may be
[46:11] seated we know that this
[46:14] scripture encourages us Believers
[46:18] Amen to honor God by dedicating the best
[46:21] of our resources Amen to him and uh we
[46:25] mentioned last time the sub substance
[46:27] means anything material possession
[46:31] wealth t uh time amen and that's the
[46:36] substance that uh this scripture is
[46:39] talking about amen and the first fruits
[46:42] symbolize uh the very first and best
[46:46] portion of one's income or harvest amen
[46:49] the verse yeah we we've been talking out
[46:52] there uh with brother Berry and uh
[46:55] there's so many scriptures that pertain
[46:57] to this even when we we pay our tithes
[47:01] we give our offerings it must be the
[47:03] first fruits it means the best amen uh
[47:07] uh that we receive from him and when we
[47:09] honor God he will honor Us in return
[47:12] amen and that's why we're so glad that
[47:14] uh uh we can take the scriptures we can
[47:17] take the message and it will be
[47:18] expressed through Us by by doing it then
[47:21] God will honor it amen but it doesn't
[47:24] mean I know bar can also preach and bar
[47:27] brandom preached that uh Financial
[47:30] blessing is not the the the proof that
[47:33] you are blessed right or or but but then
[47:35] the thing is it's a principle it's like
[47:39] gravity right anything that comes up
[47:42] will go down unless you're like uh
[47:44] starlink that will you know uh that will
[47:48] send the uh satellites right because
[47:52] he's defying the law of gravity but uh
[47:55] we are here if you put a ball up it will
[47:58] go down right right so it's a principle
[48:02] it's a law of nature also and spiritual
[48:05] law also that when you give you will
[48:07] receive amen and it's better to give
[48:10] than to receive right and uh we know
[48:13] eternal life is living for others yes
[48:16] but we don't want that to be ourselves
[48:19] as others it's better that we will be
[48:21] the one who will give to others rather
[48:24] than being the others that others will
[48:25] give to us right so I I'm I'm just
[48:28] saying that uh a a Christian right uh BR
[48:33] Bram is saying does a Christians need to
[48:35] work although you know uh God is coming
[48:39] right so so we know 1977 the the the the
[48:44] prediction is not a prophecy
[48:47] right it put uh it it put a lot of
[48:51] people to to bandid you can say Amen or
[48:54] or or or me mean or maybe Mischief or
[48:58] you know uh they didn't work they didn't
[49:00] send their kids to school you know
[49:03] because God is coming in 1977 because
[49:07] yeah bra Bram mentioned it but he said
[49:09] it's a prediction I predict he didn't
[49:11] say I don't prophesy it's not thus said
[49:14] the Lord amen right but then the thing
[49:15] is what what he's talking about is we
[49:19] must be prepared whatever that time is
[49:21] we need to be prepared and we cannot
[49:24] spiritualize everything as we mentioned
[49:26] last time right right how can we give if
[49:28] we don't have anything to give you can
[49:30] only give what you have right and we
[49:33] have a very good session on finance with
[49:36] bar Joel we thank the Lord for bar
[49:38] Joel's life amen and the ability to to
[49:41] uh to express or or to share his uh
[49:46] gifts gifts and talents right so we
[49:49] should uh recognize those gifts and even
[49:52] even those who are uh have the ability
[49:56] to preach behind this Pulpit we have
[49:58] yeah we we're thankful because we're
[50:00] under the five-fold ministry preaching
[50:03] the message of the hour the five-fold
[50:05] ministry amen and and and and and those
[50:08] gifts are without repentance gifts and
[50:10] callings are without repentance and
[50:12] talking about we cannot spiritualize
[50:14] everything is if you don't have money
[50:16] how can you
[50:17] give right so that's why those
[50:20] principles of
[50:21] Finance if we will have time I yeah
[50:25] they've been discussing the men's
[50:26] anything but then he didn't mention it
[50:28] so I have to research and check what
[50:30] they are which are very good I think I I
[50:33] sent some to to brother Jeff and they're
[50:37] very good principles and they're
[50:38] biblical principles but you cannot just
[50:41] limit them to five because even just
[50:44] Proverbs alone there's so many
[50:45] scriptures there that pertain to
[50:48] finance and it's one of the areas of Our
[50:52] Lives that need to be stable right amen
[50:56] one of of the main problems of a
[50:57] marriage is your finances not in in
[51:01] order it does I'm talking to myself
[51:04] because everyone is uh you know
[51:08] uh have this kind of issues somehow
[51:11] along the way but then the thing is what
[51:14] the what uh the the scripture is saying
[51:17] is honor him and he will honor us amen
[51:21] it's so good that uh you can see here
[51:23] the barns will be filled with plenty
[51:26] means uh it's
[51:28] abundance right that's uh verse 10 and
[51:32] then Joy your presence bursting with new
[51:35] Wine Joy the joy of your salvation amen
[51:39] new wine represent the stimulation of
[51:42] Revelation amen you know that uh when we
[51:45] were talking about the the the uh the
[51:48] two things that bar Bram is saying that
[51:50] you cannot uh overdo one is prayer right
[51:53] you cannot pray enough there's always
[51:56] room or there's always things that we
[51:59] need to pray for health right if if
[52:01] Finance you're already if you have a
[52:03] checklist okay or my finance is good
[52:06] okay check oh my marriage is good uh uh
[52:09] we love each other we we care for each
[52:11] other check something like that right so
[52:14] all these
[52:15] checklist it's good that uh we have to
[52:18] put them it's it's just like inventor
[52:20] ising uh having inventory on on what we
[52:23] need to do but but but the scripture is
[52:26] saying honor me and I will honor you
[52:29] amen and uh and that the second one is
[52:32] the importance of
[52:34] Revelation right you cannot
[52:36] overemphasize the importance of
[52:38] Revelation I might say a lot of
[52:41] words even bar branam has a lot of
[52:43] messages 1200 messages the scripture is
[52:46] so much with
[52:47] 66 words but if it is not revealed to
[52:51] you and me and expressed in front of us
[52:56] then we cannot understand clearly we we
[52:58] might understand what he meant it's just
[53:01] like uh an example of uh my my wife is
[53:05] explaining to me that oh the the house
[53:08] is like this the kitchen is like that
[53:10] and and the the
[53:12] the the toilet is on the right side the
[53:16] the laundry room is on the left and then
[53:18] when you come it's almost the same as
[53:20] what we have in our unit for example
[53:23] right she's explaining something in
[53:25] words and I'm trying to depict or or
[53:28] imagine what uh she's talking about but
[53:31] then the thing is all those words when I
[53:34] came to that room and then check what he
[53:37] she meant oh that's what she meant right
[53:41] you see how important Revelation is it
[53:43] means lots of words but then if it is
[53:46] expressed and you see it yourself
[53:48] experience it yourself then it's so
[53:51] clear unto
[53:52] us amen and the message of the hour for
[53:57] those who are not uh yet uh uh or or who
[54:01] doesn't know yet the the full message of
[54:03] the hour it's just like the compass
[54:08] pointing to the North
[54:10] Star right so the message of the hour is
[54:14] a compass that will point you to the
[54:15] North Star which is the word amen so we
[54:19] we have to know the positions of what
[54:21] the message of the hour is all about
[54:23] right he preached
[54:26] uh BR Bram preached so much that he
[54:29] pointed us back to the word and if it is
[54:32] in the word he said it's a warning don't
[54:35] take my word take the what the Bible
[54:37] said right and it's the same for us even
[54:40] Believers now that when you have
[54:42] something that uh you don't understand
[54:45] or it's vague go back to the source amen
[54:48] and what's that Source we have it in our
[54:51] cell phones right iPad computers
[54:54] everywhere that's why you cannot just
[54:57] rely on man's ideas or man's uh
[55:00] explanation of something because
[55:03] everything is open now amen we're
[55:05] feeding from an open book amen amen and
[55:08] we're so thankful unto the Lord that uh
[55:10] we feed on an open book revealed to us
[55:13] amen and that can only happen if we have
[55:16] the faith of God in us faith is a
[55:18] revelation right right and if it's
[55:21] revealed to
[55:22] us no one can take it away from us amen
[55:25] if God puts you in no one can take you
[55:28] out but if a person takes you in another
[55:30] person can take you out or the same
[55:32] person can take you out that's why
[55:34] following a man in this message we know
[55:37] already that it it failed amen amen and
[55:40] and God you know will will put something
[55:43] on that man a trial right right so that
[55:46] we will not look on that man we have to
[55:49] look on
[55:50] Christ brother brandham was has left the
[55:53] sin right he decreed so that Christ can
[55:56] increase it's the same for us amen and
[55:59] and we know the second coming of Christ
[56:01] is in a bride right now in this bride
[56:04] body we're waiting for the literal
[56:05] coming which is the the body change and
[56:08] it's happening right now we know but the
[56:10] culmination and when we meet him in the
[56:12] air amen amen and we'll have a marriage
[56:14] supper and then Millennium comes and
[56:17] then uh new Heaven and new earth and why
[56:20] am I talking about this because I put a
[56:23] fresh uh thing on the timeline of
[56:27] uh tights and offerings timeline wow wow
[56:31] tights and offerings has timeline I it's
[56:34] just putting things in order okay uh we
[56:37] we we read this before the first times
[56:42] the first time tithing uh appears in the
[56:44] Bible is in Genesis
[56:46] 14:20 right and blessed be the most high
[56:49] God which had delivered thine enemies
[56:52] into thy hand and he gave him tights of
[56:55] all this is Abram Abram okay Abram
[57:00] giving tis to
[57:01] melkisedek and Genesis 4:4
[57:05] to5 this the first offerings and
[57:09] Abel he also brought off the first Lings
[57:12] of his flat and of the fat thereof and
[57:15] the Lord had respect unto Abel and to
[57:19] his offering but unto Cain and to his
[57:21] offering he had not respect and Cain was
[57:25] very rot and and his countenance fell so
[57:28] offerings you see both
[57:31] children offered they have good
[57:34] intentions right right but then without
[57:37] Revelation you might be giving
[57:40] something but it's not according to the
[57:42] word amen not according to the
[57:44] Revelation and God does not have respect
[57:47] on that that's why we have to be careful
[57:49] titing and offerings are strict things
[57:53] they are in the Bible we're not
[57:55] preaching
[57:57] H legalism here right we're preaching
[58:00] the word amen and it's the
[58:03] truth and if any person that that is
[58:07] holding up something behind the pulpit
[58:10] and not preaching you the truth then
[58:11] something is wrong with that preacher
[58:14] and we are obligated to preach the truth
[58:16] whoever speaks here he's obligated to
[58:18] speak the truth truth hurts amen amen
[58:21] but where the spirit of the Lord is
[58:23] there is Liberty there is freedom the
[58:25] truth will set us free so why worry if
[58:28] it if it hurts it hurts right we've been
[58:32] talking I think ver all failures for
[58:34] example failures are not failures in
[58:38] everything that we do it's just the
[58:40] opportunity to learn more their Lessons
[58:43] Learned in anything that we do including
[58:45] our work who doesn't commit mistakes
[58:48] here amen everyone commit
[58:51] mistakes right we we're not perfect
[58:53] we're still in this flesh so that's why
[58:57] we have to put things in order according
[58:59] to the word of God amen
[59:02] amen very popular uh slide here I know
[59:07] but then the thing is uh we believe in
[59:10] the end time amen amen and the end time
[59:15] means we are
[59:17] here right and we will cross
[59:20] over after Rapture we'll have Millennium
[59:22] and then eternity I this is not the
[59:25] topic though the topic is about the
[59:27] timeline for tithes and offering or the
[59:30] t uh where they were mentioned there are
[59:32] so many scriptures but let's put them
[59:34] together
[59:36] amen the first offerings as we we
[59:43] read it's in Genesis 4
[59:47] 4-5 so this is the first offerings amen
[59:51] by by date I put them so that we can
[59:54] follow amen amen it it's 3874 BC
[59:59] approximately how did that uh come from
[1:00:03] so if you're studying timelines in the
[1:00:06] Bible you have to refer mainly the
[1:00:08] person the best person that every
[1:00:11] Theologian even BR Bram was using before
[1:00:13] is a bishop Usher he dedicated his life
[1:00:17] in all this uh timelines and uh he has
[1:00:20] this book uh yes thank you brother we
[1:00:25] have a lawyer here so very good thank
[1:00:27] you brother for the backup so
[1:00:30] good that one is so good that uh he will
[1:00:34] give you an Insight so that you know
[1:00:36] where you're living in h what time
[1:00:38] you're living in because it's so it's so
[1:00:39] good we are still carnal and we are not
[1:00:43] Jews right we're Gentiles that's why the
[1:00:46] timing for us is based on you know
[1:00:49] historical facts you know we don't need
[1:00:51] to reinvent will but but what time
[1:00:56] uh are we living in right now so that
[1:00:58] you know the exact timing according to
[1:00:59] the Lord is look at Israel right he
[1:01:02] God's time piece but we are not
[1:01:05] Israelites We Are Spiritual Seed of
[1:01:08] Abraham that's why we're called
[1:01:09] spiritual Jews but we're not physically
[1:01:12] Jews amen so yeah Bishop Asher was the
[1:01:16] one who put all most of of of this uh uh
[1:01:22] uh time or or or dates but some are
[1:01:25] assumptions
[1:01:26] because even the date or the the the
[1:01:29] time today or the year today 2024 is
[1:01:31] also an assumption right it started when
[1:01:35] when you know it's a Gregorian calendar
[1:01:38] so they started it so we continued it so
[1:01:40] we're in 2024 based on our calendar
[1:01:42] right now but for the Jews they have a
[1:01:44] different calendar the Japanese they
[1:01:46] have their own calendar right the the
[1:01:49] the Muslims they have their own calendar
[1:01:51] so which calendar are we going to to
[1:01:53] check of course this is the isites
[1:01:56] condition they are the time piece but
[1:01:58] for us we have to just continue and then
[1:02:00] put things so that we will be warned
[1:02:02] that we are really at the end time right
[1:02:05] so 3 874 BC it's around maybe around
[1:02:09] maybe 20 to 30 year old when uh when
[1:02:12] when Cain and Abel were uh at that age
[1:02:16] because they offered sacrifice so it
[1:02:17] means they might be already matured
[1:02:19] adult right young adults when they're
[1:02:21] doing their uh their tights and
[1:02:24] offerings because nowhere you can find
[1:02:26] in the Bible all these dates amen so
[1:02:29] it's an assumption but what I'm saying
[1:02:30] is
[1:02:32] offerings it's about
[1:02:34] 2,383 years before the
[1:02:37] law so because the the concept here I'm
[1:02:40] trying to prove to you that titing and
[1:02:43] offering is even before the law and
[1:02:46] everybody's thinking that tithing and
[1:02:48] offering is in the Old Testament no it's
[1:02:50] not it's even before the law amen that's
[1:02:53] why we have to put things in proper
[1:02:56] order so that oh am I giving in vain no
[1:03:00] these are principles of the Lord amen
[1:03:03] and we mentioned last time my ending
[1:03:05] last last week is it will give benefits
[1:03:09] to the third and fourth generation and
[1:03:12] for us maybe I'm the first generation
[1:03:14] that is benefiting from it but my
[1:03:17] ancestors third and fourth generation
[1:03:20] before me were doing the good things for
[1:03:23] me paying tithes and offerings to the
[1:03:25] Lord that's why I'm having I'm being
[1:03:27] blessed right now so I'm doing it paying
[1:03:30] it forward so that my third and fourth
[1:03:32] generation to come from my ancestry will
[1:03:35] have the same benefits and we are
[1:03:38] setting an examples to our children
[1:03:41] anything that we
[1:03:42] receive 10% of that is an increase
[1:03:45] because it's like a gift to us although
[1:03:48] we render Services right we are paid but
[1:03:52] then everything belongs to God we
[1:03:54] already we already know that principle
[1:03:56] that everything belongs to God and when
[1:03:59] we think of that then it's so easy for
[1:04:02] us to give or to pay because it's not
[1:04:04] ours from the beginning amen we're just
[1:04:07] returning what is his and take note it's
[1:04:10] for tights and offerings it's not only
[1:04:13] tights right so let's go so it's a
[1:04:16] timeline 200 2,000 years before the law
[1:04:20] how about the tights the first tights
[1:04:22] Abraham it's in Genesis 14:20 and that
[1:04:26] date is 1913 BC approximately and that
[1:04:29] is again 422 years before the
[1:04:33] law
[1:04:35] right
[1:04:37] amen and the Jacob's
[1:04:40] bow this is about the Jacob's Ladder
[1:04:47] before maybe we should read it and then
[1:04:49] we'll go back to the
[1:04:52] oops Genesis 28 20-22 I will uh uh so
[1:04:56] while we are there maybe if you can open
[1:04:58] your Bible so at least it's a it's a
[1:05:00] study and then preaching if if if that's
[1:05:03] good with you Genesis
[1:05:05] 28
[1:05:10] 20-22 so these are these are instances
[1:05:14] in the Bible where it's even before the
[1:05:21] law and Jacob vow The Vow 2820
[1:05:28] Genesis 28:20 okay and Jacob vowed The
[1:05:31] Vow saying if God will be with me and
[1:05:35] will keep me in this way that I go and
[1:05:38] will give me bread to eat and rment to
[1:05:41] put on so that I come again to my
[1:05:44] father's house in peace then shall the
[1:05:47] Lord be my God and this Stone which I
[1:05:50] have set for a pillar shall be with God
[1:05:53] shall be God's house and and all and of
[1:05:57] all that thou shalt give me I will
[1:06:01] surely give the tent of thee so you can
[1:06:03] see here it's Jacob uh this one is uh in
[1:06:07] Genesis 28 so you can see about Jacob's
[1:06:09] L We Know bar Bram talk about the
[1:06:11] Jacob's lad it's just that ladder is
[1:06:14] just like Jesus Christ uh mentioning
[1:06:17] that uh to connect Humanity from God and
[1:06:20] that ladder is Jesus Christ himself amen
[1:06:23] just just for that one but what uh what
[1:06:26] Jacob is saying here is uh he made a vow
[1:06:30] that he will give
[1:06:33] all the tent of all that uh that he had
[1:06:37] that he will have amen and and and
[1:06:39] that's uh even before the law amen and
[1:06:42] uh we can go back to the presentation
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:51] brother so that is 269 years before the
[1:06:55] law that is in 1760 BC and then the law
[1:06:59] came Exodus 20 which is 1491 BC right
[1:07:04] and uh in the Old Testament there are so
[1:07:07] many scriptures that are pertaining to
[1:07:10] tithes and offerings amen we'll not uh
[1:07:12] talk all of them but uh at least you
[1:07:14] will see the timeline this is before
[1:07:17] Jesus Christ came That's the Law amen
[1:07:22] and then Jesus came under grace there's
[1:07:24] so many scriptures as well about tithing
[1:07:27] and offering Matthew 23:23 look uh so
[1:07:31] many here but I have some in the
[1:07:33] presentation so we will read them this
[1:07:35] is in the New Testament after the law
[1:07:38] right so it means ties and offerings is
[1:07:41] still valid in the New Testament and how
[1:07:43] about even during the
[1:07:46] Millennium so Jes Jews Temple worship if
[1:07:50] there's a Temple worship there will be
[1:07:52] sacrifices there will be offerings and
[1:07:54] that is for the Jews but for us we will
[1:07:57] be under grace and this one is the when
[1:08:01] the temple worship will be restored bar
[1:08:03] branam is saying in 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:08:06] that will be for the Jews not for the
[1:08:07] bride because the bride will be in in
[1:08:09] the marriage supper and will be in the
[1:08:11] bridal chamber with the King we're the
[1:08:14] Queen of Heaven Again an encouragement
[1:08:16] to the Bride of Jesus Christ A1 people
[1:08:19] amen all right so and then even it will
[1:08:23] go through eternity
[1:08:25] because there will be healing of the
[1:08:27] Nations the leaves will be for the
[1:08:29] healing of the Nations we we will read
[1:08:31] some scripture uh some scriptures and
[1:08:33] and quotes after this so that we can see
[1:08:36] that the tights didn't start or or it's
[1:08:40] not it's not by law it's even before the
[1:08:44] law and will continue all throughout
[1:08:46] until eternity
[1:08:48] even right but then with us being the
[1:08:52] Gentiles we are because of the Jews uh
[1:08:56] uh not accepting Jesus Christ as their
[1:08:58] Messiah they were blinded and then all
[1:09:01] the grace came through US came to us
[1:09:03] amen it was bestowed upon us by Grace we
[1:09:06] are saved through faith not by works
[1:09:09] amen it is the gift of God it's a gift
[1:09:12] of God meaning we didn't earn it it's a
[1:09:15] gift it's an unmar Grace amen so let's
[1:09:20] uh let's read some uh we already read
[1:09:23] this uh Revelations 21 1 and 2 and he
[1:09:28] showed me showed me a pure River of
[1:09:31] Water of Life clear as Crystal
[1:09:34] proceeding out of the Throne of God and
[1:09:37] of the lamb in the midst of the street
[1:09:39] of it and on either side of the river
[1:09:42] was there the Tree of Life which bear 12
[1:09:46] manner of fruits and yielded her fruit
[1:09:48] every month and the leaves of the tree
[1:09:52] were for the healing of the Nations
[1:09:55] Nations other nations remember there
[1:09:57] will be
[1:09:58] other classes of people that will be
[1:10:01] saved outside that Holy City amen and we
[1:10:04] are in the holy city but these nations
[1:10:07] let's
[1:10:12] [Music]
[1:10:14] continue the future
[1:10:17] home the leaves will be for the healing
[1:10:20] of the Nations that is the kings that
[1:10:23] live in there bringing their honor in
[1:10:27] when they bring their honor in and Lay
[1:10:29] It Before the Throne of God just like
[1:10:32] the outside you see here I put it in
[1:10:35] Orange so at least it will be a little
[1:10:37] bit uh underscored the 11 tribes brought
[1:10:41] in just like he said right uh just like
[1:10:44] the outside the 11 tribes brought in
[1:10:46] every one of them a tent of Levi see
[1:10:50] when they bring their
[1:10:53] honor from the blessed land in that
[1:10:57] they'll reach from the Tree of Life
[1:10:59] break off a holy leaf or a tree of life
[1:11:03] LEF and they'll walk out together
[1:11:06] there's no more war everything is at
[1:11:09] peace the leaves are a memorial for the
[1:11:12] healings of the nation healing of the
[1:11:16] nation there's a meaning
[1:11:18] here it
[1:11:20] symbolizes or or the leaf symbolizes
[1:11:23] restoration and it eternal life
[1:11:26] available through Christ eternal life
[1:11:30] remember eternal life is not only for
[1:11:32] the bride we are redeemed but Salvation
[1:11:35] is General there are different classes
[1:11:37] of people we read it last Wednesday so
[1:11:41] many uh quotes in the message in the
[1:11:44] books that we are not just the ones who
[1:11:46] will be in eternity but uh the class
[1:11:50] being A1 being the bride of Christ is an
[1:11:54] election right it stands in election
[1:11:57] it's not by our uh by righteousness amen
[1:12:00] so so
[1:12:02] so it's important to understand that so
[1:12:05] the Tree of Life representing continuous
[1:12:07] spiritual sustenance and healing of all
[1:12:10] Nations amen and those nations are not
[1:12:13] the bride of Christ amen and uh we're
[1:12:16] thankful that uh for his election for
[1:12:19] his Revelation amen and and
[1:12:21] we understanding this is so important
[1:12:25] amen it it will position us teaching
[1:12:28] positions a Believer but preaching
[1:12:30] catches a sinner but we know we cannot
[1:12:33] be self-righteous we need to be
[1:12:35] righteous by the correction of the word
[1:12:38] amen amen we cannot be self-righteous
[1:12:40] thinking that we know all things
[1:12:41] remember the principle the more we know
[1:12:43] the more we realize we don't know amen
[1:12:46] and we need to be teachable and how can
[1:12:48] we be thought whatever is said check it
[1:12:51] in your Bible check it in your message
[1:12:54] don't re on somebody else you can ask
[1:12:57] those who are already 40 50 years in the
[1:13:00] message but then the thing is he he's
[1:13:01] giving you not the whole thing and is
[1:13:04] you know isolating coats then that's not
[1:13:06] the full message of the Hour the full
[1:13:08] message of the hour is Christ in us the
[1:13:10] hope of glory it means Christ the word
[1:13:13] the bride word in US
[1:13:17] amen
[1:13:18] amen so I will I'll have a lot of
[1:13:21] scriptures and quotes bear with me I
[1:13:23] hope it's it's okay with you amen amen
[1:13:26] and if it's a correction praise the Lord
[1:13:28] and if it's this these are not my words
[1:13:31] but it's the word of the Lord and the
[1:13:33] word of the Prophet
[1:13:37] amen amen Le Leviticus 27:30
[1:13:42] to35 this is about
[1:13:45] tiing uh yeah okay so we have 1 hour
[1:13:50] amen amen I'm happy amen amen there's so
[1:13:54] many here but uh you know we have a
[1:13:56] pastor here that can take it and you
[1:13:59] know for us we're just supporting the
[1:14:01] pastor amen and uh we need to pray for
[1:14:04] our pastor amen it's a it's a difficult
[1:14:06] position here to to preach the truth
[1:14:09] like what he's saying it's difficult but
[1:14:13] then the thing is the truth will set us
[1:14:15] free therefore let's just be
[1:14:17] free amen what what keeps us in bondage
[1:14:20] is not accepting the truth and not
[1:14:23] knowing the truth ignorance to the law
[1:14:25] excuses no
[1:14:26] one well I don't know what amendment in
[1:14:29] that in the US but uh you know the we
[1:14:32] have American citizens here they might
[1:14:34] know but is it Fifth I don't know amen
[1:14:37] ignorance to the law excuses no one so
[1:14:40] it means we need to be informed that's
[1:14:42] the reason we go to church so that we
[1:14:44] will be informed with the word of God
[1:14:46] preached on exhorted on uh taught on
[1:14:50] right so we we need all of this and this
[1:14:53] is the five part of the five-fold
[1:14:55] Ministry Amen to to have a teacher also
[1:14:58] to have a Teaching Ministry also amen
[1:15:00] but the pastor we know is the highest
[1:15:03] order in the church he has the Sovereign
[1:15:08] uh he has the so uh I mean church is
[1:15:10] Sovereign so it means since we have a
[1:15:13] pastor he cannot be dictated by any
[1:15:15] other Pastor right we have that's an
[1:15:20] order in the church we have deacons we
[1:15:22] have trustees treasur and musicians and
[1:15:26] all those who
[1:15:27] serve bar bar barbar can can take advice
[1:15:32] from older pastors but that doesn't mean
[1:15:35] that they are there they are his Pastor
[1:15:37] because he's the pastor here so he
[1:15:39] cannot have another pastor but the other
[1:15:41] four ministers they must have a
[1:15:44] pastor and brother brother Branham gave
[1:15:47] an example
[1:15:48] there his Pastor is who bar Neville amen
[1:15:53] he's an evangelist is the he's a prophet
[1:15:56] of this age a Vindicated Prophet there
[1:15:59] are the the other four which is Prophet
[1:16:01] they prophesy they give dream dreams and
[1:16:03] everything that's prophetic but that
[1:16:05] that's not what bar branham's uh
[1:16:08] Ministry is his his ministry is to bring
[1:16:10] the word for our day is is the seventh
[1:16:13] angel messenger so a different ministry
[1:16:16] as compared to the prophet of of of
[1:16:19] Ephesians 11 okay so the other four must
[1:16:22] have a
[1:16:23] pastor right if you're a a pastor then
[1:16:26] you cannot have another Pastor your
[1:16:28] unless you are a pastor yourself right
[1:16:31] so you must be under that Ministry
[1:16:33] because an apostle is is is not a
[1:16:36] homestead he always go establish
[1:16:39] churches and then then go back to his
[1:16:40] home church that's how it is you cannot
[1:16:43] just go forever being a missionary you
[1:16:45] must have a home Church brother brandham
[1:16:47] clearly mentioned that amen right so
[1:16:50] that are we following the message if we
[1:16:53] follow the message then let's check what
[1:16:55] the the prophet said not what the other
[1:16:58] people said right so we just need to be
[1:17:01] free and free indeed yes amen so
[1:17:05] Leviticus this is scripture so we will
[1:17:08] read it and then we'll read some uh
[1:17:11] quotes and all the ti of the land
[1:17:16] all right all whether of the seed of the
[1:17:19] land or of the fruit of the tree is the
[1:17:23] Lord's amen it is holy unto the Lord so
[1:17:26] you see it's holy unto the Lord very
[1:17:28] holy that tip of everything that we own
[1:17:31] is
[1:17:33] Holy and it is the
[1:17:37] Lord's verse
[1:17:39] 31 if a man will at all redeem all of
[1:17:43] his ties he shall add there to the fifth
[1:17:46] part thereof I have
[1:17:49] to I have to uh check the Amplified
[1:17:53] Bible the tagalo Bible what does this
[1:17:56] mean on this verse 31 and you see how
[1:17:59] strict it is if you redeem your tith if
[1:18:02] you
[1:18:03] take what is supposed to be tight you
[1:18:07] have to give 20% interest on
[1:18:10] it that's what it
[1:18:13] meant amen it's the
[1:18:17] truth check any other check any other uh
[1:18:23] uh translations
[1:18:25] yes sir read let's read it again I'm I'm
[1:18:28] just preaching what it is mentioned then
[1:18:30] you can you can interpret it the way you
[1:18:32] want it it's up to you but what it meant
[1:18:34] here is if you redeem out of your tights
[1:18:39] you shall add the fifth part thereof
[1:18:42] what you redeemed or what you took back
[1:18:44] you have to put 20% extra on it so you
[1:18:47] see how important it is but this
[1:18:49] correction don't yeah I I hope you'll
[1:18:52] still love me after I'm just reading it
[1:18:54] though okay so it means it's just so
[1:18:57] that we will be in order because
[1:19:00] Perfection means there's no floww we
[1:19:02] cannot hold back anything even in our
[1:19:04] lives right if if if it takes if we need
[1:19:07] insurance according to the law we need
[1:19:09] to buy insurance for our house pour our
[1:19:11] car we cannot just bypass the law we are
[1:19:15] under the law I mean when it comes to
[1:19:18] living here same for our finances you
[1:19:22] cannot evade your taxes brothers and
[1:19:24] sisters they will be after you right but
[1:19:26] then the thing is these are principles
[1:19:28] so it means I'm just putting
[1:19:30] this again on the 3 second and
[1:19:33] concerning the tith of the herd or of
[1:19:35] the flock even of whatsoever passeth
[1:19:38] under the rod the tent shall be holy
[1:19:42] unto the Lord so you see here we we we
[1:19:44] tried to connect because right now we're
[1:19:46] under the money uh money system right we
[1:19:50] don't we're not Farmers so we don't give
[1:19:53] all the the fruit of our lands or you
[1:19:56] know but even your farmer today you have
[1:19:58] to sell you don't give tights based on
[1:20:01] on on what you you know uh you rip right
[1:20:05] so but maybe yeah in other parts they do
[1:20:09] that because they cannot sell right away
[1:20:11] so they give some rice to the pastor I
[1:20:14] know that so uh let's say they have 100
[1:20:17] socks they will give 10 sacks to the the
[1:20:20] to to to the to the pastor basically or
[1:20:23] or basically to the church right so what
[1:20:25] they uh some are doing that but in here
[1:20:28] we always sell what we have so so for us
[1:20:31] most of us here we are workers or we are
[1:20:34] businessmen so anything that we receive
[1:20:37] we give tithes Amen in the form of money
[1:20:40] and our account will not receive crypto
[1:20:43] right so our account
[1:20:45] is our account is in Canadian dollar
[1:20:49] right even though you give me US dollar
[1:20:50] I have to convert it and when I deposit
[1:20:54] it right to the bank they will convert
[1:20:56] it to Canadian so let let's be straight
[1:20:59] on that that uh we're talking about
[1:21:01] money right ining Canadian dollar so
[1:21:05] verse 32 he said anything that passeth
[1:21:08] under the rod the tent shall be holy
[1:21:09] unto the Lord so let's go with the next
[1:21:12] one
[1:21:13] actually he meaning the Israelite
[1:21:18] okay we we we'll connect it later he
[1:21:21] shall not search whether it be good or
[1:21:24] bad
[1:21:25] neither shall he change it and if he
[1:21:28] change it at all then both
[1:21:33] it and the chains thereof shall be holy
[1:21:37] it shall not be redeemed it means for
[1:21:39] example you have uh you have a sheep so
[1:21:43] the ninth and then the 10th you found
[1:21:46] out that it's so good that it can be a a
[1:21:50] model ship and you wanted to to redeem
[1:21:53] it or take it back and you know I will
[1:21:55] keep this and then I'll give the 11 to
[1:21:57] the Lord me meaning still the 10 will be
[1:22:00] them but the scripture is saying both
[1:22:03] the 10th and the 11th will be his amen
[1:22:06] so you see how strict tithing
[1:22:10] is right so that's why we need to be
[1:22:13] careful brothers and sisters and we
[1:22:15] should know where to put our tights
[1:22:17] because it's also mentioned where you
[1:22:19] need to put your tights to amen
[1:22:21] amen and the 34 is these are are the
[1:22:24] Commandments which the Lord commanded
[1:22:27] Moses for the children of Israel in
[1:22:29] Mount Si so we're talking about the law
[1:22:31] now which is in the Old Testament here
[1:22:33] but it's still prevalent and it's still
[1:22:36] uh applicable in our age
[1:22:40] amen I know it's a bit touchy but then
[1:22:43] we have to take you know we have to read
[1:22:46] all this right so touchy but uh that's
[1:22:50] will make us free
[1:22:52] amen what would a man take tithings for
[1:22:56] so you see I know I I I read this the
[1:22:59] first time last time but I will repeat
[1:23:01] it so that we can emphasize that it's
[1:23:04] very
[1:23:05] strict he's talking about melis EDC here
[1:23:08] if he never was born and never will die
[1:23:12] and was from beginning to end and never
[1:23:15] had no father or mother or descent and
[1:23:18] own the whole heavens and earth and all
[1:23:21] in it why would he take tide this is
[1:23:24] melkis EDC why would he ask Abraham to
[1:23:28] pay tights you see what a strict thing
[1:23:30] it is to pay
[1:23:32] tights titing is right every Christian
[1:23:35] is Duty bound to pay tight that's right
[1:23:38] never has been changed this is the
[1:23:40] prophet of God saying so it means he's
[1:23:43] talking about even Levi on the next one
[1:23:45] he he
[1:23:46] paid he paid tight although it's Abraham
[1:23:49] who paid tights but it's in the third
[1:23:50] and fourth generation right so so what
[1:23:53] what what I'm trying to say here is we
[1:23:56] need to pay tights where it belong to
[1:23:59] where where it's supposed to amen and
[1:24:01] then let's read
[1:24:07] more would it be wrong to use tits on
[1:24:09] church building P
[1:24:12] funds here's a touchy little thing for
[1:24:15] the church now
[1:24:17] no correctly tights is to go to the
[1:24:20] minister amen that's right in the Bible
[1:24:23] they had a box set at the door in the
[1:24:26] Old Testament when the building this box
[1:24:29] was a fund where the people put in there
[1:24:32] for the repairing you've read it many
[1:24:34] times in the Old Testament they kept up
[1:24:36] the buildings and things like that all
[1:24:39] the repairs on the building was taken
[1:24:42] care out of that fund but a tent of that
[1:24:45] a tent of the tis all the titing went to
[1:24:49] their priests their pastors yes TI
[1:24:53] thingss are to go for nothing
[1:24:55] else amen
[1:24:58] amen let's
[1:25:03] continue I know
[1:25:05] people take their tights and give them
[1:25:07] to a widow
[1:25:08] woman that's wrong yes sir if you're got
[1:25:12] if you've got anything to give the widow
[1:25:14] woman give her but don't give her God's
[1:25:17] money yes that's not yours in the first
[1:25:20] place that's
[1:25:22] God's if you sent me downtown to get a
[1:25:26] loaf of bread and give and you give me
[1:25:29] 25 cents to get the loaf of bread and I
[1:25:32] met somebody on the street wanted it you
[1:25:35] can read it I think I think uh it's it's
[1:25:39] legible yeah we can read it right so and
[1:25:42] I met somebody on the street wanted it
[1:25:44] something something else and I'd give
[1:25:46] him the 25 cents see I give them your
[1:25:50] money if they ask me for something let
[1:25:53] them get it over here in this pocket and
[1:25:55] give them my money but this is your
[1:25:57] money and a tent of it is the Lord's and
[1:26:00] Levi the priesthood live by the tent so
[1:26:03] what he's saying is if I have this
[1:26:05] pocket here on the right side this is
[1:26:07] for Tight money and this is my money
[1:26:10] let's say this is 10 and then this is 90
[1:26:13] I cannot give this tent to any widow
[1:26:16] woman or any other person because it's
[1:26:20] God's money it's tight money I have to
[1:26:22] take it from my 90 here right right so
[1:26:25] because although everything Belongs to
[1:26:27] the Lord anyway but that principle is
[1:26:29] talking about BR Bram is any 10% of that
[1:26:32] money must go to the church where you
[1:26:36] are fellowshipping your local home
[1:26:39] church amen so that's very important BR
[1:26:42] Branham clearly mentioned that you must
[1:26:43] have a home church where you will pay
[1:26:45] your
[1:26:46] tithes even even before that if there's
[1:26:49] no message church you can go to a
[1:26:51] Pentecostal church Baptist Church
[1:26:53] whenever you go let's say you're in a in
[1:26:55] a tour or or or you're V you're you're
[1:26:58] traveling or on vacation you went to for
[1:27:01] example in Antarctica there's no church
[1:27:05] there maybe in EUR of course Europe we
[1:27:07] have so many any other continents except
[1:27:11] Antarctica I think we have already the
[1:27:13] church Africa we have a lot of churches
[1:27:15] so but before that BR Branham is saying
[1:27:18] if you if you go somewhere and you
[1:27:20] cannot find any church look for a church
[1:27:22] that preach the
[1:27:24] the Bible amen Christian church so that
[1:27:27] you can Fellowship although they might
[1:27:29] not be Believers but you can be a
[1:27:30] blessing to them too yes right but then
[1:27:33] what he's trying to tell us here because
[1:27:36] there's no message Church during the the
[1:27:40] time of bar Branham he preached to
[1:27:43] different denominational churches but
[1:27:45] now we have so many message churches
[1:27:47] that believe that believe this message
[1:27:49] of the hour so you have to look for a
[1:27:51] local church where you you you can
[1:27:54] fellowship and pay your tights to right
[1:27:57] so that that's what he meant here so it
[1:28:00] cannot
[1:28:01] go to to any anything else it's the
[1:28:05] tight money but uh there's a balance in
[1:28:07] there I'll I'll let's
[1:28:10] continue the tent is to be a tiing
[1:28:13] that's to be brought into the storehouse
[1:28:15] with the promise of God to bless
[1:28:18] it and approve he said if you don't
[1:28:21] believe it come and prove me and I see
[1:28:23] if I I won't do it see that's right the
[1:28:26] tithings goes into the church for the
[1:28:28] pastor and so forth like that to live
[1:28:32] on okay and the building funds and
[1:28:35] things like that is separate fund Alto
[1:28:38] together now that is a
[1:28:40] scriptural amen maybe let's uh I I
[1:28:44] didn't put this uh in the slides but
[1:28:47] then let's read it it's so nice uh
[1:28:50] brother uh it's so good watch man what
[1:28:53] what
[1:28:54] of the night 1958
[1:29:00] 11:30 what's night uh
[1:29:08] okay let's read it I hope it's okay amen
[1:29:12] we have time but uh this one is a it's a
[1:29:14] principle that
[1:29:16] uh okay it's a okay while he's looking
[1:29:19] for it it's 1958 uh 11:30 Watchman
[1:29:24] of the
[1:29:26] night and it's in
[1:29:29] paragraph
[1:29:31] [Music]
[1:29:33] 192 I'll wait for it yeah I
[1:29:39] think okay uh well I got its little
[1:29:46] baby paragraph 192 you can just click
[1:29:49] 192 sorry about this but uh then the
[1:29:51] thing is it's so relevant to to what
[1:29:54] we're talking about okay let's read it
[1:29:57] all together well I got this little baby
[1:30:00] hand in mine just in my fingers like
[1:30:02] that it was so little and I said Lord
[1:30:05] hear the prayer of your servant and by
[1:30:07] faith that I believe that you are I
[1:30:10] place between this demon of cancer and
[1:30:13] the baby's life the blood of Jesus
[1:30:14] Christ between the Killer and the baby
[1:30:17] the blood by faith I placed that and I
[1:30:19] couldn't say nothing
[1:30:21] else 9 193 I just turned around and
[1:30:24] started walking
[1:30:26] out the father followed me he said BR
[1:30:28] branam the Lord places upon my heart to
[1:30:31] give you some ttings okay oh I said
[1:30:34] brother don't think of that no I said I
[1:30:38] don't need money brother he said but I
[1:30:41] saved up some tithings oh a little money
[1:30:44] I forget now just exactly I believe
[1:30:47] about $50 he said the Lord Place it on
[1:30:49] my heart to give it to you I said I tell
[1:30:52] you what I'll receive it and then you
[1:30:54] turn it back and give it to little Ricky
[1:30:56] over there on his on his hospital bill
[1:30:59] cuz you're a
[1:31:01] preacher I know what it is what money
[1:31:03] means and you a missionary and I know
[1:31:05] that it takes money and you got a family
[1:31:08] and all these doctor bills place it
[1:31:11] right back on little Rick's bill so you
[1:31:14] see BR Branham accepted it right but
[1:31:17] then he returned it that's right yes so
[1:31:19] it means because he's a preacher bar
[1:31:22] branam and he lives on preaching and
[1:31:25] then it's a titing that the the person
[1:31:28] wanted to give him he accepted it right
[1:31:31] right but then he changed the meaning of
[1:31:34] that titing when he receive it because
[1:31:37] we have all our sovereignty as well we
[1:31:39] have we can do whatever what we want
[1:31:42] with our money if it's our money amen
[1:31:45] but it must go to the right person or
[1:31:48] right uh church or right location right
[1:31:53] gate GES this is a message gate there
[1:31:56] are so many gates they're saying
[1:31:57] Pentecostal Gates Baptist Gates or
[1:31:59] whatever Gates Right but this is our
[1:32:02] local home church amen so it must be our
[1:32:05] ties must be given to the local church
[1:32:07] and whatever is done after that we have
[1:32:10] to pray for the pastor for his for God's
[1:32:13] leadership we have to pray for the
[1:32:15] officers for God's leadership where that
[1:32:18] TI will be after right that's why is it
[1:32:22] bad to give a with a woman for example
[1:32:25] no it's not but then it must be given to
[1:32:27] the church first and then it will be
[1:32:30] appropriated accordingly
[1:32:32] amen right so we can but you cannot just
[1:32:35] say oh this is my tight I will give it
[1:32:38] directly no you cannot do that give it
[1:32:40] to the church God will bless it and the
[1:32:43] and and the leadership of the church
[1:32:45] will determine where it's required the
[1:32:47] deacons they have the you know the
[1:32:49] deacons uh they have a very uh good the
[1:32:54] uh position that knowing what is needed
[1:32:58] in the in in the
[1:33:00] body it's one of their uh what do you
[1:33:04] call it one of their
[1:33:06] functions the pastor doesn't even need
[1:33:08] to know that bar Bram is saying because
[1:33:10] he's dealing with spiritual things so
[1:33:13] much praying for us all of us but we
[1:33:15] have to pray for him too amen right yeah
[1:33:20] it's difficult right being a full-time
[1:33:22] pastor and so thankful we can support
[1:33:25] our pastor right but then when it's
[1:33:28] given already to the church we don't
[1:33:30] have any say on it it's God who will who
[1:33:34] who who who upon his leadership what
[1:33:37] needs to be done on that tiing it's the
[1:33:40] Lord's uh it's between the pastor's
[1:33:43] leadership and and the Lord amen and and
[1:33:46] we we we must respect that amen that's
[1:33:48] how it is so what what brother Branham
[1:33:50] is saying in this quote is you know he
[1:33:53] is re the tis but he gave it to whoever
[1:33:56] and and and there are many quotes as
[1:33:59] well when he said uh he paid also tights
[1:34:03] I think uh I might have it but uh I will
[1:34:05] I will be ahead of myself what what he
[1:34:07] he said is I paid tights he said but
[1:34:10] then I give uh I give tights to
[1:34:13] ministers as well and then the thing is
[1:34:16] he was as uh by CRA I I believe so that
[1:34:20] uh he cannot do that so he what what he
[1:34:23] did is he bypass it to missions right
[1:34:26] but but the point there is even bar
[1:34:28] Branham paid his ties even BR bar pay
[1:34:31] pays his tis right everyone is entitled
[1:34:33] because even the
[1:34:35] Levites when they receive the tis they
[1:34:37] have to give tights of tights tights of
[1:34:40] their tights that's why the tight of
[1:34:42] tights it's not common to hear
[1:34:45] it it's even against the voice of God
[1:34:48] right now because uh some are asking
[1:34:51] because uh they're saying the the tight
[1:34:53] of t of other churches they're sending
[1:34:55] it to Jeffersonville I know this is
[1:34:58] political but uh it's in in in the news
[1:35:02] but you know that's that's what they
[1:35:04] said they're feeding on there but then
[1:35:06] the thing is what I'm saying is I
[1:35:08] encourage what the prophet said we must
[1:35:11] have a local
[1:35:12] church where we can Fellowship live
[1:35:15] people that I can eat with delicious
[1:35:18] food amen good Fellowship we can
[1:35:22] exchange uh our experiences yes is
[1:35:25] important amen that's that's the
[1:35:28] encouragement from us and we believe
[1:35:30] that's what we that's why we're here we
[1:35:33] have a pastor amen we have other
[1:35:36] ministers and and uh and uh and officers
[1:35:40] amen and you can see amen let's let's
[1:35:48] continue back to the presentation
[1:35:51] brother sorry I've been hearing the
[1:35:53] there but uh so good
[1:35:57] to
[1:35:58] am
[1:36:03] okay
[1:36:20] oops okay
[1:36:23] we read that the tent is to be tiing
[1:36:26] that's to be brought into the storehouse
[1:36:27] with the promise of God to bless it the
[1:36:30] tiing goes into the church for the
[1:36:32] pastor and so forth like that to live on
[1:36:36] and numbers 18 20 20- 24 and the Lord
[1:36:39] speak to
[1:36:40] Aaron Aaron the office of the priesthood
[1:36:45] amen Thou shalt have no inheritance in
[1:36:48] their land neither shalt thou have any
[1:36:51] part among them
[1:36:54] I am thy part and thine inheritance
[1:36:57] among the children of Israel you see
[1:37:01] Ministries being in the ministry is is
[1:37:05] difficult because you rely on somebody
[1:37:07] else's uh tiing and offering but we know
[1:37:11] who's our portion it's the Lord who's
[1:37:13] our portion amen when when when when bar
[1:37:17] Branham was I think he he was checking
[1:37:20] TL Osborne's uh office right and he has
[1:37:24] all these big buildings lots of offices
[1:37:27] and everything and then uh but for bar
[1:37:30] Bram he has only one typew writer and
[1:37:32] one you know
[1:37:33] secretary then he was asking the Lord
[1:37:36] Lord you cannot uh uh you cannot entrust
[1:37:41] me with this how come I've been faithful
[1:37:44] to you and then the Lord told
[1:37:46] him I am your portion amen right so it
[1:37:50] means it's not only material blessings
[1:37:53] am but then you know BR Branham was
[1:37:55] blessed abundantly especially by Calgary
[1:37:57] you know that the house in
[1:37:59] Jeffersonville was funded by by the by
[1:38:02] the offerings from Calgary amen so you
[1:38:04] see the Malachi three principle he will
[1:38:08] bless the land he will bless Calgary
[1:38:11] because of that so you see he will bless
[1:38:14] Calgary Living World assembly for for
[1:38:16] being faithful by honoring God Amen so
[1:38:21] you see the inheritance the Levites
[1:38:23] they don't have inheritance right but
[1:38:26] there is a distinction between Levites
[1:38:28] and priests in the Old Testament but now
[1:38:30] it's different so levite Levites they're
[1:38:32] all descendants of Levi but the
[1:38:35] priest though they are Levites they're
[1:38:37] descendant of Aaron Aaron the priest
[1:38:40] Aaron was the first high priest and only
[1:38:44] the sons of Aaron can be
[1:38:47] priests okay not not other Levites so
[1:38:50] meaning if you if you translate it here
[1:38:53] in in in in this day and age we don't
[1:38:55] have priest I mean other denominations
[1:38:58] they have right like the Catholic and uh
[1:39:01] and uh Orthodox they have priests AR uh
[1:39:04] Bishops archbishops Pope right but for
[1:39:08] us we have sovereignty and we were
[1:39:10] taught that way so we don't have any
[1:39:11] priest our priest priest here is the
[1:39:14] ministry and even the Levites like who
[1:39:16] served the serve uh in in the music
[1:39:19] because the Levites were the one who who
[1:39:21] put the tent bring the tent prepare
[1:39:24] sacrifices but they are not the one who
[1:39:25] will offer the sacrifice it's the priest
[1:39:27] that will do that so that's very
[1:39:30] theological you can say very uh legal or
[1:39:34] you can say in the law before but we're
[1:39:36] not under the law amen we're under grace
[1:39:40] amen so they don't have inheritance
[1:39:42] Aaron and and and even the Levites they
[1:39:44] don't have inheritance among the
[1:39:46] children of Israel and verse 21 and
[1:39:48] behold I have given the children of Levi
[1:39:52] which are the Levites
[1:39:54] all the tent in Israel for an
[1:39:57] inheritance why for their service which
[1:40:00] they serve even the service of the
[1:40:03] Tabernacle of the congregation so you
[1:40:06] see the The Inheritance we're talking
[1:40:08] about here is they didn't have any land
[1:40:10] in the promised land because when they
[1:40:11] distributed the Levites didn't have any
[1:40:14] right so this is what it meant their
[1:40:17] inheritance is the tiing of all the
[1:40:21] Israelites amen so let's continue that I
[1:40:24] know this is that that's uh a bit uh
[1:40:27] mouthful I guess but uh it's the word so
[1:40:30] we'll but the
[1:40:32] Levites shall do the service of the
[1:40:35] Tabernacle of the
[1:40:36] congregation and they shall bear their
[1:40:40] iniquity it shall be a statute
[1:40:44] forever throughout your generation
[1:40:47] that's among the children of Israel they
[1:40:49] have no inheritance but the Tis of the
[1:40:52] children of isra
[1:40:54] which they offer as a Eve offering unto
[1:40:56] the Lord I have given to the Levites to
[1:40:59] inherit therefore I have said unto them
[1:41:02] among the children of Israel they shall
[1:41:05] have no inheritance so you see so titing
[1:41:09] is for the minister Ministry basically
[1:41:12] that preach the gospel and in the New
[1:41:15] Testament you can see here 1 Corinthians
[1:41:17] 913 and 14 do ye not know that they
[1:41:21] which minister about holy things live of
[1:41:25] the things of the
[1:41:26] temple and they which wait at the altar
[1:41:29] are partakers with the altar even so had
[1:41:32] the Lord ordained that they which preach
[1:41:35] the gospel should live of the
[1:41:38] Gospel so who preached the gospel the
[1:41:40] five-fold ministry right so it means
[1:41:43] that's why we support yes sir we support
[1:41:46] tithings on on fivefold Ministry
[1:41:48] Although our pastor is a fulltime we
[1:41:50] have although we Minister here we you
[1:41:53] you can say we have love offerings when
[1:41:55] when we preach because why because for
[1:42:01] the scripture said Thou shalt not muzzle
[1:42:03] the ox that threaded out the corn and
[1:42:07] the laborer is worthy of his
[1:42:10] reward right and if you bless a minister
[1:42:14] who preached the gospel you'll be also
[1:42:17] blessed it's
[1:42:19] a it's a principle amen amen
[1:42:26] in discernment of spirit a new testament
[1:42:29] Prophet is a preacher we all know that
[1:42:32] just any Minister that's a preacher is a
[1:42:34] prophet a new testament Prophet if he's
[1:42:36] prophesying preaching not to try to
[1:42:38] edify himself to make a big name or to
[1:42:40] edify his organization which he should
[1:42:43] be in an organization here I am without
[1:42:46] one he doesn't have any organization
[1:42:48] that's what bar Bram is saying which he
[1:42:50] should be in an organization he WR I am
[1:42:53] without one but yet preaching you should
[1:42:55] be that's right every man every
[1:42:59] man or woman man means man and woman
[1:43:04] everyone ought to have a church home
[1:43:07] that's right amen you ought to have a
[1:43:09] place not just to float about from
[1:43:12] Pillar To Post but have somewhere that
[1:43:15] you go to church and you call it your
[1:43:18] church somewhere you pay your tithes and
[1:43:21] somewhere that you help support the CA
[1:43:24] take your choice but then don't never
[1:43:26] disfellowship the other man because he
[1:43:29] don't belong with your group see discern
[1:43:31] the spirit and see if he got the same
[1:43:33] purpose in heart then you got Fellowship
[1:43:36] one with another you're working for one
[1:43:38] great cause that's the cause of Christ I
[1:43:40] think that is absolutely true you see
[1:43:43] supporting ministers that's why we have
[1:43:45] visiting ministers here right because we
[1:43:48] you know evangelists who are full-time
[1:43:50] we need to support them how how can they
[1:43:52] live that that's that's their work
[1:43:53] full-time same as for pastors who are
[1:43:56] full-time we need to support them amen
[1:43:58] that's that that's how it is mention
[1:44:01] here and you must have a home Church
[1:44:03] there's so
[1:44:04] many uh quotes about having a local
[1:44:09] church so I I won't argue with that at
[1:44:11] all amen and that's why we're here
[1:44:15] tights of tights
[1:44:16] we another touchy subject but then let's
[1:44:20] just read it I think
[1:44:23] and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:44:25] saying we have time
[1:44:29] amen thus speak unto the Levites and say
[1:44:33] unto them when ye take of the children
[1:44:35] of Israel the tithes which I have given
[1:44:39] you from them for your
[1:44:41] inheritance then ye shall offer up an
[1:44:45] heave offering of it for the Lord even a
[1:44:48] 10th part of the tight that is tight of
[1:44:51] tis right and and this your he offering
[1:44:54] shall be reckoned unto you as though it
[1:44:56] were the corn of the threshing floor and
[1:44:59] as the fullness of the wine press so you
[1:45:01] see here the tent of the tent which is
[1:45:05] tights of tights it's an eve offering
[1:45:09] but then we don't do he offering here
[1:45:12] anymore we don't raise any part of any
[1:45:16] any you know the breast of of an ox or
[1:45:19] whatever or the fruit of the land we're
[1:45:21] waving we we don't do that that's in the
[1:45:23] law but what do we have now it's money
[1:45:26] we talk about it it's Canadian dollars
[1:45:28] so tights of tights can be an hi
[1:45:32] offering so we know every time maybe
[1:45:37] maybe most of the churches you can see
[1:45:38] that the offerings that we receive in a
[1:45:40] church is not enough to take care of the
[1:45:43] building is uh building uh uh uh
[1:45:47] expenses and everything so you see the
[1:45:50] tight of tight is said it will be an hi
[1:45:52] offer
[1:45:54] offering so offering means what it can
[1:45:58] be you know the needs of the people
[1:46:02] right not only for the building but then
[1:46:04] it will be taken from the tent of the
[1:46:06] tights of what we receive that's what it
[1:46:09] meant
[1:46:10] here if I'm wrong tell me but what I'm
[1:46:13] saying is our
[1:46:16] nature right we're all faithful in tight
[1:46:20] paying paying our tights but but how
[1:46:23] about our offerings we're not that
[1:46:25] generous right but then the thing is do
[1:46:29] we want to be blessed
[1:46:30] more if the denominations are tapping on
[1:46:34] this law as I mentioned before it's a
[1:46:36] law if anything that goes up will go
[1:46:39] down law of gravity this one is law of
[1:46:41] tiing and
[1:46:42] offerings it's a spiritual law what does
[1:46:45] it mean if you give more more will be
[1:46:49] given unto you in return so I know
[1:46:53] there's a question are you going to
[1:46:54] tight for the gross or the net or
[1:46:55] whatever how much do you want to be
[1:46:57] blessed amen right it's up to you right
[1:47:01] so I mean what I'm saying here is these
[1:47:04] are
[1:47:05] principles that we really want we want
[1:47:08] to be perfect in in whatever we know if
[1:47:11] it's already told uh been told us or
[1:47:14] taught to us that this is the way it is
[1:47:17] and it's in the scripture why not follow
[1:47:18] it we we don't want any our
[1:47:23] was the one who preached we can be a
[1:47:24] denomination of our own selves right if
[1:47:27] we think that oh this is how it's
[1:47:30] supposed to be because this is how I
[1:47:32] understand it no we have a prophet in
[1:47:35] the land he mentioned it right and and
[1:47:37] even the scripture is saying that so why
[1:47:39] not follow amen right so it
[1:47:42] means our nature is we are not generous
[1:47:45] on offerings but do we want to be
[1:47:48] blessed then offer and we will go to
[1:47:51] that so that's the title of tights it
[1:47:53] can be reappropriated although it's a
[1:47:57] tight before but like what bar Bram did
[1:47:59] it's poor hospital bills let's say bar
[1:48:02] Barber it's in his heart to to give
[1:48:05] somebody because she's in need or he's
[1:48:07] in need it's up to him right whatever he
[1:48:11] wants I mean according to the leadership
[1:48:13] of the Lord but then the thing is like
[1:48:15] like the church order and Doctrine like
[1:48:18] what we said any needs in the Church of
[1:48:20] course we have to protect first the
[1:48:22] members of the church church it's in the
[1:48:24] church order Doctrine and that's the job
[1:48:26] of the deacons to check what needs are
[1:48:29] those and the pastor doesn't even need
[1:48:31] to know that it's only they will ask the
[1:48:33] treasurer bar branam is saying do we
[1:48:35] have enough money to pay those needs
[1:48:39] right so it means giving offerings
[1:48:41] praise the Lord and we're so thankful we
[1:48:44] have we are charitable org it means 50%
[1:48:47] will go back to you amen amen I I hope
[1:48:52] it's not polit IC Al wrong when they
[1:48:53] will check Calgary Living Word assembly
[1:48:56] YouTube they will say oh that's the
[1:48:57] reason why you're giving but anyway
[1:48:59] we're giving because it's the principle
[1:49:01] of the Lord O of uh of the word right it
[1:49:06] means it just gives us the ability to
[1:49:08] give more I know other churches they
[1:49:10] don't have the the charitable org
[1:49:12] because they're thinking oh it will be
[1:49:14] known no nobody knows the tis here
[1:49:16] except
[1:49:19] me right and I have a vow not to dults
[1:49:23] even to my wife right because it's a
[1:49:26] sacred thing we have to protect whether
[1:49:28] you give $1 or, thousands of dollars God
[1:49:34] is uh is uh pleased amen so let's go to
[1:49:40] the next one
[1:49:42] offerings we have time I hope you're I
[1:49:45] hope you're not bored like a university
[1:49:48] class or
[1:49:49] something amen but these are principles
[1:49:52] brothers and sisters we need to follow
[1:49:54] this if we if we really want to to obey
[1:49:57] his Commandments right we need to
[1:49:59] believe his word that's the first and
[1:50:01] then you can obey and then you will see
[1:50:03] the manifestation of what you have
[1:50:05] followed what you have obeyed you will
[1:50:07] see it's it's a it's even a a you know
[1:50:11] it's like a challenge Bram is saying
[1:50:14] prove me if I will not
[1:50:16] open heaven right for the blessings that
[1:50:20] you cannot contain blessings doesn't
[1:50:21] mean only fin IAL how about how about
[1:50:24] health how about uh you know friends how
[1:50:28] about sitting in Heavenly places with
[1:50:30] Christ Jesus
[1:50:33] Fellowship the number one cause of uh
[1:50:35] issues right now is they are alone they
[1:50:38] don't have anyone to fellowship with
[1:50:40] amen and and even the young people why
[1:50:42] do they why do they live they don't have
[1:50:45] any body that are like them that's why
[1:50:47] we thank the lord we have brother Joel
[1:50:49] who's organizing all the youth they they
[1:50:52] have fellowship with one another so that
[1:50:55] they can talk about the things of the
[1:50:57] Lord also amen and and and being in in
[1:51:00] in this flesh you're still not mortal uh
[1:51:03] we're still mortal that's why they have
[1:51:04] to think of the the things of this world
[1:51:07] also that pertains to them like Finance
[1:51:10] is a good way to to start that thing as
[1:51:12] well right we have to put things in
[1:51:14] order amen so offerings
[1:51:25] but this I say he which Seth
[1:51:28] sparingly amen shall rip also
[1:51:32] sparingly and he which Seth bountifully
[1:51:35] shall reap also bountifully you see how
[1:51:38] much do you want to be
[1:51:39] blessed right I'm not pulling money
[1:51:42] because I don't need I mean God already
[1:51:44] provided for me what I'm saying is these
[1:51:46] are principes so that we'll all be
[1:51:49] blessed every man according as he per
[1:51:52] purposed in his heart so let him give
[1:51:56] not
[1:51:57] grudgingly or of
[1:52:00] necessity for God loveth a cheerful
[1:52:03] Giver if we give and we're so cheerful
[1:52:06] God will honor it and it will be will
[1:52:08] will bless us more and God is able to
[1:52:11] make all grace abound toward
[1:52:15] you that ye always having all
[1:52:18] sufficiency in all things so everything
[1:52:20] will be sufficient when you follow all
[1:52:22] these principles May abound to every
[1:52:25] good work amen as it is
[1:52:29] written he had dispersed abroad he had
[1:52:32] given to the poor his righteousness
[1:52:34] remaineth
[1:52:36] forever now he that ministereth seed to
[1:52:39] the S both Minister bread for your food
[1:52:43] and multiply your seed sown and increase
[1:52:46] the fruits of your righteousness amen so
[1:52:50] it's an increase when you when you give
[1:52:53] right it will be a an increase amen
[1:52:56] afterwards amen because you're sowing
[1:52:58] the seeds the right seed so you saw a
[1:53:02] mustard right it was said that the fate
[1:53:05] of a mustard but it's it's a very thin I
[1:53:08] think it's brother GIF to preach that
[1:53:09] you cannot hybridize right the Mard seat
[1:53:13] it means your faith cannot be hybridized
[1:53:15] cannot be mixed with denominational
[1:53:17] thinking it must be the pure word amen
[1:53:20] and with that faith if it is not
[1:53:23] hybridized then it can grow like bigger
[1:53:26] than other trees that's what it meant
[1:53:28] amen so you see you you we have to se
[1:53:31] the right seeds amen amen Luke
[1:53:35] 6:38
[1:53:37] give and it shall be given unto you good
[1:53:42] measure pressed down shaken together and
[1:53:45] running over I know this is a song I
[1:53:47] think yeah shall men give into your
[1:53:50] bossom for with the same measure that
[1:53:53] you meet same measure amen will it shall
[1:53:57] be measured to you again so you see
[1:53:59] whatever you give it will be given back
[1:54:01] even more right that that's why it's the
[1:54:04] principle right
[1:54:07] amen 1 Corinthians 16: 1-4 this is about
[1:54:11] being generous to the needs of others if
[1:54:13] if we are blessed that's why yeah we we
[1:54:17] all gave some uh love offerings to those
[1:54:20] uh who who were in need in the
[1:54:21] Philippines for the blooding you know uh
[1:54:24] this one is a principle that now
[1:54:26] concerning the collection for the Saints
[1:54:28] right as I have given order to the
[1:54:30] churches of gal galatia even so do ye
[1:54:34] upon the first day of the week let every
[1:54:36] one of you lay by him in store as God
[1:54:39] had prospered him that there be no
[1:54:41] Gatherings when I come and when I come
[1:54:44] whomsoever you shall approve by your
[1:54:46] letters them will I send to bring your
[1:54:49] Liber liberality unto Jerusalem and if
[1:54:52] it be me that I go also they shall go
[1:54:55] with me so it means uh this this verse
[1:54:59] or or or this scripture is saying Paul
[1:55:01] is asking the the Corinthians to to have
[1:55:05] their uh you know uh offerings first day
[1:55:08] of the week then when he comes so that
[1:55:10] they don't need to gather then he will
[1:55:12] bring and then uh he will bring it to
[1:55:15] those who are in need in
[1:55:16] Jerusalem right Paul will not take this
[1:55:19] for himself he will bring it and then
[1:55:21] he's saying who shall whomever on on
[1:55:24] verse three whomsoever you shall approve
[1:55:26] by your letters them I will send to
[1:55:29] bring your liberality unto Jerusalem it
[1:55:31] means the person that is handling the
[1:55:34] money it must be trustworthy amen right
[1:55:38] it we cannot just you know send um
[1:55:42] someone that is not trustworthy right
[1:55:45] that's why you know Judas is a treasurer
[1:55:47] of of the church it's about money so
[1:55:49] it's a very delicate thing as well
[1:55:51] because money we know money is the root
[1:55:53] of all evil but it's not the money
[1:55:56] itself we need money it's the love of
[1:55:58] money that is the root of all evil if
[1:56:01] you love money and you P you you pursue
[1:56:03] money then that's evil but then we need
[1:56:06] money that's why we have to put our
[1:56:08] finances in order right it's important
[1:56:11] am
[1:56:13] amen Exodus
[1:56:17] 23:29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the
[1:56:20] first of thy right fruits
[1:56:22] and of thy Liquors the firstborn of thy
[1:56:25] son shalt thou give unto me you see we
[1:56:28] cannot delay what we give to God that's
[1:56:30] why he's asking for our first fruits the
[1:56:32] best of the best we cannot put God last
[1:56:36] amen it's a it's a challenge to us right
[1:56:40] when we receive our salary we need to
[1:56:41] give our tith some sometimes I I delay
[1:56:44] but oh Lord but I don't want to delay
[1:56:47] otherwise I have to give
[1:56:49] 20% remember that it's a principle
[1:56:53] it's a principle in the Bible imagine
[1:56:55] and where where to give the tights right
[1:56:57] so so it's so important brothers and
[1:57:00] sisters you see
[1:57:03] here I'm I'm closing maybe I'll call the
[1:57:05] musicians so at least it's good we have
[1:57:07] 10
[1:57:08] minutes
[1:57:10] uh Abraham paid tis to melkis
[1:57:14] EDC melkis EDC is in
[1:57:16] his what glorified body at that time
[1:57:19] because he he communed with Abraham
[1:57:22] so
[1:57:24] physical physical
[1:57:26] God right physical God that he communed
[1:57:30] and pay Tis of all but melis sedc is God
[1:57:34] why would he need all
[1:57:35] those you see so but then the thing is
[1:57:38] for us now in this day and age where are
[1:57:42] we going to give our tithes is for those
[1:57:44] who are ministering for the gospel of
[1:57:47] the Lord right that's why we give it to
[1:57:49] the church and it will support the
[1:57:51] ministry and and the needs of the church
[1:57:53] so it means what what does that mean
[1:57:56] we're not giving to although it's
[1:57:58] attributed to God right what we paid
[1:58:01] tithes and offerings uh on that church
[1:58:04] but then the beneficiary will be his
[1:58:06] ministers amen right the F the the
[1:58:09] ministry but the offerings of course
[1:58:11] what we needed there whatever is
[1:58:12] appropriated as an offering it can be it
[1:58:15] can be uh discussed with with the with
[1:58:19] the members of the church that's why
[1:58:21] every church has is sovereignty BR Bram
[1:58:24] is saying if you want to preach uh
[1:58:26] Jehovah's Witness
[1:58:28] Doctrine then as long as everybody voted
[1:58:31] on it then we will preach you know uh
[1:58:34] Jehovah's Witness Doctrine here that's
[1:58:36] what he saying so it means there is a
[1:58:38] sovereignty in the church but the tits
[1:58:41] belongs to the ministry and then it can
[1:58:43] be reappropriated according to the
[1:58:45] leadership of the Lord whatever uh the
[1:58:48] pastor would would be led to right and
[1:58:52] and we're so thankful unto that and
[1:58:55] uh with with all this I know the more I
[1:59:00] studied I have a lot of quotes actually
[1:59:01] but uh we'll we'll stop on that I know
[1:59:04] Barberry can take from there and uh it
[1:59:08] will be a really a blessing to us if we
[1:59:10] follow exactly what the word
[1:59:13] say and we know sometimes we are also
[1:59:16] ask because we are here in Canada we
[1:59:18] came from a church for example back home
[1:59:22] right do we need to pay also back home
[1:59:24] or
[1:59:25] here where do you
[1:59:27] feed oh oh I also stream anyway no
[1:59:31] that's not how it is right whatever you
[1:59:34] give to your church back home that's not
[1:59:37] your home church then that's an offering
[1:59:38] and it can be taken from wherever you
[1:59:41] want from your pocket right but the tent
[1:59:44] is for the church so God will bless it
[1:59:48] so you see there are different Gates
[1:59:50] there are different things there are
[1:59:52] different offerings but they need to be
[1:59:54] properly
[1:59:55] identified that's why when you send your
[1:59:58] your your donations my request is put
[2:00:02] tithes or offerings or whatever it is
[2:00:05] right because for me it's difficult to I
[2:00:09] don't have the crystal
[2:00:10] ball but but I can determine whether
[2:00:14] it's tights or offerings right so but uh
[2:00:17] it's better there's a note there when
[2:00:19] you send the E transfers just put
[2:00:22] whether tith is this much offerings this
[2:00:24] much mission is this much yeah I didn't
[2:00:26] talk about missions but then missions is
[2:00:28] apostleship that's why it's still part
[2:00:30] of the ministry but then the thing is
[2:00:32] some other churches they put separate
[2:00:34] tithes offerings missions Church funds
[2:00:37] right but then the thing is what I'm
[2:00:38] saying is we don't need to be so
[2:00:40] critical on that because the the because
[2:00:43] the the Bible is saying about tithes and
[2:00:45] offerings missions can be reappropriated
[2:00:48] you know uh uh love offerings can be
[2:00:52] appropriated giving to the needs can be
[2:00:54] appropriated and it's with the
[2:00:56] leadership that's why it's so important
[2:00:58] to pray for the leadership of the church
[2:01:01] amen it's the Holy Ghost leadership in a
[2:01:03] man we have to pray for br Berry it's
[2:01:07] difficult
[2:01:08] position he's a good worker too he can
[2:01:10] earn he can earn by working but then he
[2:01:14] dedicated his life for
[2:01:16] us what if somebody ask you okay quit
[2:01:20] and then we will give you this this much
[2:01:22] will you accept you won't right but then
[2:01:24] the thing is it's a principle and we we
[2:01:27] must be thankful brothers and sisters
[2:01:29] and but the thing is we need to be
[2:01:31] according to the word
[2:01:33] always what is mentioned let's do it by
[2:01:37] the word not
[2:01:40] legalistically right but according to
[2:01:42] Revelation faith is a revelation
[2:01:44] brothers and sisters it's so important
[2:01:49] amen I will end but but uh it's good I
[2:01:53] think the onee preparation for a 1 and a
[2:01:56] half hour preaching times two uh
[2:01:59] hopefully you learned a little bit and
[2:02:02] I'm learning too but anyway so the thing
[2:02:05] here we're brothers and sisters we love
[2:02:07] each other therefore we want to be
[2:02:09] corrected if it is if it is wrong we
[2:02:11] want to be corrected and when we're
[2:02:13] thinking how come God is Not blessing us
[2:02:15] maybe we're not doing the right thing
[2:02:18] amen but again in balance it doesn't
[2:02:21] mean that you are not a bride amen but
[2:02:24] it means the principle in this world
[2:02:25] you're not following that's why you're
[2:02:27] not
[2:02:27] blessed right and what are those bless
[2:02:30] what are those principles I have five
[2:02:33] key biblical principles here which I
[2:02:36] wanted to you know uh to to add on or
[2:02:39] build on B Joel because I I enjoyed the
[2:02:42] his presentation last Sunday but then
[2:02:44] maybe for the next time when we have
[2:02:46] time but it's important those principles
[2:02:49] are biblical oh I'll tell you brothers
[2:02:52] and sisters maybe I'll just tell you as
[2:02:54] a hint a little bit we have five minutes
[2:02:56] but
[2:02:58] uh just just for a quick one and then we
[2:03:01] can we can do it more when when time
[2:03:03] allows uh next time but uh bear with me
[2:03:07] I I'll just read them they're so
[2:03:11] nice amen number one is about
[2:03:15] stewardship of God's resources we
[2:03:18] already mentioned what every everything
[2:03:21] that we own is the Lord's right we need
[2:03:24] to be good stewards where we put them
[2:03:26] properly I have scriptures and quates
[2:03:28] even but I won't mention the next thing
[2:03:31] is generosity en titing and offerings
[2:03:33] right generosity en titing and offerings
[2:03:36] so it means you're if you're generous we
[2:03:39] we we we mention all those give and it
[2:03:41] shall be given unto you more than what
[2:03:43] you gave amen the third one you must
[2:03:48] avoid
[2:03:49] debt and not be greedy
[2:03:53] amen we know owe no man anything but to
[2:03:57] love one another and in Proverbs 22:7
[2:04:01] it's important the rich ruleth over the
[2:04:04] poor and the borrower is servant to the
[2:04:07] lender so it means as much as possible
[2:04:09] it's a good principle like brother Joel
[2:04:10] was saying last Sunday as much as
[2:04:12] possible don't owe anyone as much as
[2:04:15] possible pay your debts I mean even the
[2:04:18] banks because they pay a lot of they
[2:04:20] they ask for a lot of interest
[2:04:22] right so it's a good principle this is
[2:04:24] the third one the fourth one is working
[2:04:27] diligently and honestly it means you're
[2:04:29] working for the Lord whatever your job
[2:04:32] is you're working for the Lord no if the
[2:04:34] boss is not watching I'm working for the
[2:04:36] Lord amen that's why he will bless you
[2:04:39] abundantly with that
[2:04:40] amen and the people one is trusting God
[2:04:43] for provision when you give you know
[2:04:46] that God will bless what you gave and
[2:04:48] even the rest of it imagine he's just
[2:04:50] asking 10 of of of offering it it didn't
[2:04:54] say how much what percentage but other
[2:04:56] churches they say might be five it might
[2:04:58] be more but you can give more whatever
[2:04:59] is in Your Heart A Cheerful Giver
[2:05:02] remember the story about the the the the
[2:05:05] woman that gave everything that he had
[2:05:07] she had two mites or three
[2:05:10] mites right but the others are just
[2:05:12] giving some of their extras but God is
[2:05:15] pleased more pleased than that woman who
[2:05:18] gave everything that she owned amen
[2:05:23] so maybe maybe can we sing worship I
[2:05:27] thought brother uh sister Ellen will
[2:05:29] sing it but uh let's sing
[2:05:33] worship and I'll ask BR to come after

[2:09:20] Abraham I am thy shield and thy
[2:09:23] exceeding great reward you see it's an
[2:09:28] expression or it's the result of of his
[2:09:31] faithfulness in giving his

[2:11:16] tremendous to hear the the burden that
[2:11:19] the Lord has put on brother mvin heart
[2:11:22] and I personally believe that uh there's
[2:11:25] a part three on the
[2:11:28] horizon and you know if we were to wait
[2:11:30] I was thinking about it when brother
[2:11:31] mvin goes to
[2:11:33] Philippines and comes back again it will
[2:11:35] actually be another year so he's got
[2:11:37] some time to prepare he could have
[2:11:39] another year in January we could see
[2:11:41] that part three Lord willing certainly
[2:11:44] love and appreciate brother murphin and
[2:11:46] The Panetta family and all they stand
[2:11:48] for all they offer to the body and each
[2:11:52] one I I just have an overwhelming desire
[2:11:55] to say this morning I thank you from the
[2:11:58] most inner part of our being for the
[2:12:01] support of the church to be in this
[2:12:03] position it is not easy as brother mvin
[2:12:06] said but he is our great reward he is
[2:12:10] our shield and it's wonderful to see
[2:12:13] what happens when we just preach the
[2:12:15] word and not try and put our own spin on
[2:12:17] it and listen to anybody else no other
[2:12:20] human just allow the Holy Spirit to lead
[2:12:23] and people's lives change we see the
[2:12:26] Holy Ghost move in our midst we see
[2:12:28] healing we see salvation we see young
[2:12:31] people Desiring to get baptized and
[2:12:33] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:12:35] to me that's what it's all about
[2:12:37] brothers and sisters to see success in
[2:12:39] marriages to we could go on and on thank
[2:12:43] you for your support for me and my
[2:12:45] family for the ministry here for each
[2:12:47] and every one it takes a body of belever
[2:12:51] Believers to see growth and we know
[2:12:54] that's all that God is looking for is
[2:12:55] spiritual growth in each and every one
[2:12:57] of our lives and I can tell you I am
[2:12:59] growing I have grown and I fully intend
[2:13:02] to grow we need to continue growing and
[2:13:04] one of these days we will see a body
[2:13:07] change it's never been closer brothers
[2:13:08] and sisters it's not time to get weary
[2:13:11] and well-doing push aside all of the
[2:13:13] thoughts of the devil and if you want to
[2:13:15] know if it's a thought of the devil or a
[2:13:17] thought of the Lord if it's negative
[2:13:19] it's the devil period
[2:13:21] anything negative is going to be of the
[2:13:24] devil that's all we need to remember God
