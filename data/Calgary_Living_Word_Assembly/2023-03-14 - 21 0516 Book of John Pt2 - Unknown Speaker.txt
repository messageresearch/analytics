TRANSCRIPT
========================================
long as we are completely behind the word he has no power he has no Authority he has no rights they were all stripped from him at Calvary that was the actual physical manifestation of the scripture that that lamb was slain from before the foundation of the world the only thing that Satan is doing is exactly what God wants him to do brothers and sisters he's not doing one thing outside of the plan of God God doesn't do things to us he allows Satan to do things to us to perfect us that's all my goodness apologize for the technical difficulties you know I just look at this and I laugh if there's anybody frustrated this morning over it just relax just rejoice don't get upset and don't get flustered by it which is what the natural carnal tendency is is to get upset and frustrated by it but you know what if it wasn't actually having problems then we wouldn't have Satan coming against us this isn't God's will for us to struggle and and and and and and strive like this and get upset Satan doesn't want us to Rejoice he wants to try and interrupt the program we're experiencing here so we have the ability to rejoice in the midst of this trial and just do exactly contrary to what Satan wants us to do Satan wants us to get upset and say what are those guys doing and what aren't those guys doing and shouldn't or couldn't or wouldn't forget about all that just Rejoice anyways Just Praise the Lord Make a Joyful Noise right in the face of Satan say it doesn't matter what happens man I'm gonna Rejoice I don't care what anybody else does I'm going to shout because he has done something for me I just believe it with all my heart maybe I'm crazy but you know what when when you have truly got that experience in your life there ain't nothing that's going to stop you from praising God nothing will stop you brothers and sisters we're our brother prayed it earlier things have changed around here things have changed around the message if you talk to people who ministered the gospel of the message I I figured it out I came in around 2005. I'm still a message babe but there's people that were around in 1965. still alive today who actually heard the message of the hour what's being preached today isn't what was being preached then there's a revelation that has further un unveiled itself to us in our day just like covet coming around and shutting down all of our program and changing everyone's life everyone's life this isn't a spiritual persecution this is everyone persecution just like covet coming around like this brothers and sisters one day it's just going to be the secret silent going away of the church and you know those people that really get mad and complain and Grumble and murmur like we've talked about they'll be grumbling and murmuring because the sound isn't turned on because the streaming hasn't started because this because that you know the church will be gone we need to make sure we know where we stand brothers and sisters I'm not here to judge or condemn I want to encourage but I just want to encourage on the right things don't get caught up in all the stuff the devil wants you to get caught up in just move beyond that we're we're Beyond getting upset over over trivial things aren't we God bless you this morning welcome to the house of the Lord I'm truly sorry I don't mean to get upset I just think about it I know that it is frustrating when it seems like we continually have problems with this streaming and and everything but it's all being worked out we're all working on it we're trying we're on the same team we're working for the same thing serving the king we just want to see everyone get encouraged by the word there's so many things I'll just mention this since we started really trying to stream and making it a a Mainstay in in our lives here when covet hit for over a year we have been turning over every single Stone to try and get it to work here and and what we've encountered the the last and sort of final straw is that Shepherd Community being on the outside of the city it just doesn't have good internet service that's all and and as as good as they make it sound it's very unstable and you know that's the biggest problem that we've encountered with the streaming is that it's the internet service but let's just pray that supernaturally God will undertake for us and and just allow this internet to actually work because there's nothing that's too great for him maybe if we have the desire to get upset and and Grumble because it's not working maybe let's just take that and turn it around and just Rejoice that God has given us a problem that we can actually ask him to come around and fix is a good father for us because you know what brothers and sisters even when the whole entire land was dark in Goshen what was the story it was light in the evening time wasn't it there were some houses that had light in them even when it was so dark and so black they could feel that Darkness the whole Shepherd Community the whole city of Calgary could be out but there could be power and internet here in this building if we really want it let's just trust the Lord that way brothers and sisters this morning we just have a few prayer requests we'd like to remember before the church with a Jerry carpenter has asked for prayer from his examination the doctor said they found something and they would like him to come back and have a conversation he's asked that we would remember him and hold him before the throne in prayer brother Philippe chaganda has gone through a surgery this week he was at the Children's hospital and he's at home resting now we just trust the Lord will heal his body now I'd like to remember brother Paul in Lethbridge brother johannan in Lethbridge and brother Gabriel in Lethbridge and his family brother Gabriel and his family they wanted to come today to be in communion service tonight something in the in the heart of a child of God that just wants to be in service when they know the doors are open if anybody else has a prayer request let's just make it known to him this morning with an uplifted hand as we go to him in prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we would just like to bring these requests before your throne of mercy and Grace we know that before they were even consciously acknowledged or recognized that you already had a solution for every one of the requests Lord Jesus we just like to remember brother Philip we pray that you would touch his body that you would just restore him back to his full strength Lord Jesus and that your will would be accomplished in his life Lord we just thank you for the testimony of his life Lord and and his family parents that want to raise their children in the fear and the admonition of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the message of the hour father we pray that you would just bless their home this morning Lord we pray for the Saints in Lethbridge brother Johanna brother Gabriel Brother Paul father we pray that you would just unite them together in in in in one spirit in one Accord father even though they couldn't come today to be a part of the communion service the desire was there in their hearts father Lord we pray that you would just meet their needs according to your grace and your mercy we know that you know the needs individually father and we just want to uphold them before you throw them this morning father brother Jerry Carpenter specifically asked for prayer we pray that you would just meet the need in his heart Lord father we just ask that Lord as we go forwards that we wouldn't go by fear but that we would go by faith Lord God that when we would start to see the winds come up and the storms arise that we would just begin to sing this song only believe and that it wouldn't just be only believed that it would be now that I do believe and that we would be able to say now I do receive and that we would be able to say that Jesus is here Lord that we don't look for you in some other place in some other time and puts you off in some other traditional form or teaching but Lord that we make you our personal present tense great I am in every situation that we go through father every single other prayer request Lord that was made known unto you this morning with an uplifted hat father every other need Lord Jesus in the hearts of your children we pray that you would just meet it father sovereignly in their lives Lord we just love you and we thank you for the soul very many testimonies of your grace in our lives Lord how wonderful you are we just asked now that you would bless our service again father as we go forwards we pray that your will be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen hallelujah thank you musicians this morning if you have your Bibles if we could turn to The Gospel According to Saint John chapter 1 in case you haven't guessed it I feel the Lord is just leading me through the Gospel according to John and uh this word is so rich it's just like brother Bradham tells the story about being out hunting and having his little canvas tent there and a bucket of molasses in one of the stories and a bucket of honey in one of the other stories referring to the same story and how the bear with her Cubs one of the Cubs got into the bucket and uh and he said when the Bears finally ran away when he came back to his tent the one Cub was so covered in the Molasses or the honey that the other ones were just licking them off trying to get it all off they're all just enjoying that little Jubilee that sweet Savor that they found and you know what's like that when we get into the word of God and and the message of the hour and that's what brother Bradham was relating to in that story and it's just like that when we read the word we'll just start with uh chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not remember Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever every day in our lives that we live and we interact in this world that verse right there verse 5. comes to life and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehends it not people understand and have no clue don't have any understanding about why we are the way we are there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him have you received him today but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's just bow unto him once again Heavenly Father the only begotten of the Father the Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord how we just love you this morning how we love you every moment of Our Lives father we pray that you would just sovereignly come here and just divide this word to us Lord father we pray that I could just get out of the way and that you would just have the preeminence that you desire father that you would feed your children today Lord God that we could just rise above all of the carnality in this world Lord Jesus that we could cast down every imagination that would exalt itself against your word today and Lord Jesus most of all that you would give us ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church today father we pray that you would just bless this word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated I just feel like there's so much in here to to talk about it's taken a long time and I'm sure you've probably seen it to actually get to uh verse 14. but like I said there's so much in here and and I believe I could still go back to verse 12 and say as many as received him to them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them which believe on his name not on the titles not in the father not of the son not of the Holy Ghost not not putting into some different context not some doctrine of a devil because we know the trinitarian gospel is of hell it is not a religious thing or or maybe it is a religious thing maybe it's a fig leaf right out of the Book of Genesis but you know I don't want to talk about that today what I want to talk about is verse 14 and how so many times brother Branham and and many other people in this world they say verse 1 and verse 14 together like a sandwich and that's really the way I would like to talk about it today as as we go forwards because many times we hear in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and that's what we hear and and if we don't know many people do I know this but sometimes I feel like maybe people don't know they're not aware of this those are two separate verses and they're only partial uh the the first verse is the entire verse verse 1 of chapter one but verse 14 is only half of the verse it's only a portion of verse 14. but brothers and sisters if you think about it in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh the word was with God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God how many verses are there there's like 12 verses between verse 1 and verse 14. there is a lot of action going on there if you really step back and look at it so I just wanted to throw this out there as an encouragement when we listen to the message of the hour when we hear somebody say in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that is a powerful statement because really you can't have those two verses without having everything else in between it's big it's not little it's not just taking a portion of the two we know that we have to take the entire word all of it so I just believe it's really powerful to look at every single part of it there's so many things in here about this is John the Baptist this is the account of John the Baptist and John the Baptist is a type of William Mary and Bradham and how John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ William Branham was sent to four on the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light amen and you know there's spirits today that still want to try and say that William Branham was that light and what a terrible thing and we talked about it a while ago but I'm just going to dwell on it for a second here just just hit on it a little bit and that is that even when that Spirit would rise up around the message of the hour before the seals would be open God had to correct that that spirit that that Antichrist spirit that would try and creep its way into the church and cause it to be lukewarm formal and Powerless he couldn't open the seals if people were going to make him Christ Branham and there's people that will look at it today and say well oh you follow William Branham you worship Him you follow a man no we don't follow a man we follow Christ because that man pointed to Christ what he did was he actually expounded upon the word as he was instructed to do and if anybody has the seed Gene of God in them I I've said this a few times recently to people if you believe in Jesus Christ with all your heart and that you have eternal life if you believe if you take a look at this message of the hour for real if you really examine it you won't be able to deny it but if you hold on to a former traditional teaching and say wow that's just as far as I can go I can't allow further Revelation to be given to me there you sit there you will be you won't be able to go further you won't see what the message of the hour actually is the revealing of Christ not just the masterpiece sometimes I just get off on a tangent and I just say forgive me there's a lot between those two verses we'll talk about that in a little bit I just have a few announcements there's a communion service tonight I just wanted to remind everyone that there's a calendar that's sent out every single month I heard that there was some confusion on whether there was a service tonight maybe it's a covid question I don't know but there's a calendar that's sent out and uh it's on the calendar that we're doing communion if you have troubles receiving the calendar maybe just reach out to one of the deacons or someone around you and we can certainly make sure that you are included in the email it shows what's happening in in the month in the church um so yeah look for the calendar we will be away at the end of this month the last week of the month um and uh we're just certainly thankful that brother Phil has agreed to take the service on the 26th which is a Wednesday and brother Mervin has agreed to take the service on the 30th so we just say pray for our brothers trust the Lord will bless you mightily through our brothers and that he has put something on their hearts that's just burning to come out so we uh we're certainly thankful um we in case anybody that's wondering we're going to fellowship with the stewards for the John Sister Sarah Steward and their son brother John Steward and for the John Steward for those people who are maybe unfamiliar but the John Stewart is the one John Jr is the one who actually donated a kidney to brother Jeremy this year and that was after his wedding so we're going to go and see them they've been inviting me to go and fellowship with them for many years and every year in June there's something special that happens with fish and uh it's going to be a fishing experience so I'm absolutely thrilled to be able to just go there this year and and do that so we just uh pray for traveling mercies we're going to be traveling I believe it's 14 hours 14 hours one way to get there and uh we'll just see what the Lord has in store we'll be taking our camper and it'll be a wonderful time of Fellowship I'm sure because we're going with Believers we're not going to mix in the world we're not going to a place where we can be unbelievers we're not looking to get a way to be different people we're looking to go fellowship and do uh you know what believers do that's just Fellowship around the word with a little bit of fishing of course so that's where we're going at the end of the month we'll be gone for about a week and we'll be back for service I guess uh the beginning of June it'll be the first Wednesday service Lord willing um I just would like to throw something out there as well uh moving on from the announcements remember communion service tonight at 6 pm I'll just throw this out there sorry we'll do it the same format we did last time we'll have two Deacon staging people just come park in the parking lot we'll make sure that we are connected via the Internet we've got the wi-fi system hopefully it works if not maybe you can stream um yeah we'll just have a comedian service tonight it won't be a big long service we'll just have a little exhortation and then you know do the the bread and the wine just so everyone can come together come to the communion table um I just would like to offer a bit of a correction as well on Wednesday I mentioned something I referred to a speech that Benjamin Netanyahu had had put forth and uh it truly it's a little embarrassing even for me to say this but I'm going to because it's the position that I'm in I'm not going to try and have too much pride to actually stand behind something that is wrong and what I said on Wednesday night was an error Benjamin Netanyahu had never said those words which is alarming for me I have to look at myself in the mirror and and hear people tell me did you realize that was actually a hoax and I'll just read sort of what I found I did a little research afterwards um it's just there on the internet it says the text of this speech is being newly shared on social media because of the conflict that's happening in Israel right now currently it's it's currently being shared on social media but it first appeared online in 2014. when someone named shawl B the owner of a blogspot called free thought posted it with the final line that's been omitted in the Facebook post that's going around now and the last line says and then I awoke and it was all a dream on May the 13th 2021 he wrote a new blog post titled I created a monster that addresses how this made-up speech started to spread without context I wrote a work of viral fake news completely unintentionally he said I wasn't specifically intending for my openly fictional prose to get copy pasted and circulated as if it were real it seems that every time Israel goes into yet another round of fighting with Hamas my monster seemingly of its own volition creaks open the top of its coffin lurches out into cyberspace and storms around the world now in multiple languages you know brothers and sisters I never want to be guilty of speaking anything false from here and that's the truth um and I'll never be too proud to say hey if I have made a mistake I say forgive me please forgive me I never want to present anything false ever and uh and that was false and you know really I I searched my heart and I said why would I be so interested in that and and I know why it's because brother Branham said if you want to see what time it is in the world stage just look at Israel Israel is God's timepiece and to hear something like that the the powerful context of that speech if you look it up I'm not going to quote it now but to think that there's coming a time where Israel will do what happened in The Six Day War there was a Six Day War it is history that everyone in the world knows some people might claim to not want to actually uh quote it or remember it but that's the latest story of God actually moving on the scene for Israel and you know what I'm getting at is I believe there's something in the heart of a True Believer that wants to see a great move of God in Israel but brothers and sisters we we don't necessarily want to be here to see that do we whether we're here or whether we're not is irrelevant it's not going to put us in a position where we believe any more or any less and if it does we need to just step back and remember that it's not for us Israel is is a totally separate thing the Gentile church is completely different and and the days of the Gentile church are just coming to an end just now don't don't look for a sign don't look for a wonder I just believe for myself the reason for it um right or wrong is that I just desire to see the move of God in the world in in in in the age that we live and we know that if Israel gets into a war that they won't be in war without God that he will be right there with them so long as they're in the promised land their enemy has problems so anyways forgive me I definitely don't ever want to mislead anyone today I would like to talk about our Our Gospel According to Saint John out of chapter one in the beginning was the word and the Word was made the Word was God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and really the ultimate direction that I want to go with that brothers and sisters is that through the message of the hour through the prophet in our day through 1963 the cloud the opening of the seals Revelations 10 verse 7. Luke 17 30 all of the verses that apply to us in our day here we are once again Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us but it wasn't through William Mary and Branham he said in his life just like John the Baptist said brother Branham said it this way that if he's laying the foundation for something to come there won't be two of us here on Earth at the same time John the Baptist he said I must decrease so that he can increase so here we are brothers and sisters and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so where's that word today the word made flesh dwelling Among Us it's not a great mystery even though it is for many people the millions and billions of people who impersonate Christianity because Christianity is to be christ-like it's not to say that I'm a part of something and and I can go out and drink and I can go out and smoke and I can go out and feed my soul with rock and roll and I can go feed my soul with all of the worldly attractions that are out there whether it's sports or movies or entertainment all of the things in this world they don't satisfy Christ the only thing that satisfies Christ brothers and sisters is this here right here that's the only thing that satisfies Christ maybe to listen to the message maybe to have people Fellowship around the world we know there's a book of remembrance written about those people who speak about him who talk about the Lord Jesus Christ but you know we live in a world that we have to contend with all of these other things and sometimes we find ourselves in situations where we know that it's not pleasing to the father but that doesn't mean it doesn't mean that we're unbelievers if we have something in us that checks us then we just need to ask him to forgive us and move on many times we live our lives in a situation that can that can that can put us in a in a place where Satan will come around and try and make us feel like we're not Believers but remember I use that word feel he can't change the fact if we have met the requirements that we are believers because as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God period even though it says a comma here even to them that believe on his name if you believe on his name brothers and sisters the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost is what all of the impersonators are going after right the Believers say the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's it's amazing because it's really that simple that's that's that's the two Vines growing together that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible the name that believe on his name not names name the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism one of the most contentious things that there is for people to have so much pride to say well that's the way that I've been baptized that's the way that we were taught that's the way my my dad was that's the way my grandpa was and my great grandpa we're all baptized in titles in the Methodist Church or in the Baptist Church or in the Pentecostal church or whatever Church That Ain't Gonna Save You That Ain't Gonna Save Us you know in Jesus day John the Baptist was doing something pretty fanatical and it was outside of all of the religious folks of the day and and they said he's a crazy man he's a wild man look at him dressed he doesn't dress like us in clergy clothes he doesn't speak eloquently he calls us serpents he he says that he's the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord what's he talking about and here he is quoting the scripture that they claim to know just like the same thing when they were hanging Jesus on the cross when they had him on the cross they were in the temple singing the songs that David wrote the Psalms my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me my feet in my hands have they pierced my bones they stare at me singing those songs in the temple the most religious people of the day not realizing the one that song was about was right outside there dying a slow most painful death ever known to man the most shameful death but that was for a purpose but right before their very eyes and they didn't see it hidden in plain sight brothers and sisters do you think that it's going to be any different today is the same yesterday today and forever going to be any different than he was when he came then the most religious of the day you know brother Bradham preaches that there there in the most religious place they the most religious people crucified him the lamb the one the only begotten of the father for us out of Christ is the mystery 1963. so all things was made by him and since he was made all things made for all of us all things was made for by him then since that is true we should make our identification should be with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has identified himself with us brother Branham says this in this message that he is the principal theme of the entire Bible and that if we can't see Jesus Christ in every single scripture every single line then we need to go back right to the beginning and start over again until we do but he's the principal theme of The Bible and he says this also that he should be the Principal theme of Our Lives we should be identified with him how by living for him not just a confession so many people take a confession and say I say it's got you this place now are you a Christian brother Brown I'm asking that question are you a Christian someone says I'm a Methodist well that's a long way from being making yourself known as a Christian now look what the Methodist does I'm a Baptist look what the Baptist does I'm a Catholic look what they do see I'll throw this out there I'm a message believer what do you do brother Brown if we were to just take it into context here and put it in here I'm just saying it for an illustration an illustrative purpose have someone say I'm a message believer what do they do what do they do are they at the doors every time the doors are open we just can't wait to get to church just want to be a part of Fellowship just not interested in what anybody says if they hear something nasty that someone said something somebody just can't help it but take a shot at somebody else's character and and to hear it and be able to say wow you know I think they must not have meant that when someone would have the opportunity to take a shot because they're right they know they're right both parties know they're right and they take that shot because they're right in their own self-righteousness what does the other person do the message believer you know what brother Branham says when we're truly dead to ourselves we're a dead man kick a dead man what do they do they don't even move uh but one spot brother Bradham says you know what they'll do they'll actually just run away and quietly go pray for that person and just ask that the Lord would bless them and just just grant unto them all that they desire not actually go into the carnal Realms and say oh you did this to me you you you no good person no what does the believer what does the message believer do he says but the only way that you can actually be a Christian is for Christ to identify himself in you for Christ to identify himself in you this is the prophet speaking here how we got a stinger there and he says I hope everybody on the tape gets that too so brothers and sisters this really just stood out for me this is for us anybody that would listen to the tape this is a quote directly from the tape Christ The Mystery of God revealed 1963 after the seals have been opened everybody on the tape gets that too I say Lord help me should everybody get their masks maybe we've got someone here coming to check us we're just knocking at the door here that's what brother Peter's doing on Wednesday we had a service with brother Gilbert it was wonderful certainly enjoyed it I trust that everyone was a part of it on Wednesday I know some people were working but the Gilbert took the service and he took a scripture out of John chapter 20. verse 21 then Jesus said unto them talking to his disciples Jesus said unto them peace be unto you as my father hath sent me so send I you brothers and sisters I believe that applies to us today if we've been able to receive him he's given us power to become the sons of God we have the ability to be sent to shine that light into a darkness that comprehendeth it not but it doesn't matter whether they comprehend it or not we just keep shining forth because the voice has gone forward for the foolish virgins and the wise virgins to rise and trim your lamps because all of them were slumbering those ten virgins remember they were all slumbering the voice has gone forth the shout the voice and the Trump has already happened and here we are brothers and sisters as that voice shining forth our voice into this age of Darkness then Jesus said to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost imagine that and we know that they didn't receive the holy ghost at that moment they received it in the book of Acts it was a later thing but he prophesied he breathed upon them brothers and sisters I believe that we just need the Lord to breathe upon us today and we know that he has but just receive it just receive it receive ye the Holy Ghost I trust that was someone that's interested in coming to service God bless you brother Peter and when they had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters this is a prophecy for believers for the disciples for us today if you don't know that you have the Holy Ghost just think about it he breathed on you today when you hear the word of God being preached he breathed on you today when you listen to the word of God and the message of the hour he is breathing on you and you have given the ability to receive the Holy Ghost we have got to receive the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters it always goes back to that always in our age until the day we get out of here we have to keep preaching keep harping keep hammering on the Holy Ghost keep hitting on it over and over and over again the token is the only way that we will see the rapture if we don't get that token in our lives if we don't receive the fact that he breathed the word of God if he didn't breathe on us then we're not going to receive the Holy Ghost we're not going to be there in the Rapture we'll be some of the ones maybe wondering what wasn't wasn't something supposed to happen wasn't wasn't the Sound System supposed to get better or something before the Rapture happened brothers and sisters it might never get better I just want to say that we might never get past covid before the Rapture happens we might never have a better sound system before the Rapture happens we might never have better preaching before the Rapture happens we've already had the best preaching that we could ever have a Vindicated Prophet come and actually open the word to us to give us the word that we need to receive the Holy Ghost in our lives and the only thing that we've got to say about it is just get the Holy Ghost that that Prophet spoke about that's the only thing that's going to do it for us when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained sounds like practice for that Throne that we get to sit in hey there's coming a day where we're going to be sitting in the throne he that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne and we know that's not just a comfy place to sit it's not just the best place ever to sit even though it probably is the most comfortable place at the white Throne judgment to sit because everyone else is going to be sweating bullets everyone else is going to be saying oh my I sure hope there's something left for me because my soul is dangling over hell because every single person ahead of me whose name is not found written in the Lamb's Book of Life or somebody doesn't have something good to say about them they're dropped into the Lake of Fire right before everyone and I've got maybe a hundred thousand people ahead of me that's not very many goodness sakes will I grant to sit with me in my Throne brothers and sisters whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted if we could think about that think of the power of that think that we will be judging angels we have the ability to see people go to heaven we have the ability to impart eternal life unto people on this Earth if we think about what the prophet said he wants to take as many people with him as he can every single person that we interact with every single time that we come up to someone in the world we've got an opportunity to shine that light into their lives to shine the light that that John spoke about John the Baptist here that he he was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of that light brothers and sisters the prophet came and he was given that light he was given that life he was given the open word for a purpose now he's taken that word and he's given it to the people who will actually believe on his name not the prophet's name who will believe on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but those are the ones who are actually bearing witness of that light now today it's not just a a message from John the Baptist it's not just a message from Saint John the Divine it's not just a message from Paul it's not just a message from William Miriam Branham all of those were for a purpose so that there could be a culmination of all the ages in you in me whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them how many people wants to see people's sins retained unto them after you hear the prophet of God give an explanation of what it go what what it's like to go into the into the regions of the Lost he called it and he said that you wouldn't wish that on your worst enemy think about that what it would be like to be there and and realize that there's this conveyor belt and you can't get off it and it's coming towards the white throne and unless someone has a good word for you you're going to be thrown into that Lake of Fire because you know for sure that you did not receive the word for your day that you didn't have the token that you didn't remit sins for other people so why should anybody remit a sin for you how alarming it must be for those people in that moment you just can't even imagine the fear that must be on them I'm not trying to preach fear I'm trying to preach Joy I'm trying to preach encouragement because we have the ability based on this scripture to save people from that brothers and sisters that's where I'm going with this we have been able to receive him we've been able to receive him he's given us power to be the sons of God the ones that can remit sins for other people we don't want to attain sins I thought that was so good on Wednesday brother Gilbert receive ye the Holy Ghost he's breathed on you and if you haven't heard him breathe on you if you haven't felt him breathe on you just just pray and ask him to breathe on you and just press play on a message and see if he won't breathe on you just pick up the Bible and read it as a new book understanding that the seals are open not just six of them but all seven of them are open and just see if he won't breathe upon you and actually cause something to change in your life just accept him receive the Holy Ghost you know brothers and sisters that's what brother Gilbert was talking about and where we're going with this today Lord willing that you know once we receive him once we understand that he's breathed upon us once we understand that we have that ability to remit sin in other people's lives not just ours but other people's lives that's powerful that's really powerful once we get that though in our lives then you know what we can speak the word with authority brothers and sisters we don't have to tolerate the stuff the devil will try and hang on us we don't Satan wants us to believe that there's some sort of a ransom that that he can hold us for that that that we did something that nobody else can ever know about and and because of that thing because of that secret that's there that lies there in our lives that we just haven't quite attained to that place that we want to get to but you know what brothers and sisters that's a lie of the devil if you have met the requirements that God has set out for you today then you have met the requirements for all time it's not going to be some some day that I'm going to get there brothers and sisters right now if he is the present tense I am it's right now make it today just start speaking it speak the word have a positive confession say I know that I'm a Son of God do you know why because I believe on his name because I receive him how do we receive him receive a prophet today receive someone who is willing to speak the word I had a situation uh last Sunday we we wind up bringing two vehicles into the city because I come early to church and uh so the long and the short of it is I left my truck and and I jumped in with Lisa and we went to a couple of Mother's Day things last Sunday and we went and saw Lisa's parents and then we went and saw my mother and after it all it was about 4 30 5 o'clock we were on the road well outside of Calgary almost to Okotoks and I said oh shoot I I forgot that I left my truck in Calgary and we said ah we'll just go get it tomorrow let's just go home we were weary after all of the day's events and so in the morning again I leave early I I got up and I just called an Uber I just left the family I didn't want to upset everyone it was the first day of homeschooling again and all this new stuff going on I just left it alone so I I took an Uber and as I'm in this van I knew something was different about this man right away and uh and as we are going I see that he has a holy bible sitting there right by his console shifter and I said to a man is that a Bible right there that I see and uh and he said well yes it is I said you're a Christian he's like well I'm I'm religious yeah I'm I guess I'm a Christian yeah and I said well that's wonderful I I just love that that's that's beautiful it's something to be able to actually have that testimony about one's life and uh and he said you know I I I I'm I'm a Seventh-Day Adventist and we just started to Fellowship we started to pour from one cup into the other and we talked about religion and and I gave him my opinion about how it can be a fig leaf and a covering and how so many people like to cloak themselves in that in that fig leaf and and religion and I I found that I kind of went a little far with that because he said well there has to be some sort of religion in people's lives it kind of keeps people sort of center of the road from all the fanaticism in this world and I said I guess I guess I get that you know um but what I mean more than anything instead of religion I'll just say it like this what what I believe it sort of came out and you know you get like five minutes to explain to someone what you believe you want to try and impart something that will be of value and uh you know I I just wonder maybe Lord willing that could be the brother that came here could be that Uber driver is wonderful because he asked me what church do you go to and I said well just a little church in in Shepherd you know it's uh the old Community Center and and I said to him you know what we believe there we just simply believe this we're interdenominational no denomination um International group of people from all over the world that meet there and what we believe is that we need to have the Life of Christ put away all of the fluff all of the religious behavior all the religious motions and just believe the word of God for your day just believe that Christ is being Christ like being a Christian means to be christ-like and and to be able to express that to this Dying World there's so few of those people around that's what we believe in a nutshell and he said my I really like that as a Seventh-Day Adventist that speaks to me and I said right on brother you know like we're brothers hey one day we're gonna meet over there if we don't meet again here and uh you know then we just started to talk about just just the little things in life and and how how important it is to just be kind to other people and to encourage other people and to try and just encourage other people to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and by the end of it we were like man I just want to get your phone number and hang out with you because we were just fellowshipping at the end of it and and for me that was so encouraging brothers and sisters that's what it's all about fellowshipping shining the light of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the message of the hour to as many people as we can in this world but once we receive him then we can just speak the world speak the word I mean over in uh over in the book of first John chapter 3 verse 19. it says and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him it's verse 19 of of First John chapter 3. and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him in my Bible the word assure it's got a footnote that says encourage we shall encourage our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things as believers we get condemnation in our lives there's things that happen in our lives and we just need to make it right in my Bible here again I'll just read this verse 24 if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things the word knoweth in my Bible it says understands God understands all things he's greater than our heart verse 21 beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his sight we're not perfect people but he knows that we're not going to be perfect people in our flesh and he knows that but it's not what's in our heart it's what's the heart condition of the people and brothers and sisters we know it it's out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaketh when we live our lives what are we speaking to this world when we experience sound technical problems what are we speaking when we have the song leader sing the same song again what are we speaking remember I've said it we're going to either actually be the mouthpiece for God or we're going to be the mouthpiece for Satan and that's really the truth that's what's going to happen in our lives but what which one do we feed do we feed on the world the entertainments do we feed on all of the worldly junk all of the world they stuff or do we feed on the word and the word and the word and the word and the word and the word and the word and some people will say wow maybe I could just only do so much and that might be good for you and hey maybe it is and that might be the way it is but you know what there's only one thing that the Holy Ghost lives on only one thing and that's the word of God that's all and I say Lord help me because there's times where I'm guilty of feeding not the Holy Ghost if you know what I mean there's things in this world that are attractive there's things in this world that are shiny like YouTube it's easy to go off on a tangent and you know most things are lawful even Paul said it even though all things are lawful they're not necessarily expedient and what he's talking about is just because we can do something doesn't mean it's going to help us spiritually so we need to be careful if we want to see the word grow in us if we want to have the spoken word ability if we want to be able to have the authority that the sons of God truly already have they're not going to have it but they do have it right now if we want that in our lives then we've got to be willing to take that extra step those extra few steps those extra few cautious behavioral things in our lives we need to do those to allow him to be able to move in our lives remember that he's a perfect gentleman he's going to stand at the door and knock and he's going to see if will open the door to him because in that picture that that artist wrote Drew there's no door handle on the outside of that door based on that scripture out of Revelations chapter three behold I stand the door and knock if you open the door I'll come in and I'll sup with you and you with me but if we don't open the door we keep the door closed Satan has got free reign he's got the ability to do what he wants in our lives out of the first seal brother Branham says and and then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon them who rejected it a temporary judgment and then after that is over then he goes on and they denominate and they bring into nominations and start off with that man's work of like Wesley and all the rest of them and then it gets all in a scrapple again and another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on Earth for a church age see then when he arrives he the trumpet sounds he declares war see and then what happens finally then he's caught away and then when he's laid away the plague Falls destroys them spiritual death hits the church and she's gone excuse me that group then he goes on to another one oh it's a great plan until it comes to that last angel oh it's a great plan until it comes to that last angel now he has no certain mystery but he gathers up all that's been lost in them other ages all the truths that wasn't truly revealed yet see as the Revelation come and then he reveals those things in his day he says if you want to read it there it is a Revelations 10 1 to about four let's just go over there and read this here Revelations 10. sorry I don't mean to get excited and just start reading the scripture it's nice if we can turn to it I understand Revelations chapter 10 verses 1 to about four he says you'll get it all right see so we'll just read Revelations 10. verse 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not out of the first seal which is where this quote is from this is what brother Branham is referring to tying up all of those loose ends the profit for our day was given all of the mysteries from all of the ages that were tied up and actually they become revealed as he goes into the the series of the seals if anyone hasn't listened to it recently I strongly recommend it it's tremendous to listen to the seals there's so much in there but to think that in the first four four verses he he just says you'll get it all from those right he goes on to say takes the book and of seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel for this alone the mysteries of God is the ministry of the seventh angel to tie up all those loose ends now we just come through the church ages with even history and prove that see it is it is the Angel's message of the seventh Church all right Reveals All the Mysteries that's been hid in the past all the things in the past Revelations 10 1-7 that's to be so let's just go on and read from verse four we'll read verse five to seven and and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth he lifted his hand to heaven and he swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that there and are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but this is our verse right here we're all familiar with this but in the day days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets the word mystery in my Bible has this this word this note footnote the secret plan should be finished and you know many times I just want to hit on this a little bit here the the the the the thought that we we all are very familiar with Revelations 10 verse 1 to 7 and that's the identification of the prophet in our day and and to know that that that Mighty Angel descended with an open book with a shout and a voice in the Trump he was the only one that that had the rainbow Covenant around him could possibly be the Lord Jesus Christ and he put his foot on the land and he put his foot on the sea and he raised his hand to heaven and said there shall be time no more this is it all of the Mysteries are finished now there's no more mystery we go as far as verse seven many times and we just stop there but I just want to bring our attention to verse 8. and verse 9 and 10 and 11. let's read verse 8. and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues and kings brothers and sisters the prophet for our day he did his part Revelations 10 verses 1 to 7. now there's a second part Revelations 10 verse 8 to 11. whose part is that it's ours and the part is take the book first you've got to be willing to take the book we've got to be willing to say I receive the opening of the word for my day and then eat it up you know many times it can be sweet as honey to speak about the message of the hour and the Mysteries that go along with it but when we begin to live it brothers and sisters it can make our belly bitter and you know what happens is many people they just get stuck in in taking the book and not actually eating the book not consuming it because we are what we eat we can get stuck into a traditional rut where we say that we've taken the book I've got the message I've got all the books and the tapes and I know the quotes and I know the Mysteries and and my parents have been in the message forever and my grandparents they were in the message forever and and and and and we're just the message the quintessential message but have you got the book inside you because it's not about having something that's that's tangible it's about having the Holy Ghost and by taking the book and eating the book then we become the book and that's really where we need to be that's the token for our day we've got to have the book inside of us if my word if you imbibe in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will that's where we have no fear and we're able to speak but if we actually don't have the book in us if we haven't consumed the book then how could we ever speak and you know what what happens then is we become fair game for the squatter fair game for the one who has no authority to be on our territory but if we're willing to eat the book then then we push him out of our lives he has no room to move so just I wanted to throw this out there too just hopefully a little bit of a nugget in Revelations 10 1-7 that's the prophet's work and he's done his job now we have a job to do brothers and sisters it's Revelations 8 to 11. we've got to be willing to prophesy before many people's Nations tongues and Kings not just keep it to ourselves not just have our own little group and have everything in common as it were to be able to speak the word in truth to be able to stand in the face of a storm and say no just go right back to where you came from you can't touch my family like that or my job or or my education or whatever it is we're encountering Satan wants to come around and try and act like a squatter act like he has rights and as long as we we say really he's going to be there we're going to contend with them brothers and sisters we don't need to we have full Authority and power we are the word made flesh today this is what the scriptures say our names are seen within redeemed and perfect without sin are you anointed brothers and sisters let's let's not sing that song and and just make it a song that we sing let it be the very essence of Our Lives that we truly are anointed and we are inspired because of the original life that life that John he bore a witness of it he wasn't that life he came to bear witness of that light he wasn't that light but he came to bear witness of it the same thing for us brothers and sisters when we eat the book we can't help but bear witness of that light we can't help but bear witness of that life because that's what that light is it's not talking about a literal light like we see shining like the sun that shines it's on the Spectrum a light spectrum sure it's something that we can't see what it is in a life out of Christ the mystery brother Branham he talks about the purpose Christ's purpose of the Gospel the threefold purpose we all know this but I'll just hit it just so we can talk about it here notice now again now what's the threefold purpose to manifest himself in Christ Jesus to come into the body by Christ by Jesus Christ to have preeminence to what this is my words to take a bride of his own choosing that that's what and and to restore back Eden to bring back that which was lost he says that was the only thing out of order all the rest of his things was in order and to look at this world that we live in he did come and he did manifest himself in Christ and he has come to manifest himself in the body to have preeminence in his bride so that she having the sword of the word she being the church the female she can restore all things because she will be he and isn't it just wonderful I mean it's not wonderful it's it's horrifically terrible to look at the world naturally the natural types the spiritual brothers and sisters if she will be he look at what the people are doing to themselves look at what tax dollars People's Health Care money is actually being allocated to do to counsel people down that road to counsel children in school to counsel adults to pay for all of the therapy to go through the transition and then to actually do the operation to to manifest physically what's going on internally the outward expression of the inward issue if that's what all of creation is groaning about and doing brothers and sisters what's happening inside the Bride of Jesus Christ today I I say that and when I say that I'm not saying it to shine a light and say oh look at all that it's terrible it's terrible what I'm saying is look at what's going on right here if the if natural types of spiritual brothers and sisters there has to be something greater happening in The Bride of Jesus Christ today there has to be there has to be people whose bodies are changing who's whose recognition of themselves are are less I have to decrease so that he can increase it's not just something great that John the Baptist said or that William Miriam Branham said it's what the bride says I need to decrease I need to die out to myself daily so that he can increase so that he can live out through me not he but not me but he so he could restore it all back to Eden so that she can restore it all back to Eden so that he can restore it all back to Eden through her that was the only thing out of order brothers and sisters all the rest of his things was in order remember Satan he came into the Garden of Eden God's garden and he took a bride of his own choosing now God has come down into Satan's Eden okay we just read it in Revelations 10 verse 7 he descended with a shout he came down with an open book in his hand he put one foot on the ground one foot on the sea and he said the time shall be no more I've come to take a bride of my own choosing and nobody will stop my purpose from coming to pass and there's some people that can say Amen to that some people can just say amen I believe with all my heart that there's more to it there's an action for me to do and that's to take that book that came down from heaven that was open take that open book and consume it and you know what when you consume it then you become it you are what you eat out of Christ is the mystery brother Branham says no God he had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you will understand clearly then you see on I believe what's being done God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it he kept it to himself and just even that alone one thing to know that we're predestinated to know that we're elected to know that we're Sons and Daughters of God to know that we're going to sit with him in his throne if we could just forget about all that for a second just push it aside and just think about this that everyone wanted to see this and and and he kept it a secret but he kept it a secret only for a Time and there's a group of people that it was kept a secret for the many membered bride the mystical body of Jesus Christ nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence and we know we're not going to get into that today but there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour brother Branham he says that and I'll get to it here I always get ahead of myself he says that it's the coming of the Lord that's what that silence was in heaven Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son of man doesn't even know when it's going to happen see God has it all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour seven Thunders out of their voices and John was forbidden to write see the coming of the Lord this is Brother Branham Christ The Mystery of God revealed here that's the one thing he hasn't revealed yet this is what he says here of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible it sounds contradictory he says no he hasn't shown it it's a secret but then he says he's shown it and revealed it showed it and revealed it in every type that's in the Bible the coming of the Lord the secret and you know the interesting part here I just will put this out there for free he says and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven Thunders uttered their voices and John was forbidden to write the coming of the Lord see that's the one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no brother Branham almost says the exact same thing in the seventh seal there's a splice at the end of the seventh seal I believe brother Bradham he felt like he went too far and he said too much in that message because it was a secret it was a great secret the coming of the Lord and now brother Branham after he preaches that message it was a Sunday Sunday night Monday morning if you've heard the end of the message it says that brother Branham went to the hotel room and he actually asked the brothers to play the tape to a certain place and to stop it and then he created he recorded a space of the message the ending of it and and he changed the original format of what he preached the night before and basically he says he hasn't revealed it it's a good thing that he hasn't is where it starts out because if he has Satan could do great damage is what he says but brothers and sisters he has revealed it his word is fully open and and if we're willing to eat the book if we're willing to consume the message of the hour if we're willing to get that token in our lives when he the spirit of truth comes which is the message of the hour when he the spirit of truth comes and that token gets displayed in our lives in our heart he will lead us into all truth and you know the only thing that he'll do is lead us deeper into the message of the hour it's not a cult I I just say this for anyone who maybe has any any concerns read the book of Daniel and and when that writing was on the wall and and they didn't know what it was and and they said who can who can interpret this and and the queen said you know King there's someone in the land here he's a dissolver of doubts let's bring Daniel on the scene and see what he says see if he can interpret it he's a dissolver of all doubts you know there's there's someone in the land today brother Bradham said and and people will so sadly that people will say you know brother Bradham was the one that was a dissolver of all doubts and yes indeed potentially he was when he was here but now what he's gone 50 years later he said when he was here the Holy Ghost is the prophet in the land and there won't be two of us here at the same time so brothers and sisters if we get that token in our lives he is the one that will dissolve all the doubts and it's as simple as this if we're willing to say I might not understand it it's different than what I was taught my parents did it a different way my grandparents did it a different way but I believe that there is potentially more to this I'm willing to just say hey be it unto me according to Thy Word and if there's more promise available to me if I go and and set aside my pride which is the first actual sin but if I just set aside my pride for a second and say hey if there's something else that I could do to have more of God in my life wouldn't I want it wouldn't I want more of God in my life the carnal nature that we live in says no Cain's nature which is in us outside of having the Holy Ghost says no I don't want to do what the Lord tells me I don't want to accept what he breathes upon me if you would just do like your brother if you would just go and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ instead of being baptized in titles it would be well with you but if you don't sin lieth right at your door if you just got too much pride to say no I'm good I've done what I feel like I need to do and and I'll just I'll just roll the dice and I'll just say hey you know what whatever happens happens we'll see what happens we don't want to be on that conveyor belt heading for the white Throne brothers and sisters we want to be seated in that throne and the only way that's going to happen is if we're willing to consume the book and and that's that we just need to receive the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's all that's it he says that's the one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible I just find so much consolation in that because I can see the coming of the Lord can you see the coming of the Lord as Believers today can we see the coming of the Lord that one thing that he didn't come right out and say it's going to be exactly like this and it's going to happen exactly that way and it's going to happen according to whatever I say right now do you know why he didn't do that brother Branham says it in the seventh seal he says because Satan could come around and impersonate any gift of God it was so secret and so special that all heaven was silent for half an hour and remember what brother Bradham said that that we live in the quietest place that we'll ever be in right now Heaven is much louder than it is here on Earth even in the loudest worship service that we get into and and the other place both places are loud right now we live in the quietest place that we'll ever be and so all heaven was silent for the space of half an hour because that's where the lamb came down that's where he descended with a shout because he went from being an intercessory lamb in the midst of the throne to the lion of the tribe of Judah coming down with an open book in his hand with a shout with the voice and the Trump of God all three in one brothers and sisters all heaven was silent for the space of half an hour while that happened if Satan had the instruction manual for how that would happen you can you can well imagine that he would have had so many different comings of the Lord by now can you see that that if we had a clear instruction laid out that there would already be so many different comings of the Lord because he can impersonate any gift the only thing that he can't impersonate is the word Christ the mystery brother Bradham says therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ huh he says the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in type expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he's revealed it and shows it excuse me and God's help we'll see it right here this morning What the Lord Has Done in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what it is of what it's being to know this then to try and bring it to the people see then you don't I haven't went into details and tried to explain it as God has revealed it to me we know that the Lord told him to store up food for a season and here we have him saying that I haven't went into details and tried to explain it as God has revealed it to me and the reason for that brothers and sisters is because there was a specific day a specific hour a specific season that it had to come to and you know we're we're in that cycle we're in that day and we're in that season brothers and sisters all creation declares it all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God out of paragraph 106 and Christ is the mystery of God revealed Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself would know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there is silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven Thunders they uttered their voices John was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't know he showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is a revelation of God's mystery in Christ and you know brothers and sisters we we had brother Ken he would preach it and he would say it Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament is the Holy Ghost In You Jehovah is the old is Jesus of the new Holy Ghost In You and that's really what it is brothers and sisters that's the coming of the Lord it's not going to be a 60-foot Jesus don't look for Planes Trains and Automobiles crashing and great chaos all around the world it's just going to be the secret sudden going away of the Bride of Jesus Christ and the only way we're going to do it is to have the token in our hands to be able to say that when I get down to that River I've got that token in my hands and nobody can take it away from me because God's revealed it to me personally the only way that happens is through the baptism of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives we're not going to get it through a trinitarian baptism that's of the devil that's of hell and you know the Bible says it not even the prophet that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible how would that happen if it weren't right in the midst of the Christian church it's not going to be a great demonic monster that comes and tries to wrap itself in and amongst the church no way we talked about it earlier it's going to be the most religious people the most perfectly dressed the most educated and eloquent spoken in the world but if you don't have the ability to speak the word to accept the word for our day according to what the Vindicated Prophet brought brothers and sisters it's going to be the Antichrist spirit that will actually make us lukewarm formal and Powerless I don't believe any one of us wants to be there in that position every one of us wants to have the full Authority and power that we have and so I would just want to say this to you this morning as we as we begin to close I'll call them musicians I just want to say this just speak the word maybe you don't feel it maybe you don't even see it just speak the word doesn't matter if anybody else understands it or sees it just speak the word just say someone has to be the one to go children of Israel I said this many times the children of Israel and they're crossing over Jordan they'd never gone that way before but the prophet said just give yourself just enough space watch the Levites and when you see that Ark begin to go just keep a distance I think about a mile just give yourself enough distance so you can see exactly the way they go don't get too close but don't get too far just stay exactly in line and allow allow the Levites to show you where to go and you know the reason for it is what I want to get to is because nobody else had ever gone that way before Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we just read it multiple times that every single type in the Bible was the revealing of the coming of the Lord every single type in the Bible brothers and sisters it's no different for us today we're not going to do something that someone else has done we're not going to go in a direction that anybody else has ever gone we're not going to do what anyone else has ever done everyone in Heaven when we get to the other side is going to say to you how did you withstand all the evil in your age how did you go through the Rapture what was it like to just be stepping through your life and one second you're here in one second you're there what's it like to be translated there's going to be a couple of people over there that will be able to have a conversation and be like I know what it's like I believe Philip is one of them we talked about him recently Enoch is another one there's a few people that will be able to say I know exactly what it was like to to just step from time into eternity but whether we go by the sky or whether we go by the grave we're the Lords if we've got the token so the only thing I can say to you this morning as we close is get the token get the Holy Ghost in your life it's the only thing that will help the only thing that will help we can say all the all that we want about the quotes and we can have all the books and tapes and and memorabilia the hats and the shirts and the license plates and the bumper stickers and everything else that goes along with it maybe we even got an eagle belt buckle it's not going to do a thing for us if we don't have the Holy Ghost in our lives I'm not going to judge anyone if you have any of those things they speak about something they speak about a prophet a Vindicated Prophet that was here on Earth in our day but for what purpose brothers and sisters not to create an organization to create a group of people to recognize that they're the PowerHouse of the Holy Ghost that's why that Prophet came here to introduce the bride to the bridegroom to introduce them so that they could have the wedding right here you're not going to the wedding don't think you're going to a wedding you're going to the wedding supper you're going to the reception the wedding is already happening and there's still time he's still knocking he's still saying just repent and be baptized for the remission of your sins get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost because I've breathed it to this age through the Gentile Prophet through the seventh angel messenger I've breathed upon him just like I did with the disciples whosoever hath in here let them hear what the spirit say if unto the church we've been given the ability to receive it if if we have that seed Gene within us stand with me this morning if you will or just past 12 I don't want to keep us too long today I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters just received the word as many as received him to them gave he the ability to become the sons of God what a tremendous honor and a privilege that is to think that because just like it was in John's day where the word came to the prophet even before the foundation of the world even before coming out of his mother's womb the word came to the prophet that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that word today brothers and sisters has been made flesh and is dwelling Among Us and you know his his word says that his spirit will not always strive with man and as long as he's here walking in US and talking through us his spirit is striving through man but there came a day when Noah entered into the ark and that door was closed and and there Comes a Day where the foolish Virgin Goes looking for oil and the wise virgin says hey there's only enough for me I can't help you you got to go buy your own and when they go to buy their own that door gets closed and it doesn't say that the virgins closed the door brothers and sisters we don't want to close the door on anyone we would that everyone would be able to come and repent and and come into the marriage supper of the Lamb let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord I pray that you would just be glorified with the words that were spoken today Lord father I pray that somehow someway we could just go on to Perfection Lord I know that you gave me so much to say this morning there are so many thoughts and directions but this is the way it went father I pray that it would be for your purpose I pray that you would just forgive me if I said anything out out of turn Lord or or or incorrectly father I never want to say anything untrue I only want to minister your word to your children pray father that you would just take those Lord who have the desire for the holy spirit in their lives and just father pour out your spirit upon them without measure father if there's those who haven't received your holy spirit that don't even understand it I pray that you would just introduce yourself to them today Lord so that they could see that there's a promise for them and father for everyone else Lord Jesus who has already met the requirements and already had a filling of your Holy Spirit Lord sometimes we just need a little topping up sometimes we just need a little bit more oil a little freshening up Lord Jesus and father I pray that you would just freshen me up Lord God just pour out a little bit more oil in my cup father as I raise it up unto you and I pray that you would just do the same for everyone else who has the desire Lord Jesus just minister to your children I pray father Lord I just ask that you would bless each one as we go our separate ways today I pray that you would just bless our little service tonight father in our own feeble way we just want to try and be obedient and unto you and come to the communion table we can't do the foot washing Lord really effectively so Lord I pray that you would just take what we can do and bless it Lord we know that we want to serve you with all of our hearts it's just the laws of the land and where we are today father we just asked that you had blessed our our service Lord bless each one who's made the effort to be a part of it today whether in person or virtually Lord Jesus we just
