you um yeah I had a very interesting to me very exciting experience very small one um but I just wanted to share because I I hope it will be a blessing for others um and I like I say it's thing um and I guess I don't have a spouse to share these things with I don't have a family devotions you know so I have to come tell you guys um but um I came for prayer or to the prayer meeting last Thursday asked for prayer for myself and you know since then I got a cold and since then um I try I asked for a um I gave an apology to someone that sort of led to a little bit of triggering of other things lack of sleep blah blah blah so you know um God is there with me and of course I guess these things happen right so it's been a little bit of a tough week but interestingly um on Tuesday morning my doorbell rang and it's the neighbor across the street and he says there's been a break in entry and he wants to know if I have any um uh video recording on my doorbell and so I am chatting with him I I look through my app and you know it it doesn't trigger any uh collection of images that would help him at all but we talk a little bit and um and then he leaves and uh I don't know 20 minutes later he comes back and this time he's got his uh laptop or his not laop's notebook and he is showing me the image uh cuz he's now gotten the idea his mind that um you know if you throw yourself in that situation when you've had a break and entry I've experienced that in in another home that I lived in and it's up upsetting of course right so he has brought back his note note um P notebook whatever they're called and he's sharing this image with me and he just wants me to know so I can keep an eye out and so forth but he continues to talk and he goes as far as to express how he's just you know they're not expensive things but he's just very upset very hurt by this and you know he would even consider getting a gun but I don't mean any offense and and I'm like yeah I I get that too so I'm just trying to be calming and reassuring to him and he leaves again and the ironic thing is you know as a single mom three women in the house I got this doorbell installed when my old manual one died and so yeah I can collect these images and it gives me a sense of security but along the way I've also I also know that that's no sec security too and so um that thought struck me as he left and and the the next thought that came into my mind as he's walking away basically is I'm thinking yeah that's no security for you either Amber but you have God Amen and that brought me such a feeling of comfort that I was just so like wow thank you God and so you know I might come to church and ask for prayer and then I get hit with a sore throat and I lose a day's work and I got this and I got that but God is there with us and so I just wanted to give God praise for even that little thing because you know I want to be ready for the hard things when I maybe have that experience of job and maybe a fire comes and takes the house like will I be ready so praise you God for being there for being my comforter yes amen wonderful wonderful thank you my sister bless you why don't we sing that chorus once more it just seems applicable I bless your name we can lay our cast our cares upon Him no weapon formed against us he Prosper there's so many comforting scriptures yeah I could go on and on but thank you sister those are I think those are the thoughts we all have we just thank the Lord for his grace to us and how he protects us just the course tonight oh I bless your name I bless bless your

yes by the grace of God it's been 19 years as my wife just said God bless you Sister Helen I always glorify the name of of the Lord for the day he put us together yeah it's been a blessing Hallelujah and so [Music] um last Thursday there was a prayer meeting and I've heard of it here and I've heard of it on the platform it looks like a few um Temple testimonies have come out of that and um I was looking at all that and I was also thinking of that well maybe I should share this because I also brought a prayer request uh my brother in England is sick seriously sick um I think last week Tuesday we got the information that doctors had given up and then they said well the next 48 hours was critical and so we were waiting for whatever will happen to happen and so I came here we prayed we went home and I didn't hear anything on Thursday and I'm not uh very bold when it comes to calling to ask about these things and so not Thursday not Friday and so Saturday it had been just too long I couldn't wait any longer and so I called and when I called as they picked up the call somehow they were also calling me but on a video call and and so I took it and the first thing I saw was my brother sitting down in bed feeding himself praise the name of the Lord and so I say that he is a prayer answering God praise the name of the Lord now um the other thing I wanted to say is that Sunday school is done by the grace of God all is over and at least for the next 8 weeks week or so and um It's Been a Good Year um a lot was learned but for me the highlights was when we got into um the topic of uh receiving the Holy Ghost and how it was at Pentecost and what Peter said about all the whole process that was going on in Pentecost Peter pointed to Joel chapter 2 and so the bulk of our study was Joel chapter 2 and we were looking at a very interesting thing that the Lord outlined there because he was talking about restoring everything because now the food is for the children amen and when you have the food in in a hole you produce what it is intended to produce in you and so for the devil to fight against the children he bites at it and that's why the coner worm and the Palmer worm and the locost and and the caterpillar had done and on and on and God says I will restore and so God begins that process with the restoration and then he says afterwards that you shall feed in plenty right and then he says you shall be satisfied and then you'll praise His name and then after praising his name says you shall not be ashamed and so he lift up all the list all these things and then says afterwards I'll pour out my spirit praise the name of of the Lord and so um we've had a good time studying it but what we noted was that the restoration was God's work but the feeding is our work and that is the one part that I believe there are no limits I'm not sure if it was sister Amber who one time said gluton is encouraged so we just have to eat and because every the all the steps that follow if you don't eat and if you don't eat a lot that's why the Bible says we eat in plenty then the rest does not uh happen and so anyway this uh is what I've had in on the background of my mind as I was asked to to uh prepare for this and so um I'll read a little um story from 1 Samuel 30 if you please stand with me and so first Samuel 30 I will probably take uh just one verse from Mark 6 maybe yeah but first P30 it's a long read so please bear with me and I'll would say please bear me in prayer as well I was battling with a sore throat yes all night I couldn't sleep very well but here I am so the Lord is faithful amen amen so 1 Samuel 30 I'm reading from verse one and it came to pass when David and his men were come to zlac on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South and zlac and spitting ZL and burned it with fire and had taken the women captives that were therein they SLE not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives then David and the people that were with him lifted up lifted up their voice and wept until they had no power to weep and David's two wives were taken captives aino the jelit and Abigail the wife of nabal the carite and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encored himself in the Lord his God am Hallelujah and David said to AB abar the priest ahim son I pray thee bring me hither the effort and abur brought theer the effort to David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shal surely overtake them and without fail recover all so David went and 600 men that were with him and came to the brook Bessel where those that were left behind stayed but David pursued he and 400 men for 200 behind which were so faint that they could not go over the broke Bessel and they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him bread and he did eat and they made it him drink and they gave him a piece of cake of fix and two cluster of raisins and when he had eaten his Spirit came again to him for he had eaten no bread nor drank any water three days and three nights and David said unto him to whom belong us thou and whence art thou and he said I am a young man of Egypt servant of an amalaki and my master left me because 3 days ago I fell sick we made an invasion of on the south of the terites and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah and upon the south of Caleb and we burn zlac with fire and David said to him can thou bring me down to this company and he said swear unto me by God that thou will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and I'll bring thee down to this company and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the Earth eating and drinking and dancing because all the great because of all the great spoil that they had taken out and the out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah and David smoked them from the Twilight even onto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save 400 young men which rode upon caramels and fled and David recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and David rescued his two wives and there was nothing lacking neither small or great neither son or daughter neither SPO or anything that they had taken to them David recovered all may the Lord add His blessings upon his word you may be seated so um I will just take one verse from Mark 6 yes Mark 64 so it says but Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor but in his own country among his own King and in his own house amen so this is a um a story that I say it's a very serious situation for David and for the people who are with him now you remember that these people who are with David these men with David are the same people who became the mighty men that are mentioned in the Bible the Mighty Men of David and that happened once they committed themselves to the ca of David and so so they sort of shared a destiny from that point and pretty much that is what this gospel is about that when you share h h a commitment to this Destiny you are joined to to this gospel you are joined in Destiny praise the name of the Lord and so this evening oh I want to um uh talk a little little bit about preparing to rain that's by talk preparing to rain and so all right preparing to rain now I like uh this uh story of David because it's pretty much a very uh reflective of the life of the believer in many ways or at least it's reflective of the life of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ in this end time you see David was a Shepherd boy at the backside of the deert carrying about just the sheep and maybe enjoying his music pretty much the ruling Israel was the furthest from his mind but the Lord found him and the lord gave him the word and the Lord anointed him and the Lord set him on a course to rain praise the name of the Lord and I believe this is the situation of everybody here that we were probably running away from the Lord when he found us and once he found us he gave us a word that changed our course Hallelujah and so there are people here tonight who have received this word in their heart who have believed this word in their heart who are possessors of a promise of God Revelations 10 uh 510 talks about such people and it says um so he has made us out onto Our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth Hallelujah and so that is our situation that is our position now you realize that from the time that David was anointed from the time from the time that the word was spoken upon David up to the time that uh the word was fulfilled it's a very long period of time and all of that period was just the preparation for David to Reign and I believe we have received the same word and for the time from now to the time of complete realization there is a preparation the simple fact is that God knows what is required to be there and he knows how unprepared we are and he knows what life situations he can put us through to get us there praise the name of the Living God and so that is what we are sort of going to uh talk about right now praise the name of the Lord let's see uh okay all right thank you and so um in the message and time evangelism brother Braham says he had a bride God's looking for character and then after elar found the character then the next thing was getting her ready to go am that's the same now brother the same now the end time message is not out yonder in Babylon so out there it's not there you are the one he's speaking to praise the name of the Lord and that is that is natural no man wants to marry a lady and goes to announce to everybody no you talk with her the announcement will come after she is accepted praise the name of the Living God and so you are the one he spoken to Hallelujah and so the moment the anointing came on David one would expect that maybe uh things were going to be easy after all God is responsible for the Fulfillment of his own word hallelujah but no it wasn't like that David faced battle after battle and problem after problem the reason is that God had to prepare David for the position he has been called onto and all of us are the same understand it that we have even been called to a higher position because David's position was an Earthly position praise the name of the Living God but we are called into an everlasting position am Hallelujah and so there is a preparation praise the name of the Living God now um I'll read this beginning and ending of the gentle dispensation it's a bit of a long one says now before you can have a victory there has to be a battle and if there is no battle there is no victories sir so we ought to be thankful for the battles hallelujah how many are thankful for the battles praise the name of the Living God and trying and it's God's giving us the opportunity to have victories hallelujah oh my don't that make you a little bit better now see the battle come along somebody saying something bad about you sickness come unto you maybe God give you those light afflictions that he might heal you and show his favor to you let you see what it means by it he loves you Hallelujah so God had a higher purpose he had a greater purpose oh Hallelujah ujah so everything that happened in the life of D David from the anointing to the conation was preparation for leadership Hallelujah now this is not just the case for David it's for all the men who are with him remember once they committed to the cause of David they shared a common Destiny and so they were all going to be the pillars in the new uh H nation that was going to usher in the golden age Hallelujah now the Golden Age was Solomon's Reign where they had their temple built where they had their services where there was peace where nobody was attacking them where there was Prosperity that is go the Golden Age and that is like into the Millennium but these people were going to be the stability of the society as it is ushered in praise the name of the Lord and so the simple thing is this if God fills you he's going to use you Hallelujah you say oh yeah I'm a wife I'm a housewife I'm just a mom first of all it's not just praise the name of the Living God it's not just oh yeah I don't know what I'm doing with my life brother R says you may commit 20 years of your life to your children but your name will be Associated to with them for eternity amen Hallelujah so motherhood is a call praise the name of the Lord at least Godly motherhood Hallelujah and so if God calls you and anoints you he's going to use you because what he says is that he will never light a candle and hide it under a bushel that's right Hallelujah and so don't think about your position or where you are or what it is what matters is has he filled you praise the name of the Lord is his spirit in you because if it's in you then he will set you up to service Hallelujah now um the very first uh act so to speak now going by the chronological order of the Bible because there's a lot of dispute as to whether David fought Goliath before he went to the presence of uh um Saul or not but I'm going according to the scriptural chronology so the First Act of David anointed by the prophet was him playing the H Hallelujah the First Act was David playing the H praise the name of the Lord now what happens is that he plac just play a h and then it is uh getting rid of demons Hallelujah now the Bible does not say he sang They said he played and even says he played with his hand so understand the brother if the tunes of Godly music can get rid of demons what will the tunes from worldly music do I leave everybody to think about it I know some some time back in in in in the with the Babylonians it was a call to worship idols yeah and so think about these things I know that a lot has been said about all contemporary music and and all these things I'll tell you something brother Abraham talks about going into a restaurant a very natural Act of eating and the music that we were playing was such that he could not eat then he speaks about another instant where he's in the vehicle and the person is playing worldly music and he says stop it and the person says no I like it and why does he say say you have the wrong spirit and so if you enjoy these things it's not too late understand the spirit that is in you but then again if that Spirit feeds on these things what you have to do star it praise the name of the Living God it can be done hallelujah amen so we have brother Abraham saying in thirsting for life he says that that's the kind of song I love I'd rather have them than all your little old chopped up Boogie wogie things that you try to put in church and take the place of oldfashioned hymns it will never do it no sir the Holy Spirit loves those oldfashioned songs Hallelujah and so I know maybe I'm spending a lot of time on on on on this uh music but it's just that a lot of times we question ourselves oh we believe the message we love the Lord we in the end time why don't we see the hand of God more often and we have to come from the understanding that this message is more than quotes and debates this message is a life the very life of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah praise the name of the Living God so you understand that now this is not talking about because if if David was singing you know there is power in the words so the lyric would do but the tune of what was doing it right the tune Hallelujah and so uh in the handwriting on the wall says here I heard them other day on radio singing When the Saints Go Maring in in rock time when I see the blood in Boogie Woogie what it is Grace do you think a holy God can listen to that and be just and not judge it so understand it these are hymns when the SS go go marching on is a hym when I see the when I see the blood is A Hymn but what is happening it is being sung in a way a modern way I I actually tried to look up Rock time it says a musical style with SH short rugged Rhythm and then I looked up Boogie Wiggy it says a strong fast beat and so the words were right but even the Rhythm makes it wrong to the extent that the prophet will say what a disgrace let's be mindful of these things because through the Rhythm through the music through the tunes a lot is transmitted praise the name of the Lord so once David was anointed the Bible tells us going on with our story that the spirit of God left Saul and it came on David and then an evil spirit tormented Saul and I'm probably not spend a lot of time because actually the way it was manifested he was prophesying Hallelujah but the Bible says gifts and callings are without repentance so let's just go on with this and so these these spirits will torment Saul and when David will come and he will play the har Saul will be relieved of this and the Bible says Saul loved David Hallelujah he even made him his armor Bearer praise the name of the Lord and so understand it this way that just living your life as a Believer doing the things that you love in the case of David is just playing the her you were already upsetting the devil amen amen Amen brother sister don't let anybody suppress your way of Christian life because it's your tool for battle praise the name of the Lord You Don't Know by the songs you sing by the prayers you pray morning evening every time you have time by the time you spent in the Bible you don't know how many demons you are getting rid of so it doesn't matter oh the boss is there oh this is a break restaurant oh very refined people com does that matter you are serving the King of Kings Hallelujah and he given you a very special call in this age that's right praise the name of the Lord and so what changed Saul's uh love for David and I think right away we can say is jealousy because David went to fight Goliath and he went to fight Goliath at a time when every everybody else was scared of uh uh Goliath the entire nation all the men all the fighters all the soldiers were scared of Goliath including Saul but you see David in responding to the call to go and fight the Goliath was responding to the anointing on him and these are things that we have to understand yes not not many people knew but David knew that he has been anointed and the word has been spoken over him to be the king of Israel and even though he's not there yet the anointing was on him and it's the it's the duty of the king to lead his people to battle and in this case where H the Philistines were actually encamp was in the the territory of the children of Israel so it was already an invasion isn't the king's Duty then to fight for his people and to fight for the land praise the name of the Lord and so why what David did was a response to the anointing on him now you of course understand that what Saul also did was a respon to the anointing that had come under him that was fear and so it's for us to choose and understand the spirit of God will never give you fear hallelujah praise the name of the Living God now the surprising thing about this is that as David endeav to go forward and and fulfill his role or his Destiny the first significant opposition he received was from a man who had witnessed the anointing his big brother Eliah was there H abinadab was there sha his three older brothers were there and this Eliah saw it but he's the one who came to David I think I had yes he was really angry he said I Know Thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart then he even says Where have you left those few sheep that you take care of he was the one to oppose it even though he's witnessed it now it would have been maybe very discouraging had it not been that David was the person that he was Hallelujah because according to who you are that is how you react now in this situation there are two reactions there is Goliath and everybody is reacting with fear but to that same Goliath David is reacting with hisain and he want to just go and fight and clear this guy out of the way because of the anointing that was on him amen praise the name of the Lord and so when you look at this understand what is the anointing on you how do you tolerate when people are desecrating the things of God how do you react when things are not going the way God has ordained them to go when there is perversion complete perion not perversion on the land how do you feel how do you react that should give an indication of what spirit is on you praise the name of the Lord but you see for David that reaction was too late because the word had already gone forth amen he heard it the anointing is on him he knows it Hallelujah it cannot be changed he has already received it praise the name of the Lord and I believe oh God that all of us here I wish we could just come to that realization that because we have received this message because we have believed this message that we are anointed for purpose in this end time and that is to represent our husband the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen and so David says is there not a cause I love that I remember maybe some 12 years ago I was preaching on that is there not a cause how us in in Ghana because there is a reason right and and of all the people there elab knows it his big brother knows it even it doesn't matter if all these people don't see it you know it that there is a cause I am anointing Ed to be king and this is my duty and understand that you are anointed to be the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and there is an accepted life for you there is an expected position that you have to start now to live Hallelujah and so David speaks with the people and then uh they take him to Saul and then Saul looks at him and Saul says oh you are but a youth another saying you are just a boy what are you doing here but you see what happened and this is the good part of it that David had the word and he had the testimony to back it out so no amount of discouragement could could could uh disuade him understand this this way the testimonies are important praise the name of the Living God after we have received this word the testimonies are important Hallelujah it puts God in his position and it places the devil in his position Hallelujah now you know who else said this is by the youth Goliath all right Goliath said exactly the same thing that SS said when he saw David but you know even before David was called into the presence of Saul one of his servants had called him a valiant man a man of war prudent in matters I look at thatp say this is your servant and you the king all you can see is you can't go beyond the physical what means the eye that's it Hallelujah now we also have to understand that this big problem this big situation that we call Goliath was actually necessary it was necessary otherwise all that God has deposited in David will lay dormant right right and the fact that go the spirit of God has left Saul will not also be seen but the moment Goliath came the difference was made and a lot of time that is why problems come our way they come to show us what we have in our own selves they come to help us understand our environment praise the name of the Lord so God places in in situations to bring out what is already placed in us hallelujah now I'm reading from Hebrews pram says you mustn't question anything to God for the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord and every trial is put upon you to prove you amen and the Bible said they are more precious to you than gold so if God let a few light afflictions happen to you remember it's for the correction of you every son that cometh to God must first be chastened and tried child trained there is no exception every son that cometh and these afflictions are done they are brought about to see what attitude you will take see are you going through a trial right now understand that God is watching to see your attitude praise the name of the Lord say it's God on this proven ground that is all Earth is is the proven grounds and where he's trying to prove you and so David had both the spoken word and the testimony to back it up and you understand even so wouldn't have permitted him to go to fight if he had not produce those testimonies Hallelujah all right so we need to live a life where on top of the spoken word we have the testimony to back it up we need to live a life where we actually take note of the times and inst SES where God intervenes in a supernatural way in our lives we need to take note we need to keep a catalog of those we need to look at what God's word say about us we need to think about it we need to rehearse it we need to meditate on those things we need to even talk to talk back to God about those things we need to talk about his power His Majesty we need to just drown the problems in Praise amen amen amen hallelujah it can be done and it has been done battles have been won through singing prison Gates have been broken through singing chains have been broken demons have escaped Hallelujah so we need to every time we go before the Lord and it's something that even I am learning to do is that I should spend more time praising him I should spend more time worshiping him than talking about my problems praise the name of the Living God because when we do that what we're doing is we're taking responsibility for our own strength Hallelujah okay um yeah so I just wanted to draw attention ption to one uh uh quot by says the church today does not need power it needs Faith to operate the power that has already been given to it Hallelujah now David's victory over the Philistines drew the Praises of the women and that is where that is the beginning of his Wars that is what changed the love of of of uh Saul for David because then he starts thinking well if they ass say to me that I've killed my thousand and David 10,000 then they are going to give the throne to him and an insecure King who has already lost his anointing so that was a big border and so right away he started hating H uh David and if you read scripture carefully the hatred was so intense it was saying intense that David um Saul spent most of his time as a king chasing David he spent more time chasing David than everything else that he did as a king over 10 years he was pursuing David that is what jealousy does fruitless effort Hallelujah so now David has been rejected by his family and now has been rejected by the king why so much rejection and I think that is probably what prompted me to read the the one verse in Mark because it says the prophet is without an is in his own country why so because you see there are people we know there are people we respect there are people we we we we we we love to maybe would want to even please or impress and when the Applause comes from these people they can be distracting and God does not want us addicted to the Praises and and the and the acclamation of all these people no he want us focused on purpose hallelujah praise the name of the Living God am and so David has been rejected by these people but how about the people that he was called uh uh to to begin over and that the next step that I want us to look at because something happened after Saul started pursuing uh David onto the mountains they went and into the forest and into the woods and into the caves and everywhere there were instances where God even gave Saul completely to David and David would not touch him and so but one instant that I want to just just draw attention to because I I thought it was it was significant it shows something about the the character of David was that one city called Kayla was attacked by the Philistines and this is a time of harvest you go you get your Harvest you come and then these people come and they take all your food and they leave you to serve and so the city is attacked and then word comes to David that the city has been now remember David is not safe any were but he's better in Judah than in in what was what later became Israel or the northern kingdom and so he's down here in Judah and then the word gets to him now there could be only two situations either the people did not see Saul as their leader that's why they told David or maybe they actually told Saul but he did not react because he was consumed with following David this is what bitterness and resentment can do to a person and jealousy and so you have to watch it but anyway when the word came to David what did he do he consulted the Lord first Hallelujah and then when he consulted the Lord right away the the Lord said go and save Kaa he tells his people people say we are even in Judah we are scared and he want us to go there that was the greatest of Faith but he consults the word the Lord again the Lord says go and so he goes and he try he SM the people and he give back the food to to Kayla now Paul hears that David is in Kayla oh the Lord has given him to me but even that the Lord has given him to me it's not as if he was going to go no he understands the people who are with Saul with David and so he has to get an army from here get the people for by the time he got everybody ready David knew what was going on what does David do he consults the Lord again am he says Lord will these people give me up the Lord says yes they will give you up I have just saved them says yes they will give you up and so David leaves and so continue I'm I'm I'm sure you following the trail of rejection because that was what God me to this this this study that he's rejected by his brother or his family he rejected by the king and now he's been rejected even by the people that he was called to rule Hallelujah and so David crosses over because he realizes that Saul was not will not stop pursuing him he crosses over to the side of the Philistines and he goes to the king ashes a very sh King now this King ashes was King about GTH which is where Goliath is from but this King looks at the situation says this is a very powerful Army now uh this man is hated in in Israel so if I keep him here I have a very powerful Army on my side and so then he keeps him and that is how come David has zlac which is what we are talking about right now and so he has a very powerful Army on on the side and you have to understand it we cannot go through all the things that David uh happens to David but I just said that to to to let you know about the rejections that he to have and so at this point the only thing that he had on his side are the people some of which are from his family and those who were indeed in Israel those who were in distress and those who were in discontented that's what the Bible says these are the people who followed David so it's almost as if it's the who of who of the of the of the rejected Hallelujah there were noodies but the moment they found out what God was doing today in their day and they committed themselves to R then they became the Mighty Men of David we have the same opportunity brothers and sisters we have the same opportunity right now committing ourselves to this cause now you say oh yeah there is scripture uh uh Saul was anointed to be king yes Saul was anointed but what God was doing right then was that he was making David King that's right that was the word of God to be fulfilled in that day Saul being anointed to be king is not wrong it's there it's scriptural but what's the difference you take note of it so that you don't kill Saul and that's what David did it's not as if the Old Testament is useless no it's still part of scripture it still affects our Behavior but what God is doing right now is Malachi 4 amen praise the name of the Lord and so that is what they realized and then they committed themselves to it and once they did that and then God started bringing out these traits in them that were some of them I would say yeah even uh Supernatural in a sense so let me read this now putting on the whole armor of God bam says just let them surrender to me and I'll walk in them I'll talk in them speak in them work in them oh my that's it I'll do the do I'll do the work just let them humble themselves let them just empty up Hallelujah and I I like it that the empty up was was underline because that is what we need a lot of time we go before the Lord we cry upon him he pour out his Spirit but we have nothing to receive because it's filled up with so much junk and I will never stop talking about this right we fill up with so much junk we want to know how what what the financial Market is going and who is playing this weekend and what is going on in Washington and and what in Ottawa and and and then Municipal politics and it's on and on and on and on where does God's spirit go so we need to empty and you know what the more you feed the more you empty out because if you're feeding on the word of God there isn't enough room for Junk praise the name of the Lord and that's why the scripture says what we shall eat in plenty so everything that follows eating in eating in plenty if you don't eat in plenty those things don't follow praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah so I would say this that God has a plan for today and will be only be worth our s if you commit completely to that plan Hallelujah now the story we read in in we just read it begins when David Goes to join the Philistines to battle because now the Philistines are going to battle and uh David is going to go with uh Ashes to they're actually going to fight with Israel but David is going with them and so the princes come and users comes and behind asish there is David and the other princess recognize him what is that not David isn't that the guy that they sang about him and said Saul has killed his th000 and this guy has killed his 10,000 are you crazy why do you bring him here and they said oh no he's been good he's been with me for a while and it's been good no problem said no way you know what they hate him in Israel now but if he can cut all our heads and present it to his master then he'll be rejoined to them and so and I believe that is the word of the the spirit of God in operation they insist on uses and he kicks David out and so now David is turned away and David and his spent travel for three days like we read now you're going to battle and then you are returning home you expect to at least return to some calm some semblance of normal life meet family loved one something you get home and there is no family not even their dead bodies you get home and there is no house a place where you can get down and take water and drink there is no place for you to even lay your head it's burnt down there is no City and so then the Gloom sets in Hallelujah after all what is the meaning of life when if you don't belong anywhere you cannot point to any place and say here I'm going to sleep here no there's nothing on all the Earth because you have been rejected from Israel You're an enemy territory and the place that you have for yourself is non-existent and so these people for the first time these people were unhappy and unfortunately they turned their unhappiness towards David and then they trying to they contemplating stoning David can you imagine the man who gave them a purpose for their life the man who turned their lives around he was the very representation of leadership and purpose and all of that at a time when their wives and children are in in play they forgot about everything and then they contemplating Stone in him now remember these are people some of whom will take on a whole Battalion of army just to get a bucket of water for David David trusted them with his life but you see what was happening was this because there are times that we all get to that situation where God places in a position where the people who love us the people who support us their eyes are blinded toward our it their ears are completely Deen toward our it you turn around there's nobody to listen to you it's as if everybody hates you what is happening God is telling you to look up it's a life lesson that we all must learn to look up praise the name of the Lord and that's why the scripture says David encouraged himself in the Lord what is it to encourage yourself in the Lord is to tap into that word stored in your heart so you can never do it if that word is not in you already you tap into it you find your identity there not what your environment is telling you no in the word that is Tau in your heart that is where your identity is you tap into that and see how far you have come who has brought you this far what is the way forward praise the name of the Lord and so that is what David did he sought the Lord hallelujah and so absolutely there is no way he could have done this without the Lord with him and in him the word Tau in him now the innermost circle is turning against him this is a situation that happened to practically everybody in the Bible our time is practically up it happened to Daniel it happened to Joseph they all had to tap into the word that they have stored in their hearts because what they were looking at and they were listening to was telling them a different situation Hallelujah and I believe that the bride is at that time now where we have nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ but remember he he creat a situation like that because he loves you he wants to have a one inone with you don't deny him that give him the time give him the reverence give his position to him Hallelujah and so the families have been kidnapped let's see okay that is it what we have received provides for every situation in this day am and I'm just about ending says in the end time evangelist the end time message is to get a bride ready and prepared for the Rapture now you cannot read this and says I want to get the end time message plus you want the Rapture either brother Abraham is lying or you stick to this the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the bride so what can it do according to Malachi 4 it brings them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and so how can we get there this is God's provided way you can try your wisdom and see where it will let you Hallelujah and so David encouraged himself in the Lord hallelujah he called for an effort and then the Lord showed him the way forward and he got a renewed purpose he went back to the people he did not go to tell them oh come on you know what I've done for you and how I've LED you no no no no no he went with the word of God again and then the word of God gave them a renewed purpose and so what did they do they got up and it was three things it says pursue overtake and recover we don't have time to talk about that but pretty much if we keep our focus on the Lord we will pursue we will overtake and we recover every single time it's a promise of God hallelujah Glu now what happens is that when they came back and the place was Pent the Bible say they wept so there was no strength in them but when they received the word of God and the way forward they got the energy again and they traveled and they overtook now they got to even the river braas 200 soldiers stayed back that is for you and I to understand that the situation of hopelessness and exhaustion was real it was real but those who trust in the Lord they kept going and so 400 people attacked a bigger Army a larger Army you say how do you know because the scripture says Those Who fled alone were 400 so just those who fled were were as many as those who were attacking and so there was a larger Army but they overtook them and they recovered everything so brother sister I've cut things up a little bit what I want to say and if you'll permit me this is your brother saying that if in being weak and being distressed and feeling hopeless the word of God could lead you to overtake and recover all that the devil has taken from you then may I say that the word of God has strength in it that the word of God has courage in it that the word of God has stamina in it that it can lead us to Victory it does so why not get more of it PR the name of the Lorden you see this is one place in spiritual sense that we can get fat because that's what the body does when we get fat it is storing energy for the future so this is one place where gluton is allowed hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Living God the word of God became the rallying point for these people amen hallelujah now the choice to focus on the Lord I I'll I I'll call the musician son the choice to focus on the Lord and to focus on purpose it will always dissipate the Gloom Hallelujah it always does and the devil's work is always to distract you from purpose of God Amen and so one thing is sure he will not be successful if you are focused on the word he will not be successful if you are feeding he'll not be successful if you are praying he'll not be successful if you are careful what you listen to he will not be successful if you are careful what you you hear what you look at as well because the all of these are distractions the devil has absolutely no power when you are focused on purpose you have been called to be the sinless partless bright of the Lord Jesus Christ what is your answer let's be on our [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] feet can we sing uh

think about it again the way God prepares is not the way man prepares man has to know all the possible adversities and every preparation for everyone all what you need is the Revelation to put God
