========================================

[Music] Oh father of the fatherless in whom all families are blessed. I love the way you found me. You gave me life, forgave the past. Now in your arms, I'm safe at last. I love the way you f me. Father me forever. You'll father me. And in your embrace I'll be forever secure. I love the way you f me. I love the way you f me. When bruised and broken, I draw near. You hold me close and dry my tears. I love the way you father me. I'd lost my fear for hurt still. Surrender to your perfect will. I love the way you father me. Father me forever. You'll father me. And in your embrace, I'll be forever secure. I love the way you found me. I love the way you f me. If in my foolishness I stray, returning empty and ashamed, I love the way you found me. Exchanging for my wretchedness, your radiant robes of righteousness. I love the way you father me. Father me forever. You father me. And in your embrace I'll be forever secure. I love the way you find me. I love the way you found me. And when I look into your eyes from deep within my spirit cries, I love the way you father me. Before such love I stand amazed. I never will through endless days. I love the way you father me. Father me forever. You father me. And in your embrace, I'll be forever secure. [Music] I love the way you find me. I love the way you found me. I love the way you found the me. [Music] [Applause]
