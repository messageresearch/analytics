direction and father we're so thankful that you've given us the ability to hear what the spirit saith unto the church today father that's why we've gathered here Lord so that you would change our

again for the second service this is his first time in Canada he's been to the us a few times when we were in Philippines in January we were able to fellowship with brother Dany he took us into his home and brought us around Philippines and introduced us to the many different churches the many many outreaches that he is involved in he showed us the Youth Camp I believe it's coming up mentioned it in the past but this is the brother right here who is putting together the Youth Camp it's going to be an international Youth Camp I believe is it 24 it's 2024 in Philippines so it's open to uh International youth so I'm sure it will be a huge uh event and a time of Fellowship around the things of the lord we were having a conversation uh the boys and I about brother Danny and I said to the boys you know it's kind of too bad because I didn't get to hear brother Danny preach when I was there and I think it was Benjamin that said to me but you did get to hear him preach and I said well no I didn't I didn't get to sit and hear him and he said no you didn't you heard him interpret for you so you know it's a it's a thing and we've all seen it I'm sure um when you have an interpreter and you have a minister you both fall under the same anointing and and it's a real a real thing so we did hear brother Danny preach but uh not directly like we did last night or today and we're certainly excited to hear what the Lord has placed on our brother's heart and we know how it goes if we go to pulling he'll go to preaching and uh we'll hear from the Lord today maybe we could just sing that last uh song that we were singing the fourth verse of it as we invite our brother to come and just take his Liberty today holy words of our faith handed down to this age came to us through sacrifice oh he the faithful Words of Christ word of God heav true changing me changing you we have come with open heart oh let the word of God impart word of God ever true the Lord amen thank [Music] you can we read the first part heart I'm just blessed because there's a line there that leads to the direction we're going through amen what the first first verse is that the one something that is being handed down maybe it's a second one where did I see it yeah holy words of our faith amen because last night we talked about the uh the four living creatures and we're leading into that direction this morning anden we believe that this message has been down handed down from one age from one generation and we are the last generation amen can we sing this line first together holy words of our faith all together our help amen handed down to these days to us sacrifice oh he the faithful Words of Christ amen thank you Lord changing me changing you we have come with open heart oh let the word of God impart amen what a message we have amen and uh didn't come to us uh like something that is you know being delivered and we walk through a red carpet of something but this word has reached this far for the many lives that have stood for it amen they stood their ground they did their part and now it's our part It's Our portion and uh their their Joy will be completed upon seeing us fulfilling the portion amen thank you Lord Jesus so we go straight to the reading of the word uh let's go in the Book of Ezekiel this morning amen thank you so much once again brother Berry Sister Lisa the whole family the pinetta family as well and the fellow Filipino believers who have traveled three hours just to be with with me amen and uh he really encouraged uh his servant this morning thank you so much our musician and of course all of you uh that I really feel the the the welcome atmosphere amen and uh being part of the family amen so I just pray that you can send uh youth Representatives delegates come Easter of NE next year uh it's the last part of March amen so we'll just give the the detailed information amen and uh Allelujah thank you Lord and since I am in charge of the international Youth Camp and I'm extending my invitation to brother Barry also and the family along with the youth amen and uh and be a blessing one or two services for the youth youth come amen I'm praying for that I'm praying amen thank you Lord all right so in Ezekiel 1 1 to 12 uh 10- 12 it says here in verse 10 us for the likeness of their faces they for had the face of a man and the face of a lion and the right side and they for had the face of an ox on the left side they also had the face of an eagle thus where their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of everyone were joined one to another and two covered their bodies and they went everyone straight forward with the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went then let's uh passed forward to the Book of Revelation the scripture that we used last night in Revelation 4:7 and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a cal and the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle amen may the Lord adds blessing to the reading of his word let's all bow our heads in prayer dear heavenly father we thank you this morning Lord you just make your way once again uh I'm entirely dependent upon you Lord I cannot speak anything that is outside your will and may you have your Liberty just use this yielded vessel Lord to speak whatever is pleasing to you and would be a blessing to your people this morning Lord bless your people bless the family Lord for all their kindness just such a spiritual and Heavenly atmosphere with your people and with the family and we thank you Lord for this message that you have given us as we give you Lord all the glory and the honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen hallelujah let's give clap worship to the Lord this morning amen praise the Lord God bless you amen you may now be seated thank you so much amen so uh so last night we uh the Lord has shown us amen you know these things are actually uh in US because uh the seed of God Amen it contains all the potentials amen and just like a a mango mango tree that you it has you know it's bearing thousands of fruits alog together amen but it only comes from one seat amen amen so when you uh when you see the seed you don't see anything and it's just simple but you don't have to add anything into it but everything all the attributes all the uh uh the things that is being contained by that seed is already in there it has just to die and you know to the the the soil must be watered and in due time it just breaks out and you know just like the word just like the Roman Candle you know it keeps on it keeps on unfolding itself amen showing that the Lord has given potential in that seed amen so it's the same thing with the word of God Amen uh the word of God in in every generation there is an alloted Revelation for that age and people in that age cannot live higher than the Revelation that God has given amen you cannot live higher than your Revelation you only leave what is being revealed to you amen so uh uh when you are deeply revelated by this word amen the light that is being shown manifested in US amen uh uh it only depends on that amen so that's why uh in in in the lion age uh uh the early church ages they check every spirit they're not afraid so that's why the the spirit of those people who say you know we are uh uh we are we're Apostles amen the lion anointing amen that check those kinds of spirit are being exposed amen and they found out that they are not uh uh the apostles amen but they are synagogue of Satan amen they call themselves Jews because you know uh all these things but later on Amen when the spirit moved into the o anointing and that they have to give their life and they value amen the life that is eternal Beyond this temporary life they were willing to exchange the life that they had amen because you know when you buy something when you buy something you are willing to sacrifice what you have in exchange of what you desire to have amen sometimes you look at a picture and without any knowledge on a picture on the painting you see you know especially if it is an abstract painting amen people would pay millions of dollars but people who don't understand the value the the uh uh the one who who made that painting you know they will not spend any single penny on that but the the the the one who is revelated the one who has the understanding of you know the background of this painting the background of the painter and how he had you know H H prior to his completion you know he's willing to give that he's willing to give everything he has in exchange of that amen so that's why in in in those generation under the O anointing they gave their lives amen the Bible said you know they did not consider lives their lives dear to them because there is something more amen there is something more that if they give their lives they close their eyes and once they open it they are on the other side and they enjoy the blessings of the Lord amen and so now all those people you know the uh during the Dark Ages the the the Lord has given wisdom and uh uh the the preachers the ministers were highly educated because that was the anointing given to them you know they they're willing to you know Martin Luther even uh exposed the more than 90 uh false teachings of the Roman Catholic church and and and he was so una afraid Amen to post that at the door of the castle church and even challenged the pope to to refute what he has uh discovered amen as the he was he was uh inspired by that amen but we come to this point amen that uh uh that the Flying Eagle anointing is vested upon us and just like in the in the parable of the good Samar where you know uh we see the the God's predestination there because the one who who came down brother Brenham said he is he is from Jerusalem he just went down to Jericho amen he's not he's not a a resident of Jericho he came from Jerusalem he backl amen meaning he he he left his his glorious position and and and went down to that level and that's why he was wounded everything was stolen out of him amen but you see the Good Samaritan there is not just somebody who who who who does good things in the community in the neighborhood but the Good Samaritan there is the Lord himself who came the Bible said he came where he was he came where he was meaning you know our uh Our Redeemer came where we were amen we just come here this just tempor amen we came we we go back to the Heavenly Jerusalem because we belong there we come from there amen and so he uh so when when the Good Samaritan found this this uh this guy who who Baxley left his position amen he was wounded everything you know he sacrificed everything he he was robbed until nothing is left of him amen and that's the good thing in the in in the grace of the Lord amen the Good Samaritan left his throne and went down amen and that Fallen that man under the Fallen condition it is each and every one of us we were wounded we were robbed amen and and and that oil and uh H uh that healing uh wound and and remember after that he said the the the Good Samaritan he attended to him and brought him to the host yes brought him to the host pastor brought him to a home church that's why you are here amen and and remember the Samaritan said to the host Pastor take good care of him I'm the one who brought him to you take good care of him he might have some shortcomings he might have some weaknesses but do everything you can amen but remember he he asked the uh uh uh uh the uh the host said whatever you do on top amen whatever you do beyond what you have to do he said when I come amen when I come again I shall repay you amen hallelujah thank you Lord so that's why we're here and so all these anointings Through the Ages being sent by the Lord to call and Peak and he said you know uh after that you know he said before being into the host the Samaritan said and he set him in his own Beast the Samaritan after uh touching him healing him the Samaritan said he set him in his own beast and Beast is power amen so the Good Samaritan placed Us in his own Beast not somebody else's Beast beast but his own Beast amen so all the generation amen all the bride in history they sat amen they were set in his own Beast amen so lion anointing Beast amen Ox anointing Beast amen man anointing beast and now God the bride has set us in his own Beast the pling anointing H uh uh Eagle anointing Beast the power Amen to overcome the challenge of the enemy in this day that we are living in so how should we be afraid amen so now uh let's compare let's compare uh verse 10 of Ezekiel to Revelation 4:7 now look here in verse 10 it says As for the likeness of their faces notice the first one he mentioned was they for had the face of a man second the face of a lion and then the third the face of an ox did you notice some difference but in the Book of Revelation look at the sequence John said the first Beast was like a lion oh if Ezekiel and John met in a Minister's meeting I imagine how could that be amen so John said the first Beast was like a lion but to Ezekiel the first was man amen the second beast mentioned by John was a cal Amen to is jel it was lion amen but the third to John is face of a man but to Ezekiel the third was the face of an ox it's it looks like it's rumbled right amen but I see something good here it looks like they're differ in the first three but in the end at least they agree In the End Amen they both agree that the last will be the eagle amen but let me just show you there's no argument in this if you see there's no argument because if you're going to find out amen uh uh Ezekiel was not actually uh mentioning the Beast or the creators in order but Ezekiel was mentioning them said on the right side and on the left side all right so it is only uh uh you know that's why in in the message of the Prophet there's no argument it's only on which side on which angle or point of you we're looking at amen and uh so that's why I would like to give a title on this message the placing of the prophecy amen the placing of the prophecy and uh we have to understand that it's not uh it's not the fold Ministry placing the prophecy but in the message hear ye him he said I do not mean to be sack religious my by making this mistake or this statement and if it's a mistake God forgive me but it's like a jigo pule that you have to and he said putting it together you have to have the Holy Spirit to put it together amen hallelujah so I believe I'm not misquoted in saying it's not the Bold Ministry because it should be the PIP ministry under the inspiration and the placing of the holy spirit amen in that way amen there should be no man there should be uh no Ministry no church that is on top of the other amen I am not highly revelated than brother uh mbin than brother Barry or otherwise amen but we're just doing our portion to accomplish God's commission amen and we all have a portion I may have a little portion in the ministry amen but but realizing that I am part of the ministry the body will not be completed without meah amen somebody might be deeper amen uh uh uh uh in in seeing things in this message but somehow my shallow understanding of the message Still Remains a part of a big body mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's why we need each other we compliment one another we encourage one another amen Hallelujah we care for one another amen thank you Lord so now uh I said uh uh uh the I let me quote Jeremiah chapter 29 he said in verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you thoughts of peace and not of evil listen to give you unexpected end hallelujah amen I can close my Bible from here and say goodbye God bless you amen because the Lord has given us unexpected end so that's why the Lord in these two scriptures we can compare that in the end they see the same thing amen it must be in the end the eagle anointing amen so we see but why so it's you know when when uh uh bam said when when Satan tempt you when Satan challenge you and you're certain struggle amen and uh Satan will always point us to who we were amen but bam said when the devil points you to your yesterday Point him to his future amen because I want that there are two there are two significant points that I want to live with you and I hope the Lord will help me to deliver these two points number one God keeps his appointment he keeps his promise he keeps his word and he always backs his word amen no matter how you how people can interpret misinterpret amen God backs up his word amen he always keeps his appointment amen uh and so that's why in in the book of habac the the the the the the the Bible said in verse three for the vision is yet for an appointed time amen but at the end amen hallelujah that's why no matter what kind of condition we are in right now remember in the end hallelujah hallelujah we shall overcome because he greater is he that is is in you than he that is in the world no matter how hard your situation no matter how how far our loved ones are no matter how hard our family situation is right now remember in the end of this world God keeps his promise God will piix everything Hallelujah and so he said now but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t what are you praying for sometimes you look go it might be too late Lord I've been praying for this and and yet I don't see it in our mind don't it t wait for it there is virtue in Waiting amen they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength amen because the promises though it t weit for it because it will surely come it will surely come Lord the word of God is being placed in the mouth of the Bride amen though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t amen and number two second point is just keep moving forward now notice here in verse 12 after saying the it look the the sequence uh uh man lion ox and then the eagle and then in verse 12 and they went everyone straight where forward the four beasts that the Bible and they went everyone straight forward with the spirit was to go and they turned not when where they went amen so this is The Secret of perfectly placing the prophecy as the Lord says it amen Ezekiel mentioned uh uh H uh man lion ox and the eagle amen but in verse 12 he said this Beast keep on moving forward they were Not Looking Backward they kept on moving forward amen now so as long as they're moving forward now we see them in the Book of Revelation in the end Revelation is the book of endings amen so that's why we see all these beast in the Book of Ezekiel it looks like they're being in this array they're not out of place if we look to see from the point of John amen but the secret is they kept moving forward amen they keep moving forward Not Looking Backward amen moving forward no matter how slow yes there must be a big challenge before us a huge mountain yes of problems of struggles before us but keep moving forward if you need to climb climb make sure you're moving forward if it's so steep go around you may spend longer time but keep moving forward if you cannot go around you cannot go up go underground just keep moving forward and in the end everything will be in place hallelujah amen thank you Jesus keep moving forward amen so now in in that's why brother BR made mention in Revelation 16:3 quoting this and he said then clean spirits come out of the mouth of the Beast do you know what an unclean spirit said like frogs did you over notice how a frag looks a frag is always looking backwards he never looks forward looking back always back look back Amen in paragraph 74 he said now Christian don't do that a Christian don't try to be what he used to be he's not looking where he's been he's looking where he's going where are you looking this morning Hallelujah see don't pay no attention to what you were then you've done live that out you will never return to it that's in the past and any man that drives life's Road looking through a rear view mirror will go to wreck and so will you on this Christian Road Don't Look Back what you were look what you're going to be Paul said forgetting those things which are in the past I press towards the mark of the High Calling of Christ Hallelujah don't look back amen hallelujah so that's why sometimes when you greet a a a a positive Christian how are you amen hallelujah what do we say sometimes you know when we look at ourselves and we we see the the uh the stature of a perfect man it's our mirror and we see our face which stage we are in amen it's different some of us might be might be you know in a certain uh condition you might be sick or somebody seeking the family and then then you need healing from the Lord you just get virtue out of him amen all of us you know in a stature of a perfect man you know it's it's we sometimes we Face different step steps at the same time amen maybe some are you know uh fighting for their patience amen others with their temper others brotherly kindness amen hallelujah I remember one one sister approached his her pastor and he said pastor can you pray for me yeah what do you want me to pray for you oh Pastor I I need this virtue that patience will be developed in me amen you know I see these children running around and playing something it's just get me out of myself and lose my patience amen and and so the the Pastor said okay let's pray so while they were praying the Pastor said okay Lord here is my precious sister she's Desiring to have that virtue of patience and so Lord I pray that as she desired is I know you're going to give her desire so I pray that give him problems Lord give her trials and if you permit sickness may come on her way this is hey Pastor wait a minute wait a minute I'm I'm Desiring patience why you're praying for all these things to come my way way and and the Pastor said close your eyes you're losing patience again sometimes we're not aware of what we're asking for amen because all those virtues require certain challenges amen these things are being developed amen based on the need hallelujah amen thank you Lord don't lose your patience so amen so you know that when you approach your pastor amen you're asking for patience you know what your pastor will pray for you amen hallelujah but you see all these things will come because we need to go to a certain process we need to go to a certain process so if if we stop in the Book of Ezekiel and don't go Mo move forward to the book of re Revelation then we have this thought of the sequence that it seems that there's something there some something wrong along the way amen but this the the thing is Ezekiel said this Beast keep on moving forward amen not backward Christians brother Bram said don't look backward amen because when we look always on the rear view mirror there will be a rock wreck along the way amen so that's the secret amen so all these Visions all this Pro prophecy will come to pass amen and it is not our problem it is God's problem amen it is God's you know because God is absolute what we have to do is just to keep moving on Amen so sometimes you know in the Philippines there are so you know Min uh uh some Ministries that are so excited you know when when we when we talk of the prophecy and who is not when we talk about prophecy that are being fulfilled around us we get excited because that is a proof that this message is actually Vindicated by the Lord amen and so that's why uh I remember when when when Obama was the president of the United States and there's there's so much you know going around in the Philippines maybe in some other countries as well because Obama you know he had a a a Muslim background and I knew it because I uh I go to uh to Indonesia many times actually in 2007 That was supposed to be my first time to come into to Canada with brother Vernon brother Ed bcal wanted both of us to represent the Philippines in the 2007 witness witness 2007 amen but at that time I was so active in Indonesia so I knew it was true because the Indonesian Believers pointed me to the school where Obama studied when he when he was uh in the elementary okay so so the so continuing and said so there there there there's some preachings amen sermons going around amen that we will not last long because uh you see Obama they type Obama to pharaoh to the king who knew not Joseph and it's good to hear amen and who would not amen so so and then so that's why he said uh during the time of Obama amen and then uh uh prior to that you see uh it was George Bush amen and P to Obama then here's come here comes George buo and said oh amen and that that that was the World Trade Center amen the the 911 amen and uh uh George Bush amen was so mad and he attacked Afghanistan and you know they they they Wag war and everything and so they there's another he said this is prophecy being fulfilled because it's like uh uh uh it's like Moses he was in the burning bush because Bush wiar and he is the burning bush see is the end and then comes Obama and then this is the is now rise a king Rises Amen in America who knew not Joseph amen he he knew not brother Brenham amen and then afterwards after Obama Here Comes you know Hillary Clinton amen and then Donald Trump amen so you see both will fulfill the scripture if Hillary Clinton will be he will be she will be the the the one one president and this is another fulfillment of the prophecy amen but Hill Hillary Clinton lost and it was Trump and yet they still said oh this must be the last Trump amen but Trump lost the election amen and they say Amen oh it's not the the White House don't doesn't belong to Trump it's forbidden so they don't run out of things they they're pulling things and I what I see is that they are forcing the prophecy to be fulfilled amen it's not ours to force the the the prophecy to be fulfilled our portion is just to keep moving on just keep living the life that this message produce amen so that God can say there is my bride amen hallelujah all these prophecies will just come after it will just be fulfilled within our midst Hallelujah and so now we see all all all the these things so it's just the secret prophecy number one God keeps his appointment just keep waiting amen it will not t god is never light God is never light amen so you just keep moving and and and and and and and God will fulfill his word and so another statement here now you must not misinterpret the word well I believe it means this it means just what it says it needs no interpreter and you must not misplace the word and you must not dislocate the word and if we would do either of this it throws the whole Bible in a confusion and in a chaos amen we don't do that because brother bham said if we misplace things amen although it is a portion of the Scripture it is a good statement of the Prophet but when it is me being misplaced and mislocated we are presenting a different picture just like brother brandham said you know just like a complete uh uh uh uh pieces and then you you you past it and then you see a cow eating grass or or or you see a cow on top of the tree amen which is not the right picture amen so it must be the Holy Spirit brother bam said you have to have the Holy Spirit to put it together amen and we say that this is it we say Amen this is it amen but we don't have to force the prophecy amen it must be the Holy Spirit placing the prophecy and we are just stepping into the prophecy being fulfilled hallelujah we're doing we're moving forward to accomplish what has been alloted to us amen thank you Lord so that's why brother mam make mention of this jigo pule being you know we should place them in their proper order proper placees to give us the right presentation the uh uh the picture amen uh brother bam you know you're very much familiar with this they went to hunting amen and he saw a vision and he said I saw I saw he said uh brother Eddie he said was along when the lord gave me the vision of about the bear and the Caribou amen and he said how many remembers when I told you all right he was there he was the young fellow referring to brother Eddie Bisal had an on the checkered shirt brother Eddie Bisal and he stood there and I asked I asked them if they had a checkered shirt any of them no no one had it I said well it might it's got to be a checkered shirt there going to be a big Silver Tip grizzly and some kind of an animal that's got 42 inches over its horn like this look like a deer so you see all the pieces amen a man with a a a a checkered shirt and a a a caribou a a uh Silver Tip Grizzly amen and the horn with 42 Ines so all these things have seen by the prophet and he knew it was a Vision you know in these simple things you know it's just you say it's just a hunting trip and why why the prophet would would say and testify something like that because you know we should be appreciative of what the Lord is doing for us it might be little it might be something that you might think it's not scriptural you go hunting and so forth and so on but with the little things we appreciate what the Lord is doing in our lives amen so but God has a purpose in doing these things because he is testing his Prophet now Paul said I was not disobedient to the hly vision and I believe is the same thing with the prophet of God in this generation he never at one time deviated from the heavenly vision that the Lord has given him so now in this situation no one was wearing the checkered shirt but look when the vision was about to be fulfilled amen there were Temptation along the way uh uh uh brother Benham and his guide I think the uh uh B said he said now you see they they saw the grizzly bear and his company was so afraid because the rifle was not designed amen and I said now brother bam you shoot him while well he's not looking at us because they saw the back of the grizzly bear it's huge amen but brother Benham said wait because in the vision I shoot him in the heart so he must be facing and that's kind of frightful amen and that huge and you know as it was approaching them and brother Brenham was so accurate in that vision and he had confidence because he saw it in a vision he shoot it in the heart amen and so he waited for that for a certain distance before he pulled the trigger amen and then suddenly there's no they look around and uh they saw nothing amen until until uh uh that Beast came out and and you know what the rest of the story when uh when when they get it and checked it even the horn which is 42 in is exactly as it was shown in the vision even even the small hand like a hand of a child it was just right there proving that it was the Lord showing him amen and not only that Amen brother Ed Bisal was not wearing a checkered shirt he never knew amen but his wife amen put that checkered shirt without brother the Bisal knowing it amen and then brother brother Ed Bisal was wearing another shirt and then he stumbled his leid and he gets wet and dirty amen and now he has to chains amen now when he has to chains he open his bag and there is the SEC shirt so who is orchestrating all these things amen so what so brother bham was not influenced by somebody who was afraid amen because of the attack of that gasly bear amen but brother Brenham was just faithful in what the Lord has shown him he was waiting amen the way it was being shown to him there must be something like that I shot the bear amen the greasely bear in The Heart amen that that means he was not I did not shoot him at the back amen at a certain distance and then there's a man that that is wearing a a a checkered shirt when it was completed what did the the the prophet of God do amen he just moved forward he waited until the vision is completed amen now he become everybody was part of the vision and who is orchestrating it's God Amen Hallelujah the vision will come to pass it will not t amen it will happen in God's appointed time amen your prayers may be your vision amen you may not be literally seeing Vision but look but when your prayers become your vision you hold on to it amen and it's God inspiring you to claim what you are praying for one day when you keep moving you will step one day and your prayer becomes your vision and your vision you step into that and it becomes a reality hallelujah amen hallelujah we're not challenging God we just believe God amen amen God showed brother benam a vision because there was a woman who said the right thing is said ha right and he is right amen so B seen the vision that God was so pleased with this woman that that you know he was so pleased that God has placed his word upon this woman and and the spirit said tell that woman whatever she said says whatever she asks for it will come to pass amen amen hallelujah and so when sister ha right it was just right there in front of the Prophet I I I I saw that that sin as something that is Supernatural it was not just an actual prayer line but it's now as I as I have been read breathing that every time I see that I see a vision amen between God and the bride I'm not saying brother bham is God but God was in him amen here comes the prophet standing before this woman and and and and and and brother bham said this Haiti right amen the Lord told me whatever you ask for it will come to pass and with that innocent woman he said brother Brenham I don't know how to say it can you just say it for me can you just say it for me brother brandham but brother brandham was obedient to the heavenly vision but sister hati right the Lord said whatever you ask not whatever I ask I'm just just here to tell you that the Holy Spirit told me whatever you ask it will come to pass amen what will I say brother Brenham and brother bham gave a multiple choice s ha right your loved one is so sick amen you might ask for your healing is H right I know you're very poor amen you might ask for financial and it will you know I was ex you know he was expecting bundles of dollars just to fall between them because the same voice that spoke to brother Brenham where do you want those squirrels it's the same voice amen that throws that little bitty fish he brother bam was so sensitive and and and he he he he was so confident that it was the spirit of the Lord and so he had confidence in that right it's the same voice but you know the choice of hatti right went beyond the multiple choice right amen is said H Right Said Amen Hallelujah I ask for the soul salvation of The Souls of my two sons hallelujah amen and those boys were just playing outside they know don't know what's going on Amen Hallelujah so tell me if there is something impossible in the bride now when your prayers for your loved ones for the families in the church in the things that are are going on in the message movement right now amen but when your prayer becomes your vision and you it's a heavenly vision and then you step and move forward into that Hallelujah and then one day you're going to say this is it thank God I moved forward and God plac everything amen hallelujah so so in those simple things so you see now uh even in the the in the bridge between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals said it's a mysterious book it's a book of redemption well get into that and now we know that this book of redemption will not be totally understood it's proved that through six Church ages but at the end amen when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends that these fellows probed at and the Mysteries comes down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God then the goded and everything else is settled all the Mysteries s serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed amen ding all the Loose Ends amen all the previous Messengers amen they spoke what the Lord says amen what the spirit amen says in their churches in their ages amen just speak the message that the Lord has placed in their hearts amen but you know when the in the end when the seventh angel comes he tie all these Loose Ends it seems like you know Martin Luther still preach Trinity Doctrine amen how could you consider a messenger still drinking wine is it in order in the standard that we have right now Amen brother brandham said Trinity Trinity is of the devil it's out of place when you when you use when you gauge Martin Luther in the statement of the Prophet this day Martin Luther and his people will be disqualified amen but we need to see amen that's why the the the Lord was being shown in that Vision he was walking in the midst of the the seven golden candlesticks fulfilling his word that I'm not going to leave you nor forsake you until the time of the end so we always look to the End Amen we always look to the conclusion of the matter amen because if we look back we cannot fit the previous messages to our generation today amen but thank God we continued on that's why we we need to walk in the light because he is in the light keep moving forward Hallelujah if God can do this in the church ages he can also do that to you individually he can do that to us or to our families he can do that to our churches just keep moving forward amen hallelujah and so now he said now you see I'm not making that up it's thus sayth the Lord I'll read it to you out of the book The sounding of the seventh angels's message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who were wrote the word at the sounding of the seven Church age the last Church age all the Loose Ends that through this church ages have been probed out will be wounded up together and when the seals are broken and the Mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over he said now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at the time of his coming and so forth and so on God is completing and we thank God we are part of its completion aren't you happy this morning you are part of God's completion you are part of the age conclusion yes amen hallelujah we just have to go through a certain process amen and you have to yield you have to abide with the process of justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit amen and you know with all these things so we always look at the End Amen now remember he is the Alpha and the Omega amen he's the Alpha and the and the Omega now so we have to go through a certain process and let me just share you a a certain uh illustration that brother bam made mention this one time he said in an he said some time ago I was reading a little article where the Queen of England not this queen the other Queen she went to see a paper company that had been making such fine paper and when she was interviewed by the president of the company he taken her through she wanted to see how that fine paper was made he taken her and showed her all the great presses and things and in those days they made paper out of rugs we will remember that so he went into a room and opened the door and there was nothing but a bunch of rugs the queen in astonishment said what's these dirty things the man the president of the company said that was clothing yesterday it has become dirty we do not throw it away but it's the paper of Tomorrow amen amen she said I don't understand this the queen he said you'll understand it tomorrow so when they run these rugs through the Press through a certain process of cleansing and certain thing it had to go through a process when it come out it was beautiful sheets of paper the president thought he would show the queen something that she never knew he put her profile on it and pressed it into his beautiful paper when the queen receiv it she's in her own profile in what was dirty rugs yesterday because through a certain process if Luther Wesley and all of them could see that that yesterday's stuff can only be used as it goes through a process when the Holy Ghost reveals the light from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now the last hour of the coming of Christ it's got in it the profile not of the queen but of the king of Heaven amen that represents himself as the chart has become closer into the minority like the ministry has to be the same kind of a Ministry that he had Amen to cut the long story short Amen in that dirty rags of yesterday that went through a certain process it did not stop up being dirty but he went it went through a certain process of cleansing in the end it become a clean shining white paper and look the Queen the Queen's profile was printed in that clean white shining paper you don't see any more the dirty rugs but you see the profile of a respected Queen but let me tell you we were dirty rags of yesterday but we R through the process Hallelujah and we didn't stop while we were dirty we will enter into a certain process but thank God Amen the Lord the king of Heaven is so proud to imprint his face his profile to you and me Hallelujah that the people will no longer our past the people will no longer see us but they will see Christ through US imprinted Hallelujah that's why the prophet said you are God's billboard today Hallelujah we are not representing our own church but through these dirty rags of yesterday that yielded myself pass through a certain process oh thank God Hallelujah it's no longer me anymore but Christ in me Christ being shown manifesting his life through this dir Rags of yesterday and it's no longer tomorrow but it's today his profile hallelujah thank God aren't you glad this morning amen that he is so proud to imprint his face to manifest his life through you don't look at your past keep moving on keep moving on hallelujah amen thank you Jesus oh I'm so glad I'm so glad amen that I went through a certain process amen I'm Not Looking Back I'm Not Looking Back I'll keep pressing on Amen Hallelujah because the Lord amen really keeps his appointment now you see in the in the book of Psalm it says here now he said in the song He said God is our refuge and strength and a very present help in trouble amen amen who's not in trouble if not if you have not come into trouble pray we need we are Overcomers and we have something to overcome brothers and sisters amen there's one guy who asked a Christian a Believer he said how is it how does it feel to be to be a believer a Christian like what you're saying oh you know a Christian is like laying your tired body in a Bed full of roses oh yeah then I want to be a Christian I want to be a believer and he starts serving the lord and he passed through lots of Trials and struggles and everything and he went back to the one who win who won her to the Lord said how come you say when we become believer in Christian we will be uh uh you know resting in a Bed full of of roses yeah that's true but I forgot to tell you roses have [Laughter] torns amen do you enjoy being a Christian hallelujah amen because that's the only way we can reflect Christ Christ suffered not for his but for us so Christ amen because our faith is being perfected by trials Who Wants to Be Perfect amen so you know what that means when you want to be perfect expect trials amen so now as I said now God is an everpresent help okay because he is The Great I Am right he is present we may not feel him we may not see him in our literal eyes but God keeps his appointment he is true to his word am if the Bible said he is present he is here he is here amen so he comes he is present help in times of trouble amen and because of that we can we can understand the scripture when he says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him the joy that set before him he endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God somebody asked me what was before him that made him that posted the reason for him to endure the cross and I said let us rephrase the question the right question is who is before him amen who is the joy that is before Christ than who is your joy brother Barry just re sitting beside you right she he she is your joy sister you are brother mervin's Joy amen so the bride is the joy of Christ so when you put yourself in this scripture looking unto Jesus the author and finishes of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross so it was not an easy thing for the Lord Jesus Christ to get the joy the bride there were certain things that he needed to endure even the cross he endured the the cross because it was placed between his Joy how can I how can I disappoint my bridegroom when I am his Joy when he endured everything to get me and bring joy to him amen hallelujah and so now amen and so he endured everything thing but there's something in between them amen so that's why he is Alpha and Omega he's the beginning and the end now it's always good amen we have faith to continue on because we know what will be the end all right because he already declared it is finished amen when you come to a game and the game is already fixed you know what what will be the come out what will come out after the game amen now Hallelujah now let me tell you this game this story is already fixed because Jeremiah declared already I will give you an expected End Amen so what is there to stop you what is there to discourage you you just have to keep going on you just have to keep moving forward so that we all make it to the end Hallelujah those who remain Until the End Amen Hallelujah don't stop serving the lord no matter what Hallelujah don't be sidetracked with everything that is going now is another thing he's the author and the finisher of our faith the author knows everything now I used to be a public school teacher teaching English in the school I teach literary how to write short story how to write you know and so I can teach you how to write a short story in five minutes okay because if you know the formula you can write something short story is just like this amen of course you have characters you have seen you have to develop the story from the the from the beginning to the end and so it must come to a certain Climax and then at the end you give a conclusion no matter what ending you want okay so in a love story okay number one two people meet probably it's Love at First s side and they know it's other amen and then challenge may come in between there should be a challenge now think of a challenge probably one will work abroad one will study abroad they will separate or there might be something a third party of somewhat or you know the challenge might be the woman is rich and the man is poor and so the parents is against their you see that's the challenge okay so the story will come to a certain climax amen that it that the the situation the relationship will come yes sir to an End Amen maybe they don't agree how they will finish the the trust in the renovation you know you come but that that comes to a climax amen but when it comes to a climax it cannot go higher than that after the climax it will go down and you choose how their relationship ends of course we want the story to have a good ending all right so that's how simple it is you just think of a problem amen and solve the problem and that's the End Amen so God is the author and the finisher of our faith amen we were part amen we were in him we were in his body uh uh Adam amen Eve was part of Adam amen and then God took one of the ribs of Adam and that was the woman amen here comes the serpent that's the problem that separated them that separated also them from God but God is the author and he is the finisher amen there will be challenges between them amen so he h uh uh the woman was deceived amen but because he was part when when the woman he she was dirty she was not deserving probably of Adam's love but because Adam was an expression was a a person perfect personification of the Lord Jesus Christ amen when Adam when when when when when the woman went back to Adam and Adam was not sinful yet amen Adam could have said no stop right there right you are dirty you are being polluted thank you Lord amen you separated from my headship you have no part in me anymore amen I will allow God to kill you I still have many ribs here but Adam is a perfect reflection of Christ Hallelujah that the polluted physical situation of Il did not stop but his perfect love covered those multitudes of sins amen hallelujah it was a perfect realization of what will come in the end Hallelujah we were dirty rags of yesterday but God did not reject us because he's not complete without us amen hallelujah huah amen we were out of order we were out of place but God keep his side open for us to take our portion and be in there no one no one nobody can take your place in the church you are part of the body of Christ Hallelujah it shape its weight Hallelujah only belongs to you and no one can take your part and nobody and you cannot take some other's part you just have to keep on going amen thank you Lord wait for the conclusion amen because he is the author he knows we know him as Alpha and Omega right he's the beginning and the end but no let me tell you this morning that the Lord is not all only Alpha and Omega the god of beginning and the god of ending but he's the same God in between same God in between Joseph was well loved by his father that that Jacob you know that his father amen made amen a a a a clothing amen of many colors to separate him from his Brethren amen he was well- favored he was the favorite of his father and then we go at the end we see how Joseph was highly favored he became next to Pharaoh Egypt was blessed through Joseph nobody can go to Pharaoh without passing through Joseph yes if we look at this situation well favored highly favored by his father and highly favored by Pharaoh amen we we can say God bless Joseph so much but how about in between the true jealousy he was wounded he was he suffered a lot that's right don't look at God as just the Alpha and the Omega yes there is beginning of a story and there is ending of the story but the climax has to be developed but let me tell you in between no matter how hard it is is the same God he the same God he is present he is hearing your prayers amen he's placing the prophecy he's fulfilling your prayers one day you will step into it and you say thank God in the Book of Job he said in 1 verse3 his substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 jok of oxen and 500 asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East first chapter of job the beginning of job's life so blessed the greatest of all the men of the East so we read chapter one and we go at the end of the chapter chapter 42 so the Lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning wow Hallelujah the 7,000 came be 14,000 the 3,000 of sheep the 3,000 camels became 6,000 his 500 yoke of oxen became or you know 500 became thousand and a thousand she asses he had more blessings than the beginning of his life more blessed beginning and ending what about in between tell me but during the time Amen in between the beginning and the end of job's life in between was God there present with all these sufferings with all these things his friend his family turned their backs on him while you know the news that this that the that his farm is being burned everything all these things before the the servant could finish how his his property were being devastated another servant comes and he comes another one Devastation after another sometimes we say Lord how come when I receive this message the more he's the same God in between amen he's the everpresent help oh Jesus I love him more when I realize sometimes we feel that you know he's not present he's not answering our prayers but let me tell you by this word God is not a liar that he say he is an everpresent help in time of trouble but let us give him Liberty because everything becomes good and perfect in his own time Hallelujah during the time of during the time of Israel during the time of Moses amen they were they they were being delivered they left they left Egypt they came out of there and now amen but but the soldiers were running after them to kill them murder them amen and in front of them is a wide deep water before them yes sir amen at their back were the angry soldiers whose only desire is to wipe them off yes sir on both sides were high mountains but they need to move forward they go cannot go on the left side they cannot go on the the right side they cannot go back yes sir they need to move forward yes sir right but there's deep and wide water yes sir but they had to hold on the word of God amen amen now it's time to claim it's time to place the Fulfillment of the prophecy and claim the word and step into the water by faith amen and claim the promises of the Lord amen that they will walk amen through dried land amen amen it was not wet it was Dusty when they walked because that was the word of God but it took faith for them to step into it to move forward he said we cannot go back yes sir amen we cannot run to the mountains we cannot go on the other side but we need to move forward Hallelujah and now there had no other choice but to move forward amen so before before the first Soldier could touch and hurt them God so God came before the destruction God came before the destruction because God is able he is the everpresent help in time of needs in times of trouble God came before yes sir the destruction comes amen what about John we made we we me we made mention of Lazarus I should say yeah last night Lazarus he got sick he got seriously sick and died his best friend wasn't there three days no but God wants to do greater Miracles he's never been late on the fourth day he came sometimes God can comes after the time we're expecting him to come when anything is hopeless yes sir but still he comes because that is his time he come he can come before he may come after and but yet he comes what about those mesak Shadrach and abedo last night they were thrown in the fairy prise that's right he came when they were already on fire that's right oh tell me if God is not present he's just placing all these things we just have to keep moving on Amen now let me close let me put you to the scripture and this my closing verses let's book read the Book of Judges in chapter 2018 to 28 and you can mark this down in verse 18 judges 20 and the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God and asked counsel of God and said which of us should shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin and the Lord said Judah shall go up first worshipper shall go up first amen so Benjamin Rose against the children of Israel and God had to deal them heal of his revolt and the children of Israel arose up in the morning and encamp against GI and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin and the men of Israel put themselves in Array they put themselves in order to fight against them at GI you know we cannot we cannot fight the devil in this array that's right amen and the children of Benjamin came forth out of GI and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day 20 and 2,000 men and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in Array the first day listen they did the right thing before going to war they went to the temple prayed and seek counsel from the Lord Lord should we fight the battle the Lord said fight Lord what should be the arrangement the order of battle who should go first let the worshippers go first can I invite the musician to please come over amen as we take our position in the battle amen so they put Judah the worshippers in the Forefront of of the battle amen that's the order of the Lord and now after obeying the councel of God they fought the War and in first day of the war Benjamin came forth out of GI and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day 20 and 2,000 men could you imagine you seek the the will of the Lord You prayed and you obeyed amen the instruction of the Lord about the order of the battle you go to the battle with such a confidence that you can win it but in day one 22,000 men fall dead that means thousands of women were left without a husband children without a father sisters who left without a brother thousands of them after obeying the instruction of the Lord they did the right thing and yet they had so much casualties and in verse 30 other the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until even and asked counsel of the Lord for the second time saying shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother and the Lord said go up against him and the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day and Benjamin went forth against them out of Gaya the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again 18,000 men all this through the sword how how would we react that after we listen to the council of the Lord following his instruction losing 20,000 day one and then another 18,000 on the second day did they doubt did they doubt the Lord after all these casualties on the third day and he said and the children came near again oh Israel in verse 26 all the the people went up came unto the house of God still coming into the house of God after all these casualties after all this you know discouraging experiences probably but they never change they keep moving forward amen amen they did not question God Amen but instead in verse 26 then all the children of Israel and all the people went up and came unto the house of God and wept and sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord and the children of Israel inquired of the Lord for the Ark of the Covenant of God was there in those days and pineas the son of elizar the son of Aaron stood before it in those days saying shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother or shall I cease and the Lord said go up for tomorrow I will deliver them into the hand amen and to cut it on the third day they won the war because they kept moving forward am don't stop keep pressing on brothers and sisters we may have casualties along the way amen you know the order of battle they did not change change amen they keep on obeying the Lord probably in the first by the 22,000 men amen fell to the ground dead and you know the front line of battles amen there were probably you if you could look on on on top you know there are many gaps already it would not have been a very strong Army to fight the order of battle should should not be the way it should be on the military design many have fallen already 40,000 in two days amen it seems like it's disarray we might lose our precious brother but keep going stay on our position stay on your post of Duty amen we might have some casualties but we know amen that nobody can go home unless amen we're finished right amen I desire to be here when the Lord comes and experience that body change but God is my absolute God is our absolute amen you may be in a situation right now that you have been praying for something I don't know but God knows but keep holding on your prayer things may not be the way it should be as we are expecting it let me tell you we have many proofs here

just can't help but think brothers and sisters that's the the one thing you know the scripture said that I hath not seen nor hath ear heard neither has it even entered into the heart of a man what lies in store but yet in our day we had a prophet that he was invited would you like to see beyond the curtain of time and he said it would help me so much he was broken in his Spirit he was down he wondered if he had done any good in this life he didn't know it at the time but when we went over and he tells the vision he tells the story about it the last thing that he heard that voice say to him those people on the other side say to him was just keep pressing on I just can't help but think that's what we heard this morning brothers and sisters forget about all of the junk push aside all of the problems and circumstances the distractions of the devil just keep pressing on we're so close to that finish line and whether we go by the way of the Grave or by the way of the sky we're his we

remember brother oh my brother Daniel and his family and his church in prayers and not with an emoji as we heard last night not with just an emoji and a text message but with that we spot on our floor
