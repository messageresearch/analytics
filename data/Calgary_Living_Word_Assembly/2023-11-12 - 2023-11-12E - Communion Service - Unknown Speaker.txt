shout including me blessed be the name of the Lord Brother John you've got a special for us this evening it will never lose his power um built me I've had a couple of months of very bad sought throat consistently so my voice is temporarily in this mode but I think it's worthy to sing the Praises of our God regardless so last week while the pastor was preaching um you know talking about the she of Abraham shall possess the Gat of of their enemies and you read from Romans chapter 4 uh verse verse 16 and it said therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end that a promise might be sure to all deceit not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of all and as he read that scripture and it's just spoke about the grace of God and the Lord inspired me to to write a song here and I pray that it is a blessing to you all tonight am um it's titled it's all Grace for [Music] when you see me may be dressed up for church on Sunday morning you could say there goes the saint oh I can read it on his face what if I told you that I'm a seen to sa by Grace would you hear my testimony and believe it's all Grace that you see and the man has been redeemed once a slave Now set free from the life of sinful Deeds I've been washed in the blood of the the Holy Lamb of God it's all Grace oh Grace ho is [Music] Grace sometimes I fall when I Stumble through my weakness and my faults and the Devil comes to shame to remind me how I F or right when I confess My Redeemer shows his face and it tells me am forgien all by Grace it's all Grace that you see and the man that's been reading once a slave Now set free from a life of sinful Deeds I've been washed in the blood of the Holy Lamb of God it's all Grace oh oh Grace only is Grace it's all Grace that you see and the man that's been redeemed once a slave Now set free from a life of sinful Deeds have been washed in the blood of the Holy Lamb of God it's all Grace so oh Grace ho his grace [Music] [Applause] than amen aren't you glad you're part of the body I don't know how God looks at that but he attributes the gifts to the whole body so brother John vicariously I'm part of that amen what a gift what a wonderful gift and what a wonderful reminder it's all Grace just couldn't help but but weep sitting there just the gift that God puts in a man and then he just from a service brings it forth to us and blesses the people we just appreciate that so much brother John God bless you s as me if you would it's such a wonderful reminder it's all Grace amen and he was crucified above all powers laid aside the kingdom stepped down on this Earth became one of us know exactly how every little boy how every little girl every adult young adult older adult feels when we walk on this Earth he grew right up from a little baby all the way to a man he felt every situation we face every teasing every bullying every ridicule every time he had to stand for his father so that we could say it's all about Grace it's all about Grace above all powers above all Kings above all power above all [Music] Kings above all natur and all created things above all wisdom and all the

certainly trust that everyone got a bit of rest this afternoon and even if you didn't there's a real refreshing that happens here amen that's what this service is about getting all washed out getting all cleaned out getting all recharged and just making sure that everything is right with the Lord It's a tremendous opportunity and you know it's encouraging for me to see the build almost as full tonight as it was this morning Hallelujah that just does something to meise doesn't show that you're listening to me that you're you're you're obeying me it shows that you're obeying the word of God and that means something tonight we just would like to while we have everyone standing we just want to invite brother Aiden to be Anointed with oil and we'd like to invite all of the elders in the church to come forward tonight there a request that brother Aiden had to be Anointed with oil we know that James 5:14 it says is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him amen anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord yes not in the name of the church not in the name of our families not in the name of our ideas or even our Idols but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ yes so tonight we just are so thrilled to be able to stand with our brother and just apply the word tonight and we know the oil typifies the Holy Ghost and tonight we just want to just take a moment to pray for our dear brother and just trust the Lord will move mightily in his life because he's willing to take the Lord at his word he just wants to take the Lord at his word we know brother bradam in the seven Church age book the exposition of the seven Church age he says that if we really understood this scripture here if we were sick then we would just call the Elders get anointed and that would be that and I believe brother Aiden believes that tonight so we're just going to apply that exactly the way that we have seen Brothers just move in we know that we don't have to apply hands but tonight I just want I just want to invite us to apply hands we have the ability to do that we're not restricted by any pandemic we've got the Holy Ghost amen anoint you in the name of the Lord with oil tonight brother Aiden gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord Jesus we just unite together as Elders of this church father as brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and Lord we just take you at your word tonight father because we know that our brother he has been ill the devil has badgered him and his family and tonight father we Unite together in the name of Jesus and we just anoint him in oil and we rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ and father we thank you because now we know he's set free because your word says that if we're willing to just take you at your word then father we can be healed and tonight we're so thankful that brother Aiden just had that desire father to come forward and have the Elders of the Church Father pray for him because Lord we know there's power where your spirit is and know where two or three are gathered together in your name that you're there in the midst and father oh Lord there's a whole assembly this whole building is full of people Lord Jesus gathered together in your name what an honor and a privilege it is to Stand Here declaring your word with our brother tonight and father we're so thankful that we can just anoint him with oil and pray with Him Father Lord we just ask now that you would just take charge that you would have full control over his life oh Father over his job oh over his family father every Affair in his life Lord that he would would be able to turn a new chapter Lord that he would not be bound by sickness Lord that he would not be bound by anything that would be contrary to your word but he would be free and free indeed with the Glorious Liberty of your spirit father we're so thankful for the Livy family we pray that you would bless each one Lord watch over his wife and children we ask now in the name of Jesus Christ father we love you and we thank you oh Father we glorify your name in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen go on confessing brother God richly bless you Hallelujah Oh How He Loves You and [Music] Me Oh How He Loves You and Me he gave himself what more could he do Oh How He Loves You Oh How He Loves Me Oh How He loves you and [Music] hallelujah thank you musicians God bless you you have your Bibles tonight just like to read from John chapter 6 try not to be long have many people here and there might be many testimonies we would like to ask if you do have a testimony please just try and keep it short just for time's sake I know sometimes it's not always possible but we want to give everyone an opportunity if you have a testimony of what the Lord's done for you so uh John chapter 6 we'll start reading with verse 48 John chapter 6 St John chapter 6 verse 48 Jesus speaking here and he's speaking to his disciples as well well as all of the religious people of the day I just love that he says I am the bread of life your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die and we know as we read this I just want to throw this in there we know that the religious ones were looking at this through natural eyes when they should have been the ones looking at this through spiritual eyes they should have been looking at this one saying what is he saying and we know the disciples didn't say anything they just let him talk he goes on to say this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world Amen the Jews therefore strove amongst themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat and you have to remember now the true Hebrews they weren't even allowed to touch a dead body without having to cleanse the law of Moses had a very strict guideline for them so it's really no wonder they were striving that way and we know that they were veiled for our sake but he goes on to say in verse 53 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever amen let's just bow one more time time Heavenly Father we've just read about this bread father we know that you're the bread of life and we pray that you would just break it open fresh to us once again that Lord when we approach this table tonight we would recognize the gravity of this situation Lord father we love you and we thank you we just Commit This reading of the word into your hands and the remainder of this service in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I don't have any announcements tonight I just want to get right into it I just think it's amazing when we look at this this this scripture here Jesus instructed all of the people to eat his flesh and drink his blood speaking naturally to them and and they because of their laws because of their Traditions they had to say wow how can we ever do this this man is crazy this is a Madman that we're dealing with here we knew that he was weird but now we know he's a Madman because he's asking us to go exactly against the law of Moses but yet he claims to be a religious leader and and you know I don't think that he claimed it not until a little bit later on he did claim it but we know that the people declared it and usually that's the case isn't it the people begin to declare something and cause people to actually fit into a certain category but with Jesus here his disciples brother Bram said they didn't know what to think so they just sat quiet but we know that some of the other people that were there they thought that when Jesus died that because he said this scripture here that they went and took his body and actually cut pieces of his body off and actually went and ate it I was scrambling to try and find that quote but I couldn't find it I I I think it's in possessing the gates of the enemy I'm not sure I'll find it if anybody's interested but brother Bram says that that that they got so carnal they thought that that's what he was actually telling the disciples to do but that wasn't what he was saying at all he was saying he that heareth my word and believe believeth on me he they'll they'll they'll actually have eternal life it's not something that can just come without actually receiving him but you have to receive the word and understand that that word is actually the Bread of Heaven I think it's beautiful because the fathers that were in the wilderness they were given mana and all they had to do was go out and collect it they just had to collect enough for that day and that was it and then the next day go and collect enough for that day and the next day collect enough for that day and not take any more don't have any extra don't try and and do anything different than what the word said he said just take enough for your day for your family and that's all and if you tried to it's spoiled yes but we know that many people even though they had that Heavenly food they still had to do what they had to murmur and say oh my goodness if we could just have some garlic sausage like we had back in Egypt back when we were slaves and many times in our lives we can have the word of God that that Heavenly gift that Heavenly Mana that comes down but still have the desire for something different but you know once you actually do eat his flesh and drink his blood you understand that there's no more life inside of us it's his life that lives out through us we're actually consuming the Lord's body we're doing what he told us to do we'll get into that scripture later when we uh proceed into the communion service but I just have two quotes that I want to read tonight I think it's it's it's just worth worth talking about out of 19593 31e what Dost thou here he says that doesn't need any explaining and he's talking about the scripture that we read in Corinthians how the Lord he he took the bread and and break it and and gave it to his disciples and said take eat this is my body we're going to read that but this is what brother badam is talking about here he says that doesn't need any explaining it's just this if we eat and drink unworthily we eat and drink damnation to our own self not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weakly and sick among you and many are dead see when we come to take communion how could you be dead and come and take communion how can that be you can't walk when you're dead can you but he's talking about something else isn't he he's talking about spiritual death people that just don't ever believe they can't believe but yet they just go through the motions it's just a religion it's just what they've been taught to do so they just do it that's all it's not real to them tonight I'm so thankful as I said to see the church almost full of people that believe because I trust we're all believers here tonight I I trust that all the unbelievers and the make Believers are elsewhere they're not here because it's not going to do you any good if you're a make believer or an unbeliever it's actually going to cause you damnation it's not going to cause anybody else in the body it's just going to be you that's what the word of God says you'll eat and drink damnation to your own selves not to serve in the Lord's body for this cause many are weakly and sick among you and many are dead sometimes you see people that have continual problems in their lives and and and maybe it's not a sickness in the body maybe it's just continual problems stumbling tripping falling could never seem to get the victory you got to be able to just worthily partake of the Lord's body and you know sometimes we don't feel like it sometimes we might not feel like it and if we actually don't do it because we don't feel like it then we're giv Satan the victory because he's going to do everything he can to throw banana peels in our way to try and get us to slip up and not come and take communion he doesn't care how we feel so long as we don't take communion but boy if we don't feel like doing it and we know in our heart that we've asked God to forgive us and we don't have odd against a brother come and take it it gives a victory to the Christian brother BR goes on to say every Christian should take community Union period it's your duty so to be a Christian to claim the message of the hour that God sent a prophet and I believe everything he said and not take communion there's something wrong there's something not lining up with that experience and I I I I just like I said I'm so thankful to see everyone here tonight God richly bless you I believe he will I believe he already has and that's why you're here it's such a wonderful thing he says it's your duty it's a showdown see Jesus said if you don't take it you have no part in me that is strong words to think we could just stay home and not take communion Jesus said you have no part in me now some people might say well we just take communion at home brother Berry we just make our own bread and we just get our own wine and we just do our own thing and if that's the case that's you know I I'm not going to say anything about that I I just think that the Believers gather together and have communion with other believers amen I I just believe that's the way it is that's the way the prophet of God instructed he goes on to say but he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eats and drinks damnation to himself that is if you're still out with the world and doing things of the world and people see you taking communion you're doing wrong it's important brothers and sisters nowadays we've got so many distractions maybe we're not out in the world in the barroom maybe we're in a virtual room maybe we're just doing things that are worldly but with Believers and what does that look like for other believers that see that does that make it right because it's Believers doing worldly things I'm just going to leave it there I'm not going to say another word about that but he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eats and drinks damnation to himself remember that Satan is Crafty Satan is cunning Satan is a liar he is a deceiver and he will not come in through the gates yelling and screaming he will come in the back door if we let our guards down and eat and drink unworthily if we come to this table unworthily then we eat and drink dnation to ourselves we might not be eating and drinking damnation to ourselves necessarily but we could be bringing it into our families right that's the way the devil works but if we do it worthily watch out Satan you got no room here this Fortress Is sure we can make sure that we apply the token and we know that it always goes back to that we've got to know that that token is sure in our lives in our homes because that's what eating and drinking worthily is he says that's if you're still out with the world and doing things of the world and people see you taking communion you're doing wrong you're only bringing disgrace to you and it'll only harm you it isn't that will harm God it'll harm you and so a person should examine themselves their selves and before we approach this sacred moment you ask God to search my life and if I've done anything that's not right forgive me for it I don't mean to do it I'll make it right if he'll reveal it to me and I'll ask the same thing for you said when you come together Terry one for another that is wait on one another and pray for one another we want to take this communion and if we don't do it we have no part in him I think that's so alarming if we don't do it if we don't come to communion service we have no part in him that's what he said we know that's in St John the 6th chapter that's where we were tonight and and we know that we've come to take communion so I'm not trying to lay this on us and such a way that we feel bad because we're here to take it I want to say it in such a way that we can Rejoice because this is a revelation brothers and sisters to come and take communion people can say it and say it and say it but if we don't actually understand what it means why it was instituted why the Lord Jesus Took bread that night and broke it and said this is my body take it and eat it and do this in remembrance of me until I return again don't ever stop doing it continue to do it don't say I've done it once a year and I'm good that's a religious tradition I've done it once in six months I'm good I've done it once in my life I'm good no do it as often as you will in 1964 0306 a greater than Solomon is here now in this in this speech that Jesus had in John chapter 6 I think it's so beautiful he didn't explain it to the people what he wanted to do was thin out the crowd because there's a lot of people that really like the tremendous Ministry that love the wonderful meetings that love the buzz that was going around because there was these Mighty signs and wonders the first and second PS of his ministry were happening it was wonderful to be around it but there came a point in time where he knew it was too busy there was people there that really were getting in the way of the of the true gems of the the children of God really being able to catch the revelations that they were supposed to and and we know that here he says brother br he's talking about this scripture he says he never explained it he didn't have to explain it he had to shake off the parasites that was around him brothers and sisters what's a parasite it's an organism that lives off the life of another organism right he had to shake off those parasites right and and I would say those Devils he had to just get rid of them he had to shake them off that was around him instead of trying to baby and put their their name in a book he was shaking them away he had no re reuse for them so we find out there he was he said except he never explained it watch those disciples sat still they never said nothing many times it's like that sometimes we don't understand things that we hear don't say anything if you don't understand it don't say anything just ask God Lord help me understand that that's what we need to say if we don't hear something and we don't understand it just say Lord help me understand that sometimes you might have to go and say brother Barry what did you say here why'd you say it that way what' you mean how did you mean that and you know we can reconcile together that's what the word of God says we could we can sit down and we can reason together according to the word of God but those those disciples they never said nothing they knew that Jesus was actually saying stuff that was really hard speech because remember that was against the law for them brother bam says I see the doctor and I see the Pharisee said see the man he's out of his mind he's crazy he wants us to cut up his body now and eat it and drink his blood human vampire well we couldn't do a thing like that oh that's crazy the man is out of his mind and walked away and you know we know the story he said to his disciples will you go also and and Peter once again having those those those tremendous Revelations he said to whom would we go who who who else has the the words of Life who is going to give us this encouragement that we need where would we go but Naturally Speaking without Revelation he was out of his mind wasn't he I think it's beautiful tonight brothers and sisters when we come and we eat this bread it's not bread it's not a bread that a sister with the Holy Ghost just put together and and made according to the tradition that some some prophet of God said this is actually the Lord's body here this is exact L what he instructed us to do 2,000 years ago with his disciples in that upper room that he told them to go and set up for that last supper and you know many people celebrate the Last Supper they'd have the tremendous paintings of the Last Supper but you know I I want to say those people who are willing to come and partake of the Lord's body and and get down and wash one another's feet and and and honor the Lord Jesus Christ in the ordinances that he's given you know blessed are your eyes for they see the things of God blessed are your ears for they're able to hear and and you know to have a heart to be able to receive this word to have the desire to come out on a on a Sunday evening to do this something tremendous is in store for you brothers and sisters and I just think it's beautiful so encouraging for every one of us I'm sure to see that there's Believers here these are our brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith it's not coming to church on Sunday morning and seeing it full house and then come to church in the evening where there's a communion service where we're all believers of the message of the hour but there's only a few people how does that work it's so beautiful I'm celebrating tonight I'm encouraging tonight brothers and sisters I want to say God richly bless you and I know he will for you taking him at his word this isn't brother Barry's word this isn't anybody else's word except for the word of God oh my says I see the doctor and see the Pharisees said see the man is out of his mind he's crazy wants us to cut up his body now and eat it and drink his blood human vampire well we couldn't do a thing like that oh that's crazy the man is out of his mind and they just walked away and he never explained he didn't call him back and baby him like brother Bram said then he looked around to those theologians sitting around him them 70 and he said what will you say when you see the son of man ascending up into heaven from whence he came them doctors of divinity looking around said the son of man Ascend up into heaven from where he came from a stinking stable a Manger a manure pile my goodness why we know him we've been to the stable where he was born we seen the Cradle he was rocked in we know his mother we he fishes with us he hunts with us he's out here on the Hills he wears the clothes that we do eat the food and this son of man where did he come from come from Nazareth this is too much for us and away they went he still didn't explain it see you know brothers and sisters when we look at one another it's the same thing today if you've got the Holy Ghost which I believe you do that's why you're here tonight we're looking at the son of man ministry right here this literally is the son of man Ministry and it's a Ministry to the total lost the rest of the world out there would say you're doing what tonight you're going to do what you're going to wash someone's feet are you crazy it is to the world it's crazy but to those people who really believe the word of God they'll say you know what the word of God says happy are ye if you do these things it's not something that we just make up I think it's absolutely beautiful tonight brothers and sisters I just want to encourage you and say God richly bless you because I know there's a blessing in store for each one who's willing to take God at his word and we know sometimes there's things that come up in our lives we we just can't make it to communion service I'm not judging that but it's when we actually live our lives in another realm we live our lives in another vein we claim the message of the hour but yet we still don't actually live the life it's strange how does that work things just don't add up we just want to pray that all of our brothers and sisters would catch the Revelation that they would be able to partake of the Lord's body that they would be able to wash one another's feet that there would be nothing that would hinder us from coming and taking part in this because as every one of us knows you know when we leave the building here tonight we're on fire we know that we've done the right thing we know that we followed the word of God the will of the Lord for our day so tonight brothers and sisters I just want to say God richly bless you I'm certainly encouraged and uh we'll just change the order of the service now we'll go to the communion portion I'll invite the brothers to come to the front if you don't mind standing with me we'll call Brother Joel to play the piano when we prepare if you have your Bibles turn with me over to First Corinthians and we'll just read the scripture the story from the Last Supper that we're referring to it's so beautiful because we can see that this just lines up we know when we're following the word because it lines up the instruction lines up with the word of God John chapter 6 is what he's talking about right here living it verse 23 of 1 Corinthians chap 11 it says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let's just take a moment or two and T one for another gracious Heavenly Father oh Lord Jesus we're so thankful that we can be gathered together here in your name Heavenly Father tonight we're just so thankful ful that we can t one for another Lord Jesus that we can recognize the importance of this moment Lord knowing that you came
