pastor Barry Lord use him mightily Lord help him Lord be with him Lord Lord we can't do anything without you please be with us in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask this prayer amen amen while we are standing let us open our Bibles to the same old scripture that we were taking last time that is Hebrews 11 verse 1 thank you musicians now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being by by it he being dead yet speaketh now this is the important verse verse five by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and he was not found because God had translated him for before he his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word may please be seated Shalom it is nice to be in the house of the Lord and I was happy when they said let us go to the house of the Lord Brother Jeff I love you God bless you nice to see all of you here now before I start there is a small thing that I want to mention here or uh little bit of scripture I want to read and also I want to tell you that you know we were looking at rapturing Faith last time and then there was a gap of around you know almost two months now I'm back and in these two months I had the opportunity of visiting India once again and in this short visit I was able to you know attend a funeral attend a wedding and a betr all three of them you know within the short span of time that I was in Delhi and I definitely do feel that you know in this trip there was something that I learned and I got to know which for which rather I would say the lord gave such a big gap because had I had this second session probably you know uh there was something which I would have not kept or I would have skipped so I want to really go uh you know over it once again just to remind you the things that we saw saw in the last meeting okay uh couple of things first we saw how the days of NOA are here do you remember we spoke about how we saw two you know the dove we flew it you know we left the pigeon out then he came back then left it once again and then came back second time and then you know all those things I I showed you couple of instances that these things happened okay now what I was not able to complete that day was that there is a scripture in the Bible which says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be you remember have you read that I'm not taking it because I've got a lot of scriptures today so you have to understand that this Bible is not a book of History our God is in present right and how he deals with us is always from the scripture this book it comes to life and this book is the life which is sitting here each one of you have a portion in this okay now when I say this book this book this book I don't mean you know the paper or the ink you know we it will become idol worship right what I mean is the words that are written here inside the book book okay that is the Lord paper will stay here but these words they will go inside of us and they will change us okay so you to always remember that this is not just a history book this book repeats it reveals itself to its own okay so when you see these things happening you have to see It'll positionally Place us where we are standing at that point in time okay because it is very important that you know this is one of the I wouldn't say one of the this is the evidence of the Holy Ghost do you know what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost okay let us go turn to John chapter 14 I think this is important verse 26 it says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever have I have said unto you okay so the best evidence of the Holy Ghost is exactly this brother you might as well just leave that scripture there uh so that people can read now the best evidence of the Holy Ghost is a person who has received the Holy Ghost okay now the biggest confusion is that you know brother bam said in one of the sermons he said that the biggest confusion is that uh that devil brings in is that people who don't have the Holy Ghost feel like they have it and the ones who have it don't realize that they have it okay so now what happens is I'm going to give you the exact scripture and I believe the Holy Ghost will you know reveal it to you now how do you understand that whether you have the Holy Ghost or not it is very important very Ultra important because everything that we do and if you know we are not certain because Bible says make your calling and election sure that is the first step okay now you see the work of the Holy Ghost is to bring to remembrance okay now let us go and see how Holy Ghost actually works okay we'll turn to Acts chapter 2 yeah in the beginning okay I'll read from verse four or maybe three and there appeared unto them clo tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them okay now it says that the Bible says that tongues of fire like tongues like as of fire came down and sat on each of them okay it doesn't say that speaking in tongues is the Holy Ghost it says that the the flame that came down was in the shape of a tongue okay so all of them received the Holy Ghost this was visually this happened there okay then we read further and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance okay once they received the Holy Ghost they started speaking in different tongues now when they speaking in different tongues what is happening here is that they are not just going mumbo jumbo okay they are speaking in different languages and there are people sitting there who are listening to them in their own language because what happened is even before uh the Roman general Titus came and destroyed Israel Israel was already scattered the Jews were already scattered everywhere okay so some were settled in different countries and you know the Jews annually they used to come to Jerusalem to worship but they were citizens of different countries they had you know languages of those different countries they were speaking but they come together in Jerusalem at one point in time okay so they were people who speak different tongues different languages so when the Holy Ghost came the disciples they started speaking in the languages that they they could understand okay and these people who heard them there were almost people from 18 nationalities or 18 different countries there were people here I'm not reading all of their names the name of the countries but all of them heard these galileans speaking in their language okay now what happened and then they were all amazed when they were amazed what happened is uh I'll read from verse 12 chapter 2:2 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meth this what is the meaning of all this others mocking said these men are full of new wine okay some people uh they were confused they like wow how can these galileans you know Peter was a you know a fish I I don't know what to call him but person who caught fish yeah fish monger is somebody who sells the fish but somebody who catches fish okay totally uneducated and now he's speaking in you know foreign languages all of a sudden okay and likewise so many other people now you have to understand this is what the Holy Ghost does okay see what Peter is saying but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Juda and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you harken my hearken to my words for these are not drunken as they as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day it is almost morning you know these people are not drunk like you feel okay but this is that which was spoken by the pro Prophet Joel okay now you have to see there is an there is a commotion happen happening here okay okay when this commotion is happening Peter stood up okay and now whatever is happening there he's able to place that somewhere in the scripture okay now this is exactly what we read in John 14 the Holy Ghost will come and interpret the happenings in your life and tell you that you know what this scripture is being fulfilled on this day yes okay this day the scripture is being fulfilled so when you know that now you are not worried now you're are not confused oh my God I was praying so much and now today this and now today that you know perhaps you have to understand that once you get the new birth okay you are a prisoner of Christ okay a prisoner of his love all right then from after you receive the new birth you are not living for yourself you cannot do it if you try to you will have more trouble yes sir don't resist because the New Birth has come in to make you a citizen of a different place altogether right uh my brother on the system can you project the photograph of the seven dimensions that I've showed last time no seven dimensions the triangle thing and yeah there are a couple of pictures I'm sure the brother will get it now what happens is that when we are born again we are born from above when you look at above uh brother will put it here when we look what we mean by above is yeah the one before this yes this is the one can you see it uh I think it's a little uh dark but uh yeah here this above okay this is the realm of Heaven this is where we are right now this is where we are right now okay the region of mortal beings this is where God dwells then Angels then the people who are saved in the message they've gone before us they are waiting here okay and this is the region of the lost people whove died outside the message and then here are demon Spirits this is all the Fifth Dimension this whole thing and the bottom you know which is Satan this is where the hell is now when we are born from above okay here we are influenced by things above so if you see in the Bible Jesus gets up in the morning he says say that today I have to go to go through sukar village where he will meet the woman of the well okay so every day he says the father shows me what I have to do okay Jesus came here he did not establish big organizations he did not make big schools big colleges big businesses he didn't do any of those things at the age of 12 he told Mary that I have to be about my father's business okay and that is exactly our position once we are born again once we receive the Holy Ghost okay once we receive the Holy Ghost now this is what we are supposed to be doing is that now I am not living for myself I even if I want to not possible okay that is why if you see uh in the Bible Paul was very highly educated but on the day he met Christ on the way to Damascus he fell from the horse and that day he realized that all his certificates are just dun good for nothing okay now my dear children please understand that you know I am not saying that education is not important education is pretty important it is you have to be uh there you have to do all those things but just to understand the concept of being born again okay now when we receive the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will again time and again time and again Place Us in the scripture and this is a foolproof thing there is no impersonation for this because in the Bible uh if you read the book of Revelations it says that uh everybody received a new name okay and this new name was a secret okay and the secret is only for the person who receives it yes sir okay like for example this thing happened with Peter now Peter can say that you know what now I see myself in the scripture right now nobody else can impersonate that right I can tell you my experience you can hear my experience but that my experience is my Revelation is my new name okay so that is why says that you know there is no impersonation of this okay it is very individual all right and once again uh you know many of times what happens is that when I say that you know uh there is no Rapture outside the message okay it is absolutely important that we understand that anybody who has not accepted or not understood this message which is come right now in this age okay will not be cannot be a part of the Rapture many people feel bad upset about this thing but I want to just tell you this thing that how many of us today are expecting that Jesus Christ will come and take us to Heaven yeah okay now the question is when it comes to this scripture I'm on my topic of New Birth also okay the Holy Ghost I'm not I have not left it but I think I have to clarify this point also so that you know our foundation is absolutely Rock Solid where we are supposed to be okay so if you see I have one more question how many of us believe believe that Christ has already come right Christ has already come now if you look at the denominations or anything or anybody outside of the message people are very nice no doubt about it nothing against you know people good people in denominations or other places but the fact of the matter still is that the Bible says okay when you see the Fig leaf or fig tree putting forth new leaves okay know that the summer is N I think it's in Matthew 24 Matthew 24 yeah uh I'll give you the scripture let us read that once yes parable of the fig tree verse 32 Matthew 24:32 now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves he know the that the summer is nigh next verse brother so likewise when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled okay now of course heaven and Earth shall never pass shall pass away but my word shall never pass away now you see that the coming of the Lord has to happen in the same generation when the Fig Tree putteth forth new leaves that means that it has to be within a you know a gap of 30 to 40 butam said you know 40 years is the generation basically so the uh the youngest person probably will be like you know 1948 is when Israel became a nation okay so 40 years from then would be at the max you can stretch it to 1988 okay but the coming has to happen before that you see and if you do not believe that okay how will you meet him so no matter how good a person is how holy and how Pious he is if he misses the cloud he misses the Rapture that is why I said that people sitting in this room are very elite you remember last time I I said special weapons and tactics yeah you know people sitting here are very very special so if you know of somebody who is interested in the Rapture and is not in the message now would be the right time to go and speak with them yeah because I am also looking at a couple of other things I want to share with you regard ing the coming of the Lord okay now uh I hope everybody's clear with the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah okay so now you're sure that this is how we say that uh we have received the Holy Ghost when you can place yourself somewhere in the scripture okay it is very individual personalized all right now the second thing is outside of this message there cannot be a Rapture brother bham said that you know uh the devil does not come and entice you it is you go outside the message and you meet with him and you get you know beaten up why because if any of these denominations or any of these people outside the message if they were to believe that the scripture is true that Jesus Christ had to come in the same generation when Israel was formed then automatically they are in the message you understand they have to believe you know that there was a cloud and there was a cloud coming of Christ now my question is if Jesus has already come why are we still here isn't it now we everybody the whole world is waiting for Jesus to come and they say like you know he will come on the clouds and then we will in the twinkling of an eye we will you know all be changed now the question is that people say that Jesus already come in 1963 28th February you know we celebrated the anniversary yesterday probably two days back yeah and incidentally this time what happened is that exactly on 28th February there were these seven planets which came you know in one line and brother brandham said that before God does anything on Earth he shows it in the sky yeah he shows it in the sky before he does anything on Earth okay and these planets aligning is not a simple thing because Jesus Christ was born when such an alignment happened okay Moses The Exodus Prophet was born when such an alignment was you know happened you see so this alignment of planets and that also almost all the planets because we are on the eighth there are seven planets which were you know visible in one line and we are on the eighth planet Pluto is no longer considered a planet so the whole solar system was you know witnessing a big event on the 28th of February okay the entire Cosmos was watching something happening on Earth yeah all seven of them were lined up okay now what happens is question again you know if Jesus Christ has come why are we still here why are we not gone the very simple answer for that is you have to look back at the first coming Jesus Christ was born on whatever day he was born on but he had to minister for 33 and a half years okay the dead were raised Graves were open did not happen on the same day he was born it took about 33 and a half years Jesus had to die he had he had to raise up when he rose up the dead in Christ or the Old Testament Saints they rose up and people saw them walking in Jerusalem okay similarly when the second coming happens it doesn't happen in a moment second coming also has three parts like I told you last time what are the three parts shout voice and Trump the shout will gather the living bride we might be in different phases of life life different places the shout will gather us okay now the message goes out okay and the voice will raise the dead Saints The Voice will come from within the bride it is the bridegroom who's standing there his voice Echoes from inside the bride okay the dead in Christ will raise up again and at the Trump all of us will be changed okay so now like he said last time I'm always is refering to the last meeting because this is in fact a continuation now what happens is like the last time shout voice and Trump and we saw that when the shout Goes Forth okay Rapture has already started potentially it has identified it you know its candidates okay and what it does is that it picks them up okay we read it in the scripture last time two will be in bed one will be caught up two will be in the field one will be caught up caught up where where are they caught up where the meat is that means they will be brought together where the carcass is where the meat is so they are all caught up and brought to the message okay so this is where we all meet all right now once this happens at a certain point in time when the last sheep comes in and you know the time is over Christ will take us home and the our body change will happen in the twinkling of an eye okay but Rapture is a process the second coming is a process it carries on it till the time all the thoughts of God are not manifested here it carries on okay because everybody who's a candidate of the Rapture has to appear on Earth and has to identify his position in Christ that is when the Rapture happens brother mam said that when the bride recognizes her position that is when the Rapture will come by okay now the coming of the Lord is one of the biggest mysteries in the Bible how many of us know that there are three Bibles that were written yeah one was in the sky yeah second was in the pyramid yeah and the third is this one that we have in our hands okay now when we read the scripture the Bible says nobody knows the day of his coming not even the angels but only the father who is in heaven okay now I would also want to uh read this a little further chapter 24 that we learn read right now verse 32 and 353 we read now uh I want to read verse 36 but of that day and okay I'll read one uh verse before so that you know we are we get the context we were reading this all this file okay Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only okay go further brother but as the days of no were so shall be the coming of son of man be okay so now you see how this days of no okay is plugged into this scripture also okay so when you see things like this happening you know our Ana should just go up okay oh my God I read this somewhere okay now this is what is happening Brother for as the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that no entered the Ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be okay it is important that you know why I'm emphasizing on this is because like I already told you the evidence of the Holy Ghost is that you know our present situations he will place it in the scripture okay and let us know that this is the time and season that you are in right now okay brother next verse there shall be two in the field one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the Mill one shall be taken the other left left watch therefore for ye know not what are are your lord do come okay you don't know know the are okay go further brother but know this there is a butt here okay the butt changes the whole sentence you know like for example John is a very nice person but you know it changes the whole so you know uh brother go back to the previous verse watch therefore for ye know not what are your lord do come but yeah all this while he was saying that you do not know but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken you understand that so what is the scripture saying here you know as it is you do not know but if you know the date when he came okay you can be prepared the world for them he's coming like a thief they will never know okay their house will be broken up anybody who doesn't know that he has come their house will be broken up you understand so this but makes a lot of difference in the scripture and we standing here today where we are 63 years prior we already know that on such and such date now what is the significance of knowing the date the significance of knowing the date see the scripture says here that if you know that you know the thief was going to come if you knew then what you would have been prepared to defend your home okay and those those people who don't know the thief is coming their house will be broken up so what that means is if you know when he's coming you can be prepared for the Rapture okay and in case if you do not know then God bless three and a half years of tribulation is on the earth anyways okay but you to understand this is exactly what the scripture says I am not setting the date for the Rapture I I I do not know when our bodies are going to to change but I definitely know when the Lord Has Come okay when he comes and he speaks to us I know right and this is exactly now coming to this point here okay uh let's go further there is something else I want to speak but uh let me finish this therefore be uh ye also ready see the Bible says be ready be you know if you don't know that time what will you be ready for Bible says very clearly be ready for in such an are that as ye think not the son of man cometh then who is a faithful and wise servant whom had the Lord made ruler of his household to give meat in due season okay now this the Lord is talking about the prophet in you know meat in due season so that the Bride Can mature okay blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing okay and of course this is about the you know Rapture that we talking about so please understand that we today outside the message no scope there is absolutely no way they will know when the Rapture is coming okay first thing second thing is that if even if they try to copy it they cannot do it because you know the cloud has come and if you acknowledge the crowd you're already in the message if you if you don't know that then uh you know there's nothing else left you can just be in good hope that you know one day he will come he will take us one day he will come but the ones who are to go will already have gone by the time okay now what happens is when we see the scripture you know that you are going away is near and the biggest mystery like I was saying in the Bible is the coming of the Lord okay it was hidden from the beginning it was hidden from the beginning why because every time you know the coming was going to happen the devil he gets a wind of it he comes and corrupts it you know Christ was supposed to be born in the Garden of Eden he was supposed to be born there but the serpent beu Eve and you know Abel was born then once again now this is another instance which I want to go into in a little depth but before I do that I want you to take out one scripture brother Joshua 5:4 Book of Joshua 5 verse 14 can you display that please uh maybe you you can take it from 13 verse and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man against oh there stood a man over against him with his sword drone in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries okay so Joshua is seeing a man who is standing there he goes and asks him are you with us or with the enemies and the man who was standing there says and he said nay but as the captain of the host of the Lord and I am now come and Joshua fell on his face to the ground and did worship and said unto him what sayith my Lord unto his servant now you should understand the reaction of Joshua a mighty warrior okay he sees the angel of the Lord he sees the Lord what does he do he falls on his face okay immediately he falls on his face he's like you know no no I I can't do you know I've seen the Lord okay and the Lord says take your shoes off you know next verse you'll see he says you know the land you're standing this the ground you're standing on is Holy yeah the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua losen thy shoe from thy foot for the the place whereon thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so taking off your shoes actually means removing your understanding okay changing your understanding you know do don't look at god with your own understanding you have to go to the scripture okay because God is his own interpreter so take off your shoes Okay so Joshua did that then there is another person in the scripture uh which is uh Gideon okay not just G there are so many people who have seen the angel of the Lord and they like you know they go like really scared if you want to read Gideon G is in Judges chapter 6 verse 22 brother if you can display it then you know I can save some time uh and I can just read it off there Judges chapter 6 verse 22 God bless you and when Gideon perceived that it he was an Angel of the Lord Gideon said alas oh Lord God for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not for Thou shalt not die okay if you read uh verse 21 also brother it says that you know okay so you know this is what the angel of the Lord did now Gideon sees this Angel and he's so scared he's so scared he's like you know I'm going to die okay now look at this this is what Warriors are doing okay when they see the angel of the Lord they get scared like anything they're like oh my God what do we do we've seen the Lord okay now this is what Warriors are doing but look at this Genesis chapter 18 verse 17 onwards h no I think we go a little uh before this probably 12 verse 12 therefore Sara laughed okay now look at this what SAR is doing therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a shity bear a child which I'm old okay now the Lord is saying here that you know Sarah laughed why did she laugh okay uh brother put the scripture back is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life SAR shall have a son okay according to the time of life which means 28 days okay so uh probably you know February 28th yeah according to the time of life he was supposed to come back and Sarah was supposed to have a son and the son would have been son would have been Jesus okay but alas because Jesus also called the son of Abraham at some places so he was supposed to be born right there but because of Sarah's unbelief here another person was born not Jesus okay now the important thing here is next verse then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did laugh can you imagine somebody saying you know Lord standing right in front and Lord said why did you laugh and she goes like I did not laugh you know contrast this with the Warriors they're standing there they're falling on their face and this poor little lady she is calling God a liar this time she's not doing it behind his back this time she's doing it on his face can you imagine that she's saying on his face no I did not laugh you're lying and can you imagine if you know Joshua Gideon manoha so many people in the Bible you know they just imagine if they understood that this is where the Lord is and this is what he's capable of okay and they're falling on their faces but this poor little Sarah standing right in front of the Lord telling him that no Lord this time you are wrong you are lying because I did not laugh Bible says he was scared regardless you know God would have split her atoms at that very moment can you understand he would have split her you know made made her atoms disappear because he's the Lord okay but the Lord held his peace you know why because there was a seven ltered man standing right there who was her husband Abraham ending with h okay he was standing there that is why my dear sisters I would say this is the importance of your marital relationship can you imagine why does Sarah call Abraham Lord know Bible in First Peter it says that Sarah used to call Abraham Lord If Abraham would not have been there you know Sarah would not have seen the light of day the same is today for the church and the pastor the position that the Pastor holds in the church is phenomenal he stands in the Gap so please we do not want to be like Sarah in this situation yes Sarah is a very good person otherwise you know Hebrews 11 you see actually all everybody from Genesis to uh Revelation everybody has sinned but when God remembers in Hebrews 11 he only remembers the good things that they have done okay he just you know throws everything else in the sea of forgetfulness but that Sarah is me and you without this message you know what would have happened to us that is why I would not debate whether the wife is equal with the husband or husband is stronger or weaker I'm not getting into that all I'm trying to say is when a wife understands her position she can do wonders you know I would just give you an example like you know there is this uh acid called sulfuric acid okay I think it h204 isn't it yeah h204 hydrogen sulfur and oxygen when you mix them it becomes very corrosive but otherwise we are always drinking water that has got hydrogen and oxygen okay but when these chemicals come into their position then you can't drink it you understand then the devil will get you know a jolt when he comes to touch a wife who knows her position when the Devil comes and you know tries to bring confusion in the house and the wife knows her position devil cannot touch her devil cannot touch her family devil cannot touch her children because she is a wife who knows a position yeah in the same way the same relationship happens with the church and the pastor a church which understands the the importance of that position is a formidable Church nobody can come close to it you know you speak and things will happen because you are in the position you know uh gave an example of a traffic policeman a 20 Tire a big huge truck you know coming at huge speed the policeman a frail man you know just shows his hand like this and no matter how big the truck is you know now how many wheels or whatever you know the uh cubic capacity the truck has to stop you know it's the power is not in the hands power is when the person understands that I am an officer of the law I am an ambassador of Heaven I have to stand in line I have to stand right behind my pastor okay when you do that you see your most of your problem in your life are already solved okay now I say this because these are foundational things fundamental things okay big Revelations probably yeah important but this is where the foxes you know he said the fox is the roots okay so you have to understand no matter how educated the wife is no matter how strong or how intelligent or how whatever but she has to understand her position with her husband and when she does that no devil can come close to her absolutely no the same is for the church and the same is when you understand the office of the Prophet you know forget the devil God could not do anything to Sarah can you beat that forget devil even the Lord had to stand there you know hands folded I can't touch her right now because there is Abraham here you see that no matter how big a sinner we are only if we understand our position we are totally you know in a different realm altoe we had we saw that you know chart so that is why you have to see that God has very good things in store for us and his scripture is very simple you don't have to be a PhD and a you know doctor of divinity and ddld and all those to understand it a Peter who could not sign his name can understand you and me can too okay now coming to the coming of the Lord you see this is another thing that I want to really emphasize on because rapturing faith is based on a lot of things but the important thing right now that we are going to look at is the coming of the Lord you to understand I was telling you that the Bible is written in three places and all these three places talk about the coming of the Lord God if you see Celestial in the skies okay it talks about Virgo Virgo is the Virgin which is the first coming of Christ virgin born okay then Leo Leo is the second coming as the lion of the tribe of Judah okay so this is the mystery see Bible says in Hebrews 10 that the old Testament is the shadow of the New Testament okay the original is the New Testament so the coming of the Lord the whole of the Old Testament was a shadow shadow is uh like for example you keep your hand here you'll be able to see a shadow you can say that this is a hand it's got five fingers but you cannot say what is the color of the hand yeah you cannot say if it's a male hand or a female hand okay it'll give you a vake picture the Shadow the Old Testament yes the same it give you a shadow example of a shadow uh Abraham went uh to mount morah he was supposed to sacrifice Isaac okay then he took the knife he was about to kill him and the uh Angel appeared said don't harm the child then he found a ram in the bush Okay then he untied the ram he sacrificed the ram both of them came back so this was what happened in the Old Testament now in the Old Testament it is difficult we can't say who the ram was who Isaac was okay and who Abraham was because that is a shadow the original was when Jesus Christ came he was the Lamb of God okay that is the original he was the Lamb of God Isaac was you and me who was supposed to be you know killed so instead of us he took the death okay so this is the original and Old Testament Shadow the complete of the Old Testament Shadow okay now to tell the truth even if you see the real thing the real deal is today the bride this is the real uh you know picture because everything else was made was written so that today you and me can identify our position Abraham did not have a Bible you see Abraham did not have a Bible neither did most of the Old Testament people okay they had just writings which they could refer to and you know they just wrote about themselves mostly you know David saying you know in the Psalms he's writing about himself but as a prophet as a prophecy he was writing about Jesus Christ okay so we saw the first coming was written in the skies the second in the pyramid brother I don't know if I have the picture of the pyramid is it there if it is there you can if you can just display no this is not yes now this is the uh image of the pyramid if you see in the pyramid there is the King's chamber there is the great gallery and the Queen's chamber and of course the entrance now this great Gallery it seems has seven steps and this is the place where uh the receiving uh thing is like you know where the elazer thing so now the seven steps are the seven Church ages okay and here is the prophet who is introducer okay and this is the King's chamber inside the king's chamber I forgot to put the picture but inside the king's chamber you find an empty tomb in the pyramid actually in the pyramid that is there okay so this once again talks about the second coming of Christ now there are too many numbers in the pyramid the casing stones of the pyramid were 1 lakh 144,000 which corresponds to the number of jeice that will be saved okay 1 lakh 144 12,000 from each tribe now the radius of the pyramid and it is in the bang center of the landmass of the earth that is where this pyramid is placed it lines up with stars in the sky Alpha draon is and you know all those things so this is where the second Bible was written okay and the third Bible of course we have it right here in our hands okay now uh you can take this off I'm not going in deep in the pyramids but I just want to show you that you know this is where the second Bible was written the third is with us okay now the coming of the Lord was a mystery but today it is history okay now it is happened and it is gone so when we read this you have to see where we are standing today where are we standing today okay now let us turn a little bit towards the world events okay I told you from the scripture we can deduce a little bit of the days of Noah okay from the scriptures we saw last meeting we corresponded with it okay and we were able to place but today if you see the world events which are happening Russia is going ahead and annexing a lot of countries okay it started with cria okay which is a part of Ukraine now there's a war which is going on for the last four years now the question is why is it important for us as Believers to see what Russia is doing uh brother if you can uh open one message okay I'll give you the name of the message but before I do that uh does anybody know about the three curtains that brother brandham spoke about three curtains can you name them Iron Curtain purple curtain and bamboo curtain okay these are the three curtains that we have to keep watching and incidentally uh I'll tell you the three curtains the purple curtain is Rome okay now do you know that the pope is hospitalized right so there is movement in the purple curtain do you know that Russia is already in the war the Iron Curtain right and also China for that matter right all of a sudden they've also become a world power yeah so these things were prophesied by the prophet already now if you actually look at it these are the countries which matter today so and also we as Believers are we supposed to be looking at all these politics which are happening there see let's see what the prophet said uh I want you to uh take the uh message brother perian Church age verse 177 yeah pergami pergami perian Church age par 177 it was preached in 1960 I'm sorry I should have given it to you earlier but it's okay here brother bam says watch Russia watch Russia the King of the North how do you watch Russia actually how do you watch Russia only if you're aware of what is happening there current affairs so is it important to follow the news is it important to know what is happening around you yes it is see uh yeah so there is three curtains remember this there is the Iron [Music] Curtain there is the bamboo curtain red China and so and there is the purple curtain and that is the deceiver okay so now here is says watch Russia I don't know how long I live no brother you'll go you'll come down rather you know yeah there is three know a little bit uh further down more more more more yeah okay okay okay yeah I don't know how long I live but remember this as I've told you many years ago watch Russia there is three curtains remember this there is the Iron Curtain there is the bamboo curtain which is uh righted China and so on and the purple curtain you watch that curtain now here he's saying watch the purple curtain also so when the pope is just about to pass away keep watching something is going to happen there don't take your eyes off okay because your time is coming near yeah don't be see the whole the whole point of having the cloud coming of Christ is so that we pay attention to this message see the the cloud came with a message the cloud is not just another Cloud you know every day we have clouds here in Calgary it was not another Cloud not just another Cloud This Cloud came with a message which asks you specifically to do a certain thing if you believe in the cloud you will follow my Commandments you know that's what Jesus said you remember if you love me what will you do keep my Commandments yeah so if you identify that it was the cloud coming of Christ keep the Commandments when he says watch Russia watch the purple curtain you watch them the world is not watching they do not know what is happening they are waiting for a tariff War for this for that and then you know so many other things but you know the secret you know when there is a movement in the curtains something is fixing to happen so you better get ready like I said if you have got loved ones dear ones who are still not in the message this would be a very good time to get back to them and talk to them and you know brother bam said you know apply the token apply the token because now is the time to do it because later on you will not get a chance okay but before you apply the token for somebody else like you you know like they say In the Aeroplane put your mask first then you assist others make your own calling and election sure first yeah do that make sure that you understand where you're standing in the word and when you get that no devil can take it away from you that is your Revelation okay given personally to you right so when you know where you are standing that is a time when you can apply the token and like always the third pull has three folds first is preaching to the total lost I don't know who is the total lost but the scripture says preaching to the total lost which means there will be people who will reject the message okay there will be people so don't be surprised that is a part of the third pull the second fold manifestation of the spoken word now when I talk about manifestation of the spoken word I would like to draw your attention I still have some time I would like to draw your attention to a certain scripture once again or rather I will not open it in the Bible because we have well little time remaining I want to finish uh within the time so if you see scripture says um brother uh once again the seventh seal seventh seal para 390 it's okay we have time yeah so here brother bam talks about America he talks about the economy of America and he says how you know America is spending money which will be collected you know 40 years from now uh yeah we were looking at par 390 yeah yeah ising your uh no I think this is not that one coming of the Lord uh 390 yeah 390 to 392 it's okay keep it on let us read okay notice there is a whole earth is to be purged there will be such a thing that the moon stars and all nature will be purged you see what is it the Earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium the Millennium is coming up and see everything that's got any filth in it is to be purged during The Sixth Seal next parab brother now now do you notice the opening of this seventh seal yeah opening of the seventh seal is also a three-fold mystery one I have I will speak to you yeah one I have uh this one I have will speak to you and have spoken that is a mystery of the seven Thunders seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery will be right the coming of Christ because Christ said no one knew that he would return did you notice when the Jews asked him uh that no when we compared the scripture here Matthew 24 six seal seven seal was left out do you also know that you know these Seven Seals which were in Revelations uh chapter 6 you know were also in Matthew chapter 24 okay they were opened there also okay was and the seventh seal again like I said it was a silence it was left out why was there silence in heaven okay what usually happens in heaven there's a lot of noise what kind of noise worship okay so for about the space of half an hour there was silence why is there silence because the object of worship is on Earth you see the coming of the Lord that is why there is silence absolute silence now the devil cannot deduce anything out of this because there is silence nobody's speaking anything about it okay and it says that when we compare the scripture here only God himself know not even the angels no wonder it wasn't even written so there is no way that you know anybody can know you see the hashid nothing taken place Angels don't know it nobody knows when he is coming but there will be there'll be a seven voices of these Thunders that will reveal the great revelation of that time so believers who if we don't know and if we if it won't be know till that time see he doesn't say that it will not be known he's he's saying that it will not be known till that time you see that till that time so as soon as that happens we will all get to know we will all in the sense the people who are gathered here under the cloud okay yeah and and uh yeah I think that is it so now we have to go to First seal para 338 I got it this time this is the right one yeah this is about America see there is so much of stuff in this Bible you know it is absolutely until unless we get into it this is not a church game you know churchianity cannot save us coming to church every Sunday and then Wednesday and then going back and leading Our Lives no look at this now now oh now I believe I was talking to somebody here I might have been brother Robertson today or somebody I was talking on about this but not this there but just on the same thing I believed I preached on there not long back ago what will happen to this United States on this money situation C well we are now paying our deths on taxes that will be paid 40 years from today that is how far we are behind did you ever turn on K A iir up there or Lifeline or listen to it see from Washington why all are completely busted that's all okay so this was in 1963 America was already busted today their debt is at $ 36 trillion and even given the current situation their economy is growing less than the debt which means they will never ever ever come out of debt okay so if you're looking at a bright future by investing and making money and all those things I think you need to B it say something else okay now you go to brother uh 300 50 there's a way out this is the problem actually this is the problem you see the problem is America is going bust now it is written here but what is happening in our time right now why do you think Trump wants to make Canada the 51st state why because of the oil resources yeah because he knows that somewhere down the line they don't have the money why are they putting tariffs on other countries Trump very cleverly says that we are imposing tariff on other countries but in reality what is he doing he's raising the taxes on the people because China is not going to pay the Tariff it is the American Consumer who's going to pay the Tariff so he's calling the tax as a tariff and he it seems like the other country is getting punished no it is his own people who are going to pay the heightened tax increased tax the tariffs will go out of the pocket the people who are purchasing those Samsung televisions or whatever they are buying okay now you see the only thing that you can do in this situation is 350 there is only one thing that can happen that is to call in the currency and pay off the bonds which is to say change the currency okay what does it say it says change the currency all right now he says and we can't do it okay believe me America cannot do it but you and me can do it how do you change the currency see the problem is given here the solution to the problem is also here it is just that that the people outside of this message cannot implement it see that is the importance of being in the message the world is saying or they're feeling that you know the economy is going down it'll come up and this will happen that will happen and you know this will but the fact here is that until unless our currency is changed okay until unless our currency is changed we are going into the tribulation no doubt about it you know all our savings are going to be wiped off fiat currency is going to be like paper what is backing it actually nothing today yeah so if you are still you know thinking that I will make a big business and then I will uh do this and I will invest in this and I will invest that I am not against investing you should do it and you know it's a part of life but what I'm saying is that we in this room are a different category of people you see I read somewhere that you know if you have like you know a million dollars in Canada you are better than about 80% of the Canadians yeah because less than 80% of the Canadians have $1 million in their savings okay so that's a drastic thing so if you have that amount of money you are one of the Elites in the country yeah in the same way if you know this secret changing of the currency okay if you know how you can change your currency the devil cannot touch you now coming to this point okay now how do you change the currency what is the new currency going to be right interesting I'll tell you I I'll tell you that is the reason why I'm here you know when a preacher comes here and you know has to preach brother bam said that if you don't have the Holy Ghost you might as well not you know step in the pulpit and you understand when the god when the Lord has to use you okay he does not teach like pen and paper okay take your notes no you know what he does he takes you he makes you go through it you understand the troubles the pain the sorrow the everything you know you have to go through it and once you you see John the Baptist almost all 30 years he spent in Wilderness his only job was to introduce the Messiah what is the preparation 30 years yeah and 30 years in Wilderness he used to eat wild Grasshoppers and honey why because he had to recognize who the Messiah is and that is the preparation that went into that man and Jesus said this is the greatest of all not one Miracle but he was the greatest you see so that is why my brother my sister when I coming here and I'm talking to you I do not want you to miss the Rapture you've done a lot we we are just right about there okay just hold on just a little bit more okay and we will be home don't give up now you know the world is going to tribulation they are going to be lost you don't be a part of it okay now I will tell you how you can change your currency what is the new currency that you are going to use for that I'm not going to take the scripture because I hardly have 5 minutes but still forgive me if I cross a little bit I'm trying to keep myself within the time limit but how do you change your currency there was a time when Jesus was here okay and he met the Rich Young Ruler do you remember Rich Young Ruler or Young Rich ruler okay the Bible says about it he said oh Master what should I do to you know get eternal life and Jesus said very very simple sell everything that you have and follow me yeah sell everything that you have and just follow me come behind me you'll get eternal life before that he said a couple of other things also he said that you know you follow the Commandments you do this that and he said I've been doing that I still don't have eternal life I don't have the I don't not have the life that you have you know you have something special something different you know you speak and the dead raises up I don't have that so he said okay now you know what just doing the Commandments will not get get you eternal life yeah so when the Bible says we've had a lot of meetings on tithing and stuff so when the Bible says that uh we have to pay 10% of our income in TI okay and we do it we do it religiously okay now the point is after doing that are we still like Rich Young rulers I have been doing that since my childhood I've been paying my tithes but where is the life the life will come you see if I think it is zakus uh whose house Jesus went in and then you know he was like he opened his safe and he said that you know I have taken whatever I've taken was it zakus brother or yeah it was him right yeah so he said that you know whatever I have uh illegally have earned I'm giving four times of that okay now what and Jesus said that this day salvation has come in this house he was also a lost son of Abraham okay now what has happened what has transpired there zakus at that point in time he changed his currency that's right he took his faith out of the material money that he had okay and then he realized that you know what the complete Earth belongs to this man okay and I am air to him okay so I don't have to work for it I don't want I don't have to you know die for this my brother my sister once you realize that your currency is different you will be able to create money not make money you'll be able to create money what did Jesus do when they said when they came to him they said that you know where is the where is your tax he said Peter go catch a fish in the fish's mouth there will be a coin come bring it okay and he came there he brought the coin now uh Jesus says that okay whose face is on the coin it is Caesar's face so then Jesus said okay fine you do one thing you pay my tax and your tax also with this right so when I am telling you this see when we are talking about tithing okay please understand understand that 10% is what the law says okay you have to understand how did we come to this 10% or how do we come to the tithing Point itself in the first place if you see there is this uh King called Mali sedc okay Abraham went to rescue his nephew lot okay there were these Four Kings which overcame the five Kings and then you know they had a war and then you know this fellow went in there so Abraham was there he took 319 men with him okay and now he's going to war with people who have already won the war so the total cumulative number of Kings were nine four who had already overcome on the five and then you know so such a big Victorious Army he's going to fight and he's going there with 318 or 19 people okay when he reaches there Abraham knows impossible I cannot defeat these people how can I I have got you know 318 or 19 people who are like cooker cooks and bearers and you know stuff in my house I've got all of them to fight with this big Mighty Army okay now okay whatever they can hold hold and stuff but it's not possible brother and sister this is exactly our condition we say that we work hard we make money I pay 10% of the money that I have earned to God as TI on the contrary God gives you 90% of what he has given you you're keeping it you understand that you're not giving God 10% you are keeping 90% of what God gave you please understand that you see so the moment this connection of yours with money when it goes your currency changes okay then you will realize that you're no longer praying that God give me a bigger house God give me a bigger car God give me a bigger suit God give me this God give me that please help me I'm in dire situation I don't have you know sometimes you have to understand when you're born again you know when you get the Holy Ghost you are a prisoner of Christ like I said okay can you imagine you being put in jail for whatever reason you're in jail now and you're sitting there and you're praying to God God please get me out of here get me out of here I don't want to be here okay now contrast that with our brother Paul H not that the Paul and Silas in the Bible actually yeah they are they were beaten up with rods they were stripped they were beaten with rods okay and they were put in the jail cell and sitting there what are they doing exactly they are not saying God please why this is coming to me I am such a holy person I am only preaching and then you know I'm going to jail please get me out of jail no Paul knows sometimes the troubles that we have in our life is because there is exactly what God wants at that point in time so that he can manifest his might through US yeah so every time we are stuck it is not because we are stuck when Israel is coming out of Egypt you know the 2 million people coming out of Egypt they were walking and going and suddenly they come and they see Red Sea is this the is this the root that Moses chose for us there is sea in front and Pharaoh behind us what do we do Moses at least you should have seen Google Maps what is this now what do we do now there is no going back no going forward but that is they reached exactly the place where God wanted them to be Red Sea was a part of their Journey your troubles your problems are a part of your journey that will refine you once you do that you know Bible says David he killed a lion he killed a bear now he can kill anybody yeah golad is like a you know like a Barbie doll yeah because see goth has to still follow some rules of engagement bear has no rules of engagement Lions have no rules of engagement they see you and they just vacum and they eat you that's it but golat has got limitations you know he has to come with the stuff he has his this and he has his that and everything okay and you know he has rules that you know that he has to follow and you know he has limitations but these animals don't have a wild animals they don't have any limitations so for David when he saw him he's like you know this Barbie doll I can you know how is he challenging the armies of the Living God how can he do that yeah how can you do that not possible so your troubles at some point in time are preparing you for something bigger so now when You Face a trouble you don't pray to God to change God's mind yeah you pray to God that God changes your mind yeah so that you you know what to do in this situation yeah can you imagine Paul and Cena sitting there clapping and singing and doing all that you know and worship like let me tell you worship is a very very very very strong thing very Ultra I mean you know I have I I can give you an example I can tell you what happened once I was uh in India and I was working in a company in South India this was the franchising company that I was working with and uh uh this company had enormous expansion in the north and I was heading the company in the north so when I went to our head offices in the South uh I you know there are colleagues there and they're all you know like uh I won't say envious but yeah they're all like you know John we come here we sit from 8:00 in the morning till 910 we work and then we go home and now you know when at the end of the year when you calculate the leaves okay uh uh we don't have a single you know paid leave off left nothing left and you who's working in North you don't have a time to come you don't have a time to go you don't even come to office and look at you have got 36 Days leave and look at us we are logging from morning till evening and you know nothing left I was like brother what can I do I mean the the job is that so yeah so now this person who's already a little this thing now he was supposed to drop me to the airport once okay and I was supposed to catch a flight and he's taking me to the airport and I told him my brother uh you know I think we'll get late first you know I had to catch hold of him he was you know here and there and there I had a flight at 1:00 so around 10 you know 10:30 I'm searching for him and I'm looking for him and I can't find him and 11 11:30 or something I finally caught hold of him I like you know uh boss said that you're going to drop me and you know the books and stuff which I have to carry with me are with you so please let's go so he's like okay I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming and D D D D and it was almost you know 11:45 and now we in the car he was like okay fine come everything done 11:45 1:00 flight we have to be at least you know 2 hours before we had to reach the airport and I'm still in office at 11:45 and uh we're in the car and now this he's driving real slow and I'm like brother we're going to miss the flight he's like John you know what we have to take care of the rules and stuff we can't go more than 4050 that is the I said For Heaven's Sake we are in India we are not Dubai that that somebody is you know doing this like we let's go and he was like no no no John I have to be very careful I was like okay fine okay no problem no problem you I think you're right you know we have to follow the rules but at least can you do me one small favor and I asked him and he said of course what is it you want to stop and have tea I said no no no no no not that not that favor I have to get to the airport fast so you do one thing you drive it however you're driving you do one thing you put that you know you have got music system you put you know uh gospel song and you play in this car while we are going there he was like oh of course I can do that then he put songs there and I'm listening to the songs and I can't do anything but yeah I am also worshipping I'm in the car and I'm you know singing and I'm going there and we reach the airport at 1:00 and at the gate the person who sees your boarding pass in in India you can't you know only the person who's traveling can go inside and they check all your uh you know path and timing and everything and then only they left me you know go inside and he's like your flight is at 1:00 you're at the gate at 1:00 you're entering the airport at 1 how are you going to make it anyhow you please go in and see so I went inside and they said you know uh people coming from this flight please come uh to the counter I went to the counter and it so happened that the inbound flight was delayed by 2 hours the flight coming from Delhi to Kerala was delayed by 2 hours now I'm at the airport at the right time because the flight was delayed now this same flight has to go back so the inbound is 2 hours late so what they said is that sorry because it's a 1:00 flight now we'll have to leave at 3:00 and I'm sure that you know people have left home at 12: or the ones who reached on time must have left at 10: so you guys didn't have lunch so you know the airlines provided lunch at that point in time so I was I was like s yeah you know what I I think I'm going to get the flight now and plus I'm going to get lunch at the airport also so thanks you know good that we in so you have to understand that we are not looking at a god of past not even a god of 63 you know God is the same yesterday today and forever you know you just you know we just need to have the faith that you know our brothers back there in the Bible you know in those times had and you will see that God is always ever faithful there is no battle you cannot win without you know worshipping yeah the worst kind of situation you are in just take out time start worshiping you know what happens actually you know actually what happens when you start worshipping you know what happens we just saw why did the worship stop in heaven because the object of worship was not there so when you start worshipping what happens comes right here with you in the fury furnace you see they said we put three in how come fourth is also there with them yeah so you see you have the power to move God that is why I again and again tell you that people in the message in this church are Elite you have got simply you've got the power to do so you can create money you can create anything that you need to at that point in time but with the new birth comes the maturity to understand that am I going to use all this power to just create wealth Paul you know didn't do it he said this is waste useless I have to gather up wealth there amen yeah the more souls I bring into Christ that is where you know I am going to be that is my eternal gift yeah so that is when you see please don't misunderstand me uh okay there is one more uh instance I want to say this uh woman at uh with Alicia she was absolutely down and gone she had no money nothing there was a femine in the uh land and last piece of bread she had little bit dough she's like we'll make this me and my daughter will eat it and then we will die yeah have you all read about that yeah now El Elisha comes there and he says no wait it's not time for you to die first you do one thing whatever you have B and give me and she's like me and my child okay at Thy word you said it okay fine she gave everything that she had okay and when she did that now you have to understand her faith is not in that bread or in that dough okay her currency has changed now she believes in the word which came through the prophet okay now she knows that I am standing on a different ground yeah I no longer bound to this currency okay I'm no longer bound to this food yeah this is not going to sustain me yeah so he doesn't want food from you you know God he's the owner of the universe why does he need your money you know I am I give 10% and then I go and ask what did you do with the 10% you know what is the statements what you know how this thing happened how that happened you know this that and all and okay every church is Sovereign you know we do all that but you know but in our minds you see a thinking man's filter the Holy Ghost will tell us that where we are actually standing you see the money that we give to Christ is his money alt together right and when we give it to him he multiplies and give it gives it back to us sometimes not just in cash you know if you read the story of sister hatti ride she makes $200 she gave 20 and then you know her two sons got eternal life how much can you value that in money yeah money today we have tomorrow we might not have tomorrow we might have lots so it keeps growing and you know reducing and coming and going but eternal life is forever yeah and that is where we are standing today that is why the changing of our currency is very very important without that there is no going forward the message has come in so that we know see the poor Young Rich ruler could not do it because he had too much wealth he could not you know he could not cut off from that wealth do you think God would really have taken his wealth and you know made him a whatever no look at Paul we speak about Rich Young Ruler but does anybody know his name but do we know Paul messenger of the first church age almost 2,000 years back still we know him yeah you see the difference when you cut yourself from that currency from that money where do you reach the name of Paul has become immortal not only now you know even 10 Generations from now if there was time that you know Rapture delays people still will know Paul how about the Rich Young Ruler what has he gained what did he on at the end of the day you know you see if you read the scriptures he was in Hell ended up there no salvation no nothing not even money what what could he do with that money so that is why we have to understand that when we pay our tithes okay we are meeting with maled we are not giving it to the pastor we are not giving it to the church we are not helping the pastor we are not helping the church we are not helping anybody simply because we can't even help ourselves what am I going to help anybody else you see I am only working on my salvation I whatever I have has been given by God I acknowledge that yes sir right and my wealth is is not what I have earned here is not my lands my houses my you know cars and this is all perishable things that is why the Bible says it is impossible to please God without faith yeah so unless and until your currency changes you will you know you cannot please God secondly the economy is going to go down any which ways you run around in any direction you know you cannot nobody can save the economy it is gone it is thus sayth the Lord Seven seal we read it it's gone so I have a disclaimer here now I am not asking you to sell everything that you have and donate and do all that no that is not what I'm saying and especially the children like you know I said also that you know you become a prisoner of Christ when you receive the Holy Ghost now I'm not saying that you know you become the prisoner of Christ from tomorrow words you're not going to school you're not doing your work you're not going to you know do all those things no that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is very clear I want to reemphasize on that that you know like for example we have got Isaac here or Benjamin here okay now they are schoolgoing kids now when they get the Holy Ghost okay when they go to their school that is the only percentage of scripture the people in that school the principals teachers students will ever get to interact with the word right so it is important that I do my daily work God gives me a Target my car breaks down I go I meet a mechanic who's going to fix it and uh you know and he helps me and you know he does all the things this is the only time that mechanic has an opportunity to interact with the word in flesh so this is not about you you cannot say I am saved so now I'm putting my blanket on and I'm just not going to do anything because I'm saved I am I am in rest Holy Ghost gives you rest from your works but then you do the works of Christ you're not resting like you know resting yeah children you have to study you have to go to school you have to do all your responsibilities that you are doing but while you're doing that make sure and understand that you are the living Epistles of Christ when you find your position in Christ okay that scripture is living inside of you now you don't have to go and you know take out the Bible on the street and scream like you know this is uh you know Isaiah chapter 38 says this says this no you are Isaiah 38 standing there you are the scripture for the age word in flesh yes and when you go anywhere wherever you have the complete authority of Heaven behind you so there will be people who will help you there will be people who trouble you but they're not doing it to you they are doing it to the word so on the white Throne judgment you're not just sitting there nothing to do you have all these people you have interacted with yeah you're not sitting there and watching like you know okay H yeah yeah you are sitting there to judge these people give them eternal life or sorry yeah because the main thing is you know life is in identifying Abraham you have to understand when whatever shape form color what however God comes in front of Abraham he will always identify him lot could not do it Abraham saw that you know three people coming he did not go and say my lords he said my Lord why did he say my Lord because he had already met him during that battle yeah he had already met him there so now he knows that the one who changed my name is the this is the one you change your form and come any form you come in I will definitely get you you see and that is why Jesus said he was also a child of Abraham why because Abraham could identify Christ and the children of Abraham will also identify Christ you see when brother bar you know when he preaching here quite often it happens that you know like I did today exceeded the time you know he says that you know brothers sisters whoever wants to go can go we won't feel bad you have the time you know you you can do that uh it's okay we understand you have problems when you when you hear that you know you you just get to know that you know what this is Elijah he is telling uh Elisha you T here let me go he's like no no no no no no I am not going to let you go I am going to be right here I'm going to be right here this is my place you see so that's why you have to understand that you know the quality of God is I could couldn't read it but the seventh seal has got three fold on it the first fold you if you can read CMO that is Christ The Mystery of God revealed the message okay three folds of the seven seal first is whatever was in God was poured into Christ second whatever was in Christ was poured into the bride okay now whatever now the third part is whatever I wouldn't say whatever is in the bride but it is the restoration of the earth okay that is the third fold that is the third reason for the seven seal coming of the Lord okay now in a passing reference quickly I will say that you have to when you see when you read the Bible whatever happens to the Earth happens to our flesh yeah you understand that 70% of the Earth is water 70% of our body is yeah right and 30% is the flesh part or the solid part okay that is how the Earth is now you have to understand the coming of the Lord did happen on 208th February 1963 okay the mighty angel came down one foot on sea one foot on land okay that was the coming of the Lord but you also have to understand that God deals with Jews as a nation but God deals with Gentiles as individuals so that Mighty Angel has to come down in this flesh also yeah you see whatever minerals you find in the earth you have got same things in your body magnesium potassium iron you know I don't know all those but yeah all everything is in your flesh as well yeah in the new heavens and new earth you will see that there is no ocean yeah there is no Ocean or no Seas I I didn't find any Seas yeah when we get into a theophany there will be no flesh and blood and all in that okay so whatever happens in the Bible whatever happens to this earth renovation of the earth and all that you know happens to our body first so it's kind of a parable when God said in the Garden of Eden Adam because of you the Earth is cursed are this flesh was taken out of this Earth and thorns and thistles will the earth bring forth you know sickness and problems in our flesh yeah this will go away when that will go away yeah so that is the reason why the third fold of the seven seal is waiting that is the uh the nature is yearning for the coming of the sons of God I don't remember the exact scripture does anybody remember manifestation of the yeah exactly okay so that is why the nature is groaning yeah groaning is the right word it's groaning for the Manifest ations of the sons of God why because when our body gets redeemed the Earth is also going to get redeemed yeah because our because of our fault the Earth got all these problems yeah so uh yeah just 2 minutes more so now I hope we have covered many things time was very short I experienc by about 20 minutes but still I want to end with one thing that I want to say my brother my sister don't lose this opportunity right you know this is one important time that you are living in prophets like Daniel wanted to be here today they wanted to see this they were not given this opportunity it is only us that has been given this opportunity so please make maximum use of it and we've already reached the end just a little bit more just a little bit more push on push on yeah and for some get back in line keep back in line know that the Lord is here yes yeah he wants to speak to you you know like I said it is not easy all you need to do is just believe change your currency rapturing faith is lying right in front of you yeah it's lying right in front of you go ahead receive the Holy Ghost and if you have the Holy Ghost go for the refilling ask God again and again yeah and although I just want to end with one small example of what happened with me one time and I'm going to close with that only to know you know the position that we are in what happened was once I was in once again South India I was going to uh Delhi and I was uh supposed to catch a train now this in Delhi uh in the church I was doing the live streaming and all those things so uh this was watch Night Service 31st December in the night we have Holy Communion and we have this watch Night Service so I had to be there for the watch Night Service but incidentally I was very far away from Delhi so uh I was trying to catch a train from Gujarat I had come all the way there now when I was in Ahmedabad that is the capital of Gujarat one city uh I got the train I I I got the train but then uh the ticket examiner there I had to pay for the ticket and he said that you know usually in in India we pay with you know tap thing you know PTM and all so we don't usually use cash I got in the Train the TT said the the person who issues the ticket said that you know I cannot take uh this thing from you I need cash I said I don't have cash but I have to get this train because if I miss this train I will the journey is like 12 hours You by train so I will not be able to make it for the meeting tomorrow so I cannot miss this train by any cost at any cost so he said you know you still have time why don't you go to the gate and get there's a ATM there withdraw money and come back and you know get it I was like okay fine I'll do that I went to the gate of the Railway Station to get the uh money from the ATM I got the money from the ATM and I came back I Vis at the station at the platform and the train had started moving I started running and the train you will see it's a huge you know very very big train you know even if it moves like this you don't realize that it is so fast because it's such a huge thing you know it's got like 20 Bogies on it or something like that and it is going at maybe 10 or 15 km/ hour maximum 20 I'm I'm looking at it it is right here where this chair is I thought I can just get in you know I I'm running I'm running I'm running I'm running really fast I am not able to even come close to it but the train is still at the same speed I'm trying to get get onto it no I could not and incidentally the last bogie of the train has got x on it okay so that the station Master can know that you know all the Bogies have made it and this is the last one so they have a x you know drawn on it this x is right in front of my eyes I am trying to get on it I'm trying to reach there I'm trying to go there you see yeah that is a picture you see and I'm not able to get it that X is right here it is within the hands reach but I'm not able to reach it and I'm running and I'm running and I'm running and every part of my body is just I have to get that train because if I miss that train I miss the you know uh the watch Night Service I miss Holy Communion on the first I miss everything I cannot let this train go this train has to you know I have to get on that train and the train is not stopping and I'm running running running really hard I'm running I can't breathe I'm I'm still running I'm not stopping and finally I realized that you know I'm not going to get it so incidentally this is the first time I was at this station and I saw that this platform is right next to the road so I just quickly ran uh you know the train is going like this I went down you know from the platform and there was a autoa standing there now I I jumped into the auto and I said you know come on follow the train follow the train he he said this is auto man you you you can't you can't catch a train with this I said today your auto can fly you just go don't stop just go go go go go and he was like okay fine where do I go I said follow the train he said the train is going to another city we cannot go in this to another city I said wherever it is going you just go and you know he started driving and but see if you have a picture of the autoa in that I I had Tred to take it okay and the and it will not go because it's it's just a Traw you know it is just a you know like a water pump you attach to a cycle that is the kind of energy that you know thing has but I was like you know this train cannot I have to catch this train and I have to be there there is no way this train can go whatever happens I will get and I you know this Auto is going and it is not reaching anywhere but then suddenly what happened this train left the platform it cleared the platform and it changed a couple of tracks around say five six tracks on the other end the train is going to turn that side now my auto is going this side so and suddenly there the train stopped and I'm like you know okay fine I I saw the train stop I took the money I threw it you know in the auto I couldn't have I I couldn't say bye or anything to the auto guy I just jumped out leaped out ran and got into the train and when I got into the Train the train started moving you know so that is what I'm saying you have the power of Creation in you the reason why I am telling you about tie today I told you I had to go to India get some you know Insight on this and come back when you talk about tithing Bible says that Levi he paid his tith in Abraham okay so when you are operating the third pool please understand you are not doing it because you are doing it today you you are doing it because you did it when the squirrels were created and even before that when the Lord said let there be light you were inside of him when I say you can make money you can create that power of creation is always inside of you you just have to have the faith use your faith no sickness can come to you demons will flee from you they will see you from a distance and they'll say oh my God yeah demons you to understand this is the time that's why I'm saying don't miss the train don't do whatever you can get on it get on it get on it you cannot afford to lose it this is your chance you know people outside of this room don't even know about all these things they have no clue what kind of Destruction is going to come on them they have absolutely no idea where they're going to end up but you are the select few you have made it this far please please believe believe believe in this word this is not just a book this book has come to give you eternal life this is your part this message has opened this book without the message there is nothing we can do now as I'm closing I will invite our brothers you know the musicians and I would uh invite brother Don if you can say the final prayer and we'll end there but my brothers and sisters please remember this is your time don't lose it this chance will never come back you are in a very very blessed situation don't lose this
