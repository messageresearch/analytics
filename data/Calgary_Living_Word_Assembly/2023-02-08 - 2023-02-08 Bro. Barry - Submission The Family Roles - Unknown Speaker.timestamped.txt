[33:38] knowing that there's only one way that
[33:40] we could ever do that Lord

[36:57] we truly heard from heaven we truly
[36:59] heard from God we didn't just gather
[37:01] together as an assembly of people but we
[37:04] gathered together in the presence of the
[37:06] most high God
[37:08] oh Father we love you and we thank you
[37:10] we just ask all these things now in the
[37:13] name above every name the Lord Jesus
[37:15] Christ
[37:16] amen
[37:18] thank you musicians tonight
[37:21] do you have your Bibles
[37:23] I would just like to go back to
[37:24] Ephesians chapter five
[37:30] Ephesians chapter 5.
[37:36] and uh
[37:37] I hope it's not getting to be old
[37:41] and boring
[37:51] some might say we've heard it and heard
[37:54] it and heard it
[37:57] but uh
[37:59] I don't think it'll ever get old
[38:02] and the more it becomes real to us
[38:06] it'll never get boring
[38:09] Ephesians chapter five
[38:12] just want to read
[38:14] two scriptures verse 21 and 22 tonight
[38:21] submitting yourselves one to another in
[38:23] the fear of God
[38:26] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[38:29] husbands
[38:30] as unto the Lord
[38:35] it's amazing how I don't have a cough
[38:36] until I stand right here
[38:38] my let's just bow in prayer one more
[38:41] time
[38:42] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[38:44] goodness to us Lord
[38:45] thank you for your word Lord Jesus
[38:48] we know that it will never become old or
[38:50] boring to us Lord we pray that father
[38:53] every time we read it that you would
[38:55] just anoint our eyes father that you
[38:58] would anoint our hearts Lord Jesus
[38:59] father that you would just take those
[39:01] ears that have the ability to hear what
[39:04] the spirit saith unto the church father
[39:07] and just Lord Jesus speak to us once
[39:10] again through those years father we love
[39:12] you and we thank you we ask that you
[39:14] would break this bread of life to us
[39:16] fresh once again in Jesus Christ's name
[39:18] we pray amen
[39:21] amen God bless you tonight you may be
[39:23] seated
[39:27] I think it's amazing
[39:30] I
[39:32] just want to talk tonight about
[39:33] submitting
[39:35] I want to talk about headship
[39:38] and how important it is to be able to do
[39:40] that
[39:41] and I really want to emphasize Ephesians
[39:44] 5 verse 21.
[39:46] because we can really
[39:48] um
[39:49] I've said it before but I'll say it
[39:50] again we can really emphasize and and
[39:53] stick on one thing and say that you know
[39:55] it's the wife's responsibility to fully
[39:57] submit and surrender her will to her
[40:00] husband which it is
[40:01] but we can make that the doctrine when
[40:04] that's not entirely it there's a balance
[40:07] in the word I remember a long time ago
[40:10] we talked about there being a way a
[40:12] highway but there's also a way and that
[40:14] way is of Holiness and the only way
[40:17] we're going to do that is to have the
[40:19] anointing of the word the anointing of
[40:21] the Lord the Holy Ghost in our lives and
[40:23] this world is not set up in such a way
[40:26] where we are supposed to submit
[40:28] ourselves submit our will surrender our
[40:31] will to a headship we are in fact
[40:34] encouraged to be independent from a very
[40:37] early age to be able to make the choice
[40:39] and in fact that choice is slowly being
[40:42] taken away from us in the public school
[40:44] systems all over North America and even
[40:46] in the world we can become criminals for
[40:49] telling our children that no you don't
[40:51] have a choice no you cannot choose God
[40:54] created you to be either a man or to be
[40:57] a woman and it's not a choice to decide
[41:00] whether you want to be one or the other
[41:01] other but you know what from a child
[41:05] young young ages now the world is
[41:08] setting things in order so that there's
[41:11] no choice there's no submission your
[41:14] choice is the choice
[41:16] it's so opposite to the word because
[41:18] this verse 21 says submitting yourselves
[41:21] one to another
[41:22] in the fear of the Lord
[41:28] I pray for me
[41:32] maybe I should talk more at home or
[41:34] something I don't understand this
[41:36] it's bizarre
[41:38] we had conversation all day today
[41:41] and I wasn't coughing
[41:44] I love it
[41:46] devil doesn't like this
[41:48] supposed to submit ourselves one to
[41:50] another
[41:51] in the fear of God
[41:53] first
[41:55] then wives submit yourselves unto your
[41:57] own husbands is unto the Lord and we're
[42:00] going to talk about that naturally
[42:01] tonight and how important it is for a
[42:03] wife to submit herself unto her husband
[42:05] that is truly the scripture and that is
[42:08] truly where the blessing lies for the
[42:09] wife
[42:10] and and being able to do that but also
[42:13] from the spiritual context if we call
[42:15] ourselves the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[42:17] really we ought to submit ourselves unto
[42:19] the Lord
[42:21] and and we'll get into that too there's
[42:22] scriptures after scripture that talks
[42:25] about submitting yourself unto the Lord
[42:27] but if wives are supposed to submit
[42:29] themselves unto their own husbands as
[42:31] unto the Lord
[42:33] what is the husband supposed to do as
[42:35] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[42:37] I just think we've been talking about it
[42:39] and I can't get away from the thought
[42:40] that all God was he poured into Christ
[42:42] and all Christ was he poured into the
[42:44] church or into the bride and so what
[42:47] ought we to do as husbands we ought to
[42:49] pour all that we are into our families
[42:52] into our bride and then all of the wife
[42:56] ought to pour all that she is into her
[42:58] family as well into the position that
[43:00] she owns in in the role as well and then
[43:02] same with the children children have a
[43:05] role to play children ought to take that
[43:07] same example and pour all that they are
[43:10] into the family roles and and just see
[43:13] what God will do if we can actually push
[43:15] ourselves into the position of
[43:17] submitting ourselves one to another in
[43:20] the fear of God recognizing that God is
[43:23] the one that we're looking at we're not
[43:25] necessarily looking at our our family
[43:27] even though we are we're not necessarily
[43:28] looking at our husband or our wife we're
[43:30] looking to God because he is the author
[43:33] and the finisher of our faith he is the
[43:35] one that's watching us we we know the
[43:37] word says that he has set up Watchers in
[43:40] the world and I would say this way
[43:42] they're angels Angels amongst us people
[43:46] witnessing us I remember there was a
[43:48] time in my life where I think you know
[43:50] maybe I'm crazy but I I am in my own way
[43:52] I think we all are in our own way but
[43:54] maybe some like me more than others but
[43:57] there was a time in my life where
[43:59] somebody dropped some money in my store
[44:02] they dropped some money in my store I
[44:04] think it was a 20 bill and it was an
[44:07] accident I think I don't know maybe it
[44:10] was a test but they dropped the money
[44:12] and I I was a complete unbeliever at the
[44:15] time I believe I still had a little bit
[44:17] of faith maybe from when I was a kid
[44:18] that there was a god somewhere somehow
[44:20] but he dropped some money on the floor
[44:21] and I thought bonus he walked out of the
[44:24] store he was gone down the mall and and
[44:26] I thought there's lunch and coffee what
[44:28] a nice guy I was very nice of him so I
[44:30] went and I picked it up and I put it in
[44:32] my pocket and I went back to work
[44:34] an hour and a half later two hours later
[44:36] the same guy came back in and said you
[44:38] know did I drop anything in here and and
[44:41] what did I say to him I said no no
[44:44] he didn't
[44:45] I don't know did you I don't know I
[44:47] didn't see anything and he said you sure
[44:48] you sure I didn't
[44:50] you know was that was that a normal
[44:52] human was that a man sure it was but
[44:55] what was that that was a test for me and
[44:58] even now I can look at that and think
[44:59] you know by rights I'm condemned by that
[45:02] if I saw that man again today I'd give
[45:04] him 50 bucks I'd give him 100 bucks
[45:05] right and say truly I did that and I'm
[45:08] sorry but I don't know where he's at
[45:09] there's no way that I can fix that but
[45:11] what my point is is the word of God says
[45:14] that we entertain angels unawares we
[45:16] don't know when we entertain other
[45:19] beings
[45:21] so
[45:22] how does that tie in
[45:25] when we're not submitting ourselves it
[45:27] can be quite apparent
[45:30] can't it
[45:31] and you know there's so many different
[45:33] levels of submission that we can get
[45:35] into but
[45:36] um last week we talked about headship
[45:39] and I think it's such an important
[45:41] discussion
[45:43] that we really have to talk about there
[45:46] has to be willingness to submit
[45:47] ourselves to a headship and and every
[45:50] one of us in the fear of God
[45:53] submitting yourselves one to another in
[45:55] the fear of God we all have got to be
[45:58] led we we cannot live in this world and
[46:00] not be led we come into the world being
[46:02] led and we go out of the world being led
[46:04] brother Branham talks about that but in
[46:05] between we're always led the word of God
[46:07] says to submit yourselves to governments
[46:09] to to rulers over you to to spiritual
[46:13] leadership to family members husbands
[46:17] wives submit yourselves to your husbands
[46:20] but you know this isn't something that's
[46:21] really new to us we're we're very
[46:23] familiar with this and I know maybe it
[46:25] can seem that way but tonight I just
[46:27] want to just do maybe a little bit of a
[46:29] refresher for kind of where we we were
[46:31] with it in the beginning
[46:33] it's such an important topic to remember
[46:37] we have to be willing to be led if we
[46:39] can't be led
[46:41] then how are we ever going to get to
[46:42] heaven
[46:43] because Christ is the one that actually
[46:46] came and gave his life for us he came
[46:48] and led us to the father
[46:52] he's the one that gave us that and then
[46:54] you know we can just fast forward to our
[46:57] our time we talked about it before I
[46:58] think it was on Sunday about how there's
[47:00] prophets that come into the world and
[47:01] how prophets they they utter the words
[47:03] of God and they have prophecy and it
[47:06] might take a day it might take a week it
[47:08] might take a century but that word will
[47:11] always come to pass that word will never
[47:13] ever fall short
[47:17] but how we have in our day had a
[47:21] visitation of an Angel messenger
[47:24] and that word has come through this man
[47:27] and people can choose to submit
[47:29] themselves to that leadership or they
[47:32] can say oh it's just a man
[47:34] it's just just some guy from Kentucky
[47:36] and you know he was a great man of God
[47:38] even if you look it up in Wikipedia or
[47:40] or online Google a great man of God he
[47:42] had a tremendous Healing Ministry but
[47:45] you know he went off the rails when he
[47:46] started to say I am my father are one
[47:48] right when when something happened on
[47:50] Sunset mountain when the seals were open
[47:52] nobody else had ever had the seals open
[47:55] nobody ever clearly declared
[48:00] that the seals were completely open
[48:02] until this man and when this man did it
[48:05] that's when the world stepped back and
[48:07] said oh no no no you know what we we
[48:09] love the fact that you heal people we
[48:11] love the fact that you're you're so kind
[48:13] and compassionate you can discern and
[48:15] you can help people you're good and kind
[48:16] to people the the the man of godness is
[48:20] tremendous in you but you know when you
[48:22] go and make yourself God that's that's
[48:23] when we have to draw the line that's
[48:25] where we're going to pick up stones and
[48:26] stone you it was the same thing with
[48:28] Jesus when he came
[48:30] it's just a man we know your parents
[48:33] Joseph and
[48:36] Joseph and Mary
[48:38] we know your aunts we know your uncles
[48:40] we we know who you were before this
[48:43] great ministry how could you be that guy
[48:45] we have got to be willing
[48:48] to understand the word of God and follow
[48:50] it
[48:51] but this goes back to Genesis chapter 3
[48:53] talking about the feminine the church
[48:55] the feminine the wife tonight in Genesis
[48:58] chapter 3 verse 16 unto the woman after
[49:01] everything happened in the garden very
[49:03] familiar scripture onto the woman he
[49:05] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[49:07] and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt
[49:10] bring forth children
[49:11] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[49:15] and he shall rule
[49:18] over thee
[49:19] those are searing words for today
[49:23] that that that that right there sums it
[49:26] up for the Christian Life
[49:29] but the world today would say that's
[49:31] terribly wrong that's terribly
[49:34] inappropriate that might even be hate
[49:37] speech to say that a husband should rule
[49:41] over his wife but you know just like
[49:43] there's been many false prophets that
[49:45] have gone out in the world there's been
[49:47] many false prophets that have gone out
[49:48] and manipulated the word of God for
[49:50] whatever purpose usually for gain
[49:53] usually for their own purpose we know
[49:55] it's the act of Satan that gets in just
[49:57] because there's false prophets doesn't
[49:59] mean there's not true
[50:01] just like there's husbands that have
[50:04] behaved misbehaved I'll say
[50:06] inappropriately and mistreated their
[50:09] wives it doesn't mean that there isn't
[50:11] husbands that recognize that she is part
[50:14] of him and his Queen and treats her with
[50:18] utmost respect according to the word of
[50:20] God
[50:21] doesn't mean that there isn't true
[50:23] husbands out there like that the word of
[50:25] God has never once said to mistreat a
[50:27] woman never
[50:29] never it's a false representation of a
[50:32] human being on Earth that does that and
[50:34] that's why it became such a fear for
[50:37] females
[50:38] and and that's why it is today even
[50:40] tonight
[50:41] but we know in Genesis 3 24 just going
[50:44] forwards here see so he drove the man
[50:46] and placed at the east of the Garden
[50:48] Eden cherubims and a flaming sword to
[50:53] turn every way to keep the way of the
[50:56] Tree of Life they were banished from the
[50:59] garden there because of their sin
[51:01] because of the Fall because Adam chose
[51:03] to follow the leadership of his wife
[51:06] instead of following the right
[51:08] leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:10] instead of submitting himself to the
[51:13] word of God for his day he chose another
[51:16] Avenue and it caused the fall we know
[51:19] that he wasn't deceived he chose that
[51:21] direction but the woman was deceived
[51:24] and if we take that and apply that to
[51:26] the church look at how easily we will be
[51:29] deceived we know we've said it so many
[51:30] times that it would be so close it would
[51:32] deceive the very elected if it were
[51:35] possible
[51:36] who was the very elected tonight
[51:38] the bride
[51:40] the female the feminine so close that
[51:43] she would be deceived if it were
[51:45] possible but it's not possible how is it
[51:47] not possible only by the Holy Ghost
[51:50] outside of the Holy Ghost in your life
[51:52] brothers and sisters you'll be deceived
[51:54] you'll follow some other leadership
[51:55] there will be some other thing that will
[51:57] take you and just be off just a little
[51:59] bit today it'll just be so close it'll
[52:01] just be a little bit today but 10 years
[52:04] down the road it's going to be 10 miles
[52:05] off the course
[52:07] right now as we walk we sow seeds and it
[52:10] might not seem like a big deal today to
[52:12] stay home from church with our kids we
[52:15] don't have to go to church on a
[52:16] Wednesday night you don't
[52:18] but your kids 10 years from now are
[52:20] going to say remember we didn't go to
[52:21] church on Wednesday night it wasn't
[52:23] important we could just press play and
[52:24] listen to a tape
[52:27] and then what
[52:30] we open doors that we can't close and we
[52:32] start to behave in ways that are outside
[52:34] of the leadership of the word for our
[52:35] day we have to follow the leadership of
[52:38] the word
[52:40] but I just think it's so beautiful that
[52:42] he drove them out of the garden he he
[52:44] gave them no more access to that tree of
[52:47] life but we have been given Total Access
[52:50] to that tree of life if we don't
[52:52] actually go back to that Garden of Eden
[52:55] experience ourselves through the baptism
[52:57] of the Holy Ghost it's death to us to
[53:00] them if they would have gone to it it
[53:02] would have been death to them at that
[53:04] time today to not do it is death
[53:07] brother Branham talks about headship in
[53:10] Christ The Mystery of God revealed in so
[53:12] many ways if you ever want to listen to
[53:14] it or or just look it up he says it over
[53:17] and over and over again in Christ is the
[53:19] mystery of God revealed I'm just going
[53:21] to read a few tonight for for time's
[53:24] sake and and just sort of weave in and
[53:25] out here but how important it is to
[53:28] understand headship that we have got to
[53:30] be willing to be led you know Cain was
[53:33] not willing to be led Cain was a
[53:35] Believer brother Branham said Cain
[53:37] worship just like Abel they both were
[53:40] trained by their parents they both
[53:42] probably went to a message Church they
[53:44] were raised up right but there was
[53:46] something enable and something not in
[53:49] Cain Cain was not able to follow the
[53:53] leadership of the Lord he wasn't able to
[53:55] submit to the word of God
[53:58] and we know that was the difference
[53:59] between the two of them they both were
[54:01] sincere they both were Believers brother
[54:03] Branham said can you believe it Cain was
[54:05] a believer
[54:07] my goodness
[54:08] but yet when God came and brought him
[54:10] correction God came and spoke to him
[54:13] personally
[54:15] like your brother
[54:17] it was that Pride that was in him and
[54:19] that's what holds people back today from
[54:21] being able to be led and you know even
[54:23] from having a pastor or even from having
[54:26] a headship in the home when there's
[54:28] something inside of a wife that just
[54:30] doesn't want to listen to their husband
[54:31] there's something in there that's not
[54:33] right
[54:34] and you know that's not to say that that
[54:36] person isn't saved or that person isn't
[54:38] truly a believer
[54:40] it's just that they haven't come to the
[54:42] place of maturity yet in their lives
[54:44] same thing with a husband if a husband
[54:46] isn't following the Lord all the way
[54:48] it's not necessarily because he's lost
[54:51] or because he's not saved maybe he just
[54:53] hasn't spent enough time in prayer
[54:55] recently maybe he just hasn't done the
[54:57] right things hasn't read the Bible
[54:58] enough maybe he is just on his journey
[55:02] and not fully mature yet that's why we
[55:04] say it and we'll say it and say it and
[55:06] say it especially for those people who
[55:08] might be looking to get married know
[55:10] that you have the Holy Ghost know that
[55:13] your spouse potential has the Holy Ghost
[55:15] don't wait don't guess don't think
[55:17] they're going to get it down the road
[55:18] because if they don't have it when you
[55:20] get buried my goodness they might drag
[55:23] you down
[55:26] I've heard it worded this way
[55:29] to actually get married to the wrong
[55:31] person on earth is Hell on Earth
[55:35] that is a terrible situation brothers
[55:38] and sisters because you can't undo it
[55:40] brother Branham says it when you marry a
[55:42] person it doesn't matter whether she
[55:44] leaves you or whether you leave her
[55:45] you're married till you die
[55:52] can't have any other head it's got
[55:53] to be one it's got to be the lord it's
[55:55] got to be the Holy Ghost that's the only
[55:57] way that we can be led in this life and
[55:59] it's absolutely contrary to all of this
[56:02] world's teaching all of it the critical
[56:04] thinking that's taught even from the
[56:06] from the youth you can choose how you
[56:09] want to behave you can choose how you
[56:11] want to identify that's fine
[56:13] well it's not
[56:15] it's not according to the word
[56:18] brother Adam in Christ the mystery he
[56:20] says now you see the seals when he was
[56:22] in his meditorial work back there
[56:25] redeeming
[56:28] but someday he comes forth to get this
[56:31] book that he's redeemed
[56:36] I don't understand it excuse me
[56:37] and all that's in this book would be him
[56:42] I just was reading this and I was just
[56:45] stunned by that all that's in this book
[56:47] would be him
[56:51] for that's the believer
[56:53] the words in the book
[56:56] and the word is him
[57:01] in Ephesians 5 he says it
[57:04] the twain shall be won this is the
[57:06] mystery that I speak to you about Christ
[57:08] in the church
[57:10] that's the mystery Christ The Mystery of
[57:13] God revealed
[57:15] he says and and all that's in the book
[57:17] would be him for that's the believer the
[57:19] words in the book and the word is him
[57:21] and all that's in it he come forth for
[57:25] this book of redemption whose names are
[57:28] written on the book before the
[57:30] foundation of the world
[57:32] when he was slain as a lamb
[57:35] and here he is today in his word
[57:40] I want to say it tonight here he is
[57:42] tonight in his word when we read these
[57:45] quotes we can look back and say well
[57:47] that was 1963 brother Barry yeah it was
[57:49] but he is the same yesterday today and
[57:52] forever he is here tonight when we say
[57:54] that today we mean tonight
[57:57] he is today in his word manifesting the
[58:01] same thing he did there
[58:03] she can't recognize another headship no
[58:06] sir
[58:07] there's no Bishop no nothing
[58:10] she recognizes one headship that's
[58:12] Christ and Christ is the word
[58:16] he says oh my woo I love that yes
[58:19] um yes sir he's enthused by that and and
[58:22] I just think it's so beautiful to take
[58:24] this and just sort of unpack it a little
[58:26] bit and think about it how she is him
[58:29] he is the word but she is him also the
[58:32] twain are one so she will only recognize
[58:36] one headship and that one headship is
[58:39] him his word and what does his word say
[58:42] about submitting and falling under the
[58:45] leadership it says submit yourselves one
[58:48] to another in the fear of God we read
[58:49] that scripture to start with tonight
[58:51] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[58:53] husbands that's what that's what the
[58:56] word of God says it's not conditional we
[58:58] talked about this we're having a
[58:59] conversation today about it Lisa myself
[59:01] you know what it's not conditional I
[59:04] just about fell off my chair when I
[59:05] heard brother Ken teach that it's not a
[59:07] conditional thing if the husband isn't
[59:09] in his position that doesn't give the
[59:10] rule the wife license to act out and say
[59:13] well my husband's not behaving right so
[59:15] I can just do what I want to do nope if
[59:17] this if the wife wants to see success if
[59:19] she wants to see her husband get
[59:21] corrected the best thing she can do is
[59:23] remain in her position and say Lord I'm
[59:26] in my position and I believe your word
[59:28] with all my heart and I expect fact that
[59:30] you'll come on the scene and deal with
[59:31] the situation and you know what God will
[59:33] if he is a Son of God he truly will
[59:39] and I personally believe this even if
[59:41] he's not a son of God
[59:42] will still come on the scene
[59:45] God will still come on the scene
[59:50] here he is today in his word manifesting
[59:52] the same thing he did there
[59:55] we can look back and say well brother
[59:57] Barry we're not talking about signs
[59:59] wonders and miracles you know we can
[1:00:00] pray for this sick and they'll be healed
[1:00:02] and we'll have prayer lines and all
[1:00:04] these different things will happen and
[1:00:05] we'll see God answer our prayers the way
[1:00:06] that we want to see them answer that's
[1:00:08] all he's talking about here
[1:00:10] I know it's dangerous ground to say that
[1:00:12] that's not what the prophet's saying but
[1:00:14] I personally believe that that's my view
[1:00:15] that's not what he's saying what he's
[1:00:17] saying is you're able to stay with the
[1:00:19] word that is what he's saying here he is
[1:00:22] today in his word manifesting the same
[1:00:24] thing he did there she can't recognize
[1:00:26] another headship no sure no sir there's
[1:00:29] no Bishop no nothing she recognizes one
[1:00:32] headship that's Christ and Christ is the
[1:00:35] word following the message of the hour
[1:00:37] the message of the hour is the
[1:00:39] magnifying glass over top of the word
[1:00:41] we've heard it said many times that is
[1:00:43] the explanation of the word and we know
[1:00:45] that Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:00:47] is such a tremendous message but to talk
[1:00:50] about headship and understanding that
[1:00:52] really the only success we're going to
[1:00:54] have brothers and sisters in our lives
[1:00:56] is to fall into our positions to be in
[1:00:59] our positions in our positions that's
[1:01:01] where God's going to use us that is
[1:01:04] where he's going to purge the branch and
[1:01:07] you know what when he purges the branch
[1:01:08] and we have fruit he he wants more fruit
[1:01:11] he doesn't want just one batch of fruit
[1:01:13] he wants to continually Purge the branch
[1:01:15] to bring more fruit and you know what he
[1:01:17] says in his word we read that in John 15
[1:01:19] maybe we'll go back to it tonight but
[1:01:21] it's kind of what we're doing on Sundays
[1:01:24] but it just dovetails together because
[1:01:25] he is glorified in the fruit that you
[1:01:28] bear
[1:01:31] the only way that's going to happen is
[1:01:33] for us to be in our position though to
[1:01:36] be able to allow that life to flow
[1:01:38] through us when we're out of our
[1:01:40] position that life isn't going to flow
[1:01:41] through us it's going to be disjointed
[1:01:43] you can't take a branch and bend it off
[1:01:46] a tree and have one little tiny piece of
[1:01:48] it hanging onto the tree it's going to
[1:01:50] die it's going to wither up it's still
[1:01:51] attached to the tree but the majority of
[1:01:53] that life isn't coming through and
[1:01:55] that's what happens to a Believer when
[1:01:57] we peel ourselves away from the word of
[1:01:59] God
[1:02:00] it's not about being in an assembly it's
[1:02:02] about following the word of God in our
[1:02:03] lives and when we're in our positions
[1:02:05] that Branch remains intact it doesn't
[1:02:09] matter if it gets broken further down
[1:02:10] the branch many times in our lives our
[1:02:13] branches will get broken but that Branch
[1:02:15] will still bring forth fruit it will
[1:02:17] still bring forth life
[1:02:20] we know brother Branham talks about it
[1:02:21] that the branch that's grafted in has
[1:02:24] never going to be able we'll never be
[1:02:25] able to Bear the fruit of the original
[1:02:27] vine but if that original vine ever
[1:02:29] brings forth another Branch brother
[1:02:31] Branham said it very clearly then it
[1:02:32] will be that original Fruit
[1:02:34] mm-hmm
[1:02:36] we can't have any other headship brother
[1:02:37] Brown goes on to say this he says as the
[1:02:39] head was took up from the grave I just
[1:02:42] love this as the head was took up from
[1:02:44] the grave so must his body follow him
[1:02:46] into Eden
[1:02:47] therefore the body cannot recognize any
[1:02:50] other headship but the headship of the
[1:02:53] word
[1:02:57] this is such a beautiful thought isn't
[1:02:58] it in our lives in our homes
[1:03:01] I want to say this wives
[1:03:03] brother Bradham said it very clearly
[1:03:06] if you want to see if someone's on the
[1:03:08] word
[1:03:09] give them the word test give it the word
[1:03:12] test wives
[1:03:14] maybe I'm stepping on toes and I
[1:03:16] apologize maybe I shouldn't do this but
[1:03:18] I'm going to do it anyway I just feel
[1:03:19] led two wives test your husbands
[1:03:22] give them the word test
[1:03:24] see if he's in his position
[1:03:27] and husbands give your word wives the
[1:03:28] word test
[1:03:30] give your children the word test
[1:03:32] children give your parents the word test
[1:03:34] we should be able to do it as a family
[1:03:36] and not get offended and recognize that
[1:03:39] hey you know what we might have a
[1:03:41] weakness we might have a blind spot that
[1:03:42] we just don't see we just don't know
[1:03:44] about God will use our children to talk
[1:03:47] to us
[1:03:48] God will use our spouse to speak to us
[1:03:52] don't ever discount that for a second
[1:03:55] I think it's such an amazing thing we
[1:03:57] had a conversation one time and I'm sure
[1:03:59] whoever said it will know what I'm
[1:04:01] talking about but you know we've been
[1:04:03] given a spouse for a reason
[1:04:06] and that reason is so that we can
[1:04:08] actually have
[1:04:10] conversations in an intellectual way
[1:04:13] because we know that the woman we're
[1:04:15] going to get into that a little bit
[1:04:16] tonight if we have time the woman was
[1:04:18] taken from the man brother Branham calls
[1:04:19] her a byproduct and I don't mean that I
[1:04:23] don't think that he he means in such a
[1:04:25] way that she's just like the the piece
[1:04:27] of something that's left over that you
[1:04:29] know God just created just and had some
[1:04:32] leftovers that's not at all she came
[1:04:34] from the man he did not pull up dust
[1:04:38] brother Branham said and create the
[1:04:39] woman
[1:04:40] she took the woman he took the woman out
[1:04:43] of the man
[1:04:47] sometimes
[1:04:49] we need to give each other the word test
[1:04:51] our wives can speak to us the word of
[1:04:54] God
[1:04:55] we've been given the ability to know
[1:04:58] each other in a way
[1:04:59] that nobody else will ever know us
[1:05:01] and that is an example of the mystery
[1:05:04] that Paul talked about in Ephesians
[1:05:05] chapter 5. we need to have that
[1:05:07] relationship where we we can speak and
[1:05:11] and he will know what we're talking
[1:05:13] about uh our our wives can speak and the
[1:05:16] husbands can can finish the sentence
[1:05:18] when we're talking we know what the
[1:05:20] other one means you get to know one
[1:05:22] another that well sometimes you can
[1:05:25] actually know what the other one's
[1:05:26] thinking just by sitting there and and
[1:05:28] someone will say something and the other
[1:05:30] one will say well I was just thinking
[1:05:31] about that how did you know that get out
[1:05:33] of my head we've had that conversation
[1:05:36] how does that happen you get to know one
[1:05:38] another you get to know one another on a
[1:05:40] level that's different it's the same
[1:05:42] thing with the spirit of God in our
[1:05:44] lives
[1:05:46] but you know our wives have been given
[1:05:48] to us for a purpose and that purpose is
[1:05:51] is to complete us and and we know that
[1:05:54] the woman was taken out of the man the
[1:05:55] feminist was taken out of the masculine
[1:05:57] and and the twain were actually two were
[1:06:00] actually one originally they were
[1:06:02] created as one both male and female
[1:06:05] created him they is what it says in the
[1:06:08] in the Book of Genesis
[1:06:11] but talking about this we we have been
[1:06:14] given the ability to have a conversation
[1:06:15] with that person that knows us that well
[1:06:17] so that we can actually reason things
[1:06:21] out in our lives sometimes we need to be
[1:06:24] able to have those conversations with
[1:06:26] the other party and and it can be with
[1:06:28] children and parents I think it's one of
[1:06:30] the most important things as a parent to
[1:06:33] make sure that we have the relationships
[1:06:36] with our children so our children feel
[1:06:38] safe to come and talk to us about what
[1:06:40] these kids at school are doing because
[1:06:42] if they can't come and talk to the
[1:06:43] parents out of fear because there's no
[1:06:45] relationship there who are they going to
[1:06:47] talk to where are they going to get
[1:06:48] their education from who is going to be
[1:06:51] leading our children we've got to be
[1:06:53] willing to have those those
[1:06:55] relationships in our lives and that
[1:06:56] takes work
[1:06:58] you know what it takes it takes humility
[1:07:01] it takes the ability to say no I'm wrong
[1:07:05] no I've made a mistake I am in error and
[1:07:09] I'm sorry
[1:07:11] please forgive me
[1:07:13] we have to be willing to Humble
[1:07:15] ourselves
[1:07:16] in order to be able to submit in order
[1:07:19] to have a a headship in our lives
[1:07:25] brother banham says as the head was take
[1:07:27] up from the grave so must his body
[1:07:28] follow him into Eden therefore the body
[1:07:30] cannot recognize any other headship but
[1:07:33] the headship of the word
[1:07:36] no denomination can put anything to it
[1:07:40] for whosoever shall take one word away
[1:07:42] from it or add one word to it they've
[1:07:44] took away from it they're dead he says
[1:07:48] you're dead hybrid right there
[1:07:50] and so many times we can see that that's
[1:07:53] what the world has done that's what
[1:07:54] denominations have done they've added to
[1:07:57] or they've taken away and sometimes I
[1:08:00] think some of that can actually come
[1:08:02] over into the message to people who who
[1:08:05] maybe come out of being a Baptist maybe
[1:08:07] my parents were Baptists maybe my
[1:08:09] parents were Pentecostals maybe they
[1:08:11] were methodists maybe they had this
[1:08:13] family tradition maybe it was a certain
[1:08:15] way those things can just drag over into
[1:08:17] the message and after a while it can
[1:08:20] just seem to be a part of the message
[1:08:21] but if you can't find that behavior in
[1:08:24] the message then I would suggest that we
[1:08:26] just leave it alone we just put it off
[1:08:28] to the side and say no that that that
[1:08:30] might not be according to the word of
[1:08:32] God
[1:08:33] because I want the headship of the word
[1:08:35] is what brother Branham says they can
[1:08:37] only be one headship for the Bride of
[1:08:38] Jesus Christ so that's the headship of
[1:08:40] the word and the word for our day is
[1:08:43] really what we're after the word for our
[1:08:45] day it's not a new word it's not the
[1:08:47] Bible plus it's it's not brother Branham
[1:08:50] writing a book and saying that this is
[1:08:52] in addition to the Bible what it is and
[1:08:55] is an explanation of the Bible and
[1:08:57] pointing back to the Bible in so much
[1:09:00] that he recognized that he needed
[1:09:02] headship as well that he said if you
[1:09:04] can't take my word for it then take his
[1:09:06] word for it take the Bible for it how
[1:09:09] many other prophets out there in the
[1:09:11] world so-called have said that if you
[1:09:14] can't take my word for it take the Bible
[1:09:16] for it they don't do that that's what
[1:09:19] causes false prophets as they do their
[1:09:21] own addendum to it they add to it and
[1:09:23] they take away from it exactly what
[1:09:25] we've heard here and that's what causes
[1:09:26] people to get grossed out and so in our
[1:09:28] families if we add to or take away from
[1:09:31] it causes fusion in our homes that
[1:09:35] causes confusion in our relationships we
[1:09:37] cannot take tradition and say well it's
[1:09:39] just always the way we've done it we've
[1:09:41] just done it this way no
[1:09:44] as we near that that that that that that
[1:09:46] Capstone as we get to that place that's
[1:09:50] at the very top of the pyramid where
[1:09:52] it's Christ there's only going to be one
[1:09:55] Capstone and that Capstone is Christ
[1:09:57] himself the word that's what we're
[1:09:59] reading Christ is the mystery of God
[1:10:01] revealed look up headship in Christ The
[1:10:03] Mystery of God revealed and you'll see
[1:10:04] him he goes on to say he the word
[1:10:08] how do you know it's right
[1:10:10] he the word is Vindicated see
[1:10:14] how many of us here tonight have not
[1:10:17] seen the word Vindicated in any way in
[1:10:19] your life
[1:10:21] I wouldn't expect to see any hat but how
[1:10:23] many here have seen the word Vindicated
[1:10:25] in some way in your life everyone has
[1:10:30] so we can't say that God hasn't
[1:10:32] Vindicated his own word
[1:10:35] maybe we don't see the great prayer
[1:10:37] lines and the and the all the signs and
[1:10:40] wonders in our lives but we're not
[1:10:41] supposed to
[1:10:43] that was for another age brothers and
[1:10:44] sisters that was the bait on the hook to
[1:10:46] get the attention of the people to take
[1:10:48] a look at what God was doing through his
[1:10:50] prophet and what he was doing was
[1:10:52] sending his Prophet to call out a bride
[1:10:54] of his own choosing and he's done that
[1:10:56] but we're so thankful that he's still
[1:10:58] doing that tonight he's still calling
[1:11:02] he the word how do you know it's right
[1:11:04] he the word is Vindicated see and it has
[1:11:08] to be Vindicated personally it's got to
[1:11:10] be made personal to us we know that's
[1:11:12] what the new birth is Christ revealing
[1:11:14] himself making himself known personally
[1:11:16] to the individual and when that happens
[1:11:18] brothers and sisters when that truly
[1:11:20] happens then full humility full
[1:11:22] submission to the word of God is what
[1:11:24] follows there's no Cain Spirit where the
[1:11:28] person says oh I can only go this far
[1:11:30] you know I think it's all good but
[1:11:31] except for that that's not true new
[1:11:34] birth that's not a new birth that's
[1:11:35] maybe a conversion that's maybe someone
[1:11:37] who is conforming to a list of Standards
[1:11:39] that's what denominationalism is that's
[1:11:42] justification and sanctification but
[1:11:43] it's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:45] and it can even be an anointing of the
[1:11:48] Holy Ghost at times in our lives which
[1:11:50] makes it so treacherous
[1:11:52] but when we truly have the baptism of
[1:11:54] the Holy Ghost in our lives that it's
[1:11:55] complete submission total humility unto
[1:11:58] the word of God that's when we can
[1:12:01] submit ourselves one to another in the
[1:12:03] fear of God and that is the beginning of
[1:12:06] it all I believe my myself I think
[1:12:08] that's the most critical part to it is
[1:12:09] being able to submit ourselves one to
[1:12:12] another in the fear of God maybe we
[1:12:13] bitterly disagree but we'll always come
[1:12:15] together and shake hands and say God
[1:12:17] bless you in the end and and not have
[1:12:19] something in our hearts
[1:12:21] you know John 10 37 if I do not the
[1:12:25] works of my father believe me not but if
[1:12:27] I do though you believe not me believe
[1:12:29] the works
[1:12:30] that ye may know and believe that the
[1:12:33] father is in me and I in him and we know
[1:12:36] this is the story where they picked up
[1:12:38] stones to Stone him and he said why
[1:12:40] wherefore are you trying to stole me why
[1:12:42] are you trying to take me out here why
[1:12:43] are you doing this to me and they say
[1:12:45] well we love you and we love your Mighty
[1:12:47] signs and and wonderful Miracles and
[1:12:49] works but you know what's it's that you
[1:12:51] just go and you call yourself God and we
[1:12:52] just can't deal with that we call that
[1:12:54] blasphemy and he says to him you know if
[1:12:56] you can't believe me just believe the
[1:12:58] works that I do how could any human
[1:13:00] being ever do this on his own if it
[1:13:02] weren't for God
[1:13:06] brother Branham goes on to say he the
[1:13:08] word properly Vindicated is the headship
[1:13:13] the properly Vindicated word is the
[1:13:16] headship that is the Capstone the
[1:13:19] properly Vindicated word in our lives is
[1:13:22] the headship and brothers and sisters I
[1:13:24] want to say tonight everybody knows this
[1:13:26] but being in your position and properly
[1:13:29] vindicating your position according to
[1:13:32] the word of God is headship that is
[1:13:36] according to the word of God he the word
[1:13:39] properly Vindicated is headship the head
[1:13:42] of the church he is the word the
[1:13:45] headship he's properly identified
[1:13:49] identified Vindicated by his own spirit
[1:13:53] being in the church itself the person
[1:13:57] I love that because he doesn't say just
[1:14:00] the church itself just the great church
[1:14:02] the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:14:04] Somewhere Out There untangible the
[1:14:06] person
[1:14:08] the person showing forth himself in
[1:14:12] vindication
[1:14:14] is the direct proof to the entire body
[1:14:19] you know we can say it Satan wants to
[1:14:21] say no you don't got it
[1:14:23] you're not you're not there no you're
[1:14:25] not there maybe it's not real you
[1:14:27] haven't seen Mighty signs and wonders in
[1:14:28] your life maybe once upon a time the
[1:14:30] flame was lit and now it's gone out it's
[1:14:32] just he wants us to give up but you know
[1:14:35] what it's not about emotion and it's not
[1:14:37] about our feelings all of that has
[1:14:39] absolutely nothing to do with it
[1:14:41] brother Branham says it's the word it's
[1:14:43] the person himself showing forth the
[1:14:46] Vindication that you believe this word
[1:14:48] of God and it doesn't really matter what
[1:14:50] comes or goes who comes or goes what
[1:14:52] happens you still believe this word of
[1:14:55] God it is Vindicated by his own spirit
[1:14:59] being in the church itself the person
[1:15:02] showing forth himself in Vindication is
[1:15:06] the direct proof to the entire body
[1:15:09] you believe the word of God
[1:15:12] you don't need Creeds then
[1:15:14] you don't need Creeds then denominations
[1:15:17] has perished but the headship itself
[1:15:21] recognized in the body by personal
[1:15:25] identifications
[1:15:29] not who I want to be
[1:15:32] but I sure ain't who I used to be
[1:15:35] I'm sure that every one of us can say
[1:15:36] that brothers and sisters
[1:15:38] we're maybe not exactly that Perfect
[1:15:40] Image that we have in our mind but you
[1:15:43] know I want to say this that probably in
[1:15:46] in our mind we're never going to attain
[1:15:48] that Perfect Image because of this
[1:15:50] hybrid flesh condition that we're in
[1:15:53] but that doesn't change what the word of
[1:15:55] God says our ability to receive this
[1:15:58] word demonstrates headship in our lives
[1:16:01] it demonstrates the authority of God
[1:16:04] being Lord Jesus Christ in our lives and
[1:16:08] we know many people in this world
[1:16:09] they'll declare Jesus Christ all day
[1:16:11] long they'll say the blood of Jesus
[1:16:12] Christ Jesus Christ they'll say it
[1:16:14] they'll say it they'll live it they have
[1:16:16] fantastic lives maybe many even signs
[1:16:18] and wonders in their lives in their
[1:16:20] churches but boy when you start saying
[1:16:22] Lord Lord Jesus Christ oh the Lord says
[1:16:26] don't cut your hair oh the Lord says
[1:16:28] don't wear a garment that pertains to a
[1:16:30] man the Lord says to go to church my
[1:16:34] when you start talking about that the
[1:16:36] Lord says I'll send you a prophet before
[1:16:39] the great and terrible day of the Lord
[1:16:42] it gets to be a bit much for people
[1:16:45] but we're not talking about signs and
[1:16:47] wonders it's about the identification of
[1:16:49] the word to us personally in our own
[1:16:51] lives and when that happens nobody's
[1:16:53] ever going to take it away from us
[1:16:54] because nobody's ever talked us into it
[1:16:56] if someone could talk you into it they
[1:16:58] could talk you out of it
[1:17:01] you don't need Creeds then the
[1:17:03] nomination says perished but the
[1:17:05] headship itself recognized in the body
[1:17:07] by personal identifications
[1:17:10] see identifying himself in Brackets
[1:17:14] proves the headship to the body
[1:17:18] he identifies himself to us day by day
[1:17:21] and you know we just need to look around
[1:17:24] and give them the opportunity to to to
[1:17:27] express himself to us and through us we
[1:17:30] can look everywhere we look isn't it
[1:17:32] amazing in this world every single place
[1:17:34] you look you see God when you've had
[1:17:36] that experience you look at the sunrise
[1:17:38] in the morning and you think my that's
[1:17:40] from him and you look at the Sunset and
[1:17:42] you think another one from him you look
[1:17:45] at the trees and you look at the grass
[1:17:46] you look at the animals you look at the
[1:17:48] humans you look at the families you look
[1:17:50] at everything all of creation around us
[1:17:53] is is him everywhere we look
[1:17:57] he's identifying himself
[1:17:59] proves the headship to the body then we
[1:18:03] are united under one Vindicated headship
[1:18:07] that is Christ the word of God not under
[1:18:10] any church
[1:18:13] then our headship is a kingdom
[1:18:17] looking at the uh the message of the
[1:18:19] hour many times we could say well he
[1:18:22] Vindicated himself through the prophet
[1:18:24] but how does he vindicate himself
[1:18:26] through me how does this become me where
[1:18:28] do I see the Vindication of the word the
[1:18:31] Vindication of the word for us brothers
[1:18:33] and sisters isn't necessarily signs and
[1:18:35] wonders although they will follow if you
[1:18:38] believe for any period of time you will
[1:18:40] see signs and wonders if you believe
[1:18:41] this word you will it's inevitable you
[1:18:44] cannot separate the two but they follow
[1:18:47] they don't lead but you know our our our
[1:18:49] headship our submission is absolutely in
[1:18:54] the word of God Alone
[1:18:57] being able to submit ourselves to the
[1:19:00] word
[1:19:01] and that word is a kingdom
[1:19:05] talking about submission tonight I'm
[1:19:07] gonna have to speed up here you know the
[1:19:10] story of Esther I think it's such an
[1:19:11] amazing story when you look at it and uh
[1:19:14] you don't have to turn there tonight but
[1:19:16] we I'll just cover a couple quick things
[1:19:18] here I just wanted to take something
[1:19:19] from a little bit of a different angle
[1:19:20] from that story the story of Esther we
[1:19:23] know that you know
[1:19:25] there was a queen in the land and and
[1:19:28] the King he got what he wanted that's
[1:19:30] just the way it works in in that time in
[1:19:32] that place when the king said something
[1:19:34] it happened and that's all there was to
[1:19:37] it and if it didn't happen there was a
[1:19:39] problem there was a repercussion to pay
[1:19:40] and the queen that he had she got
[1:19:43] comfortable in her position and she
[1:19:44] thought she had Authority when really
[1:19:46] the only Authority she had was what the
[1:19:48] king gave her the only position she had
[1:19:51] was what that King gave her but she got
[1:19:54] puffed up inside herself and said hey I
[1:19:56] I deserve something because I'm the
[1:19:58] queen she got lifted up in her heart
[1:20:00] Pride looked look look looked up in her
[1:20:02] heart and you know what happened they
[1:20:04] said you know well just get rid of her
[1:20:05] we'll just find another one and we know
[1:20:06] it was all for a purpose and and that's
[1:20:08] not really what I want to preach on
[1:20:09] tonight but what I want to say is that
[1:20:11] Esther when when she came in to the
[1:20:15] situation she had to be strong in her
[1:20:18] position she recognized that if you
[1:20:21] approach the king unannounced it meant
[1:20:23] death that that was the law in in the
[1:20:26] time and she wasn't invited in to see
[1:20:29] the king
[1:20:31] but there was a decree that went forward
[1:20:32] it was a trap we know that they were uh
[1:20:36] more uh Heyman was looking to kill the
[1:20:39] Jews all of this was happening for the
[1:20:41] purpose of of of her coming to herself
[1:20:45] in her position as the queen but she had
[1:20:48] to be strong in this position
[1:20:51] and being strong in her position didn't
[1:20:54] mean that she actually rolled up her
[1:20:56] sleeves and and she she got her Posse
[1:21:00] with her
[1:21:00] and she went right into the presence of
[1:21:02] the king and she told him this has
[1:21:04] happened and someone has made a decree
[1:21:06] and and he's trying to kill all of our
[1:21:08] our people and and she had a very
[1:21:12] specific way of doing it there was only
[1:21:14] one way that she could do it in her
[1:21:15] heart and that was to be humble in her
[1:21:18] heart even though she was fully right in
[1:21:22] her in her in her behavior because she
[1:21:25] knew that it was her people that was
[1:21:26] gonna die but to think about the
[1:21:28] difference between the two queens one of
[1:21:31] them was puffed up with pride in her
[1:21:32] heart vashti would have stomped her way
[1:21:34] right into the presence of the king and
[1:21:36] probably wagged her finger in his nose
[1:21:38] and told him
[1:21:40] but something was in the heart of Esther
[1:21:42] that just couldn't do it
[1:21:45] she had something else there was
[1:21:47] something in her she was willing to
[1:21:49] submit herself unto the king's headship
[1:21:52] unto his leadership she had submission
[1:21:54] in her heart it's just an interesting
[1:21:57] thing to think about she knew that it
[1:21:58] meant certain death but she conducted
[1:22:00] herself as a queen in the position and I
[1:22:04] just think you know how often we can do
[1:22:07] that in our own lives as husbands we can
[1:22:09] say you know I'm right in my position
[1:22:11] and I know this situation is wrong and I
[1:22:14] can go to God with it and say I demand
[1:22:16] something
[1:22:17] or I can go to him
[1:22:20] with reverence
[1:22:21] and I can go to him with submission but
[1:22:24] you know I I think it's so important to
[1:22:26] recognize brothers and sisters many
[1:22:27] times I think we go to God many times
[1:22:30] without realizing that we're going to
[1:22:32] God
[1:22:33] and if you're wondering what I'm talking
[1:22:35] about I'm saying when we talk to one
[1:22:36] another
[1:22:38] if we've got the Holy Ghost in one
[1:22:39] another if we got the Holy Ghost In Our
[1:22:41] Lives when we talk to our brother when
[1:22:42] we talk to our sister who are we talking
[1:22:45] to
[1:22:46] we should have reverence in our hearts
[1:22:48] reverence in our our minds when we have
[1:22:51] the conversations within the Bible study
[1:22:54] we're talking about it how did those 42
[1:22:56] kids die
[1:22:58] back in Elijah's day brother Branham
[1:23:00] says it was the conversation of the
[1:23:02] parents
[1:23:03] that destroyed those children it was
[1:23:05] parental delinquency and it was directly
[1:23:07] related to the conversation around the
[1:23:09] dinner tables the conversation in the
[1:23:11] cars while the people were traveling
[1:23:13] around they were talking bad about the
[1:23:15] prophet they were talking bad about the
[1:23:17] pastor they were talking bad about the
[1:23:19] the word of God they were saying that
[1:23:21] you know it's just a man it's just a man
[1:23:23] how could it be we know who he is you
[1:23:26] know what happened it didn't turn out
[1:23:28] right for them but what we're saying
[1:23:30] here tonight is there needs to be a
[1:23:31] reverence there needs to be a submission
[1:23:33] the word of God we read it in in verse
[1:23:34] 21 I believe of Ephesians chapter 5
[1:23:36] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:23:39] the fear of God
[1:23:41] recognizing that if we are Sons and
[1:23:43] Daughters of God this goes much deeper
[1:23:45] than recognizing thinking that we're
[1:23:47] just a body of Believers and it's just
[1:23:49] you know brother so and so on sister so
[1:23:52] and so it's it's God Almighty in flesh
[1:23:55] it's it's if they believe this word of
[1:23:57] God this is the word of God standing
[1:23:59] before us in flesh and and husbands and
[1:24:02] wives and children and parents
[1:24:05] we're in a place that's different than
[1:24:06] any other age has ever encountered this
[1:24:11] is a just like we've talked about the
[1:24:12] children of Israel crossing over Jordan
[1:24:14] you know you got to keep your eyes on
[1:24:15] that word when the Levites get up and
[1:24:17] march across keep a certain distance so
[1:24:19] you can see exactly the way that they go
[1:24:21] because if you miss what's going on
[1:24:23] nobody's ever gone this way before we
[1:24:26] need to make sure that we recognize it
[1:24:27] the only way we're going to do that is
[1:24:28] to have full submission to the headship
[1:24:30] of the lord we could close right now but
[1:24:32] we're not gonna
[1:24:33] full submission to the headship of the
[1:24:35] Lord that's it brothers and sisters and
[1:24:37] how do we do that get in your position
[1:24:39] husbands love your wives wives submit
[1:24:41] yourselves to your husbands children
[1:24:43] obey your parents that's how it happens
[1:24:45] understanding that the word of God takes
[1:24:48] precedence in our lives
[1:24:50] Colossians 3 17 and whatsoever ye do in
[1:24:53] word or deed do all in the name of the
[1:24:56] Lord Jesus
[1:24:59] giving thanks to God and the father by
[1:25:02] him
[1:25:05] my wife has to pick up another glass
[1:25:07] that I've left laying around
[1:25:10] she can growl at me
[1:25:13] or she can do it all in the name of the
[1:25:16] Lord Jesus
[1:25:17] and I'm not saying that she growls at me
[1:25:19] I'm just just giving an example and I'm
[1:25:21] making it about me I'm not making it
[1:25:23] about anybody else many times we can do
[1:25:25] things and we can Grumble about it
[1:25:27] because the situation it's over and over
[1:25:30] and over and over and over and over and
[1:25:32] I thought that by now they would stop
[1:25:34] doing what they're doing but they just
[1:25:36] keep doing it and God just keeps letting
[1:25:37] them do it they just keep doing it over
[1:25:40] and over and over
[1:25:42] it's got nothing to do with you
[1:25:44] I mean it's got nothing to do with them
[1:25:46] it's got everything to do with you
[1:25:48] it's all about our heart
[1:25:50] we need to do it in the fear of God
[1:25:53] and whatsoever you do in word or tea do
[1:25:55] all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:57] giving thanks to God and the father by
[1:25:59] him wives submit yourselves unto your
[1:26:01] own husbands as it's fit in the Lord
[1:26:02] husbands love your wives be not bitter
[1:26:05] against them children
[1:26:07] obey your parents in all things for this
[1:26:10] is well pleasing unto the Lord
[1:26:12] fathers provoke not your children to
[1:26:15] anger lest they be discouraged
[1:26:18] servants obey in all things your Masters
[1:26:21] according to the flesh
[1:26:25] I just love that one because I would say
[1:26:27] that servants today is employees obey in
[1:26:30] all things your Masters according to the
[1:26:32] flesh not with eye Service as men
[1:26:34] Pleasers but in singleness of heart
[1:26:38] fearing God
[1:26:40] and and 23 it's like a sandwich of it
[1:26:43] it's just so beautiful and whatsoever ye
[1:26:45] do do it heartily as unto the Lord and
[1:26:49] not unto men
[1:26:51] children when you're doing school work
[1:26:53] do it heartily as unto the Lord and not
[1:26:56] unto men employees when you're working
[1:26:59] do it heartily as unto the Lord not unto
[1:27:02] men husbands when you love your wives do
[1:27:05] it heartily as unto the Lord not as unto
[1:27:09] men or your wives wives when you submit
[1:27:12] to your husbands
[1:27:13] sometimes it can be hard maybe but do it
[1:27:17] heartily as unto the Lord
[1:27:21] Hebrews 13 obey them that have the rule
[1:27:23] over you and submit yourselves for they
[1:27:26] watch over your souls as they that must
[1:27:29] give account that they may do it with
[1:27:32] joy and not with grief for that is
[1:27:35] unprofitable for you and I know some who
[1:27:38] know the scripture might say brother
[1:27:39] Barry that's talking about the the
[1:27:41] keepers of the house of the Lord that's
[1:27:43] talking about the ministry and indeed it
[1:27:45] is but who is the husband in the home
[1:27:48] he's the one that's going to give a full
[1:27:49] account for his family
[1:27:52] God's not going to go to the wife and
[1:27:53] say what did you do remember we talked
[1:27:55] about it he didn't come down and ask Eve
[1:27:57] Eve where are you he knew where she was
[1:27:59] but he came down and talked to Adam he
[1:28:01] didn't tell Eve don't you eat of that
[1:28:03] tree he told Adam don't you eat of that
[1:28:06] tree and Adam told his wife
[1:28:09] obey them that have the rule over you
[1:28:11] remember we talked about it back in the
[1:28:13] Garden of Eden he shall rule over you
[1:28:17] he shall rule over you but he's also
[1:28:20] going to give a full accounting for his
[1:28:21] behavior and how he led his family
[1:28:23] that's what's going to happen the
[1:28:25] husband will James 4 6 but he that he
[1:28:29] giveth more grace wherefore he saith God
[1:28:32] resisteth the proud
[1:28:35] but giveth Grace unto the humble
[1:28:40] submit yourselves therefore unto God
[1:28:43] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:28:44] you many times we read that scripture
[1:28:46] we'll just say that yeah submit
[1:28:48] yourselves therefore unto God resist the
[1:28:49] devil and heal free from you but
[1:28:50] remember that verse before it he giveth
[1:28:52] more grace wherefore he saith God
[1:28:54] resisteth the proud but giveth Grace
[1:28:57] unto the humble remember brother Bradham
[1:28:59] said it I just think it's one of the
[1:29:01] most beautiful statements is that is
[1:29:03] that true Revelation it doesn't puff you
[1:29:07] up true Revelation it brings to light it
[1:29:10] shines a magnifying glass with a light
[1:29:12] on it about how simple we really are how
[1:29:16] desperately we really need the Lord in
[1:29:18] our lives every one of us be said that
[1:29:21] our lives our souls are hanging over
[1:29:23] Hell by a chain with a weak Link in it
[1:29:26] every one of us and it's just his grace
[1:29:28] that holds us there that keeps us from
[1:29:30] going in
[1:29:31] because every one of us born in sin
[1:29:33] shaped and iniquity come into the world
[1:29:34] speaking Lies We all deserve death
[1:29:37] but he giveth more grace
[1:29:40] God who is rich in Mercy
[1:29:43] he resists the proud but give us Grace
[1:29:46] unto the humble submit yourselves
[1:29:48] therefore to God right submit yourselves
[1:29:51] one to another in the fear of God
[1:29:54] submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:29:57] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:29:59] if you've got the devil in your family
[1:30:00] if he's mixing it up if he's trying to
[1:30:03] come against your marriage if he's
[1:30:04] trying to come against your
[1:30:05] relationships with your children
[1:30:07] brothers and sisters submit yourselves
[1:30:09] therefore to God but remember he giveth
[1:30:12] more grace wherefore he saith God
[1:30:14] resisteth the proud but giveth Grace
[1:30:17] unto the humble submit yourselves
[1:30:19] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[1:30:22] has to flee
[1:30:24] you don't have to accept them in your
[1:30:25] family in your marriage in your
[1:30:27] relationships
[1:30:29] the next verse says draw an eye unto God
[1:30:31] and he'll draw an eye unto you cleanse
[1:30:33] your hands ye Sinners and purify your
[1:30:35] hearts ye double-minded be afflicted and
[1:30:38] mourn and weep let your laughter be
[1:30:41] turned to mourning and your joy to
[1:30:42] heaviness humble yourselves in the sight
[1:30:44] of the Lord
[1:30:46] and he shall lift you up
[1:30:50] talking about the uh
[1:30:52] my goodness I won't get into that
[1:30:54] tonight
[1:30:56] just talking about the
[1:31:00] study that I've been getting into
[1:31:03] um I won't get into it tonight but you
[1:31:05] know we need to recognize that we need
[1:31:07] to Humble ourselves in the sight of the
[1:31:08] Lord that's the only way that he'll Lift
[1:31:10] us up
[1:31:12] if we puff ourselves up and say no I'm
[1:31:14] the husband nope I'm the wife and and
[1:31:17] the husband's out of position or
[1:31:18] children can look at their parents and
[1:31:20] say nope you're not serving God you're
[1:31:21] you're a double-minded you're talking
[1:31:23] about people around the dinner table and
[1:31:25] I know that you're not actually serving
[1:31:27] God he's not going to say I'll give you
[1:31:28] a pass on that he's going to say what
[1:31:30] about you and your position you know the
[1:31:32] word of God you have to follow that
[1:31:35] headship you've got to be willing to
[1:31:36] follow that leadership
[1:31:38] first Peter 2 submit yourselves to every
[1:31:41] ordinance of man
[1:31:43] for the Lord's sake
[1:31:45] some people will say well no I'm a free
[1:31:47] agent on the land I don't have to pay
[1:31:49] taxes
[1:31:50] I don't have to buy property I can do
[1:31:52] whatever I want to do there's all kinds
[1:31:54] of theories and ideas that are out there
[1:31:55] but this just brings it right down to
[1:31:58] where we live doesn't it submit
[1:31:59] yourselves to every ordinance of man for
[1:32:01] the Lord's sake and we know that Jesus
[1:32:04] when he was here
[1:32:06] he held up the coin to the disciples and
[1:32:08] he said whose inscription is on that
[1:32:09] coin right there whose is that
[1:32:11] I said well it's it's Caesars and he
[1:32:13] said Render unto Caesar what's Caesar's
[1:32:15] right you make sure you do that you pay
[1:32:17] your taxes you make sure that you follow
[1:32:19] the laws you you follow the speed limits
[1:32:22] you do everything according to the word
[1:32:24] I say Lord help me I try and do it all
[1:32:26] according to the law I'm not interested
[1:32:28] in trying to do anything outside of it
[1:32:30] but I make mistakes sometimes my foot
[1:32:32] gets a little heavy on the gas pedal and
[1:32:34] you know things happen but I usually get
[1:32:37] spanked pretty hard
[1:32:39] I'll give you an example one time I was
[1:32:41] a deacon at the door
[1:32:43] real life example
[1:32:45] we were trying to get to church on time
[1:32:46] and if anybody has ever experienced this
[1:32:49] I'm not sure if you have but in our
[1:32:51] house it's always a struggle on Sunday
[1:32:53] to get to church on time it's not
[1:32:55] sometimes it's always same thing with
[1:32:58] Wednesday nights but you know this time
[1:33:00] was the time of all times and this time
[1:33:03] I was angry I had righteous indignation
[1:33:06] and so we were doing 140.
[1:33:08] and I got pinched he got me with the
[1:33:11] laser and you know I got pulled over and
[1:33:14] I I went from being proud and puffed up
[1:33:16] to being humbled real humbled
[1:33:19] because of the speeding ticket but also
[1:33:22] because of the people that were coming
[1:33:24] through the doors now they were saying
[1:33:25] was that you back there pulled over with
[1:33:27] the police
[1:33:28] and the only thing I could do is grip my
[1:33:30] teeth and smile and say yeah yeah God
[1:33:33] bless you
[1:33:34] but you know what he knows how to Humble
[1:33:36] you he knows exactly how to Humble us
[1:33:39] we're not going to get away with nothing
[1:33:40] brother Branham says it very clearly
[1:33:43] that you can sin you can do things you
[1:33:46] can step outside of the word but he will
[1:33:48] always correct you we will always be
[1:33:51] corrected
[1:33:52] submit yourselves to every ordinance of
[1:33:55] man for the Lord's sake whether it be to
[1:33:57] the king as supreme or unto the
[1:33:59] governors as unto them that are sent by
[1:34:02] him for the punishment of evildoers and
[1:34:04] for the praise of them that do well
[1:34:08] for so is the will of God
[1:34:10] that with well-doing ye may put to
[1:34:14] silence the ignorance of foolish men
[1:34:16] you follow the word of God you follow
[1:34:19] the laws of the land that's why it's
[1:34:22] real easy to see these other preachers
[1:34:25] who are out there trying to stir up
[1:34:27] trouble and and trying to make
[1:34:29] themselves martyrs
[1:34:31] follow the ordinances of the law that's
[1:34:33] all that's what the word of God says you
[1:34:36] don't have to try and stand out you
[1:34:37] already stand out if you believe the
[1:34:39] word of God you don't have to try and be
[1:34:41] a fanatic brother Branham even says it
[1:34:44] just go on be a good Christian just live
[1:34:45] a good Christian Life don't try and
[1:34:47] stand out don't try and be be different
[1:34:49] you're going to be different enough as
[1:34:51] it is first Peter 5 likewise you younger
[1:34:54] submit yourselves unto the Elder you get
[1:34:56] the theme Here submit submit yourselves
[1:34:58] and ultimately submit yourselves to the
[1:35:01] word the headship of the of the word
[1:35:03] likewise ye younger submit yourselves
[1:35:05] unto the Elder yay all of you be subject
[1:35:08] one to another and be clothed with
[1:35:12] humility
[1:35:14] why because God resisteth the proud and
[1:35:18] he giveth grace to the humble
[1:35:20] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:35:23] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[1:35:26] in due time
[1:35:28] sometimes in our lives we can be cast
[1:35:31] down we can be trodden we can be
[1:35:34] mistreated
[1:35:37] but God's waiting to see what we're
[1:35:39] going to do about it
[1:35:40] are we going to follow his word are we
[1:35:42] going to actually just be subjected to
[1:35:45] his word to the headship of the word in
[1:35:47] our lives or are we going to say no I'm
[1:35:49] I'm righteous in my position I know that
[1:35:52] I've I've I've done everything right in
[1:35:54] my life everything's perfect here
[1:35:57] you know what I I just think there's one
[1:35:59] quote I'm going to read in in closing
[1:36:01] I'll call the musicians
[1:36:03] for real now I'll close
[1:36:05] but you know I I just think this is so
[1:36:07] good when we can get this Revelation in
[1:36:10] our lives and and it's in many different
[1:36:12] levels and I'll say it this way
[1:36:14] um
[1:36:16] it can be in gifts that the Lord's
[1:36:18] placed in our lives sometimes we don't
[1:36:19] even know that we have a gift
[1:36:21] this is brother branham's out of led by
[1:36:23] the spirit of God in 1956.
[1:36:27] talking about the disciples and how they
[1:36:30] had the experience with God but they
[1:36:32] were given the word for their day which
[1:36:34] was their headship
[1:36:35] and and all they had to do was follow
[1:36:37] the word and and and and the headship
[1:36:40] would manifest like brother Bradham
[1:36:41] talked about it would just be Vindicated
[1:36:44] in their lives if they were willing to
[1:36:46] follow the word and and brother Bradham
[1:36:49] he says this and they climbed up in the
[1:36:50] upper room and stayed there cowardly the
[1:36:54] door was locked the windows were locked
[1:36:56] praying real low to themselves
[1:36:59] and hiding out from the Jews until the
[1:37:01] Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:37:03] he says there came a sound from heaven
[1:37:06] like a rushing Mighty Wind filled all
[1:37:08] the house where they were sitting
[1:37:11] cloven tongue set upon them like fire
[1:37:13] and Outdoors and windows both they went
[1:37:18] into the street led by the Holy Ghost
[1:37:23] just amazing contrast one moment they're
[1:37:25] afraid hiding and the next minute
[1:37:27] they're spilling out of the house they
[1:37:29] don't care it's beautiful
[1:37:33] he says led by the Holy Ghost
[1:37:36] sorry cloven tongue set upon them like
[1:37:38] fire and out the doors and windows both
[1:37:40] they went into the street led by the
[1:37:43] Holy Ghost and that fire
[1:37:46] what was kindled on that on the day of
[1:37:49] Pentecost
[1:37:51] is still
[1:37:52] struck our hearts from that day till
[1:37:55] this
[1:37:57] men that wants to be led
[1:38:00] by the Holy Spirit
[1:38:02] and that truly is what we're talking
[1:38:03] about tonight brothers and sisters there
[1:38:06] was a quote that I came across I didn't
[1:38:07] bring it tonight but brother Branham
[1:38:09] talks about the word of God in our lives
[1:38:12] but it's not just the word of God in our
[1:38:14] lives there has to be the quickening
[1:38:16] power of that word of God there has to
[1:38:19] be that that energy he says the word of
[1:38:22] God energizes that word to us and
[1:38:26] through us and when that happens there's
[1:38:29] nothing that's going to change us
[1:38:31] but the RAM goes on to say here if
[1:38:34] you're ready to be led by the Holy
[1:38:36] Spirit mind him
[1:38:38] obey him
[1:38:41] do what you can for him
[1:38:44] I just think this applies so well to our
[1:38:46] positions
[1:38:47] as husbands as wives as children as
[1:38:50] brothers and sisters as a congregation
[1:38:52] if you're ready to be led by the Holy
[1:38:55] Spirit mind him obey him do what he can
[1:38:58] for him when you see a place that you
[1:39:02] could be used
[1:39:03] let God use you in that
[1:39:06] he says do you believe that
[1:39:08] I just think it's so beautiful just let
[1:39:10] God use you at position brothers and
[1:39:13] sisters many times we don't have to get
[1:39:15] on an airplane and travel to a different
[1:39:17] country and go to a foreign land we've
[1:39:19] got a mission field right here we've got
[1:39:22] many things in our lives that we can
[1:39:24] change
[1:39:25] and see a great manifestation of the
[1:39:28] Vindication of the word just by getting
[1:39:30] into our position and seeing a need and
[1:39:33] doing something about it and I say Lord
[1:39:35] help me he shows me all the time
[1:39:39] many times I don't follow because of
[1:39:41] habit because of this flesh because of
[1:39:44] this life because because because why
[1:39:46] because
[1:39:47] what if I just make a change in my own
[1:39:49] life and just see the the Lord move and
[1:39:52] I've made changes in my own life and
[1:39:53] seen him move I'm just saying this to
[1:39:55] encourage us brothers and sisters
[1:39:56] sometimes just the smallest thing just
[1:39:58] the littlest change can make a great
[1:40:01] impact in our lives spiritually speaking
[1:40:04] we know the word says it's the little
[1:40:05] foxes that spoil the vine it's not the
[1:40:07] great big things out there it's just a
[1:40:08] little foxes brothers and sisters stand
[1:40:10] with me tonight as we close in prayer
[1:40:13] foreign
[1:40:14] gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight I
[1:40:17] believe that we are all ready to be led
[1:40:19] by the Holy Spirit

[1:40:55] through US Lord we know that the signs
[1:40:58] and wonders will follow and we're not
