[0:00] awesome
[0:05] good morning Lord bless you all
[0:09] just felt led to
[0:11] read another poem to you today
[0:15] it's kind of interesting because I've
[0:17] never written a poem in my life
[0:20] never even enjoyed poetry
[0:23] but two weeks ago I was driving in my
[0:27] vehicle
[0:28] and these words came to me and over the
[0:31] last two weeks the to help the Holy
[0:33] Ghost I've kind of added it to it and
[0:35] honed it so
[0:37] I strongly believe that someone's meant
[0:40] to hear this today
[0:41] the title of the poem is spiritual
[0:43] maturity
[0:46] once we knew in part
[0:49] our vision incomplete
[0:52] our prophecies mere Shadows at our feet
[0:57] with passion our Prophet implored
[1:01] this beautiful Truth for us to explore
[1:05] oh don't be children be women and men
[1:09] the End Road is here
[1:12] let faith in you transcend transcend
[1:15] a little greenness left to bake
[1:20] he's waited for fruit on the branch to
[1:23] take
[1:25] with a heart full of compassion
[1:28] he encouraged us so
[1:31] seek God's face and let wisdom flow
[1:36] the time has come
[1:38] to own our place
[1:41] true love Faith and God's divine grace
[1:44] the perfect one has come
[1:47] he's arrived
[1:49] Shining Light so clear
[1:52] no longer in part we truly see and hear
[1:57] as a child we thought and acted like a
[2:00] child might
[2:02] but the matured
[2:04] are promised to be led by the mind of
[2:06] Christ
[2:09] with heart mind
[2:11] and speech all aligned
[2:16] choosing to live by God's truth each
[2:18] time
[2:20] once we saw through a mirror dark and
[2:23] unclear
[2:24] the world's turmoil often caused our
[2:27] hearts to fear
[2:29] but now we see him face to face
[2:33] by Love's Eternal embrace our chosen
[2:36] place
[2:39] with the true anointing of his spirit
[2:41] we are renewed
[2:43] it's God's power
[2:45] it transfigures and abuse
[2:49] with all authority to discern to love
[2:52] and to serve
[2:54] his great name we abide and are
[2:57] preserved
[2:59] the anointing from above did descend
[3:03] guiding us always our true purpose to
[3:06] defend
[3:08] through great storms and trials we often
[3:11] tripped and squirmed
[3:13] but by his Loving Care
[3:16] we found the strength to stand firm
[3:20] for in his mighty name
[3:22] we did overcome
[3:24] because our Victory he hath already won
[3:29] his election persevered
[3:32] and will never fail
[3:35] it's the guidepost that keeps you and I
[3:37] from drifting off the trail
[3:41] Our Hope and Faith have endured but it's
[3:45] his love his most precious and pure
[3:48] the anointing we received anchors Within
[3:52] a teacher of Truth free from all sin
[3:56] no need for man's teachings God's word
[3:59] is true
[4:01] simply abide in him and he will abide in
[4:04] you
[4:07] the Capstone so pure and right
[4:11] our Union veiled from Mortal sight
[4:15] low the spiritual bride appeared
[4:18] her true color showing
[4:21] on protrude by fear
[4:24] as we began our Revival inner strengths
[4:28] bright and vital
[4:30] aligning ourselves with God's very word
[4:33] our hearts and souls with Revelation
[4:35] stirred
[4:37] behold
[4:39] the secret of the ages
[4:42] displayed through us as living pages
[4:46] where scriptures clear to catch the
[4:48] bride
[4:49] they led us to our husband's side
[4:53] the invisible Union bride to bride and
[4:56] bride to Christ
[4:58] no longer tossed in darkness Gloom
[5:01] United forever
[5:03] the mythical Church
[5:05] the bride the selected
[5:08] LED it to deeper thoughts and higher
[5:11] objectives
[5:13] his coming happened the word effective
[5:17] the change of our bodies
[5:19] the Rapture the final directive
[5:22] Lord bless you all
[5:24] foreign
