TRANSCRIPT
========================================
would have looked down on and and and said who who is this person who is Elijah the wild man that is is gird about with camel skins and eats locusts and and honey who is this wild man who is this this fanatic John the Baptist down on the river baptizing people unto repentance who who is this guy he's a wild man put him in jail and and he went into jail and you know it was fine for him to be there but look at the persecution that came against water baptism then and look at the persecution that came against water baptism in our day it's the same thing it's the same Spirits it's good and evil continually battling Satan knows that if if if if the children get the true revelation the true church gets the true revelation of the Antichrist Spirit within the framework of where the denominational world no within the framework of the Christian church if we can get that Revelation how do we get that Revelation brothers and sisters to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but outside of following the program outside of having the desire to actually come according to the word aside from having the ability to set aside our pride and say I I don't have any Pride I've got nothing to lose I I have nothing on my own I'm willing to actually see I want to see Jesus if we're willing to do that then he'll reveal himself to us he doesn't reveal himself to the proud does he no he reveals himself unto babes such as would learn but you know Pride the original sin in heaven that's the thing that gets in the way of everyone being able to get truly baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptized according to the word which is what will actually give you the ability to see the revelation of Jesus Christ in our day but you know the people who actually get that are the ones that just set aside all of their pride in all of their Theology and all of their teachings and thinking and and belief structures and say you know just like we said we preached out a little while ago I'll probably read it again today but you know Mary she couldn't go through her catalog of Theology and say well you know it's got to be according to this because I was taught that and unless the other thing no she said you know how can this be but hey there stands Before Me an Angel messenger and he's giving me a message that I'm highly favored brothers and sisters we've had an angel messenger in our day that has come to say that you are highly favored of God and the only thing you have to do is say be it unto me according to Thy Word you're the angel of God a messenger from God but Satan has caused so much confusion around a messenger from God so many people you know brother Bradham he preached at false anointed ones at the end time there will be many christs which is out of the word many christs anointed ones ones that will actually come as an angel of Light thou claim the message of the hour they won't just claim Christ they won't just claim the Bible but they'll claim the message of the hour false anointed ones we need to be very cautious very careful brothers and sisters there's only one Angel Messenger to this age if we start following some other guy that claims to have some Edge on the message of the hour he's a false anointed one that might be real strong but it's real true because the only thing a true anointed one will say is follow Christ that's all and that's exactly what the seventh angel messenger said follow Christ but you know he comes he comes to his own and when his own see him they say beat unto me according to Thy Word that light flashes across that seed this woman said this is Brother Brown I'm speaking in a Christ of mystery I'm looking for a messiah and when that Messiah comes he'll do the very same thing he'll tell us these things he'll he'll understand that you know I have a longing in my heart from a little girl I just I just wanted to have someone that would love me someone that would appreciate me someone that would actually just just cherish me as a wife that would say that that that you're highly favored to me but because I didn't have a good relationship with my dad because things didn't work out when I was a little girl I went looking for that relationship somewhere else and I found it in a man I thought at one time in my life and that man he didn't turn out to be a very good man he mistreated me he treated me wrong he did me real wrong and because of that I left him and I went to survive and I raised my kids on my own and as I did that I found someone else and he began to treat me nice and so I got with him and I lived with him for a certain time and then I found that he was wrong and then I found another man and I thought maybe he would be the one that would actually treat me right and found out that he was wrong and I went on and here she finds herself now in a real fix at the end of her life grown up her children probably raised believing that there's just nothing for her in this world but still having a belief deep down inside that there is a messiah going to come and maybe maybe he would be the one that would give that life to me that would give that love to me that that that that thing that I just longed for so much in my soul still holding on to a belief in her heart and to just be going about her business to just be living her life not even looking anymore just going to draw water as it was custom for the ones who maybe weren't the cherished ones the ones who maybe were looked down upon from the city here she goes just about her daily business and while she's doing it what happens the word itself comes to her I just wonder how many of us today have been doing that in our own lives and have had the word itself come to us but you know brothers and sisters we've got to be able to recognize the word when it comes to us we can't look at it through our own teaching we can't look at it through our own traditions we can't look at it Through The Eyes of denomination or we'll miss it we've got to look at it through our own heart and when we do that then he will speak to us this woman had a conversation with the Lord Jesus Christ can you imagine that it was for an example brothers and sisters so many times we see scriptures and and one one man can be named in one scripture and what an honor and a privilege it would be to have your name as one scripture but to look at how many verses this conversation goes on about this woman my goodness he'll tell us these things he says he said I am he she was longing for this she was longing in her heart that there had to be a truth somewhere in this world of of sin and Corruption and and confusion and frustration there had to be some truth in this world somewhere and to have him say to her I am he brother Branham says oh Lord she left her pot here he was come see a man who's told me the things what was it it was that light that struck that seed only those who the father has given me will come that light it struck that seed that was placed in her from before the foundation of the world my goodness that light struck the seed he says that life was there it come forth and imagine after he discerned her heart she didn't care anymore about the water she didn't care anymore about what the people thought about her she didn't care anymore about anything because she found that one person that one thing that she longed for her entire life to give her that love in a moment in the twinkling of an eye she was raptured into that Revelation she got it and what did she do she ran right back into the City and told everyone about the man come and see a man who told me the things that I have done would she have ever done that before if she never met Messiah she wouldn't go and tell anyone about the things she'd done she was one of the shunned remember it's tremendous to think about it that that light it struck the seed it's no different today brothers and sisters he'll come right to where we are he will do that the story of of of maybe even just um I'll just say it this way in in our life having a business we have an employee and and and to have an employee there who is going to have a brain bleed and you know what he has the opportunity one time in his life to fellowship with the word maybe he's dealt with other believers I I don't know we we interact in our lives every day and you know what how the Lord comes to those people in this world today is through you and I brothers and sisters that's his choice and outside of that you know brother Branham says it somewhere that we are the only Christ that this world will ever see to think about that and you know the people who actually don't get the word from us again brother Branham says it maybe not exactly like this but he says it that we will be responsible for those people that don't actually come to the fullness of the word those people that actually wind up before the white Throne of judgment for not testifying of of the Lord Jesus Christ in our life Maybe by misrepresenting it maybe by not actually talking about it at the right time who knows maybe by not doing the right business deal at the moment we don't know whether Bradham says same thing today he's going on and Christ is the mystery I'll just go back and read that that light struck the seed that life was there it come forth same thing today but the theologians say now wait just a minute I'll find out if so and so if Pastor Moody said he says what's Pastor Moody Got to Do with It I'm going to jump ahead here for a second I I said it before and I found it astounding and and I still find it astounding brother Bradham says what caused the people to actually become misled throughout the ages what what caused them to become misled he says it in this message here he said fallen angels fallen angels and he says what fallen angels and he says Luther Wesley Arrhenius it's pretty amazing but you have to actually go further to hear what he's actually saying about that he's not saying that those Messengers were Fallen Angels he's saying that Fallen Angels got in underneath their Ministry and actually Twisted the words slightly and caused a denomination to happen under that message it's pretty astounding when you look at it because if he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever his program is the same he says it right here it's the same thing today but theologians say hold on a second I'm going to go and actually search out what what what what this Pastor said or what brother so and so said instead of allowing the word to wash over them hold on a second my theology is actually going to take control here not Revelation not the Lord Jesus Christ it's pretty amazing when you look at it that way but but brother Bradham says that it's fallen angels that actually caused this confusion to happen it's astounding when you look at it they come in right after the message the Fallen Angels come right in to where it's so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible it's not out there it's not the Catholic church it's not the Baptists or whatever it's right here brothers and sisters so close that it would deceive us if it were possible but if we've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins there is a promise unto us where we shall receive the Holy Ghost and when he the spirit of truth comes into our own lives he will lead us into what into all truth he won't let us be be led astray brother Branham says same thing today but now the theologians say now wait just a minute I'll find out if so and so if Pastor moody or or what's Pastor Moody got to do with this today Pastor Moody lived in his day but not now certainly not Luther lived in his day but in the day of Wesley but not in the day of Wesley he says Wesley lived in his day not in the day of Pentecost Pentecost lived in their day but they were a long ways from this in this hour We're in the last hour sure their organizations and scrupled up proves that it's not there the word has never been correctly Vindicated just only in its strength seeds denominations and they make denominations and then put them old gyms and weed seeds in with that genuine wheat hybrid it get them in there to choke it out he said that's right green Briars and nettles went on back to that it died right out then they broke the field up and started over again planted some real seeds and some of them come up and choked it out excuse me at the beginning of this quote here brother Branham says same thing today but the theologians say now wait just a minute when people do that they stop the power of God right there in their own lives when when we hear about the message of the hour because really honestly truly everyone's heard of Jesus Christ for the most part right there's all kinds of of Christian Church all over the world the Roman Catholics have done an outstanding job of that Jesus Christ is everywhere and what's not everywhere is the word of the hour the message of the hour and and it's almost everywhere but it's the message of the hour the message under the seventh angel messenger that's what will actually bring the culmination of all the ages together but that is the message of the hour is Jesus Christ coming and sitting down saying give me a drink and we have the opportunity to say whoa wait a second I don't know if I want to talk to you because I don't know if I believe it the way you believe it that's why I said at the beginning brothers and sisters there's people out there that they might actually be true Sons and Daughters of God but they just haven't been shown the true life of Jesus Christ through some sort of a denominational belief I took a look at uh at old old Websters Noah Websters uh dictionary and I looked up the word theology and and I found it astounding it's one of those words so I'll just read it this morning remember brother Branham says it here same thing today that seed that light flashes across the seed and that seed comes to life he says same thing today but the theologic theologians say now wait just a minute I know that light flashed across I know something just happened here but wait just a minute I just want to check it up I just want to see and not check it up with the word but check it up with what Pastor so-and-so says the theology so I looked up that word theology it says the science of God and divine things or the science which teaches the existence or character and attributes of God his laws and government the doctrines we are to believe and the duties we are to practice theology theology consists of two branches this is where it gets good natural and revealed natural theology is the knowledge we have of God from his works by the light of Nature and of reason revealed theology is that which is to be learned only from revelation only from revelation we're not looking at natural theology here and that's the difference I believe brothers and sisters we can actually start to begin taking the message of the hour and creating a natural theology with the message of the hour and say that I've got all the quotes and I know exactly where this this was quoted and exactly how it was quoted and what it was quoted about we can have all of that but if we don't have the revelation we miss exactly what he said we're not talking about natural Theology of the message of the hour we're talking about spiritual theology here it has to be spiritual we know that Jesus said to Peter Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed that unto you Peter but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed it unto you and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it not not talking about natural theology that that we get through nature and and that we understand through through the Flesh and and what we see in terms of light no way no it's not a natural carnal thing it's Christ revealed to you the individual personally but when that happens it's just like the woman at the well something happens finally we see that that one person that one thing that we've longed for our entire lives come to us and reveal himself to us personally revealed theology is that which is to be learned only from revelation it has to be Christ revealing himself to us personally you know talking about the woman at the well verse 13 Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall never thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst again but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life totally talking about a revelation although it's a natural substance they're speaking about many people would say there's no way that the water could actually do that and truly it wouldn't be able to do that there was another one that that Jesus talks about over in John chapter 7 if you want to turn over there John chapter 7. we could probably start with verse 36. John chapter 7 verse 36. what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and and where I am hither ye cannot come in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood up and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink what were we gonna drink some people would have said he already said unless you eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood you have no part in me right unless you come unto me and drink and then he says in verse 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said not theology hath said on this he that believeth on me as a scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water how many people that believe on him as the scripture saith see out of their mouths rivers of Living Water we're not talking about a natural thing here we're talking very specifically about a personally revealed revelation of who the Lord Jesus Christ is through the prophet of the hour in Jesus day there was a prophet declaring there's one coming that I'm not even worthy to loose the latchets on his sandals but I must decrease so that he could increase and we know the same thing happened in our day brothers and sisters and when we hear the word for our day what do we do with it what what do we do with this Jesus that we call Christ the anointed one for our day what do we do with him do we accept him and say just like Mary be it unto me according to thy will or no hold on a second I I I'm just going to confirm it with with Pastor so and so and we'll see if he believes such and such you know there's no greater Revelation in this age than what the prophet for our day brought no greater revelation every Revelation that is truly of Christ will fall under the message of that hour and the simplest form we always go back to it but let's just do it for a moment the simplest form is Noah it's going to rain God gave me instructions to build a boat and whoever wants to live get in the boat that's all you got to do is just get in the boat and you know it's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters we say it over and over again but it's true all you need to do is get the Holy Ghost but it's not for everyone to get the Holy Ghost I'm coming to that Revelation myself it's not for everyone to get the Holy Ghost only a few people those ones that he has called are the ones that are predestinated to get the Holy Ghost there's going to be a lot of people that actually are around there's there's there's there's wise virgins and unwise virgins and they're all virgins but only some of them will have oil when that shout goes forward behold the bridegroom cometh you know there's no time frame in that in that in that in that that story of the the wise and the foolish virgins there's no specific time frame given we know there's a shout a voice and a trump out of Thessalonians we know that brother Branham said that the Rapture is a process the end of the world is a process it's not going to be Clockwork it's not going to be exactly what the theologians say it's not going to be according to Natural Science The Book of Revelation already has parts of it fulfilled and and that's the way it is God will actually just just reveal himself how he will and not everyone is actually called to get the true baptism of the Holy Spirit but those people who are they will everyone will come not one of his will be lost but the Branham goes on to say but then God said in this last days he'd bring out a people washed in his blood and they were predestinated to be there they've got to be there God said so I just believe that that's all of the people who truly believe the message of the hour those people who reject the mark of the beast by accepting the mark of the spirit by accepting the holy ghost in your life and we know that to resist the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to say that maybe I just can wait I I don't know maybe I could get baptized at a later date I don't know maybe God will reveal it to me in a little bit greater way or whatever do you know what brothers and sisters potentially you're putting yourself in a position where you're actually hanging on to or or maybe not sealing out the mark of the beast brother Branham said it that if you reject the Holy Ghost you accept the mark of the beast it is that simple and really it's terrible not everyone will be lost I'm not saying that there might be people that will be saved we know that the five un unwise virgins the foolish virgin is what the word says those ones Will Truly find themselves in eternal life but they'll have to go through the not whole sideways they're going to go through the tribulation and and you know there's going to be Sorrows that have never been known on the face of the Earth in that situation not one of us wants to go through that why would we ever put ourselves in a position where we would go through that why would we resist the Holy Ghost why would we do that it doesn't make any sense but you know what it's not for everyone if you have been given the ability to receive the Holy Ghost we have reason to shout we have reason to do cartwheels we can be like gymnasts like Olympian gymnasts to think that God chose me from before the foundation of the world to be a recipient of the greatest honor ever given to a human being in this earth and that is to be able to speak to God himself not through a pastor not through a pope not through a prophet but the ability to recognize that I'm truly a son and if I'm a son that I can approach my daddy and say hey I have a need and and I desire to hear from you he says and they were predestinated to be there they've got to be there God said so and it would reveal and the Very sign he says I was Malachi for and what he would do restore back again restore back all the years that the Palmer worm that the canker worm all the years going back to our story this morning all the years that that first will say all the years that maybe that that woman at the well missed out with her dad in her relationship he will restore it all back again all of the years that that woman suffered under the hand of her first husband thinking that she would find the love that she longed for all of the years that she suffered under the second husband and the third husband and the fourth husband and even the fifth one all of the years all that she had lost he will restore he would restore I had a conversation in my life one time when I had just become a Christian and I really wanted to grow in the word and see the word grow in me I had a brother say to me you know what I believe that God could restore back everything that you have lost everything that you missed in your life and I'm standing here now as a witness before God to say hallelujah it's true he did restore he did prophesy in the moment he is a God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but you have to unreservedly accept him you've got to be willing to go all the way you can't just be reserved and say I'm going to run whatever it is I hear through my former theology I'm going to take whatever it is I hear preached and say I'm going to run it through brother so and so even though he claims to believe the message he maybe doesn't have the full revelation of it yet can't do that Brothers and Sisters You've got to be willing to run it through the word amen you've got to be willing to run it through the profit we've got the ability to take any thought that we hear or or capture anything that has to do with the word and just put it in a message search and let it run through the message and see what the prophet says about it and there's some things that he doesn't talk about in there you know what happens when you have a question like that ask God just just go on our knees and ask God that's all we have to do and you know what he will reveal it to you many times he'll give us an answer that we don't want to hear many times we ask for an answer that will just suit our needs the word in in the Book of James I believe it is says that when we ask we ask a mess because we look to consume it upon our flesh upon the lusts of our flesh we want to serve this body in in this natural theology how we believe that we perceive things and that's not the way we're supposed to do it we're supposed to say he gave us instruction how to pray when his disciples asked him didn't he Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come Thy word be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread you know he gave us real Specific Instructions Not My will but thy will let Thy word come forward in my life if we could just pray that way then we wouldn't ask to consume the things on the lusts of our flesh then many times I believe it that we wouldn't hear the word no and sometimes we don't hear the word no most times in fact we just don't see an answer come the way we want it to but that doesn't mean that God hasn't answered our prayers God answers our prayers every single time he hears our prayer and he answers them and and you know in the long run he answers our prayers in the way that's best for us so that we can be perfected this story today about the woman at the well just just Thrills me to look at it because it's no different for us today he says that brother Branham says it it's no different today and and if we look at this whole entire story and we just step back for a second and think the prophet of God said that it's no different for today the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word was made flesh and is dwelling Among Us right now and many times the word will come and sit down with us and say give me a drink the word will come and sit down with us and say what's going on many times the word will phone us up and say Hey brother I haven't talked to you for a long time how are you doing it's no different brothers and sisters if you think about it if someone has the Holy Ghost in their life this is where it becomes real confusing and Satan loves to get in and around this and I I just can't get away from it outside of the Holy Ghost we're lost as lost can be it's not an option for a believer it's not an option the Holy Ghost is what we need when we have the Holy Ghost we have Christ we have Jesus Christ in our lives when we talk to our brothers and our sisters we are talking to Jesus Christ in flesh when we think about our brothers and our sisters we're thinking about Jesus Christ in flesh we need to take every thought into captivity brothers and sisters not take it for granted no that's just brother so and so that's just sister so and so that's just their way that's how they are no way if they're believers we need to treat them like they're Jesus Christ you know what brother Branham says we know it I'm just going to say it though he says that when we actually talk about someone we potentially damage them we're having a conversation last night just about the the power of the spoken word in our own lives and I've learned this I have we can talk about someone because of the way their nature is I've experienced this in my own life so this is just me talking and I can I can I can talk because I've experienced it if somebody wants to give a testimony we'll give them the microphone they can do the same but it's got to be word based and you know what when you speak about someone you give them the ability to succeed or to fail the words on our lips if we have the Holy Ghost in our lives are powerful brothers and sisters where do spirits travel do we know Spirits travel on words if you get a minister up here who is a pastor or a minister and they speak words that's mostly truth but but but partially not it's the same thing as the serpent speaking to Eve in the Garden of Eden he has the ability to minister death unto the camp and there's people that will actually become in Peril because of it there's people who are unstable what I'm saying is we have the ability to actually help people or hinder people and whether we understand it or not it's a spiritual principle if we talk positively then we cause positive to come back to us I'm not preaching psychology I'm preaching the third pull here this is the power of the spoken word if we will say good about our brother and our sister guess what will happen things might change in the way our brother and our sister behave but if we say bad things if we just Grumble if we murmur remember we talked about murmuring if we have the low guttural tone about brother so and so and for sister so and so and that's just the way they are guess what they're gonna do they're gonna be that way but if we have the ability to say no I don't think they meant that that way I just know that maybe they do have maybe uh maybe they've got a genetic disposition to a bad temper and they didn't mean to actually fly off the handle and I know that the Lord Jesus is dealing with them and I I know that they love the Lord and I know that if we ever stood Before the Throne of mercy and Grace together that they would just put their arms around me and say I sure love and appreciate you brother I know that's the Son of God I know that's a sister of God I I know it's my brother or my sister and and they don't mean it the way that someone said it or or the way that I perceive it all the time if we start doing that brothers and sisters we could change the outcome of situations we have the power of creation we've got the power to speak a world into existence and go and inhabit it but it won't do us any good but that power is already right there we sing that song the power is already in the sky all you have to do is spread your wings and just let that power that's there just take you up like an eagle brothers and sisters we have the power to do that today with the message of the hour by just saying you know what I'm just going to speak the word I might not understand it but I'm just going to profess it I'm going to confess positive moving forward that's all I'm gonna do I'm going to confess positive about the people at school the principal the teachers the the people that I don't don't like me at all I'm just going to confess positive about them and I'm gonna see what happens try it see if the Lord won't back it up we know that God is not negative Satan is negative we've talked about it at length probably to the point where it just wears some people and I apologize if it does but you know brothers and sisters we are only going to speak one of two thoughts in our lives we are only going to speak what the Lord Jesus Christ puts in our mind or we're going to speak what Satan puts in our mind that's why the word says to take every single word into captivity did you ever notice how you get around some people and the only thing they want to do is talk about other people and criticize other people you know what that is that's a spirit brothers and sisters I got caught up in that in my life and it's weird because I I again just talking about myself here I'm not narcissistic believe me but just because I've experienced it people sometimes that's all they can do is talk about other people and in a negative context and it doesn't do anything any good it doesn't do anybody any good the people who are hearing it that have nothing to do with the situation it makes them feel rotten it makes them feel bad the people who actually you're talking about no doubt spiritually speaking it makes them feel bad and they don't even know why we wrestle not against flesh and blood brothers and sisters but against powers of Darkness spiritual wickedness in high places principalities and Powers is what we're wrestling against that's why we need to put on the whole armor of God and not allow Satan to have any any room in our lives and you know we can we can stop right now in our tracks and say you know what Lord forgive me if I have done that Lord just forgive me and you know what he will he will and we can go forwards in a positive way I was thinking about this too you know and I want to throw it out there I'll probably start sprinkling this out there as we go forwards brothers and sisters I know I preached on it for a while but I just want to say it plainly and clearly as we go forwards and we begin to have communion Services don't wait for a communion service to go and deal with ought if you have something against a brother or a brother has something against you or a sister or a sister or a child a child whatever it is will we tarry one for another start right now Terry right now Terry one for another so that when we come to the communion table we don't eat and drink damnation unto ourselves don't make it a thing where we have to you know maybe in 30 seconds or a minute before the pastor says okay let's change the order of the service and now go to the communion table no do it right now don't make it right let the power of the Holy Spirit just wash over you like the water of the word and just watch the The Liberation happen in your life and your brother or your sister's life when you go and you make something right it changes everything you have the potential if there is something in your life to actually change the outcome of a service maybe maybe I'll just say this I don't know because I don't know all the Dynamics between the people I know people have a hard time getting together and we've said it before that there's such a different Dynamic of people here from all kinds of walks there's very educated Highly Educated very high earning people to maybe people like me that are very low educated that don't really know very much about anything and everyone in between and Naturally Speaking we would never Fellowship together but you know what brings us together is the fellowship of Christ the word for our day and if we have the ability to overcome Satan by Discerning and withstanding the Antichrist spirit that would try and creep into the framework of the Christian Church Satan will be powerless before us brothers and sisters imagine that if Satan could be powerless before you this morning well he can be it's not just a pipe dream the prophet for our day prophesied it he spoke the words and nothing will stop God's word from coming to pass nothing we have the ability to see Satan powerless before us tarry one for another don't wait for a communion service and don't wait and think that maybe I'll just go make it right after go do it now do it right now we don't know what tomorrow holds but what I was getting at is we have the potential to impact the way a service happens maybe brother so and so maybe brother Barry is going to come and preach again and I just pray Lord send us someone that can feed us maybe that's on our heart you know what brothers and sisters just examine your life I'll say this just examine your life is there any ought there is there anything in your life that maybe you could just make a little bit better according to the word because if there is just see if God won't take brother Berry and change him in such a way that he'll be able to preach the word that will sustain you in a way that you'll be able to say bless the Lord O my soul and all of it soon within me because I can see that the Lord answers prayer that's the God we serve I know many times we want to see a great sermon preached but you know really that sermon is totally dependent on the people we could be as most prepared as as as we could ever be and come and it's a complete fight just a struggle just like wading through a swamp up to your waist all the way from from the end of the song service right to the very last word that sung in the last song just a slug to get through it why because there's differences in ideas differences in thoughts differences in beliefs people with ought this that this that but if we can come in unity of spirit and just push aside all of the garbage all the nonsense is what brother Branham says if we can just quit all the nonsense and just see God move in our in our Lives who knows what could happen brothers and sisters remember we talked about the quote that brother Branham said and you'd be able to find it based on this one one name he said I'd invite any Spirit to walk through the door from any Joe Lewis if you look up that word Joe Lewis I believe is what it is he challenged any spirit that would walk through that door to a group of believers who truly believe the word for their day who truly are filled with the Holy Ghost in one mind and one Accord in unity of spirit endeavoring to keep the bond of Peace not just saying we just rub shoulders and we've got the bond of Peace no but endeavoring to keep the bond of Peace somebody offended me and I'm not going to let Satan get between us I'm going to run to him and say brother you said this and I feel that can we just make it right somehow endeavoring to keep the unity of spirit that environment brother Bradham said you could challenge any Spirit to come through that door anybody with any disease Bring It On come through that door and just by the entrance of that person into the group they would be healed in the name of Jesus Christ could you imagine that brothers and sisters that's exactly the message for our day that's where we live that's the power of Christ Living out through the Believers and that's the one that came and sat down and sat beside that woman at the well that day and told her the things that she had done he's the same yesterday today and forever brothers and sisters when we hear the word preached in season when we hear the word of God preached by the prophet for our day and we we speak those words it's the same one it's Jesus Christ coming and sitting down with us once again if you could imagine we could we could put it up on the leg and get brother Logan to just bring up a picture here I'm not saying do it but we could if you could Envision it a well and and and a picture of Jesus coming and sitting we could even do a little actual waterfall here and and then visualize Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever coming and sitting down and fellowshipping with us you know we have the power to pull on the gift doesn't matter who's preaching we have the power to pull on the gift to get that excuse me that gift to bring the sermon right off their notes and go right off the main trail and go right on the back road deal with exactly what's on our hearts if we have the ability to surrender to God we can totally have the minister Minister directly to our need because brothers and sisters this isn't play time here this isn't coming to church and hoping that brother Berry has something to say we should be hoping that the Lord Jesus Christ is going to come and sit down by my well today and speak to me sovereignly about my exact need and if we don't see it that way then brothers and sisters I think that maybe we should just consider why would we bother coming to church it needs to be that personal he wants to minister to us he wants to speak to us he wants to give us the ability to rise remember we read that quote that he's just waiting for the church in the last days to rise and accept what he's already done for us he's given us the ability to overcome Satan he's given us the ability to thwart Satan exactly the same way as thwarted as he was in the desert with Jesus when he came to tempt Jesus we could be so hidden in Christ that Satan can't even find us we can be so hidden in Christ so consumed by the word so saturated with the word for our day that even when he does find us he doesn't know what to do with us because we speak the word so strongly to him we might not yell it and I'm not getting crazy because I'm screaming I'm getting crazy I'm screaming because I'm excited to think that we have the ability to be there to be able to discern and withstand that Antichrist spirit that would creep into the Christian Church into the framework of the Christian church right and try and defile it and make it lukewarm and formal and Powerless Mark 16 in action is the true church the only one that he claims has his own and all else is false it's true it's real but I'm not here to judge who is and who isn't I'm only here to encourage I only want to see everybody come to that place I want to see it in my own life I want to be a part of that true church but we know that prophet of Malachi 4 he's come for a purpose and that's to restore all things back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers faith of the apostolic church that we've talked about that church that people wanted to actually come to where they would actually just ask can we give you a handkerchief and can you just place it on your body can you just touch that handkerchief to you and and then give it back to me so I can take it home and put it on my sick grandmother so she might live or my husband so he might live so he might rise up can you just position me so that when when brother so and so walks down the street that his shadow would just pass over me because if his shadow passed over me I know that I would be healed because he's so full of the holy spirit in his life brothers and sisters we're talking about that church we're not talking about the the Pentecostal fathers the Azusa Street Revival we're not talking about the natural theology here we're talking about spiritual theology the one that's given by Revelation and Revelation only the one that the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against that's what we're talking about that church he said to restore back again to bring back in the last days these great things that he's promised he'd bring the Revelation what is he to do Malachi 4 was to bring back the faith of the fathers to the children see that's right to bring the same thing the same Pillar of Fire on the scene the same signs the same wonders the same Jesus making him the same I just love this part I just love this part so much I'm not going to keep us late today I'll call the musicians now I know that we're 10 minutes too we're going to have service tonight I want to be careful to not weary everyone and I know some people would say why don't you go for another hour and I mean we just want to want to be gentle with the people the same Pillar of Fire on the scene the same signs the same wonders the same Jesus making him the same preaching him the same vindicating him the same yesterday today and forever excuse me I will restore saith the Lord all the years that the Methodist worm the caterpillar worm and the Baptist and the Catholic and all them worms eating that eating that Faith down to become a denominational stump where there's no seed left in there brothers and sisters it can become that way in our lives if we're not careful we can become a denominational stump because we take what we hear and and we want to try and run it through our theology don't try and make the message of the hour theology it's not studied it's revealed it's probably the easiest way to word it it's not studied it's revealed but when it's revealed brothers and sisters and we hear the message of the hour preached when we hear the message of the hour played something happens it's a supernatural happening that Revelation it just comes supernaturally and you know what brothers and sisters the gates of hell can't Prevail against it and you know how because once you truly receive the baptism of the holy spirit in your life there ain't nobody that's ever going to talk you out of it ever ever excuse me stand with me this morning there's no person there's no church there's no sign there's no wonder they can come around and try and tell you we've got something greater we've got something better because you know that you found the pearl of great price he says in all them's worms eating eating that that Faith down to become a denominational stump where there's no seed left in there but I will restore again saith the Lord all the years what all the signs and wonders that they have forsaken that all of the churches have forsaken same thing with this woman at the well he came and told her that I'll restore everything that every one of those men in your life took away from you I will restore it all of the faith that all of those men that you gave to I will give you that back all the signs and wonders that they have forsaken I'll take it right back to that original tree again and I will restore it saith the Lord that prophet has a Vindicated Prophet that Prophet was a Vindicated prophet his words has come to pass amen let's just bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus as we go forwards today we just want to be thankful for what you've given us we do not want to take it for granted Lord to be able to hear the message of the Yahweh Lord to know that you not only will restore but you have restored all the years that have been taken away from us and Lord Jesus how many of us are just like that woman at the well father who who who who at one time in their lives they had faith in someone really important and found that that person let them down and maybe they had faith in someone else and found that that person let them down but Lord Jesus that day when you come when you came on the scene and made yourself known to the individual personally Lord my father I pray that we could just accept you as you are and not try and run you through our theology but to just take you in the fullness of the Revelation for our day Lord I pray that you would bless the words that were spoken today I pray that you would just be with each one father be with each need Lord help us father to tarry one for another that when we come to the communion table we don't eat and drink damnation to ourselves and Lord Jesus I pray that it would just be something that we can't wait to do is come to the communion table because we know that we're following your word for our day Lord we just ask that you would continue watching over your children keep your hand upon each one of us and if it Be Your Will father for us to to have a musician's practice today and to have a service again tonight we pray that you would be with brother Toby that you would just give him a fresh call off the altar Lord that we would have the desire in our hearts to pull upon the gift Lord Jesus to just see what you have to say to us today we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we sing 2186 Love Lifted Me [Music] I
