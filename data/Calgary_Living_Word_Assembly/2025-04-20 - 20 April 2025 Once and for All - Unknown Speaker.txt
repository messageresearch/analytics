TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] And then the stream of pilgrims made their way into Jerusalem to offer up the gold, the lamb and death. Atonement for their sin was made, but only for a season. Their empty hearts still cried out for a lasting peace and love. Then from Bethlehem he came. Remember there was his name. He knew the world would need a sacrifice and a million lambs could never pay the price. Once and for all. He walked the road to Calary, carrying the sins of liberty upon his shoulders once and for all. concl. [Music] And the stream of mercy falls like rain from heaven's holy throne to everyone who calls upon his name. Though we all were sinners, he loved beyond our weaknesses. Though we are worthy, he came to suffer in our place. As his blood fell to the ground, our hope again was found. No longer are we guilty and oppressed. For he is thorough of sin as far as east from the west. Once and for all. He walked the road to Calvary, carrying the sins of liberty upon his shoulders once and for all. He conquered death victoriously, tearing down the searing wall. And the price was paid in full once and for all. He walked the road to Calvary, carrying the sins of every man upon his shoulders once and for all. He conquered them victoriously, tearing down the searing wall. And the price was paid in once and for all. And the price was paid in once and for [Music] all. Amen. Thank you.
