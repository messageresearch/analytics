[50:37] amen the Bible says and Jesus went with
[50:41] and Jesus went with him and much people
[50:44] followed him and thronged him and a
[50:47] certain woman which had an issue of
[50:49] blood 12 years and had suffered many
[50:53] things of many Physicians and had SP
[50:55] spent all that she had and was nothing
[50:59] better but rather grew worse when she
[51:03] had heard of
[51:05] Jesus came in the press behind and
[51:09] touched his garments for she said if I
[51:14] may touch but his clothes I shall be
[51:17] whole and straightway the Fountain of
[51:20] her blood was dried up and she felt in
[51:23] her body that she was healed of the
[51:27] plague and
[51:29] Jesus immediately knowing in himself
[51:33] that virtue had gone out of him turned
[51:36] him about in the press and said who
[51:39] touched my
[51:41] clothes amen let's go to um Galatians
[51:44] chapter
[51:54] 6
[52:01] Galatians
[52:03] 6
[52:05] uh let's start reading at verse
[52:09] 7 Galatians 6 and 7 and then we'll end
[52:12] with Hebrews chap
[52:15] 11 Galatians 6:7 the Bible says be not
[52:20] deceive God is Not mock for whatsoever a
[52:24] man Seth

[52:36] but he that Seth of the spirit shall of
[52:40] the spirit reap life
[52:42] Everlasting and let us not be weary in
[52:46] well doing for in due season we shall
[52:51] reap if we faint not amen now this is
[52:55] our our
[52:56] verse as we have therefore opportunity
[53:00] let us do good unto all
[53:03] men
[53:04] especially unto those who are of the
[53:09] household of faith amen amen amen
[53:13] Hebrews chapter
[53:17] 11 verse
[53:24] 1 familiar we can pretty much quote it
[53:27] without turning to
[53:29] it but the Bible says now Faith is the
[53:32] substance of things hoped for the
[53:35] evidence of Things Not Seen amen may the
[53:39] Lord the bless reading of his word you
[53:40] can have your seats by the grace of God
[53:47] Amen you know tonight you know it's a a
[53:51] what we call a maybe a a off night or a
[53:56] special
[53:59] service but what I want to do by the
[54:01] grace of
[54:03] God I want to challenge
[54:06] you in the service I want to challenge
[54:09] everybody in the
[54:11] service
[54:13] everything that you know and believe
[54:16] about God I want you to believe it can
[54:19] happen in the
[54:21] [Music]
[54:24] serviceall
[54:26] Hallelujah think about what I just said
[54:29] now everything that you know and believe
[54:32] of
[54:33] him what if we would create that kind of
[54:36] atmosphere where everything we've
[54:39] experienced everything that God has done
[54:41] for me now I'm listening to a minister
[54:45] but everything that God has done for me
[54:48] I'm going to put on
[54:50] display that that same God was moving my
[54:53] life in the service yeah amen hallelujah
[54:57] and tonight by the grace of God my my my
[54:59] subject is uh so faith and reap
[55:04] evidence so faith and reap evidence and
[55:08] you know we're going to be talking about
[55:09] you know Faith tonight but uh let's just
[55:13] start by saying what it means to seow
[55:17] Hallelujah when you think about sewing
[55:19] you think about a planting time you know
[55:22] or where you plant in a ground or in a a
[55:25] certain atmosphere wherever you sow you
[55:28] know as a as a as a father you know you
[55:31] seow into your family you know as you're
[55:33] raising children you sew into their life
[55:35] you know you seow what the gospel has
[55:38] done for you and all these different
[55:40] things you
[55:41] seow depending upon believing that what
[55:45] you sow is going to be a manifestation
[55:48] amen hallelujah and the Bible says uh
[55:52] train up a child or raise them up in the
[55:54] way that they should go when they get
[55:55] older it won't depart why because youve
[55:57] sowed the word in their life so we as we
[56:01] sow the kingdom as we seow the word of
[56:04] God we should be looking for the
[56:06] evidences of our faith Hallelujah you
[56:09] know but what does that mean amen
[56:11] there's a law Hallelujah when it comes
[56:13] to Faith you know and and it's an
[56:17] unconscious law Hallelujah you know
[56:19] faith is the substance of things hop for
[56:22] substance of things hop for for it to be
[56:26] a substance it has to be
[56:29] real talk to me
[56:31] church if it's not a substance it's just
[56:34] some Hocus Pocus out there but the Bible
[56:38] says that faith is a true substance and
[56:42] if it's a substance that mean all of us
[56:44] have a right to possess it Hallelujah
[56:49] but you know if I can before I get going
[56:51] Hallelujah I want to you know I've been
[56:54] uh I've been in a in a in a channel
[56:56] where I've been listening to this
[56:58] message perfect Faith over and over and
[57:01] over and over again because he said
[57:03] something in it you know how many knows
[57:06] how rich the word of God is you know you
[57:09] you can hear one man preach about
[57:10] something and then another man come and
[57:12] preach on the same thing and you still
[57:14] get something out of it you know why
[57:17] because the word of God does not get old
[57:20] the word of God does not get stale
[57:22] Hallelujah the word of God it keeps a
[57:26] fresh anointing on it but what what what
[57:29] what makes it live and what makes it
[57:32] move is the way we perceive it
[57:34] Hallelujah right and you know a lot of
[57:36] times we hear things and we're like well
[57:38] you know I didn't heard that before
[57:39] remember I said Put it on display
[57:42] tonight everything that you know of God
[57:45] everything that you believe of God put
[57:47] it on display tonight in the service
[57:50] church and if we could just do that if
[57:51] we could just sow some faith in the
[57:53] service tonight Amen brother J what are
[57:55] you saying I don't want Hallelujah your

[58:13] inside of you tonight and if you give me
[58:16] Faith I guarantee you God will y speak

[58:52] your faith Hallelujah not only what I
[58:54] want to catch it we want to bring our
[58:57] perfect Faith amen because the prophet
[59:00] of God and I'm going to read it the

[59:04] into something that's
[59:06] real let's get to make believe out the
[59:08] church and get into something real and
[59:11] move into real Apostolic times what is
[59:15] Apostolic times the book of Acts
[59:19] Hallelujah where the men of God Walk
[59:22] with the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[59:25] it was an Evidence in their life
[59:27] wherever they went they saw what the
[59:30] revelation of Jesus Christ and the
[59:32] evidences of what they believe
[59:33] Hallelujah became a
[59:36] manifestation and we are no
[59:38] different only thing that makes us
[59:41] different Is How We
[59:43] Believe Hallelujah but look Hallelujah I

[1:00:39] down buildings and all these things and
[1:00:41] Birds Go High when that storm is over
[1:00:43] that law is still in that
[1:00:46] bird Hallelujah and it will operate in
[1:00:50] the storm After the Storm before the
[1:00:53] storm Hallelujah
[1:00:55] the trial cannot change the law that was
[1:00:58] put inside the bird amen hallelujah amen
[1:01:02] amen amen the storm can't take it away
[1:01:06] the storm can hinder Hallelujah when it
[1:01:09] flies but it can't stop it from
[1:01:12] flying Hallelujah and some birds are so
[1:01:15] smart and so strong they fly above the
[1:01:19] storm
[1:01:22] W Hallelujah

[1:01:36] backwards amen and as it hits it fall it
[1:01:39] stride those wings come out and that law
[1:01:43] takes over in that fall

[1:01:49] takes over in his fall Hallelujah and

[1:03:11] stage it was interpreted Hallelujah

[1:07:30] hallelujah we're getting to something
[1:07:32] amen cuz you know the prophet of God say
[1:07:35] we live below our
[1:07:37] means and you know I hardly ever I
[1:07:39] hardly never preached like this uh uh on
[1:07:43] asking God you know because we have
[1:07:47] every scripture not to do it
[1:07:50] publicly you say no no you know God God
[1:07:53] you know sometimes I think it' be the
[1:07:55] devil stopping us from operating in
[1:07:59] spoken word Authority because we have
[1:08:01] things we desire of God then and and you
[1:08:04] want to speak it and the devil will come
[1:08:07] I I hate to say it's the devil but you
[1:08:09] know uhh reasoning will come and say
[1:08:12] well God knows what you stand in need of
[1:08:13] before you can ask that's
[1:08:16] right us Lord but then there's another
[1:08:18] scripture say ask that your joy may be
[1:08:21] full so which one are you going to
[1:08:23] listen to do you have a need or not he
[1:08:27] said ask and it shall be given seek and
[1:08:31] you shall find knock and the door shall
[1:08:33] be open unto you Hallelujah but too
[1:08:36] often Hallelujah we ask and something
[1:08:39] doesn't happen and then we get
[1:08:41] discouraged but the scripture says he
[1:08:43] ask Hallelujah but you don't
[1:08:46] believe see so are we really sowing
[1:08:49] faith when we come to God asking
[1:08:53] Hallelujah amen and even when we asking
[1:08:55] Church let's realize this there's a law
[1:08:58] into it Hallelujah he says and it shall
[1:09:02] be given unto you hallelujah oh my but
[1:09:06] there's one I love Hallelujah when it
[1:09:08] when you're dealing with the law of
[1:09:10] asking God or sowing and reaping
[1:09:12] Hallelujah there's a scripture
[1:09:14] Hallelujah I think that we need to
[1:09:17] understand works for our benefit there's
[1:09:19] a scripture that says give yeah amen
[1:09:25] and it shall be given unto
[1:09:30] you hallelujah oh my that's good and how
[1:09:34] often God tells us to give to bless one
[1:09:38] another to do something to S into
[1:09:40] somebody's life we like Lord I just say
[1:09:43] I got this I got that I got this I got
[1:09:46] that instead of you sewing
[1:09:49] Faith you live in your
[1:09:52] doubt but the scripture says give and it
[1:09:55] shall be given unto you Hallelujah and
[1:09:58] the Bible also speaks about how blessed
[1:10:01] it is to
[1:10:03] give amen amen some people don't even
[1:10:07] realize the only reason why you're
[1:10:09] blessed is so that you can be a
[1:10:14] blessing
[1:10:16] Hallelujah Church let's understand
[1:10:19] Father Abraham he says I'll bless those
[1:10:22] that bless you Hallelujah he says I'll
[1:10:24] bless your going out and I bless your
[1:10:26] coming in he says Abraham you're blessed
[1:10:29] to be a blessing Hallelujah and if that
[1:10:32] was Father Abraham so are we
[1:10:35] Christianity is what living for others
[1:10:38] how often are we sowing into somebody
[1:10:41] else's
[1:10:42] life and it ain't always about money
[1:10:45] maybe God puts somebody in your heart
[1:10:47] and you supposed to sew in their lives
[1:10:49] in
[1:10:50] prayer
[1:10:52] hallelujah how many ever pray for
[1:10:54] somebody and then you saw him and you
[1:10:56] saw what you prayed
[1:10:57] about show faith and reap
[1:11:01] evidence
[1:11:03] amen but too often we're thinking
[1:11:07] about
[1:11:12] self amen I've seen God do some powerful
[1:11:16] things when I was in need amen when I
[1:11:21] was in need God tell me to bless
[1:11:23] somebody else and it don't make sense
[1:11:26] Hallelujah y remember one time I was I
[1:11:30] was I was I was riding up the road was
[1:11:31] going to preach I was in the and and and
[1:11:34] I was like Lord I got all these bills I

[1:11:41] duty I'm in my place but I got trials I
[1:11:44] got tribulation I got needs I need
[1:11:46] Jehovah Gyra Hallelujah and you know uh
[1:11:50] uh uh trials don't come because you're a
[1:11:52] sinner right Trials Come Hallelujah
[1:11:55] because you're not perfected
[1:12:02] yet W so every trial Hallelujah is what
[1:12:06] bringing our deity every trial
[1:12:09] Hallelujah is getting the dark cold off
[1:12:11] you why because you're a
[1:12:15] diamond Hallelujah and you know I was

[1:12:22] have maybe one month of
[1:12:26] surplus maybe one month where the bill
[1:12:28] collectors didn't take it all or I pay
[1:12:30] everything up and then this new bill
[1:12:32] just comes from
[1:12:34] someplace you know and God said to me
[1:12:38] give I'm like
[1:12:40] huh I'm praying to you about a blessing
[1:12:43] you tell me to give what I ain't
[1:12:47] got let's understand something about

[1:13:22] word from in the past what did God do
[1:13:25] God SW faith into the life of Abraham
[1:13:29] and Abraham had to come up to that word
[1:13:31] and producing
[1:13:35] [Applause]
[1:13:39] evidence and God does that over and over
[1:13:42] and over throughout the scriptures he
[1:13:45] speak a word of faith in his children's
[1:13:46] life knowing we don't believe it

[1:20:03] is a substance not an imagination we're
[1:20:07] not imagining we rolled in a car it

[1:20:13] we're sitting in church I'm really here
[1:20:17] I'm not in South Carolina I'm really
[1:20:19] here in Calgary H I'm present Sister

[1:20:48] Faith but then he comes and he says
[1:20:51] faith Hallelujah he said it's a real
[1:20:53] substance why because faith comes by
[1:20:55] hearing hearing what the word of God how
[1:20:59] many of you hujjah are responding to the
[1:21:02] word of
[1:21:05] God

[1:21:45] dormant faith has to move faith has to
[1:21:48] become a verb Hallelujah if it's not a
[1:21:51] verb is inter
[1:21:53] intellectual
[1:21:56] amen it's just knowledge and knowledge
[1:21:59] is no good because knowledge always
[1:22:01] tries to prove Faith you can't prove it
[1:22:04] hallelujah it's something that you have
[1:22:07] but I can't give it to brother Paul he

[1:22:46] on faith has nothing to do with your
[1:22:49] five
[1:22:50] senses brother Steve the prophet of God
[1:22:52] say once your five senses can declare it
[1:22:56] it's no longer Faith because what the
[1:22:58] five senses try to do is prove God no
[1:23:01] we're not here to prove God we're here
[1:23:04] to believe
[1:23:06] God hallelujah and if we believe God
[1:23:10] he'll prove
[1:23:11] [Applause]
[1:23:16] himself and then again to prove God you

[1:23:46] matter what you go through it'll never
[1:23:48] leave
[1:23:51] you
[1:23:55] ask
[1:23:56] yourself when was the last time your
[1:23:59] faith was so
[1:24:00] stimulated you couldn't hardly contain
[1:24:05] yourself
[1:24:06] hallelujah amen and what what the Devil
[1:24:09] comes and says that's just emotion no
[1:24:12] the prophet of God say
[1:24:13] stimulation stimulation of what
[1:24:16] Revelation am faith is a what
[1:24:20] Revelation Hallelujah I shout because
[1:24:23] what God has already revealed to
[1:24:26] me Hallelujah I don't shout because I'm
[1:24:29] excited I shout because what's been
[1:24:32] revealed and what's been revealed
[1:24:34] Hallelujah makes me
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:39] excited Hallelujah I don't sing to get

[1:24:49] revelation listen everybody all
[1:24:53] right amen he says he says I want you to
[1:24:57] get this now we the church has got to
[1:25:01] lift itself into the power of God so
[1:25:05] unless we're operating in this we ain't
[1:25:07] even in the power of God yet it's just
[1:25:09] intellectual
[1:25:11] amen amen you said really brother DS yes
[1:25:14] y the disciples operated in a level of
[1:25:18] Faith but it wasn't this Faith we're
[1:25:20] talking about until the Holy Ghost came
[1:25:22] amen cuz they healed the sick they
[1:25:24] raised the dead and when Jesus was gone
[1:25:27] they denied the
[1:25:30] faith they couldn't even sew back into
[1:25:32] the kingdom Hallelujah it wasn't real to
[1:25:35] them but when the Holy Ghost came what
[1:25:37] was it a revelation amen first thing
[1:25:40] Peter says this is that yes sir
[1:25:43] Hallelujah now he says now let me sww
[1:25:45] into your life he said what you got to
[1:25:47] do he said the one y'all crucified the
[1:25:49] one y'all killed he is the king of glory
[1:25:52] he's the Lord of lords the all of all
[1:25:54] and he say Peter what me what must we do
[1:25:56] now Peter gets to se he says
[1:26:00] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:26:03] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:26:05] Holy
[1:26:06] Ghost what did he do he sold into their
[1:26:09] life what what did he sow their
[1:26:11] revelation of
[1:26:13] Faith amen faith in who Jesus
[1:26:16] Christ amen hallelujah see when it
[1:26:20] became real after the holy ghost
[1:26:22] Hallelujah it wasn't just something
[1:26:25] intellectual I need Jesus standing right
[1:26:27] beside me for me to operate in this no
[1:26:30] remember the man Hallelujah at the gate
[1:26:31] called Beautiful he's sitting there he's
[1:26:33] needing something he wanted something of
[1:26:35] the five senses Peter said I don't have
[1:26:38] that I don't have no money I don't have
[1:26:41] no gold he said but such as I have
[1:26:44] Hallelujah such as I have I give unto
[1:26:46] you and in an unseen real he spoken
[1:26:49] evidence into his life he said rise up
[1:26:52] and walk hallelujah what did he touch
[1:26:55] him with Hallelujah he didn't touch him
[1:26:57] with his hands he didn't touch him with
[1:26:59] a needle with a pill with some kind of
[1:27:01] Remedy what did he touch him with the
[1:27:03] same thing the woman with the blood
[1:27:05] issue touched Jesus
[1:27:08] with it was what a revelation of who
[1:27:11] Christ
[1:27:12] [Applause]
[1:27:14] is in the name of Jesus rise up and
[1:27:18] walk and the Bible says straight w
[1:27:23] straight way it became what he sold
[1:27:27] became what an
[1:27:29] Evidence then you see them soaring Faith
[1:27:32] all over the place praying for people
[1:27:34] they say hey we know this man was blind
[1:27:36] but now he see
[1:27:39] amen oh
[1:27:43] my when it's
[1:27:45] real evidence is follow amen amen

[2:10:13] omnipotence now we're sewing this is
[2:10:16] your chance to give that faith God gave
[2:10:19] you back to him amen he said this is
[2:10:22] what happened when two omnipotence meet

[2:10:28] omnipotence something's got to shake
[2:10:32] amen when you give back to God the same
[2:10:35] faith that he gave to you what is that
[2:10:37] that's a Clash of the Titans so

[2:11:49] omnipotent Faith she's giving back to
[2:11:53] Christ she's swing back to Christ what
[2:11:56] he gave her so it had to produce an
[2:12:00] Evidence in her life

[2:12:09] there he called her faith omnipotent
[2:12:12] perfect omnipotent Faith she C it by the
[2:12:16] inspiration she app Ed Hallelujah faith
[2:12:19] without works is what
[2:12:21] dead what good is an inspiration if you

[2:13:01] spiritual gloves he said Hallelujah he
[2:13:05] said she had perfect omnipotent faith
[2:13:07] and he was omnipotent see she had
[2:13:12] perfect infinite Faith
[2:13:16] amen
[2:13:21] o Hallelujah you've never heard that
[2:13:24] word infinite used on human
[2:13:28] beings God is the only one that's
[2:13:31] infinite so for her to have infinite
[2:13:34] faith it must be the faith of
[2:13:37] [Applause]
[2:13:40] God and when you Hallelujah have
[2:13:43] infinite faith and you're giving that
[2:13:45] Faith to the infinite one you have to
[2:13:48] receive what you're asking for amen
[2:13:51] that's right you have to receive an
[2:13:52] Evidence
[2:13:54] amen hallelujah come musicians I'm
[2:13:57] coming come on I'm closing come
[2:14:00] musicians she had perfect infinite faith
[2:14:02] in Christ that he was Lord and KN
[2:14:06] whatever he asked God God would give it
[2:14:09] to him in other words she said you just
[2:14:12] speak the word amen
[2:14:16] amen that's what what perfect Faith does
[2:14:19] yes sir it always speaks the
[2:14:23] word back over itself
[2:14:29] amen you just speak the word that's all
[2:14:32] you have to do and whatever you ask God
[2:14:35] God will give it you amen so
[2:14:38] faith and receive
[2:14:40] evidence but I
[2:14:44] love the scripture in Galatians 6 back
[2:14:48] and read
[2:14:53] it cuz sometimes we
[2:14:56] miss we miss what the inspiration is all
[2:14:59] about amen the Bible
[2:15:02] says be not deceived whatsoever you sow
[2:15:06] you shall reap if you sow good you reap
[2:15:09] good if you sow bad you reap bad because
[2:15:12] an evil tree cannot bring forth good
[2:15:14] fruit that's right Hallelujah and a good
[2:15:17] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[2:15:19] fruit hallelujah amen so you reap what
[2:15:21] you sow and church look at the scripture
[2:15:25] the one that jumps out to me where it
[2:15:28] says verse 7 be not deceived God is Not
[2:15:31] mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that
[2:15:34] shall he also reap for he that sth to
[2:15:37] the flesh shall of the flesh reap
[2:15:41] corruption but he that sth to the spirit
[2:15:44] shall of the spirit reap life
[2:15:46] Everlasting and let us not be weary in
[2:15:49] well doing for in due season we shall
[2:15:52] reap if we faint not amen Church don't
[2:15:56] be weary in the trials of life amen
[2:15:59] those trials are there to stimulate your
[2:16:03] faith amen amen cuz remember there's
[2:16:06] levels there's levels of
[2:16:09] Faith
[2:16:11] Hallelujah but what we want we want to
[2:16:14] give back to God his very own faith amen
[2:16:18] Hallelujah but this is the
[2:16:21] verse verse 10 as we have therefore
[2:16:26] opportunity we all have an opportunity

[2:16:46] sew into one another's life right amen
[2:16:48] hallelujah whether it be naturally or
[2:16:50] spiritually but let the inspiration of
[2:16:53] God catch
[2:16:54] [Music]
[2:16:56] you and be that one fully
[2:17:00] surrendered and let the omnipotence of
[2:17:03] God take
[2:17:04] over Church we're not just church

[2:17:10] the unbelief out the church and move
[2:17:12] into something powerful move into
[2:17:14] something
[2:17:16] real h

[2:17:21] that mean there's a level for us that we
[2:17:23] haven't obtained
[2:17:25] yet but it's
[2:17:27] here remember when that tree is this
[2:17:31] big everything that it will ever produce
