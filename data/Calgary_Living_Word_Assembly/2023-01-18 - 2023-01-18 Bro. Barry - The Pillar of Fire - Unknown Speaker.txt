it's titled remind me dear Lord and um there is a quote that I I didn't come across it the first time but I went back to Cena this week and I want to read that first and um but the brand said in the message respects he said I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants lest I should put a stumbling box somewhere in their way I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I shall do something wrong that will cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian I think that was deep and I think it goes with this song remind me dear Lord they may remember that I'm human and humans forget I don't play the guitar so don't be fooled by this but I try a bit the things that I love an old dear to my heart they just borrowed they're not mine at all Jesus only lets

to read from Exodus chapter 14. I won't keep you standing too long before I start talking certainly like to welcome the otoline sisters back with us it's a pleasure to see you I trust the Lord will be your portion and that your family is doing well Exodus sorry Exodus chapter 13. I said 14 didn't I I did it again Exodus chapter 13 verses 21 and 22. and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we know that your scripture has a compound meaning and a compound Revelation and we know father that this word to many would be a mystical word that we read tonight father but we know it's a literal word for the message for our age Lord Jesus and we take it that way and we just accept it the way that you've provided it father we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever and that you change not Lord and father we just love you and we thank you for your word thank you for your leadership and your guidance Lord for not ever taking away that Pillar of Fire Lord Jesus or that cloud we just ask that you would be glorified in all that said and done now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated foreign I'm still contending with the cold and uh certainly thankful for my healing it's a pleasure to be back and uh yeah I have lots to say I just would like to start with greetings from all of the Believers in the Philippines that we met there's such a lovely group of people there tremendous to go and see all of the the saints that we did and we know that we just met a mere few even though we met a lot um there was only just a few that we really had the opportunity to meet brother Danny del mundo um just a wonderful brother brother Ray Soriano his friend and they both are in Manila and have large congregations there um brother Danny tell Mondo he has uh and I think they work together at this as well I shouldn't say that it's all brother Danny but it might be I don't know the entire Dynamics but we we went uh into Manila and then we actually drove out from Manila we went and visited some Churches while we were there and took some services and I just thought it was tremendous to see the format that that's taking place in Philippines and I'm sure that it's that way all over the world but just to see it firsthand is it's second to none the brother goes and witnesses to someone and that that someone receives the message of the hour and takes it to the people and then before long that brother becomes a pastor to the people in his area and before long they start to get together and and create a church they get a church set in order and this comes from brother Danny del mundo he helps them set the church in order to recognize that if there's going to be a local body there needs to be a local commitment it's not just something from without it has to come from within and he teaches them the the tithes and the missions and the offerings and and gets the people to come together and then there's a pastor and then there's deacons and then there's trustees it's the same format that we have here over there but then that group gets established and then someone from that group gets inspired to go and talk to someone else and before long he takes that word to another group that actually gets inspired a brother Rises up and becomes a pastor and starts to speak to the people and before long the just repeat the process and we went from church to church to church that had gone through the that process of people hearing the word of God and actually catching the revelation of the message of the hour and becoming Believers of this word and then suddenly there's this group of Believers looking to put together a church and I don't think I'd seen it in that light before but it's it's tremendous when you can actually go and see the bricks and mortar and a few years ago we had committed to helping in one of the churches there and as the money goes to a place like that the brother Danny del mundo who is sort of the facilitator of it he he distributes the money a little bit here and a little bit here and a little bit here into all these outreaches they get a little bit every now and again but to see the work that can be done with just a tiny little bit of of missions funding is tremendous and you know brothers and sisters when you see it firsthand when you recognize how much maybe just say 50 US dollars actually is in in Filipino pesos but if you take that and and you know you you add a couple zeros and you go to five thousand dollars U.S dollars what what that or Canadian funds however you want to look at it in internationally USD is kind of the the thing so that's why I'm saying it that way but what what five thousand dollars will do for a church is almost build a building half of a building would would be completely built from that kind of investment I think actually I'm wrong probably a whole entire building would be built for that much money it's tremendous and and what it does for the people they go from worshiping in just a shanty to actually having walls and a floor and Chairs set up a building that's very similar to this only there's no windows there's just louvers in the holes where the windows are but anyways we got to go and and see some of these first hand and actually take services at the churches Brother Juan a brother Alvin and a brother ernan and it turns out I think it's brother ernin was a a school time a childhood classmate of brother Mervin is that the right brother Erna no they didn't know each other but they had the exact same teachers and they were in the same school at the same time and so years later as believers they come back together and recognize that they actually have this connection so it's pretty interesting to see um so yeah I'm not going to give an exhortation on what we did in the Philippines tonight if you were looking for a report I'm sorry I'm going to wait for brother Mervin because I know that he will do a much better job than I but uh he definitely will have a lot more information than I have to bring as well I I have to apologize when we were there um I got sick on the first week we went for the two weeks the first three nights and four days we went to an island and just sort of climatized and it was kind of a fun time we had some swimming and and some snorkeling we went on a boat we actually got to do some fishing on a reef which was really interesting that was kind of my speed um but we ate local food and you know we had a wonderful time there but that's where I started to get really sick with a head cold and then I had to go and preach so it's all kind of a blur to me and I don't really want to get mixed up so I'm really going to just go with that tonight and say I'm going to wait for brother Mervin to really get into the details there's some things though that that we saw um which I I think is just amazing actually it's a different world out there it really is and uh you know just two things I'll mention two things I didn't see it with my own eyes but Isaac dot Isaac did and I think brother miles did uh and that was a bat in the evening we pulled into one place we got there at night and uh it turns out they saw a bat that was larger than a raven just gliding underneath the street light and so I thought you know Isaac was telling me this and sometimes children can be exaggerated and I thought you know maybe you're going a little far with this but I looked it up and uh guess we're the largest bat in the world lives and it only lives there and that's in Philippines it has a wingspan of five to six feet and it's called the Golden crowned flying fox and it is literally the largest bat in the world foreign excuse me the other thing they have there which is extraordinary is spiders we had an experience that I I I'll just wait for brother Mervin to get back to really talk about that one but we had a spider in a van I'll just say it that way that was an experience um while I was preaching the last service there I remember I mentioned there's no windows there's just louvers they just have louvers and it was a building quite similar to ours only the back part of it is just open they don't have any doors there's no need for doors and they just had a vestibule at the back and plastic molded chairs on each side so it's quite like a church a normal church that you would see in different parts of the world concrete floors really nice tiled floors but out of this Louver here in the front window I saw a spider that big come through those louvers and it was lightning fast it was so fast I I actually stopped preaching and I said that is a very big spider right there just by the way it moved so fast I don't know what got me the speed or the size but then it went down the wall right beside a sister like our chairs are up against the wall that's how the chairs were there and the sister didn't even Flinch I said sister that spider and and she almost looked at me like she was getting upset that I was you know saying it but I just said okay I wanted to take my phone and take a picture of that thing because it was something else but yeah apparently uh they have spiders that big and I think they call it a huntsman spider I looked it up it's it's frighteningly fast if I was a bird I would be afraid even though I'm not a bird I'm a human I'm still sort of fearful but you know what it did for me is it kind of corrected my equilibrium I guess with spiders because now you know whatever it's a spider right it's a spider it doesn't matter seeing uh seeing Manila was was life-changing on its own just actually seeing the place uh brother Mervin said that it's one-fifth of the geographical size of Calgary but it has a population of 20 million people so the population is very very dense and and the shocking part about it is you see um wealthy and poverty just right beside each other everybody's just trying to make a living and you see shanties all over the place and you see dogs cats it's just it's a third world country it's definitely different but uh I think it would be so good for others to actually go and potentially you know see some of these things um in time we'll see what the Lord has in store it's life-changing to see another world and I think it's incredible and I I was so thankful to the people and and I was as well when we went to Kenya with brother Gilbert when you go and you actually get to meet a brother or a sister that you deal with in the church as your brother and sister when you get to go and meet their people there's something very special about that and to go and meet the people the Filipino people is has just been amazing our lives have been changed forever we're certainly thankful for our healing though I'm still coughing and stuttering a little bit from this cold and and Lisa is just about I would say 99.9 percent better from the the parasite or whatever it is that she got but we're just thankful thankful for the opportunity to go and meet the Believers there you know uh I just would like to take a moment as well and thank the brothers here for the Gilbert brother Toby and brother Emmanuel for stepping in and taking the services keeping Church going you know it really does something to the heart of a pastor I'm learning to know that when you go away we're all pulling for the same goal there isn't Schism in the body there's not someone pulling or pushing jockeying and and you know for me to actually get into YouTube and start really going into the services I'm just saying amen amen amen I and my father are one amen you know what there's a scarecrow there that means there's good eating Brothers and Sisters Let's get in there let's get after it you know what we all have talents God's given us talents and we can use them spiritually and get hung up on that but we all have natural talents as well and we have been given the opportunity to demonstrate that in the workplace in school wherever it is we're at so I just want to say thank you Brothers it means a lot to me and I'm sure it does for everyone I had someone give me the report that they have grown while we were away so that's a tremendous thing to hear from my perspective so thank you so much we preach four Services the second week that we were there and uh the first three services were a real blur for me I didn't sleep much I had a cough I had that cold it was just a it was just a real opportunity to thank the Lord in the midst of the trial because I I just wanted to curl up in a ball but I got to go and preach and uh you know I signed up for it so I certainly was thankful for the opportunity to be able to do it but you know what what I want to do tonight brothers and sisters is just go back to the final service that I preached in Philippines it did something to me and I think it was just such a wonderful wonderful time that we had um you know talking about the Believers I started out with a quote here I'm just going to get into it now if it's all just the same you know brother Bradham he says this and this was sort of something I wanted to say to the people in Philippines I wasn't sure how they were about quotes and and stuff and I I'm so glad they're able to receive the quotes um some people are funny about it some people are funny about the church age book you never really know what you're getting yourself into when you get behind a Pulpit in in different places but they received it very well it's a really difficult thing as well to be able to to preach through an interpreter because you have to go slow and when the anointing strikes you have to hit the brakes it's such a strange thing but you know I read this quote to them out of God in Simplicity in 1963 and I think it applies we could say this anywhere we go now I think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God to be so grateful to God this this will just not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ and every person that comes in may it be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty I just think that's so wonderful it's so applicable it doesn't matter where we go because the building is the building when we were there there was a church an Apostolic church I believe it was an Apostolic church that uh it wasn't Catholic but boy their buildings sure looked Catholic and we know that it's either the message of the hour or the Beast system and you can see the inspiration behind it because the buildings were just unreal so fancy and uh you know there's so much Catholic over there I think that's the predominant religion in Philippines but still when you get around the Believers it's just just like being home we had such a wonderful time talking about our scripture tonight I just want to get into this here and I hope you don't go too long but the uh the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night and isn't it wonderful to think the day in in which we live the age in which we live the word says that it shall be light in the evening time and how is it going to be light we're not looking at the sunlight setting and saying well you know we saw brother Branham cut the top of the pyramid off in junior Jackson's dream and he said stay here and look on this and then he went West and everybody watched him go west and some people followed them West into the sunset that's not the light we're talking about we're talking about the pillar of Fire Light the light that's not on the spectrum of the eyes I would say it's on the spectrum of the heart the pillar of Fire Light that one that once it shines on the heart of a Believer a predestinated seed a life Springs forth something changes in the heart of a Believer and that's why I just think it's so fantastic when you talk about these brothers in the Philippines and I'm sure it's in Congo I'm sure it's in Kenya I'm sure it's in in in Nigeria it's everywhere around the world it's the same gospel it's the same Spirit when someone truly gets that that Pillar of Fire experience in their own life something breaks forth and they can't stop it and they go forth and they actually begin to preach this gospel but what they're doing is sharing the pillar of Fire Light with people and what happens is people get saved that life that seed Gene of God that's in them from before the foundation of the world can't do anything but just Break Forth life and then before long you have another pastor and before long you've got another church you don't go and preach 24 months and have nothing change something happens in the heart of a believer out of Exodus Chapter 14 verse 24. I can just go there for the sake of time 14 24 and it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked down to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians and took off their chariot wheels that they draved them heavily so the Egyptians said let us flee from the face of Israel for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians I had talked about this a while ago and I just couldn't get rid of it so I thought we'd talk about it again tonight and that is this thought that you know he looked at them the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and I believe that's exactly what's going on in our day brothers and sisters he's looking on the host of the Gentile bride through the pillar of fire and the cloud and many times we can look at that cloud and say it's a fantastic Supernatural thing that happened in 1963 over sunset Mountain and sure indeed it was and is but what is it to us today what does it mean to the believer today what does that Pillar of Fire mean to us today is it just a a picture that hangs in the Supernatural Hall of Fame in Washington D.C which I heard actually actually it does hang there today it hasn't changed it's still hanging there in Washington DC as the only supernatural being ever captured on film and what do those things mean to us today I just want to say it this way that that's God looking at us we don't have to hang a picture on our wall to say that God is looking at us what we need to do is just remember that that Pillar of Fire picture is a reminder of this scripture that we're talking about tonight that he took not the pillar took not away the pillar of Fire by night or the pillar of cloud by day from before the people he's kept them before the people throughout all the ages it's exactly according to scripture and even though it's happened in our age people will say well we're too scientifically Advanced to be able to accept it it's got to be a Thor rocket or maybe someone misinterpreted what it is there's got to be some moisture up in the sky but we had a Vindicated prophet in our day say you know what that picture I was troubled at it but God said to me turn it right turn it right and what did he mean turn it right 90 degrees or did he say look at it through the same eyes that I look at it from just like brother Gilbert said I am my father are one but that wasn't brother Gilbert saying that that was God saying to the Church of the Living God recognize your day and its message we're not here to play Church we're here to recognize the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and how did he do it through the pillar of fire through the cloud that's how he came the word coming of the Lord the rest of the world is looking for the 60-foot Jesus for the banisters of Heaven to unwind and all the angels to appear and the cataclysmic crashes and everything to change like they said about Y2K they're looking for that to happen but again the Vindicated Prophet for our day said you know what it's going to be the secret sudden going away of the Bride of Jesus Christ the world's not going to know anything about it she's just going to disappear but I think it's a tremendous opportunity for us to to just brush up our experiences and remember that the prophet also said that it will be scarcely 12 people from this generation that's a shocking thought that means Lord oh my I shudder at that thought help me Lord to get my stuff in order but we know that none of his will be lost none of his will be lost I heard brother Paul mention it that uh and I don't mean to correct I just want to say it this way because to to underpin what you said brother out of 8 billion people in the world he chose us to be the ones to receive this message you look at a city of Manila and see how many people are squished into there it's it's such a a high population in the whole whole country of Philippines I think is 180 million people but what about 8 billion people it won't be 20 million people that are saved I don't think so brother Branham says people say to him but what about all of the ages brother Branham says it yeah it will only be a few out of this age there will be Millions over there but it's going to be from all of the ages that comes it's not going to be Millions just from this age and we know the word talks about five wise and five unwise we're not going to get into that tonight I'm guess I'm just going on a tangent here I apologize but you know talking about this this scripture here out of Exodus 23 verse 20. Exodus 23 verse 20. Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's not changing his way he dealt with the children of Israel this way and he deals with the Gentiles this way or we never would have seen a clout in 1963 we never would have seen a pillar of fire picture those wouldn't have happened verse 20 says behold of gen Exodus chapter 23 verse 20. behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared isn't it a wonderful thought Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever sending an angel before our way to prepare the way for us to prepare the way of the Lord that that Elijah Ministry to prepare a place for us verse 21 says beware of him and obey his voice just listen to him don't try and add to it or take away from it just listen to him provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions from my name is in him that takes away all of the question right there it's not his name we're talking about the Lord Jesus Christ's name Elohim that one that was in the pillar of fire looking at the host of the Egyptians that's who is in him when he says thus saith the Lord verse 22 but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak isn't it interesting I I just dwelled on this and I think I will tonight it's such a powerful thought if if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and then the next words are and do all that I speak so whose voice is it then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites unto the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites and the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off brothers and sisters he's the same yesterday today and forever if we will listen to his voice recognize that it's not his voice that it's God's voice and that God has his name in there he will cut our enemies off he'll destroy them and we won't see them anymore I personally believe this this is my view that we're not going to have to wait until the Millennium to get to a place in our lives where Satan just won't know what to do with us as the bride comes to that place of perfection that brother Toby spoke about out of Philippians and you know brothers and sisters I believe that's such a powerful scripture we might get there tonight but you know what we're supposed to push on to Perfection out of Hebrews just just go on to Perfection forget about all of these ordinances that we have in the church water baptism and laying on of hands and and gifts and callings and all these different things that we strive to find and do we don't need those necessarily anymore because we have him we don't need to have the gift when we have The Giver he'll give it all to us I just think it's so powerful to recognize his voice and just do all that I speak wait a second I thought that was Moses voice that you were talking about there but now you're saying all that I speak he's the same yesterday today and forever if we obey brother branham's voice and do all that God spoke through him brothers and sisters it will change things for us gifts and callings are without repentance in 1950 Exodus the 23rd chapter 20th verse beginning God's sending his Prophet Moses behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou will indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then will I be an enemy to thy enemies an adversary to thy adversaries for my angel shall go before thee Moses did nothing brother Brown I'm speaking here it was the angel of God is that right what did it look like that led Israel a pillar of Fire by night and A Cloud by day I believe he's still leading on we know that was Angel of the Covenant is that right I just love this thought brothers and sisters because who's the angel of the Covenant what's the angel of the Covenant is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the angel of the Covenant and it's not Gabriel it's it's not Michael although brother Branham says Michael is Jesus Jesus is Michael that's a discussion sometime he goes on to say we know that was the angel of the Covenant is that right it was the logos or the Christ he's still the same Leading the People today as he was then we're not talking crazy talk here brothers and sisters this is just almost Elementary stuff that the prophet of God said but sometimes I think it just really is good to just dust it off and and stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance recognizing this Pillar of Fire is not something to just say it's just a great picture that God allowed to happen and this cloud is not just something that God just allowed to happen I personally believe this that that cloud was just an invitation to the Bride of Jesus Christ just like John Once Upon a Time saw a door open in heaven that cloud is a door open in heaven to the Bride of Jesus Christ to say come up a little higher there's a revelation that I want you to know and that's not that you're just an ordinary church member that you are a bride that I have chosen from before the foundation of the world positionally placed to be grown up in Satan's Eden but just like Satan came in the Garden of Eden and took himself a bride I chose a bride to be taken right out of Satan's Eden and she won't fail at the word she won't stumble at the word she won't mix anything with this word it will not be a hybridized bride she will only have eyes for him Exodus 23 verse 20. I just think it's such a beautiful thought I'm going to go back to it here Exodus 23 verse 20. oh behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared and we know there's only one provided place of worship that's been prepared for us today brothers and sisters and you know I want to say it this way it is the message of the hour but you know what it's not Jeffersonville it's not voice of God Recordings it is the voice of God it's literally the voice of God through a Vindicated Prophet that's what we're talking about brothers and sisters this place that we have prepared for us is in Jesus Christ who is the message of the hour and it will not be denominated brother Branham says out of the Angel of the Lord in 1951 the same angel of God you know what I think friends I think that here's where this is in Exodus 13 21 and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud and a pillar of Cloud to lead them in the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by Night and Day he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people and with the reverent sincere heart I believe that that's the same angel of God that led Israel out of Egypt to the promised land in the natural is leading us to the promised land today in the spiritual and remember brothers and sisters what happened that cloud on Sunset Mountain something happened at that time and we know that was the call for the prophet it was a fulfillment of a prophecy it was a fulfillment of Dreams it was a fulfillment of many things but what what we're getting to brothers and sisters is that was actually God revealing the word to mankind again and you know brother Branham he went back according to the vision according to the instruction to go back to Jeffersonville to to preach the seals because he didn't open the seals some people might say that he opened the seals he preached the seals because that Covenant Angel the same one that was leading Israel is the one that opened the seals to this preacher that preached the seals and we know the man was the prophet of God I'm not trying to diminish him in any way but I just want to make a clear delineation that it was God that opened those seals it wasn't a man it was only God but that's what that cloud shows to us brothers and sisters is that God came down and revealed himself to mankind once again he didn't go outside of his word brother Branham said those seals there must be something additional to themselves somewhere along the way we've got to get this other Revelation but what God showed him was it was always laying right there in the word it was always in the word and it just needed to be revealed to us but it was the same angel that did it but what it was we hear about it and we think my that sounds interesting you know brother Branham was up in Sabina Canada praying the one time and that sword hit his hand and he said what's this why do I have a sword I'm always afraid of swords and he heard the voice say that's the sword of the king and he said the the king's sword the sword of the king the sword of a king and we know the voice said to him not a king but the king and there's only one king brother Branham said that's the sword of the king and that's not just a fancy story brothers and sisters that dovetails with this Cloud that we're talking about the cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night what that is is God himself coming down and revealing to mankind that I have placed now the word of God entirely back into your hands you don't have any more Mysteries there's no more questions about this word it's completely open to you so how is he Leading the People today we can see that how he led the children of Israel and maybe some of the things in the past of how he's LED people but how is he leading people today and we know it's really quite simple it's according to Ephesians as we have read Ephesians chapter four but we know there's some people that would say that Ephesians chapter 4 ain't enough and that's such a sad statement because it's not true it's a lying devil it's a spirit and it's evil it's not good because Ephesians chapter 4 is the only way that we are to be perfected according to the word of God and we know the word of God says be ye therefore perfect as I my Father in Heaven is perfect and if we don't follow the word of God how could we ever expect to be perfected there's an apostle a prophet a pastor evangelist and a teacher for the perfecting of the Saints for the edification of the body brothers and sisters we need to be perfect that's the call for our day how could we ever be perfect we could take and make a covenant with the Lord every day in the morning and we'll break that Covenant surely to goodness we'll break that Covenant we can make a covenant with another human being and surely to goodness likely will either come close or we will break that Covenant Covenant with God is not a man to God Covenant it's a God to God Covenant and the only way that we can have that Covenant is to take a look at that Pillar of Fire and and that picture of the cloud and say turn it right not just turn it right 90 degrees so I can actually have a better view of it but to recognize the right way of perceiving this picture and the right way of perceiving this picture is about Revelations it's not about the way that maybe we think about it brothers and sisters let's turn over to Revelations quickly as we have a little bit of time left I just think this is so powerful and maybe we'll get into it a little bit on Sunday Lord willing if you turn over to Revelations chapter 1 . I know brother Branham talks about being able to see the picture of Jesus Christ In This Cloud and I'm not saying that we can't see the picture of Jesus Christ In This Cloud but I want to maybe just illustrate this picture of Jesus Christ In This Cloud because this is what brother Brandon was talking about when he says the white wigged one we know he had much discussion about that he talked to his Theologian friend Junior Jackson uh to have that Jack Moore exactly I apologize it was Jack Moore he said to him what was that and he said it was his glorified State and he couldn't recognize that he couldn't realize it until it became real to him it was a revelation that God gave him verse 13 of Revelations chapter 1. actually verse 12. and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle and his head and his hairs were white Like Woe white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire brothers and sisters when we look at this Cloud I believe it's high tide we recognize what that cloud means what the signaling is for the ages of this world what it means is it's judgment time that's what that cloud means it's not time to say that God sent a prophet and everything is going to be just fine what it means is that judgment is set the books are just about open and everyone who was not found in the Lamb's Book of Life will be cast alive into the Lake of Fire we have been given an opportunity to recognize the position in which we live when we look at that picture we need to recognize this is God Almighty it's not some dirty old grandpa that's just going to say everything is fine I'm willing to wink now at your sin we need to walk forward with confidence and know that we can accept the word of God but he's given us conditions if you accept my word if you listen to the voice of the prophet and then accept what I say my voice my words will be in you and what that does brothers and sisters is it gives us the ability to stand and look at this Pillar of Fire And This Cloud this picture if we look at it right if we turn it right we can see him with eyes as flame of fire and hair white like well we can look in the face of judgment and say Lord be it unto me I know that I would never be able to keep this Covenant but the prophet of God said that you made a covenant and that it's your Covenant that's the only way that I could ever stand before you and face you with this kind of judgment called to another calling out of the first seal brother Branham says in its only is to be revealed in at this last day when the actual seal is broken to who not to Christ but to the church notice now he says oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it something was happening there yes there was a real transition that was happening there brothers and sisters it excuse me it wasn't just that that he was saying I just want to make this so we're going to feel better and feel good God was saying something really significant to the entire bride of Jesus Christ to the church I no longer call you church I call you bride we know that in John 15 Jesus said henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what the Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you he says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forward and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye ask of my father in his name he may give it unto you we talked about this this was one of The Inspirations over there was that you know the branches the the he said I am the vine and ye are the branches and you know what the branches are supposed to be purged and the ones that don't produce fruit what happens to them they get cut off and when they get cut off they wither away and sometimes that happens in the body of Jesus Christ we see folks they they wither away and there's nothing that we can really do about that except for pray for them and try and encourage them but brothers and sisters what the goal is is so that the branches can be purged when there's fruit on the ends of those branches then they're purged and we know that God wants to see fruit that will remain he doesn't want to see fruit that will just wither away and and come and go brothers and sisters we've been called out the pillar of fire in 1953 brother Bradham says he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day neither the pillar of Fire by night from before the people that's God's word now what was the angel was the angel of the Covenant and he led all the old things was a type of the new things to come you believe that scripture says so being a shadow Hebrews now as God led the children led the church in the natural in that day he's leading the church in the spiritual in this day do you believe it they were the people of God until they were called out of Egypt and then they become the Church of God for the word church means called out they were called out of Egypt and were called out of the world of peculiar people to serve God isn't it amazing brothers and sisters this was just blowing my mind when I was thinking about this and maybe it's just common and and I'm crazy but I'm happy right here so just leave me this way but isn't it wonderful to think that you know brother Branham says that here back in the children of Israel they were called out of Egypt what did he say here they were called the people of God until they were called out of Egypt but then they were called the church right but how many years was it since then that God came around and said now I no longer call you church I call you bride who has ever said that in the in the history of human beings on Earth only one man that I've ever heard of and that's William Mary and Branham but we know that wasn't the man saying that that was God saying that and you know we know one thing brothers and sisters this is sort of the encouragement that I'm I'm getting the inspiration for this is that simply this we know brother Branham says it in the message of the hour that all God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church and I want to say it this way all that Christ was he's poured into his bride because he's not pouring himself into a church that can't receive him there's vessels of honor and there's vessels of Dishonor there's people in the church worldwide that claim the blood of Jesus Christ but would say it's rubbish to believe that God sent a prophet in our day because the apostolic age is done and the way that you worship God under that that that ideology makes you a heretic but like I said brothers and sisters hey the way in which you call heresy that's how we worship God and you know what I'm happy just exactly the way that I am so if you see that I'm crazy just go ahead and leave me here but isn't it wonderful to think that there came a point in time where God actually changed the dispensation he changed the direction he changed the thought patterns to say you're no longer just a church you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you have come to a place where you need to recognize Who You Are we know that in Revelations 4 John was called to come up a little higher and that is the message of the hour brothers and sisters to recognize there was a door open in heaven when we are in the spirit on the Lord's day it's not a Sabbath it's not some place geographically that we're going to go to it's actually the revelation of Jesus Christ The Mystery of God revealed Jesus Christ The Mystery of God revealed the message of the hour and here we have it we are willing participants of this he's given us the ability to hear ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the churches we know that there was a group of bones in a valley I believe it was Isaiah was it Ezekiel I'm getting them mixed up now we know that there was a bunch of dry bones in the valley and we know the prophet of God said he was told speak to those bones speak to those bones he was first asked will those bones live again and he said I don't know you know and he said speak to those bones how could those bones hear they had no sinure flesh and we know that it's a supernatural anointing it's that same voice of God speak to those bones we have been given ears to hear what those bones could hear brothers and sisters in our day and you know that all God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he's poured into his bride today and you know I just want to say this what is the attraction on the mount 1965. brother Branham says that's what the attraction is the predestinated seed of God who can't do nothing else but follow it it means more than life to us take our lives but don't take that what is the attraction God God as usual fulfilling his word God himself coming down in a pillar of fire fulfilling his word God himself coming down in A Cloud by day fulfilling his word showing that there is going to be an opening of the seals showing that there is going to be a completion of the word that there's going to be a tying up of all of the Loose Ends and there's going to be a group of people that will say Amen to that word we know that there was Joshua and there was Caleb I was studying this these 12 people they were called the Valiant ones oh God the ones who were the leaders brother Branham says the Elders of the church brother Emmanuel talked about this they were told to go spy out the land and they came back from the other side with the fruit of it and they threw it down and they said there it is but there's no way that we can take it because we're grasshoppers in the eyes of the Giants how did they know what the Giants saw how did they ever get that that that plug-in Revelation about what the Giants were seeing about them because we know the enemy they said when they when they went to the walls of Jericho remember Rahab the Harlot she said our hearts melt within us there was a different report but what was it it was it was that they were adding to the Revelation that was given to them in their day they were more willing to accept their emotions their own perceptions their own thinking their own ideologies then the word of God the way the prophet gave it to him even when they went and saw yes there's there's flowing milk and honey there's fruits that takes two men to carry everything the word says is there is there but we just can't do it brothers and sisters don't don't do ourselves out of a blessing don't say you can't do it say you can do it no matter what confess positive brother Branham says you'll never live above your confession so I just want to go here tonight and say this you know we have talked about bride to wife bride bride to wife we've talked about the bride and and how the Bride of Jesus Christ now is is is the one instead of the church how the word of God has come from the called out of God to the church to the the the the bride but brothers and sisters I think we've gone further than that now haven't we haven't we gone further than just being called The Bride of Jesus Christ and don't get don't get nervous I'm not trying to change the Revelation but what I do want to say is there's coming a place where we're going to get to a very Pinnacle of the Capstone revelation of Jesus Christ himself in the body today and you know I just want to say it this way and this is what we said in the Philippines is that there comes a point in time where you have a wedding and up until that wedding ceremony you are the bride even during the wedding ceremony you are the bride at the rehearsal you are the bride when you're planning the bride the bride but you know what there comes a time when that marriage happens that you are no longer the bride that you're the wife that you are the same as him the twain become one they become one flesh so brothers and sisters we can no longer go forward saying that we are someday going to achieve this if we have received the message of the hour in its fullness then we are now married to Jesus Christ if we have received him in our lives Revelations 19 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready how do we make ourselves ready by saying Amen to this message of the hour by simply just receiving it the way that God has given it to us I'm just going to call the musicians tonight I just want to encourage us for for 2023 brothers and sisters to no longer look at ourselves as the bride no no doubt that we are and some people are in different stages of their Journey but you know what if you've come to a place where you fully recognize the word of God and the message of the hour then you have all of the authority as our brother Jose says he creates a paycheck from his his job and he gives all of the paycheck to his wife because he fully trusts his wife he knows that his wife is no longer just a bride she is part of him she will look after everything the way that he wants it done she will never just go outside of his desires she'll say honey what do you think about this now what do you think if God has actually married us and given us the whole checkbook it's not just something that comes from Jeffersonville that we can just write out our desire and create a vision board and say you know Lord's going to do something for me here we can go on our knees and you know what sometimes brothers and sisters I'm sure as the Bride of Jesus Christ you've experienced this you go to go to prayer and before you even mention it God answers your prayer because he discerns the heart he is the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart it goes further much further than just actually speaking with our voices when we follow his voice he knows us he knows our name he knows our hearts he knows our desires and he wants to see us happy he wants to see us Prosper he doesn't want to punish us he is a gentleman and you know brothers and sisters if we can just be in our position as the Bride of Jesus Christ and just take all of our cares to our husband and just ask his opinion of it I am sure that he will reward us accordingly I stand to our feet tonight God bless you it's good to be home gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for your goodness to us Lord I pray that we could just father have the encouragement to recognize that Lord there's there's coming a day and and I believe it's by Revelation that that we will go from being just the bride to being your wife and father there's no time frame on that we have no pressure on anyone but father we will never live above our confession Lord and I pray that we could just Lord as we go forwards preach this gospel this message of the hour at the highest level father because that's what's going to change our body is the rapturing faith that lies on those tapes but Lord we know that rapturing faith that lies on the tapes will not Rapture those tapes that that raps rapturing faith that lies on those tapes has got to be in the hearts of men that you created that space for in their hearts Lord when that rapturing faith gets all the way into the hearts of men oh Father we know that that will Rapture human beings father and that's our desire today father is just to be more like you father we ask that you would just keep your hand upon us Lord pray pray that you would be with the panettas father while they're away that you would just bless their time the last few days father thank you for giving us safe passage home Lord father we pray that you would be with brother Justice while he travels Lord Jesus thank you for bringing our sisters back home to us father Lord Jesus we know that you are in control of all things and we thank you Father for leading us and guiding us Lord even through the valley of the shadow of death father we will fear no evil because we know your rod and your staff comforts us father we love you and we thank you we just ask that you would go with us now as we go our separate ways and if it Be Your Will for us to gather again on Sunday father Lord we'll be careful to give you all the glory we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen he became me yeah yeah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] my grace he took my place so that I through his love could take care oh he became so that I might become him by
