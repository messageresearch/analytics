[17:54] God bless each one of you. Welcome once
[17:56] again in the house of the Lord. Visitors
[17:58] and different ones with us this morning.
[18:00] God bless you richly. Greet you in the
[18:02] name of the precious Lord Jesus [music]
[18:04] this morning. Let's start this morning
[18:06] with God is good all the time. I was
[18:09] thinking life may not necessarily be
[18:11] good sometimes, but God is good all the
[18:14] all the time. Capital A all the time.
[18:17] Let's start with a verse this morning.
[18:20] Oh, if you're [music and singing]
[18:22] walking
[18:24] through the valley
[18:27] and there are shadows [singing]
[18:30] [music] all around.
[18:34] Oh, do not fear.
[18:37] [music] Oh, he [singing] will guide you.
[18:41] He will keep you [music] safe and sound.
[18:47] For [singing] he has promised
[18:51] he'll never leave you
[18:54] nor [music and singing] forsake you
[18:58] and his word is [music] true. My
[19:01] [singing] God is good
[19:05] for all the time. [music]
[19:08] He put a song of [music] praise in his
[19:12] heart.
[19:15] God is good [music]
[19:18] all the time
[19:22] through the dark
[19:24] [music]
[19:27] shine. My God is
[19:32] my God.
[19:36] [music]
[19:40] Yeah.

[21:12] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[21:19] [music]
[21:24] My God is good. [music]
[21:27] My God is good.
[21:33] [music]
[21:36] We have Sister Janet with us. My praise
[21:38] corner. God bless you, sister. [music]
[21:40] Missed you in the last service. You're
[21:42] always so engaged in the service. I so
[21:44] appreciate it. Thank you, my sister. And
[21:46] you know what? Life gets so much better
[21:48] when we learn this.
[21:50] Oh, it's hard [singing and music]
[21:51] to take the first step when I
[21:55] [singing and music] don't know the way.
[21:59] Each step is so [music] uncertain.
[22:01] [singing]
[22:03] I learned to walk by faith
[22:07] and he [music]
[22:08] gave [singing] me that promise
[22:11] that you will never leave.
[22:14] [music and singing]
[22:16] you and me and guide me.
[22:20] Lord, I [singing] do believe [music]
[22:28] and I
[22:30] will follow. Help us, oh God. [music]
[22:33] Lead [singing] me, oh Lord,
[22:37] and I
[22:39] will go. [music]
[22:42] For you have called me. Think about it.
[22:46] Oh, and I have answered.
[22:50] Lead [music]
[22:51] the Lord
[22:53] and I
[22:55] will go. Oh yes, [singing] your bless
[23:00] [music]
[23:00] for me are perfect.
[23:03] I never need to hear.
[23:07] Although sometimes I [singing and music]
[23:10] feel alone, I know that you are here.
[23:15] My heart just wants to
[23:21] [music and singing]
[23:24] take my hand. [music]
[23:30] [singing]
[23:34] [music]
[23:36] And I
[23:38] will [music and singing]
[23:42] be
[23:47] [music]
[23:50] for you
[23:53] and I [music] will
[24:00] [music]
[24:03] stand
[24:05] with
[24:06] You pray. Sing the chorus. Lead

[38:06] you.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Happy to see all
[38:14] of you. Uh we just want to apologize. Uh
[38:17] if you see that we have been moving
[38:18] people around. Uh Sunday is a little bit
[38:21] difficult for us to know who is coming
[38:23] to for us to prepare. So sometimes we
[38:25] have to move you around. If it does
[38:27] happen, forgive us. But we want to make
[38:29] sure that everybody has a place to sit.
[38:32] God bless you. Let's pray.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Our dear heavenly father, what a
[38:37] beautiful sight, a bouquet that you've
[38:39] prepared this morning.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Father, your children from all walks of
[38:43] life. Father, this morning coming
[38:46] together with one purpose to come and
[38:48] worship
[38:50] &gt;&gt; the resurrected Jesus this morning.
[38:52] Father, [music]
[38:53] &gt;&gt; we've come with our sacrifice this
[38:55] morning. Our praises to you this
[38:58] morning, Father. Each one with our
[39:00] faith, our measure of faith this
[39:03] morning, Father. And this morning, I
[39:05] know Brother Paul has done his best by
[39:07] the inspiration given to him, Father, to
[39:09] sing songs of Zion.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; This morning, our pastor, brother,
[39:14] couldn't be here this morning. Father,
[39:16] he as brother Dwayne all the way from
[39:18] Edmonton to come and speak to us this
[39:21] morning. Father, this morning as he's
[39:23] preparing to come here, Lord, may you
[39:25] have a place in our hearts to receive
[39:27] the word that is about to come, Lord.
[39:30] And each and everyone that made the
[39:32] effort to come here this morning.
[39:33] Sometimes the pool is so hard for us to
[39:37] get up and come to you.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; But this morning, they made it here.
[39:41] Lord, may they not go back empty-handed.
[39:44] Lord,
[39:45] &gt;&gt; may you bless us all together. Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Even those that were able to switch on
[39:49] their their their television, whatever
[39:51] means that they are listening to us on
[39:53] the online, may you bless them as well.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning we are here and we
[39:59] know that you are here.
[40:01] Feed your children as we come. Father,
[40:05] we thank you. We bless your name. Those
[40:06] that are on the way coming, may you
[40:09] grant them travel mercy. We thank you.
[40:12] We bless your name. those that could not
[40:14] make it here this morning as well for
[40:16] whatever reason. Maybe they are working,
[40:18] maybe they a little bit cold, maybe they
[40:20] are sick,
[40:22] &gt;&gt; may you bless them as well.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Now we are bringing our tithes and
[40:25] offering. We pray that Lord you receive
[40:27] it and bless it in Jesus name that we
[40:31] pray.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; I've got so much to thank you for. Just
[40:40] a thought. I don't know if our pastor
[40:42] has heard this yet, but uh brother Ed
[40:44] Hammermeister I just heard this morning
[40:46] has a really really tough situation. So
[40:50] I just want to hold him before the Lord
[40:51] in prayer. Apparently a stage four
[40:53] cancer
[40:54] pastor of Edmonton uh uh message
[40:57] tabernacle, anti- message tabernacle. So
[40:59] really a difficult trial for him and the
[41:01] congregation there. So just hold Brother
[41:03] Ed Hammermeister in your prayers if you
[41:05] would and the congregation there. Lots
[41:07] of uh lots of trials. was hearing uh the
[41:10] patriarch Abraham this week. Brother Ram
[41:12] talks about this trial that God brings
[41:13] him. He took Abraham's son said come and
[41:16] come and sacrifice your only son. What
[41:18] like what an incredible [music]
[41:20] challenge that was for Abraham, but it
[41:22] was God testing his faith. So these
[41:24] these situations are certainly not easy,
[41:27] but they're to test our faith. And of
[41:29] course, God knows the end from the
[41:31] beginning. So we trust him. He's
[41:33] sovereign. Hold Brother Ed in your in
[41:35] your prayers. Wonderful [music] friend
[41:37] of mine personally. and just had a
[41:39] wonderful relationship over the years.
[41:40] Was really was moved by that news this
[41:43] morning.
[41:44] When I look around and see the things
[41:46] you've done for me,
[41:48] let's let's sing the chorus only.
[41:51] I've got so much to thank him for. So
[41:58] much
[42:00] to praise him for. You see,
[42:05] God has been [singing and music] so good
[42:08] to me
[42:12] when I [music]
[42:20] [music]
[42:22] got to
[42:25] [music]
[42:29] [music]
[42:31] God. So [singing]
[42:34] thank you [music] so much
[42:43] [music]
[42:45] to me.
[42:48] [music]
[42:52] [singing]
[42:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[42:58] &gt;&gt; I got
[43:00] to
[43:03] baby [music]
[43:06] wherever you are. So much to make him
[43:11] [singing and music] for so much.
[43:20] [music]
[43:26] [music]
[43:34] [music]
[43:40] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:54] &gt;&gt; There she says. [clears throat]
[44:07] Um,
[44:10] as we're in the spirit of thanking the
[44:12] Lord for what he's
[44:15] for what he's done for me, I I was
[44:18] feeling there to sing this song. It's um
[44:22] it's a wonderful song that I love so
[44:24] much and it speaks to me so dearly. Um,
[44:27] and it just teaches me to be grateful
[44:29] for what the Lord has done in my life.
[44:32] And even through my trials and
[44:34] tribulations, I just want to thank him
[44:36] for what I have.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; And even if um I was expecting something
[44:41] um just by thanking him for even if I
[44:43] don't have it yet, that's just a sign of
[44:45] faith that
[44:47] &gt;&gt; was God and he just by thanking him
[44:50] whether it's sickness, whether it's
[44:52] whether you're going through sickness or
[44:53] whatever it may be, whether whether it's
[44:55] cancer, just thank him for your
[44:57] deliverance from cancer. And I believe
[45:00] God will and I've seen it happen and I
[45:02] believe God will do it for you.

[47:23] but Lord,
[47:25] I have you [music]

[47:30] all that matters.

[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, my brother. What a
[49:51] wonderful reminder for each one of us
[49:53] this morning. So much to be thankful for
[49:56] this morning. Seems like kind of the
[49:57] theme of the songs this morning. God
[49:58] bless you. Stand with me if you would as
[50:00] we change over the service into the
[50:02] chamber. Let's think two courses and
[50:04] we'll ask our pastor to come introduce
[50:08] uh brother Dwayne this morning. Good to
[50:10] good to have our brother with us and
[50:12] looking forward to what God has in store
[50:13] for us into the chamber. As we know pro
[50:18] the prophet taught us that he's on the
[50:19] outside knocking. We have to open the
[50:22] door. Let's open it to him this morning.
[50:23] That's free moral agency. Let's do that.
[50:25] Let's just say Lord would you come?
[50:27] Would you come and s with me this
[50:29] morning? Dwell into
[50:32] the chamber. [singing]
[50:35] Be free. Holy
[50:38] Spirit,
[50:40] speak to
[50:43] me gently
[50:45] as I close
[50:48] the door. [singing]
[50:51] Heavenly
[50:54] lover,

[50:59] cover.

[51:32] amly
[51:35] lover.
[51:37] Let thy presence
[51:40] cover
[51:42] your kind of unity [music]
[51:47] is all. [singing]
[51:51] [music]
[51:53] It's the last verse of the song.
[51:56] Jesus is passing this way.
[52:02] Last last verse.
[52:06] He is so tender
[52:10] and loving.
[52:15] He is
[52:17] so near you today.
[52:21] Why don't we invite him this morning?
[52:23] [music]
[52:24] Oh yes. [singing] Open your heart to
[52:29] [music] receive
[52:32] him.
[52:34] Oh, while
[52:36] he is passing
[52:39] this way. Well, think about that this
[52:41] morning. Jesus is passing his way. Oh,
[52:44] Jesus [music]
[52:45] is passing
[52:48] this way.
[52:52] Jesus
[52:54] [music]
[52:58] today.
[53:03] Jesus [music]
[53:04] is passing
[53:07] this way. [music]
[53:12] He is passing this [music]
[53:15] way [singing]
[53:16] to today. Jesus.
[53:19] Oh [music] Jesus
[53:22] is happy.
[53:24] [music]
[53:34] [music]
[53:38] &gt;&gt; [music]
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[53:40] is [singing] passing
[53:43] this way.
[53:46] [music]
[53:53] [music]
[53:55] Amen.
[54:07] Sorry, I just needed my notes. God bless
[54:10] you this morning. Welcome to the house
[54:11] of the Lord one more time. Certainly
[54:14] honored and privileged to gather
[54:15] together this way,
[54:18] &gt;&gt; his only provided place of worship in
[54:21] the age in which we live.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; We're certainly thankful to see everyone
[54:25] here today. We would like to welcome our
[54:27] visitors. Brother uh Yuju Silver, is
[54:31] that right? From Kenya. Did I say that
[54:35] right? Brother, God bless you. Welcome.
[54:37] [applause]
[54:42] I've been to Nairobi a couple of times
[54:44] and [music] uh it's a wonderful place to
[54:46] visit and uh the people are just
[54:48] wonderful. So I trust you feel right at
[54:50] home today. and any other person who is
[54:53] visiting today maybe like the fairs.
[54:56] Brother Dwayne, sister Connie, God bless
[54:59] you. Pretty much like family though.
[55:01] [applause]
[55:07] For anybody that doesn't know, uh,
[55:09] Sister Connie is Sister Shel's sister.
[55:12] So, we used to spend a fair bit of time
[55:14] with Brother Dwayne and Sister Connie
[55:16] while Brother Ken was here. And
[55:19] since he went on to his reward,
[55:22] seems like brother Dwayne and Sister
[55:25] Connie have stepped into another role in
[55:28] their church [music] and have become the
[55:30] pastor of that church, Saskatoon
[55:32] Tabernacle. So, Brother Dwayne doesn't
[55:35] travel as much. That's why we don't see
[55:36] him so much. Now, he's got a flock of
[55:38] sheep that he tends to there. And
[55:41] hopefully, we can see him a little more
[55:42] in the future. But I know what it's like
[55:45] to not travel because your your heart is
[55:48] at home. But uh we just certainly
[55:51] welcome you today. And uh we just also
[55:53] like to remember brother Simple Chessi,
[55:57] our brother. He's been fellowshiing
[55:59] fellowshipping with us for a few months
[56:01] here. And uh he has a job to do. He's
[56:04] about to go back, I think it's to
[56:06] Belgium, is it? He's going to Belgium, I
[56:09] think, in the next couple of days
[56:11] because his wife, Sister Agnes, is there
[56:14] and just about to deliver their baby. I
[56:17] think they're days away from the
[56:19] delivery. Is that right? So, he's going
[56:21] to collect his bride and his baby.
[56:26] [applause]
[56:33] So we just want to remember the Chime
[56:36] messes
[56:38] the family and uh just ask the Lord
[56:40] would bless them abundantly and pray for
[56:42] a safe delivery and then safe arrival of
[56:46] the whole family coming here to visit
[56:48] us. Certainly look forward to that day,
[56:50] brother.
[56:51] You know, uh just a couple of
[56:53] announcements before we get going. I
[56:55] just wanted to remind us we have brother
[56:56] Cadre Digs here next weekend. We also
[56:58] have the funeral next weekend for Sister
[57:01] Germaine.
[57:03] Um the grad celebration is coming up and
[57:06] uh I've mentioned it a few times and I
[57:08] just want to mention it again. We need
[57:10] to get a count for the amount of people
[57:13] that wish to be celebrated for
[57:15] graduating. Anybody who hasn't been
[57:18] appreciated, we certainly want to give
[57:20] you that opportunity. So if you could
[57:22] please reach out to me. We've [music]
[57:24] only had two people reach out and we
[57:26] need to have a minimum number of people
[57:27] to be able to rent the venue. So, we
[57:30] just want to try and and appreciate you.
[57:32] If you're interested, by all means,
[57:33] reach out. If not, we'll uh certainly
[57:36] look for another uh opportunity or
[57:39] venue. Over in December, I'll be
[57:41] traveling to see Brother Darren Ber in
[57:44] uh in December. It'll be the 7th. I'll
[57:47] be there for three services, Friday,
[57:49] Saturday, Sunday. Brother Dawn is going
[57:50] to take the service on Sunday. Here we
[57:53] have the youth service on the 12th. We
[57:56] have the youth activity on the 21st. And
[58:01] we have uh the 31st, which is a
[58:04] Wednesday night, will be a communion
[58:06] worship service here on the last day of
[58:09] the year. No place that I think I'd
[58:12] rather be. But
[58:14] &gt;&gt; maybe we could just uh have a word of
[58:16] prayer here this morning and change the
[58:18] order of the service.
[58:21] If you have a need, maybe just defy
[58:23] gravity and raise your hand to him this
[58:26] morning.
[58:27] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[58:29] this morning we just are so thankful
[58:32] that we can gather together with you.
[58:34] Lord, we know as we already prayed this
[58:38] morning that you're here in our midst
[58:39] because this meeting has been declared
[58:41] to be in your name.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just take you at your
[58:44] word. We don't want anything more and we
[58:46] don't want anything less. We don't want
[58:48] a hybrid religion, Lord. We just want
[58:50] you in the fullness of your word. So,
[58:53] Father, this morning, we just want to
[58:55] commit each and every need, Lord, that
[58:57] was expressed to you, that was made
[58:58] known unto you by the way of an uplift
[59:01] hand. And father, we pray that you would
[59:03] just bless each one.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Sovereignly according to their desire.
[59:08] Father, we pray for the friend of the
[59:10] carpenters. Lord, they have a request
[59:12] this morning. We pray that you would
[59:13] just meet that need, Lord Jesus. Father,
[59:16] we pray that you would keep your hand
[59:18] upon upon brother Simple as he travels.
[59:20] Lord, watch over the the baby. Father,
[59:23] we pray for a safe delivery. And Lord,
[59:25] that you would keep mama safe as well,
[59:27] Sister Agnes. Lord,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And father, when your will is, we
[59:32] look forward to seeing the family
[59:33] together here in Calgary. And Lord, we
[59:37] just want to stand united together as a
[59:40] body of believers for our brother in
[59:41] Edmonton. Lord,
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that it's a boasting
[59:45] giant in the valley.
[59:47] And you have given us the grace that we
[59:50] need to, those five smooth stones, Lord
[59:52] Jesus,
[59:54] &gt;&gt; to be able to stand and defy that
[59:58] boasting giant in the name of the living
[1:00:00] God.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, that would dare come against
[1:00:04] one of your servants.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray for the congregation
[1:00:08] there and we just pray for the the
[1:00:10] pastor and his family, Lord. Each one,
[1:00:12] Lord, that needs a touch from you this
[1:00:14] morning.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just stand united with them in
[1:00:17] your name. Now, Father, as we turn to
[1:00:20] your word, we just want to commit this
[1:00:22] service in every aspect
[1:00:25] into your hands for your glory. Pray
[1:00:28] that you would just bless Brother
[1:00:29] Dwayne, Father, that when he would leave
[1:00:31] here today, that he would have a spring
[1:00:33] in his step, Lord. That he would have a
[1:00:36] a song in his soul, Lord Jesus, that he
[1:00:38] would be able to say he's heard from
[1:00:40] you.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; And Father, by that we know we will
[1:00:43] also. We love you, Lord. And we just ask
[1:00:46] all these things now. In Jesus Christ's
[1:00:48] name we pray.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song, reach out and
[1:00:54] touch the Lord
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; as he [music] passes by
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; and we'll invite brother Dwayne to just
[1:01:00] come and take his liberty this morning.
[1:01:04] Reach out and [music] touch the Lord
[1:01:10] as he passes
[1:01:13] by. [music]
[1:01:15] You'll find he's [singing] not too busy
[1:01:21] to hear your heart's [singing] cry. He
[1:01:26] is passing
[1:01:28] by this moment.
[1:01:31] Your [music]
[1:01:33] son
[1:01:38] and touch the Lord
[1:01:41] as he [music]
[1:01:43] goes by. Glory
[1:01:46] shout and [music] touch the Lord.
[1:01:52] He
[1:01:53] passes by.
[1:01:56] You will find he's not too busy
[1:02:01] to hear [singing and music] your heart.
[1:02:06] He is [music and singing]
[1:02:08] promise
[1:02:11] your [music]
[1:02:13] supply.
[1:02:16] Reach out [singing]
[1:02:18] and touch the Lord [music]
[1:02:21] as he
[1:02:23] goes by. [music]
[1:02:28] Hallelujah.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like, you know, we
[1:02:31] sing these little songs and I wonder
[1:02:33] sometimes if that reality
[1:02:36] of who's in our midst actually if it
[1:02:39] becomes a reality to us.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; You know, he promised that where two or
[1:02:43] three would be gathered, I will
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; be there in their midst.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; I will be there in their midst. you
[1:02:49] know, I think it was uh you know, little
[1:02:51] Fanny Crosby, you know, she's born blind
[1:02:55] and and uh you know, grew up with that
[1:02:58] kind of a complex
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; uh surrounding her.
[1:03:03] And yet when she was approached about,
[1:03:05] you know, taking the gift that God gave
[1:03:07] her and using it for for uh the glory of
[1:03:11] this world and for money and for
[1:03:13] whatever it would fame, whatever it
[1:03:14] might bring her, she said, "I'd never do
[1:03:17] that. How could I do that?
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, how do you know?"
[1:03:23] She said, "I'll know him."
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Said, "You're completely blind. How are
[1:03:28] you going to know him?" She said, "I'll
[1:03:30] know him by the touch
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; of his hand.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Listen."
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; He's here now.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; You might have your natural sight, but
[1:03:41] don't miss the reality
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; that he's here. [music]
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; That he's here. Turn around. Shake
[1:03:47] somebody's hand. Welcome to the house of
[1:03:49] the Lord. Wish him God's blessing. God
[1:03:51] bless you. Certainly. God bless you,
[1:03:53] brother Mvin. Buddy, God bless you, sis.
[1:03:57] God bless you.
[1:04:00] I might as well just go right across the
[1:04:01] platform, huh? God bless you all. God
[1:04:03] bless you. God bless you.
[1:04:09] Amen.
[1:04:11] Hallelujah.
[1:04:18] Amen. I want to say thank you to the
[1:04:20] musicians. Wish you God's blessing.
[1:04:23] I'll let you have your seats. I want to
[1:04:24] say a big thank you to Brother Barry uh
[1:04:28] for the invitation. Once again, I uh uh
[1:04:32] you know, understand from a from a
[1:04:35] pastor standpoint that it's uh you know,
[1:04:39] you you guard your pulpit. You don't
[1:04:40] just give it out to anybody. And so I I
[1:04:42] certainly do um I count it an honor to
[1:04:47] to stand here again. It's brother Barry
[1:04:48] and I were just talking in the office.
[1:04:50] He said, "How long's it been?" I said,
[1:04:51] "I don't know." I was trying to remember
[1:04:52] that yesterday and I really don't know.
[1:04:55] There there was a little while ago I was
[1:04:58] in the city and and is it okay if I just
[1:05:00] get rid of this? You know what? That
[1:05:02] doesn't mean you change things out
[1:05:04] there, though.
[1:05:05] I I tell my mom and dad, you know, I'm
[1:05:08] born white and uh but I tell them all
[1:05:10] the time that they they were out of the
[1:05:12] will of God when they had me in Canada
[1:05:15] cuz I should have been born where it was
[1:05:17] hot and I so I'm not complaining at
[1:05:19] home. I hardly ever take my jacket off.
[1:05:21] So, I'm just going to you just take it
[1:05:22] for what it is. But anyhow, um you know,
[1:05:25] we're up I don't know when it was months
[1:05:27] ago now, but we were here. I had a
[1:05:29] little fellowship with brother Barry and
[1:05:30] he asked if I'd take the service. I
[1:05:32] said, "Ah, I don't know. And right then
[1:05:37] uh or just shortly thereafter, I got a a
[1:05:40] phone call and I had to go back home and
[1:05:43] I needed to be there the following day.
[1:05:45] So I'm just like, "Brother Barry, I
[1:05:46] can't. I got to go home." And I didn't
[1:05:48] even tell them why. I just told him I
[1:05:50] couldn't. And and uh anyhow,
[1:05:52] [clears throat]
[1:05:53] it is good. I just say this. It's good.
[1:05:55] It's good to be back in Calgary again.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; I look at all these young men. Good
[1:05:59] grief.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; My goodness. These were just uh you know
[1:06:04] they were just boys. I remember their
[1:06:05] graduations some of them and and now
[1:06:08] they're men and man I don't know how
[1:06:10] much hair that man can grow on his face
[1:06:11] but
[1:06:14] you know just
[1:06:17] one thing about it we're getting old and
[1:06:20] brother Barry asked me this morning he
[1:06:22] said hey boy I was wondering if you were
[1:06:24] going to make it or not. when are you
[1:06:25] coming? And what I didn't tell him is it
[1:06:27] takes me too long to do my hair now. And
[1:06:30] [clears throat]
[1:06:31] this is not so true. You know, you just
[1:06:33] you you realize that this mortal life uh
[1:06:37] it's just a vapor and and you know how
[1:06:40] Paul would say I was I was once young
[1:06:42] and now I'm old and uh you know
[1:06:44] sometimes we we don't want to accept the
[1:06:46] reality that we are getting old. You
[1:06:48] know, brother Ram says every, you know,
[1:06:50] everybody wants to hold on to that their
[1:06:52] youth and and why? Because there is a an
[1:06:55] eternal man on the inside that doesn't
[1:06:57] get old. That's right.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And yet he fights with this vessel, you
[1:07:00] know, and and uh things just change. And
[1:07:03] pretty soon you find out I blink and now
[1:07:06] I'm a grandpa of eight and and how did
[1:07:08] that happen? And you know, it just
[1:07:10] doesn't in my mind it doesn't compute.
[1:07:14] It doesn't compute. But I know here I
[1:07:17] have no continuing city.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; I have no continuing city. And I have
[1:07:21] just I feel like Abraham. I've been
[1:07:23] seeking for one all my life. [snorts]
[1:07:25] Uh I say this, I found the one that
[1:07:27] satisfies. I'm just waiting for the
[1:07:29] reality to step out of this dimension
[1:07:31] into that dimension. And I won't it be a
[1:07:34] time. You know, we got a we got a sister
[1:07:36] back home. She goes over to Brother
[1:07:38] Kelly's church and she sings a little
[1:07:39] song. Uh won't it be a time? You know,
[1:07:42] won't it be a time? And I I that's just
[1:07:44] the reality. I'm looking for the time
[1:07:46] when uh mortal life is no longer known.
[1:07:49] It doesn't exist anymore. We just uh I
[1:07:52] can come and you know if I if I'm living
[1:07:55] in my little place back there in
[1:07:56] Saskatchewan and I think, man, I want to
[1:07:59] see Brother Barry. I'm going to see
[1:08:01] Brother Barry. Man, I want to fellowship
[1:08:02] with Brother Paul. I'm gonna It's going
[1:08:04] to be like that. I won't even have
[1:08:06] hardly time to blink my eyes. And
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; you know, it's no wonder we're going to
[1:08:09] need an eternity. Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Uh even just to even just to sit down
[1:08:15] and shake hands and talk about the good
[1:08:18] things of God and what God has how did
[1:08:21] we get here?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; But I'm so glad that he has started a
[1:08:25] work in our lives that only he can
[1:08:27] finish.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; So I want to say Lord be it unto me
[1:08:31] according to your will.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You know I I heard the prayer this
[1:08:34] morning. Sometimes, you know, our way
[1:08:36] gets dark and and it gets rough and and
[1:08:38] you don't think you can go another mile,
[1:08:40] but it's all part of the molding process
[1:08:42] that God's got for what lays just beyond
[1:08:44] the veil. So, uh, Lord, help us that we
[1:08:47] might, you know, let's not let's not
[1:08:49] look at our troubles and our struggles
[1:08:51] as God trying to destroy our lives, but
[1:08:54] rather let's look at them as God, you
[1:08:56] know, I [clears throat] excuse me,
[1:08:57] Brother Barry, it's your fault already.
[1:08:59] He said, Lord, Lord, take him off his
[1:09:01] notes. And I haven't even I haven't even
[1:09:03] read my notes.
[1:09:04] But, you know, I I we're we bought this
[1:09:06] old house back uh in Saskatchewan here
[1:09:09] this last year and I got we we got to uh
[1:09:12] you know, it's an old home. So, Brother
[1:09:14] Paul, I don't even want to talk about
[1:09:15] these things because I'm I'm I'm talking
[1:09:17] to experts and and and they build like
[1:09:19] palaces and I I got a shack and and uh
[1:09:23] but you know, we we decided we were
[1:09:24] going to make it our own. When we bought
[1:09:25] it, we looked at it, we're like, "Well,
[1:09:26] yeah, the floor plan, the house is the
[1:09:29] location is everything. The house is not
[1:09:31] much, but we can make the house what we
[1:09:34] would. It would be it would be good
[1:09:35] enough for us, you know. I I don't need
[1:09:37] a mansion here. I'm being honest. I
[1:09:38] don't even need one when I get over
[1:09:39] there. I just that's not part of my my
[1:09:41] makeup. I it it I'm happy with whatever.
[1:09:44] And uh but in the in in in the vision of
[1:09:50] what I had uh what come to what I wanted
[1:09:53] for the home. Uh, you know, when you
[1:09:56] have a vision for something, if it's not
[1:09:58] already built according to those plans,
[1:10:01] you've got a lot of work to do.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; And you brothers that do renovations
[1:10:04] understand what I'm talking about. They
[1:10:06] take and and I believe this is just a
[1:10:08] shadow of what God is doing with our
[1:10:10] lives. You know, I bought this old house
[1:10:11] and and uh, you know, I looked at the
[1:10:13] walls and I think, yeah, that wall's got
[1:10:15] to come out. That's got to be opened up.
[1:10:16] This has got to be moved. This has got,
[1:10:18] you know, it's just like I don't even
[1:10:19] know how to do any of this except hold a
[1:10:21] big hammer and I can do that. And and
[1:10:23] [clears throat] um
[1:10:25] And I got to I got to into the house and
[1:10:28] and my initial what I thought was going
[1:10:31] to be no big deal. You just grab a
[1:10:34] hammer and you start removing things.
[1:10:39] I come to find out that there wasn't
[1:10:41] just giprock on the wall because giprock
[1:10:43] is easy to destroy with a hammer.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; And I got thinking about God's ways in
[1:10:48] our lives.
[1:10:50] You know when God wants to do something
[1:10:51] with our lives
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; sometimes he's got to take what we have
[1:10:55] spent 20 years 30 years 50 years 70
[1:11:00] years well we have our vision for our
[1:11:03] own life has to become subject to the
[1:11:05] vision he has
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; for our lives
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; and so when we say Lord here I am take
[1:11:11] me
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; uh lord we don't you don't you don't
[1:11:14] really understand what you're saying
[1:11:15] when you say lord I surrender all
[1:11:18] because sometimes the great contractor,
[1:11:19] God's going to come and sell me, hey,
[1:11:20] yeah, the you know what, the foundation
[1:11:22] is there, but that is not what I had in
[1:11:24] mind.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; So, and I realized very quickly and you
[1:11:28] know, uh, in the when it came to
[1:11:30] destroying the walls of the house, I
[1:11:31] picked up the big hammer and what I
[1:11:33] thought was just a giprock wall and it
[1:11:35] would, you know, just a couple swings
[1:11:36] would just take care of that. Uh, I come
[1:11:38] to find out that there wasn't just gip
[1:11:40] rock on the wall, but I would have to
[1:11:42] peel all the giprock off the wall. I'll
[1:11:45] tell you, you think, well, that's no big
[1:11:46] deal, Brother Dwayne. You know, giprock
[1:11:48] is screwed to the wall.
[1:11:52] And so you might think, well, it's not a
[1:11:53] big deal. It comes off. But it doesn't
[1:11:55] come off as easy as we think.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; It takes an effort to get it off the
[1:11:59] wall. And there's a lot of screws that
[1:12:00] are left there when they're Listen, I'm
[1:12:02] going to bring this down to our lives
[1:12:03] right now.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of screws that are left
[1:12:05] there. There's scars that are left
[1:12:06] there. When God takes and pulls off some
[1:12:08] of the the the facade,
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; the coverings of our life, we've got
[1:12:13] these things that it's all held together
[1:12:15] so nicely because we want everybody to
[1:12:16] think and look at us and perceive us a
[1:12:19] certain way. And God said, "But that's
[1:12:20] not what I want from you. That's not the
[1:12:22] vision I have for you." And God begins
[1:12:24] to take and and as a contractor he
[1:12:26] begins to pull the gip rock off only to
[1:12:28] find out and you're thinking you start
[1:12:30] pulling the rock off the wall and it's
[1:12:31] and it holds on and it holds on and
[1:12:33] finally it finally you know and it comes
[1:12:35] off [snorts] in pieces and then and then
[1:12:37] it just takes longer. It's harder and
[1:12:39] you're thinking every time God takes
[1:12:41] something off he's trying to take
[1:12:42] something out of your life to replace it
[1:12:44] with something better.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; It's like oh Lord oh Lord I don't know
[1:12:47] how much more I can handle. We finally
[1:12:49] get the giprock off the wall to find out
[1:12:52] there's paneling behind the giprock
[1:12:55] and it is also screwed to the wall.
[1:12:58] And so the great contractor has to go
[1:13:00] and now he's got to take the paneling
[1:13:03] and it should just come off the wall.
[1:13:04] But you know what? It's not just
[1:13:05] paneling on the wall. Now there's
[1:13:07] plywood behind the paneling that's on
[1:13:10] the wall and I need to get behind the
[1:13:12] plywood to know what I
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Do you understand, church?
[1:13:15] We got layer upon layer upon layer upon
[1:13:19] layer of of of issues of h of of your
[1:13:23] mother and father's problems, of your
[1:13:24] grandparents' problems. We got layer
[1:13:26] upon layer. And when the and when the
[1:13:28] great contractor looks at the life and
[1:13:30] says, "But my vision for that life looks
[1:13:34] like this
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; and I've got to get all the layers off."
[1:13:38] And sometimes in the removing of the
[1:13:40] layers, God, we we say, "Oh, God, I I
[1:13:44] can't handle anymore. or I can't take
[1:13:45] anymore. And he's like, I know you don't
[1:13:48] think you can, but when I'm done, just
[1:13:50] like remember brother um Gary Walker,
[1:13:53] how many remember how many knows brother
[1:13:54] Gary Walker here? Remember his testimony
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; when God told him, he said, "But if you
[1:13:58] would have if you would know what I'm
[1:14:00] going to do with your life, you would
[1:14:01] have signed up for this."
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; And it nearly it not nearly killed him.
[1:14:05] It killed him three times.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And to this day, he walks with a limp.
[1:14:09] He drags himself around. And that's
[1:14:12] sometimes what God has to do with our
[1:14:14] lives. You you might have a vision. You
[1:14:16] might have what you your dream for your
[1:14:18] life, but the moment that you say,
[1:14:20] "Lord, here I am.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm in your hands."
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; You don't know what father's going to do
[1:14:27] with your life.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; And he might have to take it right apart
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; to rebuild it
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; into his own image.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Into his own image.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Have you got your Bibles with you this
[1:14:38] morning?
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, would you give me some grace this
[1:14:41] morning? because I'm going to need it.
[1:14:42] [clears throat and cough] Revelations
[1:14:43] chapter 1, if you have your Bible,
[1:14:46] I was asking the Lord, Lord, what you
[1:14:48] know, you know, there's lots to thank
[1:14:50] you for standing. Honor to the reading
[1:14:52] of the word. There's, you know, there's
[1:14:54] a whole book uh to preach out of, but
[1:14:57] Lord, what what would you have for this
[1:14:59] morning?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; What would you have for this morning?
[1:15:02] And
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter one should
[1:15:05] [clears throat] be easy enough for us
[1:15:06] all to find.
[1:15:08] And I want to start reading at verse
[1:15:10] one.
[1:15:12] says, "The revelation of Jesus Christ,
[1:15:14] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:15:16] servants things which must shortly come
[1:15:18] to pass. And he sent and signified by
[1:15:22] his angel unto his servant John, who
[1:15:24] bear record of the word of God, and of
[1:15:26] the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of
[1:15:28] all things that he saw. Blessed is he
[1:15:31] that readeth and they that hear the
[1:15:33] words of this prophecy and keep those
[1:15:35] things which are written therein for the
[1:15:38] time is at hand. John to the verse four
[1:15:42] John to the seven churches which are in
[1:15:43] Asia. Grace and peace be unto you. Uh
[1:15:46] from him which is which was and which is
[1:15:49] to come and from the seven spirits which
[1:15:51] are before his throne. from Jesus Christ
[1:15:54] who is the faithful witness and the
[1:15:56] first begotten of the dead and the
[1:15:58] prince of the kings of the earth. Unto
[1:16:01] him that loved us and washed us from our
[1:16:03] sins in his own blood
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; and hath made us
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; kings and priests unto God and his
[1:16:10] father. To him be glory and dominion
[1:16:13] forever and ever.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads one more time.
[1:16:17] Heavenly Father, Lord, we've read your
[1:16:20] word and we ask now, Lord, that you
[1:16:21] would come, Lord, that you would break
[1:16:23] the bread of life, that your children
[1:16:25] could go home satisfied today in Jesus
[1:16:27] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:16:31] God bless you. I want to take my thought
[1:16:33] of this morning out of uh out of verse
[1:16:36] um
[1:16:38] oh, I want to take it out of verse six,
[1:16:40] but let me back up to verse five just to
[1:16:42] get started. It says, "And from Jesus
[1:16:45] Christ who is the faithful witness and
[1:16:49] the first begotten of the dead." And
[1:16:51] this, you know, I I don't have much
[1:16:53] education. And so sometimes when I read,
[1:16:56] uh, I'll be I'll be the first to say
[1:16:58] things, the wording of the scripture
[1:17:00] sometimes stumbles me. I it makes me
[1:17:02] really think, what am I reading? What
[1:17:04] what what Lord, what are you trying to
[1:17:05] say right now? But I want you just to
[1:17:07] read this verse. It says, "And the
[1:17:09] prince," remember who he's speaking of,
[1:17:12] "and from Jesus Christ, who is the
[1:17:14] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:17:16] of the dead, and the prince of the kings
[1:17:21] of the earth,
[1:17:23] and the prince of the kings
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; of the earth."
[1:17:29] Now, I I'm just speak from my ignorance
[1:17:31] this morning. uh you know in in in my
[1:17:36] mind's eye and the way I've always been
[1:17:37] taught is that a king is sovereignly he
[1:17:41] reigns sovereignly.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; His son is the prince.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; His son is the prince.
[1:17:49] But the wording is that the first
[1:17:51] begotten of the dead and the prince
[1:17:55] of the kings
[1:17:57] of the earth.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Wow. and a prince of the kings of the
[1:18:03] earth.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; And so when we begin to look at that
[1:18:07] word prince and I I I actually went to
[1:18:09] the Greek and I begin to study this. I
[1:18:11] begin to look at it and I think Lord,
[1:18:12] what something is I know you've got
[1:18:15] something wonderful here. What is it?
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; And that word prince actually
[1:18:21] is a Greek word by the name of Arong.
[1:18:24] And I'm probably saying it all wrong,
[1:18:26] but [clears throat] I I want you to I
[1:18:28] want you to understand the meaning of it
[1:18:31] first. And it actually it the meaning of
[1:18:33] it is it holds the highest
[1:18:37] and most exalted
[1:18:39] position.
[1:18:42] So it begins to bring a little light on
[1:18:44] what the word is actually saying. the
[1:18:47] prince of the kings of the earth.
[1:18:52] The highest and most exalted position of
[1:18:55] the kings of the earth.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Now this the next verse is uh
[1:19:01] and he has made us kings
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; and priests.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; And he hath made us kings and priests.
[1:19:13] Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You know, there's there's a lot of uh
[1:19:15] there's a lot of kings, you know, in the
[1:19:17] world we live in. We have prime
[1:19:18] ministers. The United States has
[1:19:20] presidents. Some of the countries have
[1:19:21] presidents, but a lot of the world still
[1:19:22] have kings.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And a king is a man. He's a it's a
[1:19:26] position of authority, of supreme
[1:19:28] authority in that country.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't believe for a minute that
[1:19:32] the scripture was talking about those
[1:19:34] kings.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; I don't believe for a minute that it was
[1:19:37] talking about the kings of the world as
[1:19:40] far as the nominal world is concerned.
[1:19:43] But I do believe that he was speaking
[1:19:45] about the kings.
[1:19:47] He has made us kings and priests
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; and he is the most exalted
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; amongst the kings and the priests.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; The kings and the priests.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; So let me let me just go on a little
[1:20:00] bit. I want to uh I I want to take that
[1:20:03] thought of kings and priests and uh if
[1:20:06] the Lord would give me a little bit of
[1:20:07] grace this morning to to to to speak on
[1:20:10] that thought. you you would realize in
[1:20:12] the Old Testament, those of you that
[1:20:13] that study the word and and that have
[1:20:16] been taught in the word, and I know
[1:20:17] you've been well taught here, so I don't
[1:20:18] have to I don't have to stutter too much
[1:20:20] when I'm speaking. Uh you've been well
[1:20:23] taught. Uh you realize that in the Old
[1:20:25] Testament, you know, you could be a king
[1:20:29] or a priest,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; but you could not be a king
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; and a priest,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; right? They were two separate uh uh they
[1:20:38] were two separate offices before God in
[1:20:42] the economy of God. You could be one or
[1:20:44] you could be the other, but you could
[1:20:46] not be both.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; It was just something that that that you
[1:20:50] remember Uzziah. You remember Uzziah the
[1:20:53] king? I'm just going to set just a
[1:20:55] little background. Uzziah the king this
[1:20:57] morning. He uh uh you know he had walked
[1:20:59] into the temple that day and and he had
[1:21:02] God had exalted him in his position to
[1:21:04] to such a place that he actually uh his
[1:21:07] own pride overtook him.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; His own pride overtook him. And God God
[1:21:11] be merciful to us as human in our
[1:21:13] humanity that whatever he whatever
[1:21:15] position he places you in that we never
[1:21:17] think more of ourselves uh than what we
[1:21:20] truly are is just sinners saved by
[1:21:22] grace. Amen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Just s I was I I was visiting with a man
[1:21:25] the other day and he's not a he's not a
[1:21:27] Christian man. I was introduced to him
[1:21:28] by somebody and and uh and uh they
[1:21:32] introduced me as a pastor and he kind of
[1:21:34] looked at me funny. I said, "Well, don't
[1:21:35] stumble on that word." I said, "All it
[1:21:37] means is that I am the servant to
[1:21:38] everybody that's in my congregation."
[1:21:41] Sorry, brother Barry. Hate to bring you
[1:21:43] down to where we're at, but isn't that
[1:21:45] what isn't that the truth?
[1:21:47] You know, we're not way up here, even
[1:21:49] though God has placed us in a position,
[1:21:51] but we're actually here to serve.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And and so, you know, Uzziah
[1:21:55] [clears throat] was a king and he got he
[1:21:56] got to a place where he got so lifted up
[1:21:58] in his position that he actually felt
[1:22:01] like he could go into the temple and
[1:22:03] take the place of a priest.
[1:22:05] Why? Because he was a godly man. Uzziah
[1:22:08] [snorts]
[1:22:08] was a godly man. Uh uh you know, um
[1:22:11] Isaiah had such a high regard for him
[1:22:14] because of his godliness.
[1:22:16] as a young man. And so the time come
[1:22:18] when Uzziah decided that, you know what,
[1:22:20] I I can if if the priests aren't going
[1:22:22] to do this, I can do this myself.
[1:22:24] And in the moment that he made that
[1:22:26] decision and stepped into that vision,
[1:22:28] that part of life, God instantly smokeed
[1:22:30] him.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; He died instantly. Why? Because you
[1:22:34] could be a king
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; or a priest, but you could not be a king
[1:22:38] and a priest.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; It was against what the laws of God
[1:22:42] were. You take Saul, a a great man. Uh
[1:22:45] and you know, he was a king himself. He
[1:22:48] was well-loved. He was uh uh you know,
[1:22:50] he he he had a I want to say he had a
[1:22:52] great ministry.
[1:22:54] But the day that he disobeyed and went
[1:22:56] to make the sacrifice himself
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; immediately.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Immediately.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; I We can't We can't wait for the prophet
[1:23:05] to get here. We need this now.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; we can't wait for the preacher to show
[1:23:09] up. We need to do this now. Yeah.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Isn't patience, no wonder God holds
[1:23:14] patience as such a high virtue?
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Because we live in a now world and
[1:23:20] everything has to happen on our time.
[1:23:21] But if we could just relax and let
[1:23:23] things happen in God's time, you find
[1:23:25] out life goes a lot better.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; You find out life goes a lot better. So,
[1:23:29] so, so, um, just let me get back to my
[1:23:31] my thought this morning. So, you can you
[1:23:33] you understand that you can be a king or
[1:23:34] a priest, but you can't be both in the
[1:23:37] Old Testament. And yet we would find
[1:23:39] Abraham
[1:23:41] after he went to battle for his uh you
[1:23:44] know for his nephew Lot and and won this
[1:23:46] great warfare. The Bible says that he
[1:23:49] actually broke bread with Melzdc
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; who was a king and a priest.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Now in the world in in the religious
[1:24:00] world they're still questioning who's
[1:24:02] Melzdc. But for those who have sat under
[1:24:04] the opening of the word in this age, you
[1:24:07] and I are very aware who Melzdc was.
[1:24:09] Melzdc, we've been taught that Melzdc
[1:24:12] actually was Jesus
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; before he became Jesus.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; So So this is not we that the reality of
[1:24:19] Melzdc just being a a a normal flesh and
[1:24:22] blood man doesn't even exist.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; It doesn't exist. Abraham actually broke
[1:24:26] bread with the King of Kings,
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; with the Lord of Lords. Abraham actually
[1:24:31] broke bread and was blessed.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; But Melchzdc was a different entity. He
[1:24:38] wasn't just a natural man
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; born of a woman. He wasn't just a
[1:24:42] natural king or a natural priest.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; But he was the one that held the office
[1:24:47] from a spiritual standpoint of both king
[1:24:50] and priest.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Understand?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Understand? All right.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm gonna I'm trying to save time
[1:24:57] this morning, so I feel like I'm rushing
[1:24:59] and I don't
[1:25:01] That's good, brother. Relax.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; It's like we just get into, you know, at
[1:25:08] home we have we have uh we have a mixed
[1:25:12] culture at home, too. We have black
[1:25:14] people. We have uh we have the uh
[1:25:16] Mexican people and we have the North
[1:25:18] American Indian people. And and we tease
[1:25:20] them all the time and they don't take
[1:25:23] they don't have no problem with it. They
[1:25:25] just say, "Hey, I'm on Indian time right
[1:25:26] now." I'm like, "That's real hard on us
[1:25:28] white people because we like to be like
[1:25:29] punctual." And they're like, "Yeah, I
[1:25:31] know. But when we get there, we'll get
[1:25:32] there." And I wish I could be like that.
[1:25:34] Wouldn't take a lot of pressure off.
[1:25:35] Brother Paul, don't you wish all of the
[1:25:37] people that wanted you to do Renos were
[1:25:39] like that? It's okay. Whenever you get
[1:25:42] here, it'll be all right.
[1:25:45] But you understand Jesus when we
[1:25:47] understand scripturally that Jesus Go to
[1:25:50] the book of Hebrews for one minute.
[1:25:52] Hebrews chapter 7. Brothers, if you
[1:25:53] could just pull it up for one minute
[1:25:55] because we're talking about that you
[1:25:57] can't be a king. That you couldn't be a
[1:25:58] king or a a king and a priest. You had
[1:26:01] to be either or in the Old Testament.
[1:26:03] Yes. I yet I just read scripture to you
[1:26:05] out of the book of Revelations where the
[1:26:06] Bible says, "He hath made us
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; kings and priests."
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; So Lord, how do you how does this
[1:26:15] happen? If you couldn't be that in the
[1:26:16] Old Testament, how does this happen now?
[1:26:18] And so we jump over to the book of
[1:26:20] Hebrews and we get into Hebrews chapter
[1:26:22] 7 and it says this starting at verse 14.
[1:26:25] It says, "For it's evident that our Lord
[1:26:27] sprang out of Judah, of which tribe
[1:26:30] Moses spoke nothing concerning the
[1:26:31] priesthood. And it is yet far more
[1:26:33] evident that after the similitude of
[1:26:37] Melzdc,
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; there arose another priest."
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And I love this. who is made not after
[1:26:44] the law of a carnal commandment but
[1:26:47] after the power of an endless life.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; There arose another priest and he hath
[1:26:54] made us
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; kings
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; and priests.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, you are not a priest a
[1:27:01] priesthood after the order of the ironic
[1:27:03] priesthood.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; But we have come in an order of the
[1:27:06] Melzdc priesthood. And if he had, the
[1:27:09] Bible says this, "And it was made not
[1:27:11] after the law of carnal commandment."
[1:27:14] Hallelujah.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, we're not here, we're not here
[1:27:17] uh preaching legalism,
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; We're not here preaching legalism that
[1:27:21] you got to do this and you got to do
[1:27:22] that and you got to do this or you're
[1:27:24] not. No, no. We're preaching life.
[1:27:26] Hallelujah.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; And if you ever get the the the the the
[1:27:29] nature change on the inside, you don't
[1:27:31] have to be told that my, you know, I
[1:27:33] don't cut my hair and I don't wear
[1:27:34] lipstick and I don't wear earrings. I
[1:27:36] don't go to the bar and I don't watch
[1:27:37] it. You don't because there's a life, an
[1:27:40] endless life on the inside that's
[1:27:43] already tap. It's tapping you on the
[1:27:44] shoulder and saying, "Hey son, that's
[1:27:46] not wrong. Hey daughter, that's not
[1:27:48] becoming to my children." And you and
[1:27:50] and you are conforming. You're reforming
[1:27:53] into the image of Christ. Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; So the scripture says he's made not
[1:28:00] after the law of carnal commandment but
[1:28:01] after the power of an endless life.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; For he testifies that thou art a priest
[1:28:06] forever
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; after the order of Melzdc.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; So we know Jesus absolutely has got the
[1:28:13] title of a of the of the priest
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; of the priest. Not just a priest but the
[1:28:18] priest. But you jump over to Revelations
[1:28:21] 19 and he comes running uh you know he
[1:28:23] comes riding out of the heavens and on
[1:28:25] his thigh is written a name and what is
[1:28:27] it?
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; King of kings.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; King of kings. And he hath made us
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; kings. And isn't this wonderful church?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Listen although we are the very part of
[1:28:42] the essence of his being he is still the
[1:28:45] head. He still stands alone as the
[1:28:48] redeemer. He still stands as as God the
[1:28:52] creator. And we are still part of his
[1:28:55] body. But we are just not we're not just
[1:28:57] him,
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; but we're part of him.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; All right. [clears throat]
[1:29:04] He hath made us. Let me just stop on
[1:29:06] this a little bit because I I I I just
[1:29:08] get excited when I think of these
[1:29:09] things. And And you you got you you've
[1:29:12] been going through the church ages, I'm
[1:29:13] sure. I heard a couple years ago you
[1:29:14] were. I don't know where you're at right
[1:29:15] now, Brother Barry, but but I know you
[1:29:17] were then, so this is probably still
[1:29:18] familiar to us. Brother Brown says this.
[1:29:20] He says, he takes that one little
[1:29:22] phrase, he has made us.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And he makes this statement. He said,
[1:29:26] "Oh, there are certain truths that we
[1:29:29] need to emphasize."
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I take that personally as as a part
[1:29:34] of the ministry, as a pastor. There are
[1:29:36] certain truths that we need to
[1:29:39] emphasize, and this is one of them.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; This is one of them. He hath made us.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; He Come on, church. Who has made us?
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Are you here on your own on your own uh
[1:29:54] uh uncction on your own reality this
[1:29:56] morning? Are you here because uh you
[1:29:59] know just because your mom and dad
[1:30:00] brought you in? No. No. He
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; He hath made us.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, if we can just keep him as God.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. He has made us.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Let me do this for a minute.
[1:30:13] [clears throat] He said salvation is his
[1:30:15] doing. Salvation is of the Lord.
[1:30:20] All of grace, he's redeemed us for a
[1:30:22] purpose.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; He bought us for [clears throat] a
[1:30:25] purpose.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; We are
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; kings.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Can we say that together this morning?
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; We are kings.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Spiritual kings.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; You see, we we we want this. We want
[1:30:42] just the title of a king. We want the we
[1:30:44] want the accolades of the king. We want
[1:30:46] we want the respect of the king. We we
[1:30:49] want to walk like that.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram says, "Hey, you will be
[1:30:53] kings over there." Yes, we will be kings
[1:30:55] there. But here's the reality. We are
[1:30:58] already kings.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; We are reigning already in a different
[1:31:03] kingdom.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Not one that is touched by by hands. Not
[1:31:06] one that is uh uh not one that is uh um
[1:31:10] you know that you can that you can
[1:31:11] actually look at or not one that people
[1:31:13] bow to you. But we are right now
[1:31:16] reigning as kings.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; As kings. And brother Brandham says
[1:31:20] this. He says we are spiritual kings and
[1:31:24] we reign over a spiritual kingdom.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Over church. If there's one thing that
[1:31:30] needs to be emphasized today.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; This is that thing.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now, you are already a king
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; and you are already reigning. You say,
[1:31:40] "Brother Dwayne, I don't feel like I'm
[1:31:41] reigning." But you're already reigning
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; in the kingdom of God. [applause]
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And the only person that's not
[1:31:48] recognizing that right now is you.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Because all hell recognizes your
[1:31:53] position.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And when you take your position, they've
[1:31:57] got to back down.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are the you you are the
[1:32:01] king.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; You're the one that's reigning. Listen.
[1:32:04] He says, "For by one man's offense death
[1:32:07] reigned, much more they which receive
[1:32:10] abundance of grace and of the gift of
[1:32:12] righteousness shall reign in life."
[1:32:14] Shall reign where? In life.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Shall do what? Shall reign in life.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; That mean church, that means you have an
[1:32:23] authority.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; You're not you're not just a servant
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; to the to this world. We're we're a
[1:32:29] servant to the kingdom, but we are not
[1:32:31] servant to this world.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, if we Who's of a higher order,
[1:32:37] you or a dog?
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Who's of higher order? You or or a
[1:32:43] horse?
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; You or an eagle?
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Who's of higher order?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; You were created. The Bible says we were
[1:32:52] created in the very image
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; of God. Yeah.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; And and because of the fall, we lost the
[1:32:59] reality of the of this one thing that
[1:33:01] now we are the sons of God.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; We lost the reality of that. And the
[1:33:06] opening of the word has come back to
[1:33:08] bring us back into our position.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan, Lucifer walked right
[1:33:14] there in the garden
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; with Adam,
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; with Eve.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; He was present in the garden with him.
[1:33:22] And do you think Adam was afraid? Not
[1:33:24] one moment.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Do you think Adam feared what? All of
[1:33:28] Satan's powers. Not even for a moment.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Adam was created in the
[1:33:34] image of God.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Adam [screaming] was created in the
[1:33:38] image of God.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; We sing those little songs, "What have I
[1:33:41] to dread? What have I to fear? I'm
[1:33:42] leaning on the everlasting arm." Listen,
[1:33:45] you're not just leaning on his arm.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; You're part of his very DNA.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; You're part of the almighty God. And
[1:33:54] Satan knows it and he trembles.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; But you've got to step into that
[1:34:00] position that I am a son of God. I was
[1:34:03] put here to reign over
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; this world.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Brother say right now we reign with
[1:34:10] Christ having dominion.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Over.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Right now we reign.
[1:34:20] That means rulership
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; with Christ having dominion over
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, church, say it with me.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Sin. You know why I'm why? You know why
[1:34:30] I'm trying to get this to you this
[1:34:32] morning? You know why I'm asking you to
[1:34:33] repeat this? I want you to walk out of
[1:34:36] this building. I want you to put your
[1:34:38] head on the pillow and I want these
[1:34:41] words to come back to you that I am a
[1:34:44] son of God. I was placed as good. He
[1:34:47] made me a king and I can rule over sin.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; I am here to rule. Listen, we're not
[1:34:54] here to be to be uh uh uh run down and
[1:34:57] trotten over and manipulated and and and
[1:35:00] and and and you know, and chained by the
[1:35:03] sins of the world. You're here to reign
[1:35:05] over them.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to rule, having dominion
[1:35:10] over sin.
[1:35:13] Over the world.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Over the world.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Dwayne, my I got
[1:35:21] weaknesses." Listen, you have got what
[1:35:23] it takes on the inside of you.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Why don't you call the great fighter to
[1:35:28] to, you know, instead of leaving them
[1:35:30] back in the corner somewhere,
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; you know, this is this is a hockey this
[1:35:34] is a hockey community. This is, you
[1:35:35] know, this this little Calgary is all
[1:35:37] about hockey. And I was all about hockey
[1:35:38] when I was a kid. You know what one of
[1:35:40] the uh one of the uh the the the the
[1:35:43] strategy, if I could say,
[1:35:46] of some of the coaches is in the hockey
[1:35:48] teams is that you know, you've got a
[1:35:50] superstar and and and you need to make a
[1:35:52] goal. So you put the superstar on the
[1:35:54] ice, you know what they do when the
[1:35:55] superstar gets on the ice? If he makes
[1:35:58] one goal or two, guess what? They got
[1:36:01] these guys that sit on the bench that
[1:36:04] are these great big huge guys. They
[1:36:06] can't hardly play hockey for a lick. But
[1:36:09] if they could hit you, if they can take
[1:36:11] you out, if they can somehow uh
[1:36:14] immobilize you, if they can just get you
[1:36:17] out of the game,
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; y
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; they'll win. That's right.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; That's how we treat our God sometimes.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; The champion is sitting in the corner of
[1:36:30] our lives. And just like the disciples
[1:36:33] on the boat that day when the ship is
[1:36:35] rocking and reeling and the waves are
[1:36:37] coming overboard and they think they're
[1:36:38] going to drown and it's not till that
[1:36:41] moment until they've done all they can
[1:36:44] do. They've cried all they can cried and
[1:36:46] then in one moment they realize oh
[1:36:50] Jesus is in the boat.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; It's time to call him up.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; It's time Listen, we're we're in Lady
[1:36:57] Aia. This is the greatest warfare ever.
[1:36:59] Uh-huh.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; It's time to call him up.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; He's not somewhere's out in the
[1:37:04] eternities, church. If if you've been
[1:37:06] birthed again by the seed of God, he is
[1:37:08] right on the inside of you waiting to
[1:37:12] come, waiting to be called up.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Right now, we reign with Christ having
[1:37:19] dominion over sin. The world,
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; what does it say?
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; The what?
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; The what?
[1:37:29] You mean I have do I can have dominion
[1:37:31] over my flesh?
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; And we let our flesh take control of us
[1:37:39] over and over and over and over. Let me
[1:37:42] just give you I'm I I'm pretty relaxed.
[1:37:46] You know, I I come from I come from a
[1:37:49] place where there's lots of road and
[1:37:51] there's long distances and there's not a
[1:37:52] lot of people and I love it that way.
[1:37:54] So, so, so when you get into a big city
[1:37:55] and there's cars going this way and that
[1:37:57] way and everybody's doing this and you
[1:38:00] know I don't get too excited, but I have
[1:38:01] a wife that she doesn't she's a little
[1:38:04] more anxious than I am.
[1:38:07] And I know some of you all
[1:38:11] somebody cut you off, man. It don't take
[1:38:13] long and you in the flesh.
[1:38:22] But my Bible says that he has dominion
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; over my flesh.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And about the time that rises up,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; something else says, "But what for?"
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; What? So you can make it home one minute
[1:38:36] and 30 seconds faster.
[1:38:40] [screaming]
[1:38:44] Whoa.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; And what you don't know is that there's
[1:38:48] an accident waiting for you three blocks
[1:38:50] up the road
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; and the angel of God just put somebody
[1:38:53] right in front of your way and now
[1:38:54] you're all upset about it.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just learn to relax?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Just let God have his way. So what if I
[1:39:01] don't get home?
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; He has given us dominion over sin,
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; over the world,
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; over the flesh,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; and let's get this one for sure this
[1:39:17] morning,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; and over
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; my brother.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; And over my wife
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; or my husband.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And over
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; the devil. Yes.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the ruler,
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; the one who is ruling
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; this world right now.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; God's given you
[1:39:47] as a king dominion
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; over him
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; in my name. They'll cast out
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; devils.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; You know, we sometimes we just take that
[1:39:58] so lightly. I'll tell you what, I was
[1:40:01] [clears throat] telling somebody the
[1:40:02] other day, there's, you know, there's a
[1:40:04] many a time I go before I go to the
[1:40:05] pulpit. Listen, you think Satan stopped
[1:40:08] at the door when you walked in?
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, he didn't.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; He come right in and sit down right
[1:40:17] beside you.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And some of you all are thinking about
[1:40:20] what you got to do tomorrow. He's been
[1:40:21] chirping in your ear. Some of you are
[1:40:23] thinking about about the nasty fight you
[1:40:25] just had with your husband or your wife
[1:40:27] before you got here. And oh, how can
[1:40:28] this ever be? and what am I going to
[1:40:29] blah blah and and you're worried about
[1:40:31] your f listen comes right in.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody the other day I
[1:40:35] said there's hardly a time anymore but
[1:40:37] when I go to the pulpit where I get down
[1:40:39] before the Lord in my office and I take
[1:40:41] the liberty that God has given me and
[1:40:44] cast those spirits out so the children
[1:40:47] of God can have what they need in the
[1:40:49] morning.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, God has given us dominion. That
[1:40:54] means when we say he's got to go, he has
[1:40:57] got to go.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Does it mean he's going to stay gone? Oh
[1:41:02] no. Walk out the door and he'll be right
[1:41:04] back.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; But it's up to you to tell him where he
[1:41:07] can go.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Listen. Either you open the door and let
[1:41:10] him in or you close the door.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Resist the devil. He will flee.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; He will flee. You got a temptation that
[1:41:17] you can't overcome. Resist the devil.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; He will flee.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:23] Ephesians chapter 6 says, uh, let me,
[1:41:25] you go, you all know what it says. You
[1:41:27] know, I I'll be way too long if I start
[1:41:28] reading scriptures this morning, but you
[1:41:30] understand that we're not wrestling with
[1:41:31] with with with natural things, but we're
[1:41:34] wrestling with principalities and powers
[1:41:36] and rulers of uh, you know, rulers of
[1:41:39] the darkness and and what are they here
[1:41:40] to do? They're here to destroy you.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; They're here to destroy your life.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Cast down
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; imagination." Remember, you're a king.
[1:41:52] That puts you in rulership in authority.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to have authority over you.
[1:41:58] I'm here to have authority over Satan
[1:42:00] and all of his kingdom.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Which this flesh happens to be part of,
[1:42:05] it's going to die one day.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Cast down imaginations. Every high thing
[1:42:11] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:42:13] of God,
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; bringing into captivity
[1:42:18] every thought.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] every thought.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; To the obedience of Christ.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; He has made us kings and priests.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; What is a king and a priest? You're part
[1:42:37] of a royal lineage this morning.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; I I I want you to say that. I want you
[1:42:42] to see that this morning. You're part of
[1:42:43] a The scripture has placed us. The
[1:42:46] anointing of this age has come to place
[1:42:48] us in a position where you recognize
[1:42:51] like Caleb did that day. Caleb 85 years
[1:42:55] old, I believe he was.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; You know, he'd already spent years
[1:42:58] helping his brothers uh uh uh uh settle
[1:43:01] in their land.
[1:43:03] And here he comes up comes back to
[1:43:06] Joshua to remind Joshua of a promise
[1:43:09] that was given him before they ever went
[1:43:11] over.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; I want my land.
[1:43:15] Which land was it?
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's where the Anakin the uh the the
[1:43:20] Anakans are. I think that's the right
[1:43:21] word.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; The biggest of all the giants.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Caleb wasn't looking at his age. He was
[1:43:27] looking at a promise.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; He's like, "That is my land, and if I
[1:43:30] need to go and fight him, I'm more than
[1:43:32] able."
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not our flesh that
[1:43:36] we're considering. We're considering the
[1:43:38] God who is now dwelling in our flesh.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me go back to my thoughts this
[1:43:44] morning. He's made us kings and priests.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; You know, I was I I I got to looking at
[1:43:49] this and I got to remembering uh uh one
[1:43:51] of um of Saul's children
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; in the Bible. How many remembers
[1:43:56] Mphibicheth or Jonathan? Not Saul. It's
[1:43:58] Jonathan. That's grandchild to Saul.
[1:44:00] Saul. That was Jonathan's child.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Remember David and Saul were such David
[1:44:04] and Jonathan were such good friends. And
[1:44:08] you remember when uh you know all the
[1:44:10] all the chaos that was in Saul's home
[1:44:12] and and and David, you know, they got to
[1:44:14] that place where David had to run.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; He remember he got his bow and his arrow
[1:44:18] and said, "Hey, listen, Jonathan, you
[1:44:20] tell me if everything is okay. You know,
[1:44:22] you you just hey, it's beyond the wall
[1:44:26] or no, it's over here. I'll know I can
[1:44:28] come back or I know I better run."
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; But before they before they finished
[1:44:32] that agreement, they made an agreement
[1:44:34] between each other as friends.
[1:44:36] said, "Listen, we've been boozing
[1:44:39] friends for years now. If I've got to
[1:44:43] go, I want I want us to remain friends.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And your family will remain my friend."
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Remember, they made this agreement.
[1:44:54] That's right.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Well, if we just jump forward a little
[1:44:57] bit, we understand that that when the
[1:44:59] the last battle was going on and Saul
[1:45:01] had been killed and and now the the
[1:45:03] enemy was coming in and some of uh
[1:45:06] Saul's wives and some of the the the
[1:45:08] women that were involved there, one of
[1:45:10] them picked up Mphibicheth, which was
[1:45:12] just Jonathan's little boy, just a
[1:45:15] little fell at the time. They picked him
[1:45:17] up and they begin to run. They were
[1:45:19] running for safety. And in their in
[1:45:20] their in their exit, they dropped
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Mphibicheth.
[1:45:24] remember the story.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:45:27] I'm going to stop right there. They
[1:45:30] dropped Mphibicheth. Now, let's just
[1:45:32] back up a minute.
[1:45:35] Who was his grandfather?
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Saul. Was Saul a king?
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; He was a king.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; So, without God coming, and we know God
[1:45:46] was changing the picture.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; But if God not changed the picture, who
[1:45:51] would have been the next king?
[1:45:53] Jonathan,
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; it follows the lineage.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Who would have become the next king?
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Mphibicheth.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; But now we've got a change in the in the
[1:46:05] order of God's plans. And we find out
[1:46:08] Mphibicheth should have been king.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; He was in the lineage,
[1:46:14] but he was dropped.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; I want us just to get this.
[1:46:18] He was dropped
[1:46:21] and his life changed instantly
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; to one of brokenness,
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; sorrow, hardship.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; You understand? He was he would he would
[1:46:34] have been king,
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; but his life changed instantly. I want
[1:46:39] to I want to I want to jump over to 2
[1:46:41] Samuel chapter nine while I'm while I'm
[1:46:43] on this.
[1:46:45] says, "And David said, 2 Samuel 9
[1:46:47] starting at 1 says, and David said, is
[1:46:48] there anything left of the house of Saul
[1:46:51] that I might show kindness for
[1:46:53] Jonathan's sake, and there was of the
[1:46:56] house of Saul a servant whose name was
[1:46:57] Zeba. And they called him unto David the
[1:47:00] king, and said unto him, "Art thou
[1:47:01] Zeba?" And he said, "Thy servant is he?"
[1:47:04] And the king said, "Is there not yet any
[1:47:08] of the house of Saul that I may show
[1:47:09] kindness of God unto him?" And Zeba said
[1:47:13] unto the king, Jonathan yet has a son
[1:47:19] which is lame on his feet. And the king
[1:47:23] said, "Where is he?" And Zeba said unto
[1:47:27] him, "Behold, he's in the house of
[1:47:28] Makir, the son of Am in Lobbar." Now,
[1:47:32] that maybe word doesn't mean anything to
[1:47:34] you, but if you just go and look up the
[1:47:35] actual meaning of it, it actually means
[1:47:37] a ghetto.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; A ghetto. The name means nothing. No
[1:47:42] thing. No place, no pasture, no nothing.
[1:47:46] Here is the son of a king living in this
[1:47:50] condition,
[1:47:51] broken. His his his walk is lame. He
[1:47:57] there's nothing. He He radiates nothing
[1:48:00] of royalty. I thought, God, that's me. I
[1:48:04] came to this world just like that.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; The son of a king. Yet my life was
[1:48:10] broken. I had nothing to offer. I was
[1:48:13] nothing. Nowhere's going nowhere except
[1:48:16] you reached down your hand for me.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Here's the King David. And he's asking,
[1:48:20] "Is there anybody? Is there anybody left
[1:48:23] that I could show kindness to?" Oh, I'm
[1:48:25] so thankful that he showed kindness to
[1:48:26] me this morning.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; You realize you could be a king in that
[1:48:34] day. Something interesting. I just came
[1:48:36] studying this. You could be a king and
[1:48:38] you could still be lame.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; But you know, you could not be a priest
[1:48:44] and be lame.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Now, just a second. The scripture says
[1:48:48] he's made us kings and priests.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; You could be a king and be lame, but you
[1:48:56] couldn't be a priest and be lame.
[1:49:01] That would pretty much take care of all
[1:49:02] of our lives, wouldn't it? Right?
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; That would take care of all of our
[1:49:07] lives.
[1:49:10] You
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; know, sometimes we
[1:49:12] we look at Mphibicheth
[1:49:15] and we see that God had something for
[1:49:17] him
[1:49:19] and we look at his life and how it
[1:49:21] seemed like it was so destroyed.
[1:49:24] But I'm here to say that God never
[1:49:25] forgets.
[1:49:27] Amen.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; It looked like his life had been so
[1:49:29] destroyed and for years he had lived
[1:49:32] like a popper in a ghetto and nothing
[1:49:35] and nobody no nothing to look forward to
[1:49:38] in his life. And yet God had never
[1:49:40] forgot about him.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; God had never overlooked him. And many
[1:49:45] times we've, you know, in our the way we
[1:49:47] come to this world, we come in our the
[1:49:49] our families and you know things happen
[1:49:51] in our lives that that create
[1:49:53] circumstances that we also Our walk
[1:49:56] becomes a disaster.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Our lives become broken. There's really
[1:50:02] nothing that's left of us. And somehow
[1:50:04] somewhere's in the mercy of God, he
[1:50:06] reaches his hand down.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; He He knows where you're at. Maybe
[1:50:10] you're right there this morning.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Maybe you can look at uh maybe the
[1:50:14] complexes of your life. Maybe things
[1:50:15] have happened in your life, in your in
[1:50:17] your marriage, in your childhood, and
[1:50:19] how I've witnessed this as a pastor.
[1:50:21] things that happened in people's
[1:50:22] childhoods and bring them forward 25
[1:50:25] years and they relive them. They're
[1:50:27] going through them like it just happened
[1:50:28] right now. And the torment and the
[1:50:30] pressure of it is so great it just
[1:50:32] breaks them all apart.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; But God knows where you're at.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; You might think the pastor forgot you.
[1:50:39] You might think the deacons have forgot
[1:50:41] you. You might think your family has
[1:50:42] forgot you. But God knows where you're
[1:50:45] at.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; And he knows how to bring to your to to
[1:50:49] somebody's remembrance. He knows how to
[1:50:52] reach you.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Your walk, your your hindered walk can
[1:50:59] only go so far before God says that's
[1:51:01] enough.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; That's enough.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; I speak about you couldn't be a lame
[1:51:06] priest. And I'm going to just turn over
[1:51:07] scripturally. If you're Is this okay
[1:51:09] this morning?
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Can I have a a little bit longer?
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; He might not have me back for five more
[1:51:14] years. So,
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Leviticus chapter 21. I want you to go
[1:51:18] to Leviticus. I want to I want to set
[1:51:20] the stage here because you scripturally
[1:51:22] you could not be if you were lame you
[1:51:25] could not be a priest.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; But he tells us he's made us kings and
[1:51:30] priests
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; and you can look in the mirror. I'm not
[1:51:33] talking of God's word. I'm talking in
[1:51:34] the mirror of your bathroom and you can
[1:51:37] see all of your brokenness, all of your
[1:51:39] weakness, all of your lameness and then
[1:51:42] say, "How can God how God? How can you?"
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Satan wants from
[1:51:47] you. But there is another mirror.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; There's another mirror that does not
[1:51:53] reflect all of our brokenness.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Leviticus chapter 21, if you
[1:51:59] got it, brothers, starting at verse 16.
[1:52:01] I'm just going to bring in this lame
[1:52:02] priest portion. Says, "And the Lord
[1:52:04] spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto
[1:52:06] Aaron.
[1:52:08] speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he
[1:52:10] be of thy seed in their generation that
[1:52:13] hath any blemish, let him not approach
[1:52:19] to offer the bread of his God.
[1:52:22] Oh my,
[1:52:24] oh my.
[1:52:26] For whatsoever man he be that hath a
[1:52:28] blemish, he shall not approach, a blind
[1:52:32] man,
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; or a lame, or he that has a flat nose,
[1:52:35] or anything superfluous, or a man that
[1:52:37] is broken footed, brokenhanded, crooked
[1:52:40] back, a dwarf, he that has a blemish in
[1:52:41] his eyes, or be scurvy or scabbed,
[1:52:43] stones broken. No man, he that hath a
[1:52:46] blemish of the seed of Aaron, the priest
[1:52:49] shall come nigh. Did I read that right?
[1:52:52] No man that hath the blemish of the seed
[1:52:54] of Aaron, the priest shall come nigh to
[1:52:56] the off to offer the offerings of the
[1:52:57] Lord made by fire. He hath a blemish. He
[1:53:01] shall not come nigh to offer his bread,
[1:53:03] offer the bread of his God.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; That don't leave us in a very good
[1:53:08] position from a natural perspective,
[1:53:10] does it?
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; There would be pretty few
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; kings and priests
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; if it was if we were still living by the
[1:53:18] law.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that he sees me
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; through a different mirror.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for the blood this
[1:53:31] morning?
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Bible says, listen, I'm going to go back
[1:53:34] to reading the scriptures. And he has
[1:53:36] made us. Not scriptures, brother. I'm
[1:53:37] speaking again. He has made us. He has
[1:53:42] made us. Yes, sir.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; How can we the clay declare to the
[1:53:47] potter, why have you made me thus?
[1:53:51] Why have you made me this way?
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand this morning,
[1:53:55] church,
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; that the Bible says, "But we are
[1:53:58] fearfully, wonderfully made."
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; That means that you are. So, I'm going
[1:54:02] to use Can I use you this morning,
[1:54:03] brother? Would you stand to your feet?
[1:54:05] All right. You, brother, stand to your
[1:54:08] feet. Brother Ameilian, I want you to
[1:54:11] stand to your feet. And I want some Give
[1:54:13] me somebody who's short. Where's that
[1:54:15] brother that prayed? He's not very big.
[1:54:16] Where is he at? Hold on. I I mean in I
[1:54:19] mean stature-wise
[1:54:21] right there. Just turn around for a
[1:54:23] minute, brothers. Turn around for a
[1:54:24] minute. Face the congregation.
[1:54:30] Identical twins
[1:54:33] or quadruplets or whatever you want to
[1:54:34] call them.
[1:54:37] No. Why?
[1:54:39] Brother Dan, put your hand up.
[1:54:41] Brother, raise your hand.
[1:54:44] Brother, raise your hand.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Do they all raise them the same?
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; No, they're all just a little bit
[1:54:51] different.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Brothers, smile at them. I mean, show
[1:54:54] your teeth.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they're all just a little bit
[1:55:00] different.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Bible says you're
[1:55:03] fearful. Thank you, brothers. Thank you.
[1:55:04] I'm sorry if I put you on the spot. You
[1:55:06] forgive me and talk to your pastor.
[1:55:09] [applause]
[1:55:09] Bible says that we're fearfully and
[1:55:12] we're wonderfully made.
[1:55:14] And do you know what that means? That
[1:55:15] you come with uniquenesses that I don't
[1:55:18] come with. And God has wired you in a
[1:55:20] way that I am not wired. And he makes
[1:55:23] you a certain type of character. And
[1:55:25] there's things that just, you know, uh
[1:55:28] there's things that mean, Brother Paul,
[1:55:30] I'm going to use you this morning.
[1:55:30] Brother Barry, I'm going to use you
[1:55:32] because these I know these men
[1:55:33] personally. And I know their lives. And
[1:55:35] I know that they're contractors and I
[1:55:37] know the kind of workmanship they do.
[1:55:39] And I be embarrassed for them to come to
[1:55:41] my house. I'm building a house. But the
[1:55:44] moment they walk in, as much as they
[1:55:45] don't want to see it, they just want to
[1:55:48] come in and say, "Oh, nice place."
[1:55:50] Immediately, everything comes to light.
[1:55:52] All the flaws that show up, you know
[1:55:54] what? I could walk into your house a
[1:55:56] thousand times and never see one of
[1:55:57] those flaws. Cuz I'm not made that way.
[1:56:01] But you are made that way. And God built
[1:56:03] you that way. And he wants you that way.
[1:56:06] So why do we try to be like everybody
[1:56:09] else?
[1:56:11] God made you specifically the way you
[1:56:13] are.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; And he wants to use you the way he made
[1:56:18] you. I'm not here to criticize this man,
[1:56:21] that man, how they do this, how if
[1:56:23] that's the way they do it, praise God.
[1:56:25] That's what that works for them. It
[1:56:27] doesn't work for me.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that I'm any less
[1:56:30] a son than they are.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Or any less a king than they are or any
[1:56:35] less a priest than they are.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He He hath made us.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; He has made us.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; I I was I was in the office and I was
[1:56:45] enjoying your worship. I I said I said
[1:56:47] to Brother Barry, "Brother Paul must be
[1:56:48] just enjoying leading worship anymore."
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; I mean, I I'm just be honest, man. Some
[1:56:53] of us are,
[1:56:55] you all laugh, but but the truth of it
[1:56:56] is I saw you right on camera, so you
[1:56:58] can't lie. Some of you white as I am,
[1:57:00] and you can't lift a hand. You can't
[1:57:02] even break a smile. I wonder if you know
[1:57:04] who's president. No, I don't. I take
[1:57:06] that back.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; I take that back. And I'm sorry, Lord.
[1:57:10] We are all built differently.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; I take that back. We are all uniquely
[1:57:15] made.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; But I'm so happy when I see people that
[1:57:19] just can let go and let God. And they,
[1:57:21] you know, I that's a person I want to be
[1:57:24] black in the inside,
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; even if I'm white on the outside. I got
[1:57:28] a brother that's pretty close.
[1:57:31] And he's made us
[1:57:33] king. Oh, he has made us priests. Now
[1:57:36] I'm going back to to uh to what brother
[1:57:38] Brown said. Yes, he has made us priests
[1:57:41] unto him. Now what does a priest do?
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Offering
[1:57:47] spiritual
[1:57:49] praise.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. of sanctified lips, spending our
[1:57:54] lives as a sweet offering unto him,
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; worshiping him in spirit and in truth,
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; interceding and petitioning,
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; priests and kings unto our God.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; You think, well, Brother Dwayne, I'm I'm
[1:58:12] I'm not a priest, aren't you?
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; He said we're priests.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; So then let's act like them. Amen.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; You know, it's most sometimes this in
[1:58:23] our humanity.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the hardest thing I don't I
[1:58:27] don't know if I can speak for you right
[1:58:28] now, brother Barry, but I'm speak I'm
[1:58:29] going to speak for me. When I was a kid,
[1:58:32] I was the most shy kid in school. If I
[1:58:34] had to be in front of anybody, I melted.
[1:58:37] I never dreamt that I would be this
[1:58:39] today.
[1:58:41] But for a person to go from that to
[1:58:43] this, you've got to break through the
[1:58:45] uncomfortableness of your own self.
[1:58:49] And you got to keep letting God take a
[1:58:51] little getting a little victory out of
[1:58:52] your life. Little victory out of your
[1:58:54] life until you can just let go and let
[1:58:56] God.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; And sometimes when somebody, you know,
[1:59:00] if somebody would do something kind for
[1:59:01] you, you'd almost feel like, "Ah, I'm
[1:59:03] not worthy. I shouldn't." Listen, God's
[1:59:05] done the greatest thing, given us the
[1:59:07] greatest of all gifts.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; He's given us eternal life,
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; made us kings and priests,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; and we still act like servants.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I'm not talking about
[1:59:19] arrogance as a king. The king of kings
[1:59:22] on this earth was the most humble man
[1:59:24] there was.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; But I am talking about taking our
[1:59:27] positions as kings and priests.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Dwayne, you come to church.
[1:59:33] What do you come for?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; To offer a spiritual sacrifice
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; to offer praise to the God, the the God
[1:59:42] of all gods. I'm talking about capital G
[1:59:45] God, not the little G gods.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; We come to offer ourselves as a as a
[1:59:50] sacrifice unto him. And if that means
[1:59:52] that I look silly to you, I'm sorry.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. If that means I get, you
[1:59:58] know, we sing that little song, I'm
[2:00:00] going to get carried away when I get
[2:00:01] carried away. But why do we have to wait
[2:00:03] till we get carried away? Why can't we
[2:00:05] just worship him now as like we were
[2:00:07] there then?
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; We're we're priests.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're priests. When somebody goes
[2:00:14] to hurting and God, the spirit of God
[2:00:16] comes on your life and he begins to to
[2:00:18] to look at that life, it's him that
[2:00:21] begins to intercede.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; He might pull you into a place where
[2:00:25] you're so burdened for somebody and
[2:00:27] nobody in the congregation is. But God's
[2:00:29] not looking at that. He wants you.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; He's using your life.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; And then he might take somebody else's
[2:00:35] life and do something. All of a sudden,
[2:00:37] uh, you know, they're sitting at home
[2:00:39] and the spirit of God comes on them and
[2:00:41] and and a song of worship is given to
[2:00:44] them. He wants them to bring it here
[2:00:45] right then and he wants them to express
[2:00:47] that.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's the spirit of God in
[2:00:51] you.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; He's made us priests.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "No wonder the
[2:00:56] world does not appeal to us.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; We are a peculiar people,
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; zealous unto unto good works. We been
[2:01:03] recreated in him to be children of the
[2:01:07] father.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Seven church ages. Brother Brown says
[2:01:10] he's made us priests and kings. Lord God
[2:01:13] help me. Spiritual priesthood. A royal
[2:01:16] nation. Spiritual offering. What is it?
[2:01:18] Spiritual sacrifice. That's it. Fruits
[2:01:21] of our lips.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Giving praise to his name.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Man, if you can't sing,
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; then clap.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Make a noise. Make a noise.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Stomp your foot.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Wave your arms. Oh, I I get too
[2:01:37] uncomfortable waving your arms. Try it
[2:01:39] one time.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; I'll tell tell you a little story about
[2:01:41] a young brother back at home, young
[2:01:43] married man back at home. He said, "You
[2:01:44] know, we're we're pretty German back at
[2:01:46] home." And and and it has its goods and
[2:01:48] its bads, but this is not one of the the
[2:01:49] royal parts of a German. We are
[2:01:51] Christians
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; above all. We're Christians, but our
[2:01:55] natures are very, you know, we're very
[2:01:58] boxed up and then it's not altogether
[2:02:00] good. And this [clears throat] young
[2:02:02] brother said, "Brother Dwayne, I was
[2:02:03] sitting in church. You've heard brother
[2:02:04] Brown say this." He said, "I was sitting
[2:02:07] in church the other day, brother. The
[2:02:09] word of God was coming. I wanted to
[2:02:10] shout so bad." I said, "Why didn't you?"
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Here's a 30-year-old man with a family
[2:02:17] who he's raising to serve God, and he's
[2:02:20] boxed up.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How's your family ever going to
[2:02:23] get free if you're boxed up?
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; I'm like, why didn't you? He says, I
[2:02:27] don't know. I just couldn't. I said, you
[2:02:29] know, if you would have done it, that
[2:02:30] brother would have done it. That brother
[2:02:31] would have done it. That brother cuz
[2:02:32] they're all sitting there with the same
[2:02:34] problem.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on, church. You know, when
[2:02:39] David got to dancing and screaming and
[2:02:41] shouting and everybody else looked
[2:02:43] around, they looked down on him. No, no,
[2:02:45] no. David said, "Hey, you don't like
[2:02:46] this. Watch what happens tomorrow."
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; What? What was it? Was David being
[2:02:51] facitious? Was he being a showman? No.
[2:02:54] His heart was so full of God that he
[2:02:57] just had to express it somehow.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, you might not be the shout
[2:03:04] outer, but you might be like my daddy
[2:03:06] and this presence of God comes. He ain't
[2:03:08] going to shout on us. He's not going to
[2:03:09] stand on us. If he ever does, I'm going
[2:03:11] to I'm probably going to pass out. But
[2:03:14] he'll stand there and the tears of joy
[2:03:16] will just run down his I don't care if
[2:03:19] you shout. I don't care if you cry. I
[2:03:21] don't care if you wave your hands, if
[2:03:23] [screaming] you clap. I don't care. But
[2:03:25] do something.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Just do something.
[2:03:28] [cheering and applause]
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; If you can't, maybe you're not the
[2:03:32] worshipper in church, but go and take
[2:03:34] your worship to the street corners, to
[2:03:36] the to your job site, and tell him what
[2:03:38] God is doing in this hour.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Tell him what he's done in your life.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Spiritual sacrifice.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Ram says, "Now we
[2:03:50] might as well get started right here."
[2:03:52] He said, "It's a good place." He said,
[2:03:53] "A little confusion comes in the church.
[2:03:55] Don't just turn around and run to one
[2:03:57] side and pout." Now,
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; if you do, you're sure not a priest.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; You pray through.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Spiritual sacrifice.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, some of us have no trouble. I hope.
[2:04:10] My goodness, Lord God. Some of us have
[2:04:12] no trouble. you know, the offering plate
[2:04:13] comes around and we can put our offering
[2:04:15] in and we can pay our tithing and and we
[2:04:17] just feel just justified about that.
[2:04:19] I've done my duty. I'm a Christian now.
[2:04:20] But you realize that is the least
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; of God's concerns.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; There's millions of people that do that.
[2:04:27] But God's not looking for that. He wants
[2:04:30] you.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; You become the tabernacle of the living
[2:04:36] God.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; God is still manifested in flesh.
[2:04:40] The word has taken on flesh
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; and it's living. It's walking. It's
[2:04:45] talking. It's expressing itself.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Spiritual sacrifice. The fruits of our
[2:04:53] lips giving praise. You say, "Well, I
[2:04:55] just don't feel like going to church."
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; But
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; you're a priest.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you don't have that
[2:05:04] problem right here, right now on Sunday
[2:05:06] morning. But I wonder what Wednesday
[2:05:07] night looks like in this church. Amen.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; How? Brother, listen. Don't hand me the
[2:05:13] excuses. I've heard them all.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Wayne, I don't I don't I
[2:05:18] don't have time to go home and then
[2:05:20] change and then come back and I've been
[2:05:22] working in the dirt all day long. Come
[2:05:24] to church with your dirty boots on.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Who says we got to come to church in a
[2:05:29] suit and a tie?
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me that.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Give them your best." But
[2:05:34] if the best you got that day is your
[2:05:36] dirty boots and your dirty shoes.
[2:05:38] Listen, I used to work I used to live in
[2:05:41] a farming community. And I and we live I
[2:05:44] I worked with a bunch of mechanics, you
[2:05:46] know, in in the heat of the season. They
[2:05:47] didn't have time to go home and change.
[2:05:50] Those boys would come to work, grease up
[2:05:52] to here, they would wash off what they
[2:05:54] could, leave their boots at the door,
[2:05:56] roll their pants up, and walk in in
[2:05:58] their socks.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo!
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; God forbid we would ever come to church
[2:06:04] like that. Listen, they're there telling
[2:06:07] the enemy, "Listen, I am on the winning
[2:06:10] side. I am on the winning side. I don't
[2:06:15] care if my boots don't if I'm wearing my
[2:06:17] work boots. I don't care if my hair
[2:06:19] looks like this and that. I, you know, I
[2:06:21] pull my hat off and it's everywhere. It
[2:06:23] It just doesn't matter. We're here to
[2:06:25] worship.
[2:06:26] You think God cares about your nice suit
[2:06:28] that you brought to church and just paid
[2:06:30] $1,200 for?
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; No more than he cares about that young
[2:06:33] man's suit. No, let me rephrase this. My
[2:06:36] suit that my wife bought at a at a
[2:06:38] secondhand store for probably $50 and
[2:06:40] I've wore it for way too long. And he
[2:06:42] don't care.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; He just wants to hear you.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; He just wants you to love him.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; He just wants you to come as you are.
[2:06:53] Oh Lord,
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; it's time that we just let let God have
[2:06:57] his wonderful way.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well," he says, "but you're a
[2:07:03] priest. It's your duty. You've got to be
[2:07:05] there." Well, I just don't feel like
[2:07:07] taking part in the service. You're a
[2:07:11] priest.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; I'm a priest.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad you agree. Now, let's let's
[2:07:20] just let's just make this real this
[2:07:22] morning. I'm a
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; priest.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I heard one man say, "I'm
[2:07:29] try this again. I'm
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; a priest."
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, sister.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; She actually said, "I'm
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; a priest."
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; This is a reality. This is not about
[2:07:43] your neighbor.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; We come to church and we complain and we
[2:07:46] say, "Ah, you know what? H yeah, nobody
[2:07:48] wants to worship. Nobody. What about
[2:07:50] you?
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; What about you? Be the David.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "Listen, I don't feel like
[2:07:55] taking part in the service. You're a
[2:07:57] priest making a spiritual sacrifice.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; A spiritual
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; sacrifice."
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:08:05] Brother Barry, you're going to beat me
[2:08:06] to death when I leave here. [laughter]
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; But I'm not done yet. It just hit me.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; You're a priest making a spiritual
[2:08:15] sacrifice.
[2:08:18] You know, we got we got people that'll
[2:08:21] get up 5:00 in the morning.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; They'll sit for two and a half hours to
[2:08:28] get into their day,
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; then head off to work.
[2:08:32] They'll work hard all day, rush home six
[2:08:35] o'clock at night. I'm talking about a
[2:08:37] Wednesday
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; and sit down in church.
[2:08:48] Didn't I just read that you have
[2:08:49] dominion
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; over sin,
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; the world,
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; your flesh?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; How wonderome. You know what? We can
[2:08:58] schedule it. I got to schedule a meeting
[2:08:59] with brother Barry. If I want to see
[2:09:00] him, I got to schedule this brother. I
[2:09:02] got to schedule that thing. I got to We
[2:09:03] got scheduled daytime books full of
[2:09:05] schedules.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; But you can't schedule what? You can't
[2:09:09] schedule one hour to take a nap
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; so that this little body is recharged
[2:09:14] when it comes to church. It's ready to
[2:09:16] receive something of of eternal value.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you're you're you're on
[2:09:21] thin ice, Brother Dwayne. I know it. I
[2:09:23] know it. I remember you used to work
[2:09:26] night shift, come home at 7:00 Sunday
[2:09:30] morning after 12 hours of night shift,
[2:09:32] go to bed for an hour or an hour and 15
[2:09:35] minutes and get up, take my kids to
[2:09:38] church." You know what I knew? If I sat
[2:09:40] down in the chair,
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; guess what was going to happen? Cuz I'm
[2:09:43] just flesh and blood.
[2:09:45] So, you know what I'd do? I'd get up and
[2:09:47] I'd walk back and forth.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; I went out to the back and I would just
[2:09:51] stand there until I was tired. Then I
[2:09:53] start walking this way
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; just to let the enemy know
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; whose side I am on.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; We have dominion over
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; sin.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; The world.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; The flesh. Come on, church.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Dominion over sin.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; The world. the flesh
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; and the devil.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; I'm hurting, buddy.
[2:10:21] [applause]
[2:10:27] [applause]
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; All right, let me go back. Let me let me
[2:10:34] finish this this morning.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; I should call the musicians and that
[2:10:37] might that might help, but they say no.
[2:10:39] So, I don't I don't know.
[2:10:45] I want to
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; yeah. Thank you, brother. I don't know
[2:10:49] where it's at. So, so far we're doing
[2:10:51] good.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Scripture says this, "You're
[2:11:01] a chosen generation." Listen,
[2:11:06] there's no mystery that the the the
[2:11:09] show The Chosen
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; has come out, as good as it might be,
[2:11:13] and I I I haven't seen too much of it.
[2:11:15] I'm just being honest. Uh the the one or
[2:11:17] two that I did see were very good, and I
[2:11:19] wouldn't never take it away from anyway.
[2:11:21] But there's a reason that that even the
[2:11:23] title of that has become such a a great
[2:11:28] thing in this world because there is a
[2:11:30] reality
[2:11:32] that there is a chosen group of people.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; A royal priesthood,
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; a holy, did I just say royal
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; priesthood?
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; we're not peasants. We're not poppers.
[2:11:48] We're not slaves.
[2:11:50] We're free in Christ.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; We are children of the most high God.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; There's a reason Satan hates you.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Because he hated him.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 5 said, "Be followers of
[2:12:06] Christ as dear children and walk in the
[2:12:08] love of God as Christ has loved us and
[2:12:11] hath given himself for us an offering
[2:12:15] and a sacrifice to God for a sweet
[2:12:17] smelling savor. Hallelujah.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; I am going to try and close.
[2:12:31] We read the scriptures that Jesus was
[2:12:34] the prince
[2:12:36] of the kings of the earth.
[2:12:41] I got looking at
[2:12:45] you the reality of Mphibicheth and how
[2:12:47] that applies to our lives.
[2:12:50] And I also got looking at
[2:12:53] the great king of kings.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; The lord of lords.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; The high priest, the great high priest.
[2:13:00] I got looking at his life and and and I
[2:13:03] got thinking, you know,
[2:13:06] like we spoke earlier, kings in today's
[2:13:09] world, we've all seen little reflections
[2:13:13] of this on YouTube. You take a king in
[2:13:15] some of those foreign countries, the
[2:13:17] entourage that goes with them, the glory
[2:13:21] that surrounds them. They show you their
[2:13:23] palaces and their kingdoms and their
[2:13:25] cars and and as a natural person, you
[2:13:28] go, "Why can't I have that?"
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; You don't want it.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; You don't want it.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; You're right.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; What we want
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; is whatever he has
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; for me.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; The king of kings
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; left the glory which this world couldn't
[2:13:51] compare with. left the glory of heavens
[2:13:54] and when he stepped into the face of
[2:13:56] this earth,
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; how did he come?
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; How did he come?
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, his entourage didn't
[2:14:03] look very big.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Bible said, you know, the foxes have
[2:14:10] dens, the birds have nests, but I don't
[2:14:12] even have a place to lay my head.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Does that mean we should be the same?
[2:14:16] No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying look
[2:14:18] at the quality of his character.
[2:14:21] Look what he held as the uh uh as the
[2:14:25] most essential things
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; as things of real value.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; It just made me think, you know, he
[2:14:33] didn't come running he didn't come
[2:14:35] rolling into Jerusalem that day uh you
[2:14:38] know on uh a white charger or in what
[2:14:42] we'd say today, you know, stretched out
[2:14:44] what would you call it? What's
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; what?
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Limousine.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Limousine. Yeah. You know, he didn't
[2:14:50] come with, you know, the tinted windows
[2:14:52] and the armed guards and rolling into
[2:14:55] town. But the Bible says he came on the
[2:14:56] back of a donkey.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; He came on the back of a donkey.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Nothing. A little fool,
[2:15:07] didn't
[2:15:08] you know? And yet the crowds,
[2:15:11] the crowds looked at him
[2:15:14] and they screamed, "Hosana to the
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; highest."
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; They called him their king.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; They wanted him to be their king.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; They as far as they're concerned, he is
[2:15:27] the coming king.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; You know, he he he could have come in
[2:15:33] with banners flying. He could have come
[2:15:36] in with with with with, you know,
[2:15:37] everything blaring his name and here I
[2:15:39] am and I've come to save the world. He
[2:15:41] could have come like that.
[2:15:44] He could have come that way cuz he was
[2:15:46] the King of Kings.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; He was the Lord of Lords.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Every devil in hell was subject to him.
[2:15:55] And he knew it and they knew it.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; He could speak and things would happen.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; He was God.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; He was God.
[2:16:04] And yet that one being
[2:16:08] allowed himself, I'll just say it this
[2:16:10] way,
[2:16:11] allowed himself to go through to
[2:16:13] Gethsemane.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; And if you look at what that word means,
[2:16:17] it means the oil press.
[2:16:20] What happened in the garden of
[2:16:21] Gethsemane?
[2:16:24] It was there that he struggled with his
[2:16:27] will
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; and father's will.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; You say, well, he's how can that be,
[2:16:33] brother? cuz he was all man
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; but he was all God.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; sometimes we have to come to the
[2:16:40] Gethsemane in our own lives
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; where we struggle. We pray through
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; from Lord not my will
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; but thine be done.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Not my will but thine be done.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; So he understood who he was. He knew who
[2:16:56] he was.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't he wasn't ashamed. He knew
[2:17:00] who he was.
[2:17:02] He knew he could speak.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; 10 legions of angels had come.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; He knew it was that way.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; But he suffered
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; uh the most intense sufferings to become
[2:17:16] a priest that could understand my
[2:17:19] suffering.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; He went through the very things that you
[2:17:22] go through to understand your suffering.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm going to use this as a
[2:17:27] reflection. Sometimes you go through
[2:17:29] things and you think, "Oh, God, why?
[2:17:31] Why, Lord, did I have to go through
[2:17:32] this? But listen, you need to be.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; He's made us kings and priests.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; And how can we really understand unless
[2:17:41] we've been through it? How can we really
[2:17:43] enter into somebody's suffering unless
[2:17:45] we've been through that?
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; And some of you have went through things
[2:17:49] that are so hard and you think, "Oh,
[2:17:51] God, why does it have to be that way?"
[2:17:54] So that he can take you as a priest
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; and you can become that intercessor.
[2:18:01] Listen, I'm not talking between man and
[2:18:03] God. I'm just talking about standing
[2:18:04] there for your brother standing there
[2:18:06] with react. Listen, I don't know what
[2:18:08] it's like to lose somebody that's real
[2:18:09] personal close to me like like one of my
[2:18:11] siblings or something like but some of
[2:18:13] you do.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; And you can enter into the suffering of
[2:18:16] somebody that's going through that.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; You can.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; I know what it's like to lose almost
[2:18:22] everything. I know what it's like to
[2:18:23] have a body that's so broken that I
[2:18:25] don't know what to do with it. I can
[2:18:27] enter into those things, but I can't
[2:18:28] enter into this. But some of you can.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; God allows you to go through things as
[2:18:33] part of the molding process.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; So he can use it.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; So he can use the vessel.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; I just think this way we know
[2:18:45] here's the King of Kings and I want to I
[2:18:47] want to just close on this thought.
[2:18:50] Here's the King of Kings.
[2:18:54] I mean, every angelic
[2:18:57] host should have been standing with
[2:18:58] trumpets blowing.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; This is your hour of redemption.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; But nothing.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; Matters of fact then that are closest to
[2:19:07] him.
[2:19:10] I don't even know him.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; No part of him. Right.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; I say this is where
[2:19:18] here comes the the King of Kings.
[2:19:23] If I would title this something, I would
[2:19:24] I would title it the limping prince.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Remember, he was the prince of the kings
[2:19:32] of the earth.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; And here comes the walk of glory.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Here comes the walk of glory. Not while
[2:19:40] he was raising Lazarus.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Not while he was touching the woman with
[2:19:46] a blood issue.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Not while he was raising up uh Gyrus's
[2:19:50] daughter. This is how we would look at
[2:19:52] glory.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; But the real walk of glory was when the
[2:19:57] King of Kings,
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; beaten, bruised, broken,
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; and the sins of the world
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; laid on his shoulders.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Listen, no longer with his back, chest
[2:20:11] out as a if I could use that, I don't
[2:20:13] mean that in the wrong way. You
[2:20:14] understand? as a as a man, 30-year-old
[2:20:17] man in the prime of his life, walking
[2:20:19] this time broken.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; What was he doing?
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; He became a limping prince.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; He became a limping prince so that you
[2:20:33] could walk
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; a straight line.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; He became broken so that I could become
[2:20:39] whole. Amen.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; He was bruised so that I my life could
[2:20:43] be put together.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Listen, he was he was the limping
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; prince.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Wasn't a walk of shame. It was the walk
[2:20:53] of glory.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; It was the He carried my burden. He
[2:20:57] carried me on his shoulders.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; He carried my sin and nailed it to a
[2:21:02] cross. He annihilated my shame.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; He took it upon himself. Listen, when he
[2:21:08] stood there in in in Pilot's hall, he
[2:21:10] was rejected so I could be accepted.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; He has made [screaming] me
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; a king and a priest.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, he maybe didn't look
[2:21:23] like a king,
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; but he was a king.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; He maybe wasn't walking like a king, but
[2:21:28] he was a king.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Not a king. He was the king.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:37] Did God forget him?
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Not even close.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Not even close. When Pilate wanted to
[2:21:43] forget him, when the rest of the the
[2:21:45] soldiers wanted to forget him. When the
[2:21:47] Sanhedrin would like to have forgot him.
[2:21:49] When everybody would like to forgot him,
[2:21:50] but God didn't forget him.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Let me turn over to 2 Samuel. If the
[2:21:56] musicians would come, I'm closing right
[2:21:57] now. I promise you.
[2:22:01] 2 Samuel back to 2 Samuel chapter nine
[2:22:04] says and David
[2:22:07] this is now he's he's found Mphibicheth.
[2:22:10] Aren't you glad he found you?
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; And David said unto him, "Fear not. I
[2:22:18] will surely show thee kindness for
[2:22:20] Jonathan thy father's sake." Now listen
[2:22:23] to this. Now here's God's thoughts to
[2:22:24] you this morning, church. Here's God's
[2:22:27] thought to you this morning. Amen.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; Regardless of how broken you've been,
[2:22:31] regardless of what kind of a I want to
[2:22:34] say, you know, your walk might have been
[2:22:37] this way. It might have been that way.
[2:22:38] It might have been anything but what a
[2:22:39] Christian ought to be. But here's what
[2:22:42] God thinks of you this morning.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; Here's what God thinks of you this
[2:22:46] morning.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; David said unto him, "Fear not. I will
[2:22:51] surely show kindness for Jonathan thy
[2:22:53] father's sake, and I will restore
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; thee." Amen.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; All the land
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; of Saul thy father
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt eat bread at my table
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; continually.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; He bowed himself and said, "What is thy
[2:23:12] servant that thou should look upon such
[2:23:14] a dead dog as I?"
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Here's Mphibicheth.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Lord God, who am I?
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, what Lord? How whom who am I?
[2:23:25] What? What? What have I ever done to
[2:23:28] deserve to be in your presence?
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; How why would you even look on me?
[2:23:32] There's there's many people that are so
[2:23:34] much better. Why would you even look on
[2:23:36] me?
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; But I want you to see God's desire for
[2:23:41] you.
[2:23:42] Amen.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; And then the king called to Zeba the
[2:23:45] Saul's servant, and said unto him, I
[2:23:48] have given unto thy master's son, all
[2:23:51] that pertain unto Saul and to his house.
[2:23:55] Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy
[2:23:57] servants, they shall till the land for
[2:23:59] him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits,
[2:24:03] that thy master's son may have food to
[2:24:06] eat. But Mphibicheth
[2:24:14] But Mphibicheth,
[2:24:16] thy master's son, shall eat bread always
[2:24:21] at my table.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that I can pull up my
[2:24:27] chair.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Not at David's table, but at King of
[2:24:33] Kings,
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; the Lord of Lords. Amen.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt bring in the fruits, and
[2:24:39] thy master's son may have [music] food
[2:24:41] to eat. But Mphibicheth, thy master's
[2:24:44] son, shall eat bread always at my table.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Now Zeba had 15 sons and 20 servants.
[2:24:51] And then said Zeba unto the king,
[2:24:53] according to all that my lord, the king
[2:24:55] has commanded his servant, so shall thy
[2:24:58] servant do.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; As for Mphibicheth, said the king,
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; listen this. He's confirming. He's
[2:25:05] reconfirming this.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; I have a place
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; at the king's table.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; I have a place
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; at the king's table. Amen.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; As for Mash Mphibicheth,
[2:25:26] said the king, he shall eat at my table
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; as one
[2:25:32] of the king's sons.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; As one of the king's sons.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Saints, you've got a place
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; at the table of God this morning. Amen.
[2:25:49] Amen.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; We've been called to be the sons of God.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; And with that comes a special position,
[2:25:58] a special anointing.
[2:26:00] And God himself
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; has said that you are kings.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; That means that you will rule over
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; sin,
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; the world, [music]
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; the flesh,
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; and
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; can we say that again?
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; Sin.
[2:26:19] the world,
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; the flesh,
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; and the devil. Do you realize there's
[2:26:24] four in there?
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; What's the number man?
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Four.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; We're without excuse.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; You don't have to succumb
[2:26:38] to everything Satan throws your way.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; We've been made more than conquerors.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Christ this morning.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that this morning? We've
[2:26:50] been made more than conquerors.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning?
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet as brother Barry
[2:26:56] comes.
[2:26:58] We've been made [singing] more than
[2:27:01] coner,
[2:27:06] overcomers
[2:27:08] in this life.
[2:27:13] Oh, I've been [singing] made
[2:27:16] victorious
[2:27:21] [music] through the blood of Jesus.
[2:27:24] Let's sing it again.
[2:27:26] Hallelujah.
[2:27:28] Oh, I've been made more than a coner
[2:27:35] and overcomer [singing] in this life.
[2:27:42] [music]
[2:27:43] I've been made
[2:27:45] victorious [singing]
[2:27:47] [music]
[2:27:50] through the love of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:54] [singing]
[2:27:54] [music]
[2:28:07] [music]
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; for the [singing] glor
[2:28:19] through the [music] blood of [singing]
[2:28:20] Jesus Christ.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; Did you hear something about you today?
[2:28:34] [applause]
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:40] I know I heard from my theophony
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; and you know the one thing that really
[2:28:45] jumped out to me there's a few one thing
[2:28:48] that really jumped out to me as a son of
[2:28:51] God. I don't look like it. I don't feel
[2:28:54] [music] like it. But day by day I'm
[2:28:57] starting to act like it.
[2:29:00] There's identifiers
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; when we know we're sons and daughters of
[2:29:05] the king.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; But you know, I wrote something down in
[2:29:08] my notes about halfway through the
[2:29:10] service. And you know, we're not
[2:29:12] wrestling against flesh and blood. And
[2:29:14] he's given us authority, hasn't he?
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; He's given us authority.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; He's given us authority over sin,
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; over the world,
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; over this flesh, and over the devil.
[2:29:24] He's given us.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; But I I just had this thought come to
[2:29:28] me. He's given me full authority over
[2:29:32] me.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; And for us to say that we've got
[2:29:37] something in our lives that's greater
[2:29:40] than the authority that he has given us
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; is pretty near blasphemous.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; It just occurred to me today how
[2:29:49] powerful that is. He is the King of
[2:29:52] Kings. He is the Lord of Lords. And he
[2:29:55] has given us his authority
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; over all of it,
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; especially ourselves.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Let us not say there's something greater
[2:30:04] in us
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; than him.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; I just uh was also thinking right at the
[2:30:12] very beginning, the inspiration is
[2:30:14] beautiful.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; I used to be a contractor,
[2:30:18] now I'm not.
[2:30:20] But you know, one of the most
[2:30:21] frustrating things was actually peeling
[2:30:24] back the layers
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; so that you could actually do a good
[2:30:27] work.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; And you have to peel back the layers
[2:30:31] until you get there to the foundation to
[2:30:34] the beginning. And you know, one of the
[2:30:36] most frustrating parts as a contractor,
[2:30:38] I'll say this and I just can't help but
[2:30:41] think it's a lot like the box car story
[2:30:43] brother Brandham talks about. When you
[2:30:45] go through the entire process and you
[2:30:47] get all the layers peeled back and you
[2:30:48] think you have all the screws pulled out
[2:30:50] and everything is ready to go and you
[2:30:52] schedule the drywallers to come,
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; And they get set up and they go to put
[2:30:57] up a piece of board and they find out
[2:30:59] that someone didn't take out that corner
[2:31:01] of drywall with a screw in it.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Now they've got to stop everything and
[2:31:06] start over again with the cleanup
[2:31:08] process. Yeah.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; It just occurred to me it's a lot like
[2:31:12] the box car brother Brandham talked
[2:31:14] about. When the inspector comes by, he's
[2:31:16] going to take that box car and shake it
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; to see if it's been packed properly. And
[2:31:20] if it's not been packed properly, he's
[2:31:22] not going to put his seal on it.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; He's going to walk away. And we've
[2:31:26] talked about in the past, he does not
[2:31:28] pack box cars. The inspector doesn't
[2:31:30] pack them or unpack them. We do.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; We need to make sure that we've got it
[2:31:36] ready
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; when the drywaller comes. when the
[2:31:39] inspector comes that we're 100% ready.
[2:31:41] Don't leave any lingering screws and
[2:31:43] bits of drywall layers. Let's peel back
[2:31:46] the layers and just get honest
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; so that he can do the good work in our
[2:31:51] lives.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; Really enjoyed that this morning,
[2:31:53] Brother Dwayne. Thank you for yielding.
[2:31:55] God bless you, brother. [applause]
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:04] I also just wanted to take a moment and
[2:32:07] appreciate
[2:32:08] Sister Charmaine's sister.
[2:32:11] God bless you, sister. [applause]
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; Sister Alice,
[2:32:19] and I'm sorry I don't know your last
[2:32:21] name, but they're from Alaska. And she's
[2:32:24] here uh with her friend, Sister
[2:32:28] Fran
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; Francis.
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; Franis.
[2:32:33] Amen. I trust you feel right at home.
[2:32:34] God bless you. [applause]
[2:32:39] We certainly miss our sister Charmaine.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; There's a hole that will never be filled
[2:32:44] on this side of eternity.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; She's over there.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer.
[2:32:57] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we know
[2:32:58] we've heard from you today.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we just thank you for
[2:33:04] your goodness
[2:33:07] and your many tender mercies to each and
[2:33:09] every one of us in our lives.
[2:33:12] We thank you, Lord, for showing us that
[2:33:16] there's not one layer of this humanity
[2:33:19] that's worth anything.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; That every single layer has to be
[2:33:23] stripped off. And if we peel back a
[2:33:25] layer and we see that there's something
[2:33:27] else, we have to take the time and do
[2:33:29] the work to peel it back, too.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; And to just continue peeling back until
[2:33:34] we get right down to our very hearts
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; where you can actually do something with
[2:33:40] us, where we're actually honest with
[2:33:42] ourselves,
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Because until we get to that
[2:33:45] place of 100% honest
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; and genuine sincerity,
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; we're going to keep going around the
[2:33:52] circle and wondering why we have these
[2:33:54] problems. And Lord, help us not say that
[2:33:57] we have something in our lives greater
[2:33:59] than you that would hinder your power
[2:34:02] from delivering us from ourselves.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; We heard it this morning. You said it to
[2:34:07] us through your prophet. You have given
[2:34:09] us authority.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Let us stand upon that authority,
[2:34:12] Father. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; We know that in the Old Testament, it
[2:34:17] was not possible for someone to be a
[2:34:20] king or a [music] priest. They were one
[2:34:22] or the other. Now, it behooves us to be
[2:34:25] both because that's your word. And if we
[2:34:28] claim to be only one and not the other,
[2:34:30] then we're coming contrary to your word.
[2:34:33] Oh, Father, that will give us a hybrid
[2:34:35] religion that will not bring life. We
[2:34:38] just ask, Lord, that you would help us
[2:34:40] to peel back the layers. Help us to be
[2:34:42] honest with you, Father,
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; that you could do the good work in our
[2:34:46] lives.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; Bless Brother Dwayne, Lord, Sister
[2:34:49] Connie, and the congregation back at
[2:34:51] Saskatoon Tabernacle. We know the devil
[2:34:54] is going about as a roaring lion seeking
[2:34:57] whom he may devour. But we're so
[2:34:59] thankful that you told us in this age
[2:35:01] that he's a bluff because he can roar,
[2:35:04] but he has no bite. [music]
[2:35:07] So, Father, we pray that you would just
[2:35:09] restore our brother's strength, Lord.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Continue blessing the saints. Let him
[2:35:14] feed the sheep there.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, now we pray that you
[2:35:17] would just be glorified with a couple
[2:35:19] songs, Father, before we go our separate
[2:35:22] ways. And when we do finally part ways
[2:35:25] today, Father, we pray that you would
[2:35:26] just continue resounding in our ears
[2:35:30] that you have given us authority,
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; oh Father. And that authority isn't for
[2:35:35] another time or dimension. We're not
[2:35:38] going to change our characters. You're
[2:35:40] going to do that now.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; And we give you the preeminence and the
[2:35:44] liberty that you desire.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Keep your hand upon each one of us as we
[2:35:48] go our separate ways, Lord.
