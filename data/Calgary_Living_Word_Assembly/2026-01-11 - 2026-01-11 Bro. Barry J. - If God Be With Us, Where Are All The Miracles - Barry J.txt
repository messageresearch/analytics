Let me [singing] be a letter [music] written by your hand for the world to read [music] and see and feel. know you in [singing and music] [applause] Absolutely wonderful. What a what a Yeah, just I thought boy that could be a congregational song. The timing is a little difficult, but it just it it just won't leave me. Let my life be a picture. Wow. What a wonderful special. Thank you, my sister. God bless you. Stand with me as we ask our pastor to come. Wonderful. I've got a fellow I'm witnessing to right now just very carefully and he's uh owns owns has a partnership in a sound studio and I've invited some of the brothers to come and see it. But he's had quite a deliverance. He worked for me and and uh got delivered of alcohol supernaturally got delivered from from addictions. He he said he met Jesus. He he met him like a completely worldly man. Oh, so to my help he after he left me he met Jesus. So, I don't know what happened along the way, but uh thought that song, he's just a real musician. He really loves he's got a band, so he's an interesting man. But, uh that song, I think, would really speak to him. So, we'll see if we can use that somehow. Wonderful to be a Christian. Wonderful to be the life, be that light to the world. &gt;&gt; Many times we maybe don't think we're doing the job we ought to, but the Lord knows. And as Sister Amber's testimony the other night, just just your life, just your life is a light to the world. And we thank the Lord for that. Down from his glory. Let's sing just the chorus of that as our pastor comes. Sorry I did a little tight timing here, but [music] maybe we could sing the last verse first and then the chorus. without [singing] reluctance. Oh, flesh and blood is substance. [music] He took [singing] the form of man [music] and he revealed the hidden [music] lamb. [singing] Oh, glorious [music] mystery and sacrifice. [music and singing] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] [music] Oh, [music] [music] heat, [music and singing] heat. [music] is [singing] my savior [music] and all. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord once again. What an honor and a privilege it is to gather [music] together in his name. We have a few requests we'd like to bring before the throne today. &gt;&gt; Certainly thankful that we have a place that we can go to. Um, first off, Sister Anna had a note she wanted to write. Uh, she wrote, "Shalom, saints. I want to take [music] this opportunity to thank the church for welcoming me with open arms and love. The fellowship and warmth were heartwarming. By God's grace, my stay has come to an end. And I'll be leaving, God willing, tomorrow to Ontario. I enjoyed being amongst you. I'm thankful for this wonderful family of God. May the Lord, good Lord, bless you all richly. Sister Anna, I bless you, sister. It's been an honor to have you with us. Amen. We have a request um for sister Shantel who is at home sick today. I believe we have a request for brother Emanuel Lobe for those who were here at the prayer meeting. You know there was a [music] request from our brother for his mom and his dad and the Lord saw fit to take his mom home. We want to pray for comfort for brother Emanuel and the family. It can't be easy being in a different country um having to go through something like this. And we certainly pray the Lord will comfort our brother. And we also want to remember his father who has encountered a stroke as well before this happened. That was the other request that he had on Thursday evening at the prayer meeting. So we want to remember brother Emanuel and his family and everyone affected by it. We also want to pray for the Charac family. I think I said that correctly in South Africa. They lost everything they have in a fire on the farm where they live. That's from Sister Michelle. So we want to remember the Charack family as well. If you have a need this morning, by all [music] means defy gravity and just make it known unto him. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for this another opportunity, Lord, where we can gather together in your name. And Lord Jesus, know that, Father, we're not just gathering together under the banner of love that so many people will do. We gather under the banner of a just God. He's not a dirty old grandpa, but a God of judgment, a God of love, a God of care and concern. And Father, we're so thankful that we can know you in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Father, we can worship you in spirit and in truth. And that's why we've gathered here today, Father, so that we can push aside one more time all of the humanity that we have in our lives, this condition of living in a pest house, Lord. and Father, looking into your word to see the reflection of you once again. Heavenly Father, we're just so thankful and honored that we can bring our requests unto you, Lord. We know that you are more than able &gt;&gt; to meet the needs in [music] our lives. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just we just offer every single request that was made known unto you today by the way of an uplift hand unto you, Father. &gt;&gt; And we ask that you would meet the need sovereignly, Lord, that you would bless the individuals according to your will. And Father, we want to ask Lord also that you would be with Brother Emanuel, Lord, and Sister Michelle, Father, and Sister Karen, Lord, the Loe family here. We pray that you would just comfort them, Lord. That you would be their portion, Lord, in this time, &gt;&gt; this time of loss, this time of mourning. Father, we know that when you take someone home, there's no way that can ever be filled here on this side of [music] eternity. And father, we just ask that you would comfort them. Lord, you said that you would bind up the brokenhearted. Father, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we pray that you would just minister to the family, Lord. &gt;&gt; Grace and peace. Father, we pray for Brother Emanuel's dad, Lord, who suffered a stroke. Lord, it's not easy on this side, and we know that you know that, &gt;&gt; but we just want to commit our brother into your hands as well, Father, that you would help him in this time of need. Lord, it just has to be so difficult to have a stroke and then lose your wife. &gt;&gt; We pray for brother Emanuel that he would have words of wisdom. Lord Jesus, words of encouragement for his family. We pray that you would just bear him up on the wings of an eagle. Father, Lord Jesus, we pray for sister Chantel who was home today sick. Lord, thank you that you have already healed her &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. And Father, we just want to remember the the Charac family in South Africa. Lord, I can't imagine what it would be like to lose everything that you have for earthly possessions in a fire. Lord, can imagine they're probably searching their hearts, Lord, wondering what happened, why it happened, all kinds of questions. But Lord, we pray that you would just [music] bring a peace that passes all understanding to the family, Lord. And we know that Job, he had to go through a trial, Father, you that you saw fit for him. &gt;&gt; And Lord, your word says that when you were done trying Job, when all of that was over, that his friends and family came by and they they gave him an earring of gold and they offered unto him offerings, Lord. And we know that his end was greater than his beginning, Father. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just pray that same blessing for this family, Lord, that's going through a trial now. Father, we know that you're more than able. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to commit all these needs into your [music] hands now today. Father, as we turn to your word, we pray that you would be glorified in all that's said and done. Lord, one more time that you would speak to us, Father, lip to ear that, Lord, we would have hearts to receive that word &gt;&gt; when it comes forward, Lord Jesus. said, "Father, we'll be careful to give you the praise. We love you and we thank you. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Thank you musicians. [clears throat] If you have your Bibles, I would like to read a scripture today. Take a little bit of a break from questions and answers and read from the book of Judges. The book of Judges, chapter 6. Judges chapter 6. Judges chapter 6 verse 7. And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midionites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel. Isn't that wonderful how God answers? Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord sent them a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you from out of the house of bondage, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land. And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God. &gt;&gt; Fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell, but ye have not obeyed my voice. And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak, which was in Ofra, that pertained unto Joash the Abiserite. And his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Midianites. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him,"The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor." And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? And where be all his miracles, which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up out up from Egypt? But now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. This is such an interesting scripture because it goes from being the angel of the Lord here, right, who speaks to him. And the Lord looked upon him and said, "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midionites." &gt;&gt; Have not I sent thee? &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word. Thank you for the story of Gideon, the life of Gideon. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, that we can read this scripture &gt;&gt; by revelation, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not by revelation of a school, not by revelation of a tradition or of a church, &gt;&gt; but we can read this by revelation by your spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And father, we pray that you would just help us, Lord, as we peel back the layers of our lives, Lord Jesus, to just minister to our very souls one more time, Lord Jesus, by your grace, this word through revelation to our souls. &gt;&gt; And we'll be careful to give you praise. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be seated. Just a few announcements before we get going. I think it's really wonderful that we have brother Maxwell Bang Jr. coming here. We've talked actually about having him here for at least a couple years and uh the time is nigh. January 24th at 6 PM and the 25th at 10:00 a.m. He will be here and take two services for us. We got the 25th youth meeting. We've got the 30th youth service. We have a 31st ladies brunch happening. And uh yes, the sisters also get to go out and uh enjoy a meal in the hotel like the brothers did. So that should be wonderful. Nice to have a break from all the sisters have to do. Getting into February, it's tough to imagine we're actually talking about that even, &gt;&gt; but here we are almost mid January. Um February 5th, we're going to have a prayer meeting for those who want to come. Um February 6th, we'll have a gym night. February the 14th, we're going to have the men's breakfast. And uh February the 15th, we've got the youth group. And February the 16th, we have booked the uh indoor arena, the Centennial Arena in Okatokes for skating. So we certainly want to invite anyone who is interested in that to come have a wonderful time in the Lord. Are you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; Certainly thankful for this word and uh the scripture in Judges chapter 6. I I just love how the Lord deals with us and &gt;&gt; Amen. He's always leading us and it's just up to us to be willing to follow his leadership in our lives. And &gt;&gt; you know, I got a bunch of quotes that I'm going to bring today and we'll get into this. I I just think it's so good. But brother says in one of these quotes that, you know, when we have the leadership of the Lord, it's such a wonderful thing to have it. And he says you might have it. And uh I believe he's speaking to everyone. And it's not any individual, but he says, "You know, you might have it." Boy, I don't know what just happened. Something happened to the sound here. I uh Sorry, brother Bradom. He says that uh we might have something, but uh he said we won't know until the fruit of it actually comes to life. So, uh did I do something wrong there? Was that me? No. Okay, that was uh that was interesting. My voice got really loud, really boommy. Um, but I think it's wonderful. Brother Bam says, you can't tell what's in the seed when you plant it in the ground. &gt;&gt; You got to let it grow. &gt;&gt; You got to let the fruit of it bear what's inside of it. &gt;&gt; And you know, every seed will bring after what? Its own kind. And it cannot imitate other seeds. And all we've got to do is continue to water the lives that we have by the word of God. And as long as we do that, God will bring to pass whatever seed is inside of each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; It's such a wonderful promise. I I just love this scripture today. I felt led to get into this this scripture here directly and um we just trust the Lord will bless it today. talking about this story of the uh of the children of Israel in the book of Judges and dealing with all of these uh Midianites coming in and taking all of their food, their provisions. They work so hard to set aside the food for their families and and everyone, all their animals and and what happens is the enemies that are in the land would just march right on in and take everything for themselves. they would spare nothing for the people in the land of Israel. What a terrible thing that is. These were the ones who God did bring up out of bondage in Egypt. They were there according to the promise 400 years that they would live in bondage, but then they were delivered. They were brought up into this land. And and it's wonderful to look at this because the the children of Israel in verse 7 here it says, "And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midionites." Why were they crying unto the Lord because of the Midianites? They were in their promised land. They shouldn't have any issues. &gt;&gt; The book of Joshua said that no man should be able to stand before you all the days of your life. And he said that to Joshua, but he also Joshua brought that to the people. So here they are now in their promised positions and they're crying out to the Lord saying, "Why is this befallen us? Why do we have to have this problem? What's the situation here?" But if we go back to the beginning of chapter 6, let's just go to verse one. I love how the Lord does it in his word. He doesn't leave us wondering. He doesn't leave us hanging. He explains it very clearly over and over and over again, especially in the book of Judges. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Here they are in the promised land and and they had an address by the prophet in their day Joshua. They probably heard Moses saying, "Stay with the Lord. Follow his instruction. Don't go to the right hand or to the left. Follow the Lord." [clears throat] But what did they do? They did evil in the sight of the Lord. And the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Midian. Seven years. And the hand of the Midian prevailed against Israel. And because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made them dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds. They ran and hid in their promised land. Now, I'm going to do what I always do and jump to the punch line. And I wonder if sometimes as sons and daughters of the most high God living in our promised land with a baptism of the Holy Ghost, do we sometimes make provision for the devil and run and hide into a den and cave and say if God be with us, then where's all the miracles? &gt;&gt; Let's not make any room for the devil. Let's not give him any excuse. He's got no excuse. Amen. &gt;&gt; The promise for the devil in the day in which we live today is that he will be taken alive and thrown into the lake of fire where the beast and the false prophet are. That's the prophecy concerning him. &gt;&gt; Now, some might say, well, the the word also says, "Woe to you, O earth and sea, those people that that are living on the earth because the time is short. The devil, he's coming with a great wrath. If we're in God and God is in us, he can't touch us. Not unless he first allows for it. &gt;&gt; But the only time he's really going to allow for it is if we start doing evil in his sight. &gt;&gt; But it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites that the Lord sent a prophet. It's so beautiful in our lives. He he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, brothers and sisters. We say that all the time. But if if you see the inspiration that I got for this um if God before us then where is all the miracles 1961 brother Brandham preached this message. Uh if you listen to this message I highly recommend please listen to this message. Brother Brandham says it way better than brother Barry ever could. But I just wanted to try and bring us an an encouragement today because we've been talking about the the working of miracles on Wednesday for those people that don't come on Wednesdays. That's what we've been talking about is the the gifts, the fruit of the spirit in the church. And brother Brandham talks about how every single sovereign assembly, every assembly ought to see every one of those gifts manifesting in that church. The gifts are to profit every man with all. That's the word of God. And and the gifts that we see in the body are for the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have the gift of healing for brother Barry. I'm not saying I have that gift, by the way. But if I did, I I don't have it for me. It's for you. It's for the people that would need it. &gt;&gt; If somebody has the gift of wisdom, it doesn't give them the opportunity to be puffed up. &gt;&gt; It's for the body. &gt;&gt; If somebody has a gift of the spirit, it's for everyone else. &gt;&gt; The only interesting thing is the person who has that gift and allows the Lord to operate it perfectly because we can't operate it. But if we allow the Lord to operate it perfectly the way that he wants to, then it becomes a blessing to us as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if God be with us, then where is all the miracles? Brother Brandham preaches this message and it's out of verse 13. And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? And where be all the miracles which our fathers told us of?" &gt;&gt; And you know, in this message, Brother Bradom, he says it in a few different places. If God be God, then show the miracles. Let us see God be God. &gt;&gt; And I know I've heard it in the past where someone would say that, you know, God is God. We should never say that. But sometimes in our lives, I think it's important to say that because we need to know that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Not for everyone else. I don't want to look around and see that God is active in other people's lives and be wondering in my own life. I want to say, Lord, be active in my life. &gt;&gt; Let me be seeing you alive and well in here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not let it be just a Calgary living word experience. &gt;&gt; A church experience, brothers and sisters, will put us in the tribulation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we've just got a church experience, we've missed the boat. We've missed the point of the message of the hour. The message of the hour is to stand up and trim your lamp and make sure you've got enough oil in that lamp to be able to see the bridegroom because he's already come. &gt;&gt; Some people would say, "Well, we're still here, Brother Barry." Yeah, it's a word coming of the Lord. What happened on Sunset Mountain in 1963? &gt;&gt; That cloud wasn't just a cloud. A mystery cloud 26 miles high, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And what? 50 miles across. No, no, no, no, no. Brother Bradom says it in it is the rising of the sun. Take a look at it and look at it the right way. Turn it right. When you turn it right, you can see eyes and a nose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can see the face of someone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if God be with us, then where's all the miracles? &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not preaching to say we've got to see signs and wonders. The signs and wonders just follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The fruit of the spirit just happens. We can't manufacture fruit. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom, he said it. We read that quote, I think on Wednesday, maybe. Maybe maybe it was last week. I can't remember now. But he said, "You don't you don't pour the apples into the tree so that the apples can come out of the tree." No. No. That tree just drinks in the water and drinks in the sun, soaks in the sunlight, and we know that it photosynthesizes and and the life that's inside that tree, it actually causes the seed to come forward. But where does that seed come from? Right? &gt;&gt; It only comes from the fruit. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And you know what? We're talking about seed time today. We're not even talking about fruits. So where I believe we're going with this discussion about the fruit of the spirit, brothers and sisters, is so far beyond. We're not looking to see whether we we can see the fruit of the spirit and and my goodness, then we've got it. Sure enough, we do want to see the fruit of the spirit, but we're talking about seed time. This is the time where the life has gone from the seed all the way through all of the stages of the growth right back to the seed again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it that he can hear the sound of the combine coming by. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we need to get ready &gt;&gt; because one of these days we're not going to see the Lord coming. &gt;&gt; We're going to see the Lord going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think that's the greatest misconception the church has today is that we're going to see the coming of the Lord. He's already come &gt;&gt; according to the word for our day. According to the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; we have an open book. [screaming] Who could possibly bring this title deed of redemption down to earth &gt;&gt; but one person? &gt;&gt; How could we have that here? How could we have the fully revealed word? You know, some people might say, "Well, maybe it's not fully revealed." And maybe it's not for some. But we have a man that we know to be a prophet that said all seven seals were opened. &gt;&gt; And where did they come from? &gt;&gt; This is where I think it becomes really treacherous for people when they say, "Oh, how could that man who he makes himself somebody?" No, he doesn't. The word vindicated who he was. &gt;&gt; And we know that Jesus said, "Hey, you know what? If you can't believe me and the words that I say unto you, then just believe the works because nobody could do the things that I've done." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we know that all seven seals were open. And brother Brandham said, "You know, there was a time where I thought the seals they would have to come from without. They would they would come from heaven. Maybe they would come from some other source. They weren't yet revealed. But we know the Lord, the angel of the Lord, the Lord himself." He says it in this message, too, by the way, that the angel of the Lord is the Lord. We read that in the scripture. Some might want to contest that, but you know, we could talk about it for a long time. It's irrelevant. God spoke to Gideon in this message. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; But we know that William Brandom, he said that all those seals had to be contained in that book, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because we can't add to it or take from it because if we add to it, then we will actually have the plagues in that book added to us. And if we take away from that book, then we will have the blessings in that book taken away from us also. We know that's out of the book of Revelation. But today I want to talk about if God be with us then where's all these all the miracles 1961 1231E brother Bradam he talks about this in such a a magnificent way and uh I just I just like to follow the leadership of the Lord here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know reading our scripture we can go back to 13 of Judges chapter 6. Why did they find themselves in this situation? Because they stopped following the the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Brother Bradom says it in this message. They uh followed tradition. They followed creed. They followed uh seminary. They followed all kinds of different traditions. And and it's what got them here. But in verse 13, Gideon here talking to the angel of the Lord, the Lord himself. Then Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? And where be all the miracles which our fathers told us, saying, "Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? But now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midionites." Can you imagine saying that to the Lord? You have forsaken us. My And the Lord looked upon him and said, "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midionites. Have not I sent thee?" And he said unto him, "Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house." &gt;&gt; Isn't that just exactly the way God does it? &gt;&gt; The way he chooses people. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; He chooses the abase and he doesn't take the proud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know the proud ones, he just pushes aside. Right. &gt;&gt; The Lord said unto him, "Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midionites as one man." And he said unto him, "If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me." So beautiful, isn't it? &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, don't be afraid to ask him for a sign. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to ask him, "Show me that you're with me. Show me that you're God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're God, then be God to me. &gt;&gt; Make yourself so real to me. It doesn't matter what anybody else says. Doesn't matter what anybody else thinks because I know that you live &gt;&gt; when it gets to that level, brothers and sisters. It won't matter. It'll it'll change everything about us. &gt;&gt; Continue on here. Verse 18. Can you imagine here? You have an angel of the Lord talking to you, the Lord himself speaking to you and a a theophony body and a body that he created himself. And say to him, depart not hence I pray thee until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again. &gt;&gt; In this message, brother Brandham says, you know, that was probably about 3 hours. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Let's continue on. A and Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephath of flour and flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it. &gt;&gt; How long would it take to kill a kid? &gt;&gt; To get all that food ready, to cook it down, to bake the cakes, to get everything ready. How long would that take? My &gt;&gt; and and the angel of God said unto him, "Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth." And he did so. And the angel of the Lord put forth the end of his staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And there rose up a fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. What a tremendous picture that is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a tremendous introduction that is. And you know that's the beginning of the relationship that Gideon had with the God of his fathers. &gt;&gt; Isn't it? It's where God made himself so real to this man. And we know there's lots more to this story we're not going to get into. We're just only going to touch on this this very beginning part here. Verse 23. Oh, verse 22. And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord, Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord God, for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face." And the Lord said unto him, "Peace be unto thee, fear not. Thou shalt not die." I think this part's beautiful. Verse 24. Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom. Unto this day it is yet an O of the Aizites, Bizerites. I just think it's such a wonderful story to look at this and think how Gideon, this one that was caught in bondage, he wasn't the one necessarily that did the wrong. He was a righteous man. Brother Brandham says in this message and we know that his parents taught him right. Brother Brandham talks about that as well. He must have been taught correctly because he went immediately to scripture and said, you know, if God be with us, even though you say he is, if he is with us, then why are we under this bondage? Why do we actually not have the freedom in this promised land that we're supposed to have? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But Brandham says he was able to look back at scripture. He was able to put it on a scriptural basis which is so wonderful. Brother Brandham in in early in the message he says and how that they had done the Israelites the Philistines and the Midianites and the Amorites and all the different ones had come in like locusts and just eat up whatever they had and take it out and go on. And don't think for a second that they just came in and and discreetly took the food, whatever food they wanted. No doubt about it. They took whatever they wanted. &gt;&gt; And go on. He says, "But did you notice they could not do that until Israel first fell away from God?" &gt;&gt; First Israel had to fall away from God. They were in their promised land. And sometimes I think maybe we can be in our promised land too, but we just get a little distracted. And you know, falling away from God isn't necessarily leaving the church. &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily leaving your post of duty. &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily leaving your marriage, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily doing gross, terrible things. Right? &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's just a little distraction in life taking our our vision and our mind and our heart away from where we are at. &gt;&gt; You know the word says that where much is given much will be required &gt;&gt; in the day in which we live &gt;&gt; to know this word is an open book that we have more than ever any age has ever had. How much will be required for us in the day in which we live? &gt;&gt; I think it's absolutely tremendous. The devil can't set a foot on you to hurt you until first you get away from God. &gt;&gt; You must first remember that. &gt;&gt; Check when anything happens. See if you are in the faith or not. And you know, I'll say this, brothers and sisters. I think it's very important. It's vital. We can say that we have everything in order according to the message of the hour and still be wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. in our lives. &gt;&gt; We understand the message of the hour to the letter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never had error in our lives at all. But who is in our heart? &gt;&gt; Because this message of the hour is supposed to turn our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is exactly according to the book of Acts, &gt;&gt; which is the Lord Jesus Christ alive and well. Hebrews 13:8 in our lives. But brother Brandham says it that we can have the Holy Ghost every day of our lives and still go to hell. Every hour of our lives, he says, and still go to hell. It's not something that we can just get and then we're actually going to be uh completely able to do whatever we want. We still need to follow the leadership of the Lord in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's an everyday kind of thing, &gt;&gt; an every hour kind of thing, a surrender unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the devil can't set a foot on you to hurt you until you first get away from God. You must first remember that. Check when anything happens. See if you are in the faith or not. See that if you're right up to place with God. Then remember the devil can do no harm, do you no harm, you're in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we can take a look at the life of Job and say what what happened in his life. God and Satan, they had a little wager. They had a discussion. God even said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant? Have you considered Job?" And we know that Job, he got it bad. He got it real bad. But there's something interesting. I I believe it with all my heart that in Job's life, there was a fruit, but there was also a seed. &gt;&gt; Something inside of Job, &gt;&gt; he said, "You know what? Though he slay me, &gt;&gt; yet I will see him face to face." &gt;&gt; Something inside of him knew that God lived. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even when all of his friends, the believers, came and comforted him and reminded him that you're a secret sinner, Job, that you're you did something wrong, Job. The reason all of this is befallen you is because of what you did or you didn't do. &gt;&gt; And we know it took Eloh to come around and say, you know what, all of you just listen. Listen up. This is not the way that it is. It's not as you suppose. And he would know that he went and corrected all of them. But in the end, God came down and told all of his friends, "Hey, you know what? I will actually ask you, I'll tell you, go and get my servant Job to pray for you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's a righteous man. &gt;&gt; And all of them were saved because of this righteous man. But all of it happened to Job because God allowed it to. It wasn't something that he did. Right. &gt;&gt; So, I think it's real interesting because this quote, it just drives me to that. It makes me say, you know, Brother Brandham, he says, "When anything happens, see if you are in the faith of not." And I believe that's the way every single believer is. Whenever something happens in our life, let's see if we're in the faith or not. Let's see who is on the inside of us. Are we believing the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever? That he is just as able to do the miracles that he's always done, &gt;&gt; or not? &gt;&gt; Amen. or are we afraid? Do we have fear? Do we wonder? Do we worry? Or do we know who is actually in complete control all the time? Brother Rahim, he goes on to say, and and this place here a few years before this had been the prophetus Deborah and Bareric, and how that she had prophesied and told them what to do. And it was just exactly right, Bareric, the great warrior, and how they made a song of the triumph over the enemy. But as soon as they got out of the twist, right straight back into the rut, &gt;&gt; they went again. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Prophet for our day says, "If that isn't the picture of the church today, &gt;&gt; just as soon as it gets out of one twist, right into another one, it goes." But time had come for action. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; Time had come for action. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I think if there was ever a day, ever a time that's come for action, wouldn't it be today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To look around and see the handwriting that's on the wall, all you have to do is look at any any news feed and you can see that Russia's on the move. And we know Russia wasn't even Russia when the prophet in our day prophesied. It was the USSR, but he prophesied, "Watch Russia, the king of the north." &gt;&gt; And Russia now is moving all over the place in the world like never before. &gt;&gt; We don't have to look very far. We can see that this is this is a time of action. &gt;&gt; This is a time to not play church. This is a time to not say that because I associate I'm saved. If we do that, we're lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to tell you clearly, you're not going to be saved because you come in the doors of Calgary Living Word Assembly. You're only going to be saved because you believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again for your sins. &gt;&gt; But to receive that in the fullness of the word for today, &gt;&gt; that's next level. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's going to put you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the time had come for action in this story here. And we know that even God came around and told the children of Israel, "The time has come for action, &gt;&gt; right? We know that Gideon, the action that he could do was to try and do this privately, try and squirrel away just enough food for him and his family and him and his dad to scheme together to maybe hide it in a a den or a cave and a rock and just try and keep it on the lowown so that these enemies wouldn't come into the land and actually find theirs. They'd find everyone else's but maybe not their families. But God who is rich in mercy came and told them now is the time for action. &gt;&gt; You know when he does that many times we'll be like Moses, won't we? We'll say Lord I I I stutter. I I'm short. I'm not very smart. I don't have an education. I I don't think that I could do this. How could I ever do this? Here you have God Almighty saying you're going to do this. You're a mighty van man of valor. But if that isn't the picture of the church today, but I want to try and encourage us. You are a mighty man of valor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think brother Paul said it earlier and I think it's beautiful the quote in this message. If you want to see a miracle, it's time that you be one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we want to see a miracle, &gt;&gt; then we need to be one. &gt;&gt; Now, how could we ever do that? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon will say it in one of the quotes that we read later, but I'm just going to preach it because I feel so good about it. I love it when the Lord inspires us this way. But you know, brothers and sisters, if you want to be a miracle, what's the greatest miracle that a sinner could be turned into a saint? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it in this message. Take yourself and pour yourself out as an offering upon the altar and see if he won't come and touch it with his stick and consume it. And when he does that, the old man becomes consumed. And if you want to hear it, go and listen to this message. He talks about it. Well, I've got a temper like a bus. I've got such a bad temper. I just don't know what to do about it. Pour yourself out on the altar and see if he's not God. Say, God, if you're God, be God unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Show me that you're God. And I guarantee you, brothers and sisters, the moment that we get genuine, the moment that we get more sincere than we've ever been in our lives, that's the moment that he will come on the scene and pour himself out in our lives like we've never even imagined possible. &gt;&gt; He will do it &gt;&gt; because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Let's not make excuses for the devil and say, "Well, it's just how I am." As soon as we do that, we're actually, I think, diminishing our faith in God. We're saying that our problems are greater than our God is. &gt;&gt; Who wants to say that? &gt;&gt; Today, brothers and sisters, the time for action. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Time to say that God is greater than any &gt;&gt; any symptom that I can see. Any circumstance that I'll encounter, any devil, any Midianite, any Amorite, any one of these grasshoppers that would come around and try and eat my crop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is greater than anyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that's the same now. The time has come for action. And the time had come when playing church had come to a halt with God. I love how the prophet just he just brings it home. Let's just do this, right? There's no more playing church. We must get down to business. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I trust that same God will place this upon the heart of the people. He says, "Tonight, I say this morning that it's time for a halt in playing church, &gt;&gt; playing religious, &gt;&gt; playing righteous." &gt;&gt; Now it's time for action. &gt;&gt; And you know, it's said many times in this world that talk is cheap. &gt;&gt; We can say all we want, &gt;&gt; but our lives preach who we are. &gt;&gt; Our lives show who we are. You know, brothers and sisters, I saw a quote a little while ago and I thought it was real interesting. The word says, Brother Brandham says, not the word, the word of brother Brandham. We'll say it that way. He says, "When you're in bad company, when you're in bad company," you know who bad company is. You know it. We all know it. When you're in bad company, you're out of the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're out of the will of the Lord. Who here by the show of a hand wants to be out of the will of the Lord this morning? Nobody wants to be out of the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Nobody. We all want to be in the will of the Lord. There is a balance between hanging out with unbelievers and actually showing the light of Christ to the people who need to know it. There is a balance. And I strongly recommend let the Holy Ghost guide you in that direction. &gt;&gt; Because they'll take you down. The devil's job is to take you down. Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil's job is to erode your faith. &gt;&gt; You know, if we ever get caught up in looking at those websites now, people would say, "Brother Barry, oh, now you're getting crazy." I'm not talking about pornography. No, we could, but I'm not going to today. It's bad. There's nothing good about it. &gt;&gt; It's demonic, etc., etc. But I'll tell you, when we get into these other websites that want to try and erode our faith in the message of the hour, I would say it's equal to or worse then. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because it's a religious spirit operating it. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; And the worst spirit that could ever creep into the framework of the Christian church and cause it to become lukewarm, formal, and powerless &gt;&gt; is a religious spirit. The one that's absolutely religious, man. They've got it going on according to the word. It's terrible. &gt;&gt; But you know what those websites are designed to do? &gt;&gt; They're designed to take your faith. &gt;&gt; They're designed to get you to ask questions &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, what about that happened on on whatever day?" What was Was William Brham actually hunting out of season? &gt;&gt; Would the prophet of God go and actually hunt out of season? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; There's so many things. 16 men falling off the bridge and dying, all of these different things. Well, then they would say, "Well, where's the documentation? There has to be documentation." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Those websites are designed to steal your faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And alls it takes is a question. One question. &gt;&gt; Leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be like God's? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; thou shalt not surely die. &gt;&gt; Leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so subtle. It's all of the word of God, isn't it? It's It's so beautiful. It's perfectly packaged. It's reasonable. This word that we're talking about is unreasonable. &gt;&gt; This is supernatural. You can't explain it. &gt;&gt; How can you take a supernatural experience of that mighty angel descending out of heaven with an open book in his hand and putting one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and raising one hand to heaven and declaring there'll be time no more. and bring that to a natural circumstance and say, "Well, he was hunting out of season." &gt;&gt; How can you take those two and put them together? You can't do it. &gt;&gt; This is supernatural we're talking about. &gt;&gt; But the devil's going to say, "Well, nope. You should be able to rationalize the word of God. You should be able to understand." &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; You're not called to do that. We're not called to do that. We're only called to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we have the ability to believe it, it's a gift of God. I I would say that's one of the greatest miracles that we could ever witness is the ability to believe the word for our day. &gt;&gt; But, you know, I love how he says this. It's not it's time is up. It's it's time to halt of playing church, playing religious, playing righteous. &gt;&gt; And now it's time for action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, brother Bradom has asked a question and questions and answers. What will they preach after the rapture? &gt;&gt; You probably heard me say it many times. Once the church goes home, what will they preach? What that means is that there's going to be people here. &gt;&gt; They're still going to be having church. Brother Brandham says it. They're still going to be having altar calls and getting baptized thinking they're getting the Holy Ghost and not realizing the rapture is already gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here then. &gt;&gt; No, we don't want to be here then. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be here then. But we have the ability now the day in which we live to make it right so that we guarantee that we won't be there then. &gt;&gt; And it's a real simple formula. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about it in here. Just pour yourself out. Give yourself to the altar of God and ask him to consume you just like Gideon did that that offering unto the Lord. Pour yourself out. Put yourself on the on the altar and say, "Lord, be it unto me according to thy word. Touch me with your staff. Consume me with your fire. Burn that old man out. &gt;&gt; See if he won't do it. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many times in this message he says it. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever &gt;&gt; in this message. If God be with us, then where is all the miracles? You know, Brother Radam, he's he's talking about this how, you know, whatever whatever you'd tell them, preacher, you could tell them to go out and and and touch a a tree and they'd be healed. Brother Brandham, he says, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no." I think the preacher was trying to say that, you know, it's actually God that does the work and whatever you tell them, they would do, and they'd still receive their healing. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam, he says, "Faith is not that loose. It ain't that loose. &gt;&gt; Remember, we're not talking about natural faith. We're not talking about human faith. We're talking about God's own faith, &gt;&gt; the faith of God, not the faith in God. All of Christianity has faith in God, but is not willing to accept the word of a vindicated prophet and get back in line with the word. &gt;&gt; Faith is not that loose. It's got to be based upon some noted fact. And I I think it's beautiful. We all do. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but that's what caused us to be able to believe the message of the hour. The first and second pulls of this man's ministry &gt;&gt; or God's ministry through this man. &gt;&gt; Right? The first and second pulls. The bait on the hook is what Bosworth said. &gt;&gt; You don't show the fish the hook. You show him the bait. &gt;&gt; And when he's hungry, he's going to bite. &gt;&gt; And if you like fishing, you understand what that means. &gt;&gt; Faith is not that loose, though. It's got to be based upon some noted fact. And God isn't going to allow us to go forwards and not see something noted in our lives. &gt;&gt; This is what a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; If you haven't seen a miracle in your life, just ask him to see a miracle in your life. But if you have seen a miracle in your life, you understand exactly what I'm talking about here. It's got to be based upon some noted fact. You've got to know something about what you are having faith in. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Before you can have faith in it. And and I think it's so beautiful because for the young people, this applies to you in a really big way. Mom and dad can believe in the message of the hour. They can believe that God sent a prophet. They can raise us up to believe that. But there comes a point in time where it has to become my God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham calls it the point of accountability, doesn't it? There has to come a time where the children can see God in their very own lives. The same God their parents serve is now their God. &gt;&gt; It's based upon some noted fact. Something that's actually happened for me in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what anybody else says. They may never have witnessed it. They may never have seen it. They may never ever in their life, but I have. &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to talk us out of it then. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, first we must know how and what what God's desire is, what God's plan is, and how to approach God by that plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you so wonderful that every single one of those statements has been fulfilled through the life of William Brham, taking us right back to the center stage of the word of God for the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; But many people aren't interested in that. They'll say, "Oh, it's it's hogwash." All of the churches out there, they allow women preachers. There's nothing wrong with having a female preacher. &gt;&gt; Paul said not to do it. &gt;&gt; God said through Paul not to do it &gt;&gt; because the woman is of the man, not the man of the woman. &gt;&gt; She's supposed to be in subject to the man. She's supposed to be subject to the word. She's supposed to be silent &gt;&gt; in church. There's a lot that we could say there. I'm not going to go there. But you know, we first must know how and what what God's desire is, what God's plan is, and how to approach God by that plan. All we have to do is take the book and eat it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we do that, we can see what God's will is because God's will is his word. &gt;&gt; But unless we eat the book, how are we ever going to know what his will is? &gt;&gt; And many people are beguiled because of that. They don't take the time to read the word. They don't take the time to study the message of the hour. So when you get a man that will come and preach the gospel and say things that don't line up with the word of God, it can cause them to be led astray. And when we can walk up boldly to the throne of grace and plead what the plan is promised us, I believe it's there that God will come on the scene for us in our lives &gt;&gt; because he's looking for his word to be spoke back to him. &gt;&gt; We have a lot of ideas and things, but it doesn't matter what our thoughts are and what our opinions are. It only matters what his word says. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love how brother Brandham says this. You might have something. He says, "You you got something, but I wouldn't say just what you had till I seen what kind of fruit it growed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love how he says this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it takes a little bit of time for that to happen, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Many times people would say, "Well, you know, pastor, this happened and that happened and you should act on it." But I have to say, you know what? I'm I'm not going to jump. &gt;&gt; What I'm going to do is wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to see what the Lord has to say about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to see what fruit it's going to bear. &gt;&gt; If it's of the Lord, then he will bless it. And that's the way it is. That's why he is the way he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we we trust him and we love him with our lives because he looks after us that way. You know, brother Brandham goes on. Now, we find that when God's people gets in trouble, God always sends them a prophet. Isn't that magnificent? It's so beautiful. Many times people want to have a just a deliverance. Boy, I've got money problems. So, you know what would solve my problem is just to have a big uh uh forklift land on my driveway with a skid full of money shrink wrapped hund or or Benjamin Franklin stacks of Benjamin Franklin's just solve all my problems, right? To have that money. If I could just have money because I've got financial problems. Guess what? The the money isn't the financial problem. It's the behavior with the money &gt;&gt; that's the problem. &gt;&gt; Revelation is what it takes. It takes revelation to be able to fix things in our lives, to be able to deal with things as human beings. &gt;&gt; Now, we find that when God's people gets in trouble, God always sends them a prophet with the true word to bring them out. &gt;&gt; To have the word of a vindicated prophet in the day in which we live can never ever be overestimated. I think it's just so beautiful. It's never a time that God's people ever gets in trouble unless God sends them his word. And his word, as we had this morning, come in the prophets. &gt;&gt; And how you test it is to find out whether it's according to the word. &gt;&gt; If it's according to the word, &gt;&gt; then God's word becomes alive. &gt;&gt; And isn't that why we're all here today? So that we can see God's word become alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that we can actually see that this is not just an association. It's not just a charitable organization called Calgary Living Word. &gt;&gt; It's actually an assembling of literally the manifested living word for the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; That's why it's called Calvary Living Word. &gt;&gt; It's such a wonderful thing. But we all must speak the same thing. Once we get some saying one way and some saying another way, then we get confusion. People don't know what to do. Right? Brother Bam says we all must speak the same thing. Then we must speak not contrary but exactly to this word. &gt;&gt; That's how a true prophet is tested whether he has got the word. The Bible said, "If their testimony is not according to the law and the prophets, there's no light in them." That's right. It's got to be according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that's why William Brham is the prophet for the age is because he pointed back to the word. &gt;&gt; He never brought his own word. He pointed back to the word. And any one of the maybe doctrines that we might talk about and say that William Brham brought the people that know William Brandham would say it's one of the mysteries that was actually made known to this age. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Sir, is this the time of the end? Those messages talk about these mysteries. We're not going to talk about the mysteries today. But what I'm saying is this prophet took every one of those back to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And said, "Here it is right here. There it is right there. Every single one of them. He didn't bring anything new. If their testimony is not according to the law and the prophets, saying what the word said, saying what the prophets already said, then it's wrong, right? &gt;&gt; There's no light in them. He says that's right. It's got to be according to the word. And you know sometimes you hear in the day even today in which we live there's some folks they get their own revelation and you can't talk them out of it because you never talked them into it. Someone else did but you know what it's okay it has to be that way. It's the way it is. He goes on to say and God always in every case not in most cases sends the people a true servant a true prophet that will bring the word of God. And the word of God is what delivers the people always. Now, if we go back into our scripture here and look at this in verse 7 of Judges chapter 6, and it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites, because of their troubles and their and their trials and their tribulations, they start to cry out again. Many times, that's the life of a believer. We get ourselves off track and then we start to cry out to God. And I'm speaking from experience. I'm not speaking about anybody. I'm speaking about Brother Barry here. Sometimes I'll get off track and I'll start to cry out to God and what will he do? He'll take me right back to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Take me right back to the message of the hour. Isn't it wonderful how he does that? &gt;&gt; Amen. In verse 8, it says that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage. And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land. And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God. Fear not the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell, but she have not obeyed my voice. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Interesting because no doubt there was people in the land that said, "Well, your voice, who are you? We don't even know where you came from. We don't even know what your name is. We don't even know you. Who are you?" &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham, he talks about this. Who was that prophet? There's no identification for this prophet. He doesn't fit any of the names of the major prophets. He was a minor prophet. There's still minor prophets. That's a real thing. That's part of the church. But I think it's interesting because this man said, "You have not obeyed my voice." Now, many people will say, "Yeah, that's exactly right. And it never will obey your voice because you are a man." [laughter] But it's not the man's voice that we're listening to, is it? &gt;&gt; Amen. If anybody is looking to obey William Miam Brham, I want to say think again. &gt;&gt; Obey the word of the Lord through William Marryiam Brham. &gt;&gt; William Mryiam Brham was not the Lord. He was even asked that question. Are you the one? Are you Jesus Christ? He said, "No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; I'm your brother." &gt;&gt; Interesting. Interesting that a prophet I I just find this interesting as a pastor myself. I just this is for free from brother Barry from my heart my heart to yours. find it interesting how people they want that title pastor pastor pastor there's people that want the title whatever the title is teacher teacher teacher they want the titles why do they want them considering the prophet the major prophet that was in our day he said just call me brother &gt;&gt; goes on to say and there came out of nowhere don't even give his name I don't guess the prophet was interested in his name. &gt;&gt; He was interested in one thing. God had anointed him. He didn't make any difference whether he [laughter] whether he was classed one of their denominations or something else. Whe whether he was a bishop or an archbishop, the only thing that he was interested in was that message on his heart. Aren't you thankful that we had a prophet like that in the day in which we lived? &gt;&gt; That was the only thing he was interested in &gt;&gt; was the message that God gave him on his heart. &gt;&gt; Of course, he cared about other things. He cared about other people, but most of all, he cared about the word of God and making sure that he brought it according to what God revealed to him &gt;&gt; already in the word. &gt;&gt; He didn't bring a new word. But Adam Bam says, "The enemy speaks today. The enemy tries to say that the days of miracles is passed. And you know, as I study this, I think it's wonderful. I I just want to try and bring it to the the right here and now. So, we look at this and and recognize that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. But the devil will take us, one of the biggest tricks I find in my life is the devil will take me and say, "Well, look what you did yesterday. Look at this here. You did this and this and this." Don't expect a miracle. Don't don't think that God's going to do anything for you because of what you've done. Don't think that God's going to do anything for you because of what you've thought. Don't think that God's going to do anything for you because of what you haven't done or thought. &gt;&gt; That's all irrelevant. It's the devil. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Alls we've got to do is line up with his word, pour ourselves out genuinely on his altar, and allow him to do the work. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the enemy speaks today. The enemy tries to say that the days of miracles is passed. And and this is why I'm saying this, brothers and sisters. Some people would say, well, you know, in denominational ranks, the days of miracles has passed. But let's bring it down home. Let's say it right here and now in this assembly with people here. There's probably people here that maybe think the same way that I was thinking that, you know what I've done? There's no way that God's going to do a miracle for me. I'll say this. If you can get right with God, there's no way that God is not going to do a miracle for you because that's his will. That's his word. &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Spirit. And some people want to say, "Oh, brother, you just go on about the Holy Spirit." There's nothing more to talk about than the Holy Spirit. If we don't get the Holy Spirit, we're going into the tribulation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And maybe some of the elders are good. They've got the Holy Ghost or they don't got the Holy Ghost. They just don't want to hear about it anymore. That's okay. There's young people that need to be saved by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so they can go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Some people will say this is only a motion. It's only a a workup. &gt;&gt; So the enemy has challenged and his challenge must be met. &gt;&gt; I love this. Brother Brandham talking about it's a time for action. &gt;&gt; Let's see some action in our lives, brothers and sisters. Let's not do the the death marks. Let's not do what we did in 2025 where we just keep marching around the same way over and over again hoping for a different m different answer. Let's do something different. Sometimes you only need to do one little thing in your life, just a little bit different. &gt;&gt; And let the Holy Ghost tell you what that is. Don't let brother Barry tell you what that is. Don't let a deacon tell you what that is. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost tell you what that is. &gt;&gt; Because then it will be right. &gt;&gt; It's only an emotion. It's only a workup. Oh my. So many times I think that's the way it is when it comes to worship. Oh, it's just a workup. It's just an emotion. You know, Brother Bam says that where there's no emotion in your religion, that that means it's dead &gt;&gt; and you should take it out and bury it &gt;&gt; and you should get another one. &gt;&gt; We've got to have a motion. I I think it's so beautiful. I think it was last Sunday. Was it last Sunday? When was that? I don't know when it was. It was very recently. Maybe it was. Oh, it was New Year's Eve. Yeah, we had such a wonderful time, man. So good here. But you know, we ought to be just as exuberant in here as they are out there. Now, some people might have never gone to a hockey game. Maybe you should just look it up on YouTube, NHL hockey, and see the way the crowd reacts. Don't think for a second that the prophet of God didn't see that. Some people would say, "Well, that's a stretch, Brother Barry." Maybe it is. He was a prophet. He was storing up food for a season. Don't think that he didn't see an NFL game. Don't think that maybe he didn't see what the what the halftime show looked like &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; at the Super Bowl and how excited people got. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He looked at people in sports arenas and said, "We ought to be just as exuberant as they are." &gt;&gt; Yes. But many times we'll say it's just our &gt;&gt; culture. &gt;&gt; It's just the way we are. What culture do we have? &gt;&gt; I want to say to us, brothers and sisters, we ought to have his culture. &gt;&gt; No boundaries. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to be his culture. &gt;&gt; Some say it's only emotion. It's only a workup. So the enemy has challenged and his challenge must be met. And remember brothers and sisters, he's not going to send an army of angels to meet his challenge because the spirit of God says that when the sorry the word says that when the enemy comes in like a flood, right? &gt;&gt; The spirit of God raises up a standard against it. And we know that if there was ever a time where the enemy has come in like a flood in this age where the lid of hell was pulled off and what was it? A 100,000,000 demons have been released upon this earth. All of hell has been turned loose on this earth and all of hell has its sights trained on the bride of Jesus Christ. It's already dealing with the church and maybe messing with them. But as long as the church of the living God doesn't fully recognize what it is, the rapture is not going to go. But when it recognizes what it is, then the rapture is gone. Then it's going to go. &gt;&gt; Such a beautiful thing to realize it. The only way we can meet the challenge of the day, brothers and sisters, when denominations call people away and put them in this organization, that organization, let the women cut their hair and wear makeup and men all kinds of lives, live as trustees and deacons and pastors in the church because they got some PhD or LLD is the requirement. Jesus never did require a man to have that. Jesus requirement, oh, I love this, was wait in that city. Hey, &gt;&gt; wait in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high. And what was that? &gt;&gt; Go and wait until you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Then &gt;&gt; you could go and preach this gospel. &gt;&gt; Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yes. &gt;&gt; Then you're a witness of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's pretty powerful, brothers and sisters, right there. We can hover there for a second. There's many witnesses, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But here we have him saying, "Until you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you're not a witness of me." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say this is what the prophet meant. I'm going to say, "That's what he said." &gt;&gt; Once you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, then you're a witness of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That meets the enemy's challenge. We know the devil knows. He knows whether you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He knows whether you poured yourself out honestly and earnestly on the altar before God and said, "Consume me with your fire just like you did with Gideon's offering." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knows it and the devil knows it. &gt;&gt; And we know it, too. &gt;&gt; And as soon as we do it, he's not going to leave us or forsake us. He's going to come on the scene for us. Wait, wait in the city of Jerusalem till you're endure with power from on high and then you're a witness of me. That meets his challenge. That meets the challenge of the devil where he's going to come around and say, "You don't got it. Forget about miracles. You're not going to see miracles in your life. Why would you see miracles in your life? Don't you know what you've done? Don't you know what you've thought? Don't you know who I think you are?" &gt;&gt; He's going to say, "Don't you know who you are?" But if you know who you are, then you'll know that you can be singing that song. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not one of those skunks that the devil comes around and tries to lead around by by the nose with a ring in their nose like a bull who is who is just going to be led to the slaughter. No, I'm a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know who I am and what I'm raised up for. &gt;&gt; It's to meet his challenge. &gt;&gt; God's going to meet his challenge through human beings. We've heard it said before in the past that God's going to send a spanking to the devil &gt;&gt; and he's going to use his bride to do it. &gt;&gt; How's he going to do that? His temptation ain't going to work on her. &gt;&gt; It did for a time. I know we could all say this. Every one of us as believers of this message, you know, I know that I'm not who I want to be, but I can sure look back and say, "Thanks be to God. I'm not who I used to be. &gt;&gt; I am not that old man." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; He said that meets his challenge. That met the enemy's challenge. That met it in that day. It will meet it in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will meet it in this day. Pour yourself out and see if God won't accept you as an offering. But the only way it's going to be accepted, brothers and sisters, is to pour it all out. &gt;&gt; The trouble with us as human beings is we get pride in our lives and we say, "Well, I'll pour it out, but except for this part here. I'm going to save this part because that part is too personal or that part hurts too much or the other. There's always an excuse. I say get rid of the excuses. It's time for action today. Let's just pour ourselves all the way out and see if he won't come as a consuming fire and accept us the way that he's invited us. &gt;&gt; That met in that day, it will meet it in this day. Glory to God. I love that. That's a prophetic utterance from God. It met it in that day and it will meet it in this day. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we preach what the prophet said, &gt;&gt; exactly what he said. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "Now I want you to notice in 7 to 10 verse 7 to verse 10, we see the prophet coming. We see the people falling away." And from 7 to 10, we see the prophet coming and giving the people the remedy. &gt;&gt; God always uses a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God only sends his word to the prophet. God only comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Did John [clears throat] the Baptist go out looking for Jesus when Jesus the word being made flesh and dwelling among us? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Did John the Baptist go through the land searching out for the Messiah? No. He simply declared who he was. &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy to loose the latchets of his shoes, &gt;&gt; but his fan is in his hand. and he'll thoroughly purge the floor. &gt;&gt; And we know that word came and met him in the river. &gt;&gt; The word always comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that John said, "Oh man, I recognize who this is. I'm not worthy. I I need to be baptized by by you." And he said, "You know what? Let's let's not hold back, John. Let's let's fulfill all scripture. &gt;&gt; The sacrifice needs to be washed. go ahead and baptize me. And we know that. We know the story. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom, he says, "Now, I want you to notice in 7:10, we see the prophet coming. We see the people falling away. And and we see the prophet coming and giving the people the remedy." Notice we don't know where he came from. He never said there was a man, a Pharisee, who had been a priest for a while and never give his backgrounds. Them prophets, they raise up from nowhere. [laughter] That's so beautiful. I love that they do. They're not interested in an identity. They're not interested in a badge. They don't need a title. &gt;&gt; What we need to do is just know what we need for a badge or a title is Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The bride needs to take her husband's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, it's no accident that in this world that we live in, many times we see the the women being the stronger one and saying, "My husband's going to take my name." &gt;&gt; Or better yet, we're going to keep separate names. &gt;&gt; That's not the way it was supposed to be from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a perversion of the devil. That's what that is. And here comes that prophet out for that hour and gave them the word of the Lord. Remember, he never give them some man-made theology. He said, "I am the Lord that brought you out of Egypt." &gt;&gt; Remember, they actually had something to base it on. He was taking them back to a factual event where they could look back and say that God was truly God. With a mighty hand, he delivered us from the bondage that we were under. &gt;&gt; And we know that. But why has he forsaken us? The prophet said, "Get back in line. &gt;&gt; Get back in line with God. &gt;&gt; Tear down those altars. Cut down those groves. Get rid of all of those idols and follow the Lord." &gt;&gt; But he never gave them some man-made theology. He said, "I am the Lord that brought you out of Egypt." Showed my mighty hand, showed my power. I'd imagine Gideon was sitting right there listening at him, saying, "Wow, this is incredible. I am the God that did these things, and I've done all this for you, and yet you've not obeyed my commandments. In all this, you have not done it." &gt;&gt; Wow. So, where were those people? As I was studying this, I just help can't help but think about it. Where were those people at? What were they thinking? &gt;&gt; Where was their heart? I can see that Gideon's heart was stirred. &gt;&gt; His heart was stirred up because the very next scripture talks about the angel of the Lord coming to him. &gt;&gt; Gideon was sitting right there listening at him. &gt;&gt; Why? Now, I want you to notice another thing that might encourage you. And I just thought this was so rich and so good. That's why I wanted to get in here, brothers and sisters. this this one thing that might encourage you prophet of God for the day in which we live. It might encourage you. Immediately after that prophet's message, the Lord appeared on the scene. &gt;&gt; Immediately after that prophet's message, the Lord appeared on the scene. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's not be stuck following William Mary and Brham. &gt;&gt; Let's move on into Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because William Mary and Brham brought us a message to take us and put us right into Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we stay stuck with William Brham, we're actually going to miss what this message is all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know even today there's still people who follow John the Baptist teachings. &gt;&gt; There's still followers of John. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; There's been a couple more prophets, hasn't there? &gt;&gt; The word always comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; We've been given the ability to recognize, brothers and sisters, and I hope we recognize it. I hope we understand this is a time for action. This is a call to action. I want you to notice another thing that might encourage you. Immediately after that prophet's message, he's the same yesterday, today, forever. Immediately after this prophet's message, the Lord appeared on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we know most people are looking for the 60-foot Jesus, &gt;&gt; the cataclysmic ending of the world, the disappearance of all these people. That's what they're looking for. &gt;&gt; When we hear the word rapture without realizing that that word rapture is actually taking us to a higher place, &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; in our characters &gt;&gt; first. It's an open door in heaven &gt;&gt; to see that there's one God in three offices. [snorts] &gt;&gt; We know that John the Bapt John the Revelator was called a little higher. He saw a door open in heaven. And what did he see? His very first sight was one seated on the throne. &gt;&gt; Why didn't he see three? &gt;&gt; I want you to notice another thing that might encourage you. Immediately after that prophet's message, the Lord appeared on the scene. Amen. As soon as he gave his message, the Lord appeared under a tree. The Lord came after the message of the prophet sitting under a tree. The prophet gave the people. The prophet gave the people fell away, got off on their isms. God sent his prophet. Soon as the prophet got through with his message, the Lord followed the prophet's message for deliverance. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's a time to call for action, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; The prophet has come and delivered his message. &gt;&gt; Many times people will say, "Well, where's the Lord then?" I want to say, "Go look in the mirror." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Go look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where's the Lord today? Hey, if the Lord be with us, then where's all the miracles? Go look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; Are you a new creature in Christ Jesus? Go look in the mirror. Where is the Lord? &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, we're living in a grand time." Immediately when the prophet went off the scene, what happened? &gt;&gt; The Lord came on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that John the Baptist said, "Hey, oh my, if this is him, who I think it is, then I must decrease. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I must go off the scene so that he can come on the scene so that he can increase. &gt;&gt; Same thing that William Mary and Brandham said, ain't it? Isn't it what he said? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There won't be two of us standing here at the same time, sir. This is the time of the end. &gt;&gt; If if what's happening is what I think is happening, then I must decrease &gt;&gt; so that he must increase. &gt;&gt; But where is he going to increase? Brothers and sisters, the whole world is looking for a man, Jesus Christ, to be walking around on earth, the Messiah. And sure enough, one day he will be. But until that time, he's chosen a bride body. &gt;&gt; Hasn't he? &gt;&gt; Let's not take it and make it some sort of church thing where we say that it's the bride body is just a church group of people and and it's an exclusive elite group of people in the world today. Even though she is, but she's literally his hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Literally his feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Literally his eyes, ears, and nose. Literally his heart beating. Literally his blood flowing. Oh, I can say I'm so glad. I can say I'm one of them. Yes. Yes. I'm a child of the king. His royal blood flows through whose veins? &gt;&gt; My veins. Because he's made it so real to me. Doesn't matter what anybody else says. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're living in a grand time. Immediately when the prophet went off the scene, what happened? The Lord came on the scene. &gt;&gt; Doesn't say the Lord went off the scene. Doesn't say the Lord took his people and went off the scene. No, the Lord came on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the Lord be with us, then where's all the miracles? I can tell you I've seen some pretty amazing miracles and I know that you have too. You've seen you have witnessed some pretty amazing miracles that only God could do. &gt;&gt; Not man. No coincidence. &gt;&gt; Only God could do the miracles that we have seen with our eyes and witnessed with our lives. He says the Lord came on the scene. As soon as John went off the scene, the Lord came on the scene. Very strange how God works. I love the way he says this because it's in a mystery form. He doesn't say, "Now watch after I go off the scene." &gt;&gt; Does he? &gt;&gt; Never one time does he say, "Look to me. I'm God's prophet." He said, "You called me God's prophet." &gt;&gt; Sometimes he'll say, "Now, as God's prophet, do you believe?" But he never one time boasts that he's God's prophet. [cough and clears throat] &gt;&gt; As soon as John went off the scene, the Lord came on the scene. Very strange how God works, but he does it. He works in a mysterious way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Gideon asked that question. What a scriptural man that was. That's the kind of man that God comes to. Somebody who knows. Gideon said, "If God is with us, if you are the messenger, then where is the miracles that the prophet told us about?" He knowed everywhere God went, his miracles followed him. He knowed that wherever God would be, miracles would be there. &gt;&gt; I love how he says this. And how how can you expect God today to work in amongst people who doesn't even believe in miracles? How could it be? So, brothers and sisters, I know we believe that God does miracles, but what I think the Lord was trying to show me is that maybe we believe that God does miracles in other people because they're just a little better. &gt;&gt; They're just a little more saved. They they've they've maybe got a little more experience. You know, I had a brother one time, an elder brother. I was part of a a Zoom call. We would study on Fridays the word. heard in a younger minister. He said, "You know about something about the revelation that you would have to an elder minister, someone who was a hory head, been in the ministry for 40 years." And you know what that minister said? He said, "This the revelation that I get is exactly the same revelation as you get. &gt;&gt; It's just as valuable. Don't think that God gives me a greater revelation that he gives you." I thought that was the most profound thing that I'd heard in a long time. If we get revelation, it's a gift from God, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. And all that I want to do today is try and encourage us to recognize the devil's going to say that we have done something. We have thought something. All of these different things are going to get in the way of God being God. Nothing is going to get in the way from God being God. The only thing that we've got to do is submit ourselves therefore unto God and resist the devil and he will flee from us. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a good way to trust whether the messenger is right or not. If he has the form of godliness, he will deny that power to do those miracles. &gt;&gt; Someone that will say, "Wow, yeah, look at brother so and so. He's got the ability to do this." And he'll say, "Yeah, &gt;&gt; what brother Brandham is saying is that man will say, "Nope, it ain't me. &gt;&gt; It's 100% God. Don't you dare say that it's me because as soon as you do that, you make me antichrist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a good way to trust whether the messenger is right or not. If he has the form of godliness, he will deny that power to do those miracles. If he is a messenger from God, he will not only speak of it, but he'll have it &gt;&gt; to produce it and to show that God show that the God that he talks about is in him and with him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My I just love these quotes. I hope it's okay. I He goes on to say, he said, "If it was God with us, where is all his mighty miracles?" Listen how scriptural Gideon was. And otherwise, he said, "If we understand that God is a great God of mighty workings, he's a great God of miracles." Amen. &gt;&gt; And and if he is for us and if he is with us and he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, where can I see his miracles? &gt;&gt; Where can I see this God in action? Where is he at? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; If he is for us, &gt;&gt; the mighty man of valor could refer back to the old word &gt;&gt; and and know it's right because he knowed this that God is a supernatural being. And wherever a supernatural being is, he'll do supernatural signs because the supernatural is in him. You just can't get out of it. And how can you stand in the face of a wind without having wind blowing? &gt;&gt; How can you stand how can you get in water without being wet? &gt;&gt; Water is wet. That's the chemical of it. It's wet. And when you get in water, you're going to get wet, right? And when you get in the presence of God, the supernatural, there is going to be supernatural signs and a supernatural workings of a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; Therefore, he said, where is the working? Where is the miracles if God be with us? Glory. That's it. See, where God is, miracles are &gt;&gt; where God is, the sign of God is there. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'll call the musicians this morning. He says how scriptural that is. For where the supernatural is, God and his sign would be with him. &gt;&gt; Where God is, the sign of God is with God. We know that if he is in his people, they will do his signs &gt;&gt; just exactly. Brothers and sisters, maybe we've all seen his signs and we all have his signs and all the wonders are happening. Maybe for some of us they're not. I feel like for some of us maybe they're not. Sometimes the devil will come and try and confuse us and make us think or even believe that we're not worthy. We don't deserve. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil he's a liar. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil he's a liar and kick him out. &gt;&gt; And tell him, "Let every word of man be a lie, &gt;&gt; but God's word be true." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe stand with me as we close this morning. He said that could be easily said tonight amongst our churches. Where is that God that once lived? Did he die? Is he gone? Is he pursuing? Is he off on a trip? No, sir. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And if we say we are of God, then let's see where God is. &gt;&gt; Let's see the signs of God. If this tabernacle stands for God, let's see God move among us. &gt;&gt; Let's see souls being born in the kingdom. Let's see lives being straightened up. Let's see the sick and the blind and the deaf. Let's see his mighty works being performed. God in our midst. If God before us, where is his miracles at? He asked the question. Now, if God is with his people and in his people, that person cannot help but do the same thing that God did. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's not that person anymore. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying, brothers and sisters. The bride body of Christ, &gt;&gt; it's not that person anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't think that we just come to church and suddenly we're a different person and then we go home and we're a different person. No. The word of God says that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways. &gt;&gt; The word says, "Let this mind that was in who?" Christ be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Become a new creature in Christ Jesus. Pour yourself out on the altars, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; It's not the person anymore. It's God in the man. &gt;&gt; If the man sins, then God is not in there. If he loves the world, then God is not in there. And we know that God has no dealings with sin. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll give you a scripture for this in a moment. You can hear it when you go and listen to this message. I got so many more quotes. I'm not going to read all of them. I just want to say this. I'll I'll leave you with this, brothers and sisters. If you want if you want to see a miracle, take a look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And recognize that you yourself are a miracle. &gt;&gt; Once you have that revelation that you are a miracle, then you'll see miracles. &gt;&gt; When we can recognize it, we're not going to see miracles until we become a miracle. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul said that this morning. We're not going to be we're not going to see miracles in our life. If you want to see a miracle, be a miracle. &gt;&gt; Allow God to live out through you. &gt;&gt; God bless you today. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your word. Thank you for sending us a a prophet in the day in which we live. Lord, knowing where he came from and what his background is and all about it, Lord, his family and the legacy that lives on. Father, we're so thankful for all of that. But more than any of that, Lord, we're thankful that this word that the prophet brought gave us the ability to come to you, &gt;&gt; Father, to be able to strip ourselves of all of our carnality and all of our denominations and traditions and creeds and dogmas. And Lord Jesus, just come and stand face to face with you. Lord Jesus, we know that you said that there is a time where we will no longer look through a glass darkly, &gt;&gt; but face to face. &gt;&gt; And Father, if there's ever been a day, we can say it's this day. &gt;&gt; And we know it's because of your word. We thank you for your word. Thank you for sending your word to this age through the vindicated prophet, Lord. For first sending a prophet and vindicating his ministry, Lord, but then opening the word. Father, we receive it the way that you've given it and we accept it the way that we're supposed to, Lord. Now, Father, help us to call to action. Help us to get things straight in our own lives, Lord. That we could see you live out through us as we ripen in the sun until you take us all away. Father, we just ask that you would bless each one who's come out today. Father, we pray that you would be with those who didn't come today, wherever they are. Father, some might be traveling or sick. We pray that you would touch them in the name of Jesus. That you would keep your hand upon them. &gt;&gt; And Father, we thank you for the request today, Lord. That you've already met them. We pray that you would just keep your hand upon Sister Anna. She's truly been a blessing &gt;&gt; with her visit in the assembly here. Lord, &gt;&gt; until we meet again, we pray that you would receive all the glory. &gt;&gt; Just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing? He abides. 484.
