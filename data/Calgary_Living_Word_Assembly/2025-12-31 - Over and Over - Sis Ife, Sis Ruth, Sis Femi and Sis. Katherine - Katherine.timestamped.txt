[0:09] stood on [singing] the bank of a wide
[0:13] raging river,
[0:16] trusting that I [singing]
[0:18] get [music] across.
[0:22] I've made my way [singing] through some
[0:25] valleys and deserts, believing
[0:30] I'd never [singing]
[0:31] get lost. [music]
[0:34] I've been [singing] at the foot of what
[0:38] felt like mountains ever, knowing
[0:41] [singing] I have the strength for the
[0:44] climb.
[0:47] Cuz through every trial, it's test and
[0:52] temptation.
[0:54] One thing is sure, every [singing] time.
[1:00] Over and over again and again, [singing]
[1:05] God is faithful.
[1:08] [music]
[1:10] Over [singing]
[1:11] and over
[1:13] again and again through [music] it all
[1:18] made me able [singing]
[1:22] to stand and survive
[1:26] to come [singing] through life when it
[1:29] just like I [singing]
[1:32] couldn't win.
[1:35] Jesus [singing and music] is with me. So
[1:39] I claim the victory
[1:42] over and over [singing]
[1:45] again.
[1:46] [music]
[1:49] Me [singing]
[1:50] why I have no hesitation.
[1:54] God does [singing] what he says he will
[1:58] do.
[2:00] So I'd simply say every battle [singing]
[2:05] has stopped me. There's nothing he won't
[2:09] help [singing] me through.
[2:13] Why should [singing]
[2:14] I dwell on the hardships and struggles
[2:19] when I look just [singing] beyond them?
[2:22] I see.
[2:26] The way [singing] this will end is with
[2:29] great salation.
[2:32] Deep in my heart I [screaming]
[2:36] believe
[2:38] [music] over [singing] and over again
[2:42] and again. God is faithful. [music]
[2:48] Over [singing]
[2:48] and over again again and again. through
[2:53] it all. [music]
[2:56] Please [singing] make me able
[3:00] to stand [singing] and survive
[3:03] to come through life when it shs like
[3:07] [singing] I couldn't win.
[3:13] Jesus is with me. So I claim victory
[3:19] over and over [singing]
[3:22] again. Over
[3:25] [singing]
[3:26] and over again and again. God is
[3:31] faithful.
[3:33] Yes, [singing and music] he is. Over and
[3:36] over again [singing]
[3:38] and again through it [music] all.
[3:41] through it all. This [singing] may be
[3:44] able
[3:46] [music]
[3:47] [singing]
[3:50] to come through a
[3:53] surus [singing]
[3:59] [music]
[4:01] [singing] with me. I'm glad the victory.
[4:09] [singing]
[4:10] Over and over,
[4:14] over [singing]
[4:14] and over,
[4:17] over and over again. [singing]
[4:21] Over again.
