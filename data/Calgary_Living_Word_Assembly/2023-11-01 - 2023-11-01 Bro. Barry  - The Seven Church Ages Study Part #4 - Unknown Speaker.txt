back and think that we're so thankful that we took the opportunity that we had to gather together the way that you provided for us in the day in which we lived and Lord we know that could be this night and we're thankful father we don't count it as boring we don't count it as common Lord we count This truly as as an honor to present ourselves before you Lord knowing that there's nothing good in US father not in our flesh not in our spirit but Lord in that soul that you created in US father Lord that's what we present before you Lord that soul that matches up with the theophany bodies that you have already waiting for us Lord on that other side in eternity that's how we come before you Lord the way that you see us and father we know that you listen to hear our voice you don't look at us in our position here father tonight we just want to present these requests Lord as we have spoken already Lord the unspoken requests every uplift hand father made known unto you tonight we pray that you would just meet the need sovereignly Lord Jesus Lord we're so thankful that you have that ability to just make yourself known to the individual personally father and we know that's the new birth and we pray that you would just reveal yourself sovereignly to each one through the needs Lord tonight that are made known unto you father we pray for brother Jerry Carpenter Lord that he would believe your report father Lord Jesus that he would still be able to have the ability to hear the word in his day father we thank you for touching our brother Lord for his his willingness to stand father believing you in this age Lord we want to remember brother Pete Clawson who was in a bed tonight in a hospital father who had much rather be standing with his Believers the the brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and service tonight Lord but father we know that we get tired in this flesh Lord we get illnesses in this body and father we know that tonight our brother he needs a touch from you father Lord I know that it was said to me that that illness isn't budging but father tonight as Sons and Daughters of the most high God we want to unite our faith together and just rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ because we know there's illnesses that won't budge but Devils have to budge at the name of Jesus Christ father we thank you for our brother Pete and we thank you for his testimony of standing Lord for you on this side of Eternity and we pray that Lord Jesus we could stand with him on this side father that you would just Lord come by his way even now father Lord while he's maybe streaming the service from his bed Lord we pray that you would just touch our dear brother in the name of Jesus father that he would have that testimony that you are his god father we love you and we thank you tonight we just pray for the service here that Lord Jesus we would all get out of the way and just allow you to have the preeminence tonight that you would speak to us Lord father through the few words that are spoken the little time that we have Lord we pray that you would just have your will and your way in our midst tonight we just Commit This service now into your hands father completely and wholly in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen God bless you tonight welcome to the house of the Lord you have your Bibles tonight thank you musicians I just like to read from the book of Revelations once again certainly thankful to be here gathered together as we've said already we don't know how many more times we'll be able to do this and uh could be a an illness it could be a shutdown could be something that would prevent us naturally from gathering together this way could be the the general resurrection and Rapture of the church right we know that anything is possible in the day in which we live Revelations chapter 1 verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and he signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we know the time is at hand father tonight we pray that we could just Lord hear from you that's our desire we have not gathered to hear from a man but we have gathered to hear from you each one of us Lord and we pray that Lord just as faithful as you have been over the past few Services father that you would just Lord come and have your way once again father that you would just speak to us once again we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray pray amen amen bless you tonight you may be seated just like to welcome brother Jeff pagee with us tonight he called me this afternoon and we got acquainted actually years ago in Edmonton I believe at uh Edmonton winter Youth Camp and uh I trust you'll have the opportunity to make his acquaintance he uh he's a desire to serve the Lord and he lives in Calgary and uh we know that he is on a journey just like every one of us you can just remember Jeff page in your prayers just want to remind everyone that uh we have a time change happening this Sunday Saturday actually Saturday morning Saturday Sunday morning Saturday night when you go to bed set your clock's back an hour our phones tend to do it automatically and that's real convenient uh we have a communion service on November the 12th at 6 PM Sunday November the 12th and uh we heard yesterday that it sounds like brother Timothy ashong will come and visit us as well and I think that he'll be here December the 6 if that works out we're planning for that so just a few things to keep in mind we had a wonderful time last night gathering together and The Little Gym that we had here in in McKenzie Town and just a wonderful opportunity to get together and I'm sure that everybody saw the videos and everybody had fun it was just such a good time just to blow off a little bit of and just have some fun certainly thankful for the the word tonight and I know that whenever I get nervous like I feel right now that something's going to happen so if you go to Poland we'll just go to preaching and we'll see what the Lord will do certainly thankful to have the Livy family here together once again that the Lord would raise up brother Aiden the devil would come around and try and make him feel not well so not well that he can't come and fellowship ship in church but here he is God bless you brother Aiden it's a wonderful thing to have the have the life behind the name isn't it because that's the only thing that makes the demons tremble we can say Jesus Christ all we want but if the devil knows where we stand and we don't stand behind the word the devil's got every right to stand in our way and to throw as many traps and banana peels as he can and and we don't have any help but boy oh boy when we can actually get his life living out through us then you know what happens is we stop looking at the problems we stop looking at the problems in ourselves and we stop looking at the problems in other people and what we do is we start to focus on the word and the more that we focus on the word the less the problems seem to be the problems don't disappear we have as just as many problems it's just like as a believer of this word we do as many things that we want to do as any as often as we want to do it like brother bradam said you know I have I smoke as much as I want to I drink as much as I want to but as a Believer you don't want to do either one you don't want to smoke and you don't want to drink they're both outward expressions of the inward things that are going on in our lives and you know sometimes we can come to a place in our lives where we just want to skirt The Edge we want to go right to the very edge of the promised land we've said it this way before Remember When the Children of Israel were in their Promised Land they had a blessing that they couldn't be touched but if they got too close to the edge the enemies have Spears and arrows maybe they could stick them with a spear and get wounded don't go close to the edge we told the story a little while ago brother bradam was talking about a man who who said that he could drive his car right to the very edge of the road on the mountain and and there's a great Cliff there but he could ride it no problem along the edge why would you want to do that what if it gave way there would be nothing to save you you would just tumble down down the hill don't go to the edge drive right as close to the inside of the road as you can brothers and sisters don't don't worry about trying to do things that the world does this world's going to burn as Believers we don't want to get as close as we can to this world and you know we talked about it we'll probably continue to hammer on it there's gates of hell that are swinging and flapping in the breeze trying to get our attention the Gates of Hell will prevail if we don't stay behind the word but boy oh boy if we can actually identify those Gates of Hell what's a Gate of Hell you can do the research in your own life ask what we do in our lives bring it before the Lord in prayer and say Lord is this a Gate of Hell see what he tells us ask him and see if he won't tell us directly and he will he'll say yeah that is a Gate of Hell I don't want you to do that stay away from that put it down he'll tell us very clearly I know sorry sometimes I get a little excited but it's it's what it is brothers and sisters we're we're at a time where where nations are breaking and Israel's Awakening Hallelujah I heard something today and I don't even know if it's true and maybe I shouldn't say it but just just maybe for shock value for anyone that could be listening tonight I I heard it said that China is erasing Israel off of their Maps Israel isn't going to exist according to China so imagine all of those who in conglomeration in Alliance with China what they're talking about behind the scenes we know in the Book of Revelation it says that the whole world will gather around Israel around the camp of the Saints and you know many times we would say wow there's a whole bunch of different things that have to happen before that you know the Book of Revelation is not in chronological order we cannot say that the Book of Revelation chapter 1 has to happen chapter 2 has to happen 3 4 5 6 7 all the the way up to chapter 22 and when we see chapter 21 coming to pass then we know we need to get ready because it's the sign of the end brothers and sisters we can see things happening from Revelations chapter 20 right now today amen it's the way God does it don't don't look for signs and and wonders to draw us back because we're going to miss it when that time comes we need to know exactly where we stand today you know when the death angel was passing through the land of of of Egypt they were told to apply the token and how are they told to apply the token it was through the voice of a Vindicated Prophet Hallelujah take that voice don't take anyone else's opinion and apply that token put it on your home make sure that your children know where you stand make sure they know they're safe yes being a legalist ain't going to save you getting the token will dos and don'ts will put you in the grave yes but the life behind the name that will get you out of it you know talking about the exposition of the seven Church ages for those people who aren't aware of where we're at um we're studying this book and we're going to go right into detail with it we're just taking our time uh this is uh I think the fourth fourth service on this and uh just a little recap you know we read the the introduction and got into it this is a book that that William brandham the the prophet for our age he he put this together he penned it we read the introduction and then we read you know the beginning part of revelation of Jesus Christ and and it's based on the the the Book of Revelation chapter 1 chapter 2 and chapter 3 it's it's the church ages the message of God through John the Revelator um John the Divine St John the Divine to the churches um he was uh put out by the churches they did not like him at all because he was a follower of Jesus and he was put on the aisle of patmas for his testimony of Jesus Christ and we know that the believer in in today's world will be persecuted for the testimony of Jesus Christ we're not going to be liked and and that's just the way it is and you know we uh read it on Sunday or or I I talked about it the the story of the Great American evangelist he he thought that he was doomed for judgment when he got before before that throne in his dream he went before the white Throne of judgment and he thought he was a good person till he got in that presence he said and he recognized even as an evangelist of the word of God that he was no good there was nothing good inside of him but there was a voice behind him that said I'll stand for him because he stood for me we need to make sure that we know where we stand brothers and sisters and it's not just behind a bunch of books and tapes and it's not behind an association that says my mom and my dad they went to message churches my whole life and and I live a good life and and I follow everything diligently that's not going to do it the only thing that's going to do it is the Holy Ghost token in your life in our lives that's the only thing that we can do but that only comes by the message of the hour in our day there's a lot of people claiming the Holy Ghost and the token but they're not willing to take all of the word that's what the prophet for our day said and that's totally what captivated me and I know it's what captivated you is when you heard him say if you can't take my word for it take the word of God right amen but we know the liberal theologians of our day they want to say well that was for a different Age and and that was for a different culture when you start talking about cutting women's hair and women wearing a garment that pertains to a man and you know we we've talked about it before but now that we're there I'm just going to say it again you know as as Believers of this word there's people that will say the word homosexuality is a is a very bad thing and and we would never condone that as Believers and and that would be the millions and billions of Christians that are out there and I know there's a whole bunch that say it's okay but we know those people who truly believe the word of God the word of God says that it's wrong for a man to lie with a man or a woman to lie with a woman that's wrong that's not right and we know that's what it is but that same word that says that it's an Abomination for that to happen the exact same word out of the strongs Strong's concordant says that it's an Abomination for a woman to wear a garment that pertains to a man that's right so how can a woman wear a pair of pants in a Christian Church that believes that homosexuality is wrong and think that it's okay how does that work how can you take the word of God and bend it to fit what you want it doesn't work that way and that's what the problem is today in the world and it was even in jesus' day you cannot take and and and and and manipulate the word of God to suit your needs and think that you're going to see the power of God manifest the way that you want it to the only way we're going to see it manifest the way we want it to and ultimately change our bodies is to take all the word and eat the book John was instructed to take the book and eat it up and it'll be sweet as honey in your mouth oh my when we talk about the word of God in church it's so beautiful and so sweet as honey but boy it makes our bellies bitter when it comes time to actually walk the walk instead of just talking the talk it becomes very difficult to do but you know brothers and sisters the more that we do walk the walk and not talk the more that we do actually just take this word and live it out Satan will begin to tremble he'll see that we are not just actors we are truly Sons and Daughters of God we're the manifestation of the attributes of the Lord Jesus Christ that he intended for this age from before the foundation of the world there's a whole bunch of people throughout all the ages where Satan wonders I wonder about that person why could that person that person went right to the Grave they're just a weirdo wonders why they would never change they would never Bend because they were a manifested attribute for that age and brothers and sisters we're no different today we are living Witnesses of the word of God for our day the manifestation of the attributes of God Almighty here on Earth my goodness you know just a little recap there's an amazing secret power available to the church if we can recognize the Antichrist spirit that crept into the framework of the church making it lukewarm formal and Powerless kind of like what we're talking about already talk in the talk but not walk in the walk if we can actually recognize that and I want to say this brothers and sisters I've always kind of thought that you know we got to look at brothers and we got to look at sisters and see if we can identify that that Antichrist spirit that makes the church lukewarm formal and Powerless can we look at another church somewhere maybe in Edmonton or or or somewhere else Vancouver or or or or anywhere else in the world can we start to identify this don't do that look at that Antichrist spirit that would try and enter this church right here and make it lukewarm formal and Powerless make it an inward search because if we can do that brothers and sisters then we're going to see the power of God manifest in our lives not because we want to see signs and wonders because we want to know that he's alive and well in here because Satan wants to come around and try and make us lukewarm formal and powerless try and make us cold and starchy and just say I've got it there's nothing more that I can do no no no no no not as Believers as Believers we want to shout we want to sing We want to dance we want to express the life that's inside of us to this world around us am you know brother Bram he says it in this book that we can never overemphasize the importance of Revelation to who to a True Believer when you have a True Believer someone that really believes this word really earnestly contends for the faith there's something inside of us that we can never ever ever ever overestimate the the or overemphasize the importance of Revelation because what is revelation Revelation is God speaking to us individually you don't need a Vicor of Christ to come and be the mediator in between you and God as soon as that happens brothers and sisters it's Catholic it's Universal it becomes denominational it's evil it's not the right thing the whole entire thing is about the Sons and Daughters of God having a relationship directly with God himself there is no other Prophet for this age there was only one prophet he came he executed his office he did his Priestly duties and God took him home now what does that mean to us do we look for another or do we actually know who he introduced do we recognize the introduction of the Lord Jesus Christ to the bride today we can never overemphasize the importance of Revelation so brothers and sisters I would say truly get Revelation more than anything get Revelation because when we get revelation God will speak to us directly that's how he speaks to us I don't know how many people have said it I know I've heard it said that there was a great teacher one time that said man can never hear the voice of God I don't know I would say God is God God can do whatever God wants to do if God wants us to hear an audible voice he'll do it that's right and and he could use a mule to do it through right it's God but I want to say this more often than not he's going to speak to our hearts it's going to be an inward voice and it's just going to be a little thought that happens right in there just just it just happens and it'll be anytime anywhere the least the times that we least expect it he'll speak to us brothers and sisters that is true Revelation and when that happens that's something that nobody body can ever take away from you we hear it said many times on this side of Eternity that it's important for us to get an education because when we have that status that that that that badge or that that plaque or or whatever that endorsement is nobody can ever take it away from us we can take the piece of paper and burn it and disappear but we would still know what it means to have a a finance degree or we would know what it means to be an engineer we would have all of that learning inside of us and nobody could ever take it away how much more as a son and daughter of God eat the book brothers and sisters get the Revelation by the spirit for the words in the book and nobody can ever take it away from us why could they never take it away from us because no human being ever gave it to us we talked about Simon bar Jonah having a name change and how Jesus said to him Simon bar Jonah Flesh and Blood hath not revealed that to you but my Father which is in heaven he hath revealed that unto you it's no different for the Bride of Jesus Christ today we have got to get that same Revelation today and when we do it will change our bodies and you know you want to see if you're to actually go in the in the Rapture I'll say it this way we will see a change in our bodies the smoking will disappear the drinking will disappear the pornography will disappear all of our bad habits will disappear all of the the old nature will begin to disappear we'll become a new creature in Christ Jesus that body change starts right here this flesh will never ever inherit the Kingdom of Heaven don't think it will because even though we're delivered of all of those things we just talked about and more all the other things that can happen in this life when we actually are delivered of those things Satan comes back around and says but didn't you like this before and oh what about that don't you remember you used to have a bad temper you used to do this you used to look at that you used to say the other didn't you enjoy that music oh that music oh that music I'm talking from experience brothers and sisters that music it's just got that beat and it just does something it just oh my that's the devil we just got to remind them get lost you're an offense to me because it's not me it's the Lord Jesus Christ in me amen you've got no place here devil your place is under my feet until the day you get thrown into the Lake of Fire and that day is coming amen but it's only through Revelation that his by his spirit that we can understand this scripture and some might say well it's only this book He's only talking about this book I'll say that he's talking about all scripture we're only going to understand the book this book by Revelation that's the only way we're going to be able to read it properly we're going to be able to see it and understand it so you know what get the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters you'll live the life of Christ you'll have his nature and don't look at your problems don't look at the problems I'll say the problems forgive me I said your problems they're not your problems they're the devil's problems amen don't look at the problems make them his problems don't look at them just look at the promise keep your eyes on the promise so long as we can keep our our eyes on the promise we will see the word come to manifest in our lives but how are we going to do that just just simple Keys brothers and sisters and I know we all know it but I just we need to say it maybe maybe for someone I don't know this is stuff that I was thinking about today and yesterday and the day before the only way we're going to have overcoming power in our lives is to feed the spirit of God he is a living being he's a living life how many of us will just allow ourselves to starve a and not eat and then when we do eat we'll just go and open up a garbage can I remember hearing this preach to me years ago we'll just go and say you know I'm so hungry I'm going to break my fast and I'm just going to go and find the stinkiest garbage can that I can find and I'm going to open it up and I'm just going to go through it and just start eating the garbage that smelly steamy hot trash I'm GNA just start feeding upon that while I'm super hungry who would do that but brother grantom says we'll take and we'll poke anything down and he's talking specifically about the religious stuff we got to be careful with the religious stuff but brothers and sisters don't go and and get into trash if we get into trash then what we're going to do is just put ourselves to the back of the line spirit of God we can already have it but he's just going to go and set up in the tree and just sit there and wait and think when are you going to start feeding me right the spirit of God only feeds on one thing brothers and sisters it's this right here it's this right here if we start taking worldly pleasures thinking that it's going to be okay it's going to be just fine we'll be able to do this and we can handle that can you I'll say this maybe you can in your flesh because this flesh is super resilient but he can't amen nor will he he will not so if we want to see him live out through us we've got to make sure that we keep this Temple holy this Temple is the Temple of the Holy Ghost right we need to remember that this is the temple that we're talking about yes got to feed only on the word amen you know when we get sick sometimes we can we can only want the medicine and I know that I've been really sick at times and and I would have given anything for medication for something from the doctor to make me better and you know it uh I would have done just about anything like I said and you know many times spiritually we can become ill but are we willing to actually take the medicine and the medicine is the word there's a remedy brothers and sisters when we're dealing with an illness spiritually speaking but what we just got to take take the medicine take the medication get it down you know it's the word the whole word and nothing but the word that's the only thing that's going to work for us we're in a world where they're willing to take anything but the word amen anything but the word and you know in the words of Benjamin Franklin I I just thought it was so good an ounce of prevention brothers and sisters just a few minutes in prayer just one quarter of a scripture three words from a verse in the Bible and a few minutes in prayer an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure that's right if we take the time to give the Holy Ghost life in our lives he's waiting for us to feed him and when we do it brothers and sisters something Supernatural takes place and our prayers for today are are what affects us tomorrow Hallelujah we can't expect tomorrow that when we're driving to have the protection that we need because we haven't prayed I mean God is is rich in Mercy isn't he for the times that we do fail and we don't actually spend the time in prayer we don't feed on the word of God but yet he still protects us what a God we serve What a Mighty God oh he's so wonderful tonight I just want to get into reading here that's enough recap I could go on and on and on I could I think I could just preach continually over you know what we talk talked about you know last service but uh we need to carry on I know we do so I'm just going to start with uh paragraph 8 in uh chapter 1 introduction to chapter one paragraph 8 of the church age book and by the way if anybody wants one we have some let me know I know uh there's been a couple of requests brother Bram says now I said This Book of Revelation as a revelation of Jesus and what he's doing in the churches for those Seven Ages it is a revelation because the disciples themselves didn't know these recorded truths it had not been previously revealed to them you remember that they came to Jesus in the book of Acts and asked him are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel and he said it's not for you to know the times or the seasons those men were still thinking of Jesus having an Earthly Kingdom but it was a spiritual ual Kingdom that he was going to build even he could not tell them about his place in it for the father had not revealed it unto him but now after his death and resurrection and at this particular time in his mediatorial ministry he is able to set forth here in this revelation of himself to John what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do in this Revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is he tells how he's going to deal with the devil and cast him into a lake of fire the Lake of Fire his Lake of Fire he reveals the end of the wicked ones who follow Satan and Satan hates that have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudo scientists s he is always attacking the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation in both of these books we find Satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction that's why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is isn't that beautiful he can't hide he wants to hide but he can't hide Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can this is so critically important here brothers and sisters he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word yes that's right what's one of the easiest ways for him to destroy confidence in the word and that's to get people looking at people get people looking at others yeah get people looking at brother Barry brother Barry says don't look at brother Barry Barry says look at Lord Jesus Christ brother Barry will disappoint you we talked about it on Sunday and I want to take it a step further don't look at yourselves don't look at ourselves brothers and sisters take the confidence in the word and put it back in the word the word says that you're an overcomer the greater is he that is in who than he that is in this world and the that's in this world is is how many thousands times thousands of devils that poured out of Hollywood out of the the pit of Hell the the place where the lid was taken off and they're after you they're after me they're after our children but greater is he that is in US brothers and sisters than he that's in the world you're now already seated in Heavenly places you're more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus through this word that's in you Satan he hates this but we love it Jesus said that about this about said Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her I believe this is where we were leaving off last week and I want to tell you brothers and sisters those gates are swinging there is a nasty storm Brewing but you know what nothing is going to stop God's word from coming to pass in your and my life amen if he wants us to continue on as a body of Believers here in Calgary marching forward then nothing is going to stop it from happening right amen if he wants us to go in the Rapture the general resurrection and Rapture then nothing is going to stop it from happening doesn't matter what we see in our lives today doesn't matter what we see in our lives yesterday it doesn't matter what we can think about for our lives tomorrow all we need to do is humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord and He will lift us up paragraph 14 he says let me just put in a word here from my own Ministry if you don't mind you all know this gift in my life is Supernatural it's a gift whereby the holy spirit is able to discern diseases the thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only God could know and then reveal to me I wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed now it isn't the people that I'm talking about it is that Satan has got hold in their lives through sin indifference and disease but you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most peculiar changes come over the people's countenances Satan is afraid he knows that the spirit of God is about to let people know of his works that is why he hates these meetings so much when names are called and diseases revealed Satan hates it just want to point this out brothers and sisters Satan has got a hold in their lives this is his Avenues through sin which is unbelief indifference which is just saying me you know what nothing's going to change me I I've heard it all before I I know I I I got saved you know 100 years ago and I'm saved and nothing is ever going to move me it's all the same indifference and disease sometimes we get a sickness in our lives we get an illness God will allow us to have illnesses so that we'll say hey you know what I got to go on my back so I can look up you know if we can just actually do that ourselves just go on our knees and look up God will actually look after us he will prevent all three of those things from having the ability to do it in our lives paragraph 15 now what is this it's not mind reading it's not telepathy nor is it witchcraft it is a revelation by the holy ghost that is the only way I can know it of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the Holy Ghost we talked about this before when the word is coming forward when a minister is preaching people will say wow how does he know that why is he talking about that maybe someone's told him about my thoughts he nobody's told him about your thoughts the Holy Ghost is actually just speaking through him and he's speaking directly to you he's actually ministering by Revelation the through the Spirit by Revelation to you otherwise why do you come to church if you don't come to church to get re Revelation by the spirit brothers and sisters you're missing the point goes on to say let me show you another reason why Satan hates This Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows that he's talking about Satan here Satan knows that a lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it isn't that beautiful he is a formidable adversary he is created to fight his cause right to to the death amen but you know what we don't have to fight our cause to the death brothers and sisters the only thing we have to do is die to ourselves he's already fought it to the death he's already taken all of our sin to the death to the Cross to the Grave to hell and handed all of our sins directly to Satan and said you know what this group of people they're Justified I have taken all of their shame all of their sin and I put it right back on you Satan and Satan knows it he knows assuredly that that's what's happened and it's up to us to recognize that when we recognize that Satan will become powerless before us it exposes Satan reveals revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people that's what he wants to do is destroy God's people he thinks that he can do that he wants to destroy God's people and what the discrediting of God's word he wants to say that the way that Ephesians 4 says that you should have have a five-fold Ministry and you should gather together in the name of Jesus Christ even more so as you see that day approaching you know what maybe it's not that way maybe there's another way maybe you could actually just do something else or or go somewhere else or think something else you can do it just a little bit differently you can still take the whole message of the hour but just apply it the way that you think it suits and sometimes other people will say hey you know what that's what we do and then you've got a group of people that do it all together if it's not according to the word of God it's wrong amen doesn't matter what it is if you want to know whether it's right take it back to the word of God Amen and I'll tell you where I'm coming at from this I had a guy sent me a text message he's been texting me and I don't know the brother at all I'll say he's a brother but he's texting me and it's almost I don't know what to say maybe I shouldn't even be saying it but he's asking me what I feel about tape Ministry I say listen to the message of the hour and get Revelation by the spirit and see what he tells you about tap ministry right don't ask me we need to see what he wants to know about it ask him what he wants done with the word of God in our day and when he tells you take the answer per Adventure that brother's listening to me you know tonight I just want to take and focus in on paragraph 16 and uh just a little bit that I believe the Lord spoke to me about here we've got half an hour and I'll try not to keep us late here because we got many many miles to cover and we're just going to we're going to be the tortoise in the race we're just gonna take real small steps and uh we're going to finish just as far as the the Lord wants us to he'll take us paragraph 16 says let me show you another reason why Satan hates This Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that the Jes that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that he changes not and and what I want to get to you tonight brothers and sisters is this next sentence it it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's Hebrews 138 and if you wouldn't mind just turn there with me in your Bibles we'll get there I'm going to continue on he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians most people who study their way into Christianity they'll always always they'll be ever looking for the truth they'll always be studying ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth know all the quotes know all the scriptures been to all the places have many many friends all around the world but still continually contending for something contesting for something striving for something never able to just have rest and and have peace because that's what Paul said hey didn't he say that that we should be content with what we've got and you know it's not always about wealth it's not always about saying these are the clothes that I've got maybe it's the church we're in maybe it's the house we live in maybe it's the position that we're in in the world maybe we don't even have a church to go to how can that be correct sometimes God will put us in a place so that we can actually shine his light to someone that would never hear about the word of God am but you know we'll always come subject to the word always he says he knows that a whole lot he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows speaking about Satan Satan knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways that sentence right there brothers and sisters is really where we're gonna start to preach from tonight what does the word immutable mean I I just know there's some people that maybe don't know the meaning of it and and I want to take a little bit of time and just talk about those those words in that sentence because Satan knows something that maybe sometimes we don't know or we just don't really consciously think about but the prophet of God put this in this book God put this in this book through the prophet for a reason he's saying these words to us that that Satan knows that God is that way but I want to say tonight brothers and sisters do we know that God is that way because sometimes we act like he's not sometimes I act like he's not like there's something that I need to do something that I haven't done or something that I should do when really we're not talking about running a a sprinting race and sometimes it can feel that way we get inspiration of God and we just want to we want to shout it from the from the mountaintops and and we want to do all that we can for the kingdom of God and the message of the hour and then you know what happens Monday rolls around and we're exhausted Tuesday rolls around and we're exhausted and sometimes we'll get enough energy to come to church on a Wednesday and then we're a little bit excited and maybe we go through the rest of the week and it's just exhausting and it's tiring and it's hard and sometimes that's the way our lives are but you know what I think the spirit of God doesn't want to see us go like this and like this and I know we live in The Human Condition I think the spirit of God wants to see us just do this brothers and sisters just continually go higher and higher and higher and not be looking down on people even though you come to a place where you're not looking down but you're saying why is it that people don't actually see this why why don't why why are they struggling with certain things in their lives why are people doing that it's because we're in a one room Schoolhouse and we're all on our own Journeys we don't ever want to talk bad about people or look down on people we want to encourage people brother Bram says when someone's in the ditch you pull them out you don't push him further in but Satan knows that God is immutable in his nature the word immutable it means unchanging over time or unable to be changed he's immutable he's not changeable H humans are changeable aren't we changeable we have so many ways that we can be changed in so many different things that can happen but here brother bradam says he knows that since God is immutable in nature what's his nature we know that he's immutable unchanging over time or unable to be changed in what in his nature the basic or inherent features of something especially when seen as characteristic of it his word his word is the only thing that we have to judge him by we're not going to say that I want to take a person's account for him and say that that that's the only life that he lives we want to take his word that's the only thing that he wants we know that a lot of people claim the name of Jesus Christ they even claim the blood of Jesus Christ but when you take the word of Jesus Christ the words of Jesus Christ is a different story so we have immutable unchanging over time or unable to be changed in nature the basic inherent or inherent features of something especially when seen as characteristic of it immutable immutable I want to take and and look at another quote here uh I believe no this is the one sorry I'm just going to read it again he knows that since God is as immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 and action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be and I think we can look at that and read it from potentially a a Catholic or a maybe a theological standpoint where we would say that yeah the original church at Pentecost that was the the 120 in the upper room and and they had the the cloven tongues of fire came down upon their heads and into the room like a rushing Mighty Wind and and they lost all their fear first first they were hiding in Jerusalem but then suddenly they were fearless and they went out into the streets and they were talking in different tongues and all the people around said how is it that they're speaking to us in our own language in our own tongues you know that's exactly what he's talking about but there's also the compound meaning and Revelation to it and you know we're talking about that that compound meaning and Revelation for us in our lives too Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 and action this is where we left off last week reading Mark 16 and action there's things that the Church of God will be able to do you know God's not going to clown for nobody we're not going to go and drink poison we're not going to handle snakes we're not going to do all that stuff just to try and prove God we're going to take the word and put the word out there first and say that's what I believe this is what I believe I'm going to handle this word of God and see if the Devils don't tremble because I'm not just going to shake the word of God I'm going to eat the word of God and I'm going to become the word of God and Satan will know assuredly that this Temple has not become lukewarm formal and Powerless amen because it's truly Mark 16 in action in my life because you know brothers and sisters we all have to have a testimony doesn't matter whether we come from a a message home and we've never had any issues in our lives God is GNA see fit for us to go through trials trials are what's going to bring out whoever's living inside of us and if it's the devil that's hiding in there God's going to bring a trial to squish that devil out of you if you're a son and daughter of God and you know what we know that the word of God says that the trials of our faith are worth more they're more precious to a True Believer than any amount of riches in this world and you know it's not the trials of of my job and it's not the trials of my finances my my financial portfolio it's not the trials of any different thing that we could have in this life other than our faith Satan wants to get our faith in the word he wants to discredit the word of God in our lives but when we can esteem this word to be the greatest thing in our lives when we get Satan coming around we can say hey satan come here come here Satan I want to show you you see that lentil right there up above that door that lentil has the token and you see the post beside it right there and right there that blood was applied and I apply it again now in the name of Jesus Christ and you've got no power over me there's nothing that you can say or do to change my my ability to have credibility in the word of God I might not understand the situation I might not understand the circumstances I might not even understand the brother or the sister but I believe the word of God and I believe he is more powerful than any circumstance that I could see with my natural eye you know you know talking about this this this this sentence Satan knows that that he is as immutable in his nature that he is in his ways and the word way is a method style or manner of doing something there are two ways of approaching this problem similar method course or action a Road Track path or Street for traveling along his way Satan knows that God he he performs the same way throughout all of the years throughout all of the ages all of the church ages but Satan comes around and tries to actually get people to think that there's no credit to the word of God that that like we said last time that maybe the cloud was something wrong something was a miss and some people are Fanatics to think that there was a picture taken of a pillar of fire and maybe they had some sort of sort of sort of uh uh I don't know what you want to call he's already said that it's not witchcraft or or whatever but when the prophet of God stood on on the stage and said he's here now and I can see what is going on in people's lives I can discern diseases it wasn't him that was doing it it was that Pillar of Fire the same Pillar of Fire that came down on those 120 people in the upper room back on the day of Pentecost he was actually showing that this was the same Pillar of Fire the same one that came and revealed himself to the people back in the day in biblical days but Satan knows that God doesn't change yes amen and I just want to underline that tonight Satan knows that God can't change brothers and sisters I want to encourage every one of us tonight that God can't change he's not dead brothers and sisters he's very very much alive he is more alive than Satan is Satan is doomed Satan is on his path he's on the highway to hell we are not he even sang the song about it but you know I want to point this out tonight brothers and sisters I out of the Ephesian Church age if you were to type in the search I don't know if it will come up for you I didn't give you this tonight but the key given me the key given me out of the Ephesian Church age this is the Keystone out of the Bible brothers and sisters and this is why I think it's so important that that what we're talking about he's just as immutable in his nature as he is in his ways his nature his his his his his tender loving kindness he is a gentleman he doesn't want to slap us around that is a dogmatic human trait it's the devil that gets inside of men it's that Beast nature that wants to try and punish and make people feel bad God is a gentleman God wants to take us and lift us up and dust us off and bring love to our lives he wants to tell us that we're seated in Heavenly places that we're not doomed for Destruction but it's the devil that gets around that tries to make people feel bad but the Keystone revelation of the Bible is what I want to talk about brother Bram says it here the key given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible if everybody anybody knows what a keystone is it's the central stone that you would take and and you would make everything supported by usually in an archway over top of a door you would put the Keystone in right in the middle and it would hold it would support that entire Arch all of the weight above it would press down upon that one stone in the middle the Keystone the key given me by the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one can you imagine that it's not a most theological one it's not one that maybe an angel came and told me when I was in a cave it's not one that I found when I was sitting by a tree hunting squirrels it's a most scriptural one he takes it right back to the Bible right back to the word in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible it's the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is now this is white quite a ways ahead in the message the the exposition of the seven Church ages this is the Ephesian Church age the very first church age but he's saying the same thing that's right he's not changing it he's not taking and making it convenient for a little bit in the in the interest of of capturing people's attention he's saying the same thing and he just keeps underlining it that it's the word of God it's a scriptural answer is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 138 did we open that up I just got so excited I apologize let's read that Hebrews 138 a simple call it simple scripture maybe something that's really really spoken a lot and and we all know it so well but let's just read it tonight and and maybe let's just read it together let's speak it out loud because Satan knows these words and I think it's important for us to remind Satan that you know what he ain't the only one that knows these words the Revelation by the spirit to the True Believer can never be overemphasized brothers and sisters he isn't ever present help in our time of trouble in our time of need but Hebrews 138 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen he's not going to be different tomorrow he's no different than he was yesterday and he is the same right now tonight in this service with us Brothers and Sisters Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Keystone of the Bible Ecclesiastes 3:14-15 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever amen has God done you amen brothers and sisters you're forever amen if God has done you you're forever you're an eternal being he can't lose a part of himself and he took you from his side and expressed you in this age you're a manifested attribute of the almighty God my goodness whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nothing can be put to you nor anything be taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is p the beginning the ending the past the present the future it's all God's it's all his he has seen it all he has done it all and he is it all brother bradam goes on to say here it is an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change sometimes brother brandham says we can pray for things and we don't see it actually manifest the way that we pray it the way that we ask God we know that his word says if you have anything that you want just ask anything in my name and I'll give it to you as long as it's according to his will and not just according to his will but according to his will for your day according to his will for your season he's not just going to do exactly what we want every time we want it because we don't have the character to do that because we know that brother brandham said it that power without character is what it's satanic because we will want to do it upon the lust of Our Lives of our flesh of our spirit but you know as we pray tonight brothers and sisters we got to go beyond our flesh that's why we got to spend time in prayer we've got to go beyond our spirit we got to get through all of that that Humanity that's in the way of us and get that channel open from our soul to the Lord and when we go and stand before his throne in that state brothers and sisters on our knees having the right perspective when we talk about standing before his throne when we go there on that basis that's where he hears from us and that's where we hear back from him that's where we make contact with him and you know what sometimes the prayers that we pray will actually change when we get into that state because it's no longer us that are making the intercessions but it's his Spirit living out through us making groanings that we can't even comprehend right but then we'll see the Lord come on the scene then we'll see him actually take over that's when we see the hand of God move in our lives there will never be a change brothers and sisters he says apply that to the church ages when you read this for me it just unlocked it it's like wow it's such a dynamic Revelation that he is just the same yesterday today forever you know what then when you read this when you read the church ages you recognize that God has a pattern and he has a people that fit that pattern and those people they that fit the pattern you can tell whether they fit the pattern because you can give them the word test are they come up with a new Fantastic or are they taking whatever it is their teaching back to the word of God hallelujah if they're taking it back to the word of God then you got to say whoa hold on a second I need to take a look at this if you believe the word of God if you don't believe the word of God then there's really not much to talk about but if you are a son and daughter of God and you hear this for the first time you're going to say whoa what's going on what are you talking about what's all this noise about I I maybe don't understand all of it but something on the inside of the inside says my goodness tell tell me more yes amen he says apply that to the church ages the kind of excuse me the kind of a man God that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's Ministry would be the example for all other ages what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other agesen and we know the first church age start starts with Ephesus that was out of the Ephesian Church age and we get there um we got a little ways to go though and hopefully I can not talk too much it's quite a ways ahead but you know it's just a beautiful thing to to recognize that he has a pattern he has a way he is the same yesterday today forever he he is going to deal with us the way that he's always dealt with us as a gentleman we don't have to worry about getting slapped around by God it's the devil that wants to do that to us brothers and sisters so when we have that that feeling come over us of of pangs of fear that's a Spirit of bondage that's trying to get a hold of our lives and you know what it will cause us to do when we get too afraid is we'll start to actually become the the the words that we already read tonight and and and you know indifference is a big thing we can start to become indifferent about the word of God in our lives and about our situation we can say that our situation isn't going to change I got myself into this spot and I can't see a way out and you might not be able to see a way out but just look up brothers and sisters eat the book spend time in prayer feed that Holy Ghost life in your life don't go to a trash can and think that you're going to actually satisfy him that he's going to grow and and see him manifest in your life in a better way if you go to a garbage can you're going to put garbage in you're going to get garbage out but you know what good food makes good food isn't that the the saying good spiritual food brothers and sisters there's only one spiritual food by the way and it's the word of God am if we're spending time doing things that that don't gratify that don't edify that Holy Ghost In Our Lives don't think for a second that we're going to have overcoming power the devil's going to run rough shot over us and you know what he's a coward I want to remind us of this brothers and sisters he might not come and punch Us in the nose he might come and punch our kid in the nose that's the way the devil operates and you know what he's a coward but he's already defeated coward and he's running scared because he knows that we're moving into this revelation of who we are and when we catch that full revelation of what position we're in then the Rapture will go and that's what we want to try and do is encourage us to remember who we are and Satan will be powerless before us when we can recognize him within the framework of what the Christian Church where's the Christian Church Brothers and Sisters stop looking at the internet stop looking at at other churches around stop looking at one another stop look start looking inside this is the Christian church right here take a look inside and see if the spirit and if this flesh is getting the way of that Soul if it's getting in the way of that Soul peel them back crucify this flesh crucify your spirit and allow that soul to actually manifest the word of God in our lives and see what happens you know in Malachi 3 Verse 6 maybe turn there with me we got five minutes five minutes I won't try and keep us I'll try not to keep us late but uh Malachi chapter 3 I know there's lots of scriptures we'll just skip across the pawn like we've talked about we'll just hit a few Malachi CH 3 Verse 6 for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed brothers and sisters tonight you are the sons of Jacob and and you're not consumed I'll call you the spiritual sons of Jacob Satan wants us to believe that God has changed that God can't hear our prayers that God won't hear our prayers that God don't hear our prayers maybe he's busy maybe he's on vacation maybe we just send away our day of Grace you know if you have the desire to serve the Lord brothers and sisters you ain't s send away your day of Grace if you got the desire to serve God then then there's something on the inside of the inside that's trying to speak through and you know we've had brother brandham say it that's the Holy Ghost knocking on the door of your heart saying open the door unto me uh there's no handle on the outside I can't open that door unto you like that that that that picture that we've seen so many times of Jesus standing on the outside holding the lantern knocking on the door and and we know that guy said there's no no you made a mistake in the picture you never put a handle on the outside that handle is only on the inside same thing with the the heart of a Believer it's only on the inside open that door once to him and just see if he won't come in and suck with you that's what the word of God says Satan wants us to believe that God has changed that he's tired he's old he's busy it's it's a it's a hectic world and we don't have the hotline to him but the only thing we've got to do is just like I said go on our knees brothers and sisters and take the time to actually push through all of this flesh get past this this flesh yes get past our spirit get past that Spirit don't just look for a new spirit get beyond that new spirit and get into the Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit Will begin to intercede for us to the throne of grace and when that happens that's when this Earth will shake that's when our lives will change all around us but if we're just going to church and we're just doing our duties and it's just a religion to us it's just a covering and Satan knows it and so does God you know what there's nothing going to happen in our lives we're going to just keep going in circles brother brandham said it is the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and thinking hoping praying that something different is going to come out of it nothing will come out of it natural saying that I've heard if you do what you've always done you're going to get what you've always got but if you're truly a son and daughter of God you'll only do it for a while and then he'll allow a pitfall a a speed bump to come along your way and something will trip you up and you'll have a little trial and that trial will take you back to to really what you need to do will begin to cry out to God because he's a a mutable in his nature as he is in his ways look at the children of Israel they would get saved they would have the enemies come in and thrash them and they would cry out to God save us oh look at our enemies look at us wo is us we've done so evil in the sight of the Lord and what would he do he would come and deliver them and he'd set them back up again and dust them off and say you're my children and you're in your Promised Land don't you worry just make sure that you serve me the way that I've instructed and then they would get comfortable in their position they would have all their bills paid and everything would be great in their lives and then they'd begin to let the bars down and oh my the enemy would start to come in and all these different evil things would begin to happen and before long the the gates are down and and and it's all just terrible and they cry out to God once again just like he's dealt with the children of Israel brothers and sisters we're no different we're Sons and Daughters of God but when we cry out to him his ears are open always every time we pray and he will come and pick us up and set us up upon a rock a rock of Revelation that we don't have to do this anymore we don't have to go in that Circle over and over and over again we don't have to continue on with these trials that never seem to end just feed on the word brothers and sisters and you won't even be a trial anymore that's the secret to it yes that's the key to it that I believe the Lord wants us to know forget about the trials and focus on the word yes don't look at the problems look at the promise continue to look at the promise look at the word of God feed on the word of God if you cannot read the word of God because of your time or whatever your pressures of Life press play you can get an audio Bible on your device and that audio Bible will actually play the word of God and just doing that creates an atmosphere because we know we read it that that blessed is he that that reads and hears the words of this prophecy so I want to say which prophecy some would say well it's only the Book of Revelation is it only the Book of Revelation I would say it's the entire word of God Amen play the word of God if you can't read the word of God feed upon the word brothers and sisters you will become the word and Satan will see that you are not lukewarm formal and Powerless you know it's man that actually has allowed allowed the idea to to happen Satan in man I'll call the musicians it's time to close but it's man that's actually done it it's Satan getting into man that's caused this idea that that God is maybe just a little bit different you know he he was really good in the prophet wasn't he he had a tremendous Ministry in in in William Mariam branham's life but why did William Mariam brandham have that tremendous Ministry because God chose him to actually go and have that Ministry why was that Ministry there why why do we have that Ministry it was to call a bride of his own choosing and that bride of his own choosing is supposed to actually have the same potentials as that Prophet did some people might say oh brother Barry that's going a little bit far but I I believe this with all my heart and I believe the real Believers believe it that he was the wave sheath that was actually waved the mature crop that was waved over top of the congregation to say blessed be the name of the most high God this is the mature level that you are going to come to those people who are able to take this book and eat it up they will actually come to full maturity and some people can take it and some people can't and that's okay because it's predestination nobody can put anybody in or take anybody out amen it's him that doth it all God bless you tonight stand with me as we close in prayer brothers and sisters it's same Pillar of Fire that's with us tonight right now in our lives he wants us to feed upon him he wants us to eat the book he wants us to know that he is just the same yesterday today and forever and he's only listening to your voice he's only listening to our voice he's not looking at our flesh here on this world there's a reason why we have ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church it's because we already have a body waiting for us on the other side and nobody can see anybody here I don't see you and you don't see me we see this manifestation of this flesh this this this body that we're trapped in but we can't see the real you and the real me but you know what just keep pressing on brothers and sisters just like brother bradam saw in in that Vision just keep pressing on and one of these days Everything Will Change for us we will see our theophany bodies we'll see each other as we will be seen God bless you tonight let's just pray gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you Lord for the encouragement that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord and that you change not and that we are the sons of Jacob
