[18:09] now, Satan has tried to stop us.
[18:15] But the ride of
[18:17] Jesus, Lord, we're still
[18:21] alive. Oh, like a mighty
[18:26] army. We keep maring
[18:30] onward winning every battle.

[19:18] gathered in his name to
[19:22] worship him. Receive our worship, Lord.
[19:26] We have come into his house.
[19:31] We've gathered in his
[19:33] name to
[19:35] worship
[19:38] him. For we have come into his house.
[19:44] We've gathered in his name to
[19:48] worship Christ our
[19:51] Lord. Oh
[19:54] worship him. Oh
[19:58] Jesus Christ our Lord. We sing in a
[20:01] second verse but John Panicker would you
[20:03] come over prayer? Let's forget about
[20:08] ourselves. Let's concentrate on him and
[20:13] worship him. We worship you Lord. Oh
[20:18] let's forget about ourselves.
[20:22] Let's concentrate on him and worship
[20:29] him. Let's forget about

[20:45] worship him. Oh
[20:47] [Music]
[20:56] Jesus. Let us bow our heads in a word of
[20:59] prayer. Aba heavenly father, we come
[21:02] into your holy aas presence. Lord,
[21:05] knowing that you are all
[21:06] sufficient. Lord, we acknowledge that we
[21:09] have done nothing good to merit your
[21:12] grace. Lord, we have nothing good inside
[21:14] us that we can bring to you. Lord, we
[21:17] only look towards that lamb that you
[21:19] have slain for us. Lord, before the
[21:22] foundation of the world, Lord, you paid
[21:24] the price so that we could be here.
[21:27] Lord, I thank you, Jesus. I praise your
[21:29] name, Lord. I worship you, Lord. You
[21:32] have brought us here today, Lord. You
[21:34] have given us journey mercies. You have
[21:36] separated us from the world, Lord. For
[21:38] your name, Lord. I thank you and I
[21:40] praise you, Lord. Lord, we pray to you.
[21:43] We come to you as a congregation. Lord,
[21:45] you have said that where wherever two or
[21:47] three are gathered in my name, you shall
[21:49] be present here, Lord. In your presence,
[21:51] we are coming, Lord. And we know that,
[21:53] you know, our insufficiencies and in our
[21:56] weaknesses, we can touch you, Lord. And
[21:59] we can get our healing, Lord, and our
[22:01] needs, Lord, are all fulfilled from you,
[22:04] Lord. We cannot do anything for
[22:06] ourselves, Lord. We completely depend
[22:08] upon your love and your grace Lord.
[22:10] Today Lord when we come to you we pray
[22:13] to you Lord. You anoint our pastor Lord.
[22:15] You anoint that vessel Lord that you
[22:17] know we hear from our theophanes today
[22:20] Lord. We have come here to be a changed
[22:22] person Lord. We want to be more like you
[22:24] Jesus. We want to be like you Lord. Oh
[22:28] and you are worthy Lord. The lamb who
[22:31] was slain was worthy is worthy Lord. Oh
[22:34] we thank you Jesus. We thank you for the
[22:36] bleeding word that has come today. Lord,
[22:38] that is the atonement for our sins.
[22:40] Lord, we know that the promises that you
[22:43] have given, Lord, they are all true.
[22:44] Lord, you are not a man that you should
[22:46] lie. Lord, you are true. Lord,
[22:49] consecrate our hearts and our ears,
[22:51] Lord, so that we can hear from you,
[22:53] Lord, and be changed. Lord, we give you
[22:56] all glory and all honor, Lord. In the
[22:58] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[23:00] Christ, we ask this prayer. Amen. Amen.
[23:06] Amen. Thank you, brother John. You may
[23:07] have your seats tonight. See, brother
[23:10] Peter's back. I'm sure his family's

[23:13] he's thrilled to be back, but long time
[23:16] to be away, but good to see you tonight,
[23:18] my brother. Hold to God's unchanging
[23:21] hand.

[31:29] Stand with me if you would as we call
[31:30] our pastor tonight.
[31:32] And by his grace I
[31:37] am

[31:44] am made clean. Thank you Lord for that.
[31:49] Oh and I now can

[31:54] him
[31:56] face

[33:42] I see.
[33:47] Oh, for

[34:00] shine. For your
[34:04] grace

[34:54] holy fear. That first verse again. Oh
[34:57] Lord, you're beautiful.
[35:01] Oh

[35:07] beautiful. I believe he loves to hear
[35:09] that from us tonight. Oh, and
[35:13] [Music]
[35:16] you bless my
[35:19] brother. I see.
[35:23] [Music]
[35:28] When your
[35:32] eyes are
[35:34] on
[35:36] this
[35:39] child, your
[35:42] grace
[35:43] [Music]
[35:46] abounds in
[35:50] me. God bless you tonight. Welcome to
[35:52] the house of the Lord. Certainly happy
[35:55] to be back after a tremendous
[35:59] Sunday. If you have a need this evening,
[36:01] maybe just make it known unto him by way
[36:03] of an uplift hand. Just have one
[36:06] request. We want to pray for the Ahen
[36:09] family who will be burying uh brother
[36:12] Ben and brother Corey Ahen I believe
[36:15] tomorrow.
[36:18] Heavenly Father, tonight Lord, we know
[36:22] that we do not seek a continuing city
[36:27] here. Father, we know that this world
[36:30] has to come to an end. That this world
[36:33] is a
[36:34] negative, Lord. That there is a positive
[36:38] somewhere. And Father, our
[36:42] desire, our desire, Lord, is to see that
[36:46] positive. Lord, many times we have so
[36:49] many burdens
[36:51] and problems and issues in this life
[36:55] and Lord, it almost seems like it's more
[36:58] than we can bear. But we know that your
[37:00] word says that you will never give us
[37:02] more than we can bear. And Father, we
[37:05] just want to pray for the Henue family
[37:07] tonight. Just want to unite together and
[37:10] stand with them.
[37:12] Father, we know that when you take
[37:15] people from this side over to eternity,
[37:19] Lord, that there's a hole and that hole
[37:23] can never be filled here, not with
[37:27] anything. And Father, we just pray for
[37:29] the family that you'll give them
[37:30] strength, Lord. That you'll give them
[37:32] encouragement, Father. That you will
[37:34] bind up the brokenhearted, Lord. that
[37:37] you'll help them, Lord, as they watch
[37:40] for another day to come to
[37:44] pass. Father, we pray tonight for each
[37:46] and every need that was made known unto
[37:48] you by the way of an uplift hand.
[37:49] Father, we know that you're more than
[37:51] able to meet the needs, Lord. And
[37:53] Father, we just commit them into your
[37:56] hands. And Father, if it be your will,
[37:59] we will be careful to bring you a praise
[38:02] offering, Lord. We will bring a
[38:04] testimony of what you've done for us
[38:07] tonight. Father, we pray that you would
[38:08] be with those who couldn't be here
[38:10] tonight, wherever they are, whatever
[38:11] they're doing. We just ask that you
[38:14] would bless them abundantly. Father, now
[38:16] as we turn to the the next order of the
[38:19] service, the highest order of the
[38:21] service. Lord, help us all to get out of
[38:23] the way and to yield to you, the speaker
[38:27] and the hearer alike.
[38:28] Father, we just ask all these things in
[38:32] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God
[38:36] bless you tonight. Thank you musicians.
[38:38] If you have your Bibles, I would like to
[38:41] read from the book of
[38:42] Revelation. And I'd like to read from
[38:45] Revelation chapter
[38:47] 1. As we bring the exposition of the
[38:51] seven church
[38:52] ages almost to a
[38:55] close, I
[38:57] uh I just thought it would be
[38:59] appropriate because we're not actually
[39:01] in a church age. We're reading the
[39:02] resume of the ages and it's a summary of
[39:04] them all. Let's read Revelations 1 verse
[39:07] one.
[39:10] the revelation of Jesus Christ, which
[39:12] God gave unto him to show unto his
[39:15] servants things which must shortly come
[39:19] to pass. And he sent and signified it by
[39:22] his angel unto his servant John, who
[39:25] bare record of the word of God, and of
[39:28] the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of
[39:31] all things that he saw.
[39:36] Blessed is he that readeth, and they
[39:39] that hear the words of this
[39:41] prophecy, and keep those things which
[39:44] are written therein, for the time is at
[39:48] hand.
[39:50] John to the seven
[39:53] churches which are in Asia. Grace be
[39:55] unto you and peace from him which is and
[39:59] which was and which is to come and from
[40:01] the seven spirits which are before his
[40:04] throne. And from Jesus Christ who is the
[40:07] faithful witness and the first begotten
[40:09] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[40:13] of the earth. Unto him that loved us and
[40:17] washed us from our sins. in his own
[40:20] blood, and hath made us kings and
[40:22] priests. Unto God and his Father. To him
[40:27] be glory and dominion forever and ever.
[40:31] Amen. Let's just bow one more time.
[40:33] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that
[40:36] we can read this scripture by
[40:37] revelation, Lord, knowing that you have
[40:40] given us the ability to comprehend it,
[40:43] Father. Not by our own valition, Lord,
[40:47] but by a prophet, by a prophetic
[40:49] utterance, by your avenue that you
[40:52] chose. We just accept it the way that
[40:54] you've given it, Lord. And we pray that
[40:56] you would just break it open to us fresh
[40:58] once again tonight, Lord. We just commit
[41:00] all the words that are spoken into your
[41:02] hands now for your glory. In Jesus
[41:04] Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless
[41:07] you tonight. You may be
[41:10] seated. It's a wonderful thing to be
[41:12] back in service. We had a wonderful time
[41:16] on Sunday. Just
[41:18] a beautiful thing to wash one another's
[41:21] feet and to partake of the communion
[41:23] table.
[41:25] Just want to continue on with our study
[41:27] in the uh resume of the ages. I'm going
[41:31] to go back a couple paragraphs. I just
[41:33] want to pick up where we left off last
[41:35] time and uh we'll just see what will
[41:37] happen. We might finish tonight, we
[41:39] might not. We'll just see what the Lord
[41:40] wants to do here. And uh you know,
[41:43] Brother Bradom, he's talking about
[41:46] politics entering into the church. And I
[41:50] think it's just amazing because if you
[41:52] step back and look at it and we can see
[41:54] it happening in the resume of the ages,
[41:56] that was the one thing that brought down
[41:58] each and every church age was politics
[42:02] creeping into the church. And that is
[42:04] the leadership of man over man. And I
[42:08] just think it's amazing because I have
[42:10] such a a view of it now in the church
[42:13] looking at it through the lens of the
[42:15] church ages. That is the antichrist
[42:18] spirit that creeps into the framework of
[42:21] the Christian church and causes it to
[42:23] become lukewarm, formal and powerless.
[42:27] The ideas of man intermingling with the
[42:31] word of God and becoming a hybrid
[42:34] religion. And that is the downfall of
[42:37] every single church age. But here we
[42:40] have brother Brham um in the resume of
[42:42] the ages. He says because human
[42:43] government is politics pure and simple,
[42:47] the church became involved in politics.
[42:50] Human government caused the church to
[42:53] become involved in politics. This
[42:56] involvement was welcome welcomed by a
[42:59] dictator emperor who joined church
[43:02] politics with state politics and by
[43:05] force established the false church,
[43:08] Satan's false religion as the true
[43:11] religion. And now we know he's talking
[43:13] about this from a historical
[43:15] perspective. There was an emperor. There
[43:18] was a blending of church and state and
[43:21] it became Satan's false religion and he
[43:24] was able to crush the
[43:27] people. He says this is Satan's false
[43:30] religion and it became as the true
[43:32] religion. And though various edicts by
[43:35] various emperors, we find the false
[43:38] church with state power destroying the
[43:42] true vine even more
[43:45] avidly. Sad to say the true vine was not
[43:49] exactly immune to this
[43:52] doctrine. By that I do not mean that the
[43:54] true vine ever did establish the
[43:57] nicicoatan ideas as a doctrine. Far from
[44:01] it. But that little worm of death kept
[44:05] sucking at the true vine, hoping that it
[44:08] might fall. Even within the true church,
[44:13] men whom God had called as
[44:16] overseers were holding that title to
[44:19] mean a little more than just a local
[44:23] responsibility.
[44:26] It was not the clear understanding of
[44:29] Paul that existed in the church at this
[44:32] time. For Paul had said, "And they
[44:35] glorified God in me." In Galatians
[44:39] 1:24, no matter what authority Paul had,
[44:43] he kept the people looking to God from
[44:47] whom is all authority. And I personally
[44:51] think that is the critical factor. We
[44:54] point to Jesus
[44:55] Christ through the baptism of the Holy
[45:00] Spirit. Excuse me. But the clergy was
[45:04] always looking to divine leadership plus
[45:08] human and it is capitalized there plus
[45:11] human. And thus in giving honor where
[45:14] honor was not due, we find that the true
[45:17] church was spotted with humanism. Now
[45:21] he's not talking about the false church
[45:23] being spotted with humanism. The true
[45:26] church spotted with
[45:29] humanism. With nickelatanism
[45:32] established, apostolic succession placed
[45:37] ministers, pastors voted in, etc. It was
[45:41] only one step for the false church to
[45:44] proceed to balamism.
[45:48] Now, I I had thought about getting into
[45:50] that tonight. I don't I don't
[45:52] know. Maybe Numbers chapter 22, the
[45:56] story of Balum. It's pretty powerful
[45:59] when you look at it. Balumism, the
[46:02] second step to the depth of Satan was
[46:05] now in full progress. And how was it? It
[46:08] was it was human. It was the word plus
[46:10] humanism. And you know, one little bit
[46:13] of humanism mixing with that word is
[46:16] balamism. It's not necessarily a dump
[46:20] truck full of humanism with it. It's
[46:22] just a little tiny bit. We know that was
[46:24] the same thing that happened in the
[46:26] Garden of Eden. The second step was the
[46:29] doctrine of Balum described in
[46:31] Revelations 2:14 where Balam taught Bale
[46:34] to stumble the children of Israel by a
[46:37] united
[46:38] meeting. There the guests would do two
[46:42] more things contrary to the word of God.
[46:45] You will recall that Bailac needed help
[46:47] to keep his kingdom. And you know, when
[46:49] I was looking at this, he was afraid. He
[46:53] didn't just think, you know, I I could
[46:54] use a little assistance here. It's
[46:55] getting a little heavy. We need some
[46:57] extra lifting. Maybe, you know, many
[46:58] hands make for light work. It wasn't
[47:00] that at all. He was afraid. Moab was
[47:03] very afraid of what was actually taking
[47:05] place. He saw the children of Israel and
[47:07] the power of God behind them coming out.
[47:10] And we know where where the Moabites
[47:12] came from, don't we?
[47:14] The Moabites came from a a bad
[47:18] relationship, not the right way. And uh
[47:21] anyways, we're not going to get into all
[47:22] of that, but he was afraid. Moab was
[47:24] afraid. And it was the king of of the
[47:26] Moabites that was actually afraid. But
[47:28] here we have this whole entire idea
[47:32] being built up through this guy Bailac.
[47:36] He taught Balam to stumble the children
[47:39] of Israel by a united meeting. There the
[47:42] guest would do two more things. Contrary
[47:44] to the word of God, you recall that
[47:45] Bailac needed help to keep his kingdom.
[47:48] He called on the most dominant spiritual
[47:50] figure of the day. Balam. Balam gave the
[47:56] advice that trapped and destroyed
[47:58] Israel. It was first of all to suggest
[48:02] that they all get together and talk
[48:04] things over and eat together and get
[48:08] things ironed out.
[48:10] My you know that that happens today. I
[48:13] just have to say it. I'm going to say it
[48:14] straight. That happens exactly today.
[48:17] After all, understanding each other goes
[48:20] a long
[48:21] way. Once you accomplish that, you can
[48:25] go from there. The next step would be
[48:27] worshiping together. And of course, a
[48:30] little pressure from the host usually
[48:33] makes the guest go a lot further than
[48:36] they intended.
[48:38] Now, that didn't only happen back there
[48:40] to God's church of the Old Testament,
[48:42] but it happened to the church of the New
[48:45] Testament. For there was an emperor who,
[48:48] like Baleo, needed help to secure his
[48:50] kingdom. So, Constantine invited the
[48:52] nominal Christian, first Christian
[48:54] church of Rome to help him get the
[48:57] Christians behind him as they were a
[49:00] very large body. The outcome was the
[49:03] Nyine Council of 3:25.
[49:06] There the Christians, both true and
[49:08] nominal, came together at the invitation
[49:11] of
[49:12] Constantine. The true Christians had no
[49:15] business even going up to the
[49:17] meeting. My
[49:20] in spite of all Constantine could do to
[49:23] unite them all, the real believers knew
[49:27] they were out of place and left.
[49:31] But to those who remained, Constantine
[49:34] gave of the state's treasury along with
[49:37] political and physical force. And we
[49:39] know he goes on to say that at that
[49:40] point he owned them. Right? The people
[49:44] were introduced to idol worship and
[49:46] spiritualism for statues and names of
[49:49] saints were placed in the buildings and
[49:51] the people were taught to commune with
[49:53] the dead or pray to saints which is
[49:55] nothing more nothing less than
[49:58] spiritualism.
[50:00] For the food that man truly needs, even
[50:03] the word of God, they were given creeds
[50:05] and dogmas and
[50:07] rituals, which were also enforced by the
[50:10] state. And above all, they were given
[50:14] three gods with a triple compound name
[50:17] of the one true God. and water baptism
[50:21] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:23] gave way to the pagan baptism of three
[50:27] titles. Father, Son, Holy
[50:30] Ghost. Now, I just want to say I I I had
[50:34] a hard time with this when I first
[50:35] started coming around. I really didn't
[50:37] comprehend it. I didn't understand it.
[50:39] And and I think everyone here does, but
[50:41] perhaps there's maybe someone that
[50:43] doesn't maybe just see it crystal clear.
[50:45] But you know, you can look at pretty
[50:46] much any denominational church website
[50:50] now and look at the about us or what we
[50:54] believe and you will see that they
[50:57] believe this very thing.
[51:00] I thought for a while that it was just
[51:02] Roman churches, Roman Catholic churches,
[51:04] maybe just Catholic churches because
[51:06] there's different Catholic churches than
[51:08] Roman Catholic churches. And I I just
[51:10] love how the prophet said it. You know,
[51:11] if if God's going to judge the world by
[51:13] anything, what's he going to judge it
[51:15] by? Is it going to be the Catholic
[51:16] Church? Which one? Is it going to be the
[51:18] Pentecostals? Which one? The Baptist?
[51:20] How many are there? The pro all the
[51:23] different denominations. But he's not
[51:25] going to judge the church by any church.
[51:27] He's going to judge the church. And
[51:29] isn't it beautiful how brother Brandham
[51:30] brought it out, the Holy Ghost through
[51:32] him, we were reading it last week, that
[51:34] the people even who claim to call
[51:36] themselves Christians but don't live
[51:38] according to the word, they're still
[51:39] going to be judged according to the same
[51:42] measure because of what they call
[51:44] themselves. That's pretty heavy. That's
[51:47] pretty strong. But if they're willing to
[51:49] call themselves that, then they're going
[51:50] to put themselves in that category. He's
[51:52] going to say, "You called yourself that.
[51:54] Why didn't you obey it?"
[51:56] If he's going to judge the world by
[51:58] anything, he's going to judge it by his
[52:00] word only by his word because he esteems
[52:03] his word greater even than his name,
[52:05] even than the blood, anything else.
[52:09] It's his word.
[52:12] It's amazing to think about this. But
[52:15] here we have the Nyian council and
[52:17] that's where Constantine brought them
[52:19] together and they had the balum bailac
[52:22] experience and and caused them to change
[52:24] everything. They came together. They
[52:25] said everything is fine. And we know
[52:26] that's the sin that God said, "Hey, I
[52:28] I'm I'll never forgive Israel for that.
[52:30] That won't actually go away ever. You
[52:32] will have that now
[52:33] forever." But, uh, here we are as the
[52:37] nominal Christians decided to go
[52:39] forwards with this. But I love how he
[52:41] says here, the true Christians actually
[52:42] saw it was going on. They got up and
[52:44] left. They didn't even stick around. The
[52:47] real believers ought not to have gone
[52:49] there. They had already lost much truth.
[52:52] And now they too would lose the
[52:54] understanding of Godhead and forfeit
[52:57] names for titles in water
[52:59] baptism. Now watch this doctrine of
[53:02] Balum most carefully.
[53:05] Notice above all that it is the
[53:08] deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy
[53:13] to bind the people to
[53:16] them by leading the people deliberately
[53:19] into their the sin of unbelief.
[53:23] The nickelatan doctrine was the
[53:26] corruption of the clergy as they sought
[53:29] political power amongst
[53:31] themselves. While balumism is the
[53:34] subjection of the people to their system
[53:37] of creed and worship in order to hold
[53:41] them. If you don't do it the way that we
[53:43] do it here, then maybe there's something
[53:46] wrong.
[53:48] the nickelatan doctrine to to cause
[53:50] people to be afraid to say that you know
[53:52] what unless you actually are worshiping
[53:55] under my ministry I've got the edge God
[53:58] gave me a tremendous
[54:00] revelation binding people to them by
[54:03] fear we see it even in and around this
[54:05] message of the hour but it's beautiful
[54:07] because we know that God said through
[54:09] his prophet you will never denominate
[54:10] this message there's no way that you
[54:12] could because it's Christ
[54:16] many times people will say I'm in the
[54:18] message. I'm in the message and we have
[54:19] to say it this way. Is the message in
[54:21] you because being in the message does
[54:24] nothing except for cause a bunch of
[54:26] legalistic
[54:27] people. But when you actually get in
[54:30] around this message of the hour and you
[54:33] realize that there is a true baptism of
[54:35] the Holy Ghost, then you get Christ
[54:37] inside of you because you get baptized
[54:40] not in titles in the name of the Lord
[54:42] Jesus Christ, which is the correct
[54:44] formula for water baptism. So, if you
[54:46] get baptized outside of the correct
[54:48] formula for water baptism, how could you
[54:50] truly receive the baptism of the Holy
[54:52] Ghost? If if it's contrary to the word
[54:54] of God, how could that ever happen? I I
[54:57] don't think it's possible
[55:00] myself. I'm going to read this paragraph
[55:02] again. Now, watch this doctrine of BA
[55:04] most carefully. Notice above all that it
[55:06] is the deliberate maneuver of a corrupt
[55:08] clergy to bind the people to them by
[55:11] leading the people deliberately into the
[55:13] sin of unbelief. The nicicoatan doctrine
[55:16] was to corrupt the corruption of the
[55:18] clergy as they sought political power
[55:20] amongst themselves. While balamism is
[55:23] the subjection of the people to their
[55:25] system of creed and worship in order to
[55:28] hold them. You don't have one without
[55:30] the other. That's what the prophet said
[55:32] in this book. Now watch this carefully.
[55:34] What was it that bound the people to the
[55:37] nominal church and thereby destroyed
[55:40] them? It was the creeds and dogmas
[55:43] formed into church
[55:46] tenants. It was the doctrine of the
[55:49] Roman Catholic
[55:51] Church. Now, going back to what I said
[55:54] earlier, if you look at churches, and I
[55:57] I I'm not saying it to be critical. What
[55:59] I'm saying is to be aware, understand
[56:02] this isn't something that's just made
[56:04] up. This is very real. If you look at
[56:08] denominational churches, they'll be
[56:11] non-denominational. And if you look at
[56:12] what they believe, they'll have the
[56:15] Apostles Creed in there. Amen.
[56:19] Why is that there?
[56:21] Where did that come from? You could do a
[56:24] little research, but what it does is it
[56:25] ties it right back to the Holy Roman
[56:27] Catholic Church.
[56:31] It was the doctrine of the Roman
[56:33] Catholic Church. They were not given the
[56:35] true food, the word. They were given the
[56:38] food that came from idol
[56:41] worship. It's it's really strong and and
[56:43] and really hard to be talking like this
[56:45] because people would say, "Well, they're
[56:47] talking about Jesus Christ." And sure
[56:48] enough, they are. They say his name,
[56:50] don't they? And they talk about the
[56:52] blood of Jesus Christ. And sure enough,
[56:54] they do. But they also talk about Mary,
[56:57] the mother, and esteem her to be greater
[57:00] than Jesus.
[57:01] And and we know there's a whole bunch
[57:03] that goes along with it. But I just love
[57:06] the correction here. They were given the
[57:07] food that came from idol worship. You
[57:09] can't worship Mary and think that you're
[57:11] going to see results. It's not going to
[57:13] happen. Babylonian paganism wrapped up
[57:17] in Christian terminology. And that very
[57:20] same spirit and doctrine is right
[57:22] amongst all Protestants. And it's called
[57:27] denomination.
[57:29] That's why I say even if they say
[57:31] they're non-denominational
[57:33] churches, I I I don't know. I've looked.
[57:35] I I've I scratch my head at this and
[57:38] think, am I making this up? Am I crazy?
[57:40] But it's
[57:43] there. Revelations 18:4, "Come out of
[57:46] her, my people, lest you be partakers of
[57:47] her sins, and that you receive not of
[57:50] her plagues."
[57:54] Nicoleism is
[57:55] organizing humanizing the leadership of
[57:59] the church and
[58:01] thereby deposing the
[58:04] spirit. Remember, as soon as you start
[58:06] to get the leadership of man in a
[58:08] church, the Holy Ghost takes his flight.
[58:12] You no longer have the Holy Ghost
[58:13] leadership of the church when government
[58:16] starts to form and run the church.
[58:21] You see, they are
[58:23] ignorant. But this is where this is
[58:26] where, like we just said, you know, the
[58:30] denominations, the people who claim
[58:32] Christianity but aren't interested at
[58:34] all in hearing that God sent a prophet,
[58:36] they don't
[58:37] give two hoots if you say to them was a
[58:41] prophetic utterance in in the generation
[58:43] in which we live. They're not at all
[58:45] interested to hear anything that he had
[58:47] to say. They're going to be held by the
[58:51] same measure by calling themselves
[58:53] Christians. And I think it's so
[58:56] important to actually call it out. He
[58:59] says here, you see, they are ignorant.
[59:01] But if the rapture should take place at
[59:03] this moment, ignorance would be no court
[59:06] of appeal from the judgment of God for
[59:08] being in the wrong
[59:11] ranks. For the clergy to organize
[59:14] themselves with one rank over another
[59:17] until they are finally headed up by a
[59:19] president is a manifestation of the
[59:22] Antichrist
[59:24] spirit, regardless of how wonderful and
[59:28] necessary it may
[59:30] seem. This is really hard because
[59:34] churches function exactly this way.
[59:40] It's nothing but human reasoning taking
[59:42] the place of the word. And any person
[59:45] who is in the organized denominations is
[59:49] right in the midst of an antichrist
[59:54] system. Now let me say this and make it
[59:58] very
[59:59] plain. I love how he does this. Capital
[1:00:02] letters. Capital letters. I am not
[1:00:07] against the people.
[1:00:09] I
[1:00:11] am. Do you see a a signature in that
[1:00:15] sentence? I am
[1:00:19] against the system.
[1:00:24] With the state and church union, the
[1:00:26] stage has been set for the dark ages.
[1:00:29] And indeed for about a thousand years
[1:00:32] the church went into the depth of
[1:00:34] blackness knowing the depths of
[1:00:38] Satan. When any religious people embrace
[1:00:41] both
[1:00:42] nickelatanism and
[1:00:44] balamism they have the political,
[1:00:47] financial and physical power to back it
[1:00:50] up there. So so there there is only one
[1:00:55] direction they can
[1:00:56] go. That direction is right into the
[1:01:00] Jezebel
[1:01:02] doctrine. Now, why do we say
[1:01:05] this? Because, excuse me, as we pointed
[1:01:09] out in the study of the fourth age,
[1:01:12] Jezebel was a Sidonian, the daughter of
[1:01:17] Ethbel, who was the king priest to
[1:01:20] Estarte. He was a murderer.
[1:01:24] This woman married Ahab, king of
[1:01:28] Israel, for political
[1:01:31] expediency. She then took over the
[1:01:34] religion of the people, murdered the
[1:01:37] Levites, and erected temples wherein she
[1:01:40] caused the people to worship Estarte,
[1:01:43] Venus, and Baal, the sun
[1:01:46] god. She formulated the teaching and
[1:01:50] made her priests teach it.
[1:01:53] and they in turn made the people accept
[1:01:56] it. There you can see exactly what the
[1:02:00] nominal church was in the dark ages. And
[1:02:03] is it any wonder that Paul, the first
[1:02:06] church age messenger, would come around
[1:02:09] and he would set the church in order as
[1:02:11] he was supposed to do, set the
[1:02:13] foundation, set the pattern for all the
[1:02:15] future church ages. And and he would say
[1:02:17] one thing that's really caused a stir in
[1:02:19] the world today. I mean, it's hotly
[1:02:21] contested because everyone's doing it,
[1:02:24] so it must be okay, right? And that is
[1:02:28] that a woman should usurp authority over
[1:02:31] a man. Paul setting the example for all
[1:02:35] the future church ages said that a woman
[1:02:37] ought not to usurp authority over a man,
[1:02:40] that she should set in silence in the
[1:02:42] church. Meaning, you shouldn't have
[1:02:44] women preachers. But yet here you have
[1:02:46] the Jezebel religion is to have the
[1:02:49] woman behind the man running
[1:02:53] everything. That is the Jezebel
[1:02:57] religion. They left the word of God
[1:02:59] entirely except for names and titles of
[1:03:02] Godhead and a few scriptural
[1:03:05] principles. They twisted what they did
[1:03:08] take out of the Bible by changing its
[1:03:11] meaning. It's okay for a woman to
[1:03:13] preach. What's wrong with it?
[1:03:15] And it goes even further to I mean say
[1:03:18] the LGBTQ could get in behind the pulpit
[1:03:20] and even have females that are in that
[1:03:22] that rank that category. Like I mean
[1:03:26] take some things out of the Bible and
[1:03:28] just make them suit you and and fit you.
[1:03:30] And hey, if everyone agrees to it, then
[1:03:33] it's got to be okay because everyone's
[1:03:34] doing it right.
[1:03:38] They twisted what they did take out of
[1:03:40] the Bible by changing its meaning.
[1:03:43] The college of bishops wrote vast
[1:03:46] treaties said it's okay for women to
[1:03:48] preach. It's okay. Their popes declared
[1:03:51] themselves infallible and said they
[1:03:54] received revelation from God and spoke
[1:03:57] as God to the people. All this was
[1:04:00] taught to the priests who through fear
[1:04:03] made the people believe it. To dissent
[1:04:06] was death or
[1:04:08] excommunication which might be worse
[1:04:10] than death.
[1:04:13] It was now the church with the assured
[1:04:16] voice that took over. And wild with
[1:04:19] power, they drank the blood of martyrs
[1:04:21] until the true Christians were all but
[1:04:23] exterminated. And there was hardly any
[1:04:26] word left and little manifestation of
[1:04:29] the Holy
[1:04:31] Ghost. But the true vine struggled and
[1:04:35] survived. God was faithful to the little
[1:04:38] flock. And in spite of what Rome might
[1:04:42] do to their bodies, Rome could not kill
[1:04:45] the spirit within them.
[1:04:48] And the light of the truth shone on,
[1:04:51] backed by the Holy Ghost and power.
[1:04:53] Remember, he's the same yesterday,
[1:04:54] today, and forever.
[1:04:57] This is a good place to make an
[1:04:58] illuminating observation. Look, the
[1:05:02] deeds and doctrines of the
[1:05:05] nickelatans, the doctrine of Balum, and
[1:05:08] the teaching of the false prophetess
[1:05:12] Jezebel do not constitute three spirits
[1:05:15] or make three spiritual
[1:05:18] principles. These three are but the
[1:05:22] various manifestations of the same
[1:05:24] spirit as it goes from depth to depth.
[1:05:29] And isn't it beautiful how he clarifies
[1:05:31] that it's the same as the horse riders
[1:05:33] in the book of
[1:05:35] Revelation. The white horse, the red
[1:05:37] horse, the black horse, the pale horse,
[1:05:39] they're all the same spirit. And it is
[1:05:42] not Jesus
[1:05:44] Christ. What it all is is the antichrist
[1:05:48] spirit of organization in its three
[1:05:51] various stages.
[1:05:54] My once the clergy separated themselves
[1:05:57] and organized themselves, they oppressed
[1:06:00] the people by leading them into and
[1:06:02] binding them to organization. Also, this
[1:06:06] organization was based upon the creeds
[1:06:09] and dogma which they taught the people
[1:06:12] instead of the pure word of God. Ritual
[1:06:17] and ceremony was given an increasing
[1:06:20] part in worship. And soon this whole
[1:06:24] system was a militant and diabolical
[1:06:27] power that did its best to control all
[1:06:31] through the persuasion of discourse or
[1:06:35] literal
[1:06:36] force. It received its energy from its
[1:06:40] own false prophecies and not the word of
[1:06:44] God.
[1:06:46] It was now absolutely
[1:06:48] Antichrist, though it came in Christ's
[1:06:51] name. So close that it would deceive the
[1:06:54] elected if it were
[1:06:57] possible. After what seemed an
[1:07:01] inminable time wherein truth must surely
[1:07:06] die, men began to protest the vileeness
[1:07:09] of the Roman Catholic Church. Because by
[1:07:12] no stretch of the imagination could God
[1:07:15] be in such teaching and such conduct.
[1:07:19] These Protestants were either
[1:07:22] disregarded and died from failure to
[1:07:25] arouse attention or were quashed by
[1:07:29] Rome.
[1:07:31] But then God in his sovereign grace sent
[1:07:34] a messenger by the name of Martin Luther
[1:07:38] to start a reformation.
[1:07:41] He worked in a climate where the Roman
[1:07:43] Catholic Church had been given so much
[1:07:46] rope that she was about to hang
[1:07:50] herself. So when Luther preached
[1:07:52] justification by faith, the true vine
[1:07:56] for the first time in many centuries
[1:07:59] began to grow in a bountiful manner.
[1:08:03] I was thinking about that, you know,
[1:08:04] what would it have been like to be
[1:08:07] around in those days with Martin Luther
[1:08:11] and and the the reformation of the
[1:08:13] church to hear about him coming against
[1:08:17] the elders of the church by by putting
[1:08:20] his thesis on the door and and making
[1:08:22] his own stand, making the declaration
[1:08:25] that, you know, the the the true
[1:08:28] believers, they're able to live by
[1:08:30] faith. justification by faith, not
[1:08:33] because of a priest or a an
[1:08:36] archbishop. What would it have been like
[1:08:38] to be around in that
[1:08:40] day? As the nominal church had used
[1:08:44] state power to back it up, now state
[1:08:46] power began to flow against it. And this
[1:08:50] is where Luther made his
[1:08:53] mistake. And the true believers made
[1:08:56] their mistake.
[1:08:58] They allowed the state to subsidize
[1:09:01] them. Amen. A little bit of money goes a
[1:09:05] long ways with
[1:09:07] people, but not with the spirit of God.
[1:09:11] They allowed the state to subsidize
[1:09:13] them. So this age did not launch out
[1:09:17] very far on the word. Thank God that it
[1:09:20] did not go as far as it did that it did
[1:09:23] go as far as it did, sorry. But because
[1:09:25] it leaned on political power to a great
[1:09:28] extent, this age ended in organization.
[1:09:32] And this very group that in Luther's
[1:09:34] generation had broken from the false
[1:09:37] vine now turned back to become a
[1:09:41] daughter of the harlot. For she went
[1:09:44] right into
[1:09:46] nicicoatinism and
[1:09:49] balamism. I think this is a theme that
[1:09:51] we're probably going to wind up looking
[1:09:52] at. Nicicoatanism and balamism. It is a
[1:09:56] powerful thing and it's what caused the
[1:09:58] church ages to go
[1:10:00] ary. He goes on to say this era had
[1:10:03] scores of factions within it and to
[1:10:06] prove how far they were from true seed
[1:10:10] is to merely read history and see how
[1:10:12] they persecuted each other even unto
[1:10:15] death in some
[1:10:17] cases. But there were a few names
[1:10:21] amongst them. Amen.
[1:10:24] Even as there always are in every
[1:10:28] age, we rejoice in this age for this one
[1:10:32] thing. Reformation had started. It was
[1:10:35] not a resurrection, but a reformation.
[1:10:39] Neither was it a restoration.
[1:10:43] But the corn of wheat that had died at
[1:10:45] at Nya and had rotted in the dark ages
[1:10:50] now sent up a chute of truth
[1:10:53] signifying that at some future date. I
[1:10:57] love this. At the end of the Leodysian
[1:11:00] age, just before Jesus came, the church
[1:11:04] would go back to being a wheat seed
[1:11:07] bride again, while the tears would be
[1:11:10] harvested and burned in the lake of
[1:11:13] fire.
[1:11:16] Since the fifth age had brought a great
[1:11:19] dissemination of the word through
[1:11:22] printing, the sixth age was quick to
[1:11:24] take advantage of it.
[1:11:27] This age was the second stage of the
[1:11:31] restoration and as we have stated
[1:11:34] previously was the tassel age. Education
[1:11:39] abounded. This was the age of the
[1:11:42] intellectual men who loved God and
[1:11:45] served him. Missionaries abounded and
[1:11:49] the word spread over the world. It was
[1:11:52] an age of brotherly love. It was an age
[1:11:57] of the open
[1:11:59] door. It was the last age of long
[1:12:03] duration and after it the Leodysian age
[1:12:06] would come which would be a short
[1:12:10] one. The true vine flourished in this
[1:12:13] age as in no other when one thinks of
[1:12:17] numbers at home and
[1:12:19] abroad. This age brought holy men to the
[1:12:23] forefront.
[1:12:25] The true vine spread and the false vine
[1:12:29] receded. Everywhere the true vine went,
[1:12:32] God gave light and life and
[1:12:37] happiness. The false vine was shown up
[1:12:39] for what it was. Darkness, misery,
[1:12:43] poverty,
[1:12:45] illiteracy, and death.
[1:12:48] And as the false vine in its day of
[1:12:51] power could not kill the true
[1:12:54] vine, neither could the true vine now
[1:12:57] bring back the false vine to Jesus
[1:13:00] Christ.
[1:13:03] But the false vine entrenched itself
[1:13:06] waiting for the last part of the last
[1:13:09] age when it would win back win all back
[1:13:13] to itself except that small flock that
[1:13:17] were the elect true vine of God.
[1:13:22] But how sad does this age make us feel
[1:13:25] as we realize that every great move of
[1:13:29] God and there were
[1:13:31] many neglected to throw off the nickelan
[1:13:36] doctrine for they all organized and
[1:13:40] died. Then they moved into
[1:13:44] denominations to hold the spiritually
[1:13:47] dead in foodless pastures.
[1:13:51] Little did they know it, but each group
[1:13:54] was tainted with that same
[1:13:56] error. And when the revival fire burned
[1:13:59] low, organization took over and people
[1:14:04] became
[1:14:06] denominations. Brothers and sisters,
[1:14:09] tonight I want to say this. If that
[1:14:12] revival fire is burning low tonight, ask
[1:14:16] the Lord for a revival.
[1:14:20] Brother Brandham says it in the message.
[1:14:22] I don't know where one of them that I
[1:14:24] was listening to. Revival doesn't mean
[1:14:27] something new. Revival means to stir up
[1:14:32] that which we already
[1:14:35] have. It's in 1964. I know the message
[1:14:38] in 1964. But brother Bradam talks about
[1:14:40] being on one of the great lakes and he
[1:14:41] had an experience where while he was
[1:14:43] there he was watching the waves come up
[1:14:45] and the wind blowing the waves and he
[1:14:47] said he just couldn't get over all the
[1:14:48] trash that was up on the shore and he
[1:14:51] said it occurred to him what has to
[1:14:52] happen is there needs to be a stirring
[1:14:54] up and what happens is all the trash
[1:14:56] comes out of the water when the wind
[1:14:58] blows the water when the water gets
[1:15:00] stirred up once in a while I think
[1:15:02] brothers and sisters maybe we need to
[1:15:03] get a little stirred maybe we need to
[1:15:06] revive what's already here what we
[1:15:08] already have not look for something new
[1:15:11] or great. We have the best and that is
[1:15:15] the word of God.
[1:15:22] I shouldn't get preaching. I lose where
[1:15:26] I'm at.
[1:15:29] Boy, oh boy.
[1:15:32] But how sad does this age make us feel
[1:15:34] when we realize that every great move of
[1:15:36] God and there were many neglected to
[1:15:39] throw off the nickelan doctrine for they
[1:15:42] all organized and died. They moved into
[1:15:44] denominations to hold the spiritually
[1:15:47] dead and foodless pastures. Little did
[1:15:49] they know it but each group was tainted
[1:15:52] with that same error. And when the
[1:15:54] revival fire burned low, organization
[1:15:57] took over and people became
[1:15:59] denominations.
[1:16:01] They were only nominal Christians,
[1:16:04] though each group claimed with the very
[1:16:06] same assurance as the Roman Catholic
[1:16:10] Church that they were right and all
[1:16:14] others
[1:16:16] wrong. I've noticed it even in looking
[1:16:18] at different churches, and I'm not
[1:16:20] saying this to throw off. I'm saying it
[1:16:21] to actually say amen to what's be
[1:16:25] written here, what we're reading about.
[1:16:27] And some of the uh some of the the
[1:16:30] apostles creeds that you see on the
[1:16:33] church's websites of what they believe,
[1:16:36] they actually edit it just a little bit
[1:16:37] to say it their way. But why do they
[1:16:40] still have it there? Why is it there?
[1:16:42] It's to link them back to Rome. It takes
[1:16:44] them right back to Rome, whether they
[1:16:46] want to acknowledge that or not. And
[1:16:49] what happens is they wind up saying, and
[1:16:51] I think it's important, too, brothers
[1:16:53] and sisters, we can get there ourselves.
[1:16:55] We can get to the place where we say
[1:16:56] that we are right. All else is wrong.
[1:16:59] You know what? There's a lot of people
[1:17:01] in this world that are going to be in
[1:17:02] heaven. The prophet of God himself said
[1:17:05] that we're going to be surprised that
[1:17:06] day about who is there and who isn't
[1:17:08] there. It's not up to us to put people
[1:17:10] in or out. We need to actually try and
[1:17:12] encourage as many people as we can.
[1:17:16] But, you know, there's people that
[1:17:17] aren't going to go on the rapture, but
[1:17:19] that don't mean they're lost. That's
[1:17:21] right. And we want to do all we can to
[1:17:23] encourage people to Jesus Christ.
[1:17:26] If they can't be elect and go in the
[1:17:28] rapture, don't we want to see them get
[1:17:30] eternal life? Give them an opportunity
[1:17:33] to do something good for the bride of
[1:17:34] Jesus Christ.
[1:17:37] If we're not careful, we could have that
[1:17:39] same spirit in and around us say, "Look
[1:17:42] at me. I'm good. Look what I've done."
[1:17:47] I say, "God, help us.
[1:17:52] We want to encourage as many people as
[1:17:54] we can.
[1:18:00] It can come to the place where they
[1:18:02] believe that they were right and all
[1:18:03] others
[1:18:04] wrong. The stage was truly set for the
[1:18:07] daughters to go back home in the last
[1:18:09] age, back to Rome under the mother hen.
[1:18:13] And you know, people can say, I just
[1:18:15] can't help it, brothers and sisters.
[1:18:16] People can say that they're actually,
[1:18:19] you know, they don't believe in the
[1:18:20] Roman Catholic Church and they don't
[1:18:21] believe in the doctrine and uh whatever
[1:18:24] and whatnot, but if they're still
[1:18:26] fellowshipping with the church that
[1:18:28] already does, they fall under that
[1:18:30] ministry,
[1:18:31] the word of God says to come out from
[1:18:34] among her, my people, and be ye not
[1:18:37] partakers of her plagues. And and that's
[1:18:40] what's happening when you have you have
[1:18:42] the the great harlot and you have all
[1:18:44] the daughters. I think maybe we need to
[1:18:46] get into the book of Revelation a little
[1:18:49] further. It's uh it's amazing to see it,
[1:18:52] to be able to see it is just so
[1:18:53] humbling, isn't it? To recognize that
[1:18:55] it's all grace. It's because God called
[1:18:57] us. He's given us ears to hear and a
[1:18:59] heart to receive it. He's given us a
[1:19:01] seed of election in our hearts before
[1:19:04] the foundation of the world to be able
[1:19:05] to say amen to this word. Without that,
[1:19:07] there's no way that we would ever be
[1:19:08] able to do it. We would either be a
[1:19:11] makebeliever or an unbeliever. We'd be
[1:19:13] one of those two. But to be able to be a
[1:19:15] real believer, that is amazing. It's
[1:19:17] truly
[1:19:19] humbling. Goes on to say, "And so we
[1:19:22] come to the last age, the Leodysian age.
[1:19:25] That is our age. We know it is the last
[1:19:29] age for the Jews are back in Palestine.
[1:19:32] No matter how they got there, they're
[1:19:33] there. And this is harvest time. But
[1:19:37] before there can be a harvest, there has
[1:19:39] to be a ripening, a maturing of both
[1:19:44] vines. I just love what he says here.
[1:19:46] We've got the time. So, we're going to
[1:19:48] we're going to read it. The Leodysian
[1:19:50] age was the springtime. The Wesian age
[1:19:52] was a summer of growth. The Leodysian
[1:19:55] age is the harvest time of gathering of
[1:19:57] the tears for binding and burning and
[1:19:59] garnering the wheat for the
[1:20:01] Lord. Harvest time. Have you noticed
[1:20:04] that in the harvest time though there is
[1:20:07] a real acceleration in the
[1:20:09] ripening there's consequencely
[1:20:11] consequently a slowing of
[1:20:14] growth until there is no
[1:20:17] growth. Is that not exactly what we are
[1:20:21] seeing
[1:20:22] now? The false vine is losing multitudes
[1:20:25] to the
[1:20:26] communists and various other types of
[1:20:28] belief.
[1:20:30] I'm not going to go political, but if
[1:20:32] you just look around, you can see that
[1:20:34] statement is 100% true. 100% true.
[1:20:38] There's political parties. They don't
[1:20:40] call themselves communists, but they
[1:20:42] have the same belief structure as the
[1:20:44] communist parties. Communism. Everyone
[1:20:47] should just be looked after. Not
[1:20:49] capitalism, but communism. And I'm not
[1:20:51] voting one way or the other. I'm just
[1:20:53] saying what the prophet said here in
[1:20:55] 1965 is very prevalent today.
[1:20:59] It is
[1:21:01] amazing.
[1:21:04] Boy, the false vine is losing multitudes
[1:21:07] to the communists and various other
[1:21:08] types of belief. Her numbers are not
[1:21:11] increasing as she would like to think.
[1:21:13] Her hold on the people is not what it
[1:21:16] used to be. And in so many cases is
[1:21:19] going is going to church is just a
[1:21:22] show, just something to do. We want to
[1:21:25] make sure that we go to
[1:21:26] church,
[1:21:28] right? And the true vine, what about
[1:21:31] her? Is she
[1:21:32] growing? Where are those vast numbers
[1:21:35] that keep coming to revivals and answer
[1:21:38] altar
[1:21:39] calls? Are not most of them merely
[1:21:43] emotional in their approach or desirous
[1:21:46] of something physical rather than
[1:21:49] desiring that which is spiritual?
[1:21:52] Is this age not like the day in which
[1:21:55] Noah entered the ark and the door was
[1:21:58] shut? But yet God terried in judgment
[1:22:01] seven
[1:22:03] days. No one was literally turned to God
[1:22:07] in those silent days. You know, I think
[1:22:09] we talked a little bit about it on
[1:22:11] Sunday and you know, if they were, would
[1:22:13] they have been able to get on the ark or
[1:22:16] would it have been too late?
[1:22:18] It's amazing to think about how God does
[1:22:20] things. But we know that he shut the
[1:22:23] door and what he shuts, no man is going
[1:22:26] to open. That's what the word says.
[1:22:30] My my
[1:22:34] my. And yet it is the harvest time. Then
[1:22:39] there must come upon the scene in this
[1:22:42] age those who will bring the wheat and
[1:22:45] tears to maturity.
[1:22:48] The tears are already maturing very fast
[1:22:53] under corrupt teachers who turn the
[1:22:55] people from the word. Remember, one word
[1:22:58] off is turning from the
[1:23:01] word. But the wheat also must mature.
[1:23:05] Amen. And to her God is sending the
[1:23:08] prophet messenger with the vindicated
[1:23:12] ministry that he might be accepted by
[1:23:15] the elect.
[1:23:17] They will hear him as the first church
[1:23:20] heard
[1:23:21] Paul. And she will mature in the word
[1:23:24] until becoming a word bride. The mighty
[1:23:29] works will be found in her that are
[1:23:31] always attendant upon the pure word and
[1:23:35] faith. The false church groups will come
[1:23:39] together in a world council of churches.
[1:23:43] This world council of churches is the
[1:23:46] image erected to the
[1:23:49] beast. Revelations 13 11
[1:23:53] to18. And I beheld another beast coming
[1:23:57] up out of the earth and he had two horns
[1:24:00] like a lamb and spake as a
[1:24:03] dragon. I just have to say this.
[1:24:05] Revelations 13 is the United States of
[1:24:09] America.
[1:24:11] And I beheld another beast coming up out
[1:24:13] of the earth, and had two horns like a
[1:24:15] lamb, and spake as a dragon. And he
[1:24:18] exercisth all the power of the first
[1:24:20] beast before him, and caus the earth,
[1:24:24] and them which dwell therein to worship
[1:24:26] the first beast, whose deadly wound was
[1:24:30] healed, Rome.
[1:24:34] and he doeth great wonders, so that he
[1:24:36] maketh fire come down from heaven on the
[1:24:38] earth in the sight of men. Many times, I
[1:24:41] always thought my entire life that one
[1:24:43] day we would see this mighty man raise
[1:24:45] his hand to heaven as the antichrist
[1:24:48] spirit and call fire down from heaven.
[1:24:50] But you know what the prophet, the
[1:24:51] vindicated prophet in our day said? This
[1:24:54] was fulfilled.
[1:24:56] Amen. with
[1:24:57] Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[1:25:00] This mystery is
[1:25:03] history. Don't look for some man. It's
[1:25:05] already happened.
[1:25:07] And he doeth great wonders, so that he
[1:25:10] maketh fire come down from heaven on the
[1:25:13] earth in the sight of men. And deceiveth
[1:25:16] them that dwell on the earth by means of
[1:25:18] those miracles which he had power to do
[1:25:21] in the sight of the
[1:25:22] beast. Since that happened, who has
[1:25:25] dared to poke the United States of
[1:25:29] America? No government anywhere around
[1:25:32] the world has come against the
[1:25:35] USA. Not one. There's a lot of bantering
[1:25:39] and saber rattling is what they call,
[1:25:41] but nobody has dared actually launch an
[1:25:44] attack. And we know that day is coming.
[1:25:46] I'm not saying it won't happen, but I
[1:25:48] think it's interesting in light of this
[1:25:49] scripture.
[1:25:51] He deceived everyone that dwell on the
[1:25:53] earth by the means of those miracles
[1:25:54] which he had power to do in the sight of
[1:25:56] the beast, saying to them that dwell on
[1:25:58] the earth, that they should make an
[1:26:00] image to the beast, which had the wound
[1:26:03] by the sword, and did live. Rome and he
[1:26:07] had the power to give life unto the
[1:26:09] image of the beast, that the image of
[1:26:11] the beast should both speak and cause as
[1:26:15] many as would not worship the image of
[1:26:17] the beast should be killed. Remember
[1:26:20] this is the World Council of Churches.
[1:26:23] And he caus all both small and great,
[1:26:27] rich and poor, free and bond, to receive
[1:26:30] a mark in their right hand or in their
[1:26:34] foreheads. And you know, many times
[1:26:37] people have said the mark of the beast,
[1:26:39] we're looking for it. It's coming. And
[1:26:41] maybe it's going to be RFIDs and who
[1:26:43] knows what it will be. Maybe it'll be a
[1:26:45] tattoo. Could be anything. Some people
[1:26:48] say a vaccine. Some people say some sort
[1:26:51] of a virus. All these different things
[1:26:53] and theories and conspiracies floating
[1:26:55] around. There's never been a time of so
[1:26:57] much information and disinformation in
[1:27:00] the world as where we are are today as
[1:27:02] far as we can tell. We know that there
[1:27:04] was greater civilizations on Earth prior
[1:27:07] to us being here. But here we have this
[1:27:10] idea about the mark of the beast coming
[1:27:12] on the scene. And one day truly it will
[1:27:14] be a physical mark of the beast. But we
[1:27:16] had a vindicated prophet. Once again,
[1:27:18] there's so much packed into this
[1:27:19] scripture here. He said the mark of the
[1:27:21] beast is a spiritual mark. Don't look
[1:27:23] for a physical mark. If we're the truly
[1:27:26] elected bride of Jesus Christ, we will
[1:27:28] not be here when that true physical mark
[1:27:31] happens on the earth. When that level of
[1:27:33] squeeze comes upon all of the peoples in
[1:27:35] every single nation,
[1:27:37] the mark on the back of the hand is the
[1:27:40] action. In the right hand is the hand of
[1:27:42] power. The mark in the forehead is the
[1:27:45] thoughts that actually control the hand
[1:27:48] to do the the deed whatever it is to
[1:27:51] cause the action to happen. We know the
[1:27:53] brain controls everything. That is the
[1:27:55] mark of the beast. The spiritual mark of
[1:27:57] the beast to continually have evil
[1:28:00] thoughts in the mind and then act upon
[1:28:02] them with the hands. That is what we're
[1:28:05] talking about in the day in which we
[1:28:07] live. Even though one day there will be
[1:28:09] a a physical mark. Brothers and sisters,
[1:28:11] I just want to say it. Don't look for
[1:28:13] something else. The prophet said these
[1:28:14] words. This is actually what he said.
[1:28:17] I'm not making this up here. And no man
[1:28:20] might buy or sell save he that have the
[1:28:23] mark or the name of the beast or the
[1:28:26] number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let
[1:28:29] him that hath understanding count the
[1:28:31] number of the beast. For it is a the
[1:28:34] number of a man and his number is 63
[1:28:38] score and
[1:28:40] six. And it's interesting for those
[1:28:43] people that don't know it. I I just want
[1:28:44] to say it. There is a rock and roll band
[1:28:47] that actually says this exact scripture
[1:28:50] at the very beginning of one of the
[1:28:52] songs. And uh I'll just say the title of
[1:28:55] the song, and I'm not trying to promote
[1:28:57] it, but what I am saying is there's
[1:28:58] people in this world that are very aware
[1:29:00] of it. And the name of the song is Run
[1:29:02] to the Hills.
[1:29:05] Don't don't don't stick around because
[1:29:07] there's going to be there's going to be
[1:29:09] a judgment that strikes this earth and
[1:29:12] even the sinners know it.
[1:29:15] Which kind of surprises
[1:29:17] me, but here we are. He says, "Now
[1:29:20] remember it was Imperial Pagan in Rome
[1:29:23] that fell by the sword, but she was
[1:29:27] healed of her death stroke when she
[1:29:30] joined to the nominal Christian church
[1:29:32] of Rome and incorporated paganism and
[1:29:38] Christianity and created a hybrid
[1:29:41] religion and thereby became the Holy
[1:29:44] Roman
[1:29:46] Empire which was to endure
[1:29:49] until Jesus came and destroyed her. But
[1:29:52] Rome is not going it alone. Her
[1:29:55] daughters are right with her and she
[1:29:58] will take over absolute authority by the
[1:30:01] World Council of
[1:30:03] Churches. And remember talking about
[1:30:05] this World Council of Churches, we we we
[1:30:08] talked about it in the past. There was
[1:30:10] actually uh what was his name? Tony
[1:30:14] Palmer. Anthony Palmer went to the
[1:30:16] United States of America on behalf of
[1:30:18] Rome on behalf of his pope and he was a
[1:30:21] a cardinal I believe or a bishop and and
[1:30:24] he said the protest of Luther is over.
[1:30:27] So if that's over, if we have already
[1:30:29] signed the the proclamation, then what's
[1:30:32] your protest? We're all together now.
[1:30:35] And whether they actually agree upon it
[1:30:37] or not, it's too late. It's already
[1:30:40] happened. And this is years ago. This is
[1:30:43] 15 years ago, I think. So, where do we
[1:30:46] stand tonight? My, this may seem
[1:30:50] far-fetched to some, but actually it's
[1:30:53] very plain for all to see because right
[1:30:55] now the churches are controlling
[1:30:59] politics and at the opportune time will
[1:31:02] manifest exactly how great is that
[1:31:05] control. This ecumenical move will end
[1:31:08] up with Rome at the head. Even though
[1:31:12] the people did not envision it that way.
[1:31:15] Isn't that
[1:31:16] amazing? This is so because in
[1:31:19] Revelation 17 3-6 it states that the
[1:31:22] mystery Babylon is seated on the
[1:31:27] beast. She's controlling the last or
[1:31:30] fourth empire. This Roman church is
[1:31:33] doing that with the world church system
[1:31:36] under her. Rome will be controlling and
[1:31:40] this image church system will be
[1:31:42] obedient to Rome because Rome controls
[1:31:46] the gold of the
[1:31:48] world. Thus all the people have to
[1:31:51] belong to the world church system or be
[1:31:55] at the mercy of the elements for they
[1:31:57] cannot buy or sell without the mark of
[1:32:00] the beast in the hand or the head.
[1:32:03] This mark in the head means that they
[1:32:07] will have to take the doctrine of the
[1:32:09] world church system which is
[1:32:12] trinitarianism
[1:32:14] etc. and the mark in the hand which
[1:32:17] means to do the will of the world
[1:32:22] church. My it's later than we think.
[1:32:26] Amen.
[1:32:28] With this great power, the church
[1:32:30] systems will persecute the true
[1:32:33] bride. This image will try to keep the
[1:32:36] bride from preaching and teaching
[1:32:39] etc. Her ministers will be forbidden to
[1:32:43] give comfort and truth to the people who
[1:32:46] need it.
[1:32:47] But before the
[1:32:49] antichrist in person takes over this
[1:32:52] complete world system of churches, the
[1:32:56] true church will be taken away from this
[1:32:58] world to be with the Lord.
[1:33:02] God will catch away his bride for the
[1:33:06] great marriage supper of the lamb. Amen.
[1:33:11] Now as this concluding chapter is given
[1:33:14] in order to trace the two churches and
[1:33:18] two spirits from Pentecost to their
[1:33:21] consummation. We will take this final
[1:33:24] time to show this in the Leodysian age.
[1:33:29] This age
[1:33:31] started just after the turn of the 20th
[1:33:35] century as it was to be the age in which
[1:33:38] the true church would return to being
[1:33:42] the bride she was at
[1:33:44] Pentecost. We know there must be of
[1:33:47] necessity a return of dynamic power.
[1:33:51] The believers sensed this in their
[1:33:54] spirits and began crying to God for a
[1:33:57] new outpouring such as was in the first
[1:34:01] century. What seemed to be the answer
[1:34:04] came as many began to speak in tongues
[1:34:06] and manifest gifts of the
[1:34:09] spirit. It was then believed that this
[1:34:12] was indeed the longawwaited
[1:34:15] restoration. My truly was believed. I
[1:34:20] grew up believing that it was not for
[1:34:24] the latter rain can come only after the
[1:34:27] former rain which is in the spring or
[1:34:31] teaching
[1:34:32] rain. The latter rain then is the
[1:34:35] harvest
[1:34:37] rain. How could this be the real thing
[1:34:39] when the teaching rain had not
[1:34:44] come? The prophet messenger who was to
[1:34:48] be sent to teach the people and turn the
[1:34:51] hearts of the children back to the
[1:34:52] Pentecostal fathers had not yet come. We
[1:34:57] know that
[1:34:58] Isuza happened before brother Brandham
[1:35:00] came on the scene in his ministry. And
[1:35:03] uh that's just the way it is. That's
[1:35:04] exactly what he's talking about
[1:35:08] here. But I think it's beautiful because
[1:35:10] brother Brandham he says it in I think
[1:35:12] adoption. Is it adoption? He says that
[1:35:14] preaching saves the sinner, but teaching
[1:35:18] positionally places them.
[1:35:21] And he had to come and positionally
[1:35:23] place the children back to the faith of
[1:35:26] the Pentecostal fathers. That had to
[1:35:29] happen. And that's what he's talking
[1:35:30] about here. Thus, what was thought to be
[1:35:33] the restoration and the final quickening
[1:35:36] unto the rapture had not come.
[1:35:40] And it's so sad to think that so many
[1:35:43] people have been misunderstanding,
[1:35:46] misconstring, making the rapture to have
[1:35:49] a time stamp on it and say that it's
[1:35:51] going to happen a certain way just like
[1:35:53] 1977. The prophet said, "I can't see
[1:35:55] past 1977. I can't see the world going
[1:35:58] on past 1977." What if it was just him
[1:36:02] saying that in in my mind's eye, in my
[1:36:04] heart's eye, in in my visionary
[1:36:07] abilities, I just cannot see this world
[1:36:09] going on beyond 1977. We know I'm
[1:36:13] preaching to the choir here. He simply
[1:36:15] said, I predict, not thus sayaith the
[1:36:18] Lord. How many people went off the rails
[1:36:21] with that 1977
[1:36:25] doctrine thinking that it was actually
[1:36:27] the restoration and the final quickening
[1:36:30] unto the rapture, but it
[1:36:32] wasn't. He goes on to say, "In it was a
[1:36:35] mixture of the unrighteous partaking of
[1:36:38] spiritual blessing and manifesting in
[1:36:41] the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing
[1:36:44] out to you." In it also was devil power
[1:36:47] as men were under the control of devils.
[1:36:50] Yet no one seemed to realize it. Then to
[1:36:53] prove that it was not the real these
[1:36:57] people even before a second gen
[1:36:59] generation had appeared, organized and
[1:37:01] wrote their unscriptural doctrines and
[1:37:03] built their own fences as every other
[1:37:06] group ahead of them
[1:37:08] did. And that's happened right in the
[1:37:11] message. Right in and around the
[1:37:13] message. Remember while Jesus was upon
[1:37:16] the earth so was
[1:37:17] Judas. Each came from a different spirit
[1:37:20] and upon death each went to his own
[1:37:23] place. The spirit of Christ later came
[1:37:25] back upon the true church and the spirit
[1:37:27] of Judas came back upon the false
[1:37:29] church. It is right there in Revelations
[1:37:33] 6:es 1 to8. And I saw when the Lamb
[1:37:37] opened one of the
[1:37:39] seals, and I heard as it were the noise
[1:37:41] of thunder, and one of the four beasts,
[1:37:44] saying, "Come and see." And I saw, and
[1:37:49] behold, a white horse, and he that sat
[1:37:51] on him had a bow, and a crown was given
[1:37:54] unto him, and he went forth conquering,
[1:37:57] and to conquer, but he never had any
[1:37:59] arrows.
[1:38:01] And when he had opened the second seal,
[1:38:03] I heard the second beast say, "Come and
[1:38:05] see." And there went on another horse
[1:38:08] that was read, and power was given to
[1:38:11] him, that he sat thereon to take peace
[1:38:15] from the earth, and that they should
[1:38:17] kill one another. And there was given
[1:38:20] unto him a great sword. And we know that
[1:38:22] millions and millions of people lost
[1:38:25] their lives. That's why it was a red
[1:38:27] horse.
[1:38:28] And when he had opened the third seal, I
[1:38:30] heard the third beast say, "Come and
[1:38:32] see." And I beheld, and lo, a black
[1:38:36] horse. And he that sat on him had a pair
[1:38:39] of balances in his hand. And I heard a
[1:38:42] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[1:38:44] say, "A measure of wheat for a penny,
[1:38:47] and three measures of barley for a
[1:38:49] penny, and see thou hurt not the oil and
[1:38:53] the wine."
[1:38:55] And we know that that's where people
[1:38:57] started to pay the church to live, pay
[1:39:01] the church to survive, pay the church to
[1:39:04] get life seemingly not understanding
[1:39:07] that they're actually getting death
[1:39:09] through the church. But that last
[1:39:10] sentence in that scripture is really
[1:39:13] significant. But see thou hurt not the
[1:39:16] Holy Ghost and the stimulation of the
[1:39:18] revelation that comes along with that.
[1:39:20] You can touch everyone else. Go ahead
[1:39:23] and mess with the false church, but you
[1:39:24] cannot touch the elect.
[1:39:28] And when he had opened the fourth seal,
[1:39:29] I heard a voice of the fourth beast say,
[1:39:33] "Come and see." And I looked, and
[1:39:35] behold, a pale horse, and the name that
[1:39:38] sat on him was death, and hell followed
[1:39:40] with him, and power was given unto them
[1:39:44] over the fourth part of the earth to
[1:39:47] kill with the sword, and with hunger,
[1:39:49] and with death, and with the beasts of
[1:39:52] the earth. And you know, the vindicated
[1:39:54] prophet in our day, he said, the reason
[1:39:56] that horse was a pale horse, it wasn't
[1:39:58] any color. It was a combination of the
[1:40:01] white and the red and the black. All of
[1:40:06] them manifesting all of their nasty
[1:40:09] works because it's the same spirit in
[1:40:12] different forms now completely together
[1:40:15] in one horse in one anointing. He says,
[1:40:19] "See how that Judas spirit came back as
[1:40:23] a rider on a white horse. It was white.
[1:40:26] so close to the real just as Judas was
[1:40:29] so close to Jesus. A crown was given to
[1:40:32] him, white horse rider. How that spirit
[1:40:36] was now in the leader of the nickelan
[1:40:39] system and he was a triple crown pope
[1:40:43] who sat as god in his
[1:40:45] temple calling himself the vicer of
[1:40:48] Christ. If vicor of Christ means uh
[1:40:52] sorry if vicor of Christ means instead
[1:40:55] of Christ or in place of or on behalf of
[1:40:58] God then the pope was calling himself
[1:41:01] the Holy
[1:41:02] Ghost or deposing the Holy Ghost acting
[1:41:06] for him. That's pretty powerful.
[1:41:11] That was the Judas spirit in him doing
[1:41:14] that.
[1:41:16] See how he conquered going forth
[1:41:18] conquering and to
[1:41:20] conquer. Christ did not do that. The
[1:41:23] only ones that came to him were already
[1:41:27] predestinated by the
[1:41:29] father. And so on. I'll call the
[1:41:32] musicians. And so on and on went the
[1:41:36] spirit. And one day it will become truly
[1:41:40] incarnate in a man who will head up the
[1:41:43] world council of churches just as we
[1:41:47] have been
[1:41:48] saying. And by his
[1:41:50] gold remember that Judas held the bag.
[1:41:54] He will control the whole world and that
[1:41:58] antichrist system will own
[1:42:01] everything
[1:42:03] my and try to control
[1:42:06] everybody. But Jesus will come back and
[1:42:10] destroy them all with the brightness of
[1:42:12] his coming and their end will be the
[1:42:16] lake of
[1:42:17] fire. But what about the true seed?
[1:42:21] It will happen just as we have
[1:42:24] said. The people of God are being made
[1:42:27] ready by the word of truth from the
[1:42:30] messenger to this age.
[1:42:33] In her will be the fullness of
[1:42:36] Pentecost. For the spirit will bring the
[1:42:39] people right back to where they were at
[1:42:42] the beginning. That is thus saith the
[1:42:45] Lord. It is thus saith the Lord. For
[1:42:49] that is what Joel
[1:42:52] 2:23-26 says. And we'll pick that up
[1:42:55] next week, Lord willing. If you'll stand
[1:42:58] with me, can we sing that song? Because
[1:43:01] He lives. Because He lives, I can face
[1:43:05] tomorrow.
[1:43:13] Because he
[1:43:19] lives, I can
[1:43:21] face
[1:43:26] tomorrow
[1:43:28] because he lives.
[1:43:34] All fear is
[1:43:40] gone
[1:43:42] because I
[1:43:47] know he holds my future.
[1:43:55] And life is worth the
[1:44:00] living just
[1:44:03] because he
[1:44:08] lives. God sent his
[1:44:14] son. They called him Jesus.
[1:44:22] He came to
[1:44:28] love. He land for you.

[1:45:30] gone. Cuz I
[1:45:35] [Music]

[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:43] future and life is worth the
[1:45:49] living just
[1:45:52] because he lives.
[1:45:58] And then one
[1:46:04] day I'll cross that
[1:46:10] river. I'll fight life's
[1:46:17] fire.
[1:46:19] No with
[1:46:21] pain is for that character.

[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:04] you
[1:47:06] because
[1:47:11] he all fear is gone.
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:19] Because I
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:24] know he holds my
[1:47:31] future and life is worth the

[1:47:45] Amen. Let's just bow in
[1:47:48] prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord
[1:47:50] Jesus, we thank you for another
[1:47:53] opportunity to gather together in your
[1:47:55] name. Thank you for your word,
[1:47:58] Lord, the anointed word for the age in
[1:48:01] which we live. Father, we're so thankful
[1:48:04] for the final words we read tonight
[1:48:07] where you said that there's coming a
[1:48:10] time where that bride will return to the
[1:48:12] the wheat bride, the manifestation of
[1:48:16] your very life all the way back to the
[1:48:18] original seed. And we know that you said
[1:48:21] through your prophet that is thus
[1:48:23] sayaeth the Lord. And we know that's the
[1:48:25] age in which we live, Father. We don't
[1:48:27] want to make it any more or any less. We
[1:48:30] just want to say amen to the word that
[1:48:31] you've given us, Lord. We can't explain
[1:48:34] it. We can't even understand it, but we
[1:48:36] believe it, Father. We accept it the way
[1:48:38] that you've given it. We are truly
[1:48:42] impressed with the word that you have
[1:48:44] given to us, Father, in the day in which
[1:48:46] we live. Lord, we pray that you would
[1:48:49] just go with each one of us as we go our
[1:48:51] separate ways tonight. Father, watch
[1:48:53] over the families with children. Be with
[1:48:55] those who are ill tonight, Lord. those
[1:48:58] who are working tonight, those maybe who
[1:49:00] are indifferent and just not here,
[1:49:03] wherever they are, Father, we pray that
[1:49:05] you would just be with them, that you
[1:49:06] would strengthen them and encourage them
[1:49:08] and just give them a spring in their
[1:49:10] step and a song in their heart, Father.
[1:49:12] And Lord, if it be your will for us to
[1:49:14] gather again on Sunday, we will bring
[1:49:17] our sacrifice of praise unto you once
[1:49:19] again. We love you, Lord, and we thank
[1:49:22] you. We ask all these things in Jesus
[1:49:25] Christ's name we pray.
[1:49:27] Amen. What a day that will
[1:49:31] be when my Jesus I will
[1:49:35] see. There is
[1:49:37] coming a
[1:49:39] day when no
[1:49:42] partachache shall come. No more clouds
[1:49:47] in the
[1:49:49] sky. No more tears to dim the eye.
[1:49:55] All is peace forever more on that happy
[1:50:02] golden
[1:50:04] shore. What a
[1:50:06] day, glorious
[1:50:08] day that will
[1:50:13] be. What a
[1:50:16] day that will
[1:50:18] be when my
[1:50:21] Jesus I shall see.
[1:50:24] When I look upon his
[1:50:28] face, one who saved me by his
[1:50:33] grace. When he takes me by the hand and
[1:50:39] leads me through the promised
[1:50:43] land. What a
[1:50:45] day, glorious
[1:50:48] day that will be.
[1:50:54] There'll be
[1:50:55] no sorrow
[1:50:58] there. No more
[1:51:01] burdens to
[1:51:03] bear, no more
[1:51:05] sickness, no
[1:51:07] pain, no more
[1:51:10] parting over them.
[1:51:13] And
[1:51:15] forever I will
[1:51:17] be with the one who died for
[1:51:22] me. What a
[1:51:25] day. Glorious
[1:51:27] day that will
[1:51:32] be. What a
[1:51:34] day that will
[1:51:37] be. When by
[1:51:39] Jesus I shall see.
[1:51:43] When I look upon his face, the one who
[1:51:49] save me by his
[1:51:52] grace. When he takes me by the hand and
[1:51:58] leads me through the promised
[1:52:02] land, what a
[1:52:04] day, glorious
[1:52:06] day that will
[1:52:10] be. Amen. And can we sing in Christ
[1:52:13] alone as we dismiss tonight? In Christ
[1:52:16] alone will I
[1:52:19] glory. In Christ alone will I
[1:52:24] glory. Though I could pride myself in
[1:52:28] battles
[1:52:31] won. For I've been blessed beyond
[1:52:36] measure. And by his strength alone I
[1:52:42] overcome.
[1:52:44] Hallelujah. I could stop and count
[1:52:49] successes like diamonds in my
[1:52:55] hands. Those trophies could not equal to
[1:53:00] the
[1:53:02] grace by which I stand.
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:08] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. In Christ
[1:53:13] alone, I place my
[1:53:17] trust and I find my glory in the power
[1:53:22] of the cross.
[1:53:26] In every
[1:53:29] victory, let it be
[1:53:32] said of
[1:53:34] me. My source of
[1:53:38] strength, my source of
[1:53:41] hope is Christ
[1:53:44] alone. In Christ
[1:53:47] alone will I
[1:53:49] glory. For only by his grace I am
[1:53:54] redeemed.
[1:53:58] Only his tender
[1:54:01] mercy could reach beyond my weakness to
[1:54:05] my knees.
[1:54:09] And now I seek no greater honor than
[1:54:16] just to know
[1:54:17] [Applause]
[1:54:20] him and to count my gains but losses to
[1:54:25] the
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:30] glor. Thank you Lord Jesus. Blessed be
[1:54:33] your name.
[1:54:35] Christ the
[1:54:38] Lord. I place my
[1:54:41] trust and I find my glory in the power
[1:54:46] of the
[1:54:49] cross. In
[1:54:52] every
[1:54:53] victory, let it be
[1:54:56] said of me.
[1:54:59] My source of
[1:55:01] strength, my source of
[1:55:04] hope is Christ alone. In Christ alone,
[1:55:09] in Christ alone. God bless you tonight.
[1:55:13] I place my
[1:55:16] trust and I
