[0:00] case an action
[0:03] for villains God had thoughts God had
[0:06] feelings
[0:08] but God needed to make it known God
[0:11] needed to bring it
[0:13] into friction
[0:15] and when we Define grace
[0:18] the dictionary says it's unmerited favor
[0:20] Webster says it's unmerited divine
[0:23] assistance given to humans
[0:27] for their sanctification
[0:30] so where today can we find the
[0:33] expression of the grace of God rather
[0:36] than in the bride of Christ
[0:38] and this morning by the grace of God
[0:40] what was laid in my heart is
[0:43] the Holy Spirit wants to draw his bright
[0:46] closer
[0:48] just give her a cuddle and let her know
[0:51] that she's safe
[0:53] that's the intention of this message
[0:55] in my sound
[0:58] like as a message that is telling us
[1:00] that we can do anything but Abraham said
[1:03] as a Christian I can do anything
[1:08] because what is in me as a desire is to
[1:12] do what God wants so I do what I want
[1:16] but this is talking about the grace of
[1:18] God and how All Through the Ages from
[1:21] the beginning God has had a special
[1:24] group of people that he has treated
[1:26] differently
[1:28] God has treated the special way God has
[1:32] been
[1:34] maybe the word the world will use now is
[1:36] discriminatory
[1:39] it treats one this way and treats these
[1:42] ones the other way but the Bible told us
[1:45] like we read is not just god making that
[1:48] choice
[1:49] to treat some people right and treat
[1:52] some people the other way he said that
[1:54] the purpose of God according to election
[1:57] might stand
[1:59] God by far knowledge I knew the future
[2:02] he knew was going to believe in him he
[2:06] knew who will be saved and by that for
[2:09] knowledge God made a predetermination of
[2:12] their Destiny it is called a
[2:15] predestination
[2:16] God sanctioned it that none of those
[2:19] people that made it by is for knowledge
[2:23] will be lost
[2:26] I don't want to go ahead of myself
[2:28] but we're going to see this morning that
[2:31] we are in such a safe place as the bride
[2:34] of Christ
[2:35] we are going to see this morning that
[2:38] even if we were to decide to go to hell
[2:40] there is no way that will happen
[2:44] brother Graham said that if you if a
[2:47] child of God Is Lost he said a part of
[2:50] God Is Lost
[2:52] and what that means is God is incomplete
[2:55] and God cannot be incomplete
[3:00] let's look at what happened in Genesis
[3:03] The First Family
[3:05] we know what happened with Adam and Eve
[3:09] and how the serpent came and beguiled
[3:12] Eve and we know what happened the seed
[3:14] of the serpents and the seed of Adam
[3:18] and we know that the seed of the serpent
[3:20] was Cain and the seed of Adam was able
[3:24] but these two young men they knew that
[3:28] there was a need to offer sacrifice to
[3:31] God and in my imagination I used to
[3:34] think about it that there could have
[3:36] been you know growing up I think brother
[3:37] said that as well recently Adam training
[3:40] these two boys and telling them about
[3:43] what happened out of curiosity they
[3:45] would have wanted to know what really
[3:47] happened in the garden
[3:48] and Adam would have told them oh myself
[3:51] and your mother did something wrong
[3:55] and this is what happened but Adam also
[3:58] explained to them he must have what God
[4:02] did as a remedy
[4:05] what did God do as a remedy God took an
[4:07] innocent lamb and God sacrificed that
[4:10] lamb that lamb took their place
[4:12] and both of those young men were hearing
[4:16] the word
[4:17] but for one it was a revelation
[4:20] for the other it was not revealed
[4:22] because when time came for them to also
[4:25] ask for the Forgiveness of their sins
[4:28] the Bible said Cain was a tiller of the
[4:31] ground it was a farmer
[4:34] and he felt well I'm a farmer I'm going
[4:38] to take the best of my cross so the
[4:39] problem said they didn't give God Rotten
[4:41] Tomatoes
[4:42] he actually brought the best of his
[4:45] scrubs and tried to offer that to God if
[4:48] we look at it as humans that was good
[4:50] intention
[4:52] amen he was doing what he thought was
[4:54] right but we cannot serve god with good
[4:57] intentions we can only serve god with
[4:59] Revelation it has to be revealed that's
[5:02] why but the brand said in the church age
[5:04] book he said the importance of
[5:06] Revelation to the True Believer can
[5:10] never be overly emphasized
[5:12] importance of Revelation by the spirits
[5:16] to the believer can never be
[5:17] overemphasized so we found Abel
[5:21] doing something different it was not
[5:24] just because he attended to ship
[5:26] it was because the other revelation of
[5:29] what happened how did this fall happen
[5:31] it was revealed to Abel and Abel took an
[5:35] innocent lamb and did exactly what God
[5:38] did
[5:40] and as you would expect
[5:42] God had respect the Bible said God had
[5:45] respect to the sacrifice of Abel
[5:49] but God rejected the sacrifice of Cain
[5:53] it had to be Revelation this this was
[5:56] the first time we saw God treat two
[6:00] people differently
[6:03] so to say
[6:04] but what God was doing is God was
[6:07] following the place where the revelation
[6:09] of his Word was God will always confirm
[6:12] his word and we know that from there you
[6:15] know can Kill Devil because it was
[6:18] very upset that God rejected the
[6:20] sacrifice and we know what God Said I
[6:23] believe said to us on Wednesday it was
[6:25] the same voice
[6:27] that Abel heard that King heard as well
[6:30] the same voice that told Abel kill the
[6:32] lamb
[6:33] told Cain and said to him go and do the
[6:38] same thing that your brother did and you
[6:40] will be accepted
[6:42] but without revelation we cannot truly
[6:44] serve God
[6:46] and the world continued and it came to a
[6:49] time in Genesis chapter 6 The Bible said
[6:52] it repented God
[6:54] that he made man
[6:57] God for the first time the Bible told us
[7:00] that God has a regret for something he
[7:02] had done
[7:03] and God said I'm going to destroy man
[7:05] I'm going to destroy all cattle
[7:07] the the situation at that time you know
[7:10] Jesus Christ told us that as it was in
[7:13] the days of Noah though so shall it be
[7:16] so we can actually imagine that the same
[7:18] thing that we are seeing today was what
[7:21] God saw all the Abomination that's
[7:23] happened on the land meeting between man
[7:26] and Beast was probably happening at that
[7:28] time
[7:29] and God said
[7:32] I shouldn't have made man in the first
[7:34] place the Bible said he dreamed the
[7:35] heart of God
[7:37] they made me but do you know the most
[7:39] important part of this part of the
[7:41] scripture was verse 8 that said but Noah
[7:45] found Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[7:47] [Music]
[7:49] that God could still find a man in the
[7:52] rocks and in all of the the Abomination
[7:56] that was happening God still found a man
[7:59] that found Grace in the sight
[8:03] and let me just chip in a short story
[8:05] about Grace here just to give us you
[8:07] know a description of what Grace is
[8:09] because just using the words of merited
[8:12] favor
[8:13] um might not actually you know make us
[8:15] understand it so there was a story told
[8:17] I can't remember where I heard the story
[8:18] but growing up I had a story of
[8:21] a man who was a pauper
[8:24] and he was you know living outside the
[8:27] city but right in the city the city
[8:29] actually
[8:30] um
[8:31] just lost their King
[8:34] and they had consulted their gods and
[8:37] their gods had said well
[8:39] the next person to be king
[8:41] you'll find this person at the gates so
[8:44] you just go to the gates of the city the
[8:47] first man you find there will become
[8:49] king
[8:50] and this power was going through towards
[8:53] the city just about the time they were
[8:54] going to the gates and when they got to
[8:56] the gate they met the Pauper
[8:58] a poor man that had nothing that was in
[9:01] rags
[9:02] and based on what their gods had said
[9:04] that was supposed to be their King
[9:07] so they took him
[9:09] and took him from the state that he was
[9:12] or Papa a maiden King
[9:16] amen
[9:18] a popper that had nothing
[9:21] to becoming the king of one of the
[9:22] richest cities on Earth
[9:25] but one thing this Papa did to
[9:27] understand
[9:29] that this is Grace and never forget it
[9:32] it took the rags that he had he told
[9:35] them give me a room
[9:37] and put a chair in there
[9:39] and he took those rags
[9:41] and just put it on the chair like you
[9:43] know made it look like someone sitting
[9:45] on that chair
[9:47] and anytime he got puffed up in his
[9:49] heart and felt I'm King and I can do
[9:51] anything I want it goes to that little
[9:54] room he opens the door and it reminds
[9:56] himself this is where I'm coming from
[9:59] that's what Grace is is on meritable
[10:02] it's something that we did not deserve
[10:05] in the first place
[10:06] so when the Bible said no I found Grace
[10:09] in the sight of God it was not because
[10:11] of Noah's righteousness
[10:14] God just gave Grace Grace is freely
[10:18] given Grace is a favor Grace is
[10:22] unmerited
[10:24] so Noah found Grace on the sight of God
[10:27] and Noah became the man
[10:31] through whom God preserved the the human
[10:34] race
[10:35] and the animal race
[10:37] in the anti-delivian world
[10:40] and we know what happened after Noah
[10:42] came out of the floor and and God
[10:45] started to replenish the Earth through
[10:47] Noir there was a man in Genesis chapter
[10:50] 12 that was called Abraham
[10:54] that also found favor with God
[10:57] and God called Abraham and I'll draw a
[11:00] little bit on Abraham's story is is very
[11:03] interesting and and it's not just
[11:04] interesting Abraham's story ties to us
[11:07] the Covenant that God gave Abraham
[11:10] was different from the Covenant that God
[11:12] gave Moses for the children of Israel
[11:15] brother Paul made us understand that the
[11:17] Covenant that God gave Abraham was
[11:19] unconditional
[11:21] brother Brown said somewhere it did not
[11:24] depend on Abraham's success or Abraham's
[11:27] faithfulness he depended on God's
[11:30] faithfulness what that meant is no
[11:33] matter what happened
[11:36] God had to keep that Covenant
[11:38] and we saw God calling out Abraham in
[11:41] Genesis chapter 12 and God called
[11:43] Abraham and told him to leave his
[11:45] father's land his Kindred and go to a
[11:48] place that he was going to show him
[11:50] and God said something to Abraham that I
[11:52] found remarkable
[11:54] God said to him I will bless them
[11:57] that blessing what was he saying people
[12:01] are going to see you
[12:03] and they're going to bless you and just
[12:05] because they bless you I will bless them
[12:09] he didn't stop there there are some
[12:10] people that are going to see you and
[12:12] curse you and just because they curse
[12:15] you I'm going to curse them
[12:17] talk about Grace
[12:19] what else
[12:21] can we say
[12:23] that Abraham did to deserve this
[12:25] and Abraham was not entirely a perfect
[12:28] man
[12:29] because right after God called Abraham
[12:32] and he left his father's land and went
[12:35] to kept traveling going to find that
[12:38] City that God said he was going to show
[12:39] him
[12:40] he got to a point where there was
[12:42] farming on the land and Abraham went to
[12:44] Egypt
[12:45] but the RAM said he shouldn't have gone
[12:47] to Egypt that was backsliding but when
[12:49] he got to Egypt what did he do because
[12:51] of the men of the land and because of
[12:52] the beauty of his wife he told the LIE
[12:56] and you will imagine that when Abraham
[12:58] lied God would punish Abraham for lying
[13:02] but God did not plague Abraham God
[13:05] plagued pharaoh and his servants for
[13:08] trying to take Abraham's wife because
[13:10] Abraham deceived them you will expect
[13:13] that God will go to Abraham and scold
[13:15] Abraham
[13:17] but God didn't do that this was a man
[13:19] that found exceptional favor with God
[13:25] and God told pharaoh the woman that you
[13:28] have in your house is another man's wife
[13:31] well I didn't know that
[13:35] and he sent Abraham away
[13:37] and when Abraham left another remarkable
[13:40] you know part of Abraham's life
[13:43] was if you remember when Abraham
[13:44] actually left his father's land God told
[13:46] him to live by himself alone leave your
[13:50] Kindle leave your family leave everybody
[13:51] just you and your immediate family leave
[13:54] but he went with lots
[13:57] and in Genesis 13 we know that the men
[14:00] and servants and the and of Abraham and
[14:03] the men Servants of Lord started to
[14:04] strive
[14:05] and that caused a division and and
[14:07] Abraham went and said you know what Lord
[14:10] you know there's no need for us to
[14:11] strive just just look at the land it's
[14:13] been given to me choose a place
[14:16] a lot to look by sight
[14:18] when Lots looked and chose the place
[14:21] that looked green that had very good
[14:24] posture and left program was describing
[14:27] this to us that Sarah started looking at
[14:30] Lords and Lot's wife and wondering
[14:34] if they admit the wrong choice or not
[14:37] and she started getting worked on and
[14:39] she started telling Abraham you know we
[14:41] are living on the dance that there's no
[14:42] water you know things are not doing
[14:44] going going fine and look at Lots down
[14:48] in the valley they're doing so well
[14:50] yeah but do you know what God Said to
[14:52] Abraham just after lot left him
[14:55] God told Abraham he said lift up your
[14:58] eyes
[14:59] look not what look Southward look
[15:01] Eastward look everywhere he said I have
[15:04] given it to you
[15:06] at the time when it looked like Abraham
[15:08] had lost
[15:10] because Lots took the greener pastures
[15:12] God said to him don't worry about it I
[15:16] have given it to you God didn't even
[15:17] stop there
[15:19] God told him he said walk around
[15:21] Hallelujah
[15:23] make sure that you use your feet to take
[15:26] possession
[15:28] of that land what I've given it to you
[15:31] did Abraham literally have it no but
[15:34] that was God giving them a promise this
[15:37] land belongs to you and to your seed
[15:39] after you
[15:43] and in Genesis 17
[15:46] we see God confirming that Covenant that
[15:50] he made with a sign of circumcision
[15:52] you know before then I believed in
[15:55] Genesis 14
[15:56] you know it's quite interesting Abraham
[15:59] lot at
[16:01] you know gone ahead to choose and and
[16:03] sometimes when you look at it Lots at
[16:06] every reason to have made Abraham to
[16:08] choose first
[16:09] right Abraham was his uncle Abraham was
[16:11] the one that brought him out Abraham was
[16:14] the pace setter
[16:16] but he made the choice to go to Saddam
[16:18] and when he was in there you know that
[16:20] there was there was a war the the kings
[16:22] that came five kings came against where
[16:25] I saw them where where Lord was and took
[16:27] him captive
[16:28] and Abraham Brotherly Love expressing
[16:31] Brotherly Love went after
[16:34] those kings and conquered them with his
[16:36] servants with knives and not not trained
[16:39] Army
[16:40] just someone that had the grace of God
[16:43] and he went after them and he actually
[16:45] overcame and when he was coming back he
[16:48] met Melchizedek
[16:50] and I really love I like to read how
[16:53] Melchizedek addressed him
[16:57] you know he gets to a point
[17:00] where you realize that people start to
[17:03] call you
[17:04] by God's name
[17:07] because they've seen so much of God in
[17:09] you
[17:10] that's there's no way they can actually
[17:13] describe you without having
[17:17] to put God's name in there
[17:21] [Music]
[17:23] and it said
[17:24] I think it's verse 19 of
[17:27] Genesis 14.
[17:31] and he blessed him and said Blessed Be
[17:33] Abraham of the most high God
[17:38] Abraham of the most high God
[17:41] he didn't just call him Abraham at this
[17:44] point Abraham has already got into that
[17:47] place where his name was been
[17:51] tied to the name of God
[17:53] Abraham of the most high God
[17:56] and he didn't stop that he called them
[17:57] the possesso of Heaven and Earth
[18:03] so in in 17 we see God confirming that
[18:06] Covenant to Abraham by giving the sign
[18:08] of circumcision and that became
[18:11] a sign that God had given Abraham an
[18:14] unconditional Covenant
[18:17] and that was supposed to be passed on
[18:18] from generation to generation and we
[18:20] know that brother Paul came and
[18:21] expressed to us that circumcision being
[18:25] a type of the circumcision of our souls
[18:27] today
[18:29] and in Genesis 18 we saw God coming down
[18:32] to visit Abraham
[18:35] God came down to visit his friend
[18:38] and when God came down
[18:40] in verse 19 he said it was he was
[18:43] thinking about you know God God was
[18:45] actually considering should I actually
[18:47] tell Abraham about you know what is
[18:49] what's going to happen you know shall I
[18:51] tell him about what is going to happen
[18:52] you know in Sodom and Gomorrah
[18:55] but there was a reason
[18:57] why God decided to tell Abraham his
[19:01] secrets he said for I know him
[19:04] that he will command his children
[19:07] and his household after him and they
[19:10] shall keep the way of the Lord to do
[19:12] justice and judgments
[19:14] that the Lord may bring upon Abraham
[19:17] that's which he had spoken of him
[19:20] and whenever I read this creature I mean
[19:22] it's a challenge to we Brothers men and
[19:25] how God looks at us and how God
[19:28] considers
[19:30] as priests in our homes
[19:34] God look at Abraham
[19:37] I know him
[19:39] he will command his children
[19:42] his household after him he will ensure
[19:45] they keep the way of the Lord
[19:48] is going to be the one that is in there
[19:50] to guard what is coming in
[19:53] to be sure that there's no fields that
[19:56] comes in I think many years ago there's
[19:58] a song I heard
[20:00] you know I can't remember who sang it
[20:01] but when this person was singing at some
[20:03] point it was just kind of putting some
[20:04] words and he said to the devil he said
[20:07] you have no place in my home
[20:11] is Abraham standing in the gates
[20:15] not only instructing his children and
[20:17] his household but standing in the gate
[20:19] as the priest of the house God saw that
[20:22] and God recognized that
[20:26] and that was something that made God to
[20:28] make a decision you know what I have so
[20:31] much respect for this man that I will
[20:34] not keep the secret away from me
[20:37] and God told Abraham
[20:39] and God did not just tell Abraham was
[20:40] going to happen God sought advice from
[20:44] Abraham
[20:46] what do you think I should do
[20:48] and Abraham said oh Lord if there just
[20:50] be 50 righteous people
[20:52] you know will you just save this this
[20:54] this this this this city and not destroy
[20:57] it
[20:59] and there was a bargain happening
[21:01] between man and God
[21:05] we're talking about the grace of God
[21:07] this morning we're talking about the
[21:08] expression of that Grace and and and
[21:11] when we think about it you know down
[21:13] from his glory
[21:14] he said the great creator
[21:17] became my savior
[21:20] God stepped down to our level you know I
[21:23] used to think about that what condescend
[21:25] and you know over time I used to think
[21:27] that it meant you know
[21:29] condense because sometimes you can't
[21:31] kind of think about it being condensed
[21:34] but that's that's it's not the same
[21:35] meaning condescend is to step down to a
[21:38] lower level
[21:41] and the way I used to describe it is
[21:45] if Trudeau decides to pick up
[21:48] another job
[21:50] and it decides to be
[21:53] treat sweeper it sweeps the streets and
[21:56] he does that at night
[21:59] still the same true rule that's prime
[22:01] minister of Canada
[22:03] is going to end this
[22:05] let's say shift job and go back to being
[22:08] prime minister
[22:10] but that's him condescending to the
[22:13] level of being a cleaner
[22:15] a sweet sorry a street sweeper
[22:19] and if he has colleagues as other
[22:22] cleaners they have that ability to
[22:24] relate with him
[22:26] as a colleague
[22:29] but then they have the opportunity as
[22:31] well
[22:32] to realize that this is not just a
[22:34] street sweeper this is also the prime
[22:37] minister
[22:38] and because he's the Prime Minister if I
[22:40] have a problem I can actually speak with
[22:43] him because he's holding those two
[22:45] offices that's the same thing that it is
[22:47] with us and God
[22:49] that was the same thing that happened it
[22:51] was the god of Heaven the create the
[22:53] maker of heaven on Earth that stepped
[22:55] down into flesh that came and sat with
[22:58] Abraham and they had a conversation
[23:04] and in that condescending that God did
[23:07] God gave Abraham a specific
[23:11] promise a specific
[23:14] you know instruction on when that
[23:16] promise was going to come he said
[23:17] according to the time of life
[23:19] This Promise you've been waiting on for
[23:21] 25 years according to the time of life
[23:24] it is going to come to pass
[23:30] and then we know what happened Genesis
[23:33] 20.
[23:34] you know God had changed their bodies
[23:37] the other body change himself and Sarah
[23:39] and they had gone to
[23:41] the land of the Philistines and I beat
[23:43] my leg swords here
[23:45] and when he saw Sarah
[23:46] you know Abraham had lied again and said
[23:48] you know what this is my sister not my
[23:51] wife just tell tell them that you're my
[23:53] sister because you're so pretty I think
[23:56] they might kill me
[23:57] just to have you
[24:01] but then
[24:02] God plagued the family of abimelech
[24:07] and I've been like so you know had an
[24:09] encounter with God in the dream and God
[24:11] told him you're as good as a dead man
[24:14] because the man that you have
[24:17] is another person's wife say restore
[24:21] the man is wife
[24:23] and I've even like said to God I've done
[24:25] this in the Integrity of my heart
[24:30] God said I know and that's why I've not
[24:32] killed you
[24:34] but one thing you know you need to know
[24:36] is you and all your servants you're
[24:38] already barren
[24:41] and for you to be healed go meet that
[24:43] liar
[24:44] that liar has got to pray for you
[24:49] the grace of God
[24:51] it's freely given
[24:54] it's not about what we have done it's
[24:55] not we are not trying to encourage
[24:57] ourselves to just do you know do
[24:58] whatever we like to do or just be be
[25:01] complacent or not be be true Christians
[25:03] because what we do when we understand
[25:06] this Grace it drives us to a point where
[25:10] we want to give our all to him in
[25:13] appreciation for what he has done
[25:18] you love the Lord this morning
[25:20] amen and amen
[25:25] and in Genesis 22
[25:28] Abraham was going to get us
[25:30] test God had given the promise divide
[25:33] Isaac
[25:34] and God told him
[25:36] this child
[25:38] take him and go on sacrifice him
[25:40] because what God wanted to make that
[25:42] Covenant double sure
[25:46] when God makes a promise it's enough
[25:49] that that promise will come to pass
[25:52] amen but God wanted to make it double
[25:55] sure because that Covenant was not just
[25:58] for Abraham it was for Abraham and his
[26:01] seat after him
[26:03] and we know that seed was not the
[26:05] natural seed
[26:07] we know that Sid was speaking about
[26:08] Jesus Christ we know when he said to
[26:11] Abraham in thy said shall all the
[26:14] nations of the heart be blessed he was
[26:16] talking about Jesus coming and how the
[26:19] coming of Jesus
[26:21] has been a blessing to all of us today
[26:24] so Abraham went to Isaac
[26:27] you know they got there on that mount we
[26:29] know the story
[26:32] and Abraham was going to do just what
[26:34] God said he was going to do and the
[26:35] angel of the Lord came and held his head
[26:39] and let him know
[26:42] that God said now I know
[26:46] and I've thought about it now I know can
[26:49] God be knowing anything new no
[26:52] God was knowing by experience
[26:56] God knew all the time that Abraham was
[26:59] going to do what he was going to do but
[27:01] it had never happened before
[27:03] before that time but now it has happened
[27:06] and God could now say now I know by
[27:10] experience
[27:13] that you will do just what I ask you to
[27:15] do
[27:16] and that drove God to a point where God
[27:18] said I'm going to swear by myself
[27:22] and brother Paul telling us he said by
[27:25] two immutable things
[27:27] in which it was impossible for God to
[27:31] lie
[27:33] for God where me when God made the
[27:35] promise to Abraham because he could
[27:37] swear by no greater he swore by himself
[27:40] and that was not just for Abraham
[27:42] because brother Paul said that by two
[27:43] immutable things in which it was
[27:45] impossible for God to lie we might have
[27:48] a strong consolation
[27:52] a strong consolation
[27:55] he wants to give us a strong consolation
[27:57] no matter what we are going through in
[27:59] life
[28:00] God wants to give us a strong
[28:02] consolation
[28:04] many times points where they give up on
[28:08] themselves
[28:10] speaking with a young friend of mine
[28:11] from back in Nigeria yesterday
[28:14] you know is that many struggles in his
[28:17] life a young man that's you know just
[28:19] got addicted to pornography and to
[28:23] various you know at some point drugs and
[28:25] all of those things
[28:27] and
[28:28] he will always want to come back to God
[28:32] but then something keeps driving him
[28:33] away
[28:35] and you know yesterday we got on a call
[28:37] after a while and he was telling me what
[28:38] had happened the past week
[28:41] and he said one of the things that he
[28:43] has seen is you know he's trying to do
[28:44] his business nothing was working
[28:47] we got to a point where he said to
[28:49] himself
[28:52] I've got to make my ways right with God
[28:55] and he said to himself going forward I'm
[28:59] going to spend the first seven days of
[29:00] every month just fasting and praying
[29:04] and as he started to do that he saw that
[29:07] his business was also going in the right
[29:09] direction
[29:10] why because I said to him I said you are
[29:13] a child of God
[29:15] many other people will be successful
[29:18] without
[29:20] doing what God wants them to do still
[29:22] living in sin and doing all of those
[29:23] things but God made your business not to
[29:25] thrive because God wanted to get your
[29:27] attention
[29:29] and now that God has your attention
[29:32] you'll do well but you make sure that
[29:34] you see in life
[29:38] because God is not going to lose any of
[29:40] his own
[29:42] so it was not just a promise to Abraham
[29:45] it was a promise for us God swore by
[29:46] himself by two immutable things in which
[29:49] it was impossible for God to lie
[29:53] that Covenant God said I will not break
[29:55] it
[29:57] and we know that you know after that we
[30:00] had Isaac and Isaac married Rebecca
[30:04] and where we read in Romans chapter 9
[30:08] was talking about those two sons of
[30:09] Isaac and Ray Baker
[30:11] Rebecca was expecting you know she was
[30:13] Barren for a while and then Isaac prayed
[30:16] and the lawyer the prayer of Isaac and
[30:18] Rebecca conceit
[30:20] and at some point I was just imagining
[30:23] you know I was just imagining that she
[30:25] must have got to got into a point where
[30:27] you know she started having what women
[30:30] would not naturally have when they're
[30:31] you know having about to have their
[30:33] babies when they're pregnant kids
[30:35] kicking in the tummy
[30:37] and she felt it was normal
[30:39] but this was getting you know more
[30:42] painful this was getting
[30:44] too worrisome for her she probably went
[30:47] to all the women and said you know I'm
[30:49] having this rumbling happening in my
[30:50] tummy and they said well that's that's
[30:52] normal you know when you're pregnant you
[30:54] know kids will kick and he said this
[30:57] this is very unusual
[31:00] but then she went to God
[31:02] and when she spoke to God
[31:04] told her the reason why this happening
[31:07] to you to you is that there are two
[31:08] Nations
[31:09] in your womb
[31:12] and the older Shall Serve the younger
[31:16] that was as much as God told Rebecca
[31:19] but the poll telling us that God
[31:21] actually said to Rebecca that Esau have
[31:25] I hated and Jacob have I loved
[31:30] and he said here these children had not
[31:32] yet been born
[31:34] they had neither known good they're
[31:37] neither done evil
[31:39] but God had a purpose
[31:43] according to election
[31:46] before they were ever born gone by full
[31:50] knowledge knew their destination and
[31:54] said that was what was going to happen
[31:57] nothing could change it
[32:02] let me read something to the brand said
[32:03] about foreknowledge and the message the
[32:05] identification of Christ in all ages
[32:08] but the Brahm said I now remember
[32:10] paragraph 73 and now remember
[32:14] if you ever did or ever will have
[32:18] eternal life
[32:19] you add it with him then before the
[32:24] foundation of the world see you had it
[32:25] with him because Jesus came
[32:28] and Jesus was the Redeemer
[32:30] to redeem anything is Bring It Back
[32:34] from where it falling from or where it
[32:38] went from
[32:40] redeem it bring it back
[32:42] but Ram now says and you
[32:45] the way you look
[32:48] Who You Are
[32:51] what your name is
[32:54] that was God's thinking before the
[32:57] foundation of the world
[33:03] I want that to sink in
[33:06] the way you look
[33:08] Who You Are
[33:11] what your name is
[33:13] that was God's thinking before the
[33:15] foundation of the world you know and I I
[33:17] I remember that song you know that very
[33:19] first song in in the only belief song
[33:21] book
[33:22] only believe fear not little flock at
[33:24] some point he said you're a shepherd
[33:26] selected the path you must trade
[33:31] and what occurred to me is that my
[33:34] shepherd the Lord Jesus Christ so many
[33:36] options
[33:38] that I will think are better options
[33:41] maybe I would have said oh you should
[33:43] have done this we should have planned my
[33:44] life out this way she should have made
[33:46] it look at this way you should have you
[33:48] should have avoided this part of my life
[33:51] you should have not made me go into this
[33:53] kind of things that I did in my life
[33:55] that I regret
[33:57] but what did he say your Shepherds
[34:00] selected he made a choice the best
[34:03] choice of the path that you must shred
[34:05] your Shepherd did that
[34:09] that was God's thinking before the
[34:11] foundation of the way you look
[34:13] you might say I've fallen in sin that
[34:14] was God's thinking before the foundation
[34:16] of the world
[34:17] you might say I'm poor that was God's
[34:19] thinking before the foundation of the
[34:21] world you might say I've lost loved ones
[34:23] that was God's thinking before the
[34:26] foundation of the world
[34:28] amen
[34:31] the ram said
[34:33] and Jesus came not to save the whole
[34:35] thing
[34:38] he wanted to
[34:41] for God so loved the world
[34:44] that he gave his only begotten son the
[34:46] wish of the Bible said is not the will
[34:49] of God that any Shall Perish
[34:52] God wanted to save the all thing if he
[34:55] could
[34:57] but he came to redeem
[35:01] redeem means what bring back
[35:05] then that was in his thoughts
[35:09] before the beginning
[35:11] what does this tell us if you were in
[35:14] his spot before the beginning
[35:16] you can't stay back
[35:19] you must be redeemed
[35:21] and anyone that was not in a spot before
[35:23] the beginning can never be redeemed
[35:28] that is how it is
[35:31] it sounds discriminatory it sounds like
[35:33] God is partial but that's not what it is
[35:36] but God by his foreign knowledge knowing
[35:38] what was there before the beginning is
[35:41] only able to restore that which had been
[35:43] there before the beginning nothing more
[35:46] nothing less
[35:50] let's look at the story of Moses
[35:53] in constructs with pharaoh
[35:56] you know Moses
[35:59] was born by his Jewish parents but then
[36:01] the daughter of pharaoh saw the princess
[36:03] saw him
[36:04] and then took him to be Stone and then
[36:07] he liked he had to live in the palace
[36:09] and he must have probably lived with the
[36:11] pharaoh
[36:12] that's you know
[36:14] was was was was there when he had to go
[36:16] back and deliver the children of Israel
[36:21] and when God was talking about Moses in
[36:24] Exodus 2
[36:27] when that record was being
[36:29] captured
[36:30] was talking about the mother of Moses
[36:32] and said and the woman conceived and
[36:34] very soon and when she saw him that it
[36:37] was a goodly child
[36:42] Moses was a goodly child
[36:45] and we saw these two boys grew up in the
[36:48] palace in Egypt Moses and pharaoh and we
[36:53] know what happened Moses after leaving
[36:55] for 40 years right there you know he had
[36:58] heard the story of him being born as a
[37:00] deliverer but I'm actually you know kind
[37:02] of explained that in the in a way it
[37:04] dramatized that in teaching on Moses
[37:08] and he felt I will make this happen by
[37:10] myself
[37:12] I'm a deliverer right so I'll go deliver
[37:14] my people he had a special connection
[37:17] with the Jews not only because it looked
[37:20] like them but his mother had told them
[37:22] the story but the brand said that his
[37:23] mother told him everything that happened
[37:25] she was bringing him up in the way of
[37:27] the Lord
[37:29] and he felt he could do it by his power
[37:32] and when that filled
[37:34] he went into exile for 40 years until
[37:37] the Lord called him
[37:39] when the Lord called him and told him to
[37:41] go and deliver the people his own way
[37:43] not by fighting but with just that road
[37:47] that became not Moses rods and Moses
[37:52] wrote anymore but became God's Own rod
[37:54] with that stuff that God said he should
[37:56] go and deliver the people away
[37:59] God also said about pharaoh
[38:02] he said and in this very deed
[38:05] for this course have I raised thee up
[38:10] for to show thee in thee my power
[38:13] God decided to raise up a man
[38:16] just to show
[38:18] that God could plague that Nation
[38:22] the richest nation that God could plague
[38:25] that Nation to a point where the nation
[38:28] was completely destroyed and God could
[38:30] deliver his people
[38:33] do you know that when Moses first went
[38:34] to pharaoh
[38:37] what Moses asked for was very easy
[38:41] we want to go into the Wilderness for
[38:43] three days
[38:44] and serve our God and will come back
[38:49] sounded really easy but the Bible
[38:52] continuously said as each of those
[38:53] plagues came he said and the Lord had in
[38:56] the heart of pharaoh
[38:58] the Lord did it
[39:00] because God raised him up because God
[39:03] wanted to show his power with those 10
[39:05] plagues
[39:06] they couldn't have stopped at five
[39:09] God was going to completely destroy
[39:11] Egypt
[39:14] because God had promised Abraham
[39:17] your children will be strangers and the
[39:20] strained luck for 400 years and after
[39:22] 400 years I'll deliver them and he said
[39:25] the nation
[39:27] that will hold them captive I will
[39:29] destroy
[39:30] and God raised up Pharaoh what are we
[39:33] trying to say God God that knows the
[39:36] future
[39:37] decides to look at his own people and
[39:40] express his grace
[39:42] towards them
[39:44] the grace is extended to all but not all
[39:47] can accept that Grace
[39:49] is not in all that that Grace can be
[39:51] expressed
[39:53] look at Peter and Judas
[39:57] those are two disciples that both filled
[39:59] Jesus
[40:02] when I thought about this
[40:04] yesterday
[40:06] I think I was in the shower I just
[40:08] started screaming
[40:12] Peter denied Jesus
[40:14] Judas betrayed Jesus
[40:19] but in Luke 22
[40:22] Jesus looked at
[40:24] Peter
[40:26] and said to him you know that was like
[40:28] the last days of Jesus
[40:30] Peter was showing a lot of enthusiasm he
[40:33] was showing a lot of you know
[40:35] Jesus
[40:37] just showing that commitment to Jesus I
[40:40] will go anywhere I will stand there for
[40:42] you nothing will happen
[40:46] and the Lord said Simon Simon
[40:50] behold
[40:52] Satan a desired to have you
[40:56] that he might sift you as wheat
[41:00] but I have prayed for thee
[41:05] talk about Grace
[41:07] but I have prayed for thee
[41:11] that I faithful not
[41:13] and when thou art converted
[41:16] strengthen thy brethren
[41:18] that was what God that's what Jesus said
[41:20] to Peter
[41:22] Peter was such a failure
[41:25] just like Judas was
[41:27] but in Peter was a seed that was not
[41:30] present in Judas
[41:33] that is the difference that is why we
[41:35] read that part where the Paul told us
[41:37] that we are A peculiar people
[41:40] a royal priesthood a holy nation we are
[41:44] different we did not make ourselves
[41:46] different that was how God intended it
[41:49] before the foundation of the world and
[41:51] brothers and sisters nothing can change
[41:54] it
[41:55] not even you yourself
[41:58] that's what I want us to realize this
[42:00] money nothing can change it not your
[42:03] sins not your failures
[42:05] Peter failed God
[42:07] Peter denied him but before Peter could
[42:11] deny him Jesus already prayed for Peter
[42:17] and you want me to tell you something
[42:18] that's so cool
[42:20] before you were even born
[42:22] Jesus prayed for you
[42:24] [Music]
[42:26] Hallelujah
[42:28] John 17 20. neither pray I for this
[42:32] alone
[42:34] but for them also that Shall Believe on
[42:36] me through their words
[42:39] he has prayed for you he has prayed for
[42:42] me I'm pleased to know that it doesn't
[42:45] depend on me
[42:47] Hallelujah it does not depend on me it's
[42:50] not a conditional Covenant it's a
[42:54] non-conditional covenant
[42:58] and when we see that he has done this
[43:00] for us
[43:02] but Abraham told us a story
[43:05] or an analogy of someone
[43:07] who was taken to an arcade
[43:09] and told this is all for you
[43:12] he said I don't imagine that person is
[43:14] going to sit down somewhere
[43:16] and just start to appreciate that well
[43:18] this is for me what is he going to do
[43:19] he's going to explore
[43:21] these are mine I want to see it oh
[43:25] there's a big hotel here and that's mine
[43:27] as well yes I want to go in there I want
[43:29] to see how the rooms look like why
[43:31] because it belongs to me and if the
[43:34] promises of God are ours today then we
[43:37] should explore it
[43:39] we are a special people way peculiar
[43:41] people and I want us to hear some of
[43:43] those promises I know we know them but I
[43:46] want to read out some of those promises
[43:47] to us and I'm going to close shortly I
[43:49] know I Don't Preach too long but you
[43:51] know it's it's just it's just good to
[43:53] remind ourselves of these things that
[43:55] God has given to us
[43:58] and as you hear those promises you know
[44:01] what you need to do just say Amen
[44:04] just say Amen just just tell yourself
[44:06] these are mine these are for me my
[44:09] condition might not look like it but my
[44:12] condition has got nothing to do with it
[44:14] because the word of God will stand
[44:19] the expression of God's grace
[44:22] you want to see God's grace but where
[44:24] I'm talking about brother Moody
[44:28] he taught about Grace
[44:32] he got into that point he thought about
[44:33] it
[44:35] Grace became personified to him
[44:39] he went on the streets he was asking
[44:42] everybody do you know Grace do you know
[44:45] Grace
[44:47] and someone said who are you talking
[44:48] about Grace who
[44:50] and he said the grace of God
[44:53] why that was a man
[44:55] in whom the grace of God has been
[44:57] expressed
[44:59] it was a man that that Grace had been
[45:02] shown had been made manifest through him
[45:06] and he realized it he realized he had
[45:08] nothing to do with what he had done he
[45:10] realized that he hadn't done anything to
[45:12] deserve this unmerited favor and when he
[45:15] got to the point where that struck him
[45:17] he wanted to meet Grace
[45:21] fed this was a person I need to meet
[45:24] but we don't need to meet Grace because
[45:25] Grace is in us we are that expression of
[45:29] his grace
[45:30] man unless of the things he has said to
[45:32] us Isaiah 40 29 he gives strength to the
[45:36] weary
[45:37] and increases the power of the weak
[45:39] Isaiah 40 31 but those who opened the
[45:42] Lord will renew their strength
[45:45] they will swear on wings like eagles
[45:47] they will run and not grow weary
[45:50] they will walk and not be faint
[45:53] 43 says when you pass through the waters
[45:56] I will be with you
[45:59] and when you pass through the rivers
[46:01] they will not sweep over you when you
[46:04] walk through the fire you will not be
[46:06] burned
[46:07] the Flames will not set you Ablaze
[46:10] Jeremiah 29 11 said for I know the plans
[46:13] I have for you that cleanse the Lord
[46:16] plans to prosper you and not to harm you
[46:19] plans to give you a hope
[46:22] and a future
[46:24] you love him this morning
[46:28] do you want more of those promises I
[46:30] should remind you more of them
[46:32] all right Deuteronomy 3 1 8 he said the
[46:35] Lord himself goes before you and will be
[46:39] with you
[46:40] what is it that you want
[46:43] what is that obstacle in front of you
[46:45] what is that dream that you have that
[46:48] looks like you cannot achieve what is
[46:50] that path that you are on that looks
[46:52] like something has stopped it
[46:55] said the Lord himself goes before you
[46:59] and will be with you he will never leave
[47:03] you nor forsake you
[47:07] don't be afraid
[47:09] don't be discouraged
[47:12] Joshua 1 9. have I not commanded you
[47:18] wow
[47:20] you know what God was trying to do to
[47:22] Joshua
[47:23] he was trying to point Joshua away from
[47:26] having confidence in himself
[47:28] to having confidence in God
[47:32] you know in my local language
[47:34] they used to say that the person we fear
[47:38] is not the person who sends the message
[47:42] is the person that sends you the message
[47:44] that you feel let me kind of explain
[47:46] that if the Paul asked me to go
[47:49] and tell brother bear is something
[47:52] maybe it's not something for the very
[47:54] ones to hear
[47:57] I'm not responsible for that message
[47:59] I'm only a carrier of the message the
[48:02] person that takes responsibility for it
[48:04] is the person that sends the messenger
[48:09] so what God was saying to Joshua I am
[48:12] the one that commanded you
[48:14] you are not going in your might this is
[48:17] not about you it is not your decision
[48:21] and it's not a decision to be here or
[48:23] not in the first place
[48:25] it was God's decision but Abraham said
[48:28] Hallelujah but Abraham said that the
[48:30] natural birth
[48:33] is more miraculous than the Virgin birth
[48:39] that in the millions of that seed
[48:42] God could determine that this actual one
[48:44] is the one that will meet the egg and
[48:47] will form you in your mother's womb
[48:50] talk about predestination
[48:52] we are not here by Mystic
[48:55] God didn't just bring us here I mean
[48:58] sometimes we look at our lives and
[48:59] because we have a very short-sighted
[49:01] view of what is going to happen in the
[49:03] future we we we we think that things are
[49:06] just you know happening the way the way
[49:09] that just by chance
[49:12] but this is a purposeful design by God
[49:17] when you go to a house that's been built
[49:21] if you've never seen the plan I'm not a
[49:23] builder I know where the brother Poland
[49:25] for the very kind of actually corrects
[49:26] me on this
[49:27] but if you've never seen the plan
[49:30] you go in there you just think things
[49:32] are happening
[49:33] or they put a wall here oh wow that
[49:35] looks nice sometimes you might even
[49:37] question it why they put a wall here
[49:41] but the Builder is following a plan
[49:44] if you are not aware of the plan you
[49:46] think it's just doing it
[49:48] by guesses it's just making a guess and
[49:51] just putting things and just you know
[49:52] making on the spot decision Our Lives is
[49:55] not designed that way God has a plan
[49:58] anything that happens in our life is not
[50:01] an on the spots decision it's a decision
[50:04] that was made before the foundation of
[50:06] the world I'm not talking about the good
[50:08] things only even the bad things
[50:12] has been put there by Design
[50:15] he said have I not commanded you be
[50:17] strong
[50:18] and courageous
[50:20] do not be afraid
[50:23] do not be discouraged
[50:27] at the time that God was given Joshua
[50:30] this and I know brother has taken time
[50:32] to you know go through that the past
[50:35] a couple years you know
[50:38] about adoption and what happened and how
[50:41] Joshua parallels Ephesians
[50:45] but we know that Joshua had just been
[50:47] given the task
[50:50] that was bigger than him
[50:53] it was going to fit into shoes
[50:56] that his feet were too small for
[50:59] so he had every right
[51:03] to be afraid
[51:06] there was every you will understandable
[51:08] if he was out of Courage if he had no
[51:10] courage at all because the the servant
[51:13] of God Moses that great man had just
[51:16] been taken away
[51:19] and then he the servant of Moses you
[51:22] know that's how the Bible described it
[51:24] said when Moses the servant of God
[51:27] have been taken away
[51:29] then Joshua the servant of Moses God
[51:32] spoke to him
[51:34] and God was telling don't be discovered
[51:35] for the Lord your God will be with you
[51:38] wherever you go whether you feel the
[51:41] presence or not he is with you
[51:45] Psalm 23 4 even though I walk through
[51:48] the darkest Valley
[51:50] the Valley of the shadow of death
[51:53] I will fear no evil for you are with me
[51:57] your rod and your staff they comfort me
[52:01] the road to show me the direction the
[52:04] staff to correct me when I'm wrong they
[52:07] are both Comforts to me
[52:09] Philippians 4 6 to 7 says do not be
[52:12] anxious about anything
[52:15] but in every situation by prayer and
[52:18] petition with Thanksgiving present your
[52:21] request to God and the peace of God
[52:24] which transcends all understanding
[52:27] will guard your hearts and Minds in
[52:30] Christ Jesus
[52:32] Matthew 6 31-33 said don't worry saying
[52:37] what shall we eat
[52:39] or what shall we drink or what shall we
[52:42] wear
[52:43] for the pagans run after all these
[52:45] things and your heavenly father knows
[52:48] that you need damn
[52:52] hey man you know that's hard to tell
[52:55] someone that probably lost their job
[52:59] because you'll be anxious
[53:02] it's natural
[53:04] but when you step out away
[53:06] from understanding
[53:09] or or thinking that this is all about
[53:11] your plans and how you have you know how
[53:14] how you've planned it out and and the
[53:16] things that you expect will happen and
[53:18] the situations you've analyzed
[53:20] and know that it's about God
[53:22] then the anxiety will go
[53:25] and if I could give a personal testimony
[53:27] when I lost my job last year April
[53:30] it was tough
[53:33] it was tough to think about we're living
[53:36] on savings for how long will this be for
[53:38] I literally gave God a deadline and said
[53:41] God you know what this is a good plan
[53:43] let's do this you know let me get
[53:45] another job in one month
[53:47] and that will just be pretty fine
[53:50] but that was not God's plan
[53:52] God needed me to go through a five month
[53:55] of training
[53:57] of going through different emotions
[54:00] emotions of
[54:02] doubts emotions of pain emotions of
[54:05] confusion
[54:07] to the point where
[54:08] I wondered
[54:10] if it was God's will for us to have been
[54:12] in Canada
[54:13] knowing that God had actually said go
[54:15] forward and I will be with you
[54:18] but God shook me through that journey
[54:20] and got me to a point
[54:22] where I now had no more anxiety
[54:25] I remember I was having a conversation
[54:26] with Brother John
[54:27] you know he came around or has a job
[54:29] application going on and at some point I
[54:31] said to him you know what God knows the
[54:33] job I'm going to take
[54:34] God has planned it out God knows when it
[54:38] will happen
[54:40] and God will take care of us from this
[54:43] point to that time is going to happen
[54:48] and there's nothing that will be out of
[54:49] cater
[54:51] and when it happens I will be grateful
[54:53] for all other rejections that I have had
[54:56] because God will make the best choice
[54:59] that is the privilege we have as the
[55:02] children of God
[55:04] what what is it are we going to read
[55:06] that let me just continue this you know
[55:09] I want to close soon
[55:15] Matthew 6 I was reading 31-33
[55:20] he said for the pagans run after those
[55:22] things and your heavenly father knows
[55:25] that you need them
[55:26] but as something he said we shall seek
[55:28] after he said but seek ye first
[55:30] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[55:33] and all these things will be given to
[55:36] you as well
[55:37] Proverbs 3 5-6 say trust in the Lord
[55:40] with all your hearts
[55:42] and lean North on your own understanding
[55:46] one of the things that Satan wants us to
[55:48] do is lean on our understanding
[55:51] he wants us to lean on our understanding
[55:53] of ourselves
[55:55] of who we think we are
[56:00] he wants us to lean on our understanding
[56:03] of who we think we are and anything you
[56:06] think you are that is different from
[56:08] what God thinks you are is just a label
[56:12] your liberal is different from your
[56:14] identity
[56:16] your true identity is what God has said
[56:19] you are and when God has said it nothing
[56:22] changes it
[56:24] the only thing is that when I look away
[56:26] from the identity that God has said is
[56:29] mine then I'm depriving myself of the
[56:31] blessings of God
[56:35] don't lean on your own understanding in
[56:37] all your ways submit to him
[56:40] and it will make your paths straight
[56:44] Matthew 7 9 11 Jesus speaking here he
[56:47] said which of you if your son asks for
[56:49] bread
[56:50] will give him a stone
[56:52] or if he asks for a fish we'll give him
[56:54] a snake
[56:56] if you then though you are evil know how
[57:00] to give good gifts to your children
[57:04] not just gifts good gifts
[57:08] to your children
[57:09] how much more will your father in heaven
[57:12] give good gift to those who ask him
[57:17] if you have asked he's going to give it
[57:19] to you
[57:20] is he taking time don't don't worry he
[57:23] has the perfect timing
[57:26] not only does he have the perfect timing
[57:28] he has the perfect way sometimes all God
[57:31] is just doing is teaching you patience
[57:33] and what is patience is a total
[57:35] surrender to the will of God to the ways
[57:39] of God and to the time of God
[57:43] teaching you that full surrender
[57:45] amen you know if there's anything you
[57:48] want to ask for God to give to you
[57:50] just be prepared for it
[57:52] you know asking God to give you patience
[57:57] it takes a lot
[57:58] sometimes we use your spouse to teach
[58:00] you patience
[58:02] sometimes your children sometimes
[58:04] situations
[58:06] but can you be totally surrendered to
[58:08] the will of God
[58:10] to the ways of God how God wants it done
[58:12] to the time of God when he wants it done
[58:19] it will give you whatever you ask him
[58:21] second Corinthians 9 8 and God is able
[58:24] to bless you abundantly so that in all
[58:27] things
[58:28] at all times
[58:30] having all that you need you will abound
[58:34] in every good work
[58:36] God is able to bless you abundantly
[58:40] Psalm 34 10 he said the Lions
[58:43] May grow weak and hungry
[58:46] but those who seek the Lord will lack no
[58:50] good thing
[58:53] I've just revealed to you this morning
[58:54] brothers and sisters some of the things
[58:56] we have in this arcade
[58:58] that has been given to us
[59:00] there are so many more of them
[59:03] let's explore it
[59:05] and the one I would you know read
[59:07] finally is Romans 8.
[59:09] 30-39
[59:11] there's something
[59:13] that ever makes you feel
[59:16] dejected
[59:18] just go to this scripture
[59:20] he said moreover
[59:22] whom he did predestinate
[59:24] then he also called
[59:27] and only called then we also Justified
[59:29] and only Justified them he also
[59:32] glorified
[59:34] what shall we then say to these things
[59:38] if God be for us
[59:40] who can be against us
[59:43] many times we wonder we bother about
[59:46] those that are against us but one with
[59:49] God
[59:50] is the majority Hallelujah
[59:53] when you are with God
[59:55] let the entire world turn against you
[59:57] you're still in the majority
[1:00:00] he that spared not his own son
[1:00:03] but delivered him up for us all
[1:00:06] how shall he not with him also freely
[1:00:10] give us all things
[1:00:14] then he said You shall separate us from
[1:00:17] the love of Christ
[1:00:21] who shall separate us he gave a few
[1:00:23] examples
[1:00:25] shall tribulation
[1:00:27] or distress or persecution or farming or
[1:00:30] nakedness or Peril or sword
[1:00:33] and I'll say all temptation
[1:00:35] or failures
[1:00:38] is there something you can do that will
[1:00:40] make you be separated from the love of
[1:00:43] God if you are an elect of God
[1:00:47] he said nay in all things we have more
[1:00:50] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:00:52] us
[1:00:53] could not
[1:00:55] you know find other examples but you
[1:00:58] just wanted to put all all of it
[1:01:00] together and he said neither no he said
[1:01:02] he said they know things your modern
[1:01:04] conquerors dream that lovers
[1:01:08] um
[1:01:09] I'm sorry I think I missed the verse
[1:01:10] they'll just turn to that scripture
[1:01:13] and read it I know where Bible students
[1:01:16] and we know it
[1:01:18] none of the states he said for I am
[1:01:21] persuaded
[1:01:22] that neither death
[1:01:25] nor life No Angels no principalities no
[1:01:28] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:01:31] come nor height nor depth
[1:01:34] nor any
[1:01:36] other creature
[1:01:39] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:01:41] love of God
[1:01:42] which is in Christ Jesus alone
[1:01:45] nothing shall separate us
[1:01:49] I'll ask the musicians to come got two
[1:01:52] more quotes to read
[1:01:57] the expression of the grace of God
[1:01:59] in this end time
[1:02:02] we are special people
[1:02:05] we don't feel like it and in this court
[1:02:07] I'm going to read about the brown
[1:02:08] acknowledges that we don't feel like it
[1:02:13] this is from the church book Ephesians
[1:02:17] Church age
[1:02:19] but the RAM said you know we're speaking
[1:02:21] about the seven golden candlesticks
[1:02:24] he said in Exodus 25 31 it says and thou
[1:02:27] shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold
[1:02:30] of beating work shall the Candlestick be
[1:02:33] made is shafts and these branches his
[1:02:37] balls his knobs and his flowers shall be
[1:02:40] of the same
[1:02:42] now but the brand said the True Church
[1:02:44] of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to
[1:02:48] pure gold
[1:02:50] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:02:59] sometimes we want to create our own
[1:03:01] righteousness
[1:03:03] it's not acceptable
[1:03:06] when God is looking at you
[1:03:09] is not seeing you
[1:03:11] is seeing Christ
[1:03:14] he's seen the perfect sacrifice
[1:03:16] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:03:20] attributes
[1:03:22] our identity is found in him
[1:03:26] what he is she is to reflect
[1:03:33] what he has
[1:03:36] she is to manifest
[1:03:39] there is no fault in heart
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:44] are you hearing something about yourself
[1:03:46] this morning
[1:03:48] there is no fault
[1:03:50] in her you might see the false but he
[1:03:54] does not see it
[1:03:56] [Music]
[1:03:58] she's all glorious
[1:04:01] within and without
[1:04:05] whose reports will you believe this
[1:04:07] morning
[1:04:09] whose report are we going to believe
[1:04:12] any contrary report brothers and sisters
[1:04:15] is Satan's reports
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:21] we must get to that stage
[1:04:25] that will start to refute anything Satan
[1:04:28] says even if our senses confirm that it
[1:04:31] is the truth
[1:04:32] [Music]
[1:04:35] but Abraham said when this bride
[1:04:37] we realize who she is then she will
[1:04:41] become an invincible Army
[1:04:44] an army that cannot be conquered Satan
[1:04:47] knows that the secret lives with our
[1:04:50] realizing who she is and he continuously
[1:04:53] attacks our identity
[1:04:56] making artists believe our identity
[1:04:59] there is no fault in her she's all
[1:05:01] glorious within and without from
[1:05:04] beginning to ending she is the work of
[1:05:07] her Lord
[1:05:09] and all this works are perfect
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:14] he said in fact
[1:05:15] in her is summed up and manifested the
[1:05:20] Eternal wisdom and purpose of God
[1:05:24] in this bride in you my brother in you
[1:05:28] my sister is the summation of the
[1:05:31] Eternal plan of God didn't we read it
[1:05:33] that all that have gone beyond
[1:05:36] the curtain of time all these years over
[1:05:39] the years they are not perfect without
[1:05:42] us
[1:05:42] [Music]
[1:05:44] in our summed up and manifested internal
[1:05:47] reason and purpose of God the Bible said
[1:05:49] how can one fathom it
[1:05:52] how can one understand it
[1:05:55] Joe will cannot do that
[1:05:58] we can accept it by faith
[1:06:01] for God
[1:06:02] had spokenets
[1:06:04] we can't fathom it we can't understand
[1:06:07] it but one thing we can do we can accept
[1:06:10] it by faith because why God spoke it
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:19] the Patmos vision
[1:06:22] foreign
[1:06:24] do not fear
[1:06:27] don't fear a little flock
[1:06:31] all that I am
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:33] you are here to
[1:06:36] all my power is yours
[1:06:40] my omnipotence is yours
[1:06:42] as I stand in your midst
[1:06:45] I have not come to bring fear or failure
[1:06:49] but love
[1:06:51] and courage
[1:06:53] and ability
[1:06:55] all power is given me
[1:06:59] and it is yours to use
[1:07:04] you speak the word
[1:07:07] and I will perform it
[1:07:09] that is my Covenant
[1:07:12] and it can never fail
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:18] We rise up with me this morning
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:25] can we sing one of them
[1:07:28] one of them there are people almost

[1:15:47] glory be to God
[1:15:49] we sing one more song today maybe two
[1:15:53] we only just about 12 o'clock
[1:15:56] we could probably sing a few more
[1:15:59] I know it's not easy at home
[1:16:03] but when you get in his presence It's
[1:16:04] just tough to stop
[1:16:06] my goodness
[1:16:08] I'd like to sing Standing on the
[1:16:10] Promises of God if we could
[1:16:14] but as we tee that up
[1:16:17] just a couple of points that uh I
[1:16:19] believe were really good keys that we
[1:16:22] heard this morning
[1:16:23] I believe the Lord spoke to us
[1:16:26] and I trust that we'll have years to
[1:16:28] hear some of the things that he said
[1:16:32] you know brother Toby said I am pleased
[1:16:35] to know that he does not rely upon me
[1:16:39] for his promise to come to pass in our
[1:16:42] lives
[1:16:43] did you catch that point when he said
[1:16:45] that
[1:16:47] your label
[1:16:49] is different than your identity
[1:16:53] each one of these I feel like we could
[1:16:55] take a
[1:16:57] a long discussion
[1:17:00] many times our Earthly presence what we
[1:17:03] get into in our lives what we do here on
[1:17:06] Earth can become who we are and we begin
[1:17:09] to forget who we're supposed to be
[1:17:12] we forget who he sees us as
[1:17:15] because whatever it is that we do
[1:17:17] becomes our very essence
[1:17:20] and that's wrong
[1:17:22] and that's where God allows us to get
[1:17:24] into trials to get our attention to
[1:17:27] start to flip over all the stones in our
[1:17:29] lives and say Lord what's going on why
[1:17:32] the trial
[1:17:34] but it's so that we can remember that
[1:17:37] our label here on Earth is irrelevant
[1:17:39] it's absolutely irrelevant
[1:17:43] it's our identity and how we contend
[1:17:47] with such a plague of identity theft on
[1:17:51] this Earth if you look at it naturally
[1:17:53] and brother Bradham said the natural
[1:17:54] types of spiritual hate goodness sakes
[1:17:57] how Satan wants to take our identity I
[1:17:59] feel like we could just get started
[1:18:00] brother I'm telling you I was inspired
[1:18:03] today
[1:18:04] Hallelujah
[1:18:07] oh Standing on the Promises of Christ my
[1:18:11] king through Eternal ages let his
[1:18:15] Praises Ring glory in the highest I will
[1:18:20] shout and sing Standing on the Promises
