Oh, do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling? Not to wonder where you're going when you die. Oh, not condemned of the past, not afraid of what tomorrow holds in store. And you know the reason why. Oh, that's just how it is when you go down in the water. Cuz by faith you believe in what you heard. It's no impossible dream you can't start over clean. Oh, when you're washed by the water of the word. Are you wash by the water? By the water of the world. Oh, are you by the water? Oh, are you washed by the water? Oh, it's like being born again with a whole new life to live, never having to look back to what you've been. Aren't you glad his report is true? According to his word, you enjoyed your existence. And where he's concerned, there never was no sin. For when God looks your way, he no longer sees a sinner, but a saint who's been washed white as snow. It's not by anything we've done, but by the blood of God's own son. Oh, are you washed by the water of the word? Oh, your confession now. Yes, I'm wash by the water.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire tonight? &gt;&gt; Yes, we are. Not just tonight, but every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, we just want to go before the throne of grace. We have a couple of requests we wanted to bring. We have a request for Ruth and Peter in the Netherlands, the friends of the Livies, to be able to get accommodation and financing to be able to afford it. They actually have an opportunity to view a place on Wednesday and uh as I understand it will take a miracle for that to happen. This is a brother that had a stroke and uh I think he struggles to be able to provide. So it's going to take a miracle for that to happen and we're certainly thankful for that opportunity for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We also have a request for Sister Stella who is at home sick and uh it takes a lot to keep Sister Stella from the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we just want to ask the Lord to touch her body and raise her up as well. If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it known unto him. Gracious heavenly father, we're so thankful that Lord we know you as a living God. Lord Jesus, tonight we just are so thankful also that we can gather together in your name. Lord, we don't take it for granted as we see this world getting dark, darker, Lord, by the day. Father, we know that something else is taking place. And that's your quickening power in your bride. And Father, we thank you for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we recognize it. And Father, we just want to give you all the praise and glory for it, Lord. And tonight, Lord Jesus, we just want to remember each and every need that was made known unto you, Lord Jesus. Whether it was just in a heart, whether it was in a mind, whether it was behind an uplift hand to you, Father, whether in person here tonight or streaming somewhere else, we know that you're not bound by time or space, that you are ever present. Father, we just want to commit those needs into your hands, Father, that you would sovereignly meet them according to your will, which is your word. Father, tonight we want to remember the friends of the Livies in the Netherlands, Lord Jesus, Sister Ruth, and Brother Peter. We know they need a touch from you, Father. And we know that it's a miraculous touch, Father. You need to part the waters for them, Lord, is what we're asking for. And we know that you're more than able to do that. So we just thank you in advance, Father, for doing that. And we'll be careful to give you a praise report, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we just ask that you would watch over them, lead them and guide them, Father, in their their search for a place to live, Lord. And Father, we just want to remember Sister Stella who is at home ill in her body. We know that you said, "By my stripes, you are healed." &gt;&gt; And Father, we just claim that scripture for our sister. Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. We stand united together for her, Lord. And we just thank you for touching her even now, Lord, that she would feel reprieved in her body. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just look forward to the time when we can celebrate with her once again about the grace that you have given us. &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, as we turn to your word, we just commit the rest of this service into your hands for your glory. Just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians. Certainly wonderful to be in the house of the Lord again. I see we have a couple of visitors here. One of them I know is brother Joe from Melbourne, Australia. And uh right here, God bless you, brother. Apparently, he leaves tomorrow. Brother, I don't know your name, but certainly look forward to meeting you after service, Lord willing. If you have your Bibles, I have a couple of scriptures I would like to read. Like to go back to 2 Kings chapter 13. It's uh maybe getting old for some, but not me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I trust it's not for you. &gt;&gt; I just have another angle that I believe the Lord wanted me to go down. And so we're going to we're going to go there tonight out of 2 Kings chapter 13 and then over to First Corinthians chapter 15. Second Corinth 2 Kings chapter 13 and 1 Corinthians chapter 15. And it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the suppler of Elisha. And when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood up on his feet. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; For some, that's a historical account, a historical event. For others, I believe it is our present truth. over in 1 Corinthians chapter 15. 1 Corinthians 15 verse 41. There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars. For one star differth from another star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead. &gt;&gt; It is sown in corruption. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it is raised in incorruption. &gt;&gt; It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory. &gt;&gt; It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body. It is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body. As so it is written, the first man Adam was made a living soul. The last Adam was made a quickening spirit. &gt;&gt; How be it, that was not the first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy. The second man is the Lord from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. As is the earthy, so are they also that are earthy. Remember, to be carnally minded is emnity with God. &gt;&gt; And as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. I just love this. I've got Romans 8, five, and six in my Bible written here. Verse 49 says, "And as we have borne the image of the earthly, all of us, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly." &gt;&gt; Now, this is God's word. This isn't something that we're making up. This isn't even something that a man brought claiming to be God's prophet or other people claiming that he is God's prophet. This is the word of God. Someone has to fulfill this scripture here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just going to read this again. Verse 49. And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. &gt;&gt; Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither do corruption inherit incorruption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, we thank you for your word. Thank you Lord Jesus that this flesh cannot inherit incorruption. &gt;&gt; Oh father the creature groans from within Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And father we just ask we invite Lord we plead with you that your spirit would utter groanings from within our spirit Lord that Father it wouldn't be this flesh dictating our lives but that it would be your spirit reigning mortally in these bodies. Father, we just ask Lord Jesus that you would quicken this word to us tonight. Father, that you would quicken our mortal bodies to your word. Father, that Lord Jesus, we would hear one more time about ourselves, the selves, Lord, that you created before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Father, we just love you and we thank you. We just commit this word into your hands now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. I just think this scripture here is so beautiful. Tonight I want to talk about quickening power and it's quickening power by a quickening spirit. And uh we know that Elisha, he had a quickening power but that power was not his power and that power was not his spirit. It was a quickening spirit that was in and on Elisha. and verse 45 out of 1 Corinthians chapter 15. And so so it is written, the first man Adam was made a living soul. The last Adam was made a quickening spirit. And we know that last Adam was Jesus Christ and he is the word. And if you have the word in you, then you are a quickening spirit. I think it's just such a beautiful thought and uh I I looked to see I feel like I had talked on quickening power, the quickening spirit and uh the last time I did was 5 years ago. So I felt like it's probably okay for the leadership of the Lord to be taking me here again 5 years down the road. And uh I just trust that it's okay tonight. I looked to see if the scriptures were the same and and there was a little bit, but it was more about Romans chapter 8. And uh I think we could probably get into that a little bit, but I don't really have plans to tonight. This could be uh something that goes on for a little while. We'll just see what the Lord has in store. I just would like to uh say uh God bless you, brother John Smith. That is Sister Rebecca Snow's dad. He goes back home to Ontario on Friday. And it's been wonderful to have you with us. We wish God's blessings for you, brother. Please greet your wife and uh your pastor for us. And uh I'll have to say till we meet again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, did anybody enjoy the the weekend meetings? &gt;&gt; Boy, there was some uh there's some stuff to chew on in there. That's what I said to brother Andrew as we uh parted ways. You know, there's there's a lot for us to chew on probably till we meet him again next year in uh what happened over the weekend, but it was just a an incredible time of fellowship around the word of God. And I so appreciate to uh just sit and be fed as well. And uh you know, there's so many things that were said and it it could appear like brother Barry and brother Andrew had conversations. We talked about things going on in our lives and other people and we never did and uh never will. That's just not the way it works. But you know, it's the spirit of the Lord and uh it's just amazing when that happens because we have to realize we have to come to the place where we realize that when we get together like this, it is not about psychology. It's not about getting together and talking about one another and seeing how we can, you know, cobble together some quotes and uh maybe some scripture and try and address a need or something that we've talked about in the body. It it truly is a man coming from another place and preaching what the Lord placed on his heart. Every single time I shake his hand behind the pulpit, which I do with anyone that preaches here, if I introduce them, I shake their hand and I say, "Take your liberty. Let the Holy Spirit minister to us. &gt;&gt; It's not something that is pre-planned or coordinated. So, just a wonderful time of fellowship this weekend. You know, just love the thought. The first service on Friday night, we have a vindicated forecast and and we do have a vindicated forecast. There is an oncoming storm and this world is uh going through birth pains right now. It's amazing when we look around and see all the the things going on. But it just was so apparent to me today as I was really meditating on these thoughts, you know, how dark it's getting. And what that dark is going to do is eliminate the light that's inside the bride of Jesus Christ. This quickening power is getting stronger and stronger. The devil isn't getting greater and stronger in this world. Maybe he is. He's having success through all of his subjects in this world. But don't think for a second the bride is getting weaker &gt;&gt; because when the enemy comes in like a flood, what happens? &gt;&gt; The spirit of God raises a standard against that flood of the enemy. And that spirit that that that standard, I mean, that gets raised is truly the bride of Jesus Christ with the quickening power in her. &gt;&gt; And uh the devil, he wants to stop her. He wants to distract her. He wants to keep her down as long as he can because as soon as she goes up, he is thoroughly cast down. He has three and a half years to accomplish anything that he can ever do. And then he's going to be uh, you know, he's going to his demise. Revelations 20:10, uh, one of the favorite scriptures of mine, you know, where the beast and the false prophet are, that's where he's going to be cast into that lake of fire where there's torment. And the Bible says forever and ever. And I think it's just kind of nice to just pause and talk about this for a little while cuz the devil hates it. He knows it. He believes the word of God more than most theologians is what brother Brandham said. But you know, he's going to be in there for a space of time. It's not going to be eternal. There is no eternal hellfire because that would be life. And there's only one form of eternal life and that is Zoey, God's own life. And he's not going to torment for eternity. But the devil, he is going about as a roaring lion, see seeking whom he may devour. And uh you know, we've got a vindicated forecast and that is for there to be uh greater works done through this bride than what was done in the days of Jesus even. And it's not greater works in terms of someone being raised from the dead or so on and so forth. It's more. &gt;&gt; We have a prophet that said that it was actually more works. There's going to be more people raised from the dead. There's going to be more food supplied in situations where there isn't. There's going to be more situations worked out, complex problems that just can't be solved by by the comingings and goings of man &gt;&gt; that the Lord will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Marriages restored, &gt;&gt; children renewed, &gt;&gt; people coming back to the Lord. What is the greatest miracle of all, by the way? Let's just remind ourselves that the greatest miracle of all is that a human being could go from being a sinner born in sin shaped in iniquity coming into the world speaking lies to recognizing that they always were a son or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; My we have a vindicated forecast and that prophetic utterance is God speaking to his people. That is the weather forecast. the Holy Ghost speaking through his five-fold ministry, bringing his bride to perfection, the saints to perfection. It's the only provided way that God has done it. You know, we also heard on Saturday night the authority of the confession of the open book generation. It's a mouthful, but if you stand back and look at it and and think about it, the power of that statement, the authority of the confession of the open book generation. There is a generation of people on earth that believe there is an open book. &gt;&gt; But interestingly, there's some that believe, well, it's only partially opened. &gt;&gt; It's only partially open. And to some, they actually have a a firm, solid belief that that's all it is until God sends a prophet back to completely open it again. That's true that people believe that. It's not true that that's the case. But some people actually believe that it's partially open. Some don't believe that it's open at all. They believe that it's closed altogether. And the only people that could ever potentially do it is some theologian somewhere be able to reveal what's in the book. and and some read it and and they never are able to come to the knowledge of the truth. They're ever learning, always learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Why is that? Because they don't have revelation by the spirit of God. We know in the church age book, Brother Brandham said it very thoroughly, get in the spirit first. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't go through the acts. &gt;&gt; Get in the spirit first. &gt;&gt; And I say get the Holy Spirit. bring the Holy Spirit to the service and then get in the spirit, start to worship and see if God won't come around and actually begin to reveal change it from being head knowledge to actually a hard experience and that becomes a new book to us. But you know this book is an open book and uh it's just a wonderful thing. I I think that uh the last one was a doozy on Sunday and and that one really spoke to me and like I said I just claim it for myself because you know uh being a pastor is not an easy thing and I know that we all have jobs and we all have things in our lives. Some people would say that you know being a pastor you signed up for it so suck it up. And that's kind of like the same sort of statement that uh you know, brother Andrew said the I don't know what it was a fellowship one night someone it was a Sunday night I guess they were fellowshipping around and he said well I guess I I got to go I got to got to go to work in the morning. Some of us have real jobs and you know I I said wow maybe he was joking a little bit. He said he wasn't joking at all. And I know some people will do that and and maybe as a just a backhanded comment, as a fun thing, you know, I guess for some people backhanded comments are okay in general, but for others they're not at all. And uh you know, like uh I I certainly never chose to be a pastor in my life. I believe I was called to be one and I just wanted to follow the leadership of the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; And uh you know when the backhanded comments start to fly and and certain things happen, it can be very easy to actually internalize things and and internalize situations. And without the spirit of God coming around and actually scrubbing away those calluses, if if I'll say it my way, if I'm not careful, I can become callous. And I thought it was amazing the way he said it. He used the example of playing the guitar &gt;&gt; by doing what we do genuinely and earnestly. We can become callous. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If we're not careful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I say, "Lord, help me." &gt;&gt; I certainly don't want to lose the love &gt;&gt; for and to the people. &gt;&gt; And that was the title of the service on Sunday. lose not the love for and to the people. And you know, just being brothers and sisters in the church, we can have situations crop up and have them crop up and have them crop up and if we're not careful, we can become callous also. But I love how he said it too. You know, if we just go from church to church to church, the only thing we do is build up a callous and we realize that you know what, the problem isn't every individual church. Although when you're under the influence of that spirit, you do believe that every single church is flawed. And I heard uh I think it was Billy Graham say it. You know, if you ever go to a perfect church and you find a perfect church, you just made it imperfect. &gt;&gt; I thought that was such a notable statement. &gt;&gt; So beautiful. Because it's true. &gt;&gt; There is no perfect church. &gt;&gt; There's no perfect family. There's no perfect pastor. There's no perfect song leader. There's no perfect deacons. There's no perfect trustees. There are some perfect sound people. Nobody's perfect. &gt;&gt; And that's the way God chose to do it. That's why he wanted it that way. So that we wouldn't look to man. &gt;&gt; And when we try to make people perfect and then we say we get disappointed by it, why are we? The only reason is because we're not looking at Jesus. &gt;&gt; He wants us to look to him. And that's why he allows us to see the humanity. But we've got to not look at the flesh, not stumble at the veil. If we do that, then we're actually not doing our our our our brothers and our sisters a service. We're doing them a disservice because the word of God says to know no man after the flesh. &gt;&gt; But the calluses, they happen sometimes. I just thought it was so good by doing what we normally do. By doing the right things, we can get calluses. And it just really inspired me because you know if we just try and do things a little bit differently than maybe where the callus was actually building and building and building it can actually have a chance to rest and we can actually do things just a little bit differently. And then maybe we actually begin to build a little bit of a callus over here on this other hand or this other finger or this other way that we do things. And you know maybe it just balances out a little bit gives the other skin a little time to rejuvenate on our hearts. So, you know, doing things a little bit differently, I think, is very legitimately important because we can become callous just doing the same thing over and over again. And, you know, Brother Brandham says it and it's a it's a true statement. You know, doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result is what? &gt;&gt; It's the definition of insanity. So, let's not do that. Let's not become callous people. I'm talking to me. Just preaching to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, I just was thinking, you know, I'm kind of preaching in the mirror. I just want to say this. I'm certainly thankful. Are you thankful there's no CO now? &gt;&gt; And some people will say there's CO. It's around. We get sick from it. And Yep. I don't dispute that for a second. But what I am saying is that we're not mandated by CO as human beings. I was remembering preaching in the mirror when we had the &gt;&gt; It's like the glass here, the surround. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So bizarre to look at myself the whole service. But you know, we had have to have feelings and uh we don't want to go through life without feelings and uh we just need to check ourselves. I think it's important. I believe this weekend was a really good milestone for us maybe as a body. It was for me as a pastor just just to check and and see do I have a pulse? Have I become callous? Is there is there life inside of here? and and see if I I have care. I'm saying it my about me. I don't want to put on anyone else. Do I still have care for people? And and I say yes, I do. I I surely do. I'm not saying that I don't. But what I am saying is that if the Lord is going to rebuke me, I'm going to take it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say thank you, Lord, because I'm his son. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say, "Oh, it's got to be someone else. No way. That was for me. That service was entirely for me. Selfishly, I'm just going to claim it for myself. I can't just run to another church because I would just take my problems there. &gt;&gt; That's terrible. I wouldn't want to do that to anybody. &gt;&gt; But uh anyways, we just need to have feelings and maybe just check and see if we do have care and concern for others. The the weekend really spoke to me as you can tell. I I just couldn't wait to get behind the pulpit. I feel like there's so much that I could talk about, but I'm not going to. I just want to talk about our scripture tonight and the quickening power. And you know how the uh the life that was inside Elisha had gone. His spirit had gone, but the quickening power had not left those bones. The quickening power of the Lord Jesus Christ was still there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In him. You know in uh Colossians 2 verse 10 it says, "And ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power. in whom also ye are circumcised with a circumcision made without hands. The token, that's the token. The circumcision that's made without hands. We know that Israel had a sign in their flesh and that was the natural circumcision. We're not talking about that here. We're in the New Testament here talking about grace, about the circumcision that is made without hands, which is the token in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, the old man dying off, buried with him in baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives. So that it's literally that quickening power, the life of Jesus Christ inside of us, buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God. I I I I this gets me excited to think about it because many times we talk about the operation of of of the power in a certain circumstance or a situation. maybe the operation of the power in in some sort of a a government power or or maybe a municipal power, but we're not talking about humanity's power here. We're talking about the operation of God in our lives. It's the operation of God. I'm going to get into it a little bit later, but you know, I don't know, did I preach on proving his word? I don't know if I did or not, but you know, many times we want to prove his word, but it's not up to us to prove his word. It's up to him to prove his word. Alls we have to do is surrender ourselves, submit ourselves, subject ourselves one to another in the fear of God, and allow him to prove his word in our lives. But buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. So, just like that guy was tossed in on the bones of Elisha, that exact same quickening power has raised us from the dead. &gt;&gt; How has that happened? We have been given the earnest, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We've been given the down payment. Brother Brandham talked about it in his day. If you had 25 cents given to you, someone flipped you a quarter and you were hungry, you could say, "I caught it and now I potentially have that loaf of bread that I'm dying for because I'm so hungry." You're going to go and buy that loaf of bread maybe when you get off of work. You've got it. Same thing with our resurrection, brothers and sisters. That token in our life, that circumcision, not in the flesh, but of the old man gives us that token in our lives, it gives us resurrection. Verse 13 says, "And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, isn't this awesome? hath he quickened together with him. &gt;&gt; Having forgiven you all trespasses. &gt;&gt; So I can't read this and think, you know, there's any human being that would ever dare call themselves a Christian and hold on to any grudge with anyone. We know the word says that as we judge, that's how we're going to be judged. But I look at this and think about it. I just can't get past it to think that I I it was while I was living in my flesh. It was while I was dead in sins and and and trespasses, it says, "And the uncircumcision of your flesh." We know. We're going to go over to Ephesians chapter 2, and we'll read that in a bit. But this just gets me excited because it was when we were there, that he quickened us together with him. Having forgiven you all trespasses, not most of them or some of them, the ones that are the easiest to forgive, but all trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross. &gt;&gt; I just think, brothers and sisters, I wanted to try and remind us of this quickening power tonight. The devil wants us to think that this is for somewhere somewhere out in the future. Maybe it was for something in the past, but to maybe not see it manifesting in our lives. It's not working in our lives. I I hope it's working in our lives. But if you don't see it working in your lives, trust that it's working in your lives because something keeps holding you and causing you to come to the house of the Lord to worship in spirit and in truth. Even though we're in the darkest of days right now, we're in between the thoughts of men being continually evil in their hearts. &gt;&gt; They don't even believe that there's a God. And if there is a God, it's whatever god they decide to make it. &gt;&gt; And those folks think that it's okay to murder helpless babies as a form of birth control. I'm going to get started on that one of these days, and I'm not going to let up with it at all. And I I I'll say it this way. I really appreciate the way Charlie Kirk preached that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Abortion is evil. &gt;&gt; Abortion is wrong. Abortion is sinful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even if it's in the form of uh I'm not going to go too far with that, but I am going to say this, brothers and sisters. I think it's amazing how we live in an age where the thoughts in men are evil continually. And what is it? What's in it for me every step of the way? No matter what happens, if I get out of bed and put my feet on the floor, what is my reward? What's in it for me? If I drive across the city to go and do something, what's in it for me? If I pick up my phone and answer it because someone's calling me, what's in it for me? What's in it for me? It's the Leodysian church age. is the age in which we live in. But you know what brother Brandham said? Yeah. I'll say it this way. What the Holy Ghost said to you, brother Brandham, is eternal life is not what's in it for me. It's what's in it for everyone else because my life is for other people. Eternal life is living for others. &gt;&gt; But I just love this. He took a and made all of the ordinances that were against us, which were contrary to us, which were going to take us down, which would put us in the place, that lake of fire where Lucifer, Satan, that old serpent, the devil, is going to go out of Revelations 20:10. And his day has never been closer than it is today. It is the time is ticking. It's going fast. But all those ordinances that were against us are going to go upon him back into that lake of fire. It's beautiful. Verse 15 says, "And having spoiled principalities and powers, all of the powers of the enemy, all of the rulers of darkness, all of it has been spoiled completely." Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Triumphing over them in it. &gt;&gt; And I just think it's beautiful because how does he do it? He does it by living through us every single day. When we live this word, when we live the spirit of Christ, when we die to ourselves daily and allow him to live through us, he triumphs openly over the devil. Because who believes this word? &gt;&gt; Who could possibly believe this word? Only only the believers. Let's turn over to Ephesians. Ephesians chapter 2. I think it's so wonderful, so amazing talking about this quickening power being alive tonight in in the lives of every one of us as believers. This quickening power is enough to make us want to shout. I think Ephesians chapter 2, "And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins." Every single one of us were dead in trespasses and sins. Whether we came into this world through a message family and never had any exposure to the scars and troubles of this world or not, we had to come to a place of recognition that I was born in sin. I I was shaped in iniquity and and I came into this world speaking lies according to the word of God. and and I need a savior because without it I am actually the same as every other human being in this world and that's how they're judged whether you know it's amazing how brother Brandham would say this how the Holy Spirit would quicken brother Brandham God isn't going to judge us one day for what we've done he's going to judge those people for what they haven't done &gt;&gt; he's going to judge them for not accepting the way that he provided for them That's right. &gt;&gt; And in the day in which people lived in Noah's day, that was simply get in the boat. &gt;&gt; Just get in the ark. All you got to do is get in that boat. But we know that they were smarter, they were richer, they were they were more educated, whatever it was. And they said, "No way. We're just not going to do that. We'll just build our own. We'll do our own thing." We've heard it many times. But in the day in which we live, the only way, the only truth, the only life is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's all. That is our boat. That's our ark for today. And and if we're willing to go that way, then we will actually be able to see that we ourselves have been quickened, who are dead in trespasses and sins. Without that, we're going to think that we're okay. Everything in our life is fine. We're born in the message. We're raised in the message. We never went into the world sinning. We never did anything like that. But you know what? There's still one thing that's an evil devil that loves to hide. I'll say it plainly in message homes, in message churches. Forgive me for even saying it this way, but I have to. As a pastor, that thing is called pride. &gt;&gt; Pride. It is a devil. It's the worst sin of all because it hides in plain sight. People that have it, they don't believe they do. They think everything is fine. &gt;&gt; But everyone has to be quickened with quickening power. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just want to say tonight, brothers and sisters, hopefully if I sound maybe a little bit excited or a little bit rough, what I'm doing is I'm taking us and I'm trying to grab us and throw us on Elisha's bones, to throw us on this word of God, to throw us on this message to get that quickening power in our lives. Maybe there's someone here that doesn't have it. Maybe if we all got it, we'll all just be able to to sing and shout and and maybe have a little Pentecostal revival here. But for those people that maybe haven't experienced it, it is a real thing. This quickening power is fantastic. And you know the way it comes is simply by saying amen to the word. We heard it on the weekend just by being like Mary was. I don't have to explain it or understand it. I just need to say amen. Be it unto me according to the angel messenger's word. &gt;&gt; And when that happens, there's a life that happens. Conception happens. And that life is only one life. It's not a denomination. It's not a version of the message of the hour. It's not even the message of the hour, even though it is, but it's Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's what the message of the hour is. The Lord Jesus Christ. This quickening power that we're talking about. You hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins. Where in time past, ye walked according to the course of this world. Whether we were born in a perfect home and never had any problems, we still had to come to the place of accountability where we decide whether we want that baptism of the Holy Ghost or not. &gt;&gt; And if we choose not to, then what happens is we choose the mark of the beast &gt;&gt; because that's already in us. Remember Job said, "My skin worms, they're already in us. This flesh is already corrupt." wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is even the believers. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; We all have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's the differentiating factor. &gt;&gt; That is the difference. It's not because we're a part of a church. It's not because we're good people. If we grow up in a message home, the children get the baptism of the Holy Ghost through their parents for a space of time according to the message of the hour. That space of time is until the age of accountability. But as soon as that time comes where the child says, "I could do it or I don't want to do it." That's the accountability. &gt;&gt; That's where we need to say there is a dividing line. But I think it's beautiful because we can all say amen to these scriptures here. I believe. Verse four says, "But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved." &gt;&gt; Not because we've done anything, not because we've gone anywhere, because he called us before the foundation of the world. Verse six says, "And hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." How many people people feel like you're sitting in heaven right now? &gt;&gt; I don't feel like I'm sitting in heaven, but his word says that I am. So I say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; That's where I'm at. Satan doesn't want us believing that because he wants to be there and he will never be there because that spot specifically reserved for the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I think that's so beautiful. Verse seven, that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith because we have the faith in our hearts to mix with this word that's preached to us through our parents, through our church. Because we have that faith, we're able to say amen to the word and come to the recognition as children that we need to be baptized with the Holy Ghost. And when we are baptized with the Holy Ghost, we become quickened to this word for our day. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. By grace are you saved through faith. And that not of yourselves, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not of yourselves. Not of ourselves. &gt;&gt; It's the gift of God. &gt;&gt; It's not of works. lest any man should boast. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; He knew that we would. He just waits for the time. It's so amazing. It's beyond our reasoning. We can't even really comprehend it. So many people would say, "Well, you know, we could just eat and drink. might as well be Mary like everyone else. Doesn't matter. He's just going to save me anyways, right? No, we're free moral agents. And he knows who will and who won't. And if we truly are that predestined one, if we truly are going to be quickened by his spirit, we will be quickened by his spirit. We will not put it off. For we are as workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. &gt;&gt; Wherefore remember that ye being in times past, Gentiles, every one of us here in the flesh, who are called the uncircumcision, by that which is called the circumcision of the flesh, made by hands, that at that time ye were without Christ before the Holy Ghost in our lives. Even though we know the word of God, without the Holy Ghost in our lives, we're aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. I think it's beautiful. I might have sounded hard on families, but you know, parents that do have the Holy Ghost, you are the Holy Ghost for your children. So the children are not lost even though we read it that way. If the children choose to reject getting the Holy Ghost, then that fits them. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh with the blood of Christ. &gt;&gt; Now I have to say this. I do believe it with all my heart that even though a child maybe a child would actually grow up in a message home and have the desire to serve God with all their heart and actually take the steps towards God and truly get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins so that they could receive the baptism of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and and then maybe go a little bit weward because something happened. Maybe there's offenses that came. Maybe something happens in their life and they just don't see it yet. There's a time appointed of the father. We heard about it on the weekend. At that point, you can run, but you cannot hide from God. &gt;&gt; He will always find his children. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; We're not lost. That's &gt;&gt; right. Verse 14 says, "For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh the emnity even the law of commandments contained in the ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man." So making peace. Remember the very first order of business when Christ was on the cross and he bowed his head and said it's finished and gave up the ghost. He didn't just go up into heaven. He didn't go visit a friend. He went right into the temple and tore that veil and said there is now therefore no condemnation to those who walk after the spirit who are in Christ Jesus. I think it's just a beautiful thing. I hope it's okay if I just read this tonight just for this portion. Verse 16 says, "And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the emnity thereby." He did it and came and preached peace to you which were a far off and to them that were nigh. Some were far and some were nigh. But everyone needed to have peace preached to them. It's so beautiful. For through him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father. Now therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ himself, being the chief cornerstone, in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit. That is why we are here. So that we can be a habitation of God by his spirit. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; You know, I was looking up this word quickening and quickening power. It has quickening power specifically has 103 hits in the message search and uh it just I think it's neat to see some of these things. It's just maybe silly uh quirky, but it's neat. Quickening power 103 hits in a message search one time in 1963 and all the rest of them are in 1965. Brother Brandham never talked about quickening power before the seals were open. &gt;&gt; Interesting. I believe it was kind of save for a time and a season. You know, I I just want to talk about the titles for a little bit here. I got a couple quotes that I'm going to bring. I don't know if it actually went through to the brothers. Did you get it? No. I always do that. It's in uh The Rising of the Sun. you'll be able to get them quite easily. But 1963, Brother Bradom, he preaches three kinds of believers. It's mentioned in there, quickening power. 1965 is all the rest of them. And and you know what's interesting? There's one, two, three, four, five, six messages that it's mentioned. Quickening power after 1963. Three kinds of believers at 1963. It is the rising of the sun, 1965. Does God ever change his mind about his word? Isn't that beautiful? If you think about it, quickening power, that quickening power that's given to us in and us who were once dead in sins and trespasses, hath he quickened. H we've raised up to sit with him in heavenly places by his quickening power. Does God ever change his mind about his word? He says it in here. Nope, he doesn't. And you know, he talks about it in that message about Balam and Bailac and how the prophet he he he wanted to be rich. He wanted to be famous and and the king wanted to find a way to curse Israel. And we know the story very well. And he asked God and God said no. First time he said no. And then he went and asked God again because he was wooed by the king. You know, we'll make you rich and famous. You know, we know the story. &gt;&gt; Went and asked God and God said, "Hey, you know what? Go." Sounds like he changed his mind. But the prophet in the day in which we live, he said, "God doesn't change his mind. He sticks with his word." What he does is he allows his permissive will and then he turns it into his perfect will. But does God ever change his mind about his word? Not about you. Not about I. Praise the Lord. The next one is God's provided place of worship is Jesus Christ. This message of the hour, God's provided place of worship. It's not a denomination. It's not a destination. It is Jesus Christ himself. And you know, I I think the next one is so beautiful. It's proving his word. He talks about quickening power in that one. And brother Brandham, I I just love the way he brings it. It's such a simple way. He says how you can actually solve a problem in math. If you actually work it out on paper and you solve the problem, you can actually prove the problem by the answer that you come up with. You can actually reverse engineer it back to the actual question, the problem. And I think it's just a wonderful thing sometimes in life uh even as a believer it's important to be able to actually let him prove his word in our life but then actually prove that it was him proving his word &gt;&gt; by the way the answer comes. The last one that he talks about is thinking man's filter. And uh it's just beautiful just little quirky thing to talk about the uh trivia I guess if you will about how the the the Lord dealt with his prophet in in the ministry of his prophet and and how it was near the end of his ministry that he began talking about quickening power. And I just hope that's not the same for me. But you know what? The Lord's will will be done. And uh whatever he wants to have happen is just beautiful. It's going to happen exactly the way he wants it to happen. In paragraph 269 out of it is the rising of the sun in 1965. He says, "Now then that fellow picked up that robe." And he's talking about Elisha. Now then that fellow picked up that robe. A type of the church again. See, picked up that robe. And you know, there's a lot of folks that got into the anointings of Elijah and Elisha and John the Baptist and they started to talk about mantels and getting into that business and you know there's there's prayer cloths and that's it. That's the way Paul did it in the New Testament and you can pray over handkerchiefs and you know what there's prayer cloths and they actually there's something about it. I'm not going to say there's power in the cloth. What I am going to say is there's power in the faith of the individual that gets that prayer cloth or or handkerchief. There is and and the prayer over those can actually increase when the person gets it and believes the same way that Paul taught it and uh praying over handkerchiefs. But anyways, I'm saying all this to say that there's people that want to get into the mantle and so on and so forth. But I think it's beautiful when we just look at this. I think the mantle is a type of the message. The message is a type of the mantle. And you know, Elisha, he he he understood that his his prophet, his master was going to go home. And and he watched it happen. And he was given a promise. He could have whatever he asked, and he said, "I want a double portion of that." I can't help but think that's the life of a believer. We would want a double portion of that as well. And and we know that's the promise for us. John 14:12. But in this quote here, he says, "Now then that fellow picked up that robe, a type of the church." Again, see, picked up that robe. Now he'd done twice the miracles which is a type of Christ and the church. See Elijah done four. He done eight. See now he was he was double the power cuz he asked for it. Now he didn't have twice as much strength spiritually speaking. He just did twice as many. I think it's really important to see that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. John John 14:12 that it's exactly the type right here between Elijah and Elisha. Elijah done four, he done eight. He says, "Greater things than this shall I do shall you do." See, but he was so full of the quickening power and everything till he done all these double what Elisha done more than he did. And notice that he lived a life on up till 80 or 90 years old. He got old and he died. He died and they took him out and buried him. You know, well, that quickening power didn't leave him many, many years after that when the flesh had all rotted off his bones. He was laying in a tomb and they were packing a dead man one day and they saw the enemy and they just throwed this man in on the top of Elisha's bones. I love the way he dramatizes it, don't you? Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know, I don't believe there was any power on his bones. I believe there was an anointing maybe around his bones. Maybe some people would say in his bones. The prophet said their power was there. I'm not here to split hairs over that. What I do want to say is this spiritually, scripturally is typing the reminder that there's still power in the word of a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though that prophet has passed on, he's gone on to his reward. There is still just as much power in that word, that prophetic utterance that came forward because it wasn't the prophets. That anointing was a prophetic utterance from God through his vindicated prophet to the age in which he lived. And this is an exact example, a type of what that is. And they were packing a dead man one day and they saw that enemy and they just throwed this man on the top of Elisha's bones. There was so much quickening power on those bones till the man jumped up to life again. Oh, it'll quicken your mortal body, though dead and rotten in the grave. And yet that quickening power rested over that dirt. I say, Lord, rest over this dirt tonight. Just just rest over me. &gt;&gt; My though dead and rotten in the grave. And yet that quickening power rested over that dirt. Hallelujah. He that raised up Christ from the dead also quickened your mortal body. The Elijah back there, Elisha. And Elijah, remember that dead man, that prophet full of the quickening power laying in the grave and rotted away. There was so much quickening power till they throwed a dead man on him and he come to life. He could still lay hands on the sick, couldn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. There you are. And remember, we are flesh of his flesh. Are we flesh of his flesh? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, we are flesh of his flesh and bones of his bones. &gt;&gt; I got reading this today and just about had a little jubilee myself. You know, I was thinking about it and what what kind of swept over me and it might sound really corny, but I'm going to say it anyways. I think what we're doing here when we gather together this way is just making a reminder that you know what there is a wedding. &gt;&gt; There's a wedding that's taking place and that's taking place. Some people are already married and they're already well past hopefully not the honeymoon, but they're well on their way to to go into the marriage supper. And there's other people that are still entering the church to go down the aisle. And tonight, this is a type of the invitation for those people to come up to the altar and get married to the Lord Jesus Christ for themselves because this is the visible union of the bride of Jesus Christ and the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say it that way even though the prophet said it's the invisible union. The invisible union is taking the book and eating it up. The visible union is that it changes us. We become a new creature in Christ Jesus because it's Christ Jesus living out for through us. We're no longer saying what's in it for me in our lives. We are flesh of his flesh, Jesus Christ. We are flesh of his flesh and bones of his bones. There's no way out of it. &gt;&gt; So if there was quickening power in a dead man with all his flesh rotted off, what about us today when we got flesh and bones life living out through us? Whose life is it? He says, "We're going to rise and that's all." You're going to rise. That's all. I love how he says it twice. Easter means more than just a tradition. Now, some would say this is just an Easter Easter message. And sure enough, he he did preach it at Easter. He also preached the Easter seal. But, you know, every single day of our lives is an Easter, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ in the life of his believers, we don't just wait for one day out of the year to celebrate his birth and and one day out of the year to celebrate his death and resurrection. No, it's every single day. Every single day of our lives. He goes on to say, "And this body may rot in the sea. It may rot in the ground. There may be not a spoonful of ashes, but she's coming forth." &gt;&gt; Amen. I just love it because even if we can't see it, even if we don't understand it, even if we don't feel like it, &gt;&gt; there's a prophetic utterance that says it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God through his prophet to this age said it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's coming forth. &gt;&gt; For the spirit that raised up my Lord from the dead has quickened this mortal body. It's the greatest experience. It's the greatest miracle when we can become a new creature in Christ Jesus. It really is. Seeing someone raised from the dead is one thing, but boy oh boy, when when you become a new creature in Christ Jesus, it changes everything. But she's coming forth. He says, "For the spirit that raised up my Lord from the dead has quickened this mortal body. It's quickened your mortal body." It does something to us. And that's where I I think it's so beautiful. While I was getting into this before I went down to Ohio, and that is the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. You know, he says in the church age book that, you know, the the the mysteries contained in those seals, it will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers. Literally. We'll probably get into a little bit on Sunday, but what does that mean? I I think it's beautiful. If we just go and read the book of Acts, I I believe that's exactly what it is. And I believe brother Brandham even says that, you know, they'll write another book of Acts behind it when that branch puts when that tree puts forth another branch. But she's coming forth. He says, "For the spirit that raised up my Lord from the dead is quickened this mortal body." It's quickening your mortal body. And we are his beneficiaries of his resurrection. We have the earnest of his his resurrection in our lives. We have that quarter. We have that token. We can go and buy that loaf of bread. Amen. &gt;&gt; His policy of eternal life that I talk so much about, you know, no wonder he said, "Fear not." &gt;&gt; For as Paul said, "Death, where is your sting grave? Where is your victory? I'm full of quickening power." You know, when the doctor says you're going to die, you can say, "No, I'm not. Maybe I got to lay this flesh down, but who cares? &gt;&gt; To live is Christ, and to die is gain." Amen. &gt;&gt; But when the devil comes around and says, "You're going to die." Paul said, "Death, where is your sting?" Do we believe like Paul tonight? &gt;&gt; Are we able to say that in the face of the devil when he comes around and says that through a doctor? Death, where is your sting? Grave, where is your victory? I'm full of quickening power. &gt;&gt; I'm full of quickening power. If God wants me to live, I can't die. Right. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen cuz I'm full of quickening power. And you know, brothers and sisters, that quickening power is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Barry harps on it. That's what we're talking about. That's what this whole message is about. Getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's what Noah's message was about. Get in the boat. Tonight, we're saying get in the boat. Get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And And if you got it, that's great. But if you don't, get it. Get it with all you're getting. Just like we had Solomon here in Proverbs say, "You need to get understanding, my son. Incline thyself to my words. Listen to what I'm telling you. Follow instruction and get wisdom. Get it with all thy getting." That wisdom is not just knowledge. You know, we we were my Paul said, "Death, where is your sting? Grave, where is your victory? I'm full of quickening power. Thanks be to God who gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. Quickening power. Oh my. Just made me think, you know, Daniel 11 at the end time, right near the end, Daniel had an opportunity to see. John was able to see. We heard about it on the weekend. Daniel was told, "You know what, Daniel? It's not for you. It's not for you in your day. Just don't worry. You're going to live to be a full age. Everything is going to be fine for you. Just just just look away. Go your way. It's for someone else in another time somewhere down the road. John was told, "Seal up those things because they're not for you." &gt;&gt; But you know, Daniel in the book of Daniel, he says something really interesting. He gave us a little snippet. I think it's beautiful. He allowed one thing to come through that that would happen that we would be able to understand. And it's Daniel 11:32. And it says, "A, and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries." And we know that's going on with the Catholic Church. That's what he's talking about in here, the beast system. He's going to corrupt by flatteries. And it's just like that in the world. But the people that do know their God shall be strong &gt;&gt; and do exploits. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're not going to be weak. They're they're not going to be downtrodden. They're not going to be underhandedly treated in the life in which they're living. And you know, we have this opportunity and I personally believe it that is exactly the way the prophet said it. There is going to be a sudden secret going away of the bride. It's not going to be uh bolt-action semiotic automatic rifles. There's no such thing as that, by the way. But it's not going to be weaponry chasing people and hunting them down like dogs to push them into the rapture of the church. Brother Brandham has asked the question, what are they going to preach after the rapture? And what does he say? Do you remember? &gt;&gt; They're going to preach the same thing. &gt;&gt; That's why they're not on the rapture. &gt;&gt; They're going to think that they're saved. Going on baptizing, singing, thinking they're getting saved, and the church of the living God has already gone home. She's already gone to the wedding supper, to the marriage supper. And we know that the word says they're going to cry and lament and say, 'Lord, open to us. Come on. We need your spirit. We need more of you. And he's going to say, "You had your chance, man. There was no nothing hindering you. You had the full open word. You had all of the message apps on your phone. You had it on your computers. You had churches wide open. You could worship in spirit and in truth without hindrance. &gt;&gt; But you chose not to." &gt;&gt; What a place to be. But there's some some people that do know their God. I think it's beautiful. And that's who we're talking to tonight. And and she's strong and and she does exploits. &gt;&gt; She does exploits. We're not looking for mighty signs and wonders. We live them. &gt;&gt; We are them. &gt;&gt; If you are a believer of this word, you know what I'm talking about. There's things in your life that you can't explain. They just happen. &gt;&gt; Because that's the God we serve. I'll call them musicians. Paragraph 294, Brother Brandham, he says that same quickening power of God, that same quickening power of God presented in both of these prophets, look at their names are almost the same. Elisha, Elijah. I love how he does this. See, the bride and the groom, one of them is Mr. Jesus, the other one is Mrs. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. You see almost the same just between the he and she. See Elijah and look how it's represented here. Now Elisha was taken up in the rapture represents the church. All right. Elijah and Elisha rested until the resurrection. See it's just like a bird needs two wings to balance herself. See, the church was represented right there in those two prophets. For we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not hinder them which are asleep. For the trumpet of God shall sound. I love how brother Brandham says this now. I'm I'm I'm not going to be able to finish, but I'm just going to do this. I'm going to say it this way. Isn't it interesting that brother Brandham in the message the rapture he says he goes into it he talks about in Thessalonians the shout the voice and the trump of God but in here when he's talking about this quickening power this level of quickening power he's only talking about the trumpet of God because the shout and the voice have already taken place and that's why there is a quickening power brothers and sisters you know he says it we read about it or heard about it on the weekend sometimes you got to read between the lines but why isn't he saying here at this level of his message that first there's a shout, then there's a voice. It's just the trump of God. That's all that's going to take place. For we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not hinder them which are asleep. For the trumpet of God shall sound. Both wings shall come together and will fly away. Hallelujah. Fly away. Cuz what? In the living or dead, that quickening power still lives. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; That's out of It is the rising of the sun. I I've got so much more here. I'm I would just keep going. I don't want to keep us late tonight. I know we're back in the rhythm of school and the pressures of life. And brothers and sisters, I just want to encourage us to remember who we are. As dark as this world gets, don't let it get you down. &gt;&gt; Let's not become callous. &gt;&gt; Let's not lose feeling of love one for another and and the consideration and concern for one another. The devil wants us to do that. He wants us to get just distracted and hung up on a situation or a problem and a circumstance and just get us going over and over and over on that. And as long as we'll do that, we're just distracted from recognizing that quickening power is inside of us. When that happens, just remember it's a devil. He's the one that comes in and tries to break unity. And if we have a distraction like that, just remember it's a devil. And all we have to do is rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ. We don't have to yell and scream. We don't have to kick our feet and stomp. We just have to soundly rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And remember that you have this quickening power in your life. We're not looking for the shout. We're not even looking for the voice. We're just looking for the trump of God in the day in which we live. If you listen to the message, the rapture, you'll hear Brother Bradom explain that very clearly. Maybe stand with me as we close tonight. That same quickening power of God is in you and I. Let's just bow. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for this quickening power. Lord, we know that it's truly your spirit. It's the baptism of your Holy Spirit that's only given by full obedience to your complete word. That's what entitles us to the token. And Father, we just thank you for that, Lord. Thank you for the revelation that you give us, Lord. the quickening power of your word to our souls, Father, that that gives us the understanding, Lord, the the the the finite understanding that we are the ones that you have called, not by anything that we've done, Lord. Oh, Father, lest we boast, just knowing that you have done it all for us, Lord. You paid the price. And father, you took all of our sin, all of our transgression, and nailed it to your cross. Oh, Father, how could we ever thank you enough? Lord Jesus, we just ask that you would go with us now as we go our separate ways. Father, I pray that we would just consider this quickening power in our lives and Lord, how we're able to display it in this world, Father. Lord, that we would recognize that when people see us, they're not actually seeing us. They're seeing you. When people persecute us, they're not actually persecuting us. They're persecuting you, oh, Father. And when people speak ill of us, they're not actually speaking ill of us. They're speaking ill of you, Father. I pray that each and every one of us would truly have the baptism of your Holy Spirit. And father, if there's anybody here tonight that doesn't, Father, know you and the power of your resurrection and this quickening power. Oh, Father, I pray that tonight would be the night, Father, that they would begin to consider that the gift is for them as well. And Father, any one of us that maybe has just become distracted in our lives, Lord, and maybe has just let things slip a little bit, Father, help us to just raise our cup unto you, Father, and invite you, Lord, to just top us up even right now before we leave this building that we would have enough of that quickening power in our lives, Father. You told us through your prophet to this generation that we need more quickening power, more faith in this age than any other age because it takes rapturing faith, Lord. Oh, Father, the only way that's going to happen is by your spirit. We pray that you would just be with us, Lord. Keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways. Thank you for touching Sister Stella. Lord, thank you for meeting the needs of our friends in the Netherlands. Oh, Father, thank you for meeting each and every need behind the uplift hands tonight. We just commit them all into your hands now for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus. [Music] Look full in his wonderful face.
