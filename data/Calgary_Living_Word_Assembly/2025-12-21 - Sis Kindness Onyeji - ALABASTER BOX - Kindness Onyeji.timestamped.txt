[0:42] The room grew still as she made her way
[0:46] to Jesus.
[0:49] She stumbled
[0:50] through the tears that made her blind.
[0:57] She felt such pain.
[1:01] Some spoke in anger.
[1:04] Her folks whispered,
[1:07] "There's no place here for your kind."
[1:13] But still on she came
[1:16] through the shame that flushed her face
[1:20] until at last she knelt before
[1:25] his feet.
[1:28] And though she spoke no words,
[1:32] everything she said was hers.
[1:35] as she poured her love for the master
[1:39] from her box of alabaster.
[1:45] And I've come to pour
[1:49] my praise on him like oil
[1:54] from Mary's
[1:56] alaster.
[2:03] Please don't be angry if I wash his feet
[2:07] with my tears
[2:09] and I'll dry them
[2:12] with my hand.
[2:18] You went there
[2:21] the night he found me.
[2:25] You did not feel what I felt when he
[2:29] wrapped his love arms around me. And you
[2:35] don't know the curse of the oil and my
[2:40] alabaster.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48] See, I can't forget
[2:53] the way life used to be. See, I was a
[2:57] prisoner to the sin that had me bound.
[3:04] And I spent my days.
[3:08] I poured my life without measure into a
[3:12] little treasure box. I thought I found
[3:20] until the day when Jesus came to me and
[3:25] he healed my soul
[3:28] with the wonder of his touch.
[3:33] So now I'm giving back to him all the
[3:38] praise he's worthy of. See, I've been
[3:41] forgi.
[3:43] And that's why I love him so much.
[3:51] I've come to pour
[3:54] my praise onto him like oil
[4:00] from Mary's
[4:02] alabaster bus.
[4:07] So please don't be angry if I wash his
[4:11] feet with my tears
[4:14] and I dry them
[4:16] with my hair.
[4:22] She were there
[4:26] the night he found me.
[4:30] You did not feel what I felt when he
[4:34] wrapped his loving arms around me. And
[4:39] you don't know the curse of my oil.
[4:46] You don't know the curse of my praise.
[4:54] You don't know the curse of the oil.
[5:00] In my head,
[5:06] but
[5:12] ooh.
