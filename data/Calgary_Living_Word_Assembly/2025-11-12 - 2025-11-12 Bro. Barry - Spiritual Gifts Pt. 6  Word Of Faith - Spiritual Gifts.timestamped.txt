[19:21] Father, many times we don't even feel

[19:26] and circumstances, [music]
[19:28] Lord. But, Father, we've learned even in

[27:38] Hearing the prophet this week again,

[27:45] baby to life in Elizabeth's womb with
[27:46] the first mention of Jesus name, what
[27:48] ought it to do to a redeemed son and
[27:51] daughter of God." That's the truth. I

[27:54] evening. So wonderful to give him
[27:57] praise. So wonderful to give him honor.
[27:59] He's so worthy. He There is no rival.

[36:53] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[36:54] tonight we thank you that we can come
[36:57] unto you, Lord, with all of our needs.
[37:01] Father, we just want to ask Lord Jesus
[37:04] that you would be with Sister Janet
[37:06] tonight. Father, our sister, Lord, who
[37:09] is so faithful in [music] your house. We
[37:12] pray that you would just send your angel
[37:15] by her way, Father, that you would touch
[37:17] her in the name of Jesus Christ, that
[37:20] you would lift her up, Father. Lord
[37:22] Jesus, we know that we're not even
[37:25] worthy for you to come under our our
[37:27] roof, Lord. But, Father, just speak the
[37:30] word. Just one word from you, Father.
[37:32] And we know that you've come in the age
[37:35] in which we live in, Father. And you've
[37:37] [music] even changed it from the way
[37:38] that centurion spoke the word to you,
[37:40] Father.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; You said, "Why cry? Speak."
[37:45] &gt;&gt; So tonight, we just thank you for
[37:47] healing Sister Janet, in the name of
[37:49] Jesus Christ.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just commit each and
[37:53] every need, Lord Jesus, that's behind
[37:56] every [music] uplift hand to you,
[37:57] Father.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; That you would sovereignly meet the
[38:00] needs tonight, Lord. [music]
[38:02] And we know, Father, there's many needs
[38:03] that aren't even manifested, [music]
[38:06] Lord, behind an uplift hand. We know
[38:08] that you know them. And we pray that
[38:10] according to your will, Father, that you
[38:13] would manifest those needs, Lord, that
[38:15] you would bring them to pass, Lord, that
[38:18] you would provide a way not to go around
[38:21] them or under them, Father, but to go
[38:23] through them.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; To be that fourth man in the fire, Lord
[38:27] Jesus,
[38:28] &gt;&gt; for us in our lives. Lord, we'll be
[38:31] careful to give you the praise. Father,
[38:33] we thank you for touching the
[38:35] carpenter's friend. Lord, that one who
[38:37] had a daughter whose heart or her lungs,
[38:41] Father, were riddled [music] with cancer
[38:42] and there wasn't much hope from the
[38:44] doctor's perspective. But now she's back
[38:47] home
[38:48] &gt;&gt; and the doctor's report is that it's a
[38:50] miracle.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for touching her in
[38:53] the name of Jesus.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; You deserve all the glory.
[38:58] Father, tonight we just love you and we
[39:00] thank you. We just commit this service
[39:02] and each [music] life into your hands
[39:04] now, Father, for your glory. In Jesus
[39:07] Christ's name we pray.

[39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[39:14] Welcome to our visitors. Certainly good
[39:17] to have you with us once again.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, I'd like to
[39:22] read from 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[39:27] talking about spiritual gifts once again
[39:29] tonight. We'll take another step
[39:32] forward.
[39:33] Probably uh wind up hovering here for a
[39:37] little while. I can't see how we could
[39:40] just go past this one, but [snorts]
[39:42] we'll start with 1 Corinthians 12:1.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Love how the spirit speaks to the
[39:51] age to the [clears throat] first church
[39:53] age messenger setting the pattern for
[39:55] the church in every other age.
[39:59] And that concerning spiritual gifts,
[40:02] brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
[40:04] This is not something that we're
[40:06] supposed to be wondering at, that we're
[40:08] supposed to be confused about. According
[40:10] to the scripture, the spirit saying,
[40:13] "Now concerning spiritual gifts,
[40:14] brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
[40:19] You know that ye were Gentiles carried
[40:21] away unto these dumb idols, even as ye
[40:24] were led. Wherefore I give you to
[40:27] understand
[40:29] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[40:31] God calleth Jesus a cursed
[40:35] &gt;&gt; and that no man can say that Jesus is
[40:38] the Lord but by the Holy Ghost.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Now there are diversities of gifts but
[40:45] the same spirit.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; And there are differences of
[40:48] administrations.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. but the same Lord.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; And there are diversities of operations,
[40:56] but it is the same God which workketh
[40:59] all in all.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; But the manifestation of the spirit is
[41:03] given to every man to profit with all.
[41:08] So it's not just for an exclusive bunch.
[41:11] It's not just for the ministry. It's not
[41:14] just for anyone specifically other than
[41:18] everyone. anyone who would be a son or a
[41:22] daughter of God. Verse eight, for to one
[41:25] is given by the spirit the word of
[41:27] wisdom, to another the word of knowledge
[41:31] by the same Spirit,
[41:33] to another faith by the same Spirit, to
[41:36] another the gifts of healing by the same
[41:39] Spirit. to another the working of
[41:42] miracles. To another prophecy, to
[41:46] another discerning of spirits, to
[41:49] another diverse kinds of tongues, to
[41:53] another the interpretation of tongues.
[41:56] But all these workketh that one and the
[41:59] selfsame spirit, dividing to every man
[42:03] severally as he will.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. For as the body is one and hath
[42:08] many members, and all the members of
[42:11] that one body,
[42:13] being many, are one body,
[42:17] &gt;&gt; so also is Christ.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; For by one spirit are we all baptized
[42:23] into one body.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
[42:27] we be bond or free, and have been all
[42:30] made to drink into one spirit.
[42:33] For the body is not one member but many.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[42:41] Father, we thank you for your word and
[42:43] we thank you for your spirit, Lord
[42:45] Jesus, that you have given to profit
[42:48] every man with all.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we pray that we could
[42:52] approach your word tonight by your
[42:54] spirit, Lord. that it wouldn't be
[42:56] through carnality, that it wouldn't be
[42:59] Lord Jesus the uncction of man, but it
[43:01] would truly be by your leadership,
[43:04] &gt;&gt; by your Holy Ghost,
[43:06] &gt;&gt; by the person of Jesus Christ. Tonight,
[43:09] we invite you, Lord, to have the
[43:10] preeminence now. Have the preeminence,
[43:13] Lord, in our hearts, in our minds, and
[43:15] in our mouths. We just commit the rest
[43:18] of this service into your hands for your
[43:20] glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[43:22] Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[43:25] seated.
[43:27] Just uh
[43:30] another scripture I would like to read
[43:31] if we could just turn over to Hebrews
[43:34] chapter 11
[43:37] talking about
[43:39] faith tonight out of verse 9 to another
[43:42] faith by the same spirit.
[43:45] Hebrews chapter 11. While you turn
[43:47] there, I just want to go over some
[43:49] announcements. We've got brother Cadre
[43:51] Diggs coming Saturday the 22nd and
[43:53] Sunday the 23rd. He'll be here at 6:00
[43:56] p.m. on Saturday night. Remember the
[44:00] graduation celebration. If you would
[44:02] like to celebrate, I ask that you would
[44:05] reach out to me directly. If you have
[44:07] graduated and not been appreciated by
[44:10] the body, we certainly want to provide
[44:12] that opportunity.
[44:14] Over in December, I will be traveling to
[44:17] Grand Prairie the first weekend. I have
[44:19] been invited to come by brother Darren
[44:21] Ber and I believe they could use a
[44:24] little encouragement. So I'm gonna I'm
[44:26] going to go up there and just see them.
[44:28] And my understanding is that a lot of
[44:30] the ministers, if not all of the
[44:32] ministers have moved to Edmonton. So I
[44:36] think that brother Darren's feeling a
[44:37] little bit isolated and uh we'll go and
[44:41] give him some love. So he's invited me
[44:43] to come and take three services Friday,
[44:45] Saturday, and Sunday. And uh so that'll
[44:48] be really good if you don't mind just
[44:49] praying for us that we could bring some
[44:51] real encouragement by the word. That's
[44:53] that's my desire. And uh brother Don
[44:56] Snow has uh agreed to take the service
[45:00] on Sunday the 7th of December. So
[45:04] certainly pray for him as well. We have
[45:06] the youth service on Friday the 12th.
[45:09] That'll be at 7:30 here in the
[45:10] sanctuary. We have the youth event after
[45:13] service on the 21st. And uh on the 31st
[45:16] we will have a worship communion
[45:18] service. And uh it's a Wednesday
[45:21] evening. So I'm I'm happy that Christmas
[45:23] and New Year's are falling the way they
[45:26] are this year. It's certainly nice to to
[45:28] not have strange days during the week
[45:31] where it just interrupts everything.
[45:33] Even though the Christmas season does
[45:34] that anyways, uh it's just nice to have
[45:37] regular service days. Are you happy
[45:40] tonight?
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly nice to be in the
[45:42] presence of the Lord and uh we're
[45:44] certainly thankful that we have this
[45:45] word over in the book of Hebrews. This
[45:48] is the chapter of faith. And uh I think
[45:51] this is why I'm saying we could spend a
[45:53] lot of time on this one gift in the
[45:58] body. But I just wanted to sort of point
[46:01] this part out as we get going with this
[46:03] discussion of the gift of faith because
[46:06] it truly is a gift. Um in Hebrews 11:1
[46:10] it says, "Now faith is the substance of
[46:14] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[46:15] not seen." And we know brother Brham, he
[46:17] preaches on this and he says that faith
[46:20] is a substance. It is something. It is
[46:23] not intangible. It is just as real as
[46:26] you and I are real. And we know that in
[46:30] the very first message that brother
[46:31] Brandham has as a recording in faith is
[46:34] the substance. I mean, we could take
[46:36] that message and study that one out, but
[46:38] I'm not going to tonight. But I am going
[46:40] to point out the fact there was that
[46:42] girl that had that really, really
[46:44] serious, I think it was appendicitis,
[46:46] and she could not travel even travel to
[46:49] the hospital because if she did, it
[46:50] would rupture. And so, she needed a
[46:53] touch from the Lord. That was the only
[46:54] thing that would heal her body that
[46:56] would fix her in that moment. Even a
[46:59] doctor at that time couldn't fix her.
[47:01] But brother Brandham said to her, "Do
[47:03] you have faith?" and and she said, "Of
[47:04] course I have faith. I'm a Christian.
[47:07] Don't you know that that I've got
[47:09] faith?" And and he said, "Yeah, you
[47:10] don't have faith." And she got really
[47:12] challenged and upset by it. And uh if
[47:15] you go back and and you listen to that
[47:16] message, you can't really hear it
[47:18] clearly, but you can read along with it.
[47:20] Brother Brandham talks about how he said
[47:22] to her, "Okay, if you can see while
[47:24] you're laying there in that bed, if you
[47:26] can see that chain that's hanging from
[47:28] the light, I would like you to take that
[47:30] faith that you have and move that chain
[47:34] &gt;&gt; with your faith. Move that chain." And
[47:35] she said, "I can't do it." And he said,
[47:38] "Well, how can you have faith then if
[47:39] you can't move that chain?" And she
[47:41] said, "Well, no one can." And he said,
[47:43] "Yes, I can. I can do it with my faith."
[47:46] And she said, "No, you can't. It's
[47:47] spiritualism if you can." And he said,
[47:49] "Just watch." And he said, "He made it
[47:51] move one way and then he made it move
[47:53] back the other way with the faith that
[47:54] he had." And she called it spiritualism.
[47:57] And he said, "No, that's the spirit of
[47:58] the Lord." But we know that she was able
[48:01] to actually listen to the prophet
[48:04] through all of that. And there was a
[48:05] healing that came to her body. But faith
[48:07] is something that's more real than what
[48:10] we can even imagine.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; And you know, it all has to do with
[48:16] believing or not believing.
[48:19] And fear is probably the biggest
[48:20] hindrance to faith, isn't it?
[48:23] &gt;&gt; And why is it? Because we don't want to
[48:25] actually have faith for something and
[48:27] speak for something and then not see it
[48:29] come to pass the way that we speak it.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; But what we need to do, I believe, is
[48:34] work on speaking things that the word of
[48:36] God says that we should speak
[48:38] &gt;&gt; and and trusting the Lord, saying, "Be
[48:40] it unto me according to your will, which
[48:42] is your word." not actually trying to
[48:44] wave a wand and make God dance for us.
[48:46] Make him do things that is outside of
[48:48] his word. I if we want him to do
[48:51] something, we need him to do it
[48:52] according to the way he wants to do it.
[48:54] But that's that's a different story, a
[48:56] different discussion. Faith is the
[48:58] substance of things hoped for, the
[48:59] things that we hope for. That's faith.
[49:02] And the evidence of things not seen. How
[49:04] could we have have have faith that we
[49:07] actually have salvation for our bodies?
[49:10] That we're actually going to be saved
[49:12] should we have to actually go by the way
[49:14] of the grave. That is substance. Nobody
[49:18] can talk you out of it. I'm sure there's
[49:20] nobody here tonight in this audience
[49:22] that could be talked out of your
[49:23] salvation. That somebody could come
[49:25] around and say you you know what? When
[49:27] you die, you're just going to just cease
[49:29] to exist. You're just going to vanish
[49:30] and that's it. There's nothing more.
[49:32] Nobody in this room, even the smallest
[49:35] child, is going to say, "Get lost
[49:37] because I believe." Why is that? Because
[49:39] there's a substance.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; That faith is something more than just
[49:44] an idea or an ideology. It's something.
[49:47] And I think it's a gift.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going with it tonight.
[49:51] But Hebrews 11 chapter
[49:54] 11 verse one. Now faith is the substance
[49:57] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[49:58] things not seen. For by it the elders
[50:02] obtained a good report.
[50:05] [clears throat]
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful when we look back at
[50:06] all of the elders
[50:08] &gt;&gt; and how they lived their lives serving
[50:10] the Lord, serving the Lord according to
[50:12] his word, believing the Lord according
[50:14] to this message. The faith that they
[50:17] had, that substance of faith that they
[50:19] had obtained them a good report. People
[50:23] can say, "Look at those brothers.
[50:25] They've served the Lord for 40, 50, 60,
[50:29] 70 years and nothing has changed them.
[50:32] They still love the Lord just as much as
[50:34] they did. Maybe more today than ever.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; There's a substance to their faith.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; They've obtained a good report. Verse
[50:42] three says, "Through faith, we
[50:45] understand that the worlds were framed
[50:47] by the word of God."
[50:49] Genesis 1:1,
[50:52] &gt;&gt; in the beginning,
[50:54] God said. And we know that that's all of
[50:57] creation. God said, God said, God said,
[51:01] &gt;&gt; through faith, we understand that the
[51:03] worlds were framed by the word of God,
[51:07] so that the things which are seen were
[51:09] not made of things which do appear.
[51:14] By faith, Abel offered unto God a more
[51:17] excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which
[51:20] he obtained witness that he was
[51:23] righteous.
[51:25] God testifying of his gifts. Can you
[51:28] imagine that?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; God testifying of your gifts.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; What was the gifts that he had? It
[51:35] wasn't necessarily the lamb that he
[51:37] chopped the neck of that brother
[51:38] Brandham talked about and upset the
[51:40] formal program of his brother who
[51:42] brought all of the beautiful flowers and
[51:45] fruits of the field. It wasn't
[51:47] necessarily that. It was the revelation.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; And so tonight, if we've got a
[51:51] revelation about faith,
[51:54] I just can't help but think that God
[51:56] testifies of our gifts, too, doesn't he?
[51:57] Amen.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; By faith, Abel offered unto God a more
[52:02] excellent sacrifice than Cain, which he
[52:05] obtained witness that he was righteous.
[52:07] God testifying of his gifts, and by it
[52:10] he being dead, yet speaketh. By faith
[52:14] Enoch was translated that he should not
[52:16] see death, and was not found, because
[52:18] God had translated him. For before his
[52:22] translation, he had this testimony.
[52:26] Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; So beautiful that he pleased God.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; You know, David, a man after God's own
[52:34] heart. He pleased God also.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Why was that? Why was he a man after
[52:40] God's own heart? I just feel so
[52:42] impressed to go down this road. It's so
[52:44] important to remember this, brothers and
[52:46] sisters, because this flesh is never
[52:48] going to be perfect.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; The perfection that we read about in the
[52:51] Bible is not about this flesh. It's
[52:53] about maturity of the spirit. Being
[52:56] complete is actually the definition.
[52:58] Completeness. That is maturity.
[53:01] Adoption. We can say it many different
[53:04] ways, but you know, the testimony that
[53:08] pleases God is the one that's willing to
[53:10] be quick to repent.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Understanding that we need grace.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; We could look at the bums on the street
[53:17] maybe and say, "Oh my, they need grace."
[53:19] We could look at the people that maybe
[53:21] just have superior blind spots and we
[53:23] could say, "Oh my, they need grace."
[53:25] &gt;&gt; But what we need to do is not be like
[53:27] that publican in the temple.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; We need to actually beat our chest and
[53:32] hang our heads and say, "Lord, forgive
[53:34] me."
[53:36] &gt;&gt; And that will be pleasing to God.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "But without faith, it
[53:42] is impossible to please him." Without
[53:45] faith, it's impossible to please him. So
[53:47] if we can have head knowledge and and
[53:49] understanding and wisdom and knowledge,
[53:52] we can have those gifts without
[53:54] revelation of faith in our lives, we're
[53:56] not pleasing God because it's not about
[53:59] knowledge. It's not about learning and
[54:01] it's not about understanding. It's about
[54:03] faith.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; It's all about faith. Being able to say,
[54:06] "Be it unto me according to thy word. I
[54:08] believe it." That's all.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. I maybe even can't
[54:13] even understand it. We don't have to.
[54:15] The only thing we got to do is believe
[54:16] it. That's why the prophet's theme song
[54:18] was only believe
[54:20] &gt;&gt; around the world seven times. Only
[54:22] believe. ALL THINGS are possible.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; It's so beautiful. But without faith, it
[54:29] is impossible to please him. For he that
[54:31] cometh to God must believe that he is
[54:35] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[54:37] diligently seek him.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; You know, I just think it's so important
[54:43] for us, brothers and sisters, to
[54:45] remember that he is
[54:47] &gt;&gt; not was not will be. He is.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; He's very, very aware of every single
[54:53] situation in this building tonight. He's
[54:56] very aware of every situation that's not
[54:58] in this building tonight. Like, like I I
[55:00] I've said it before, I don't even know
[55:02] if I could express it the way that I
[55:03] just sometimes see it and and feel it.
[55:06] like to think that you know the the the
[55:09] days of Micaiah, the prophet Micaiah
[55:11] when Ahab and and and Jehoshaphat were
[55:15] going to go and take Syria, take back
[55:16] the land from Syria, the Syrians, that
[55:18] whole story. And and we know that the
[55:20] prophet Micaiah said, you know, I I seen
[55:23] I I could see the vision in heaven.
[55:25] There was a throne set in heaven and and
[55:27] and the Lord sitting on the throne said,
[55:30] "Who can get my word, my will to come to
[55:33] pass in the life of Ahab?" And we know
[55:35] there was a prophecy that had gone forth
[55:36] about Ahab when he finally stepped over
[55:39] the line listening to his wife, not
[55:41] actually taking correction from the
[55:42] word, which was the prophet. But we know
[55:45] that there was actually a council in
[55:47] heaven about that one situation. Brother
[55:49] Brandham says it very clearly that there
[55:52] is a council in heaven for you. So to
[55:55] think about over 8 billion people
[55:57] happening in this world thinking and
[55:59] dreaming and talking and acting and
[56:01] living their lives. Every single one of
[56:04] those situations
[56:06] is in a council before God.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Nothing is happening outside of God
[56:11] saying yes, no, yes, no. We know brother
[56:16] Bradom said that he knows every single
[56:17] flea that's on the earth, every single
[56:19] time it will bat its eye and how much
[56:21] tallow comes off it.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] We know the word says that every single
[56:26] hair on our head is numbered.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; How do we explain that? How do we
[56:30] understand that? We don't. We just have
[56:33] faith.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; The word says it. Therefore, I believe
[56:37] it. And that settles it.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; But he is. Present tense. I am.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; He is. And that he is a rewarder of them
[56:49] that diligently seek him.
[56:51] But this faith, where does it come from?
[56:54] Where does faith come from? If we need
[56:56] faith if it is a gift, where does it
[56:59] come from? I I just thought it was
[57:00] really good to uh to talk about it, you
[57:03] know, and and how does faith grow? How
[57:05] does our faith grow? Where does it come
[57:06] from? It comes from this right here.
[57:08] This what we're doing right now, the
[57:10] five-fold ministry, the anointing of the
[57:12] Holy Ghost through a ministry. Not me,
[57:15] not my ministry, his ministry.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost ministry. by the
[57:21] believers pulling on the word of God,
[57:23] coming expecting, coming and worshiping,
[57:26] coming believing by faith that he is and
[57:29] that he's a rewarder of those who
[57:31] diligently fight their way across the
[57:33] city on a Wednesday night
[57:35] &gt;&gt; to be in service for the king
[57:38] &gt;&gt; so that they can get something from him
[57:40] &gt;&gt; because of faith.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; But how does faith grow? By
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Romans 10 verse 17. So then faith cometh
[57:49] by hearing and hearing
[57:51] &gt;&gt; by the word of God.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; That's how faith comes.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; So if we need more faith, brothers and
[57:57] sisters, I want to say tonight, you're
[57:59] on the right track.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; We're on the right track because we're
[58:01] coming to hear the word and the word of
[58:04] God. Not just the word of Brother Barry,
[58:06] not just hearing, but hearing by the
[58:08] word of God. So it's not even just
[58:11] hearing.
[58:13] It's beautiful how this scripture is
[58:14] written because it's hearing by the word
[58:18] of God. I saw a little a little video
[58:21] and I think there's some really neat
[58:22] videos. It makes me think of brother
[58:24] Mvin every single time. It's the story
[58:26] of Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones
[58:29] and how God says to him, "Son of man,
[58:31] can these bones live?"
[58:34] [laughter] And then he says to him,
[58:35] "Speak to these bones and tell them."
[58:38] But how could they ever hear? There's
[58:40] there's no ears. It's the spirit of the
[58:43] Lord. It's hearing by the word. And what
[58:46] word is it? It's the word of the
[58:48] vindicated prophet. It's not the
[58:50] prophet's word. It's God's word through
[58:52] that prophet to the age
[58:55] &gt;&gt; which will give us faith
[58:57] &gt;&gt; that will change our bodies.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; That will turn us from dry bones
[59:03] &gt;&gt; with ears that don't even have the
[59:05] ability to really hear
[59:07] &gt;&gt; to be able to hear this word and say
[59:09] amen. That's just so beautiful. You
[59:11] know, in in Matthew chapter 13, maybe
[59:13] let's turn over there tonight. Matthew
[59:15] chapter 13.
[59:18] We've got a fair bit of time so far.
[59:21] Matthew chapter 13.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 13. We know the
[59:34] disciples were listening to Jesus talk
[59:35] in parables and and talk in parables and
[59:38] talk in parables and they finally had to
[59:40] say something to him in in verse 9 here.
[59:43] Jesus, you know, he talks about the
[59:45] seeds falling in in the ground. And I'm
[59:48] not going to really read too much of
[59:50] that, but in verse 9, he says, "Who hath
[59:52] ears to hear? Let him hear." And we know
[59:54] that's the admonition to every single
[59:56] church age, isn't it? He that hath an
[59:58] ear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:00:01] to the church.
[1:00:03] But verse 9 says, "He who hath ears to
[1:00:07] hear, let him hear." And we know this is
[1:00:09] Jesus talking. But then his disciples
[1:00:12] came and said unto him, verse 10, "Why
[1:00:14] speak thou unto them in parables?"
[1:00:18] Why do you speak in parables? He
[1:00:20] answered and said unto them.
[1:00:24] Isn't it beautiful what he said unto
[1:00:26] them? because it's given unto you
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:00:32] heaven
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; but to them it is not given.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; For whosoever hath to him shall be given
[1:00:40] and he shall have more abundance but
[1:00:43] whosoever hath not from him shall be
[1:00:47] taken away even that he hath.
[1:00:51] I can just imagine as he's telling these
[1:00:53] disciples these words, he's just
[1:00:55] confounding them even further. He's not
[1:00:58] giving them a straight answer.
[1:01:01] He says in verse 13, "Therefore speak I
[1:01:04] to them in parables,
[1:01:07] because they seeing see not, and hearing
[1:01:11] they hear not, neither do they
[1:01:13] understand. Yet they can see just fine
[1:01:15] with their eyes and they can hear just
[1:01:18] fine with their ears, but they're not
[1:01:20] hearing with their heart and they're not
[1:01:22] seeing with their heart. And that's what
[1:01:23] the problem is. They have no faith to
[1:01:25] mix with the word that's coming from the
[1:01:28] Lord.
[1:01:29] Verse 14 says, "And in them is fulfilled
[1:01:32] the prophecy of Isaiah,
[1:01:35] which saith, by hearing ye shall hear
[1:01:38] and not
[1:01:40] understand, and seeing ye shall see and
[1:01:43] not perceive.
[1:01:45] For this people's heart is waxed gross,
[1:01:48] and their ears are dull of hearing, and
[1:01:51] their eyes they have closed, lest at any
[1:01:55] time they should see with their eyes,
[1:01:56] and hear with their ears, and should
[1:01:58] understand with their heart, and should
[1:02:01] be converted, and I should heal them.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; My
[1:02:08] there's a whole group of people in this
[1:02:09] world, brothers and sisters, that fit
[1:02:11] that category.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And they claim Jesus Christ.
[1:02:15] They do.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; But there's a special group of people.
[1:02:19] And I believe he's talking to them. In
[1:02:21] verse 16, he says, "But blessed are your
[1:02:24] eyes,
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; for they see, and your ears, for they
[1:02:28] hear.
[1:02:30] For verily I say unto you, that many
[1:02:32] prophets and righteous men have desired
[1:02:35] to see those things which ye see and
[1:02:38] have not seen them, and to hear those
[1:02:41] things which ye hear and have not heard
[1:02:44] them.
[1:02:46] You know, as we read this, I just can't
[1:02:48] help but think even right now in the
[1:02:50] moment, Brother Brham would desire to be
[1:02:54] standing here on earth looking upon the
[1:02:56] word as we are tonight. Did you ever
[1:02:59] think about that?
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't bring another word, but he
[1:03:03] would desire to be this far down the
[1:03:05] road because HE KNOWS HOW CLOSE
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; HOW CLOSE THE COMING OF the Lord is.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; I picked up a little nuggie in one of
[1:03:13] the messages I'm going to bring tonight.
[1:03:15] It's just a little nugget. It's really
[1:03:17] interesting to to read it and and and I
[1:03:20] heard brother Brandham say it. I had to
[1:03:21] stop and rewind it and play it and stop
[1:03:23] and rewind it and play it. And I'm going
[1:03:25] to I'm going to get into it. But to
[1:03:27] think about the the position we are in
[1:03:29] time right at the very end. We know all
[1:03:32] of the prophets, all of the sages, all
[1:03:35] the people that believe Jesus would
[1:03:37] desire to see the word in the fullness
[1:03:39] that we have it here tonight. It's
[1:03:42] amazing to think about.
[1:03:45] But in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[1:03:47] Isaiah, which saith, "By hearing ye
[1:03:50] shall hear and shall not understand, and
[1:03:53] seeing you shall see and not perceive."
[1:03:57] Tonight, brothers and sisters, if we
[1:03:59] have faith,
[1:04:01] you can have anything you want.
[1:04:05] [laughter]
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; If you have faith, you can have anything
[1:04:09] you want. Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; If you haven't got faith,
[1:04:14] you can't receive nothing.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Not brother Barry's words. That's the
[1:04:20] words of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; through a vindicated prophet to this
[1:04:23] age.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; If you have faith, you can have anything
[1:04:29] you want.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; If you haven't got faith, you can't
[1:04:33] receive nothing.
[1:04:36] Now, some people are going to have faith
[1:04:39] to have money and investments and
[1:04:42] portfolios,
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; and that's going to do nothing for us
[1:04:47] when the fire falls.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; If anything, it will potentially put us
[1:04:52] in the fire, and we'll have to do some
[1:04:54] refining. But some people want to have
[1:04:57] fame. Some people want to be
[1:05:00] influencers.
[1:05:01] Some people want their image everywhere.
[1:05:06] Some people just want to have ears to
[1:05:07] hear.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And a heart to receive.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; If you have faith, you can have anything
[1:05:13] you want.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And so here, when we have words like
[1:05:17] this, we're not talking about saying, "I
[1:05:20] just really want this and I just really
[1:05:22] want that." And he said that if I really
[1:05:24] wanted, I could have anything that I
[1:05:25] want if I could just maybe get enough
[1:05:27] faith. So, I'm just going to go to
[1:05:28] church and I'm going to I'm going to go
[1:05:30] and and hear hearing the word of God.
[1:05:32] I'm going to go to sleep playing the
[1:05:33] word and I'm going to I'm going to live
[1:05:35] my life playing the word. It's just
[1:05:36] going to be continually hearing the word
[1:05:39] of God so that I can have that kind of
[1:05:40] faith to get whatever I want. That's not
[1:05:43] what we're talking about at all.
[1:05:45] That's not at all what he's talking
[1:05:47] about. He's talking about if you have
[1:05:49] something that's a need in your life
[1:05:50] because he says, I I'll also supply all
[1:05:53] of your needs
[1:05:55] according to my riches in Christ Jesus.
[1:05:57] Right?
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Not the stuff that we think we want in
[1:06:00] this world. And this world is set up to
[1:06:02] make us think that we really need some
[1:06:04] stuff.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of stuff that we need.
[1:06:07] There's a lot of really cool gear that
[1:06:09] we need. There's a lot of maybe musical
[1:06:12] instruments that we need. Maybe there's
[1:06:14] clothing or cars or whatever.
[1:06:18] What do we really need?
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; We really need the word of God.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Because the word of God will actually
[1:06:25] supply all of our needs.
[1:06:27] But if we have faith, we can have
[1:06:29] anything that we want.
[1:06:31] If you haven't got faith, you can't
[1:06:33] receive nothing. Because without faith,
[1:06:36] it's impossible to please God. If we're
[1:06:38] not going to please God, we're not going
[1:06:39] to see the results that we want. Because
[1:06:42] if we don't have faith, we're not going
[1:06:44] to have salvation. How can we have
[1:06:46] salvation without having faith? It's one
[1:06:49] of the biggest things. And then we can
[1:06:51] get into healing for our bodies. I think
[1:06:55] before we want healing in our bodies, we
[1:06:57] want healing in our souls. And isn't it
[1:06:59] interesting that that's what brother
[1:07:00] Brandham would say before he would talk
[1:07:02] to anybody, if you want healing in a
[1:07:03] prayer line, not just you want healing,
[1:07:05] okay, let's just make sure that you get
[1:07:07] good and healed. He would say no. Can
[1:07:09] you accept Jesus as your savior?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Can you take him as your Lord first?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; First things first.
[1:07:18] But if we've got faith, you can have
[1:07:20] anything you want. And the things that
[1:07:21] you'll want will be according to the
[1:07:23] spirit of God. It won't be according to
[1:07:24] the lust of the flesh. We're not going
[1:07:26] to be like the scripture in James where
[1:07:27] we ask a miss because we ask according
[1:07:29] to the lust of our flesh or the lust of
[1:07:32] our eyes or the pride of our life. We're
[1:07:35] not going to do that. We're going to ask
[1:07:36] according to the spirit of God.
[1:07:38] You know, 1965
[1:07:41] talking about faith. Really good.
[1:07:43] Really, really good. Works is faith
[1:07:45] expressed. This is a curveball. Sorry,
[1:07:47] buddy. One of those last minute
[1:07:49] inspirations. Notice Jesus has said only
[1:07:53] believe for all things are possible to
[1:07:57] them that believe.
[1:08:01] Faith and works are husband and wife.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; They work together.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Faith and works are husband and wife.
[1:08:16] They work together.
[1:08:18] The husband works with the wife, the
[1:08:22] wife with the husband.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; They identify one another.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; They're not identifying themselves.
[1:08:32] We know that that love vaunteth not
[1:08:36] itself.
[1:08:38] It's not puffed up. It's not me and her.
[1:08:44] No, it's us,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; We know that our marriage here on earth
[1:08:50] is a type of our spiritual relationship
[1:08:54] with God.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; That's a quote. Brother Brandham says
[1:08:57] that. That's not just brother Barry.
[1:08:58] Brother Brandham says that. But here in
[1:09:00] this quote, he says, notice Jesus has
[1:09:02] said, "Only believe, for all things are
[1:09:03] possible to them that believe. Faith and
[1:09:05] works are husband and wife. They work
[1:09:07] together. The husband works with the
[1:09:08] wife, the wife with the husband. They
[1:09:11] identify one another.
[1:09:14] Like a man says he's married and yet he
[1:09:17] can't produce and show that he has a
[1:09:20] wife,
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; You doubt his claims. Mhm.
[1:09:25] Ma'am said, "I'm married."
[1:09:28] Where's your wife? Oh. Oh, I I don't
[1:09:33] know about that. See, see, he says be
[1:09:37] kind of hard thing for me to believe
[1:09:39] him. I I say, "Where's your wife?"
[1:09:41] "Well, I don't know. I I ain't going to
[1:09:45] believe it. So you see, if you have what
[1:09:49] you say you have, I have faith.
[1:09:53] How you going to show you got faith?
[1:09:57] How you going to show me you got faith?
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; By your works. See,
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; I'm married. How do I know you're
[1:10:06] married? This is my wife. See, there you
[1:10:10] are. I am married. This is my husband.
[1:10:15] I am healed.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; How do you know? My works show my faith.
[1:10:21] See
[1:10:24] now what what you're speaking of. Your
[1:10:26] faith is what God sees in you.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Your works is what the other people see
[1:10:32] in you.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; God sees your faith. Yes.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; I think it's sometimes I think as a
[1:10:40] Christian we get that backwards. I know
[1:10:42] I have. I've thought that I need to try
[1:10:45] and show people my faith. I need to tell
[1:10:49] them about my faith. I need to express
[1:10:51] to them my faith. When probably really
[1:10:54] what I need to do is just show them my
[1:10:56] faith by the life that I live. I don't
[1:10:58] need to talk. I don't need to tell them
[1:10:59] I'm a Christian. I don't need to tell
[1:11:01] them I'm praying for this. I don't need
[1:11:02] to tell tell. Alls I need to do is live,
[1:11:05] live, live.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; According to the spirit that's living
[1:11:08] out through me,
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; my works shows my faith. See
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; now what you're speaking of. Your faith
[1:11:14] is what God sees in you. Your works is
[1:11:16] what other people see in you.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; That's for difference between James and
[1:11:20] Paul here explaining about Abraham. They
[1:11:23] never contradicted one another. They was
[1:11:25] both the same married. So is faith that
[1:11:29] doesn't produce works. Anyone has a
[1:11:32] right to doubt your testimony.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; So, we need to be careful if we're going
[1:11:37] to go and say, "I'm a Christian. I'm a
[1:11:39] Christian. I'm a Christian. I'm a
[1:11:41] message believer. This is me. This is
[1:11:44] me." The first time we stumble, they're
[1:11:46] going to be like, "Uh-huh. Look at you.
[1:11:49] You're just like everyone else." But
[1:11:51] when we actually just live our lives,
[1:11:54] I'm not saying don't witness. What I am
[1:11:56] saying is be careful how we witness.
[1:12:00] Sometimes I think when we try and
[1:12:02] express our faith to people
[1:12:05] sometimes what we do is we show them a
[1:12:07] fig leaf
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; because it's our religion. It's the
[1:12:12] thing that covers us and it does.
[1:12:16] Someday I'm going to get into preaching
[1:12:17] it because God did make a covering.
[1:12:20] Brothers and sisters, when I say that
[1:12:23] all the time about a fig leaf, the fig
[1:12:24] leaf is the wrong covering, but God gave
[1:12:27] them the right covering. And that was
[1:12:28] under the blood of a shed animal
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; under the covenant of bulls and goats
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; right up until the cross right up until
[1:12:38] Calvary. That was the real deal. That's
[1:12:40] what God gave them.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; But another quote, the first one that I
[1:12:46] gave in the email tonight. Now, this is
[1:12:48] another one. This is out of Why Cry
[1:12:50] Speak? If you want to maybe hear where
[1:12:53] inspiration's coming from, it's just
[1:12:55] wonderful. out of why cry speak brother
[1:12:58] Brad I'm talking about Moses and how he
[1:13:00] was born he he he was born as a proper
[1:13:03] child he was born with a gift of faith
[1:13:08] great faith Moses had he says we see it
[1:13:12] after a while coming out in him brother
[1:13:14] Brandham says we see it coming out in
[1:13:17] him and how do we see it coming out in
[1:13:19] him many different ways there's a few
[1:13:21] different ways and we're going to
[1:13:22] probably get into it a little bit
[1:13:23] further but I just want to say this
[1:13:25] tonight brothers and sisters Remember,
[1:13:27] when we get over there, we're going to
[1:13:29] say, "How did you do it, Moses?
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; How did you do it, Noah? How did you go
[1:13:36] up there on the hill and and beat on the
[1:13:38] wood and pitch it within and without and
[1:13:40] get all the animals and and and and
[1:13:43] David and Daniel and all of those heroes
[1:13:46] of the Bible?" And they're going to say,
[1:13:48] "Sh,
[1:13:50] how did you make it?
[1:13:52] How did you get through Le Oysia into
[1:13:56] the bride age? How did you get to the
[1:13:58] place where you could overcome
[1:14:01] all of the lid of hell being taken off
[1:14:04] and all of the temptation that could
[1:14:06] ever be poured out on this earth? You
[1:14:09] overcame it.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU get here? Tell us your
[1:14:13] testimony.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Moses was born with a gift of faith. But
[1:14:17] I just can't help but think, brothers
[1:14:19] and sisters, we have been born with just
[1:14:21] as great a gift of faith
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; to be able to believe the word in the
[1:14:25] day in which we live. This world is not
[1:14:27] set up for believers.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; This world is is a garden. It's a it's
[1:14:33] an Eden for unbelief. And that's where
[1:14:36] we are. That's what we're born into. But
[1:14:38] somehow someway, we have the ability to
[1:14:41] have ears to hear what the spirit says
[1:14:44] to the church.
[1:14:46] He goes on to say, "Moses being born
[1:14:49] with this great gift of faith,
[1:14:53] but then he was anointed and
[1:14:55] commissioned at the burning bush."
[1:14:58] Brothers and sisters, we have to have
[1:15:01] our own burning bush experience.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; It sounds so wonderful when we look at
[1:15:08] this because there is a time in his life
[1:15:11] where we know the whole Bible was
[1:15:14] written. He was commissioned. He was
[1:15:15] given such a great gift. He was a proper
[1:15:17] child when all the children Brother
[1:15:19] Brandham talks about in this message are
[1:15:20] being stabbed and thrown to the
[1:15:22] alligators out in the in the river. Can
[1:15:24] you imagine that? How his parents put
[1:15:27] him in the in the basket because he was
[1:15:29] a proper child. They knew that he was a
[1:15:31] fulfillment of scripture because he had
[1:15:33] a visitation by an angel. His dad,
[1:15:36] Moses' dad, remember?
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham gives that that
[1:15:40] description how they pushed him out into
[1:15:41] the into the river and the alligators
[1:15:43] were coming up. They thought, "Here
[1:15:45] comes another one." And we know, Brother
[1:15:46] Brandham said, "The angel of the Lord
[1:15:48] came and put his foot on top of that
[1:15:49] basket and said, "Not this one. You can
[1:15:52] have all the rest, but not this one.
[1:15:54] Uh-uh. Beat it."
[1:15:58] But Moses being born with this great
[1:16:00] gift, brothers and sisters, let's not
[1:16:02] put it off on Moses. What I want to do
[1:16:03] tonight is bring it right down home and
[1:16:05] remind us about the great gift that we
[1:16:08] have. And that is the gift of faith by
[1:16:12] the spirit that we're reading about.
[1:16:14] That is a gift. It's something that we
[1:16:17] have that is greater than anything we
[1:16:19] could ever receive in this life. The
[1:16:21] second best thing that we could ever
[1:16:23] get. Brother Brandham said, I would say
[1:16:25] the Lord said through brother Brandham,
[1:16:28] besides our salvation,
[1:16:31] besides the ability to have faith, to
[1:16:32] believe in our salvation is a wife.
[1:16:36] the greatest thing that we could ever
[1:16:37] get as a spouse. Tremendous to think
[1:16:40] about. But Moses being born with this
[1:16:43] great gift, I want to say tonight, uh,
[1:16:45] we're not going to add to or take away
[1:16:47] from, but let's just put our name in
[1:16:49] there. Put your name in there. Being
[1:16:50] born with this great gift of faith. Then
[1:16:53] he or she was anointed and commissioned
[1:16:56] at the appointed time of the father
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; where there was a a burning bush
[1:17:01] experience where somehow someway the
[1:17:04] word of God just meant something more
[1:17:05] than it ever had before in their life
[1:17:08] and somehow someway they just had an
[1:17:10] experience. They had a new birth
[1:17:12] experience like we're talking about on
[1:17:14] Sunday. Brother Brandham, he says it
[1:17:15] very clearly what a new birth experience
[1:17:17] is like and we're going to get into it.
[1:17:19] But there are very clear identifiers
[1:17:22] about having a new birth. It is not just
[1:17:24] a feeling. It's not just an emotion.
[1:17:26] It's not an association. It's not
[1:17:29] anything like that. It is all about
[1:17:31] dying out to ourselves. The burning bush
[1:17:35] experience is what will set the faith of
[1:17:38] the father on fire in the life of a
[1:17:41] believer. It's not going to positionally
[1:17:44] drop a seed into the heart. Sometimes we
[1:17:46] hear it talked about that way. There's
[1:17:47] going to be a seed thrown and a seed
[1:17:49] thrown and a seed thrown and a seed
[1:17:51] thrown. The the planting is over.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; What we're looking at today is actually
[1:17:57] the harvest time. All of the seeds have
[1:18:00] been planted before the foundation of
[1:18:02] the world. They were planted. They were
[1:18:03] sown. And now the word of God through a
[1:18:07] vindicated prophet gets spoken. And
[1:18:10] somewhere along the way that time
[1:18:12] appointed of the father creates a
[1:18:14] burning bush experience in the life of a
[1:18:16] believer. So when we can put our name
[1:18:18] there and say so and so being born with
[1:18:22] this great gift of faith then he was
[1:18:24] anointed and commissioned at the word of
[1:18:27] a vindicated prophet
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; because today that's our burning bush.
[1:18:33] That's why we look at the pillar of fire
[1:18:35] and say something different is about
[1:18:37] that picture where brother Brandham has
[1:18:39] that picture from the Sam Houston
[1:18:41] Coliseum. We all know that picture.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; That's way more than just God
[1:18:45] identifying himself with a man. That's
[1:18:48] showing that that pillar of fire, the
[1:18:49] same pillar of fire that came and stood
[1:18:52] right between the Egyptians and the
[1:18:55] children of Israel that night when
[1:18:56] Pharaoh's army wanted to destroy them.
[1:18:59] That same pillar of fire is identified
[1:19:01] in North America.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; And you know, if we had the ability to
[1:19:05] see it, maybe through some kind of
[1:19:06] specialized filter, and I pray, Lord,
[1:19:09] God, give us that specialized filter
[1:19:11] that we might be able to see that very
[1:19:13] same pillar of fire here in this
[1:19:15] building tonight
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT AIN'T NOTHING different than
[1:19:18] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:19:25] forever. And he's here tonight. We
[1:19:26] declared this meeting to be in his name.
[1:19:28] So there ain't one need in our midst
[1:19:30] that can stand in the way of his word.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; If we've got faith tonight, brothers and
[1:19:35] sisters, if we've got needs in our
[1:19:37] lives, then he's here to meet those
[1:19:39] needs.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; This isn't about just coming TO HEAR A
[1:19:42] GOOD WORD TO MAKE US FEEL GOOD AND SEND
[1:19:44] US on our way home. THIS IS TO CHANGE
[1:19:46] OUR LIVES.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; But put your name in there. being born
[1:19:52] with this great gift of faith. Then you
[1:19:56] was ANOINTED AND COMMISSIONED AT the
[1:19:58] burning bush to deliver God's people to
[1:20:02] lead your family.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; To live your life before the people.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And then tell someone about it
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; because they say, "WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU?
[1:20:15] WHY ARE YOU SO STRANGE?
[1:20:18] I JUST FEEL SO good when I get around
[1:20:21] you.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES I'M SO ANGRY AND SO
[1:20:24] FRUSTRATED, BUT WHEN I GET around you,
[1:20:27] it just disappears.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Or why is it that people, they don't
[1:20:32] know that you're a Christian? They don't
[1:20:33] EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME, BUT THEY'LL start
[1:20:35] apologizing FOR SWEARING IN FRONT OF
[1:20:37] YOU. WHY? BECAUSE THAT PILLAR OF fire is
[1:20:41] with you.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] Thank you.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Now, sees what great qualities this man
[1:20:51] had.
[1:20:52] I think it's so beautiful. As we go
[1:20:54] through the study of gifts, brothers and
[1:20:56] sisters, I want to remind us that that
[1:20:58] brother Brandham said it. Remember, he
[1:21:00] said it that every single praying church
[1:21:02] should have every single one of those
[1:21:04] gifts
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; in their midst.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; So, I want to encourage us tonight to
[1:21:09] recognize that this is not something
[1:21:11] foreign. I'm not trying to present some
[1:21:13] new doctrine. I'm simply saying, "Hey,
[1:21:16] man, the word's saying it.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Where do we stand tonight?" [laughter]
[1:21:21] I think it's so beautiful to think about
[1:21:23] this, though. Let's not put this off
[1:21:25] 2,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago into
[1:21:28] Moses day. Let's bring it right up to
[1:21:30] today.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:21:33] forever after all.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; But this is in the message. Why cry?
[1:21:42] Speak.
[1:21:44] I just feel inspired. Brother Bradom, he
[1:21:47] talks about it in this message and
[1:21:49] [snorts] maybe we'll wind up reading a
[1:21:51] quote a little bit about it, but I don't
[1:21:52] know if I really captured any of those
[1:21:54] because I want to leave room for
[1:21:56] anointing. I don't want to just read a
[1:21:57] quote, read a quote, read a quote. We
[1:21:59] need anointed preaching. It has to be by
[1:22:01] the spirit.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about in this
[1:22:04] message,
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. how
[1:22:08] Moses
[1:22:09] had been shown himself by God so many
[1:22:15] infallible proofs of God's witness with
[1:22:19] him all the way along. The people saw
[1:22:22] it, too. But Moses himself had to
[1:22:26] realize there comes a point in time,
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; where God's not going to push me through
[1:22:31] a pipe.
[1:22:33] He's not just going to keep doing things
[1:22:35] for me, parting the waters for me,
[1:22:37] making things happen for me. What he
[1:22:39] wants is for me to do it.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Moses had to come to that realization
[1:22:45] for himself. In this message, brother
[1:22:47] Brandham says it,
[1:22:49] you know, talking about faith. Faith is
[1:22:52] the substance out of the amplified Bible
[1:22:55] in Hebrews 11:1. Now faith is the
[1:22:58] assurance, the confirmation,
[1:23:01] the title deed
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; of the things we hope for being the
[1:23:07] proof of the things we do not see and
[1:23:10] the conviction of their reality.
[1:23:14] Faith perceived as real fact what is not
[1:23:19] revealed to the senses.
[1:23:22] So beautiful because that is a
[1:23:24] description of a new birth, isn't it?
[1:23:27] Faith that I am born again. Faith that I
[1:23:30] believe the word of God. Faith that I'm
[1:23:32] going to be in the resurrection. Faith
[1:23:34] that I'm going to be in the rapture.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; However God chooses for it to be is how
[1:23:38] it's going to be. But I just know I'm
[1:23:40] going to be there.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; So if I said to you tonight, can you
[1:23:45] explain to me how that's going to be?
[1:23:46] How you going to be there, Brother
[1:23:48] Tobiso? How's that going to work?
[1:23:51] can't explain it,
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; but it's by faith that we believe it.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; We just do.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; And that's a gift.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; That's a gift from God.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And it's so beautiful because the more
[1:24:04] we hear this word, the more it cements
[1:24:06] it in our heart.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; The more we believe it, the more
[1:24:10] strength we gain from it, the more faith
[1:24:12] we get as we go.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. But remember Hebrews 11:6, without
[1:24:18] faith it is impossible to please him.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; So I want to say it tonight, and I
[1:24:26] didn't even mean it for this, but I'm
[1:24:27] going to say it. When we come to a
[1:24:29] service, when we come expecting, when we
[1:24:33] come to worship, what are we doing?
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Who are we worshiping?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; What's our direction? Right?
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Are we worshiping by faith?
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Because if we're not worshiping by
[1:24:47] faith, we're missing the mark.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; We've got to have faith that we're
[1:24:52] worshiping the King of Kings and Lord of
[1:24:54] Lords.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; And I want to remind us the worst thing
[1:24:57] that could ever happen is for us to get
[1:24:59] hung up on something going on.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; That's the devil.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. the brother singing beside me, he
[1:25:09] just can't hold a note in a bucket. Or
[1:25:12] maybe the the I'll just say it this way.
[1:25:14] Maybe the sister over there, she's got
[1:25:17] terrible breath.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THOSE THINGS, I JUST
[1:25:20] CAN'T WORSHIP.
[1:25:23] That's when you want to worship.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Because that's the devil trying to stop
[1:25:27] you.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; It's not those people.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; We've been given this place to worship.
[1:25:33] Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; If the piano plays a little fast, oh my,
[1:25:37] if the bass guitar gets a little bit
[1:25:39] loud,
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; if if the sound guys miss a word, if you
[1:25:43] know, all of these things, brothers and
[1:25:45] sisters, are going to trip us up if we
[1:25:47] let them.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; But when we close our eyes and we raise
[1:25:51] our hands and we say, "I don't care
[1:25:52] who's watching. I'm not interested in
[1:25:54] any of that. I'm interested in the King
[1:25:56] OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS and the
[1:25:59] blessing THAT HE HAS IN STORE FOR me in
[1:26:01] this service right now tonight.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; When we're willing to do that, guess
[1:26:07] what?
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; We're talking next level faith.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; We're not just going to church and going
[1:26:13] through formalities. We're going to
[1:26:15] actually change our bodies. Because
[1:26:17] remember, brothers and sisters, don't
[1:26:19] think that we're going to see a body
[1:26:20] change that's going to change the
[1:26:21] character. It's not going to work that
[1:26:23] way. WE'RE GOING TO SEE A CHARACTER
[1:26:25] change that's GOING TO CHANGE THE BODY.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; IF THE CHARACTER DOESN'T CHANGE, THERE
[1:26:31] AIN'T GOING TO BE a body change.
[1:26:34] [laughter]
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; That old man's got to die. Every single
[1:26:37] speck of them
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; and woman,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Without faith, it's impossible to please
[1:26:45] him.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe
[1:26:47] that he is Hebrews 13:8. He is the same
[1:26:52] yesterday, today, and forever. Just like
[1:26:54] he was for brother Brandham, he is for
[1:26:55] me.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; You know, in this message, why cry
[1:26:58] speak? Brother Brandham tells the story
[1:27:00] about the woman who actually came with
[1:27:02] the baby who was sick. And the baby was
[1:27:04] crying and fussing. And the woman didn't
[1:27:06] have a seat, but she had a prayer card.
[1:27:08] And she's holding the baby, trying to
[1:27:10] keep the baby calm, and she can't keep
[1:27:12] the baby from crying and trying to calm
[1:27:14] this baby. And no doubt people are
[1:27:16] getting all upset because this baby this
[1:27:18] baby and they're trying to hear the word
[1:27:19] of God and they want to be prayed for
[1:27:21] too. But she's got a prayer card and
[1:27:23] there's a woman sitting there and she
[1:27:25] says, "You know, the Lord told me to
[1:27:27] pray for that baby."
[1:27:30] And she says, "It's crazy because God's
[1:27:32] prophet's on the stage. How could I be
[1:27:34] the one to pray for that baby? I'd be
[1:27:36] getting in the way of God's program.
[1:27:37] She's got a prayer card after all. Oh
[1:27:39] my." But it just keeps coming to her.
[1:27:41] Pray for that baby. Pray for that baby.
[1:27:44] pray for that baby. And we know that
[1:27:46] that woman finally couldn't resist it
[1:27:47] anymore. She couldn't hold back anymore.
[1:27:49] So what did she do? She got up and she
[1:27:51] said, "Sister, would you like to sit
[1:27:53] down? I can see that you're tired." And
[1:27:56] the woman said, "No, I don't want to
[1:27:57] take your seat." "No, no, no, no." And
[1:27:58] she said, "Please come and take my seat.
[1:28:00] Take your rest." So she did. And she
[1:28:02] said, "By the way, do you mind if I just
[1:28:04] pray for your baby?"
[1:28:06] And what happened? I'll tell you what
[1:28:09] happened. There was a burning bush
[1:28:11] experience right there BECAUSE THERE WAS
[1:28:13] FAITH THAT THAT LEADERSHIP IN MY heart
[1:28:16] was leading me to do something. It
[1:28:18] wasn't contrary to the word of God. IT
[1:28:20] WAS EXACTLY WITH the word of God.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; And what'd she do? She prayed for the
[1:28:24] baby. And that woman got called. The
[1:28:26] woman who prayed for the baby, she ran
[1:28:28] away. She went up into the second
[1:28:30] balcony at the very back of the
[1:28:32] auditorium. And what happened when that
[1:28:34] woman got called up? She said she prayed
[1:28:36] for that baby to get called up so that
[1:28:38] God's prophet could actually heal that
[1:28:40] baby, right? So that she could get
[1:28:41] prayed for properly by the one who had
[1:28:43] the ability. You know, that would be all
[1:28:46] I I'd be the same way. Like I [laughter]
[1:28:48] don't know if I have the faith. God's
[1:28:50] prophets right there.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; But what happened was the prophet
[1:28:54] discerned the whole situation. And and
[1:28:57] better yet, IT WAS GOD IN THE PROPHET
[1:28:59] that discerned that situation. And he
[1:29:00] said, "That woman that WENT UP INTO THE
[1:29:02] SECOND BALCONY, SHE ALREADY PRAYED FOR
[1:29:04] your baby and YOUR BABY'S HEALED BECAUSE
[1:29:06] of it."
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Why cry? Speak, brothers and sisters.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Speak by that faith that's in your life.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; It's not about the other people. It's
[1:29:19] all about you.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; It's so interesting, isn't it? In a
[1:29:23] world of entitlement, in a world of
[1:29:25] narcissism, honestly, brothers and
[1:29:27] sisters, that is where we're at. This is
[1:29:29] all about me.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; But it's not about me. It's about the
[1:29:32] Lord Jesus Christ in me.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And because of that, I'm entitled to
[1:29:38] every single PROMISE THAT'S IN THE BOOK.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; EVERY CHAPTER, every verse, every line
[1:29:43] belongs to me.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; In the age of entitlement, not
[1:29:49] entitlement worldly stuff. It's
[1:29:51] interesting to see it though because the
[1:29:52] natural types the spiritual, doesn't it?
[1:29:55] Think about the sons and daughters of
[1:29:56] God. how much entitlement we really
[1:29:58] have.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It's unreal.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; In Habac 2:4, it says, "Behold, his soul
[1:30:06] which is lifted up is not upright in
[1:30:08] him, but the just, the just shall live
[1:30:14] by his faith."
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham, he says this. We still
[1:30:20] got 15 minutes. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; We might get through these quotes here
[1:30:23] tonight. God has got a purpose of you
[1:30:28] being here.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; He says, "See,
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; if you can only be
[1:30:35] get to that place,
[1:30:38] how much trouble you save God
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; and yourself."
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine he's saying this?
[1:30:48] How much trouble you can save God.
[1:30:52] We could save God trouble.
[1:30:55] [laughter] My Lord help me. [sighs]
[1:30:59] We could save God trouble and ourselves
[1:31:02] too. Why cry? Speak. [snorts] He says in
[1:31:04] another one, Moses borned and then he
[1:31:07] was afterwards he was brought to the
[1:31:10] place where he was anointed. And you
[1:31:13] know brothers and sisters, it's the same
[1:31:14] thing for us. When we get born again,
[1:31:16] there comes a place where we get born
[1:31:18] again. We get the spirit of God. We have
[1:31:20] got to be positionally placed in our
[1:31:22] inheritance and that is to be solidified
[1:31:26] in the Holy Ghost and having the Holy
[1:31:28] Ghost solidified in our lives. And what
[1:31:30] is that, brothers and sisters? It's not
[1:31:32] just being anointed by the Holy Spirit.
[1:31:34] It's actually the literal life of Jesus
[1:31:37] Christ.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; And that is what the message of the hour
[1:31:40] goes to.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And some people shy right away from
[1:31:43] that. Even message ministry for some
[1:31:45] reason. I don't know why, but they do.
[1:31:48] They shy away from the person of Jesus
[1:31:50] Christ because we know the baptism of
[1:31:52] the Holy Ghost gives way to the person
[1:31:54] of Jesus Christ. That's an exact quote.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; That's an exact quote. But he says here,
[1:31:59] Moses born and then he was afterwards he
[1:32:03] was brought to the place where he was
[1:32:05] anointed. And notice the seed laying
[1:32:08] there with an intellectual conception
[1:32:12] with all the faith that he was born to
[1:32:14] deliver this people. And yet it never
[1:32:16] come to life until that light from the
[1:32:19] burning bush flashed across it.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; That same light has got to flash across
[1:32:30] that seed in our lives. And when that
[1:32:33] happens, it changes us. Yes.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; It's not just intellectual. That word of
[1:32:40] God has made the longest journey that it
[1:32:41] will ever go right from here to here.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; The longest journey in a human's life.
[1:32:49] It's gone. And he says, "And notice that
[1:32:51] seed laying there with an intellectual
[1:32:53] conception and with all the faith that
[1:32:55] he was born to deliver this people. And
[1:32:58] yet it never come to life until that
[1:32:59] light from the burning bush flashed
[1:33:03] across it. until he seen not something
[1:33:07] he read about.
[1:33:09] I just as I read these, as I was
[1:33:11] studying this, I was thinking, man, not
[1:33:13] just something that we've read about,
[1:33:15] not just something that we've heard, not
[1:33:17] just something even that we say, but
[1:33:20] something that literally happens inside
[1:33:22] our life. It causes us to have a new
[1:33:24] birth. There's a new birth that comes to
[1:33:26] life inside of us, just like Mary. And
[1:33:29] that life is only one life. It's not a
[1:33:32] hybrid life. But many times we can
[1:33:35] present it to look like that because we
[1:33:37] mix it with something else. We have
[1:33:39] something other than just the pure word
[1:33:42] of God, the pure message for our day.
[1:33:44] But until that light from the burning
[1:33:46] bush flashed across it, until that light
[1:33:49] from that pillar of fire flashes across
[1:33:52] it, brothers and sisters, we're just
[1:33:54] going to have intellectualism.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; We're going to have knowledge. And you
[1:33:59] know what? We might even have wisdom.
[1:34:01] But it doesn't matter if we have both of
[1:34:03] those, does it? Now that we've gone on
[1:34:05] to faith in the gifts to recognize
[1:34:07] without faith, it's impossible to please
[1:34:09] God. We can have all the knowledge. We
[1:34:10] can have all the wisdom, all the wisdom,
[1:34:13] and how to actually apply the knowledge,
[1:34:15] [laughter]
[1:34:16] but we're not going to please God with
[1:34:18] it.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; We're going to know all the quotes.
[1:34:20] We're going to have GONE TO ALL THE
[1:34:21] PLACES. WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE A BELT
[1:34:23] BUCKLE, but we're NOT GOING TO PLEASE
[1:34:25] GOD UNLESS WE'VE GOT FAITH. RIGHT.
[1:34:28] That's right.
[1:34:32] It had to flash across it until he seen
[1:34:35] not something he read about, but
[1:34:36] something he seen with his eyes.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Something that spoke to him.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And he spoke back to it.
[1:34:46] [gasps]
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church, ain't it?
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Not just to have something speak to us,
[1:34:52] but to speak back to it.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; And the more we speak back to it, the
[1:34:58] more it speaks to us.
[1:35:00] It's the way it works. I love the way
[1:35:01] Brother Andrew Glover said it. You know,
[1:35:03] it's like the old time saws, right? The
[1:35:06] pushpull saw. You have an end and I have
[1:35:08] an end and you pull and then I pull and
[1:35:12] I push and you push. And as we do this,
[1:35:15] we actually do it together. It's the way
[1:35:17] it works.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:35:22] back to it. Oh, how that did bring
[1:35:27] things to life. And it's the same today.
[1:35:30] It ain't no different tonight at Calgary
[1:35:33] Living Word. Something speaks to us and
[1:35:36] we speak back. Something spoke to Mary
[1:35:41] and she spoke back.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; She said, "Be it unto me according to
[1:35:45] thy word."
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; The messenger the the the angel
[1:35:48] messenger brought a message from the
[1:35:50] presence of God and said, "You're you're
[1:35:52] highly favored among the women."
[1:35:54] Remember, the feminine is the church.
[1:35:57] The female is the bride. The bride can
[1:36:01] only take the word as he gives it. But
[1:36:03] when she does, the intimacy happens and
[1:36:07] there is conception.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Romans 1 verse 17 says, "For therein is
[1:36:15] the righteousness of God revealed from
[1:36:17] faith to faith, as it is written, the
[1:36:21] just shall live by faith."
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. The just shall live by faith.
[1:36:28] Brother Brandham, he goes on in this
[1:36:29] message. Why cry speak? He says, "I
[1:36:31] think any man
[1:36:34] with a or woman, boy or girl, and I
[1:36:37] think in an intellectual conception of
[1:36:41] what they think the word is and so
[1:36:44] forth, never can have a full foundation
[1:36:49] stand
[1:36:50] until they have met that light that
[1:36:53] brings that word to a reality.
[1:36:57] No man, no woman
[1:37:00] Brothers and sisters, the new birth is
[1:37:02] not optional.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; That's brother Barry's heart.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; The new birth is not optional. And the
[1:37:09] new birth is messy.
[1:37:12] Brother Bradom talks about it. How the
[1:37:13] birth is messy. It doesn't matter
[1:37:15] whether you're in the finest of hospital
[1:37:17] or whether you're in a pig pen. It's a
[1:37:19] mess.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; A birth is a mess. And to think that we
[1:37:24] can have some way around it. Maybe
[1:37:26] there's going to be another way. I don't
[1:37:28] have to have any tears. I don't have to
[1:37:29] have any emotion. I don't have to have
[1:37:31] any feeling. I can just say, "Bless God.
[1:37:33] Amen. I believe." Sure you can. But have
[1:37:36] you been born again?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Have we received his spirit since we
[1:37:43] believe?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; That's the new birth, brothers and
[1:37:46] sisters. It's not just saying that I
[1:37:48] believe God sent a prophet. That I just
[1:37:50] believe that Jesus was was crucified,
[1:37:53] that he he was he was he was killed, he
[1:37:55] was buried, he rose again, and and bless
[1:37:58] God, I'm saved. That's not the new
[1:37:59] birth. Once upon a time, it was. And we
[1:38:02] know that brother Brandham says it that
[1:38:04] God wked at that for years and years.
[1:38:06] But now we've been given that word that
[1:38:09] prophets and sages have desired to look
[1:38:11] upon and we just have it in abundance.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; There's no shortcuts.
[1:38:19] It's the same today. We've got to be
[1:38:21] born again. Oh, I can't get away from
[1:38:24] that thought. It's so beautiful.
[1:38:27] He goes on to say, "I think no church in
[1:38:30] its practice, no matter how intellectual
[1:38:34] and fundamental it might be, and I'll
[1:38:36] say it this way, how close to the
[1:38:38] message it might be. If it's lukewarm,
[1:38:41] formal, and powerless, it's problematic.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; It can have all the quotes. It can have
[1:38:47] all the music. But if it's one word off,
[1:38:51] it's Satan's Eden.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; EVEN IF IT'S CALLED THE MESSAGE,
[1:38:56] That's what brother Brandham said.
[1:38:57] They'll never ever denominate this
[1:38:59] message. They'll never ever denominate
[1:39:02] this. They can't because it's Jesus
[1:39:04] Christ.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; But I think no church in its practice,
[1:39:08] no matter how intellectual and
[1:39:10] fundamental it might be, that church
[1:39:12] cannot thrive until the supernatural is
[1:39:16] made known among THAT PEOPLE
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SEE IT.
[1:39:24] the prophet's words, not mine.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; So, brothers and sisters,
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; I want to say it tonight.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Have you seen it?
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Have you seen it?
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Because if you haven't seen it, I'm not
[1:39:38] scolding you. I'M ENCOURAGING YOU. TAKE
[1:39:40] A LOOK.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; LOOK AWAY TO JESUS. HE'S STILL HERE.
[1:39:44] THERE'S STILL TIME.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:48] But if we're intellectual,
[1:39:52] you know, we meet people. I meet people,
[1:39:55] lots of people. They've got theology
[1:39:58] degrees and and they've got doctorates
[1:40:02] in in different disciplines and they're
[1:40:05] very intellectual,
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; but you never see them just get really
[1:40:10] into the spirit of THINGS LIKE THE
[1:40:12] PROPHET SAID.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; My I'm not trying to scold but what I am
[1:40:20] saying is brothers and sisters DON'T
[1:40:21] WORRY ABOUT WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS
[1:40:23] THINKING. Only worry about what he's
[1:40:25] thinking AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU'VE
[1:40:27] GOT THAT NEW BIRTH.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz the death angel is passing through
[1:40:33] the land.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; He's already in the land passing through
[1:40:37] the land. You know, we we were talking
[1:40:39] about this and I can't get away from
[1:40:40] this thought either. You know that uh
[1:40:43] the mark of the beast is coming. Sure
[1:40:44] enough, it's coming. The mark of the
[1:40:46] beast. And I know it's scary for some
[1:40:48] people, maybe especially for children.
[1:40:49] But I want us to rest assured, you don't
[1:40:51] have to worry about the mark of the
[1:40:52] beast. If you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET THAT PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:40:57] EXPERIENCE, that has nothing to do with
[1:40:59] you.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU REJECT
[1:41:04] THAT, YOU ALREADY HAVE the mark of the
[1:41:07] beast.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; How do you have it? I'll tell you how.
[1:41:10] You were born in sin, shaped in
[1:41:11] iniquity, come into the world speaking
[1:41:13] lies. came into this world contrary to
[1:41:15] the way that God said it should happen
[1:41:17] according to the spoken word being the
[1:41:19] original seed. We all came into the
[1:41:22] world. None of us desired to come to
[1:41:24] this world. Did anybody here today say,
[1:41:26] "I want to go to earth. I want to be
[1:41:27] born in this family in this place." And
[1:41:29] I know that there's some weird doctrine
[1:41:31] out there that says, "Did you know that
[1:41:33] you choose your own parents?"
[1:41:36] [laughter]
[1:41:37] I love my parents very much. So, I pick
[1:41:40] the best.
[1:41:42] But you know, NONE OF US CHOSE TO COME
[1:41:45] HERE,
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; We're all born in sin, shed of iniquity,
[1:41:49] come in this world speaking lies. That's
[1:41:51] that's the way it is.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; But because of that,
[1:41:56] all of us have just a little bit of
[1:41:58] Cain's DNA
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; in this flesh.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; And that's why that is exactly the
[1:42:05] reason, brothers and sisters, why this
[1:42:06] flesh will not inherit incorruption.
[1:42:12] That is the reason that this God we're
[1:42:14] talking about, this pillar of fire, the
[1:42:16] Lord Jesus Christ, he has a brand new
[1:42:18] body waiting for us.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; I think, Brother Barry, can you imagine
[1:42:24] what it would be like to not have a a a
[1:42:26] messed up knee? What it would be like to
[1:42:28] not have a a a fat belly? What it' be
[1:42:31] like to not have a big nose? Maybe be
[1:42:34] gassy? All of these human traits that we
[1:42:36] have as human beings. What will it be
[1:42:39] like to not be that way? TO HAVE A
[1:42:41] PERFECT BODY, A MATURE BODY, A BODY THE
[1:42:44] way that he CREATED BEFORE THE
[1:42:46] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. THAT'S what
[1:42:48] we're going to have.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the mark of the beast.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Worry about the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Worry about that pillar of fire
[1:42:58] experience. Have that burning bush
[1:43:00] moment. And if you ever want it and you
[1:43:02] just don't know that you got it,
[1:43:04] brothers and sisters, come and ask.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Come and ask the Lord Jesus Christ. pour
[1:43:09] out your spirit upon me like I've never
[1:43:12] had it and see if he WON'T DO IT. SOME
[1:43:14] MIGHT SAY, "OH, brother Barry, now
[1:43:15] you're trying to GET PENTECOSTAL." WHAT
[1:43:17] I AM saying is, brothers and sisters,
[1:43:19] it's too late to play church.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; This is all about getting the Holy Ghost
[1:43:23] in our LIVES AND GIVING HIM the
[1:43:25] preeminence to do what he wills
[1:43:27] according to his word.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; And if you think maybe I am trying to
[1:43:33] put this on, I'll just read this quote
[1:43:35] again here as we close. I'll bring the
[1:43:36] musicians up. Call the musicians. Thank
[1:43:39] you very much. But brother Bradam, he
[1:43:40] says, "I think no church in its
[1:43:41] practice, no matter how intellectual,
[1:43:43] how fundamental it might be, that church
[1:43:46] cannot thrive until the supernatural is
[1:43:48] made known among that people and they
[1:43:52] see it. Something that they can talk to
[1:43:56] that will talk back to them that
[1:43:59] vindicates this written word."
[1:44:03] [laughter]
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; I love it. I love it. Maybe stand with
[1:44:06] me as we close tonight.
[1:44:08] Sorry if I seem like I'm a little bit
[1:44:10] excited, but this gets me excited.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; This does it for me. This is what does
[1:44:15] it for me.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; I I get excited about a lot of things in
[1:44:18] life, but nothing like this.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; This This is This is for us, brothers
[1:44:23] and sisters.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of world that are trying
[1:44:27] to actually make this stuff happen.
[1:44:30] But for some reason, God chose us to
[1:44:32] have ears to hear the word that he gave
[1:44:35] to his vindicated prophet so that we
[1:44:37] could be partakers of this word that all
[1:44:40] of the ages, the the sages and and
[1:44:43] elders desired to see. We just can see
[1:44:46] it. It's amazing.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:44:51] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:44:53] you that you are the same yesterday,
[1:44:55] today, and forever. Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, and to think about you said
[1:45:00] it, Lord, through your prophet that
[1:45:02] every single church ought to see these
[1:45:05] gifts. And Lord, every single church
[1:45:08] ought to see the supernatural in their
[1:45:10] midst and be able to see it. Not just
[1:45:14] say that it's here, but to see it.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Father, we're not seeking signs. We just
[1:45:20] want to get in line with your word.
[1:45:24] Father, your prophet said this word
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; and that's our desire is to see your
[1:45:29] word
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; in our lives in our midst.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to yield to you.
[1:45:36] Father,
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; in all of our actions, in all of our
[1:45:40] thoughts, in all of our behaviors, Lord,
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; help us to have faith, Lord, that you
[1:45:46] will and do according to your good
[1:45:48] purpose in our lives. Oh father, we
[1:45:51] don't have to worry about services and
[1:45:53] how they happen because if we truly have
[1:45:56] faith and if we truly surrender
[1:45:58] ourselves unto you, then you will do
[1:46:00] what you want.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; And you will receive all of the glory
[1:46:05] and all of the honor and all of the
[1:46:07] praise,
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; oh father. And if there's something
[1:46:10] wrong, you will tell us. YOU'LL SHOW US.
[1:46:13] We don't have to be afraid.
[1:46:16] Father, I just rebuke that spirit of
[1:46:18] fear in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh,
[1:46:21] Father, and I loose your spirit, Lord,
[1:46:23] of faith in our midst, Lord, that we
[1:46:26] would be able to have the wisdom and the
[1:46:28] knowledge, Father, to know, oh, Father,
[1:46:30] what to do with your word because of the
[1:46:32] faith inside of us, which is literally
[1:46:35] your life. Father, tonight, I pray that
[1:46:38] you would bless each one. Oh, Father, as
[1:46:40] we've gathered together in your name and
[1:46:42] we have to go our separate ways, I pray
[1:46:44] that you would just keep your hand upon
[1:46:46] us tenderly, Lord, as we go our separate
[1:46:49] ways. Father, we pray for those who are
[1:46:51] traveling, Lord. I think of brother
[1:46:52] Logan and Sister Neve.
[1:46:55] Oh father the oh o o o o o o o o o o o o
[1:46:56] o o o o o o o o d d d d d d d d d d d d
[1:46:57] d d d d d d d doo's lord, brother Toby
[1:46:58] and sister faith, Lord Jesus, brother
[1:47:02] John, father, each one who is traveling,
[1:47:05] Lord, and away we pray that you would
[1:47:07] just keep your hand upon them and give
[1:47:08] them traveling mercies. Lord, bring them
[1:47:10] back home safely at the appointed time.
[1:47:12] We ask
[1:47:14] and Father, if it be your will for us to
[1:47:16] gather again on Sunday, Lord,
[1:47:19] we'll come. And [music] Father, we'll
[1:47:21] we'll come willing, Father, to meet with
[1:47:23] that pillar of fire, to meet with that
[1:47:25] burning bush, Lord. Oh, Father, to have
[1:47:27] that supernatural light flash across
[1:47:30] that seed gene of God in our lives,
[1:47:32] Father. That it would come to life,
[1:47:35] Lord. And that it would have, oh Father,
[1:47:37] the manifestation that you desire,
[1:47:41] Lord Jesus. I pray that you would just
[1:47:43] be glorified now as we sing a few songs
[1:47:46] before we go our separate ways.
[1:47:48] We love you and we thank you. We just
[1:47:50] ask [music] all these things in Jesus
[1:47:52] Christ's name we pray.
