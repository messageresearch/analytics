[21:30] my father.

[21:36] and I have live
[21:39] in the goodness of God. Oh yeah.
[21:46] All my life you have been faithful.
[21:54] All my life you have been so so good.
[22:02] With every breath that I am able.
[22:08] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[22:12] of God. Oh yes, your
[22:17] your goodness is running after. It's
[22:20] running after me.
[22:25] Your goodness is running after. It's
[22:28] running after me.
[22:31] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[22:35] I give you everything.
[22:40] Your goodness is running after. It's
[22:43] running after me. Your goodness, your
[22:50] goodness is running after. It's running
[22:53] after me.
[22:57] Your goodness is running after. It's

[23:50] once more as brother Don comes. All my
[23:53] life you have been faithful.
[24:00] All my life you have been so so good.
[24:08] Every breath that I am able.
[24:14] Oh, I will sing
[24:17] of the goodness
[24:19] of God.
[24:28] Pray this is a blessing for someone
[24:30] tonight.
[24:32] This poem is called Dying to Die.
[24:37] Yahweh put a seed deep in my heart.
[24:41] Didn't look like much at the start. No
[24:45] bro lights, no open door, just quiet
[24:48] life growing more.
[24:52] I'm learning how to die well. Lord, lay
[24:55] my life down to your will, Lord.
[25:00] Like a chopped timber, I fall
[25:02] so the word may live. That's all.
[25:06] The seed grew up by grace alone, found
[25:10] its way through flesh and bone. It bore
[25:13] much fruit along the way, fed the
[25:16] hungry,
[25:18] help them stay.
[25:20] I'm learning how to die. Well, Lord,
[25:23] lay my life down in your will, Lord.
[25:28] Not my name, not any fame, only Jesus,
[25:32] the very same.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Now the seasons changed, I see.
[25:37] Your life asks more of me.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; To let go,
[25:42] to not hold tight,
[25:44] to endure the dark before the light.
[25:47] I'm learning how to dwell, to die well,
[25:50] Lord, knowing you are with me, Lord.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; The seed don't die to end the story. It
[25:56] dies bringing you glory.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; So every day I lay it down in little
[26:02] deaths that make no sound. When I
[26:04] forgive, when I bow,
[26:08] when love's the only thing I know.
[26:11] I'm learning how to die well, Lord.
[26:14] Spend my life like you did, Lord.
[26:17] If they see anything in me, let them see
[26:20] you clearly.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; When the night feels long and near,
[26:26] still I rest without fear. What you
[26:29] bury, you will raise. Life comes out of
[26:32] dying ways.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; I'm learning how to die well, Lord. Fall
[26:37] like wheat into your field, Lord. When
[26:40] my time is finally gone, may you live in
[26:44] others on simply seed in your hand. Just
[26:48] the life you planned. I will fall. I
[26:52] will trust dying well because I must.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Stand if you would. Thank you.
[27:12] Gift like that is quite amazing. We hear
[27:14] a lot of those poems. There's a whole
[27:15] collection of them. Now, brother Don's
[27:17] brought true gift and our brother. We
[27:19] certainly thank the Lord for it. It
[27:20] seems fitting that this song was right
[27:22] after he mentioned the word grace.
[27:26] If we died well, amazing grace will
[27:29] always be our portion.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; We die daily is what our apostle Paul
[27:33] said. We must die to this flesh. The
[27:36] amazing
[27:38] grace
[27:41] shall always be
[27:45] my song
[27:47] of praise.
[27:50] For it was grace
[27:56] that brought my liberty.
[28:04] I do not know
[28:09] just why he came to love. He saw
[28:17] he looked beyond
[28:22] my faults and he saw
[28:26] my need. Aren't you glad he did tonight?
[28:29] Oh yes.
[28:31] I shall
[28:38] my eyes to
[28:53] die for me.
[29:04] The grace
[29:06] that my
[29:13] he looked beyond
[29:18] my thoughts and he saw blind me. Yes, he
[29:24] looked beyond
[29:28] my faults and he saw.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Can you hear the sound from heaven?
[29:44] Like the sound
[29:47] of many
[29:48] waters,
[29:51] it's the sound of worship
[29:55] coming from the throne. Here's his
[29:59] throne tonight. Oh yes.
[30:02] Oh
[30:04] Christ
[30:21] to make his glory.
[30:28] Oh, see
[31:03] Oh,
[31:05] we worship you.
[31:11] Holy, holy,
[31:14] holy
[31:16] are you Lord.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't that easy? It's so wonderful to
[31:26] worship him.
[31:28] So thankful that we can gather together
[31:29] one more time.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; The way that he's ordained the name of
[31:33] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Just have a few prayer requests we would
[31:38] like to bring tonight. And we're
[31:40] certainly thankful that
[31:43] you know a couple of them. One of them
[31:45] is for the Charneck family in South
[31:49] Africa.
[31:51] Just want to continue to hold them
[31:53] before the throne. trust the Lord will
[31:56] work things out for his good
[31:58] &gt;&gt; in their lives. That's the family that
[32:00] lost everything in the fire.
[32:03] Also, we want to pray for the Panettas
[32:05] who fly out tomorrow.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; To Japan and then they will go over to
[32:10] Philippines and I believe in Japan as
[32:13] well as Philippines. Brother Mvin's
[32:15] going to be ministering many many
[32:17] services.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:19] And uh yeah, they don't let you get away
[32:22] easy when you go. But we certainly want
[32:25] to pray for our brother that the Lord
[32:27] would continue to give him a a call or
[32:30] two off of the altar that he'd be a real
[32:32] blessing to the the bride
[32:34] &gt;&gt; over there.
[32:36] Um
[32:38] two praise reports before we go to
[32:40] prayer. Brother Henry's doctor report
[32:43] came back all good.
[32:46] certainly
[32:52] wonderful when uh the doctor's report
[32:56] will match the great physician's report.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; I'd also like to thank the Lord for
[33:02] allowing my nephew Zach to go back home
[33:05] today.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:13] And on behalf of the family, I would
[33:14] just like to thank everyone who took the
[33:16] time and resources to help them. However
[33:20] you did, we know there was people that
[33:23] did. So, thank you so much. If you have
[33:25] a need tonight, maybe just make it known
[33:27] unto him by way of an uplift hand.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, tonight
[33:31] we're so thankful that we can gather
[33:33] together, Lord, the way that you've
[33:36] ordained for us in in the age in which
[33:38] we live, Lord. And we know that's in
[33:40] you. As our brother already prayed, only
[33:44] in your spirit are we going to have our
[33:46] prayers heard by you. Many people in
[33:49] this earth today gather together and
[33:53] they gather together in your name. But
[33:55] Lord, they're not willing to take your
[33:57] spirit. They're not willing to allow you
[33:59] to be Lord. They're very interested in
[34:02] you being Jesus and even the Christ, but
[34:06] not their Lord. Father, tonight there's
[34:08] a group of people gathered here in this
[34:11] building and maybe virtually that truly
[34:14] want you to be Lord. That means master
[34:17] over everything in their lives.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; And Father, we're so thankful that we
[34:21] can gather together that way.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, one more time, we just want
[34:25] to thank you for touching Brother Henry.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, there's no doubt there was
[34:29] symptoms and no doubt there was actual
[34:32] devils trying to afflict our brother.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But Lord Jesus,
[34:36] &gt;&gt; you touched him.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that, Lord.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just
[34:43] continue to watch over Brother Henry and
[34:45] his family. They've been a real blessing
[34:47] to the assembly, Lord. We pray that you
[34:50] would just continue using them, Brother
[34:52] Henry and his family for your glory.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for touching Zack
[34:57] Natarak.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. for allowing him to go home, Lord,
[35:00] to defy all of the doctor's reports,
[35:02] Lord,
[35:03] &gt;&gt; to say that someone with a disease like
[35:05] that may not be able to recover so
[35:08] easily. But, Father, here he is at home
[35:11] tonight, Lord. Bless him abundantly. I
[35:13] pray, Father.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you would just bless
[35:16] the parents, Brad and Kelly.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, and Betty that's worked so
[35:21] hard to help them in their home, Lord.
[35:23] Yes.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just
[35:25] continue to watch over them, Lord,
[35:28] &gt;&gt; and that you would receive the glory.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to remember
[35:32] the Charneck family in South Africa,
[35:34] Lord. That you would just continue
[35:35] working out your perfect will in their
[35:37] life, Lord.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; We know all things work together for the
[35:41] good to those who are called according
[35:42] to your purpose. And Lord, we just want
[35:44] to commit them into your hands, Father.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we also just thank you for
[35:50] watching over the Panettas, Lord. Yes,
[35:53] &gt;&gt; we know that you've ordained their trip,
[35:54] Father, that you have it all worked out
[35:56] from the beginning to the end.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray that you would just
[36:00] keep your hand upon them, Lord.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; That you would bless their way, Father.
[36:04] That they would come home with a a
[36:06] manifold testimony of your grace,
[36:09] &gt;&gt; as they walked with you along the way,
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to commit
[36:12] each need that was made known unto you
[36:14] tonight by the way of an uplift hand,
[36:16] maybe just an uplift heart, Father,
[36:18] someone present or even away. Father, we
[36:21] know that brother Jerry Carpenter has
[36:22] requested prayer. The doctor's report
[36:25] says one thing, Father, but we know
[36:27] &gt;&gt; we don't believe the doctor's report. We
[36:30] believe your report.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; And it all depends on whose report we
[36:33] believe, Father.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you would just bless
[36:36] each one tonight, Father.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; As we turn to your word now, we pray
[36:40] that you would just break it fresh to us
[36:41] once again in Jesus Christ's name we
[36:44] pray.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you musicians.
[36:50] If you have your Bibles tonight, I would
[36:51] like to continue our study in the uh
[36:54] book of 1 Corinthians
[36:56] talking about spiritual gifts.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Talking about spiritual gifts in 1
[37:03] Corinthians chapter 12.
[37:06] 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[37:11] Just like to welcome brother Josh Adrian
[37:13] with us. had the pleasure of meeting our
[37:16] brother in Edmonton last year and took
[37:19] me a moment to register who he was. I I
[37:22] I knew I met him and I just couldn't
[37:25] remember his name, but it's certainly
[37:26] good to to see you, brother, and I trust
[37:29] you feel right at home. 1 Corinthians
[37:32] chapter 12 verse one says, "Now
[37:35] concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I
[37:37] would not have you ignorant.
[37:40] You know that ye were Gentiles, carried
[37:42] away unto these dumb idols, even as ye
[37:46] were led. Interesting because it's not
[37:49] as though you just walked after them. As
[37:51] Gentiles, we were led.
[37:54] Wherefore, I give you to understand that
[37:56] no man speaking by the spirit of God
[37:59] callth Jesus accured, and that no man
[38:02] can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the
[38:06] Holy Ghost.
[38:07] Now there are diversities of gifts but
[38:10] the same spirit and there are
[38:12] differences of administrations
[38:15] but the same Lord and there are
[38:17] diversities of operations but it is the
[38:21] same God which workketh all in all.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; But the manifestation of the spirit is
[38:26] given to every man to profit with all.
[38:30] Aren't you thankful for that tonight?
[38:32] For to one is given by the spirit the
[38:35] word of wisdom, to another the word of
[38:38] knowledge by the same spirit,
[38:42] &gt;&gt; to another faith by the same spirit.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; To another the gifts of healing by the
[38:48] same spirit.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; To another the working of miracles. To
[38:54] another prophecy.
[38:56] To another discerning of spirits. to
[38:59] another diverse kinds of tongues, to
[39:03] another the interpretation of tongues.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; But all these workketh that one and the
[39:08] self-same spirit dividing to every man
[39:11] severally as he will. For as the body is
[39:16] one, and hath many members, and all the
[39:19] members of that one body, being many are
[39:24] one body, so also is Christ. For by one
[39:28] Spirit are we all baptized into one
[39:32] body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles,
[39:35] whether we be bond or free, and have
[39:39] been all made to drink into one spirit.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[39:46] Father, tonight it's our dire our
[39:49] desire, Lord Jesus, that we could just
[39:51] drink in from that spirit. Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; We pray that Lord Jesus we could drink
[39:56] in so that you could push out.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; We just invite you Lord to have the
[40:00] preeminence in our service now in Jesus
[40:03] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[40:07] seated.
[40:12] Certainly thankful to be able to gather
[40:14] together again on a Wednesday.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. something special about the
[40:18] Wednesday services and
[40:21] you know we thank the Lord for the
[40:22] ability to do this. We don't know how
[40:24] long we will be able to but as long as
[40:26] we can we will.
[40:29] you know, uh, I had something cross my
[40:32] feed today that I thought was intriguing
[40:35] and tonight, if it's okay, I'm just
[40:37] going to take a minute and talk about
[40:39] it. And, uh, I think probably many
[40:41] people have seen it going around on the
[40:43] internet now for the believers. But, you
[40:47] know, uh, we believe that William Brham
[40:50] was a prophet.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; We believe he was a prophet to this age.
[40:54] And we know that many times he talks
[40:56] about Russia and watch Russia and you
[40:59] can see the king of the north in in the
[41:01] visions from 1933
[41:03] and uh what took place there. But he
[41:06] also said something interesting about
[41:08] what's taking place quite literally in
[41:10] the news now. I mean how many people
[41:14] here have heard about what's taking
[41:16] place with Greenland these days? I can
[41:19] imagine just about everybody's hands
[41:21] would go up if you're involved with the
[41:23] news at all. You can hear that Trump is
[41:26] actually vying to actually take over
[41:29] Greenland as a US uh state, I would
[41:32] guess,
[41:33] &gt;&gt; but he's very interested in Greenland.
[41:35] And I didn't didn't realize that
[41:37] Greenland was even mentioned in the
[41:39] message. Brother Brandham mentioned it
[41:41] five times.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; The uh the continent of Greenland. So,
[41:47] out of 1961, I'm just going to read two
[41:49] quotes about Greenland that brother
[41:51] Brandham said, and uh I guess we'll just
[41:55] let it fall where it may. 1961 0315,
[42:00] an uncertain sound. Brother Bradom says,
[42:03] "And then I believe it was the senator
[42:06] of some state
[42:08] was just talking to brother Shakarion
[42:11] and up in Greenland where this nation is
[42:15] prepared
[42:16] from Greenland to destroy the earth with
[42:21] atomic weapons.
[42:24] Just one touch and any nation will go
[42:27] plum off the earth.
[42:30] See, the only thing we hear is just they
[42:33] got a bomb will do certain certain
[42:36] things, but they got it bigger than
[42:39] that. You know, they don't you don't let
[42:42] all of your secrets out when it's in
[42:45] national affairs.
[42:48] I had no idea that this was even in the
[42:51] message that Brother Brandham spoke this
[42:53] way about Greenland. I thought maybe
[42:55] perhaps there would be discussion about
[42:57] Greenland in, you know, maybe some of
[42:59] the people up there. And you know, in a
[43:01] couple of the quotes, Brother Brandham
[43:03] just does talk about the people that are
[43:05] in Greenland and how they're kind of
[43:07] Eskimos and so on, but you know, three
[43:10] of the quotes he speaks with this tone
[43:12] talking about atomic weapons and and I
[43:15] think that's astounding when we can see
[43:17] really where we are. Um, we see
[43:20] everything that needs to happen, you
[43:23] know, happened already. Don't get me
[43:24] wrong, 70 years ago, the prophet said,
[43:27] "Everything that needs to happen for the
[43:28] rapture has happened except for the
[43:31] ripening in the sun." And here we are
[43:34] ripening 70 years later. In 1961,
[43:39] Abraham and his seed after him, Brother
[43:42] Brandham says, "Come, go with us to
[43:46] Miami."
[43:47] when a man that stood with his hand
[43:49] yonder in Greenland
[43:52] to turn atomic bombs loose that would
[43:56] have destroyed half the earth shook and
[44:00] become a Christian
[44:02] will be speaking
[44:04] when he saw a missile in a screen and
[44:08] they thought it was Russia starting he
[44:11] says we're ready too other nations are
[44:13] ready also Castro used down yonder
[44:17] just as a puppet playing up so Russia
[44:20] can get in there close enough they can
[44:23] throw their atomic missiles and things
[44:26] here it is right under our nose
[44:29] you know brother Brandham talks about it
[44:31] this is 1961 he's speaking about this
[44:36] and we know that Russia now has what
[44:37] they call hypersonic missiles that
[44:39] there's no stopping you they go so fast
[44:42] there's no way that you can actually
[44:44] intercept them it's just not going to
[44:45] happen. There's no way to do that. And
[44:48] uh so I just find it interesting that
[44:51] brother Brandon would even talk about
[44:53] Greenland. And here we hear it's in the
[44:55] news so profoundly about how the US and
[44:58] you know if you get into the study about
[45:00] the US, Revelations 11, Revelations 12,
[45:03] Revelations 13 specifically speaking
[45:06] about the USA that uh that lamb that
[45:10] came in with two horns and uh it's right
[45:14] out of Revelations 13. It's taking place
[45:16] right before our very eyes, brothers and
[45:18] sisters. It's astounding when you really
[45:20] look at it with the revelation that we
[45:22] have in the day in which we live. I just
[45:24] thought I would bring those just because
[45:26] uh you know here here we are right in
[45:30] the midst of prophecy being fulfilled.
[45:32] You know, brother Brandham preached a
[45:34] message called modern events made clear
[45:38] by prophecy.
[45:40] When we can see these things happening,
[45:41] it's no accident. It's it's no happen
[45:44] chance. We we and and you know, brothers
[45:46] and sisters, I I I want to be clear. I'm
[45:48] I'm not saying this to make us afraid.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; I want to say this. If we're afraid,
[45:53] then something is wrong. We need to
[45:55] actually get a little closer to the
[45:57] cross.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; We need to recognize who we are.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; It could be frightening for children.
[46:03] But parents, we need to encourage our
[46:05] children. I will encourage our children.
[46:07] Get into Christ.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; He's the only bomb shelter that we've
[46:10] got. There is no shelter on this earth
[46:14] that will save us from any of this
[46:16] affliction that's coming. And it's not
[46:19] like it might happen. It's going to
[46:21] happen.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; It's been prophesied.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the Lord. We spoke about
[46:26] that on Sunday. There's something so
[46:28] profound, so powerful about thus sayaeth
[46:30] the Lord. And there's something about
[46:32] the elect that can actually recognize
[46:35] the power, the the the immensity behind
[46:39] those words, thus sayaeth the Lord. But
[46:42] tonight, we're talking about spiritual
[46:44] gifts. I want to get back into our our
[46:45] little study about the spiritual gifts,
[46:47] recognizing that there's nine spiritual
[46:49] gifts in the body, from the Holy Ghost,
[46:51] through the Holy Ghost, by the Holy
[46:53] Ghost. It is the Holy Ghost. And brother
[46:55] Brandham says that every local body
[46:57] should experience these gifts. They
[47:00] should be a part of every local
[47:02] assembly. And uh you know, for the
[47:04] record, for those people that might
[47:06] maybe be visiting or or not know what's
[47:09] uh Brother Barry's heart is or maybe
[47:10] we've forgotten, we're not chasing
[47:12] gifts. We're simply saying that they are
[47:15] a part of the believer's life. They are
[47:18] actually part of the Holy Ghost. And
[47:22] sometimes, many times from old, even
[47:25] looking at the message of the hour, some
[47:27] people have brought in scarecrows and
[47:30] made it a scary thing to maybe speak in
[47:33] tongues. They've made it a scary thing
[47:34] to prophesy, a scary thing to see a
[47:38] miracle. It's not a scary thing. It's
[47:40] actually the working of the Holy Ghost.
[47:42] And we ought to be expecting to see it.
[47:44] And I think we've heard it said, I
[47:46] probably said it. I I think that I need
[47:48] to calibrate myself this way. We ought
[47:50] to be more surprised when we don't see
[47:52] these things than when we do.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; But many times as believers, we can get
[47:56] really surprised when we see the hand of
[47:58] God move in our life and think, "Wow,
[48:00] it's amazing. It is truly amazing." But
[48:03] that's the life of a believer.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; The apostles, I don't think, were very
[48:07] surprised after the day of Pentecost,
[48:10] were they?
[48:11] We know the the two went to the gate
[48:13] beautiful and they saw that beggar at
[48:15] the gate and of course he asked for alms
[48:18] and he they looked at him Peter's eyes
[48:20] fastened on him and said listen I don't
[48:23] have any alms to give you but what I've
[48:25] got I will give you in full measure
[48:28] &gt;&gt; take up your bed stand up and walk in
[48:30] the name of Jesus Christ
[48:32] &gt;&gt; amen
[48:33] &gt;&gt; we know that there will be a book of
[48:34] acts written behind the believers of
[48:36] this age
[48:38] &gt;&gt; so looking at spiritual gifts we're not
[48:40] chasing the gifts
[48:41] We're chasing the giver.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; And you know if there is any chasing the
[48:45] only thing we need to do is surrender to
[48:47] the giver
[48:48] &gt;&gt; and all the gifts follow.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Some people want to see s certain
[48:52] individual gifts. And you know brothers
[48:54] and sisters I believe it is a dangerous
[48:56] ground that we can find ourselves
[48:58] standing on to say that I have a gift of
[49:01] certain. I have a gift of this or I have
[49:03] a gift of that. If you do have a gift
[49:06] that is according to the scriptural
[49:09] spiritual gifts, then it will manifest
[49:12] according to the word.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; And if it manifests any other way,
[49:16] remember Satan can impersonate any one
[49:18] of these gifts.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; That's why it's treacherous. That's why
[49:21] it's tricky. That's why there's
[49:23] scarecrows raised around the gifts in
[49:26] the church, specifically around the
[49:28] message of the hour. But we oughtn't to
[49:30] be afraid of them. Brother Bradom says,
[49:32] "Where there's scarecrows, that means
[49:34] there's good eating."
[49:35] &gt;&gt; That's where the apples are. We ought to
[49:37] get in there.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; And get some good eating.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; So, tonight I want to encourage us to
[49:41] get in there and get some good eating.
[49:43] Tonight, we're going to talk about uh
[49:45] prophecy. We've covered knowledge,
[49:47] wisdom, faith, healing, working of
[49:49] miracles, and tonight we're just going
[49:51] to talk a little bit about prophecy. And
[49:53] remember, I I've said this all along
[49:55] that we're only skipping across the the
[49:57] top of the pond with this. We could go
[49:59] into a greater detailed study, but I
[50:01] think there's so much to actually study
[50:03] in the word. Um, I'm not going too deep
[50:07] with it, and I hope that's okay. Some
[50:08] folks maybe want to see it to be deep
[50:11] and everything to be deep, but you know,
[50:13] the Holy Ghost is as deep as it gets.
[50:15] That's right.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; And looking at the attributes of the
[50:17] Holy Ghost, it doesn't get any deeper.
[50:20] And these are all attributes of the
[50:22] deepest revelation that we could ever
[50:24] have. Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful how we are are
[50:27] here just worshiping in spirit and in
[50:29] truth.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Talking about prophecy, um
[50:35] it is out of
[50:44] verse n I believe to other faith by the
[50:46] same spirit the gifts of healing
[50:49] another working of miracles. It's verse
[50:52] 10. To another prophecy.
[50:56] And that's all it says. It's so so
[50:58] simple. It's just to another prophecy.
[51:00] Wow.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Someone else gets a gift of prophecy.
[51:03] And and it's such a a wonderful thing to
[51:05] think about this because every one of
[51:07] these gifts, we've spoken about it, are
[51:09] given to every man to profit with all.
[51:11] These gifts are not to profit ourselves
[51:14] from.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; We're not given these gifts to make
[51:17] merchandise of. And if that's what
[51:19] happens, then that means there is a
[51:21] wrong spirit behind the gift. Because
[51:24] remember, brothers and sisters, gifts
[51:26] and callings are without repentance.
[51:28] We're born with gifts in our life.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; And you know what? The same rain that
[51:32] falls on the wheat falls on the weeds.
[51:37] And all of them profit with all.
[51:42] And you know what? It doesn't matter who
[51:44] we are. we will actually manifest the
[51:48] gift that's inside of us if we just
[51:50] allow that word to water us.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; We can't prevent that. But talking about
[51:55] prophecy, there's a very specific method
[51:58] for prophecy to come in the church. And
[52:01] I I don't know, I I I'm just so thankful
[52:03] that we have a church age messenger,
[52:06] Paul the Apostle, who was the one to lay
[52:09] the foundation, the one to actually set
[52:12] the pattern for every church age. We
[52:15] covered that when we studied the church
[52:16] age book and and he said it very
[52:19] clearly. Let's turn over to Romans
[52:21] chapter 12.
[52:24] Romans chapter 12.
[52:27] We'll just talk about this prophecy
[52:29] tonight a little bit from scripture.
[52:32] We've got a a quote that we're going to
[52:34] bring as well.
[52:37] I just wanted to take a little bit of
[52:38] time here and and go over this.
[52:42] We know full well that brother Brandham
[52:45] preached what Paul preached. He based
[52:47] the entirety of the message upon what
[52:49] Paul preached
[52:50] &gt;&gt; and any other message is a false message
[52:54] &gt;&gt; because he went back to that scripture
[52:56] that Paul said very clearly that you
[52:58] know what if an angel from heaven came
[53:01] any other man came and preached any
[53:03] other gospel than what I've already
[53:06] preached than what we've already brought
[53:08] to you let him be accursed.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me say it again. He
[53:12] says, he underscores it. He makes it so
[53:15] profoundly clear. It has to be according
[53:18] to this pattern
[53:20] &gt;&gt; in uh Romans chapter 12. Paul speaking
[53:23] to the church. Don't put it back in
[53:26] history 2,000 years ago. He's speaking
[53:29] to us. I beseech you therefore,
[53:31] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[53:34] you present your bodies a living
[53:36] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[53:40] which is your reasonable service.
[53:44] I think that's so profound. every single
[53:46] one of us, myself included, let us let
[53:50] us present our bodies as a living
[53:54] sacrifice,
[53:56] holy and acceptable unto God.
[53:59] Verse two says, "And be not conformed to
[54:02] this world." We don't want to look like
[54:04] this world. We don't want to talk like
[54:06] this world. We don't want to think like
[54:08] this world. We are not of this world.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; We're of another world, aren't we? Amen.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; And be not conformed to this world, but
[54:17] be ye transformed by the renewing of
[54:20] your mind, that ye may prove what is
[54:24] that good and acceptable and perfect
[54:26] will of God. That just speaks exactly to
[54:28] what brother Brandham said. How do you
[54:29] know you got the Holy Ghost? What's the
[54:31] sure evidence you got the Holy Ghost in
[54:32] your life? That scripture right there.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; It's that one. You're going to say amen
[54:38] to the word. You're not just going to
[54:39] say amen to the word, but the the word
[54:41] is going to actually manifest and live
[54:43] out through your life. You're going to
[54:45] die out well to yourself so that he can
[54:49] live
[54:50] &gt;&gt; because you're not being conformed to a
[54:52] church. You're not being conformed to
[54:54] the message. You're not being conformed
[54:56] to an assembly. Legalism will put you in
[54:59] the grave. But this word has the
[55:02] resurrecting power of the living God to
[55:05] get you out because you're not conformed
[55:07] to this word or this world, but you're
[55:10] transformed by the renewing of your
[55:13] mind. You die out to yourself that ye
[55:16] may prove. How do you prove? Your life
[55:19] proves it.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; You can say it all you want, but your
[55:23] actions demonstrate what spirit is
[55:26] motivating you. you may prove what is
[55:29] that good and acceptable and perfect
[55:33] will of God. Remember the word perfect.
[55:36] We know it is in perfection. It's having
[55:39] everything correct. But it's also
[55:41] incomplete.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; That word means complete. It means
[55:45] mature.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Having a mature will of God in your
[55:50] life. No longer children tossed to and
[55:52] fro.
[55:54] Verse three says, "For I say
[55:58] through the grace given unto me to every
[56:01] man that is among you, not to think of
[56:04] himself more highly than he ought to
[56:06] think,
[56:08] but to think soberly
[56:10] according as God hath dealt to every man
[56:14] the measure of faith." Amen.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Remembering that what verse four says,
[56:20] for we have many members in one body and
[56:24] all members have not the same office.
[56:29] So we being many are one body in Christ
[56:32] and everyone members
[56:35] one of another.
[56:38] We're not all individuals. Many times we
[56:41] can say, well, the gentile church, God
[56:43] deals with the gentile church as
[56:44] individuals.
[56:46] He does. But he also has one bride body.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And that one bride body is going to be
[56:52] identified by the attributes of that one
[56:55] spirit. Because every single attribute
[56:58] in that bride body, the spirit, the
[57:00] gifts by the spirit, they're going to
[57:02] all manifest according to that word.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; The devil will come around and
[57:08] impersonate any gift. But there will be
[57:10] an uncertain sound. And if there's an
[57:11] uncertain sound that doesn't ring true
[57:14] with this word, we know it's not the
[57:16] spirit of God because the spirit of God
[57:18] will not deny one word. He will not deny
[57:21] one word. Satan will though. He proved
[57:23] that in the Garden of Eden, didn't he?
[57:25] One word off. The hallmark of Satan.
[57:30] For I say through the grace given unto
[57:31] me, that every man is among you, not to
[57:34] think of himself more highly than he
[57:36] ought to think, but to think soberly,
[57:39] according as God hath dealt to every man
[57:42] the measure of faith. For we have many
[57:45] members in one body, and all members
[57:47] have not the same office. So we being
[57:50] many, are one body in Christ, and
[57:53] everyone members one of another. Having
[57:57] then gifts differing according to the
[57:59] grace that is given to us, whether
[58:02] prophecy, let us prophesy according to
[58:06] the proportion of faith or ministry, let
[58:11] us wait on our ministering. Or he that
[58:15] teacheth on teaching, or he that
[58:18] exhortth on exhortation,
[58:21] he that giveth, let him do it with
[58:24] simplicity,
[58:26] not complicated.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; I want to give, but it's got strings.
[58:30] No, give freely.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; The word of God says not to let the
[58:34] right hand know what the left is doing.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Just to give freely
[58:39] &gt;&gt; because the way we give is the way we'll
[58:41] receive. It's the way that the Lord will
[58:43] deal with us.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; My, it's so beautiful.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Verse eight, or he that exhortth on
[58:51] exhortation, he that giveth, let him do
[58:54] it with simplicity. He that ruleth with
[58:57] diligence. He that showeth mercy, with
[59:00] cheerfulness,
[59:02] let love be without dissimulation.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; And we know that word is without
[59:10] delusion.
[59:11] being diluted, diluting it down. We
[59:14] don't want to let that love be diluted
[59:16] at all.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Dissimulation. Abore that which is evil.
[59:21] Cleave to that which is good.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Now, I just think these next scriptures
[59:27] really get into how the spirit wants to
[59:30] deal within the body, one to another, as
[59:33] we are individuals, but yet we're one
[59:35] body. One member ministers towards the
[59:38] other member. when when we're actually
[59:41] contrary to this, I want to say what
[59:43] kind of spirit is actually influencing
[59:46] us. Cuz verse 10 says, "Be kindly
[59:49] affectionate one to another with
[59:52] brotherly love."
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; In honor, preferring one another,
[59:57] &gt;&gt; not slothful in business, fervent in
[1:00:00] spirit, serving the Lord.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Rejoicing in hope, patient in
[1:00:06] tribulation,
[1:00:07] continuing instant in prayer.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Distributing the necessity of saints,
[1:00:14] given to hospitality,
[1:00:16] bless them which persecute you. Bless
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; and not curse.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And curse not. Sorry. Bless them which
[1:00:27] persecute you. Bless and curse not.
[1:00:31] We're not living under Old Testament
[1:00:33] law, an eye for an eye,
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; A tooth for a tooth.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; What we're doing is we're living under
[1:00:38] grace.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; That unmarited favor that he has given
[1:00:42] us freely.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; My
[1:00:47] rejoice with them that do rejoice, and
[1:00:51] weep with them that weep. Be of the same
[1:00:55] mind, one toward another.
[1:00:59] Mind not high things,
[1:01:02] but condescend
[1:01:04] to men of low estate.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Be not wise in your own conceits.
[1:01:12] I think this is such a a really
[1:01:14] interesting scripture here. Be not wise
[1:01:15] in your own conceits because we could
[1:01:17] see that we have a gift in our life and
[1:01:20] be kind of wise because we got a gift in
[1:01:22] our life.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; My goodness. That's not going to do us
[1:01:26] any good, is it? Recompense to no man
[1:01:29] evil for evil.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Provide things honest in the sight of
[1:01:33] all men. If it be possible, as much as
[1:01:37] lith in you, live peaceibly with all
[1:01:40] men.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; That's an amazing scripture because it
[1:01:45] shows if it be possible as much as lith
[1:01:50] in you, live peaceibly with all men. It
[1:01:54] would actually lead me to believe that
[1:01:56] there's a possibility that you might not
[1:01:58] be able to live peaceibly with all men,
[1:02:00] which is shocking.
[1:02:02] Verse 19, dearly beloved, avenge not
[1:02:06] yourselves, but rather give place unto
[1:02:09] wrath. For it is written, vengeance is
[1:02:11] mine. I will repay, sayaeth the Lord.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed
[1:02:17] him.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; If he thirst, give him drink. For in so
[1:02:21] doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire
[1:02:23] upon his head. Be not overcome of evil,
[1:02:26] but overcome evil with good.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; This makes me think of the scripture
[1:02:30] that we we read about how Elisha, you
[1:02:33] know, he was able to smite those guys
[1:02:36] blind, the Syrians. He smoked them blind
[1:02:38] and he was able to say to them, you know
[1:02:40] what? Don't don't worry to his his his
[1:02:43] student. Don't worry to his his pupil.
[1:02:46] Just watch this. And he went out and
[1:02:48] said, who you looking for? and told them
[1:02:49] and smoked them blind, stood to them
[1:02:51] face to face, the guy they were looking
[1:02:53] for and said, "You know what? I'll take
[1:02:55] you to where he's at." And what they he
[1:02:57] took him and and led them right into a
[1:02:59] trap, led them right into Israel. The
[1:03:00] Syrians brought them right in to where
[1:03:02] the king was. And the king was shocked
[1:03:04] and said, "What should we do? Should we
[1:03:06] smite them? Should we smite them?" And
[1:03:08] he said, "No, no. Scripture says that if
[1:03:12] thine enemy hunger, feed him."
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Right? If if he thirst, give him drink.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Don't don't try and and render evil for
[1:03:23] evil. But in doing so, in doing what the
[1:03:25] scripture says that you'll heap coals of
[1:03:28] fire upon his head. And what happened
[1:03:31] was the Syrians went home and there was
[1:03:33] no more battle. There was no more
[1:03:35] struggle. I think it's so beautiful. I I
[1:03:37] read this tonight because I wanted to
[1:03:39] talk about the the attributes of gifts,
[1:03:42] the attributes of the Holy Ghost in in
[1:03:45] our lives. They actually will line up
[1:03:47] with the word.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; We're not going to render evil for evil.
[1:03:50] We're not going to curse. We're not
[1:03:52] going to be doing all that stuff. What
[1:03:54] we're going to do is actually display
[1:03:56] divine love.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; And if we're displaying anything but
[1:04:00] that, we're under the influence of
[1:04:02] another spirit.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:05] 1964 of perseverant.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Random says, "Well,
[1:04:12] if he is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:04:14] forever," which he is, by the way,
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; sometimes we'll say things, you know, if
[1:04:20] he is, and and I know some people get
[1:04:23] upset by that. I can't help it. That's
[1:04:24] what the prophet says. And I know I've
[1:04:26] said it, but I'm not going to back down
[1:04:28] from it because I know my testimony was
[1:04:31] I said, "If you're God, be God to me."
[1:04:33] Some people need to say that. Brother
[1:04:35] Brandham has said that. We've heard it
[1:04:36] preached before. But but he says here,
[1:04:39] well, if he is the same yesterday,
[1:04:41] today, and forever, only he is not in
[1:04:44] physical form. When he returns like
[1:04:48] that, time is over. He'll take the
[1:04:51] church with him. But he's here in the
[1:04:54] form of the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is where I believe with
[1:04:59] all my heart that most of Christianity
[1:05:01] misses the second coming of the Lord.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; The full return of the Lord according to
[1:05:07] his word because he's not coming to walk
[1:05:10] on this earth. He's coming to take his
[1:05:12] bride.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And when she realizes the prophet said
[1:05:15] it, when the church recognizes what it
[1:05:17] is,
[1:05:19] the rapture is going to go. He didn't
[1:05:22] say when he comes again, then then the
[1:05:24] church is going to go. And maybe he did
[1:05:26] in certain ways, but I'm just referring
[1:05:28] to that one quote specifically where he
[1:05:29] said, "Where the church recognizes what
[1:05:31] it is." But he is here in the form of
[1:05:34] the Holy Ghost to come into me and into
[1:05:37] you and perform his same works. He said
[1:05:41] in John 14:12, "He that believeth on me,
[1:05:43] the works that I do shall he do also."
[1:05:46] Is that right?
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; And we know that, Brother Brandham said
[1:05:49] it very clearly that Mark 16 in action
[1:05:51] is the true church and all else is
[1:05:54] false. And that's where I think some
[1:05:56] people they they really like to dismiss
[1:05:58] that part in the church age book and
[1:05:59] maybe say the church age book is a
[1:06:01] little bit outdated or maybe somebody
[1:06:03] else helped grammatize it so it wasn't
[1:06:04] actually everything that William Mary
[1:06:06] and Brandham said. But you know I I
[1:06:08] think it's a copout because why would we
[1:06:11] not want to see the full manifestation
[1:06:13] of Mark 16 in our lives? Why would we
[1:06:16] not want to see this scripture 14:12? He
[1:06:19] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:06:22] shall he do also. Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; The only reason I could think that maybe
[1:06:28] we would try and make an excuse for that
[1:06:30] is because we've got something off in
[1:06:32] our life that we're just not willing to
[1:06:34] go back and do the harder work to fix so
[1:06:36] that we can see the full manifestation
[1:06:38] of the Holy Ghost in our life. It's not
[1:06:42] easy surrendering, surrendering all the
[1:06:45] way. But the people who have surrendered
[1:06:47] all the way that have had that full full
[1:06:50] surrender experience, you know what I'm
[1:06:52] talking about.
[1:06:54] And if the world is in us and we're
[1:06:57] telling the truth, sorry, if the word is
[1:07:00] in us and we're telling the truth and it
[1:07:02] is the word that he promised for today,
[1:07:05] then isn't the word of God sharper than
[1:07:07] a two-edged sword? Isn't he able to
[1:07:10] surgically remove things from us? Isn't
[1:07:13] he able to to cut hurts out of our life
[1:07:16] and cut out pain that we don't like and
[1:07:19] and take away these things that maybe
[1:07:22] will so easily beset us and hold us
[1:07:24] back?
[1:07:26] His word is sharper than a two-edged
[1:07:28] sword and a discerner of the thoughts
[1:07:30] and intents of the heart. Does the Bible
[1:07:33] say that was not all the prophets could
[1:07:37] discern in the thoughts in the people's
[1:07:40] mind? Is that right? Why?
[1:07:44] It was the word that was in them. It was
[1:07:48] the word that was in them. It wasn't
[1:07:50] them doing it.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Many times people will say that about
[1:07:54] William Brham. It wasn't him doing it.
[1:07:58] He was just standing there when the
[1:08:00] angel of the Lord came.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; And when he came, then he was just a
[1:08:05] conduit.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; He said that's how they were vindicated.
[1:08:11] That was their credentials.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; I think this is so beautiful because
[1:08:15] many times we can look at our lives and
[1:08:17] say that we've got all these
[1:08:18] credentials. I can say that I can fix
[1:08:21] this and I can fix that and I can do the
[1:08:23] other. All of it is for nothing. We know
[1:08:26] that Paul who was a Pharisee of
[1:08:27] Pharisees before God knocked him off of
[1:08:30] his spiritual high horse right on his
[1:08:34] way to persecute the church.
[1:08:37] After that happened, he went into Arabia
[1:08:39] and he came back and said, "You know
[1:08:40] what? I had to go through everything in
[1:08:41] my life. I had to take a full accounting
[1:08:43] of everything that I thought I knew in
[1:08:46] my life to find out that IT'S ALL DONE.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING. All of my
[1:08:52] credentials
[1:08:54] are worthless
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; because I realize I've been doing it
[1:08:59] wrong."
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. There are
[1:09:01] credentials, brothers and sisters. And
[1:09:04] the credentials are the vindication of
[1:09:06] his word in our lives by his word
[1:09:09] following us by the gifts manifesting in
[1:09:12] our lives by our ability to serve him
[1:09:16] day in and day out.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; He says that's how they were vindicated.
[1:09:20] That was their credentials. None of them
[1:09:22] belonged to an organization. Not one
[1:09:24] never did. Their credentials was their
[1:09:27] ministry.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; So beautiful. God said, "If there be one
[1:09:32] among you who is spiritual or a prophet
[1:09:36] and what he says comes to pass, then
[1:09:38] hear him." Right?
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And it must not be must must not just be
[1:09:45] once. It must be continually all the
[1:09:49] time.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. from prophets.
[1:09:52] There is a gift of prophecy that's in
[1:09:54] the church
[1:09:56] which is to be examined
[1:09:59] by the examiners
[1:10:01] before it can be told to the church. Of
[1:10:04] course,
[1:10:05] let it be before two or three judges and
[1:10:09] then it's told to her. And we know
[1:10:12] brother Brandham says the very same
[1:10:14] thing. He repeats what Paul says that
[1:10:16] that's the same thing with tongues and
[1:10:19] the interpretation of tongues. When you
[1:10:21] get into these gifts manifesting in the
[1:10:23] church, there is a specific church
[1:10:25] order. If there is a gift of prophecy in
[1:10:29] the church, which they're supposed to
[1:10:30] be, it has to be handled correctly. It
[1:10:33] has to be judged. It doesn't just get to
[1:10:36] manifest in the congregation. If it does
[1:10:39] just manifest in the congregation, it's
[1:10:41] out of order according to the word of
[1:10:43] God.
[1:10:44] Same with speaking in tonesues. There
[1:10:46] has to be an interpretation of it and it
[1:10:49] has to be a very specific event, a very
[1:10:51] specific meaning. We're going to get
[1:10:52] into tongues tonight. We're talking
[1:10:54] about prophecy. Prophecy is a very
[1:10:57] interesting discussion. Tonight, while
[1:10:58] we were at the supper table, Christopher
[1:11:00] asked me, "What is the difference? What
[1:11:03] are we talking about prophecy? We're
[1:11:05] talking about a prophet." And I said,
[1:11:06] "No, son. There's a difference between
[1:11:08] the gift of prophecy in the church and
[1:11:10] actually a prophet. Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; And and and the I'll say the third part
[1:11:16] which can make it really confusing is
[1:11:18] there are people who are smaller
[1:11:21] prophets and they're still around
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; but there's no more major prophets.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; The only major prophets that are going
[1:11:29] to be seen on this earth are two
[1:11:31] witnesses that are headed to Israel. And
[1:11:34] I can't help but think just any day now
[1:11:36] we're going to see them there.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; But those are the only prophets that are
[1:11:40] coming. There is not a a an eighth age
[1:11:43] messenger after William Brham
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; as some might suppose. There's not a
[1:11:49] continuation of his ministry in the
[1:11:51] lineage of the Brham family as some
[1:11:55] might suppose. Even though I would say
[1:11:58] this, he said Joseph is a prophet.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Joseph has a prophetic gift, but that
[1:12:04] doesn't mean there's another age
[1:12:06] prophet. And if anything that Joseph
[1:12:08] said takes us away from what William
[1:12:11] Brham said, then he needs to be
[1:12:13] accursed. Now, I'm not saying that we
[1:12:15] want to curse anyone. THAT'S WHAT PAUL
[1:12:17] SAID. Because if anybody says anything
[1:12:19] other than what they've already said,
[1:12:22] then let him be accursed.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; If he's in line with the word, he's
[1:12:27] going to say what his daddy said.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; If he's in line with the word, he's
[1:12:30] going TO SAY WHAT PAUL SAID.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be different.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Right? Now, I'm not throwing off on
[1:12:36] Joseph Brham. I've never met him before.
[1:12:38] I love him. I believe he's my brother
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; and I believe that we'll be there with
[1:12:43] him.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not throwing off on that. What I
[1:12:46] am doing is I will throw off on the
[1:12:48] spirit that would try and take him and
[1:12:50] exalt him.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; There are people who are prophets who
[1:12:55] will be minor prophets. God will use
[1:12:57] them as a prophet to go and do something
[1:13:00] that he needs done. Maybe go right up
[1:13:02] and talk to someone and say, "Thus
[1:13:04] sayaith the Lord, you need to get this
[1:13:06] straight in your life."
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt that for a second.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; If you ever hear that, you have that
[1:13:11] crossroad now.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Either it's going to be false and that
[1:13:15] guy's a liar or it's going to be right
[1:13:17] on the money and you're going to know
[1:13:19] that you just heard from God.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean there's any change
[1:13:22] to the church age message. Amen.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; There's a gift of prophecy
[1:13:28] that can be in the church and someone
[1:13:30] can have that gift and that gift is to
[1:13:32] profit the whole body with all. It is
[1:13:34] not for that person to actually become
[1:13:38] I'm prophetic now and everybody should
[1:13:40] watch it because I've got a gift and I
[1:13:43] could actually prophesy something that
[1:13:45] could come to pass and you better be
[1:13:46] afraid. That's not the way God does
[1:13:48] stuff. Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; There's a gift of prophecy that's in the
[1:13:52] church which is to be examined by the
[1:13:55] examiners before it can be told to the
[1:13:58] church. Of course, let it be before two
[1:14:01] or three judges and then it's told to
[1:14:03] her. So, we have the church age
[1:14:05] prophets. We have the major prophets in
[1:14:08] the Bible and and those are the
[1:14:10] prophetic offices. They're born prophets
[1:14:12] from their mother's womb. And then we
[1:14:14] have other people that have gifts of
[1:14:17] prophecy. And we know that gifts and
[1:14:19] callings are without repentance. But I
[1:14:21] think there's something really
[1:14:22] interesting here. We we might just take
[1:14:24] a little little minute or two and talk
[1:14:26] about it. There's a possibility for
[1:14:28] someone to have a prophetic gift and be
[1:14:31] under the influence of an evil spirit.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Because brothers and sisters, we're
[1:14:35] either under the influence of the Holy
[1:14:37] Spirit or under the influence of an evil
[1:14:39] spirit. There's no middle ground, you
[1:14:42] know, kind of good spirits that aren't
[1:14:43] just really the Holy Spirit. It's one or
[1:14:45] the other. If it's not the Holy Spirit,
[1:14:47] it's an evil spirit.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; There's people that can have a gift of
[1:14:52] prophecy and be fully under the
[1:14:55] influence of an evil spirit.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; There's people that can have the gift of
[1:15:00] music
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; and be under the influence of an evil
[1:15:05] spirit.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without
[1:15:07] repentance. People are born with the
[1:15:09] gifts in their lives. And what they do
[1:15:10] with that gift manifests the spirit
[1:15:13] that's actually living out through them.
[1:15:15] Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; If they take their gift and offer it as
[1:15:18] the musicians do continually, service
[1:15:20] after service, they offer it to God as a
[1:15:23] sacrifice, as a free will offering, it
[1:15:26] demonstrates what spirit is influencing
[1:15:29] them.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Their desire is to bring and set an
[1:15:32] atmosphere for the body of Christ. It's
[1:15:35] to profit every man with all. When we
[1:15:37] come into the building and we feel that
[1:15:39] atmosphere that that that spirit of God
[1:15:42] that's moving in the building, it's
[1:15:44] because people have dedicated their
[1:15:47] gifts back to God.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; That's what these gifts are for, to
[1:15:52] profit every man with all. But there's
[1:15:55] the the major prophets and then there's
[1:15:58] the gift of prophecy. And the gift of
[1:16:00] prophecy is to profit the body to
[1:16:04] actually help.
[1:16:06] It's going to be something that benefits
[1:16:08] the body.
[1:16:10] You know, in second Peter, it says, "We
[1:16:13] have also a more sure word of prophecy."
[1:16:15] I think it's just amazing. We were in a
[1:16:17] Bible study last night and we're talking
[1:16:19] about worshiping worshiping. They're
[1:16:22] talking about out of the church. We're
[1:16:23] studying the church age book and we got
[1:16:24] into Satan's seat in in the Pergamian
[1:16:26] church age. And it's just such a
[1:16:28] powerful rich study. You could do it
[1:16:30] over and over and over and over and
[1:16:32] never ever get bored of the church age
[1:16:34] book. But we're talking about Satan's
[1:16:35] seed and the power of that. And you know
[1:16:37] how we we worship in spirit and in
[1:16:40] truth. And you know what age have people
[1:16:43] ever been able to worship in spirit and
[1:16:45] in truth like this age? There's never
[1:16:48] been an age, brothers and sisters. We'll
[1:16:50] say maybe the lid of hell has taken off
[1:16:52] and it's such a dark evil age and we've
[1:16:54] got so much persecution of all the
[1:16:55] spirits around. But you know we have
[1:16:57] such a manifestation of the spirit as
[1:16:59] well.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; It is not actually being wiped out. The
[1:17:03] spirit of God is not being snuffed out
[1:17:04] by the darkness in this world. In fact,
[1:17:07] the spirit of God is being magnified and
[1:17:09] amplified through the surrender of the
[1:17:12] bride in this age. It it's it's amazing
[1:17:15] to see it. We have also a more sure word
[1:17:18] of prophecy. We have been given the
[1:17:20] ability to worship. When Jesus met that
[1:17:23] woman at the well, he said,"Woman, you
[1:17:25] don't even know who you worship, but
[1:17:27] there's coming a day, I assure you,
[1:17:29] where people will worship, and they will
[1:17:31] worship in spirit and in truth." In
[1:17:34] fact, you know what? It's not even going
[1:17:35] to be possible to worship outside of
[1:17:38] worshiping in spirit and in truth. Jesus
[1:17:40] told that woman that, but there's a
[1:17:42] people he was speaking about, and I just
[1:17:44] can't help but think that's a group of
[1:17:46] people that would be around in the end
[1:17:47] time saying, "I believe the full word of
[1:17:50] God. I believe the seventh angel's
[1:17:53] message. We also have a more sure word
[1:17:56] of prophecy where unto ye do well that
[1:17:59] ye take heed as unto a light that
[1:18:02] shineth in a dark place until the dawn.
[1:18:05] Oh my. And the day star arise in your
[1:18:10] hearts.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; When that day star arises in our hearts,
[1:18:13] brothers and sisters, maybe it will be
[1:18:14] the Mount Zion showdown. We know the
[1:18:16] Mount Zion showdown is not going to be a
[1:18:18] third pole manifestation of seeing limbs
[1:18:21] restored. It's not going to be that.
[1:18:23] What that's going to be is actually the
[1:18:24] rapture.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Well, all that's filthy just they're
[1:18:28] just going to be filthy still. They're
[1:18:29] not going to be able to be anything
[1:18:31] other than what they are. And whoever's
[1:18:32] holy is going to be holy. They're going
[1:18:34] to be in a body change. That's what's
[1:18:36] going to happen. And that's happening.
[1:18:37] It's happening right now. How is it
[1:18:39] happening? Day by day, every single time
[1:18:41] we eat this word and it actually changes
[1:18:44] our body. It changes our character. It's
[1:18:46] coming from the inside out. I think it
[1:18:49] don't you think it's amazing how it's
[1:18:51] coming from the inside and working its
[1:18:53] way out.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; We've heard it said many times, these
[1:18:56] bodies will not be able to contain the
[1:18:57] level of revelation that's coming.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And what is that revelation? That
[1:19:02] revelation is that we are the word made
[1:19:04] flesh today.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; There was a time where the word was made
[1:19:09] flesh and dwelt among us. But now that
[1:19:12] word is made flesh and dwelling in us.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? It's so magnificent
[1:19:18] to think
[1:19:20] this day star is arising in our hearts.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; I I just it gets me excited. Talking
[1:19:26] about prophecy recognizing that it's a
[1:19:28] gift in the church.
[1:19:30] You know, in uh my goodness, 1964, I'm
[1:19:34] going to read this one and then we got
[1:19:35] another scripture here. I got to get
[1:19:36] going. Um 1964, the voice of the sign.
[1:19:40] Brother Brandham says, "Now we find out
[1:19:42] what Moses said come to pass." See, that
[1:19:45] made him a vindicated seer. That was his
[1:19:48] credentials. Here we go with the
[1:19:49] credentials again because what he said
[1:19:52] happened. He said, "About this time
[1:19:54] tomorrow, there will be fleas all over
[1:19:56] the ground." And there was. This time
[1:19:58] tomorrow, there will be so and so. And
[1:20:00] there was. It must hit exactly on the
[1:20:03] dot. Not just haphazard.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Not just sometimes it's got to be
[1:20:08] exactly bullseye.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; So many men today, if you'll excuse this
[1:20:14] just for a minute, and I'm I'm no judge,
[1:20:17] just passing a personal opinion. Many
[1:20:20] man has raised up good spiritfilled men
[1:20:22] and they try go out. Maybe the Lord give
[1:20:25] them a gift of prophecy. Now, there's a
[1:20:28] million miles difference between a gift
[1:20:30] of prophecy and a prophet.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; A prophet fulfills exactly the word of
[1:20:38] God with thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; A gift of prophecy does something a
[1:20:43] little bit different. He says it here, a
[1:20:44] gift of prophecy must be judged by three
[1:20:47] before it can even be passed into the
[1:20:51] church.
[1:20:53] So someone who might have a gift of
[1:20:55] prophecy according to what the prophet
[1:20:58] said. Now we all believe the prophet in
[1:20:59] the day in which we live. Hey everyone
[1:21:01] here in this church according to Calgary
[1:21:03] living word assembly we believe in the
[1:21:06] seventh angel message. So that means
[1:21:08] that a gift of prophecy must be judged
[1:21:10] by three before it can be passed into
[1:21:13] the church. We know it's the same as
[1:21:16] speaking in tongues. It must go before
[1:21:18] three judges before it can even be given
[1:21:20] to the church. This is not just what
[1:21:22] William Brandham said. This is what Paul
[1:21:24] the apostle said when he set out the
[1:21:26] pattern, the foundation for every single
[1:21:28] church age.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; He says now we find out now that these
[1:21:31] men go out sometimes and then people
[1:21:34] begin to press upon them. Oh brother,
[1:21:36] what will you say? See, he goes by
[1:21:39] impression. See the way he feels.
[1:21:43] Why the Lord will do that? Thus sayaith
[1:21:46] the Lord. That's a lie. See
[1:21:49] you. You can't say thus sayaith the Lord
[1:21:52] until God in his own language has spoke
[1:21:55] to you and told you that then it's not
[1:21:58] you saying it not your impression the
[1:22:02] Bible said if a prophet did that was
[1:22:05] going on presumptuously
[1:22:08] that is presuming and presuming is to
[1:22:11] adventure without authority he's going
[1:22:15] upon his own but when you see this is
[1:22:18] what brother Bradam is saying here this
[1:22:20] is the seventh angel messenger here
[1:22:22] saying these words. I believe the Holy
[1:22:24] Ghost through the messenger to the bride
[1:22:26] stored up food for a season, for this
[1:22:28] season. We take this food and we eat it
[1:22:31] up or not. But when you see the man
[1:22:35] speaking, what's going to happen in the
[1:22:37] name of the Lord? And it happens day in
[1:22:40] and out, week in and out, month in and
[1:22:44] out, year in and out, which is the
[1:22:47] ministry of William Mary and Brandham.
[1:22:50] that you know that come from God. See,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; that's God's credentials.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful to think that's God's
[1:22:58] credentials to the man that he is the
[1:23:00] interpreter of the written word for that
[1:23:03] day because God sent the man to do it.
[1:23:06] You know what I want to do tonight,
[1:23:07] brothers and sisters, is encourage us to
[1:23:09] remember that when we see the
[1:23:11] manifestation of these gifts in our
[1:23:13] lives, when we see our ability to say
[1:23:15] amen to the word, then we can see the
[1:23:18] credentials of God in our very own
[1:23:21] lives.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; We need to see his credentials in our
[1:23:25] lives.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; And the ultimate credential is the
[1:23:28] ability for us to actually be
[1:23:29] transformed into a saint. To go from
[1:23:32] being a cuckle bird to being a wheat.
[1:23:34] How does that happen? by the renewing of
[1:23:36] our mind
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; that we could be transformed
[1:23:40] into a new creature. Brother Brandham,
[1:23:42] he goes on to say, "If the churches only
[1:23:44] could have some good sound teaching on
[1:23:47] these things, see, they would understand
[1:23:49] it."
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I hope tonight and every night we talk
[1:23:52] about these gifts that this is good
[1:23:54] sound teaching because we're saying what
[1:23:56] he said.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; this is what he said.
[1:23:59] He says only thing we get a little a
[1:24:02] little we get one little track and we
[1:24:04] run excuse me like wild with it.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; That's just taking on that one thing and
[1:24:10] just making a hobby out of it. That's
[1:24:12] what every denomination originated from.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Taking something and just running out
[1:24:18] there with it. You know, we talk about
[1:24:20] the gifts and and I hope that people
[1:24:22] don't think that we're taking the gifts
[1:24:24] and making a little hobby out of it. I'm
[1:24:26] not trying to do that. I'm trying to
[1:24:28] shine a light on it to say that that is
[1:24:29] a part of the body for the body
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; and we mustn't be afraid of it. If we
[1:24:35] are afraid of it, I want to ask the
[1:24:36] question why. Why are we afraid of
[1:24:39] gifts? Why would we be afraid of gifts?
[1:24:41] It's part of the word of God. That's
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. Let's turn over to first
[1:24:44] Corinthians chapter 13 tonight
[1:24:48] with the few minutes that we have left.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[1:24:54] Very familiar scripture, I'm sure.
[1:24:58] talking about the gift of prophecy
[1:25:01] and how important it is to recognize
[1:25:03] that we can have it, but there's
[1:25:06] something else that we need to have in
[1:25:08] order for that to actually be legitimate
[1:25:10] in our lives.
[1:25:12] Verse one of 1 Corinthians chapter 13,
[1:25:15] though I speak with the tongues of men
[1:25:17] and angels and have not charity,
[1:25:21] I become as a sounding brass and a
[1:25:24] tinkling symbol.
[1:25:26] You know, once upon a time I I brought
[1:25:28] that picture up and I'll just try and
[1:25:30] paint the picture tonight of that little
[1:25:33] sometimes you'd see it as a little
[1:25:35] stuffed doll.
[1:25:37] And uh it's it's many times got little
[1:25:41] symbols and what it does is it just has
[1:25:44] symbols on its hands and it just claps.
[1:25:46] You can wind it up on the back and all
[1:25:47] it does is it just claps these symbols
[1:25:49] together and it's a kids toy. And you
[1:25:51] know, I just can't help but think about
[1:25:53] that every time I read this scripture
[1:25:55] here. What is charity? We know that
[1:25:57] charity is the Holy Ghost. Some people
[1:25:58] would say love. And truly, indeed, it is
[1:26:01] love. But it's more than love. It's
[1:26:04] truly the love of Christ.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not ailio love. It's not
[1:26:09] human love. It's agape love. It's the
[1:26:11] the love of God. It's divine love. It's
[1:26:15] being, you know, able to actually line
[1:26:17] up with the word of God every single
[1:26:19] time. Even if it takes our hide, even if
[1:26:21] it hurts to say, "Be it unto me
[1:26:23] according to thy word." If we don't have
[1:26:26] that in our lives, doesn't matter
[1:26:28] whether we speak with the tongues of men
[1:26:29] and angels, does it? We have got to have
[1:26:33] charity in our lives. The Holy Ghost, as
[1:26:36] our brother prayed earlier, I am become
[1:26:39] as a sounding brass or a tinkling
[1:26:41] symbol. And I love how Paul does this.
[1:26:44] He does it in such a way that he puts
[1:26:46] himself in the seat. He's not taking it
[1:26:49] and throwing it out there and saying,
[1:26:51] "You are a sounding brass and a tinkling
[1:26:54] symbol." He says it, "Though I, the age
[1:26:58] messenger, the one setting the pattern
[1:27:00] for all the ages, speak with tongues of
[1:27:02] men and angels, but have not charity, I
[1:27:05] am become as a sounding brass and a
[1:27:06] tingling symbol." And what's going to
[1:27:08] happen? You're going to hear that
[1:27:09] clapping of that symbol, and you're
[1:27:10] going to tune it out and think, "That's
[1:27:11] annoying. I don't want to hear that
[1:27:13] anymore.
[1:27:14] We don't want to do that with the
[1:27:16] scripture.
[1:27:18] And though I have the gift of prophecy
[1:27:20] and understand all mysteries
[1:27:24] and all knowledge, and though I HAVE ALL
[1:27:27] FAITH SO THAT I COULD REMOVE MOUNTAINS
[1:27:29] and have not charity, I am nothing.
[1:27:34] And though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:27:38] the poor,
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; and though I give my body to be burned,
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; and have not charity, it profitth me
[1:27:47] nothing. Right.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Charity,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; love, agape love, divine love, the
[1:27:55] literal life of Jesus Christ in our
[1:27:58] lives, in our marriages, in our
[1:28:02] relationships, in our body of believers,
[1:28:06] suffereth long.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; And is kind.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Charity envieth not.
[1:28:13] I don't want to go and do what someone
[1:28:14] else is doing. I I just want to stay in
[1:28:17] my lane. I want to stay exactly where
[1:28:19] God put me to be.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; It envth not. Charity vaunteth not
[1:28:27] itself.
[1:28:28] Doesn't have to be the first. Doesn't
[1:28:31] have to be the best.
[1:28:33] Is not puffed up.
[1:28:37] Does not behave itself unseemly.
[1:28:41] Seekth not her own. is not easily
[1:28:44] provoked. Thinkketh no evil,
[1:28:48] rejoicth not in iniquity when I see that
[1:28:52] brother and I know that he's so wrong.
[1:28:54] Look at him.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; I know what he does. I know what he
[1:28:57] says. I know what he watches and what he
[1:29:00] listens to. I'm so glad that I don't do
[1:29:02] that.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That's not according to the word of God.
[1:29:07] So, what spirit is influencing you to
[1:29:09] have those words? Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Rejoiceth not in iniquity. When we see
[1:29:15] that, we're going to go and pray for
[1:29:17] that person.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; We're going to try and encourage them
[1:29:20] and to say, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
[1:29:21] THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCORDING to the word.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Not going to rejoice in it,
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; but rejoicth in truth.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Beareth all things, believeth all
[1:29:34] things, hopeeth all things, endureth
[1:29:38] most things. cuz you know some of them
[1:29:41] are really hard and I just can't really
[1:29:42] go that far you know there's just that
[1:29:45] that hurt that you know you don't know
[1:29:47] how much that hurt right you you don't
[1:29:49] know what I had to go through no right
[1:29:53] endureth all things
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; able to endureth all things why is that
[1:29:58] because we're talking about charity
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; charity is able to endureth all things
[1:30:02] we can't
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; how on earth could you ever endure
[1:30:06] continually hearing brother Barry preach
[1:30:07] over and over and over again. But I'll
[1:30:10] tell you what, the Holy Ghost can do it
[1:30:11] in you.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Charity never faileth.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; But whether there be prophecies,
[1:30:20] they shall fail.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Whether there be tongues, they shall
[1:30:24] cease. Whether there be knowledge, it
[1:30:27] shall vanish away.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; I think that's so good because you know
[1:30:32] our credentials, our credentials are
[1:30:34] worth nothing. They're dumb. His
[1:30:37] credentials though are everything.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; His credentials to a Christian believer
[1:30:43] are absolutely everything. That is what
[1:30:46] we're looking for in our lives. Verse 9
[1:30:48] says, "For we know in part and we
[1:30:50] prophesy in part." Can you imagine Paul
[1:30:54] the Apostle writing these words and and
[1:30:57] and expressing his heart in the day in
[1:30:59] which he lives? We know in part and we
[1:31:01] prophesy in part. But when that which is
[1:31:04] perfect is come, when is that going to
[1:31:06] happen? Brothers and sisters, that's why
[1:31:08] I get so excited and that's why I'm
[1:31:09] excited tonight. When that which is
[1:31:11] perfect has come, when's that going to
[1:31:12] happen? Anybody know the day, the time,
[1:31:16] nobody knows the day or the hour when
[1:31:18] he's coming, right? To take his bride
[1:31:20] away. Nobody can put a pinpoint on that.
[1:31:23] But I can tell you one thing is for
[1:31:25] sure. And I'll say it this way, not
[1:31:27] because I have a gift of anything other
[1:31:29] than the ability to recognize the
[1:31:32] revelation of the open word in the day
[1:31:34] in which we live. When that which is
[1:31:35] perfect is come, it's already come,
[1:31:37] brothers and sisters. We have been given
[1:31:40] the full word, the opening of the word
[1:31:42] in the day in WHICH WE LIVE. THAT WHICH
[1:31:44] IS PERFECT IS COME. So when THAT WHICH
[1:31:46] IS PERFECT IS COME, THEN THAT WHICH IS
[1:31:48] IN PART SHALL BE DONE AWAY.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING FABLES. WE'RE NOT
[1:31:54] LOOKING AFTER DENOMINATIONAL WAYS. THAT
[1:31:57] WHICH IS PERFECT IS COME. THE FULL
[1:31:59] REVELATION OF THE WORD. That's what
[1:32:01] gives us the ability to worship in
[1:32:03] spirit and in truth is that revelation.
[1:32:05] Brothers and sisters, when we have that
[1:32:07] revelation, that revelation unlocks the
[1:32:09] full power of this word we're TALKING
[1:32:11] ABOUT. THE HOLY GHOST CAN worship
[1:32:13] through us in spirit and in truth.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; And when that happens, THAT'S WHEN
[1:32:18] VICTORIES ARE WON. THAT'S WHEN BATTLES
[1:32:20] are fought. That's when enemies are
[1:32:22] slaying. We can look back through the
[1:32:24] Old Testament. He's the same yesterday,
[1:32:26] today, and forever. All of the victories
[1:32:28] were WON AT THE SHOUT OF PRAISE.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; When that which is perfect is come,
[1:32:35] which is now.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; That which is in part shall be done
[1:32:40] away. I think this is so good. When I
[1:32:42] was a child, I spake as a child. And I
[1:32:44] understood as a child. I thought as a
[1:32:47] child,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; but when I became a man, I put away
[1:32:50] childish things.
[1:32:52] And I think it this way, brothers and
[1:32:53] sisters, when we read this here, we're
[1:32:57] not just talking about riding a a a
[1:33:00] tricycle.
[1:33:01] We're not talking about playing with the
[1:33:03] little windup doll that just claps the
[1:33:05] symbols.
[1:33:07] What we're talking about is recognizing
[1:33:09] the revelation that we're living under.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Recognizing that we're no longer
[1:33:14] worshiping under partial truth. We're
[1:33:17] we're worshiping under the seventh seal.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Which is literally Jesus Christ.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Manifesting in his bride body to this
[1:33:26] world in which we live in. When I was a
[1:33:29] child, I spake as a child. I DIDN'T
[1:33:30] UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:33:32] NOBODY ever told me that God sent a
[1:33:34] prophet. But one day I heard that God
[1:33:36] sent a prophet to this age. AND I SAID,
[1:33:38] "WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?"
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; He could discern your heart.
[1:33:42] Hi.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[1:33:46] Ah, religion is all just money-making
[1:33:48] scheme. It's all a lie. The devil,
[1:33:50] they're all just living under a
[1:33:52] business. They all just want your money.
[1:33:54] I understood as a child, that's what
[1:33:56] everybody talked about. I even thought
[1:33:58] about it as a child. But when I became a
[1:34:00] man, I recognized charity.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; I recognized what was going on. That
[1:34:07] which is perfect is truly come. And I
[1:34:10] had to look around and say, "How many
[1:34:12] people in this world actually know
[1:34:14] this?"
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Is this just something that I've
[1:34:17] learned?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; And you look around and you see
[1:34:19] believers here in the body and and you
[1:34:21] look over there and you see believers
[1:34:22] over there in another body, but there's
[1:34:25] not many people that can recognize what
[1:34:27] we're talking about here. Many people
[1:34:29] will SAY, "BROTHER BARRY, YOU SOUND LIKE
[1:34:30] A FANATIC TONIGHT." AND I'M SO GLAD THAT
[1:34:33] I CAN SAY I'm one of them.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of these days they're going to
[1:34:38] look for us and we'll be gone.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[1:34:45] I understood as a child. I thought as a
[1:34:47] child. When I became a man, I put away
[1:34:49] all that childish stuff. I recognize
[1:34:51] there's nothing good in me. It's only
[1:34:53] that charity. It's only that word that
[1:34:56] Jesus Christ that has become manifest in
[1:34:58] flesh. Once again,
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Goes on to say this. Now we see through
[1:35:03] a glass darkly in the age in which he
[1:35:05] lived in. He knew that there was
[1:35:07] something else coming. We know that he
[1:35:09] knew it. We know that Daniel knew it. We
[1:35:12] know that John knew it. They all look
[1:35:13] for it. They all desired to see this.
[1:35:16] Even angels desired to look upon the
[1:35:18] seventh seal to see what William
[1:35:20] Brandham preached there in
[1:35:21] Jeffersonville, Indiana. And we can just
[1:35:23] take it and play it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; We can just take it and read it.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; We can just talk about it.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; We can sing about it. But do we really
[1:35:31] really benefit from it? DO WE REALLY SEE
[1:35:34] THE LITERAL LIFE OF THE SEVENTH seal in
[1:35:37] our lives? I think it's so beautiful.
[1:35:39] Now we look through a glass darkly as
[1:35:41] Paul said. But then when
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; But then when
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; face to face,
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; now I know in part. But then when then
[1:35:52] shall I know even as I also am known.
[1:35:56] Amen. My and now abideth faith, hope,
[1:35:58] and charity. these three, but the
[1:36:00] greatest of these is Jesus Christ. The
[1:36:04] same yesterday, today, and forever. I'll
[1:36:07] call the musicians as we close tonight.
[1:36:10] Brothers and sisters, there is a gift of
[1:36:12] prophecy. But we heard about it in the
[1:36:14] word tonight. It's going to hit the
[1:36:16] bullseye every single time. And if there
[1:36:19] is a gift of prophecy in the church,
[1:36:21] according to the scripture, there is.
[1:36:24] I'm not saying there is. But I'm just
[1:36:25] saying if there is, then it needs to
[1:36:27] happen exactly according to the word.
[1:36:29] Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; It has to be judged by witnesses in
[1:36:32] order for it to be legitimate.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. Maybe stand with
[1:36:36] me as we close. Gracious heavenly
[1:36:39] father, we're so thankful for the
[1:36:40] revelation that you have given us, Lord.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; The word for our day. We know that
[1:36:44] revelation is what unlocks our ability
[1:36:47] to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[1:36:51] And Father, we know that unless we're
[1:36:53] worshiping you in spirit and in truth,
[1:36:56] we're not even worshiping you.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; We're worshiping Satan, the God of this
[1:37:01] evil age. And that is what your prophet
[1:37:04] said to us. That's what you said to us
[1:37:06] through your prophet. Oh Lord, help us
[1:37:08] to push aside all of our thoughts, all
[1:37:10] of our thinking, all of our carnality
[1:37:12] and traditions and just give way to you,
[1:37:15] Lord. That you could live out through
[1:37:17] us, that you could worship through us,
[1:37:19] that you could pray through us, that you
[1:37:21] could sing through us, that you could
[1:37:22] play music through us. Oh, Father, that
[1:37:25] you could live out through us every
[1:37:26] single day of our lives.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Help us to die to ourselves well. Help
[1:37:31] us to die to ourselves well, Lord Jesus.
[1:37:34] Father, that you could live. Oh, Father,
[1:37:37] we love you and we thank you for your
[1:37:38] word. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that we
[1:37:40] don't have to look for you. We know that
[1:37:43] you're here, oh Lord, in your fullness,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we're not looking through a
[1:37:48] glass darkly,
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; but face to face.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to think about
[1:37:54] these things as we go to sleep tonight,
[1:37:56] Lord. Yes, sir.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; As we recognize how far down the road we
[1:37:59] really are, one of these days, someone's
[1:38:02] going to hit the button and all the
[1:38:03] bombs are going to drop. But father,
[1:38:06] before one of them can go off, you told
[1:38:08] us that we have a place already prepared
[1:38:10] for us. Oh father, you said you had to
[1:38:12] go away, that there will be many
[1:38:14] mansions for us. And we thank you for
[1:38:17] that revelation, Lord. Thank you for
[1:38:19] bringing us blessed assurance, Lord,
[1:38:21] that we know that we will not perish.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Father, oh Lord, we thank you for the
[1:38:26] manifold revelation that you've given
[1:38:28] us. Thank you for your word. But most of
[1:38:30] all, Lord Jesus, thank you for you.
[1:38:34] Thank you, Lord Jesus, that you are
[1:38:36] alive and well, that you are the same
[1:38:38] yesterday, today, and forever, living
[1:38:40] out through your bride.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; We just ask now, Lord, that you would
[1:38:43] keep your hand upon us as we have to
[1:38:45] part ways one more time on this side of
[1:38:48] eternity. Lord, we don't know how many
[1:38:50] more times we'll be able to get together
[1:38:52] and worship.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Father, you could call us home before
[1:38:55] this service is over, before we even
[1:38:57] make it back to our homes tonight. We
[1:39:00] don't know. But if it's your will for us
[1:39:02] to gather again on Sunday, Lord, we'll
[1:39:04] bring a song of praise, Lord. Father,
[1:39:06] we'll go and get ourselves good and
[1:39:08] ready to come and bring you a sacrifice
[1:39:11] of praise that you, the King of Kings
[1:39:13] and Lord of Lords, is worthy of.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you tonight. And we
[1:39:17] thank you for your goodness. We pray
[1:39:19] that you would just keep your hand upon
[1:39:21] each one of us, Lord, as we go our
[1:39:23] separate ways.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Father, watch over the Panettas, Lord.
[1:39:27] We ask in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song? Word of God
[1:39:35] ever true.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Holy word. Holy word.
[1:39:45] Long preserved
[1:39:48] for our
[1:39:51] in this world.
[1:39:53] They resound
[1:39:56] with God's own heart. Oh, let the
[1:40:00] ancient words impart.
[1:40:04] Word of God,
[1:40:06] it's ever true.
[1:40:10] Changing me,
[1:40:12] changing you.
[1:40:15] We have come with open hearts. Oh, let
[1:40:21] the word of God impart.
[1:40:26] Words of life,
[1:40:29] words of hope,
[1:40:32] gives us strength,
[1:40:34] helps us
[1:40:37] in this world
[1:40:40] where we go. The word of God will guide
[1:40:45] us.
[1:40:48] Word of God
[1:40:51] ever true.
[1:40:53] Changing me.
[1:40:56] changing you.
[1:40:59] We have come with open hearts. Oh, let
[1:41:04] the word of God impart.
[1:41:11] Holy words
