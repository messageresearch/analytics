an honor and a privilege to look out and see everyone's smiling face we just want to go to the Lord in prayer this morning and uh just have a couple of requests one unspoken request and we'd like to remember sister Tina who is ICU this morning and I believe it's related to her heart condition so let's just go to the Lord in prayer for her if you have a need this morning maybe just make it known unto him with an uplift hand gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning we thank you Father that you are Lord Heavenly Father we know that we can only call you Lord by the Holy Ghost and father many people want to call you Jesus many people want to claim the blood father but Lord not many really want to have you Lord over their lives and father this morning we just pray that we could consecrate ourselves fresh unto you once again Lord if there's anything in our lives Lord Jesus that would be displeasing unto you we just ask Lord that we could commit it unto you father that we could just ask you to forgive us just now Lord and invite you Lord Jesus to have the preeminence in our hearts Lord in our minds in our souls father Lord if we need a little filling of your Holy Spirit Lord Jesus we just want to lift our cups unto you right now and ask you Lord just give us a little top up in our our cups Lord Jesus that father this morning when we approach you we could do it with confidence Lord God that we could know that there's nothing standing in the way of our prayers father that we can have confidence in our hearts towards you Lord Jesus father this morning morning we just want to come together as a body of Believers father oh Lord from Calgary and Edmonton and maybe all around father many different parts and Lord we just want to stand together United for these prayer requests Lord this unspoken request Lord we just committed into your hands father Lord Jesus sister Tina father who needs a touch from you and we know the doctor said that unless she accepts their solution uh that she will die father she's holding on to faith that you have given her Lord that you will touch her so Lord as a body of Believers here in Calgary and from afar Lord we just want to stand together for our sister Lord Jesus that you would just manifest in the situation Lord that you would touch her that you would raise her up that you would have your will in this situation Lord that your will would be done father Lord we have many ideas and and thoughts but we know our thoughts are not your thoughts and your ways are higher than ours father so we just want to commit our sister into your hands father fully and completely and we'll be careful to give you the praise Lord we thank you for touching her Lord for encouraging her Lord for the encouragement that she gives Lord Jesus even in the midst of her trial father we love you and we thank you Lord now we just want to remember each and every request made known unto you this morning Father by an uplift hand father that you would touch those those needs Lord that you would meet those needs father that sovereignly you would Lord just have your will in your way in our lives father for our needs Lord for our circumstances and situations Lord Jesus and we will be careful to give you the praise father now that we have set the mechanics in order father we just invite you the Dynamics Lord to just touch this service in a special way father that you would just take it and make it exactly what you want father that we could just get out of the way the speaker and the hearer that we could be one waiting to hear at your feet Lord Jesus what you would say to us father we love you and we thank you we just commit all these things into your hands in the name above every name the name that makes demons tremble the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we commit this service into your hands Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen all Hallelujah thank you musicians God bless you this morning welcome to all of our visitors we uh just want to turn to the book of Isaiah this morning Isaiah chapter 7 there's still a bit more so much more but uh just a bit more today I guess we'll push a little further Isaiah chapter 7 verse 10. talking about a sign I've been preaching from a super sign for a couple weeks now and uh we'll probably push a little further with that but see what the Lord has in store let's start with verse 10 in Isaiah chapter 7 moreover the Lord spake unto ahaz saying ask the assign of the Lord thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height above but ahaz said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord and he said hear ye now o House of David is it a small thing for you to worry men but will ye weary My God also therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and call his name Emmanuel let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord as we turn back the pages of this book we know that Lord we as humans can read it we can read the black and white print father but we know Lord Jesus it takes your spirit to reveal it to us and father we just ask and we invite you father to reveal this word to break this bread of life to us fresh once again Lord help us Lord to see what you have between the lines Lord we just ask that you would be glorified in all that's said and done now help me to get out of the way and just give you the preeminence father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated certainly are thankful to gather together one more time this way we want to just remind everyone about the services in Edmonton next weekend it's the 30th Anniversary meetings of this weekend there will be brothers Nathan and Ray Erickson from Lima Ohio as well as brother Ron Spencer from uh I believe he's in Kentucky so it'll be a wonderful time of Fellowship and uh just worshiping the Lord wow we have brother Gilbert taking the service in uh in our stead we'll be up there as well so um yeah we had a wonderful Youth Event this weekend I understand we have uh a lot of visitors that attended the Youth Event and there's a bit of Fellowship I guess Friday night and uh they had a hike yesterday and I understand uh that this is the fifth year in a row that they've actually had a hike and I've been saying to brother Joel that we should make this something maybe official every year we can have a Calgary Living Word hike and we'll just see what the Lord will do in the future if he should tarry It's a Wonderful opportunity we have the amenity of the mountains so close to us and many times we can just take it for granted I know I do I take it for granted they're there and they've been there my whole entire life and I probably haven't climbed as many mountains as I should but uh you know we have the opportunity so it's wonderful that we have folks willing to take the opportunity to have the initiative to put things together to facilitate a time of Fellowship like that in God's Beauty so God bless you brother Joel and Sister Crystal for putting your shoulders to the wheel [Applause] and everyone that participates because it wouldn't be the same without you so God bless you all for taking taking the initiative to come and fellowship with us we trust the Lord bless you uh so many visitors I'm not going to begin trying to say your names because I'm probably going to get something wrong we'll greet you afterwards and we have a fellowship afterwards for those who don't know we have a potluck this afternoon and we're certainly uh inviting you you're welcome to come and attend and have some fellowship with us as long or as short as you would like and uh just make yourselves at home if you need instructions for the address we can certainly get that to you um after service you happy this morning I just haven't been able to get away from this sign a super sign brother Branham talked about and uh probably not going to read very much from Super sign today there's a little bit of a different direction I think that I want to go um because I I just think that I want to maybe see if we can bring it a little bit down home a little bit to right where we live and see if the Lord won't do something with that and you know one of the things that has the the greatest impact on the word of the Lord in our lives we can have all of the mechanics figured out we can have church and we can have home and we can have dress and we can have finances we can have everything in order in our lives but if we don't have the right attitude brothers and sisters the spirit of the Lord ain't going to be with us and we were talking about it in the foyer we've talked about it before but you know there's people that call Jesus Jesus and they'll call him Lord but they won't allow him to be the true Lord of their lives they won't be willing to surrender all of the leadership to him to have that wedding ceremony we know that there's a reason why the bride wears a veil so she can take that Veil off and give it to her husband and that Veil goes upon her husband's shoulder and what that means it signifies that he has now all of the authority and she's willing to submit to him and now many sisters would say my goodness you're going to get me to call my husband Lord yeah I am according to the word of God if he is your husband truly according to the word of God then he is your lord and that's how you want to serve God Is by serving your husband because that's what the prophet for our day said but that's not common practice in the world today for a woman to say I want to serve my husband like he's my Lord who am I that's not what the world says the world says Be Strong be a strong woman and have a strong opinion and have a strong mind and a strong will and do everything your way and maybe talk to your husband a little bit no I'm not saying sisters do that but that's the way of the world isn't it I believe brother Bradham even says you know the laodicean age is about women's rights and you know we as the church the feminine how do we behave according to the Lord how do we serve the Lord our attitude towards the word of God shows it all we don't have to say a word our attitude displays it all out of proving his word in 1965 he says here is a woman Touched By His Garment she was healed with a blood issue he's talking about the story in in the gospels of the woman who just touched the Hem of His Garment that's what he's talking about he saw said a soldier spit in his face and put a crown of thorns on his head he felt no virtue there he says it's your approach are you bringing it up sorry it's paragraph 27 of 1965 proving his word I'll go slow and I'll give you the the title first so you can bring it up paragraph 27. it's your approach he says how do we approach the word how did we approach the Lord this morning when we came to church he says the attitude is what it takes and that's what it is tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we are and believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ how many here this morning believe that you're in the presence of Jesus Christ we are and believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here and so is the Dynamics if you can just get started I love this if you can just get started it's not up yet if you can just get started he says God will do the rest and you know where I've been going with this in my mind is to think that how many times have I tried to do the rest how many times do we try and do the rest brothers and sisters the only way it's going to happen is for God to do the rest we get the mechanics together with the Dynamics and just allow God to do it something good is going to happen but it's your approach it's your attitude it's our attitude if we come to church with a bad attitude that song leader oh that trustee that Deacon oh that that Pastor I never voted for him you know what just allow God to do the work just say maybe I never did the vote for any one of those people in the body but God it's your church after all it ain't my church and if you are God be God and if you can't change my heart then show me where to go because the prophet of God said if you can't be fed somewhere then just go where you can be but you know what the difference is brothers and sisters is when that moment happens it's what's the attitude do we leave angry or do we say hey you know what God's leading me I got this leadership from the Lord and and I just can't be fed here and I just think I'd be better to go elsewhere and you know can you pray with me a little bit can we just have this what's the attitude what's our approach makes all the difference because we can fool everyone else we can even fool ourselves but we can't fool God 28 says now this subject that I want to speak on for a few moments is proving his word now I know I've been talking about a sign but I really want to maybe underline this proving his word it takes God brothers and sisters to prove his word only God can prove his word we can try all we want to and say I'm a Christian I believe the message I was raised in the message I know all the quotes I've got all of the things worked out in my life everything is perfect we know that there was once one man that came to Jesus that way right he was young and he had the World by the tail or so he thought and Jesus loved them he was rich he was young and he was a ruler and Jesus looked at him after he ran after Jesus and he said why do you call me good because there's something wrong with you just get rid of everything you've got forget about it forget about the money give it all to the poor and take up your cross and come and follow me and we know the guy left sorrowful because he couldn't let go could he the world's possessions the treasures of this world he was too busy trying to prove God himself to say that God's blessed me he was too busy trying to prove God himself and God saw it God discerned him when he met that word that day and what happened we know he lifted up his eyes in hell and he found the tables had turned completely around but God proves his word brothers and sisters it's not up to us paragraph 28 of this message says now this subject I want to speak on for a few moments proving his word now that's a great thing I think of that proving his word now God is just as able to prove his word tonight as he ever did prove it as the Bible also said prove all things hold fast to that which is good prove all things brothers and sisters just allow the Lord to do it ask him to prove prove it Lord are you Lord Of My Life prove it and I promise if we if we go sincere that way to the Lord he'll prove it how many here doesn't want to see the Dynamics of the Lord I believe everybody here wants to see the Dynamics of the Lord in our lives I I didn't mean to say that in a trick way I would never do that I don't mean to do that what I want to do is try and encourage us to to maybe just cultivate our minds this morning to think you know what we want to see the Dynamics of the Lord we're not looking to see Mighty signs and wonders but they just follow us but you know what when we feel the presence of the Lord brothers and sisters we should be able to speak to that storm and see it move back and I'm not talking necessarily about clouds maybe there's a tornado going to take out our house but when we have problems in our car in the road if we're going to have a terrible accident we cry out Lord Jesus but if he's not Lord Jesus in the rest of our life how could he be Lord Jesus in that moment paragraph 64 er sorry is this the same message oh I apologize I've got this Pokey thing again whoo I might have to go to a handheld mic we'll see how this goes um same same message I'm not sure I think this is towards the end of it um I'm sorry I don't have the paragraph number he says now as you come with the mechanics he's talking to a woman in the prayer line it's at the end of the message now as you come with the mechanics May It Strike the Dynamics it'll go to work he says sins are confessed the sister answers you are ready he says to her sins confessed this morning to the bride the sister sins confessed we don't need a prayer line do we sins confessed this morning then you're ready not because of me because of he because he's here we've already set the time the mechanics so we just need to make sure that we allow that Dynamics to come and flow through US brothers and sisters we will not leave this building the same way we came in we're going to either leave this building better or we're going to leave this building worse than we came that's the way it is when we have a service with the Lord he says Dear God I pray that you will heal her make her well in Jesus Christ's name amen a simple prayer a simple statement and a simple sister goes on to receive her healing in the name of Jesus Christ but where I'm going with this is the attitude it's the approach how are we doing this since confessed are we coming sincerely are we coming and consecrating our lives to the Lord when we come to church are we consecrating our lives to the Lord in the morning when we get up in the morning are we consecrating our children are we consecrating our marriages are we consecrating our lives to the Lord Jesus Christ every day it's our attitude 1950 zero seven one six I'll probably just go through this quickly so you don't have to worry he says out of Believers thou this and I say this with a challenge in faith I hear this and I think my I like that I want a challenge in faith we have people that want to go and challenge to climb a mountain how about a challenge in faith this morning brothers and sisters and I say this with a challenge in faith that every promise of God will be brought to pass if you take the right mental attitude towards it he says that's right look at it believe it don't be afraid of it look at it and believe it and just take the right mental attitude towards it how do we get the right mental attitude I I asked the question myself how do we how do we get the right mental attitude I've said this quote many times but what is the right mental attitude it's just saying I believe God's word right be it unto me according to Thy word not my will but thy will be done let thy will come to pass in my life let the mechanics in my life just touch have those Dynamics just touch those mechanics and just see what happens because you know when the Dynamics in an engine in a two-stroke engine or a four-stroke engine or any kind of engine a jet engine it just takes One Touch One Touch to the mechanics and when that happens we know there's fire and we know that's what we're looking for this morning the pillar of fire and he's here brothers and sisters brother Branham says John sprole many of you has heard of John the glory Barn years ago in Lay Sao Lorraine France said him and his wife walking up one afternoon at a statue looking at a statue of Christ and he he stand out criticizing he said why I don't see no suffering don't see nothing that looked like anything that would be so great about that Monument here I wonder how many times do we encounter that in the service here maybe not here but in another church anywhere maybe you get a minister maybe it's a Wednesday night you just have an ordinary average lay Minister get up and on a Wednesday night a Wednesday service somebody that's just a brother that's got a leadership for the Lord and it's just that brother you know that brother what way are we looking at it you know where I'm going with this story I'm sure we're all familiar with it he said the guide said while you're looking at it wrong sir said you got to get down here at the altar said there's an altar built up here and said now look up he looked up and said oh my his heart like to broke brother Branham says see it's just the way you look at it if you look at the word if you look at the word was way back there and Christ lived years ago and he's not today and he's not the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13 8 brother branham's Keystone scripture of the message of the hour he's not the same yesterday today and forever that's just the way you'll get out of it he's the great I was and the great I will be but who is he to you today who do you say that I the son of man am he's not the same yesterday today and forever and that's just what you'll get out of it but it's not to be looked looked off as history it's to be get down and look up to it and believe it the way you look at the word of God having the right attitude towards the word of God the way that we look at the word of God we've got to come to him and consecrate ourselves to him we cannot live in this world without getting filthy brothers and sisters I I know there's some people here that are probably just just about Saints but I know I'm not I I know I I don't know I I get filthy walking in this world that's not to say that I go out to the bar rooms that live in sin but you know the thoughts come to our minds and instead of taking it into captivity and and taking the double barrel shotgun of the all the New Testaments of the word and Blasting it out sometimes in my mind I'll just entertain the thought and instead of taking into the Captivity of the word I'm guilty because of the hybrid condition that I'm in but that doesn't mean I'm lost it just means I have this battle going on and you know I'll just be honest with you I've had the devil coming at me hard coming at me fierce coming after me and and even to the point in my dreams and I just have been marveling this last week saying Lord what is it and I know what it is he showed me and then he started to show me dreams of real powerful services and real victories in church and it just it's so beautiful when we can actually go through and take inventory in our lives brothers and sisters and that's what I want to try and do is and just encourage us to have the right mental attitude how we approach the word of God and you know what we how all every one of us there's a reason why we're here this morning it's because he's given us a sign isn't it he's given every one of us an individual sign and if he hasn't this morning I just want to encourage you to ask him because he will give you a side that he is the same yesterday today and forever that he's the present tense I have that he's not a God that I was or I will be he is the I am he wants to be known that way he doesn't want to be off in the future and he doesn't want to be off in the past brother Bradham said it back in the 60s and the whole message of the hour that people are so busy looking backwards and looking forwards and ignoring what he's trying to do right now and and I think it's beautiful because I said it trying to do right now but he's doing right now and people will either get on board or they'll just watch the bus go by but he's going to do what he's going to do and nobody's going to stop him from doing it his will will be accomplished all the way along you know the right mental attitude will bring his word to pass but how do we have the right mental attitude the only way we're going to get it is by his Holy Spirit by the Holy Ghost himself Jesus Christ and what is the the the the I am today it's the message of the hour it's it's the revealed word it's the opening of the word it's Revelations 10 1-7 that Mighty angel that descended wasn't brother Branham that wasn't a a prophet of God that descended brothers and sisters that was God himself being a present tense showing the world that you know what this this is not just a cloud that's on on on on a picture somewhere in someone's wall it's not just a cloud that people try and superimpose the face of Jesus Christ the prophet of God said you can see his eyes his ears his nose you can see his face there and what did he tell the prophet he said take that picture that man has taken and present it a certain way man's idea is this way but turn it right turn it the right way turn it the right way and look at it and what is it doing it's the face of Jesus Christ face to face with the world we know that when we were a child we acted as a child right and that scripture wasn't just speaking about us growing up as a child although we can take it and and make it that way it's about the word and the maturing of the word Through the Ages and recognizing that there was a time where where Christians were children and they drank milk and he is al-shaddai for a purpose so that the children could be fed but there comes a time where there's Eagles that eat strong meat and the only thing they can deal with is strong meat they can have milk and it's nice to have with cookies before you go to bed but where's the beef where's the meat where's the strong meat we've got to be able to have that strong meat in our lives and that strong meat is the opening of the word where the Eagles gather together that's where the carcass is and we're feeding on the unfailing body word of Jesus Christ it's got to be the word that's the only way we're going to get the right mental attitude is to actually have his word to take that book and eat it just like John was instructed to the the verse 8 2 11 or 8-13 uh the the final part of Revelations 10 there's one to seven and that was the prophets part that was the mighty angel coming down but then there's the other part take that book John who is John being a type of the Bride go and take that book and eat it up and it's going to be sweet as honey in your mouth everybody here like honey it's very sweet it's the sweetest thing there is really on Earth naturally made it's gonna make your belly bitter this flesh can't stand it how can I ever live that message you'll never be able to live that message never that's why you need the Holy Ghost because when you want to go one way the Holy Ghost is going to say if you go down that trail it's going to look just fine you're going to be just fine it's going to look just like the right way but the next step is going to take you off a thousand foot cliff and you're not going to turn out well when you hit the bottom the Holy Ghost In Our Lives will be our guide brother Branham preaches that message of God we need to have a guide everybody needs to have a guide we've got to be willing to have leadership if we can't have leadership we can't have the Holy Ghost it's pretty much that simple people will say oh I've got the Holy Ghost yeah well you got a pastor let's start with the basics brother Bradham said how are we ever going to teach the algebra if we can't have the ABCs if you can't surrender to the headship of leadership in terms of the fivefold ministry as set out in the bible let alone what the prophet said how you ever going to have the Holy Ghost in your life you gotta follow the word of God having the right mental attitude towards the promises of God is going to bring it to pass the right mental attitude is going to cause the right physical actions it'll cause a manifestation of it the word of God is given given to live by it's not given to interpret we're not supposed to interpret the word of God God interprets his own word by bringing it to pass right that's what the prophet taught us that's what God taught us through the prophet so it's not up to us to try and interpret it and say well you know what brother Bradham said this but I can do that and and my family's done the other and look at us we're great it's fine it is fine but will it be fine when you get over there the word of God is given to us to believe that's why God sent prophets in the bible isn't it he didn't send them so that they could have their own Ministries what did the prophets in the bible do prophets in the bible they said one thing basically get back to the word somehow man we know it's the Antichrist Spirit gets in around Church it's amazing when you think about it hey how in the Garden of Eden how how simple it is as a Believer when we look at it but how how simple it is how how treacherous it is how Satan got in in the Garden of Eden and how he took advantage of everything and what did man immediately do man wanted to get coverings we're talking about this on Friday night we're driving around with the two youngest boys having an ice cream we're just talking about this this this how man just wanted to have a covering there had to be some kind of a covering there had to be and and what was it it wasn't a fig Leaf the Bible says a fig leaf and Christianity in the world will say it was a fig leaf and other people might say maybe it was a small animal they just made coverings they created clothes maybe they had a designer collection but we know it wasn't any of that according to the prophet for our day it was a religious Behavior it was a religion they hid themselves because they recognized outside of the veil of God's word they were naked they were wretched they were blind and they felt like they had need of nothing right the laodicean church but that's why God sent prophets in the bible was to say get back to the word just get back to God's word get back to the word for your day and if you do that it'll be okay this morning I want to just take a little bit of a look at Judges chapter 13 if you don't mind turning there seeing how this will relate how you know the Lord will give you a sign and he gave he gave a sign that a virgin shall conceive and we know that that happened we know that that happened over in Luke there's the story of Jesus birth and how he came into the world I just want to take a little bit of a look at someone who was given a sign in the form of Samson this morning Samson was given a sign in Judges chapter 13 verse 1 says in the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines 40 years there was a certain man of Zora of the family of the danites whose name was Manoa and his wife was Baron and bear not and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and bear us not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son she was given a sign verse 4 says now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo shall conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines I just think this is a beautiful scripture a little bit of a maybe a type on how the angel came and and gave her a sign and you know a little bit further down it says that she didn't even catch the angel's name but the angel actually told her this stuff when she went and told her husband she's pretty excited about it and went and told her husband you know what I was Baron I am bare and you know that I'm Barren and and I haven't been able to have a child but suddenly I've got this vision of an Angel and now now he's telling me that I'm going to have a child and and and to take the Nazarite vow myself and to not eat anything or drink anything to just completely consecrate myself to the Lord as a Nazarite and and that was according to Old Testament uh scripture back in uh I believe it's in Leviticus and maybe we'll get there if we have time this morning but here we have this woman saying the angel instructed me to behave that way to consecrate myself because the one that's coming in my womb is going to be a Nazarite consecrated from my womb and you know brothers and sisters I want to say it today we all know it but sometimes I think we just need a little bit of remembrance or our Pure Minds stirred up by way of remembrance that we just need a little bit of encouragement to remember that if you have the ability to hear this message of the hour then you were consecrated by God before the foundation of the world from the womb to have this consecration yourself you are a Nazarite unto the Lord yourself there's a lot of different angles and directions we could go with this but today I just want to make it about the bride and Christ and how she is a Nazarite consecrated unto him and you know what we've been given a sign in our day we have the sign but here in her day they were given a sign and given the ability to recognize that they're going to have a baby now verse 6 says then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of God came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God very terrible but I asked him not whence he was neither told me his name but he said unto me behold Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death isn't that awesome to think about nothing could change that from his life and you know what's the same thing for us today brothers and sisters if you're a Nazarite today if you were yesterday you will be tomorrow and this business of thinking you're you're lost maybe somewhere along the way and then you get saved and and you get saved and you just have these thoughts that come into your mind and maybe you stumble and fall and revert back to some old ways and the Devil comes around and tries to remind you that that's happened in your life and and and maybe you've fallen down you will not be able to change that consecration that you've made in your life if you have ever been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and you have received the gift of the Holy Ghost in your life you can never lose it you're sealed to the day of your Redemption it's impossible for you to lose that token in your life impossible here we have Samson in the Old Testament and I'm just I just want to maybe back up a little bit just to maybe set the the stage for where this is and and maybe the light of the scripture we took an extensive study for a while on the book of of Joshua and how the Lord had taken the children of Israel from their captivity and and and with Moses out into the Wilderness and then from the Wilderness to get up and get ready because the the Ark of the Covenant the word of God is going to take you over into the promised land now after 40 years all the old murmurers the The Grouchy ones the critical spirit people they were all gone and now the young group had grown up under this message of the hour in their day and they were going to follow the word with all their heart they weren't interested in all the murmuring and nonsense that was going on in their day and so they followed over and they went over into the promised land and they went and had many many conquests they went and consecrated themselves they the Lord said to them once you get on the other side you've got to follow that seal of circumcision and you've got to make sure that you get everything right consecrate yourselves today in the sight of the Lord and show him give him something to honor and we know that they did and brothers and sisters today I just want to say give them something to honor if you have any doubts if you have any questions or wonders in your life just give them something to honor sometimes we can go stale in our lives spiritually speaking give them something to honor put an investment in that bank account I had heard it said a while ago and I thought it was so good maybe one day we'll get into it but you know sometimes in our lives brothers and sisters we can actually become spiritually bankrupt if we're not putting love in the tank we want to withdraw how many times do we want to withdraw out of that that spiritual tank but if we're not putting anything into it what do we have to give out I say Lord help me but you know the world Satan I would say he's crafty he came up with this thing and it's a relatively new in in terms of history and and that's a plastic thing called a credit card isn't it and he's been able to place it in the hands of everyone and and even children young people old people middle people every people can have a credit card everyone can have a credit card people with good credit bad credit everyone can have a credit card and you can start to spend money that's not even yours you don't even have that money and and you know sometimes I wonder if spiritually speaking we can start trying to do that as well we start to run a deficit and imagine how that must feel for God but boy if we can look at that and say Lord help me let me let me find some work let me find some way to pay that debt so that I can make sure that my account standing with you is 100 correct that I've got an A plus rating with you and you know what it's not something that we're going to do it's going to be a complete submission where we change our perspective and say I could never do it but Lord when you come around oh my you'll just take my debt and you'll throw it into the sea of your forgetfulness and what does that is total submission complete surrender saying you know I I actually repent and repentance Godly repentance work with sorrow doesn't it when someone really does repent they want to change their ways they don't want to just keep doing the same thing they change their ways when we repent we change our ways we're creatures of habit though when the devil knows it very well let's just turn over to Leviticus chapter 11. I just want to I just want to try and fit this in here I guess before we run out of time we still got lots of time praise the Lord levitic uh sorry numbers I said Leviticus I meant numbers sometimes we could just get so much on the go Numbers Chapter 6. this was an instruction that people were given in the Old Testament it's the vow of the Nazarite verse 1 says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when either a man or a woman shall separate themselves to a vow a vow of a Nazarite to separate themselves unto the Lord he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine no vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree from the colonels even to the husk all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow all the days that he separateth himself unto the Lord he shall come at no dead body he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consecration of God is upon his head now there's a lot more to it I'm not going to go into it for the sake of time but if you would like to later on go ahead and read the rest of Numbers Chapter 6 it really talks about the vow of the Nazarite and and how important it is to recognize it's a pretty serious thing I was thinking about it this morning when I was studying it what it would be like to take that vow because I like to eat grapes and I don't mind raisins either but you know what that vow is to actually not eat either one of those and some people would say well you know that was the Old Testament law but how much of the Old Testament is actually unapplicable today we're living under grace and I understand that but just for the sake of discussion and illustration this morning I mean it's a pretty tremendous thing what I want to get to is to think about it not even eat a grape there's nothing wrong with a grape is there grapes are delicious grapes are refreshing in their and they're chewy sometimes we would freeze them and give them to the kids so they could chew on them when they were teething and and the grape juice is wonderful isn't it it's nice and raisins are pretty good too they're dried grapes but what this point is in here I believe with all my heart is that you're not even going to go anywhere near it you're going to make this vow you're going to vow this vow you're going to do everything that this word says to do and that's to actually steer completely clear from it nobody is ever going to be able to say well were you drinking grape juice or were you drinking vinegar or were you drinking wine what were you doing you're actually completely steering completely away from it and you know as Believers today in in our lives we had talked about it before is it is it wrong to drink a glass of wine oh my I'm getting into some some choppy Waters here I know it but I'm going there and I think it's important to brothers and sisters because it's quite simple the instruction that I was given the leadership that I was given you know it's okay it says it in the Bible I'll say it from the pulpit it says it Timothy uh Paul said it to Timothy or it's okay to drink a little wine for the stomach's sake isn't it once in a while I'm not encouraging us to drink wine but what I do want to say is what will the people around you say that see you drinking it the word of God says to shun all appearance of evil if we have a Nazarite vow are we willing to go that far to shun all appearance of evil nothing wrong with having a bottle of wine around the house to maybe cook with I'm not going to judge that one way or the other you want to cook with it cook with it but are you drinking it if you're cooking and having a sip I think you know what maybe it's I don't know you're a revelation but are we willing to go so far to say that I'm not going to let anybody make a mark against me nobody is ever going to say that I was drinking wine and you know what it might not be anybody in the congregation might not be the neighbors nobody else around you will see it but I promise you your children are watching the children will say you know what I know Grandma she used to have a bottle of brandy a little Mickey a brandy in the cupboard in her house and she probably didn't even know that I knew about it or maybe she did and it was just maybe a joke it was for medicine when you got sick you had it with a little bit of something else and you know maybe it made you a little better and sure enough that's fine but what what message does it send brothers and sisters we can have one you can have wine I'm not gonna say you shouldn't there's some people that would say yeah we can take Liberties and have wine but you know what when you start opening doors like that what else can you do how far do we go I'm not going any further but it's endless we could go on and on and on it's not about do's and don'ts as soon as it gets into do's and don'ts the Holy Spirit has left then we can say Ichabod over top of our house the spirit of the Lord has left us if we have to rely on do's and don'ts what we need to rely on is the baptism of the Holy Ghost to lead us and guide us into all truth because if we believe that he will he will if we give him the opportunity he will we need to make sure that we're setting the right the right example our children are watching and for our children to say well Mommy and Daddy they had wine they had they had maybe had alcohol once in a while it was it was it was something special maybe it was just a Christmas on Christmas Eve in the darkest you know latest hours they had a giggle and maybe a little glass of Sherry or wine or whatever it is careful careful because the children will take it and they'll go over to a friend's house and their friends will be doing it it might not be Christmas Eve maybe it'll be Monday morning and the parents will be drinking it and they'll say you want some and the kit if they see mommy and daddy doing it they'll say well maybe why not I know Mommy and Daddy did it and they're okay it's it's a slippery slope it's a very slippery slope I just want to go back to the Samson again and you know we've been given a sign in our day and and I just want to keep bringing that up because Samson he was given a sign but he was also a sign the children of Israel had gone over into the promised land they had gone and had many conquests and they had the the prophet Moses take them out in a cross and and they saw the Lord and and they saw like we said the the elders passed away in the wilderness and the Young Generation came up and went across and and they conquered and they had conquests and they followed the Lord the will of the Lord over and over again they won the Victory and the Lord won the victory for them but what happened was then Joshua passed away right at the beginning of the Book of Judges now after the death of Joshua the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and they did whatever felt good in their own sight because there was nobody there to judge them there was no prophet in the land they had the word the Old Testament word the book of Moses but they did whatever felt good in their own sight and you know what if we're not careful we can start to do that and we don't want to do that we want to bring ourselves into subjection with the word of God like we said at the beginning you know what we all have the Holy Ghost but sometimes we get a little bit low sometimes we can actually withdraw a little bit more than we've actually allowed to go in the tank and that's why we gather on Sundays and Wednesdays that's why we have church that's why we feed on the word of God so we can lift up our cup and say Lord fill me up because we know that there was ten virgins five were wise five were unwise the only difference between them was the unwise didn't have enough oil they even had oil they just didn't have enough you know and judges 14 the next chapter over I just think it's amazing how someone can be a Nazarite from the womb which we all can be but you know we will become what we look at when we're when we're living Our Lives we got to make sure we've got our focus in the right direction on the right thing because if we don't have it on the right thing brothers and sisters we're going to have a wreck and you know Samson in the very beginning of his Conquest hey here we have Judges chapter 14. and maybe if you could turn there I'll just pause for a second if you're not there already but Judges chapter 14 the very first scripture it shows what happened to Samson as many times I've wondered at myself what happened to him he was a Nazarite from the womb Judges chapter 14 verse 1 says in Samson went down to Timnath and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines this was a a Nazarite from the womb he was supposed to take a bride from his own people he wasn't supposed to go and mess around with the Philistines but here he was down there and what did he see he saw a woman of the Philistines and you know if we're not careful Brothers we'll see a woman of the Philistines and as the Bride of Jesus Christ if we're not focused on the word of God we could potentially see a woman of the Philistines something shiny something attractive something that's going to take our attraction off of the word of God verse 2 says and he came up and told his father and his mother at least he was honest right and said I've seen a woman in timna of the daughters of the Philistines now therefore get her for me to wife his father and mother tried to straighten them out his father and his mother said unto him is there never a woman among the daughters of thy Brethren are among all thy people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines and Samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleases me well can you imagine verse 4 here but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord and that he sought occasion against the Philistines for at that time the Philistines had dominion over them I'm not going to read on I would say for the sake of time uh you can read on maybe you could jump down to verse six and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and he rent as he would have rent a kid this was the story of the Lion's story and and he had nothing in his hand but he told his father neither sorry I'm jumping ahead of myself I'm probably sounding really mixed up it's because I am let's go back to verse 5. then when Samson down and his father and his mother to Timnath and came to The Vineyards of Timnath and behold a young lion roared against him and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and he rent him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but he told not his father or his mother what he had done and he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased Samson well and after a Time he returned to take her and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the Lion and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told them not he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the Lion now why didn't he tell his parents that because they're not supposed to touch anything unclean they're not supposed to touch the carcass of a dead animal especially something with pause now I wanted to talk about Leviticus chapter 11 I'll just read it for time's sake verse 27 of Leviticus 11 it says and whatsoever goeth upon his paws among all manner of beasts that go on all four those are unclean to you unto you who so toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even and he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even they are unclean unto you directly out of the word of God and here we have him slay a lion and and now the bees swarm inside of him it makes me wonder how that happened because first he'd have to be emptied out inside maybe a little too graphic but suddenly there's a swarm of bees in this lion and how did that happen he was busy chasing that woman in the Philistines but we know that it was the Lord's choice as the Nazarite and and I even wonder where is this going brother Barry I was studying this and thinking my I just sometimes you have to wonder but I can see how it's coming together it's just wonderful to think how the Lord does things how he moves the power of the devil in 1955 brother Branham a message that he preached the power of the devil he says how happy I am you know if you when you're really badly tempted on something if you'll just make Jesus your Refuge and shut your eyes and pass right by it it'll be the sweetest experience that you've ever went through I'll tell you brothers and sisters by experience my silly little story of the rattlesnake I I've thought about it many times my whole family walked past that thing and we couldn't see it it wasn't visible but I can close my eyes and walk past it in my mind and it's pretty sweet to think the angel of the Lord didn't let that thing strike any of my children or my wife you know that's just a natural but how many times in our lives spiritually speaking how many times in our lives do we have temptations does the devil come around and try and get us you know he knows exactly what our behaviors are but if we can just make Jesus our refuge and shut our eyes to whatever the Temptation is close your eyes to it change your perception allow him to actually be our refuge and and just pass right by it he says it'll be the sweetest experience that you've ever went through he says Samson one time when a lion run out to kill him he killed that lion and when the Holy Ghost came upon him I love the way he says that because he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever when the Holy Ghost came upon him while he killed slew the lion as he would a little kid or animal so when one day passing by a lion's carcass laying there the old frame and some bees had built Honeycombs in there and he ate it and he said it was the sweetest honey he'd ever eat the very thing that was going to kill him and when he passed by and seen the old carcass he enjoyed the honey off him so is it now amen but I can see that old life that I once loved how many people can look back and see that old life that they once loved and now it's dead as all midnight I tell you I can raise my hands and praise the Lord and eat the sweetest honey I've ever eaten my life it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory you know if you've ever had to slay a line in your life you've ever had to do it you know it you can look back to it and it is the sweetest thing it is the sweetest thing in your life it makes it so easy to worship I keep talking about worship but when it happens to you when he speaks to you directly there's nobody that's ever going to stop you from worshiping because you nobody ever talked you into it right acts of the Holy Spirit 1954 brother Adam says in paragraph 40 and we're saved not by works what we do it ain't what I've done that saved me it's what Christ done that saved me see not what I have no Holiness if I tried to say well I quit drinking I quit smoking I quit stealing lying so forth that's what I done see that would be my own I'd have something to brag about but I didn't didn't quit nothing he just come and took it out of me and you know what I can testify to every one of those he just came and took it out of me just just about this time of year probably close to 20 years ago he just came and just took it right out of me I didn't quit nothing he just took it right out of me and see that's that's it then it ain't what I'd done it's what he done he'll give you a sign brothers and sisters you'll show himself to you paragraph 43 and then the Holy Spirit then abides in and grows daily just grows making itself greater and greater pushes out the things the cares the temptation remember we've said it many times if we try to do stuff if we try to get rid of it if we try to rebuke that rattlesnake on the pathway he's just gonna sit there and look at you he's not going to hear your words he doesn't care he just wants to strike you the moment he gets a chance he will I rebuke you I rebuke you just turn around and walk away from it makes itself greater and greater pushes out the things the cares the temptation as you overcome them the Holy Spirit takes its place how can we ever expect to overcome without getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters if anybody's ever afraid of it don't be afraid of it be afraid of not getting it as you overcome them the Holy Spirit takes his place do you know what if you've got a real bad temptation of something that's not right overcome that thing a few times and watch if your testimony doesn't Bloom on account of it says look at Samson when he found that that lion run out to kill him when he slew the lion when the power of God come upon Him slew him with his bare hand just probably pulled his Jaws apart little bitty curly-headed shrimp about that high little bitty old fellow scrawny scrawny look on the street seven little locks hanging around his head like a little and he was no more than a little until the spirit of God come upon him [Applause] now it wouldn't be hard to believe that a great big giant could slay a line with his hands I believe he could do it but what's the funny thing was the little bitty fellow done it and I want to tell you even the little bitty fellows sitting in the front rows here the little bitty fellows may be spiritually feeling here you know what he's not going to use a spiritual giant he doesn't ever use spiritual Giants he uses David's David's those ones that are quick to repent but sometimes in their lives they've got some some things that he's got to work out of them and they seem like great trials David was a murderer David had adultery in him and God had to get those things out but it's still his name David he still was the one who had have the throne for eternity the throne that God chose for himself the spirit of the Lord come upon him and he slew the line threw it over to one side bees built their hive in there and Samson the sweetest honey he could ever come out of that carcass of that that killed lion is that right why he overcome it with the power of God and I want to say this brothers and sisters it just just throw it in there and I'm just going to continue to do it you know many times we can look at this and say in our lives we can look at our lives and say I follow the word of God I'm doing everything that I can I'm trying hard to make this right I want it to be right and it can look completely wrong how did it look for Samson in his day all those people who were critics all those people who knew Joshua all those people who had heard about Moses maybe even knew Moses all those people who who were there and and really religious people in the day to see him go down and say to his parents beg them for a Philistine wife are you kidding but we know the word of God says that that was the direction of the Lord that wasn't just his Direction he was created as the Nazarite in the womb of his mother to go and do that because God wanted to thump the Philistines God was getting fed up with the Philistines having having the the upper hand on the children of Israel so he raised someone up to deal with those animals and if you've got something you want to eat you want to eat some sweet honey from just overcome it with the power of God that's right watch how good it is oh my pass buy it maybe you've been a drunkard and yet every time you smell whiskey or beer or something you want to drink it overcome it by the power of God pass by one time and see what a feeling you got in your heart when all the thing is dead and gone all finished oh my sweet honey you get out of it true brothers and sisters and we all know it we've all overcome but how do we overcome by the blood of the lamb and by our testimony and you know I I was in discussion with a a Elder Minister and he said it you know what sometimes you'll be in a group of people and and something will come up something will pop up and as a Believer we recognize those things to be Spirits when they pop up and suddenly we'll start to have maybe a little feeling or a thought or something will start coming around us and we'll be like where did that come from how come am I feeling this what is it it's an attack of the devil it's a spirit that's trying to get on you trying to get into your mind trying to get you to take that thought and not take it into captivity of the word but you have the ability to eliminate it because you already have the blood of the Lamb you've already applied that blood to Your Heart Right There to my heart was the blood applied give glory to his name say hey you know what I overcame drinking one time even though you want to try and get on me and tell me that I want to have a beer I want to go and hang out with the boys no I don't I want to go to church I want to call my brothers and sisters and fellowship around the things of the Lord I want to go to prayer meeting on Thursday night I want to have an extra church service because I know it's changing me from glory to glory just living in this world is going to give me Temptation upon Temptation upon temptation but when I get together Lord with my brothers and sisters I know there's power overcoming power but when that Spirit starts to rise up and try and your Serpent's authority to you brothers and sisters you can say no God delivered me from that I used to be a drunk but by the blood of the lamb and by my testimony of what he's done for me I no longer desire to drink alcohol because he delivered me from it and I know how hard it is to contend with that when that Spirit gets on you brothers and sisters that's why millions and probably even billions of people live according to a 12-step program for the rest of their lives every day they'll get up and look in the mirror and say I'm so and so and I'm an alcoholic we have the ability to get up and say I'm so and so I'm a son of the king I belong in Heavenly places in fact I'm already seated there I don't have to tolerate that junk but you know what sometimes it's going to look pretty nasty on the outside so if we see a brother or sister going through a bit of a rough patch in their life take a look at Samson here and recognize that sometimes the Lord he ordains things to happen a certain way maybe Satan is going to get a thumping by that child that's living a little bit Wayward maybe there's some drinking Devils maybe there's some partying Devils maybe there's some whatever kinds of devils God wants to thump them and he's going to use your child maybe your husband maybe your wife to do it through we don't know just keep praying just keep playing a token you have the ability to do that we know we read this just recently First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 wherefore led him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest Heath both don't let Pride think don't let us think that we're standing on our own brothers and sisters because it ain't us standing we got nothing on our own verse 13 says there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man all men go through it all women go through it human beings will go through it in this hybrid condition but isn't it wonderful brothers and sisters there's come in a thousand year reign where we will stand before the devil and he will be powerless before us he's going to have all the power he has today but he's going to be bound with chains of circumstance and no circumstances is going to be your testimony the life that you live and the body that you've been given the scripture says but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able isn't he a wonderful God God who is rich in Mercy but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it he's not going to take us around it he's not going to take us under it or or or over it he's going to take us right through the middle of it brothers and sisters and you know what we're going to slay Devils all the way through it they're gonna fall all over the place you know I just like to take a look at this stuff the way the Lord leads me and and I just have to sometimes express the things that I've been going through and one of them is the the the the vehicles having a vehicle with a with an electrical problem anybody ever have a vehicle with an electrical problem they're so painful they're so taxing because they're so elusive right sometimes it's really obvious and you can just do one little thing maybe change the battery and it's fixed sometimes you got to change the battery and then the alternator and then it's fixed but when you do both of those things and it's still the same thing you just want to pull your hair out and say ah if you take it to a mechanic they'll say whoo electrical problem some mechanics will say ah nah I'm not even interested it's just a hassle I'll do some work on it in the end of this be an endless warranty case some mechanics aren't even interested but you know what they're common electrical problems are common and I just I just want to try and relate this a little bit to us just hopefully it does something for us you know they they will just continue to drain the Dynamics in the vehicle and every time you want to go you can't go it's frustrating and it's so difficult to deal with vehicles nowadays with so many wires in them and you know I just I've just been going through something with the vehicle that we've got and and it's just it's super frustrating and uh you know it's it's it's just the way it is in this life I guess we have these things that we've got to deal with and uh so we've got this side by side most people are familiar with it and it's it's just continually dying and I I just was thinking you know doing a little bit of troubleshooting how do I deal with this how do I fix this because I don't want to go to a mechanic and pay him the shop rates to do it not that they're not worth it but I don't think I just really have the money for it but I just don't want to do it you know and so anyways I I haven't really troubleshot it yet I've just tried to bandage it and boost it and try and get it to go and finally it just died yesterday and it just made me think you know what what is this problem and I started to research it a little bit type in the making the model in the internet and see what it is and you know what they call these types of drains they call them parasitic power drains parasitic power drains a life that lives off of something else right and it's just a teeny little bit of a drain but it's just a teeny little bit of enough of a drain to make it not useful and it makes it so frustrating I haven't really troubleshot it but I will and I'll get to the bottom of it but you know it just made me think about how this this types the natural to the spiritual a parasitic power drain how can that be dynamically speaking in the Church of the Living God we can have a parasitic power drain of the Dynamics in our life or in our spirit in in our service how many times does it happen and I just want to say it you know sometimes we need to troubleshoot it you know the the process some people might understand the process that they were saying to troubleshoot this stuff you can put a gauge on the battery and you can read the the reading of how what the electrical current is currently in the battery and and you can just go to the fuse block and you can pull out fuse by fuse and that number should stay the same whether it's good or bad on the battery it should stay there on the reading but as soon as you find which fuse stops that drain from happening you know what circuit it is but it takes research it takes a little bit of Investigation it takes a little bit of consultation you have to talk to someone who knows how to deal with this stuff if you have a problem in your life brothers and sisters that you can't seem to get over the word of God says to confess your faults one to another then actually pray for one another and you can be healed all right but if we're too afraid to talk if if we've been hurt before because we've talked and somebody else has gone and talked about what we've talked about it's pretty tough to let your guard down but you know what don't give up brothers and sisters There's real Believers there's people that you can have confidence in there's a five-fold Ministry but we need to take a look at every single circuit to make sure that we find that problem and when we find that problem we can isolate it is what it's called and when you could isolate it then you can actually deal with it sometimes you got to go in and you got to cut some wire you got to cut that bad section of wire right out of there and get rid of it and you got to splice in a new section of wire and you know what if we have something in our lives that we've identified it's a problem and we just don't know how to deal with it ask God to come and splice in a new piece of wire and he'll do it properly brothers and sisters so much so that we won't even remember that we had that problem when it's done but you know what as human beings we're predictable aren't we we're creatures of habit and you know why we are I would say this because we're living in the hybrid condition because animals are the same way even though they're unpredictable sometimes humans can be very unpredictable too but you know I remember a story brother told about uh maybe it was even here I don't know but it was a story about a raccoon in a national park and how the park Warden was explaining they were looking at this Trail in the in the in the national park and and this this this park Warden was there explaining that trail had been there for decades maybe even centuries and and on that trail there are specific footprints I think it was even in the Rocks close to the river and and worn into the Rocks Footprints and and what the the warden said was this is where a raccoon walks and they've done it families for generations and generations they walk along this pathway and the warden said that you can guarantee that a raccoon will put his foot right there you can see that footprint and you know that that raccoon will actually do that and I just remembered thinking about this I started as I Was preparing I started thinking about this little story and I just thought yeah you know it's applicable because as human beings if we're not careful the devil who is that parasitic drain in our lives he'll know that if outside of us living according to the word of God in our day he will see that we'll put our foot right there he'll know that that is our weakness and we will go and we'll put our foot right there in that spot and as soon as we do it then he'll grab us and you'll have us and we'll have that parasitic drain and we'll go through the same cycle over and over again but you know brothers and sisters we have the ability to sidestep the devil we don't have to walk in the same path that we walked all of our Lives we don't have to walk in the same path that our daddy walked in or that our Granddad walked in or that our great-grandfather walked in or our uncles or our aunts we can walk in the place where we have been told to walk we can walk with the Apostles of trod brothers and sisters we don't have to follow the genetic conditions that we live in humans are predictable according to the devil but sons and gods of Sons and Daughters of God they're not gonna they're not gonna follow what the devil has a perseverance in 1962-0719e paragraph 120 . well anybody knows an old bleached out Jawbone of a mule and then Philistines helmets was better than an inch thick with brass and a vesture of what they call mail which was lapped over metal down like that and with Spears and great Shields a thousand of them but the spirit of the Lord come upon that little shrimp wasn't a giant come upon that little shrimp he reached back there where to that Nazarite vow he reached back there to that place in his life and he was able to feel them locks he knew that that's where his strength lied he knew that was an indicator that he had that position of God and as soon as he recognized that what happened brother Branham goes on to say it he reached back there and felt them Seven Locks he knowed he was still a Nazarite Hallelujah he took what was in his hand and he beat them skulls right in with that old Jawbone and anybody knows you hit one of them skulls with a Jawbone it'd fly into a million pieces but God was there to hold it together and he beat down and killed a thousand Philistines he was persistent why he wasn't afraid he could feel that Nazarite vow with him Hallelujah I want to encourage us this morning brothers and sisters reach back there and feel that Nazarite vow look for that Nazarite vow in your life if you haven't looked for it recently take some time take a little bit of time and think about that Nazarite vow in your life if the devil is tempting yes or Rejoice because there's something that he wants from you and you know what he can never have it because you are a Nazarite unto the Lord from before the foundation of the world just reach back there wherever it is and feel those locks of hair and stand up to the devil stand in your position don't back up March forwards brother Branham says in paragraph 122 a man or a woman can feel the presence of Jesus Christ know that you are born again of the Holy Ghost let nothing stand in your way persistent when God speaks down and says it's you I give you Faith tonight your healing is sure it's my word then you can be persistent I just think that's so beautiful we don't have to tolerate the devil brothers and sisters but I know it my experience we get little parasitic little Dynamic drains in our lives Little Things but remember it's not the big things that really do us in is it it's the little foxes that spoil the vine the little foxes the little tiny things they're the ones that do it it's wonderful that we can actually really see the young boys up here in the front row the young believers the ones who are listening to this word being preached the ones who actually will grow up to be those samsons that will be able to reach back and feel those locks of hair one day because the devil's coming as a roaring lion to see who he can devour but you know Brothers when you've got the holy ghost in your life Ain't Nothing Gonna Move you you'll be able to withstand every single Temptation the devil brings at you how to perseverant perseverance 1964. brother Branham says we find this Samson was a Nazarite he had seven little curls that hung down his back and when the spirit of the Lord come upon him he feared nothing why he was persistent as long as he could feel that Nazarite vow with him as long as he could reach back here and feel those locks he knew that he was in the will of God and nothing could bind him a city couldn't bind him a lion couldn't kill him he took the Jawbone of a mule and it dried and beat down a thousand Philistines with it do you know those helmets those brass helmets was over an inch thick you know what would happen happen when an old desert dry bone would hit against him why it would burst into a million pieces he stood there single-handed with his Jawbone of a mule beating over their head and killed a thousand Philistines why he was persistent every time he hit he felt that Nazarite vow moved back upon him how much ought the church tonight that claims that you are born of the spirit of God I just think it's beautiful because he doesn't say that he just went and felt that that Nazarite vow I better call the musicians he he didn't just reach back there and feel that Nazarite vow and then go and hit one it was every time he hit one he felt that Nazarite vow and brothers and sisters this morning I want to say it for us every time you slay a devil how are you going to slay a devil not by rebuking it by rebuking it by simply saying I rebuke you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then just walk it away from it you destroy that devil because that devil has no more power over you you can't get your hands on the devil and tangibly tear them apart you can destroy him by having no influence over you you got no power over me Satan your minions don't work all of your tactics are finished we know exactly what your answer is and I am your answer that I am truly The Living Church of the Living God I am the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Branham says how much ought the church tonight that claims that you are born of the spirit of God standing in the meeting seeing the Vindication of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and claimed to be filled with the Holy Ghost and could sit still and let Satan push you around like he does it's a strange thing as long as you can feel the presence of the Holy Ghost know that it's his word and his promise for this day you should be persistent and press in until it's over perseverance stay with it God promised it it's not you it's God just remember that brothers and sisters it's not up to us to make it come to pass it's up to God to make it come to pass but you know the quote we read at the beginning is just close your eyes and just close your eyes to that devil to that snake to that problem to that situation just close your eyes and just walk by and just say Lord deliver me from this moment and you know what you'll actually get the sweetest honey that you've ever had in your life because you'll have the victory over that thing and all we need to do is exercise that exercise not stand and try and fight it if we try and fight it we're not going to do it it's got to be God just give it over to him maybe stand with me this morning as we close this bow gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I pray that this morning somehow some way the word spoken was able to just encourage someone father Lord I pray that we would be able to just reach back and feel that Nazarite vow and Lord not just every time we have a problem but father let us go forwards with confidence knowing that we have
