[38:41] everyone else to encourage everyone else
[38:44] around us many times we don't even maybe
[38:47] feel the blessing in our lives but our
[38:49] presence when we come together in the
[38:52] house of the Lord it actually brings
[38:54] encouragement to other people who are
[38:56] watching we know the prophet said
[38:58] there's always people watching so when
[39:00] we are not here we're missed so welcome
[39:03] everyone it's certainly a pleasure to
[39:05] see your smiling faces God richly bless
[39:08] you if you have your Bibles tonight I
[39:10] want to continue on in the exposition of
[39:11] the seven Church ages in the pergan
[39:14] church age in Revelations CH
[39:19] 2:12 Revelations 2 verse
[39:22] 12 boy after the weekend I got to say I
[39:25] just want to preach tonight
[39:29] but uh we're just going to try and keep
[39:32] it tame Revelations chapter 2 verse 12
[39:36] and to the angel of the church in
[39:38] pergamus write these things saith he
[39:42] which hath the sharp sword with two
[39:44] edges I Know Thy works and where s where
[39:47] thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is
[39:51] and thou holdest fast my name and Hast
[39:53] not denied my faith even in those days
[39:57] where in antipast was my faithful martyr
[40:00] who was slain among you where Satan
[40:02] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[40:05] thee because thou Hast there them that
[40:09] hold the doctrine of balum who taught
[40:12] balac to cast a stumbling block before
[40:15] the children of Israel to eat things
[40:18] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[40:22] fornication so hast thou also them that
[40:26] hold the doctrine of the nicians which
[40:30] thing I hate repent or else I will come
[40:34] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[40:36] them with the sword of my mouth he that
[40:40] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[40:43] saith unto the churches to him that
[40:46] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[40:48] Hidden mana and will give him a white
[40:51] stone and in the stone a new name
[40:54] written which no man knoweth saving he
[40:58] that receiveth it let's just bow one
[41:00] more
[41:01] time Heavenly Father we thank you for
[41:04] this word once again Lord we could read
[41:07] this scripture over and over and over
[41:10] and every single time it will have
[41:12] something new for us because this word
[41:14] is not just print this word is life this
[41:17] is the word that you have given to the
[41:20] churches and we thank you for it Lord we
[41:23] pray that Lord Jesus you would open our
[41:25] ears to this word tonight that you would
[41:27] Quicken it to our very Souls we just
[41:30] commit the rest of this service and all
[41:31] that said father into your name we ask
[41:35] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[41:38] bless you tonight you may be
[41:40] seated once again we uh just have a
[41:44] couple of announcements we have uh this
[41:48] weekend we're going away we're going to
[41:49] go to the Moose Lake Family Camp and uh
[41:52] brother
[41:53] Jose cmf who was uh originally going to
[41:56] take the service earlier in September
[41:58] but has agreed to take the service on
[41:59] the 25th so this Sunday brother sh way
[42:02] will be here we will be away and uh
[42:05] certainly looking forward to hearing
[42:08] brother toes oonoo he is going to take
[42:10] the service on the 8th of September and
[42:14] we're already heading into September
[42:16] summer is basically over I don't know
[42:19] how many people have gone back to school
[42:21] yet but uh it's happening we're going to
[42:24] go back to school very soon our our
[42:26] children start on the third of September
[42:28] and uh it's shocking that it's that
[42:31] close but I guess time just speeds up
[42:34] the further we go the faster it gets and
[42:37] uh I've heard it said from some of the
[42:39] oldtimers it doesn't slow down it just
[42:41] goes faster and faster spring summer
[42:44] fall winter and uh so anyways we're
[42:47] certainly excited to to be in fellowship
[42:49] with brother too denovo and uh we know
[42:52] that they had a wonderful time of
[42:54] traveling recently and brother to took a
[42:57] few Services I understand and we're
[43:00] certainly excited to hear what the Lord
[43:01] has put on his heart and uh for anyone
[43:04] that doesn't know it um I believe he and
[43:07] his bride Sister Janet I think are
[43:11] leaving on the 11th is that right on
[43:14] Wednesday the 11th so we certainly want
[43:17] to extend the right hand of Fellowship
[43:19] while we have some time left and uh just
[43:22] certainly trust the Lord will continue
[43:25] to allow them to feel welcome yes that's
[43:28] all uh we have a potluck I guess after
[43:30] service on the 8th so that will be a a
[43:33] wonderful time of Fellowship we we sure
[43:35] had a good time this weekend my goodness
[43:37] and uh you know what's interesting is I
[43:40] I thought my I really maybe made a
[43:42] mistake booking the the services on this
[43:45] weekend but at the same time I thought
[43:47] you know we booked it a year in advance
[43:48] so for the uh opportunity to be here was
[43:51] certainly there and we all have lives to
[43:54] live I understand that but I was I was
[43:56] feeling down that maybe the church would
[43:58] be empty and we'd have brother Andrew
[44:00] come all this way and what would we do
[44:03] but you know I don't know if we could
[44:04] have contained everyone if everyone who
[44:05] was away would have been here I don't
[44:08] know if we would have fit in this
[44:09] building it was pretty much full so it's
[44:11] just the way God does things and uh we
[44:13] sure had a wonderful time my and uh if
[44:17] you stream the services I'm I'm sure you
[44:19] you caught sort of what we were doing
[44:21] and and what was happening it was just
[44:23] an amazing time so you know I was
[44:25] talking to brother Andrew and we're
[44:26] looking to shift it uh a little further
[44:29] forwards so we'll see what the Lord has
[44:31] in store and if we can we're potentially
[44:33] going to move into September next year
[44:36] so that way everyone can be here and uh
[44:39] I mean there's always going to be
[44:40] someone away you can't prevent that but
[44:42] we certainly would like to try and make
[44:44] it as available as possible for everyone
[44:46] we know that we typically travel in the
[44:48] summertime and there's always stuff
[44:50] going on so whatever we can do to try
[44:53] and be a blessing to the body we
[44:54] certainly want to do that and I can tell
[44:57] tell you that brother Andrew certainly
[44:58] was blessed he was absolutely exhausted
[45:00] when he left and uh you know he he
[45:04] certainly gave his all and uh we
[45:06] certainly appreciate the the gift that
[45:08] that the Lord has placed in our
[45:10] brother's life and uh it's just
[45:12] wonderful to think back I was
[45:13] considering you know how did I ever come
[45:15] across brother Andrew I'd heard about
[45:17] him before but I went to that ministers
[45:19] enrichment weekend in North Carolina and
[45:21] I was just down in the in in the morning
[45:23] in the hotel having breakfast I was just
[45:25] getting a cup of coffee and just having
[45:27] breakfast and there was one brother
[45:29] there that was glued to me and he was
[45:31] preaching tape Ministry and he was just
[45:34] giving it to me and I I you know I said
[45:36] yeah you know rapturing faith lies on
[45:37] the tapes but it's got to move from
[45:39] those tapes to our hearts you know and
[45:41] it was about then that brother Andrew he
[45:43] just pulled up and sat down and I'd
[45:45] never met him before but we just started
[45:47] to talk like we'd known each other
[45:48] forever and it was just wonderful to
[45:50] meet him that way and I found out that
[45:52] he was a full-time evangelist and I said
[45:54] my goodness we need to talk and so
[45:57] that's where it started so um he is very
[46:00] interested in uh doing annual meetings
[46:02] so that's our plan moving forward we're
[46:04] going to continue to do annual meetings
[46:06] and we'll try and get a solid time that
[46:08] works for everyone so uh yeah and he's
[46:12] completely on board with that so it's
[46:14] wonderful that we can actually try and
[46:16] do that all right enough talking are you
[46:19] happy tonight it's certainly good to see
[46:22] everyone here carrying on out of the uh
[46:25] pergam and church age you know uh I
[46:27] believe we left off at paragraph
[46:30] 131 last time it now behooves us to
[46:34] discover the original mother and child
[46:37] the original goddess mother of Babylon
[46:39] was SE
[46:42] saramis who was called Ria in the
[46:44] Eastern countries in her arms she held a
[46:47] son who though a babe was described as a
[46:51] tall strong handsome especially
[46:53] captivating to women in Ezekiel 8:14 he
[46:57] was called tamuz among several classical
[47:00] writers he was called bakas to the
[47:02] Babylonians he was
[47:06] nus what accounts for the fact that he
[47:08] is represented as a babe in arms and yet
[47:11] described as a Great and Mighty Man is
[47:14] that he is known as the husband's son
[47:17] one of his titles was husband of the
[47:20] mother and in India where the two are
[47:22] known is eswara and isi he the husband
[47:26] is represented as the babe at the breast
[47:28] of his own wife that this nenus is the
[47:32] Nimrod of the Bible we can affirm by
[47:35] comparing history with the Genesis
[47:37] account pompus said nus king of Assyria
[47:43] changed the ancient moderate ways of
[47:45] life by the desire for
[47:48] Conquest he was the first who carried
[47:51] war against his neighbors he conquered
[47:54] all nations from Assyria to lib Libya as
[47:59] these men knew not the Arts of War I
[48:03] think we talked about it last time how
[48:05] tragic it would have been to be living
[48:06] in peace and then have your neighbors
[48:08] March over and just start slaughtering
[48:10] your people it would have been uh just
[48:14] shocking Doras said nenus was the most
[48:18] ancient of Assyrian Kings mentioned in
[48:20] history being of warlike disposition he
[48:23] trained many young men rigorously in the
[48:25] Arts of War he brought bab Babylonia
[48:29] under him while yet there was no city of
[48:33] Babylon thus we see this nenus started
[48:36] to become great in Babylon built Babel
[48:40] and took over Assyria becoming its king
[48:43] and then proceeded to devour other vast
[48:45] territories where the people were
[48:47] unskilled in war and lived in a moderate
[48:51] way as said in pompus now in Genesis 10
[48:55] speaking of the kingdom of nim Rod it
[48:57] says and the beginning of his kingdom
[48:59] was Babel and Eric and akad and kalna in
[49:04] the land of shinar out of that land went
[49:07] forth Asher and builded Nineveh and the
[49:11] City of rabo and kala we know that's
[49:15] Genesis 1010 and 11 but the translators
[49:19] made a mistake in translating Asher as a
[49:22] noun for it is a verb and in the Chalan
[49:25] means to make strong strong thus it is
[49:28] Nimrod who having been made strong he
[49:31] established his kingdom by building the
[49:33] world's first Army which he trained by
[49:36] Drilling and through the rigors of
[49:38] hunting went beyond shinar with his
[49:41] strong Army and subdued Nations and
[49:43] built cities such as Nineveh which was
[49:46] named after him for even today a chief
[49:49] part of the ruins of that city is called
[49:52] Nim round since we have discovered who
[49:55] ninis was it is now necessary to
[49:58] discover who his father was according to
[50:00] history it was Bell the founder of
[50:03] Babylon now it is to be noted here that
[50:06] Bell founded in the sense that he
[50:08] started this whole move but it was the
[50:11] son nus that established it and was the
[50:15] first king but according to the
[50:17] scripture the father of nimrod was kush
[50:20] and Kush begat Nimrod not only is this
[50:24] so but we find that ham begat Kush and
[50:28] now in the Egyptian culture Bell was
[50:31] called Hermes and Hermes means the son
[50:34] of
[50:35] ham according to history Hermes was the
[50:39] great prophet of idolatry he was The
[50:41] Interpreter of the Gods another name by
[50:45] which he was called was Mercury read
[50:48] acts 14 11
[50:52] to2 henus says this about The God Who
[50:56] was known variously as Bell Hermes
[50:59] Mercury etc for many ages men lived
[51:03] under the government of Jo not the Roman
[51:06] Jo but the Jehovah of the Hebrews who
[51:09] predates Roman history without cities
[51:12] and without laws and all speaking one
[51:15] language but after that mercury Bell
[51:18] Kush interpreted the speeches of men
[51:21] whence an interpreter is called her
[51:25] miniutes the same individual distributed
[51:29] the Nations then Discord
[51:32] began it is seen from this that Bellar
[51:35] Kush the father of nimrod originally was
[51:38] the ring leader that led the people away
[51:42] from the true God and encourage the
[51:44] people as The Interpreter of the Gods to
[51:48] take another form of
[51:51] religion my he encouraged them to go
[51:54] ahead with the tower which his son
[51:57] actually built this encouragement is
[51:59] what brought the confusion and division
[52:01] of men so that he was both interpreter
[52:05] and
[52:06] confuser Kush then was the father of the
[52:10] polytheistic system and when men were
[52:14] deified by men he of course became the
[52:18] father of gods now Kush was called Bell
[52:21] and Bell in Roman mythology was Janice
[52:24] he is pictured having two faces and he
[52:26] carried a club by which he confounded
[52:29] and Scattered the people ID writes that
[52:31] Janice said concerning himself the
[52:34] Ancients called me chaos thus we find
[52:38] that the Kush of the Bible the original
[52:41] rebel against
[52:43] monotheism was called Bell Bellis Hermes
[52:47] Janice Etc amongst the ancient peoples
[52:51] he purported to bring Revelations and
[52:53] interpretations from the gods to the
[52:55] people
[52:57] now in so doing he caused the wrath of
[53:00] God to scatter the people bringing
[53:03] Division and
[53:05] confusion this one just caused me to
[53:08] just pause there on that on that that
[53:10] one sentence there in doing so he caus
[53:12] the wrath of God to scatter the people
[53:15] we know the story bringing Division and
[53:17] confusion now up to this point we have
[53:20] seen whence polytheism or the worship of
[53:22] many gods came but did you notice that
[53:25] we also found a mention of a man named
[53:28] Kush who is given title of the father of
[53:31] gods did you notice here the old theme
[53:33] of ancient mythologies that Gods
[53:36] identify themselves with men that is
[53:38] where ancestor worship comes from so we
[53:43] might just examine history to find out
[53:45] about ancestor worship well it was
[53:48] brought out that kush introduced a three
[53:50] God worship of father son and spirit
[53:54] three Gods who were all equal
[53:57] but he knew about the seed of the woman
[53:59] coming so there would have to be a woman
[54:00] and her seed come into the picture this
[54:04] was brought to pass when Nimrod died his
[54:06] wife Samus defied him and thus made
[54:09] herself the mother of the son and also
[54:11] the mother of the Gods just exactly as
[54:13] the Roman Church has deified Mary they
[54:16] claim that she was without sin and was
[54:19] the mother of God she SE samiramis
[54:23] called Nimrod zeros
[54:26] which means the woman's promised seed
[54:30] but it wasn't too long until the woman
[54:32] began to attract more attention than the
[54:34] son and soon she was the one who was
[54:37] depicted as trampling underfoot the
[54:39] serpent they called her the queen of the
[54:42] heaven and made her Divine how like
[54:45] today when Mary the mother of Jesus had
[54:48] been elevated to immortality and right
[54:51] now as of September 1964 the Vatican
[54:54] council is attempting to give a quality
[54:57] to Mary she does not possess for they
[55:00] would like to call her Mary the
[55:02] mediatrix Mary the mother of all
[55:05] believers or Mary or mother of the
[55:07] church
[55:09] sorry if there was ever babylonish
[55:12] ancestor worship in a religion it is the
[55:15] religion of the Church of
[55:17] Rome
[55:20] my I think a lot can be said there about
[55:23] Mary but I like what the prophet said he
[55:26] made made it real clear he made it real
[55:27] simple he said she just like everyone
[55:30] else had to be one of those 120 in the
[55:33] upper room she had to have a holy ghost
[55:36] experience for
[55:37] herself she did not just become someone
[55:40] that she wasn't she was human being just
[55:42] like
[55:43] us paragraph 142 Not only was ancestor
[55:47] worship originated in Babylon but it but
[55:49] so also was the worship of nature it was
[55:52] in Babylon the gods were identified with
[55:54] the Sun Moon Etc
[55:56] the chief object in nature was the sun
[55:59] which had light-giving and Heat giving
[56:01] properties and appears to man as a ball
[56:03] of fire in the heavens thus the chief
[56:06] God would be the sun god whom they
[56:09] called
[56:10] bael often the sun was depicted as a
[56:14] circle of flame and soon around that
[56:16] flame there appeared a serpent it wasn't
[56:20] long until the serpent became a symbol
[56:22] of the Sun and consequently worshiped
[56:26] thus the desire of Satan's heart became
[56:29] full-fledged he was worshiped as God his
[56:34] throne was
[56:36] established his slaves bowed to him
[56:40] there in pergamus in the form of a
[56:43] living serpent he was worshiped the tree
[56:47] of knowledge of Good and Evil now
[56:49] symbolized in the form of a living
[56:51] serpent had not only seduced Eve but the
[56:55] majority of
[56:57] mankind but how did pergamus become the
[57:00] seat of Satan if Babylon was the seat
[57:04] the answer again is in history when
[57:07] Babylon fell to the mes and Persians the
[57:09] priest king adelus fled the city and
[57:12] went to pergamus with his
[57:15] priests and sacred Mysteries there he
[57:18] set up his kingdom outside the Roman
[57:20] Empire and thrived under the care of the
[57:22] devil this has been a very short resume
[57:24] of the history of the Babylon religion
[57:27] and its Adventure Advent to pergamus
[57:29] many questions are no doubt left
[57:31] unanswered and much more no doubt could
[57:33] have been said to Enlighten us but this
[57:36] is not intended to be a study of history
[57:39] rather it's intended to be a help to the
[57:42] study of the word once again hey the
[57:45] prophet pointing right back to the
[57:50] word the
[57:52] denunciation Revelations 2: 14 to 15 but
[57:57] I have a few things against thee because
[58:00] thou Hast there them that hold the
[58:02] doctrine of balam who taught baac to
[58:05] cast a stumbling block before the
[58:06] children of Israel to eat things
[58:09] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[58:12] fornication so Hast th Al so hast thou
[58:17] also them that hold the doctrine of the
[58:21] nians which thing I
[58:25] hate now I just want to pause there for
[58:27] a second if we were to go and look it up
[58:29] I don't want to tonight I would just
[58:31] recommend it if you want to go and look
[58:34] up this story about balum and baac we
[58:38] know it very well how there was the the
[58:41] the donkey that actually spoke to him
[58:44] the the Mad prophet he got out of the
[58:47] will of God he was coerced into Fame he
[58:51] was coerced into a little bit of Fortune
[58:54] and we know that God dealt with him
[58:56] through the the donkey and the donkey
[58:59] spoke so it just goes to show that God
[59:02] can use whoever he wants to to actually
[59:04] speak to man but what I want to get to
[59:07] with this is there's a whole story about
[59:11] how
[59:12] balum taught baac taught balum kept
[59:16] showing him over and over and over again
[59:18] the hinder parts of the children of
[59:20] Israel if if if they couldn't get if he
[59:23] couldn't get the children of Israel to
[59:24] fall and actually
[59:26] get out of the land what he wanted to do
[59:28] was get them to actually start looking
[59:30] at one another and isn't that the same
[59:33] spirit that can get into the church
[59:35] today do you do you know brother so and
[59:37] so do you do you know sister so and so
[59:40] have you heard what they've done have
[59:41] you seen where they've been do you know
[59:43] who their family is do you know do you
[59:45] know do you know just get get get the
[59:47] people to look at the hinder parts and
[59:49] cast what's what you're doing is casting
[59:51] stumbling blocks in front of those
[59:53] people and not recognizing that you're
[59:55] actually under the influence inuence of
[59:56] an evil spirit because God's spirit does
[59:58] not do that that's exactly the same
[1:00:00] Spirit of BAC and balum but what I want
[1:00:04] to get to here is brother Bram he takes
[1:00:06] and uses this this part of Revelations
[1:00:10] 2: 14 and 15 he refers to that story
[1:00:15] here but he goes and he explains all
[1:00:18] about the Catholic church it's got
[1:00:20] nothing to do with balum and baac and I
[1:00:23] love how he brings that out because an
[1:00:25] ordinary human looking at this would
[1:00:27] just want to go back to the story of
[1:00:28] balam and baac and see what they said
[1:00:30] what happened there that's the natural
[1:00:32] thing but here we have a prophet in our
[1:00:34] day taking and bringing light to this
[1:00:36] this scripture in Revelations 2: 14 and
[1:00:40] 15 so as we go forward I just wanted to
[1:00:42] sort of bring that to the surface so
[1:00:44] that we will think about maybe the the
[1:00:46] the original story as we go through this
[1:00:48] and and you don't see him mention the
[1:00:50] original story in here at all in
[1:00:52] paragraph 146 he says in this pergan age
[1:00:55] the Lord denounces two doctrines which
[1:00:58] he hates the doctrine of balum which
[1:01:02] brought idolatry and sinful excess to
[1:01:04] Israel at B peor where they said you
[1:01:07] know what just come and fellowship with
[1:01:09] us everything is fine we're one when God
[1:01:12] said no separate yourself from the
[1:01:14] people of the land no no no separate
[1:01:16] yourself from the sins of the people and
[1:01:18] get right with the word that I gave to
[1:01:20] you through the prophet the doctrine of
[1:01:22] balum and number two the doctrine of the
[1:01:26] nians brother Bram really hammers it in
[1:01:28] here he gets right down to it the the
[1:01:30] right to the bone on this one and it's
[1:01:32] so good but that's simple simply the
[1:01:35] Conquering of the leoty the the the
[1:01:38] lordship of man over man and how man can
[1:01:42] actually set up Bishops and and have
[1:01:44] elders and and and have many churches
[1:01:47] and have everybody participating under
[1:01:49] the headship of one man and that's not
[1:01:51] the way it's supposed to be according to
[1:01:53] the prophet which is according to the
[1:01:55] word which is the thus sayith the Lord
[1:01:57] for our day the the doctrine of the
[1:02:01] nians lordship over man those things are
[1:02:05] the things that God hates he's not just
[1:02:08] displeased with them he hates them I
[1:02:10] think that's
[1:02:12] powerful the doctrine of the nicians
[1:02:15] which had been but deeds in the Ephesian
[1:02:20] age combine this denouncement with the
[1:02:23] fact that he has been emphasizing per
[1:02:26] as the seed of Satan and it is very easy
[1:02:30] and proper to conclude that somehow the
[1:02:32] religion of Babylon has become
[1:02:35] intermingled with Christianity amen
[1:02:39] why now this will not merely this is not
[1:02:42] merely an assumption but a historical
[1:02:45] fact which we will prove by going back
[1:02:48] into history to about 36 ad and coming
[1:02:51] up to the Nan Council of
[1:02:53] 325 when the Christians mainly Jews by
[1:02:56] birth were scattered abroad from
[1:02:57] Jerusalem and went everywhere preaching
[1:02:59] the gospel particularly in the
[1:03:02] synagogues th within 3 years or about in
[1:03:05] 36 ad the gospel had been taken to Rome
[1:03:09] by junas and Andrus who according to
[1:03:14] Romans 16:7 were Apostles the the work
[1:03:17] flourished there for several years until
[1:03:20] the constant altercations of the Jews
[1:03:23] amongst themselves caused Emperor
[1:03:26] Claudius to expel them from Rome with
[1:03:29] the Jews banished from that City the
[1:03:31] backbone of that little church was
[1:03:33] practically broken but it wasn't it was
[1:03:37] practically perhaps even the elders had
[1:03:40] been Jewish and so would be gone the
[1:03:43] flock would be unattended and since the
[1:03:45] word had not been written as a guide it
[1:03:48] would be very easy for this little flock
[1:03:50] to drift or be inundated by the
[1:03:53] philosophers and pagans of that day with
[1:03:56] Grievous wolves on the prow and the
[1:03:59] spirit of antichrist released we find
[1:04:02] from history that this little church in
[1:04:04] Rome became hopelessly backslidden and
[1:04:08] began to introduce Pagan ceremonies
[1:04:11] under Christian
[1:04:13] titles sometimes you can have Ministry
[1:04:16] that will try and mingle with the word
[1:04:19] and what happens is you wind up with
[1:04:22] that exact same thing Pagan s ceremonies
[1:04:26] under Christian titles and what happens
[1:04:30] is it will break the backbone of the
[1:04:31] church it will destroy the power of God
[1:04:35] inside a church and remember Satan he's
[1:04:37] not afraid to come to a message Church
[1:04:40] he's not afraid to try and speak little
[1:04:42] things to brother Barry you should look
[1:04:43] at this book you should quote that
[1:04:44] author you should bring this you should
[1:04:46] do that no way back to the word back to
[1:04:49] the word of a Vindicated Prophet that's
[1:04:51] the only word as the period of
[1:04:54] banishment lasted for 13 years the
[1:04:56] founders Junius and
[1:04:59] Andrus I hope I'm saying that right did
[1:05:01] not come back until 54 ad imagine their
[1:05:04] horror to find a church with a Christian
[1:05:08] title that was woefully
[1:05:11] Pagan there were altars in the church
[1:05:13] upon which they placed incense and
[1:05:15] celebrated Pagan rights the established
[1:05:18] leaders of that church could not be
[1:05:20] approached so with the few who had tried
[1:05:23] to remain faithful they started a new
[1:05:25] church or the second Church of Rome God
[1:05:29] graciously worked amongst them by signs
[1:05:32] and wonders so that a third church was
[1:05:35] started isn't it interesting the first
[1:05:37] church the second church and the third
[1:05:40] church and though the first church was
[1:05:43] reproached for being Pagan and not
[1:05:47] Christian in its worship it would not
[1:05:50] give up its title but remained and Still
[1:05:54] Remains the first Church of Rome the
[1:05:57] Roman Catholic church now the majority
[1:06:01] of us have the mistaken idea that any
[1:06:05] and all who call themselves Christians
[1:06:08] would be the target of the devil and
[1:06:11] consequently the brunt of governmental
[1:06:14] tyranny but not so this first church had
[1:06:18] begun to thrive and multiply so in
[1:06:21] numbers that the Emperors and various
[1:06:24] officials of the government actually
[1:06:25] favored that church for political
[1:06:28] reasons thus when the leaders of the
[1:06:30] first church in Rome found themselves in
[1:06:33] favor they took the opportunity to turn
[1:06:36] the government against the True
[1:06:38] Believers can you believe
[1:06:40] that Christians and demand their
[1:06:44] persecution unless they came into their
[1:06:45] fold unless You' seen it my way you're
[1:06:47] lost as lost can be my you ever heard
[1:06:50] that
[1:06:51] Spirit one such Bishop of the First
[1:06:54] Church of Rome
[1:06:56] was anitus I hope I said that right too
[1:07:00] who lived in the second century and was
[1:07:03] contemporary with
[1:07:05] polycarp when the venerable polycarp
[1:07:08] heard that the First Christian Church of
[1:07:11] Rome was involved in Pagan ceremonies
[1:07:14] and had corrupted the truth of the
[1:07:16] Gospel he went there to implore them to
[1:07:19] change he saw them prostrate themselves
[1:07:22] before images named after Apostles and
[1:07:25] Saints he saw them light candles and
[1:07:27] burn incense on the altar he saw them
[1:07:30] celebrate the Passover under the name
[1:07:33] Easter where they elevated the dis
[1:07:36] shaped bread and honored the Sun God and
[1:07:39] then they poured the wine out as a
[1:07:41] libation to the gods but this aged Saint
[1:07:46] who had traveled 1500 miles could not
[1:07:49] arrest their downward
[1:07:51] plunge God spoke through him just as was
[1:07:55] leaving Ephraim is married to his idols
[1:07:59] let him alone Hosea
[1:08:02] 4:15 polycarp never more returned
[1:08:07] remember brother bradam he goes on to
[1:08:08] talk about this in in what we're reading
[1:08:10] tonight but uh I think it was in the
[1:08:12] Ephesian age where polycarp was I may
[1:08:16] have that wrong I think it was um
[1:08:19] brother Bram said that
[1:08:22] uh that this brother here uh he should
[1:08:26] have he should have I'm sorry I'm hoping
[1:08:29] I'm getting this
[1:08:30] right he should have been the one for
[1:08:32] the
[1:08:34] age I apologize yeah polycarp he should
[1:08:37] have been the one who actually was the
[1:08:39] one for the age but he was not the
[1:08:40] messenger for the age because he
[1:08:42] actually fell for the leadership of man
[1:08:46] he actually was more for the organized
[1:08:48] religion than he was for following the
[1:08:50] word of the Lord Brother Bram gets into
[1:08:52] that a little further here sorry I was
[1:08:53] confusing myself it happens easy
[1:08:55] paragraph 151 following anitus was the
[1:09:00] Wicked Bishop of Rome called Victor he
[1:09:03] introduced even more Pagan festivals and
[1:09:05] ceremonies into the first church and
[1:09:08] also went about trying his utmost to
[1:09:11] persuade the true Christian churches to
[1:09:13] incorporate the same ideas they would
[1:09:16] not do as he requested so he prevailed
[1:09:19] upon government officials to persecute
[1:09:22] the Believers hailing them into court
[1:09:25] casting them into prison and even
[1:09:27] meeting out death to many such an
[1:09:31] example of his vile Deeds is found in
[1:09:33] history where
[1:09:35] Emperor
[1:09:36] Septimus seus was prevailed upon by
[1:09:41] kalistus the friend of Victor to kill
[1:09:46] 7,000 at thessalonica because these True
[1:09:50] Believers celebrated the Passover
[1:09:53] according to the Lord Jesus and not
[1:09:55] according to the worship of
[1:09:58] estarte already the false Vine was
[1:10:01] turning loose its anger against the
[1:10:03] Living God by killing the elect even as
[1:10:07] did its forebear Cain kill
[1:10:11] Abel just goes right back to the word of
[1:10:14] God the true church kept trying to get
[1:10:17] the first church to
[1:10:20] repent now I got those two highlighted
[1:10:22] in here it just jumped out at me the
[1:10:24] true church and the first
[1:10:26] church first doesn't always mean
[1:10:30] true it would not do so it increased in
[1:10:33] size and influence it embarked upon a
[1:10:35] constant campaign to discredit the true
[1:10:39] seed they claimed that they and they
[1:10:42] alone were the true representatives of
[1:10:45] the Lord Jesus Christ and vaunted the
[1:10:48] fact that they were the original Church
[1:10:50] in Rome that was the only thing they had
[1:10:52] to stand on right they never had the
[1:10:54] power of God in their midst and they
[1:10:57] alone were the first church indeed they
[1:11:00] were the first church and indeed they
[1:11:04] are thus by the time this third Church
[1:11:07] age we have two churches bearing the
[1:11:10] same name but with a bitter difference
[1:11:13] between them one has departed from the
[1:11:16] truth married idols and has no life in
[1:11:18] her she has hybridized herself and the
[1:11:22] signs of death not life follow in her
[1:11:27] wake and I want to say this what is the
[1:11:29] sign of death I got thinking about that
[1:11:32] the signs of of death are What's
[1:11:34] following in her
[1:11:36] wake I'll say
[1:11:39] this where the churches are
[1:11:41] dying the numbers are declining people
[1:11:44] don't want to go to church the children
[1:11:46] they don't want to serve a God that's
[1:11:48] just form it's just formal lukewarm
[1:11:51] formal and Powerless children don't want
[1:11:53] to serve a god like that children want
[1:11:55] to serve a God where they see God as a
[1:11:58] living God where they see god with skin
[1:12:00] on that's the god that children want to
[1:12:03] serve but that's what I believe he's
[1:12:04] talking about here I could be wrong
[1:12:06] about it but I believe that's the death
[1:12:08] that's happening it's spiritual death
[1:12:10] people don't want to serve a god there's
[1:12:11] no point it's just
[1:12:14] form she is powerful with many members
[1:12:18] she is favored by the world the other is
[1:12:22] a little persecuted group but she
[1:12:24] follows the word amen and the signs
[1:12:28] follow her the sick are healed the dead
[1:12:32] are raised she is alive with the life of
[1:12:34] the word the life and word of God she
[1:12:37] loves not her life but holds to his name
[1:12:40] and his faith even unto death not her
[1:12:44] faith his faith and so the terrible
[1:12:47] persecution of official Rome fell upon
[1:12:49] the True Believers until Constantine
[1:12:52] arose and granted freedom of religious
[1:12:55] worship now this is interesting there
[1:12:58] seems to be two reasons why this Freedom
[1:13:00] was granted in the first place various
[1:13:03] good Emperors had not allowed
[1:13:05] persecution but as they passed on they
[1:13:07] were followed by those who killed
[1:13:09] Christians it was so senseless that they
[1:13:12] finally came to public heed that the
[1:13:15] Christians ought to be left
[1:13:17] alone the second and best noted reason
[1:13:20] is that Constantine had a very difficult
[1:13:22] battle ahead of him in taking over over
[1:13:25] the control of the
[1:13:27] Empire it's interesting how the Lord
[1:13:30] uses things how he uses people one night
[1:13:33] in a dream he saw a white cross appear
[1:13:35] before him he felt that he that this was
[1:13:39] an omen unto him that if the Christians
[1:13:42] prayed for a victory for him he would
[1:13:45] win the battle he promised freedom for
[1:13:47] them in the event that he was Victorious
[1:13:49] he was Victorious and the freedom of
[1:13:51] worship was granted in the Edict of
[1:13:54] Nan's 312
[1:13:56] a but this freedom from persecution and
[1:14:00] death was not as
[1:14:02] magnanimous as it had first appeared he
[1:14:05] had a motive Constantine was now the
[1:14:09] patron as a patron his interest was
[1:14:12] somewhat more than that of an observer
[1:14:15] for he decided that the church needed
[1:14:17] his help in her Affairs isn't that nice
[1:14:22] he had seen them disagreeing over ious
[1:14:25] matters and this is really isn't it
[1:14:26] beautiful Jesus said how will people
[1:14:28] know that you have you love me how how
[1:14:30] will they know you love me you persecute
[1:14:32] one another you talk about one another
[1:14:34] you're at odds against one another you
[1:14:36] claim the same thing you believe you say
[1:14:38] you see believe the same thing you say
[1:14:40] you you follow the same Prophet but yet
[1:14:42] you're divided there's divisions right
[1:14:45] how is that that doesn't work and this
[1:14:48] is exactly what a worldly man was
[1:14:50] observing I just can't help but think it
[1:14:52] he had seen them disagreeing over
[1:14:54] various matters one of which involved
[1:14:57] Aras Bishop of Alexander who taught that
[1:14:59] his adherence taught his adherence that
[1:15:03] Jesus was not truly God but a lesser
[1:15:07] being having been created of God the
[1:15:09] western church held the opposite view
[1:15:11] believing that Jesus was the very
[1:15:13] essence of God and as they said co-equal
[1:15:17] with the father and isn't it amazing to
[1:15:19] look at those and say wow it's beautiful
[1:15:21] to have a prophet that would bring it
[1:15:23] right to center not one way or not the
[1:15:25] other way but right in the middle right
[1:15:27] where it needs to be with such matters
[1:15:30] along with the intrusion of pagan
[1:15:32] ceremony into worship the emperor called
[1:15:34] for the nian council in
[1:15:36] 3:25 with the thought that he would
[1:15:39] bring all groups together where they
[1:15:41] could iron out their differences and
[1:15:43] come to a common understanding and all
[1:15:46] be one isn't it
[1:15:48] peculiar that though this started with
[1:15:51] Constantine it didn't die but is very
[1:15:54] much alive
[1:15:55] today as the World Council of
[1:15:58] churches and where he failed to truly
[1:16:01] achieve it it will be achieved in this
[1:16:03] day through the ecumenical
[1:16:06] move now this interference of the state
[1:16:09] with the church is a foolish thing for
[1:16:12] the for the world does not understand
[1:16:14] either the truth found in the word or
[1:16:17] the ways of the church why the very
[1:16:20] decision handed down by the council
[1:16:22] Council that Aras was wrong with
[1:16:25] was that Aras was wrong was reversed two
[1:16:29] years later by the emperor and for many
[1:16:31] years that false Doctrine was foed upon
[1:16:34] the
[1:16:35] people but that church and state would
[1:16:38] come together was truly forn of the Lord
[1:16:42] the very name pergamus means thoroughly
[1:16:45] married and indeed State and church were
[1:16:49] married politics and religion were
[1:16:52] United The Offspring of that Union
[1:16:55] have been consistently the most horrible
[1:16:58] hybrids the world has ever seen the
[1:17:01] truth is not in them but all the evil
[1:17:04] ways of Cain the first hybrid
[1:17:08] Is Not only was State and church wedded
[1:17:11] in this age but the Babylonian religion
[1:17:15] was officially joined to the first
[1:17:17] church Satan now had access to the name
[1:17:21] of Christ can you believe that Satan now
[1:17:24] had had access to the name of Christ and
[1:17:28] he was enthroned as God In
[1:17:32] Worship with the help of Federal Aid the
[1:17:35] churches fell air to beautiful buildings
[1:17:38] which were lined with altars of white
[1:17:42] marble and images of The Departed
[1:17:45] Saints now I don't know how many people
[1:17:48] have had the opportunity to do it but if
[1:17:50] you ever get the chance go to the UK and
[1:17:54] take a look at some of of those churches
[1:17:56] and this becomes alive you can see what
[1:17:58] he's talking about if you ever get a
[1:18:00] chance to go to Italy and see some of
[1:18:02] the churches the Basilica is there see
[1:18:04] their churches this becomes alive the
[1:18:06] state funded the building of these
[1:18:09] buildings and even today you can't even
[1:18:11] imagine what these buildings would cost
[1:18:12] to build just tremendous I think is it
[1:18:15] in Spain there's a church that's just
[1:18:17] not even finished they've been building
[1:18:19] it for I don't know a hundred years or
[1:18:21] something and it's still not done
[1:18:24] they're still buing building on it it's
[1:18:26] crazy but it's
[1:18:27] true it's when the the church and state
[1:18:30] become one with the help of Federal Aid
[1:18:33] the churches fell air to beautiful
[1:18:34] buildings which were lined with altars
[1:18:37] of white marble and images of The
[1:18:38] Departed Saints and right in this age is
[1:18:42] when the Beast of Revelations
[1:18:44] 13:3 that was wounded to death the Rome
[1:18:48] the Pagan Roman Empire came back to life
[1:18:52] and power as the holy Roman Empire
[1:18:56] brother bradam thoroughly brings that
[1:18:57] out in the study of the
[1:19:00] seals Rome was a material nation and had
[1:19:03] suffered much depletion and soon would
[1:19:05] suffer it completely but it it mattered
[1:19:09] not now for her religious Empire would
[1:19:12] keep her on top of the world governing
[1:19:14] from inside where she would not appear
[1:19:16] to do so from the
[1:19:18] outside he says let me show the exact
[1:19:22] scriptural truth of this matter for I do
[1:19:25] not anyone want anyone to think that I
[1:19:27] am giving a revelation of my
[1:19:30] own one not found in scripture isn't
[1:19:33] that beautiful how he would say that
[1:19:35] let's just take it right back to the
[1:19:36] word once again and
[1:19:39] uh yeah yeah it's just amazing I like it
[1:19:43] I like it a lot he he goes into
[1:19:46] Daniel chapter 2: 31-
[1:19:50] 45 this is Daniel talking to the King
[1:19:53] Nebuchadnezzar now about the dream that
[1:19:56] he had thou oh king sawest and beheld a
[1:19:59] great image this great image whose
[1:20:01] brightness was excellent stood before
[1:20:04] thee and the form thereof was terrible
[1:20:08] the image's head was of fine gold his
[1:20:10] breast and his arms of silver and his
[1:20:13] belly and his thighs of brass his legs
[1:20:17] of iron his feet part of iron and part
[1:20:21] of
[1:20:22] clay thou sawest till a stone was cut
[1:20:26] out without hands which smote the image
[1:20:29] upon his feet that were of iron and clay
[1:20:33] and break them to Pieces then was the
[1:20:36] iron the clay the brass the silver and
[1:20:39] the gold broken to pieces together and
[1:20:41] became like the chaff of the summer
[1:20:44] threshing floors and the wind carried
[1:20:47] them away that no place was found for
[1:20:49] them and the stone that smote the image
[1:20:53] became a great Mountain and filled the
[1:20:56] whole earth we know that that is a
[1:20:58] representation of Mount Zion the literal
[1:21:02] city of
[1:21:03] God this is the dream and we will tell
[1:21:07] the interpretation thereof before the
[1:21:09] king thou oh king art a king of kings
[1:21:13] for the god of Heaven hath given thee a
[1:21:15] kingdom power and strength and Glory
[1:21:19] it's just beautiful how Daniel would
[1:21:20] just have the courage to say that that's
[1:21:22] the only reason you're there buddy is
[1:21:23] because God is
[1:21:25] God and whosoever wheresoever the
[1:21:28] children of men dwell the beasts of the
[1:21:31] field and the fowls of the heaven hath
[1:21:33] he given into thine hand and hath made
[1:21:36] thee rule over them all Thou Art his
[1:21:40] this head of gold and after thee shall
[1:21:43] arise another kingdom inferior to thee
[1:21:45] and another third Kingdom of brass which
[1:21:48] shall bear bear rule over all the earth
[1:21:51] and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong
[1:21:53] as iron for as much as iron
[1:22:01] breakthe shall it break in pieces and
[1:22:04] bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet
[1:22:08] and Toes part of Potter's clay and part
[1:22:11] of iron the kingdom shall be divided but
[1:22:15] there shall be in it of the strength of
[1:22:18] the iron for as much as thou sawest the
[1:22:21] iron mixed with myy clay
[1:22:24] and as the toes of the feet were part of
[1:22:27] iron and part of clay so the kingdom
[1:22:31] shall be partly strong and partly broken
[1:22:35] and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with
[1:22:38] myy Clay they shall mingle themselves
[1:22:41] with the seed of men but they shall not
[1:22:44] cleave one to another even as iron is
[1:22:47] not mixed with clay and in the days of
[1:22:50] these Kings shall the god of Heaven set
[1:22:52] up a kingdom which shall never be
[1:22:56] destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
[1:22:58] left to other people but it shall break
[1:23:01] in pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[1:23:05] and it shall stand
[1:23:07] forever for as much as thou sawest that
[1:23:10] the stone was cut out of the mountain
[1:23:13] without hands and that it break in
[1:23:15] pieces the iron the brass the clay the
[1:23:18] silver and the gold the great God hath
[1:23:22] made known to the king what shall come
[1:23:24] to pass Hereafter and the dream is
[1:23:28] certain and the interpretation thereof
[1:23:34] sure I just love it because he does like
[1:23:37] we said he does not go into the story of
[1:23:39] balum and baac he he brings it right
[1:23:42] down to the rubber meeting the road this
[1:23:43] is history now this is what's happened
[1:23:45] in history and this is what's going to
[1:23:46] happen in the future is what brother
[1:23:48] bradam does with this he goes on to say
[1:23:50] herein is revealed an exact account of
[1:23:53] future
[1:23:55] unfilled history that was prophesied to
[1:23:57] come upon the Earth from the time of
[1:24:00] Daniel until Jesus would come and reign
[1:24:03] as the son of David we know that's the
[1:24:05] Millennium it is known as the times of
[1:24:08] the Gentiles it had within it four
[1:24:12] historical divisions which were known by
[1:24:15] the dominating Empire in each division
[1:24:18] Babylonian Meo Persian Grecian and Roman
[1:24:23] the Great greatest and most absolute
[1:24:26] monarchy was the Babylonian which was
[1:24:29] typified as the head of gold the next in
[1:24:32] glory was the MEO Persian which as
[1:24:35] history bore out was truly less glorious
[1:24:38] and was typified as the breast and arms
[1:24:41] of silver then there followed the
[1:24:44] Grecian age whose King was the most
[1:24:47] brilliant of all military leaders the
[1:24:50] world has ever known so it was fittingly
[1:24:53] typified
[1:24:55] as the belly and thighs of
[1:24:57] brass it was less glorious than the
[1:24:59] other two preceding it finally came the
[1:25:03] last Kingdom which was the Roman Empire
[1:25:06] typified as the legs and feet but
[1:25:08] wherein the former kingdoms were
[1:25:10] typified as pure minerals pure gold
[1:25:13] silver and Brass this last empire was
[1:25:16] purely iron only in the legs for when it
[1:25:19] came to the feet it was a mixture of
[1:25:21] iron and clay and mineral and soil just
[1:25:26] don't mix and produce consistency and
[1:25:31] strength excuse me but not only is this
[1:25:35] so but most amazing this last empire
[1:25:38] Roman would endure in its peculiar mixed
[1:25:42] state right up until Jesus returns
[1:25:46] that's a pretty long time this Roman
[1:25:48] Empire of iron iron signifying power and
[1:25:51] great destructive force against
[1:25:53] opposition was to be made of two main
[1:25:56] divisions and and it certainly was for
[1:25:59] the Empire literally split into two East
[1:26:02] and West both very powerful crushing all
[1:26:06] before them but as the glory and power
[1:26:09] of all Empires fail so this Empire began
[1:26:13] to fall also thus Rome fell Pagan
[1:26:17] Imperial Rome was no longer iron she
[1:26:19] crumbled she was wounded to death Rome
[1:26:23] could not now rule it was all
[1:26:26] over so thought the world but how wrong
[1:26:30] the world was for that head
[1:26:34] Rome though wounded was not wounded unto
[1:26:38] death woest translation of Revelations
[1:26:43] 133 and one of the heads appeared to
[1:26:46] have been mortally wounded the throat
[1:26:49] having been slashed and his death stroke
[1:26:53] was healed he and the whole earth
[1:26:56] followed after the wild beast in
[1:27:00] amazement people look at Rome they look
[1:27:03] at the nation of Italy and as they as
[1:27:07] they look they do not realize that Rome
[1:27:10] with her strict confines where the pope
[1:27:14] has an actual area of his domain how
[1:27:17] many people know that he has an area of
[1:27:20] domain inside of the city of Rome
[1:27:22] there's the country of Italy there's the
[1:27:24] city of Rome but there's another city
[1:27:27] inside that City called The Vatican City
[1:27:29] and they have their own set of rules but
[1:27:32] he also has his own set of ambassadors
[1:27:34] that actually go all the way around the
[1:27:36] world and and yeah it's amazing the
[1:27:39] influence that that uh little tiny place
[1:27:42] that actual area of his domain where he
[1:27:45] rules from is worldwide it's amazing it
[1:27:49] is literally a nation within a nation
[1:27:52] and she has ambassadors and receives
[1:27:56] ambassadors papal false Christian Rome
[1:28:00] she is even called The Eternal City how
[1:28:05] Blasphemous Now controls by religion
[1:28:09] even more ability than when Pagan
[1:28:12] Imperial Rome controlled by the pure
[1:28:15] iron of
[1:28:17] force now many people would look at this
[1:28:19] and say you know brother Barry you're
[1:28:20] crazy you're heretical for even saying
[1:28:22] this because there's a lot of ecumenical
[1:28:24] movement there's a lot of denominational
[1:28:26] churches that are non- denominational
[1:28:28] and and they're not Roman Catholic and
[1:28:30] they would say the Roman Catholics are
[1:28:32] wrong but you know what's interesting is
[1:28:34] if you look at their website I was
[1:28:35] talking to someone about this earlier in
[1:28:37] the week if you look at the websites you
[1:28:39] know who we are what what we're about
[1:28:41] about us whatever it is you'll be able
[1:28:44] to find more times than not the Apostles
[1:28:47] Creed why do you find the Apostles Creed
[1:28:49] there because it's it's homage to the
[1:28:52] mother right brother Bram brought it out
[1:28:55] very clearly there's a mother and
[1:28:56] there's harlots and the harlots are the
[1:28:58] churches of denomination that actually
[1:29:01] fall under that category and you know
[1:29:03] what they don't have to swear that they
[1:29:04] believe the Roman Catholic church
[1:29:06] because the leaders of those churches
[1:29:08] already had amen and as long as the
[1:29:10] leaders do it then everyone who falls
[1:29:12] under that Ministry they're under that
[1:29:14] Ministry amen and I think it's
[1:29:16] interesting because what they do is they
[1:29:18] actually put a little asterisk in there
[1:29:20] I didn't bring it tonight maybe we will
[1:29:21] next time but if you read the Apostles
[1:29:23] Creed you can type it into Google and
[1:29:25] come up with the Apostles Creed real
[1:29:26] easy um it it says a reference in there
[1:29:29] to the Holy Roman Catholic church and
[1:29:33] they put a little asterisk by that line
[1:29:35] of the Apostles Creed and at the bottom
[1:29:37] they have a clarification that says that
[1:29:39] the word Catholic just means universal
[1:29:41] church not the Holy Roman Catholic
[1:29:43] church but they don't understand it's
[1:29:45] too late by that point when they're
[1:29:47] putting that Apostles Creed in there
[1:29:49] when the prophet for our age said it's
[1:29:51] wrong they don't understand that they've
[1:29:53] actually already signed up it's already
[1:29:56] too late a little asterisk is not going
[1:29:59] to negate our responsibility to follow
[1:30:03] the word for our day you know the
[1:30:06] children of Israel they could not have
[1:30:07] gone to Jeremiah and said you know what
[1:30:10] we've got in our word in our in our
[1:30:12] Creeds and our dogmas in our in our
[1:30:14] about us on our website we've got a
[1:30:16] little asterisk that says we're not
[1:30:20] actually falling under the headship of
[1:30:21] the king here so uh you know it's going
[1:30:24] to be okay it won't be okay the only way
[1:30:26] it will be okay is to fall under the
[1:30:28] word leadership of the Lord through the
[1:30:31] Vindicated profit for your age that's
[1:30:33] the only way it will work but everyone
[1:30:36] else they don't understand it they're
[1:30:39] already under the influence of Rome and
[1:30:42] the people in North America maybe don't
[1:30:44] understand it but alls you have to do
[1:30:46] we've said it before brother Ken brought
[1:30:48] it out real clear he played the video
[1:30:50] here of Tony Palmer in the states and
[1:30:53] this is with this Pope the pope that's
[1:30:56] in Vatican City right now reigning as
[1:30:59] the current pope if you look up Tony
[1:31:01] Palmer in Google you will see the video
[1:31:04] that the pastor the former Pastor here
[1:31:06] played and what he shows is him standing
[1:31:08] there telling his relation to the pope
[1:31:11] and how he's the Ambassador for the pope
[1:31:13] and they play a video from the Pope the
[1:31:16] pope speaking and and he's talking to an
[1:31:18] ecumenical council all of the religious
[1:31:21] leaders in Greater North America Maybe
[1:31:23] maybe even in Europe and around the
[1:31:25] world hosted by Kenneth Copeland one of
[1:31:29] the big big ones probably the biggest
[1:31:31] one in the states hosting this by the
[1:31:34] church the Roman Catholic church and
[1:31:37] what does he tell he tells them two
[1:31:39] things that really struck out to me I
[1:31:41] don't know why I'm going off like this I
[1:31:42] just think it's important to understand
[1:31:44] how how late it really is he said that I
[1:31:47] come in the spirit of
[1:31:50] unity and I come under the anointing of
[1:31:53] the spirit of
[1:31:55] Elijah to The ecumenical
[1:31:58] movement you hear that you're like buddy
[1:32:00] that's already happened the Revival's
[1:32:03] done gone but what he says is the word
[1:32:07] Catholic means
[1:32:08] Universal so we're we're more alike than
[1:32:11] we are different aren't we and he goes
[1:32:12] on to talk like that and he says you
[1:32:15] know what I want to tell you is that the
[1:32:17] lutherans have actually already signed
[1:32:19] an approval that the protest of Luther
[1:32:22] is over
[1:32:24] they've come to the Catholic church and
[1:32:26] the Catholic church has come to them and
[1:32:27] they have made amends and now they agree
[1:32:30] to fall under the leadership of the Holy
[1:32:32] Roman Catholic church and he says it
[1:32:34] very clearly that the protest with
[1:32:35] Luther is over so what about you what
[1:32:39] about your protest are you still
[1:32:41] protesting because the word Catholic
[1:32:42] means Universal so we're more Christians
[1:32:45] than than we're not we're more together
[1:32:46] than we're
[1:32:48] apart and here we had a prophet saying
[1:32:50] it's later than you think
[1:32:53] my goodness I should call the
[1:32:56] musicians I'll just read a couple more
[1:32:58] paragraphs here that's okay paragraph
[1:33:03] 168 I I'll just read this part here
[1:33:06] papal false Christianity Rome she is
[1:33:08] even called that Eternal City how
[1:33:11] Blasphemous Now controls by religion not
[1:33:15] politics by religion but religion is
[1:33:17] definitely in the politics controls by
[1:33:20] religion even more a then when Pagan
[1:33:25] Imperial Rome controlled by the pure
[1:33:28] iron of
[1:33:29] force Rome took on a new lease of Life
[1:33:33] I'll call the musicians up or I will
[1:33:35] keep going Rome took on a new lease of
[1:33:39] life and I mean we don't have to end I'm
[1:33:42] good we can keep going that's fine I'm
[1:33:45] going to hear about it
[1:33:47] later I love you honey it's all
[1:33:50] good I'll just stop talking Rome took on
[1:33:54] a new lease of life when Constantine
[1:33:56] joined church and state and backed the
[1:33:59] Union by force the spirit that motivated
[1:34:03] Pagan Rome is the same spirit that now
[1:34:06] motivates the motivates false Christian
[1:34:10] R you can see that is
[1:34:13] so because you now know that the fourth
[1:34:17] Empire never went out of existence it
[1:34:20] just changed in its outer texture isn't
[1:34:24] that amazing how he would bring that to
[1:34:26] life how he would bring it to light the
[1:34:28] iron and the clay they won't mix and and
[1:34:31] that that will remain in place until the
[1:34:35] Eternal reign of the Throne of David I
[1:34:39] think that's amazing because that's
[1:34:41] going to go even beyond that that rule
[1:34:44] will go even Beyond The Rapture of the
[1:34:46] church right all the way to the very end
[1:34:50] once the Nan Council had swung the power
[1:34:52] of political role to the church it
[1:34:55] seemed that there would be no limits to
[1:34:57] which this First Christian Church would
[1:35:00] go the name Christian which originally
[1:35:03] brought persecution now became the name
[1:35:07] of the
[1:35:08] persecutors my
[1:35:11] terrible brothers and sisters I want to
[1:35:14] say this tonight let us never ever find
[1:35:17] ourselves with that label let us never
[1:35:21] ever have a persecution attitude towards
[1:35:25] anyone else on this Earth because if we
[1:35:28] do we're falling under this category
[1:35:30] we're following under this headship this
[1:35:32] spirit is actually getting a hold of Our
[1:35:34] Lives we do not want to persecute anyone
[1:35:38] what we want to do is uplift and
[1:35:39] encourage our brothers and our sisters
[1:35:41] we want to uplift and encourage the
[1:35:43] Sinners the rank lost ones in this world
[1:35:46] that have no hope we want to give them
[1:35:48] the encouragement that they need not
[1:35:50] persecute them maybe stand with me as we
[1:35:53] close
[1:35:55] gracious heavenly father I just can't
[1:35:57] help but think about this last statement
[1:36:00] that we
[1:36:01] read Lord how the how the church went
[1:36:04] from being persecuted to becoming the
[1:36:08] persecutor father I I pray that Lord we
[1:36:11] would maybe just consider these words
[1:36:13] and as we go our separate ways tonight
[1:36:16] that we would just look around this
[1:36:17] world and and consider how the rest of
[1:36:20] this world has no ability to hear what
[1:36:22] we hear and and it's only because you've
[1:36:25] given us ears to hear it's only because
[1:36:27] of election it's only because of your
[1:36:30] predestination it's only because of your
[1:36:32] grace that we're able to hear this word
[1:36:35] in our age and because of your grace we
[1:36:38] say Amen because of your grace we
[1:36:41] worship you because of your grace we
[1:36:44] sigh and we cry for the Abominations in
[1:36:47] this land because we can see that Lord
[1:36:50] this whole world is lost and there's
[1:36:53] only a very few that you have chosen
[1:36:56] father I pray that every single one of
[1:36:58] us would have the desire in our hearts
[1:37:00] not to persecute but Lord to create such
[1:37:02] an atmosphere in this world around us
[1:37:04] even with the Sinners of this life that
[1:37:06] we could maybe give them an opportunity
[1:37:09] to extend to us some cor some kindness
[1:37:12] Lord maybe a a glass of cold water maybe
[1:37:15] a glass of warm water just something
[1:37:17] kind help us Lord Jesus to create that
[1:37:20] atmosphere to never look at someone and
[1:37:23] Scorn upon them to never have the desire
[1:37:26] to persecute within the church or
[1:37:28] without father let us live by that Grace
[1:37:31] let us look unto you father and see that
[1:37:34] it's only by your grace that we're saved
[1:37:36] through the faith that you put inside of
[1:37:38] us Lord before the foundation of the
[1:37:40] world we love you father we thank you
[1:37:42] for this word we pray that you would be
[1:37:44] with those who are still traveling Lord
[1:37:46] that you would Grant to them traveling
[1:37:47] mercies that you would allow them to be
[1:37:49] a blessing to those people around them
[1:37:51] Father and that you would bring them
[1:37:53] home safely again at the appointed time
[1:37:56] lord we love you and we thank you we
[1:37:58] just commit all things into your hands
[1:38:00] For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:38:02] pray amen
[1:38:05] amen
[1:38:07] amen
[1:38:12] amen I pledge
[1:38:15] allegiance to the lamb I have heard how
[1:38:20] Christians long ago
[1:38:24] were brought
[1:38:27] before a
[1:38:29] Ty
[1:38:31] thr they were told that he would spare
[1:38:37] their lives if they would
[1:38:42] renounce the
[1:38:44] name of Christ So What by one they chose
[1:38:52] to die
[1:38:54] Son of God they would not
[1:39:00] deny like a great
[1:39:04] Angelic

[1:39:44] lamb now the
[1:39:47] years have come and the years have gone
[1:39:53] and the cause of
[1:39:56] Jesus still goes on now our time has
[1:40:03] come to count the ca to reject this
[1:40:10] world to
[1:40:12] embrace the cross so one by one let us
