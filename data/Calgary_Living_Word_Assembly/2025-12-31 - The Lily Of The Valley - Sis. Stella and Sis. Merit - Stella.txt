Description:
I have found a friend in Jesus
He's everything to me
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole
In sorrow He's my comfort
In trouble He's my stay
He tells me every care on Him to roll

CHORUS
He's the Lily of the Valley
The bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul

He all my grief has taken
And all my sorrows borne
In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower
I have all for Him forsaken and all my idols torn
From my heart and now He keeps me by His power
Though all the world forsake me
And Satan tempts me sore
Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal

He will never, never leave me
Nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill
Then sweeping up to glory
To see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll
