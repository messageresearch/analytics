Description:
CHORUS
We're marching to Zion
Beautiful, beautiful Zion
We're marching upward to Zion
The beautiful city of God

Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God
But children of the heav'nly King
But children of the heav'nly King
May speak their joys abroad
May speak their joys abroad

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heav'nly fields
Before we reach the heav'nly fields
Or walk the golden streets
Or walk the golden streets

Then let our songs abound
And ev'ry tear be dry
We're marching through Immanuel's ground
We're marching through Immanuel's ground
To fairer worlds on high
To fairer worlds on high
