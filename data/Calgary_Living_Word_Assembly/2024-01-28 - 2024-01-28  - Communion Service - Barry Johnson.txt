things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians God bless you tonight bless you brother mvin it's good to see you back he was in Lethbridge took the service down there today uh if you have your Bibles I'd like to read from 1 Corinthians chapter 10 start at verse 14 Lord willing I won't really preach tonight just have a few words 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 14 says wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry I speak as to wise men judge ye what I say the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread amen behold Israel after the flesh are not the they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar what say I then that that the idol is anything or that which is offered in sacrifice to Idols is anything but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to God and I would not that ye should have Fellowship with Devils you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you for your leadership and your instruction and Lord Jesus we know full well that we cannot partake of your table and the table with devil devil and we know that there's always a time in our lives where we have to choose this day whom we will serve and father tonight I pray that that would be our prayer that if there's anything in our lives Lord Jesus that we have esteemed greater in any way than your word then father forgive us for it and allow us to go forwards in true communion with you Lord Jesus we just commit all the rest of this service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen bless you tonight you may be seated I just uh think this kind of dovet tales with what we were talking about this morning and we only sort of brushed on it but idolatry is a it's a very big thing and it's a very subtle thing and really basically in a nutshell anything we put before the word of God is idolatry and that can be actions it can be thinking it can be tradition it can be Behavior it can be things that that we do it can be things that we don't do anything that we put ahead of the word of God in our lives is idolatry so I think it's just important for us to remember that you know we can't drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils we can't come to this table for communion and actually follow the ordinance of the Lord and then run out into the world tomorrow and just be worldly people and just do what we normally worldly would do and think that we're going to see a blessing what Happ actually will happen is we'll see a curse that's what will come upon us we have to know where we stand when we come to this table and we also need to know that when we come to this table we're not coming to this table to meet with men you're not coming to meet the deacons we're not coming to meet brother Barry we're coming to actually meet with MDC himself which is Christ Jesus for our day you know out of the service communion in 1962 I've got a pretty long quote that I thought I would just read tonight and and just see what the Lord would do with it and paragraph 111 brother brandham says what do you do you're building up your body to inoculation from the somebody comes in and says oh our church don't believe in shouting see you're built up what you got communion in you the word and you're inoculated from it if a bunch of nonsense comes in what is it it has no word in it then you're sure it's wrong he says I don't care how real it looks if it's not the word leave it alone amen I don't care what it does it must compare with the word he goes on to say in prayer I was quoting Micaiah standing there we know the story of Micaiah it's from First Kings and how um Jehoshaphat was called up by Ahab you know Ahab the king he married Jezebel Ahab was actually born into a a Christian home and we know he was a backslider that's what the prophet said he was a backslider and he realized that the land that the enemy was on was their land uh I believe it was the syrians and so he went up to Jehoshaphat and said hey buddy these guys are on our land why don't we go take it back we know that's our land they don't have any right to it and we know that josephat said you know you're the king so let's let's go and do what you want to do if you think it's okay let's do it and and Ahab said great and he had 400 prophets Ahab brought out 400 prophets and said he said to them brother Bram says these were God prophets too by the way he he said to them should we go up should we go and try and take back ramoth Gilead should we do do that and those 400 prophets those God prophets they said yes indeed go ahead and we know that it's interesting because even though there was 400 of them ahab's prophets josephat he said you know what isn't there one more isn't isn't there anyone else and we know that Ahab said yeah there is there's one more but I hate him because he never prophesies good and the reason he could never prophesy good is because we know that Ahab was completely totally immersed saturated in idolatry through his marriage he had a wife that was completely driving everything and so through that idolatry he didn't like the prophecy that came forward from that one God Prophet but josephat said you know isn't there one more in the land and he said sure I hate him but we'll get him we'll bring him up and we know that they went down they told him his messenger said you come up and you talk and you say what all the other ones are saying and brother bradam says we'll give you your fellowship card back we'll welcome you back into the group group you can be accepted again if you're just willing to buy into our idolatry and we know that he said you know what as the Lord liveth I ain't going to say nothing but what the Lord puts in my mouth it's only going to be the word it's only going to be the truth that's the only thing that's going to come out of my mouth I'm not going to say anything to try and fit in to try and appease anybody but we know um it didn't go well in the end it didn't go well for Ahab because this one God Prophet told him you know what if you come back at all then I'm not actually a prophet of God but brother Bram in this in this quote he says in prayer as I was quoting Micaiah standing there look it looked really right while there was Israel and that piece of land belonged to them those aliens had come in and took it away from them and had built their own houses and they was occupying part of the land that God give them I'm just going to pause there brothers and sisters sometimes death Devils will come in and think that they can actually build houses and inhabit our Promised Land come into our lives come into our families come into our marriages come into our relationships even come into our church and just set up shop they'll build their house they'll establish their place and their squatters on the land they have zero rights to the land and you know we don't have to tolerate it we can actually get rid of the Devils now I'm not saying get rid of the people I'm saying we can get of the devils in the name of Jesus Christ amen when a devil comes into our marriage and tries to stir us up we don't have to tolerate that we don't have to say well that's just their temper and they they just behave this way and you know their dad was that way and their grandpa was that way and their great grandpa was that we don't have to do that we can go on our knees and say I've got a prayer request for my husband I got a prayer request for my wife because there's something wrong it's a devil trying to stir them up we don't have to accept it and whatever the problem is whatever the situation is but talking about this Promised Land brother Bram says those aliens had come in and took it away from them and had built their own houses they was occupying part of the land that God give them they were getting real comfortable weren't they so it looked like those 400 Hebrew prophets was right but you know there was something about Jehoshaphat was spiritual he said haven't you got another one said I got another one but I said I I hate him the only thing he does is prophesy evil isn't it interesting the evil one is saying he only prophesies evil when really he was only prophesying truth he was saying the word of God but the evil one couldn't stand it so to him it was evil said go get him and let's hear him and he went up he said go on go up but I seen Israel scattered like sheep having no Shepherd and he told his vision now who is right it looked like the 400 was right 400 well-trained men you only imagine they were well- trained seasoned message Believers in their day they were part of the organization maybe even founding members they were right right 400 well-trained men saying go up the Lord is with you and even zedekiah zedekiah had a two two big Iron horns built he said by this you'll push the aliens out of the land he was sure he was right he know he was right but you see he was wrong he was under the influence of one of those squatters wasn't he he was under the influence of one of those spirits and he didn't even know it he made a perfect place for him to live and in habit habitation for him I just was thinking as I was reading this it just dovet tales with our our scripture this morning it's not by strength or by mind might brothers and sisters but by my spirit sayeth the Lord am he knowed he was right but you see he was wrong and here Micaiah one against 400 and he said if you go up Israel will be scattered with no Shepherd and the other said go up the Lord is with you now materially they was right the place did belong to Israel but the word of the Lord had condemned Ahab so how could God bless what he had condemned of course you didn't want to hear that prophecy about being condemned who would want to hear a prophecy about being condemned brother bam says there it is today see the word of communion was in Micaiah now if you're communing with God in taking the real communion and the spirit in you disagrees with this word you're not comping with God you're communing with devils and brothers and sisters I want to say one word if we dispute or disagree with one word of this message here's what the prophet says you're not communing with God you're communing with devils and they're so impersonating we know that the Devils love to go to church they love to get polished up they love to call themselves Christian and you know we had 400 God prophets here but one of them had the word of the Lord and they're so impersonating brother Bram says the Bible said in the last days they'd almost deceive the very elected if it were possible but isn't it wonderful praise be to God it's not possible there's only one way that it's not possible brothers and sisters that's to have the Holy Ghost in your life it always goes back to that it always will go back to that right up to the day we walk over and translate our bodies when we're translated into the next next Dimension because that's the only promise for us in Noah's day he had one message get in the boat today we've got one message get the Holy Ghost that truly is it brother Bram goes on to say but heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not and if uh Paul said in Galatians 1 18 if an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel than this that you've already heard let him be ACC cursed even an angel even an angel in the early church when those men like St Martin irius those Godly men when the devil would appear like an angel of Light but you watch he'll be a little off the word you ever meet somebody who is a Believer and there just something just something can't put your finger on it just something it might not be that they have a devil they might just be a different individual idual but it might be they have a devil but you know brothers and sisters it's not up to us to determine whether someone's got a devil and then try and bring them before the church and excommunicate them that's not our mission our mission is to get people to Christ that's our mission but I think it's important to just see what the prophet says here it's very very difficult to tell they're impersonating there's only one way to tell the difference they're off the word how do you tell someone that has the Holy Ghost they're on the word amen that's the difference one is off the word one is on the word he appeared to Eve as an angel of Light told her sure the Lord said this but the Lord said this but he disagreed with God right at the end and that's the way false communion does today when people think they're praying to God and won't obey the word it's a false communion brother and sisters we need to make sure we know where we stand before we come to this table are we following the entire word of God all of the word of God in our lives and you know if you're not sure sometimes it can be a little bit confusing and I don't mean to make it a problem I just want to see that we're all on the right trajectory that's really my job is to see that we're going the right way and if anybody is wrong let's just get right let's just get in line let's shake ourselves this is the time to cross over it's not time to play church amen when people think they're praying to God and won't obey the word it's a false communion and I believe that's idolatry and that's terrible brothers and sisters but we know the word of God says if you abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will see and it'll be done you want to know whether you're actually in line with the word of God just ask the Lord say Lord search me and try me take me and break me and bless the broken pieces of my life that I might be able to be used by you but you know brothers and sisters he can't take and and bless our lives he can't actually see that growth unless he breaks the pieces first according to that song that we just sung you know the fruit doesn't grow on the top of the mountain it grows in The Valleys we've got to be willing to just let the Lord lead us and guide us let him take us to the depths of the valley if we truly believe that he's in charge and he's in control we don't have anything to fear if you abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will see I just don't think there's any better question that we could ask God is for a son and daughter of God for someone who wants to find God to say to him Lord am I in line with your word if I'm not then show me where I'm not with genuine Earnest he'll show you he'll show us for sure he abide in me and my word in you then ask what what you will see and it'll be done now it just can't go one time then off the next ye abide in me my words abide in you that's stay there abide means to rest there stay right there yes it's inoculation from sinful diseases and that is our Sabbath our place of rest isn't it brother bam says now let me close in saying this one word now before we go to the communion table the blood and the body of the Lord mixed with faith that's the blood and the body that's the spirit and the word mixed with faith equals eternal life he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day he says there you are what is it the communion of the Lord the word and the spirit this life is is in the blood the word and the spirit equals eternal life by faith in the Lord goes on to say here's my prayer as I see the end approaching see and see and see at any minute something could happen and know that we're not far off from the coming of the lord lord then in the name of the Lord Jesus the son of God let me take the word The Sword and wave it with what faith I have and cut my way through every demon power till I see Jesus by the communing of his word I just want to encourage us brothers and sisters because we wrestle not against flesh and blood but we're wrestling against principalities and powers and rulers of Darkness of this World spiritual wickedness in high places we're wrestling against Devils but we don't have to wrestle we have the ability to take this sword of the word and the faith of God and cut away all those Devils cut them out I I don't mean to be so blunt brothers and sisters but I think it's real important for us to just sometimes be straight let's let's just be honest and straight we're talking about dealing with Devils here devils want to get in our lives and mix things up they want us to think that we're behaving correctly but if we're one word off we heard it already one iota off is death that's really what it means brothers and sisters that's what happened to Eve in the Garden of Eden and it's going to be the same thing for us today we cannot think that we can mix any thought any idea any tradition any other Behavior except for the word of God take him at his word and we will end up right brother bradam says commune with his word if ye abide in me and my word in you then ask me what you will and it'll be done for you we have to abide in him but we also have to take his word and have it abide in us we know that John was instructed to take the little book and he it up it'll be sweet as honey in your mouth but it'll make your belly bitter this flesh doesn't want nothing to do with this word it can't happen this word this flesh is a hybrid flesh but we know that the spirit of God in us will allow us to rise above all of the confusion all of the frustration all of the upset stomach from this word commune with his word if ye abide in me and my word in you then ask me what you will and it'll be done for you how beautiful There's real communion with the word and the spirit with faith to wave it together ask what you will and it'll be done for you let us pray he says and you know brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us tonight get his word in you you abide in him and his word in you then ask what you will and God will do it for you he has to do it for you that's his word and when we remind him daddy that's your word you said you would do that now I've done everything in my life like we talked about this morning to consecrate ourselves go through our lives and see is it according to the word of God if it's not just get rid of it just ditch it just leave it alone just walk differently and see if God won't bless it I I I I I can tell you I I had a transformation in my life the Lord will bless you very quickly when you step towards him he will be there to receive you he won't just let you walk out in the desert Wilderness he won't leave you hanging out to dry what he will do is be there to bless you to show you yes indeed you're taking the right step you're heading the right direction and I'm going to show you that you're heading the right direction with something that you'll be able to understand you'll be able to comprehend it but you know the word of God it's the only absolute that we have it is truly our absolute our Anchor Point and if we just if we just continue to do the same thing over and over and over brothers and sisters hoping for a different result when we need a different result without making a change in our life that's a definition of insanity we know that let's just take a step maybe one little step you know when you shoot a gun Lord willing sometime we'll be able to show this we'll demonstrate it out our house when you shoot a gun if you just move a little bit sometimes if you just breathe sometimes holding the gun your heartbeat is just enough to move the gun off just a little teeny bit off when you shoot the gun is a long ways off at the Target and it's the same thing with us spiritually we need to make sure that we know exactly we're on target we're zeroed On Target because when that time comes to hit the target we want to hit the bullseye we don't don't want to be in the outside Rings we want to be right dead center and we will be brothers and sisters if we have his word God richly bless you tonight I know we're going to have some testimonies so I don't want to preach tonight I just want to try and encourage us remember this scripture 1 Corinthians 10 verse 21 ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils it's pretty straight and it's pretty strong but but you know brothers and sisters this isn't an age to have uh uh a soft religion a soft religious experience this is the time to recognize who we are and what we're raised up for and and our our our ability brothers and sisters is to shine forth not be trampled down by Devils but to actually have Devils Under The Souls of our feet to go forwards and know that we will be more than conquerors so God richly bless you tonight I just want to move on to the next portion of the service now I'll just just call uh maybe Lisa up to play the piano we'll uh read the scripture read the scripture for uh communion service as we progress here and we can just flip the page it's 1 Corinthians chapter 11 maybe stand with me as we read the word starting at verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this is this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come just want to read verse 27 one more time as we consider this brothers and sisters wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord we might say we never crucified Jesus but the word of God says that if we're willing to do this unworthily we have things in our lives that aren't fixed that are just loose the problem problematic we're drinking and eating unworthily and what happens is we eat and drink damnation unto ourselves and that's not a a nasty car accident necessarily the word of God says that many are weak and sickly among you and it's not weak in strength brothers and sisters it's weak in faith let's examine ourselves and let's eat and drink of this table worthily tonight let's just t one for another before we proceed gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight I believe there's a room full of full of people examining themselves it's an Earnest desire Lord to eat and drink worthily and father tonight we just ask that you would allow
