the glory Jesus love you we thank you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ amen thank you sister Michelle for a wonderful special I think she actually heard what was on my heart to speak from tonight if you'll turn with me in your Bibles to John Saint John chapter 6. even if we wanted to we could never put ourselves here Saint John chapter 6 we'll start reading with verse 47. it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me have everlasting life amen I am the bread of life your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead here we have Jesus talking in the temple to the most religious people of the day your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderness and are dead this BR this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove amongst themselves saying how can this man give his flesh to then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me shall he live by me this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat Manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things saith he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them do this offend you what and if ye shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not where Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him walked and walked no more with him then said Jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Tonight We Believe Lord and that's why we're here but father we just pray that you would speak to us as we've said already just one more word father just one more time lord just a little bit of inspiration to help us go just a little further down this road and father we'll be careful to give you all the praise we ask that you would just bless the remainder of this service now in Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated try not to keep us too long I thought I would try something different and use this microphone here I'm not really used to it I might just grab one of these ones foreign is this okay it's working all right tonight I just want to talk about communion I want to talk about this uh this story a little bit I just think there's so many things in here at the beginning of it he says unto them that he that believeth on me half everlasting life John 6 47 and right at the end of it isn't it interesting verse 69 and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God is that what we have here who we have here tonight in the midst we have Believers here in the church that believe that he is the Christ the son of the Living God I just I I think it's amazing when we look at this because we know that Jesus wasn't talking about them being a vampire but we know brother Branham brought it out very clearly that that's what they thought oh this man's a vampire obviously it's a terrible thing in in in the Hebrew Customs to deal with blood and to deal with flesh of a dead man I mean how could you eat the Flesh of a man that was alive he would have to be dead and if you touch a dead man you have a cleansing period and then to eat it drink the blood it was just an offense for him to say that to him but he was saying it with intent it was a very intentional saying because I believe tonight he was then he was speaking about tonight he was talking about a time where there could be an observance of his body and you know in the in the message communion brother Branham brings it out in 1965 1212. it's one of the last messages that brother Branham preached it's it's very interesting first he teaches leadership and uh it's interesting because if we can't be led we've said it before then there's no communion if we can't have leadership in our lives of the Holy Ghost there's no communion if we can't follow the word of the Lord for our day then we're not having communion we can think intellectually that we're having communion with the Lord but if we're not following the word then we're following a god of our own imagination and that's not a good place to be But Here We Are Tonight amongst the Believers isn't it wonderful to think that we are truly following the word of God we would fit that verse 69 and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God what an amazing thought that is to think that we are sure that he is that one we're staking our lives on it we're staking our families on it we're staking our businesses on it everything that we do in our lives is hinged upon this thought we are sure that he is that one what a tremendous thought that is out of communion uh 65 12 12. brother Bradham says now I do believe that communion or what we call communion now is to talk is the Lord's Supper many times uh people would say that I had heard it before and I thought wow the Lord's Supper that was somewhere in in Jerusalem wasn't it where he had the 12 disciples but that's what we do when we observe communion we're actually taking part in that last supper in the Lord's Supper he goes on to say now we only have three physical Divine orders left to us one of them is communion feet washing water baptism that's the only three things imagine that it's pretty simple isn't it if you think about how the Hebrews were given the law that was not simple that was very complicated and I I wonder if very many of them could keep the law entirely I don't think anyone could keep the law entirely and it was set up that way on purpose people could keep most of the law and and some of them were extraordinary and could keep almost all of it but they still had something inside of their heart that wasn't right but here as Gentiles we've been given three physical Divine orders left to us one of them as communion feet washing water baptism that's the only three things that's the Perfection of the three see and that's the only three orders we have we realize that that was the issue given by Saint Paul in the New Testament now if we would say the communion should just be taking the word I don't believe anyone has a right to take the Lord's Supper until he has taken the word of the Lord into his heart see because I'm going I'll read something for you in a few moments and you'll see now notice then why then would we we would on the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army they do not believe in any form of water baptism said we don't need it now if we don't need water baptism why are we baptized said the water can't save you but the blood saves you I'll agree with that that's right the blood saves you not the water but we must take the water as an outward emotion of an inwardly work of Grace has been done see so must we on communion many times we have heard it said you can see the church full on Sunday morning but come Sunday night when it's communion time the church is empty I want to say God bless you because the church is almost full tonight and we didn't harp on communion this morning it's wonderful because it's a desire in the heart of the believer to come and follow the ordinances that God has given us so must we on communion it's beautiful because it's truly an outward expression of the inward work we can get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and for the remission of our sins and we can follow that ordinance but sometimes it can be difficult to come to the communion table I want to say brothers and sisters don't let the devil rob you of the blessing of coming to the communion table Satan will say oh you've got this thing in your life maybe there's this thing maybe you shouldn't have done this or you should have tarried you should have gone to that brother or that sister and made that thing right do that go and make that thing right but run to the communion table don't let anything stop you from it there's a major blessing in store and you know it might not even be something that we can tangibly understand maybe there's going to be a severe spiritual attack on your children tomorrow morning when they go to school but because you chose to come to the communion table and partake in the Lord's Supper the body of Jesus Christ following the instructions where all the Jews were offended by him because you chose to follow him you could be fortifying your life fortifying your family fortifying your home that's why we say there's so much more blessing in store for those people that tithe I don't want to pull on tithing I think we'll probably have our Treasurer come and do a presentation about tithing somewhere in the near future but brothers and sisters the blessing isn't about money that's only a small portion the blessing is all about the the blessing of God having Jesus Christ in your life every single place you go when you apply the token to your life Remember full obedience to the entire word of God entitles you to the Token not most of the word of God the entire word of God he goes on to say when we have taken the Lord our sacrifice into us as a matter of spiritual birth into us and his body we live by him by the word we also should symbolize it because it's a commandment repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins Paul said I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this do in remembrance of me can you imagine what they must have thought when he was telling him that this do in remembrance of me he they must have been thinking truly this guy maybe is a vampire maybe some of the murmuring we heard by these most religious people could be true because he's not stopping with this first he said it in the temple and now we're having supper with him and he's doing it again he's saying take this and eat this this flesh this is a bread is my flesh what this do in remembrance of me for as often as you take this bread you show forth his death till he comes now we find out that in that they had people who come and we have the opportunity tonight brothers and sisters to come to follow the instruction of the Lord to follow the ordinance that he's given one of the three two of the three actually sorry we've all been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for their mission of our sins if you haven't I strongly recommend that you do and I I would recommend that you don't come to the Lord's table until you have done that do that first and then come to the Lord's table and that's what we instruct the children to do I think that many parents have sometimes a little bit different view on that and I wouldn't want to step on anybody's toes or or ever Implement my own thoughts on how you should raise your children you do that according to the Holy Ghost leadership in your life that's what I would say but as for us in our home we have told our children you can't come to the communion table until you first are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and by following the ordinances of the Lord I guarantee you you'll get the Holy Ghost and you know what I would say this if you want to actually follow the ordinance as you potentially already have the Holy Ghost or you wouldn't want to but the Branham goes on to say in communion now when we take this communion it isn't just the thing say I'm coming up here and going to eat some bread and I'll believe I'm a Christian but if you notice the Bible said he that eateth and drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of the blood and the body of the Lord that makes it pretty heavy that makes it really serious it gets really sobering really quickly when you look at that I just love the way brother Bradham says it here and you know I kind of half wanted to play this whole service communion service tonight but I didn't want to take too long so I figured I would just cover some of the highlights but he says you don't want to you don't want to do this you don't want to eat and drink unworthily you'll be guilty of the blood and the body of the Lord he says see you've got to live a life that before the people that before God and the people that shows you are that you are sincere so it's not just coming to the communion table and saying bless God I believe the message of the hour I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I I follow all of the message of the hour and I just come and I take the communion bread and I I drink the communion wine and I go back to my seed and everything is good but yet I'm living a life that's a double standard that's something extra to what the word of God shows don't want to do that we want to be edifying the Lord we want to be living a life worthy of the Gospel so that not just we feel it the people around us who are the closest to us they witness that because it's pretty easy to be polished up I'll say polished up I don't polish up well but I'll say polish that we can be polished up in public when we go to church when we go to work when we go to school oh my but who are we want to be behind closed doors when it's just us and our family or or just us alone who are we in that circumstance that's who we really are that's the real you that's the real me when we're in private brother Branham says you want to show that you are that sincere and you know we know talk is cheap but I want to say this sometimes in our lives we can have circumstances that maybe cause us to act a certain way maybe we've had something happen to us that's really hurt us in our life that can cause us to act a certain way somebody could say something to us a certain way and it will cause us to react a certain way because of a deep down hurt that's inside of us now I don't want to get psychological tonight but I want to say it this way sometimes we have human nature that human nature gets in the way how many times should we forgive one another I think it's Point what is it four four seven or four nine times a minute we broke that down it's it's it's a lot of times so many times that there's no way that we could ever not forgive someone in our lives and that's pretty hard but you know what it takes to do that not human kind we can't do that on our own that takes the spirit of Jesus Christ Living out through us that's the Holy Ghost only that will give us the ability to overcome sometimes we deal with The Human Condition I don't want to act like I'm pretending like it's it's it's Pie in the Sky here we're human beings living in this world and we sometimes we make a mess of things but you know what the believer does the believer goes and makes it right the believer doesn't just let it fester and come to the communion table and say hey I'm a Christian you know everything's fine I'm out there no no no no no when that happens brothers and sisters you're eating and drinking damnation potentially you're doing it unworthily we need to just make it right and then we'll unlock the power of this of showing God that we believe he goes on to say you don't take the Lord's Supper by a tradition if you're doing it by a tradition don't do it by a tradition I don't want to say if you're doing it by a tradition and you've always done it by a tradition don't come up here tonight and do it by a tradition I want to say just throw that tradition out and come up here tonight and do it under maybe a new revelation that you're actually partaking of the Lord's body because I've said it before I'll say it tonight who is actually serving the communion tonight if these brothers here have the Holy Ghost In Their Lives who is actually serving you this Lord's body and when we go to wash feet in the in the foot washing portion of it whose feet are you really washing and who is actually washing your feet it's not just human beings here you don't take the Lord's Supper by a tradition you take it because of it's the love of God in your heart keeping the Commandments of God see that's what you take it for so if you so you don't take it in so if you don't take it in sincerity just it's a tradition well our church observes communion once every Sunday or once every month or twice a year and you go up say well it's my time and then take the communion why it's a stink to God see that's just a tradition even like anything else you've got to be sincere God wants the depths of your heart remember the very God that brought you here on Earth is the one you're serving see you're doing this because he said so because it's his order then we want to come up with deepness of sincerity knowing that by God's grace that we have been saved and we love him and we field his presence anybody feel this presence tonight with the specials that we heard with with the songs that were sung we see that it changed our lives our whole being is changed we're different people we don't live like we used to we don't think like we used to we know that Paul said when I was a child I I thought as a child and I lived like a child and I did childish things but when the spirit of Christ started to take hold in my life and that see Gene of God got watered by the word for my day and started to grow a maturity started to take hold in my life and the things which I once did as a child I no longer did I put them aside because I'm no longer seeing through a glass Darkly but face to face my goodness brothers and sisters that takes it to a whole new level we're not just coming to church to come to church we're coming to church to fellowship with that one that we know is the Christ that that one that we believe and are sure of that is the Christ the son of the Living God my goodness when we can get that Revelation in our hearts it just gives us the ability to worship freely it gives us the ability to push aside the cares of this life and say no there's one thing that I want to do and that is to go to church because that's where my blessing lies that's where the true blessing of the Lord is now some people might argue and say you could just play a tape and I believe that there's a blessing in the tape but we know that there's a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints and we can't change the word of God we don't want to try and manipulate that I don't want to go too far with that tonight he goes on to say then when we come to the Lord's table we must come in reverence love and respect reverence love and respect and I say that tonight and I just want to say it this way I think it could be easy to just say we want to come in reverence of the Lord in love for the Lord and respect for the Lord but how will the world know that you love me how will the world know that you love me when you've got love one for another when you've got respect one for another when when you have reverence one for another because you recognize the spirit of Christ in your brother and in your sister and maybe you can actually see it entirely but brothers and sisters the prophet of God said we'll never live above our confession so let's confess that that's our brother and our sister in Christ Jesus and not just someone that we associate with at church but truly the manifested word for our day right here in the young people sitting in the front row right there in the old people sitting in the back row I know you're not that old but you know what I'm saying then when we come to the Lord's table we must come in reverence look love and respect of look where we would have been if it hadn't been for him see look where he would have been he says I think it's just amazing because that's the song we heard isn't that wonderful that's the Lord he goes on to say that's the trouble of us today what I I think I'm saying us me and the church that the Lord God has let me speak to in these last hours that we believe were in the closing time we believe that God has given us a message it's being ordained of God it's proven of God it's been showed of God now we must come to him with reverence and love and with purity of heart and mind and soul we don't come to the Church of of the Living God and just come in as a tradition just drag our carcass in and do our duty and leave it's a stink in the nose of God when we do that but I want to say if that's all you got still come why do I say that I'll say it because you get Washed by the Water of the word and if you don't come to church you're going to keep that stink but you know we need to make sure that we've got the right attitude and I think it's beautiful that we have the prophet of God saying these words because he's wanting us to line up with the word to make sure that we have the right attitude again I'll say it brothers and sisters don't ever let the devil rob you of the blessing of this communion table don't ever let them do it because if something happens in our lives and we say I can't come to the communion table it's not because God's saying stay away from the communion table he said come and eat take eat this is my body do this in remembrance of me he didn't say oh don't eat it because you've got a bad attitude because something happened he said come and do it so we need to do the work we need to do the harder work to make sure that we can come and do it he goes on to say you know the hour will soon arise when the when right Among Us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in honest ananias and Sapphira does everybody remember that story I won't go too far into it but the discernment of the Lord was in the people and they were able to discern what these people were doing these people were claiming to be Believers but they just held a little bit back they were just call them a little bit cheap they were a little bit tight with their money they figured you know what I don't have to give it all I can keep a little bit for myself and instead of actually following the leadership of the Lord which was the instruction of the Prophet for the day what they did was they just got a little tight wad with their money and and it cost them both their lives both of them died because they said you know oh we did everything right we did exactly what we're supposed to do and we know they said to him this is the Holy Ghost said to them are you sure you did and again they lied and you know they died for it but brother Branham is saying here there will come another time with ananias and Sapphira it's on the way remember see that hour is arriving see and we are now you just remember that see that God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now I think it's so beautiful he's talking about this in the communion service talking about coming to this table recognizing this is the spirit of the Living God we're talking about this is the Lord Jesus Christ's body we're talking about it's not just a tradition or something that our parents tell us to do so we do it we've just done it all our lives so we just go and do it this is serious business ananias and Sapphira it was life or death and you know what happened they chose death because they wanted to be deceitful we don't want to be deceitful we know the word of God says to let a man examine himself don't examine your brother and your sister examine himself Dig Down find out if there's something in there and if there is just make it right that's all and you know if you go to make it right and someone won't allow you to make it right that's not on you anymore because you followed the word of God if they choose to actually not forgive then you know who's ever sins you remit they're remitted but whoever sins you retain uh oh someone's gonna keep them goes on to say now we know it's right but see don't do it from an intellectual standpoint if you do you've got a second hand religion see if we're doing it from our minds it's just because someone said to do it but when we can do it from our heart we recognize that's what God said to do and there's a blessing in store a big blessing in store he says if you do you got a second-hand religion see we don't want a second-handed religion something that somebody else has experienced it and we are living off of their testimony we don't want that remember I've said it before we know that brother Branham said that you can have the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and still go to hell how can that possibly be I would say this because you have a second-handed experience because you haven't met him for yourself but when you truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost what happens is you follow the word of God at all costs nothing will stand in your way from being completely obedient to the word of God we don't want to have a second-handed experienced brothers and sisters we want to have a first-hand relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ isn't it wonderful to think we we could try and try and try maybe we could set a challenge and see who in the group here could actually get an audience with Justin Trudeau maybe it would take a day a week a year a month 10 years to get an audience maybe never I would think probably likely never unless we're connected somehow right but yet we have a direct line all we have to do is actually clear our hearts and come sincerely and we can talk to the king of the universe the King of Kings and the Lord of lords oh my we can focus our prayers goodness we've been called unto adoption for that purpose what a tremendous opportunity he is I just want to encourage us tonight brothers and sisters we want to take this serious we don't want it to be a tradition we want to make sure that we have full sincerity and reverence and love in our hearts when we come to this communion table maybe stand with me tonight as we change the order of the service we'll have the communion service then we'll uh then we'll actually uh we'll do the testimonies and foot washing but remember it's just because his grace just because he called us before the foundation of the world I'll call you out brother Joel that's okay we'll uh just go to him in prayer after we read here maybe turn in your Bibles with me to First Corinthians chapter 11. if we could when we do the communion we'll sing that song marvelous Grace verse 23 of First Corinthians chapter 11. this is Paul here now Prophet following up with the words that Jesus spoke in the temple that we read in John chapter 6. for I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily Edith and drink his damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat it home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest well I said in order when I come just take a minute or two and tarry one for another and we've said it many times if if there's somebody that needs to talk to somebody by all means this is the time there's no judgment this is actually following the word of God I think that we would be ecstatic to see someone follow the word of God let's just take a minute or two and tarry one for another before we proceed [Music] foreign
