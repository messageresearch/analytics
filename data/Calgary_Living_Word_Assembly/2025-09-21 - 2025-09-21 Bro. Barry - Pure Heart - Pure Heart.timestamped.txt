[6:29] &gt;&gt; We've been out throughout the week.

[8:20] &gt;&gt; we want to thank you for even the
[8:21] instrument that you want to use to bring
[8:23] the word. Oh Lord,
[8:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, may the anointing, oh Lord, King
[8:27] of glory flows even from the pastor down
[8:30] to all of us right here in this

[9:12] the next chapter of our lives. It's just
[9:14] around the corner, saints. It's It's
[9:16] late. It's really late. I was thinking
[9:17] this morning, my goodness. Our our prime
[9:19] minister is just taking sides with
[9:21] Palestine. I thought, man, it's just
[9:23] just hard to fathom. We know that those
[9:26] who bless Israel will be blessed. Those
[9:27] who curse Israel will be cursed. So,
[9:29] here we are in a country that's taken a
[9:31] side against Israel. It's it's uh it's
[9:33] challenging for sure, but
[9:35] &gt;&gt; greater is he that's in me and you than
[9:37] he that is in the world. Aren't you glad
[9:38] for that this morning? There's a blessed
[9:40] time that's coming. Not now. It's
[9:42] coming. Well, there's a blessed time
[9:45] that's coming, coming soon.
[9:50] It may be evening, morning, or at noon.
[9:55] Oh, it's the rapture of the bride
[9:59] united with the
[10:02] Oh, we shall see the king.

[11:31] your savior king?
[11:36] The kingom of this world shall soon be
[11:41] born.

[20:49] rugged cross.
[20:55] [Music]
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts before him.
[21:02] Our Lord, our savior, our king, our
[21:05] master,
[21:07] you mean everything to us, Lord.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; And we gather this morning, Father,
[21:13] question, who are we
[21:15] &gt;&gt; to deserve this privilege? Who are we?
[21:19] That will mean so much to you that your
[21:22] very life will be sacrificed on our
[21:24] behalf.
[21:25] Oh Lord, we say help us, precious
[21:28] savior, not to take this for granted. Oh
[21:30] Lord, we know we are who we are because
[21:33] of what you've made us Lord and we adore
[21:37] you. We appreciate you, Father. We lift
[21:39] up you and we glorify you, Father. And
[21:42] that is why we gather this way in your
[21:44] name, Father, knowing that we come to
[21:46] reaffirm our identity.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; We come to confirm that yes, we are
[21:51] yours and will be yours forever. We
[21:53] belong to you. We believe you. We are
[21:55] living for you.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; And we know we are a people called to
[22:00] show forth your glory in this day.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord, to be faithful. Father,
[22:06] &gt;&gt; we thank you again for the opportunity
[22:08] to gather in your presence this morning.
[22:10] Father, we thank you for the for the for
[22:13] the prayers of the saints and the
[22:16] willingness and desire to serve you and
[22:18] and the bringing of our gifts, the
[22:20] musicians, Father. And everybody
[22:23] surrendering for your purpose, oh Lord.
[22:25] We know, Father, that you are among us,
[22:28] because that is our purpose, Father.
[22:30] Help us not to miss it, oh Lord. All the
[22:33] privileges that come with experiencing
[22:35] your presence, Father, help us not to
[22:37] miss it, Lord. We love you so much,
[22:39] Father. And as we do this other step of
[22:42] of the service, Father, we pray merciful
[22:44] Father, that you'll be with us, oh Lord,
[22:47] that you'll bless every aspect of it,
[22:48] that the monies, the titan offerings
[22:50] that are coming will serve your purpose,
[22:52] oh Lord, those that are given here and
[22:55] those that are giving online, bless it
[22:56] all for your purpose, Lord.

[24:14] Second verse. Sing that second verse,
[24:16] please. Second verse.
[24:20] Second verse.
[24:21] [Music]
[24:22] Then I'm reminded
[24:25] of his words. said, "I'll leave you
[24:29] never more.
[24:34] Just be true and I'll give to you a life
[24:41] forever.
[24:45] I wonder what I could have done
[24:52] to deserve God's only son
[24:57] to fight my battles until they're won.
[25:02] For who am I?
[25:06] Mother Dawn, would you come? Oh, who am
[25:09] I?
[25:11] night a king would bleed and die for.
[25:20] Who am I that he would pray? Not my will
[25:26] but thine glory.
[25:31] The answer I may never know.
[25:37] Oh, why he ever loved me so
[25:43] that it rugged cross he would go for who
[25:49] am I? Have your seats this morning.
[25:56] Amen. Before I read this palm, I just
[26:00] wanted to share something that was on my
[26:02] heart this morning. I woke up and felt
[26:05] compelled to remind people today
[26:08] that the bottom of the steps and where
[26:11] we had the TV and the seats that is a
[26:13] part of the sanctuary. It deserves the
[26:16] same amount of respect and sincerity
[26:18] &gt;&gt; as up here because of the church
[26:21] situation with more people than what our
[26:23] seating can arrange here. That is a
[26:25] please treat it as a part of our
[26:28] sanctuary here. We have the two rooms,
[26:31] the two Sunday school rooms. If you need
[26:32] to feed your children or you need to
[26:34] call somebody, it's not to be done in
[26:37] that area. Please just treat it like the
[26:39] sanctuary here. And I believe the Lord
[26:41] will reward us for it. Amen. I pray that
[26:44] this is a blessing. This poem is called
[26:47] made manifest.
[26:49] Creation waits with groaning voice. The
[26:53] earth in birth pain cries
[26:56] for sons to rise with spoken word and
[27:00] open blinded eyes. Not future hope but
[27:04] present hour.
[27:07] The bride takes up her stand. With
[27:09] perfect word and spirit fool she rules
[27:12] at his command.
[27:14] Hear the testimonies of the end time
[27:17] hour. where mystery meets the plane.
[27:20] Where sons of God arise in strength
[27:24] and Christ is seen again. No longer
[27:27] shadows, types or hints, no fragments
[27:30] left to find. The perfect word, the
[27:33] spirit's flame, hath come to claim
[27:36] mankind.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; They do not walk in borrowed light, nor
[27:41] live by serpent's design. The fullness
[27:44] of the spoken word now pulses through
[27:47] their spine. The seed of God within
[27:50] their soul ignited with holy fire.
[27:53] Not just the longing of the heart, but
[27:57] power to fulfill desire.
[27:59] Each morning when the sun peaks up and
[28:03] breaks the night's retreat, the children
[28:06] of God awake in faith and stand upon
[28:09] their feet. They seized the flesh, this
[28:12] stubborn man,
[28:14] &gt;&gt; and cast him to the floor.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Submit, O body, to the word,
[28:18] &gt;&gt; and serve the Lord once more.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; This power is not from mortal flame, nor
[28:25] courage of the brave. It's by the spirit
[28:28] of the lamb who left an empty grave.
[28:32] The very Christ now living in flesh.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; The mystery long concealed unveiled in
[28:37] sons and daughters here in Calgary.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; In Calgary,
[28:43] &gt;&gt; his glory now revealed.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; No chain of lust, no fear of death, no
[28:48] unbelief can remain.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; For liberty has crowned their walk and
[28:53] circumcised Satan's shame. They tread
[28:56] this world
[28:58] with pre-ordained steps. Their hearts
[29:01] the temple bright, their very bodies
[29:04] testifying of God's eternal light.
[29:07] Hear the prophesying, oh saints of God.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; The prophecy come true. The same great
[29:13] life that conquered sin
[29:16] &gt;&gt; is now living in you.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Not just the wish,
[29:20] but ability to act.
[29:23] The victory's already won. The glorious
[29:25] body made manifest. today, united with
[29:29] the sun.
[29:31] This is really what I want to remind
[29:32] you. As you walk these blackened streets
[29:35] and labor through the darkest of days,
[29:38] you carry heaven in your steps, the word
[29:41] your staff, and stay. For now, the bride
[29:44] is one with him, the mystery complete,
[29:47] the throne of God was in your soul, and
[29:50] the world beneath your feet. Lord bless
[29:52] you all.
[29:53] [Applause]
[30:03] Amen.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Don, for that
[30:05] reminder. Stand with me if you would.
[30:07] Love the gifts in the body. Just uh
[30:10] let's uh sing 206. Word is working
[30:13] mightily as we ask our pastor to come
[30:15] and we'll sing I surrender all as a
[30:18] prayer to the Lord. As our pastor comes,
[30:20] just appreciate that, brother Don.
[30:22] Appreciate the gift the Lord's put in
[30:23] your life. Thanks for sharing it. all of
[30:25] us. It's incredible to put words like
[30:28] that to rhyme and and and and stir your
[30:30] heart and just speak to you just as a
[30:33] little sermonet pretty much in my view.
[30:35] I just really appreciate that, brother
[30:37] Don. Thank you for delivering that this
[30:39] morning. We all appreciate it. I'm sure
[30:41] the word is working mightily. What a
[30:43] confession this morning. We're about to
[30:45] step into the next most important part
[30:47] of the service. That word that we're
[30:48] going to hear is going to work mightily
[30:50] through us provided we open our hearts
[30:52] to him. Let's do that. Let's just be
[30:54] humble before the Lord. May our hearts
[30:56] just be fow ground that that word can
[30:58] settle into and bring forth much fruit
[31:01] for the kingdom. Let's let's do it this
[31:03] morning from our hearts. Well, the word
[31:06] is working mightily in me.
[31:11] Oh yes, the word is working mightily in
[31:16] me.
[31:19] No matter what the circumstance of what
[31:23] I feel or see,
[31:26] the word is working my dream in me. Oh
[31:31] yes, the word is working mighty in me.
[31:38] Oh yes, the word is working mighty in
[31:43] me.
[31:45] Oh no matter what the circumstance
[31:50] I feel
[31:53] the world is working my way.
[32:00] The way it'll do that is I
[32:04] surrender.
[32:06] Oh.
[32:10] Oh. I
[32:12] surrender.
[32:15] Oh, as our pastor comes. Oh,
[32:21] to thee my blessed
[32:26] savior
[32:28] I
[32:30] surrender.
[32:31] [Music]
[32:33] Oh, what's a good universal language of
[32:35] surrender and raise your hands to I
[32:39] surrender.
[32:42] Oh
[32:48] [Music]
[32:58] my god.
[33:03] [Music]
[33:11] Heat. Heat.
[33:13] [Applause]
[33:13] [Music]
[33:30] to me.
[33:35] [Music]
[33:38] I
[33:40] surrender
[33:42] all.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning.
[33:46] Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[33:49] Certainly an honor and a privilege to
[33:51] gather together again in his name, a
[33:54] name above every name. If you have a
[33:57] need this morning, I just would like to
[33:59] invite you to express it unto him by the
[34:02] way of an uplift hand as we go to him in
[34:04] prayer.
[34:07] [Music]
[34:09] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[34:11] this morning we thank you for your
[34:13] goodness. Thank you for your tender
[34:15] mercies to each one of us, Lord.
[34:19] Father, one more time we gather together
[34:21] in your name, Lord Jesus, with an
[34:24] earnest expectation, Father, to hear
[34:26] from you.
[34:28] And we know, Lord Jesus, there's
[34:30] millions, even billions of people
[34:33] gathering together
[34:35] on this day all around the world in
[34:38] varying degrees desiring to seek you.
[34:42] And father, Lord, I pray that this
[34:45] morning we would desire to seek you with
[34:47] a a pure heart, Lord, and clean hands.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Father, understanding that there's only
[34:53] one way, one truth, and one life.
[34:58] And Lord Jesus, though the world would
[35:00] try and present many different avenues
[35:03] and ways to you, you came yourself. You
[35:07] never sent an angel. You came yourself
[35:10] and you taught that there's only one
[35:11] way, one truth, and one life. And unless
[35:14] we're willing to come through you, we
[35:17] will in no wise see the father.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, this morning, we just
[35:22] want to come and surrender all to you
[35:25] &gt;&gt; as we've sung, Lord, that it wouldn't
[35:27] just be a song,
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Father, that it would truly be the
[35:30] desire in our hearts, Lord. That we want
[35:32] to surrender all to you today.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. Oh father and Lord Jesus, we
[35:38] just invite you to have the preeminence
[35:40] that you desire in this service.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to ask Lord that
[35:44] you would meet each and every need that
[35:47] was made known unto you today, Lord, by
[35:49] the way of an uplift hand.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; And Father, maybe there's some needs
[35:53] that just weren't expressed that way,
[35:56] Father, but there's still a need.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; we know that you're aware. And Father,
[36:00] we commit those needs into your hands as
[36:02] well. We're so thankful, Lord, that we
[36:05] have a place. We have a a rock, oh,
[36:09] Father, that we can run to,
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, a tower of refuge in this
[36:13] world that we live in.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; We know it's getting darker day by day.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; But, Father, as this world gets dark
[36:20] around us,
[36:22] &gt;&gt; your life gets brighter and brighter
[36:24] through us.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that, Lord. Father,
[36:28] we just want to ask all these things
[36:30] now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[36:32] Amen.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[36:37] Thank you musicians.
[36:40] If you have your Bibles this morning,
[36:41] I'd like to read a scripture out of
[36:44] Psalms.
[36:47] Psalms chapter 24
[37:06] Psalms chapter 24.
[37:11] We can start with verse one.
[37:16] Says, "The earth is the Lord's
[37:20] and the fullness thereof,
[37:23] the world and they that dwell therein."
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; So many people would try and proclaim
[37:31] that they own the world or a portion
[37:34] thereof and even though naturally
[37:37] speaking they may, the Lord owns them.
[37:40] It's a beautiful thought. Verse two
[37:43] says, "For he hath founded it upon the
[37:46] seas and established it upon the floods.
[37:53] Who shall ascend into the hill of the
[37:56] Lord?
[37:57] or who shall stand in his holy place?
[38:02] He that hath clean hands and a pure
[38:06] heart, who hath not lifted up his soul
[38:10] unto vanity,
[38:12] nor sworn deceitfully.
[38:16] Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[38:19] Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[38:21] your word. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that
[38:24] you came and ministered to us through a
[38:26] vindicated prophet. Lord,
[38:28] &gt;&gt; not through a man that just claimed to
[38:30] have a revelation, but nothing to back
[38:32] it up with.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, a vindicated ministry.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Where even the men of God would claim
[38:40] that this prophet had a relationship
[38:42] with you like nobody else.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that you would bless
[38:47] the reading of your word. We ask that
[38:48] you would break it open to us fresh once
[38:51] again. We pray that Lord Jesus, we could
[38:53] push aside all of our carnality and
[38:56] humanity and just enter into that place
[38:59] where our brother spoke the highest part
[39:01] of the service where Lord, you speak to
[39:04] us and we receive it gladly.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; We just love you and we thank you. We
[39:08] just ask all these things now in Jesus
[39:10] Christ's name we pray.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[39:15] You may be seated.
[39:18] I just want to welcome everyone to the
[39:21] house of the Lord. Certainly wonderful
[39:23] to be here together again.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; In his presence. We had a tremendous
[39:28] weekend last weekend with
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Andrew Glover here and
[39:32] certainly thankful for what the Lord has
[39:35] done and is doing in our brother's life
[39:38] with the injury of his son just after he
[39:42] was here and then his wife needing to go
[39:46] in and have the baby. They did uh they
[39:50] did a delivery of the baby through a
[39:52] C-section because she had high blood
[39:55] pressure because of what happened with
[39:56] the young feller, brother Malachi. And
[40:00] uh it's just the devil, isn't it? It
[40:03] &gt;&gt; is.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Every life comes at the appointed time
[40:06] of the father. But it's interesting to
[40:07] see how the how the our brother had to
[40:10] go through so much there just in this
[40:12] last week. But we're certainly thankful.
[40:14] He has a lot of help around him. And we
[40:16] have uh many prayers going his way.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Just would like to uh welcome brother
[40:23] John Panicker's cousin, Sister Stefina.
[40:26] Is that right? Did I say that correctly?
[40:29] God bless you, sister. Welcome.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; I understand that she was living in
[40:39] Vancouver and has now gone to Edmonton.
[40:41] Is that right? I trust you enjoy your
[40:43] time there, sister. Um, and I understand
[40:46] that uh we have some other visitors from
[40:49] Edmonton here.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, brother David and Sister Terry
[40:54] Blanchfield and their daughters, Sister
[40:56] Andrea and Sister Jasmine and their son
[40:59] Mark.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; I got a text this week. I believe it was
[41:08] maybe last, but uh, Brother David texted
[41:11] me and I believe we met up at the Moose
[41:13] Lake camp a couple years ago and at
[41:15] Moose Lake family camp. It's just a
[41:17] wonderful time of fellowship and
[41:19] certainly thankful to have you with us
[41:21] as well. I trust you feel right at home
[41:23] into the hill of the Lord.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; The question is who shall ascend into
[41:27] the hill of the Lord? Who shall stand in
[41:29] his holy place? And you know John
[41:33] &gt;&gt; the revelator was a type of the bride
[41:36] and after the church ages were preached
[41:39] to John. We know that he was given an
[41:42] invitation in ro or uh revelations
[41:45] chapter 4. He was invited to come a
[41:48] little higher and we know that
[41:50] immediately he was in the spirit. That
[41:53] was his testimony and brother Bradam
[41:56] said it very clearly that we need to get
[41:58] in the spirit first. Unless we get in
[42:01] the spirit we won't understand these
[42:02] things that we talk about. We will not
[42:04] understand the church ages. We won't
[42:05] understand the seals. we won't
[42:07] understand the mysteries and the
[42:08] greatest mystery of all Christ the
[42:11] mystery of God revealed but not just
[42:13] Christ the mystery of God revealed
[42:15] Christ the mystery of God revealed in
[42:17] you
[42:18] &gt;&gt; and in I and that is the greatest
[42:21] mystery of the age in which we live
[42:24] &gt;&gt; the devil didn't believe it
[42:26] &gt;&gt; in the son of god ministry but he said
[42:29] there's going to be a son of man
[42:31] ministry just before the son of David
[42:34] ministry and right now we're living in
[42:36] that little tiny window that brother
[42:38] Mvin shows so clearly on his timeline
[42:41] when he he brings up the timeline on the
[42:43] screen here. There's just a little tiny
[42:45] window of a son of man ministry. And we
[42:49] know that there's scriptures that refer
[42:51] to the son of man ministry. And uh you
[42:53] know we're living in the midst of it
[42:54] right now. But I I just think it's
[42:57] wonderful we read a scripture like this.
[42:58] Who shall ascend into the hill of the
[43:02] Lord? or who shall stand in his holy
[43:06] place. I can't help but think it is a
[43:09] type of a revelation. It's a type of
[43:12] being called a little higher.
[43:14] Excuse me. We know the prophet.
[43:17] I can't remember which one it is off
[43:19] hand, but he said, "I am a man. Woe is
[43:22] me. I am a man of unclean lips." He saw
[43:27] the temple posts shaking. He recognized
[43:30] who he was. And the Lord said, "Who will
[43:33] go?" And something inside the inside of
[43:36] that brother, he said, "I shall go. I'm
[43:40] here.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; I will go." And you know, it takes
[43:44] courage to be able to go. But we can't
[43:47] go unless we have a pure heart.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Unless we have clean hands. And I think
[43:54] that if we really want to hear from God,
[43:56] we have got to be honest with God. And
[43:59] I'm sure that we all are.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want to encourage us.
[44:02] Perhaps there is maybe a little bit more
[44:04] that we could be or do. And and you know
[44:08] this scripture here, it speaks to
[44:09] something that I've been studying on and
[44:11] I'm probably going to get back to it.
[44:13] And and that is it speaks very clearly
[44:15] about it in verse four. The one that
[44:17] will do it is the one that hath clean
[44:19] hands and a pure heart who hath not
[44:22] lifted up his soul unto vanity.
[44:28] Now remember that is exactly what Satan
[44:31] did in the original sin in heaven where
[44:35] the battle started. He was perfect in
[44:38] all of his ways until iniquity was found
[44:42] in his heart. And what was that
[44:43] iniquity? He started to get a little bit
[44:46] of vanity in his mind. He wanted to
[44:49] actually exalt himself. He wanted
[44:51] everyone to exalt him to be just like
[44:54] the most high because he knew he could
[44:56] never be the most high. But we know
[44:59] that's the scripture. He wanted to be
[45:00] exalted up. And I just can't help but
[45:04] think the one who has a soul that's been
[45:06] exalted through vanity. Thinking that
[45:08] something is great when it's not. We're
[45:10] all What did we say a little while ago?
[45:13] Maybe worth $10 now. Brother Brandham
[45:15] talked about 10 cents. I think back in
[45:17] 53 or whenever we talked about that
[45:19] we're not worth very much. We can put on
[45:22] a $1,000 suit and drive a $200,000 car
[45:25] and think we're worth something. We're
[45:27] worth nothing
[45:28] &gt;&gt; outside of his spirit and his character
[45:31] living out through us.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; But he that hath clean hands, he's the
[45:36] one that's going to get into real
[45:38] revelation. the one that has a pure
[45:41] heart that doesn't want to see
[45:43] themselves exalted with vanity in their
[45:45] minds.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; I think it's an amazing thing. We can
[45:48] get vanity and not even know it.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; It becomes what we call a blind spot.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; We can think everything is okay. We
[45:56] believe God sent a prophet. We were
[45:57] raised in the message. Everything is
[45:59] fine. Maybe we just discovered the
[46:01] message and our lives are good. We
[46:02] committed ourselves to God, but we just
[46:05] got that one thing. And you know what?
[46:07] If that one thing isn't dealt with, it
[46:09] will trip us up because we will believe
[46:11] in our own mind that everything is fine.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; This is a day to not play church.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; This is a day to not play message. This
[46:22] is the day that the Lord has made for
[46:24] the truly elect to be called up a little
[46:27] higher in a revelation that angels
[46:29] desired to hear about it. We heard about
[46:31] it on the weekend. prophets and wise
[46:34] men, sages, they desired to look upon
[46:37] the things Daniel, he desired to look on
[46:40] this. And we know that God said, "You
[46:42] know what? It's not for you, Daniel.
[46:44] Just seal it up until the days at the
[46:45] end because there's going to be a people
[46:47] there that I've forordained to be able
[46:50] to receive the word."
[46:52] &gt;&gt; And I think it's beautiful because we
[46:54] can say, "Here we are.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; This is the day that the Lord has made."
[46:58] It's not just a day to go to church and
[47:00] dress up and and feel good for a little
[47:02] while. Well, this is the day that the
[47:03] Lord has made. And we know we're not
[47:04] talking about a day is in a specific
[47:06] calendar day. We're talking about a
[47:08] space of time. That son of man day
[47:11] ministry.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Clean hands and a pure heart.
[47:20] You know, it's mentioned in the Bible
[47:21] four times, a pure heart.
[47:24] And it's mentioned in the message 15
[47:26] times. And I was a little bit taken as I
[47:28] was studying it. You know, brother
[47:29] Random, he he actually prays that prayer
[47:32] that people would actually be able to
[47:34] handle this message, handle the word of
[47:36] God with with with clean hands and a
[47:40] pure heart.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful because
[47:42] the clean hands, I believe it just
[47:45] represents being genuine and honest with
[47:48] the word of God, not being defiled with
[47:51] traditions and teachings and thinking
[47:53] that everything that I know is good
[47:55] enough. That in itself can be vanity
[47:57] that will take us down. We've got to be
[48:00] willing to take everything that we know,
[48:02] cast down all imaginations.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Throw down those strongholds and allow
[48:07] the spirit of Christ to move into our
[48:09] hearts and our souls and minister to us
[48:13] the word that he desires.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; You know, it's a beautiful thing. I
[48:16] think it's just a magnificent thing. The
[48:19] day in which we live, brothers and
[48:20] sisters, no one has ever lived here. No
[48:25] one has ever gone this far before, this
[48:28] close to the rapture of the church of
[48:30] the living God. It's so important for us
[48:33] to know that we are handling this word,
[48:36] this message, this gospel with clean
[48:38] hands and an absolutely genuinely
[48:41] sincere, pure heart.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; I just can't go back and think about I
[48:47] have to go back. I was going to say I
[48:48] can't help but think about I I I can go
[48:50] back and think about the children of
[48:52] Israel being in the the the goan time
[48:55] when all of the miracles had happened.
[48:57] We know that it was so dark in the land
[48:59] almost like it is today where you could
[49:01] feel it. It's almost that dark now,
[49:04] isn't it?
[49:05] &gt;&gt; But there's lights on in Goan, ain't
[49:07] there?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Where the believers are, those ones that
[49:11] have seen the miracles, that have seen
[49:12] the signs, they've seen the wonders, but
[49:14] they don't worship the signs or the
[49:16] wonders. They worshiped the mighty
[49:18] Jehovah that was promised to them to
[49:20] bring those signs and wonders.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; And here we are in the day in which we
[49:24] live. My taking and thinking about the
[49:29] token just like the children of Israel
[49:31] in that day. Have we applied it
[49:33] correctly?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Is it on both of the doorposts?
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; And is it on the lintil? The lintil goes
[49:40] above the door to support everything
[49:42] above it. So we have a clear space to
[49:45] walk in that's safe. Is that token
[49:47] applied? They had to have these thoughts
[49:49] in that day. Is it applied right?
[49:51] Brother Random talks about the children.
[49:53] Daddy, did you apply it right? The death
[49:55] angels coming through. Can you imagine
[49:58] those firstborn? They would have been
[50:00] saying, daddy, is it right?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; I can't think about Isaac would be
[50:05] saying, "Have you done it right? Should
[50:07] we check it again?"
[50:10] As believers in the day in which we
[50:11] live, if we don't apply that token the
[50:13] right way, if we're doing it through
[50:14] vanity, if we're doing it through a
[50:17] blind spot, if we're doing it through a
[50:19] traditional teaching, it might not be
[50:21] right.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; I just feel so impressed to check it up.
[50:25] Brothers and sisters, make sure we're
[50:27] checking that token with clean hands,
[50:30] with a pure heart.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Our children's lives depend on it. Our
[50:38] marriages depend on it.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; My our church depends on it.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Our salvation,
[50:48] it depends on it.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about eternal
[50:52] salvation. I'm talking about the
[50:53] salvation of the rapture
[50:56] because that's where we're at. That's
[50:57] where we're looking for.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for the promise of a a
[51:01] coming Messiah. We're not looking for a
[51:02] seventh angel, an eighth angel. We're
[51:05] not looking for a messenger to come
[51:06] around.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another great
[51:09] ministry. We've got it all.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. But you know,
[51:19] Brother Brandom, he talks in the
[51:20] message. It just I I trust it's okay. We
[51:23] can go this way today. I have to go with
[51:24] the leadership of the Lord. And he
[51:26] preached some messages which I think are
[51:28] are really interesting. One of them is
[51:30] why people are so tossed about.
[51:35] Why are people so tossed about? Usually
[51:38] people are tossed about because they're
[51:40] not in a single opinion. They're caught
[51:44] between two differing opinions. And you
[51:47] know, I think about it from a from a a
[51:50] religious standpoint or a maybe a a a
[51:53] spiritual standpoint, however we want to
[51:55] call that. I think about it this way. We
[51:58] can be holding on to the old and saying
[52:00] this is the traditional teachings and
[52:02] this is what we've always done so it
[52:04] must be right. It it's got to be
[52:05] correct. If we all did that with what
[52:07] our parents taught us, would we even be
[52:10] able to understand what we understand
[52:11] today? I don't know.
[52:14] The message for today we could say is
[52:16] exactly the same as it was then
[52:19] &gt;&gt; whenever that was. But is it? Because
[52:22] it's not their message. It's got to be
[52:25] my message. Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; This isn't about a group message. This
[52:30] is about an individual affair. We know
[52:32] that brother Brandham said very clearly
[52:34] that God deals with Israel as a nation.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; He deals with a gentile church as
[52:40] individuals.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; So, we're not talking about mom and
[52:43] dad's revelation today. We're talking
[52:45] about my revelation today.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And you know, you can check it up and
[52:49] see if my revelation is right or not.
[52:52] There's only going to be one right and
[52:54] that's according to the word of God.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; We're having a conversation on uh
[53:00] Saturday, yesterday. We're talking about
[53:01] the word of God and what a blessing it
[53:03] is to know that we have an absolute
[53:05] absolute
[53:07] &gt;&gt; absolute is the word of God. We're not
[53:09] interested in trying to to make excuses
[53:11] for it to say that it was for a
[53:13] different age, for a different culture.
[53:15] We know the devil has crept into the
[53:17] framework of the Christian church and
[53:20] caused it to to alter it and just change
[53:23] it and take out some scriptures and just
[53:25] alter some words. You know, that's his
[53:27] tactic. It's exactly what he did in the
[53:29] Garden of Eden, isn't it? Thou shalt not
[53:32] surely die. One word caused the fall of
[53:35] mankind
[53:36] just because of reasoning.
[53:38] Brother Brandham says it just because
[53:40] Eve had a little bit of vanity in her
[53:42] mind. She thought, "My, it does look
[53:44] appealing, doesn't it?" She desired
[53:47] something different than what her actual
[53:49] headship had to offer. And it's
[53:52] interesting because some people throw
[53:53] off and say that Adam's a bad guy
[53:56] because he let her do it. He stood by
[53:58] and didn't, you know, intervene. But
[54:01] what did he do? Adam, he loved her so
[54:03] much that he stepped out of his first
[54:05] estate. He stepped out of eternity for
[54:08] his bride because he loved her. Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham, he preaches this
[54:12] message. Why are people so tossed about?
[54:14] I I just I just think it's a beautiful
[54:16] description about why people maybe they
[54:19] don't have clean hands, maybe they don't
[54:20] have a pure heart because they're caught
[54:22] between two opinions. The only way
[54:23] you're going to be able to make a
[54:25] decision, brothers and sisters, be able
[54:26] to just wholly completely decide you're
[54:29] going to do something and then do it.
[54:30] And I know we're preaching to the choir
[54:32] today, but I I I know when I preach
[54:35] stuff like this, brothers and sisters
[54:36] are preaching to me. I don't want to
[54:38] have something lingering in my life
[54:40] that's going to hold me back. I'm going
[54:41] to go back to it. I want to know the
[54:43] tokens applied correctly in my life.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Have I got clean hands?
[54:50] Do I have a pure heart? You know, I
[54:52] talked to brother Jeff Paige who is at
[54:54] work and you're probably listening this
[54:56] morning, brother. God bless you out
[54:58] working in the field as a welder and and
[55:01] we talk about the tests that happen. He
[55:05] can't just go and weld something, the
[55:07] metal, and then just pass it off and
[55:10] say, "Great, pay me, and now I'm going
[55:11] to run my way." He does. That does
[55:14] happen. But first, there's actually a a
[55:16] test that he has to pass. And it's not
[55:18] just a certification to get that job.
[55:21] Even though there are certification
[55:22] tests you have to do, he actually gets
[55:24] tested on every single job that he
[55:26] welds.
[55:29] They take an X-ray machine and they
[55:31] X-ray it and it goes right down deep
[55:33] into the the innermost parts of it and
[55:36] it shows if there's any flaws and we
[55:38] talk about it about how he's going to
[55:41] get his X-ray and is he going to pass
[55:43] the test and I say I feel the same way
[55:45] when I'm going to stand behind the
[55:46] pulpit. I'm going to get my X-ray. It's
[55:48] going to happen to me. I've got to have
[55:51] clean hands and a pure heart.
[55:56] But why are people so tossed about?
[55:58] Because they're not completely given
[56:00] over. They're not 100% sold out to the
[56:05] word of God. They haven't actually
[56:07] accepted completely the token for their
[56:10] day. And that's why people get tossed
[56:13] about. And sometimes sometimes it's
[56:16] because of what people do to us. We
[56:18] heard about it on the weekend. I thought
[56:20] it was astounding to hear it again. But
[56:23] sometimes ministry are actually wolves
[56:26] in in sheep's clothing. And their desire
[56:28] isn't actually to help the people. It's
[56:30] to have a comfy position. A a an image
[56:34] of prestige. That vanity that we were
[56:36] talking about, to have people esteem
[56:39] them and and to have an image. What a
[56:42] place to live.
[56:44] But you know, sometimes those guys, they
[56:46] do severe damage to people and it causes
[56:50] wounds. And I couldn't help but think
[56:52] about it when we were hearing it a
[56:53] little bit earlier that it goes maybe
[56:55] even a little bit beyond. And I'm not
[56:56] trying to correct Brother Andrew, just
[56:58] trying to chip into it. Sometimes it's
[57:00] actually scar tissue and you can't just
[57:03] erase it,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:05] &gt;&gt; You can't just scrub it off and it
[57:07] doesn't just soften up with warm water
[57:09] and Epsom salts. Sometimes it's actually
[57:11] scar tissue and and you feel it for the
[57:14] rest of your life. And and I can give an
[57:16] example. When I was a blind shoe
[57:18] cobbler, and I mean spiritually blind, I
[57:20] have my eyes, but I was a shoe cobbler.
[57:22] One time I had a knife and I was cutting
[57:25] the threads on a sole on a boot and and
[57:27] I was holding the last and I was coming
[57:29] around with this knife and it was
[57:30] binding up and it was making me angry
[57:32] because I wanted to get going and I just
[57:35] leaned into it and it finally let go and
[57:37] the knife stopped right in the end of my
[57:39] finger. Went right into the bone. Just
[57:42] boom. Maybe too much info, but I want to
[57:45] tell you what happened from it was the
[57:48] wound healed up. There's nothing no scar
[57:50] even. You can't even see anything there.
[57:52] But if I take my finger and I push down
[57:54] and I roll it the right way on the bone,
[57:58] it'll make the hair curl on the back of
[58:00] my neck. It hurts so bad because it's
[58:02] scar tissue right on the end of the
[58:04] bone. Spiritually speaking, that happens
[58:06] to people.
[58:09] And when that gets poked or pushed or
[58:12] touched just the right way, it is such a
[58:15] painful experience.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; And we can't even fathom how painful it
[58:20] is. Many times I do it and I'm like, I
[58:22] can't believe how painful that is. Even
[58:24] today,
[58:26] 30 years later, I'm like, "Wow,
[58:29] how much more to people, children of the
[58:32] living God, the bride of Jesus Christ,
[58:34] when they're mistreated by ministry."
[58:37] &gt;&gt; But you know, sometimes that happens and
[58:40] and the people, it's amazing
[58:43] how resilient
[58:46] &gt;&gt; those old soldiers are, those ones that
[58:48] have been mistreated, those ones that
[58:50] have
[58:51] &gt;&gt; probably pounds of scar tissue. how
[58:54] they've been mistreated, but yet they
[58:55] still get out of bed and come to church.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; I have the utmost respect for those
[59:00] people who have had gone through those
[59:02] experiences. But you know, the children,
[59:04] the ones that the devil is really coming
[59:06] for, they see that happen and they
[59:08] think, "Why would I ever serve a God
[59:11] that would have a ministry that acts
[59:13] that way, that behaves that way? Might
[59:15] as well eat and drink and be married,
[59:17] you know, even in the message and just
[59:19] go and and live life. It's a terrible
[59:22] thing, but that's why people are so
[59:23] tossed about because they just haven't
[59:25] really been able to get beyond whatever
[59:27] it is in their life. Maybe they're
[59:30] caught between two opinions. Maybe they
[59:31] just haven't completely given over to
[59:33] this idea of the message or whatever it
[59:36] is. You know, I've I've said it before
[59:38] and and and some people don't understand
[59:40] it or can't even really take it. But you
[59:43] know, you need to come to the place. You
[59:45] do need to come to the place where with
[59:46] this message of the hour, I would say
[59:48] this message of the hour with Jesus
[59:50] Christ. But and I know the message
[59:53] doesn't save you. But the message is
[59:56] going to take you to the hill of the
[59:57] Lord that we talked about. The message
[59:59] is going to give you the ability to have
[1:00:01] a completely pure heart. It's going to
[1:00:03] give you the ability to have completely
[1:00:05] clean hands because the message isn't to
[1:00:07] the whole world.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; It's to the truly elected of God. Yeah.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; And they're the ones that are called
[1:00:13] onto that holy place. They're called
[1:00:15] into the holy hill is what the scripture
[1:00:17] says. Who's going to be able to ascend
[1:00:19] into the holy hill? Not just onto it.
[1:00:22] Many people are able to climb all over
[1:00:25] it, but not really get inside it, but a
[1:00:28] very select few people.
[1:00:30] But the caught between two opinions.
[1:00:32] Should I really trust that this man of
[1:00:34] God didn't fall off on his doctrine?
[1:00:36] Should I really trust that it's actually
[1:00:38] going to be okay to just follow this man
[1:00:42] and see what his teachings are going to
[1:00:44] bring?
[1:00:46] People are tossed about when they're
[1:00:47] caught between two opinions, two
[1:00:49] differing opinions. My parents say, "Do
[1:00:52] this, but I believe God is showing me
[1:00:54] that and and what God is showing me
[1:00:56] lines up with the word of God and and in
[1:00:58] the message of the hour, and I just
[1:01:00] don't understand it." If that's what's
[1:01:02] going on, you have to follow the word of
[1:01:04] God.
[1:01:06] But why are people so tossed about? The
[1:01:08] prophet preached that message. I'm going
[1:01:10] to I'm going to bring a quote up here
[1:01:11] out of the voice of the sign in 1964.
[1:01:15] And uh I think this one came through.
[1:01:17] Did it come through?
[1:01:20] Amen.
[1:01:21] 1964. The voice of the sign.
[1:01:25] Brother Brandham talking about some of
[1:01:27] the the great ones in the Bible before
[1:01:29] him, the the messengers, the prophets.
[1:01:32] He says, ' Noah, a prophet on the land
[1:01:34] in the land, a sign of the coming
[1:01:38] judgment.
[1:01:40] Moses, a prophet in the land, the sign
[1:01:44] of a coming judgment.
[1:01:46] Elijah,
[1:01:48] prophet in the land, sign of coming
[1:01:52] judgment.
[1:01:54] I just have to pause there and say, you
[1:01:56] know, what does the word of God say in
[1:01:58] the book of Malachi? We have seen
[1:02:02] we have seen the Elijah of of Malachi
[1:02:06] come already. And for anybody that
[1:02:08] doesn't know, I know we all do. I I just
[1:02:10] believe there's someone maybe that
[1:02:11] hasn't seen it or heard it. Take a look
[1:02:13] in the book of Malachi because there was
[1:02:15] a prophet that came and actually
[1:02:17] declared the word of the Lord just like
[1:02:19] Elijah, just like the ones that we just
[1:02:21] read. And and the after the voice came,
[1:02:24] the voice was the sign. What happened
[1:02:27] was judgment came. It's no different
[1:02:30] today. That that that that prophet came,
[1:02:33] he declared the word of the Lord for the
[1:02:35] day in which we live, was taken off the
[1:02:37] scene, and now the judgment is all
[1:02:39] that's left. But before that judgment,
[1:02:42] something really significant happens.
[1:02:43] And that's why we're here today. We want
[1:02:45] to encourage us to that something really
[1:02:47] significant and that is the quickening
[1:02:49] power of the Holy Ghost which will
[1:02:51] change our characters to the word of God
[1:02:54] which will actually cause the rapture of
[1:02:57] the church to go home. That might be a
[1:02:59] little bit far-fetched for some people
[1:03:01] to believe it. But I just can't can't
[1:03:03] get away from that thought. It's the
[1:03:05] Holy Ghost living out through his bride
[1:03:06] because the prophet said when the church
[1:03:08] recognizes what it is. Why didn't he
[1:03:11] say, "Well, the church recognizes who it
[1:03:13] is
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; or when it is." When when the church
[1:03:16] recognizes what it is,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; then the rapture will go.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Because the bride of Jesus Christ will
[1:03:24] recognize her position is not here in
[1:03:26] this land. It's not here on this earth.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Not in the condition that it's in. This
[1:03:31] is not This world is not our home.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; He says, "Elijah, prophet in the land,
[1:03:36] sign of coming judgment." We've seen
[1:03:38] that Elijah in our land which is the
[1:03:41] sign of coming judgment. He says John a
[1:03:44] prophet in the land a sign of coming
[1:03:46] judgment to Israel. They were absolutely
[1:03:49] cut off. Notice sign. What does the sign
[1:03:54] do? The sign is to attract the attention
[1:04:00] and get the church ready.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:04:05] to get the elected ready. There's a
[1:04:08] reason why there aren't millions and
[1:04:10] billions of people
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; following this message of the hour.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Because there needs to be room to make
[1:04:16] excuses for wearing pants, for having
[1:04:19] cut hair, for wearing makeup of any
[1:04:22] sort, of making yourself to behave like
[1:04:26] all of the other people in this world.
[1:04:28] It's okay to listen to rock and roll.
[1:04:30] It's okay to to watch movies like the
[1:04:32] world. It's okay to go and drink a
[1:04:35] little bit, have a little bit of wine
[1:04:37] for the stomach's sake, and maybe sip a
[1:04:38] little whiskey. It's okay to do all of
[1:04:40] that. Maybe just smoke a little stogy
[1:04:42] once in a while. Not very often. Maybe a
[1:04:45] pipe, maybe whatever it is. Maybe even a
[1:04:47] little weed. Whatever. It's okay. The
[1:04:49] world does it. It's legal. We know Paul
[1:04:51] said that all things being lawful,
[1:04:53] they're not expedient.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; They don't direct us to checking up and
[1:04:57] making sure that token is applied
[1:04:59] properly to our homes and our lives.
[1:05:03] But he says, "Not a sign." What does the
[1:05:05] sign do? The sign is to attract the
[1:05:07] attention. It's the bait on the hook. He
[1:05:10] said, Brother Bosworth said it's to
[1:05:12] attract the attention of the people. To
[1:05:14] attract the attention and get the
[1:05:16] elected ready, only a certain group of
[1:05:19] people. And when we talk about the
[1:05:21] elected, I want to say it very clearly.
[1:05:23] If we do get ourselves vaunted, if we do
[1:05:26] get a little bit of vanity in there and
[1:05:28] say that I'm elected, I'm better than
[1:05:30] these other people in the world, we're
[1:05:31] sorely mistaken because it's only by
[1:05:34] grace that we're saved through faith in
[1:05:36] the word of God for the day in which we
[1:05:38] live.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It is a gross error. And that's where
[1:05:42] I'll say the hands aren't completely
[1:05:44] clean. When you start seeing someone, oh
[1:05:47] my,
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; we're elected. We're the message, man.
[1:05:51] You know what? Something's wrong. Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz we should be saying, "Oh Lord, thank
[1:05:55] you. Thank you for calling me. Oh, I
[1:05:58] wish that other people could see this
[1:06:00] message that you've shown me. Oh my." We
[1:06:02] should be sighing and crying for the
[1:06:03] abominations in the land. Is what
[1:06:05] brother Brandham said. That's the second
[1:06:07] evidence of having the Holy Ghost. He
[1:06:09] said, by the way, but he says, "Not a
[1:06:11] sign." What does a sign do? The sign is
[1:06:13] to attract the attention and get the
[1:06:14] elected ready and out of the way before
[1:06:18] judgment strikes. And isn't that just
[1:06:21] exactly what he said all the way along
[1:06:23] in his ministry? Just before one of
[1:06:25] those bombs goes off,
[1:06:28] we can see it all around the world.
[1:06:29] Nations
[1:06:31] are breaking.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Israel's awakening.
[1:06:36] The time that the prophets foretold,
[1:06:40] my goodness, you don't have to look very
[1:06:42] far. You can see it. We're we're right
[1:06:43] on the brink of something really, really
[1:06:46] significant taking place in this world.
[1:06:48] And you know, the whole world knows it.
[1:06:50] Everybody knows it. All of the NATO
[1:06:51] allies are on red alert, ready for
[1:06:54] Russia to try and do something because
[1:06:56] Russia's flexing its power. And it's not
[1:06:58] the USSR. Interesting how the prophet in
[1:07:01] 1933 said the voice told him to watch
[1:07:04] Russia. Watch Russia. Elon Musk is
[1:07:08] striving so hard to get all of the all
[1:07:11] of the satellite stuff going on. You
[1:07:13] know, don't don't think for a second
[1:07:14] that he was there just to be the Doge
[1:07:17] guy and go and clean up government and
[1:07:18] everything. For sure he was in there
[1:07:22] making sure that he was getting all of
[1:07:24] the satellite technology in place, which
[1:07:26] he couldn't do through previous admins,
[1:07:28] so that he could have his his network to
[1:07:30] be able to have all of these
[1:07:32] self-driving vehicles operating. Now,
[1:07:36] why? because a prophet a prophetic
[1:07:39] utterance went forward to say that
[1:07:41] that's actually what's going to happen.
[1:07:43] I was talking to a brother in the US and
[1:07:45] I hope it's okay. There is a major car
[1:07:47] manufacturer in the US where there's
[1:07:50] believers that work for that car
[1:07:52] manufacturer and the believers told the
[1:07:55] management of this company that there's
[1:07:57] actually a prophecy about self-driving
[1:08:00] autonomous vehicles from a vindicated
[1:08:03] prophet. And guess what? The
[1:08:05] administration, they said, "What?
[1:08:09] Come have a meeting with us. We want to
[1:08:10] know more about this." The owners of the
[1:08:13] company, the management,
[1:08:16] people are dialing into this. I can't
[1:08:17] help but think, does does Putin know
[1:08:20] about the prophecy as well? That voice
[1:08:23] that said, "Watch Russia." Don't think
[1:08:25] for a second that governments behind the
[1:08:28] scenes don't have the the enchanters and
[1:08:31] the soothsayers
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; and all of the witches and and warlocks
[1:08:36] and people that advise them. Everyone
[1:08:38] except for God. Right.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; These people are not stupid people.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; They're going to want to know. And we
[1:08:49] know we know full well even
[1:08:51] Nebuchadnezzar, he wasn't a believer. He
[1:08:53] didn't serve God.
[1:08:55] But he believed God,
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; didn't he?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; He heard the prophecy and he went and
[1:09:00] did what he was supposed to do. And it's
[1:09:02] amazing because what did he do? He set
[1:09:04] God's prophet free because he saw
[1:09:06] somebody was there with a pure heart and
[1:09:10] clean hands, willing to serve that God.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Notice the sign. What does the sign do?
[1:09:17] The sign is to attract the attention.
[1:09:19] I'm so thankful that we can say I I'm so
[1:09:22] glad that I can say I'm one of them.
[1:09:24] Someone who's had their attention
[1:09:26] attracted to to to get ready like the
[1:09:29] elected and out of the way before the
[1:09:31] judgment strikes, not after or during.
[1:09:34] Some folks are waiting for a sign to
[1:09:36] happen and then they're going to jump
[1:09:38] into church. It's going to be too late
[1:09:39] then. We're not going to be able to do
[1:09:42] it then. It's got to be now while we
[1:09:44] still can decide.
[1:09:46] He says that's that's what Noah did. Got
[1:09:49] the elected ready, the rest of them. And
[1:09:53] what does it do? The sign. And the voice
[1:09:56] of the sign condemns the unbeliever and
[1:10:00] gets him ready for judgment.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; That's why I believe it with all my
[1:10:05] heart. It can't be vanity in our lives
[1:10:08] to say that I'm a message believer.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; I know God sent a prophet, so I'm better
[1:10:13] than all these people.
[1:10:15] As soon as we start doing that, we've
[1:10:17] missed it. I believe this with all my
[1:10:19] heart. We're getting ourselves ready for
[1:10:21] judgment if we've got that going on in
[1:10:22] our lives.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; My I might get some conversations struck
[1:10:26] up about that one, but I think it's
[1:10:28] important. Let's have the conversation.
[1:10:30] Where do we stand? Who are we? Who are
[1:10:32] we?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Do we recognize that all heaven is going
[1:10:36] to be silent to hear us worship? What
[1:10:38] does that mean?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; I can't get away from that thought,
[1:10:42] brothers and sisters. All heaven is
[1:10:43] going to be all holy heaven is going to
[1:10:46] be quiet to hear us worship.
[1:10:49] Wow.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; What is the sign supposed to do? It's
[1:10:55] supposed to attract the attention.
[1:10:57] And when the attention is attract
[1:10:59] attracted,
[1:11:00] we come to a place of decision.
[1:11:03] we come to a a point of a a crossroads
[1:11:06] in our life where we've got to decide,
[1:11:08] do I keep going straight down this road
[1:11:10] or should I I turn right or to the left?
[1:11:13] What what am I doing here? What what
[1:11:15] what does the GPS say? And you know, we
[1:11:17] could say it this way that the GPS says
[1:11:20] that there's many different ways. When
[1:11:22] you type in an address, you're
[1:11:23] everyone's familiar with it, I'm sure.
[1:11:25] It always shows three different ways to
[1:11:27] get to the same destination. That's fine
[1:11:29] and good on Earth, isn't it? It's fine
[1:11:31] and good when we're driving in a car,
[1:11:33] but it's not fine and good according to
[1:11:35] the scripture, according to the word of
[1:11:36] God. But the devil and the world,
[1:11:38] mainstream Christianity, would say,
[1:11:40] "Well, I can do this and still be saved.
[1:11:42] I I could still be a female preacher
[1:11:44] preaching the word of God. I I I could
[1:11:46] still be maybe a homosexual and and be a
[1:11:49] a minister of of the gospel. What? All
[1:11:53] of these things are completely totally
[1:11:55] against what Paul taught." But yet
[1:11:58] somehow there's an actual excuse for it
[1:12:01] to be okay.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; It's not okay.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And you know there was people in the
[1:12:09] days of Noah that thought they were okay
[1:12:13] even after Noah entered into the ark.
[1:12:15] The crazy man who must have had
[1:12:16] sunstroke beaten up on that wood.
[1:12:18] Brother Brandham talks about him up on
[1:12:20] that hill preaching the gospel for 125
[1:12:22] years. Get in the boat. Get in the boat.
[1:12:23] Get in the boat. It's going to rain. It
[1:12:25] never rained. They were scientifically
[1:12:26] advanced. They could prove it. Shoot
[1:12:28] rockets up into the atmosphere and show
[1:12:30] that there's no rain. Science is not our
[1:12:33] friend, brothers and sisters. The devil
[1:12:35] wants us to think it's our friend. God
[1:12:38] gave it to us for a purpose. But, you
[1:12:39] know, it's the tree of knowledge of good
[1:12:41] and evil. Science is good right up until
[1:12:44] the place it wants to come against our
[1:12:46] faith. And when it starts to combat our
[1:12:48] faith, we need to take science and throw
[1:12:50] it away
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; because it's going to actually take and
[1:12:54] erode our faith. It's going to take us
[1:12:56] away from it. But I I think it's
[1:12:58] beautiful. Notice the sign. Brother
[1:13:00] Brandham, he talks about it. When they
[1:13:02] crawled into the boat, Noah and his
[1:13:04] family, once again, Brother Brandham
[1:13:06] dramatizes this in such a beautiful way.
[1:13:08] The children, they sat for seven days,
[1:13:11] didn't they?
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; They did.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; They waited. It didn't just rain once
[1:13:14] God closed the door. He never closed the
[1:13:16] door. They knocked on the door and said,
[1:13:18] "Let us in, Noah, once the rain
[1:13:19] started." And he said, "I can't do it. I
[1:13:21] never closed the door." Yeah,
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; it's exactly the same type of the five
[1:13:26] wise and the five unwise virgins. Some
[1:13:29] of them went into the feast and and the
[1:13:31] Lord closed the door. The bridegroom
[1:13:33] closed the door. It wasn't them that
[1:13:34] closed the door. But in the ark, the the
[1:13:37] children must have been saying, "Daddy,
[1:13:39] are you sure? They're throwing tomatoes
[1:13:41] at us. They're mocking us. They're
[1:13:44] making fun of us. You can hear them
[1:13:46] hitting the the ark. Who knows what else
[1:13:48] they're throwing at us? They're laughing
[1:13:50] at us. I can hear my friends out there
[1:13:52] mocking us and laughing.
[1:13:55] Are you sure, daddy?
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; And even to the place where mama came
[1:14:00] and said, "Don't you hear the kids? Are
[1:14:02] you sure, Noah? Honey, are you
[1:14:05] positive?"
[1:14:07] We got to be positive.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; We have to know that. We know that we
[1:14:10] know.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] We need to know that we've got a pure
[1:14:14] heart and clean hands, especially as
[1:14:16] husbands and dads
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; because the family's depending on us.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; And you know the trouble with that is
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; unfortunately
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; or fortunately depending on how you look
[1:14:30] at it, it doesn't show up right away. We
[1:14:34] can have unclean hands and maybe not a
[1:14:36] completely pure heart and look just
[1:14:38] fine.
[1:14:39] bring our children to church and live
[1:14:41] our lives and everything will look just
[1:14:43] fine.
[1:14:45] But 15 years down the road, what's the
[1:14:48] life our children are going to leave?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; What are they going to live? How are
[1:14:52] they going to act? Are they going to
[1:14:54] believe that it's okay to be one way at
[1:14:56] church and just a little bit different
[1:14:58] at home? It doesn't matter.
[1:15:00] It's okay to miss a Wednesday night
[1:15:02] service. It doesn't matter.
[1:15:04] It it doesn't matter whether we're on
[1:15:06] time for church, whether we're half an
[1:15:08] hour early. It just doesn't ma It's
[1:15:10] okay,
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; is it? The prophet said it for a reason.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; But he says, notice the sign. What does
[1:15:17] the sign do? The sign is to attract the
[1:15:20] attention
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; and get the elected ready
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; and out of the way of out of the way
[1:15:27] before judgment strikes. That's what
[1:15:29] Noah did. He got the elected ready. I
[1:15:32] just can't help but think that's what
[1:15:33] brother Brandham did, ain't it?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the ministry of
[1:15:37] brother Brandham did. He got the elected
[1:15:38] ready. We'll look back one day and we'll
[1:15:40] be able to say that. Wasn't that
[1:15:41] beautiful how he he just came and he got
[1:15:43] the elected ready? Got us all ready so
[1:15:45] that we'd just be out of the way. You
[1:15:47] know, there's a a thing going around
[1:15:49] online and I just want to say it that I
[1:15:51] think it's important. Uh it's a I don't
[1:15:53] know how many people have seen it, but
[1:15:55] you might see it in the days coming or
[1:15:57] you might have seen it already, but
[1:15:58] there's a bunch of uh it's a montage of
[1:16:01] kids. It's a video and the kids are
[1:16:02] talking about the rapture taking place.
[1:16:04] They're talking about what the sky looks
[1:16:06] like and there's all these different
[1:16:08] things happening. And it's not just like
[1:16:09] one or two kids. It's it's multiple kids
[1:16:12] giving the same sort of account of
[1:16:14] what's actually taking place. And some
[1:16:16] of them are saying that it's going to
[1:16:17] happen at a certain date and a time. And
[1:16:19] we know the word of God says that no man
[1:16:21] knows the day or the hour.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; No man knows the day or the hour.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Not even the son, but only the father.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And it only happens at the time
[1:16:32] appointed of the father. And and as soon
[1:16:34] as we start trying to put a time stamp
[1:16:36] on something, we just kind of have to
[1:16:37] pump the brakes and step back and say,
[1:16:39] you know, it looks really good. It
[1:16:40] sounds attractive because it's exciting
[1:16:42] to think that it's coming really soon.
[1:16:44] We believe it already without seeing a
[1:16:46] video like that. We already believe the
[1:16:48] rapture is imminent, don't we?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; That it's imminent. It's going to
[1:16:52] happen. And we've never been this close
[1:16:54] to it. Right.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; So, I just think when I see stuff like
[1:16:57] that, I mean, it's circling in in
[1:16:58] message chats. That's why I'm saying it.
[1:17:01] It's not just out there in the world.
[1:17:02] I'm not looking at other worldly videos.
[1:17:04] This is just in a message chat. And and
[1:17:07] I just think, my
[1:17:09] that's not the sign we're looking for,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; The sign we're looking for is this word
[1:17:13] of God. It's the messenger to the age.
[1:17:16] and and he brought the message. He's
[1:17:18] given the sign and he's already gone.
[1:17:20] And you know how we can say that that
[1:17:22] that sign is correct is because it's
[1:17:25] turned the hearts of the children. It's
[1:17:27] already turned some hearts, hasn't it?
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Some hearts have already been turned
[1:17:31] back to the faith of the Pentecostal
[1:17:33] fathers. If we get a little bit excited
[1:17:35] and shout, it's okay.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; If somebody speaks in tongues, it's
[1:17:40] okay. If there's a prophesying, it's
[1:17:43] okay. I if there's discernment, it's
[1:17:46] okay. Why am I saying all of that?
[1:17:49] Because they're all fruit of the spirit.
[1:17:52] It's all part of the word of God.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; But there's been scarecrows raised up
[1:17:56] around the message. Forget about
[1:17:59] Christianity out there right here where
[1:18:02] people are afraid of it.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; And I want to say, brothers and sisters,
[1:18:05] don't be afraid of the word of God.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; I just love how he says this. It was to
[1:18:13] get the elected ready. And and he did
[1:18:14] it, didn't he?
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; He got the elected ready. But you know,
[1:18:17] we're still here. And that means there
[1:18:19] still must be some elected.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Either there's some elected that haven't
[1:18:23] come in yet or there's some elected that
[1:18:25] haven't gotten ready. One of those two.
[1:18:28] So, I just think we need to preach like
[1:18:30] uh they're still coming in. He says the
[1:18:33] rest of them. And what does it do? The
[1:18:35] sign and the voice of the sign condemns
[1:18:38] the unbeliever and gets him ready for
[1:18:40] judgment. It gets the elected ready for
[1:18:44] the escape.
[1:18:45] That's what sign is. That's what signs
[1:18:49] are given for for the coming judgment to
[1:18:54] the elected. They see it. It's not for
[1:18:58] everyone. We know that the disciples
[1:18:59] came to Jesus and said, you know,
[1:19:01] master, why do you rabbi, why do you
[1:19:02] teach in parables? Why can't you just
[1:19:04] say it plainly?
[1:19:07] And he told them because it's not given
[1:19:09] to them
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; to know the things of God. It's not
[1:19:13] given to them to know the kingdom of
[1:19:14] God. It's not given to them to know the
[1:19:16] mysteries of God. But blessed are your
[1:19:19] eyes
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; because they see these things and
[1:19:22] blessed are your ears and blessed are
[1:19:25] your hearts for they're able to receive
[1:19:27] the word. There's faith inside of you to
[1:19:30] mix with that word.
[1:19:33] And that's what gets us ready because
[1:19:35] we're elected. And when you're elected,
[1:19:37] that's what happens.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; You can't hear this word of God and be
[1:19:42] elected and say, "Well, I just can't do
[1:19:44] it." Unfortunately, and that's not to
[1:19:47] say that anyone is bad or anyone is
[1:19:50] good. It just is. It's election. It's
[1:19:54] like nature.
[1:19:56] Nature in the wilderness is savage. We
[1:19:58] would look at it and say it's savage. A
[1:20:00] coyote would grab a rabbit and tear it
[1:20:02] to pieces and eat it up and take the
[1:20:04] other parts back to his children and
[1:20:06] feed. It's terrible when you look at it
[1:20:08] that way, but it just is. It's neither
[1:20:10] good or bad. It's the curse. God created
[1:20:14] it to be that way until the changing of
[1:20:17] this world.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Man chose that path. That's a part of
[1:20:22] the curse. But it's neither good or bad.
[1:20:24] That coyote isn't a bad coyote because
[1:20:26] it got food for its family and got food
[1:20:28] for itself. That's the only way it
[1:20:29] knows,
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; It just is. An election just is.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Those who are elected will actually hear
[1:20:37] the voice behind the sign. They won't
[1:20:39] just see a sign and say, "Wow, that's a
[1:20:41] wonderful man of God." Anyways, no,
[1:20:44] they'll say, "Wait a second. I've got to
[1:20:45] stop at this burning bush and look at it
[1:20:47] and see what's going on. All these other
[1:20:50] people just keep walking by, getting in
[1:20:52] my way, but I just want to take a closer
[1:20:54] look and see what is this all about.
[1:20:58] Brother Bham says, "Like the little
[1:21:00] woman with a pure heart and a defiled
[1:21:02] body." My my my. We could preach about
[1:21:05] this for a little while. We might have
[1:21:07] to. And the Pharisee with a pure body
[1:21:10] and a defiled heart.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; It condemned one and saves the other.
[1:21:16] What does
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; the voice of the sign?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:21:23] manifest
[1:21:25] God.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. to the world.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; There he is in Galilee. And they say,
[1:21:32] "Come on over,
[1:21:35] miracle man. Come to a feast at the
[1:21:39] Pharisees house." Right?
[1:21:42] And here while he's there,
[1:21:45] they made a mockery of him. Brother
[1:21:47] Brandham talks about it. He says it how
[1:21:50] they invited him in, brought him in and
[1:21:53] and and got him there, but then they
[1:21:55] never they never greeted him properly,
[1:21:58] which means to anoint him with oil. They
[1:22:00] never washed his feet. Probably wash the
[1:22:03] feet first. The footwash flunky didn't
[1:22:05] even do it. He was told just ignore that
[1:22:07] guy. Just ignore him. They made a public
[1:22:11] show of him in the day that he showed
[1:22:13] up. And while they did that, they never
[1:22:16] anointed him with oil after they washed
[1:22:17] his feet. They should have and they
[1:22:19] never gave him a garment to sit down in.
[1:22:22] What they did was they just let him go
[1:22:24] and sit in the corner. And brother
[1:22:25] Benham talks about how they were like,
[1:22:26] "Okay, miracle man, do some wonder
[1:22:29] wonders and signs for us. Work some
[1:22:31] miracles so we could actually be
[1:22:33] entertained while we're eating here."
[1:22:35] They invited him not because they wanted
[1:22:37] him there, just so that they could
[1:22:39] actually have that vanity wrapping
[1:22:41] around them. And we've talked about it
[1:22:42] in the past, how they can have those fig
[1:22:44] leaves, those customtailored fig leaves
[1:22:47] wrapped around them. And I I I I think
[1:22:50] it's uh what is the word? Bespoke.
[1:22:53] Fig leaves. They fit me perfectly. They
[1:22:56] suit my taste. They fit all my curves in
[1:22:59] all the wrong places.
[1:23:04] But you know, they invited Jesus and
[1:23:05] they made a mockery of him. And who was
[1:23:08] it that actually solved the situation? I
[1:23:12] think it's absolutely beautiful
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; because it's no different from us. For
[1:23:17] any one of us to think that we would be
[1:23:19] any different were crazy.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; If we were raised in this world without
[1:23:24] this message of the hour, we would all
[1:23:28] be just like the other people in this
[1:23:29] world.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And don't think for a second that we
[1:23:32] wouldn't be. We would all be sinners,
[1:23:35] complete rank sinners. and in varying
[1:23:37] degrees. But this little prostitute,
[1:23:42] she saw what was going on and she
[1:23:43] couldn't take it anymore.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; And she had to do something about it.
[1:23:48] And and she thought, "What could I do?
[1:23:50] How could I ever do anything?" And then
[1:23:52] revelation started to strike her. Wait a
[1:23:54] second. I know where they sell perfume.
[1:23:55] I know they sell ointment. Why would she
[1:23:57] ever get that desire
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; if it wasn't revelation?
[1:24:05] and she took it and ran with it. And we
[1:24:08] know brother Brandham said something
[1:24:09] notable that I've never heard before,
[1:24:11] but he said she thought, but he's going
[1:24:15] to know where I got the money.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; He's going to know how I got it, but she
[1:24:20] said, "I'm going to do it anyway."
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And I just think as a believer, as as a
[1:24:27] human being living in this earth, the
[1:24:29] devil wants to make us believe that we
[1:24:31] are that way even though we're saved.
[1:24:34] When we're saved, if we've been baptized
[1:24:36] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:24:38] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And when we receive the gift of the Holy
[1:24:43] Ghost, we don't stop being tempted. We
[1:24:45] get more tempted.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; The only difference is our desire
[1:24:49] changes to give into that temptation
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; as much as we did. And you know, as long
[1:24:55] as we keep marching forward, that
[1:24:56] temptation will get weaker
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; and weaker and weaker and weaker. But as
[1:25:01] soon as we stop marching forward and we
[1:25:04] start to worship that temptation and
[1:25:07] say, "Whoa, I've got that temptation and
[1:25:09] that problem and I just can't get over
[1:25:11] it and it's just there." As long as we
[1:25:13] keep giving it life, it's going to be
[1:25:15] there.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; But we would be just like that
[1:25:18] prostitute woman, wouldn't we?
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he just brings it down
[1:25:22] home. And he says just like a a service
[1:25:24] like this, many times we want to sing
[1:25:25] songs and invite Jesus to come and be in
[1:25:28] our midst according to his word. Where
[1:25:30] two or three are gathered in his name,
[1:25:31] he's there, right? Are are we doing it
[1:25:34] with a pure hand heart and clean hands?
[1:25:37] Are we bringing him into the assembly,
[1:25:39] into our lives, because we really want
[1:25:41] to actually see our hearts changed or do
[1:25:44] we just want to have a good sermon and
[1:25:45] go home
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; and don't keep us too late
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; because we've got a roast in the oven or
[1:25:49] commitment or whatever or whatever.
[1:25:52] Right?
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; This ain't time to play games, brothers
[1:25:56] and sisters. This is the time where the
[1:25:58] death angel is passing through the land
[1:25:59] right now.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; The rapture isn't the death angel. The
[1:26:04] devil is the death angel
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; and this is Satan's Eden. He's passing
[1:26:09] through the land.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; We have to make sure we've got that
[1:26:12] token applied. But it's just so
[1:26:14] beautiful how that little prostitute,
[1:26:15] the one with a defiled hands and and
[1:26:18] feet, defiled body with with with an
[1:26:22] unpure
[1:26:24] body. My he says like the little woman
[1:26:26] with a pure heart and defiled body.
[1:26:29] That's the one
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; that was given the revelation.
[1:26:34] Don't think that we're going to be any
[1:26:35] different.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a defiled body and a
[1:26:40] defiled mind. But let's come to the
[1:26:43] place where we can have a pure heart.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; It starts with a pure heart.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Once we can get our hearts right, then
[1:26:52] everything else falls into place.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; But I love how Brother Bam talks about
[1:26:56] this little woman with a pure heart and
[1:26:58] a defiled body. She had the ability to
[1:27:01] recognize what was going on. And what
[1:27:04] could she do to fix it? She ran. She got
[1:27:07] the alabaster box with the ointment and
[1:27:09] she came in to where everyone was. She
[1:27:12] didn't care who was in that worship
[1:27:13] service. You can bring the quote up,
[1:27:15] brother, and leave it up. It's fine. She
[1:27:17] didn't care who was in the worship
[1:27:19] service. She didn't care who was around
[1:27:21] her watching her. She got busy washing
[1:27:25] Jesus' feet and appreciating him in the
[1:27:27] moment because nobody else was.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Not to the level she was. And I just
[1:27:35] want to say I think it's time that we
[1:27:37] get to that place, brothers and sisters.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Or it doesn't matter who's here.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what they're doing or
[1:27:43] thinking. Who cares?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Let's let's acknowledge the presence of
[1:27:47] Jesus Christ the way that he wants to
[1:27:50] be. And you can imagine he wanted to be
[1:27:52] acknowledged that way or he would have
[1:27:54] stopped her.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; But it's beautiful because this little
[1:27:58] woman with a pure heart and a defiled
[1:28:01] body. And then there was the Pharisee.
[1:28:05] He had a pure body, didn't he? He had a
[1:28:08] pure body. He probably had a pure house.
[1:28:10] He probably had everything in order in
[1:28:11] his house. It was probably never messy,
[1:28:13] especially when people came over, right?
[1:28:17] Everything was perfectly in order.
[1:28:22] Mr. Pharisee with a pure body.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; But what did he have? He had a defiled
[1:28:26] heart.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; And as I was looking at this, I just I
[1:28:30] think it's so beautiful because, you
[1:28:32] know, brothers and sisters, he he maybe
[1:28:33] wasn't a ranked sinner. I'm not saying
[1:28:35] he was.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying he was a terrible
[1:28:38] individual. He might not even have been
[1:28:40] the one that put Jesus on the cross.
[1:28:42] Right?
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; We know Nicodemus recognized who he was,
[1:28:45] but for fear of his meal ticket, he was
[1:28:47] afraid to actually step up and say
[1:28:49] something.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus was a great teacher. But you
[1:28:53] know, this Pharisee, he might not have
[1:28:55] been off on his doctrine. He might not
[1:28:57] have been too far off on any of it. He
[1:28:59] might have just been one iota. Just
[1:29:01] something a little bit off in his life.
[1:29:04] Just wasn't completely pure in his
[1:29:06] heart. And it caused all of this to
[1:29:08] happen. He maybe never even desired to
[1:29:12] actually put Jesus on an open display
[1:29:14] shame in his party. Maybe he actually
[1:29:17] genuinely wanted to see something
[1:29:19] happen. And the people that were there
[1:29:20] in the places, they heard all the
[1:29:22] conversations and they thought, "Well,
[1:29:24] because we're on this team, we're not
[1:29:25] going to appreciate him. We're not going
[1:29:27] to," you know how it goes.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; It could easily go that way.
[1:29:32] But this Pharisee with a pure body,
[1:29:34] everything in his life, outwardly
[1:29:37] appearing perfect.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; He knew the message so well, you could
[1:29:41] take a a pin and poke it through a tape
[1:29:45] and pull it back out and then just
[1:29:47] stretch the tape out and know exactly
[1:29:50] what number, how many minutes into the
[1:29:52] tape it was. Right?
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying?
[1:29:56] the message Pharisees, the message
[1:29:58] theologians. We know the Pharisees could
[1:30:01] do that with the scrolls, the
[1:30:02] scriptures, but there's people that do
[1:30:04] that with the message,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; They know it all, but yet they don't
[1:30:08] have a pure heart.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; And you know them by their fruits.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Let's be honest.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; You know them by their fruits. As I was
[1:30:16] studying this, I was thinking, you know,
[1:30:18] it doesn't take very long. If you ever
[1:30:20] get into the the sales game, you ever
[1:30:22] get into that arena, I had to dabble in
[1:30:23] it a little bit in my life. You get
[1:30:26] about 30 seconds in front of a client,
[1:30:29] in front of a a person that you're
[1:30:31] looking to sell, whatever it is you're
[1:30:32] going to do. You get about 30 seconds of
[1:30:35] a chance to prove it, to get an approval
[1:30:38] to go to the next conversation. In 30
[1:30:41] seconds, it's in your appearance. It's
[1:30:44] in the way you speak, maybe even in the
[1:30:46] way you smell,
[1:30:48] your punctuality, right? There's certain
[1:30:51] things that that add up and and you get
[1:30:53] like a moment to actually make your
[1:30:56] first impression with human beings. And
[1:30:59] you know, at that point, if you get that
[1:31:02] moment, if you get that far, then you
[1:31:04] get like another minute to have what
[1:31:06] they call an elevator speech. You better
[1:31:09] be able to say what it is you're doing
[1:31:11] in in a very short period of time or
[1:31:13] you're going to lose the attention of
[1:31:15] the individual. It's like sending great
[1:31:17] long emails, great long text messages.
[1:31:20] They say that CEOs when they do that, if
[1:31:23] you don't catch their attention in the
[1:31:24] first paragraph, they're done.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; They scrap it. And that's why too many
[1:31:29] texts or too many emails is not a good
[1:31:31] thing. People just they they can't keep
[1:31:33] the information or whatever. But just
[1:31:36] thinking about this, we get a very short
[1:31:37] period of time to actually make an
[1:31:39] impression in people's lives. And what
[1:31:41] is the impression that we're making in
[1:31:42] people's lives with that tiny little
[1:31:43] window, that little space of time that
[1:31:45] we have? Is it that we actually
[1:31:48] represent Jesus Christ? Or is it that
[1:31:50] maybe there's something else going on?
[1:31:52] We have a little bit of a Pharisee
[1:31:53] living in our lives with with a pure
[1:31:56] body. Everything in our life is perfect
[1:31:58] outwardly, but there's just something
[1:32:01] just something that comes up. And you
[1:32:03] know, if we make excuses for that
[1:32:04] something, that something's always going
[1:32:06] to be there.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; But if we say, "Greater is he that is in
[1:32:09] me." Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Than he that is in this flesh.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; I think the word of God, we know it says
[1:32:15] in this world, but I'm not going to get
[1:32:18] scientific or or theological on it, but
[1:32:21] I just want to say it this way. This
[1:32:22] body, this this body is not my home.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through. This flesh
[1:32:29] will never ever see the final
[1:32:31] destination of where I'm going. And
[1:32:33] neither will yours. We can't see the
[1:32:35] real you and the real me. Isn't that
[1:32:37] beautiful? I think it's just amazing. We
[1:32:40] do not want to be that Pharisee that has
[1:32:43] a a pure body but a defiled heart. And
[1:32:46] I'm not saying we want to go and be like
[1:32:48] that defiled woman either.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; I want to say that we recognize the
[1:32:52] blood of Jesus Christ atones for all of
[1:32:55] our faults and failures.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; There ain't no making excuse. We don't
[1:32:58] need to make excuses to say that I've
[1:33:00] always done this way. I'm just this way.
[1:33:02] I'm done. No. You know what they say? I
[1:33:05] I I live my life most of my life saying
[1:33:07] that, you know, I'm I'm terrible with
[1:33:09] names. I'm terrible with names. Well,
[1:33:12] you know what I learned from a prophet?
[1:33:13] He says that every single cell in your
[1:33:15] body hears that confession.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; So, guess what?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; I'm terrible with names.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; But I'm learning to get better at
[1:33:25] remembering names. I'm I'm striving to
[1:33:29] do this. I'm I'm getting better at that.
[1:33:32] Whatever it is, we're never going to
[1:33:33] live above our confession.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradam, he says it. I'm just
[1:33:38] going to read this this paragraph again.
[1:33:40] Like the little woman with a pure heart
[1:33:41] and a defiled body and the Pharisee with
[1:33:43] a pure body and a defiled heart, it
[1:33:46] condemned one and saves the other one.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? That's the word that
[1:33:53] we believe. And that's why people get so
[1:33:55] upset with the prophet because what it
[1:33:57] does is it it condemns them. We don't
[1:33:59] condemn anyone,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; right? We don't condemn anyone. And the
[1:34:03] very judgments that saved Moses
[1:34:06] condemned the world.
[1:34:09] All of those plagues.
[1:34:12] Take that lamb.
[1:34:14] Take it and cut its throat and prepare
[1:34:17] it the way that I've instructed you with
[1:34:20] the bitter herbs. Get your family
[1:34:22] together. And if you don't have a
[1:34:24] family, get with your neighbors. Get
[1:34:26] under a roof.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? It's the same thing
[1:34:30] that brother Brandham said when they
[1:34:31] were up there in that box canyon the one
[1:34:33] day they were there hunting and brother
[1:34:36] Bradom he threw a rock up in the air and
[1:34:38] he said something happened. He said get
[1:34:40] under something quick.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; I can't help but think it's exactly the
[1:34:44] same way the prophet told them to get
[1:34:47] under a roof.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Get under a roof. If you don't have a
[1:34:51] family, get with another family and kill
[1:34:53] that lamb. get that lamb killed and save
[1:34:55] the blood and apply it exactly the way
[1:34:58] we've been instructed by the prophet.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; God never boomed his voice and said to
[1:35:04] Israel, "Go and do this."
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; He spoke to a prophet and told them, "Go
[1:35:09] tell my people. Apply it this way and
[1:35:12] then eat it up. Take that lamb and eat
[1:35:15] it up. Don't just leave it." Brother
[1:35:17] Adam says, "And the very judgments that
[1:35:19] saved Moses condemned the world." that
[1:35:21] death angel passed through the land. And
[1:35:24] anybody that decided to not listen to
[1:35:25] what the prophet said in that day, they
[1:35:28] died, right?
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; The firstborn died. And I I want to say
[1:35:32] this, it's just so beautiful. I think
[1:35:34] the Lord just shows us stuff. The people
[1:35:36] who didn't do it right and they actually
[1:35:38] saw the firstborn die. I wonder how many
[1:35:40] there were. I don't think the word of
[1:35:42] God says how many there were, does it?
[1:35:45] But isn't it interesting because there
[1:35:47] was many, many people. Well, they just
[1:35:49] never had faith enough to mix with that
[1:35:50] word when they were out in the
[1:35:52] wilderness. So maybe some firstborn
[1:35:55] died. That's okay. They were able to
[1:35:57] carry on. They they were given
[1:35:59] deliverance and they came out of
[1:36:00] bondage, went out into the wilderness.
[1:36:02] But how many of those people actually
[1:36:05] went into the promised land? Not very
[1:36:08] many. Brother Brandham preaches the
[1:36:10] message called one in a million
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; for a reason.
[1:36:15] Paragraph 109 says it gets the elected
[1:36:17] ready. That judgment that saved Moses,
[1:36:20] condemned the world, his preaching,
[1:36:24] it gets the elected ready.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; When we read that scripture in
[1:36:29] Revelation that talks about how uh no,
[1:36:32] it's not Revelation. We read the
[1:36:33] scripture that talks about how the
[1:36:35] reapers are going to go forwards and
[1:36:38] actually reap. They're going to separate
[1:36:40] the wheat from the chaff. How are they
[1:36:42] going to do it? It's the same way. It's
[1:36:44] by the preaching.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Those angels are not going to be picking
[1:36:47] up people and taking them to
[1:36:48] geographical locations.
[1:36:50] It's just going to be the preaching of
[1:36:51] the word, preaching of this message in
[1:36:53] the day in which we live. And some
[1:36:54] people are going to be able to go on and
[1:36:56] receive it. And some people are going to
[1:36:58] say, "Oh, no. I can't receive that." And
[1:37:00] that's God. That's election. But it gets
[1:37:03] the elected ready. What is the elected
[1:37:05] ready for? When they see a God-scent
[1:37:08] sign, they look back in the scripture.
[1:37:11] They don't just take it and say, "Well,
[1:37:13] amen. It must be right because there's a
[1:37:15] lot of signs in the world."
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus said, "There's going
[1:37:20] to be many false prophets that go out
[1:37:22] among you. Many Jesus will be in the
[1:37:26] world." But brother Bradam, he says,
[1:37:29] "There's only one Messiah, one Lord
[1:37:31] Jesus."
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; But it gets the elected ready for what?
[1:37:36] when they see a God-sense sign, they
[1:37:38] look back in the scripture and see if
[1:37:41] that's supposed to be there.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; And isn't that exactly what Paul did
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; on his way to Damascus on his way to
[1:37:49] Damascus to lay the church of God to
[1:37:52] waste?
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; We know that he had a revelation, fell
[1:37:55] off his horse, got taken into town, got
[1:37:58] his vision back, God dealt with it on
[1:38:01] both ends. We know all that happened.
[1:38:02] But once that happened, he didn't just
[1:38:04] say, "Whoa, I've got this tremendous
[1:38:06] experience." And start galloping through
[1:38:07] the land preaching this tremendous
[1:38:09] experience. He went into the backside of
[1:38:11] the desert. He went into Arabia for four
[1:38:13] years to test it by the word of God to
[1:38:16] see, is this according to the word of
[1:38:18] God. And that's what gave him the
[1:38:20] confidence to go forwards and say, "This
[1:38:22] is everything that I've learned about.
[1:38:24] Now I can see. I heard my whole life,
[1:38:27] but now I can truly see because it gets
[1:38:30] the elected ready." What is the elect
[1:38:31] ready for? When they see a God-sense
[1:38:34] sign, they look back in the scripture
[1:38:35] and see if it's supposed to be there. If
[1:38:38] we just look back to our traditions and
[1:38:40] say, "Well, my parents, they, you know,
[1:38:42] my the old pastor or the old church or
[1:38:44] the denomination." If we do that, then
[1:38:47] we're still between those two opinions
[1:38:48] we were talking about earlier. And we're
[1:38:50] never going to be settled, rooted, and
[1:38:52] grounded in the faith of the word of
[1:38:54] God. We will be tossed about if we're
[1:38:56] not. He says, "Yeah, here it is. What is
[1:38:59] it? pending judgment. Then the elected
[1:39:02] listens to the voice,
[1:39:05] but the unelected ignores and said,
[1:39:08] "Nonsense. Go on.
[1:39:11] We'll take the same old school." See,
[1:39:14] everything is fine in our life, right?
[1:39:16] Yeah. We'll take the same old school.
[1:39:19] See, that's the way they did in the days
[1:39:21] of Luther.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; That's the way they did in the days of
[1:39:24] Wesley. That's the way they do now.
[1:39:28] the way they've always done.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Imagine if Moses just did the way they'd
[1:39:36] always done.
[1:39:38] Threw away all that he knew and went
[1:39:39] into the back side of the desert. Now he
[1:39:41] was dealing with his father-in-law's
[1:39:42] business and
[1:39:45] people in Midian
[1:39:47] just dealing with it there and saw the
[1:39:49] burning bush and just did like everyone
[1:39:51] else. We're good. I'm good. Don't need
[1:39:54] it.
[1:39:56] never did
[1:39:58] something on the inside.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; I thought it was so beautiful. I just in
[1:40:02] meditating this morning
[1:40:05] in prayer, my heart's desire, brothers
[1:40:08] and sisters,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; is not to see a a church grow and become
[1:40:13] a big humongous mega church.
[1:40:16] But it it just struck me so profound
[1:40:19] this morning how there is either elected
[1:40:23] that haven't actually come into the
[1:40:26] place of maturity
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; in the church of the living God or
[1:40:30] there's still elected that need to hear
[1:40:32] about this gospel.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; One of those two things is happening
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; or the rapture would be gone.
[1:40:40] So, it gives me a desire to say, I want
[1:40:42] to go and start beating the streets,
[1:40:45] start looking in the highways and the
[1:40:47] byways of the city of Calgary and find
[1:40:49] out who who is it? Where where is that
[1:40:52] person? Is there another elected
[1:40:55] individual that's willing to receive
[1:40:57] that God sent a prophet to this
[1:40:59] generation?
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Where are they? What's going on? I I
[1:41:04] just think as we go forwards, we know
[1:41:06] the children of Israel, God, He saw them
[1:41:08] in their bondage. She saw them in their
[1:41:10] affliction, but we know they went 30
[1:41:11] years over the promise. But once they
[1:41:15] started to cry and sigh for a deliverer,
[1:41:20] we know that God sent them deliverance.
[1:41:21] We're not crying for a deliverer now,
[1:41:23] are we?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; I want to start crying for the things of
[1:41:26] eternal value. And that is for that last
[1:41:27] predestinated seed.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham says, "But it is a
[1:41:32] sign. And it has a voice that follows
[1:41:34] the sign. And the voice is identified as
[1:41:38] a scriptural voice. Now, don't forget
[1:41:41] that it's always going to be identified
[1:41:44] as a scriptural voice.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; And to me, this was the conversation
[1:41:48] we're having yesterday about all of the
[1:41:50] different ideas and theories you hear
[1:41:52] about the word of God.
[1:41:54] My, we're always going to take the word
[1:41:57] of God above all of our thoughts,
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; above all of our desires, above
[1:42:01] everything that we think we know. It's
[1:42:03] always going to be the word of God.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Not make excuse for it and say, "No,
[1:42:08] that was for another time." No. He says,
[1:42:12] "But it's a sign and it has a voice that
[1:42:14] follows the sign." And the voice is
[1:42:16] identified as a scriptural voice. Now,
[1:42:18] don't forget that. Now, keep that going
[1:42:20] in because I may never see you again.
[1:42:23] Huh? Now, I hope I'll see you again
[1:42:26] myself.
[1:42:27] I just think it's so wonderful to look
[1:42:29] at that. You know, another message that
[1:42:31] Brother Brandham, he preaches is why
[1:42:34] people Oh, no, sorry, I'm getting mixed
[1:42:37] up here. Bear with me. He says, 'Wh is
[1:42:39] it that so many Christians find it so
[1:42:41] hard to live the Christian life? Why is
[1:42:44] it because they just haven't actually
[1:42:47] gone all the way to completely
[1:42:50] surrendering and saying that I can't do
[1:42:52] it with my hands and I can't do it with
[1:42:54] my feet. I can't do it with my mind.
[1:42:57] I need to surrender all. Like we sang
[1:42:59] that song.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; I surrender all.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; We know the word of God says to
[1:43:06] acknowledge him in all of our ways and
[1:43:10] he will direct our paths. But why is it
[1:43:12] that so many Christians
[1:43:15] find it so hard to live the Christian
[1:43:18] life?
[1:43:20] I'll tell you in a little summary. I
[1:43:22] would recommend going and listening to
[1:43:23] it, but just a simple summary is is
[1:43:25] simply this. surrender.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; They're not fully surrendered.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; They say they are, but they're not.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; And if we say we are and we're not fully
[1:43:36] surrendered, the devil knows it.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; And he's going to come around and test
[1:43:40] us and try us and push us and poke us
[1:43:42] and do everything that he can to upset
[1:43:44] our apple cart. But that's why so many
[1:43:47] Christians find it hard to live the
[1:43:49] Christian life because they're busy
[1:43:50] trying to live it. Stop it.
[1:43:53] Stop trying to live that Christian life
[1:43:55] yourself and let Jesus Christ the same
[1:43:58] yesterday, today, and forever come into
[1:44:00] you and take over your body, your mind,
[1:44:03] your heart, and begin to live this word
[1:44:06] through us
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; and see what happens. And it's hard,
[1:44:10] man. I know it. You've got to be willing
[1:44:13] to say to yourself, "I know you love
[1:44:16] that, but he says no.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just going to walk by faith, and
[1:44:20] I don't even know how that's going to
[1:44:22] work." or or my I don't really want to
[1:44:24] do that. But he says yes,
[1:44:27] so I'm going to walk by faith even
[1:44:29] though I don't even know how it's going
[1:44:31] to happen.
[1:44:33] I could only live by the examples that
[1:44:34] I've been given. And one of them is
[1:44:35] tithing. I've talked about it many
[1:44:37] times. If you want to hear more about
[1:44:38] it, I'll tell you. But when it comes to
[1:44:40] tithing, I'm not pulling for money. What
[1:44:42] I'm saying is see if God won't bless
[1:44:44] you. He says in his word, prove me on
[1:44:46] this. This is not just about giving to
[1:44:49] the church and seeing my money go into
[1:44:52] the treasury. No, it's all God's money.
[1:44:54] Just ask brother Mvin and see what he
[1:44:56] says. It's all God's money and he simply
[1:44:59] gives us 90% if we're willing to trust
[1:45:02] and give him the 10 that he asked for.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; But I had an experience where I learned
[1:45:07] very quickly, I mean real quickly, that
[1:45:10] he means business when it comes to
[1:45:12] tithing. And sometimes we don't have the
[1:45:15] money that we think we have to be able
[1:45:17] to tithe with. We're going to go broke
[1:45:18] if we do it. Prove him on it.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; He's got all the money.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; He's got all the money. There ain't no
[1:45:25] billionaire in this world that has any
[1:45:26] money unless he first gave it to him.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason we have money is
[1:45:33] because he gave it to us.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; We can say, "My, I got out of bed. I
[1:45:37] went to bed early last night. I take
[1:45:38] vitamins. I do all these different
[1:45:40] things and and studied in school and
[1:45:42] I've got all this stuff going on in my
[1:45:44] life. I know all about business and I
[1:45:46] can go and make money anywhere. And I I
[1:45:48] say that I'm guilty of saying some of
[1:45:49] those things.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; I can go out and get a job and make
[1:45:52] money. But what I am saying is that it
[1:45:55] only comes by him.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that happens unless he
[1:45:59] first ordains it.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; If we have any good thing in our life,
[1:46:03] where does it come from?
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; All good things come from above. Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; But the reason why it's so hard for so
[1:46:12] many Christians to find the way to live
[1:46:15] this Christian life is they're too busy
[1:46:17] trying to live it themselves.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; If we would just step back and actually
[1:46:21] allow him to live it through us, our
[1:46:23] lives would probably be a whole lot
[1:46:25] easier.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; They might be a little more difficult
[1:46:28] initially. There's no question about
[1:46:30] that. Because sometimes we have to go
[1:46:32] back and mend fences. Sometimes we have
[1:46:33] to go back and build bridges that were
[1:46:35] burned. Sometimes we have to do things
[1:46:37] that we really don't feel comfortable
[1:46:38] doing. But if we're willing to do it,
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; God will bless us for it.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; He'll bless us beyond what we ever
[1:46:45] thought.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Why can't some people keep the victory?
[1:46:51] Brother Brandham talks about that. You
[1:46:54] can probably see the the theme where I'm
[1:46:56] going with all this. It's simply because
[1:46:58] people aren't surrendering, man. They
[1:46:59] just don't have a pure heart. It's not
[1:47:01] completely pure towards the word of God.
[1:47:03] They might have a genuinely kind heart
[1:47:04] that's 100% pure. They might have
[1:47:07] genuine love, a a a filial love, human
[1:47:11] love in their life that that's pure, as
[1:47:13] pure as it could possibly be. But we're
[1:47:16] not talking about that. We're talking
[1:47:17] about a pure spiritual heart where the
[1:47:19] Holy Ghost himself comes into that
[1:47:21] little hollow place that he made in our
[1:47:23] soul, in our life, in our heart for him
[1:47:26] to live in. Brother Brandham, he uh got
[1:47:29] one more quote here before we close. in
[1:47:31] 1955, Fellowship by Redemption. He says,
[1:47:34] "Isn't it simple?" And I just love the
[1:47:36] way Brother Brandham says it because you
[1:47:39] hear about it so many times around the
[1:47:41] message how complicated it is.
[1:47:46] It's preached in such a way that it
[1:47:47] makes my head spin. And I can't help but
[1:47:50] think that sometimes even some of the
[1:47:52] ministers that do this, it's got to
[1:47:53] confuse them.
[1:47:56] You get some, they go off on Godhead and
[1:47:58] explain the Godhead for two hours
[1:48:01] talking about Godhead. How do you do
[1:48:03] that? You can't explain Godhead.
[1:48:06] It's God in three simple offices. Now, I
[1:48:10] say it that way just because I want to
[1:48:12] simplify it. God isn't simple. I'm not
[1:48:14] saying that.
[1:48:16] But it's the same spirit manifesting in
[1:48:19] three different ways. That's all.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But in 1955, Fellowship by
[1:48:25] Redemption, he says, "Isn't it simple?
[1:48:27] Preachers make it so complicated. You
[1:48:30] have to come and take prohibitions and
[1:48:33] all these other things. You don't have
[1:48:36] to come and understand all of the seals.
[1:48:39] You don't have to come and understand
[1:48:41] the Hebrew series. You don't have to
[1:48:44] come and understand a lot of these
[1:48:46] different things, the mysteries. You
[1:48:48] don't have to. The only thing you've got
[1:48:50] to do is repent and get the baptism of
[1:48:52] the Holy Ghost and you will see all of
[1:48:55] these things come to life. You will
[1:48:56] begin to understand them because it's
[1:48:58] not going to be a man teaching you. It
[1:48:59] will be Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost
[1:49:01] teaching. But he says, it simple
[1:49:03] preachers make it so complicated. You
[1:49:05] have to come and take all prohibitions
[1:49:07] and all these other things. It's not.
[1:49:09] The Bible said it's so plain till even a
[1:49:13] fool shouldn't error,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:17] just accepting it, believing it,
[1:49:19] something happens in here.
[1:49:22] The only way that happens though is for
[1:49:24] a pure, fully, unreserved
[1:49:29] surrender to God. Man, if we have any
[1:49:32] reservations, I've told this about young
[1:49:35] people that want to come in and they
[1:49:36] want to make a stand for Christ and
[1:49:38] they've been in and out and up and down
[1:49:39] and all around and they just can't
[1:49:41] really seem to get the victory in their
[1:49:43] life. I've said it and I mean it with
[1:49:44] all my heart. Take the cell phone and
[1:49:47] throw it in the toilet.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; If you really want to serve God, you'll
[1:49:51] do that.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; The cell phone can always be replaced.
[1:49:55] Don't you think that God can't give you
[1:49:56] another cell phone? Even if it's a
[1:49:57] $2,000 deal, don't think he can never do
[1:50:00] that again. He can give you another cell
[1:50:02] phone,
[1:50:03] but it's those friends that are on that
[1:50:05] cell phone,
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; It's that social media that's going to
[1:50:09] drag you down. And if you're not willing
[1:50:12] to sever those ties, you're not willing
[1:50:14] to serve God with a pure heart. It's
[1:50:16] that simple.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; If you want to keep mingling around with
[1:50:20] the world, you don't have a pure heart,
[1:50:22] which means you're not going to have
[1:50:23] clean hands, which means you're not
[1:50:25] going into that mount.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; That's the way it works. And it's the
[1:50:29] same thing with any one of us. Maybe
[1:50:31] it's not a child. Maybe it's someone
[1:50:32] that has something else in their life.
[1:50:34] If they're not willing to get rid of
[1:50:36] that thing wholeheartedly and say, "I
[1:50:38] don't understand what's going to happen.
[1:50:40] This blows my mind. How will I ever be
[1:50:41] able to overcome it? Just ask him
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; and see if he won't show you.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; But you got to be willing to do it.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; And you can't bluff him and you can't
[1:50:50] bluff the devil.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; It's so weird because you can bluff
[1:50:54] yourself.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; We know that's human nature. All we got
[1:50:56] to do is say it enough. I remember being
[1:50:59] in the world. I don't know. I'm not
[1:51:01] claiming to be a saint. I'm never going
[1:51:03] to be a saint. I'm just going to be
[1:51:04] Brother Barry. And I I've got the token
[1:51:07] applied in my life to the best of my
[1:51:09] ability. I I I believe it with all my
[1:51:11] heart, but you know, there was a time in
[1:51:13] my life where I I wanted to be a certain
[1:51:15] way. I wanted so bad to do certain
[1:51:18] things in my life. And I would go to a
[1:51:20] new situation where nobody really knew
[1:51:22] me. And I would tell them that I
[1:51:23] actually did those things in my life
[1:51:25] that I always wanted to do but never
[1:51:27] really did. And and I thought that it
[1:51:28] garnered me some some street cred is
[1:51:31] what the people say, right? I got some
[1:51:33] some bonus points because they thought I
[1:51:35] was cool because I did these things. But
[1:51:38] I knew in my heart I never did them. But
[1:51:40] what happened was it wasn't very long,
[1:51:42] call it a few years of talking that
[1:51:44] talk, I began to believe it.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; It's human nature.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; And what it does is it causes a blind
[1:51:51] spot and we can actually convince
[1:51:52] ourselves of a lie.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, he says just accepting
[1:52:00] it, believing it, something happens in
[1:52:02] here. Then God moves in with his spirit.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in that little hollow place
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; there in the heart.
[1:52:11] Now that soul
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; now you believe the word of God
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; and you have everlasting life.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And I think it's just so wonderful, so
[1:52:23] beautiful, so amazing because that is
[1:52:25] the word of God. It's Jesus Christ that
[1:52:28] saves people.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; There's many different classes of
[1:52:31] people, brothers and sisters. There's
[1:52:33] the there's the people that actually are
[1:52:36] able to be elected because God called
[1:52:37] them to be elected. There's people that
[1:52:39] aren't elected, but they're still going
[1:52:41] to be saved in the second resurrection.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; And there's people that never even had
[1:52:46] their names written on the book that are
[1:52:48] actually going to get get the gift of
[1:52:50] eternal life. They're going to inherit
[1:52:52] eternal life. They're not going to be
[1:52:54] the bride. They're not going to sit with
[1:52:55] him in his throne, but they'll be able
[1:52:57] to live for eternity in the city.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Never even believing that God sent a
[1:53:03] prophet.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; But somewhere, somewhere, how along the
[1:53:07] way, they did something good for the
[1:53:09] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; We have the ability to impart that to
[1:53:13] people.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I want to take
[1:53:16] as many people with me as I can."
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; And I I think that we all stand in in
[1:53:21] that corner. That's where we are today,
[1:53:22] isn't it? We want to take as many people
[1:53:24] with us as we can. Being elected is not
[1:53:27] something that we boast about. Being
[1:53:30] elected is something that humbles us
[1:53:32] because we understand that it's nothing
[1:53:34] we ever did.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Nothing we could ever do.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; If you believe the word of God, you have
[1:53:43] everlasting life.
[1:53:46] Now, what you need now, if you've never
[1:53:48] been baptized with water, is to be
[1:53:51] baptized for the remission of your sins.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; And how do you do that? If you do it in
[1:53:56] the name of the Father and you do it in
[1:53:58] the name of the Son and you do it in the
[1:53:59] name of the Holy Ghost, then whose name
[1:54:01] are you baptized in?
[1:54:04] If you were to mail a letter to a
[1:54:07] specific address, but it said the name
[1:54:09] of the father, who would get that
[1:54:11] envelope,
[1:54:12] maybe the dad in the house, but what if
[1:54:14] there wasn't a dad in the house? Right?
[1:54:16] That's not a name. The father is not the
[1:54:18] name.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; The son isn't a name.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; And Holy Ghost isn't a name. The name is
[1:54:24] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ, that is the baptism
[1:54:30] that we're after. When we're baptized in
[1:54:32] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
[1:54:34] you know, some people will say, "How do
[1:54:35] you know that? I believe the word of
[1:54:36] God. I'm just fine." Okay? But if you
[1:54:39] want to see if there's more, if you want
[1:54:41] to see if there's more, if there's more
[1:54:42] revelation, if God won't take you into
[1:54:44] that mount, if you want to see it, try
[1:54:47] him.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Test him at his word. See if he's a
[1:54:50] liar. He's not. If you want the Holy
[1:54:53] Ghost in a way like maybe you've never
[1:54:55] experienced it just try him on it my
[1:54:59] he says then peace comes into the heart
[1:55:01] and everything I should call the
[1:55:03] musicians then you begin then you can
[1:55:05] really shout like a Christian should
[1:55:08] shout
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; then speaking with tongues then the
[1:55:13] gifts of the spirit begins to manifest
[1:55:14] behind a pure heart a real foundation
[1:55:18] watch what happens then then that's real
[1:55:22] holy spirit.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; But first, it takes a pure heart.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; First, it takes clean hands.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; We've got to be willing to surrender
[1:55:33] everything, all that we have to the word
[1:55:37] of God in the day in which we live. All
[1:55:39] of it. But if we're willing to hold on
[1:55:42] to one thing, it's going to drag us
[1:55:43] down. It's going to take us right back
[1:55:45] to where we were. We're going to wonder,
[1:55:47] "Why is it so hard? Why is it so hard?
[1:55:50] Lord, please help. Why is it so hard?
[1:55:53] Brother Bradom says he's just right
[1:55:54] where we left him. All we got to do is
[1:55:56] go back to where we left him. I say,
[1:55:58] "Lord, help me because I've done it. I
[1:56:00] know exactly what it's like." We can put
[1:56:02] ourselves in the permissive will of God
[1:56:04] and still be serving God, still going
[1:56:06] down the road towards heaven,
[1:56:09] but walking on a real bumpy road.
[1:56:13] But I love how he says this here. Maybe
[1:56:14] stand with me as we close today. Then
[1:56:16] peace comes into the heart and
[1:56:17] everything.
[1:56:19] Peace doesn't just come into the heart.
[1:56:21] Peace comes into the car.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Peace comes into the home, right?
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Peace comes into the church. Peace comes
[1:56:28] into the marriage. Peace comes into the
[1:56:31] relationships.
[1:56:33] Peace comes into the jobs, to school.
[1:56:37] Remember we read right at the beginning
[1:56:38] that he
[1:56:40] he inhabits it all, doesn't he?
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Peace comes into the heart and
[1:56:47] everything. Then you can begin. Then you
[1:56:49] can really shout like a Christian should
[1:56:51] shout. You know, brother Bam, he says
[1:56:53] it. You should get We should be just as
[1:56:55] exuberant about this as they are out
[1:56:57] there about their sporting games and
[1:57:00] events.
[1:57:02] Christians should shout. Then the
[1:57:04] speaking with tongues and then the gifts
[1:57:05] of the spirit begins to manifest behind
[1:57:07] a pure heart. Not in front of a pure
[1:57:10] heart, behind a pure heart. A real
[1:57:13] foundation. Watch what happens then.
[1:57:15] Then that's real Holy Spirit. But if you
[1:57:17] just come up on just a little emotion,
[1:57:21] it'll never work. You'll go right back
[1:57:24] out and hate. If you're not willing to
[1:57:27] just forget about all those friends,
[1:57:29] all those acquaintances, all the social
[1:57:31] media people, all of that stuff, if
[1:57:33] you're not willing to turn all that off,
[1:57:34] you want to keep all that going, but you
[1:57:36] still want to serve God, you're caught
[1:57:38] between two opinions because those
[1:57:40] people are not going to actually agree
[1:57:41] with what you're trying to do. They're
[1:57:43] going to try and drag you that way. And
[1:57:45] you know if you associate with that they
[1:57:47] will drag you that way. You will not
[1:57:50] overcome that. You have to sever the
[1:57:52] ties completely. But you know as soon as
[1:57:54] you do that I guarantee you the fear
[1:57:56] that strikes your heart when you think I
[1:57:58] have to disassociate myself with all
[1:58:00] those friends. How will I ever find
[1:58:01] friends? I'll tell you what, brother
[1:58:03] Bradam talks about it. How he never had
[1:58:05] friends as a kid but he's got more
[1:58:06] friends now all around the world than he
[1:58:08] ever imagined that he could have
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; because he surrendered to the word of
[1:58:12] God.
[1:58:15] Alls we've got to do is be willing to
[1:58:18] take the first step. He talks about the
[1:58:20] eagle being trapped in the chicken yard
[1:58:22] scratching around in all the manure. And
[1:58:24] that eagle didn't didn't like it. It
[1:58:26] couldn't stomach it. It always had
[1:58:28] stomach issues and gastrointestinal
[1:58:30] problems and never could really feel
[1:58:33] comfortable. And the doctors probably
[1:58:35] prescribed all these things like you
[1:58:37] have gluten intolerance and all these
[1:58:39] other things in your life. But this
[1:58:41] eagle just couldn't stomach it. But they
[1:58:43] said, "It's good. Just eat it. Just eat
[1:58:45] it in the chicken yard." And eventually
[1:58:47] that eagle that was raised in the
[1:58:49] chicken yard eating chicken food, never
[1:58:52] ever being able to live their life good,
[1:58:54] heard the scream of the mama eagle.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Brham, he says
[1:58:58] this story, and it sounds funny. We've
[1:59:00] all heard it before, but he said, "Just
[1:59:02] jump one time.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Jump one time and flap your wings and
[1:59:07] see if you won't be able to reach your
[1:59:10] mama. see if you won't fly out of that
[1:59:12] chicken yard and come to the place of
[1:59:14] full deliverance.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "You watch your hearts now how
[1:59:20] you'll long to read the Bible." I love
[1:59:23] this. It's like a barometer for where
[1:59:25] we're at in our spiritual walk. He says,
[1:59:27] "You watch your hearts now. You'll long
[1:59:29] to read the Bible." How you'll want
[1:59:32] you'll want to get alone to talk to him
[1:59:34] and say, "Oh, Father, oh, I just love
[1:59:37] you."
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; That's the fellowship. See, That's what
[1:59:41] we need.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you think so, friends?
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "God bless you."
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; And I say, "God bless you today, too."
[1:59:48] Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[1:59:52] your word.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus, that one more
[1:59:56] time we could gather together in your
[1:59:58] name.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; And we could acknowledge you, Lord,
[2:00:02] Father, the way that you desire.
[2:00:05] And Lord Jesus, I just want to pray
[2:00:08] today for each and every one of us,
[2:00:09] Lord. If any one of us here today,
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; has approached this service any other
[2:00:15] way
[2:00:17] than the way that prostitute approached
[2:00:19] you that day.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that you would forgive us
[2:00:22] for it.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, let us never ever
[2:00:29] be like the Pharisee
[2:00:31] that had a perfect outward appearance
[2:00:34] but a defiled heart.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, help us to guard our hearts.
[2:00:38] Amen.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; With all that we've got,
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; help us to give our hearts wholly and
[2:00:45] completely to you, Lord Jesus.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Father, let us not live a life with a a
[2:00:51] defiled heart, Lord, with something
[2:00:52] that's not completely pure, just because
[2:00:55] we're not willing to let go of one or
[2:00:57] two things that maybe we think we know.
[2:00:59] Father, help us to just say, "Be it unto
[2:01:02] me according to your word."
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. and just allow your spirit to
[2:01:06] manifest through our lives. Lord Jesus,
[2:01:08] show us the things that we're afraid of.
[2:01:10] Father, help us, Lord Jesus, to
[2:01:12] recognize that it's not the things that
[2:01:14] we do. It's what you do through us,
[2:01:17] Father.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; That gives us success.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Father, we only are able to serve you
[2:01:23] because we surrender to you. Yes, Lord.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Father, we just Lord, I pray that you
[2:01:30] would, Father, walk with us as we leave
[2:01:32] this building, Father. That we wouldn't
[2:01:34] just leave your presence here, Lord.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Father, that the things we spoke about
[2:01:39] today would just resonate in our hearts,
[2:01:42] Lord. That we would desire a closer walk
[2:01:44] with you, Father.
[2:01:46] And Lord, I pray that if my heart has
[2:01:48] been unpure, that you would forgive me
[2:01:50] for it, Lord.
[2:01:52] I don't want to handle this word with
[2:01:54] unclean hands.
[2:01:56] I pray that if I have, Father, you would
[2:01:58] forgive me for it now and that you would
[2:02:00] just bless your children with a double
[2:02:02] portion, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:05] Father, we just love you and we thank
[2:02:07] you. We ask that you would be with us
[2:02:08] now. Lead us and guide us in all things.
[2:02:11] Lord, we pray that you would be with
[2:02:12] those who are maybe streaming now, who
[2:02:15] are away, Father, and those that might
[2:02:18] be tuning in later, whatever, wherever
[2:02:20] they are. Father, we pray that you would
[2:02:22] keep your hand upon them, that you would
[2:02:24] give them traveling mercies. Father,
[2:02:26] that you would bless them abundantly.
[2:02:29] Lord Jesus, we just love you and we
[2:02:31] thank you. We ask all these things now.
[2:02:34] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:02:39] Amen.
[2:02:42] Can we sing that song? What a day that
[2:02:44] will be. It's 471.
[2:02:50] What a day that will be.
[2:02:54] There is coming
[2:02:57] a day
[2:02:59] when no partachache
[2:03:02] shall come.
[2:03:06] In the sky,
[2:03:09] no more tears to dim the eye.
[2:03:14] All is peace forever more. on that happy
[2:03:21] golden shore.
[2:03:23] What a day, a glorious day that will be.
[2:03:32] What a day
[2:03:34] that will be.
[2:03:37] When my Jesus
[2:03:39] I shall see.
[2:03:42] When I look upon his face, that one who
[2:03:47] save me by his grace.
[2:03:51] When he takes me by the hand and leads
[2:03:56] me through the promised land. What a
[2:04:01] day, a glorious day
[2:04:05] that will be.
[2:04:10] No
[2:04:12] sorrow,
[2:04:14] no more
[2:04:17] to bear,
[2:04:18] no more sickness,
[2:04:21] no pain,
[2:04:23] no more party
[2:04:25] over there.
[2:04:28] And forever
[2:04:30] I will be
[2:04:32] with the one who died for me.
[2:04:37] What a day.
[2:04:39] Glorious day
[2:04:42] that will be.
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:46] What a day
[2:04:48] that will be
[2:04:51] when my Jesus
[2:04:53] I shall see.
[2:04:56] And I look upon his face. The one who
[2:05:01] save me by his grace.
[2:05:05] When he takes me by the hand and leads
[2:05:10] me to the promised land.
[2:05:14] What a day,
[2:05:16] glorious day
[2:05:19] that will be.
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:23] Amen.
[2:05:26] We just have a prayer request
[2:05:29] for three people that are going to
[2:05:31] depart from us.
[2:05:34] Sister Margaret Agala is going to return
[2:05:36] to Nigeria
[2:05:38] on Saturday, September the 27th,
[2:05:42] and Sister Rosie is heading to India, as
[2:05:46] I understand.
[2:05:48] Also, Sister Kik is heading back to
[2:05:51] Nigeria.
[2:05:53] And uh we just would like to have a word
[2:05:56] of prayer as a congregation for their
[2:05:59] traveling mercies.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[2:06:04] this morning we're so thankful that we
[2:06:06] are a a bride body, Lord. And
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; we know that it's all around the world,
[2:06:11] Father. It's not just located in one
[2:06:13] city or one town or one country. It's a
[2:06:17] many membered body, Lord.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're so thankful that we can
[2:06:22] be members of that body. And Father,
[2:06:26] this morning we just want to remember
