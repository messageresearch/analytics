[0:28] for
[0:58] for for
[1:58] what
[2:28] for for
[3:04] sound guys are doing a lot right now
[3:06] trying to get everything together so I'm
[3:07] going to give
[3:08] him give him a moment
[3:39] okay I'm getting the thumbs up so I
[3:43] think everything is ready to go ahead
[3:46] I'm a guy that likes to start on time if
[3:48] at all possible so I think we'll just
[3:51] let people kind of stream in as they get
[3:54] here but for now I recommend if you want
[3:58] to be able to read numbers when I have
[4:00] numbers up here the closer you sit the
[4:02] better that's why I asked all the young
[4:03] people to sit pretty close because there
[4:05] will be an Excel spreadsheet at some
[4:07] point and uh the numbers in there might
[4:10] be interesting to uh to use yeah that's
[4:13] fine I'm good with that uh okay
[4:17] so I'm just going to start off with a
[4:20] word of prayer if you would all just bow
[4:22] your heads with me for a
[4:24] moment dear gracious Heavenly Father
[4:26] Lord we thank you for this day thank you
[4:29] for the spiritual food this morning
[4:31] father I pray that you would just uh
[4:33] bless it to our souls help us to recall
[4:36] it father and uh to be inspired by it
[4:38] and go study it ourselves Lord and just
[4:41] live the word that you've given to us we
[4:43] pray that you'd also restore the
[4:44] minister strength father help him to be
[4:46] um re-energized and and uh enjoy the
[4:49] rest of his trip in Canada now Lord we
[4:52] just ask that you'd bless this little
[4:53] meeting that we have father knowing that
[4:56] I don't have any um any gifts to to
[4:59] preach or to teach Lord but I just have
[5:02] uh something that could be of use to
[5:03] some people Lord I ask that you would
[5:05] bless the service bless the words that I
[5:07] speak Lord help me to not mislead or say
[5:09] anything that would be incorrect father
[5:11] and I pray that you would just bless it
[5:12] to the people as they listen we love you
[5:15] father and we ask all these things in
[5:16] Jesus name
[5:19] amen okay so I'm not used to this format
[5:23] I'm very usually a a dynamic
[5:27] conversational presenter um I think I'm
[5:30] gonna try to keep this as as close to a
[5:34] a church service format just because of
[5:36] the fact that we're in the sanctuary
[5:39] normally I would totally want banter and
[5:43] back and forth conversation but I think
[5:45] today we'll keep it relatively one-sided
[5:47] and at the end I'm going to stop the
[5:50] stream and then we'll go into a Q&A and
[5:53] I'll also be sharing um our personal
[5:55] budget and just kind of what it looks
[5:56] like when it's done and you've finished
[5:58] you've been put it a year of numbers and
[6:00] how you can use that data to kind of you
[6:02] make decisions and and track your own
[6:04] progress
[6:06] so um guys at the back just give me a
[6:10] wave if something doesn't make sense
[6:12] that you're seeing because I'm going to
[6:14] be looking at my screen mostly more so
[6:16] than your
[6:18] screen
[6:19] okay so very very early in uh my walk
[6:25] with the Lord this was one of the first
[6:28] scriptures I think
[6:30] that I I understood what a revelation
[6:33] felt like when it was no longer me just
[6:36] reading it and hearing it but it was
[6:38] something that was so real to me that it
[6:40] changed the rest of my life and um I
[6:43] want to start with this so I'll read the
[6:45] full scripture here most of the
[6:46] scriptures I'm going to paraphrase
[6:47] because there's quite a few of them and
[6:49] I I don't want this to be uh hours of of
[6:52] length um I'll keep it to maybe half an
[6:55] hour longer than the service this
[6:57] morning just kidding
[7:01] okay so Matthew 6:30 uh 6:
[7:05] 30-34 wherefore if God so clothe the
[7:08] grass of the field which is today and
[7:09] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[7:12] not much more clothe you oh ye of little
[7:15] faith therefore take no thought saying
[7:17] what shall we eat or what shall we drink
[7:19] or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for
[7:22] after all these things do the Gentiles
[7:24] seek for your heavenly father knoweth
[7:26] that you have need of these things but
[7:28] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[7:31] righteousness and all these things shall
[7:33] be added unto you therefore take no
[7:35] thought for the moral for the morrow
[7:37] shall take thought for the things of
[7:39] itself sufficient unto the day is the
[7:41] evil
[7:42] thereof so just keep this in mind with
[7:46] everything we talk about today I'm going
[7:48] to show you as quickly as I can that
[7:51] there is a lot of scripture that talks
[7:53] about your money and a lot of scripture
[7:55] that proves that God is very interested
[7:56] in it and he wants you to um
[8:00] to to be successful materially and
[8:03] spiritually a lot of times we tend to
[8:05] shy away from talking about the
[8:07] blessings naturally but it's it's it's
[8:10] not God does not ask you to be destitute
[8:13] to be spiritually successful and um I
[8:16] want to show that to you but I also want
[8:18] to just everything to be filtered
[8:20] through this context at the end of the
[8:22] day no matter what advice you take from
[8:25] me if you seek first the kingdom of God
[8:28] and his righteousness everything that
[8:30] you have need of is going to be added to
[8:31] you and um like I say this is the first
[8:34] scripture that was made completely real
[8:36] to me um divinely and it changed the
[8:39] rest of my life this was right before I
[8:41] got married and um I'm so thankful to
[8:44] God for it so I believe that God doesn't
[8:47] want you to be stressed about earning a
[8:48] living as we'll soon read God is not
[8:51] telling us to have no plan for our
[8:53] finances uh but he's telling us to not
[8:56] let it consume our minds and I think
[8:58] that's what this scripture talks talks
[8:59] about when it says um you know don't uh
[9:03] take no thought saying what shall we eat
[9:04] or what shall we drink it doesn't mean
[9:06] don't literally plan at all for what
[9:07] you're doing it means don't be consumed
[9:10] by these things don't let materialism
[9:12] become the ruler in your life if we seek
[9:15] Him First and follow his principles
[9:17] he'll take care of us the scripture
[9:19] establishes why we shouldn't be praying
[9:21] for wealth just as a means to no end but
[9:24] we should be praying for
[9:27] Revelation so
[9:30] um I'm going to briefly paraphrase a few
[9:32] of these scriptures so Matthew 25:1
[9:35] 14-29 this is the parable of the man who
[9:38] gave talents to his three servants I
[9:40] think we're all pretty familiar with
[9:41] this one so two of them invested it and
[9:45] uh they had returns that they gave back
[9:47] to their master and he rewarded them for
[9:49] that and then the third one just hid it
[9:51] he didn't make any return he did not
[9:53] invest what the the gifts and the
[9:54] talents that God had given him so I
[9:57] think this is a very important lesson
[9:59] for us um Luke 16:10 it says he that's
[10:03] faithful in that in that which is the
[10:05] least is also faithful in much he that
[10:08] is unjust in least is also unjust in in
[10:11] much so I believe we're accountable to
[10:13] God for how we use the blessings that he
[10:15] gives us and a quick like um maybe
[10:20] example of this would be you know you
[10:23] get your first job and that God has
[10:25] blessed you with a job some sort of
[10:27] income and immediately you spend every
[10:29] paycheck without thinking about how
[10:32] you're going to be off in like 6 months
[10:34] 12 months 6 years if you're looking for
[10:36] a family you're not providing for that
[10:38] family you're not preparing for the
[10:39] family to come I believe that is
[10:42] somebody that is not being faithful in
[10:43] the least and how is God going to trust
[10:46] you with what you think is going to be a
[10:48] very successful opulent career if you
[10:51] can't even use this basic you know
[10:54] $2,000 a month income to to do what God
[10:57] calls of you so
[10:59] from day one as soon as you get your
[11:01] first income for me I don't want to make
[11:04] this about me but I want to just
[11:06] demonstrate that I'm I have practiced
[11:08] these principles for many many years um
[11:11] when I got a paper route uh I was nine
[11:15] eight something like that very young and
[11:18] I was very accountable to my clients
[11:21] made had to make sure that we were up at
[11:23] the right time every day that we
[11:24] delivered the paper I had a flyer route
[11:26] so it was much less stressful than a
[11:28] real real paper route but
[11:30] um I and I saved that money I didn't
[11:32] have a a structure like I do now but it
[11:34] was just intrinsically my parents had
[11:36] kind of ingrained this thing into us
[11:37] where don't spend everything you make
[11:39] there wasn't like a a ideal amount to
[11:42] spend or save it just don't spend
[11:43] everything so we did and I saved it and
[11:46] I think that's um being being faithful
[11:48] in the least uh Galatians 6 verse 7 and8
[11:52] says be not deceived God is Not mocked
[11:56] what a man Seth that shall he reap
[11:58] that's the paraphrase of that of that
[12:00] scripture so what I interpret this as is
[12:04] be intentional with your
[12:05] resources all of them your money your
[12:08] time your health your spiritual and
[12:10] natural gifts that God has given to you
[12:12] because as you sew with those gifts
[12:14] that's how you're going to reap later
[12:19] on so um although we're talking about
[12:22] finances and money and God wants us to
[12:24] prosper getting rich just for the sake
[12:26] of materialism is not the goal he
[12:29] Hebrews
[12:31] 13:5 don't let your conversations be
[12:34] jealous be content with what you have uh
[12:37] God said that I will never leave thee
[12:40] nor nor forsake thee
[12:43] so don't let jealousy and comparison rob
[12:47] you of your current Joy Crystal has a
[12:49] saying that I really like which is
[12:50] comparison is the thief of Joy because
[12:53] we can be content with whatever we have
[12:55] when we when our lives are ruled by the
[12:57] Holy Ghost but if you let
[12:59] income and money and cars or clothes
[13:02] become your God that is what's going to
[13:05] consume you and that's what you're going
[13:06] to think about that's what you're going
[13:07] to look at you're when you see somebody
[13:09] else you're always going to equalize
[13:10] well where do I rank compared to him or
[13:12] her and it's a horrible place to be and
[13:14] even though I believe I got that
[13:15] Revelation very early on of um seek
[13:18] first the kingdom of God this absolutely
[13:21] consumed me when I was um in in banking
[13:24] because I was always around my peers who
[13:26] were doing the same thing as me but I
[13:28] was going going like this and I felt
[13:30] like they were going like that and um it
[13:32] was really hard not to be comparing all
[13:34] the time and thinking well I deserve
[13:36] more um but really I had so much more
[13:40] because I I was the only one that had a
[13:42] family I was married with a wife and a
[13:44] kid and uh like ultimately that was
[13:47] worth way more and I wouldn't trade
[13:49] places with anybody but I kept on
[13:50] focusing on this one narrow Slice of
[13:52] Life and I think that's a a horrible
[13:54] Trap Of Satan to get
[13:56] into Matthew 16 or sorry 6 19- 21
[14:01] paraphrasing uh don't lay up your
[14:03] Treasures on Earth where moth corrupts
[14:05] and thieves steal lay up your Treasures
[14:06] in Heaven uh because where your treasure
[14:09] is your heart will be also so again just
[14:11] getting rich is not the goal here 1
[14:14] Timothy um I think I've got the whole
[14:16] scripture written out here because I
[14:18] couldn't think of an effective way to
[14:19] paraphrase it charge them that are rich
[14:21] in this world that they be not high-m
[14:23] minded nor trust in uncertain riches but
[14:26] in the Living God who giveth us richly
[14:28] to all things to to enjoy that they do
[14:31] good that they be rich in Good Works
[14:33] ready to distribute willing to
[14:35] communicate laying up in store for
[14:37] themselves a good foundation against the
[14:39] time to come that they may hold lay hold
[14:42] on eternal life so I believe with when
[14:45] you have the Holy Ghost and and you
[14:47] acquire wealth it does not create Pride
[14:50] if it does I think there's a lot of
[14:52] proof in where your heart really is if
[14:55] you think that you're a big shot because
[14:56] of what you're driving or because of
[14:58] where you're vacationing or what your
[15:00] house um it really shows where where
[15:04] your heart is because where your heart
[15:05] is that's where your treasure is going
[15:07] to be in your mind but um when you do
[15:11] get blessed if you have a a a heart for
[15:15] the body of Christ it really creates a
[15:17] desire to share not in like a socialist
[15:21] way in like a directing to needs way so
[15:23] if you see a need and you have a
[15:25] resource that would address that need
[15:28] it's a beautiful thing to be able to go
[15:29] out directly you don't have to talk to
[15:31] anybody else you don't need to to ask
[15:33] for a donation or a support from the
[15:35] church you can go directly to that
[15:37] person either um uh face to face or you
[15:41] can do it anonymously and it's a
[15:43] wonderful blessing to be able to have
[15:46] the the key for somebody else's lock and
[15:49] be able to get them through a certain
[15:50] situation or scenario and I believe that
[15:52] if you become wealthy with the Holy
[15:54] Ghost your life will go through that
[15:57] cycle often because you'll find that
[15:58] there's other people that you that you
[16:00] see that have needs that you can
[16:02] address Proverbs
[16:04] 11:28 he that trusts in his riches shall
[16:07] fall but the righteous shall flourish as
[16:09] a branch so as Believers we can't secure
[16:12] our future with just wealth you know um
[16:15] brother Nest just said it today you can
[16:17] have all these things in the world and
[16:18] lose them all tomorrow that's not up to
[16:21] you that's up to God and his plan for
[16:22] you so all blessings are from God and he
[16:25] alone knows what our future holds
[16:33] so I believe this is kind of a a lot of
[16:35] scripture I'm not going to read through
[16:37] all of them but this again talks to the
[16:41] importance of using your blessings to
[16:43] bless other people whether it's with
[16:45] music whether it's with Ministry whether
[16:47] it's with you know a gift of U maybe I I
[16:50] see I see Gifts of mothering Gifts of
[16:52] fathering mentorship Gifts of wealth and
[16:55] resources all of these gifts can be used
[16:58] in the body effectively and I think
[17:00] that's what every one of us is called to
[17:01] do and that applies equally to those who
[17:04] have um who have uh
[17:09] wealth
[17:10] so rounding out some of the scriptures
[17:13] here budgeting is in fact a scriptural
[17:17] principle does anybody know when the
[17:19] first time a budget was used in the
[17:21] Bible it's kind of on the slide
[17:24] but I thought it was fascinating when I
[17:26] was just looking it up Jo
[17:29] when he had uh interpreted Pharaoh's
[17:32] dream of the seven years of famine and
[17:34] the seven years of plenty what did he
[17:35] tell them to do he said make a budget
[17:39] put up this amount for the seven years
[17:41] and this amount for the next seven years
[17:43] and if you do that right as this
[17:45] depletes you'll have this Surplus that
[17:47] will deplete as well and you'll end up
[17:48] at the end with what you what you needed
[17:51] and they save their nation and many
[17:54] other nations as well just because they
[17:56] were the only ones wise enough to Budget
[17:58] on a national level for the future um so
[18:02] I I I firmly believe that the the Bible
[18:04] teaches us the importance of of
[18:06] budgeting with your
[18:07] resources uh Proverbs 21:20 says there's
[18:10] no treasure to be desired and oil in the
[18:13] dwelling of the wise but a foolish man
[18:28] lot of times that That's essential
[18:30] especially in Calgary on one income it's
[18:32] very very hard to have Surplus at the
[18:34] end what I'm talking about is you're not
[18:37] just frivolously spending it you have a
[18:39] plan for where that money is going to go
[18:41] and that includes tithing and
[18:44] savings Luke
[18:45] 16:10 he that's faithful in the least is
[18:48] faithful in much and he that's unjust in
[18:49] the least is unjust in much I think we
[18:51] went through that one already so
[18:53] whenever you can find something to be
[18:55] thankful for Joy is always possible and
[18:58] I think no matter what your
[18:59] circumstances we talked about this a
[19:01] little bit on the car right here today
[19:03] is uh no matter where you are you you
[19:06] can have joy that you're gods that your
[19:08] soul is owned by by Christ no matter
[19:12] where you are what kind of health
[19:13] condition you have so at the very base
[19:15] level I believe we have a reason to have
[19:17] joy doesn't mean you're not going to be
[19:19] sad sometimes but you still have the joy
[19:21] of the Lord in your heart and if you
[19:23] apply that principle to scripture as or
[19:25] sorry to to your finances as well no
[19:27] matter what income you're making uh you
[19:29] can have joy and and and gratitude for
[19:32] where you
[19:34] are oh man I'm trying to get through
[19:37] these as quick as I can uh 1 Timothy 6:
[19:42] 6-10 godliness with contentment is great
[19:45] gain for we brought nothing into this
[19:47] world and it's certain we can bring
[19:49] nothing out having food and rment let us
[19:51] therewith be content for they that will
[19:54] be rich fall into temptation and a snare
[19:56] and into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[19:58] which drown men in destruction and
[20:00] predition For the Love of Money is the
[20:03] root of all evil which while some
[20:06] coveted after they have aired from the
[20:08] faith and pierced them through
[20:09] themselves through with many
[20:11] Sorrows isn't that an incredible
[20:13] statement that the love of money is the
[20:16] root of all evil you can boil
[20:19] down any motivations that are evil and
[20:23] find money somewhere in the root of it
[20:26] uh it's an amazing thought so money is
[20:29] not good or bad on its own it's the love
[20:31] of money that makes it evil it's what
[20:34] you do with what you're given that
[20:36] determines the morality of it and I've
[20:38] said before that you know if you have
[20:40] $100 and you buy a Bible or a pack of
[20:42] cigarettes that's not the $100 fault
[20:44] that's the user and what you're planning
[20:46] to do with it so the don't think of
[20:48] money itself as an evil thing to talk
[20:50] about or an evil thing to own it's how
[20:52] you use it that's important attitude is
[20:54] what will determine whether the money is
[20:56] good or evil in your life
[21:00] and in that in that regard I would just
[21:01] quickly throw in a little uh I talk
[21:03] about this a lot in youth group is
[21:05] mentorship find somebody who can mentor
[21:08] you if you if you don't want to talk to
[21:09] your parents about this for some reason
[21:11] find somebody else who you respect but I
[21:13] think your parents should be your very
[21:15] first Avenue to talk about money at an
[21:17] early age the second you start making a
[21:19] little bit of money I don't want I'm not
[21:21] teaching this I'm just as an example we
[21:23] do give a tiny allowance to our kids and
[21:26] they have responsibilities every day of
[21:28] the week and big chores on the weekend
[21:30] and if they complete those every week
[21:31] they get a little paycheck and it's like
[21:33] uh a dollar for each year so um like
[21:36] Elias would get $10 but then he has to
[21:38] take savings off of that he has to take
[21:40] tithing off of that and then he's
[21:42] allowed to do what he wants with the
[21:43] rest live on it so um I think having
[21:46] some mentorship at an early age will
[21:49] affect your attitude towards money going
[21:51] into the future that's just a little
[21:54] little drop for
[21:55] free I think these are my last
[21:57] scriptures here um so just kind of
[22:01] getting now into some fundamental
[22:02] financial principles I have been just
[22:06] applying you know my thoughts towards
[22:09] money for years and I never thought they
[22:11] were scriptural I just knew somewhere in
[22:13] my heart these were not against
[22:15] scripture the way I was using my money
[22:17] was not against the word of God but I
[22:20] found it to be very uh enlightening and
[22:23] relieving to find that there's actually
[22:25] a lot of scripture that tells you what
[22:26] to do with your money and how like
[22:28] budgeting how to plan with your money
[22:30] how to invest and make a return from it
[22:32] tithing um giving to other people your
[22:35] attitude to Mort's money so it's it's
[22:37] really amazing to find out that it's not
[22:39] just the Bible's telling you how not to
[22:42] use your money but there's actually a
[22:43] lot of lessons in in what you can be
[22:46] doing and I think um that gives me a lot
[22:48] of
[22:49] Peace uh so Malachi 3: 10-1 this is the
[22:54] one that talks about tithes and
[22:56] offerings so the bringing the my ti into
[22:58] my Storehouse that there may be meat in
[23:01] my Storehouse and then I will pour out a
[23:03] blessing that you can't
[23:05] contain and yes that's definitely
[23:07] spiritual we've said it many times but I
[23:10] believe there's also a natural blessing
[23:11] in that and um for Crystal and I we have
[23:15] a lot of evidence of that many many
[23:18] scenarios where we had to make a we
[23:21] didn't have to make a choice I'll will
[23:23] rephrase that because we always knew the
[23:25] first thing that happens to our our
[23:26] paycheck is it went to tithes we just
[23:28] have that carved out immediately at the
[23:30] top but there was many times when there
[23:33] wasn't enough money left for everything
[23:35] else and um that was really stressful
[23:38] very very stressful uh but we always
[23:40] found that we had a little bit of
[23:42] something somewhere that we forgotten
[23:45] not money for example groceries we had a
[23:49] car problem and we had already paid our
[23:51] tithes now we had to pay this mechanic
[23:54] it was due when we picked up the car so
[23:57] we only had one car
[23:59] and then we had nothing left for
[24:00] groceries that month uh very little like
[24:02] a couple maybe $100 but we had a pantry
[24:06] and we had a lot of canned stuff so we
[24:09] ate through our whole Pantry for a month
[24:12] just to make sure that we didn't use our
[24:14] line of credit we had a line of credit
[24:16] as like a last case scenario but we
[24:18] didn't want to put groceries on our on
[24:20] our credit um so uh I think God has
[24:24] blessed those kinds of decisions down
[24:26] the road is um I'm not saying that it's
[24:28] a sin to use your line of credit I'm
[24:29] just saying the attitude for us was
[24:31] first pay the tithes before everything
[24:33] else and in fact um again I'm not
[24:37] teaching this I don't have any Doctrine
[24:38] to bring I'm not a preacher and and I'm
[24:41] just saying some examples some some
[24:43] things to maybe think about uh when
[24:45] you're paying your
[24:46] tithes do you pay Justin Trudeau first
[24:49] or do you pay God first uh just
[24:51] something to think about um there is uh
[24:54] I think there can be a blessing in
[24:55] tithing on your gross but uh again it's
[24:58] not not not a principle that I'm I'm
[25:00] saying is is Doctrine or anything like
[25:03] that um Proverbs 99 is
[25:08] uh oh I don't think I actually
[25:10] summarized this one
[25:12] um but uh it's um Solomon talking about
[25:17] the importance of giving wisdom to
[25:19] people when you have some knowledge when
[25:22] you have a resource like I've said
[25:23] before passing it around to people
[25:25] around you um this is a Biblical
[25:27] principle and and uh that's kind of I
[25:31] guess why I feel okay uh teaching this
[25:34] in the in the church because I do
[25:36] believe that God uh cares about it and
[25:37] it's very
[25:39] important so one of dad's friends kind
[25:42] of told us this term and I think it's
[25:45] really important uh but it was John
[25:46] Wesley that coined the term make all you
[25:48] can save all you can and give all you
[25:51] can and that's in he I think he actually
[25:53] says that's an order as well if I'm not
[25:55] mistaken so if you're giving all you can
[25:57] but you're not making all you can your
[26:00] family is going to be in rough shape um
[26:02] and if you're again if you're giving all
[26:04] you can but you're not saving you're
[26:06] going to be in rough shape uh God can
[26:08] provide but it's not uh there's a saying
[26:11] don't bet the farm when it's coming up
[26:13] to an investment or a risk don't bet
[26:15] your nest egg don't bet don't make an
[26:17] investment or take a risk with your
[26:18] money that could hinder your family this
[26:21] is to some older people maybe not so
[26:23] much the young people on that one um but
[26:25] you don't want to take risks with your
[26:27] money that are that are
[26:28] um that are unsure unless it's money
[26:31] that you can afford to just give away or
[26:34] lose so now getting down to some initial
[26:38] numbers tithing obviously we say 10 10%
[26:41] tithing and then offering is in addition
[26:43] to the tithing um minimize your taxes
[26:47] and then save 10% and whatever is left
[26:51] that's your remainder so when we get
[26:52] into the budget here we're going to talk
[26:54] about that of how to start with your
[26:57] your income and and then all these uh
[26:59] these numbers will make sense as you as
[27:01] you build your budget up I also believe
[27:03] that it's important to make goals
[27:05] annually and review them regularly um
[27:07] before you make your budget probably
[27:09] important to review some of your goals
[27:11] with and if you're married with your
[27:12] spouse for example a few years ago
[27:14] Crystal and I uh we needed a car Crystal
[27:18] wanted a larger vehicle because she was
[27:19] transporting the kids to school and she
[27:21] was also noticing that we're often
[27:23] transporting kids to and from youth
[27:24] events and she wanted a larger vehicle
[27:27] to be able to hold all those people
[27:28] people we said this will probably cost
[27:30] $30 to $40,000 if we if we get a a nice
[27:33] one that is bigger than what we have now
[27:37] and we didn't have the money for that
[27:38] obviously at that time so we put it into
[27:40] our budget and we made a plan for I
[27:44] forget what the timeline was let's say a
[27:46] year to save up enough so that we had a
[27:49] good down payment and a deposit on a
[27:51] vehicle so that we could afford the loan
[27:54] and um that's what we did so at the
[27:56] beginning of the year we had a line for
[27:58] short-term savings maybe you know $300 a
[28:01] month or whatever it was to go towards
[28:03] this vehicle and um I think that's why
[28:06] it's important to make your goals and
[28:07] review them before you start your budget
[28:09] because you might get three months in
[28:11] and realize oh yeah I was planning to do
[28:13] this thing or if you're saving up for a
[28:15] house that's a big one uh start putting
[28:18] money aside for that now and um and stay
[28:21] with your parents a bit longer that's
[28:24] the best financial advice I can give you
[28:29] okay so um for some people this is going
[28:33] to be incredibly basic sorry to you
[28:36] folks but uh to others it's shocking
[28:40] that none of this is talked about in in
[28:43] mandatory curriculum at least when I
[28:44] went to high school none of this was
[28:46] mandatory you could learn a little bit
[28:48] about budgeting if you took some
[28:50] curricular extracurricular courses but
[28:52] who did that not me so credit cards are
[28:56] definitely a trap if you're not
[28:58] disciplined and how to use them so for
[29:00] my quick example
[29:04] here you put $1,000 on your credit
[29:08] card the typically the lowest minimum
[29:11] payment that I've seen is around I think
[29:13] 4% of the
[29:14] balance uh and that is evil to make that
[29:17] the minimum payment because it it
[29:19] entraps you and that is the purpose is
[29:21] to allow people to over leverage
[29:23] themselves with interest rate that they
[29:25] don't even understand into a commit that
[29:28] they don't even need and then they're
[29:30] paying for it 4 years so if you pay that
[29:34] 4% um payment it'll take you three years
[29:38] to pay off
[29:40] $1,000 that's if you don't spend a cent
[29:43] another Cent on that credit card in the
[29:45] reality people are spending every month
[29:48] and paying their minimum payment and
[29:49] their balance keeps going like this and
[29:51] it becomes you know those bell curves
[29:53] where that just starts accelerating and
[29:55] it gets out of control and then you find
[29:57] yourself with with you know
[29:59] $118,000 in useless credit that you
[30:01] didn't even uh want and it's just
[30:04] because you know you spent an ex $0000
[30:06] here and there every month so in
[30:10] addition to the balance that you
[30:11] borrowed the $1,000 it'll cost you
[30:14] another $350 of interest if you make
[30:16] that minimum payment that's with today's
[30:19] interest rates about 22% is the average
[30:22] interest rate uh sorry 20 to 23% is the
[30:25] average interest rate on a credit card
[30:28] so that means on $1,000 you're paying
[30:29] $200 of interest every year just to have
[30:33] it there so the moral of the story is
[30:36] never ever ever buy something on a
[30:38] credit card if you cannot pay it off
[30:41] immediately um and I am an advocate of
[30:45] credit cards I know there's a lot of
[30:46] Dave Dave Ramsey listeners and I believe
[30:49] he's very anti-red card and I am anti-
[30:52] immaturity with your money uh if you're
[30:55] not financially responsible if you don't
[30:57] have the maturity to discipline your
[30:58] spending then yes don't get a don't get
[31:01] a credit card it's it's the worst trap
[31:04] you can probably set for yourself um
[31:06] imagine you're wanting to propose to
[31:09] somebody and and you haven't told them
[31:11] yet that you have $10,000 of credit card
[31:13] debt that's going to be a hard pill to
[31:16] swallow um so when uh when you're
[31:20] starting out I
[31:22] recommend if you can get a credit card
[31:25] when you turn 18 if if if you can can do
[31:28] some of the things I'm going to tell you
[31:29] here don't panic so if you turn when you
[31:32] turn 18 get a credit card with like a
[31:34] $500 limit that's typically a student
[31:37] credit card um they will usually approve
[31:40] you on your own but it might even be an
[31:43] okay idea to get your parents to coign
[31:46] what that does is it unfortunately ties
[31:48] them to your debt so if you default
[31:50] they're going to have to pay for it but
[31:52] what it also usually gives them is a is
[31:54] access to your statement so they can
[31:56] review your transaction
[31:58] and they can see what you've got as a
[31:59] balance and they can make sure that at
[32:01] the end of each month you've paid it off
[32:04] don't make your parents do that but it's
[32:07] not a bad idea to have them on there so
[32:08] that you have some accountability in the
[32:10] back of your head hey my my dad might
[32:12] check this at any time I better be
[32:14] paying this off uh but if you get it
[32:17] when you turn
[32:18] 18 you prepay this so for example say
[32:21] you need to buy $100 of uh of uh clothes
[32:24] or something you can put $100 on your
[32:27] credit card to day and then go buy the
[32:29] clothes tomorrow and make a rule with
[32:31] yourself that you'll never spend more
[32:33] than what you've paid already so this
[32:36] essentially makes your credit card like
[32:38] um uh like a bit of a a cash like in
[32:41] your pocket you only have $100 in your
[32:43] pocket you can't fabricate more cash on
[32:46] the spot you've got to stick to what
[32:48] you've got so if you do that to yourself
[32:50] with your credit card you can prepay
[32:51] $100 and just you got to be disciplined
[32:54] but it's it's really valuable in the
[32:56] long term um you're only going to spend
[32:58] what you've prepaid and uh if you have a
[33:01] budget that's not that hard to do but
[33:04] again takes discipline so sometimes an
[33:06] accountability partner like your parents
[33:07] is a good idea just to know that they
[33:09] can check on you and make sure that
[33:11] you're staying on track Never carry a
[33:14] balance ever ever ever whatever you have
[33:16] to do uh sell something if you have to
[33:19] don't even start because it sounds like
[33:21] a little thing to have a $100 balance
[33:23] but it's the principle that it enables
[33:26] that's really destructive get a l of
[33:28] credit if you absolutely need credit for
[33:30] something maybe you're going to school
[33:32] maybe um you you know you're going
[33:34] through a career transition or you're
[33:36] moving you might actually need some
[33:38] credit I'm not against any credit I'm
[33:39] just against credit cards having credit
[33:42] that's absolutely the worst worst way to
[33:44] have it um payday loans as well I I hope
[33:47] I don't have to mention them but I will
[33:49] never ever look at payday loans they're
[33:51] worse than credit
[33:52] cards um review your statement each
[33:55] month ensure you're not carrying a
[33:57] balance
[33:58] and if you are maybe you forgot or you
[34:00] miscalculated pay that before it's due
[34:02] so I get my credit card statements on
[34:04] like the 15th of the month and I think
[34:06] they're due on like the third of the
[34:07] next month you usually have about 20
[34:09] days to pay your balance which is
[34:11] actually amazing um that's I think some
[34:14] of the some of the great things about
[34:15] credit cards is um uh actually maybe
[34:19] I'll just go through some of the the
[34:20] things that I I've put together as
[34:24] benefits um they they give you credit
[34:27] rate
[34:28] which is going to be really important
[34:29] when you try to get your first mortgage
[34:30] or a student loan or something like that
[34:32] they give you access to oper to things
[34:35] like booking a hotel room renting a car
[34:37] you can't do that these days without a
[34:39] credit card um they also teach you a
[34:41] little bit of you know Financial
[34:43] budgeting discipline that kind of stuff
[34:45] uh but also the perks Crystal and I take
[34:47] a vacation about every two years and we
[34:49] don't pay for anything and that's
[34:51] because we use the points that we've
[34:53] used for our credit card we buy
[34:55] everything on credit card that we can
[34:56] now because we're you know we've got a
[34:58] budget we've been doing this for decades
[35:01] but um well not quite decades but
[35:03] getting close um and uh yeah at the end
[35:07] of two years we have X thousands of
[35:08] points and we just say okay where can we
[35:10] go for these points for free and last
[35:13] time we went to Mexico I think and
[35:16] stayed in the we got the flights and the
[35:18] hotel with no expense because of the
[35:21] points and it didn't cost us anything to
[35:23] do that that's all the people that use
[35:25] credit cards and pay interest paying for
[35:27] my Hotel
[35:29] um yeah so don't pay for my hotel please
[35:32] let other people do that um so finally
[35:37] about interest rates
[35:40] here for those who don't know um all
[35:43] loans have different interest rates you
[35:45] need to understand what they are before
[35:47] you commit to it 22 23% is for credit
[35:50] cards that's extremely high the lowest
[35:53] loans you can get right now in today's
[35:55] market are probably about like 5 to 6%
[35:57] that's for a mortgage where you have a
[36:00] house securing the loan there's almost
[36:02] no way to get cheaper debt than a
[36:04] mortgage um so anywhere between 5 and
[36:06] 23% is what you're going to be paying
[36:09] you always want the lowest rate possible
[36:12] um if the if the payments are a bit
[36:14] harder you should you should just make a
[36:16] budget that's going to include that
[36:18] because sometimes you'll get a shorter
[36:20] term maybe two years at a lower interest
[36:23] rate versus 5 years at a higher interest
[36:26] rate the 5year plan might sound nice if
[36:28] you've got lower payments but if you
[36:31] can't afford the 2-year and uh your pay
[36:33] your interest rate is going to be 15% or
[36:35] something crazy uh I think you I think
[36:38] you should reconsider that that
[36:40] proposition in my opinion this is not
[36:42] again
[36:43] Doctrine if you're paying over like 7 to
[36:47] % for anything you should probably just
[36:50] not do that um it's it's way too high uh
[36:54] if you're a student you can usually get
[36:56] a parent to coign on something for like
[36:58] a student loan not for cars I mean for
[37:01] student loans and those will have
[37:03] relatively low interest rates because
[37:04] they know students don't have a ton of
[37:05] money this is actually like a like a
[37:07] gift from the government to allow
[37:09] students to borrow and go to school and
[37:12] not have crazy loans at the end of the
[37:14] at the end of the term um so student
[37:16] loans are actually relatively affordable
[37:18] um most of the time and I'm I'm
[37:20] definitely okay with them if if you're
[37:22] using it for what it's meant
[37:26] for okay
[37:28] if you have questions please just hold
[37:31] them I I I just want to not take your
[37:34] entire day here so I'm trying to Blitz
[37:35] through am I going too fast is is it
[37:39] making any kind of sense
[37:42] okay there's a lot more detail we can go
[37:44] into on these and if you want follow up
[37:48] just talk to me afterwards and we can we
[37:50] can follow up on any topic or we can
[37:52] have a
[37:52] one-on-one I would love to Mentor
[37:55] anybody who thinks that I can be use ful
[37:57] to you um I I don't think I'm exemplary
[38:02] in any specific Mark uh but I'm happy to
[38:07] provide input and and advice and uh
[38:09] mentorship to anybody who was looking
[38:10] for
[38:11] it okay so I think I only have a couple
[38:14] more slides but these ones are going to
[38:16] be a bit longer um because we're
[38:18] actually getting into building a budget
[38:20] now so this slide kind of summarizes the
[38:24] process of building your budget and
[38:26] Crystal and I go through this every year
[38:29] um we've been doing it
[38:30] for 16 17 years now so it's uh it's
[38:34] gotten a lot easier now we take last
[38:36] year's budget we estimate the future for
[38:39] this year I I mine's complicated because
[38:42] my income is variable so I have to take
[38:44] a like a couple of days to calculate my
[38:47] income but most of you will probably
[38:49] just have some sort of hourly wage or a
[38:51] salary or a projected summer job that
[38:53] you're going to get and you just got to
[38:56] estimate how much am I going to make on
[38:57] average going forward for this year
[39:00] start with that that's the first thing
[39:01] you need so um I'm going to briefly talk
[39:06] about gross versus Net Income because
[39:08] we're going to use net income on our
[39:10] budget so you start with your gross
[39:13] which is say you make uh I looked this
[39:15] up actually in Calgary the mean salary
[39:20] annual income for a single income earner
[39:24] is $65,000 a year so income
[39:27] the average single income is 65,000 a
[39:32] year when when you pay your
[39:34] taxes uh what what is that a
[39:38] month 5,000 I I should have known that
[39:42] yeah I think you're right 5,000 a month
[39:45] is uh what that uh comes out to but
[39:48] after you pay your taxes you're probably
[39:51] at roughly 4,200 a month that's what I
[39:54] estimated um that's that's pretty
[39:56] aggressive actually you might even be
[39:57] closer to 4,000 if you have CPP and any
[40:01] kind of um benefits or if you have an
[40:04] investment plan which is a great thing
[40:06] by the way with your employer your
[40:08] income could be lower so it's hard right
[40:12] now I've got to be honest in Calgary
[40:14] even on $65,000 a year it's going to be
[40:17] tough to live on your own uh and we'll
[40:20] show that I worked on these numbers for
[40:24] a long time to make them balance and uh
[40:27] um it's not easy
[40:30] so again my advice is if 65,000 just
[40:34] sounds crazy to you because that's a lot
[40:36] of money to be making in a year uh or if
[40:40] you're making 65,000 or more and you
[40:42] still can't find a place to live with
[40:44] your budget you got a room you got a
[40:46] roommate with somebody find a find a
[40:48] partner somebody that you can uh co-
[40:51] rent with or stay with your
[40:54] parents if at all possible stay with
[40:56] your parents that's the moral of the
[40:58] story um and pay them rent
[41:03] though so you've got your gross income
[41:06] of 65,000 a year you deduct you
[41:10] subtract your benefits from your
[41:13] employer if you have uh co-share co-p
[41:15] paid benefits your EI which is
[41:17] Employment Insurance that's mandatory if
[41:19] you're making a Sal like any kind of
[41:21] hourly rate you're going to have a uh
[41:23] employment insurance that goes to the
[41:24] government in case you ever lose your
[41:26] job CP p is mandatory as well that's
[41:28] Canadian pension plan um and then after
[41:32] that you deduct your taxes this should
[41:35] all be on your paycheck by the way but
[41:37] it won't be on your offer letter you'll
[41:39] get an offer letter that'll say this big
[41:40] juicy
[41:41] $65,000 and you won't really understand
[41:44] that it's actually 50,000 after taxes
[41:46] and uh and
[41:48] deductions if your employ I don't have
[41:50] this on here but if your employer has
[41:52] any kind of investment matching plan
[41:54] sometimes they'll have um pensions or
[41:56] they'll have RSP matching always try to
[42:00] make that work there were times where we
[42:02] couldn't afford it we didn't have the
[42:04] enough enough to pay for the whole um
[42:07] shared investment portion and you're
[42:09] kind of almost get robbing yourself
[42:12] because uh a good return on the stock
[42:14] market on average is about 7 to
[42:16] 8% and your employer is offering you
[42:20] 100% on day one that'll take you seven
[42:25] years I think it is or six years of what
[42:27] you're doing to make what your your
[42:29] employer is going to give you for free
[42:31] so if your employer offers you a benefit
[42:33] or sorry a investment matching or RSP
[42:35] matching please try to do that because
[42:37] you're going to set yourself up for
[42:40] rapid growth um they'll usually give you
[42:43] an option of what you invested in and
[42:45] that's where you need to talk to
[42:46] somebody who knows a little bit about
[42:49] investing and uh they'll probably want
[42:52] you to invest it in their stock which is
[42:53] not always the best option but anyways
[42:56] if you can take their they're matching
[42:58] definitely try to do that so after that
[43:01] is your take-home pay that's your net
[43:03] income that's what actually goes in your
[43:05] bank account so if you if your bank
[43:07] account says $4,200 got deposited that's
[43:10] your net income after that there's
[43:11] nobody else that's forcing deductions
[43:13] off of
[43:14] you so from there your budget begins so
[43:19] you you start with your tithes and your
[43:22] offerings then you are going to take
[43:25] your savings your your investment plan
[43:27] after that then you're going to go to
[43:29] your most important expenses which is
[43:31] going to be your housing so if you're
[43:32] renting it's typically rent plus
[43:35] utilities um if you're owning a home
[43:38] it's mortgage plus utilities plus taxes
[43:40] and maintenance I'm going to go for a
[43:42] rental option just because I'm I'm
[43:44] mostly talking to the young people for
[43:46] families and partners there's a lot more
[43:50] we could delve into here very way more
[43:52] variable when you're talking about
[43:53] mortgages there's much more complicated
[43:56] um option
[43:57] that you can be paying so we're not
[43:58] going to go into that
[44:00] today
[44:02] but if all things go well you want your
[44:06] housing expense to be less than 33% of
[44:09] your net income uh or sorry that your
[44:12] gross income your gross income um and
[44:15] that is just kind of a golden principle
[44:18] um I don't know if anybody knows this
[44:19] but I used to be in banking I did retail
[44:21] banking for a couple years uh hated it
[44:24] with a passion and got into commercial
[44:26] Finance which I really enjoyed but I
[44:29] learned a lot of horrible things about
[44:31] finance and how people ruin themselves
[44:33] in the retail side and uh if you can if
[44:38] you can get your housing cost under 3
[44:40] 33% of your gross income it's going to
[44:43] set you up for a much less stressful
[44:47] future so that's what we're going to use
[44:49] in our budget
[44:50] today then enter your fixed expenses if
[44:54] you have a debt payment that's a fixed
[44:56] amount or if you have insurance phone
[44:59] internet that kind of stuff after that
[45:01] you go to your variable expenses so
[45:03] variable expenses mean things that are
[45:04] going to change every month fixed
[45:06] expenses it'll be the same amount each
[45:08] month like your rent is fixed uh if you
[45:10] have insurance that'll be a fixed cost
[45:13] things that are variable will be like
[45:14] your gas your groceries you're not going
[45:16] to spend the exact same amount on that
[45:18] every month it depends on how much you
[45:20] drive or how much you eat um your
[45:22] insurance doesn't depend on how many
[45:23] times you crash well it it will don't
[45:27] don't test that but if you don't crash
[45:29] forever your insurance is still going to
[45:31] charge you and uh that's just an
[45:34] unfortunate reality but um after your
[45:38] variable expenses are in now you have
[45:41] discretionary income this is stuff that
[45:43] you can now spend on whatever you feel
[45:46] like um so it could be eating out it
[45:48] could be entertainment maybe you want to
[45:50] travel someday maybe you're trying to
[45:52] save up for um moving out and you're
[45:55] trying to get a down payment or
[45:57] get some other thing for a car that is
[46:00] all after the first six lines are
[46:02] already
[46:03] done so don't don't kid yourself it's
[46:07] it's hard it's really really hard in
[46:09] Calgary um to be on a flip side though
[46:14] Calgary has some of the most incredible
[46:15] opportunities in Canada uh the
[46:17] opportunities versus The Living cost we
[46:20] are far ahead if you were living in
[46:23] Toronto right now um I sure everybody
[46:26] knows this already but it's impossible
[46:28] to get a house for less than 33% of your
[46:30] gross income unless you're making like
[46:33] $2 million a year uh 33% is not possible
[46:38] um so the banks actually have changed
[46:40] the rules and they actually allow you
[46:41] now to borrow up to like 50% of your
[46:43] income which when I was in banking was
[46:46] you would get like almost fired if you
[46:48] tried to do that the credit guy would
[46:49] look at you and say you need to go down
[46:51] a few ranks but now they do it because
[46:53] the housing cost is just out of control
[46:55] so although Calgary is hard
[46:57] unfortunately it's one of the best
[46:58] places in in Canada from a ratio of
[47:01] income to uh cost of
[47:05] living so uh I
[47:09] think I think I'll actually go through
[47:11] the budget
[47:14] quickly okay that's that's not as bad as
[47:17] I thought it could be uh let's go
[47:20] through the budget now I just need to
[47:22] get the right screen shared
[47:50] anybody see any of that
[47:57] good
[47:58] okay oh you can zoom there
[48:03] okay do what you have to I guess to to
[48:07] make it
[48:12] work okay so if I move it still moves
[48:16] okay all right so
[48:20] income I'm going to I'm going to go
[48:22] through this a little bit slower now
[48:24] because this is the actual process of
[48:26] building the budget and I think this is
[48:29] being recorded so if anybody wants to
[48:31] they can go back review the recording
[48:33] take your own numbers I'm going to give
[48:35] you this template after as well so you
[48:37] can take this blank template put your
[48:39] own numbers into it and come up with
[48:41] with a budget at the end of the day that
[48:43] you can you can take into the future or
[48:45] you can use uh right now did you have a
[48:46] question or were you just yawning
[48:49] no okay that's
[48:53] allowed uh so we said 4200 was going to
[48:57] be our our net
[48:59] income on a monthly basis so say you
[49:02] work some extra time then you can put in
[49:05] you know if you made $100 mowing
[49:08] somebody's lawn you can put that in
[49:09] there as well um this budget is tries to
[49:13] be quite flexible so I I built it with a
[49:16] template and then refined it to kind of
[49:19] make it work for me but I I intend that
[49:22] it should be able to work for almost any
[49:24] situation not for a business just for
[49:27] households and um there should be extra
[49:30] fields in almost every category that you
[49:32] can enter your own things you can
[49:34] obviously change the names as well so if
[49:36] you need to to make modifications like
[49:38] that so here's where I am going to get
[49:41] out my cheat sheet so I don't have to do
[49:44] math while I'm
[49:54] talking okay
[49:59] so uh
[50:01] 65,000 a year grow if you do uh on a on
[50:05] a monthly basis it's actually it's
[50:07] $5,400 a month gross so just for my
[50:11] purposes of calculations I'm going to
[50:13] show that um I'm going to take 10% of
[50:15] that for our tithes and I have a thing
[50:18] in here saying use a negative number
[50:21] that's because I don't consider ties an
[50:24] expense and it kind of messes with the
[50:26] and picture that you'll get if you put
[50:29] it as an expense line it's much prettier
[50:31] and makes your data a little bit easier
[50:33] to interpret if you put it in your
[50:34] income so basically this comes off
[50:36] before your expenses start so I'm going
[50:39] to put minus 540 for
[50:44] tithes and then for offerings I'm going
[50:47] to say uh
[50:51] 20 so now at the bottom you will
[50:57] see does this highlight when I click
[51:00] okay so go down I'll go down a little
[51:02] bit so there is the the total cash
[51:05] available for expenses so this is your
[51:07] income minus tithes and offerings
[51:10] $3,740 a month sounds amazing right for
[51:13] all those who maybe are not making 65
[51:17] Grand
[51:19] wait till we get to what the cost of
[51:23] living looks like
[51:25] uh these were supposed to be
[51:29] blank I am on the right
[51:40] one kind of wanted to just show the
[51:42] effect of of building this up on your
[51:45] own not just looking at numbers okay so
[51:48] that's all
[51:50] zero okay so when you're building your
[51:53] budget can you see the far yeah you can
[51:56] see the right side
[51:57] so this column here this is your
[52:00] budgeted uh
[52:01] allowance so these are the numbers that
[52:03] you would actually
[52:05] be manipulating when you're building
[52:08] your budget um I'm going to use them as
[52:12] uh I think those are
[52:16] my yeah those are my numbers that are
[52:18] going to go um uh in into into
[52:22] calculating expenses here but so let's
[52:24] just say you have a a student Landing
[52:27] credit or something you you're going to
[52:29] have some sort of a fixed payment or an
[52:31] interest payment every single month on
[52:33] that depending on where you're at in
[52:35] your loan so let's just say for sake of
[52:37] example you have a $100 loan that that's
[52:39] due every month so you'd put that into
[52:41] your budget field here um sorry in here
[52:45] so you guys can see that there's a
[52:47] column for budgeted and then there's
[52:49] rows for each expense category so
[52:52] student line of credit other loans maybe
[52:54] of a car or something like that never
[52:56] credit card um and then you have
[52:59] personal you know these are different
[53:01] categories that I've just made up so
[53:04] when you're doing your budget make it
[53:05] personal to you and uh and then enter
[53:08] some numbers that are going to make
[53:09] sense so we're going to say $100 a month
[53:12] for your L of credit that's one of your
[53:14] your your mandated
[53:16] expenses um so then uh after that
[53:26] slide not
[53:31] changing okay your savings and
[53:34] Investments should be um right right uh
[53:39] at the beginning of your of your budget
[53:42] so we're trying to go for 10% of our
[53:45] income in savings and Investments this
[53:48] is like a another one of those golden
[53:49] rules that if you can start at 10% and
[53:52] you can continue this for your whole
[53:54] life your investments will change as
[53:56] your income changes and you'll be
[53:58] setting yourself up if you have like a
[54:00] 40-year career or something like that by
[54:02] the time you hit your 40 45 years you
[54:06] should be set up for a a decent Nest Egg
[54:09] for retirement or not Nest Egg but a
[54:10] decent uh asset for retirement so that
[54:14] is um what I'm going to use here we're
[54:17] going to start with our I'm not going to
[54:19] explain these today uh we can go into
[54:22] this in another session if people want
[54:23] is different investment vehicles that's
[54:25] a little too complex for today um but
[54:28] we're I'm just going to say you're going
[54:29] to put $200 a month in your taxfree
[54:31] savings
[54:32] account and $100 a month into your
[54:37] RSP and then short-term savings maybe
[54:40] this is for a car
[54:42] or uh a very small down payment for a
[54:47] house and then emergency fund emergency
[54:50] fund is uh is a great principle hard in
[54:55] practice until you actually have a bit
[54:57] of cash rolling around it's very hard to
[54:59] justify an emergency fund if you're at
[55:01] zero every month already um but it is it
[55:05] is a given that something will happen in
[55:08] your life whether it's in six months or
[55:11] six years that will be an emergency and
[55:13] it could be you lose income for a few
[55:15] months it could be your car blows up and
[55:19] you need something else um it could be
[55:22] that uh one of your kids has a health
[55:24] situation or needs braces or or
[55:26] something like that or your your
[55:27] Appliance breaks but my point is there's
[55:30] a lot of things that will happen over
[55:32] the course of your life and you just
[55:33] hope they don't all happen at once but
[55:36] uh having an emergency fund is the way
[55:38] to Shield yourself from that kind of
[55:40] risk so um if you never have an
[55:43] emergency congratulations what we do is
[55:45] once our emergency fund hits a certain
[55:47] threshold like an investable amount say
[55:51] like $3 to $5,000 or something like that
[55:54] we would take a little bit of that out
[55:56] and and put it into a longer term
[55:58] investment that's going to make more
[55:59] money but still accessible if we really
[56:02] need it but I don't want you know if you
[56:04] don't have an emergency for a decade
[56:06] which is unlikely I don't recommend that
[56:09] you keep a ton of cash in a in almost
[56:11] zero interest savings account it's a
[56:12] it's a bad use of money again topic for
[56:15] another day but the when you're making
[56:18] your budget if you can afford to put a
[56:19] little bit aside for emergency this is
[56:21] not in your 10% savings uh your 10% is
[56:25] longterm you want to save for long-term
[56:27] stuff so you can see
[56:30] here on this uh this sell overall we
[56:33] have $450 a month of our income is going
[56:37] towards uh some sort of savings accounts
[56:40] and 300 or so of that is your um your
[56:43] long-term investing I'm assuming as well
[56:46] that there'll be some CPP coming off
[56:48] your paycheck which is Canon pension
[56:50] plan and that's also counted for
[56:51] longterm because you'll everybody will
[56:53] get that if you pay into it when you
[56:55] retire uh again another day we won't get
[56:58] into the details of how it all works
[56:59] just got to have a little bit of faith
[57:00] on that
[57:02] one um so then after that I think it was
[57:06] housing yes so your rent and utilities
[57:09] I'm sorry that this is not laid out in
[57:11] chronological order I don't know how I
[57:13] laid it out I think it might have been
[57:15] alphabetical at one point and now it's
[57:17] no rhy or Reason so mortgage and rent um
[57:24] I I did some time looking this this up
[57:27] on like rent faster which is a website
[57:29] for rental
[57:31] properties and I was able to find a few
[57:34] options for $1,400 a month which is the
[57:37] most that you can afford at this level
[57:40] so if you're making $65,000 a year you
[57:43] should try not to be spending more than
[57:45] about $1,500 a month on your total
[57:47] housing cost so uh for an example on a
[57:53] like a $400,000 house
[57:56] your mortgage payment is going to be
[57:59] around $2,000 a month I I didn't do the
[58:02] math I'm just guessing on a $400,000
[58:05] house that's hard to find these days um
[58:08] then you have insurance then you have
[58:12] utilities then you have maintenance so I
[58:16] Rec sorry property taxes yes not
[58:21] insignificant if you're in a condo you
[58:23] have condo fees as well so my point is
[58:26] home ownership is a great aspiration but
[58:29] it's not necessarily practical if you're
[58:31] living at your parents and you're hoping
[58:33] you know to stay there till you're 45
[58:35] and you can afford a house that's
[58:37] probably not
[58:39] recommended um no matter how much of a
[58:41] mama's boy you are you're going to get
[58:43] sick of each other so uh I think renting
[58:47] is probably more realistic for the vast
[58:48] majority of people looking at your first
[58:50] house the what what makes saving up for
[58:54] a home a lot easier is sharing that
[58:56] rental with someone so find a good
[58:58] friend or get married that's the best
[59:01] advice to the right person and uh and
[59:05] share that expense a little bit that
[59:07] like two incomes is a completely
[59:09] different picture on your household and
[59:13] um you know uh every family has to make
[59:16] the decision on how they're going to
[59:17] balance out their um their workloads and
[59:20] that kind of stuff but if you can put in
[59:22] a couple years of dual income uh that
[59:24] will probably help you to get your first
[59:26] house on a payment that the single
[59:28] income can
[59:29] afford so I'm going to say
[59:33] 1,400 is our
[59:35] rent and I can't believe how hard this
[59:38] is on my voice can I
[59:41] actually I feel like I might need some
[59:43] monitor or something I hear people say
[59:45] this all the time and now I think I see
[59:47] why I'm really losing my voice
[59:50] already okay um so 1,400 1400 a month
[59:56] mon for the
[59:58] rent and uh you won't have property
[1:00:01] taxes if you're renting um furnishings
[1:00:05] and additions this is not included in
[1:00:07] your 33% but this is like say you need a
[1:00:11] table or Cutlery which you do need um
[1:00:15] Crystal and I add a line in our budget
[1:00:18] for this so that every month we're
[1:00:20] saving or we're budgeting a little bit
[1:00:21] of money for that and then maybe in like
[1:00:24] in October she goes to CCO and she sees
[1:00:27] a a dinnerware set that that we would uh
[1:00:30] wanted well we have money that has been
[1:00:33] kind of been sloshing it's not in a
[1:00:35] designated account but it's just kind of
[1:00:38] accounted for if you know what I mean so
[1:00:41] these are not things you're going to pay
[1:00:42] every single month but having it in your
[1:00:44] budget allows you to acrew just a little
[1:00:47] bit of wiggle room down the line or if
[1:00:50] if something comes up you can steal that
[1:00:51] money from that that wiggle room um and
[1:00:54] we've definitely done that as well so I
[1:00:56] think I said $50 a
[1:00:59] month
[1:01:01] for that
[1:01:03] category and then um
[1:01:06] supplies again this could roll into your
[1:01:08] Furnishings but this is things like
[1:01:10] cleaning products toilet paper you know
[1:01:14] all the the less fabulous parts of
[1:01:16] living on your own that does doesn't
[1:01:19] just appear out of nowhere you got to go
[1:01:21] buy it and uh and then consume it in
[1:01:25] some time
[1:01:27] okay so I have
[1:01:31] here I don't know why these numbers are
[1:01:33] are not that's going to frustrate me but
[1:01:37] I'll try to let my OCD go for a sec so
[1:01:40] we got just under $1,500 a month as our
[1:01:44] our total uh for month uh sorry for for
[1:01:47] housing so out of a $4,200 a month uh
[1:01:52] income that's actually really good uh
[1:01:54] let me do a quick math
[1:01:59] here that's just under 30% um off of
[1:02:04] your 65,000 a year so there's even a
[1:02:06] little bit of wiggle room here if you're
[1:02:07] willing to compromise in other areas of
[1:02:09] your life you could spend a little bit
[1:02:11] more on your housing or you could put
[1:02:13] that extra into saving up for a down
[1:02:15] payment on something that you really
[1:02:16] want okay so after that we're going into
[1:02:20] our more fixed
[1:02:23] expenses which are
[1:02:32] um not finding okay so like your phone
[1:02:35] bill is going to be uh usually a fixed
[1:02:37] expense if you're on some sort of a
[1:02:43] plan so uh I don't know if this is
[1:02:46] unreasonable I thought $100 a month you
[1:02:49] could probably find a phone plan um for
[1:02:51] most people that will work for 100 bucks
[1:02:53] a month it doesn't include the phone so
[1:02:57] buy uh buy a phone on their plan for
[1:02:59] extra 20 bucks a month or something or
[1:03:02] um you already have a phone maybe
[1:03:04] because you've been using one for a few
[1:03:06] years or something like that so that's
[1:03:08] going to be a fixed expense your
[1:03:10] electricity and
[1:03:12] gas I estimated about 75 and that's
[1:03:15] pretty realistic all these numbers by
[1:03:16] the way I took a lot of time to vet
[1:03:18] these These are numbers that based on
[1:03:20] your income a family or a household of
[1:03:23] some sort would probably end up with
[1:03:25] real numbers just like this we're also
[1:03:27] landlords so we have a couple of of
[1:03:29] rental properties and these numbers are
[1:03:31] right in line with where they are so
[1:03:33] just so you know this is current day
[1:03:35] dollars basically that we're looking at
[1:03:38] um so water and waste if you are um
[1:03:42] renting that's not going to apply to you
[1:03:44] that's usually included but what I would
[1:03:46] say is
[1:03:47] internet you're going to need an
[1:03:50] internet connection no matter what
[1:03:51] you're doing I would think that's
[1:03:54] roughly going to be $100 a month as well
[1:03:55] as
[1:03:56] well so your fixed costs there are about
[1:04:00] 275 a month and right now you can see as
[1:04:04] as we're doing this there's a a total at
[1:04:07] the bottom that's
[1:04:09] running so on our uh on our current
[1:04:12] numbers we're at $2,300 a month and we
[1:04:15] have
[1:04:16] $4,200 or sorry no wait after tithes it
[1:04:18] was $
[1:04:21] 3740 so you can start to play around and
[1:04:24] and and come closer and closer to that
[1:04:26] net number where you're going to be able
[1:04:27] to afford everything and now at this
[1:04:30] point I'm just going to go from top to
[1:04:31] bottom through all the categories
[1:04:33] because I think we're we've done the
[1:04:34] very uh important ones so now these are
[1:04:37] these are ones that you could probably
[1:04:40] um Flex based on your own needs
[1:04:43] discretionary cash Crystal and I call
[1:04:44] this mad money we each give each give um
[1:04:49] give each other we each get I don't know
[1:04:50] how to say this all of our money goes
[1:04:53] into one account it always has from day
[1:04:55] one both of our paychecks go to the same
[1:04:57] account all the expenses come out of the
[1:04:58] same account we both have access to all
[1:05:01] the accounts nobody is superior I don't
[1:05:04] have special privileges because I make
[1:05:06] more I'm not saying that this is
[1:05:08] Doctrine again I'm just saying this is
[1:05:10] how we decided to to set up our budget
[1:05:12] for the first five or six years Crystal
[1:05:14] made more money than I would than I did
[1:05:16] and we expected that someday mine would
[1:05:18] overtake hers so we just decided like we
[1:05:21] want this to
[1:05:22] be to feel Fair all the time because if
[1:05:25] I want her to work less I don't want her
[1:05:28] to have to feel to feel like I'm getting
[1:05:30] more privilege with the spending money
[1:05:33] she spends way more than I do just
[1:05:34] because she manages the house but it's
[1:05:36] not on herself so we get the same amount
[1:05:38] of spending money I could go burn this
[1:05:41] money if I wanted to I could go hang out
[1:05:43] with the guys I could go um buy a bunch
[1:05:47] of food that she doesn't think we need
[1:05:49] like I can go out for meals or something
[1:05:50] like that so discretionary cash we call
[1:05:53] Mad Money and this is just money that's
[1:05:55] not budget it at all it's just there you
[1:05:57] get it we have separate accounts for our
[1:05:59] own mad money and that money neither one
[1:06:02] of us has influence over so she can
[1:06:04] spend it on anything she wants for
[1:06:05] herself if she buys $500 of shoes all I
[1:06:08] can do is roll my eyes but I can't say
[1:06:10] no so and uh I think this is important
[1:06:13] in any household to have some amount
[1:06:15] when we first got married this was like
[1:06:18] $25 it was really small but we had
[1:06:21] something there that we had autonomy
[1:06:24] over and we could feel like you know
[1:06:27] treating ourself once in a while on ice
[1:06:29] cream or a burger at the University
[1:06:31] something like that so I do think that
[1:06:32] some sort of discretionary cash should
[1:06:35] always be budgeted for because you're
[1:06:37] not a robot and you can't live off of a
[1:06:39] spreadsheet every
[1:06:42] day
[1:06:43] um Fitness again up to the individual I
[1:06:47] estimated a gym membership or something
[1:06:49] or maybe saving towards a bike or a good
[1:06:51] pair of shoes about 50 bucks a month
[1:06:54] health and dental this is really hard to
[1:06:56] say everybody's going to be different um
[1:06:59] I put immediately $25 in there if you
[1:07:01] have dental problems that's going to be
[1:07:03] different uh but a lot of employer
[1:07:06] benefits plans they have gen General
[1:07:08] stuff that you'll need you know like
[1:07:09] chiropractor and that kind of thing
[1:07:10] they're a lot of and of course with AHS
[1:07:13] all of your your Essentials are covered
[1:07:15] through um our Healthcare
[1:07:18] System okay so we already did our
[1:07:20] investments
[1:07:23] food this is a a fun one
[1:07:27] not so we spend an Unholy amount on
[1:07:32] groceries and I don't know how it
[1:07:34] happens but that's not my my department
[1:07:37] so I tried to estimate without a lot of
[1:07:40] authority how much people spend on a
[1:07:42] single
[1:07:43] income um I said $350 a
[1:07:48] month no what's more
[1:07:52] realistic is that is that high or low
[1:07:55] it's very low for for one
[1:07:58] person
[1:08:03] 500 I don't think I can afford 600 this
[1:08:05] person is eating more instant
[1:08:10] noodles yeah so that's going to throw my
[1:08:13] numbers off we're going to have to to
[1:08:15] compromise somewhere else because I I
[1:08:17] massively underestimated the groceries
[1:08:20] um but yeah it's it's getting pretty
[1:08:22] intense out there depending on your diet
[1:08:23] obviously everybody's going to have
[1:08:25] different needs
[1:08:26] protein powder is the first thing as
[1:08:28] Daniel knows and then you pay for
[1:08:30] vegetables at the
[1:08:32] end okay so maybe it comes out of your
[1:08:35] restaurant budget I had put $50 a month
[1:08:38] for restaurants I think that could be in
[1:08:40] your mad money that could be your
[1:08:42] discretionary for Crystal and I we we
[1:08:44] put a separate line item for groceries
[1:08:47] and I think it's literally
[1:08:49] $50 we we eat out very very rarely uh
[1:08:55] maybe like four times five times a year
[1:08:57] we eat out as a family so we use our own
[1:09:00] mad money if we want to go out with
[1:09:02] friends that's where we what we use that
[1:09:04] money for so one of the ways that we
[1:09:06] keep our budget in check is we almost
[1:09:08] never eat out and we learn to be good
[1:09:10] cooks and we actually really love it
[1:09:11] when we entertain we have people over to
[1:09:13] our house that's one of the reasons why
[1:09:15] our grocery budget is where it is but um
[1:09:18] we take a lot of joy in cooking and
[1:09:20] serving it to other people so if you
[1:09:22] want to eat out more you're probably
[1:09:24] going to have to make compromises in
[1:09:26] other areas uh but that's kind of what
[1:09:29] what I allowed this
[1:09:31] person so Family Care there's lots of
[1:09:34] categories here for a family with with
[1:09:36] multiple people in it but for one person
[1:09:38] we thought gifts is probably the the one
[1:09:41] mandatory item in there you likely have
[1:09:45] a parents you likely have siblings maybe
[1:09:48] you even have a friend um but somebody
[1:09:51] in your life needs a card or a gift once
[1:09:54] in a while
[1:09:56] uh this is this is something that's
[1:09:59] completely personal so if this number
[1:10:01] looks ridiculous to you you got to make
[1:10:03] compromises elsewhere uh Crystal and I
[1:10:06] we don't give very expensive gifts to
[1:10:08] each other or to our kids uh because we
[1:10:12] do other things that that are valuable
[1:10:15] so um but for this cheap person I put
[1:10:18] $25 a month which uh what's that like 7
[1:10:22] 650 bucks a year so you got to spread
[1:10:25] the love or just have very few
[1:10:29] friends that's what I
[1:10:32] chose okay so
[1:10:35] insurance this one uh is assuming this
[1:10:39] person has a cheap car my first few cars
[1:10:42] I didn't have comprehensive I think it's
[1:10:44] called I don't know the terms I just had
[1:10:47] liability so if I if I crashed into
[1:10:50] somebody their car was paid for mine was
[1:10:52] not and that I didn't care cuz my car my
[1:10:55] my first car literally cost $700 and it
[1:10:58] it ran for like 3 years so I was really
[1:11:00] happy with that so I'm assuming this
[1:11:02] person has a cheap car cheap insurance
[1:11:04] no accidents $100 a month I think it is
[1:11:08] possible it's it's very very close and a
[1:11:11] a very cheap car or or like I said no no
[1:11:15] um comprehensive at all so maybe a high
[1:11:17] deductible I think it's possible to get
[1:11:19] there home insurance if you're renting
[1:11:21] it's super cheap it might not even be
[1:11:23] $50 a month if you're like a
[1:11:27] small a small property with very few
[1:11:30] items basically all they do is they
[1:11:32] cover your furniture so if your house
[1:11:34] burns down you they're not covering your
[1:11:36] house because you're renting it they're
[1:11:37] covering the stuff inside the house so
[1:11:40] your clothes or your furniture that kind
[1:11:41] of
[1:11:42] stuff life
[1:11:44] insurance this is another conversation
[1:11:47] but I'm not going to go into
[1:11:51] it so I'm very
[1:11:54] grateful uh um my
[1:11:56] parents basically forced me to get life
[1:12:00] insurance when I was like 17 and they
[1:12:03] forced all of all the kids I think they
[1:12:04] paid like a few uh months for us and
[1:12:07] they put a little like lump sum in it or
[1:12:09] something but then we had to pay the
[1:12:12] monthly premiums and I've been paying
[1:12:14] that since I was 17 Jeremy has been
[1:12:16] paying it since he was like 15 and
[1:12:18] Andrew's been paying it since he was 19
[1:12:21] and I'm pretty sure they're both
[1:12:22] uninsurable now so they got life
[1:12:25] insurance at an early age before they
[1:12:27] knew about their health problems and
[1:12:30] they can't get that insurance anymore so
[1:12:33] there's a lot of I'm not going to you
[1:12:36] know I'm not going to get into it too
[1:12:39] heavy if you've never thought about life
[1:12:41] insurance start thinking about it no
[1:12:43] matter how old you are
[1:12:45] um if you thinking about having a family
[1:12:48] really think about life insurance
[1:12:50] because you might not be insurable in 2
[1:12:53] years uh you might be dead in two years
[1:12:56] um so the premium when you're young I
[1:13:00] think I'm still paying on that first
[1:13:02] policy which I think is a $200,000 death
[1:13:05] benefit I think I'm paying like $60 a
[1:13:07] month it's really low and if I did that
[1:13:11] today it would probably be five or six
[1:13:12] times that number not because of
[1:13:14] inflation just because I've gotten
[1:13:16] riskier because I'm older I'm more
[1:13:17] likely to die so um life insurance as a
[1:13:21] at a young age is a really good thing to
[1:13:24] look at um if you believe in the value
[1:13:26] of it at all some people have no faith
[1:13:28] in it and whatever that's fine but I
[1:13:30] think there is some some benefit to it
[1:13:34] so I I put that at $100 and I also
[1:13:37] consider this an investment of of sorts
[1:13:39] because this will go to your estate if
[1:13:41] you have more than the cost of your
[1:13:42] funeral like you can get funeral
[1:13:44] insurance which is like $10,000 or
[1:13:45] something benefit very very small just
[1:13:47] to cover your casket and the dirt but if
[1:13:50] it's a few hundred, um that'll be your
[1:13:54] you know to your wife or your husband or
[1:13:56] your Offspring so this can be included
[1:13:59] as a it can be rationalized that this is
[1:14:01] kind of an investment in a way and there
[1:14:04] are ways to actually make it an
[1:14:05] investment to put real value into it and
[1:14:08] make it something you can liquidate
[1:14:09] before you die not getting into it just
[1:14:12] throwing little nuggets out
[1:14:16] there um okay so fees I couldn't think
[1:14:18] of a lot of annual fees for a single
[1:14:21] person like Crystal has a nursing fee
[1:14:26] association fee I don't I think this is
[1:14:28] very specific I can't think of an annual
[1:14:30] fee that you'd have to pay other than
[1:14:31] like your credit card if you have a
[1:14:32] special
[1:14:34] one uh school fees that's again proam is
[1:14:37] likely we have a school fee for our kids
[1:14:39] um
[1:14:41] entertainment I'm not a big believer in
[1:14:44] a lot of entertainment so this person's
[1:14:46] living on YouTube or
[1:14:49] something uh they get $20 for games
[1:14:52] movies books $20
[1:14:55] for random
[1:14:58] hobbies and $20 for
[1:15:02] clothes you already have a wardrobe okay
[1:15:06] you're not you're not starting naked
[1:15:07] you're starting fully clothed with years
[1:15:10] of wardrobe and your body is hopefully
[1:15:12] staying a similar shape for a long
[1:15:16] time so I I I don't know if this is
[1:15:20] valuable information to anybody but up
[1:15:23] until 6 months ago I have not bought
[1:15:24] clothes for about 4 years um I just
[1:15:27] don't it's not my thing I know a lot of
[1:15:30] other people would spend what I spend in
[1:15:32] four years every two months so just do
[1:15:35] you but this person also understand has
[1:15:37] a low income to housing ratio they need
[1:15:41] to live on their own but they don't make
[1:15:42] more than 65,000 a year so clothing is
[1:15:46] something that realistically you could
[1:15:48] swall your pride if you had to and wear
[1:15:51] last year's clothes hav't forbid
[1:15:57] um
[1:15:58] okay this is actually a category the
[1:16:01] entertainment I think that's how I made
[1:16:02] this this budget balance was I stripped
[1:16:05] I stripped this way down oh boy uh
[1:16:10] fuel this one really
[1:16:12] depends some you might be able to live
[1:16:14] on Transit and maybe you don't even need
[1:16:16] a car at all in which case you're saving
[1:16:18] a ton of money over this person like if
[1:16:19] you don't need a car you're you're much
[1:16:22] better off Calgary is a hard place
[1:16:24] andless unless you live near your
[1:16:26] workplace there's not even there's not
[1:16:27] even transit to the church here which is
[1:16:30] unfortunate um so I put fuel I think
[1:16:34] pretty high I said $200 a month um we we
[1:16:39] spend a little bit more than that but
[1:16:41] Crystal has an SUV and we drive from
[1:16:44] Okat coses so if you live in
[1:16:46] Calgary um and you commute every day I
[1:16:48] think you could probably find a way to
[1:16:50] make this work it might be tighter than
[1:16:52] I think that's one I could be a little
[1:16:54] bit out of touch on but I said if you're
[1:16:56] having a small four-cylinder car you're
[1:16:59] you're making it on 200 bucks a month
[1:17:01] and again like say you spend 221 month
[1:17:04] you got to find somewhere else to pull
[1:17:05] that from maybe you're not buying any
[1:17:08] more clothes socks or whatever you're
[1:17:09] going to buy that month maybe you spend
[1:17:12] less 150 bonus put that into your
[1:17:14] maintenance budget for your car um or a
[1:17:17] down payment for a new car someday don't
[1:17:19] don't just spend that money if you can
[1:17:21] help it
[1:17:23] um I should balance that a little bit
[1:17:25] though I like what brother Nester said
[1:17:28] enjoy life don't don't be too too rigid
[1:17:32] everything that I'm saying is from a
[1:17:33] place of balance your budget at all
[1:17:36] costs and I think that's the way that
[1:17:38] you should think but once you get
[1:17:40] experienced in managing your own money
[1:17:42] there's definitely flex and you'll see
[1:17:44] that on my budget when I show it there's
[1:17:46] a lot of variance um so it's not like
[1:17:50] you're breaking the law if you miss your
[1:17:52] budget once or twice
[1:17:55] maintenance fund um I said cheap car
[1:17:58] probably a high maintenance fund 100
[1:18:00] bucks a month this is basically your own
[1:18:02] insurance so instead of giving your
[1:18:04] insurance to a black hole that will
[1:18:06] never come back to you make your own
[1:18:07] Insurance Fund and in a year you have
[1:18:09] $1,200 sitting here maybe you needed an
[1:18:12] oil change so you have $1,100 in there
[1:18:15] um maybe you needed tires so you only
[1:18:17] have $400 in there maybe you needed a
[1:18:19] transmission so you just said forget it
[1:18:21] I'm buying a different car um but if you
[1:18:24] if you use your maintenance fund you can
[1:18:26] make it like your own self-funded
[1:18:28] insurance plan and over time you can
[1:18:31] have a few thousand dollar if you just
[1:18:32] roll that for years be humble about your
[1:18:35] car and then one day you know you're
[1:18:37] sitting on three or 4,000 that's worth
[1:18:40] more than your first car was and now
[1:18:41] you're upgrading to something a little
[1:18:43] bit nicer or if you get married and you
[1:18:46] only need one car we leave done one car
[1:18:48] for I think six years something like
[1:18:51] that five or six years I had no car for
[1:18:53] a very long time time CU I took Transit
[1:18:55] everywhere I went I was a student for
[1:18:57] the first few years of marriage and and
[1:19:00] a co-op student so I just took Transit
[1:19:01] everywhere and didn't didn't have a car
[1:19:04] so and Crystal's car was quite cheap and
[1:19:06] she owned it already before we got
[1:19:08] married so it was a it was a nice
[1:19:11] situation um registration for for
[1:19:14] vehicle this is cheap I said 20 bucks a
[1:19:17] year that's going to be your
[1:19:18] registration and your driver's license
[1:19:20] just just put a little money aside for
[1:19:22] stuff like that so you know to think
[1:19:24] about about it every time you make your
[1:19:25] budget but it's only like an annual
[1:19:27] expense it's not going to not going to
[1:19:29] hit you too
[1:19:30] hard okay just about through
[1:19:35] here um utilities we
[1:19:40] did okay
[1:19:44] vacation this person doesn't take
[1:19:46] expensive
[1:19:48] vacations uh I said $20 a month this is
[1:19:52] like a road trip to Edmonton Maybe
[1:19:56] maximize your vacation by spreading it
[1:19:58] with friends you
[1:20:00] know uh go hang out with Miles they they
[1:20:02] have a motor home I don't know find find
[1:20:05] a friend with an asset that you want to
[1:20:07] share with
[1:20:09] them um miscellaneous expenses so
[1:20:13] there's obviously going to be things you
[1:20:14] didn't account for and I don't have a
[1:20:16] lot of money left over so I said $50 a
[1:20:21] month let me just check something oh
[1:20:25] we have $40
[1:20:27] left so um now you can kind of choose
[1:20:31] where you want to uh treat
[1:20:34] yourself maybe you just add that to your
[1:20:36] MK and you just have this extra $40 a
[1:20:39] buffer every month we use our
[1:20:41] miscellaneous expense all the time uh
[1:20:45] things that we just didn't think we
[1:20:46] would get and we end up uh splurging on
[1:20:49] something so we just have a
[1:20:52] little line item and and we don't we
[1:20:56] don't usually say what it is unless it's
[1:20:58] a big thing like when we move to the to
[1:21:00] the acreage we had to get a few things
[1:21:02] so in the cell if you right click and
[1:21:05] then you insert a
[1:21:07] comment you can
[1:21:09] say
[1:21:11] um alone
[1:21:15] $90 so then in like eight months when
[1:21:18] you're reviewing your budget and you're
[1:21:19] like why did I spend so much money in in
[1:21:22] January oh yeah then you smell the
[1:21:25] cologne and you thank
[1:21:27] yourself so uh I just think these
[1:21:29] comments are useful
[1:21:31] sometimes I think that's kind of it for
[1:21:34] the
[1:21:35] budget so now if you
[1:21:38] imagine you've got this budget and you
[1:21:41] filled this in so I did this on the
[1:21:44] expense line so column D is January's
[1:21:47] expenses so if we were in January at the
[1:21:50] end of the month this is where I'd be
[1:21:51] putting all these
[1:21:52] expenses but when you're doing your
[1:21:54] budget you obviously want to do it in
[1:21:56] this line and that's important because
[1:21:58] over the year it will show
[1:22:02] you what your or sorry what your average
[1:22:04] is so right now my average per month is
[1:22:07] $100 because I only have one month in
[1:22:09] there but if you if your average goes up
[1:22:11] you'll start to see it on this line and
[1:22:13] it'll tell you you're kind of getting
[1:22:14] out of check um your annual total will
[1:22:17] also show here and then on the summary
[1:22:19] page which doesn't make sense yet I'll
[1:22:22] show it to you on our budget this
[1:22:25] is why you want to put that budgeted
[1:22:26] number in there and why you want to put
[1:22:28] the tides in your income because it will
[1:22:31] actually net everything out and you'll
[1:22:34] see at the end of the year all this data
[1:22:36] happens automatically once you've
[1:22:38] entered the the um sorry all this
[1:22:40] calculation happens automatically when
[1:22:42] you enter your data at the beginning so
[1:22:44] if you've ever seen like the Mint app
[1:22:46] there's a lot of apps that do this kind
[1:22:47] of stuff the problem is they are
[1:22:51] littered with ads the platforms come and
[1:22:54] go like there's been some that we've
[1:22:55] used that are dead now and I have this
[1:22:58] data going back to
[1:23:00] 20 2009 I think I have budgets going all
[1:23:04] the way back to 2009 which is kind of
[1:23:05] fascinating because sometimes we look
[1:23:06] back at them like wow um and it wasn't
[1:23:09] this pretty at the beginning but if you
[1:23:12] do with your own spreadsheet it takes a
[1:23:13] little bit of manual labor Crystal does
[1:23:16] this thank the Lord um so every month
[1:23:19] she opens up our bank statements and she
[1:23:22] inputs down to like the nearest I think
[1:23:25] all of our expenses some of them are
[1:23:28] repeated so she just enters it once and
[1:23:30] it goes through the whole year um but
[1:23:32] like groceries is the big one she like
[1:23:34] that takes a bit of time she just enters
[1:23:36] you know the Costco receipt if it's like
[1:23:38] $300 she'll add $300 to the food line
[1:23:41] and then in 3 weeks if we have another
[1:23:42] $200 she'll say plus $200 um she doesn't
[1:23:46] you know oh there was a there was a
[1:23:48] supplement in there or there was shoes
[1:23:51] in there she doesn't get that granular
[1:23:52] usually but at the beginning we did we
[1:23:55] broke out anything that mattered because
[1:23:57] we had to balance our budget and there
[1:23:58] was no room for error so you can be as
[1:24:01] liberal or as tight as you want on this
[1:24:04] but I do think that if you have your own
[1:24:05] spreadsheet you own that data nobody
[1:24:08] else is farming it out and um I'm still
[1:24:12] hoping that you appreciate the kind of
[1:24:14] graphing that you get at the end it
[1:24:16] gives you some pretty rich illustrations
[1:24:19] of what you've done um and that can be a
[1:24:22] benefit in the future
[1:24:25] I think I just have one more slide and
[1:24:27] then I'm going to go into uh I'm going
[1:24:29] to stop the stream and and go into a
[1:24:31] little bit of personal information and a
[1:24:40] [Music]
[1:24:51] Q&A okay
[1:24:55] so this is what we just
[1:24:58] did um it'll probably take you if you if
[1:25:02] you
[1:25:03] have um no expenses no understanding
[1:25:07] this will probably take you a day to do
[1:25:09] your very first budget if you already
[1:25:11] have been living on your own or as a
[1:25:12] family it'll probably take you a few
[1:25:14] hours because you'll know what your
[1:25:16] housing costs you'll know what your
[1:25:18] roughly what a lot of your stuff costs
[1:25:21] um but it's if you have never budgeted
[1:25:23] before I urge you to do it even if
[1:25:26] you're doing fine even if your money is
[1:25:28] great because what it helps you to do is
[1:25:31] it really makes your budget efficient
[1:25:34] Crystal and I uh obviously we spend
[1:25:36] money on some things that other people
[1:25:38] would disagree with but there's not a
[1:25:40] lot of waste in our budget we we see
[1:25:44] Peaks and we see outliers right away
[1:25:47] because we review this together as a
[1:25:49] couple every month and um we catch
[1:25:52] outliers and we mitigate them as soon as
[1:25:55] we can so if we see oh wow gas was way
[1:25:58] higher last month what happened uh
[1:26:00] she'll say oh yeah well we had to do
[1:26:01] such and such and I'll be like okay so
[1:26:04] next month uh what can we do sometimes
[1:26:07] nothing sorry we can't change it we got
[1:26:09] to swallow that cost uh other times it's
[1:26:11] well um you know let's drive this car
[1:26:15] because it's more efficient let's go to
[1:26:18] let's not go to this place um let's wait
[1:26:20] till we can carpool um let's use the bus
[1:26:23] for the kids instead of driving to
[1:26:24] school like we'll find ways to to scrape
[1:26:27] back a little bit and um I I can't tell
[1:26:32] you how valuable it is to run your life
[1:26:34] off of a budget it it seems maybe a
[1:26:36] little stressful initially but over the
[1:26:38] course we've been doing this ever since
[1:26:40] we got married in 2008 and I I can't
[1:26:43] even think of the tens of thousands of
[1:26:45] dollars that we've acred over that time
[1:26:47] just by knowing where all of our money
[1:26:48] goes when when money goes somewhere we
[1:26:51] know about it it's not an accident and
[1:26:54] it it gets accounted for and it either
[1:26:56] influences future decisions or it
[1:26:59] inspires a retraction maybe we go return
[1:27:02] something it's like wait uh we don't
[1:27:04] need that as much as we thought we did
[1:27:05] and we can't afford it so uh we don't
[1:27:08] just have our budget to have numbers we
[1:27:10] do live by it and we keep oursel very
[1:27:13] accountable and nobody else cares like
[1:27:14] it doesn't influence anybody else uh but
[1:27:17] it's really helped our retirement plan
[1:27:19] and um our ability to help others and
[1:27:22] our ability to kind of Finance certain
[1:27:24] Adventures that we wouldn't be able to
[1:27:25] before so that's my Soap
[1:27:30] Box can you see this now okay this is I
[1:27:34] think the the last point on
[1:27:36] just maintaining your budget so this is
[1:27:38] a relatively obvious process maybe but I
[1:27:41] just wanted to lay it out for the
[1:27:42] recording so you enter your actual
[1:27:44] income and expenses at the end of each
[1:27:46] month and then adjust your spending if
[1:27:49] you need to if you're going off track
[1:27:50] adjust your spending a little bit don't
[1:27:52] just you know have a budget and never
[1:27:54] check it look at it every every month
[1:27:57] and uh enter the data every month if you
[1:28:00] overspend you might need to
[1:28:02] compensate we've kind of already gone
[1:28:04] over this um you can either eliminate
[1:28:07] some expenses cut back somewhere you can
[1:28:10] add to your income pick up an extra
[1:28:12] shift or supplement it with some side
[1:28:14] gig maybe you drive for Uber or
[1:28:16] something like that you just pick it up
[1:28:17] when you need to um but never use a
[1:28:21] credit card to cover your shortfalls um
[1:28:24] and never reduce your Investments so our
[1:28:28] strategy and I think every advisor's
[1:28:31] recommended strategy is to have your
[1:28:33] investment come automatically off of
[1:28:35] every paycheck so that you can't
[1:28:37] influence it it's a such a pain to
[1:28:39] change that you never do it and you just
[1:28:41] live off of what's left and I promise
[1:28:43] you it's true like if you think you
[1:28:45] can't afford to invest $50 a month just
[1:28:47] take it out automatically and watch your
[1:28:49] spending change uh if you don't live on
[1:28:51] credit cards that is um so if you're if
[1:28:53] you're Comm to not using your credit
[1:28:55] card when you can't afford it you just
[1:28:57] have your investment go out the out the
[1:28:58] window and you never even think about it
[1:29:00] and then you look back in a year and
[1:29:01] you're like wow I've got $1,000 here
[1:29:04] already and then in five years oh that
[1:29:06] ,000 has gotten interest and I've put
[1:29:08] more in there and you put that through
[1:29:11] um again we won't do this today but we
[1:29:14] could have someday do an investment plan
[1:29:16] what it would look like to retire at the
[1:29:18] age of 65 no matter where you are in
[1:29:21] life right now and you can calculate
[1:29:23] what that costs and what you have to do
[1:29:24] now to get there um with some
[1:29:27] assumptions so if you haven't done that
[1:29:30] I would urge you to do that someday as
[1:29:32] well um ideally with an independent
[1:29:35] adviser not with a bank because I worked
[1:29:37] at a bank and I can tell you they do not
[1:29:39] have your best interest in mind we had
[1:29:41] our our Targets in mind that was all we
[1:29:44] wanted you know if we could make it work
[1:29:46] for the client and US bonus but it was
[1:29:48] all about making it work for you for me
[1:29:51] as the adviser advisor I was trying to
[1:29:54] to make commissions and that's what
[1:29:55] everybody wanted to do
[1:29:57] so banks are a horrendous place to get
[1:30:00] advice for for finance for investing for
[1:30:03] loans you know they're probably the best
[1:30:05] thing you have right now but uh private
[1:30:07] loans are much worse than bank
[1:30:09] loans okay review your actual numbers at
[1:30:12] the end of each three-month period um
[1:30:14] that's just so you get if you if you
[1:30:15] don't review your so you review your
[1:30:17] numbers every month but then you review
[1:30:19] it on aggregate in three months or so so
[1:30:22] you can see the trend there's no Trend
[1:30:24] established in one month but over 3
[1:30:25] months you can start to maybe see some
[1:30:27] of your habits and then adjust going
[1:30:29] forward strategically save for large
[1:30:32] purchases oh yeah this is this is kind
[1:30:34] of important um I think I've implied it
[1:30:36] a few times so say you're trying to save
[1:30:40] up for a car and you know it's going to
[1:30:41] be
[1:30:42] $5,000 if you think like like with
[1:30:46] Crystal's car we we we put aside like
[1:30:48] $300 a month every month and didn't
[1:30:50] spend it it went to a separate savings
[1:30:52] account and we just let it sit there and
[1:30:54] fester and then when we needed it we had
[1:30:57] uh you know a sizable down payment for
[1:30:59] it so if you if you know there's a big
[1:31:01] expense coming up then I would just say
[1:31:04] um put money aside for that now with our
[1:31:06] acreage uh we knew our monthly payment
[1:31:09] was going to go up and uh we decided to
[1:31:13] live as though we had that payment
[1:31:15] before we had it and this was before we
[1:31:18] committed to an Anchorage we just said
[1:31:19] we think we want to do an Anchorage so
[1:31:21] for like 6 to 12 months we tried to put
[1:31:25] money aside and live as though we had
[1:31:28] that payment already and then we knew oh
[1:31:30] we could actually do this like with a
[1:31:32] few tweaks or if I make a little bit
[1:31:34] more we could make this happen but you
[1:31:36] know if you tried that and then you find
[1:31:38] out oh man I'm getting $400 a month not
[1:31:41] a thousand I can't do it well you just
[1:31:44] saved yourself a lot of headache um so
[1:31:47] for houses and cars fixed term payments
[1:31:50] I would advise you to live as though you
[1:31:53] have that payment when you start
[1:31:54] thinking about it because once you
[1:31:56] commit to it the bank would love to
[1:31:58] saddle you with that before you're ready
[1:32:00] they will find a way to get you that
[1:32:02] loan um as much as it might sound the
[1:32:05] opposite they actually really want to uh
[1:32:07] to approve you um and sometimes it's not
[1:32:10] in your best interest
[1:32:12] so uh does does that make sense just
[1:32:15] start paying your payment to yourself
[1:32:17] before you pay it to the bank for like
[1:32:19] six months or
[1:32:20] so okay this is the very last slide
[1:32:24] oh yeah so this is this is I guess a uh
[1:32:28] an offer I I wouldn't say a pitch I'm
[1:32:30] not trying to do more of this but if you
[1:32:34] think there's any value in someday doing
[1:32:36] a second session we can talk about
[1:32:39] anything uh my first idea is investing
[1:32:42] um how to do basic Research into
[1:32:45] investment vehicles like tfsas rssps
[1:32:49] pensions why you should be skeptical
[1:32:51] about financial advisors especially your
[1:32:54] bank but almost anybody who earns a
[1:32:56] living by telling you how to use your
[1:32:57] money they have motives for
[1:33:00] themselves um never risk your portfolio
[1:33:03] on an opportunity that promises
[1:33:04] unrealistic returns I know too many
[1:33:07] tragic accounts of people that have
[1:33:08] thrown their investment towards
[1:33:10] something we personally got hit by
[1:33:13] something like that it was on the advice
[1:33:15] of our adviser um but I've seen people
[1:33:18] lose their entire like 30-year portfolio
[1:33:22] because somebody said this opportunity
[1:33:24] is too good to miss uh you only have
[1:33:27] like 8 hours to decide well that is the
[1:33:29] first reason why you should never do it
[1:33:31] people try to as soon as there's a time
[1:33:33] limit on when you got to invest you know
[1:33:35] there's something wrong with it so if
[1:33:37] it's a good opportunity it's waiting for
[1:33:39] solid research to get there and um they
[1:33:41] won't be pressuring you like
[1:33:43] that so I guess just something to think
[1:33:46] about would you like a presentation
[1:33:48] about savings and investment strategies
[1:33:50] if yes then uh just talk to me later if
[1:33:53] we get enough interest then someday um
[1:33:58] I'll do some sort of follow-up and if
[1:33:59] not then uh thank you very much for your
[1:34:02] time I think we'll stop the Stream
