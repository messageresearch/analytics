gracious Heavenly Father Lord this morning we're so thankful that we can call you our father Lord and Lord not just because we can say that we identify ourselves in the word and that we can say that God sent a prophet we know that it's easy to speak but father it's because you live out through us your attributes are manifesting in your sons and your daughters Lord and that is the identification of our father and we thank you for that Lord we thank you you for your DNA Lord Jesus where would we be without you father we just want to commit the the life of sister Shelley vanderplas into your

brother Jerry Sister Mary and father each and every request that was made known unto you this morning by way of an uplift hand father we just want to commit those needs into your hands we know that you know them and father you are more than able to meet those requests we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians if you have your Bibles this morning I just would like to turn to the first Epistle of John chapter 2 the first Epistle of John Chapter 2 I want to carry on with our our discussion about God's will today and uh maybe from a father's perspective it's kind of a special day today but first John chapter 2 we'll start reading with verse 12 he says I write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake imagine if we could just remember that in every single trial and every single struggle in every single situation that we go through every Temptation that the devil brings us your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake verse 13 I write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because ye have known the father I have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning he says that twice I have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof my but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus this morning we just pray that you would break this bread of life open to us fresh once again father that we would recognize what you have already declared in your word about us that we would be able to just rest on that and father that we would be those Lord Jesus that abideth in you forever we just want to commit the rest of this service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a few announcements before we get into the word we've got the church cleanup coming on June 22nd at 10:00 a.m. that's postponed from when we had it booked last time we had uh bit of a situation with the water and you know I don't know what's going to happen because we might well still be under a water restriction we might have to just come and do what we can do uh maybe we'll bring some water we have the capacity to do that as well we'll just see personally I believe we should keep it for the 22nd regardless and just get her done um this Wednesday we have brother adelon Dela adelon here from Nigeria so we're excited about that Wednesday June 19th on June 23rd we have a 6 PM worship service where we're going to Worship the Lord many times we'll get together and preach but that time we're going to get together and we're just going to worship so if you have a special you'd like to bring you're certainly welcome to bring it and uh we just want to praise the Lord Brother Cadre Diggs will be here June 26 um that's Wednesday and we have the youth Service uh the Youth Event which is June the 30th and we'll be taking that at our house after the service and uh I believe there will be uh an invitation on WhatsApp so we know how many people plan to attend are you happy this morning just want to say Happy Father's Day to all the fathers who are with us amen I believe it's probably one of the greatest uh one of the greatest honors there is on Earth is to be a father as well as be a mother I'm not discounting that but today is Father's day so it's a tremendous um opportunity it's a tremendous blessing it's a tremendous responsibility we know that many people can actually have children but not everyone can actually be a true father or or a true mother to their children and uh today is just a wonderful day and uh if you're listening Dad Happy Father's Day sure love you and uh just want to welcome all of our visitors we have a tremendous amount of visitors with us today um many of them from uh uh BC and from Edmonton God bless you uh we have uh sister Faith egg Manis family with us as well we just want to God bless you welcome and brother Tois so and sister Marian they wanted to express their gratitude for the outpouring of Love yesterday in the uh wedding reception that we had for them they just wanted to have a note for the uh local assembly and for all those people who came from afar to to make the effort to celebrate the the union the visible Union that the Lord has given them here on Earth certainly was a a wonderful day yesterday certainly enjoyed it and uh yeah we uh were happy to be here today I want to get into uh our scripture here a little bit just talking about God's Will and certainly thankful for the study that we've had so far it has been a real blessing to me um for those people who haven't been around we've been discussing uh God's Will and the importance of it and recognizing that God's will isn't all about the destination he his will is that all would prosper and be in good health but not everyone has the ability to actually do that because we could say we we can have good health we know brother Bram had many people come in the prayer line and they would get healed and then they would die tomorrow or they would die in a few months but the main thing the main theme was to actually be in good health spiritually to have our souls in the position that we need them to be to have the Seal of God inside of us but you know we've been talking about God's Will and and the importance of understanding it and that it's not necessarily a destination or an accomplishment even though it is we want everything that we do to be according to God's will we want it to be his will for our life but we we for those people who haven't been around I'll just do a quick little recap we had been talking about the the fact that I I had struggled for a while in my life to understand that God's will is his word we know it's a quote um brother bradam says it I'll be bringing it here um and maybe I should just bring it uh I'm going to have to it it'll come I've got it in here we uh I I just wanted to express this on on my heart I believe the Lord put it there to understand that God's will is his word and it's not necessarily an accomplishment or an achievement it's not a place that we go to necessarily it is realizing that his will is his word and everywhere we go and everything that we do his word needs to be Paramount if we keep his word out front of us then everything will work out to the good because we know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord a and all things work together for the good to those who are called according to his purpose and those people who are called according to his purpose are going to have the desire to express that DNA that we had talked about a little bit earlier we we we preached on a little while ago we could see Cain's DNA and it makes it so easy to see the the topic of serpent seed how Cain was of the wicked one his father was the devil now some people would say oh they had some kind of act in the garden did they what was it that happened in the garden we know what happened in the garden but why is it that they would try and say that some kind of fruit eating of the fruit would cause the downfall of mankind the fall of Man we know that it wasn't that and we could say that that there was an act or or something happened whether they ate fruit or or whether there was some sort of a relation we we know that there was some sort of an action but the first action and the worst action that ever could have taken place was to reject the word of God because anything outside of the word of God is actually going to be false it's going to be death one word off is Satan's Eden it's not the Garden of Eden talk talking about our scripture today I just think it's so beautiful if we could just dwell on this for a little bit out of the first Epistle of John Chapter 2 I write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake they're already done they're already forgiven all we have to do is accept it talks to the fathers and and and says I write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because ye have known the father all of these are past tense phrases ye have known the father your sins are forgiven you you've overcome the wicked one amen I want to ask a question how many people here this morning and I'm asking for a hand raise how many people feel like they've overcome the wicked one there's a few hands but not every hand because we can't rely on our feelings if we say I feel like I've overcome I don't know I I would kind of want to say have you because our feelings get in the way but you know what the prophet said that our feelings have nothing to do with it the baptism of the holy spirit is without sensation brothers and sisters it just is and when we follow the word of God God does the work in fact God's already done the work alls we do is accept the fact that he has I've written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because ye are strong you are strong you don't have to feel weak Satan's going to say you're weak Satan's going to say that you can't overcome but if you say nope I take the word of God over every single symptom over every single feeling over every single circumstance you've already overcome Satan's already already defeated and the interesting thing is he knows it he knows it but do we know it love not the world neither the things that are in the world this is tough because there's things in this world that are enjoyable but put the word first brothers and sisters in every situation and you know the the things of this world will grow strangely dim how in the light of his glory and his grace when we esteem him above everything else in our lives we'll come to the place where we won't love the things of this world nor the things that are in the world but we know the word says if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him and you know how would we identify that I'm just going to talk about his word today it's going to be about his word and that is his will but today brothers and sisters if we put anything in our life before the word guess what there we are what we're doing is we're actually loving the world anything in front of his word we know it's idolatry but I want to say verse 15 says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loved the world oh my the love of the father is not in him remember Eve in the Garden of Eden she loved the father didn't she but was the love of the father in her because she took one word deviation and what happened it put us where we are today verse 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and you know he says the very next verse 17 and the world passeth away the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life the images that we get in our minds about ourselves about other people about other circumstances they're all going to pass away brothers and sisters all of them but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever what's the will of God his word his word it's such a beautiful thing it it just really became so apparent to me I had this question in my mind and and I know my pastor he said it to me when I was younger um God's will is his word it was a direct quote from the prophet we'll get into it and and it just made me think how it's such a vague statement how can it be I I just need an answer Lord I don't understand this can you please tell me and it was probably a couple of years three years later the Lord finally came around and said you want an answer and it was that plain I was driving one day so you want an answer to your question and I'm thinking what I'm not hearing an audible voice if you've ever heard God speak to you you know what I mean so you want an ask answer to your question I was like okay when I got over myself I said okay this must be God okay sure I'd love an answer that'd be wonderful he said okay God's will is his word take a look at Joseph take a look at Joseph's life every step of the way that Joseph went he was in God's will he didn't deviate from the word of God take a look and and I I I thought my really I need to study this out so I went and started to look at it and then he said you know what I know that you don't want just one you want two you want two two scriptural identifications and I said yeah you know me and and what did he say he said look at Daniel Daniel's life the story of Daniel he he was carried away into bondage we'll get into all of this as we go but both of them through tremendous trials and circumstances in their life never one time deviated from the word of God they followed their teachings and what did God do he blessed their way oh my but they went through the Press didn't they they went through the trial they went through the tribulation if anyone had reason to maybe get a little upset with God to think why am I here he was Joseph was the one with the coat of many colors and he found himself thrown into a pit abandoned by his brothers what a terrible feeling that must have been did he hear his brother say go home and tell Daddy that a wild animal killed him will soak his coat in blood can you imagine being in the pit of despair literally thinking no thoughts now everyone's going to think that I'm dead what's going to happen to me then to be sold into slavery but to never give up on God and we know the story very well he he he went down into P Piper's house and was wrongly accused and then he was thrown in jail and even while he was in jail what happened he kept God first no doubt he had prayer meetings there no doubt he had Services there and what happened God blessed them God blessed the prison for his sake and God allowed that prisoner to become the head of the prison where does that happen all we know the stories I'm I'm I'm getting way ahead of myself here I I'm just fascinated with this first John chapter 2 and and how the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever what is the will of God brothers and sisters it's his word it's keeping his word first and Paramount in our lives and what truly is the word for our day now we can go a little bit further with that what was the word for the day in in the day of Jeremiah it was the prophet word it was the word from the prophet God only speaks to people through the prophets and what is it today it's through the prophet but the whole world is against it you know the word Prophet doesn't have to be scary I was thinking about it this morning when I was meditating I had to go through this myself when I first started coming around to church here because I kept hearing the word Prophet prophet and I thought I was like why does everybody have to talk about the prophet Prophet Prophet why do they do that they worship a man clearly right but if you just look up the definition of prophet it's a messenger that's what prophet means we're going to get into it you know what the word of God says to watch out for false prophets the word says that but what does it say it doesn't say watch out for prophets it says false prophets and how would we ever know if a prophet is real or false true or false there has to be an answer the prophet from God is only going to say what's already been said the one that we should watch out for is going to have some new spin some new doctrine some kind of edge that nobody else has heard about but you know what if we're not willing to actually look at it then how will we ever get it I know I'm preaching to the choir and I don't mean to this uh this scripture really it just it just inspired me today as you can tell you know as fathers being Father's Day what kind of an example did uh I just can't help but think what kind of an example did did did Joseph and Daniel receive from their fathers what kind of examples were held before them when they were taken out of their lives taken right out of their their way and put into the most adverse circumstances they still wanted to serve God many times we can have children who are not in adverse circumstances or situations who are in the mid of actually maybe a good word-based church but yet the children run away what's up with that brothers and sisters as Fathers as parents mothers and fathers we have a tremendous responsibility the children have got to see the representation of God in their life they need to see daddy in the word daddy who esteems the will of God greater than anything in his life amen that's the reason why Joseph and Daniel were able to do that we know we can say that you know if you're called by God if you have his spiritual DNA then nothing is going to harm you truly nothing is going to harm your soul but you know what if you actually are a true son and daughter of God brother bradam says it in a quote I'm going to get to here brother bradam says it that if you truly are a son and daughter of God if you fail to actually heed his calling he will make sure that you call come to his call he won't leave us he won't never ever leave us nor forsake us but uh I just wanted to read this first John chapter 2: 13-1 17 out of the Amplified Bible this morning and just for the record I'm not promoting another version of the Bible what I'm doing is just trying to shed a little light to have a little bit of a different perspective on the very same scripture just to expound upon it a little bit uh uh verse 13 says I'm writing to you fathers because you know because sorry I'm writing to you fathers because you have come to know recognize be aware of and understand him who has existed from the beginning how would we ever do that outside of the message from a Vindicated Prophet the message of God from a Vindicated Prophet how we ever get to that there's Revelation I'm sure that we would get that I'll carry on here he says I am writing to you young men because you have being Victorious over the wicked one don't put this out there and say that this is going to be someday I'm going to be victorious the word of God says that you are right now already Victorious the devil wants you to believe yeah when you can overcome this one thing yeah when you can overcome the other thing yeah when you get better at this and and you're no longer tempted by that brothers and sisters don't look at the problem if you look at the problem you're going to have a problem look at the end remember the child riding the Schwin bicycle everyone else who was the really good Riders brother Bram said they were riding Uptown Vancouver right they were riding their bikes with no hands going to get Mama groceries with no hands steering the bike they're just riding anybody ever ridden with no hands on a bike it takes a bit of balance but they were doing that but yet when they got on that narrow walk they couldn't do it they fell off why was it because they were looking down is what that kid said he saw what they were doing they were watching close don't watch close don't look at your circumstances or your situation look at the end goal look at the end game I'm writing to your fathers because you have overcome you have sorry because you have come to know recognize be aware of and understand him who has existed from the beginning I'm writing to you young men because you have been Victorious over the wicked one I write to you boys Lads because you have come to know recognize and be aware of the father I write to you fathers because you have come to know recognize be conscious of and understand him who has existed from the beginning I write to you young men because you are strong and vigorous and the word of God is always abiding in you in your hearts and you have been Victorious over the wicked one do not love or cherish the world or things that are in the world if anyone loves the world love for the father is not in him you can't serve God and Mammon at the same time for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh craving for sensual gratification and the lust of the eyes greedy longings of the mind and the pride of life Assurance in one's own resources or in the stability of Earthly things my look at the Kingdom that I've made in I I've made it look at the Kingdom that I've created look at how good I am how much of a a tremendous father I am you know brothers and sisters carefully we need to just really make sure that we're we're speaking clearly we can say look at how good of a religious example that I am to my family you know the worst spirit is a religious spirit the word of God says to humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and how do we do that one to another come to church is not humbling yourself in the sight of the Lord brothers and sisters coming to church is coming to church everyone comes to church polished up we've talked about in the past how the young people can look at the elders and think there's nothing wrong in their lives they don't have any struggles but you know what they're the battle scarred Veterans of this word they're the ones that know how to get through the trials and how do you get through the trials you get back up it's a pretty simple thing the pride of life the Assurance in one's own resources or in the stability of Earthly things these do not come from the father but are from the world itself and you know we talked last time about the image not the image of Nebuchadnezzar but the image that Nebuchadnezzar had made for Daniel the one that he recognized the the spirit of spirits of the Gods resided in him he had the ability to not only interpret a dream but to actually tell the dream first and nobody else could do that but the image how we can have an image there's never been an age with with such a tremendous push on image on what it means to have an image in this world you know if that's the case it's of the world brothers and sisters and you know the world passes away and disappears and and we know that the image of of Daniel did the very same thing verse 17 out of the Amplified Bible says and the world passes away and disappears and with it the Forbidden Cravings the passionate desires the lust of it but he who does the will of God and carries out his purposes in his life abides remains forever amen I just think it's so wonderful his will is his word no matter where we're at no matter what we're going through no matter who we're going through it with and what it's for keep God first brothers and sisters keep him first and even if you find yourself in his permissive will we know the prophet said that he'll take that permissive will and he'll make it his perfect will every single time out of out of the power of transformation brother Bram talking about Cain we had mentioned Eve already missing one word being one word off paragraph 246 he says he Cain knew the perfect will of God can you imagine that he knew the perfect will of God Cain knew it why but he just refused to do it and we know that in the garden all he had to do was what God instructed him to do he didn't want to do it but God even came came around and said hey if you just do like your brother just just do like him you you'll be accepted there was something inside his heart to say no no no no no no no no you don't see you don't see it man I I I've got an image I've got an image to protect here now I'm not going backwards on my stand pride is a terrible sin and we know that was exactly what his father had in heaven right brother Adam says he K knew the perfect will of God he knew he knew the perfect will of God Cain knew it why but he refused to do it he proved then to be the Serpent's Seed because of the DNA because of the life that he lived it demonstrates who we are brothers and sisters we can say all we want but the life we live is going to demonstrate who's our father but he refused to do it he proved then to be the Serpent's Seed when he seen the perfect will of God he refused it he had seen God vindicate Abel's message oh my and it just got him so upset didn't it look it he came and appreciated Abel he didn't appreciate me and what happened the word of God says his countenance fell and God called him out on it said what's your problem boy why is your countenance down he seen God vindicate Abel's message and what did God say to him and he just he said do the same do worship like your brother and you'll do well but you see he seen the perfect will of God but he didn't want to do it see he wanted to add something to it and these theologians see this Bible they read it but they don't want to do it my just going to let that soak for a little bit because brothers and sisters whether we go to a Bible school or or whether we have the message search on our phone whether we know the message for decades and decades and decades if we're not willing to actually do the word of God according to the message of the hour who's our father we certainly want to encourage everyone to do the will of the father we would that everyone would come you know brother bradam said my my objective is to take as many people with me as I can and that's what we want to do but the only way we're going to go is to do the will of the father because everything else in this world's going to pass away if you would just do like your brother and and you'd do well but you see he seen the perfect will of God but he didn't want it see he wanted to add something to it he wanted to Worship in his own way the prophet of God gave us a very specific direction for our day and for us to refuse that brothers and sisters I want to make this super clear crystal CLE clear I'll probably say it a couple times there's no no no no way that we can just be Lolly gagging around with this message of the hour this is time to preach fire and brimstone brothers and sisters it's life or it's death it's not time to play to reject one word of the messenger one word of the message of the hour isn't to reject the messenger and sometimes you see people they feel like maybe they can do that that's actually not rejecting the messenger that's rejecting God you're not rejecting the message you're re ing God we heard it on Wednesday with brother Jack it was so good those seven Church age Messengers when they came if you receive their message you receive God but to reject them you reject God there's no fooling around here one of these days the church is going to be gone and we know that there's probably call it two churches we'll say that there's one Capital CCH church and there's one little sea church one one church has enough oil for the journey and the other church just has oil but just not enough oil because when the shout comes forward to say that the bridegroom has come rise and trim your lamps oh my all 10 versions rise up and trim their lamps try to get them going but the the the five they recognize oh no I can't get my lamp going I can't get that flame up a little higher to make it nice and bright what's going on I don't have have any oil that's why we want the Holy Ghost the oil in the lamp typifies the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters and these theologians paragraph 247 see this Bible they read it but they don't want to do it and that's why I think it's so good with the message of the hour because the message isn't a new message the message actually just ties up the Loose Ends that are in the Bible the message of the hour points back to the King James version Bible Well you get these theologians they see they see this Bible they read it but they don't want to do it see oh my it shows their serpent seed otherwise they would want to do it they've seen it Vindicated and so simply before the people but it seems like it's so hard for people to Humble themselves to the word of God wear what wear a skirt don't cut your hair ever 10% my all these things all these different things that we know we've we've seen come in our day what is God's will it's his word brother Bram he says let me give you something a little shocking sorry this is out of one in a million let me give you something a little shocking see not all that says unto me Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father amen his will is his word period his will is his word we can be ever so religious have great shouting times great times shouting jumping in these meetings which I I don't want to be critical but I have a duty to God and that duty is to be sincere and to say what he wants me to say and and I want to say this any Minister sitting standing behind a Pulpit according to the message of the hour any Minister standing behind a Pulpit they have to be sincere and they ought to say what the prophet said it's vital I just love that let me give you something a little bit shocking isn't it interesting to think that there's going to be people that will be there that day and say didn't we have a tremendous outpouring of the spirit we cast out Devils we raised the dead we saw people who were sick healed remember Judas had a Ministry just like that but Judas wasn't one of the 12 was he he he was given power my goodness we uh we we were getting into into this real strong in the exposition of the seven Church ages but you know it's all about instruction isn't it brothers and sisters it's all about training up the children in the way they should go and you know in the book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 9 it says only take heed to thyself and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy Sons Sons such a beautiful thing isn't it when you're a father you don't stop being a father when your children grow up and and move out of your house you're still a father when you're a grandfather you're just a better father because you don't have to worry about the correction all you have to do is encourage at that point and and it's such a beautiful thing because sometimes a grandfather can see things that a father can't but this Deuter omy 4:9 only take heed to thyself and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thine heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy son's Sons especially the day that thou stood us before the Lord thy God in Horeb when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the Earth and that they may teach their children it's beautiful because you have two people speaking here but one message isn't that true God ministering through his Prophet to the people the minister being the prophet is just bringing what the Lord has told him that they should teach their children in Proverbs 22:6 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not apart from it and you know brothers and sisters that scripture is so prevalent it's such a good one we worry many times about our children and uh how children can actually be a little bit Wayward we don't need to worry about them commit them to the Lord trust in the Lord with all your heart make sure that you train them up in the way they should go don't give them a double standard don't let them see a different daddy at home than they see at church don't let them see a different daddy in the car than they would see at church make sure that our yay is yay and our nay nay we can preach the message all we want but if the children see a different personality guess what it's a mixed signal and they're going to think my my my I don't know how I can ever do that I don't ever want to do that why would I want to do that we need to make sure that we have the same message Naturally Speaking brothers and sisters children specifically to the children there's always going to be a guy there's always going to be that guy no matter where it is we go isn't it he's going to be in our school he'll be in our class he'll be on the bus we could find him maybe as a boss or a teacher maybe as a neighbor and what I mean by the guy is the guy that just says stuff that just totally gets under our skin there's going to be a guy maybe it'll be a girl maybe it'll be a woman there's going to be a person in our life that's always going to grind on us and rub us the wrong way a and if you've lived you know what I'm talking about but you know what brothers and sisters you got to overcome that you got to be able to look beyond that personality trait and see what the main objective is that might be a person that's actually a son and daughter of God and you know naturally speaking in the world we have to contend with people like that we have to contend with some very abrasive people in our jobs our careers our schooling maybe even in our families amen um but what about church many times we can bear with people tremendously in a job oh my but at church oo nope not going to church I'm going to stay home and play tapes because of that brother because of that sister because of that song leader because of this because of that because of the other God's not going to say oh because of that that's okay you didn't have to actually follow my word knowing that my word is my will you don't worry about it it's okay we'll just make it no no no no no it's not that way his word is his will we've got to follow his word you know brother bradam said the reason I'm saying this is I want to get to this point brother bradam he said it very clearly in the exposition of the seven Church ages in the Ephesian Church age and brother Jack read it I believe on Wednesday he he said maybe he didn't somebody did never let anything get between you and that word amen and when we let a situation or an issue stop us from coming together to worship the Living God we've let something get between us and that word and you know what that is that gets between you and that word brothers and sisters the devil wants us to say oh it's that it's that thing it's that thing look at that thing that thing's in the way we can't go and worship because of that thing you know what it is it's not that thing it's the devil it's just the devil and he's going to masquerade and hide behind a circumstance or a situation and we're going to say well it's this or it's that it's not that it's the devil we just need to recognize that never ever let anything get between you and that word word never Matthew 7:3 enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there will be which go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few there will be that find it now this is what we talked about a little bit earlier I jumped ahead of myself but beware beware brothers and sisters be careful be very aware of your surroundings and your environment because there's going to be false prophets beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing my but inwardly they are ravening wolves and you know brothers and sisters I personally think this this is just me my personal thoughts I just want to let you know that I'm not trying to come down on anybody or or any Ministry out there I I personally believe that some of these people they don't even recognize that they truly mean weal they truly mean to bring the word of God they truly mean to encourage people to Christ and they don't even recognize where they stand they don't recognize the spirit that's actually influencing them beware of false prophets how are we going to be able to know whether they're false prophet or not you got to know the word of God and you know there's one thing to know the word of God to know chapter and verse but it's another thing altogether to know the author but when you know the author you know the word that's why we say you've got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost let this mind that was in Christ be also in you if you don't do that brothers and sisters you're just going to be a theologian and I promise you I guarantee you this if you're a theologian and that's as far as it goes maybe you know all maybe you're a message Theologian they exist maybe you're a Biblical Theologian Maybe you've got Bible School under your belt maybe you've got all that there but if you don't have Christ in you do you have a hope of glory we've got to have him inside of us we will be misled that's what my guarantee is if you just have all of the knowledge but you don't have the life I promise you you will be misled you will be deceived there's no way around it because it will be so close at the very end that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible and there's only one way that it's not possible brother bradam brings it out very very clearly that only one way is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost many people say I've been baptized already brother Barry have you been baptized in Christian baptism according to the book of Acts why didn't any of the Apostles baptize anybody in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost if that was a thing why didn't they why isn't there a Biblical account of someone being baptized that way oh but there is people being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why is that because that's what this message is for this message was to what restore all things we heard about it on Wednesday it was so good how many enjoyed that message from Brother Jack my it was good so glad that we were able to make his acquaintance God bless you brother Jack if you're listening my what a wonderful message and brother Mario last Sunday just been a wonderful time feeding at the table of the Lord and you know many people here probably aren't aware of this but we've been studying the exposition of the seven Church ages and we have come to the place in the pergan church age where where it is is it a perian s seean I'm getting myself all mixed up we're getting to the place where brother bradam talks about pick up your pen and write and I stopped just before we got there and and just right at the very beginning pick up your pen and write and and how tremendous of a message that is and brother Bram talks about how it's got to do with the bride and the word and and and I stopped there on a Wednesday night service and then we had brother marot Chua come from from Arizona and and he what does he do he picks up his pen and starts just talking right from where we left off just such a beautiful thing and then on Wednesday night the very next service three services in a row we have brother Jack Duff from from Florida we've never talked about any of this never talked to brother Mario there's no discussion about it and suddenly we're talking about pick up your pen and write brothers and sisters I wanted to bring that today but I just wanted to stick with it God's Will and and his word but what a tremendous thing it is to know the spirit of God is moving this is not a a human thing that's happening this is God speaking to us but beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them isn't it beautiful you get the warning and then you get the identification you shall know them by their fruits what's the life they live brothers and sisters not how much money do they make what kind of business they've got what kind of job what kind of degree what kind of clothes what kind of house where they live geographically how many people are in their family what kind of church they have how big is their Church what kind of music program no it's got nothing to do with it what's the fruit are they leading people encouraging people to Christ the only way they're going to be able to do that is by the word for our day and that's to the message of the hour just simply saying what the prophet said but then living it that's the only way we're going to know them is by their fruit beware of false prophets which comes to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are are ravening wolves isn't it wonderful how brother Jack he brought that on on Wednesday I just have to say it I got to go back to it it's just beautiful if William Mariam Bram was so off on his Doctrine then why did God continually back him up didn't matter where he went he said whether he was in Florida whether he was in Calgary he would say so and so with such and such on you're here and address is this and you're not here for you you're here for your brother or for your sister your mother your father how could he do that the spirit of God but why would God back him up if he was so far off on his Doctrine just doesn't make any sense rationally speaking it's just irrational ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit and you know we can go right back to the Garden of Eden here I'm not going to do it for long just going to touch on it remember there was two trees in the Garden of Eden right one the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and the other one the tree of life and we know thoroughly that those were were were clearly identified as persons people right Jesus Christ and the devil you shall know them by their fruits even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit so you don't have to worry brothers and sisters you're not going to bring forth evil fruit it's not possible neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is Heen down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them by the life they live by their willingness to subject themselves to the word of God that's the only identification brothers and sisters that's why the prophet in our day brought the identification the true identification of the Holy Ghost is to be able to align with the word of God for your day to be able to say Amen to the word of God verse 21 says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven what is his will his word and what's the will for today the message of the hour that's not William Mary and bram's message brothers and sisters we know that it's God's message given to his messenger many will say to me in that day that great white Throne Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then I will profess to them I never knew you and you know brothers and sisters we were talking about this a little while ago this goes beyond a handshake the introduction of of brother so and so and the Lord Jesus Christ it goes well beyond that this goes into the the intimacy of a a relationship a husband and a wife where the twain become one where they're no longer separate and I will profess unto them I never knew you I never had a personal relationship with you what's the new birth personal relationship with Jesus Christ him making himself known personally to the individual then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity those people that knew they should do and don't and those people that knew they shouldn't and do that's iniquity therefore whosoever he heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock upon a what a rock a rock a revelation an understanding of of the word of God something that didn't come from flesh and blood but came from my Father which is in heaven and the rain descended and floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a what a rock a revelation and when that happens nobody can take it from you verse 26 and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his Doctrine I just this gets me excited brothers and sisters because when you think about this for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes I just couldn't help but think maybe he got just a little bit Pentecostal while he was speaking these words maybe he actually got excited and started to preach you know we we we said this out of the exposition of the seven Church ages these seven Messengers are making known making God known to the people each one of the seven Church age Messengers he that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them and those that reject him unfortunately they're not rejecting him and that's what the PO world doesn't really see when you know and we're not talking about the world what I want to talk about very spefic specifically is the people that will take 99% of the message of the hour but just leave that one thing out when we leave that one thing out brothers and sisters we might as well leave it all out because we're actually not doing what we're supposed to as Sons and Daughters of God we being disobedient my now let's get into our our study this morning I like to talk a little bit about Joseph I just think it's wonderful his story to recognize that he was the first son of Rachel the one whom Jacob Loved At First Sight we know the story very well he was loved by his father hated of his Brethren hated the more the the more that he expressed who he was like a sheep expresses wool and a a dove just expresses white as Joseph expressed Joseph he was hated the more and there was nothing that he was doing he was just being he was just being himself but his brothers they persecuted him and we know that he was persecuted by his brother and he was rejected of his brother we know the prophet said that Joseph was actually a type of Jesus Christ and we know that the further he was rejected the farther down he went all the way down into the grave and what did he do he rose all the way up and sat at the right hand of pharaoh the most powerful position in the land we know that that not a person moved in Egypt without acknowledging Joseph when he came around nobody ever didn't recognize his his position but you know Joseph never let any of that get between him and that word and I would think if we were basing our lives on opportunity to say that I've got this situation and I've had that problem and I've got this thing and the other then if anyone had the opportunity to say I've got a reason I got a right to be maybe a little bit bitter a little bit down this man would have that wouldn't he but something never let him get there out of the pergan church age brother bradam he says he knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word not by leaving church by leaving the word amen hallelujah but you know what if we leave church I want to say are we sticking with the word he knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left God that's powerful if we take some sort of substitute if we take some other Avenue other than the message for our hour what are we doing brothers and sisters we said it earlier on I think it's real sad it's a real difficult thing but we're not rejecting the minister we get fed up and say brother Barry or we get fed up and say brother so and so it's that Ministry it's not that Ministry it's God because if we really believe the word I want to say it and I'm sure we all know it but have you experienced it you could change what's being preached you have the ability to operate the gifts and it's not just in the preaching of the word it's in the playing of the music it's all the ministry if you want to see different music if you want to see different temples if you want to see different worship then start praying and see if God won't come on the scene because we either serve a living God or we serve a dumb Idol right and we serve a living God if you leave that word brothers and sisters you haven't left the church you haven't left brother Barry you haven't left the other Pastor you haven't left whoever whatever you've let something get between you and that word and if you leave that word you've left God you know Joseph he had parents that taught him they trained him up in the way that he should go we know that his mom passed away but there was a bunch of other moms around in Joseph's life after his mom died and you know even when he was real little you can just imagine that Rachel was actually singing songs to him teaching him about the prophets the law of Moses and his parents raised him up they taught him we can teach and preach our children all we want but we can't save them we have to train them up in the way they should go and and let them have a personal experience with Christ for themselves but I would say woe unto us if we make excuses and don't train up our children in the way they should go if we teach our children that it's okay to just leave church it's okay to just you know stay home and play tapes or make excuses if we start doing that brothers and sisters we're going to answer for our children who potentially don't serve God it it's not going to be something that we can just say oh it's okay it's their thing I just dedicated them to God and they'll be fine as parents we do have a responsibility that's why I say God bless you fathers for being the lead role in the home we know that in the Garden of Eden God never came down and said eve what have you done God came down and said Adam Adam and every single man who is a father and a husband God is going to hold that man responsible for that family he's not going to say oh you've got to pass your children will rebellious why were they rebellious what were the dinnertime conversations about the pastor about the brother about the sister about the teacher about the boss brothers and sisters our children are listening and it behooves us to make sure that we are prudent with the word of God they need to see the same person at the dinner table at home that they see sitting in church all polished up serving God and if they don't brothers and sisters they're getting an incongruent message they're going to think there's something funny either there's something funny with the church group or there's something funny with our home and you know what can happen is the children will typically say there's something funny with the church group that's what's going to happen the devil's going to get in their head he's going to give them rock and roll in movies Maybe video games whatever it is and they're just going to go off we got to be careful we have to make sure that we teach and preach our children but we can't save them I think uh another quote that I just wanted to say these seven Messengers are making God known to the people he that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them that's what brother Jack brought on Wednesday these seven Messengers are making God known to the people he that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them talking about Daniel we know that he must have been taught by his parents and just so beautiful because he would have been taught the prophet Isaiah and the Prophet Jeremiah he he would have been taught all of that stuff he would have been told you know what repent he would have heard all of that over and over and over again oh another message repent get back in line with the word they would have taught that over and over and that was the only way for them even when their city was under siege he heard them say he heard the prophets say you know what you can go out and surrender go surrender to King Nebuchadnezzar and you'll live you'll live as a slave for the rest of of your lives for rejecting the word of the Prophet but at least you'll live and they wouldn't do that why wouldn't they because of pride pride was there they had an image they had an idea of who they were but Daniel he was taught he heard the word of the prophets and his parents they said above all else take his word take the prophet's word because that's what's going to save you and you know what what interesting is the rest of the city was completely sacked wasn't it those people those those judgment Angels were told to go through the city not sparing women or children old or young to pull your sword and just slay and that's what they did but something saved this man how did he get saved because of his parents teaching they told him listen to The Prophet listen to the word of the prophet and you know it wasn't just that his parents taught him that it was that there was something inside of him something inside of him was able to say Amen to that word and we've heard it a couple times already it's that spiritual DNA we can't even control it you know we will come if we are his sons and daughters of God but you know I just think it's so beautiful Daniel even when he went into captivity what did he do he conducted himself just like that story we've heard the prophet talk about the slave right there was that that group of slaves maybe at that one Plantation but there was just this one he would not act like all the rest of them he had his shoulders back he had his chin up he knew exactly who he was he was the son of the king of the tribe back home and nobody was going to take that from him nobody could take that from him even if they tried to to do something to him and say you're you're you're a different person now they couldn't take that away from him he knew who his daddy was right from the very beginning right Daniel knew that so what did he do he conducted himself as a son of the king and you know even in the midst of the of the the the situation being held captive taken away put into captivity but you know I think it maybe helped him brought maybe a little bit of consolation because he knew that the prophet said this is going to happen this people has rejected God and now captivity is the only thing that's there for you and you know as we study this I I I think it's such a I'm sorry just such a deviation from really where I wanted to go we got 15 minutes left if we're on time uh uh being Father's Day maybe we could get a little extra 10 minutes maybe but uh you know he conducted himself as a Son of God in every circumstance even where they tried to reprogram him and change his identity teach him a new language changed his name brought him into the circumstance gave him new food all of that he said no no no no no I'm not I just will not defile myself and just try me prove that I don't serve a living God prove that my God is a living God and just feed us pulse and we know that his countenance was fair their their countenance those four Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and Daniel their their countenance was fairer just eating pulse than the other ones who were eating the meat and the wine from the king's table and what happened to all the other captives God will not let his own alone he actually changed the circumstances for them and the chief guard he said hey you know what if it's good for these guys it's got to be good for them so we're going to change this all around and he saved the rest of them from completely defiling themselves which is what they were doing but he conducted himself as a Son of God in every s situation in every circumstance he as he went into captivity and you know it it it it wasn't because of his rejection of the word he still held fast to the word of God but he made I just think it's so beautiful he made a conscious decision to intercede for all the rest even those people that he didn't have anything to do with right when when the king had the dream and he called in all of his soothsayers and magicians and the Chans and all those people the sorcerers brought them in and said I've had a dream and I need you to tell me the interpretation and they said oh King oh we'd be happy to do that we just love the the payroll and the position that we've got so just tell us the dream and then we'll give you the interpretation he said you know what if you don't actually tell me the dream then I know that you're a liar and if you are that person then you're going to die I'm going to cut you into pieces and turn your house into a dungill if you can't actually do your job I'm sick of you guys always lying to me and they came to Daniel and said hey you know what The Jig Is up sorry we can't do anything for you now we're going to slay all you people and he said hold on a second I'm a son of a king let's just talk about this for a second uh if you'll just give me just a little bit of time maybe what I could do is take it to my God take it to my daddy just bring the need to him and see if he won't come on the scene and and tell you your dream and we know that he was given the dream he was given the interpretation of the dream we know that's only God there's nobody else that can do that but he still made a conscious decision to intercede is what the word says for those people the people who were against him yeah these were the people that went Green With Envy because we know the very next thing was that image that was erected in his honor Nebuchadnezzar was very much an idol worshipper very much into image very much into image and so what did he do he made an image of Daniel and he told everyone in the land if you don't worship this image of Daniel then you're going to be burned you're going to be thrown into a burning fiery furnace because this guy there's something special about him and he's my guy he's in my court he is on my team and if you don't follow what I tell you worshiping this guy you're done for I don't want nothing to do with you and so what happened his friends Shadrach Meshach and Abed ago they we know the story all too well right what did they say they said no way ain't G to happen it's our friend you you want us to worship our friend you're crazy man and you know when they didn't and they were brought before the king the Chans were very quick to accuse them because they were Green With Envy that they would have some sort of ability to be risen up to their level and we know they were all schooled and educ ated they were brought to the place where they worked they earned the right to be in their position but yet these captives come in and suddenly they're swooped up to the side of the king as advisers how could that be but they just took great great great joy in bringing them in before the king and they said hey we can't do it and the King said you know you're actually starting to get on my nerves you're starting to grade on me I like Daniel and and I tolerated you but now you're getting on my nerves now you're testing me in front of all of my subjects in the land you're going to defy me and they said hey King listen you know what we're not going to be careful to even answer you in this matter and that alone brothers and sisters meant certain death in the court of Nebuchadnezzar you did not defy a king like that and get away with it but they did they said NOP we're not even going to be careful to answer you if God be God then we're going to serve him and that's all we're going to serve we're not going to bow down to no image that you try and erect of our friend we're going to serve the Living God and if it means our life then so be it amen throw us into the furnace because we know that he'll save us either he'll take us home or he'll come on the scene and we know we know we read it last time brothers and sisters now I'm starting to preach I'm starting to get excited because if you remember brother bradam talks about that story and he says let's take the camera and change the angle now and he goes up into heaven and starts talking about the oh my the Angels wormwood oh my how wormwood said you know what I flooded out the anti deluvian destruction I wiped the face of the Earth everything with breath in its lungs oh my there's a real hot furnace down there have you seen what's going on Lord I could go and deal with that right now and he said no don't worry about it we know we know Gabriel drew his sword and said do you see what they're doing down there we've been watching them all night God said don't worry about it I got this under control but what happened he didn't send his Angel the point I want to get to is he came himself he came down himself into the fiery furnace for his children who were willing to not be careful to answer the king of the age they were willing to serve the Living God and why is that it was because they were taught they were trained up in the way they should go and what did God do he came down and he blessed them and even the king said whoa didn't we just throw three people in the fire I see four oh my and that one looks like the Son of God just so beautiful isn't it it's amazing to think about how the Lord dealt with these two men Joseph and Daniel every situation every circumstance they just put God first they just put God first that's all we need to do brothers and sisters is put God first in every situation of our lives and you know what it'll turn out right but if we're willing to deviate on the word of God because of some tradition because of some teaching because of whatever it is we've got it's not going to turn out right it's going to turn into a problem I think it's so beautiful going on to chapter 4 of of Daniel if you want to turn over there with me we've still got a couple minutes he made a conscious decision every single day to stay with the word to to intercede for those people around him that really needed help he kept himself chased to the word and you know he could only be who he was he couldn't try even if he tried to he couldn't be someone else I think it's just so good for us to remember don't try and be anybody else brother brandham says that very clearly just be you just let God manifest through you the way he created you he created every one of us to be just a little bit different for a reason so we could be flowers in his bouquet in Daniel chapter 4 Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people Nations and languages that dwell in all the Earth peace be multiplied unto you I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me how great are his signs and how Mighty are his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and his Dominion is from generation to generation interesting to see his perspective now he's given glory to the Living God verse four I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house and flourishing in my Palace makes me wonder brothers and sisters how many times we can be at rest in our house and just flourishing in our Palace don't be flourishing in your Palace be resting in the Lord be resting in in the word be resting in the word of the Living God making sure that he is first and when that happens then you will flourish you won't have to say it you won't have to show anybody people will say what are you doing man how come are you so flourishing but you won't be saying in the mirror look at how much I'm flourishing in my Palace what for time sake I'm just to Jump Ahead we know that he had a dream he had this dream verse 8 he he called in Daniel he started to identify the Living God he said you know what I know there's already a guy I got a guy and we're going to call him in here in verse eight says but but at the last Daniel came in before me whose name was belto shazar according to the name of my God and in whom is the spirit of the Holy Gods before him I told the dream now we know that Daniel gave him the interpretation of it for time sake I'm not going to read it all I will let us do that but you know the the the Living God said that this guy needed to actually go and be humbled and every single man that will actually uplift himself boost himself try and shine an image to The World God will abase that man there's no way that we're going to escape that especially if we are a son and a daughter of God he knows exactly how how to Humble us but you know this this dream happened and it was a dream about the tree and the shade and how how he had this image and uh God had to show him God had to show him if we jump down to verse 28 we know that Daniel gives him the interpretation of this dream shows him that it's his kingdom and that you know what the Watchers have said they brought back an evil report to the the father above and and he said you know we we're going to have to do something about this we're going to cut this tree down but we're not kill it we're just going to cut it down and all of the the the flourishing in the branches of the animals and the shade that this this this giant Ministry brought to the kingdom it's going to be chopped down but there's going to be a root there and that root will still come again so verse 28 says and all this Came Upon King Nebuchadnezzar at the end of 12 months he walked in the Palace of the kingdom of Babylon 12 months after hearing the word of God the interpretation of this dream the interpretation came true verse 30 says the king spake and said is not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of the Kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty and while the word was yet in the king's mouth there fell a voice from Heaven saying oh King Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall Drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and if you jump down to verse 37 we we know seven times went passed over him he went out seven years into the Wilderness isn't it interesting that his kingdom remained though they waited for him verse 37 now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and exall and honor the king of Heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in Pride he is able to abase don't let Pride have a foothold in your life brothers and sisters there ain't one of us that's got any good in our lives not one of us the only thing that's good is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's just amazing to look at this he had the ability to be humbled even whilst he was flourishing in his Palace that that it it's just kind of humorous the way that he wrote that but you know he had that out of the exposition of the seven Church ages brother bradam talking about his will being his word understanding that it is very important to keep this word in front of us but we can say which word we we want to remember that the prophet used the King James version Bible and that word is the word that we want to keep before our eyes we don't want to make excuses for it and say well I think there's some other scripture some other Bible some other interpretation you know brother Barry he will read from the Amplified Bible but I don't make that my absolute absolute is the King James version Bible the Bible that the prophet for our day used that God used to expound the word through that's the Bible we look at the exposition of the seven Church ages I just love this one brother Brown Andy says even so today God tells folks to go ahead in their own heart's desires that's why we need to make sure that we we we have a new heart in us don't we maybe I'll call the musicians I don't want to make anybody nervous here will close soon but you know we sing that song create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit in me even so today God tells folks to go ahead in their own Hearts desires for they have already rejected the word you're going to do it anyways might as well go ahead that's why people have ask the question did God change his mind does God change his mind we know that the the message that brother brandham preached talking about balum and baac does God ever change his mind about his word nope his first thought is the only thought his first word is the only word but pseudo theologians would like to try and actually put a spin on it and say wow there's another interpretation for today no there isn't there's no other interpretation other than his original thought which is his word because he's the same yesterday today forever the word changes not the whole world will change the whole world will pass away but heavens and earth oh my to think that they will pass away but his word will remain my he says they've already rejected the word but the will of God will be done regardless that's so beautiful you know we we talked about a little while ago and Lord willing will maybe pick up from from here talking about God's perfect will and his permissive will we we said it very vag before and and and broad spectrum and I'll say it again now is simply this one word off is God's permissive will because we can have 99% of the word but we just can't do that one thing just can't come to communion service just can't wash my brother's feet just can't do this just can't do that that's one word off that's God's permissive will God's perfect will is his whole word saying just be it unto me according to Thy word I don't think I can ever do that on my own and you know what brothers and sisters there ain't one person that can serve God according to his word on their own and that's why you see people fall away because they've been taught some sort of form of tradition some sort of hybridization of a a theological study out there and try and mingle it with the message of the hour you'll never do that God will never ever mix with denomination ever he says go ahead though they've already rejected the word but the will of God will be done regardless amen he says I hope you see this it will not only clear up much of what is seen in all ages but it will especially help in this last age which has so much manifestation and external blessings when have we ever had so much wealth transfer so much external blessings so many children just waiting for their parents to die so they can actually inherit it's absolutely terrible but it's true the baby Boomer's wealth transition is is an amazing amount of money but this last age which has much manifestation and external blessings when the whole period is so against the word revealed will of God and I'm going to focus on this as we go forwards with this discussion the word revealed will of God not just the will of God being revealed not just the will of God not just the word of God but the word revealed will of God it's got to be not flesh and blood that imparts it because if Flesh and Blood imparts it flesh and blood can remove it but when it's actually a revelation from God when it's from Our Father which is in heaven oh my nobody can take that from you nobody will ever be able to touch that maybe stand with me as we close out of the exposition of the seven Church ages the sardan age brother Bram he says and the way that it was done was by God's perfect will and programming the Lutheran had the Holy Ghost potentially under justification the methodists had it potentially under sanctification and today it's brought back a restoration the Holy Ghost is here amen we don't have to look for another messenger don't look for another messenger there's no other messenger there's people who are prophetic there's a prophetic class of people there's a lot going on don't look for another messenger all of the restoration has happened already we heard on Wednesday so good way better than I could say in the couple minutes we've got here you know what the whole entire word of God has been restored all of it has been restored all the Loose Ends have been tied up there might be other people that come and claim to be Messengers and that's fine but those people who know the word of God who have taken the word and hid it in their heart they know exactly what's gone on we're able to identify who we are as we close today I just want to read this one quote here talking about Father's Day and the importance of being a father and I would say a word-based father for the Bram this is out of questions and answers in 1959 brother Bram he says God has give us the perfect assurance that we are his children isn't that wonderful and it just goes right in line with the scripture that we read this morning out of First John chapter 2 God has give us the perfect assurance that we are his children and as his children he corrects us just like I correct my children you correct your children when in the wrong we correct them if my children does wrong then it's my duty as a father to correct them and then if God's children does wrong it's his duty as a father and he will correct you he says just remember that you'll be corrected but remember brothers and sisters the chastening of this present time isn't worthy for the glory that's going to going to be revealed in us and if we're children then we're going to receive the correction and it's not about abuse True Believers don't abuse their children True Believers love their children I'm not getting into an example on how to deal with your children brothers and sisters I'm talking now spiritually how God deals with his children he will correct us if we're gone astray just like we talked about those children of Israel those others who were eatting from the king's table and drinking of the wine they were partaking of things that were wrong but God didn't leave them in error he corrected them and if my children does wrong then it's my duty as a father to correct them then if it's God's children does wrong it's his duty as a father and he will correct you just remember that you'll be corrected but as long as you're his child the world better keep their hands off you that's right for he said it's far better for you that a millstone was hanged at your neck and you were drowned in the depths of the sea than even to bring an offense upon one of these little ones that believe in me that's right what is that judgment going to be brothers and sisters if you're a son and a daughter of God his his will is truly his word and if you are a son and daughter of God then you'll just line up with his word that's all because that's his will that's what we want the will of the father in our lives God bless you today let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your word thank you for the restoration of your word Lord thank you for not leaving us out in in darkness Lord groping in darkness in Gross Darkness upon the land father but Lord Jesus you showed us that the the morning star has risen father that that that the day
