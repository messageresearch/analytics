[8:25] much further Carpenters had a couple of
[8:28] requests one of them is for a fellow
[8:30] named Bill Ogle he has heart problems in

[8:36] the Netherlands
[8:38] and I believe his name is Chris
[8:41] vanderplas and he has bladder cancer
[8:45] and if you have a need tonight maybe
[8:46] just make it known until you know it's
[8:48] an uplift hand as we go to him gracious
[8:51] Heavenly Father Lord what an honor and a
[8:54] privilege it is to be able to approach
[8:56] your throne
[8:57] father knowing that even in in this
[9:00] flesh and this sinful world that we live
[9:03] in Lord there's something on the inside
[9:05] of the inside that desires to Worship in
[9:08] spirit and in truth father and Lord our
[9:11] desire is to approach you knowing that
[9:14] we can judge ourselves here that one day
[9:16] we won't be judged father Lord we judge
[9:19] ourselves tonight according to your word
[9:21] father and Lord we know that that's our
[9:24] assurance that we can step behind that
[9:26] Veil Lord Jesus and get into that that
[9:29] Holy Place father where you are because
[9:32] we know that you'll invite us into the
[9:34] inner court but it's up to us to take
[9:36] that extra stepfather to approach
[9:38] directly to you
[9:40] and Lord this flesh doesn't want
[9:42] anything to do with it because this
[9:44] flesh is hybrid oh father but when you
[9:47] place a new heart within us when you do
[9:49] the greatest Miracle father and you
[9:51] create us to be a new creature in Christ
[9:54] Jesus oh Father there's nothing that
[9:56] will keep us out of that Holy Place Lord

[10:00] be father we just want to give you all
[10:02] the Praises of our hearts

[10:47] uplift had father Lord we don't approach
[10:50] these these things lightly and we don't
[10:52] come on our own accord but we come

[10:56] know that that's the only place where
[10:58] there is true healing where there is
[11:00] true peace Father Lord Jesus we thank
[11:03] you for that way back to that place of
[11:05] perfection Lord we know that Adam and
[11:07] Eve were banished from it that they
[11:09] stepped down from their position Lord
[11:11] but you and your tender Mercy you came

[11:24] for meeting the requests as we've made
[11:26] them known unto you we just pray Lord
[11:28] that you would have your will and your

[11:34] children Lord let me get out of the way

[11:38] preeminence father speak through me Lord

[12:20] just ask all these things in Jesus
[12:22] Christ's name we pray amen
[12:26] amen thank you musicians
[12:32] you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to
[12:34] read from
[12:36] Saint John
[12:38] chapter 4.
[12:53] are you happy tonight
[12:57] Saint John chapter 4.
[13:00] we'll just start reading with verse 1.
[13:05] when therefore the Lord knew how the
[13:07] Pharisees had heard
[13:09] that Jesus made and baptized more
[13:12] disciples than John
[13:14] though Jesus himself baptized not but
[13:17] his disciples
[13:19] he left Judea and departed again into
[13:22] Galilee
[13:25] it's interesting because he must have
[13:27] known the ministry had taken off
[13:29] the next Ministry the next stage the
[13:32] next level
[13:34] verse 4 and he came
[13:39] and sorry verse 3 and he left Judea and
[13:41] departed again into Galilee
[13:44] verse 4 and he must need to go through
[13:46] Samaria
[13:48] then cometh he to a city of Samaria
[13:50] which is called saikar
[13:52] near to the parcel of ground that Jacob
[13:55] gave to his son Joseph
[13:58] now Jacob's Well was there
[14:00] Jesus therefore being wearied with his
[14:04] journey
[14:05] sat thus on the well
[14:07] and it was about the sixth hour
[14:10] and there cometh a woman of Samaria to
[14:13] draw water
[14:14] Jesus saith unto her give me a drink
[14:17] for his disciples were gone away unto
[14:20] the city to buy meat
[14:23] excuse me then saith the woman of
[14:26] Samaria unto him how is it that thou
[14:28] being a Jew asketh
[14:31] asketh drink of me
[14:34] which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews
[14:37] have no dealings with Samaritans
[14:40] Jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[14:43] knewest the gift of God
[14:45] and who it is that saith to to thee give
[14:49] me to drink
[14:51] that would have had have thou wouldest
[14:54] have asked of him
[14:56] and he would have given the Living Water
[15:00] the woman saith unto him sir thou has
[15:03] nothing to draw with and the well is
[15:05] deep
[15:06] from Once then hast thou that Living
[15:08] Water
[15:10] art thou greater than our father Jacob
[15:13] which gave us the well and drank thereof
[15:16] himself and his children and his cattle
[15:20] Jesus answered and said unto her
[15:22] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[15:25] thirst again
[15:26] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[15:29] I shall give him
[15:31] shall never thirst
[15:33] but the water that I shall give him
[15:36] shall be in him a well of water
[15:39] springing up into everlasting life
[15:44] the woman saith unto him sir give me
[15:46] this water
[15:47] that I thirst not neither come hither to
[15:50] draw
[15:51] Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband
[15:54] and come hither
[15:56] the woman answered and said I have no
[15:58] husband
[15:59] Jesus said unto her
[16:01] thou Hast well said I have no husband
[16:05] for thou Hast had five husbands and he
[16:08] whom thou now Hast is not thy husband
[16:12] in that setest thou truly
[16:16] the woman saith unto him sir I perceive
[16:20] that thou art a prophet
[16:23] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[16:25] and ye say that in Jerusalem is the
[16:28] place where men ought to worship
[16:31] Jesus saith unto her woman
[16:34] believe me the hour cometh when ye shall
[16:37] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[16:40] Jerusalem worship the father
[16:43] ye worship ye know not what
[16:47] we know what we worship for salvation is
[16:50] of the Jews
[16:52] but the hour cometh and now is
[16:56] when the true worshipers shall worship
[16:58] the father in spirit and in truth for
[17:02] the father seeketh such to worship Him
[17:06] God is a spirit and they that worship
[17:08] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[17:11] truth
[17:13] the woman saith unto him
[17:15] I know that Messiahs cometh
[17:19] which is called Christ when he has come
[17:22] he will tell us all things
[17:26] Jesus saith unto her
[17:28] I that speak unto thee
[17:31] am he
[17:33] let's just bow one more time
[17:36] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[17:38] for your word we thank you for this
[17:39] story tonight and Lord we just ask that
[17:42] you would break it open fresh to us once
[17:44] again
[17:45] Lord that we could see you just like
[17:49] that woman at Samaria saw you father
[17:51] Lord we pray that we could just
[17:53] recognize it that it would become so
[17:55] clear to us where we are who we are and
[17:59] where we are standing in the Sands of
[18:01] Time Lord we just ask all these things
[18:04] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[18:07] bless you tonight you may be seated
[18:21] isn't he wonderful
[18:23] how many enjoyed that service on Sunday
[18:26] my
[18:28] there's so many points in there that uh
[18:32] I'm still chewing on God bless you
[18:34] brother Ben
[18:35] certainly appreciate you surrendering
[18:39] and I just want to say a big thank you
[18:40] also to brother Faron
[18:43] for stepping up and taking the songs
[18:44] while brother Paul was sick
[18:47] and it just was a wonderful time it's
[18:50] it's tremendous to hear the different
[18:52] Ministries in the body and you know song
[18:54] leading is a Ministry and I know there's
[18:57] a bunch of songs that we need to learn
[19:00] and I'm excited to be able to learn them
[19:02] it's such a variety of of worship to be
[19:06] able to learn new songs and uh and just
[19:09] be able to to expand our Horizons and so
[19:12] I just want to say a big thank you to
[19:14] brother Faron for stepping in and it's a
[19:16] big responsibility but uh you know we
[19:19] have to set the environment we have to
[19:20] set the atmosphere to hear from the word
[19:22] of the Lord and we know that worship is
[19:24] a tremendous part of the actual service
[19:27] and and God bless you visitors uh
[19:30] I didn't see you there I apologize
[19:33] this is Sister Grace's family
[19:35] yeah from Connecticut God bless you
[19:37] welcome
[19:38] [Applause]
[19:45] I uh I'm sorry I don't have everyone's
[19:47] names so I'm not even gonna attempt it
[19:49] but it's Grace's family we'll be
[19:51] certainly happy to greet you after the
[19:52] service God bless you
[19:56] um yeah it's just uh it's such an
[19:58] important thing to to be able to come
[20:00] and and be a part of the worship and uh
[20:03] set that atmosphere and you know we set
[20:05] the atmosphere in the room we do that
[20:08] but more than anything we set the
[20:09] atmosphere in our heart and that's what
[20:11] brother Branham said about coming to
[20:13] service half an hour early he said to do
[20:15] that that was an instruction from
[20:17] Brother Branham and uh I think some
[20:19] might be able to interpret it and we
[20:21] know that it's it's difficult on a
[20:23] Wednesday I'm not trying to come down on
[20:24] anyone I'm not trying to do that I'm not
[20:27] like that at all I'm just saying what
[20:28] the prophet said and the reason for it
[20:31] the reason for it is to set the
[20:32] atmosphere we want to be able to hear
[20:34] from heaven when we come to church we
[20:36] want to leave this building differently
[20:38] than when we come in and you know the
[20:40] prophet also said that we do whether we
[20:42] recognize it or not we will actually
[20:44] leave here warmer towards God than we
[20:46] were when we came in or we will leave
[20:49] colder than we were before we came in
[20:51] and that's the way it is we're either
[20:53] living or we're dying we're growing or
[20:55] we're shrinking there's no just staying
[20:57] in a neutral position in this world
[20:59] that's not the way that God created life
[21:02] you know we can take a look at plants
[21:04] and and see how plants are they're
[21:06] either growing or they're dying they're
[21:08] they're getting bigger or they're
[21:10] shrinking back and it's the same thing
[21:12] spiritually because we know brother Adam
[21:14] said it the natural types the spiritual
[21:17] so we just want to make sure that we
[21:19] we're in uh in uh I guess the proper
[21:22] order and we're thankful for the
[21:25] direction of the word in our day and
[21:27] we're thankful for each one that puts
[21:28] their heart into the services that puts
[21:31] their shoulder to the wheel week after
[21:33] week all of the musicians the sound
[21:35] technicians every single one is a
[21:38] volunteer nobody has paid for their
[21:40] positions here and uh it's just
[21:43] tremendous the desire that's in the
[21:45] hearts of each one to continually offer
[21:47] their gifts the deacons to stand at the
[21:49] doors the treasure to look after the
[21:51] finances the trustees to make sure that
[21:54] the building is always ready to go for
[21:56] us when we come to church it's it's a
[21:59] body effort and each one plays a part so
[22:02] we're certainly thankful for each one
[22:05] willing to step up and and help
[22:09] um we just have a few announcements
[22:10] before we get into the scripture tonight
[22:12] we'll be traveling next week so brother
[22:14] Emanuel has agreed to take the service
[22:16] on Wednesday we'll be back in time for
[22:18] Sunday service Lord willing and I trust
[22:21] it'll be a blessing I will be likely
[22:23] driving so I'll try and stream and if I
[22:26] can't stream I'll pick up the archive I
[22:29] don't know if everyone is aware that we
[22:30] have the archives I'm just going to
[22:32] mention it they're available on YouTube
[22:34] and uh what a tremendous thing it is
[22:36] I've been listening and listening to
[22:38] Sunday's service and there's so many
[22:40] nuggets in there and so I'll definitely
[22:43] be picking up the service on Wednesday
[22:45] and one of the things that the deacons
[22:48] and I have spoken of and I have failed
[22:51] to mention and I don't know why and I'm
[22:53] sorry for the visitors and everyone
[22:55] that's here is uh just a little bit of
[22:57] housekeeping we're growing in terms of
[22:59] the size of uh people in the
[23:02] congregation we're running out of seats
[23:04] so we're going to start actively pushing
[23:08] everybody forward there's always a hole
[23:09] right here this part's empty all of the
[23:12] time except for when we get into Sundays
[23:14] but then it's sporadic so the people who
[23:17] don't have small children we're going to
[23:18] invite you to move forward as we go
[23:21] forwards the people with smaller
[23:22] children we're going to invite you to
[23:24] move further forward as well so that the
[23:26] back rows are left open for the parents
[23:28] with small children because it doesn't
[23:30] make any sense for a parent with small
[23:32] children to be you know a third of the
[23:34] way up or half of the way up with a
[23:36] small child that can't sit still that
[23:37] makes noise it's the way children are
[23:40] we're not going to say that you have to
[23:41] have your children completely silent in
[23:43] church the only thing is and we've said
[23:45] this for years if your child does start
[23:47] to get a little noisy if it's crinkling
[23:50] papers or if it's talking or if it's
[23:53] crying just simply take it out
[23:55] just just take the child out of the
[23:57] sanctuary and maybe go downstairs with
[23:59] it don't don't don't worry about it
[24:01] being a big fuss nobody's going to come
[24:03] and and try and drag you out of the
[24:05] sanctuary but just be mindful of the
[24:07] people that are around you sometimes as
[24:09] a parent it can be very very difficult
[24:12] to actually pick up the sounds that our
[24:14] children make because we're used to
[24:15] children making sounds but you could be
[24:17] sitting beside someone that's not used
[24:18] to having children crinkling paper and
[24:21] and maybe tapping or clicking pens or
[24:23] doing things that are just like
[24:25] continuous sounds we want to make sure
[24:27] that we keep the reverence of the
[24:29] sanctuary brother Bonham talks about it
[24:31] there's paragraphs and pages that we
[24:32] could talk about keeping the reverence
[24:34] of the sanctuary he even goes so far as
[24:37] to say you know what a child running in
[24:39] the sanctuary could upset the Holy Ghost
[24:41] for the next service
[24:43] so we want to make sure that we are
[24:45] mindful of our children in the church
[24:49] especially when the service is happening
[24:51] so that being said we want to invite
[24:53] everyone who doesn't have the smaller
[24:54] children to move forward fill in these
[24:56] seats here so we leave room at the back
[24:58] for maybe late comers people who are
[25:00] maybe new to the church and for parents
[25:03] with small children I haven't said it
[25:05] we've talked about it for months and I
[25:07] apologize deacons I've said it and I'll
[25:10] just continue to remind us one of the
[25:12] other things I want to throw we talked
[25:14] about in the uh in the deacons meeting
[25:16] was potentially having some of the
[25:17] younger children
[25:19] just come and sit in the front rows
[25:21] and I know that could be a traditional
[25:22] thing that some other churches do but I
[25:24] think there's a reason for it when you
[25:26] start to get like small or larger group
[25:28] and you need to fill in some seats it's
[25:30] an opportunity for the children to
[25:32] actually really be attentive they're
[25:34] right in the front row and I can keep my
[25:37] eye on them
[25:39] it's just uh maybe an opportunity though
[25:42] for the children to feel like they're
[25:44] maybe growing a little bit right they
[25:45] don't have to sit beside mom and dad and
[25:47] I'm not trying to come between parents
[25:49] and children if you want your children
[25:50] to sit beside you then God bless you but
[25:52] I'm just saying that you know it's open
[25:55] if if the children want to do it and the
[25:57] parents are in agreement with it then we
[25:58] certainly welcome it we will be
[26:00] continuing to remind everyone to move
[26:03] forward don't be surprised if you have a
[26:05] deacon tap you on the shoulder and say
[26:06] please move forward or if they try and
[26:09] see you it's not because we're trying to
[26:12] come down on anyone like I said but we
[26:14] need to make room we've been talking
[26:16] about potential next steps with the
[26:18] building if we continue to grow the way
[26:20] we have been where we'll go what we'll
[26:22] do we don't know for now this is what we
[26:25] have and we want to try and make the
[26:27] best of it so if you can just please be
[26:29] mindful of everyone else around you then
[26:31] I'm sure it will make a difference
[26:34] God bless you tonight
[26:36] we appreciate every single one being
[26:38] here
[26:39] tonight I want to talk about this
[26:42] scripture I know I've talked about in
[26:43] the past but just from a little bit of a
[26:44] different perspective two points you
[26:46] know how we ended on verse 26 of of John
[26:50] chapter 4 and and it's Jesus saith unto
[26:54] her I that speak unto thee
[26:57] am he
[27:00] and I think it's just beautiful because
[27:02] you know
[27:04] there's a couple of scriptures in here
[27:06] but verse 25 there's there's a such a
[27:09] dialogue with this story and I think
[27:11] it's so amazing verse 25 the woman saith
[27:15] unto him I know that messiah's cometh
[27:19] which is called Christ
[27:21] when he has come he will tell us all
[27:23] things
[27:24] she was
[27:26] she was waiting for something she knew
[27:29] something was going to happen somewhere
[27:31] along the way somebody taught her
[27:33] she learned that this was supposed to
[27:36] happen and that's why I think it's so
[27:39] beautiful she recognized her day and its
[27:43] message and you know we have the same
[27:46] ability and I know every one of us
[27:47] recognize our day in its message but
[27:50] sometimes maybe it can get a little bit
[27:52] foggy we can get a little bit clogged up
[27:54] as we heard on Sunday we can get those
[27:56] those channels clogged up a little bit
[27:58] maybe with denominational teaching maybe
[28:00] with with Traditions maybe with culture
[28:03] maybe with misunderstandings
[28:06] you know we heard it when we were in
[28:08] Saskatoon brother Wayne brought it so
[28:10] clearly I had asked him years ago and I
[28:12] had forgot about it until we were
[28:14] actually on our way home you know I I
[28:16] think it's in the message things that
[28:17] are to be I could be wrong it's one of
[28:19] the latter messages in 1965 brother
[28:21] brownham he before he gets into the
[28:23] message he starts talking about a vision
[28:25] or a dream and how he saw those people
[28:27] trapped behind those bars and and he saw
[28:31] them and they were they were in trouble
[28:33] and and he saw brother Roy borders in
[28:35] there and he cried out to Roy borders
[28:37] and said I I love you my brother and and
[28:40] he saw them trapped in this situation
[28:41] Behind These Bars and and it wasn't long
[28:44] before the spirit of the Lord said to
[28:46] him deliver those people
[28:48] and and and I guess one of them said to
[28:50] him this is the house of hell I think
[28:52] brother Roy border said that this is the
[28:53] house of hell so brother Brown and he
[28:55] said House of Hell give way to the name
[28:58] of Jesus Christ and set those people
[29:00] free but brother Wayne he brought it in
[29:02] such a way that he said those were bars
[29:03] of misunderstandings
[29:07] misunderstanding so many times we can
[29:09] have a misunderstanding I can be saying
[29:11] one thing to one person and I assume I
[29:14] think they're saying this they're
[29:16] understanding what I'm saying what I'm
[29:17] communicating to them but I come to find
[29:19] out a week later they're not actually
[29:22] they didn't hear what I said to them
[29:24] they didn't understand it they heard it
[29:25] with their ears maybe saw it with their
[29:28] eyes my lips were moving and and my
[29:30] voice and everything maybe my hands if I
[29:32] talked with my hands but they didn't
[29:33] actually understand the message that I
[29:35] was speaking to them
[29:37] sometimes we need to to make sure that
[29:40] we're actually recognizing what's being
[29:43] spoken and what's being said
[29:48] we can have misunderstandings and they
[29:50] can cause a lot of problems and that's
[29:52] why the word of God says if there's
[29:54] ought then just go to your brother your
[29:55] sister
[29:56] and just eliminate that that bar of
[29:59] misunderstanding eliminate a
[30:00] misunderstanding from becoming a bar
[30:03] because sometimes if that happens if it
[30:05] doesn't get resolved then it's going to
[30:06] keep the fellowship from happening
[30:08] there'll always be a space
[30:10] but I just think it's amazing this woman
[30:12] here she recognized it she wasn't living
[30:15] in a perfect condition isn't it such a
[30:18] beautiful story to think that she or she
[30:20] was a a woman with with maybe brother
[30:23] Bradham I think somewhere calls it a
[30:25] prostitute Spirit she's with her fifth
[30:27] not husband the fifth man she's with
[30:30] isn't her husband so what was she doing
[30:33] with her life shacking up with men and
[30:35] and living in sin but she recognized
[30:38] there was no hope for a while for a long
[30:40] time she was probably raised in a call
[30:42] it a message home in her day she was
[30:44] probably taught message teaching in in
[30:47] her time she was probably given the
[30:49] ability to to have a good life a good
[30:51] upbringing but somewhere along the way
[30:53] something happened to her we know
[30:55] there's a story brother bottom I think
[30:56] talks about where someone actually
[30:58] slipped something into the girl's soda
[31:00] pop and she drank it and she became
[31:03] defiled he took advantage of her maybe
[31:05] that happened to this one maybe
[31:07] something happened in it and it caused
[31:09] her to find her off in a position where
[31:11] she was no longer as pure as she desired
[31:14] to be and when that happens in our lives
[31:16] it's easy for the devil to say you know
[31:18] what you're already lost you've already
[31:21] changed your life you've already fallen
[31:23] from Grace so you might as well just go
[31:25] on and and go out there it's never going
[31:28] to get better
[31:29] and you know that's the life that we
[31:31] live that's the condition that we're in
[31:34] but it's so beautiful that we've been
[31:35] given an opportunity to recognize we
[31:37] have to stay there
[31:39] because if we've heard the message of
[31:40] the hour then then I that speak unto
[31:44] thee am he has come we've been able to
[31:47] recognize the coming of the Messiah in
[31:49] our day and that's what I want to get to
[31:51] is is the coming of our messiah in our
[31:54] day many people are looking for the
[31:56] Messiah to be coming riding on a white
[31:58] horse coming in clouds and and it's
[32:01] going to be like that one day brothers
[32:02] and sisters but that's Revelations 19.
[32:05] that's a long ways away in terms of
[32:07] where we're at spiritually today what
[32:10] we're living in today is the word coming
[32:12] of the Messiah and we have the ability
[32:15] to recognize it because you know the
[32:17] word of God says if you can't believe me
[32:20] the words that I speak to you then
[32:22] believe the works that I do because
[32:25] these are they that testify of who I am
[32:29] and we know that was one of the things
[32:31] brother Branham said
[34:58] and not just to who he is but where he
[35:01] is
[35:02] because he's come
[35:05] but Revelation power
[35:08] gifts manifestations of the Spirit
[35:12] and you know when we have his life
[35:14] living within us brothers and sisters
[35:16] it's not a bad thing to have power in
[35:20] fact we need to have his power in our
[35:22] lives and if we don't have his power in
[35:24] our lives then Satan is going to run
[35:26] roughshod over us he's going to
[35:29] steamroll us
[35:32] brother Branham goes on to say the law
[35:33] of sin and death works in the people and
[35:35] the law of Liberty of Christ has come
[35:38] unto us to set us free from those things
[35:42] I think it's just so beautiful
[35:45] I didn't count it
[35:47] but I think I'd like to go back and do
[35:49] it I'm sorry brother Ben I'm not picking
[35:51] on you but I just love that service
[35:52] anybody listen to it again you hear how
[35:55] many times he said holy ghost
[35:57] how important it is to get the Holy
[35:59] Ghost you have to get the Holy Ghost
[36:01] it's not optional the Holy Ghost is the
[36:05] only way that we are going to know for
[36:07] our day so in this day the Samaritans
[36:10] woman she said that she recognized that
[36:13] Messiah is going to come she knew there
[36:15] was a time coming that Messiah was
[36:16] supposed to come which is called the
[36:18] Christ and when he has come he will tell
[36:20] us all things she had full confidence
[36:22] that someday somewhere somehow he was
[36:25] coming to them
[36:26] she was taught that she believed it with
[36:28] all of her heart even though she
[36:30] couldn't live it because of the
[36:31] circumstances that was she as she was in
[36:33] but she had something on the inside of
[36:35] the inside just like a real believer
[36:37] today has to give her the ability to
[36:40] receive it when she recognized it when
[36:42] it came across her path when he came
[36:44] across her path and you know we know the
[36:46] scripture says that when he the spirit
[36:49] of truth comes he will lead us and guide
[36:51] us into all truth he the spirit of Truth
[36:54] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[36:56] and forever the word of God
[36:59] lived out in a Believer today
[37:02] which is the Holy Ghost
[37:04] it's not just us saying oh I'm just
[37:06] going to take the word of God I'm going
[37:07] to study it I'm going to be so good at
[37:10] it just like the just like the Pharisees
[37:12] I remember brother Ken pointing it out
[37:14] the Pharisees or the Sadducees one of
[37:17] the two could roll up the scroll and put
[37:18] a pin through it poke a pin through it
[37:21] and be able to tell you exactly what
[37:22] words of the scripture that pin is
[37:24] actually piercing that's how well they
[37:26] knew the word that's not going to do it
[37:28] for us in our day brothers and sisters
[37:30] studying isn't going to get us in there
[37:32] actual travel going to a a special
[37:35] location isn't going to get us in there
[37:37] the only thing that's going to get us
[37:38] into heaven is the Holy Ghost that's the
[37:41] only thing that's going to open this
[37:42] word to us in our lives
[37:44] brother Branham says so I believe with
[37:46] all my heart I believe that we're
[37:48] nearing the age that where people are
[37:51] going to recognize these things I think
[37:53] it's so beautiful are you recognizing it
[37:55] brothers and sisters he says that we've
[37:58] had so much vain philosophy and so forth
[38:02] and teachings that ought not to be until
[38:04] it has set the human mind to a
[38:07] revolution of thinking on matters of
[38:10] this and that and taking it away from
[38:12] the word of God
[38:13] it's Satan just eroding the word of God
[38:16] from the hearts of of children the
[38:19] hearts of the the Bride of Jesus Christ
[38:23] we don't have to let them
[38:25] we don't have to let them do it we can
[38:27] recognize our position we can recognize
[38:29] our day and its message and know with
[38:32] the surety that we don't have to allow
[38:34] all of that to happen
[38:37] and here I'm saying this brothers and
[38:39] sisters I've got to say it this way I
[38:41] I'll say it that way I believe the
[38:43] message of the hour and I know that I've
[38:45] got to say it that way and I've got to
[38:46] say it with conviction and I'm not just
[38:48] trying to put it on we can say oh
[38:51] brother Barry it's easy for you to
[38:52] preach Divine Healing when you haven't
[38:54] been sick before in your body but you
[38:57] know what brothers and sisters there's
[38:58] coming a day where I know that I'll be
[39:00] sick in my body but what am I going to
[39:01] do I'm not going to groan and lament and
[39:03] say oh I'm sick in my body and I've got
[39:05] to accept the the doctor's report and
[39:07] everything that's happening maybe it's
[39:09] coming for me pray for me I don't even
[39:12] know why I'm going this way the only
[39:13] thing I know is that Divine Healing is
[39:15] truly the children's bread that's what
[39:18] the prophet of God said that's what God
[39:20] Said through the prophet to his people
[39:22] and you know what we need to accept it
[39:24] or we need to reject it and by not
[39:26] accepting it we're rejecting it brothers
[39:28] and sisters we don't remain neutral like
[39:30] we said at the very beginning to say
[39:32] that I'm going to take the doctor's
[39:33] report over everything else the doctors
[39:35] report plus the symptoms and say just
[39:37] you know what this is my circumstance
[39:39] God if you want me to be healed you'll
[39:40] heal me we just need to say his word is
[39:43] greater than any circumstance in my life
[39:50] I love how brother Ben said it on Sunday
[39:52] when we're in different countries we
[39:55] have different privileges citizens of
[39:57] Kingdoms have different privileges
[40:00] and we in Canada probably
[40:02] I would say myself I I don't even fully
[40:05] recognize the Privileges that I have
[40:08] here I've gone to a couple different
[40:10] countries and seen a couple different
[40:11] ways and I've seen some things that have
[40:14] made me very thankful to be able to be
[40:16] back home and I think it's tremendous
[40:18] and you know it's it's amazing how how
[40:22] we can just sometimes take things for
[40:24] granted but here we are living in Canada
[40:26] and we have privileges because we're
[40:28] born as Canadian citizens in every
[40:30] country that we come from we have
[40:32] privileges according to that country
[40:34] that's the way it is when you're a
[40:35] citizen of that country and every
[40:36] country has it maybe some countries have
[40:39] more than others but you know what when
[40:41] we're talking about it spiritually we
[40:43] can't just go into the kingdom of God
[40:45] and obtain privileges it doesn't work
[40:47] that way we need to have a new birth and
[40:50] the only way that we have a new birth is
[40:52] to have a death there has to be a dying
[40:54] out to ourselves and as long as we're
[40:56] willing to do that there will be a new
[40:58] birth and I think it's so beautiful
[41:00] because if we truly earnestly contend
[41:04] for the faith if we are willing to be
[41:06] absolutely honest with ourselves not
[41:09] anybody else
[41:11] everybody else doesn't matter as much as
[41:13] they do we're a body here but I just
[41:15] want to bring it down to the personal
[41:17] level it's got to be that personal where
[41:19] nobody else matters in this world it's
[41:21] between me and God and you we we need to
[41:25] be willing to say just just let this
[41:27] body die let this person inside of me
[41:29] die and and let God live I want to see
[41:32] God live out through me so much that I
[41:35] don't want to see any more of me and
[41:37] just feel me so full of your Holy Spirit
[41:39] your holy ghost that there's no more of
[41:42] me
[41:43] and if we do that if we're willing to be
[41:45] honest about that
[41:47] completely he will fill us
[41:50] he will do it
[41:53] but you know in our our world the world
[41:55] that we live in North America where we
[41:57] have all these privileges
[41:59] it's interesting because brother Ben
[42:00] said it and I think it's just important
[42:02] to to really
[42:04] emphasize this stuff is that Satan he's
[42:07] come around and we know that that this
[42:10] already happened in like 57 was it 57 58
[42:13] when they rejected Jesus Christ when
[42:15] they rejected the Lord Brother Bradham
[42:17] said I indict this generation for the
[42:19] second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
[42:20] Christ and most people said you're crazy
[42:22] now you're going off on your Doctrine
[42:24] when he said that but here we have in
[42:26] this world that we live in in North
[42:28] America Satan now is the God of this
[42:31] evil age and brother Branham said that
[42:33] the prophet for our day said that this
[42:35] is the only age where Satan is the God
[42:38] of this age and here he now enters into
[42:41] the hearts of the people all over the
[42:44] place we've talked about it there's a so
[42:46] many different things about all these
[42:48] pronouns and people and the way all this
[42:51] is going I'm not getting into that
[42:52] tonight but what I am saying is we can
[42:54] see all of that as an actual result of
[42:57] Satan entering into the hearts of people
[42:59] and now they fly a flag that says it's
[43:02] freedom
[43:04] they believe they're free the people are
[43:06] thinking that there's freedom in it
[43:08] when they don't recognize they're
[43:10] completely contrary to the word of God
[43:11] and if we were to actually speak these
[43:13] words to people that believe they're
[43:15] free
[43:16] we would be a fanatic
[43:19] I love how brother Ben brought it as
[43:21] well you know what in our uh in Noah's
[43:24] day Noah's manifestation of the word of
[43:28] God in his life was the ark that he
[43:30] built
[43:32] I thought that was so powerful you know
[43:35] when we have a manifestation in our
[43:38] lives there will be a manifestation in
[43:40] our lives is what I'm trying to say when
[43:42] when God speaks to us when we truly have
[43:44] that death
[43:46] burial and Resurrection in our own lives
[43:48] it's not something that we say oh it
[43:50] just happened in Israel one day or or
[43:52] somebody else in the congregation maybe
[43:54] the pastor the Deacon somebody else my
[43:56] grandma my grandpa my parents they've
[43:58] had that experience but I I haven't had
[44:00] it you know what we have to have it we
[44:02] all have to have it and when we have it
[44:04] something happens in our lives that was
[44:07] said very clearly on Sunday something
[44:09] takes place it's not like it's just wow
[44:12] I just continue to go to church and
[44:13] nothing changes in my life something
[44:15] changes in your life if you ask God to
[44:18] come and fill you with his Spirit
[44:19] brothers and sisters something changes
[44:21] Noah in his day he believed and when he
[44:24] believed he acted on what he believed in
[44:27] and that's what happens in the life of a
[44:29] Believer we act on what we believe if we
[44:32] believe that God sent a prophet then we
[44:34] act on what that Prophet said to us
[44:37] we go to church half an hour early we go
[44:39] to church when it's open on Wednesday we
[44:41] go to church when it's on Sunday we
[44:43] don't plan to stay away from church
[44:46] we go to church
[44:49] there's so many different things that we
[44:51] do when we're Believers when we act on
[44:53] it brothers and sisters now I'm I I say
[44:56] you know there's times where we go away
[44:57] we do have a holiday I'll say that but
[45:00] we don't stay home
[45:02] from going to church when we could go to
[45:03] church that's what I mean by that very
[45:06] specifically if you want to go on travel
[45:07] that's great sometimes you'll travel and
[45:10] you'll be away you can't go to church
[45:11] but when you do travel and you go away
[45:13] sometimes you can actually come to
[45:14] another church you can find other
[45:16] believers and you know that's such a
[45:18] wonderful thing to be able to do is to
[45:19] go on fellowship and meet new Believers
[45:21] but I just want to be clear I'm not
[45:23] trying to say that you know what it's
[45:25] you got to come to church and then you
[45:27] can't travel I'm not saying that at all
[45:28] I'm saying staying at home and streaming
[45:31] and saying that I don't have to go to
[45:32] church that's not right and I'm just
[45:35] going to stop there but
[45:37] you know we had this uh we had this
[45:40] other thing and then I'm gonna really
[45:41] get into our scripture tonight I got a
[45:43] half an hour I think it's so good though
[45:44] it's so tremendous though as Believers
[45:48] we don't chase money
[45:50] we don't chase money
[45:52] Believers don't chase money we chase the
[45:55] word of God
[45:56] we chase the leadership of the Lord in
[45:59] our lives and when we do that
[46:02] Money Follows
[46:04] and and you know I love the way brother
[46:05] Ben said it on on Sunday and I'd say the
[46:08] Lord said it's you brother Ben you know
[46:10] whatever it is we do we do it as unto
[46:12] the Lord and we do it with all of our
[46:14] might and you know if we can't do it
[46:16] that good he said don't do it
[46:19] I'll leave it up to you to say who he
[46:21] was that said that
[46:24] some will say it was brother Ben was it
[46:25] just brother Ben I don't know
[46:27] we need to do all that we can do with
[46:29] all of our hearts brothers and sisters
[46:32] and and just good enough is not good at
[46:34] all
[46:35] right to say oh it's good enough I'm
[46:37] guilty
[46:38] I know how many others are I might be
[46:40] the only one but I've done it in my life
[46:41] that's good enough who cares you know
[46:43] what there's times where we need to know
[46:45] where we have to stand with that but
[46:49] just good enough it's not enough
[46:52] God is going to hold us accountable
[46:55] and I don't think I'd heard it the same
[46:56] way that uh that brother Ben brought it
[46:59] on Sunday I just can't stop sorry
[47:00] brother it was just so good you know the
[47:03] the story of the talents the parable of
[47:05] the talents you know there was there was
[47:07] five and and two I think it was and one
[47:10] and you know the first two they were
[47:12] both 100 return on the investment
[47:15] and the next one was the zero return on
[47:18] the investment and we're going to be
[47:20] guilty if we don't have a return on our
[47:23] investment and all it takes is Just
[47:25] Surrender unto the Lord that's the key
[47:27] to it brothers and sisters it's not
[47:29] saying that I need to go and create a
[47:30] whole bunch of money I need to create an
[47:32] empire of wealth to give to the Lord
[47:34] that's not it at all it's a principle
[47:35] behind it giving all that we have to the
[47:38] Lord giving him 100 return on the gifts
[47:41] that he's given us in our lives and
[47:43] that's why I think it's tremendous a
[47:44] great example of it is someone that
[47:46] wants to serve in the body of Christ
[47:49] someone that wants to do something for
[47:51] the body somebody wants to go out and
[47:53] witness for the Lord somebody that wants
[47:55] to to try and do something put their
[47:57] shoulder to the wheel
[47:58] it's a return on on the parable of the
[48:01] uh Talent
[48:03] but here we have this woman
[48:05] in the city of psychar
[48:07] she recognized
[48:10] the woman saith unto him I know that
[48:12] messiah's cometh which is called the
[48:15] Christ
[48:16] when he has come he will tell us all
[48:19] things
[48:20] she recognized
[48:22] this man before he even said it
[48:26] when he said it he just confirmed all
[48:29] that she was saying
[48:31] because in verse 19 she says
[48:34] the woman saith unto him sir I perceive
[48:37] that thou art a prophet
[48:40] I perceive that
[48:42] something in me is telling me that
[48:44] there's something different about you
[48:46] I've heard a lot of different people but
[48:47] wow there's something that you're saying
[48:50] in the way that you're saying it and she
[48:52] goes and talks about her tradition our
[48:54] fathers worshiped in this mountain we've
[48:57] been here for a long time and we've
[48:59] heard a lot of messages we've heard a
[49:00] lot of preachers but there's something
[49:02] about your ministry the words that
[49:04] you're saying are are speaking to my
[49:06] soul in such a way that I've never heard
[49:08] it before and that was the word of God
[49:10] coming across that seed Gene of God that
[49:13] he placed in there like we've talked
[49:15] about from the book of Ephesians before
[49:16] the foundation of the world the woman
[49:18] saith unto him sir I perceive thou art a
[49:23] prophet she recognized there was
[49:25] something about this man our fathers
[49:27] worshiped in this mountain and ye say
[49:30] that in Jerusalem is the place where men
[49:33] ought to worship Jesus saith unto her
[49:36] woman believe me the hour cometh when ye
[49:40] shall neither in this mountain nor yet
[49:42] Jerusalem worship the father there's
[49:45] come in a time where it's all going to
[49:47] be just scattered and you won't even
[49:49] know who it is that you worship verse 22
[49:51] ye worship ye know not what
[49:55] we know what we worship for salvation is
[49:58] of the Jews
[50:00] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[50:04] true worship worshipers shall worship
[50:06] the father in spirit and in truth
[50:10] for the father seeketh such to worship
[50:13] Him
[50:14] and we know that Jesus said you know
[50:16] what if you don't want to worship
[50:18] it's fine
[50:19] the Rocks themselves will immediately
[50:21] cry out if you don't want to worship
[50:24] and I'm going to get into it eventually
[50:27] we're going to get there but how
[50:28] important is worship brothers and
[50:30] sisters I want to say this I would say
[50:33] it's probably as important to the
[50:35] preaching of the word on this side of
[50:37] Eternity or maybe even a little more
[50:40] because if we don't have worship we are
[50:42] not pleasing the father
[50:44] if we don't have Worship in our services
[50:46] brothers and sisters we could become
[50:48] cold and starchy what does the word of
[50:51] God say that they're lukewarm formal and
[50:53] Powerless
[50:55] we've got to be willing to understand
[50:57] that where the spirit of the Lord is
[50:59] there's liberty there's Freedom we're
[51:01] we're not going to go over onto the
[51:03] other side of Eternity and preach the
[51:05] message of the hour we're going to be
[51:07] the message of the hour and the message
[51:09] of the hour is going to be behind us
[51:11] because we're going to be headed to
[51:12] Eternity but first we're going to spend
[51:14] a thousand years showing Satan that he
[51:16] has absolutely powerless he is bound
[51:18] with chains of circumstance where he
[51:21] can't even touch us for a thousand years
[51:23] we're going to go and live out that life
[51:25] that Adam and Eve were supposed to live
[51:27] that's what we're going to do for a
[51:28] thousand years and once that's over
[51:29] brothers and sisters then there's a New
[51:31] Jerusalem City coming down out of heaven
[51:33] and the top of it is going to be just
[51:34] about as high as that space station it's
[51:36] going to be so incredibly big and huge
[51:39] and there's going to be a spot for each
[51:41] one of us our own very special place in
[51:43] that New Jerusalem City and all the
[51:45] kings of the Earth are going to bring
[51:46] their Wares into it there's still going
[51:47] to be people in this world but not one
[51:49] of you not one of us are going to be
[51:52] affected by Satan and his Antics in this
[51:54] world when that time comes but you know
[51:57] this woman saith unto him I know that
[51:59] messiah's cometh and when he which is
[52:01] called the Christ and I want to say the
[52:03] anointed one because we know brother
[52:05] Bradham preached the false anointing
[52:07] ones at the end time he said there's
[52:08] many christs and they're anointed ones
[52:11] there's many anointed ones in this world
[52:13] even today brothers and sisters but what
[52:15] happened when she recognized what
[52:19] happened when she recognized something
[52:21] happened to her wasn't there she didn't
[52:23] just say wow amen
[52:26] she didn't just sit there and and was
[52:28] cool and said you know just have a nice
[52:30] day it was good to talk to you sir what
[52:32] does the word of God says says that she
[52:34] ran into the city she dropped her water
[52:36] pot she no longer cared about the cares
[52:39] of his life she wanted to let the people
[52:41] know hold on a second something serious
[52:44] is going on here and you all need to
[52:47] hear about it and you know brothers and
[52:49] sisters the same thing for us today when
[52:51] we recognize who it is that we are
[52:53] fellowshipping with in this word it's
[52:55] not brother Barry it's not the the
[52:58] former Pastor it's not a great Minister
[53:01] somewhere else it's not William Mary and
[53:03] Branham when we listen to the message of
[53:06] the hour brothers and sisters that's not
[53:07] William Miriam Brown I'm doing all those
[53:09] signs and wonders that's the Holy Ghost
[53:11] through me William Miriam Branham and
[53:13] you know what it's the same Jesus Christ
[53:15] the same yesterday today and forever
[53:17] it's got to be his life living out
[53:19] through us
[53:20] and when it happens then we'll be the
[53:22] ones running into the city when we
[53:24] recognize that brothers and sisters
[53:25] there's an action that takes place in
[53:28] our lives when we truly have that that
[53:30] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:32] we're not the same person
[53:35] brother random says it out of it is I be
[53:39] not afraid I thought it was so so
[53:41] fitting and and suiting and I'm probably
[53:43] gonna stay here for a little while just
[53:45] in terms of services coming up but it's
[53:47] just so beautiful brothers and sisters
[53:49] be of good cheer
[53:51] don't worry
[53:53] is of the devil
[53:55] worry is thoughts that come into our
[53:57] mind and we think about things and we
[54:00] think about things and we think about
[54:01] things that never happen
[54:04] sometimes they happen but most times
[54:06] they don't most times it's just a bunch
[54:09] of things that we think about and all it
[54:11] is is things that we think about and it
[54:13] can make us worried it can even make us
[54:15] literally physically sick if we're not
[54:17] careful
[54:18] don't worry brothers and sisters be of
[54:20] good cheer why should you be of good
[54:23] cheer because it is I
[54:25] when we're in the midst of the storm
[54:27] he's going to walk right towards us in
[54:29] this message
[54:30] um a fundamental Foundation of faith
[54:33] brother Bradham he talks about it how
[54:34] Jesus knew exactly where the disciples
[54:37] were he says it in this message it is I
[54:40] be not afraid he knew exactly where the
[54:42] disciples were when that storm was there
[54:43] when they were out in the boat he knew
[54:45] exactly where they were he knew what
[54:47] they were doing he knew what they were
[54:49] thinking he knew what they were saying
[54:50] and what did he do he came to them he
[54:53] didn't just leave him he didn't he this
[54:55] word says I'll never leave you or
[54:57] forsake you
[54:59] he will never leave us brothers and
[55:01] sisters
[55:03] he says now he was dealing with a
[55:05] Samaritan woman
[55:06] and the brethren in the boat said you
[55:08] know what
[55:10] we all thought that he'd been caught in
[55:12] a trap
[55:13] they're trying to trick him
[55:15] try and get Jesus the one who was the
[55:18] Christ who is the Christ in the story
[55:20] but try and trick him and get him
[55:22] together with an ill-famed woman the men
[55:24] of the city the Pharisees of the
[55:26] Sadducees they sent out the woman they
[55:28] weren't Beyond trying to trip him trick
[55:30] them trip them up or trap them right
[55:33] they brought the woman who was caught in
[55:34] the act of adultery and threw him her
[55:37] down at his feet and what did he do he
[55:39] didn't even care he wasn't fussed
[55:41] and they're like oh Master we we we
[55:43] should apply the law in this situation
[55:46] right and what did he say you know
[55:47] whoever has no sin here you can just
[55:49] cast the first stone he without no sin
[55:50] just go ahead you can be first who's
[55:52] going to go who's gonna do it who's
[55:54] gonna throw the first stone and they
[55:55] started to recognize oh man yeah ah drop
[55:59] the stone drop all the stones everyone
[56:01] quietly leave nobody wanted to throw a
[56:05] stone at that point because they all
[56:06] recognized they had a problem every one
[56:09] of us does we can't be throwing stones
[56:13] I saw a meme this week just made me
[56:16] think of it
[56:17] I think it's good to just be
[56:19] natural normal but I saw this Meme and
[56:22] it was a man washing another man's feet
[56:24] while a group of people were sitting
[56:27] there this was from someone who isn't
[56:28] really even a message believer I was
[56:30] surprised maybe I'll try and find it and
[56:32] I'll share it
[56:33] but this man was was washing it was like
[56:35] a cartoon
[56:36] washing a man's foot and it said it's
[56:40] impossible to throw stones when you're
[56:42] washing another man's feet
[56:44] I thought my goodness
[56:46] how pertinent to a Believer today
[56:49] how many times do we miss a communion
[56:51] foot washing brothers and sisters
[56:53] it's an opportunity to actually wash not
[56:56] our brother's feet but to wash the Lord
[56:57] Jesus Christ's feet it's a tremendous
[57:00] opportunity
[57:02] but looking at this uh looking at this
[57:04] story here brother Branham he says he he
[57:07] was dealing with a Samaritan woman and
[57:09] the brother in the boat said you know
[57:10] what we'd all thought that he'd been
[57:13] caught in a trap
[57:15] we wondered what he would do now
[57:18] she denied it she said I have no husband
[57:21] but listen what he said
[57:24] I can hear Andrew say but Brethren you
[57:26] remember what he said he said thou Hast
[57:28] said true you've got five husbands and
[57:31] the one you're living with you're you're
[57:33] you're now living with is not your
[57:35] husband you said well
[57:38] now we thought the Samaritan woman being
[57:40] an evil character
[57:42] five husbands it's pretty terrible
[57:46] an evil character but here we have Jesus
[57:49] sitting there just talking to her
[57:51] and we know that he went there for one
[57:53] reason
[57:54] one woman
[57:56] that's the reason he went there
[57:59] now we thought the Samaritan woman being
[58:01] an evil character
[58:03] that she'd say like the well-trained
[58:06] preachers did
[58:08] say well you must be Beelzebub
[58:12] she knows more about God than a lot of
[58:14] ministers does today
[58:17] she said sir I perceive that thou art a
[58:19] prophet now listen to our words read it
[58:22] Saint John 4 I perceive thou art a
[58:24] prophet we we Samaritans we know that
[58:28] Messiah is coming and the Messiah will
[58:30] tell us these things what's going to be
[58:32] the sign of Messiah
[58:35] that's what's going to be the sign of
[58:37] Messiah sorry but who are you
[58:39] he said I am he that speaks to you and
[58:43] she run into the City and she said come
[58:46] see a man who's told me the things I've
[58:50] done isn't this the very Messiah isn't
[58:54] that the sign the Messiah was supposed
[58:57] to show
[58:58] the Bible says the men of Samaria
[59:00] believed on him because of what the what
[59:03] a woman told them what he'd done
[59:07] was that Jesus yesterday that be Jesus
[59:09] today if he's the same Messiah much more
[59:13] we could go to we haven't time
[59:18] just talking about this story I think
[59:20] it's just amazing to look at it because
[59:23] when we recognize that God sent a
[59:25] prophet God sent a prophet for a purpose
[59:28] it wasn't so that we could say wow God
[59:30] sent a prophet and I believe that
[59:32] Prophet he's my prophet sure enough he
[59:36] is our Prophet but that Prophet was
[59:38] Eliezer and Eliezer came to introduce
[59:41] Rebecca a type of the Bride
[59:43] to her husband Isaac and again what
[59:47] happened when Ellie easer got her all
[59:50] the way there he brought her gave her
[59:51] all the gifts dealt with her family she
[59:53] had all the signs and wonders all along
[59:55] the way the camel train all the gifts
[59:56] everything happened in her life it was
[59:58] so tremendous and when she finally got
[1:00:01] there when Ellie easer finally took her
[1:00:03] to where her husband was she recognized
[1:00:06] him and as soon as she recognized him
[1:00:08] there was an action that took place in
[1:00:11] her life there was a manifestation of
[1:00:13] that word from Eliezer that's where your
[1:00:16] husband's gonna be he's going to look
[1:00:17] like this he's going to be doing that
[1:00:19] and when that time comes you don't have
[1:00:21] to wait for anybody and when she got
[1:00:23] there when she saw him she lighted off
[1:00:26] of her camel meaning she jumped off and
[1:00:29] she ran she was no longer interested in
[1:00:31] what Eliezer had to say about it because
[1:00:33] she saw him right there her husband her
[1:00:36] Isaac was right there and he was waiting
[1:00:39] for her in the evening time and you know
[1:00:41] what she went into the marriage at that
[1:00:43] point and it's the same thing for us
[1:00:45] today brothers and sisters when we
[1:00:46] recognize what it is that we've come in
[1:00:48] contact with when we recognize that
[1:00:51] brothers and sisters something happens
[1:00:52] in our lives and maybe it's not
[1:00:54] something where we can say I've become a
[1:00:56] new creature in Christ Jesus because as
[1:00:58] a child I got baptized in the name of
[1:01:01] the of of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:01:03] remission of my sins that I truly got
[1:01:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I was
[1:01:06] a kid so my whole entire life I felt the
[1:01:08] same you might feel the same but there
[1:01:10] might come a time where you actually go
[1:01:12] out and become adopted son and daughter
[1:01:14] of God where you truly become verified
[1:01:17] by the Lord Jesus Christ where the
[1:01:19] maturity level of the word in your life
[1:01:21] is there and now you start to see the
[1:01:23] manifestation of signs and wonders in
[1:01:25] your life and that is truly the life of
[1:01:28] a believer in our day William Miriam
[1:01:30] Branham wasn't the only one some people
[1:01:31] will say that all of the gifts that
[1:01:33] William Mary and Bradham had were all
[1:01:35] for him and that was it and that's where
[1:01:37] they stopped brothers and sisters I I
[1:01:38] personally don't believe that I
[1:01:40] personally believe he was the wave chief
[1:01:42] that was waived over the congregation
[1:01:44] for this age he was waived over the
[1:01:46] Bride of Jesus Christ to say this is
[1:01:48] what it's going to be when you come to
[1:01:49] full maturity you're not going to become
[1:01:52] a prophet because a prophet is a prophet
[1:01:54] from the womb that's not what I'm saying
[1:01:56] what I'm saying is that you will have
[1:01:58] the same life of Jesus Christ Living out
[1:02:01] through you you'll have discernments
[1:02:03] you'll be able to speak in tongues you
[1:02:04] might even want to run around the
[1:02:06] building and scream and shout you might
[1:02:08] want to dance in the spirit you might
[1:02:10] want to sing in the spirit you might
[1:02:12] want to actually
[1:02:13] just speak the word of God
[1:02:17] Anything is Possible
[1:02:19] if we don't limit God
[1:02:24] I think it's just an amazing thing this
[1:02:27] whole this whole story
[1:02:29] recognizing it recognizing our day and
[1:02:32] its message
[1:02:33] recognizing Who We Are The Bride of
[1:02:36] Jesus Christ not because of anything
[1:02:38] we've done because he chose us and how
[1:02:40] do we be the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:02:42] have to be a virgin right he won't
[1:02:44] accept anything else but how do we be a
[1:02:47] virgin when when we can look at our
[1:02:49] lives spiritually speaking and say that
[1:02:51] I fell down here and I did this there
[1:02:52] and this other thing and if you only
[1:02:54] knew my past oh my goodness it's so
[1:02:56] checkered how could I ever be a virgin
[1:02:58] it's got nothing to do with this flesh
[1:03:00] nothing to do with this flesh and it has
[1:03:02] absolutely everything to do with our
[1:03:04] hearts what's on the inside of the
[1:03:06] inside do we say Amen to this word when
[1:03:09] it comes across our path if we say Amen
[1:03:11] to this word when it comes across our
[1:03:12] path then we are truly a virgin to this
[1:03:14] word and that's what he's looking for as
[1:03:16] a virgin to his word not somebody that's
[1:03:17] going to take this word and try and
[1:03:19] mingle it with something else and say
[1:03:20] that I'm just going to make it work the
[1:03:22] way that I like it to work because
[1:03:23] that's what suits me and my family you
[1:03:25] can do that but I uh we can do that but
[1:03:29] you know brothers and sisters that might
[1:03:31] put us in a position where we're not
[1:03:32] sitting in that Throne where we're
[1:03:33] standing in front of it and the word of
[1:03:35] God says that it would be better for
[1:03:36] them to not have known
[1:03:38] than to actually have gone all that way
[1:03:41] we don't want to chance it that way I've
[1:03:43] heard people say that there's going to
[1:03:45] be other people in that City that that
[1:03:47] have walked away from church and I think
[1:03:49] goodness sakes is that really what we're
[1:03:51] going to do we can't just take the word
[1:03:54] of God and just put it on the shelf and
[1:03:55] say I'd rather just live my life
[1:03:57] according to what I think is going to
[1:03:58] work we need to follow the word for our
[1:04:01] day if Rebecca decided to say no I want
[1:04:03] to just drive the camel just a little
[1:04:04] bit off the path I want to take the
[1:04:06] shortcut to go and see Isaac he'd say no
[1:04:08] no no no no don't do that just just stay
[1:04:10] with us just stay with us we're going
[1:04:12] the way we'll get you there it might
[1:04:14] look longer but we're going to get you
[1:04:15] there she'd say no no no I remember I
[1:04:18] got a little road map maybe I got a
[1:04:19] little GPS maybe somebody told me that
[1:04:21] if you just go down through the valley
[1:04:22] and around the corner you'll be able to
[1:04:24] get to Isaac a little sooner brothers
[1:04:25] and sisters there's only one way one
[1:04:27] truth and one life and according to the
[1:04:29] message of the hour is that way that
[1:04:31] truth and that life we know that brother
[1:04:33] Branham was not the son of man he was a
[1:04:36] man revealing the son of man that's
[1:04:38] that's what he was doing and if he was
[1:04:40] revealing the son of man then where is
[1:04:42] the son of man today
[1:04:47] if we have the ability to recognize that
[1:04:49] there's an action that takes place Noah
[1:04:51] recognized the word of God in his day
[1:04:53] and he took action there was something
[1:04:55] that happened and the same thing happens
[1:04:57] to us in our day
[1:04:59] sometimes we get the desire to go and
[1:05:01] preach
[1:05:02] we never want to Discount that if
[1:05:04] anybody has the desire to preach
[1:05:06] that's God working in your heart because
[1:05:08] I'll promise you this Satan don't want
[1:05:10] you to preach
[1:05:12] Satan doesn't want you to preach the
[1:05:13] word of God so if we have that struggle
[1:05:16] in our lives and we're wondering oh I
[1:05:18] just got this thing where I just feel
[1:05:19] like I should preach Satan doesn't want
[1:05:21] you to preach
[1:05:24] it's God
[1:05:27] out of Investments brother batam says
[1:05:29] and this little woman had nothing
[1:05:32] she probably kept away from church
[1:05:35] she had seen so much in it
[1:05:38] because down in her heart
[1:05:40] was laid a seed eternal life
[1:05:43] brothers and sisters we know in our day
[1:05:47] we can come to church and we can see a
[1:05:49] lot
[1:05:50] and unfortunately we can get real hurt
[1:05:52] at church
[1:05:54] things can happen at church
[1:05:57] and you know Satan comes to church he
[1:05:59] likes to get in the middle of it and try
[1:06:00] to give us bars of misunderstandings
[1:06:04] but you know I would just want to say
[1:06:05] this brother Brown when he went across
[1:06:07] the curtain of time what was it that
[1:06:09] voice said to him that voice said to him
[1:06:11] keep pressing on
[1:06:12] when he came back into his body that's
[1:06:14] the thing that he kept hearing keep
[1:06:15] pressing on I just want to say it don't
[1:06:18] matter what happened in church brothers
[1:06:19] and sisters the grass ain't going to be
[1:06:21] greener anywhere else just keep pressing
[1:06:23] on just ask God to actually help the
[1:06:26] situation and he will
[1:06:28] and this little woman had nothing she
[1:06:30] probably kept away from church she had
[1:06:33] seen so much in it because down in her
[1:06:36] heart was laid a seed eternal life all
[1:06:39] that the father has given me will come
[1:06:41] to me and as soon as that light flashed
[1:06:44] upon her
[1:06:46] she didn't call it a devil
[1:06:49] look at the difference between that
[1:06:50] woman and the clergy
[1:06:53] she said sir I perceive thou art a
[1:06:56] prophet
[1:06:57] we know that when Messiah cometh that's
[1:07:00] the things he is to do we're looking for
[1:07:04] a messiah we haven't had a prophet for
[1:07:06] hundreds of years
[1:07:08] but our leader Moses told us that there
[1:07:11] would raise up a prophet in the last
[1:07:12] days and he would be Messiah which means
[1:07:16] the anointed one anointed
[1:07:21] excuse me he was the word
[1:07:24] God is the word
[1:07:27] and was in Christ
[1:07:30] and the Bible said that the word of God
[1:07:32] the word is quicker more powerful
[1:07:33] sharper than a two-edged sword Hebrews 4
[1:07:36] piercing asunder the marrow of the bone
[1:07:40] and a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:07:43] intents that's in the heart
[1:07:45] that's the reason he could look upon
[1:07:47] them and perceive what they were
[1:07:50] thinking about because he was the word
[1:07:52] he was life he is still the word and he
[1:07:56] is still life and he knew and he does
[1:08:00] the same thing
[1:08:02] I want to say this brothers and sisters
[1:08:04] he is the same thing he knows exactly
[1:08:08] what's in our hearts right now he knows
[1:08:11] exactly what's in our minds right now we
[1:08:14] cannot hide from him we can hide from my
[1:08:16] brothers and our sisters sometimes we
[1:08:17] can even hide from ourselves
[1:08:19] but we can't hide from God he knows
[1:08:22] exactly what our thoughts are and we
[1:08:25] have the ability to receive him or to
[1:08:27] reject him and I just want to encourage
[1:08:29] every one of us to receive him
[1:08:32] isn't it interesting though to look at
[1:08:33] the parallels of this she knew that
[1:08:36] there was someone coming she knew that
[1:08:38] there was a messiah coming she knew that
[1:08:40] there was a Christ coming
[1:08:42] and she wasn't interested in trying to
[1:08:44] say well I thought that it should come
[1:08:46] this way because he was able to discern
[1:08:49] her heart who had been able to discern
[1:08:52] her heart in the past nobody nobody had
[1:08:54] ever been able to discern her heart
[1:08:56] isn't that interesting to take a look at
[1:08:58] the ministry of William Miriam Branham I
[1:09:00] had the the opportunity this week to to
[1:09:03] witness to someone we have it's so
[1:09:05] strange there's no accidents in this
[1:09:07] world I love the way God does stuff we
[1:09:09] had a man drive into our driveway and
[1:09:11] ask if he could board some horses at our
[1:09:12] property and uh I guess they used to do
[1:09:15] that there for a time but we we got
[1:09:17] talking and he started to speak about uh
[1:09:19] things that that were interesting and
[1:09:22] Time stuff and we started to talk about
[1:09:23] the vaccine and and the pandemic and
[1:09:26] different things and I thought you know
[1:09:28] this is tremendous I love this
[1:09:30] conversation and he said what did you do
[1:09:31] with your congregation how did you deal
[1:09:33] with it because I told him I was a
[1:09:35] minister and I said you know what we
[1:09:36] just said what what God Said what Jesus
[1:09:39] said just Render unto Caesar what's
[1:09:40] Caesar's but give God what's God gods
[1:09:43] we didn't try to rock the boat we're not
[1:09:45] trying to prove anything we want to see
[1:09:47] people get to Christ that's what we want
[1:09:48] to see Christ in our day not Christ of
[1:09:51] of an imagination but Christ in our day
[1:09:54] is tremendous so I I told him you know I
[1:09:57] asked him the question I said if God
[1:09:58] sent a prophet to the Earth today would
[1:10:01] you want to hear what he had to say and
[1:10:03] he said oh yes I would and I said oh
[1:10:05] good great and he said well what what
[1:10:07] what what are you talking about I said
[1:10:09] well just just take a look at William
[1:10:11] Mary and Branham
[1:10:13] I said I can I can explain more about it
[1:10:15] and he typed it into his phone right
[1:10:16] away and I said okay you know what
[1:10:17] you're going to do you're going to find
[1:10:18] a whole bunch of fanaticism that's going
[1:10:20] to be the first thing that you find but
[1:10:21] what I want to say is just take what you
[1:10:23] actually see about him and compare it
[1:10:26] with the word of God because he has a
[1:10:27] knowledge of the word of God compare it
[1:10:29] with the word of God and see if it's
[1:10:30] true or not and uh we'll see and I said
[1:10:33] you know what I'd love to have a further
[1:10:34] conversation with you and he said sure
[1:10:36] enough I would and he sent me a text
[1:10:38] message after hours after and he was
[1:10:41] really warm about it he said this is
[1:10:43] tremendous I've never heard of this
[1:10:45] before I would like to talk about this
[1:10:47] so uh just remember this fella I can't
[1:10:50] remember his name offhand but
[1:10:52] um I think it's Lyle but just remember
[1:10:53] the the man with the horses and we'll
[1:10:56] just see what the Lord will do but you
[1:10:58] know there's something about the word
[1:11:00] for our day brothers and sisters and and
[1:11:02] there's people in this world that still
[1:11:03] need to hear about it and we have the
[1:11:05] opportunity to go running into the city
[1:11:07] to explain to them that God sent a
[1:11:09] prophet that this Messiah has come that
[1:11:12] he's not coming he's already come and
[1:11:15] people have a perception in their mind
[1:11:17] about what he should be like what's
[1:11:19] going to look like what's going to
[1:11:20] happen and what it is it's bars of
[1:11:22] misunderstanding it's going to keep
[1:11:24] people behind those bars but we've had a
[1:11:26] profit in our day say House of Hell give
[1:11:29] way to the name of Jesus Christ not give
[1:11:31] way to the name of the Father the Son
[1:11:33] the Holy Ghost give way to the name of
[1:11:35] Jesus Christ this woman here she
[1:11:37] recognized it even though she was a
[1:11:40] fitful sinner she was in a bad State
[1:11:42] wasn't she an ill-famed woman with five
[1:11:45] husbands an evil character is what
[1:11:47] brother Branham said but something on
[1:11:49] the inside of her was able to recognize
[1:11:51] it and when she recognized it she acted
[1:11:54] on it and when she acted on it what
[1:11:56] happened all the men of the city came
[1:11:58] out to meet Jesus
[1:12:00] how many people are in the city of
[1:12:02] Calgary brothers and sisters I think
[1:12:04] it's a tremendous thing
[1:12:07] but here we have in our day for people
[1:12:09] maybe that don't know this I know that
[1:12:11] we all know this here
[1:12:14] but what about Revelations 10.
[1:12:17] one to seven
[1:12:20] so familiar scripture to us but in the
[1:12:22] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:12:27] messenger when he should begin to sound
[1:12:32] when are those days
[1:12:34] I just want to ask the question when
[1:12:37] when is that going to happen
[1:12:39] and we know everyone here knows maybe
[1:12:42] people watching already know it's
[1:12:44] already happened
[1:12:46] but many people are still thinking this
[1:12:48] is out there in the future when it's
[1:12:50] already taken place
[1:12:52] and the days
[1:12:54] of the seventh angel messenger when he
[1:12:56] begins to sound what's going to happen
[1:12:58] the mystery of God will be finished
[1:13:01] in our day brothers and sisters it's
[1:13:04] happened I just want to encourage us
[1:13:06] tonight don't don't don't discount it if
[1:13:09] you have the ability to hear this and
[1:13:11] recognize this for your day
[1:13:13] throw down your pot run into the City
[1:13:15] and go and tell the men of the city what
[1:13:17] you know what you've heard about
[1:13:20] there's still people in the City of
[1:13:22] Calgary
[1:13:23] I thought it was amazing brother Ben
[1:13:25] asked
[1:13:26] how many people in the City of Calgary
[1:13:27] would go if there was a Rapture today
[1:13:30] who knows the answer to that we don't
[1:13:32] know that but we know this that God said
[1:13:35] through that Prophet you
[1:13:37] you be that one screaming and crying
[1:13:40] Lord be it unto me according to your
[1:13:43] word let me be that one that goes in the
[1:13:45] rapture
[1:13:47] brothers and sisters can we recognize
[1:13:49] where we are today in our lives today in
[1:13:52] our message today in the word of God
[1:13:56] we know that we have to plant our
[1:13:57] potatoes we have to hoe our potatoes is
[1:14:00] what the prophet said which means we
[1:14:02] have to do our gardening
[1:14:04] we have to go to work we have to go to
[1:14:06] school we got to pay bills we got to pay
[1:14:08] taxes we got to Render unto Caesar
[1:14:10] what's Caesar's but we need to give unto
[1:14:12] God what's God's and you know I would
[1:14:15] say this we need to give unto God what's
[1:14:17] God's and then Render unto Caesar what's
[1:14:19] Caesars and we could get into all of
[1:14:21] that with tithes and offerings you can
[1:14:23] pay your taxes first but what if you
[1:14:25] tithe first
[1:14:26] God will bless you beyond your wildest
[1:14:29] imagination
[1:14:31] there's a whole thing about that too
[1:14:32] someday we'll get into but you know
[1:14:34] brothers and sisters can we recognize it
[1:14:36] today can we recognize who has come and
[1:14:38] set down by our will and said to us you
[1:14:41] know what it doesn't matter I'm not
[1:14:42] concerned about all of that I want you
[1:14:44] to know that I know all about you I want
[1:14:48] you to know very clearly that there's
[1:14:50] nothing hidden
[1:14:51] in your life
[1:14:53] but none of it matters
[1:14:55] I want you to know that if you can
[1:14:57] receive this word for your day then none
[1:15:00] of that matters because you're not
[1:15:01] living under law you're receiving Grace
[1:15:03] the grace that's given to you in my
[1:15:05] presence and you know what that's the
[1:15:07] way the Lord is he's not looking to
[1:15:09] destroy us he's looking to save us
[1:15:12] Satan wants us to think that he's
[1:15:14] looking to destroy us brother Branham
[1:15:16] said I used to think that that God was
[1:15:18] mad at me and Jesus loved me and come to
[1:15:21] find out one day that they were the same
[1:15:23] person that they just want to love us
[1:15:26] they're just knocking at the door hoping
[1:15:28] that someone on the inside would just
[1:15:30] open the door to us just turn that latch
[1:15:33] and allow him to come in and these word
[1:15:35] of God says that if you do you open that
[1:15:37] door then I'll come in and I'll sup with
[1:15:39] you
[1:15:39] you won't eat alone
[1:15:42] you know brothers and sisters I just
[1:15:43] want to encourage us tonight if we can
[1:15:45] recognize it I'll call the musicians as
[1:15:47] I close this if we can recognize that
[1:15:49] brothers and sisters then every single
[1:15:50] promise in the book Is Ours every single
[1:15:54] promise in the word of God is yours and
[1:15:57] you have every single right to it and I
[1:15:59] want to say this when a devil comes
[1:16:01] around and tries to tell you that you
[1:16:03] don't have the right to it tell him he's
[1:16:04] a liar when the Devil comes around and
[1:16:06] tries to say that I've got right to it
[1:16:09] tell him he's a liar because when Christ
[1:16:11] went to Calvary he died he went down
[1:16:13] into hell and he took those keys of
[1:16:16] death and hell right off of Satan's belt
[1:16:19] and and we know that he knows that
[1:16:22] it was made very very clear we don't
[1:16:25] have to accept the devil in his Antics
[1:16:27] is what I want to say tonight brothers
[1:16:28] and sisters if we've accepted this word
[1:16:31] in its fullness then we have right to
[1:16:33] every single promise the full entire
[1:16:35] book is completely revealed to us maybe
[1:16:37] stand with me tonight as we close
[1:16:40] through this ministry in our day
[1:16:42] brothers and sisters all that was lost
[1:16:45] in the fall has been restored
[1:16:48] we've gone right back to that perfect
[1:16:50] state of the Garden of Eden spiritually
[1:16:54] speaking here we are in this world
[1:16:57] living in this flesh
[1:16:59] dealing with all this sin the God of
[1:17:02] this evil age Satan's Eden this terrible
[1:17:05] nature that we're born into
[1:17:10] but yet somehow God has chosen us to be
[1:17:13] here and he chose us to be here to be
[1:17:16] the ones to say I'm so glad that I can
[1:17:18] say I'm one of them I recognize what
[1:17:21] he's done for me I recognize this word
[1:17:23] for my day that the mystery is no longer
[1:17:26] a mystery it's completely revealed and I
[1:17:29] might not totally understand it
[1:17:31] but I do understand this that he has
[1:17:34] called me by my name and you know when
[1:17:36] he's called you by your name nobody can
[1:17:39] ever talk you out of it because nobody
[1:17:41] ever talked you into it
[1:17:43] let's just pray tonight
[1:17:45] gracious Heavenly Father Lord I just
[1:17:48] pray that we can all recognize who it is
[1:17:51] that we are talking to Father Lord Jesus
[1:17:55] help me to recognize it Lord

[1:18:03] and I know that I'm the same way I'll
[1:18:05] get caught up in the circumstances of
[1:18:07] this life and then eventually after much
[1:18:10] heartache something will say but have
[1:18:12] you prayed
[1:18:14] father help me to not wait for a
[1:18:16] traumatic experience to pray oh Lord but

[1:18:22] constant communion with you father

[1:18:27] experience Lord to just have a constant
[1:18:30] communion with you Lord

[1:18:48] hearts of your children Lord father help
[1:18:51] us to recognize our position because we
[1:18:54] know when that day comes when we fully
[1:18:57] recognize it Lord then the Rapture will

[1:19:03] father many lives that need to come in

[1:19:08] that woman from the well that knows that
[1:19:11] Messiah has come father help us to
[1:19:14] recognize the fullness of the coming of
[1:19:16] Messiah

[1:19:21] your hand upon each one of us Lord be
[1:19:23] with those who are traveling Lord bring
[1:19:25] them back home safely at the appointed
[1:19:27] time we just pray that you'd be
[1:19:29] glorified now in all that's said and
[1:19:32] done as we close the service father and
[1:19:34] if it Be Your Will for us to gather
[1:19:35] again on Sunday we pray that you would
[1:19:37] just anoint us father one more time Lord
