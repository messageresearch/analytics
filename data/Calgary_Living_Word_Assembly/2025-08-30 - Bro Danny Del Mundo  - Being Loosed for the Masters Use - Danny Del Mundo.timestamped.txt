[37:46] we can, Lord Jesus, have a provided
[37:49] place where we can worship you, Lord.
[37:51] And we know that you have given us a
[37:53] natural building, Lord Jesus, that we
[37:56] can worship you in spirit and in truth,
[37:58] Father, according to the word for our
[38:00] day. Lord Jesus, tonight, I pray that
[38:03] you would just be glorified in the
[38:05] remainder of this service. Lord, we're
[38:07] so honored and privileged to be able to
[38:10] worship you, Father, on this side of
[38:12] eternity.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Father, we recognize what you've done
[38:15] for us, and we thank you for it, Lord.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Tonight, Father, we just want to
[38:19] remember each and every need that was
[38:21] made known by the way, an uplift hand
[38:23] tonight, Father, that you would just
[38:25] meet the request sovereignly in each one
[38:28] of our lives, Lord.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to also remember
[38:32] the unspoken request, Lord. We know that
[38:35] you're more than able to meet every
[38:37] single need, every single desire, Lord,
[38:40] every single situation, Lord, that we'll
[38:42] encounter in our lives. Nothing is too
[38:45] complex for you. And Lord, we just
[38:47] commit all of our needs into your hands
[38:49] tonight. And Lord, we'll be careful to
[38:51] give you all the praise. Now, heavenly
[38:54] father, as we change the order of the
[38:56] service and we turn to your word, we
[38:58] pray that you would just help us to get
[39:00] out of the way, Lord.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. and allow you to speak
[39:04] through our brother Danny. We thank you
[39:06] for sending him our way as our brother
[39:08] already prayed. Lord, we know that he
[39:10] has a thought that you've placed in his
[39:12] heart. Father, help us to receive that
[39:15] word tonight, Lord.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; We just ask that you would be with all
[39:19] those who couldn't gather tonight, Lord,
[39:21] wherever they are, whatever they're
[39:22] doing. Father, bless them abundantly, we
[39:24] ask.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things now in
[39:28] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:32] Amen. I'm sure we all know brother Danny
[39:36] Delmundo from uh Manila, Philippines. We
[39:41] had a privilege of fellowshipping with
[39:44] him back in March. Brother Mvin and I
[39:46] went there and uh attended the Asian
[39:49] ministers conference and it was a
[39:51] wonderful time of fellowship and just so
[39:54] thankful to have brother Danny as a
[39:56] friend and uh a brother in Christ. So,
[40:00] we know how it goes. If we go to pull
[40:02] and he'll go to preaching and the Lord
[40:05] will speak to us.
[40:07] And we know we don't just have to have a
[40:08] need that we make known by the way of an
[40:10] uplift hand. We can have a need in our
[40:12] heart and God can minister to it
[40:14] sovereignly through the preaching of the
[40:16] word.
[40:18] Maybe we could just sing that song into
[40:20] the chamber.
[40:22] Be free, Holy Spirit. Just the chorus
[40:24] tonight.
[40:28] into
[40:29] the chamber.
[40:32] Be free. Holy
[40:36] Spirit,
[40:38] speak to
[40:41] me gently.
[40:44] [Music]
[40:56] I
[41:01] worship my
[41:03] [Music]
[41:14] Amen. Hallelujah.
[41:18] Not many
[41:20] have entered into that inner chamber.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But once we get there,
[41:28] there's no turning back.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's so addictive to be there and
[41:34] to dwell and to to stay.
[41:38] There's no light like that.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh so we certainly appreciate
[41:44] the presence of the Lord this evening.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And once again appreciate uh uh
[41:51] brother Perry for having me once again.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; And of course the Pineda family was was
[41:58] a family. Amen. So and uh the brethren
[42:02] from Edmonton who made their way to be
[42:03] here certainly appreciate each and every
[42:06] one of you and of course each and every
[42:08] one of us that have come here. Amen. Uh
[42:11] we have come here for the Lord.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. and for his word. And uh I believe
[42:17] he's our preacher this evening. Brother
[42:20] Danny has nothing to preach except the
[42:22] Lord. Amen. Uh would open our mouth and
[42:26] uh so we can do our everything. We we
[42:29] can we can prepare. Amen. But unless the
[42:32] Lord bless it. Amen. Uh there's nothing
[42:35] to it. But we have come here under
[42:37] expectation. So we believe that the Lord
[42:39] will uh uh will will say something to
[42:41] us. So without further ado, we would
[42:44] like to go straight to the reading of
[42:46] the word. Amen. Uh let's read in the
[42:50] book of Matthew.
[42:54] Uh just want to leave you a simple
[42:56] thought this evening. Amen. So God bless
[43:00] you our precious musicians. Amen. In
[43:03] chapter 21 verse one we will read
[43:08] uh down to 11.
[43:11] It says here, "And when they drew nigh
[43:14] unto Jerusalem,
[43:16] and were come to Beth Fagi unto the
[43:18] Mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two
[43:22] disciples,
[43:24] saying unto them, Go into the village
[43:27] over against you, and straightway you
[43:31] shall find an ass
[43:34] tithe,
[43:36] and cult with her.
[43:39] loose them and bring them unto me.
[43:43] And if any man say ought unto you,
[43:47] ye shall say, The Lord hath need of
[43:50] them, and straightway he will send them.
[43:56] All this was done that it might be
[43:58] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[44:00] prophet, saying, Tell ye, the daughter
[44:02] of Zion, behold, thy king cometh unto
[44:05] thee, meek and sitting upon an ass, and
[44:08] he called the fo of an ass. And the
[44:11] disciples went and did as Jesus
[44:13] commanded them, and brought the ass and
[44:16] the colt, and put on them their clothes,
[44:19] and they set him there on. And a very
[44:22] great multitude spread their garments in
[44:24] the way. Others cut down branches from
[44:28] the trees and stroed them in the way.
[44:31] And the multitudes that went before and
[44:35] that followed cried, saying, "Hosana to
[44:38] the son of David. Blessed is he that
[44:40] cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosana
[44:42] in the highest." And when he was come
[44:45] into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
[44:48] saying, Who is this? And the multi
[44:51] multitude said, "This is Jesus."
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
[44:58] Amen. Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[44:59] Dear heavenly father, we thank you this
[45:01] evening. We invite your presence to uh
[45:05] uh to dwell once again. And uh Lord uh
[45:09] uh as we feel you, we as we worship you,
[45:13] we we believe and we're so confident
[45:15] Lord
[45:16] &gt;&gt; that you are pleased with the people
[45:18] that have come here under expectation,
[45:20] oh God. And uh uh may you have liberty
[45:24] this evening to speak before your
[45:26] people. Amen. Take me out of the way and
[45:29] have your own way, Lord, this evening.
[45:32] Amen. And as we commit every portion of
[45:34] the service in Jesus Christ's wonderful
[45:36] name and everybody say amen this
[45:39] evening. God bless you. Amen. You may be
[45:41] seated.
[45:43] Amen. So uh it's a wonderful opportunity
[45:48] to be back here once again. Uh
[45:52] uh so
[45:55] of course this is the the first church
[45:58] where I visited uh the first time I
[46:01] landed in Canada. So this this is always
[46:04] the the route. Amen. That I have to uh
[46:10] to pass through. But anyway, as the Lord
[46:12] leads, Amen. Uh so we appreciate sending
[46:17] your pastor and brother Merlin last
[46:20] March and they've been a blessing to the
[46:22] uh Asian conference and of course to our
[46:26] uh anniversary meeting uh but very uh
[46:31] been a blessing to to many. Amen. Not
[46:34] only our congregation, not only our
[46:36] family. Amen. But uh wherever uh uh we
[46:40] went and they went uh uh the Lord has
[46:44] used him and used them so mightily for
[46:47] the glory of the Lord. Amen. And we
[46:51] always desire uh to have them both go
[46:55] back, amen, to the Philippines. And uh
[46:58] uh so we just want to be a blessing
[47:00] everywhere we go. And that is also my
[47:01] desire this evening. Amen. And uh before
[47:05] I go on, I just want to uh to give you
[47:09] amen uh a little oh not not a little but
[47:13] a great testimony. Amen. Because last
[47:16] March, Amen. Just I remember uh in the
[47:20] morning when uh brother Barry was uh
[47:25] about to minister he was looking for my
[47:28] son Genesis and uh along with brother
[47:32] Mahim they were and uh so but Genesis is
[47:35] in charge of our technical team and he's
[47:37] so busy and uh he was not there but in
[47:40] the evening uh when I requested uh uh
[47:44] brother Barry to pray for my family Uh
[47:48] amen. Uh so the prayer because my my son
[47:54] Genesis
[47:55] uh yeah he's he's been he's been he'd
[47:59] been diagnosed with uh uh congenital
[48:03] heart disease when he was young 3 months
[48:05] old and uh uh 3 years old uh he had this
[48:10] surgery and then uh a long story but we
[48:15] have to make it short. uh after the
[48:17] first surgery he had to undergo another
[48:19] surgery for the following year just to
[48:21] prepare him for a open heart surgery and
[48:23] to have the total correction of his
[48:26] heart but because life was hard so forth
[48:29] and so on and we were not able to do it
[48:31] a year after the second year and we were
[48:34] able to do it the third year so he he
[48:36] was already 6 years old then so the
[48:39] doctors Amen were surprised how come
[48:43] because the they they put him, you know,
[48:47] uh uh what you call this a synthetic
[48:50] artificial vein just to help him uh have
[48:54] some, you know, uh oxygen for his body.
[48:57] But it was he was growing and it will
[49:01] not grow. So at the at the end at the
[49:03] end of the year, the the oxygen could no
[49:07] longer be enough because that vein is
[49:10] not growing. So that's why you know the
[49:12] doctors the surgeons they're saying do
[49:14] you love your do you love your son you
[49:16] know everything we love him but what
[49:18] shall we do so second year and then
[49:22] third year that was the time when
[49:23] Genesis had his uh open heart surgery
[49:26] but they were all wondering how he was
[49:29] able to make it for three years and upon
[49:32] checking amen so that's why we call
[49:34] Genesis a mira miracle boy because when
[49:37] they look uh they found out that uh that
[49:43] an extra vein grew
[49:46] [Laughter]
[49:48] &gt;&gt; and that sustained him
[49:50] &gt;&gt; for extra two years.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then all along and then uh
[49:57] okay fast pass fast pass fast pass fast
[49:58] pass fast pass fast pass fast pass fast
[49:58] pass fast pass fast pass fast forward
[49:58] they get married a very faithful uh uh
[50:02] wife sister Micah very very very
[50:04] faithful and uh of course Lisa sister
[50:07] Lisa uh uh met them and uh uh uh she's
[50:13] very uh lovely sister and so
[50:18] uh they've been praying they've been
[50:20] married for
[50:22] six years and about seven years. And so
[50:27] last March only
[50:29] uh when we were uh being prayed for by
[50:33] your pastor, brother
[50:36] uh brother Barry, of course, others were
[50:37] also praying. Amen. And God is so
[50:41] faithful.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Just last week, just last week, I was in
[50:46] North Carolina and my son called me,
[50:48] "Papa, can you check?" because I asked
[50:51] him to uh bring my car in the in the
[50:54] shop because after the mission trip in
[50:56] the mountain, we passed through rivers
[50:58] and so forth and so on, you know, I had
[51:01] uh my my my car had some problem. So he
[51:05] he brought it to the to the shop and
[51:08] while I was in North Carolina, uh it was
[51:10] middle of the evening. It was middle of
[51:13] the day over there and papa, would you
[51:16] look at it? So, we had a video call and
[51:19] then I look at it. I thought it was it
[51:21] it was a receipt or an estimate costing
[51:24] of how much I'm going to pay for the
[51:26] car. And I read there five weeks. I
[51:30] said, "Why too long? It's too long. Why
[51:32] five weeks?" I said, "Look at it
[51:35] closely, Papa." And when I look, Amen.
[51:38] Ma is five weeks pregnant.
[51:41] [Laughter]
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, but but they need to be
[51:47] back because it, uh, it, you know, they
[51:49] just got so excited and they had to be
[51:52] back. Uh, but everything is, uh, is
[51:55] good. And so that's why they were
[51:57] supposed to go to Hong Kong because I
[51:59] was supposed to speak in a uh,
[52:01] anniversary meeting also in Hong Kong,
[52:04] but my my schedule conf uh uh had a a
[52:09] conflict and I cannot make it on the
[52:11] 7th. So my my kids will be coming.
[52:13] faith, my youngest, and and uh another
[52:16] sister, sister Charmaine and uh Micah
[52:20] and Genesis. So when I knew that, I
[52:22] said, "Forget it."
[52:26] Amen. Because uh you know, you have to
[52:28] take care of that. And so uh they have
[52:32] to postpone their uh going to Hong Kong
[52:35] because of that. So God is so good.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he remains the same yesterday,
[52:41] today, and forever.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then after 7 years.
[52:45] Hallelujah. So with that I am so
[52:49] encouraged and uh I said if this is the
[52:53] only thing that I will say to brother
[52:54] Barry,
[52:56] Amen. I will be happy. Amen. Because
[52:58] it's a it's really a big testimony
[53:01] uh not only to my family, my whole
[53:03] congregation. They're really praying for
[53:05] this couple. Amen. And uh uh now it's
[53:09] here. Amen. So now going back to the
[53:14] scripture, amen, that we have just read.
[53:17] Amen. Uh
[53:19] would like to title this uh let me use
[53:25] that verse in verse two. Go into the
[53:29] village over against you and straightway
[53:33] ye shall find an ass tied an occult with
[53:38] her. loose them and bring them unto me.
[53:43] If any man say ought unto you, ye shall
[53:46] say the Lord had need of them and
[53:50] straightway he will send them. Amen. So
[53:54] I would like to get a title from that uh
[53:57] point being loosed
[54:00] for the master's use.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Being used or being loose for the
[54:06] master's use. So if we're going to look
[54:08] at it, you know, this is an actual
[54:10] story, but everything in the scripture,
[54:13] Amen. Uh uh they have uh prophetic
[54:18] implications.
[54:19] Uh especially
[54:22] uh brother Bham said, you know, when you
[54:24] when you read the scripture, you need to
[54:26] see yourself. You need to find yourself
[54:28] if you can't find it because we are we
[54:31] are actually
[54:33] uh a fulfillment of a prophecy.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because uh when when when he was
[54:40] entering into the uh into the city, he
[54:45] said in in verse 8, a very great
[54:47] multitude spread their garments in the
[54:48] way. Others cut down branches from the
[54:50] trees and stroed them in the way. Amen.
[54:53] So they have they have done something in
[54:56] recognition of what they have witnessed.
[55:00] Amen. So uh uh first and foremost we
[55:06] have to see referring to Zechariah 9:9
[55:10] because in verse four
[55:13] uh he said all this was done that it
[55:18] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[55:21] the prophet.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:25] saying, tell ye the daughter of Zion,
[55:28] behold thy king, cometh unto thee meek
[55:32] and sitting upon an ass. And he called
[55:34] the pole of an ass. Amen. So he came to
[55:38] the city and remember he said thy king.
[55:41] So he's very specific. He's not king for
[55:44] everybody.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's only a king. Thy king. It's
[55:47] very personal. Thy king.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight, if he is thy king
[55:52] tonight, our king tonight. Amen. He's
[55:55] our lord of lords. He's king of kings.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has come to us.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's very specific and God is
[56:03] very accurate as the word of God is so
[56:06] accurate. Amen. So he come in a very
[56:09] specific time and he comes to a very
[56:12] specific group of people.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So those who recognize
[56:20] immediately they refer to the scripture.
[56:23] Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why in verse 5, so when
[56:27] they see that he entered into the city
[56:29] and then they they uh uh uh and you look
[56:32] at the the illustration, the the the
[56:34] situation. Amen. He was riding on an
[56:36] ass. Suddenly the people who are word
[56:40] based in their faith. Amen. They they
[56:44] suddenly turned to their scripture.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So they look and say uh uh it says
[56:51] uh they said in verse tell ye the
[56:53] daughter of Zion behold thy king cometh
[56:56] unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass
[56:58] and called the polanas referring to
[57:00] Zechariah chapter 9 verse 9. Amen.
[57:04] Right.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; So it says in Zechariah 9:9, "Rejoice
[57:09] greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout, O
[57:12] daughter of Jerusalem. Behold thy king."
[57:15] Amen. Cometh unto thee. He is just and
[57:18] having salvation, lowly and riding upon
[57:21] an ass, and a cult the f of an ass.
[57:25] Amen. So it is a complete replica.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the vision must be
[57:32] complete. Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know Jesus could have
[57:37] entered the city and he could have
[57:39] bypassed that
[57:42] because he knew the place where it is
[57:46] and everybody amen knew where you know
[57:49] the disciples knew where they were
[57:51] coming. Amen. Uh uh so but Jesus uh he
[57:57] said you know just like Paul said I am
[58:00] always obedient to the heavenly vision.
[58:04] So even him he himself he did not in any
[58:07] way divide from any word that had been
[58:11] spoken of him. So every dot every period
[58:15] everything that was prophesied on him
[58:18] amen he only fulfilled.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the the so the previous
[58:23] prophecy in Zechariah chapter 9 is no
[58:26] longer a prophecy now but it is a
[58:29] fulfillment. Amen. It's already a
[58:31] fulfillment and is part becoming a
[58:33] history.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now they they said now
[58:38] this he said uh in in in the message uh
[58:42] what is the attraction on the mountain?
[58:44] He said God then what was he doing?
[58:48] referring to the same scripture. What is
[58:50] that attraction up there on the hill?
[58:52] It's God making history.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And God fulfilling prophecy. And that
[58:58] always causes an attraction.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; It brings all the critics up. So when
[59:05] the pro prophecy is being fulfilled,
[59:08] Amen. the the the predestinated seed,
[59:11] the first thing that they have to do is
[59:13] to look on the scripture and find out
[59:16] this must be that.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; But the unpredestion
[59:27] but just to watch what's going on. Amen.
[59:30] And and they could also be it brings all
[59:33] critics up. The vultures. Amen. and the
[59:37] eagles also.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; And we we we know where we are.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So they come together to find out
[59:45] what's going on.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So coming for curiosity.
[59:51] Some coming to find fault, others coming
[59:54] to criticize. There's all kinds
[59:57] gathered. As we said this morning,
[59:58] believers make believers and
[1:00:00] unbelievers. What's on the mountain?
[1:00:02] Prophecy is being fulfilled. Now we'll
[1:00:04] see what takes place. So when a prophecy
[1:00:09] is being fulfilled,
[1:00:11] Amen. it creates an attraction.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh uh but of course although
[1:00:21] this message is prophetic,
[1:00:23] we don't force the prophecy to be
[1:00:25] fulfilled.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just walking into the
[1:00:29] fulfillment of the prophecy.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we uh uh because uh let me read
[1:00:36] another scripture in Habacook chapter
[1:00:38] 2:3. I believe we read this before. For
[1:00:40] the vision is shut for an appointed
[1:00:42] time, but at the end it shall speak and
[1:00:44] not lie. Though it t for it because it
[1:00:47] will surely come, it will not tar. Amen.
[1:00:51] So we are a product of a prophecy.
[1:00:55] And the the uh uh the disciple said
[1:01:00] there is a bride. Amen. That is going to
[1:01:04] perfect.
[1:01:06] It's a prophecy.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And because we believe,
[1:01:12] amen, that we are part of this prophecy.
[1:01:16] Amen. So then we are fulfilling
[1:01:20] something.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We're fulfilling
[1:01:23] something here in the day and age that
[1:01:26] we are living in that if there is a
[1:01:28] bride perfect before him,
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; I am part of it.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is the age where we stop
[1:01:37] justifying our weaknesses. Amen. This is
[1:01:40] the the age that you know that that that
[1:01:43] perfection is is still uh h a future
[1:01:47] event.
[1:01:49] Brother Bayham said there is only one
[1:01:52] prophecy.
[1:01:54] There is only one thing, amen, that we
[1:01:56] are waiting for and that is the body
[1:01:58] change.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The coming of the Lord where we're
[1:02:01] going to meet him. So it must be there
[1:02:03] must be a situation of the bride in this
[1:02:06] day and age. Amen. That we should not be
[1:02:08] looking on all our weaknesses. We should
[1:02:11] not be looking on things of the past.
[1:02:14] Amen. But we should be claiming.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. that we are part of the bride and
[1:02:20] at this day and age, amen, that that the
[1:02:23] time and and and eternity is blending
[1:02:25] together. I must take my position. I
[1:02:29] must be a walking fulfilled prophecy in
[1:02:31] this day. Amen. Hallelujah. Not to claim
[1:02:34] anything that we are not. Amen. But we
[1:02:37] are claiming what Jesus has already
[1:02:40] fulfilled.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now you see there when he come
[1:02:46] in verse 8 let me read in Matthew 21:8
[1:02:49] and a very great multitude spread their
[1:02:51] garments in the way others cut down
[1:02:52] branches from the trees and stroed them
[1:02:55] in the way and the multitudes that went
[1:02:57] before and that followed Christ saying
[1:02:59] hosana to the son of David blessed is he
[1:03:02] that cometh in the name of the Lord
[1:03:04] hosana in the highest. So it created an
[1:03:07] attraction and then look at this. So all
[1:03:10] those people that have been caught with
[1:03:14] that fulfillment of prophecy. So this is
[1:03:17] a mixed multitude.
[1:03:20] All right. So those who knew
[1:03:23] it was a fulfillment of a prophecy and
[1:03:27] they were part
[1:03:29] Amen. of somebody who will respond
[1:03:32] positively. Look what they did. A great
[1:03:35] multitude spread their garments in the
[1:03:37] way.
[1:03:39] They knew this is not a simple event.
[1:03:44] This is something special.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; We're witnessing something. Amen. And so
[1:03:49] now, so they said uh uh they spread
[1:03:52] their garments.
[1:03:54] Others cut down branches from the trees
[1:03:57] and stroed them in the way.
[1:04:00] So when you realize
[1:04:03] that the word is being fulfilled,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; you know you have something to do.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; You know you have to react on it.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; You're not just watching.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; You must be a part of it.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; You must be involved. If there is a
[1:04:21] burden, we must carry the burden
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; with it because now this is we're
[1:04:26] waiting for this. Amen. So, and now they
[1:04:30] they have nothing to do. They didn't
[1:04:32] have to go home.
[1:04:35] But what they had they all the you know
[1:04:37] they they they throw their garments
[1:04:39] because they saw this is thy king.
[1:04:43] Amen. Sitting upon an ass. Amen. And so
[1:04:47] because they realized that that was
[1:04:50] their king
[1:04:52] sitting upon an ass in due respect.
[1:04:55] Amen. So they
[1:04:58] threw their garments in that way. The
[1:05:00] the the ass where the the the king was
[1:05:04] riding on top of her. Amen. Could not
[1:05:07] step on the ground on the dirt. Amen.
[1:05:11] Hallelujah. Now remember, Amen. that
[1:05:16] ass was a beast
[1:05:21] and beast means power,
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:26] So if beast means power,
[1:05:30] so Jesus the king was riding
[1:05:33] in that tower.
[1:05:36] So remember Rebecca, he fed that camel,
[1:05:40] that beast,
[1:05:42] and that beast brought her to Isaac.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the parable of the good
[1:05:50] Samaritan,
[1:05:52] Amen.
[1:05:53] the good Samaritan. Amen. He rode in a
[1:05:57] beast.
[1:05:59] Amen. So he uh uh uh he he he he he
[1:06:04] rode on that beast. And that's why we
[1:06:06] see that Samaritan, Amen. is is is not
[1:06:09] in an ordinary person, but it's the Lord
[1:06:11] Jesus Christ himself. It's not somebody
[1:06:13] who is good because that Samaritan came
[1:06:16] where that backsliden person was.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he came down and so that's the
[1:06:24] same thing. So that's why uh uh you know
[1:06:27] uh uh this is the the power that the
[1:06:30] Lord Jesus Christ is riding on.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; All right. So today where he is riding
[1:06:36] on that eagle beast flying eagle beast.
[1:06:39] So but but 2,000 years ago let's focus
[1:06:42] on this on this event. Amen. He was
[1:06:44] riding in that beast of power
[1:06:48] the uh uh the ass. And then when he
[1:06:50] entered and so know uh uh that's why uh
[1:06:55] brother Banham said you know
[1:06:59] uh brother Banham he asked they asked
[1:07:02] will the bride
[1:07:05] have a ministry before the rapture.
[1:07:09] Amen. And uh brother Banham's answer was
[1:07:14] very clear and he said sure.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what's going on right now.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ certainly it is the
[1:07:24] message of the hour. The bride of
[1:07:26] Christ. She's consist of apostles,
[1:07:27] prophets, teachers, evangelists, and
[1:07:29] pastors. Is that right? That's the bride
[1:07:32] of Christ. She's got a ministry, great
[1:07:34] ministry. It's the ministry of the hour.
[1:07:38] It will be so humble.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; So that's the ministry of the bride. So
[1:07:48] if we're going to look at it, I'm just
[1:07:50] making an illust illustration as they
[1:07:52] will they throw the garments and then
[1:07:54] others they have no you know something
[1:07:57] to throw and they they did not go home.
[1:07:59] Whatever is available within their
[1:08:02] reach. Amen. They pick branches and
[1:08:04] throw it so that they have they can they
[1:08:07] they will be able to do something.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they recognize who was
[1:08:12] riding on that beast.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know if you look if you
[1:08:18] could imagine perhaps that beast that
[1:08:21] Jesus was riding on as he stepped on
[1:08:24] that uh garments and branches of trees
[1:08:26] leaves and everything maybe he is
[1:08:29] appreciating the people
[1:08:32] maybe he's saying in his heart thank you
[1:08:34] thank you he's so proud because he was
[1:08:36] the one stepping into those garments and
[1:08:39] branches of trees. Amen. But you know
[1:08:43] that's the same thing with the ministry
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes
[1:08:48] uh uh you know uh uh people forget
[1:08:54] Amen. that the real ministry Amen. There
[1:08:58] is humility.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it it takes humility to be an
[1:09:04] effective minister of the gospel. And uh
[1:09:08] we're so glad we have a a a a minister
[1:09:12] here that can really be bird the burden.
[1:09:14] Amen. And with such a humility uh we
[1:09:17] really appreciate ministries like that.
[1:09:19] So you see it it's the same thing. No
[1:09:21] where people are only used by the Lord
[1:09:24] and we should be proud of that.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember King David when uh when
[1:09:29] he sent or he did not send uh those
[1:09:32] three warriors.
[1:09:34] They just heard what David said. Oh, how
[1:09:38] I wish I could drink of that water out
[1:09:40] of Bethlehem.
[1:09:43] Amen.
[1:09:45] But he knew the situation. He could not
[1:09:48] go there because it was uh surrounded by
[1:09:52] by the Philistines. But you see what
[1:09:55] happened to uh those warriors. Amen.
[1:09:58] They were able they fought. They they
[1:10:00] traveled long. They traveled back and
[1:10:02] then just to give something for the
[1:10:05] king. Amen. Because they recognized
[1:10:08] their king. Amen. They did service. But
[1:10:12] look at David's humility.
[1:10:16] He was so humbled by the service that
[1:10:20] his warriors did. And he recognized that
[1:10:24] what they did, Amen, he did not deserve
[1:10:28] such kind of service. And so he took it.
[1:10:32] He recognized what they did, but he
[1:10:34] poured it. Amen. So Lord, this is not
[1:10:38] for me. This kind of service is not for
[1:10:41] me. This is for you.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; They have jeopardized their lives, Lord.
[1:10:46] Amen. So I believe with that kind of
[1:10:49] condition when the Lord comes, Amen. He
[1:10:52] will be looking for a ministry. This a
[1:10:55] prophecy. The bride will have a
[1:10:58] ministry.
[1:11:00] But it's a ministry that is so humble.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now looking back,
[1:11:07] he said now uh uh so we're saying those
[1:11:10] people they did not have to go home but
[1:11:13] they have to do what they can do right
[1:11:15] at that very moment. And this is what
[1:11:18] we're saying. Amen. When we have the
[1:11:20] opportunity to do something for God,
[1:11:23] when we have the opportunity to do
[1:11:25] something for God's people, amen, we
[1:11:27] don't miss that opportunity. Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] They didn't have to go home and take
[1:11:32] chance. Amen. And and and and take the
[1:11:34] best what is available in their home.
[1:11:36] No, because that time, that opportunity
[1:11:40] will may not come again.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If they run uh to go home
[1:11:44] and get something, maybe precious, maybe
[1:11:46] something expensive. Amen. when they get
[1:11:49] there, Jesus has passed on already.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's the same thing. Amen. We
[1:11:54] cannot say, "Oh, I'm too old for that."
[1:11:56] We cannot say, "I'm too young for that."
[1:11:58] Amen. When the opportunity comes, Amen.
[1:12:01] When we hear the word of God, Amen. We
[1:12:04] should respond right away because we
[1:12:06] might miss the opportunity.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now he said uh and
[1:12:11] they said and when he was come in
[1:12:13] Jerusalem all the city was moved saying
[1:12:17] who is this? People were moved.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the word is fulfilled people
[1:12:24] are being moved.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we will move depending on the
[1:12:30] seed that we have.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In order when we when we are
[1:12:36] being moved Amen. by something that is
[1:12:39] so positive. Amen. When that deep call,
[1:12:42] Amen. Hallelujah. As being called, Amen.
[1:12:46] And that deep that seed deep inside will
[1:12:49] always respond to the word.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so he said, who is
[1:12:54] this? Amen. And when he was coming to
[1:12:57] Jerusalem, all the city, all the city
[1:13:00] was moved. But not all the people in the
[1:13:03] city were predestinated.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Not everybody here in
[1:13:08] Calgary are predestinated seeds of the
[1:13:11] Lord. Amen. And you should be glad you
[1:13:13] have responded to the call.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are being moved.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're being touched. Amen.
[1:13:20] Amen. Not not we're not the only people
[1:13:22] who have heard this message especially
[1:13:24] today. Amen. It's all over in social
[1:13:26] media, in YouTube, in in in in Facebook.
[1:13:29] You can hear this message. Amen. But how
[1:13:32] come you respond positively? Because
[1:13:34] there is something in you. Amen. That
[1:13:37] have responded to that deep call.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all the city was moved.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; And Bar said others criticize. Others
[1:13:44] are just curious why they are there.
[1:13:46] Amen. Others try to find fault. Amen.
[1:13:49] But there are people, amen, who did
[1:13:52] something in recognition of what is
[1:13:55] going on.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so when there's
[1:13:58] opportunity, we have to do what's uh uh
[1:14:00] what what is best. Now he said in what
[1:14:02] is the attraction of the mountain?
[1:14:03] Paragraph 47. Now in the book of
[1:14:05] Zechariah chapter 9 he said rejoice
[1:14:08] greatly. Of course he mentioned the many
[1:14:10] scripture. Now what was the matter with
[1:14:12] those scribes? What was the matter with
[1:14:14] those priests? What was the matter with
[1:14:17] those religious people?
[1:14:19] This was written for 187 years before it
[1:14:22] happened by a vindicated prophet and was
[1:14:25] already put into writings and called the
[1:14:28] Bible the scrolls of the Old Testament.
[1:14:30] Why couldn't say they see that this this
[1:14:33] prophecy being fulfilled? The same
[1:14:35] reason they can see it today.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; So history is just repeating itself.
[1:14:42] They have taken the word of God and made
[1:14:45] it of none effect to the people. Amen.
[1:14:49] By teaching for traditions for doctrine
[1:14:51] the traditions of men. Amen. So when we
[1:14:54] hear the message of the hour because
[1:14:57] because the word of God has a quickening
[1:14:59] power.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; It quickens the seed.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So regardless of seed.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Because when the sun shines,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; it shine to both seed.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; When the rain comes,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; yes.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the word of God has
[1:15:23] a quickening power.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know but there is no
[1:15:29] change of specy.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; The wheat will remain wheat.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Even if it is being tied. Amen. Being
[1:15:39] being irritated by the uh uh uh uh uh
[1:15:43] but that that other plants you know that
[1:15:46] tears. Hallelujah. It will remain wheat.
[1:15:50] But both of them will come to life.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I in the parable wait
[1:15:56] until the end. Are we in the end,
[1:15:58] brothers and sisters? Hallelujah. So
[1:16:00] that's why because we're in this part of
[1:16:02] the age and we're living in the end time
[1:16:05] in the last part of the end time.
[1:16:07] Everything is in its full maturity.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; So the bride is matured.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; It's maturing. It's in the process
[1:16:18] probably. But we are in that stage.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why the quickening
[1:16:23] power of God, Amen, quickens not only
[1:16:26] the predestinated seed. In that way they
[1:16:29] will respond according to the seed.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And so that's why now they had taken the
[1:16:38] word of God and made it of none effect
[1:16:40] the people by teaching for traditions
[1:16:42] for uh the traditions of men. And if
[1:16:45] scribe, preachers, ministers, spiritual
[1:16:47] man, so-called anointed ones would only
[1:16:50] read the Bible, they wouldn't be
[1:16:51] wondering what's taking place. They
[1:16:53] would know what it is. God fulfilling
[1:16:57] his word.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Why do the denominations
[1:17:00] could not recognize Malachi 4? Amen.
[1:17:03] Revelation 10. Amen. It's being
[1:17:05] fulfilled.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But they are being quickened
[1:17:10] also by the message of the hour.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. so that this message will be
[1:17:15] rejected.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; They were moved. Amen. And and look when
[1:17:20] when they were moved, even when Jesus
[1:17:22] was arrested, when he was just right
[1:17:24] there. Amen. He they they maltreated
[1:17:26] him, blindfolded him, insulted him. And
[1:17:30] look, they also speak. Amen. And they
[1:17:34] and they and they uh they called the
[1:17:37] Lord king.
[1:17:39] Look at him king of the Jews.
[1:17:43] And they bowed their heads.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; They put him a crown of thorns.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; They say the same words. King of kings.
[1:17:54] Hallelujah. But there is something in
[1:17:57] them. Hallelujah. That is not genuine.
[1:18:00] But but those who are predestinated,
[1:18:02] they know. Amen. So when they were
[1:18:04] moved, Amen. How? Look at how they
[1:18:06] moved. Amen. They they blindfolded him,
[1:18:09] insulted him. Amen.
[1:18:12] mocked him, pulled his beard,
[1:18:16] and while he was blindfold said, "Tell
[1:18:18] us who we are, and we will believe you."
[1:18:22] Amen. They he they he knew he knew them,
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; but they did not get what they were
[1:18:29] asking for
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; because they had the wrong approach
[1:18:33] because they were moving differently
[1:18:36] because they had different uh spirits in
[1:18:38] them. And here those people that read
[1:18:40] the scripture day by day watch him come
[1:18:42] riding and and cry who is this God
[1:18:44] fulfilling his word to the people that
[1:18:46] should have known what it was but they
[1:18:48] didn't know it. When God fulfills his
[1:18:50] word it always causes an attraction
[1:18:53] always does causes an attraction for it
[1:18:55] is the unusual. So unusual when he
[1:18:59] fulfills his word to the modern trend of
[1:19:01] the day because the modern trend of the
[1:19:03] day don't believe in it they have their
[1:19:06] own way.
[1:19:08] Hallelujah.
[1:19:10] So now
[1:19:12] uh the Bible said in 2 Peter chapter 1
[1:19:15] verse 21, for the prophecy came not in
[1:19:18] all time by the will of men, but holy
[1:19:21] men of God spake as they were moved by
[1:19:25] the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] Hallelujah.
[1:19:31] So now when he came, look, when he came
[1:19:34] in in in in uh in the in in in the next
[1:19:38] uh let's go back in verse six, he said,
[1:19:41] "Now the disciples went and did as Jesus
[1:19:44] commanded them." Of course, this is what
[1:19:45] the the pure called disciples. The
[1:19:49] disciples went as and did as Jesus
[1:19:52] commanded them and brought the ass and
[1:19:55] the cult. And this is I like this
[1:19:58] portion. Brought the ass and the colt
[1:20:01] and put on them
[1:20:04] their clothes
[1:20:06] and they set him there on. Now remember
[1:20:09] I'm showing you things here.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; That Jesus
[1:20:14] rode only in one beast.
[1:20:19] But the instruction was loose them.
[1:20:24] Amen. The other was old, the other one
[1:20:28] was young.
[1:20:30] Amen. I hope you can see two generations
[1:20:32] here.
[1:20:34] Amen. So now brought the ass and the
[1:20:36] cult and put them their clothes and they
[1:20:40] set him there on.
[1:20:43] So let's go back to
[1:20:46] the question. He said, would the bride
[1:20:50] of Christ
[1:20:52] have a ministry before the rapture?
[1:20:55] So it will be so humble. And in
[1:20:56] paragraph 76 now God fortified his army.
[1:21:01] Now it has something to do with
[1:21:03] garments. Now clothing covering.
[1:21:08] He said God fortified his army. What?
[1:21:10] With himself.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; In the form of prophets, apostles,
[1:21:17] teachers, pastors. What did he do? What
[1:21:19] was God doing? Listen. Did you ever
[1:21:21] think what that offices of the church
[1:21:23] is? It is God's dress.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; So I'm looking on that. So I'm looking
[1:21:31] at this sin in the scriptures
[1:21:35] as prophetic in the sense that
[1:21:39] everything that have happened now we're
[1:21:41] seeing some symbolical things being
[1:21:45] manifested in our day. Amen. for we
[1:21:49] don't know how long th those bees were
[1:21:51] being tied there but when the time came
[1:21:56] that the master will be using them.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we don't know people they're
[1:22:03] just out there being tired of word the
[1:22:06] world being tired of their job being
[1:22:08] tired of everything. But if they are
[1:22:10] predestinated seed of God their time
[1:22:13] will come.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:17] You might be running from the ministry.
[1:22:20] Brother Barry, brother Murvvin. Amen.
[1:22:25] We might have been on the same ship.
[1:22:28] Amen. We're tied with something. I was
[1:22:31] tied with my profession. I was tied with
[1:22:33] with something. My wife didn't want to
[1:22:35] marry a a minister because she was a
[1:22:39] daughter of a pastor, one of the
[1:22:41] pioneers of the message ministry in the
[1:22:44] Philippines. Amen. And she grew up in
[1:22:47] the message. Amen. And she grew up you
[1:22:51] know that you know all of them their
[1:22:52] lives all the people all the believer
[1:22:54] were watching them. Amen. As if they're
[1:22:57] being tied to something. We have to do
[1:22:59] this. We have to do that. We cannot do
[1:23:01] that. We cannot.
[1:23:03] Amen. They're be and at that time the
[1:23:06] ministry was so strong. Amen. When I
[1:23:10] first attended the message church Amen.
[1:23:12] I thought it was forbidden to laugh.
[1:23:17] because everybody looks serious.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And my father-in-law, he he was so
[1:23:22] conservative. Amen. And and and so I
[1:23:25] thought how
[1:23:28] Amen. So So my wife was being tied with
[1:23:31] this principle. And so that why she said
[1:23:34] in her heart, I will not marry a
[1:23:37] minister.
[1:23:39] Amen. And when I came to the message, I
[1:23:42] am not interested because I was tied
[1:23:45] with my profession. I'm receiving one
[1:23:47] promotion to the other. Amen. And then
[1:23:50] we were telling I was telling at that
[1:23:52] time, Amen. Not not to brag, but I was a
[1:23:54] master teacher not only in the local
[1:23:56] school, but I was a master teacher in
[1:23:58] the whole division. Amen. I belong to
[1:24:01] the core group. Amen. Of uh uh teachers,
[1:24:05] training teachers.
[1:24:07] Amen. We're we're uh discovering new uh
[1:24:11] uh uh uh new trend, new skills, amen, of
[1:24:14] how to teach so that you know the the
[1:24:16] the students will not be bored of
[1:24:19] learning. Amen. And
[1:24:22] so you see but I was tied with those
[1:24:25] things. Amen. But time came.
[1:24:30] Amen. Time came. Lose them.
[1:24:36] Amen. I we were loose. So you see now
[1:24:39] here it comes now they are God's dress
[1:24:42] the pipled ministry they are God's dress
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; and God fortified Amen his army through
[1:24:50] the pipled ministry
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; amen and look at that the the disciples
[1:24:55] the two disciples being sent they they
[1:24:57] put their clothes their garments on top
[1:25:00] of that beast amen they clothe that
[1:25:03] beast so that Jesus will ride on that
[1:25:06] are you seeing something. Amen. So the
[1:25:09] pipel ministry, Amen. If you go on on
[1:25:13] Revelation chapter 19, the bride is
[1:25:16] dressed
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; with a wedding garment.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. How is the bride being being uh h
[1:25:24] uh uh worn that kind of garment through
[1:25:27] the preaching of the word
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; through the pipel ministry. That is our
[1:25:31] covering. Amen. Hallelujah. Adam in his
[1:25:35] pollen condition tried to cover their
[1:25:37] nakedness but it was not enough
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; because of his his pollen condition. He
[1:25:44] knew that they had to be covered because
[1:25:48] it was already shameful for them
[1:25:51] to stand before God. Amen. But because
[1:25:54] of his spoiling condition, he was not
[1:25:57] able to make a garment to find a garment
[1:26:00] suitable for the their condition. But
[1:26:03] what God did, Amen. God removed that.
[1:26:06] Amen. And killed to sacrifice and and
[1:26:09] and and taken all those and uh uh uh
[1:26:12] skins and clothing them with with bloody
[1:26:15] coats of skins.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now it's the same
[1:26:20] thing. So God has to train the Lord
[1:26:24] trained his disciples.
[1:26:27] Amen. And so in that way these disciples
[1:26:30] know how to dress the bride.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; They put their garments said now. Amen.
[1:26:38] They put on their garments to that
[1:26:40] beast. And look how what is that? It's
[1:26:42] God's dress. Not only God's dress look
[1:26:46] inside dress.
[1:26:50] Amen.
[1:26:52] The pipel ministry is God's dress inside
[1:26:56] dress.
[1:26:58] That's why I say I like this portion
[1:27:00] because you know uh we have you know
[1:27:04] inside dress and the inside is what
[1:27:06] touches the skin.
[1:27:08] It's the closest.
[1:27:11] Amen. Inside dress.
[1:27:15] What does that mean?
[1:27:18] The word
[1:27:20] is the flesh.
[1:27:22] Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the beginning was the word and
[1:27:25] the word was with God and the word was
[1:27:28] God. Amen. And so if the body is the
[1:27:32] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:35] and the pipled ministry is God's dress
[1:27:39] and inside dress that means it is the
[1:27:43] one that embraces
[1:27:46] the skin. It is the one that embraces
[1:27:49] the reality of the word. Amen. They are
[1:27:53] the ones that have personal experiences
[1:27:56] with the word so that they when they
[1:27:58] preach the gospel when they preach the
[1:28:00] message of the hour their preaching is
[1:28:02] not only coming from their head but it
[1:28:05] is coming from their heart because it is
[1:28:07] their own experience.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So that's why this
[1:28:13] ministry because of their personal
[1:28:14] experiences they are able to dress the
[1:28:18] bride.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as Morci dress Esther
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; so that she knows how to conduct herself
[1:28:26] before the king.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, amen, it's God's dress
[1:28:30] inside dress. An apostle, a prophet, a
[1:28:32] seer for see before Satan ever gets to
[1:28:34] it. Dan told it. What is it? God dress
[1:28:37] up in his church.
[1:28:40] These offices is God's dress wear.
[1:28:42] Glory. When you see those offices,
[1:28:44] pastors, teachers, evangelists, what is
[1:28:46] that? That is God's dress wear.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; So the ministry is a covering. The
[1:28:52] ministry is a protection for the bride.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] So the offices is God's dress where when
[1:29:03] you see those offices, pastors,
[1:29:04] teachers, evangelists, what is that?
[1:29:06] That is God's dressear, God's presence,
[1:29:08] God's spirit working through man. Amen.
[1:29:13] Working through man, not any gadget.
[1:29:17] And if that office denies of this word,
[1:29:20] then it's not God dressing.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; No, not that. That's the wolf in sheep's
[1:29:24] clothing. Watch that fellow.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So the pipel ministry
[1:29:31] has a great portion in fortifying the
[1:29:35] bride.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So these are vindicated ministry
[1:29:41] of the Lord.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And who is this? They ask who is this?
[1:29:45] Amen. Now, so you see
[1:29:50] when he come to Jerusalem, when he came
[1:29:53] to Jerusalem,
[1:29:56] uh
[1:29:58] you just try to imagine that he was
[1:30:01] entering into the city and he knew what
[1:30:04] will happen to him.
[1:30:08] We came here. I came here with all my
[1:30:11] excitement.
[1:30:13] Not because I'm a big or great preacher
[1:30:17] whatsoever. But I have come here with an
[1:30:19] excitement, with an anticipation that
[1:30:22] I'm meeting the people of the Lord.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. By just meeting you, shaking your
[1:30:29] hand, hugging you brothers. Amen. And uh
[1:30:33] so it's something it's something that is
[1:30:34] so special because on the other side of
[1:30:36] the world and then you come here and
[1:30:39] then you come to realize we believe the
[1:30:41] same thing. We we stand on the same on
[1:30:43] the same principle. Amen. It's something
[1:30:46] that is
[1:30:48] a blessing. Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Appreciate brother uh uh Demar and uh uh
[1:30:55] you know they have come here the the the
[1:30:58] brothers from Edmonton they have come
[1:31:00] here they traveled.
[1:31:02] What's that? It's not it's not because
[1:31:05] of brother Danny. Of course that's part
[1:31:07] of it. I'm stepping on the garment
[1:31:09] before it touches the the dirt. Amen. I
[1:31:13] thank God for that. Amen. We are
[1:31:15] privileged because of that. Amen. But on
[1:31:18] top of it, amen. You have come here
[1:31:20] because you're under anticipation
[1:31:22] because we want to hear the word of the
[1:31:24] Lord. Not the word of brother Danny, but
[1:31:26] the preaching of the word. We come here
[1:31:28] because we are so positive that when we
[1:31:31] go out of that door, Amen. We will not
[1:31:34] be the same again.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; We are better than yesterday.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're so much positive. That's why
[1:31:41] we are we have come here probably. We
[1:31:43] have come here. Amen. We heard the
[1:31:44] pastor said, "Amen. Is there any
[1:31:46] unspoken prayer request? You have come
[1:31:48] here because you have something in your
[1:31:49] heart that that before the the meeting
[1:31:52] ends, God will answer the prayer.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, Jesus was coming
[1:31:57] to Jerusalem. And he knew he will be
[1:32:01] arrested.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; He knew he will suffer. He knew he will
[1:32:05] not only be weep with those bitterness,
[1:32:08] with those cruelties,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; so much hatred.
[1:32:12] But he came anyhow.
[1:32:15] He came anyhow.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; It's because of us.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know sometimes when we
[1:32:22] when we feel there is some kind of a
[1:32:24] danger
[1:32:26] sometimes it's better for us let us not
[1:32:28] go. Amen. But he did not forbid himself
[1:32:34] coming through.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew how hard it will be. He
[1:32:40] knew he will die. He knew he will be
[1:32:42] crucified.
[1:32:43] Hallelujah. But it's because of us.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:49] So now he said now he said they were
[1:32:52] under uh anticipation. Uh now he said
[1:32:56] now of course knowing what he was to be
[1:32:58] there and loved him the way they did.
[1:33:01] They were waiting for him. There were
[1:33:02] crowd that was probably pushing shoing
[1:33:05] from one gate to the other. One watching
[1:33:06] out in every way for they knew that one
[1:33:08] of the hours he would appear. They were
[1:33:11] watching. Oh, that's what's the matter
[1:33:14] today. The people who are looking for
[1:33:15] him coming is under great anticipation
[1:33:18] and expectations. We can feel it. The
[1:33:20] pressure and they're seeking watching
[1:33:23] every move and every sign comparing it
[1:33:25] with the scriptures. And when they seen
[1:33:28] all these things that was predicted of
[1:33:29] him right up to the end, they knew the
[1:33:32] end was nigh. They wanted to be there.
[1:33:35] So they watched. Part of the crowds was
[1:33:37] for him in the minority.
[1:33:40] Some were against him. Most of them 90%
[1:33:44] was against him. And that's about the
[1:33:47] way it is today in the religious crowds.
[1:33:50] When it really come down to the word and
[1:33:51] Christ, there's about 1% that would
[1:33:54] believe it. The other part would pay
[1:33:56] attention to it. No matter that was
[1:33:58] done, what was done? They would pass off
[1:34:00] some kind of a joke or throw Islam about
[1:34:02] it. Just about the same. Time things
[1:34:06] don't change very much. History just
[1:34:09] repeats itself.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go back to this two. As I
[1:34:17] said,
[1:34:19] Jesus was only riding for one.
[1:34:22] Why did he said loose them,
[1:34:27] saying unto them, go into the village,
[1:34:30] verse two, over against you, and
[1:34:31] straightway you shall find an ass tied
[1:34:34] and called with her. loose them
[1:34:38] and bring them
[1:34:40] unto me. And if any man say ought unto
[1:34:44] you, ye shall say, the Lord had need of
[1:34:47] them, and straightway he will send them.
[1:34:50] And this is what I want to leave
[1:34:53] with you this evening.
[1:34:55] I see two generations here,
[1:34:59] amen, being present at that time. And
[1:35:02] this is a prophetic presentation
[1:35:05] that a part was fulfilled 2,000 years
[1:35:08] ago and the other part is being
[1:35:10] fulfilled today.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Because that young ass 2,000 years ago,
[1:35:17] that young beast 2,000 years ago was
[1:35:21] just following.
[1:35:23] Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Just following where. Amen. Maybe when
[1:35:27] they were both tied. Amen. was asking,
[1:35:29] "Mama, you know, I'm see I I I see some
[1:35:32] other kids out there. They're just
[1:35:35] playing, jumping, you know." Amen. Why
[1:35:37] are we here being tied? Amen.
[1:35:40] But the answer would say, "Just answer.
[1:35:44] Our time will come. Our time will come."
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the day came. Hallelujah.
[1:35:50] So now when the when when that was
[1:35:53] fulfilled and let me put it this way
[1:35:56] this is the se the subtitle of my
[1:35:58] message being loosed for the master's
[1:36:01] use my subtitle is riding his trail
[1:36:04] again
[1:36:06] he said now in the message on the wings
[1:36:08] of a snow white dove he said why me an
[1:36:11] old man suffered all my life why did he
[1:36:14] heal me now I believe I'll ride this
[1:36:18] trail again
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:36:20] I got to bring a message.
[1:36:24] And I say to my father tonight as junior
[1:36:27] seen in in a dream the other night of
[1:36:29] the wings of this dove moving in these
[1:36:31] windows here. Lord, your servants
[1:36:34] reporting for service. Amen. I'm ready.
[1:36:38] You know the prophets
[1:36:40] when Isaiah said, Amen. Behold, a virgin
[1:36:45] shall conceive.
[1:36:48] It was spoken by the prophet by a God's
[1:36:51] prophet but that was not his word. Amen.
[1:36:56] He was only a microphone like brother
[1:36:59] Brandham Amen referred to himself and he
[1:37:02] said so it's the same thing when he said
[1:37:04] I'll ride this trail again.
[1:37:08] I don't take it that he will rose from
[1:37:14] the dead
[1:37:16] and once again will go around the whole
[1:37:18] world and preach this message once
[1:37:21] again.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the eye here is not actually
[1:37:26] amen. It's the voice of the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:29] It's William Marian Branham in the
[1:37:31] flesh. But he only spoken what the word
[1:37:35] said.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. what the spirit said.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; So that I said I'll ride this trail
[1:37:42] again. It's not brother Benham per se.
[1:37:45] It's not brother Benham as a person.
[1:37:47] It's God riding the trail once again.
[1:37:50] Through whom? Through the bride of the
[1:37:51] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So that's why
[1:37:54] that young ass mean he was loose also
[1:37:57] but he was not used then.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's in symbolic form. Amen.
[1:38:03] 2,000 years have passed. And then in
[1:38:05] that prophetic principle, in that
[1:38:07] symbolic standard, we now see that once
[1:38:11] again there is a beast today, that young
[1:38:14] beast before is a matured beast today in
[1:38:17] the form of the bride.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he, the Lord is riding
[1:38:21] once again. Amen. In this last day and
[1:38:24] age, amen, with the same spirit.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now he said go. Amen.
[1:38:30] And so loose them. So that's why uh uh
[1:38:34] we see uh you see now he said in in the
[1:38:37] message who do you say this is your king
[1:38:39] comes to you upon the fall of banas and
[1:38:41] he slowly and meek that's how he come so
[1:38:44] remember there is always a transfer of
[1:38:46] ministry during the time of Moses Joshua
[1:38:49] came amen during the time of Elijah
[1:38:54] Elisha came all right so during our time
[1:38:57] the prophet of God is no longer here but
[1:39:00] the pipled ministry is present
[1:39:02] dressing the bride,
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; fulfilling uh the uh uh continuing the
[1:39:08] ministry of Malachi 4. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:39:12] Because it's God. It's the message of
[1:39:14] the Lord. Amen. And so here uh uh we see
[1:39:17] that what have happened before just like
[1:39:19] in Malachi 4. Amen. We have the Elijah
[1:39:22] before. Amen. So Luke in in 2 Kings
[1:39:25] chapter 2 10-14 in verse 10, he said,
[1:39:28] "Thou has asked a hard thing." So
[1:39:30] Elishah asked something. Elijah, what
[1:39:32] Elisha, what do you want? Amen. And
[1:39:34] Elisha said, I want a double portion of
[1:39:37] what you have.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, and he said, "Thou has asked a
[1:39:41] hard thing. Nevertheless, if thou see me
[1:39:46] when I am taken from thee, it shall be
[1:39:49] so unto thee. But if not, it shall not
[1:39:52] be so." This is very clear. If thou
[1:39:56] shalt see me go,
[1:40:00] Elijah,
[1:40:01] the original Elijah said, you have asked
[1:40:05] a hard thing, but
[1:40:08] if you shall see me taken up,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; if thou shalt see me go, Hallelujah. Our
[1:40:15] generation probably we have not sinned
[1:40:18] personally, brother Brandham. We have
[1:40:21] heard the message of God through him.
[1:40:24] Hallelujah. And now you know look
[1:40:26] looking back and now little by little
[1:40:28] one by one those who have personally
[1:40:31] walked with the prophet
[1:40:34] is now one by one coming off the scene.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; It's a new generation coming in.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we see that at that that
[1:40:48] the time the day and age that we are
[1:40:50] living in there is a transition. All
[1:40:52] right. We still believe the prophet
[1:40:54] because God has used him so mightily.
[1:40:57] But we have to accept the fact that the
[1:41:00] prophet is no longer on the scene.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is already a pipled
[1:41:05] ministry now. And that was Elijah said
[1:41:08] to Elisha, "If thou see me being taken
[1:41:12] out of the scene." So Elijah was
[1:41:16] watching the life of the prophet. Elisha
[1:41:19] was able to see when he was being taken
[1:41:21] by the flaming chariot. Hallelujah. This
[1:41:24] generation, hallelujah, have seen the
[1:41:28] fading h you know, we're not forgetting
[1:41:31] the man. We're not forgetting how humble
[1:41:33] he had presented the message of the
[1:41:35] hour. But we have to accept the fact
[1:41:37] that we're living in another in in in
[1:41:39] this generation. Amen. And this is the
[1:41:42] generation, hallelujah, that the baton
[1:41:45] had been passed to somebody else. And
[1:41:47] that is through the pipel ministry.
[1:41:49] Hallelujah. So he is riding the trail
[1:41:52] again through the bride.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now he said nevertheless he
[1:41:57] said shall but if not it shall not be
[1:42:00] so. Amen. And so later on he took up
[1:42:02] also look the mantle of Elijah.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; The garment of Elijah.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; There's nothing special to that. Amen.
[1:42:12] But that's a representation of
[1:42:14] something. And he took the mantle of
[1:42:16] Elijah that fell from him and smoked the
[1:42:18] water and said, "Where is the Lord God
[1:42:19] of Elijah?" And when he also had
[1:42:21] smitten, the waters departed heighter
[1:42:23] and tighter. And Elisha went over. Amen.
[1:42:27] So he took the mantle. He took the
[1:42:30] garment. What did the Bible ministry
[1:42:32] took? Amen. Have taken the message of
[1:42:34] the hour. This is the mantle.
[1:42:36] Hallelujah. And when we and when when we
[1:42:38] we hit the water, when we spread the
[1:42:41] gospel of the hour, we say, "Where is
[1:42:43] the God of William Marian Brana?"
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not looking for the
[1:42:48] person. We will see him on the other
[1:42:50] side. He will present us. His gener
[1:42:55] is his generation. He said, "Will also
[1:42:57] Paul?"
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; And when when the boy said, "Yes."
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul will present his people in
[1:43:07] his generation. Well, I'm sure of that
[1:43:10] now because I preach what Paul preached.
[1:43:13] We're resting on that.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that means Amen. The the the
[1:43:19] mantle, the baton. Amen. The message of
[1:43:22] the hour still here.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the message that that
[1:43:26] is what we are after. Amen. So that's
[1:43:29] why in in God commissioning Moses, Amen.
[1:43:32] Brother Bana made mention also Amen. Now
[1:43:34] notice then he said nevertheless if you
[1:43:36] see me go you'll have what you ask. So
[1:43:40] he walked on I can see him keeping his
[1:43:42] eye on that prophet. Amen. Oh I can hear
[1:43:45] him something. Oh Elijah look over this
[1:43:47] way. So he's always he was always
[1:43:49] watching. So it's the same thing. We are
[1:43:51] always watching. We appreciate the
[1:43:53] prophet. We appreciate we love the
[1:43:55] testimonies but we should have our own
[1:43:58] testimonies.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Just like that uh uh baby of uh uh
[1:44:08] coming baby of Micah and Genesis. Amen.
[1:44:11] We have come into that in into that
[1:44:14] situation. Amen. The we're coming into
[1:44:17] brother Benham said after uh after God
[1:44:20] was pleased Amen. with
[1:44:24] with Haiti right I stopped because this
[1:44:27] is part of my preaching tomorrow.
[1:44:31] But anyway, there's no tomorrow. We
[1:44:33] don't know. So we said, so Haiti right
[1:44:36] was there. Amen. And he said, God was so
[1:44:39] pleased because you said the right
[1:44:40] thing. Amen. And said, say what you want
[1:44:42] and it will come to pass.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And right said, I don't know what
[1:44:46] to say. Can you say it for me? But we
[1:44:48] are in another age.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Haty have watched the prophet so much
[1:44:55] that she believed.
[1:44:58] Amen. Oh, brother Brennham, that's
[1:45:00] nothing but the truth.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; While others were saying, "Oh, it's too
[1:45:05] good to be true." But that innocent
[1:45:08] woman said, "Brother Brham, that's
[1:45:10] nothing but the truth, Brother Brenham."
[1:45:13] Amen.
[1:45:14] And so God was pleased. The Holy Spirit
[1:45:16] was pleased. And the voice was heard
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; by Brother Benham. Tell that woman,
[1:45:23] tell her what she wants, and it will
[1:45:25] come to pass. Say it,
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham. Can you say it for me?
[1:45:28] No, that's not the instruction. Say it.
[1:45:31] And brother Benham even gave him a
[1:45:33] suggestion.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. But she asked the
[1:45:38] right thing.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. She spoke for the salvation of her
[1:45:43] two sons.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and down low. Amen. In
[1:45:48] that statement, brother Benham said, "We
[1:45:50] are entering into that spear now."
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Where is the bride now?
[1:45:56] Amen. We are in that. We are given we
[1:45:59] should have we are we are now we should
[1:46:02] be living the prophecy now the prophecy
[1:46:05] that was given by the prophet spoken by
[1:46:07] the prophet that the bride amen will
[1:46:10] will be in her rightful position.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can claim what is being promised
[1:46:16] for her day. Amen. This is the time that
[1:46:19] we are living in.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And because we're watching
[1:46:23] the life of the prophet, we're watching
[1:46:25] the the life being made manifest by this
[1:46:28] message of the hour. God has given us so
[1:46:31] much confidence.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you see the
[1:46:34] representation of that. It's no longer
[1:46:36] the prophet speaking.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's the bride speaking.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Benham, can you say
[1:46:45] it for me? Amen. We will come. We have
[1:46:48] come to the time. Amen. And brother,
[1:46:51] even you are alone, sister. Even if you
[1:46:53] are just right there. Amen. Remember
[1:46:56] that the Holy Spirit is omniresent
[1:46:58] because he knows, Amen. what's going on
[1:47:02] all over.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; He knows what's going on. He knows what
[1:47:05] you're going through.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; But you have to have confidence.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That the voice is in you.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; The voice is in the bride.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now, that's why he's
[1:47:18] saying now, Amen. after 2,000 years ago.
[1:47:21] Amen. That Amen. And and look at the
[1:47:24] picture. Look at that picture. Amen.
[1:47:26] Behind that ass. Amen. That was being
[1:47:29] being uh uh used by the Lord 2,000 years
[1:47:32] ago. That young ass was just following
[1:47:35] just like Elijah. Elisha always
[1:47:37] following Elijah.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, a good leader
[1:47:43] should be a good follower.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He's just looking like
[1:47:48] there following following. And when his
[1:47:52] time came
[1:47:54] and the time is now,
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; the beast that was young 2,000 years ago
[1:47:59] is the same beast today.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Where the bride, Amen, who is the bride
[1:48:06] and the king is riding his trail again.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; In this generation, it's Christ in the
[1:48:13] bride. It's Christ being made manifest.
[1:48:17] Hallelujah. Remember this. Amen. I
[1:48:20] preached this uh bread team last
[1:48:22] Wednesday. Amen. He said when John heard
[1:48:24] the voice, Amen. He said John Amen. Uh
[1:48:28] uh when he and then when he looked he he
[1:48:31] he said uh and when I turned he said he
[1:48:34] heard the voice, right? He heard the
[1:48:36] voice and then John said I turned to see
[1:48:41] the voice.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:44] Can you see the voice?
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; You hear the voice?
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he John turned to see the
[1:48:52] voice.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Now check your Bible. What did John saw
[1:48:58] when he turned to see the voice? He saw
[1:49:01] the seven golden candlesticks.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; What is that? The church, the bride.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So where is the voice? In the
[1:49:09] bride.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So people will be you know they
[1:49:15] they they will love Amen. They they we
[1:49:17] appreciate the word we testify. Amen.
[1:49:20] You know but people the bride John types
[1:49:22] the bride.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we preach the word when
[1:49:26] we share the message of the hour the
[1:49:28] bride will attract the bride.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That when they turn to see the
[1:49:33] voice they will see the bride. That's
[1:49:35] me. That's like me.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Because the voice is
[1:49:40] in the bride. Amen.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; They're looking for a person,
[1:49:45] looking for a true witness of the word,
[1:49:48] looking for somebody. Brother said,
[1:49:50] "Sometimes we are good in debating this
[1:49:53] message, but we're not leaving it."
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now that's the
[1:49:59] condition. So our time, Amen. our time
[1:50:02] has come. Amen. And and and and now is
[1:50:05] that's why you see these two generation.
[1:50:07] Amen. the two generation now the the
[1:50:10] again the the the the fold that was
[1:50:12] young at that time is no longer young in
[1:50:15] this day and age it's already matured
[1:50:17] and we are representing it because the
[1:50:20] power that is in the bride now as we
[1:50:23] approach the conclusion now he said in
[1:50:25] Ephesians chapter 4 8 and 9 wherefore he
[1:50:28] saith when he ascended up on high he led
[1:50:30] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:50:32] men now that he ascended what is it but
[1:50:35] that he also descended first into the
[1:50:38] lower parts of the earth. Now we we
[1:50:42] connect that to 2 Corinthians 3:17. Now
[1:50:45] the Lord
[1:50:47] is that spirit.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is that spirit and where
[1:50:54] the spirit of the Lord is
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; there is liberty.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bam said in the church
[1:51:01] ages they have bound the Holy Spirit
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; because of their creeds and dogmas.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; The spirit cannot move.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit cannot move. But the
[1:51:12] time came, hallelujah, through the
[1:51:14] ministry. Amen. Through the prophecy
[1:51:16] that the Holy Spirit was being released.
[1:51:18] Amen. When the seals were broken,
[1:51:22] Amen. the power of God had been released
[1:51:26] as well.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; But remember, Amen. when he open up
[1:51:30] every seal. Amen. Amen. The uh the the
[1:51:33] horse rider is also coming out.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he opened the first seal,
[1:51:39] Amen. The white horse came out.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; There's one riding on it. So, as as we
[1:51:45] are receiving the full revelation, Amen.
[1:51:50] We're also receiving the full
[1:51:51] manifestation of the word of God, but
[1:51:53] the full power of hell is also
[1:51:59] coming out.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is war.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But you see where the
[1:52:06] spirit of God is, there is liberty.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Remember you know that I like that
[1:52:11] illustration of brother Brennan you know
[1:52:13] when he uh came down when his spirit
[1:52:16] when he you know in the flesh the spirit
[1:52:18] separated and he went down to the lower
[1:52:21] parts. Amen. To the souls that were in
[1:52:24] prison. Amen. And what a very nice
[1:52:28] illustration. He knocked every
[1:52:31] every door and he was introducing
[1:52:34] himself. Amen. My blood is still fresh
[1:52:37] up there at the
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; in Calvary. Hallelujah. Amen. And he
[1:52:42] went down and all the saints.
[1:52:45] Amen. That's why I say the first revival
[1:52:48] happened in hell.
[1:52:50] [Laughter]
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of God came down.
[1:52:55] Amen. And where the spirit of God is,
[1:52:58] there is liberty.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he unlock all the doors. And
[1:53:04] that's why all the saints in the Old
[1:53:05] Testament were being released. Amen.
[1:53:08] Hallelujah. Uh uh from Adam, Amen. All
[1:53:13] these saints, Amen. in the Old
[1:53:15] Testament, they have seen the
[1:53:17] fulfillment of the prophecy. They were
[1:53:19] only preaching a prophecy. Amen. Because
[1:53:23] no one uh uh had been forgiven during
[1:53:26] the Old Testament
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; because the blood of bulls and goats
[1:53:30] cannot forgive sin.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; It can only cover sin. So the sins were
[1:53:35] there. So they had to offer year by year
[1:53:37] and they had to repeat it again. But
[1:53:40] there's no bornagain experience. Amen.
[1:53:42] But where the spirit of God there is
[1:53:45] liberty. Amen.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; So when the the spirit of God came down,
[1:53:49] Amen. in the pits of hell,
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; there was liberty.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; There was rejoicing. They could not hold
[1:53:56] them anymore.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so graves were open and
[1:54:00] they were seen by many because where the
[1:54:03] spirit of there is liberty.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And so that's why
[1:54:08] everything was loose. Amen. And
[1:54:10] everybody Amen. came out. Amen. And so
[1:54:13] uh uh uh when the in his resurrection
[1:54:16] there were also spirits amen that were
[1:54:18] casted out amen even from from Mary
[1:54:22] brother Benham said amen. So in John
[1:54:24] 8:36 and this is my last verse now if
[1:54:27] the son therefore shall make you free
[1:54:30] shall be free
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; indeed.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:36] So lose them.
[1:54:40] So
[1:54:41] sometimes if you see there are many
[1:54:43] implications there.
[1:54:46] Sometimes we're waiting for God
[1:54:50] to use us. But there's virtue in
[1:54:53] waiting.
[1:54:54] Hallelujah.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; That young ass, he just kept on
[1:54:58] following.
[1:55:00] Never overtook.
[1:55:03] I'm stronger.
[1:55:05] I have more revelated.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm the third generation message.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; No respect.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Peter and John. Amen.
[1:55:19] John because John was younger and Peter
[1:55:22] was
[1:55:24] older.
[1:55:26] He was senior.
[1:55:28] But they have heard the news. Amen. That
[1:55:31] the tomb was opened and the body of
[1:55:35] Jesus wasn't there anymore. Amen. They
[1:55:38] ran together. But John was young. So he
[1:55:42] went ahead. Amen. But with due respect,
[1:55:47] he could have entered
[1:55:50] directly.
[1:55:53] But he waited for this Peter. Peter,
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; he let Peter come first.
[1:55:59] Amen. He could have taken the first
[1:56:02] revelation.
[1:56:04] Amen. But he asked the older one, "Come
[1:56:06] in, Peter." Hallelujah. So that young
[1:56:09] ass, he just kept on following
[1:56:11] following.
[1:56:13] But when his generation came when our
[1:56:16] time comes that the Lord will use us.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Even if we're not a minister,
[1:56:24] said the the pipled ministry, it
[1:56:26] composes the bride as a hood. We all
[1:56:29] have our participation. We're not just
[1:56:32] visitors here.
[1:56:34] We bear the burden together.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; We're part of the team.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, there was um an
[1:56:45] illustration one time. Amen. There was
[1:56:47] an ass or a horse that was tied in a uh
[1:56:51] in a in a post and probably
[1:56:55] uh there was about 4 m of rope that he
[1:57:01] was tied with.
[1:57:03] And so every time every morning so he he
[1:57:06] he wake up and he's tied in that post.
[1:57:10] So he walk but he cannot go farther than
[1:57:14] four meters. So what he does he go
[1:57:17] around that's the only circle he goes
[1:57:22] around every day of his life. So when he
[1:57:26] goes at the he close to the to the post
[1:57:30] then he go back again.
[1:57:33] Amen. But he cannot go farther from the
[1:57:37] 4 m rope. That's how far he can go
[1:57:41] because he's tied all his life. And
[1:57:43] that's the only limitation he had.
[1:57:47] That's the only thing that he could see.
[1:57:50] Amen. because that's how he grew up with
[1:57:54] that circle.
[1:57:57] That's how far he goes. Amen. But one
[1:58:00] day, somebody is watching
[1:58:03] and he pitted the the horse and he cut
[1:58:07] secretly the rope. Amen. So one morning
[1:58:13] that horse stood up and he made he made
[1:58:16] a a mark already. So that's why all his
[1:58:19] life he was going through those marks
[1:58:23] and it's just automatic you know so in
[1:58:27] uh in the afternoon he goes back amen
[1:58:30] and he go that circle
[1:58:32] and because he used he is being used to
[1:58:37] that distance only and he was used to
[1:58:40] just walking through that circle that
[1:58:44] mark that he made all his life.
[1:58:48] He could not go farther because he
[1:58:50] didn't realize the rope was cut already.
[1:58:55] Amen.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; But maybe one day his lead
[1:58:59] and he went farther from 4 mters and he
[1:59:02] looked. Amen. He was farther than the
[1:59:06] daily circle.
[1:59:09] Amen. And he stood up and he went
[1:59:12] farther.
[1:59:14] Amen. And he went farther and farther
[1:59:19] and he said, "I'm free."
[1:59:23] All his life.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe all his life we're just
[1:59:27] sitting in the pew. Amen. We're just
[1:59:29] hearing things. Amen. Repeatedly.
[1:59:31] Repeat. And we're just, you know,
[1:59:32] sometimes we we we are challenged. We
[1:59:34] are faced with something. Amen. And and
[1:59:37] we cannot overcome it. And then we fall.
[1:59:39] Amen. And then we go up again. Amen. And
[1:59:42] then we realize, Amen. But when we when
[1:59:44] we have that personal experience of the
[1:59:47] Holy Spirit when the spirit of God is
[1:59:50] there is liberty.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Now you have an experience. Amen. Before
[1:59:54] Amen. I used to hear I used to share the
[1:59:57] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:58] Christ because that was the first thing
[2:00:00] that I have learned. That was the first
[2:00:03] thing that I have accepted. So every
[2:00:05] time I share no matter what kind of
[2:00:08] discussion I always go back to the
[2:00:10] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:12] Christ. Amen. When I learned about the
[2:00:14] mystery of the new birth, I found out
[2:00:16] what's what's reality. Amen. About the
[2:00:19] original sin. Oh, everywhere I go. Amen.
[2:00:22] Because I grew up as a Catholic. I came
[2:00:24] directly from Catholic to the message of
[2:00:26] the hour. Amen. So everywhere I go, it's
[2:00:29] not an apple. It's not an apple. Amen.
[2:00:32] But later on, I go further. Amen. The
[2:00:34] first seal is being open. Second seal is
[2:00:36] being open. I go further and farther.
[2:00:38] And now say, I'll pray.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where the spirit of God is,
[2:00:43] there is liberty.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same thing. Hallelujah.
[2:00:48] In our daily life, in our daily living,
[2:00:50] sometimes we're being tired. Sometimes
[2:00:52] we do the same thing again. Sometimes we
[2:00:54] fall on the same challenges again. But
[2:00:56] let me announce, let me declare to you
[2:00:58] that we're free.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes our experiences before,
[2:01:04] oh, I was this before, I cannot go away
[2:01:07] from it. You're so tired. You're so
[2:01:09] bound with it. You always blame
[2:01:11] yourself.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; We're free.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; We're being justified.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; As if you have not done it in the first
[2:01:21] place.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; We We're free.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes people, oh, I have
[2:01:30] something with this brother. I have
[2:01:32] something with this brother, with this
[2:01:34] sister. We're being tied with it. And
[2:01:38] that will fall. Amen.
[2:01:40] in that kindness and and if we're not be
[2:01:42] careful, it will fall down to
[2:01:44] bitterness, hatred. You will be bound
[2:01:46] again. But where the spirit of God is,
[2:01:50] there's liberty.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; We're free. We we can rejoice.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; We can always worship the Lord.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; We're free.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We're children of
[2:02:03] freedom
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; because where the spirit of God is,
[2:02:06] there is liberty
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; all our lives. Amen. We've been tied to
[2:02:11] something. We're bound. We're being
[2:02:13] bound by the religious I was telling uh
[2:02:17] uh uh your pastor, brother Barry, I I'm
[2:02:20] still here and there is already
[2:02:23] island in the Philippines in Romelon
[2:02:25] Island where I conducted mystery
[2:02:28] exposition in 2018.
[2:02:30] I received a a a message through
[2:02:33] messenger and said, "Pastor Danny, I
[2:02:35] hope you remember us." Amen. Uh would
[2:02:38] you help us? Amen. Because uh uh uh uh
[2:02:41] uh uh time have come. Amen. Uh and I I
[2:02:46] even forgot them because when I shared
[2:02:49] this message in 2018 in that island, so
[2:02:51] many said, "Where are you from? Where
[2:02:53] was the last time I met you? I forgive
[2:02:55] me, but I may be old." Amen. And
[2:02:59] Honestly, I've forgotten already. And he
[2:03:02] said, "Oh, you conducted this exposition
[2:03:04] here in the island and it's three hours
[2:03:07] from Manila by land and then you you
[2:03:10] take two hour and a half, you go to the
[2:03:12] island of Brlon. It's a separate island.
[2:03:14] It's a beautiful island also like
[2:03:16] Palawan."
[2:03:18] Amen. So, we have the best marbles
[2:03:20] there, RMLon, right? Amen. So, you see,
[2:03:22] I went there and said, "Oh, I see."
[2:03:24] Because two 2018 I conducted uh mystery
[2:03:28] expo there and I had a very nice feeling
[2:03:31] because the the ministers they said
[2:03:33] after the the two days presentation uh
[2:03:36] they said uh pastor Danny you know we
[2:03:38] really appreciate because we have not
[2:03:40] seen the book of revelation presented
[2:03:42] that way before but they have a very
[2:03:46] strong organization and they have a very
[2:03:49] influential bishop that they were under
[2:03:51] in amen and so that leader probably
[2:03:56] prevented me from coming back. So I
[2:03:57] forgot. Amen. But two weeks ago, Amen.
[2:04:02] He said, "Pastor Danny, dur even during
[2:04:04] pandemic, we we we we we stream some of
[2:04:06] your services and we're so enlightened."
[2:04:09] Brother Danny, please go back help us
[2:04:12] because we are ready to come out of the
[2:04:15] denomination.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; two pastors.
[2:04:20] Hallelujah. Amen. and just sew the seed.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; I still believe in predestination.
[2:04:29] It's not our doing, it's God's doing.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now I see. Amen. Where
[2:04:35] there is the spirit of God is there is
[2:04:38] always liberty.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. They want to be used and they want
[2:04:42] to be put used of by the master.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes we can be more in
[2:04:49] uh uh instrumental
[2:04:52] if we can just yield ourselves. Brother
[2:04:55] said we need to be flexible.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; We need to be like you know to be plant
[2:04:59] and you know because God wants us to be
[2:05:03] used for his glory.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So would you this evening amen
[2:05:08] declare I'm free.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; I'm free.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; You're free. Whatever you have you know.
[2:05:15] Amen. There must be something you must
[2:05:17] be you might you might have a sickness.
[2:05:19] Amen. You might have something in you. I
[2:05:21] don't know but God knows.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that God can use us more
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; so that he can ride his trail again.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Let us all stand up as I call on our
[2:05:33] musician. Amen. And if our song leader
[2:05:35] can can help us. Amen.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing that song. Thank

[2:05:51] head this evening? Amen. This dear
[2:05:54] heavenly father.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; You're so good to us Lord.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. These things Lord God because
[2:06:01] you're you're we're looking through the
[2:06:04] eyes of the prophet.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're seeing things and this Bible
[2:06:08] is becoming far becoming more a new
[2:06:11] Bible to us.
[2:06:13] Lord, you know who we are.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; You know what we are standing for. You
[2:06:21] know what we are doing, Lord.
[2:06:24] Amen. But deep inside,
[2:06:30] we want to be
[2:06:32] useful for your glory.
[2:06:36] But Lord, if there is anything that my
[2:06:40] ma that my brother, my sister is going
[2:06:43] through,
[2:06:46] whatever he or she is being tied up,
[2:06:49] Lord,
[2:06:51] may you cut that robe. Hallelujah.
[2:06:56] Oh Lord Jesus,
[2:06:59] we want freedom
[2:07:01] for your glory.

[2:07:13] the singers, everyone, Lord God, every
[2:07:16] part of this congregation. May we serve
[2:07:19] you with full liberty and freedom.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; We're free, Lord.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; We're free. Sometimes we just don't
[2:07:26] realize how free we are.
[2:07:32] Sometimes we we just take for granted
[2:07:34] what you have done for us.
[2:07:38] Sometimes Lord,
[2:07:43] it is our own perception,
[2:07:47] our own prerogative, our own prejudice,
[2:07:50] Lord,
[2:07:52] that keeps us
[2:07:55] from doing more for your glory.
[2:07:59] Oh Lord, may everything Lord Jesus, may
[2:08:01] you break every chain, Father.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Whatever is preventing us that we can be
[2:08:08] more useful for your glory.
[2:08:11] Lord God, may we declare this afternoon,
[2:08:14] Lord.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; That we are free and we are thankful.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, may you once again, Hallelujah.
[2:08:22] Amen. As the prophet said, you will ride
[2:08:25] this trail again, Lord.
[2:08:28] use us
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; in any way,
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; whether it's small or big. Lord, make
[2:08:35] full use of us. We're willing, Lord.

[2:23:13] Amen. Let's just bow. Heavenly Father,
[2:23:16] Lord, we thank you for this service
[2:23:19] tonight, Lord. Thank you for speaking to
[2:23:21] our hearts directly, Lord Jesus. Father,
[2:23:24] for showing us that you have provided
[2:23:26] the beast of burden, Lord, to take us
[2:23:29] where we need to go, Lord, to have
[2:23:31] complete liberty, Father, because we
[2:23:34] have your spirit. Lord Jesus, we thank
[2:23:36] you that we can have your spirit,
[2:23:38] Father. This world is void of your
[2:23:40] spirit, but your bride, Lord Jesus, is
[2:23:43] in the midst of the bride's revival
[2:23:45] because of your spirit. And we thank you
[2:23:47] for that tonight, Lord. We just ask Lord
[2:23:50] that the word that was spoken would just
[2:23:53] find its mark in the hearts Lord Jesus
[2:23:56] of each one of us tonight. Lord, we ask
[2:23:58] that you would keep your hand upon us
[2:24:00] now as we go our separate ways. And
[2:24:02] Lord, that you would just be with all
[2:24:04] those who couldn't come tonight,
[2:24:05] wherever they are, whatever they're
[2:24:07] doing. Father, minister to them richly
[2:24:10] tonight. We ask father now we ask Lord
[2:24:13] also that you would restore oh father
[2:24:16] brother Danny's strength that you would
[2:24:19] just continue to reveal to him Lord your
[2:24:22] thoughts for tomorrow and Lord Jesus
[2:24:24] will be careful to give you praise. Lord
[2:24:27] we ask that you would just go with us
[2:24:29] now as we
[2:24:31] part ways. We just ask all these things
[2:24:34] in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing that chorus again
[2:24:38] as we dismiss tonight. We're marching
[2:24:44] to Zion. God bless you.
