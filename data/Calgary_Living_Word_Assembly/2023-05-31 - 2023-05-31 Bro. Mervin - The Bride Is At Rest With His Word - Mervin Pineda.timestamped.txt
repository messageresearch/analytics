[41:20] oh God
[41:22] may you be in US Lord
[41:24] to all of us the preacher and even the
[41:26] here Lord

[41:43] any notes without any projection of of
[41:46] slides Lord may you be in control of all
[41:48] things now
[41:49] from beginning to end
[41:51] Jesus Christ name we pray amen thank you
[41:55] musicians
[41:57] maybe while you're standing let's read
[42:00] the
[42:03] two verses
[42:08] Revelations
[42:10] 2 11.
[42:14] very familiar scripture
[42:20] Revelations 2 11. so we will we won't
[42:23] have slides
[42:24] tonight although the topic is very long
[42:27] maybe the ministers who will preach next
[42:30] time and even Barbary will take we will
[42:33] pick up where we will live let's see how
[42:36] it goes but uh yeah I don't want to take
[42:38] lots of your time this evening
[42:41] so let's see where we will be able to
[42:45] to
[42:47] take his word for for tonight amen
[42:52] Revelations 2 11 very simple but very
[42:57] powerful
[42:58] he that had an ear
[43:00] let him hear
[43:03] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[43:07] he that overcome it shall not be heard
[43:10] of the second death
[43:12] amen and Ephesians 4 30.
[43:20] very familiar scripture because the
[43:22] thing is if we are preaching something
[43:23] not familiar there's something might be
[43:25] wrong right so we we're just repeating
[43:28] what the prophet of this age has taught
[43:30] us
[43:31] because we are under his ministry amen
[43:37] Ephesians 4 30 and grieve not the holy
[43:40] spirit of God
[43:42] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[43:45] redemption
[43:46] may the Lord have blessing on the
[43:48] reading of his word you may be seated
[43:50] amen
[43:54] if you can see I'll I'll title my sermon
[43:58] the bride is at rest with this word
[44:02] amen because when you know
[44:05] that this word is for a purpose
[44:07] everything that happens
[44:09] is for ordained regardless of what
[44:13] perspective from man's perspective we
[44:16] know that it could be a difficult to go
[44:20] through that Journey as we've been
[44:22] fellowshipping during the uh with
[44:25] Barbara and Brad Paul
[44:27] if we know then from the beginning
[44:29] because it's written in the word
[44:31] right
[44:32] we will go to rapture we will we will be
[44:34] with him in Paradise in in heaven in
[44:38] Millennium and later on in New Haven and
[44:40] Newark we all know that we will be
[44:42] raptured because we're the bride of
[44:43] Christ
[44:44] amen but then he didn't tell us how we
[44:47] will go through that
[44:49] it it's it's not very clear on on the
[44:52] scripture or on what will happen to
[44:54] Brother Don brother Paul or myself
[44:57] but the good thing is we know the end
[45:00] right but that Journey
[45:02] is always uh it's rough most most of the
[45:07] time
[45:07] right but then there's a purpose for
[45:10] that
[45:11] right because if it's not rough then
[45:13] it's a smooth sailing we might not need
[45:14] God anymore we might not call him
[45:16] anymore if uh if if everything is smooth
[45:19] sailing right if if Joseph
[45:22] would know
[45:24] that he will be in prison although he
[45:27] knew that his family will bow through uh
[45:32] we will bow on him because he he had
[45:34] that uh he had that uh Vision or or
[45:38] dream that he would to become governor
[45:42] basically right because they later on we
[45:45] found out in the scripture that he
[45:47] became governor of Egypt and is next to
[45:50] pharaoh right so it's not mentioned that
[45:53] way but then his family and his brothers
[45:56] and sisters uh the other 11 tribes will
[46:00] bow on him do you think Jacob will sign
[46:03] sign sign up on that even though he's
[46:06] thinking it's great knowing that he will
[46:08] go to prison he will be you know you
[46:11] know all the all the afflictions all the
[46:15] difficulties that he will that he uh
[46:18] encountered do you think he will sign up
[46:19] for that
[46:21] so even us knowing that we will we will
[46:24] be ruptured let's say but then if God
[46:26] will tell us what uh what will be our
[46:28] next step what the afflictions we will
[46:31] take you think uh you think we will sign
[46:34] up
[46:35] for difficulties
[46:36] but then the thing is God is in control
[46:38] he knows right and that's why the bride
[46:41] is at rest
[46:43] knowing that his word will be fulfilled
[46:46] right so there's so many things that we
[46:51] as the bride didn't want to sign up and
[46:55] we think that our prayers are not
[46:57] answered
[46:58] but actually he answers our prayers
[47:02] without knowing it
[47:04] typically we let's say we ask for
[47:06] strength
[47:09] right but that cannot be overnight
[47:12] so what does God do to us so that we can
[47:14] we can have the strength he will give us
[47:17] difficulties
[47:19] right to make us strong so those
[47:22] difficulties
[47:23] amen
[47:25] we
[47:26] will build strength
[47:28] right
[47:29] and and then we ask for wisdom uh
[47:35] wisdom is a gift
[47:37] right but then
[47:39] knowingly if we want to wisdom it's not
[47:42] overnight that oh I give you wisdom here
[47:44] it is no what what he will give us is
[47:47] problems to solve so that we know how to
[47:51] roam around that uh that problem and
[47:54] then we will have the wisdom right so
[47:56] all those white hair with those who who
[47:59] have white hair they they just didn't
[48:01] come overnight they came through age
[48:03] right they came through experience
[48:07] and that's why when we ask for wisdom
[48:09] let's say we ask the elders right
[48:11] because Elder means uh is the the length
[48:14] of uh office uh serving the lord right
[48:17] is a service to the Lord that's why
[48:19] Elders in the church it's it's how long
[48:21] they they've been serving the lord
[48:23] that's why you you want to ask how did
[48:26] they go through that
[48:27] right oh
[48:29] without knowing right without knowing
[48:33] we are fulfilling or or God is answering
[48:36] our prayers amen so another one is uh if
[48:41] we ask for courage
[48:43] so God will give us dangers to overcome
[48:47] them by depending on him
[48:49] right so the bride is over overcoming
[48:52] power right so sometimes we say we have
[48:56] to be careful on what we pray for
[48:59] right but then the things we need all
[49:00] this the afflictions of the righteous
[49:03] right uh even
[49:05] uh you know God is not the author of
[49:09] confusion right the the footsteps of the
[49:12] righteous are ordered by the Lord so
[49:14] therefore everything that happens to us
[49:17] is for ordained we just don't know but
[49:20] sometimes it's self-inflicted we have to
[49:22] be careful but then the thing is that is
[49:25] a permissive will that will accomplish
[49:26] is perfect will we will go back to the
[49:30] middle which is the which is the word
[49:33] amen and and again we ask to have love
[49:39] I know this is the call for for for
[49:41] today because the Capstone is love
[49:43] that's charity right that's the Capstone
[49:46] of of the pyramid we know that and then
[49:49] if we ask for love what what will God
[49:52] typically gives us
[49:54] he will give us troubles right he will
[49:57] give us the troublemakers whether it's a
[49:59] family or a friend or whoever that we
[50:03] will express love so that so
[50:06] yeah if we can love the unlovable that
[50:09] is the true love which is love which is
[50:12] unconditional love amen so regardless of
[50:15] what's going on that's why this message
[50:17] is full of grace actually
[50:19] we think so much of the the legalism but
[50:24] actually we pass that because the law it
[50:27] will just condemn us that we're sinners
[50:29] but then Paul is saying the law uh Jesus
[50:33] Christ said he didn't he didn't come to
[50:36] uh to what do you call it uh to uh not
[50:40] to follow the law right but to magnify
[50:42] it but magnifying means what to know
[50:45] that we cannot do it by our own
[50:48] right we need the Lord that's why the
[50:51] thing is we are living by grace
[50:53] the Old Testament saints were living by
[50:55] law but then you see they were not
[50:57] ruptured
[50:58] until God until Jesus Christ died on the
[51:02] cross you will see the last person that
[51:04] that accepted him is the the right the
[51:08] one on the cross
[51:10] right that person didn't even get
[51:13] baptized
[51:15] he didn't have any chance
[51:17] right but he was you know the other one
[51:21] is mocking Jesus the other one is uh
[51:23] marking the other one or or rebuking the
[51:25] other one hey we are both Sinners and
[51:29] then we're but him he didn't do anything
[51:32] right but then what did he ask
[51:35] Ed please don't forget me
[51:37] right so what did Jesus say
[51:40] today you will be with me in Paradise so
[51:42] he is the last Old Testament saint
[51:45] that got raptured together with Jesus
[51:48] Christ
[51:49] he didn't he didn't I'm pretty sure he
[51:52] didn't know of justification right
[51:54] because he's a it's a thief I guess
[51:56] right he's a sinner right he didn't know
[52:00] sanctification right justification
[52:03] sanctification baptism of the whole
[52:05] ghost how would he know that being a
[52:08] sinner right but then he accepted Jesus
[52:10] Christ so the only thing
[52:12] there is accepting Jesus Christ
[52:14] personally
[52:16] right regard those those are those uh
[52:21] like uh uh Acts 2 38 right repent and be
[52:25] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:27] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[52:29] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[52:30] but at for his case he didn't have that
[52:33] chance
[52:34] but then the thing is he's the one that
[52:37] need to be accepted because he's there
[52:39] right and he died for all our sins it
[52:43] means he didn't die for the righteous
[52:45] right he died for the Sinners amen so
[52:48] we're so thankful amen that we are at
[52:52] rest regardless of what's going on in
[52:54] our lives we know that he's in control
[52:57] right so if if he's in control we are at
[53:00] rest that's the real rest we labor and
[53:04] to rest meaning
[53:06] uh it's so difficult to be at rest
[53:08] because when we know that we can do
[53:10] something then that's the thing that God
[53:12] will do to us is uh he will he might not
[53:15] hear our prayers because we're doing it
[53:17] by our own he wants us to rely on him
[53:19] completely amen so being at rest means
[53:22] you rely on the word completely
[53:25] right and and he will do it so even
[53:28] Branham is saying the greatest gift is
[53:30] for William Branham to get out of the
[53:33] way
[53:34] right and then and that's the thing he
[53:36] he he can be used completely if he's
[53:38] surrendered amen the bride doesn't have
[53:41] any thought of his of her own it's all
[53:44] gods
[53:45] amen and if we if we think that way then
[53:48] we will not rely on our own
[53:49] understanding right we will not rely on
[53:53] our own thinking our own intellect our
[53:55] own skill amen we think that we can turn
[53:58] the world upside down no we can't right
[54:00] so it's it's the thing and the brightest
[54:02] a different mindset we're focused on the
[54:06] eternal if we will if we would want to
[54:09] achieve anything in this world Brian
[54:11] Branham is saying is Achieve eternal
[54:13] life
[54:15] because all of this will perish anyway
[54:18] amen it's so important amen so you can
[54:22] see here
[54:23] he that happened here let him hear what
[54:26] the spirit said and to the churches
[54:31] you see he didn't say he that has a
[54:33] mouth or a tongue right he that had an
[54:37] ear
[54:38] when you hear
[54:40] it means your
[54:42] taking the input
[54:44] somebody is talking and then you're
[54:46] listening
[54:48] and then of course we have to listen to
[54:50] the voice of God right and how would you
[54:52] know if it is the voice of God it is
[54:53] according to the word
[54:55] amen it's different from the the one
[54:58] when you're talking talking means you're
[54:59] expressing your thought
[55:01] but the bride has not thought of his own
[55:04] right and if we are if we are of course
[55:08] we are all in progress when we talk and
[55:10] it's not according to the word then
[55:11] that's not the the the the thought of
[55:14] God because if we are if we have the
[55:16] mind of Christ then we will talk about
[55:18] the word of God every time we are read
[55:21] uh we are living Epistles red of all man
[55:24] and we know that God will interpret his
[55:27] word by bringing it to pass we might not
[55:30] know that we're fulfilling it already
[55:31] because the thing is when it come to
[55:34] pass that means it's past tense
[55:36] right Branham is saying oh you you must
[55:39] have all of this when he was preaching
[55:42] but he was taken out of the scene in
[55:44] 1965.
[55:45] so what now are we left uh without a
[55:49] messenger no we that that's the reason
[55:52] why we have the prophetic Ministry and
[55:54] there is Ministry of uh Malachi 4
[55:57] Ephesians 4 11 but we're preaching the
[55:59] same thing as what he preached because
[56:01] what he preaches what Paul preached
[56:03] which is the word of God that's why his
[56:06] colleagues go back to the word always
[56:08] amen it's not our own word at all no
[56:12] because the thing is that's why whoever
[56:14] is behind here
[56:16] we'll say the same thing because we have
[56:19] we have common source the Bible and the
[56:21] message it's not our own understanding
[56:24] and not our own might and intellect or
[56:27] whatever right so I I just wanna read a
[56:31] quote here that even even Charles porgin
[56:36] Charles Charles sparjan he said Martin
[56:39] Luther said I have covenanted with my
[56:43] Lord
[56:44] that he should not send me Visions or
[56:47] dreams or even angels
[56:51] I am content with this gift of the
[56:54] scriptures
[56:56] which teaches and supplies all that is
[56:58] necessary
[57:00] both for this life and that which is to
[57:03] come so it means the world is enough
[57:06] we know we need the the the the
[57:09] mechanics and the Dynamics but they are
[57:11] all encompassing the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:14] that is our God right the Lord Jesus
[57:16] Christ is the complete name of God and
[57:18] he is the word
[57:19] right this is not new to everyone right
[57:23] because we're we're preaching to the to
[57:26] Believers here and it's so important for
[57:28] us
[57:29] that we should gather here to hear the
[57:32] word because this is the only place
[57:34] where we put his name on
[57:36] and right now we know the mercy seat is
[57:40] still
[57:41] applicable
[57:43] but then the thing is it's only for the
[57:45] bride
[57:46] why because the seals were already open
[57:48] we know already uh all the mystery which
[57:51] are history now right and it is through
[57:54] the bride right now that's why we are
[57:57] the hope of this generation we always we
[57:59] always say that because Grace can be
[58:02] only extended through the bride right
[58:04] now
[58:05] it's not through the other denominations
[58:08] because the thing is we have the full
[58:10] world already
[58:11] it was given to us it was revealed to us
[58:15] how through the prophet it has been
[58:17] preached here why do we need a prophet
[58:19] why do we believe what we believe right
[58:22] because God or the word comes through
[58:25] Prophets
[58:26] we are not God but God comes through us
[58:29] because we are speaking what the word
[58:31] says amen and there are some written
[58:35] word
[58:36] we we have spoken word but there are
[58:39] also Unwritten word
[58:41] the unwritten word can only be
[58:43] interpreted by the prophet
[58:45] amen and and and we're so glad for us he
[58:49] didn't withhold any information to us
[58:51] that's why we have an open book
[58:54] is are the Seven Seals open yes amen
[58:58] there is no such thing as uh the the
[59:01] seventh seal is not yet open because the
[59:04] thing is the seals is Christ himself
[59:07] right he cannot
[59:09] when he went down with an open book it
[59:12] says right it's just not revealed before
[59:16] the before the seals were open but they
[59:18] are already open when they came down and
[59:20] we believe that that's through the cloud
[59:22] when when when Barbara Branham was
[59:24] caught up
[59:25] amen so we're so thankful that uh we
[59:29] have all those uh
[59:31] we have the word for our day
[59:33] right and and uh with that we are at
[59:37] rest with the word amen and and we can
[59:39] see that the the Holy Spirit we always
[59:43] uh we we hear it because it's important
[59:46] right we need to have the in feeling of
[59:49] the Holy Spirit
[59:51] at the same time we need to be sealed by
[59:53] the Holy Spirit right and we will we
[59:55] will tackle that somehow and then uh
[59:57] just wanna bring a thought here
[1:00:01] uh because pre-seals and post seals uh
[1:00:04] they're they're kind of important
[1:00:05] because God corrected Branham we're not
[1:00:08] the one correcting Branham it's God
[1:00:10] himself who corrected him because he's
[1:00:12] also human beings like you and me amen
[1:00:14] and then uh we can see that uh sometimes
[1:00:17] he will even pre-seals and then after
[1:00:20] the seals were open then he uh he was
[1:00:23] corrected and then uh it's it's
[1:00:25] important that we know those things for
[1:00:28] example uh I will give a
[1:00:33] I I will give a a study a little bit
[1:00:36] here because uh pre-sales regarding New
[1:00:39] Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:41] adoption in pre-sales
[1:00:43] brother Branham is saying these are all
[1:00:46] different so maybe we will I will I will
[1:00:49] read in countdown
[1:00:51] uh in 1962 November 9th he said this is
[1:00:56] pre-sales okay this is uh before 1963.
[1:01:00] he said and the new birth
[1:01:02] as people talks that the baptism of the
[1:01:05] Holy Ghost is the new birth
[1:01:08] now that's wrong so this is random
[1:01:11] speaking okay I'm not trying to to make
[1:01:13] the quotes fight with each other but
[1:01:15] then being human being and then being
[1:01:17] filled with the Holy Ghost he's subject
[1:01:19] to correction by the word it's only the
[1:01:22] word that can correct him amen so he
[1:01:24] said that the new birth
[1:01:27] as people talks that the baptism of the
[1:01:29] Holy Ghost is the new birth now that's
[1:01:31] wrong the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:34] different from the new birth
[1:01:36] the new birth is when you're born again
[1:01:40] okay that's why it's born again so you
[1:01:42] have a new bird but the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:44] when power comes into that word for
[1:01:46] service
[1:01:48] that's exact see the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:50] baptized into the Holy Ghost so so you
[1:01:53] see he's saying it's different so the
[1:01:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:56] different from the New Birth this is in
[1:01:58] countdown you can take note of those uh
[1:02:00] but I can give you the quote later on
[1:02:02] so so you see and then another one is uh
[1:02:06] about uh in question and answers in COD
[1:02:09] 1961 uh January 12. he said the evidence
[1:02:13] that you've got the Holy Ghost is the
[1:02:15] life that you live
[1:02:17] but he corrected that later or we know
[1:02:19] it's the ability to receive the word for
[1:02:21] your day right so buy their fruits you
[1:02:23] shall know them and the fruit of the
[1:02:25] spirit is not nowhere in scripture found
[1:02:27] speaking in tongues the fruit of the
[1:02:29] spirit is love joy Faith long-suffering
[1:02:32] goodness meekness gentleness patience
[1:02:34] see now that is the fruit that's what
[1:02:37] you find on the tree to tell what kind
[1:02:39] of factory it is but but the the fruit
[1:02:42] of the holy spirit is just the product
[1:02:43] of what what you are right but it's not
[1:02:46] the evidence that you have the Holy
[1:02:48] Ghost but then post seals
[1:02:51] okay
[1:02:52] uh in Sumerian Church age we know this
[1:02:55] is grammarista later on and then it was
[1:02:57] out I think in 1965 or something so he
[1:03:01] said here I mean for The Sinner to come
[1:03:04] forward and be born again
[1:03:07] which is to be baptized into the body of
[1:03:10] Christ by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:03:13] exactly what took place at Pentecost
[1:03:16] when the church was launched in other
[1:03:19] words to be born of the spirit or born
[1:03:22] of the holy spirit is to be truly
[1:03:24] baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one
[1:03:27] and the same so you see so we need to
[1:03:30] progress that's why we cannot bring one
[1:03:33] coat and run with it we have to we
[1:03:35] always we have the 1200 plus sermons
[1:03:38] right and we have the cell phone or
[1:03:40] whatever tablet we have we have the
[1:03:44] ability to search that's why it's
[1:03:46] flowing through the bride right now the
[1:03:48] the mercy cities in man right now
[1:03:50] brother Branham is saying it's in the
[1:03:52] heart of man that's why we're the one
[1:03:53] who's giving Mercy to everyone because
[1:03:55] we know the truth
[1:03:57] amen another one in this million Church
[1:03:59] AIDS again
[1:04:01] does he love us oh yes but how shall we
[1:04:04] know we shall know because he said so
[1:04:07] amen and manifested that he did love us
[1:04:10] for he brought us to himself and gave us
[1:04:13] of his Spirit placing us as Sons placing
[1:04:17] is what adoption so it means it's all
[1:04:20] the same what I'm what I'm talking about
[1:04:22] here is a the new birth what is the new
[1:04:26] birth is revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:04:28] personally to you so if he's revealed
[1:04:31] are you not going to be baptized with
[1:04:33] this Holy Spirit if you if he's revealed
[1:04:36] to you personally are you not going to
[1:04:38] be placed or adopted as full Sons heir
[1:04:43] of all the inheritance
[1:04:45] that's why the thing is it's kind of it
[1:04:48] will be a vicious cycle when we think
[1:04:51] that uh we need to be baptized first or
[1:04:54] we need to be born again first and then
[1:04:56] we will receive the the Holy Ghost
[1:04:59] right because it's always a question
[1:05:02] asked that uh
[1:05:05] and and that kind of thinking will will
[1:05:08] lead to two types of people but we're
[1:05:10] not those people okay I'll just mention
[1:05:12] it
[1:05:13] because the thing is if we know that
[1:05:15] these are all the same and it will
[1:05:17] happen because once you're sealed you're
[1:05:19] sealed that's the one we we read
[1:05:21] Ephesians 4 30. we are sealed until when
[1:05:25] the day of our Redemption amen so the
[1:05:29] first type of people that will uh will
[1:05:33] will come out of thinking that these are
[1:05:35] two different things
[1:05:37] those are so-called legalistic or
[1:05:40] self-righteous
[1:05:42] right
[1:05:44] they are blind
[1:05:46] to their own sin who feel that they have
[1:05:48] achieved the proper level of goodness to
[1:05:51] have received the Holy Ghost so it means
[1:05:53] they they they're it's a cobra
[1:05:55] right it's it's like a covering it's a
[1:05:58] religion
[1:05:59] so these are called the self-righteous
[1:06:02] Pharisees
[1:06:03] sometimes the Pharisees you can
[1:06:05] interpret interpret them the the the
[1:06:08] word as far to see
[1:06:10] Pharisee right or the Sadducees they are
[1:06:13] sad to see right so but we're not those
[1:06:16] right they're self-righteous people
[1:06:18] right the other type will be those who
[1:06:21] are always moping around feeling that
[1:06:24] they can never achieve the proper level
[1:06:26] of goodness to be able to believe that
[1:06:29] they have received the Holy Ghost so it
[1:06:31] means we're working on our own self it
[1:06:34] means
[1:06:34] we fail daily right everyone is a sinner
[1:06:38] that's why we backed like daily Paul is
[1:06:40] saying but remember only the Christians
[1:06:43] only through Christians backslide
[1:06:46] right because when you're a sinner and
[1:06:48] then you're already condemned then
[1:06:49] you're already out of the of the race
[1:06:51] right but then we're not
[1:06:53] we don't have that right to put in or
[1:06:56] out anyone right that's why Grace is
[1:06:58] flowing through the bride right now amen
[1:07:01] and we're so happy that the seals were
[1:07:04] opened and and God used the prophet who
[1:07:07] showing that he can make mistakes like
[1:07:10] you and me because even the prophet of
[1:07:13] old prophets of old they also made
[1:07:15] mistakes
[1:07:16] right so the thing is but when he says
[1:07:19] that said the Lord and uh it it came
[1:07:21] from the Lord and and how can we know
[1:07:23] that that's the truth it will be
[1:07:26] fulfilled amen it will be manifested
[1:07:29] amen and we're so glad that uh
[1:07:33] we have that ability
[1:07:36] to receive the word for this day
[1:07:38] and that's the evidence that we have the
[1:07:40] holy spirit amen because the thing is we
[1:07:42] cannot have the the uh the word of Moses
[1:07:46] to work in this day amen word of Noah so
[1:07:51] it's the word of our Vindicated prophet
[1:07:55] right that
[1:07:57] had thousands of visions that came to
[1:08:01] pass and we know some are not yet
[1:08:03] fulfilled but they will be fulfilled
[1:08:05] fulfilled means that's the proof that
[1:08:07] they that the word is true once they are
[1:08:10] fulfilled and for us we're fulfilling
[1:08:12] prophecies without even knowing it
[1:08:15] right how do we know that we're
[1:08:17] fulfilling prophecies because we walk
[1:08:19] it's automatic life for us but we're in
[1:08:22] progress right preaching to myself I'm
[1:08:25] the worst of all worse so I will accept
[1:08:28] that then but the thing is accepting
[1:08:31] that you're a sinner is the key
[1:08:32] right it's just like complex when you
[1:08:34] know that there's an issue once you
[1:08:37] identify that you have a complex 50 is
[1:08:39] solved
[1:08:41] right but if you don't know that you
[1:08:42] have a complex then you think that
[1:08:44] you're doing right but then you have
[1:08:45] already an issue
[1:08:47] right but then it's the thing that that
[1:08:50] discernment is very important that you
[1:08:52] you really have the the issue and that's
[1:08:55] why we need the Lord to change us right
[1:08:58] even repentance what is repentance
[1:09:00] repentance is so important is the desire
[1:09:03] to change
[1:09:04] you don't want to go back to where you
[1:09:07] came from and although it's difficult
[1:09:08] because of this flesh but you have the
[1:09:10] desire to change amen that's that's what
[1:09:14] you call complete repentance
[1:09:16] amen and uh we're so glad that we we are
[1:09:19] taught very well by by the prophet and
[1:09:21] uh
[1:09:22] we don't need to worry
[1:09:24] being bright that's why we are at rest
[1:09:26] because of his word his promises will be
[1:09:29] fulfilled amen it's so good that uh
[1:09:33] the life of God will be just expressed
[1:09:36] automatically
[1:09:37] but we need to feed
[1:09:39] we need to be in service we need to be
[1:09:42] to not forsake the assembling
[1:09:44] as we see that they approaching amen
[1:09:47] it's very important that's why you can
[1:09:48] see even even with our
[1:09:51] uh chat group when one is sick everyone
[1:09:54] will be praying that's the importance of
[1:09:56] being in the body when one is sick then
[1:09:59] everyone is hurting also right so it's
[1:10:01] so important and and it doesn't matter
[1:10:04] who's preaching here as long as he's
[1:10:06] preaching the word and we know we need
[1:10:07] to be immersed with the word every time
[1:10:09] all of us we have all our part
[1:10:12] amen and and we are called to do so
[1:10:15] wherever we go right so so that's why we
[1:10:19] are walking a piece else ahead of all
[1:10:20] men it will just automatically
[1:10:23] we'll see brother uh they will see
[1:10:26] brother Gilbert even though he was he
[1:10:28] was just standing on the on the bus
[1:10:30] station there and then the person there
[1:10:32] I know you're a man of God how did he
[1:10:35] know he didn't even talk to him right
[1:10:36] because of the how we conduct ourselves
[1:10:38] Lord help us amen we don't want to
[1:10:41] misrepresent the Lord wherever we go
[1:10:43] even on simple things on sing small
[1:10:46] things because small things matter
[1:10:49] amen because those will be accumulated
[1:10:51] and become big things and how can God
[1:10:54] you know uh trust us in uh big things if
[1:10:57] if small things he cannot trust us
[1:10:59] that's why working around forgive me
[1:11:02] Lord I don't want to work around on
[1:11:03] anything even simple thing
[1:11:05] amen we that's our sincere disciple
[1:11:08] because perfection
[1:11:10] is removing all the small small items
[1:11:13] there because we have all we can see the
[1:11:16] full picture but then still we still
[1:11:18] have impurities we still have all those
[1:11:20] extra uh you you can say if you have a
[1:11:23] drawing of of a man then you need to
[1:11:26] erase some of those imperfections so
[1:11:28] that it will become perfect it's just
[1:11:30] like the gold right you need to beat it
[1:11:32] up until you will remove all the
[1:11:34] impurities until you will see the your
[1:11:36] image which is the image of God Amen
[1:11:39] it's the it's the same and that can only
[1:11:42] happen if we have the word for our day
[1:11:43] amen
[1:11:44] so I don't want to uh
[1:11:48] tackle a lot of things uh today but then
[1:11:51] the thing is uh the important thing is
[1:11:54] I'll just read some of the quotes here
[1:11:58] you can see
[1:12:01] that happen here
[1:12:03] an ear
[1:12:05] let him hear what the spirit of the Lord
[1:12:07] says to the churches right he
[1:12:11] it says it's singular
[1:12:14] right that's why there's only one
[1:12:16] messenger for every age
[1:12:18] that Messenger will hear what the spirit
[1:12:21] of the Lord is saying at that age for
[1:12:23] that age let's tackle about our age
[1:12:26] right now this is an AIDS although we we
[1:12:29] move up with the bride AIDS but then our
[1:12:31] messenger is Barbara Branham no doubt
[1:12:33] and then he is the one who had the ear
[1:12:36] to hear but then the thing is what what
[1:12:38] happens to that messenger is he will
[1:12:41] broadcast what he heard
[1:12:43] to the people that will receive
[1:12:45] but who can receive
[1:12:48] what the spirit said is only for those
[1:12:51] specific people
[1:12:52] that's why
[1:12:54] for us we're so special that we can hear
[1:12:57] anything that Branham is saying is good
[1:12:59] for us
[1:13:01] he will not let us go astray or you know
[1:13:04] all the instructions that is required
[1:13:06] for Rapture because this message is for
[1:13:08] Rapture right because the other six ages
[1:13:11] they were not ruptured they're waiting
[1:13:13] for us to be perfected right so this
[1:13:16] this age is for full
[1:13:18] word not partial word the the previous
[1:13:22] ones
[1:13:23] they didn't receive the full word but
[1:13:25] for us we were given the full word so I
[1:13:28] will read this now we have this is still
[1:13:31] in uh Sumerian Church age now we have
[1:13:33] been constantly saying that the true
[1:13:36] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost is for the believer to receive the
[1:13:41] word for the AIDS in which he lives
[1:13:44] let me show you most clearly he said The
[1:13:46] Seven Ages are set forth in Revelations
[1:13:49] chapter 2 and 3 taking the whole span of
[1:13:52] the fullness of the Gentiles
[1:13:54] or the whole time in which God is
[1:13:56] dealing with the Gentiles and to
[1:13:58] Salvation in every single age Bar None
[1:14:01] it says the very same thing in opening
[1:14:04] and closing the message to it to its age
[1:14:07] what is that and to the messenger of
[1:14:10] Ephesus
[1:14:13] Philadelphia right this thing said he
[1:14:18] etc etc he that happened here let him
[1:14:21] let him singular
[1:14:22] hear what the spirit said to the
[1:14:25] churches okay notice here that Jesus
[1:14:29] by the spirit in every age
[1:14:32] addresses himself to only one person
[1:14:36] relative to the word for that age only
[1:14:39] one messenger for each age receives what
[1:14:43] the spirit has to say to that age
[1:14:45] and the one that one messenger is the
[1:14:49] messenger to the true church
[1:14:51] and it's that is capital c we are the
[1:14:54] true church amen we are the uh you can
[1:14:56] say the the the true church which is the
[1:15:00] bride church he speaks for God by
[1:15:03] Revelation to the churches but true and
[1:15:06] false
[1:15:07] the message is then broadcast to all
[1:15:10] okay but though it is broadcast for all
[1:15:13] who come within Reigns of the message
[1:15:16] that message is received individually by
[1:15:20] only a certain qualified group in a
[1:15:23] certain way or we thank the lord we
[1:15:25] receive it amen each individual of that
[1:15:28] group is one who has the ability to hear
[1:15:32] what the spirit is saying by way of the
[1:15:35] messenger
[1:15:37] those who hear
[1:15:38] are not getting their own private
[1:15:41] revelation
[1:15:42] amen we cannot interpret the message by
[1:15:44] our own right nor is a group getting
[1:15:47] their Collective Revelation it's not by
[1:15:49] our own group we God deals with us
[1:15:51] individually amen but each person is
[1:15:55] hearing and receiving what the messenger
[1:15:59] has already received from God that's why
[1:16:01] we cannot preach other messages amen
[1:16:04] because even in Galatians 1 8 right
[1:16:06] though we are an angel from heaven
[1:16:08] preaching the gospel then that we have
[1:16:10] preached unto you let him be accursed
[1:16:12] because that one is that said the Lord
[1:16:15] amen
[1:16:17] he always give us the the real
[1:16:20] interpretation because he's a prophet
[1:16:23] by birth right it's a Vindicated Prophet
[1:16:26] because all the Visions all the
[1:16:28] prophecies uh most uh some will be
[1:16:31] fulfilled Amen in the future but uh he
[1:16:34] had a lot of them and it's all he's a
[1:16:38] Vindicated Prophet that's why we're here
[1:16:40] we believe the message of the hour
[1:16:41] otherwise we will just be yeah moping
[1:16:44] around and you know uh will be drag
[1:16:47] pillar to pose or whatever but then the
[1:16:50] thing is we have the anchor which is the
[1:16:52] message and the message will bring us
[1:16:53] back to the word amen very very
[1:16:56] important amen
[1:16:58] so now just just to continue here now
[1:17:01] think it not strange that this is the
[1:17:03] case
[1:17:05] for Paul said this pattern
[1:17:08] under the hand of God Paul alone had the
[1:17:11] full Revelation for his day as evidenced
[1:17:14] by his confrontation of the other
[1:17:16] apostles who admitted that Paul was the
[1:17:18] prophet Messenger to the Gentiles for
[1:17:20] that day no one can dispute that he's
[1:17:23] the messenger for the Gentiles right
[1:17:25] even the even the apostles knew that uh
[1:17:28] because uh the the Jews left the left
[1:17:32] the world so we Lo we turn to the
[1:17:35] Gentiles that's what Paul said right so
[1:17:38] he's the prophet Messenger to the
[1:17:40] Gentiles for that day and also note by
[1:17:43] actually illustration in the word that
[1:17:45] when Paul decided to go to Asia God
[1:17:48] forbade him
[1:17:50] for for the ship his children were in
[1:17:53] Macedonia and and the macedonians would
[1:17:57] hear what the spirit had to say through
[1:17:59] Paul while the people in Asia would not
[1:18:00] so it means
[1:18:02] in in this case it's geographical
[1:18:04] location those who are in Macedonia will
[1:18:07] hear what Paul will say but not in Asia
[1:18:09] so for us we had a Vindicated Prophet
[1:18:12] from America we are here in North
[1:18:15] America right and we heard it although
[1:18:17] it this message is not only for for
[1:18:19] North America anyway that's why it's uh
[1:18:22] Briar Branham went all over the world
[1:18:24] seven times so that this will be
[1:18:26] preached but this will only be received
[1:18:29] by who the elect amen and then elect
[1:18:32] means you're predestinated you're for
[1:18:35] ordained to receive it whether you like
[1:18:38] it or not amen and it isn't that good
[1:18:41] amen that whether you like it or not
[1:18:43] even though you think that uh you can do
[1:18:45] something but then God will not allow
[1:18:47] you right that's why all those prayers
[1:18:49] that we think that oh God is not hearing
[1:18:52] my prayers but actually he hears
[1:18:54] amen and we don't even need to worry why
[1:18:58] uh why we think it's not answer or a
[1:19:01] prayer will not be answered but actually
[1:19:03] it is answered it's always for maturity
[1:19:06] means our character is being built
[1:19:08] through those afflictions amen and we
[1:19:11] are at rest
[1:19:13] amen when we have the when we know that
[1:19:15] the word is fulfilled through US amen
[1:19:21] God is good amen are we good
[1:19:25] yeah I will I will close soon so that
[1:19:29] everyone will wake up
[1:19:30] [Laughter]
[1:19:32] uh
[1:19:33] I know we're not sleeping but uh it's
[1:19:37] just repeating what others are saying in
[1:19:40] closing they will say right and they're
[1:19:41] all nice it's it's short all right so I
[1:19:45] have some
[1:19:46] a little bit of a
[1:19:48] illustration later on here but I will
[1:19:51] explain it and end it with that one
[1:19:53] it will be a little bit different you
[1:19:56] might have seen this but I will explain
[1:19:58] it in a
[1:20:00] in a
[1:20:02] in a way that will uh
[1:20:06] will be easily understood even by the
[1:20:10] younger
[1:20:12] younger ones we are one school one room
[1:20:15] Schoolhouse right so
[1:20:18] so if if we check on this I know
[1:20:23] our topic our topic today by the way is
[1:20:26] uh yeah the bride is at rest with the
[1:20:29] word and we know
[1:20:31] we know uh when we have the word we
[1:20:34] it just proves that we have the
[1:20:38] uh we have the Holy Ghost if we have the
[1:20:40] ability to receive the word
[1:20:42] right and and the word uh
[1:20:45] the word it means receive the word for
[1:20:48] our day right so uh because unbelief
[1:20:52] or or the original sin is unbelief in
[1:20:55] the word of God so if you don't believe
[1:20:56] the word you are sinning right but we
[1:21:00] are given the the the ability to receive
[1:21:03] it through the through the prophet of
[1:21:05] this age that's why we're not see we are
[1:21:08] declared righteous
[1:21:10] because of that right so if you see
[1:21:13] for example I put two so that I can do
[1:21:16] it two times so if you can see these are
[1:21:19] exactly the same
[1:21:21] right if if from far you will not see a
[1:21:25] difference right
[1:21:27] so there
[1:21:28] ginger ale
[1:21:30] and this this is aluminum can aluminum
[1:21:35] can
[1:21:36] right but from fire you won't see
[1:21:39] but there is a difference
[1:21:41] right I will be here one is empty and
[1:21:46] open
[1:21:47] one is
[1:21:50] full and sealed
[1:21:52] they're saying like a Proverbs I I
[1:21:54] cannot find it in the Bible but they
[1:21:55] said that if you are empty you're noisy
[1:22:01] it's more maybe as compared to the one
[1:22:03] that uh
[1:22:04] so it means you uh or or or maybe in a
[1:22:08] different way when when uh
[1:22:11] when a body of water is deep it's calm
[1:22:14] but those who are shallower noisy right
[1:22:17] but then that's one but then with this
[1:22:22] uh when it comes to being filled and
[1:22:25] sealed
[1:22:26] I just want to show you that uh this one
[1:22:28] is empty
[1:22:30] right this one is full
[1:22:32] so now if I will do a little bit of a
[1:22:35] demonstration
[1:22:38] okay you can see it
[1:22:40] so this is empty okay so I will step on
[1:22:44] it
[1:22:45] so what happened
[1:22:47] so it just crashed
[1:22:51] I'll try the one with the seal and with
[1:22:54] filled and seal let's see I hope it will
[1:22:57] not I hope I'm not that heavy
[1:23:01] okay
[1:23:03] oh wow
[1:23:05] so what did you get from there
[1:23:08] the thing is
[1:23:10] these are exactly the same vessels
[1:23:14] but one is empty and open
[1:23:17] the other one
[1:23:18] is filled and sealed
[1:23:22] so the one that I did
[1:23:25] think of those
[1:23:27] or think of that action as
[1:23:30] Trials of life
[1:23:32] right afflictions uh all the problems
[1:23:36] and everything so what will happen if
[1:23:38] you're not filled and sealed you will be
[1:23:40] crushed
[1:23:41] but if you are filled and sealed
[1:23:46] and we know that what fills us and seals
[1:23:49] us is the Holy Ghost then we can
[1:23:51] withstand all those trials and
[1:23:54] sufferings
[1:23:55] so what do we need to do brothers and
[1:23:57] sisters
[1:23:58] we need to be filled and sealed allow
[1:24:01] the Lord to fill us and seal us so that
[1:24:05] we can whatever Trials of this life will
[1:24:09] you know we encounter we know that we
[1:24:12] can reach the destination we will
[1:24:14] withstand
[1:24:15] amen so it's very important to be filled
[1:24:19] and sealed with the holy spirit amen
[1:24:22] oh I hope that's one so we can repeat
[1:24:25] this one but later on we can drink this
[1:24:27] so
[1:24:28] again right so coke same vessel but this
[1:24:32] time it's different colors so we know
[1:24:34] the Lord is uh uh you know he can use
[1:24:37] any vessel right it's the same thing
[1:24:39] right so I will do it again
[1:24:43] ah okay
[1:24:46] so this is crushed so again this one is
[1:24:49] sealed okay this is good to its
[1:24:52] destination it means that's why it
[1:24:53] reaches us and then we can buy it right
[1:24:56] so it's a it's a it's a product
[1:24:58] amen so
[1:25:01] see it's strong right because it's
[1:25:03] filled and sealed so we need that
[1:25:05] brothers and sisters we can only do that
[1:25:08] though if we allow God to fill us and
[1:25:10] seal us amen so I hope that's uh it's
[1:25:15] it's a very good illustration to see
[1:25:17] that uh
[1:25:18] not the holy spirit because you are
[1:25:21] sealed
[1:25:23] until the day of what of our Redemption
[1:25:26] so no matter what trial will come we
[1:25:30] will overcome
[1:25:31] because you are filled and sealed with
[1:25:33] the holy spirit amen and that's why it's
[1:25:36] so important to understand that this
[1:25:38] word will bring Perfection will bring us
[1:25:42] to the Rapture will bring us to maturity
[1:25:45] it will bake our greenness our
[1:25:49] immaturity amen it's very important I'll
[1:25:51] call the musician so that we'll take a
[1:25:54] lot of time
[1:25:55] but later on we'll uh we'll have more
[1:25:57] presentations better but what what am I
[1:26:01] trying to say here it's very important
[1:26:02] that we know our position again again
[1:26:05] brothers and sisters all the preaching
[1:26:08] here is all about maturity being in
[1:26:10] position because we know when you're not
[1:26:11] in position God cannot work
[1:26:14] it's so important for us to know our
[1:26:16] positions it doesn't mean that one is
[1:26:19] not doing his position you will be
[1:26:20] affected although it's a change effect
[1:26:22] right but then the thing is it's between
[1:26:24] our personal relationship with the Lord
[1:26:27] Jesus Christ even the husband is not
[1:26:29] doing his part the wife should do his
[1:26:31] her part right if if the wife is not
[1:26:33] doing her the husband should do their
[1:26:35] part same for the for the children we
[1:26:37] cannot blame somebody else because it's
[1:26:39] a personal revelation personal
[1:26:41] relationship to Christ although we are
[1:26:43] we We Are all uh in one unit right it's
[1:26:49] like a chain right
[1:26:51] but but we need to have Grace on each
[1:26:54] other we need to help each other
[1:26:55] brothers and sisters that's why we we
[1:26:57] must belong to a body or Believers
[1:27:00] wherever you are it's so important and
[1:27:02] what more we're bringing the word the
[1:27:04] full word we're not even denominational
[1:27:07] uh uh uh uh you know we're not even in
[1:27:11] denomination we are the full Perfect
[1:27:13] Bride word of Jesus Christ
[1:27:16] we're so thankful brothers and sisters
[1:27:18] uh if we can just understand who we are
[1:27:21] then you will be at rest
[1:27:24] you will be at rest no matter what we we
[1:27:28] might think of okay oh it's good for
[1:27:32] for my children and children's children
[1:27:34] to to have a lot of things no we should
[1:27:37] just enjoy the fruit of our labor here
[1:27:39] because in the end it will be their own
[1:27:41] lives as well and then for us it's uh
[1:27:43] we're aiming for for the eternal life
[1:27:46] not not to to acquire all the things
[1:27:48] here but you know it's not bad to be you
[1:27:52] know living in a good life here because
[1:27:53] of your the fruit of your labor right
[1:27:56] because Abraham is was rich right uh
[1:27:59] even job but then the thing is that's
[1:28:01] not the point the point there is we must
[1:28:04] know our Focus we must focus on the
[1:28:06] things that are eternal
[1:28:08] and it's so important brothers and
[1:28:10] sisters to be really you know uh in a
[1:28:13] body where where somebody can pray for
[1:28:15] you because uh
[1:28:17] every every prayer counts
[1:28:20] amen and then it's so important that's
[1:28:24] that's the real love for for a Believer
[1:28:26] is to to live for others basically right
[1:28:29] Eternal eternal life is living for
[1:28:31] others it means we must start that while
[1:28:34] we are still living here on Earth we
[1:28:36] cannot wait for millennium to do that
[1:28:37] because there's no point anymore that's
[1:28:39] why we need to help each other here and
[1:28:42] uh you know be
[1:28:44] be subjected to the word that we receive
[1:28:47] for the day amen we're so glad that we
[1:28:50] have all those uh nuggets I know it's
[1:28:53] very short and
[1:28:54] hopefully it was a little bit uh
[1:28:57] encouraging
[1:28:59] that we know every word will be
[1:29:02] fulfilled amen and we can rely on that
[1:29:05] amen and uh remember once you are filled
[1:29:08] and sealed you can storm the weather
[1:29:12] right we know that that one cities
[1:29:14] inspected it will go to its destination
[1:29:16] which is what Redemption right that's
[1:29:18] why the inspector will check whether
[1:29:20] there's a loose end or whatever there
[1:29:23] for us once we are filled and sealed we
[1:29:25] will reach Redemption we will be
[1:29:27] redeemed because we belong to him
[1:29:29] Redemption means paying for what is
[1:29:32] yours
[1:29:33] you cannot redeem something that is not
[1:29:35] yours right it has been explained before
[1:29:38] amen if you if you point a watch only
[1:29:41] the owner can you know pay pay back and
[1:29:45] and take it back right if it if it's not
[1:29:47] yours then they will not even allow you
[1:29:49] to to redeem it and we belong to God
[1:29:52] because we were in him before the
[1:29:55] foundation of the world Amen there's so
[1:29:57] many
[1:29:57] many things oh for this message that's
[1:30:00] why never ending preaching in uh with
[1:30:03] the 1200 messages you will see it it's
[1:30:07] very rich
[1:30:08] right but the important thing the
[1:30:10] Capstone let's not forget that the love
[1:30:13] for one another amen how would you know
[1:30:16] that you love me you love you have love
[1:30:18] for one another amen so so important
[1:30:20] brothers and sisters we were given the
[1:30:22] instruction and we don't need to worry
[1:30:25] so much we will be at rest when we know
[1:30:28] that uh his word will be fulfilled amen

[1:34:18] Lord Jesus when where you have showed us
[1:34:21] Lord until we reach our final maturity
[1:34:23] unleash
[1:34:25] when you remove all the immaturity in us
