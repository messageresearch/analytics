Lord we love you and we thank you for your goodness and your mercy to each and every one of us we just ask that you'd be glorified now with the rest of this service father For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen we have so many testimonies from even just this last week I'm not going to get into them tonight because I believe the individuals have those testimonies and we want them to have the opportunity thank you musicians if you have your Bibles tonight would just like to read from uh two places in the scripture just a little bit of a different direction for the same thing but uh let's turn to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and then Hebrews the book of [Music] Hebrews 13 Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse4 it says I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him yes that which hath been done is now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is passed there's nothing hidden from God Hebrews 138 very familiar scripture I just thought it might be good to turn there just to turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus Hebrews 138 very simple scripture but probably the Keystone of the Bible brother brandham says and we'll get into that tonight Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever let's just bow one more time heaven Heavenly Father we're so thankful that you are unchanging Lord Jesus that everything around us will change that heavens and earth will even pass away father but your word and you will not change father you will remain we just want to commit the words that are spoken tonight into your hands father that you would speak the words you AR spoken and that you would stop the words that you don't and that father when we leave here tonight we would say truly we know that we met with you we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just a reminder of the uh announcements we have a prayer meeting tomorrow evening at 7:30 um we will be traveling this week we leave Friday and then we come back again on Saturday um the following week and uh we have brother John parizot coming down to take the service here in Calgary on Sunday and I think it's just going to be a wonderful opportunity I've had the desire to have some of the brothers from Edmonton to come here for years now and uh I just thought it would be the time so I felt led to do that and uh so we're going to have brother John perzo here I'm really actually kind of disappointed because I wanted to be here for that and I'm sure I could have orchestrated it a little better but we trust the Lord and uh we'll pick up the streaming on our 7-hour journey um on the high way so uh we have brother John parizot coming here this Sunday and uh then we have brother Toby who's going to take the service next Wednesday and then we have the Youth Event coming up on the 25th after service it will be at our house and then on the 29th we have the annual General men's meeting at the church here at 7:30 p.m. are you happy tonight amen tonight I want to get into the next portion of the exposition of the seven Church ages and I'm I I just can't help but get more and more excited about this as we get into it it's just seems to do something to me anyway I trust it's the same for you but you know we're going to get into the Ephesian Church age this is where we actually start to get into the church ages but even still even so uh brother Bram he doesn't really get into the Ephesian Church age right away but what he does is an introduction to the church ages and you know even before we do that I I would just like to do something maybe a little unorthodox and go right to the very end of this book before we get into the church ages because I I feel like we could look at this if if someone is listening or someone is streaming and you know they would say Well they're just reading a book that this man uh sent from God or this man they call the prophet or whatever we want to call it um we could say that perhaps we're just listening to what this man has to say and he's got some new doctrine and I just I just love the way he closes this book and I think that many times it's too bad you have to read the whole book before you actually get to this paragraph so I'm probably going to refer to this paragraph a lot as we go through this because I believe it's so important it's important for us to recognize what this man if we say it that way the prophet of God the dispensational prophet is actually saying to this generation and you know paragraph 75 the last page in the book and it's the resume of the ages is is the [Music] chapter he says not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now now which cult leader out there or false prophet would be saying words like this I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men amen wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him amen even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart amen hallelujah what a tremendous paragraph I think that is it's so important for us to recognize this was his desire this was what he was doing was encouraging people to Christ so brothers and sisters I I I think I said it before but it was just on my heart and I'm going to say it again we need to make sure all of the things that we call our message beliefs they line up with the message of the hour they line up with what this man said because many times we can have little isms that come around and we begin to practice them and we'll say well it's part of the message well I want to say is it we've got to be able to take it back to the word we got to take it back to the word of God and back to the message of the hour and if we can't take it back there and find it there then I believe the prophet of God said himself just leave it alone but you know what it takes is pride we've got to kill that Pride many times we've got Traditions that are in the way of the word of God we don't want anything to be in the way of the word of God it can't be if we have anything there we talked about a little while ago it's idolatry anything that comes before God whether it's our Traditions whether it's our thinking we can say we've always done it this way and God's given us good results if it's not according to the word of God it doesn't matter if it's given you good results because you're not going to see his coming and that's the objective here isn't it to see his coming it has to be the objective not to be good people not to just live good Christian lives but to actually see the change of our bodies so for anyone who might be concerned that maybe this man that we're talking about this whole book has an objective to get people all brainwashed and and all weird the only thing that these people do that's different is is to Simply follow the word of God now some here in person tonight might be wondering why on Earth am I saying it like this I want to be very clear I I I understand there's some people that I know that are actually looking us up now they're watching it on YouTube I had a conversation this week and it's part of testimonies testimony service is coming up but you know what there's people that are watching this so I'm going to talk about this so they might understand it we need to know that we're not following a man we're following the Lord Jesus Christ but just like anything and just like any church just like any church group that's ever gone around and gotten close to the Lord what's happened is there charlatans there's people that spin off there's people that have ulterior motives we know the word of God says to to beware that that there's ravening wolves have entered into the flock men they come in dressed as sheep right but they're raving wolves on the inside we need to make sure that that's actually not what's going on and there's only one way we can do that and that's by the word of God but if we don't know what the word of God says then how would we ever know if one's right or wrong that's why it's important to read our Bibles tonight we're going to start the Ephesian Church age it's chapter three of the exposition of the seven Church ages and uh I just think it's absolutely beautiful I think though myself I could just continue preaching from the uh you know the first two chapters that we went through here it's just been so good and I know there's so many nuggets in there that really we didn't cover and uh I know I read past you can't really dwell on all of it so long but you know the revelation of Jesus Christ is what it's all about brothers and sisters it is the New Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ him making himself known personally to the individual and then the patmas vision and all of the different things getting in the spirit recognizing that you know we we we can't just be Christian people and not act like human beings because human beings get right into the spirit of things amen hallelujah that's what they do but uh anyways we're carrying on with the Ephesian Church age tonight is chapter three and an introduction to the church ages brother brandom takes the time to just introduce that the church ages is something that's actually coming to pass that there is an actual description of the seven Church ages and here we have the introduction to the church ages before he actually officially gets into the Ephesian Church age paragraph one of this chapter it says in order for you to fully understand the message of the church ages I would like to explain the various principles that allowed me to arrive at the names of The Messengers the length of the ages and the other factors involved therein now I'm just going to jump out of there for a second I just want to make a note of this right at the beginning of this book I'm not sure if the blue one has this does anybody know if the blue one has this right at the beginning it shows The Messengers and it actually shows the duration of the age these books here they have it the Ephesian Church age was the Apostle Paul this is the conclusion that he came to he's got a key to it and we'll explain that as we go but I just want to just want to lay this out here I thought it would be really good to talk about the Ephesian Church age was from 53 ad to 170 ad and it was the Apostle Paul the saman church age was from ad. 170 to 312 ad and that messenger one of the these are the seven stars that were in his right hand first was the Apostle Paul second was irus of Gul then there was the perian church age 312 to 606 Martin of Tours the thyrian age is 606 to 1512 Columba of Ireland the sardian church age 1512 to 1750 Martin Luther the Philadelphian Church age 1750 to 1906 John Wesley then the leoan church age from 1906 to who knows some people have some scenarios and I I i' I've I've been intrigued to hear it because we know that some people have taken what was spoken by this man and said it was 1977 other people would say it's till 1963 when the seals were open other people would come up with their own theories and say different things but you know I would say God's still calling we know that there's a blending of the ages they always blend there's not a hard start and stop there's always a blending we know that these men crossed over there was one man alive while the other one was still in his position in his office it wasn't as though God just left the church vacant and void but who knows um I think it's beautiful if you listen to what brother Bram says he never says that I'm the messenger I've come to bring the message to you it's not the way it works but we know in this book it says the leoan church age from 1906 until is William Bram and he lived from 1909 to 1965 and and could it be that the church age ended there I don't know while he was still here we know very well you've heard me harp on it quite a bit that we're living in the bride age is what he said very clearly it it has actually shifted into the bride age and we know that the great revivals are over they rejected God they choose to reject chose to re reject God in in 1956 57 58 they took God out of America and what happened all the Devils they could just creep in because they took God out they kicked God out and what they did was actually paved the way rolled out the red carpet and said welcome Satan you can just take over over now and we know that uh we have spiritual wickedness at the highest places in the US in Canada everywhere you go in the world we know that uh all civilization is of the devil because this is not the way God created mankind to live in order for you to fully understand the message of the church ages I would like to explain the various principles that allowed me to arrive at the names of The Messengers the length of the ages and other factors involved therein since the study was to be the most serious one I had ever undertaken up to this time I sought God for many days for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit then only did I read the scriptures on the church ages and delve into the many Church histories written by the most unbiased historians that I could find God did not fail to answer my prayer for while I read the word and the histories I was enabled by by the Holy Spirit to see unfolded a pattern that runs through the centuries and right into this present last day as I read that I know I can feel skepticism in my own mind naturally speaking and I'm not saying that I I don't believe this but just thinking about this if I was to look at it objectively from someone who maybe has never heard about the message of the hour to hear a man talk like that is pretty out there isn't it it can be a little bit much to think that you know man has a direct relationship with God but you know what that's the intent is that man would have that relationship with God and not just a man that would be potentially a prophet or maybe a pastor or an evangelist so that every single man could have that relationship with God because that's where we're going but here he has the uh you know sort of the the the the brass tax of it paragraph three the key given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one isn't that beautiful he's not saying I've got my own version I've got my own idea first it's the leadership of the Holy Ghost and then it's going to actually go right back to the word it's not just someone's ideas that's coming from some alien Source somewhere out there some some place somewhere this is actually exactly what we read earlier in in the scripture right it's got to be a revelation revealed by the spirit but then confirmed by the word but then what happens it's got to be manifest it has to have results that are born in in its life so he says the key given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible I have that highlighted here the Keystone of the Bible it is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is and we know the Antichrist Spirit has crept into the framework of the Christian church and caused it to become lukewarm formal and Powerless and we know the leoan church age why is that because theed leoan church is Rich it's increased with goods and it has need of nothing don't need God we can look after ourselves we're educated people we're smart we've got everything going for us we're the masters of our destiny that's this age that we live in and if we're not careful even Believers of this message we can get caught up in that Doctrine the only way we won't is by his Spirit brothers and sisters by having the Holy Ghost In Our Lives if we resist getting the Holy Ghost in our lives that world Doctrine will just take us over there's no way that we can prevent it the Keystone of the Bible is that the revelation of God never changes and his ways are as unchangeable as he is and this takes us to our scripture reading tonight out of Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we know the prophet of God what he taught so many times was people go and put them out there somewhere out in the future they'll look back and see what he did in the lives of the others and ignore what he's doing right now and what's he doing right now he's on the outside of the door knocking to get in and all we've got to do is open the door and let them in you know I was having a conversation with someone this week part of testimonies but how there's doors there's doors and and unless we're willing to open all the doors for him he's still going to be knocking we could open the front door of our house and say come on in come on in no problem but he's going to knock on every single door in that house and see if we'll open it for him or see if there's something we're hiding see if there's something we're just not willing to deal with see if there's something we're not willing to give over to him because he wants it all he's not going to actually just settle for standing in the foyer of our house the next part of this is is the other scripture that we read out of Ecclesiastes I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him remember he's the same yesterday tonight and forever that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already being and God requireth that which is PED it's just amazing it just makes our brains makes my brain uh stutter when I think about it because there's no past and there's no future it's only present with God isn't it all of it it's just present he's already been in our future and he's already been in our past but right now he is right here and he's just wondering what we're going to do with the word that we get tonight you know the next paragra 4 it says here it is an unchanging God with unchanging ways when you think about that imagine if we had to deal with a changing god with changing ways if we had to deal with a changing husband with changing ways and and and you know what that's the Paradox as people young people don't realize this I know I never did the the girl that I married the bride that I married I didn't realize that she was going to change had an idea that she would be the same forever and I was in love and I still am happy Valentine's Day darling but you know unless we realize as human beings everything that we know on Earth is going to change the people that we know are going to change the people that know us need to recognize that we're going to change but we have a God we have a god that is unchanging in his ways and his his nature brothers and sisters his word is his absolute and he cannot change one ioda from his word it's so beautiful an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's Ministry would be the example for all the other ages what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all of the other Church ages and we know that Paul is the first church age messenger we'll get into it a little bit I always Jump Ahead a bit but we know that Paul was the first church age messenger chosen by God and we know that he was chosen to go to the Gentiles because the Jews wouldn't receive him and we know that the church ages are all about the Gentiles they're not about the Jews the seven Church age Messengers are all to the all the Gentile Ministry we'll get into that that's what he wants to do in all their ages paragraph five now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the first or original church was founded and how God manifested himself in her not to her in her the word can't change or be changed because it's the word of God John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God to change one word of it as did Eve brings sin and death even as it says in Revelations 22:18 to19 If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the word words of this book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book we don't want to do that we don't want to add to it or take away from it and that's what I'm saying brothers and sisters when we when we when we examine Our Lives we need to know that the life that we're living isn't adding to the message of the hour it's not adding to the word of God and we need to know that the way we're living the Traditions that we have in our lives they're not taken away from the message of the hour or taken away from the word of God because if they are then this scripture applies and our position is going to be sitting in the throne with him judging Angels it's not going to be standing before that Throne that's not our calling paragraph s thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard going back to what we talked about you know what those people did they got in the spirit didn't they they didn't sit around like dried up old sticks is what brother brandham said they got right into the feel of things and if there's ever a place brothers and sisters that we have the ability we should have the Liberty to it's right here this is it in the house of the Lord he's provided this building he's provided the heat that's in here he's provided the light that's in here for one purpose and that's to worship Him thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there's no other pattern no matter what the scholars say I love that no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close though Scholars may tell you the apostolic age is over don't you believe it such a statement is wrong on two counts first of all it is wrong to Suppose there aren't any more apostles just because the original 12 are dead an apostle means a scent one and there are many scent ones today but they are called missionaries as long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of Life they is an Apostolic age going on doesn't he make it so clear so easy to understand it doesn't have to be shrouded in mystery a and dark and and and mysterious it's so clear secondly they refer to an age of manifested holy ghost power as being over since the Bible has been completed that is untrue there is not even one scripture that suggests that but many conclusively state otherwise here is our proof that both of these charges are false acts 238 and 39 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are AAR off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call the promise of Power with which the apostles were endued at Pentecost is to you Jews and to your children Jews and to all that are AAR off Gentiles and to as many as the Lord our God God shall call both Jew and Gentile until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease you know brothers and sisters one of these days he's going to stop calling the word of God says that his Spirit won't always strive with man there comes a point in time where we have to make a decision we've got to get our lives in order we have to go according to the word of God and follow him to the letter and you know there comes a time where if we choose not to we could actually go beyond the day of our Grace and we know it we know it God will make it very clear to us but we heard it said many times and I just want to maybe just remind us of this because it's it's vital this isn't a time to play Church Brothers and Sisters this is the time to get ready because we're on the Launchpad and the as asona ages here the bride AG is here the countdown has been on for over 60 years and now any moment this rocket could take off could lift off but you know people had that lived as slaves in in in the days of the children of Israel we've all heard this many times I'm sure but there were slaves in those days but there was a 50th Year of Jubilee and when that Year of Jubilee came around we know the law of the land according to God was that when that trumpet blew all the people who were slaves they could actually throw down their shovels throw down their rakes they could say goodbye to those slave masters those taskmasters every debt that was owed was was renewed it was forgiven at that sounding of the Jubilee trumpet but we know those people that decided to go free they were free indeed they could go back to their possession they could go back to their inheritance they could go back to everything that had been lost for that 50 years or however many years they were in bondage to pay the debt but there were some people that just didn't want to go they were comfortable in their position they wanted to stay with that slave master they wanted to raise their families under the task Master's whip they wanted to be bound to that slave master and what happened was they were taken and taken down to the temple not taken to a a a a a slavery taskmasters uh joint Association conference they were taken to the temple for a reason so that they could be bored in the ear they could have a an all put through their ear to show they have a hole in their ear they are now permanently a slave and they will never be able to be free again even if they live for another 50 years and another Jubilee trumpet blows they will still remain a slave for the rest of their days because that that that all has gone through their ear and you know brother bradam talks about that he says that spiritually speaking we will have the opportunity to hear the gospel for the last time and if we choose to reject to resist the Holy Ghost calling Upon Our Hearts then we will be spiritually bored in our ears and we will no longer be able to hear the Jubilee trumpet and go free we will be bound and you know what happens at that point the voice of God that we once heard in our lives slowly goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer and there's no restraints on a human being at that point and outside of the Holy Ghost a human being is a brute Beast and this world is set up brothers and sisters in as a vacuum as a spiritual vacuum if we don't have the Seal of God on our our bodies then that vacuum will just cause us to explode we'll just be completely exed uh consumed by all of the spirits in this world there's no way that we would be able to resist it outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why the world is so crazy now that's why we're seeing so many different manifestations of the devil and and you know what I mean when we talk about it there's so many people acting in so many different ways when did it become normal to teach children that they could be a boy when they're a girl or for a girl that she could become a boy if she's a girl what on Earth is going on you know you have the idea to think that people fought and died they laid their lives down so that we could have have freedom of choice in this country on how we want to worship and what we want to do they did not fight so that we could choose to change our genders I don't care if someone's listening to me say that because they need to hear it that is contrary to the word of God and this country was founded upon that and so was the United States of America but they've chosen to reject it so God said okay have it have it your way and what happened at that point was the lid of hell was pulled off and now you can see all the seeds that were swn way back way back now all those seeds are actually starting to grow and people are are going oh my goodness look at this world we're living in what's going on it's because they rejected God so now those seeds are going to come to fruition they're growing up and they're going to manifest and there ain't no stopping it but you know what even better than that there ain't no stopp in Sons and Daughters of God because all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God and when that happens we're out of here an unchanging God with unchanging ways that's who we serve my goodness the promise of Power with which the apostles were endued at Pentecost is to you Jews and to your children Jews and to all that are a far off Gentile and to as many as the Lord Our God shall call both Jew and Gentile until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right that means nobody can take it from us nobody can say that that it's we're aliens from that right no that's our inalienable right that's who we are that that power they had at Pentecost brothers and sisters originally she had the pure word of God and isn't it interesting because that's what this Elijah Ministry has done was restored the faith of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers right back to the pure word for our day original she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost and you know the devil is right here right now saying where's all those gifts and where's all the man estation and I want to say take a look right here take a look right here take a look at all the people that aren't here who have had that manifestation in their lives because the Lord is moving in his bride and there's some people that are going to say where are all the signs where are all the gifts and I want to say to those people get to the Altar and get right with God and you too will see those signs and wonders in your life he's not going to come down and just take us and say it's time to to to see the signs and wonders in our lives people have to sell out to him got to recognize that we're his inheritance we are his inheritance we have an inheritance that's in heaven reserved for us that's undefiled that nobody can touch and it's going to be there waiting for us but brothers and sisters he has an inheritance also and that is the lives of his sons and daughters of God that he came and died for and paid the price in Blood and wrote pardon every single one of us Hebrews 2 1:4 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip you know if you don't use it you lose it and I know I'm not an a a musician but I I know that that can be the case a and like riding a bike if you don't ride a bike you'll become unsteady on that if you speak a different language and you don't practice it you'll actually get a little bit Rusty won't you and if you serve God but you don't actually serve him all the time what's going to happen the channel is going to get clogged up the pipe's going to get clogged up the lamp that was once burning bright and clear is going to start to actually get so and and all that soot will actually start to build up on the inside of the glass and even though there's a light burning inside there it won't be very bright at all but we have the opportunity to trim our lamps brothers and sisters therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience to the word received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will brother Bram goes on to say that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost and that's one of the things brothers and sisters we've got to be very careful about when it comes to you know you hear me harping about Traditions all the time we need to be very careful that we don't try and get too organized and and become businessmen with the church because as soon as we start doing that what happens is we take the place of the Holy Ghost we need to make sure that we are sovereignly led by the holy spirit because that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost and I want to say if we have a pattern to follow this is it he says it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern now don't get LED astray here when I said that God and his ways never change I did not say the church and its Messengers could not change the church isn't God so she can change but what I said but what I said was that because of the unchanging God with unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God and then judge by that standard that's how it's done the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost now I just want to clarify this we're not going to try and speak in tongues we're not going to try and manifest the gifts of the Spirit we're just going to try and live good Christian lives we're just going to try and follow the word of God a and as we try and do that and put Christ first in our lives in our homes in our our minds in our existence in our beings as we do that then you know what happens is we just live like the first church that's just the way it works it it's not us actually trying to do anything it's just doing what the word of God said to do the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one and The Messengers to the churches having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that come the closest to Paul who was free of all men sold out to God and gave forth the word of God only and manifested the Holy Ghost in power none else would do you have to work from the original as like begats like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first messenger to the first age it is that simple and that wonderful he says with this key so simple yet so wonderful I was able by the help of the Holy Spirit to read the book of Revelation and the histories and find there in each age each each messenger the duration of each age and the part each played in the purpose of God from Pentecost to the consummation of of those ages since you now understand how we judge what the true church was like what she was at Pentecost and what she was in the apostolic age as set forth in the word in the book of Acts we can now apply the same rule to show how the church failed I know that's kind of a tough one because where did the church fail Church didn't really fail did it well as soon as they started to actually organize and say now we've got the Holy Ghost we need to quickly get behind it and create a book of Creeds and and and and and and what happened was the Holy Ghost just moved on from that church and that's where the church failed and that's what brother bram's talking about here he said the basic error or errors that crept into the first church and were revealed in the book of Acts and in Revelation and also in the Epistles will become more and more visibly manifested in each subsequent age until we come to a complete blackout of Truth in the last or Leo Dean age now as I was reading this I thought you know I've I've read it and I've seen it and and we know it we we know there was a time where brother Bram was preaching this and and he had a a board a Blackboard in the Tabernacle I believe and and what did he do he drew this out on this Blackboard and we know that when he drew it out there was I think another time it was another service that the Holy Ghost came and and this is where people might say wow this is getting out there but there was a hand that wrote it on the back of the Tabernacle wall exactly like he wrote it out on the Blackboard confirming that that is exactly what happened what my point is with this here is to think that we're talking about the the the the complete blackout of Truth truth in the last or leoan age if that's what's happened and we know it is how are we able to know the the word how are we able to know the truth I just was having a little Jubilee at home today when I was studying this thinking about it how in the leoan church how can the leoan church be able to receive the truth when there's a complete blackout only God brothers and sisters only Grace there's no thing that we could ever do or say we've done to be able to receive the word of God if we're able to receive this word it's all his grace to us and we have the ability to rejoice and I just can't help but think when we truly catch that Revelation that we're redeemed only because he chose us not because we we went and cashed in a token and now I'd like to be redeemed please I want to say this if that's the case where'd you get the token who gave you that token because you didn't produce it you didn't make it you didn't buy it nobody in Earth gave it to you your parents can't give it to you the only person is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and the only way we could ever get that token is because he gave it to us before the foundation of the world so when we catch that Revelation brothers and sisters there should be no restraints to worship I'm not saying that you should do anything but alls I'm saying is the more I actually catch this Revelation the more it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Oh My to think that he actually did this for me I have the ability to see in the midst of Leo to seea and darkness what it just makes it clearer and clearer when we get over there and say you know how did you make it through being eaten by lions they're going to say how did you make it through not getting consumed by all the Devils now out of this first key that we have received of the Lord there comes another and slightly less wonderful truth I said that the true church would always try to be like it was in the book of Acts that's exactly right but we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until there is a complete blackout of Truth in the last day when the Lord is about to appear brothers and sisters I don't know if it's ever been darker the question now arises in our minds does God forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception on no account for the scripture says very clearly the elect cannot be deceived but you know brothers and sisters we know the word of God also says that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected and that means that it's not out there somewhere we said this and we'll just keep saying it it's right here unfortunately it's right here the two Vines are intertwined and I'm not saying in this building I'm saying in and around the message of the hour brothers and sisters there's false Doctrine and if we're not careful we can be consumed by it because you know it's not a great screaming shouting salivating smoking fire breathing monster that we need to be afraid of we need to be afraid of 99% truth and 1% error brothers and sisters one word off is Satan's kingdom and that's what caused all mankind to fall into death isn't it Eve taking one word thou shalt not surely die but God told her husband you will surely die the day you eat thereof my the elect cannot be deceived Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible ible they shall deceive the very elect and we know what is the key how can we know what's right and wrong how can we discern what's right and wrong the only way we're going to be able to discern what's right and wrong is to have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters that's the only way it's the only way we can study our way into the word of God but he's going to hide himself in Simplicity and he's going to reveal himself in the same he's not going to be as mankind thinks that he's going to be he's God he can do whatever he wants to do the only way we're going to be able to discern right and wrong is to have the Holy Ghost in our lives he goes on to say what then the answer is clear before us there is a true church and a false Church there is a True Vine and a false Vine and we have talked about the vines you're going to know them by their fruits and we know that branches can be grafted into the main Vine and they will have fruit they will have blossoms they will have great lives and they'll be living off of the main life but you know what their trunk is not the same as the original trunk and their fruit is not the same as the original Fruit and we know that their seed is not the same as the Original Seed and they can try and reproduce all they want and they will but they'll never be able to produce the right seed but there is one that can produce the right seed and that is the true vine the ratom he says but of course that false Church false Vine body will always try to usurp the position of the true church and contend that she and not the elect are the real and authentic the false will try to kill the true and you know we were talking about this a little while ago but I just want to emphasize this I want to emphasize this and this is just in my own way and some people might say brother Barry you're putting words in the prophet and you know what it's okay I want to say that it's okay you know to today we can't just take out a gun and go and persecute another church can we if we're the false we're not just going to take out a gun and go and shoot our brother that believes a little bit different than we do we're not going to do that we're not going to go with a baseball B I'm I'm getting a little bit crazy here we're not going to go and do that because we're Believers oh my but what about going and speaking bad about your brother and your sister the prophet of God says you can assassinate them you can kill their character just by your words the false will always try to kill the true that is how it was in the book of Acts that is how it is set forth in The Seven Ages and that is how it is declared in the various Epistles th it is how it has been that is how it is now that is how it will be it can't change because you know them by their fruits just have to give him enough life just keep pouring on the word just let the life manifest and event eventually their fruits are going to come man and you know what we can't manufacture fruits I can't if I'm an orange I can't be a lemon and if you're a lemon you can't be an orange but if we're the fruit of the Holy Ghost we're going to Bear the fruit of the Holy Ghost we're going to live the life of Jesus Christ he goes on to say now let us be very careful that we are not confused at this point that we will seek the word to validate this claim once again let's take it right back to the word of God right this this this Prophet let's take it back to the word to validate this claim let us go back to the book of the beginning Genesis in the Garden of Eden there were two trees one was good one was evil one produced life the other produced death there were two children who originally offered sacrifices to God let me repeat that both offered sacrifices to God Genesis 4 3-5 and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and abble He also brought of the first things of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and we know the story all too well he went and said hey if you would just do like your brother I would respect you but he didn't have it in him did he because that wasn't his father he couldn't actually honor his father he couldn't do it it wasn't in him but we know that they both offered sacrifices and aren't you thankful for a prophet in our day that would be able to go back and actually see those sacrifices he lays it out so many times how beautiful the sacrifice that Cain must have brought it must have been the biggest church it must have had the tallest steeple he must have had all the greatest vegetables and the and the most fantastic fruits of the land everything the absolute best and then his brother Abel he brings a stinking lamb before God and brings it in and puts it up on the Altar and grabs a jagged Rock and starts to chop its neck and the animal starts squirming and kicking and bleeding and we know the cane must have been like ah look what's going on I've Got My Sacrifice you're squirting blood all over it and Abel was probably shuddering himself thinking what am I doing but I got to follow the Revelation that God's given me and we know that God said I respect you you did what I wanted you followed the Revelation that I gave you and the other guy who did all the work he was like the the mule brother bradam talks about he's a good worker he could go and harvest all of it he's a good businessman he was able to get it all there but it wasn't respected by God here we are in our day in this time of Total Blackout Darkness with a man that could paint those pictures to us to tell us the way that sacrifice went and and so many others in the Bible but just that story oh my there were two children both offered sacrifices to God let me repeat that they both offered sacrifices to God we read it Genesis 4: 3 to5 brother B goes on to say but one Cain was evil being of his father that Wicked one while Abel was righteous before the Lord who was his father goes back to the original sin what really happened in the Garden of Eden did did they really just eat an apple or an apricot is that really what happened what conjures up in the mind of of everyone when when you say the original sin Hollywood knows it Hollywood came out with movies about it what is it music movies everyone knows what it is I'm just going to let that hang I'm not going to get into that tonight because I could just use up the rest of the time and then some with that one brother bam goes on to say again there were two children from the Flesh of the same parents they were the twins of Isaac and Rebecca and one was elect of God and the other reprobate both worshiped God brothers and sisters if we can Rec recognize that we have the ability to worship God that we truly are elected we have every single reason to Rejoice because some people are created to be destroyed some people are created to actually be saved some people are created to be the Bride of Jesus Christ who are you tonight who are we tonight if we can recognize that we're truly elect of God there ain't nothing we did about it the only thing that we can do is recognize it and rejoice Rejoice for what he's done but you know he here he's laying it out both worship God in every single case there was worship of God involved in every case the evil hated the righteous and persecuted the righteous in some cases the evil destroyed the righteous but notice they were planted together they lived together they both made claims upon God and worshiped God these illustrations depict perfectly the parable of the Lord Jesus Christ when he said that the kingdom of heaven was like unto a man who sowed good seed only to have an enemy come and plant tears amongst those good seeds God did not plant the tears Satan planted those tears right amongst the good seed of God those two kinds of plants people from two different seeds grew up together they partook of the nourishment in the same Earth they shared in the same Sun rain and all other benefits and both were harvested in their turn do you see it he says don't ever forget these truths don't ever forget these truths brothers and sisters as we study the church ages and latter the seals and above all don't forget that it is in this last age when the tears are getting Bound for their burning and they will shove out the wheat that is to be garnered for the Lord and we know we've heard it said brother Gilbert has preached it when the bride begins to say I and my father are one when the elected begins to say those words brothers and sisters the tears are actually going to pull away they don't like that now you're going and making yourself God but what about me but you know what we know them by their fruits we just heard it in this word here they're going to be the ones that persecute we can't prevent it we can't stop it we can't change it we love our brothers and our sisters they're still our brothers and our sisters it's up to God to sort them out it's not up to us to sort anybody out it's up to God entirely and promise I promise a money back guarantee he will sort every one of us out but as the elect we won't need to be sorted because we'll be actually with him doing the Sorting in his throne he says don't ever forget these truths we studi the church ages latter of the seals above all don't forget that it is in this last age when the tears are getting Bound for their burning and they will shove out the wheat that is to be garnered by the Lord I want to carry this thought all the way through so let us go a step further we've got just a few minutes here have you ever studied the history of revivals now a Revival signifies a move of God in power and every time God moves Satan is there to move also it never fails and we know that in the ministry of William Mari and Bram after his ministry suddenly Faith healing campaigns rose up all over the place isn't that interesting and if you were to go back and look at it on Wikipedia you would actually see it in the days of the great Welsh Revival and most didn't know this the insane asylums filled up quickly and there was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from God it is written that in Wesley's day the people would do the most peculiar things that were definitely of Satan to try to mock the goodness and power of God now I I I I haven't read about that but I'm going back to read that I want to see what that was that just sounds amazing to me not in a good way but to think that that's what happens take a look at what's going on in the world now think about all the distractions of Devils coming up all over the world and whether it's in sport whether it's in music whether it's in movies politics whatever ever it is the devil doesn't care he just wants our attraction he just wants to get us distracted off of the word of God so long as we're not looking at the word of God everything is fine in his world but boy oh boy when a true son or daughter starts to actually look towards Jesus starts to actually surrender their lives submit themselves therefore unto God and become to realize that he can resist the devil now then the devil has to flee in Luther's day it is said the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protested the Roman Catholic church but the miracle lay in the fact that he could and did stay sound and sane amidst the Fanatics who were often filled with and guided by wrong spirits and if you have been aware of this last day Ministry you will have noted the same invasion of false and wicked spirits and you know brothers and sisters we don't have to look very far Spirits don't die just because the prophet of God was taken off the scene those Spirits didn't die those Spirits have jumped into other people those Spirits under the guise of the message of the hour will allow people to actually worship them they will actually say in the name of some man they'll baptize in Christ brandom those are all false doctrines of devils it's terrible but just like any great move of God you get Fanatics that rise up it's not just exclusive to the message of the hour wouldn't it be interesting if we could just say that all of that fanaticism is just exclusive to the message of the hour you get it with the Pentecostals you get it with the Baptists you get it with all of the different denominational people out there you even get it with people who are maybe what they call secretari anisms they're they're separate from all of it they'll they'll have things like Waco Texas what was that I'll tell you what that's not this because anybody that wants to leave here you can leave at any time right there's no cult status here you're not here for life you're not threatened to stay here we encourage people to get to Christ my the miracle lay in the fact that he could and did stay sound and sane amidst the Fanatics who are often filled with and guided by wrong spirits and he says it right here and if you've been aware of this last day Ministry you'll have noted the same invasion of false and wicked spirits and he says it it has to be that way we have to recognize that it has to be that way brothers and sisters I'll call the musicians we'll try and end on time here it has to be that way he says now I hope and trust you are spiritual minded enough to get that and capitalize on it it has to be that way don't be surprised when we see Fanatics rise up when we see people rise up when we see people slaugh one another with their words don't be surprised by that those are the false and and wicked Spirits it's the devil that's all it is and that devil is either possessing that person or or or afflicting that person we don't know we just want to trust the Lord we want to trust the Lord that he's in complete control of all of it and I think when that happens brothers and sisters then we get that place of perfect rest that's where our Sabbath comes into play where we know that he's in control it doesn't matter though though though though he slay me yet I'll serve him we know that even David the king had that man spit on him and what did his say his man say the soldier that was with him he said you know what just just hold up one second maybe just take a step aside I don't want to get any blood on you I'm just going to draw my sword and take that dog's head off because he spat on my king and what did the king say you know what just just just just scale down don't worry about it God wanted him to do that God just wanted to see the way that we would react so don't worry about it I I know it's all okay we don't have to worry God's in control if he wants us to Exile from Jerusalem then we will and and we'll just let all that needs to happen happen and all of it will come to fruition all of it will manifest the way that it's supposed to it's not up to us to be pulling out tears we know that Jesus said that no just let them all grow up together and and and the Reapers will be the ones that actually do the separating and you know who the reapers are the reapers are angels and the angel Messengers by the preaching of the word they'll do the separating because they're preaching the word of God that's quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword it's able to discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart and just slice and dice just completely get right down to the heart of the matter to separate the spirits from the natural but he says now I hope and trust you are spiritual minded enough to get that and to capitalize on it that it's going to be that way brothers and sisters there nothing we can do about it it's just the way it is there's the false and there's the truth and if you have the ability to hear the truth and to see the truth then I suggest that you just Rejoice because you might not always have that ability to hear that truth a and if you don't Rejoice you know what brother uh Jesus Christ he said that if you won't Rejoice if you won't worship then immediately the Rocks they'll cry out because all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God you know what we're going to worship it's just the way it is maybe stand with me tonight as we do worship him a little bit can we sing I'll say yes Lord it's 11 [Music] one0 I'll say yes Lord I'll say yes to your will Lord I'll say yes where you lead me I will go I'll say
