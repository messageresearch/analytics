[55:24] thank you for that special today
[55:28] amen
[55:33] you know I know some churches that are
[55:36] very closed and very cautious and and
[55:39] very not interested in letting the
[55:40] little people take part in the service
[55:42] and I want to say this from my position
[55:45] in my office I'll say it that if we
[55:47] don't involve the little people while
[55:50] they're little people who's going to be
[55:51] there to worship when they get to be old
[55:54] people what's going to happen is they're
[55:56] going to leave they're gonna say it's an
[55:57] old People's Church
[55:59] and I don't want to live in an old
[56:01] person's church I want to live in a
[56:02] church that's got a spirit of people
[56:04] that are about 19 or 20 years old
[56:06] because that's the spirit of Christ
[56:09] that's where we're going brothers and
[56:11] sisters we don't want to be starchy
[56:13] folks here that are dried up old sticks
[56:15] we want to be happy and on fire for the
[56:17] Lord and what better way to do it than
[56:20] encourage the little children
[56:22] my goodness I just think it's wonderful
[56:24] I just want to encourage all the
[56:26] children if you feel led of the Lord you
[56:28] want to sing a special you're welcome to
[56:31] but make it reverent we don't do it to
[56:34] show we're not interested in trying to
[56:36] perform we want to bring a sacrifice of
[56:38] praise to the Lord when we sing a
[56:41] special it's to the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:43] God richly bless you each one
[56:46] my goodness
[56:47] one more little announcement we have a
[56:50] baptism today after service
[56:53] certainly looking forward to this
[56:59] thank you
[57:01] and I know our dear sister jar main is
[57:04] looking forward to this
[57:05] it's her son brother Doty
[57:09] kakuji
[57:10] Hallelujah
[57:15] what a glorious thing
[57:17] for the Revelation to get baptized in
[57:19] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:24] not in in in in a bunch of titles but in
[57:27] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:30] it's tremendous
[57:31] so we have little baptism after service
[57:33] and uh
[57:34] yeah let's just get into the word sorry
[57:37] to keep everyone thank you musicians I
[57:40] want to continue on where we left off
[57:42] last week I just believe there's a
[57:47] still a little bit of anointing there so
[57:50] we'll read from Genesis chapter 4.
[57:57] Genesis chapter 4.
[58:07] we'll just start with verse one
[58:17] and Adam knew Eve his wife and she
[58:19] conceived in Bear Cain
[58:21] and said I have gotten a man from the
[58:25] Lord
[58:26] and she again bear his brother Abel
[58:30] and Abel was a keeper of the Sheep
[58:33] but Cain was the tiller of the ground
[58:36] and in process of time it came to pass
[58:38] that Cain brought of the fruit of the
[58:40] ground and offering unto the Lord
[58:43] and Abel
[58:44] he also brought of the first Links of
[58:47] his flock and of the fat thereof
[58:50] and the Lord had respect unto Abel and
[58:52] to his offering
[58:55] but unto Cain
[58:57] and to his offering he had not respect
[59:00] and Cain was very Roth
[59:03] and his countenance fell
[59:06] my Bible says on the sideline there that
[59:08] he was angry
[59:10] and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou
[59:13] Wrath
[59:14] and why is thy countenance Fallen
[59:18] if thou doest well
[59:20] shalt thou not be accepted
[59:22] and if thou doest not well sin lieth at
[59:25] the door
[59:26] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[59:30] thou shalt rule over him
[59:33] and Cain talked with Abel his brother
[59:36] and it came to pass when they were in
[59:38] the field
[59:39] that Cain rose up against Abel his
[59:41] brother
[59:43] and slew him
[59:44] let's just bow one more time
[59:49] Heavenly Father Lord
[59:51] so thankful for your word so thankful
[59:54] that you've given us the ability to read
[59:55] your word Lord
[59:57] with spiritual understanding Lord
[1:00:01] I know many people have been trained
[1:00:03] according to
[1:00:04] theological studies
[1:00:07] many people can speak eloquently Lord
[1:00:10] and father we desire
[1:00:13] to not be tillers of the ground and to
[1:00:16] be eloquent
[1:00:18] but we desire to live by Revelation
[1:00:20] father
[1:00:21] and we just pray that one more time you
[1:00:24] would just Reveal Your word to us as we
[1:00:26] go forwards Lord Jesus
[1:00:28] that when we leave this building we
[1:00:29] would say that truly we heard from you
[1:00:32] we just want to commit this service into
[1:00:33] your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:00:36] pray amen God bless you this morning you
[1:00:38] may be seated
[1:00:43] just a few quick announcements we have
[1:00:45] the Youth Event this afternoon at the
[1:00:47] Clawson residence
[1:00:49] and I'm sure everyone has the
[1:00:51] information if you don't by all means
[1:00:53] reach out it's for the Youth
[1:00:55] um
[1:00:55] starts at two o'clock and ends at five I
[1:00:59] do apologize if the baptism holds people
[1:01:01] up it's the way it works we can't change
[1:01:04] these things and we're certainly uh
[1:01:06] thrilled that somebody wants to get
[1:01:07] baptized so by all means if you need to
[1:01:09] rush away then feel free to do that we
[1:01:12] don't want to keep anyone the time is
[1:01:14] from 2 P.M to 5 p.m lunch will be served
[1:01:17] and uh yeah I think it's a wonderful
[1:01:20] thing to have it on a Sunday because we
[1:01:22] have Monday the next day and it's
[1:01:24] important for everyone to recognize we
[1:01:26] have responsibilities and even the hosts
[1:01:28] they don't really want to have people
[1:01:30] too late in their house they have
[1:01:31] responsibilities the children have to go
[1:01:33] to school Etc so it'll be a wonderful
[1:01:36] time this afternoon I'm sure of fun and
[1:01:38] fellowship Thursday September the 14th
[1:01:41] we've got a prayer meeting at 7 30 at
[1:01:43] the church here Sunday September the
[1:01:45] 17th we have a 6 PM communion service
[1:01:48] and Wednesday September the 28th we have
[1:01:50] brother James new Vande Bandy here and
[1:01:53] certainly look forward to seeing him
[1:01:55] I really enjoyed seeing uh
[1:01:58] our other brother that was here I don't
[1:02:00] know why I'm drawing a blank right now
[1:02:01] yeah brother Herbert mccobba we had such
[1:02:04] a wonderful time we actually had a
[1:02:06] little birthday celebration and we took
[1:02:08] him with us uh after service the next
[1:02:11] day it was really kind of fun we went to
[1:02:13] a bike track and we had brother Herbert
[1:02:15] riding a bike on the track he had a
[1:02:18] wonderful time
[1:02:19] it was just real good so uh are you
[1:02:21] happy this morning
[1:02:23] uh one more thing I wanted to mention is
[1:02:25] uh you know starting in October I felt
[1:02:28] led for a little while to do it and uh
[1:02:29] so we're gonna go for it I believe the
[1:02:32] blessing of the Lord is upon it we're
[1:02:34] going to do an in-depth study on the uh
[1:02:36] revelation of the seven Church ages
[1:02:39] that'll be a Wednesday night study and I
[1:02:42] believe it's going to be in depth and
[1:02:43] it's going to take a long time because I
[1:02:45] want to go cover to cover from the very
[1:02:47] first word to the very last word of that
[1:02:49] book and just trust that the Lord will
[1:02:51] bless it and uh you know maybe we'll
[1:02:54] take a break here and there just to
[1:02:55] maybe just preach a little bit but I
[1:02:58] think it's important to understand what
[1:03:00] that book has to say and it's important
[1:03:02] to understand what what that book means
[1:03:04] to the believer today so we'll just take
[1:03:07] Wednesday services and we'll just go
[1:03:09] through that and just take our time and
[1:03:11] I'm sure questions will rise along the
[1:03:13] way and uh you know we'll just deal with
[1:03:15] everything accordingly and I just wanted
[1:03:17] to mention if anybody doesn't have a
[1:03:19] book like a hard copy book of the
[1:03:21] revelation of the seven Church ages
[1:03:23] we're happy to get them we have 10
[1:03:25] copies right now in the church but we'll
[1:03:27] get more if you would like them if you
[1:03:29] don't if you just want to study digital
[1:03:30] that's fine likely we'll have the quotes
[1:03:33] up on the screen so
[1:03:35] um I think it will work out just fine
[1:03:37] but there's so much in there I believe
[1:03:39] it really is the essence of the message
[1:03:40] of the hour it gives us the ability to
[1:03:43] just study a little bit further on some
[1:03:45] of these doctrinal things that we
[1:03:46] believe and why why we believe them we
[1:03:49] don't believe them just because somebody
[1:03:50] said we should believe them we believe
[1:03:51] them because they've been revealed to us
[1:03:53] and how do they get revealed to us we
[1:03:55] can say that you know we hear maybe a
[1:03:57] man put it in a book and he's written it
[1:03:59] down and he said it but we can take
[1:04:01] everything that's said in that book and
[1:04:03] bring it right back to here
[1:04:04] it's not just something that we're
[1:04:06] saying wow it's it's a man's book and
[1:04:08] and he got some special glasses and he
[1:04:10] found some some Golden Plates and an
[1:04:12] angel came around and revealed something
[1:04:14] to him no that would be just fine
[1:04:17] Brother Branham says I have no doubt
[1:04:19] that that happened speaking about Joseph
[1:04:20] Smith and and the Mormon doctrine that
[1:04:23] would be just fine Brother Bradham says
[1:04:24] I have no doubt that that happened that
[1:04:26] an angel came and revealed a furtherance
[1:04:28] to a word but it wasn't taking it back
[1:04:31] to the word and that's the critical
[1:04:34] difference and if someone would just
[1:04:36] take the moment to listen to what is
[1:04:38] said in that book they would see that
[1:04:40] it's exactly what the Bible says and I
[1:04:43] think when you believe the Bible and you
[1:04:45] have a man that actually brings
[1:04:46] something that actually opens up the
[1:04:48] word
[1:04:49] I don't know how you can look away and
[1:04:51] say it's just a man
[1:04:53] it just causes something on the inside
[1:04:55] of the inside to say Amen to that word
[1:04:58] so anyways uh starting in October on the
[1:05:01] fourth we'll uh just begin that call it
[1:05:03] a series and we'll just see what the
[1:05:06] Lord will do
[1:05:08] um there's many many points inside there
[1:05:10] that I really am excited to get into but
[1:05:13] we'll get there talking about our
[1:05:14] scripture this morning we didn't really
[1:05:16] go further with it but we can now as we
[1:05:19] come back to the word maybe we'll just
[1:05:21] start with verse 8. of Genesis chapter 4
[1:05:26] . I didn't really get to where I wanted
[1:05:27] to
[1:05:29] um
[1:05:29] because I wanted you to sit down
[1:05:31] I didn't want to have all the
[1:05:32] announcements and keep you standing and
[1:05:35] it's better if we don't get nervous if
[1:05:37] we can just relax around the things of
[1:05:39] the Lord
[1:05:40] we want to have peace verse 8 of Genesis
[1:05:43] chapter four says and Cain talked with
[1:05:44] Abel his brother and it came to pass
[1:05:46] when they were in the field that Cain
[1:05:48] rose up against Abel his brother and
[1:05:51] slew him
[1:05:52] and the Lord said unto Cain where is
[1:05:54] Abel thy brother
[1:05:56] he said I know not
[1:05:58] am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:06:00] I want to go back to where we were last
[1:06:02] week and talking about this the
[1:06:05] characteristics of that answer
[1:06:07] is not of God
[1:06:10] that is not The Offspring of Adam
[1:06:13] that is not even a human answer
[1:06:16] that's a satanic answer
[1:06:19] to cough it up to God to his face
[1:06:22] to say to him I know not I'm just going
[1:06:25] to lie first
[1:06:26] actually first I'll murder them
[1:06:29] or actually first I'll get angry because
[1:06:32] you tried to correct me
[1:06:34] but because I'm not a child of God I
[1:06:39] can't receive correction when it comes
[1:06:40] to me so I'll reject it I'll Rebel
[1:06:44] and then I'll go and kill my brother
[1:06:46] because I know he has the true
[1:06:48] revelation
[1:06:50] and you know we heard brother Branham
[1:06:52] say it we can kill people just by
[1:06:55] assassinating their character
[1:06:57] we don't have to actually go and kill
[1:06:59] him physically
[1:07:01] and you know it gets really important
[1:07:03] and really heavy because really fast too
[1:07:06] I believe because the blaspheme the Holy
[1:07:09] Ghost is the unpardonable sin isn't it
[1:07:13] and you know what that is to call The
[1:07:15] Works of God
[1:07:17] The Works of the devil
[1:07:19] so God is working in a brother or a
[1:07:21] sister
[1:07:22] what happened here is Cain blaspheme the
[1:07:27] Holy Ghost
[1:07:29] we'll call it the Holy Ghost
[1:07:31] Holy Ghost wasn't given yet I know that
[1:07:32] I get it I know people are looking at me
[1:07:35] but you know what the Holy Ghost is God
[1:07:36] isn't it isn't it God
[1:07:38] and isn't that Jesus
[1:07:40] Jesus wasn't standing there but it was
[1:07:42] God it was the spirit of Jesus that came
[1:07:45] down and spoke to him in the garden and
[1:07:47] said you know Cain where's your brother
[1:07:49] knowing full well where he was
[1:07:52] but what happened was he said his blood
[1:07:54] speaks and we talked about it last week
[1:07:56] isn't it wonderful that the blood speaks
[1:07:58] there's some quotes for it but it's
[1:08:00] tremendous that the blood speaks I'll
[1:08:02] just read from the token in
[1:08:05] 630901 m
[1:08:08] Paul tells that the blood speaks
[1:08:11] it's paragraph 355.
[1:08:14] Paul tells us that the blood speaks that
[1:08:17] anyone knows that the blood is actually
[1:08:18] itself it can't speak
[1:08:21] it's a chemistry is that right how many
[1:08:23] knows that but how many knows that the
[1:08:25] blood speaks
[1:08:27] if you want to put that down Genesis 4
[1:08:29] 10 God said what about your brother said
[1:08:31] his blood cries from the earth against
[1:08:34] you is that right his blood is speaking
[1:08:39] Hallelujah
[1:08:41] God said what about him
[1:08:44] and he said am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:08:48] can you imagine that
[1:08:50] right
[1:08:51] excuse me right to the face of God said
[1:08:53] and his blood is crying out his blood is
[1:08:55] crying out it's a token it's a token
[1:08:58] that he had been killed his blood was
[1:09:01] crying out against him now if you get
[1:09:03] that in Genesis 4 10 then in Hebrews 12
[1:09:06] 24 start reading Hebrews 10 12 24 said
[1:09:09] the blood of Jesus speaketh better
[1:09:11] things than that of Abel Abel had a
[1:09:14] revelation that it had to be a lamb to
[1:09:17] sacrifice to atone for the sin of man to
[1:09:20] atone for the sin of his parents
[1:09:24] imagine that brothers and sisters job
[1:09:27] was making sacrifice for his children
[1:09:30] but what about the children making a
[1:09:32] sacrifice for the parents maybe the
[1:09:35] parents just don't have the Revelation
[1:09:36] maybe the parents just don't have the
[1:09:38] ability to see what we can see oh my but
[1:09:42] I believe the children have the
[1:09:43] opportunity to make a sacrifice for the
[1:09:46] parents
[1:09:47] see Abel
[1:09:49] he was a righteous man he died innocent
[1:09:54] because he was in the way
[1:09:56] he was in the way standing for the real
[1:09:58] Revelation he had
[1:10:00] and isn't it wonderful he wasn't given
[1:10:02] the instructions
[1:10:04] he wasn't told go and take a lamb and
[1:10:07] sacrifice it it was a revelation that
[1:10:10] came to him
[1:10:11] and it was magnified in the gospels when
[1:10:15] Jesus asked Peter he asked his disciples
[1:10:17] who who do people say that I am and some
[1:10:19] said Elias and some said a prophet and
[1:10:22] and some said other things maybe a
[1:10:24] pastor a good man but he said now let's
[1:10:26] let's bring it down to home it's nice to
[1:10:29] talk about what everyone else is saying
[1:10:30] but who do you say that I am
[1:10:34] and one of the disciples had a
[1:10:36] revelation
[1:10:38] and he said Thou Art the Christ
[1:10:41] the sent one
[1:10:43] the son of the Living God
[1:10:45] the scent anointed one
[1:10:48] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:10:51] Living God and God or God Jesus said to
[1:10:54] him he said it to him directly wow
[1:10:58] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed that
[1:11:00] to you Peter
[1:11:02] Simon barjona but my Father in Heaven My
[1:11:05] Father which is in heaven has given you
[1:11:08] a spiritual Revelation the same thing
[1:11:10] that happened to Abel he was given a
[1:11:13] spiritual Revelation but look at the
[1:11:15] characteristics of this brother of his
[1:11:17] his brother was a liar his brother was a
[1:11:20] murderer and the manifestations of that
[1:11:22] had to come out in his life
[1:11:25] it's terrible isn't it oh my but look at
[1:11:28] the lineage of Jesus Christ David had
[1:11:31] adultery and David had had murder inside
[1:11:35] of him that Jesus God had to get out of
[1:11:38] him
[1:11:40] but it didn't change the word of God it
[1:11:42] didn't change the Throne of David
[1:11:44] we know we talk about the Son of God the
[1:11:48] son of man the son of David
[1:11:50] the son of man Ministry is what we're
[1:11:53] under right now
[1:11:54] son of man Ministry I don't want to go
[1:11:57] too far with that but see Abel was a
[1:11:59] righteous man he died innocent because
[1:12:01] he was in the way he was in the way
[1:12:04] standing for the real Revelation he had
[1:12:06] he it's he spoke it cried out the
[1:12:09] Justice blood of Abel cried out against
[1:12:12] Cain
[1:12:13] but the blood of Jesus Christ not only
[1:12:15] cried out it redeemed
[1:12:18] amen that speaketh better things it
[1:12:20] makes you Sons and Daughters it hides
[1:12:23] you from the wrath of God see the blood
[1:12:25] of Abel could not hide Cain see but the
[1:12:27] blood of Jesus can amen
[1:12:31] so old Cain came out today
[1:12:34] if you've been a persecutor against the
[1:12:37] word
[1:12:38] say the days of Miracles has passed the
[1:12:40] thing is all nonsense and things it's
[1:12:43] crying out
[1:12:45] you see the blood of Jesus Christ Cries
[1:12:48] Out
[1:12:49] but there is forgiveness in it if you'll
[1:12:51] just accept it
[1:12:53] wish we could stay a little while on
[1:12:55] that see the blood speaketh better thing
[1:12:59] I think we can stay a little while on
[1:13:01] that today I don't think we have to rush
[1:13:03] away from that I think it's important
[1:13:05] for us to recognize even though we're
[1:13:08] not talking about a Dodie old grandpa
[1:13:10] that's sitting on a cloud playing a harp
[1:13:13] and having Angels worshiping him he's
[1:13:16] he's not in that position is he
[1:13:19] even though he is on the throne and even
[1:13:22] though he does have the white wig of
[1:13:25] supreme deity supreme justice
[1:13:29] he has love
[1:13:31] and he wishes Grace and peace unto you
[1:13:36] his bride he's not looking to judge us
[1:13:40] the only thing that's going to happen is
[1:13:42] he's going to judge all of the people
[1:13:44] who choose to not judge themselves here
[1:13:46] on this side the people who choose to
[1:13:48] not judge themselves according to the
[1:13:50] word of God on this side that was given
[1:13:52] by a Vindicated Prophet through every
[1:13:54] single age
[1:13:55] there was no change to that
[1:13:57] there's there's this idea that somewhere
[1:13:59] along the way God stopped using prophets
[1:14:01] I don't know why or where that came in
[1:14:04] because we can see we've talked about it
[1:14:05] many times where God started using
[1:14:07] prophets it was because mankind cried
[1:14:09] out and said it's too frightening don't
[1:14:10] let God speak let Moses speak because if
[1:14:13] God speaks we want to die
[1:14:15] so God said all right if that's what you
[1:14:16] want I'll give you a prophet no problem
[1:14:19] but when he says thus saith the Lord you
[1:14:20] better perk up your ears and listen to
[1:14:22] what he has to say
[1:14:23] and only some people have the ability to
[1:14:26] do that why is it because it's a
[1:14:28] spiritual revelation
[1:14:30] and that spiritual Revelation I'm so
[1:14:32] thankful for a prophet in our day that
[1:14:33] would say that spiritual Revelation it
[1:14:35] doesn't cause people to puff up it
[1:14:37] causes people to become humble to
[1:14:39] recognize that outside of the goodness
[1:14:41] of God the grace of God to individuals
[1:14:43] personally they would never hear that
[1:14:45] voice
[1:14:46] we'd never be able to say that God sent
[1:14:48] a prophet
[1:14:52] but isn't it wonderful to think that
[1:14:53] there's a blood that cries out for us
[1:14:54] even right now
[1:14:56] that blood is still on The Mercy Seat
[1:14:58] crying out that blood is still calling
[1:15:01] people there's still people that want to
[1:15:02] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:15:04] Jesus Christ
[1:15:05] and we know we know full well there's
[1:15:08] coming a day it's never been closer
[1:15:10] where there's going to be a general
[1:15:12] resurrection and rapture
[1:15:14] the church is going to go into Glory
[1:15:16] that certain group of people that was
[1:15:18] elected to do it it's not up to us to
[1:15:20] say anybody's in or out it's it's up to
[1:15:22] God and God alone but those who are
[1:15:25] elected to go in that will subject
[1:15:26] themselves to the word
[1:15:28] we look at judgment in the face right
[1:15:31] here and judgment here is the word of
[1:15:34] God
[1:15:36] you know you many times you'll hear
[1:15:37] people say well I could never live it
[1:15:39] and you know what we can never live it
[1:15:41] that's why we say you've got to get the
[1:15:43] Holy Ghost
[1:15:44] because you'll never live it on your own
[1:15:46] you'll try it and you'll fall down flat
[1:15:48] on your face
[1:15:50] but those with the Holy Ghost will get
[1:15:52] back up again those are the Holy Ghost
[1:15:55] will go back to church again and they'll
[1:15:57] have the desire in their heart to say
[1:15:59] Lord forgive me judge me here search me
[1:16:02] and try me because I want to be right I
[1:16:06] want to be judged here I don't want to
[1:16:07] stand before that white Throne of
[1:16:08] judgment
[1:16:10] because if we stand there brothers and
[1:16:12] sisters it'd be better for us to not
[1:16:13] have known about this message here on
[1:16:15] this side of Eternity oh my
[1:16:17] God because there'll be people over
[1:16:18] there that never heard of it
[1:16:21] that have never heard of it but they'll
[1:16:22] stand before that white Throne of
[1:16:24] judgment and they'll know that it's a
[1:16:26] word judgment between that step where
[1:16:29] they're at in front of that throne and
[1:16:30] the Lake of Fire one word of judgment
[1:16:34] but isn't it wonderful to think that we
[1:16:36] have been given that ability now to have
[1:16:38] that word of grace to the people around
[1:16:41] us
[1:16:42] we can say that that rock that was
[1:16:45] rejected by the builders they had that
[1:16:47] became the corner has come down and it
[1:16:50] didn't cry I'm gonna destroy you it
[1:16:52] cried Grace Grace unto it we've been
[1:16:55] given the ability to recognize it's only
[1:16:57] by Grace We're saved through faith
[1:17:02] because there's a blood that cries out
[1:17:04] for us
[1:17:06] I just think it's wonderful looking at
[1:17:08] this scripture here just to see the
[1:17:09] identity the characteristics of Cain's
[1:17:13] father the characteristics of Cain's
[1:17:15] father is that he's a murderer he's a
[1:17:16] liar and he's not afraid to just stand
[1:17:19] right in the face of God and just say to
[1:17:21] him it's not my problem am I My
[1:17:23] Brother's Keeper it's not my problem why
[1:17:25] don't you go look for them yourself
[1:17:27] that's exactly what he was saying
[1:17:29] without saying it am I My Brother's
[1:17:31] Keeper we are our Brother's Keeper
[1:17:34] we are our Sister's Keeper it is up to
[1:17:37] us we will answer for our behavior on
[1:17:40] this side my goodness it's so important
[1:17:42] for us don't ever blaspheme the work of
[1:17:44] God and a brother or a sister don't ever
[1:17:46] do it brothers and sisters I would say
[1:17:48] that is thin thin ice that's getting
[1:17:50] right out there on a very thin Branch
[1:17:52] you might not be able to come back on
[1:17:54] the tree you might just snap off and
[1:17:56] fall down we want to make sure that we
[1:17:58] understand God is going to move and when
[1:18:00] God moves it's going to be according to
[1:18:02] his word it's not going to be according
[1:18:03] to our thinking it's not going to be
[1:18:05] according to what we think should happen
[1:18:06] maybe our Traditions sometimes we have
[1:18:09] family traditions sometimes we have
[1:18:11] church Traditions I want to say we're
[1:18:13] having some fellowship this week
[1:18:14] brothers and sisters don't try and take
[1:18:16] Calgary Living Word assemblies Spirit
[1:18:18] take the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:20] into your heart that's the only thing
[1:18:22] that will save you
[1:18:24] even saying that you're a part of the
[1:18:26] message of the hour won't save you
[1:18:27] unless you actually believe what the
[1:18:29] message of the hour was sent for
[1:18:31] yeah
[1:18:32] right that's to get you the baptism of
[1:18:34] the Holy Ghost so you've got the token
[1:18:36] so you can say hey I've got that token
[1:18:39] and I can take that token and I can
[1:18:40] remind the Lord that I've got that token
[1:18:42] he gave it to me and I've got it and I
[1:18:45] also want Satan to know I've got that
[1:18:47] token and you know as a father as a
[1:18:49] husband I'm going to take that token and
[1:18:51] I'm going to hold it over my family I'm
[1:18:53] going to hold it over every single child
[1:18:55] when I pray for them that they will have
[1:18:57] the desire someday to come to the
[1:18:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost because that's
[1:19:01] the only thing that's going to save them
[1:19:02] brothers and sisters
[1:19:04] not going to church not saying I've got
[1:19:06] books and tapes not saying I've been to
[1:19:08] Jeffersonville not saying I've done
[1:19:10] anything other than I've received the
[1:19:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost my goodness
[1:19:15] I just want to say it if you don't got
[1:19:16] it get it
[1:19:18] you don't understand ask
[1:19:20] because it's the only thing that's going
[1:19:21] to save us
[1:19:23] whether we go by the way of the Grave or
[1:19:25] whether we go by the way of the sky if
[1:19:26] you don't want to stand before that
[1:19:28] white Throne of judgment get the baptism
[1:19:30] of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:32] and what is the baptism of the holy
[1:19:34] spirit it's the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:19:37] it's it's the life the literal life of
[1:19:40] Jesus Christ Living out through his
[1:19:41] bride body
[1:19:45] but you know it's a nasty trick of the
[1:19:47] devil
[1:19:48] for people to think that they can get
[1:19:50] baptized in the name of a father and of
[1:19:53] a son
[1:19:54] and of a Holy Ghost
[1:19:55] and and that they would truly receive
[1:19:57] the Holy Ghost in their lives
[1:20:00] because the formula is to get baptized
[1:20:02] in the name
[1:20:04] and not names not a plurality in a name
[1:20:08] and we know full well if we think it's
[1:20:11] fine and good just next time I've said
[1:20:13] it many times I'll say it again just go
[1:20:15] and write a check and write father sign
[1:20:17] father on that check and and and give it
[1:20:20] what will happen we all know what will
[1:20:22] happen that check will bounce
[1:20:24] the people who checked checks who do the
[1:20:27] Sorting Center they'll say that's weird
[1:20:29] who is a father and they'll send it back
[1:20:32] nobody wants to have service charges why
[1:20:35] why couldn't we write a check in the
[1:20:37] name of father
[1:20:38] but we can go and say I'm going to get
[1:20:40] the Holy Ghost
[1:20:42] by the name of father
[1:20:44] who's the father
[1:20:45] who's the son who's the Holy Ghost
[1:20:48] Jesus Christ
[1:20:51] and anything else brothers and sisters
[1:20:53] is a trick it's deception
[1:20:55] it's it's a trick of the devil to get us
[1:20:57] to believe that everything is okay
[1:21:00] don't worry you shall not surely die
[1:21:04] if you partake of that fruit in the
[1:21:06] garden don't don't worry just one word
[1:21:09] if you want to see how how deceitful
[1:21:10] Satan is it's not a whole volume it's
[1:21:13] not a brand new Bible even though some
[1:21:15] charlatans have come around and done new
[1:21:17] books and different things it's it's not
[1:21:19] that it's one word off
[1:21:22] it's destruction one word off is
[1:21:24] judgment
[1:21:25] one word off caused the fall of all
[1:21:28] Humanity
[1:21:32] but there's a blood crying out for us if
[1:21:35] we're willing to accept it
[1:21:37] if we're willing to come his provided
[1:21:39] way and here's the thing I just want to
[1:21:40] say this it's just and then I'll move on
[1:21:42] I'll stop
[1:21:46] if you don't understand water baptism in
[1:21:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:52] it's not like we're saying
[1:21:54] you know if you've been baptized in
[1:21:56] titles
[1:21:57] and and we want to encourage you to come
[1:22:00] according to the right formula it's not
[1:22:02] like we're saying just go and get
[1:22:03] baptized in the name of of Barry Allen
[1:22:05] Johnson
[1:22:07] go and do it you'll get the baptism of
[1:22:09] the Holy Ghost that'd be crazy wouldn't
[1:22:11] it
[1:22:12] we're not saying that we're saying get
[1:22:14] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:17] for the remission of your sins
[1:22:20] so that you and your family could be
[1:22:22] saved so that you can receive the
[1:22:23] baptism the Holy Ghost I know many
[1:22:25] people here have been I know many people
[1:22:26] get this I know there's some people that
[1:22:28] don't though and I think it's incredible
[1:22:30] because it's our only ticket out of here
[1:22:32] it's the only way that we will be saved
[1:22:34] brothers and sisters
[1:22:36] and this is a time to preach fire and
[1:22:39] brimstone it's not a time to say it's
[1:22:41] okay we're just all inclusive let's just
[1:22:43] get together and and sing Kumbaya this
[1:22:46] is time to get in the boat
[1:22:48] what was it like in the in the 124th
[1:22:51] year that Noah was there preaching the
[1:22:53] gospel about get in the boat get in the
[1:22:55] ark do you think he got quieter I can
[1:22:58] only imagine he got loudspeakers and he
[1:23:01] set him up all around the ark get in the
[1:23:03] boat it's gonna rain
[1:23:05] but they all said oh he said charlatan
[1:23:07] he's he's a Madman he's up there he's
[1:23:09] got sunstroke on his bald head listen to
[1:23:11] the old man beating on the wood there
[1:23:13] saying it's gonna rain we can
[1:23:15] scientifically prove that there's a
[1:23:17] father and a son and a Holy Ghost and
[1:23:20] you'll get the Holy Ghost just the same
[1:23:22] way you're not the only Pebble on the
[1:23:23] beach look at our boat we've got a boat
[1:23:25] over here that we've built that's just
[1:23:26] as big and just as strong
[1:23:29] but it wasn't God's
[1:23:31] it wasn't the way God wanted it
[1:23:34] there was eight Souls saved out of how
[1:23:36] many millions of people
[1:23:39] that was the message for that day the
[1:23:41] message for today is get the Holy Ghost
[1:23:45] or perish
[1:23:47] or perish
[1:23:50] but right now we're so lucky we've got a
[1:23:52] blood that cries out for us
[1:23:56] looking at this characteristics of Cain
[1:24:01] the Lord said unto Cain why art thou
[1:24:03] wrath and why why are you angry
[1:24:06] why did thy countenance fall
[1:24:09] it says if thou do us well Thou shalt
[1:24:11] shall thou not be accepted and if thou
[1:24:13] doest not will sin lieth at the door and
[1:24:15] unto thee shall shall be his desire and
[1:24:18] and shall Thou shalt rule over him that
[1:24:20] means that his father will actually be
[1:24:23] what his desire is and we know that his
[1:24:25] father was Satan
[1:24:27] it's a big discussion but it's true we
[1:24:29] know that
[1:24:30] it can make people uncomfortable but
[1:24:33] it's true
[1:24:34] because any of these attributes are not
[1:24:36] of God and any of these attributes are
[1:24:39] not of Adam and we know that Adam was
[1:24:41] the son of God directly
[1:24:44] we could say maybe somewhere there's a
[1:24:46] mutation because Eve was came out of the
[1:24:48] side of Adam and she wasn't created
[1:24:49] directly by God
[1:24:51] no
[1:24:53] only because he had a different father
[1:24:56] it's another discussion we're not going
[1:24:57] to get into now
[1:24:59] I just don't feel too led to go that way
[1:25:01] but I just want to say it this way isn't
[1:25:03] it interesting to see the attributes of
[1:25:05] him as soon as correction is brought he
[1:25:08] gets angry
[1:25:10] so we can look to the back of the Bible
[1:25:12] and see very clearly
[1:25:14] that those people
[1:25:16] who refuse chastisement
[1:25:20] they have that nature don't they oh my
[1:25:22] I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I
[1:25:24] don't have need of anything you got to
[1:25:27] tell me
[1:25:28] my pastor told me my parents taught me
[1:25:31] we've got the religion we've got
[1:25:34] everything we need our fridges full our
[1:25:36] bank accounts are great we've got rrsps
[1:25:38] until the cows come home there's nothing
[1:25:40] going to happen here maybe we've even
[1:25:41] got a bunker underground in the
[1:25:43] mountains because we know things are
[1:25:45] going to go sideways somewhere along the
[1:25:46] way we've got a Year's worth of
[1:25:48] provision everything is fine
[1:25:51] but is it
[1:25:54] miserable
[1:25:56] wretched
[1:25:58] blind and don't even know it
[1:26:02] we know that it says in the word I
[1:26:04] counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:26:08] that's tried in the fire
[1:26:10] the pure word of God
[1:26:12] take that and and put it on take that
[1:26:15] and put it inside of you but just
[1:26:16] looking at these attributes here how
[1:26:18] Cain had these attributes and and he
[1:26:20] just he couldn't be corrected
[1:26:22] you ever know anybody that just can't be
[1:26:24] corrected
[1:26:27] doesn't matter what you say
[1:26:30] it all just gets spun around
[1:26:32] this gets twisted and and and spun
[1:26:35] around to match a certain way you know
[1:26:37] we all need to be corrected every single
[1:26:39] one of us the word says how how much do
[1:26:42] we endure are parents correcting and
[1:26:44] maybe that's part of the problem
[1:26:45] sometimes parents didn't correct us
[1:26:47] maybe I never got spanked enough I know
[1:26:51] there was a time in my life where I got
[1:26:52] it at school and I got it at home and I
[1:26:55] deserved it
[1:26:56] but that's the way it goes we we have
[1:26:59] our lives to live and if we can't accept
[1:27:01] the correction in our lives
[1:27:04] then we're not going to be very good
[1:27:05] children but the word of God says that
[1:27:07] if we can't accept chastening of the
[1:27:09] Lord the word of God can't sort us out
[1:27:12] then we're not his children
[1:27:14] so when the word of God comes you're
[1:27:15] knocking on my door I hear it I think oh
[1:27:17] Lord have mercy I I know that I failed
[1:27:21] you in this point and in that point and
[1:27:23] in the other point and I look back in my
[1:27:25] life and think about all the points and
[1:27:27] I think Lord have mercy when the word
[1:27:29] comes around what do I want to do I want
[1:27:31] to line up with it I don't want to say
[1:27:32] oh no it's all good I'm fine don't don't
[1:27:35] pick on me preacher I'm I'm fine
[1:27:37] everything in my life is good when we
[1:27:40] take that approach whose nature do we
[1:27:42] have
[1:27:43] whose nature is knocking at our door and
[1:27:45] what lieth at our door if we have that
[1:27:47] nature we know the word of God says sin
[1:27:49] lieth at our door
[1:27:51] so I just want to fast forward a little
[1:27:53] bit let's turn over to Matthew chapter
[1:27:54] 18 real familiar scripture we I think we
[1:27:58] kind of got into it last time
[1:28:01] we know that uh the the first part or
[1:28:04] maybe the middle part of Matthew chapter
[1:28:06] 18 is commonly referred to is how you
[1:28:08] deal with the situation in the church
[1:28:10] and you know I don't really want to go
[1:28:12] too far into that but you know if
[1:28:13] somebody does something wrong God has a
[1:28:16] provision for us a direction and
[1:28:18] instruction if somebody does something
[1:28:20] wrong then you go to your brothers what
[1:28:22] the word of God says you don't go to his
[1:28:24] neighbor and you don't go to somebody
[1:28:26] else and tell them what they did and how
[1:28:28] you're offended and what the problem is
[1:28:30] you go to your brother you go to your
[1:28:32] sister and you make that problem right
[1:28:35] but if that person won't hear you
[1:28:37] then you take a witness
[1:28:39] you bring someone with you and say look
[1:28:40] I tried to make this right and they
[1:28:42] won't listen it's according to the word
[1:28:43] of God I know this thing is wrong and
[1:28:45] and they just won't listen to me so now
[1:28:47] we bring a witness and if they still
[1:28:48] won't hear you then you bring it to the
[1:28:50] church and say look this brother the
[1:28:51] sister this thing they just you know and
[1:28:54] and of course there's a word of God and
[1:28:56] it gives us instruction how to do it
[1:28:57] we're not looking to find people to put
[1:29:00] out
[1:29:01] I've had a contentious issue over this
[1:29:03] at one point and I'm not interested in
[1:29:04] really trying to have a contentious
[1:29:06] issue but it is contentious
[1:29:09] many times people are real anxious to
[1:29:11] put people out
[1:29:12] and I think we need to just take a step
[1:29:14] back myself my opinion my view Jesus he
[1:29:17] took a woman who was caught in the act
[1:29:19] of adultery and what did he do to throw
[1:29:22] her out of the temple by her hair down
[1:29:24] the stairs and said you rotten woman get
[1:29:26] lost go get right and come back to
[1:29:28] church no
[1:29:30] he said woman
[1:29:32] where are thine accusers
[1:29:36] he who hath no sin in your life you just
[1:29:39] go ahead and cast the first stone
[1:29:42] that's the way the Lord deals with us
[1:29:45] and I think it's so amazing
[1:29:47] because I don't really find very many
[1:29:49] examples of even brother Branham putting
[1:29:51] people out of the church
[1:29:53] he did say there was a son that wouldn't
[1:29:56] listen he was an unruly boy and he
[1:29:59] wouldn't listen and he started running
[1:30:00] around and doing bad things and he still
[1:30:02] wouldn't listen and they took a witness
[1:30:04] and he still wouldn't listen and they
[1:30:06] put him out of the church and he said
[1:30:07] that you take someone and you put him
[1:30:09] out from under the blood and you watch
[1:30:11] him come crawling back if they're a true
[1:30:12] son and daughter of God they will
[1:30:16] but this isn't our agenda we're not
[1:30:17] interested in throwing people out this
[1:30:19] is an instruction to how to deal with
[1:30:21] sin in the church and every true son and
[1:30:23] daughter of God will reconcile and when
[1:30:25] a son and daughter sins which how many
[1:30:28] of us don't sin
[1:30:30] right every one of us does a provision
[1:30:34] for us when we do sin all we do is
[1:30:36] repent
[1:30:38] we make it right
[1:30:42] it's all we have to do
[1:30:45] so I don't want to get too far into that
[1:30:47] we know the next you know after it that
[1:30:50] that part of Matthew chapter 18 says
[1:30:53] verily it's Verse 18 verily I say unto
[1:30:55] you whatsoever you're bind on Earth
[1:30:56] shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you
[1:30:58] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:30:59] again I say unto you that if two of you
[1:31:02] shall agree on Earth as touching
[1:31:05] anything that they shall ask
[1:31:08] it shall be done for them of My Father
[1:31:10] which is in heaven
[1:31:12] if it were two or three are gathered
[1:31:13] together in my name there I am in the
[1:31:16] midst of them
[1:31:18] that's why we gather together in church
[1:31:19] that's why we gather together and have
[1:31:20] prayer meetings because we want to ask
[1:31:23] our petitions together in the name of
[1:31:27] the Lord Jesus Christ we want to see the
[1:31:30] Lord move in our lives we want to see
[1:31:32] the Lord help us in our time of need
[1:31:34] but really where I want to get to
[1:31:36] brothers and sisters is verse 21 I want
[1:31:38] to read this story this morning and and
[1:31:40] we'll just start with verse 21 here then
[1:31:42] came Peter to him and said Lord how oft
[1:31:46] shall my brothers sin against me and I
[1:31:48] forgive him until seven times
[1:31:51] Jesus saith unto him I say not unto thee
[1:31:54] until seven times but until Seventy
[1:31:57] Times Seven
[1:32:00] so I kind of threw it out there last
[1:32:02] time and it just really inspired me to
[1:32:04] to think about it so I did a little a
[1:32:06] little figuring and maybe I'm wrong but
[1:32:08] I don't know I think I probably got it
[1:32:10] right so 70 times 7 is 490 times
[1:32:14] I know brother Ken preached this a long
[1:32:16] time ago and I think it's good just to
[1:32:18] stir up our Pure Minds by way of
[1:32:19] remembrance I I believe there's some
[1:32:21] people here that maybe haven't heard
[1:32:22] this before and you know so if you take
[1:32:24] 490 times and you divide it by 24 hours
[1:32:28] that equals
[1:32:30] 20.41 times in an hour
[1:32:33] a brother or sister can sin and you can
[1:32:37] still forgive them according to the word
[1:32:38] of God
[1:32:39] according to what Jesus said
[1:32:41] but you know we live in a real world
[1:32:43] we're not awake 24 hours a day are we
[1:32:46] we're not up 24 hours a day really
[1:32:48] typically if it were possible I think we
[1:32:51] would all like to sleep a minimum of
[1:32:52] eight hours
[1:32:54] some of us sleep less but if you just
[1:32:56] said eight there's still 16 hours left
[1:32:58] to wake so if you take 490 and divide
[1:33:01] that by 16 where you're awake that's
[1:33:04] 30.62 times an hour someone can come and
[1:33:08] step on your toes
[1:33:10] and and will you forgive them
[1:33:12] of course
[1:33:14] to think about that though
[1:33:16] God knew all this math
[1:33:18] like it's just it's probably given him a
[1:33:20] headache to hear me talk about this
[1:33:23] but for me I'm thinking wow when I look
[1:33:25] at this
[1:33:28] 30.62 times that's over 30 and a half
[1:33:31] times an hour someone can come and step
[1:33:33] on your toes someone can come and sin
[1:33:35] right against you
[1:33:36] and still you'll forgive them and you
[1:33:39] know there's some times where people one
[1:33:41] thing happens to them one time
[1:33:43] many years ago and they're still
[1:33:45] dragging it around 30 years later
[1:33:48] they're still bringing it to the surface
[1:33:49] and saying but you know really you don't
[1:33:51] know how bad that was you you weren't
[1:33:53] there I I was there that happened to me
[1:33:55] and you don't know how badly I was hurt
[1:33:57] but if you did deal with it according to
[1:33:59] the word of God you would just let it go
[1:34:01] and it would be there
[1:34:02] right
[1:34:05] so if you take it and go a little bit
[1:34:06] further 60 minutes in an hour divided by
[1:34:08] 30.62 that's point
[1:34:10] five one times a minute
[1:34:14] can you imagine that half an offense
[1:34:16] every single minute every every single
[1:34:21] minute of the day someone's bringing
[1:34:23] half of an offense every time you're
[1:34:24] awake but you're still supposed to
[1:34:26] forgive them
[1:34:28] still supposed to forgive them the point
[1:34:30] I believe that brother Ken brought out
[1:34:31] and that I want to get to today is that
[1:34:33] it doesn't matter how many times this
[1:34:36] shows that it's an impossibility to ever
[1:34:38] be able to not forgive somebody
[1:34:42] and think about it if this is what God
[1:34:44] is saying to us through Jesus Christ how
[1:34:48] ought we to behave when we have who the
[1:34:50] spirit of who living out through us
[1:34:53] the spirit of Christ Living in our very
[1:34:55] bodies in that little teeny spot that we
[1:34:59] heard about in in the heart of man
[1:35:01] that's not in any other creature in this
[1:35:02] Earth so that he himself who created
[1:35:05] that spot can come and take up the Abode
[1:35:08] in that spot we call it the throne in
[1:35:10] the heart of man
[1:35:13] how much more are we to be forgiven
[1:35:16] people
[1:35:18] we know the the story here let's let's
[1:35:20] just go on and read this here what what
[1:35:22] Jesus says
[1:35:24] he tells a story a parable verse 23 of
[1:35:27] Matthew 18. therefore is the Kingdom of
[1:35:30] Heaven likened unto a certain King which
[1:35:33] would take account of his servants
[1:35:38] and when he had begun to reckon one was
[1:35:40] brought unto him which owed him ten
[1:35:43] thousand talents
[1:35:45] my Bible says that's
[1:35:48] 52 million dollars 52 million 800 if
[1:35:52] silver
[1:35:53] that's a lot of money
[1:35:56] am I reading that right I am 52 million
[1:35:59] almost 53 million dollars if silver
[1:36:02] goodness
[1:36:04] verse 25. so this King he recognized
[1:36:06] going through and checking everyone oh
[1:36:08] this one guy is really out of order we
[1:36:11] need to go and talk to him verse 25 but
[1:36:14] for as much as he had not to pay his
[1:36:16] Lord commanded him to be sold his wife
[1:36:18] and his children and all that he had and
[1:36:20] payment to be made and we know that that
[1:36:22] probably wouldn't be anywhere near
[1:36:23] enough
[1:36:26] verse 26 the servant therefore did what
[1:36:28] he fell down and worshiped him saying
[1:36:30] Lord have patience with me and I will
[1:36:32] pay thee all
[1:36:35] then the Lord of that servant was moved
[1:36:37] with compassion and loosed him
[1:36:39] and forgave him the debt
[1:36:43] how many of us would forgive 53 million
[1:36:46] dollar debt
[1:36:48] that's
[1:36:50] I don't know would we be able to do that
[1:36:53] say don't worry about it it's only 53
[1:36:55] million bucks it's all good
[1:36:58] we're brothers right
[1:37:01] but that's what it should be
[1:37:03] we know we've heard the prophet say we
[1:37:05] should be able to come to the place
[1:37:06] where we can chew each other's gum
[1:37:09] I don't know about that
[1:37:12] but I believe
[1:37:15] I'll just close my eyes maybe and
[1:37:17] hopefully get it when it's fresh
[1:37:20] oh man
[1:37:24] but the same servant verse 28 went out
[1:37:28] and found one of his fellow servants
[1:37:29] which owed him a hundred Pence
[1:37:33] you know my Bible says 44 dollars
[1:37:37] forty four dollars
[1:37:39] you know the word of God says that will
[1:37:41] strain at a gnat
[1:37:44] in our brother's eye
[1:37:46] oh my but we've got a beam in our own
[1:37:49] eye
[1:37:51] help us Lord
[1:37:53] but the same servant went out and found
[1:37:55] one of his fellow servants which owed
[1:37:57] him forty four dollars and he laid hands
[1:38:00] on him and took him by the throat
[1:38:03] whose Spirit are we talking about here
[1:38:05] took him by the throat saying pay me
[1:38:08] that thou oest
[1:38:10] and his fellow servant fell down at his
[1:38:13] feet and besought him saying have
[1:38:14] patience with me and I will repay thee
[1:38:17] all exactly what this fella did
[1:38:20] with a bigger debt
[1:38:24] and he would not
[1:38:25] but he went and cast him into prison
[1:38:27] until he should pay the debt
[1:38:29] teach him a lesson so when this fellow
[1:38:32] servants saw what was done they were
[1:38:34] very sorry and came and told unto their
[1:38:37] lord all that was done
[1:38:40] that is Lord after he had called him
[1:38:43] said unto him oh thou Wicked servant I
[1:38:46] forgave thee all that debt
[1:38:49] 53 54 million dollars but because thou
[1:38:53] desirest me I did it
[1:38:56] should us not thou have also had
[1:38:58] compassion on thy fellow servant even as
[1:39:01] I had pity on thee
[1:39:05] and his Lord was Wrath and delivered him
[1:39:08] unto the tormentors till he should pay
[1:39:10] all that was due unto him
[1:39:13] so likewise
[1:39:15] shall my heavenly father do also unto
[1:39:18] you
[1:39:19] and this is the thing he's not talking
[1:39:21] about debt here
[1:39:23] it's not talking about money
[1:39:25] so likewise shall my heavenly father do
[1:39:28] also unto you
[1:39:30] if ye from your hearts
[1:39:34] forgive not everyone his brother their
[1:39:37] trespass
[1:39:38] I don't think that leaves a lot of room
[1:39:41] now I want to say this we're humans
[1:39:45] I'm human
[1:39:47] we get hurt
[1:39:49] people step on our toes
[1:39:51] and I'm saying that Loosely people
[1:39:53] really wound us
[1:39:55] people really hurt us
[1:39:58] and it's up to us to forgive them
[1:40:00] because if we don't forgive them from
[1:40:02] our hearts and what that means is not
[1:40:04] saying you know I'll just tuck it under
[1:40:06] the blood and I know it's all fine
[1:40:07] everything is good you've got to
[1:40:10] genuinely come to the place where you
[1:40:12] know you have forgiven and how will you
[1:40:15] know when you've forgiven I'll Tell You
[1:40:17] by experience some people might want to
[1:40:19] contest it and dispute it but I'll tell
[1:40:21] you from experience how you will know
[1:40:23] you have forgiven them you'll forget
[1:40:25] about it
[1:40:27] there will be times where you'll
[1:40:29] remember something will come up and
[1:40:31] you'll be like oh yeah you know I used
[1:40:32] to be mad about that but I'm not anymore
[1:40:34] praise the Lord isn't it wonderful how
[1:40:37] he delivers us but as long as we're
[1:40:39] saying oh I'm upset um I'm coming to
[1:40:42] church and I'm just going to be upset
[1:40:43] and I'm going to pretend that
[1:40:44] everything's fine but everyone around
[1:40:46] can see that we're not happy
[1:40:48] we don't hide it
[1:40:50] but when we have those things brothers
[1:40:51] and sisters and maybe we do hide it and
[1:40:53] nobody can see it God sees it
[1:40:56] God sees it and as long as we're
[1:40:59] actually holding on to it we're
[1:41:00] disobeying God
[1:41:03] it's Disobedience to hold on to it
[1:41:06] because his word says that if you don't
[1:41:08] forgive from your heart
[1:41:12] you know what we want to see him take
[1:41:14] our sin and forget about it don't we
[1:41:16] how often should our brother be able to
[1:41:18] sin against us
[1:41:20] oh my
[1:41:21] and we offer forgiveness freely just
[1:41:24] freely
[1:41:25] forgiveness here you go
[1:41:27] I know you did that and I know you
[1:41:28] probably didn't mean to because I know
[1:41:30] that who I'm looking at isn't the real
[1:41:32] you and you're not looking at the real
[1:41:34] me so that when I offend you I'm
[1:41:36] potentially offending the Lord Jesus
[1:41:38] Christ if you've got the holy ghost in
[1:41:40] your life and if I don't actually ask
[1:41:42] you to forgive who am I
[1:41:45] what's gonna happen
[1:41:48] I just think it's amazing here to think
[1:41:50] that he said so likewise shall my
[1:41:52] heavenly father do unto you
[1:41:54] if you eat from your hearts do not
[1:41:56] forgive one of his brother the
[1:41:58] trespasses and and I like the way he
[1:42:00] says that because remember the main debt
[1:42:03] that was forgiven by the Lord was huge
[1:42:06] humongous
[1:42:09] a fortune
[1:42:11] and yet the other person this is the
[1:42:13] comparison that Jesus is giving in his
[1:42:15] comparison the other thing is just a
[1:42:17] teeny little thing
[1:42:18] 44 bucks
[1:42:20] isn't it interesting how it goes you
[1:42:23] look at the world it's the world we live
[1:42:24] in today people will get so upset in
[1:42:27] traffic and how meaningful is traffic
[1:42:29] when we're just driving from A to B
[1:42:30] we're going to go from here to there
[1:42:32] but sometimes there's such anger
[1:42:36] such hatred Rises up oh man that guy cut
[1:42:39] you off I've got to make sure that he
[1:42:40] can't get past me oh where does that
[1:42:43] come from
[1:42:45] brothers and sisters we got to recognize
[1:42:47] that's the spirit of the devil
[1:42:51] you know we could find ourselves in a
[1:42:53] situation that we can't go back on very
[1:42:55] easily
[1:42:56] if that situation actually begins to
[1:42:59] really unfold and manifest but remember
[1:43:03] he forgave the
[1:43:06] e so how many people can we forgive
[1:43:09] you know we can look at forgiveness I
[1:43:11] didn't even think about this being the
[1:43:12] Forgiveness message but you know what it
[1:43:14] is because if we forgive people what it
[1:43:17] does is it gives us Liberty ourselves we
[1:43:19] can look at it from a selfish
[1:43:20] perspective many people will say that as
[1:43:22] a psychological thing if you forgive
[1:43:24] people it's not different it's not for
[1:43:26] them
[1:43:27] and sometimes it's not
[1:43:29] but it's for you
[1:43:31] it gives you the Liberty to say Lord
[1:43:32] I've taken you at your word and I don't
[1:43:35] understand the circumstance I don't
[1:43:36] understand the situation but I know
[1:43:38] you've got all things under your control
[1:43:39] and I just committed unto you and trust
[1:43:42] that it will be for your glory in this
[1:43:44] situation and if I feel that brother has
[1:43:46] done wrong or that sister has done wrong
[1:43:48] and something needs to happen then it's
[1:43:50] up to you God to deal with it because
[1:43:52] all I can do is come according to your
[1:43:53] word
[1:43:55] and just forgive them freely
[1:43:57] it costs a lot it's not that easy to do
[1:44:02] but I just want to think about this and
[1:44:04] and talk about it this way just in a
[1:44:05] simple sort of a way brothers and
[1:44:07] sisters if we're dealing with situations
[1:44:09] in our lives and we have the spirit of
[1:44:12] Cain
[1:44:13] it's the wrong spirit
[1:44:15] if there's any element of Cain there in
[1:44:17] the way that we're delivering our our
[1:44:19] Behavior to the world around us to our
[1:44:21] family members to our friends to our
[1:44:23] co-workers if that spirit's there it's
[1:44:25] not the right spirit and just ask the
[1:44:28] Lord if you don't want to have the wrong
[1:44:29] Spirit just ask him to take it out of
[1:44:31] you
[1:44:32] and I guarantee you if you come with a
[1:44:34] genuine heart you'll take it out of you
[1:44:35] and I guarantee you you'll be able to
[1:44:37] come to the place one day where you'll
[1:44:39] be able to say that I've taken those
[1:44:41] hurts and I've thrown them into the sea
[1:44:43] of God's forgetfulness I've committed
[1:44:46] them unto God and because I've done that
[1:44:48] I have complete Liberty I don't walk
[1:44:50] around every day thinking about how I've
[1:44:52] been hurt how I've been wronged how this
[1:44:54] person how that person should have could
[1:44:57] have or would have it's got nothing to
[1:44:59] do with it man I'm the one with my life
[1:45:00] I'm serving God I'm praising the Lord
[1:45:07] you know when you hold a grudge
[1:45:10] probably all heard it said but I think
[1:45:12] it's just real good I'm going to say it
[1:45:14] now it's
[1:45:15] it's just like taking poison ourselves
[1:45:18] and saying I'm going to take that poison
[1:45:20] and wait for that person to get sick and
[1:45:22] wait for that person to get dead
[1:45:25] you know what's going to happen is that
[1:45:26] person's just going to carry on living
[1:45:27] their life
[1:45:29] they're just going to carry on being
[1:45:30] happy being who they are doing what they
[1:45:32] do and maybe they're just going to carry
[1:45:34] on doing wrong
[1:45:36] they're going to keep stumbling around
[1:45:37] and hurting people maybe that's gonna
[1:45:39] happen
[1:45:40] but that's not up to you to sort out
[1:45:43] it's up to us to just come in line with
[1:45:45] the word of God for our day and as long
[1:45:47] as we're willing to do that then we're
[1:45:49] not drinking the poison
[1:45:50] I think it's terrible to drink that
[1:45:52] poison I've done it
[1:45:54] I think it takes years off your life
[1:45:57] there's times where we can get to the
[1:45:59] place brothers and sisters
[1:46:01] where we can actually Lament
[1:46:04] to have a brother or a sister phone us
[1:46:07] we see their phone we see them calling
[1:46:10] us and there's something that just burns
[1:46:12] inside of us and we're like oh
[1:46:15] not again
[1:46:17] it's not the right spirit
[1:46:18] but I can tell you God will take that
[1:46:20] away if you want them to the only way
[1:46:23] he'll do it is you've got to say Lord
[1:46:25] first forgive me
[1:46:28] Lord I want to be right with you just
[1:46:29] forgive me Lord for dragging that around
[1:46:31] take that out of my life Lord and I can
[1:46:34] promise you it will take away headaches
[1:46:36] it will take away sleepless nights it
[1:46:39] will take away indigestion it will give
[1:46:42] you your joy you will be happier I don't
[1:46:45] know why I'm going this way but I can
[1:46:47] just say I've experienced it brothers
[1:46:49] and sisters it's possible and how will
[1:46:51] you know when you've forgiven I'll say
[1:46:53] it again you won't be dragging it around
[1:46:55] thinking about it
[1:46:57] one day you'll look back and think my
[1:46:59] goodness I used to be so mad about such
[1:47:01] a stupid thing or maybe that thing
[1:47:04] really did hurt me but I know it wasn't
[1:47:05] them it was the devil it was Cain spirit
[1:47:08] in that person that actually caused them
[1:47:10] to do it but it was only so that God
[1:47:12] could prove that I'm truly a son or
[1:47:14] daughter of God and I have the ability
[1:47:17] to forgive not me on my own but his
[1:47:19] spirit that liveth out through me he's
[1:47:21] the one that can give me the ability to
[1:47:23] do that
[1:47:26] it's beautiful
[1:47:28] he wants us to forgive and if we're not
[1:47:31] willing to forgive then he's not it's
[1:47:33] that simple
[1:47:35] that's really heavy
[1:47:37] but it's true
[1:47:39] if we believe his word to be true
[1:47:42] brothers and sisters he says it really
[1:47:43] plainly if you don't forgive those forty
[1:47:46] four dollar debts
[1:47:48] if you're not willing to do that and why
[1:47:50] I'm willing to forgive a 53 million
[1:47:53] dollar debt just like that because you
[1:47:55] actually had the right approach but
[1:47:57] we're not willing to forgive a 44 debt
[1:48:00] oh my that chump change is going to take
[1:48:02] our soul and chain it it's going to
[1:48:05] chain it down
[1:48:06] we need to make sure that we're willing
[1:48:08] to forgive freely from our hearts to
[1:48:10] cast it into the sea of God's
[1:48:11] forgetfulness how do you do that you
[1:48:13] just ask God to take it out of you ask
[1:48:15] God to take it from you forgive that
[1:48:17] brother that sister earnestly in your
[1:48:19] hearts freely forgive from your heart
[1:48:21] and say Lord I don't even know how to
[1:48:23] deal with it just take it out of me I
[1:48:24] know you do
[1:48:25] I promise you he will
[1:48:28] he will totally take it out in such a
[1:48:30] way that you will be uh you won't even
[1:48:32] believe it one day you'll look back and
[1:48:34] think my goodness it's just like having
[1:48:36] an addiction it's just like having
[1:48:37] something that you just can't get Beyond
[1:48:39] something in your life maybe this thing
[1:48:42] just drags around for years and years
[1:48:44] and years but one day something happens
[1:48:46] one day you look back in your life and
[1:48:49] you say didn't I have that thing wasn't
[1:48:50] there that thing chasing me my whole
[1:48:52] entire life and now I can just say I've
[1:48:55] got the Glorious Liberty of Freedom it
[1:48:57] doesn't bother me anymore
[1:48:59] you forget about it
[1:49:02] he wants us to forget about it
[1:49:05] he doesn't want us to talk about it he
[1:49:06] doesn't want us to think about it but
[1:49:08] remember Satan's going to come around
[1:49:10] and say
[1:49:11] who am I brother don't you remember
[1:49:14] don't you remember that time that place
[1:49:16] remember how it made you feel what do
[1:49:19] you think you could say to that person
[1:49:20] now what would you say to them oh I bet
[1:49:23] you could straighten them out real good
[1:49:24] now especially according to the word you
[1:49:26] probably have some extra quotes that you
[1:49:27] could bring you could really lay it in
[1:49:29] there and just bring it on them and
[1:49:31] really convict that person couldn't you
[1:49:33] that's the voice of Cain that's the
[1:49:35] devil coming around trying to remind us
[1:49:37] but we just need to say Satan
[1:49:41] here's both barrels the Old Testament
[1:49:43] and the New Testament get lost he's
[1:49:46] going to come and try and Roost in your
[1:49:48] nest in your tree I mean make a nest but
[1:49:50] you don't have to let them be there
[1:49:52] you know my dad's Farm they have they
[1:49:54] have magpies and how do they get rid of
[1:49:56] the magpies the magpies come around the
[1:49:58] springtime and they try and nest in the
[1:50:00] caraganas here's a 12 gauge shotgun and
[1:50:02] some ear protection and a box of shells
[1:50:04] go get rid of those nests that they're
[1:50:07] building and you just have to do it two
[1:50:09] or three times do the circuit two or
[1:50:11] three times and they'll go but you know
[1:50:13] what happens a little bit later on they
[1:50:15] still come back they just keep coming
[1:50:16] back those birds are Relentless and the
[1:50:19] devils are the same way they're
[1:50:20] Relentless they will continually keep
[1:50:22] coming back but the Son and Daughter of
[1:50:25] God's gonna just pull out that shotgun
[1:50:26] and say get out of here I rebuke you
[1:50:28] with this 12 gauge shell and you know
[1:50:32] what happens when you hit one of those
[1:50:33] nests with that gun it just vaporizes it
[1:50:36] literally turns to powder when you hit
[1:50:38] it with that gun
[1:50:39] and you know what we don't we don't have
[1:50:41] to let the devil come and Roost in our
[1:50:43] heads in our minds and Tangle up our
[1:50:45] minds and occupy our thoughts and take
[1:50:47] us from being productive members of our
[1:50:49] family and and being in our
[1:50:51] relationships as husbands and wives
[1:50:52] because we've got these complexes that
[1:50:54] are continually dragging us down
[1:50:56] committed unto the Lord say Lord if
[1:50:59] you're God take this complex from me in
[1:51:01] the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke that
[1:51:03] devil
[1:51:04] and see if he won't leave
[1:51:06] see if God won't come on the scene he's
[1:51:08] just waiting for us to say Lord I want
[1:51:10] you to do this
[1:51:12] brother Bradham says somewhere in the
[1:51:13] message he's a thousand times more
[1:51:15] willing to do it than we are to receive
[1:51:17] it
[1:51:24] 1960-0925 that day on Calvary
[1:51:30] paragraph 127.
[1:51:34] it says now watch
[1:51:37] Jesus said
[1:51:39] watch how he stated it
[1:51:45] The Works that I'm doing now Healing The
[1:51:47] Sick raising the dead opening the eyes
[1:51:49] of the blind
[1:51:50] these Works shall you do also
[1:51:54] you'll do these if you believe in me
[1:51:57] you do these works and a greater than
[1:52:00] this shall you do
[1:52:02] for I go to my father
[1:52:05] paragraph 128.
[1:52:08] a little while and the world won't see
[1:52:10] me no more yet you'll see me
[1:52:12] I'll be with you
[1:52:14] even in you
[1:52:16] to the end of the world
[1:52:18] I will not leave you comfortless I'll
[1:52:20] pray the father he'll send you another
[1:52:22] comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[1:52:24] whom the world cannot receive
[1:52:27] yet you can receive him
[1:52:32] just to think about that you can receive
[1:52:34] him
[1:52:35] and brothers and sisters when you can
[1:52:37] receive him
[1:52:38] but Branham says it in the church age
[1:52:40] book that why when you take the word of
[1:52:43] God
[1:52:43] the pure word of God for your day and
[1:52:46] and you actually speak it he says why
[1:52:50] that's deity speaking
[1:52:55] 129 now notice the Greater Works
[1:52:59] was to have the power in the church
[1:53:02] not only to heal the sick of by prayer
[1:53:04] cast out Devils by prayer
[1:53:08] I love this but to impart eternal life
[1:53:11] to the Believers
[1:53:13] and you know brothers and sisters I just
[1:53:15] think this is really where I want to get
[1:53:18] to today that's the purpose of getting
[1:53:20] together in church that's the purpose of
[1:53:22] believing the message of the hour it's
[1:53:24] so that we can have eternal life
[1:53:26] imparted to us but that we can forgive
[1:53:29] others so that we can impart eternal
[1:53:31] life to them
[1:53:34] because maybe some people just can't
[1:53:36] have the Liberty that we have
[1:53:39] but if we have the ability to say I just
[1:53:41] freely forgive you according to the word
[1:53:42] of God just the way that Jesus
[1:53:45] instructed his disciples uh just exactly
[1:53:47] according to that Parable I don't
[1:53:49] understand it necessarily but that
[1:53:50] Spirit that's inside of me oh my
[1:53:52] goodness there's a blood that cryeth out
[1:53:54] and it just has Mercy for all those
[1:53:57] people that will come and I'm just
[1:53:58] willing to take him at his word and just
[1:54:00] forgive so freely
[1:54:02] my goodness I feel like according to
[1:54:05] what brother Mervin said someone's going
[1:54:07] to come and step on my feet
[1:54:10] remember brother Mervin when he brought
[1:54:12] that message I can't remember all of
[1:54:13] them but he said if you want patience
[1:54:15] you're going to get trials you pray for
[1:54:18] patience and watch what happens I'm
[1:54:20] saying I'm praying for forgiveness Lord
[1:54:22] have mercy
[1:54:26] now notice paragraph 129 the Greater
[1:54:29] Works was to have power in the church
[1:54:30] not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast
[1:54:33] out Devils by prayer but to impart
[1:54:35] eternal life to the Believers the Holy
[1:54:37] Ghost was coming and giving into the
[1:54:39] hands of the church to impart life oh
[1:54:41] that's what Calvary meant it took stoked
[1:54:44] degraded men and women and lifted them
[1:54:47] into a place to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:54:49] God
[1:54:51] to heal the sick and to impart eternal
[1:54:54] life
[1:54:56] I just when I read this I say my
[1:54:59] goodness isn't it so so easy to see why
[1:55:02] Satan doesn't like this
[1:55:04] isn't it so easy to see why the
[1:55:07] religious people would be the ones that
[1:55:09] would come right against the word that
[1:55:11] William Mary and Branham brought because
[1:55:12] he wasn't bringing some sort of false
[1:55:14] Doctrine he's bringing the truth how can
[1:55:17] you say that this is wrong that this is
[1:55:19] false Doctrine he's talking about Sons
[1:55:22] and Daughters of God people coming to
[1:55:24] the full realization of who they are
[1:55:26] about what the word of God is for to
[1:55:28] bring and impart eternal life to the
[1:55:31] believer
[1:55:36] that's what Calvary meant
[1:55:39] it took it stooped
[1:55:41] degraded men and women lifted them into
[1:55:43] a place
[1:55:45] to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:55:48] to heal the sick
[1:55:51] and to impart eternal life
[1:55:54] brothers and sisters that's the key I
[1:55:57] believe that's the critical Factor
[1:55:59] that's why we're here to impart eternal
[1:56:02] life
[1:56:04] to bring it to our children to bring it
[1:56:07] to our spouses to bring it to our
[1:56:09] parents to bring it to our neighbors to
[1:56:12] bring it to our co-workers to our bosses
[1:56:15] oh my to our schools whoever wherever
[1:56:19] just to impart eternal life and
[1:56:21] sometimes as we live our lives maybe
[1:56:24] we'll have to say a few words but most
[1:56:26] times we'll just have to live our lives
[1:56:28] our lives will speak volumes
[1:56:31] but to impart life
[1:56:34] not to impart judgment and unforgiveness
[1:56:38] judgment and unforgiveness brothers and
[1:56:40] sisters I'm sorry that's that's the
[1:56:42] wrong spirit
[1:56:44] it's not right
[1:56:49] I love the way that he says this too
[1:56:51] lifted them into the place to be Sons
[1:56:53] and Daughters of God to heal the sick
[1:56:56] so you know what we're not just looking
[1:56:57] for Healing The Sick are we
[1:56:59] we're not just looking for signs and
[1:57:01] wonders not looking for people to speak
[1:57:03] in tongues to say that they've got it
[1:57:04] we're not looking for limbs to be
[1:57:06] restored to say that they've got it to
[1:57:08] be able to speak squirrels into
[1:57:09] existence to be able to speak food into
[1:57:10] existence we're not looking for any of
[1:57:12] that we're just simply looking to impart
[1:57:14] eternal life because we want internal
[1:57:16] life imparted to us and as we're willing
[1:57:18] to actually forgive then we'll be
[1:57:20] forgiven as we're willing to judge then
[1:57:22] we will be judged
[1:57:25] there's coming a time I believe it with
[1:57:27] all my heart and I'm sure that we've all
[1:57:28] experienced it I think you could
[1:57:30] probably say Amen to it if you have but
[1:57:32] you know brothers and sisters we know
[1:57:34] this third pole Ministry it's not a
[1:57:36] public show we're not looking for great
[1:57:38] ministry to say that Calgary living
[1:57:40] words got the move of the Holy Spirit
[1:57:42] just like what was it was it
[1:57:44] Ashbury Tennessee
[1:57:47] people would say oh my we got to go and
[1:57:50] experience that and see it and you know
[1:57:51] sure there's an anointing with that but
[1:57:53] can they take the word
[1:57:55] are there people there fully forgiving
[1:57:57] everyone freely I don't know I'm not
[1:58:00] going to judge them and say no but I'm
[1:58:02] going to say do they believe the prophet
[1:58:04] do they believe the word sent by a
[1:58:06] Vindicated Prophet the one that said
[1:58:07] thus saith the Lord for this age
[1:58:10] because if they don't I don't know
[1:58:13] what are they doing
[1:58:15] we know that there will be many people
[1:58:17] in this world
[1:58:19] that will have great signs and wonders
[1:58:21] they're not what we're after that's not
[1:58:22] what we're looking for
[1:58:24] but I was saying it a little couple
[1:58:26] minutes earlier and I just get
[1:58:27] sidetracked but you know I can I'm sure
[1:58:30] that every one of us will be able to say
[1:58:32] I have experienced the third pull in my
[1:58:34] own life I have experienced speaking the
[1:58:37] word and watching it come to manifest
[1:58:39] right before my very eyes if you've
[1:58:41] experienced that say Amen this morning
[1:58:44] it's not a public show
[1:58:47] and you know as times get tougher
[1:58:49] brothers and sisters testimonies are
[1:58:52] going to get greater and greater
[1:58:55] maybe they will stop the ability to go
[1:58:57] and get groceries
[1:59:00] maybe they will stop the ability to go
[1:59:03] and get gasoline in our cars maybe they
[1:59:06] will stop some of these things to happen
[1:59:08] but you watch the true Sons and
[1:59:10] Daughters of God then
[1:59:12] when we need to go and be in service for
[1:59:15] the king Watch What Happens
[1:59:17] there will be a book of Acts written
[1:59:19] behind us
[1:59:22] but what we're talking about is
[1:59:23] imparting life
[1:59:25] forgiving freely
[1:59:28] I think it's just so beautiful
[1:59:30] brother Branham says oh my we'll just
[1:59:33] carry on a place to be Sons and
[1:59:35] Daughters of God to heal the sick and to
[1:59:37] impart eternal life by giving the Holy
[1:59:41] Ghost to obedient believers
[1:59:43] men who are once unbelievers
[1:59:46] be made Believers and impart spiritual
[1:59:51] eternal life
[1:59:54] 130 how much greater is it to say this
[1:59:57] sick woman laying here
[1:59:59] I can pray a prayer of faith and shall
[2:00:02] be healed that's a great thing
[2:00:05] that's what he was doing then but said
[2:00:07] greater than this shall you do I'm going
[2:00:10] to give you power not only to raise up
[2:00:12] for a while
[2:00:14] but to give him eternal life
[2:00:17] which will be Eternal forever
[2:00:20] how much greater is it brothers and
[2:00:22] sisters that's what we're talking about
[2:00:24] is to see the souls saved to see people
[2:00:28] come according to the word of God to
[2:00:31] truly get baptized with the Holy Ghost
[2:00:33] and I'll say it I don't know if if
[2:00:37] brother Doty has ever heard it said
[2:00:39] before but I'll say it I'm sure you must
[2:00:41] have there's times where you can get the
[2:00:43] Holy Ghost before you even hit water
[2:00:48] because what is the evidence of the Holy
[2:00:50] Ghost is the ability to receive the word
[2:00:52] for your day and you know the truth of
[2:00:55] the matter is when you receive the word
[2:00:57] for your day you're going to live it
[2:00:59] yeah you're not just gonna say I believe
[2:01:02] it I receive it you're going to live it
[2:01:04] because when you've received it it
[2:01:05] becomes a part of you and when it
[2:01:07] becomes a part of you you have to
[2:01:09] express it you cannot express it because
[2:01:12] that's the life that's inside of you
[2:01:14] every seed will bring forth after his
[2:01:16] own kind the only thing we've got to do
[2:01:18] is just pour on that word just stay
[2:01:20] straight with the word just like the
[2:01:21] prophet said I think it's so beautiful
[2:01:23] like Andrew Glover said I'll just keep
[2:01:25] saying this you know what if we want to
[2:01:27] say something fantastic and new we're
[2:01:29] just going to say what the prophet said
[2:01:30] because that is fantastic and new most
[2:01:33] people aren't even talking about it
[2:01:34] anymore they're trying to put some kind
[2:01:35] of a spin on it and you know what it is
[2:01:37] brothers and sisters it's because
[2:01:39] they're just not sufficiently impressed
[2:01:40] with the word but how many people here
[2:01:42] today are sufficiently impressed with
[2:01:44] the word
[2:01:46] if we can say that we're sufficiently
[2:01:48] impressed with the word oh my then there
[2:01:50] ain't no devil in hell or on Earth it
[2:01:52] can stand in your way brothers and
[2:01:54] sisters
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:55] not one
[2:02:02] greater than this shall you do
[2:02:04] I'm going to give you power
[2:02:06] not only to raise them up for a while
[2:02:08] but to give him eternal life which will
[2:02:10] be Eternal forever you know how brother
[2:02:12] Bradham he had the healing lines and the
[2:02:15] and the major campaigns and and the many
[2:02:17] mighty services and tremendous healings
[2:02:20] that went on but how many of those
[2:02:21] people actually truly went on to the
[2:02:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:25] there's many signs and wonders many
[2:02:27] people were healed but many people died
[2:02:31] and we know that you you had to confess
[2:02:33] your sin before you went before the
[2:02:35] prophet I remember hearing about this
[2:02:36] this guy
[2:02:37] this man and I thought boy oh boy if he
[2:02:40] could discern the thoughts that were in
[2:02:42] the heart of a man
[2:02:43] thinking that it was actually a man that
[2:02:45] was Discerning the thoughts that were in
[2:02:47] the heart of a man
[2:02:49] thinking about it carnally
[2:02:50] knocking at the surface not realizing
[2:02:52] what's actually happening you know what
[2:02:54] it did for me it caused me to be afraid
[2:02:56] I had fear
[2:02:58] because it was something that I didn't
[2:03:00] know it was something undefinable to me
[2:03:03] it was something that was out there and
[2:03:05] and the thing about it is
[2:03:07] I knew that I had sin I had things
[2:03:09] hidden in my life and that that man
[2:03:10] would expose it and I wouldn't be able
[2:03:12] to hide from it if it's true what was
[2:03:14] being said about this man but you know
[2:03:16] it goes deeper than that it wasn't a man
[2:03:18] because no man can do that
[2:03:21] only God can do that
[2:03:25] we know Satan can impersonate it but
[2:03:28] only God can do it consistently
[2:03:30] effectively over and over and over and
[2:03:33] never make a mistake with it and many
[2:03:36] people will say oh I'm sure that the
[2:03:37] prophet made mistakes not in discernment
[2:03:40] he was a man but never one time was he
[2:03:42] off with the discernment
[2:03:44] maybe he did things I'm not here to say
[2:03:47] criticize him I'm not interested in that
[2:03:49] what I am interested in is saying that
[2:03:51] there was a Vindicated prophet in our
[2:03:53] age and he was able to bring a word that
[2:03:55] brought us to the place where we can be
[2:03:57] positionally placed as Sons and
[2:03:59] Daughters of God where we can heal the
[2:04:01] sick where we can have the prayer of
[2:04:03] faith and the sick will be raised up but
[2:04:05] more importantly than that we will have
[2:04:07] the word out front of us and we'll see
[2:04:09] people have eternal life imparted to
[2:04:11] them where they can truly get the
[2:04:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost and when they
[2:04:15] do get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:16] whether it's before they hit water or
[2:04:18] whether it's after they hit water or
[2:04:19] whether it's during the time they're
[2:04:21] underwater it doesn't matter when they
[2:04:23] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:24] they're sealed until the day of their
[2:04:27] Redemption it's not until tomorrow when
[2:04:29] you fall and become human being again
[2:04:32] and you get away from the church
[2:04:34] experience it's not about that at all
[2:04:36] it's about receiving the word for your
[2:04:38] day and when you do nothing can change
[2:04:40] it because nobody ever talked you into
[2:04:41] it it's a beautiful thing when you get
[2:04:43] that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:47] that day on Calvary paragraph 131
[2:04:52] same message zero nine two five
[2:04:55] poor blind wretched people how do you
[2:04:57] miss that
[2:04:59] don't you see what the greater thing is
[2:05:02] that's the greatest thing ever could
[2:05:05] ever happen was to impart eternal life
[2:05:07] to people
[2:05:08] what is eternal life
[2:05:10] the life that he lived the life that was
[2:05:12] in him impart that to others
[2:05:17] can a man do that
[2:05:19] Son of God can
[2:05:21] yeah
[2:05:23] isn't it wonderful how did people get
[2:05:25] saved in the Bible after Jesus went up
[2:05:28] on a cloud after he was taken up into
[2:05:30] heaven and those two angels were
[2:05:32] standing there saying you know ye men of
[2:05:34] Galilee what are you looking at what are
[2:05:35] you doing here go on get busy go and do
[2:05:37] your thing go into Jerusalem and tell
[2:05:39] people about this go go and spread the
[2:05:42] gospel
[2:05:45] it has to be men telling men
[2:05:48] God uses men
[2:05:50] sons of God can impart eternal life we
[2:05:54] got into this last time I'm I'm running
[2:05:56] out of time here I'm not even really
[2:05:58] getting into it again but we'll get
[2:06:00] there I'm just going to touch on it
[2:06:01] paragraph 132 Jesus said who's so ever
[2:06:04] sins you remit to them they are remitted
[2:06:09] whosoever sin ye retain to them they are
[2:06:14] retained
[2:06:16] now here is where the Catholic church
[2:06:18] and many others made their big mistake
[2:06:20] they go out and say I forgive your sins
[2:06:22] that wasn't it how did they get sins
[2:06:25] forgiven in the Bible
[2:06:28] Peter answered that question on the day
[2:06:29] of Pentecost they said what can we do to
[2:06:32] be saved
[2:06:35] how can we get this that you all got
[2:06:38] he laid down the prescription he told
[2:06:40] them what to do he said repent every one
[2:06:42] of you towards God and be baptized in
[2:06:45] the name of Jesus Christ what for for
[2:06:47] the remission of your sin
[2:06:49] there's the Greater Works
[2:06:53] and there's the Greater Works what a man
[2:06:55] is willing to lay down his pride and lay
[2:06:56] down his life and say I want to be
[2:06:58] baptized
[2:06:59] and I want to say maybe I don't
[2:07:01] understand this titles thing and and
[2:07:05] maybe the name of Jesus Christ thing
[2:07:07] maybe I don't completely understand it
[2:07:09] but I just know the word of God says it
[2:07:12] so I want to see if God will be God and
[2:07:15] make it real to me in my life
[2:07:17] and the reason I say that brothers and
[2:07:19] sisters is I did that
[2:07:20] I did that exact thing I didn't come and
[2:07:24] and have a counseling session with the
[2:07:26] pastor to say that you know have you
[2:07:28] read this scripture and have you read
[2:07:30] this quote and have you read this
[2:07:31] scripture and have you read this quote
[2:07:32] and and have you been in the church X
[2:07:34] number of days and and have you done
[2:07:37] this and should have you have done that
[2:07:38] there was none of that
[2:07:41] it was through a conversation that the
[2:07:43] word of God says that you should be
[2:07:44] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:07:47] the remission of your sins and I thought
[2:07:49] wow I was baptized in the name of the
[2:07:51] father but what name is that I don't
[2:07:53] know
[2:07:54] what I'm saying is that sometimes we can
[2:07:57] make get so balled up in the doctrine of
[2:08:00] things and miss the main point the main
[2:08:02] point is we want to see people get the
[2:08:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost and if we're
[2:08:06] willing to come according to say Saint
[2:08:08] Peter's prescription here then we're
[2:08:11] going to actually get the right results
[2:08:14] then we truly will get the baptism of
[2:08:15] the Holy Ghost
[2:08:18] you know we were talking about a little
[2:08:19] bit you know brother Branham says it uh
[2:08:22] people have been concerned about
[2:08:23] children getting baptized and sometimes
[2:08:25] children will do it because other
[2:08:26] children want to do it but you know
[2:08:29] the children want to do it let them do
[2:08:30] it
[2:08:31] brother Bradham says they may never ask
[2:08:33] again
[2:08:34] and who will be accountable for that
[2:08:37] I wouldn't want to be that person to say
[2:08:39] my son wanted to get baptized but I
[2:08:41] thought he should reach at least this
[2:08:43] certain age and this certain Milestone
[2:08:45] and have this certain way
[2:08:47] what if it's just God in the heart of
[2:08:49] the child saying get me baptized because
[2:08:51] I know that I can get the baptism of the
[2:08:52] Holy Ghost or maybe I've already got the
[2:08:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I just
[2:08:56] want to come according to what the
[2:08:57] scripture says that it behooves all
[2:08:59] scripture to fulfill all scripture I got
[2:09:02] that wrong but we have to come according
[2:09:04] to the scripture and just get baptized
[2:09:06] in water
[2:09:07] it's possible to receive the Holy Ghost
[2:09:09] before you do just look at the story of
[2:09:11] Cornelius him and his house they got
[2:09:13] baptized after they received the gift of
[2:09:16] the Holy Ghost
[2:09:21] I just want to say don't get balled up
[2:09:23] in Doctrine and
[2:09:26] dogmone ideas and theories
[2:09:30] just get the Holy Ghost
[2:09:31] get to know the author of this book
[2:09:34] personally
[2:09:35] let him reveal it to you personally
[2:09:38] come according to his word and ask him
[2:09:41] to reveal it to me personally so that
[2:09:43] not so that I can just have eternal life
[2:09:45] so that I can have it imparted to me so
[2:09:47] that I could impart it to other people
[2:09:48] my neighbor might be struggling with
[2:09:51] something and just by being there at the
[2:09:53] right time there could be a word fitly
[2:09:55] spoken that would change his life
[2:09:56] forever
[2:10:01] paragraph 135 he said repent every one
[2:10:04] of you towards God and be baptized in
[2:10:06] the name of Jesus Christ for what for
[2:10:08] for the remission of your sin there's
[2:10:09] the greater work how many you preachers
[2:10:12] this morning how many you listening to
[2:10:13] my word on Magnetic Tape I just love
[2:10:17] that are willing to go to Calvary this
[2:10:19] morning
[2:10:21] and look what God did there for you
[2:10:23] and forsake your denominational Creeds
[2:10:26] and preach the gospel
[2:10:29] hallelujah it's in your lap now what are
[2:10:32] you going to do with it for repentance
[2:10:34] and remission of sins must be preached
[2:10:36] in his name
[2:10:38] to all the world beginning at Jerusalem
[2:10:40] Hallelujah Glory there you are what does
[2:10:43] Calvary mean to you what did that day do
[2:10:45] to you
[2:10:46] and I want to say this morning Calgary
[2:10:48] Living Word what did that day do to you
[2:10:51] what did it do to us
[2:10:55] did it stuff you out
[2:10:56] with some theology
[2:10:59] did it make you a stuffed shirt
[2:11:02] or did it make you a Christian
[2:11:04] sold out Hallelujah
[2:11:07] did it take us and pop us up
[2:11:10] because if we're getting puffed up for
[2:11:11] any reason brothers and sisters it's a
[2:11:13] wrong spirit
[2:11:14] that's Cain spirit
[2:11:16] I'm Not My Brother's Keeper no I don't
[2:11:18] have to worry about him
[2:11:20] no that's the wrong Spirit we don't want
[2:11:22] to have that in our lives don't want to
[2:11:24] have it in our homes we don't have it
[2:11:25] around our families
[2:11:29] I think one of the most important things
[2:11:31] for our family is to have a daddy that
[2:11:33] is willing
[2:11:34] to be humble enough to ask for
[2:11:36] forgiveness
[2:11:38] I believe that will make all the
[2:11:40] difference in the world in a home
[2:11:43] to have a daddy that will say I did
[2:11:45] wrong
[2:11:46] and I know it will you forgive me
[2:11:49] but when you get a daddy that will say
[2:11:51] nope I never did wrong I'm the daddy
[2:11:54] everything I do is right
[2:11:56] it's going to cause dissension
[2:12:04] we just need to forgive each other
[2:12:06] brothers and sisters
[2:12:08] not because somebody says so
[2:12:10] because our hearts are very hearts
[2:12:12] desire to
[2:12:14] and what that is is eternal life that
[2:12:17] we're imparting to others
[2:12:20] 19620318
[2:12:24] spoken word is the Original Seed
[2:12:28] Saint John chapter 20.
[2:12:32] I believe that's what I got marked down
[2:12:34] here and beginning with the 19th verse
[2:12:36] now listen close
[2:12:38] I challenge you to believe it
[2:12:41] oh I just feel good oh if
[2:12:43] I just wish I could see the Holy Spirit
[2:12:45] just huddle over here like that say now
[2:12:48] it's me listen
[2:12:51] can you imagine that
[2:12:52] push aside William Mary and Branham push
[2:12:55] aside
[2:12:56] Barry Bush aside all the humanity and
[2:12:59] just say just speak to me Holy Spirit
[2:13:02] just let it be you speaking to me
[2:13:05] I believe he will I challenge you to
[2:13:08] believe it oh I just I it feel good I
[2:13:12] just wish I could see the Holy Spirit
[2:13:14] just huddle over here like that say now
[2:13:15] listen
[2:13:17] the same day at evening being the first
[2:13:21] day of the week when the doors were shut
[2:13:23] where the disciples were assembled
[2:13:25] doors were shut where the disciples were
[2:13:28] assembled for the fear of the Jews came
[2:13:30] Jesus and stood in the midst and said
[2:13:32] unto them peace be unto you
[2:13:36] and when he had said so he showed unto
[2:13:40] them his hands and his side when his
[2:13:42] disciples
[2:13:44] let's see his side and and when there
[2:13:47] were the disciples glad when they saw
[2:13:49] the Lord when they recognized him
[2:13:52] remember they were upside down they were
[2:13:54] living in fear they were hiding
[2:13:56] their best friend the teacher and Rabbi
[2:13:58] he was killed
[2:13:59] even though he preached the word to them
[2:14:02] they were frightened they were hiding
[2:14:05] and rightfully so they probably would
[2:14:07] have been thrashed too if they were
[2:14:08] identified as one of his followers
[2:14:11] then said Jesus unto them peace be unto
[2:14:14] you
[2:14:16] oh are you ready as my father hath sent
[2:14:18] me he's the word the seed word seed
[2:14:24] so send I you
[2:14:28] I think it's a beautiful thing to hear
[2:14:30] Amen to that because many people would
[2:14:31] say oh it's just the disciples he's just
[2:14:33] talking to the disciples he's not he's
[2:14:35] speaking to Sons and Daughters of God
[2:14:37] the True Believers are the ones that are
[2:14:39] going to say Amen to that he says you
[2:14:41] believe it
[2:14:42] don't stop there's more of it
[2:14:45] and when they had said this he breathed
[2:14:47] on them and said unto them received ye
[2:14:50] the Holy Ghost
[2:14:52] whosoever sins you remit to them they
[2:14:56] are remitted unto them and whosoever
[2:14:57] sins you retain they are retained is
[2:15:01] that the truth
[2:15:03] I just want to take that scripture pause
[2:15:05] for a second as we I guess we pretty
[2:15:07] much need to get ready to close maybe
[2:15:09] I'll call the musicians and we'll pick
[2:15:11] this up later I guess but
[2:15:13] to think about this whosoever sins you
[2:15:15] remit they shall be remitted
[2:15:18] but whoever sins you don't remit
[2:15:21] they shall be kept
[2:15:24] they'll be retained is what the word
[2:15:26] says which is kept held onto
[2:15:30] when somebody sins against you
[2:15:34] remember the scripture that we read in
[2:15:37] Matthew 18 then came Peter unto him and
[2:15:40] said Lord how oft shall my brother
[2:15:43] sin against me
[2:15:45] how often shall he sin against me
[2:15:48] we went through the math we know
[2:15:50] there's way more times than we could
[2:15:52] ever possibly keep on top of
[2:15:55] it's just impossible for a brother to
[2:15:58] sin more times than we have forgiveness
[2:16:00] for
[2:16:01] if we're truly Sons and Daughters of God
[2:16:03] but if we don't actually have that
[2:16:06] forgiveness if we just can't come up
[2:16:07] without forgiveness then there's
[2:16:09] something wrong because honestly
[2:16:10] brothers and sisters it's not even us
[2:16:12] forgiving
[2:16:14] it's the spirit of Christ inside of us
[2:16:15] forgiving
[2:16:18] so if whoever sins
[2:16:20] you hold on to
[2:16:22] they're the sins that you're going to
[2:16:24] keep
[2:16:25] because the way that you judge people is
[2:16:27] the way that you'll be judged
[2:16:29] it's pretty heavy but it's important for
[2:16:31] us to recognize
[2:16:32] we're all living in this Human Condition
[2:16:34] and we're going to have our our feet
[2:16:36] stepped on we're going to have all these
[2:16:37] problems but you know I don't even know
[2:16:39] if it's in this quote I might not even
[2:16:40] finish reading this quote here but I
[2:16:42] just think when we think about how our
[2:16:44] brother our sister could could do things
[2:16:46] to us how much more did Jesus have
[2:16:48] things done to him the one that was
[2:16:50] actually hit in the head the one that
[2:16:51] was spit on had a crown of thorns
[2:16:54] pounded onto his head was thrown to the
[2:16:56] ground was forced to crawl up the street
[2:16:58] bloody almost dead
[2:17:01] but he wouldn't give up he hauled that
[2:17:04] cross why did he haul it
[2:17:06] so that we could have that in impartment
[2:17:09] of internal life that eternal life could
[2:17:11] come to us
[2:17:14] and we would want to hold something
[2:17:15] against a brother or a sister
[2:17:18] bye
[2:17:21] we did nothing to Jesus did we
[2:17:24] and he still went to Calvary for us
[2:17:30] maybe stand with me as we close today
[2:17:33] brothers and sisters forgive freely
[2:17:35] and I'll say this if you forgive freely
[2:17:38] not just that Jesus will actually
[2:17:40] forgive you because he will but I think
[2:17:42] we've gone well beyond that in terms of
[2:17:44] where we are in the sands of time
[2:17:46] understanding the church ages and all we
[2:17:48] know about the word for our day if we're
[2:17:50] not willing to forgive then I don't
[2:17:52] think we have the spirit of Christ wow
[2:17:54] that's good really hard but I want to
[2:17:56] say it plain and clear
[2:17:58] Cain's spirit will manifest Cain's
[2:18:00] Spirit the spirit of Christ will
[2:18:03] manifest the spirit of Christ
[2:18:06] you can't say that I'm going to live my
[2:18:08] life according to Cain's spirit and
[2:18:10] demonstrate this way
[2:18:12] and go to church and say praise the Lord
[2:18:14] I'm saved Hallelujah I got the Holy
[2:18:16] Ghost you might have an anointing
[2:18:20] we want to see people have eternal life
[2:18:22] imparted to them we want to see people
[2:18:24] know that they know that they know
[2:18:26] exactly where they stand
[2:18:28] I just can't can't express it the way I
[2:18:32] believe the Lord has given it to me but
[2:18:33] brothers and sisters just forgive
[2:18:36] just be willing to forgive freely that
[2:18:38] will demonstrate the life that's inside
[2:18:40] of you and you know if you've held on to
[2:18:43] things let him go
[2:18:44] you don't want nothing to hold you down
[2:18:47] we were hiking the other day and I just
[2:18:50] was finding all these really interesting
[2:18:52] rocks really really interesting rocks
[2:18:56] and it wasn't before long that I thought
[2:18:58] you know if I keep picking up rocks I'm
[2:19:00] not going to be able to carry them
[2:19:03] and I just I just thought in the moment
[2:19:05] you know isn't that a little bit like
[2:19:06] our lives and our burdens we can just
[2:19:09] keep picking up things we're supposed to
[2:19:10] lay them down
[2:19:12] don't pick them up and carry them with
[2:19:14] you they'll drag you down brothers and
[2:19:16] sisters
[2:19:17] just forgive freely and God will forgive
[2:19:20] you
[2:19:21] let's just bow in prayer
[2:19:23] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love
[2:19:25] you and we thank you for your word and
[2:19:28] father we thank you for your forgiveness
[2:19:29] Lord for your willingness to impart
[2:19:32] eternal life unto us
[2:19:34] whether we can look at the signs and the
[2:19:36] Wonders and all the Mysteries and all
[2:19:38] the things but father help us to get the
[2:19:41] ABCs right down pat Lord Jesus help us
[2:19:44] to understand oh Father there's no way
[2:19:47] that you're going to forgive us if we're
[2:19:48] willing to hold on to stuff in our lives
[2:19:51] while there may be there's unbelievers
[2:19:52] that have hurt us so deeply and father
[2:19:55] even worse maybe there's Believers that

[2:20:29] unto them knowing that you have it all
[2:20:31] in control and you're just looking for
[2:20:33] our response our response will either
[2:20:36] attract or detract people to your
[2:20:38] kingdom
