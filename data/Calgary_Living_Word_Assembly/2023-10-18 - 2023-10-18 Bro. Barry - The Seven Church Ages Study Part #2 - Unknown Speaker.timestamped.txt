[45:44] that just like Mary had to go in the
[45:45] upper room even brother Billy Paul had
[45:48] to go in the upper room it doesn't
[45:50] matter if we're Children of the Prophet

[49:47] Church
[49:49] ages we'll just read
[49:52] the first 20 verses of the first chapter
[49:56] of
[49:59] Revelation I know it's a lot of
[50:03] reading but what else would we rather do
[50:06] all right on a Wednesday night amen but
[50:08] read the word of God
[50:12] right so we'll just read the first 20
[50:16] verses of the first chapter of
[50:21] Revelation verse one says the revelation
[50:23] of Jesus Christ which God God gave unto
[50:26] him to show unto his
[50:28] servants things which must shortly come
[50:31] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[50:35] his Angel unto his servant John who bear
[50:39] record of the word of God and of the
[50:41] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[50:44] things that he
[50:45] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[50:48] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[50:50] keep those things which are written
[50:52] therein for the time is at hand
[50:56] John to the seven churches which are in
[50:59] Asia Grace be unto you and peace from
[51:02] him which is and which
[51:04] was which is to come and from the seven
[51:08] spirits which are before his
[51:11] throne and from Jesus Christ who is the
[51:14] faithful witness and the first begotten
[51:16] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[51:19] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[51:23] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[51:25] blood and hath made us Kings and Priests
[51:28] unto God and his father to him be glory
[51:32] and Dominion forever and ever
[51:36] amen behold he cometh with clouds and
[51:39] every eye shall see him and they also
[51:42] which pierced him and all kindreds of
[51:45] the Earth shall wail because of him even
[51:47] so amen I am Alpha and Omega the
[51:51] beginning and the ending saith the Lord
[51:53] which is and which was and which is to
[51:57] come the
[51:59] Almighty I John who also am your brother
[52:04] and companion in Tribulation and in the
[52:06] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was
[52:09] in the aisle that is called patmas for
[52:11] the word of God and for the testimony of
[52:15] Jesus Christ amen I was in the spirit on
[52:18] the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[52:20] great voice as of a trumpet saying I am
[52:24] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[52:27] and what thou seest write in a book and
[52:29] send it unto the seven churches which
[52:32] are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto smyna
[52:37] and unto pergamus and unto thyra and
[52:40] unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and
[52:44] unto Leo
[52:46] deia and I turned to see the voice that
[52:49] spake with me and being turned I saw
[52:53] seven golden candlesticks
[52:55] amen and in the midst of the seven
[52:57] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[53:00] man clothed with a garment down to the
[53:03] foot and Girt about the paps with a
[53:05] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[53:09] were white like wool white as snow and
[53:12] his eyes were as a flame of fire and his
[53:15] feet like unto fine brass as if they
[53:17] burned in a furnace and his voice as the
[53:20] sound of many Waters and he had in his
[53:24] right hand Seven Stars stars and out of
[53:26] his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword
[53:30] and his countenance was as the sun
[53:32] shineth in his strengthen and when I saw
[53:35] him I fell at his feet as dead and he
[53:39] laid his right hand upon me saying unto
[53:41] me fear not I am the first and the last
[53:45] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[53:48] behold I am alive forever more amen amen
[53:51] and have the keys of hell and death and
[53:55] of death write the things which thou
[53:58] Hast seen and the things which are and
[54:00] the things which shall be
[54:02] Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars
[54:05] which thou sawest in my right hand and
[54:08] the Seven golden
[54:10] candlesticks the Seven Stars are the
[54:12] Angels of the seven churches and the
[54:15] Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
[54:18] the seven
[54:19] churches amen let's just bow in prayer
[54:22] one more time gracious Heavenly Father
[54:25] Lord we're so thankful for your word
[54:28] amen hallelujah and Lord Jesus we're
[54:30] just as thankful for the exposition of
[54:32] your word Lord the Revelation father The
[54:35] Apocalypse of this word and father we
[54:38] can read it with natural eyes but father
[54:41] we we depend on your spirit Lord Jesus
[54:45] so we just invite you to come Lord as we
[54:47] begin this journey into this book father
[54:50] we know this isn't a man's book this is
[54:52] a book that you chose to have published
[54:55] and father we pray that you would just
[54:57] reveal it to us father that you would
[54:59] speak to us as we go along the way on
[55:01] this journey father as long as it takes
[55:03] father we pray that you would just be
[55:05] glorified in every single study every
[55:08] single discussion of this book father we
[55:10] pray that it would just become a new
[55:12] book to all of us father that Lord Jesus
[55:15] we would be able to see you in a greater
[55:17] light Lord that you would just reveal
[55:19] yourself to us further Lord we just want
[55:21] to commit this service and every single
[55:23] other service now in the study of this
[55:26] book into your hands as we go forwards
[55:29] we love you and we thank you we just ask
[55:31] all these things now in Jesus Christ's
[55:33] name we pray amen God bless you tonight
[55:36] you may be
[55:47] seated sorry I might be drinking a
[55:50] little bit of water tonight I had a
[55:52] little Dental thing today and
[55:56] my mouth is a little bit
[55:58] raw you happy tonight amen I just think
[56:02] it's so wonderful you know we heard that
[56:04] song tonight brother faren sang a new
[56:06] song and can be a little bit different
[56:08] when we hear new things and it can seem
[56:12] like maybe it's a little bit different
[56:15] and sometimes different can equate to
[56:18] actual conflict and it's important to
[56:20] remember that just because excuse me
[56:23] something is a little bit different it
[56:24] doesn't mean mean that it's bad or it's
[56:26] wrong it can just be different and we
[56:29] need to be able to have that flexibility
[56:31] to trust that everything will be
[56:34] fine I just think it's so important for
[56:36] us to recognize you know uh I I think
[56:39] that I would say I said it but I want to
[56:42] say it this way I believe the spirit
[56:43] said it on Sunday how many enjoyed that
[56:46] service on
[56:47] Sunday I I believe we had the Lord here
[56:50] I believe he came and visited Calgary
[56:52] Living Word cuzu I could never do that
[56:55] on my own but just to think about it you
[56:57] know what we sang tonight in that new
[56:59] song if if if Satan is not under our
[57:03] feet a and we are not positioned in
[57:07] Heavenly places then something is
[57:11] wrong Satan is the one that's supposed
[57:13] to be under our feet he's not supposed
[57:15] to be anywhere else in our lives and you
[57:17] know if he is then we need to
[57:19] acknowledge that we need to rebuke him
[57:21] and put him back in his place amen
[57:23] because we don't flee we know that we're
[57:25] supposed to actually submit ourselves
[57:28] therefore unto God then resist the devil
[57:31] resist Satan and he has to flee and
[57:34] where does he have to flee I think it's
[57:35] so beautiful he has to flee under our
[57:38] feet that's his position our position is
[57:41] in Heavenly places in the throne not
[57:44] even just around the throne not even
[57:46] just in another maybe condo in heaven
[57:49] but in the throne amen that's our
[57:52] position and if we don't see this then
[57:54] we need to just take take an inventory
[57:55] and check it up and make sure that that
[57:58] Christ is our theme that we are focused
[58:00] on Christ that we don't lose our desire
[58:03] to seek Christ I just think it's
[58:06] beautiful the the specials tonight thank
[58:08] you
[58:09] Brothers um you know talking about this
[58:12] study of the the exposition of the seven
[58:14] Church ages we're just beginning it and
[58:16] uh we're just going to start here and
[58:19] and see how far it will go I mean we
[58:21] started last week
[58:23] but we've got 45 minutes and I don't
[58:26] know how far you can really get in 45
[58:28] minutes especially if you have a a
[58:30] preacher talking maybe you'll get one
[58:33] paragraph of the book study in and uh
[58:36] we'll just see but tonight I just felt
[58:38] led to you know set the background read
[58:41] what brother Branham does in in the in
[58:43] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[58:45] he he starts the book with Revelations
[58:48] chapter 1 veres 1 to 20 the first 20
[58:52] verses of that chapter and the only
[58:54] verses of that chapter but he he reads
[58:57] that and he just sets the background
[58:59] forward and isn't it wonderful to read
[59:01] this scripture and to recognize you know
[59:04] when many times we would hear people
[59:07] talk about God in heaven and try and
[59:09] separate him as a a third person or a
[59:12] second person or another person of some
[59:14] sort of of conglomeration of of
[59:17] godliness how how we would see him as
[59:21] maybe a do old grandpa he's got gray
[59:23] hair and and he's really kind and loving
[59:26] and and he doesn't really have any
[59:27] judgment you know that's that's the way
[59:30] some people would like to portray him
[59:31] but what we read tonight I believe is a
[59:33] real accurate depiction his head is his
[59:37] hairs are white like wool white as snow
[59:39] and his eyes are as a flame of fire he
[59:43] says were as a flame of fire but I would
[59:45] say and I believe we could all say it
[59:47] tonight they are as a flame of fire
[59:49] because two times in here he says which
[59:51] was which is and is to come he is the
[59:54] same yesterday today and forever but
[59:56] that was actually repeated twice in this
[59:58] chapter it's very important to remember
[1:00:01] that this is the God we're talking about
[1:00:03] he's a god of judgment he's a righteous
[1:00:05] God but he's a god of judgment a and
[1:00:08] we're not here to point fingers at
[1:00:09] anybody we're just simply here to say
[1:00:11] you know what this is the way he's
[1:00:13] depicted it and and we just receive it
[1:00:15] the way that he's given it amen but
[1:00:18] talking about this um the
[1:00:21] introduction of
[1:00:23] the the Revelation the exposition of the
[1:00:26] seven Church ages if we could go to that
[1:00:29] the introduction I believe it's chapter
[1:00:32] 1 if you were to press play you would
[1:00:34] hear chapter
[1:00:37] 1 but we're not going to do that tonight
[1:00:39] I thought about it I wasn't sure how bad
[1:00:41] my mouth would be um just to give you an
[1:00:44] idea my my half of my tongue is still
[1:00:46] numb so I might be slobbering a little
[1:00:49] bit and we'll just see how it goes here
[1:00:52] but uh revelation Ians 1: 1 to3 if you
[1:00:57] still have your Bibles open maybe we
[1:00:59] could just read that until we get it up
[1:01:01] on the screen here Revelations 1 verse
[1:01:05] one says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:08] I I had a conversation with a brother
[1:01:10] once upon a time and I thought it was so
[1:01:12] good when you want to talk to someone
[1:01:13] about Jesus you can actually just say
[1:01:16] that that first sentence the revelation
[1:01:19] of Jesus Christ what is that that is the
[1:01:22] new birth right there the revelation of
[1:01:24] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ God himself
[1:01:28] making himself known personally to the
[1:01:31] individual the revelation of Jesus
[1:01:33] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[1:01:36] unto his servants things which must
[1:01:38] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[1:01:41] signified it by his Angel unto his
[1:01:44] servant John who bear record of the word
[1:01:47] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:01:50] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[1:01:54] he that readeth and they that hear the
[1:01:56] words of this prophecy and keep those
[1:01:58] things which are written therein for the
[1:02:01] time is at hand I personally think this
[1:02:05] is just a wonderful thing whether we
[1:02:07] read this or whether we hear this we're
[1:02:10] blessed amen hallelujah So reading 20
[1:02:13] verses tonight out of this I believe we
[1:02:16] could close our Bibles and go home and
[1:02:17] say we're blessed because that's what
[1:02:19] the word of God says it's
[1:02:22] beautiful do we have that up there there
[1:02:25] we go beautiful so the introduction of
[1:02:28] chapter 1 I'll go past the scripture
[1:02:34] here uh bear with
[1:02:36] me yeah for the time is at hand sorry I
[1:02:41] read out of my Bible not out of the the
[1:02:43] app here the Scribe not the author of
[1:02:47] this book is St John the Divine I'm sure
[1:02:50] we all know this probably preaching into
[1:02:52] the choir every single step of the the
[1:02:54] way but we're just going to talk about
[1:02:56] it like maybe someone here doesn't know
[1:02:58] it and uh just just say Amen to it I
[1:03:01] know it can seem like uh maybe a groaner
[1:03:04] if you're really used to it but it it's
[1:03:07] important this is vital to understand
[1:03:10] that not just this book but the entire
[1:03:12] Bible we were having a conversation a
[1:03:14] little while ago about it talking about
[1:03:16] the gospels and the gospels maybe sound
[1:03:19] like they're individuals and and they're
[1:03:21] not it's the gospel but it's the
[1:03:24] individuals who actually wrote it but
[1:03:27] they didn't write it they weren't the
[1:03:29] authors of it they were the scribes of
[1:03:32] it right so it's important to talk about
[1:03:35] this John is not the author of this book
[1:03:38] Jesus Christ is the author of this book
[1:03:42] the holy spirit is the author of this
[1:03:43] book amen God Almighty is the author of
[1:03:47] this book because we know they are one
[1:03:50] amen but not the Oneness style of one
[1:03:53] we're not going to going to get too far
[1:03:55] into that tonight but I think it's just
[1:03:57] important to recognize this is the
[1:03:58] revelation of Jesus Christ this is the
[1:04:02] manifestation the manifested attribute
[1:04:05] of God that he wanted to give to mankind
[1:04:07] so that mankind could actually
[1:04:09] comprehend God in in a form not just an
[1:04:13] object of worship in in in the sky in a
[1:04:16] Heavenly place somewhere but an actual
[1:04:18] man a person uh make it more personable
[1:04:21] to a human being so we could comprehend
[1:04:23] it with our our minds with our finite
[1:04:25] minds but the Scribe not the author of
[1:04:28] this book is St John the Divine
[1:04:31] historians agree that he lived the last
[1:04:34] part of his life in Ephesus though at
[1:04:36] the time of the writing of this book he
[1:04:38] was on the aisle of
[1:04:40] patmas it's not the life story of John
[1:04:43] but it is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:04:46] in the future
[1:04:48] ages I just think that's beautiful
[1:04:50] because even in the time this was
[1:04:52] written in 1965 is when it went to print
[1:04:54] it was it was preached in the 60s and
[1:04:56] and scribed throughout afterwards but
[1:04:59] then in 1965 it actually went to print
[1:05:01] and and here we have him talking about
[1:05:04] Jesus Christ being revealed in the
[1:05:05] future ages and here we are how many
[1:05:08] ages down the road are we how long is an
[1:05:11] age I don't know some people might put
[1:05:14] some time to it might be 40 years might
[1:05:16] be 80 years could be a hundred years I I
[1:05:20] wouldn't want to say but here we are in
[1:05:23] the future looking at this saying Amen
[1:05:25] to it it's not the life story of John
[1:05:27] but it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:05:30] in the future Church ages in verse three
[1:05:33] it's called a prophecy and that is what
[1:05:37] it actually is amen we know that the
[1:05:39] Book of Revelation is actually called a
[1:05:42] book of symbols and brother brandham
[1:05:43] preaches a whole message on that I'm not
[1:05:46] excuse me going to get too far into that
[1:05:49] he goes on to say this book is usually
[1:05:50] termed the revelation of St John but but
[1:05:54] that is
[1:05:55] incorrect these are really simple points
[1:05:58] but these are things that many people
[1:06:00] have grown up believing to be different
[1:06:03] and that's why I want to just really
[1:06:05] emphasize this I know myself I grew up
[1:06:07] believing this was different this book
[1:06:09] is usually term the revelation of St
[1:06:11] John but that's incorrect it is the
[1:06:13] revelation of Jesus of Jesus Christ
[1:06:16] given to
[1:06:17] John not just for John but for all
[1:06:20] Christians of all
[1:06:21] ages it's the only book in the entire
[1:06:25] Bible that is written by Jesus himself
[1:06:29] amen through personally appearing to a
[1:06:32] scribe yes I think it's important in
[1:06:35] here as well just maybe I won't get into
[1:06:37] that yet pardon me I'll go on and read
[1:06:39] here it is the last book of the Bible
[1:06:42] and yet it tells the beginning and the
[1:06:44] end of the dispensations of the Gospel
[1:06:47] brother branam says it in this message
[1:06:50] in in this chapter I believe he says it
[1:06:53] in here that Satan hates this book more
[1:06:56] than any other book in the Bible because
[1:06:57] it talks about his destruction and and
[1:06:59] you know we we're not going to go get
[1:07:01] into that tonight but the inspiration
[1:07:03] strikes and you just kind of have to go
[1:07:04] with it but he hates the two books in
[1:07:06] the Bible the most Genesis and
[1:07:08] Revelation Genesis talks about his his
[1:07:10] beginning and how he entered into the
[1:07:12] human race and Revelation talks about
[1:07:15] the ending of
[1:07:16] it but he says it's the last book of the
[1:07:18] Bible yet it tells the beginning and end
[1:07:20] of the dispensations of the Gospel the
[1:07:23] reation of Jesus Christ he says now the
[1:07:26] Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse
[1:07:30] which means
[1:07:31] unveiling this unveiling is perfectly
[1:07:34] described in the example of a sculptor
[1:07:38] unveiling his work of
[1:07:41] statutary statutary exposing it to the
[1:07:46] onlooker it is an
[1:07:48] uncovering revealing what was previously
[1:07:52] hidden now if anybody hasn't heard it
[1:07:55] brother Brandon preaches two messages
[1:07:58] and I believe they're uh there I can't
[1:08:00] remember exactly what year it is it
[1:08:02] might be 64 63 the unveiling of God and
[1:08:06] then he preaches the Mighty God unveiled
[1:08:09] and he says in one of those messages
[1:08:12] sometimes God will actually say things
[1:08:15] without coming right out and saying it
[1:08:17] all the way to what it is he leaves room
[1:08:20] for us to interpret it he will say it
[1:08:22] without actually saying saying it all
[1:08:24] the way it's important for us to
[1:08:26] understand that's what the prophet was
[1:08:28] actually doing he was actually voicing
[1:08:31] for God that God is actually unveiling
[1:08:35] himself we heard it in the song tonight
[1:08:37] he's here brother bradam declared that
[1:08:40] he's here he's not coming he's already
[1:08:44] here it's
[1:08:47] beautiful but this is the unveiling
[1:08:51] amen it's an uncovering
[1:08:54] revealing what was previously hidden now
[1:08:57] the uncovering is not only the
[1:08:59] revelation of the person of Christ but
[1:09:03] it is the revelation of his Future Works
[1:09:07] in the oncoming seven Church ages I
[1:09:10] wanted to see if that was actually uh
[1:09:12] capitalized there because it is in mine
[1:09:15] I think it's important for us to catch
[1:09:17] that the revelation of his Future Works
[1:09:19] in the oncoming seven Church ages and
[1:09:21] you know we have actually seen the end
[1:09:24] or the blend whichever way you would
[1:09:26] like to say it of the leoan church age
[1:09:29] which is the last one we've got into
[1:09:32] another age brother Bram said it it's a
[1:09:33] bride Age and and we're not actually
[1:09:36] looking at our lives as one of these
[1:09:39] Church ages we've actually gone beyond
[1:09:41] that and we'll never go beyond the word
[1:09:43] of a prophet just for the record when I
[1:09:44] say go beyond that we've gone beyond
[1:09:46] where we can see all of the church ages
[1:09:49] maybe I'll bring the the the pyramid and
[1:09:51] we'll show um the layers in it but we
[1:09:54] showed it I I've talked about it many
[1:09:56] times in the past but we're still going
[1:09:58] to do that I need maybe someone to help
[1:10:00] me with that I'm not that great with
[1:10:02] computers but you know how we have the
[1:10:04] the the pyramid and then we actually
[1:10:07] show that there's an end of the pyramid
[1:10:09] at the Le oysan Church age and then we
[1:10:12] show the next pyramid coming down the
[1:10:14] Capstone we call it and that is actually
[1:10:17] God himself love you know I believe we
[1:10:20] can take those two and put them together
[1:10:21] this is just my view we can put those
[1:10:24] together and make them one we've already
[1:10:26] seen the Capstone Ministry of this word
[1:10:29] if he's here there's no space brothers
[1:10:31] and sisters between him and the bride
[1:10:35] between him and the stature of that
[1:10:37] perfect man there's no space in between
[1:10:39] I remember brother meno saying there's
[1:10:41] no mortar between that Capstone when it
[1:10:43] comes down right it's the revelation of
[1:10:46] his Future Works in the oncoming seven
[1:10:49] Church
[1:10:50] ages it's as far as I'm going to read in
[1:10:52] that tonight I have a a bunch of quotes
[1:10:54] and I have one thought that I really
[1:10:56] want to try and actually get into
[1:10:58] tonight and and it's important I believe
[1:11:00] it's very very important for us to
[1:11:02] recognize you know out of out of the
[1:11:05] scripture that we read tonight I believe
[1:11:06] it's in uh Revelations 1:1 there's a
[1:11:10] word signify in there it's it's strongs
[1:11:12] G
[1:11:13] 4591 and and it's a real simple simple
[1:11:17] one it says to indicate I think it's
[1:11:20] just important for us to talk about
[1:11:21] these things he sent and signified it by
[1:11:25] his angel or he sent and indicated it by
[1:11:28] his Angel unto his servant John this is
[1:11:31] the strong concordance for the King
[1:11:33] James version it's it's important to to
[1:11:36] see sometimes the meaning of these words
[1:11:38] it's used twice signified in the King
[1:11:42] James version of the Bible there's
[1:11:44] signify it's used many times but
[1:11:48] signified it means that it was already
[1:11:50] done he indicated it to his to his Angel
[1:11:54] unto his servant
[1:11:57] John um and I just wanted to bring
[1:12:00] another scripture just acts 11 the other
[1:12:02] one that's in the Bible Acts 11:28 and
[1:12:04] there stood up one of them named agabus
[1:12:07] and
[1:12:08] signified by the spirit or indicated by
[1:12:12] the spirit that there should be a great
[1:12:14] dir throughout all the world which came
[1:12:16] to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar
[1:12:18] and we know that the scripture if you
[1:12:19] want to read it maybe you don't know it
[1:12:21] it goes on to say that they actually got
[1:12:23] together and they helped the People by
[1:12:25] Barnabas and by Paul they actually
[1:12:27] helped feed the people that were
[1:12:28] starving in that time the point is that
[1:12:31] signified is the exact same word used in
[1:12:34] both scriptures and it's the exact same
[1:12:36] word in the Strong's Concordance it is
[1:12:38] g45 91 means to indicate but I think in
[1:12:42] Acts 11 here it just sort of uh kind of
[1:12:45] underscores or highlights the point that
[1:12:47] I want to get to it was signified by the
[1:12:50] spirit it wasn't signified by the church
[1:12:52] it wasn't signified ifed by John it
[1:12:54] wasn't signified by Paul it wasn't
[1:12:56] signified by anyone else other than the
[1:12:59] spirit and I think that's just such an
[1:13:01] important thing it's so beautiful and
[1:13:03] you know that's what has to happen in
[1:13:05] the life of a Believer we can't talk
[1:13:07] about this without preaching a little
[1:13:08] bit can we
[1:13:10] amen it has to be in the life of a
[1:13:13] Believer he has to come and indicate it
[1:13:16] in our lives himself that we have seen
[1:13:20] this gospel that it's been revealed to
[1:13:22] us that we understand understand what's
[1:13:24] going on in our day maybe we don't
[1:13:26] understand all of it but we have an
[1:13:29] understanding that God has come to talk
[1:13:30] to us personally and when we have that
[1:13:33] understanding brothers and sisters then
[1:13:35] we follow the word it's our desire when
[1:13:37] we follow the word we get the Holy Ghost
[1:13:39] when we get the Holy Ghost he the spirit
[1:13:41] of truth comes by and what he signifies
[1:13:44] it to us personally he indicates to us
[1:13:47] that this is correct amen amen you know
[1:13:51] Romans 8:15 for you have not received
[1:13:53] the spirit of bondage again to fear have
[1:13:57] you anybody afraid tonight if you're
[1:14:00] afraid if we're afraid it's a spirit and
[1:14:03] it wants to take us into bondage to say
[1:14:06] that oh no we can't let go and and
[1:14:08] worship or oh no we can't let go and and
[1:14:11] and and get into this thing that we're
[1:14:13] talking about here if that's what's
[1:14:14] going on it's a spirit brothers and
[1:14:17] sisters maybe it's just a spirit of fear
[1:14:19] that would say you know I don't know I
[1:14:21] feel like my whole life is going to
[1:14:23] collapse maybe the bank is going to come
[1:14:25] and take my house maybe I'm going to
[1:14:28] lose my job maybe I don't know what's
[1:14:31] going to happen tomorrow maybe the whole
[1:14:32] world's going to come to an end maybe I
[1:14:34] need to store up a whole bunch of food
[1:14:36] because we could have a war here in
[1:14:38] Canada you know what the devil wants us
[1:14:40] to be afraid but he's the one that's
[1:14:42] afraid the Bride of Jesus Christ ain't
[1:14:45] afraid she knows where she stands
[1:14:49] amen you have not received the spirit of
[1:14:51] bondage again to fear no way no way you
[1:14:54] have received the spirit of adoption and
[1:14:56] that Spirit of adoption causes us to cry
[1:14:59] ABA father gives us the ability to
[1:15:02] worship him because the spirit itself
[1:15:05] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:15:07] are the children of God we can get our
[1:15:10] new spirit and we can
[1:15:12] try but you know what will happen is
[1:15:15] eventually our old man will rise up in
[1:15:18] our life and actually have control our
[1:15:21] old man will rise up and say nope
[1:15:23] you know what something's not right in
[1:15:25] there and we'll go back and we'll say
[1:15:28] Lord help me but you know I want to say
[1:15:30] this if we do have that cycle in our
[1:15:33] lives he is the chain breaker he is the
[1:15:36] cycle breaker when his Spirit gets into
[1:15:39] our lives the Holy
[1:15:42] Spirit it Bears witness his Spirit
[1:15:45] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:15:48] are the children of God amen amen going
[1:15:52] somewhere with this tonight it's not not
[1:15:53] about just maybe saying that we need to
[1:15:55] make sure that we we we line up a
[1:15:57] certain way even though we do but what I
[1:15:59] want to say tonight is the spirit bearth
[1:16:01] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:16:03] children of God and that we believe the
[1:16:05] word of God and that we believe the
[1:16:07] message of the hour and that's what I'm
[1:16:09] getting at tonight I'm really trying to
[1:16:10] underscore the exposition of the seven
[1:16:12] Church ages as we go with this I I'm
[1:16:14] just going to preach a little bit the
[1:16:17] the other word in there that I wanted to
[1:16:19] bring out was the angel he came and
[1:16:21] signified it by his Angel unto his
[1:16:24] servant John in
[1:16:27] g32 in the Strong's
[1:16:29] Concordance that word is
[1:16:33] Angelos and it sounds pretty
[1:16:35] straightforward it's derived from g71
[1:16:37] compared with g34 to bring Tidings a
[1:16:41] messenger especially An Angel by
[1:16:45] implication this one made me a little
[1:16:47] bit weak in the knees by implication a
[1:16:51] pastor Angel mess
[1:16:53] messenger I heard somebody mention this
[1:16:56] and uh I I didn't really know what to
[1:16:59] think about it so I had to look it up
[1:17:00] myself if anybody is interested you can
[1:17:02] look it up in the message brother
[1:17:03] brandham says that a pastor an ordained
[1:17:05] Pastor is an angel messenger that one
[1:17:08] just about put me on the floor because I
[1:17:10] don't feel like an angel
[1:17:12] messenger I don't but you know what
[1:17:14] feelings have nothing to do with it if
[1:17:17] God's called someone and there's been a
[1:17:18] vote for that person and the majority
[1:17:20] vote is for that person then you know
[1:17:22] what that's God speaking in the midst
[1:17:23] that's what the prophet of God said
[1:17:25] that's the way it works so if that's the
[1:17:27] case then I say Lord just be it unto me
[1:17:29] according to Thy word just let let let
[1:17:32] your spirit come and bear witness uh
[1:17:34] signify it indicate it to us that that's
[1:17:37] what you've got going on here and I just
[1:17:39] think it's so beautiful because really
[1:17:41] my desire brothers and sisters is to
[1:17:42] point to Christ don't point to me don't
[1:17:45] Don't point to this church don't point
[1:17:46] to anyone else don't don't don't point
[1:17:49] to Jeffersonville point to Christ
[1:17:51] because if brother bradam was
[1:17:53] Jeffersonville tonight he would say
[1:17:55] point to Christ that's what the prophet
[1:17:57] of God would
[1:17:59] say in
[1:18:00] 1950 obey the voice of the Angel it's
[1:18:05] 1950
[1:18:08] 0713 were you able to get
[1:18:11] them we can go
[1:18:17] slow someone said not long ago to
[1:18:21] me said brother
[1:18:26] Adam almost
[1:18:32] there someone said not long ago to me
[1:18:35] said brother brandham Angels was
[1:18:38] ministering spirits in the Old Testament
[1:18:40] but since the Holy Spirit has come we
[1:18:42] don't have ministering Angels anymore he
[1:18:46] says now dear friends this is not a
[1:18:48] worship of angels understand we do not
[1:18:51] believe in worship shiing
[1:18:53] Angels there's only one to be worshiped
[1:18:56] and that's God Amen and his son our Holy
[1:19:01] Spirit No Angel no not no
[1:19:05] man or No Angel to be worshiped and now
[1:19:10] the angel of God a true angel of God
[1:19:14] would not stand still to be worshiped
[1:19:18] right we're going to talk about this a
[1:19:20] little bit tonight an angel of God will
[1:19:23] not stand to be worshiped I heard
[1:19:25] something that blew me away today I
[1:19:27] heard that there's people that actually
[1:19:30] have their Pastor the pastor comes to
[1:19:32] the pulpit being carried to the pulpit
[1:19:35] could you believe
[1:19:36] that that just shocked me it's people
[1:19:41] worshiping a minister worshiping a
[1:19:44] pastor elevating something to to to
[1:19:47] somewhere they don't want to be and I
[1:19:49] personally believe I think we read a
[1:19:50] quote a little while ago brother bradam
[1:19:51] says it's not the person
[1:19:53] it's the
[1:19:54] people the people do it it's
[1:19:59] terrible but what's that Pastor
[1:20:02] saying what's that what's that teacher
[1:20:05] teaching what's that evangelist
[1:20:08] evangelizing because brother Ram says it
[1:20:10] very clearly just give it the word test
[1:20:11] if you want to know what's right give it
[1:20:13] the word test and see what that what
[1:20:14] that comes back like amen out of 1950
[1:20:18] obey the voice of the Angel it's
[1:20:20] paragraph
[1:20:21] 12 we know that Paul had the Holy Spirit
[1:20:25] do you believe
[1:20:26] that well when he was 14 days and nights
[1:20:29] upon the
[1:20:32] sea without any moon or
[1:20:35] stars and it was all dark and he went
[1:20:38] down in the gallery to pray he come back
[1:20:41] and told the men be of a good courage
[1:20:44] for the angel of God whose servant I am
[1:20:47] came to me last night and said fear not
[1:20:49] Paul is that right not the Holy Spirit
[1:20:52] the angel of God see an angel of God
[1:20:56] sent from God and then John and then
[1:21:01] John the Revelator the whole book of
[1:21:02] Revelation when it was wrote he said I
[1:21:04] have sent my angel Jesus did and John
[1:21:07] fell down to worship the angel but the
[1:21:10] angel said stand up worship God see a
[1:21:14] true true angel of God won't stand to be
[1:21:19] worshiped
[1:21:21] right I'll just say it again A True True
[1:21:25] angel of God won't stand to be
[1:21:28] worshiped and he said that he was of the
[1:21:32] prophets and his fellow men that had
[1:21:34] been sent to signify these
[1:21:37] things therefore Angelic beings is
[1:21:40] ordained ministers of God to come to the
[1:21:42] Earth to Bear record of God and they
[1:21:46] work through mortal beings just as they
[1:21:49] did through Daniel and back through the
[1:21:51] ages there and I believe it with all my
[1:21:54] heart and we know as Believers that
[1:21:57] there's times where there's
[1:21:59] angels that have wings we know the Bible
[1:22:03] talks about angels I believe it's the
[1:22:05] seraphim I could be wrong they've got
[1:22:07] six wings two to cover their face two to
[1:22:10] cover their feet to show
[1:22:13] reverence and two to fly and their
[1:22:16] commission is to fly Before the Throne
[1:22:19] day and night and cry holy holy holy art
[1:22:23] thou oh Lord God
[1:22:26] Almighty but there's also angels that
[1:22:28] are referred to in the Bible as men many
[1:22:31] times people see angels and they
[1:22:35] referred to as
[1:22:36] Angels but they say they met a man we
[1:22:39] know just one that comes to mind I don't
[1:22:41] have a whole bunch of examples tonight
[1:22:42] in the word but I just want to try and
[1:22:44] do it as quickly as I can and the little
[1:22:46] bit of time we have but we know Paul
[1:22:48] said that one time he met a man and
[1:22:51] whether he was in the Spirit or whether
[1:22:53] he was asleep or whether he was in a
[1:22:55] vision he doesn't know he was caught up
[1:22:58] into the third heaven was it and and he
[1:23:01] just didn't know what it was but he said
[1:23:03] he met a man how could a human being
[1:23:06] take someone into another dimension it
[1:23:08] doesn't happen it was a ministering
[1:23:11] Angel the example that I'm getting at is
[1:23:13] the Bible refers to angels as
[1:23:16] men
[1:23:18] men out of 1953 0603 God commissioned
[1:23:22] ing
[1:23:25] Moses true ministry will not accept
[1:23:29] worship true ministry will actually
[1:23:31] point to
[1:23:33] Christ and that's what the prophet of
[1:23:35] God said and I'll say it this way I
[1:23:37] always do this brothers and sisters has
[1:23:39] just become so real to me recently
[1:23:41] that's what God Said through the prophet
[1:23:44] many times we can say well that's what
[1:23:45] the prophet said and we just take it
[1:23:47] right out of God's hands and we make it
[1:23:49] into a human being and we know we're
[1:23:51] talking about man being Angels but you
[1:23:53] know what this is God's word that's
[1:23:55] coming to us through this man amen amen
[1:23:58] amen paragraph 8 now
[1:24:02] tonight God is still God is he still God
[1:24:05] tonight and now when God led the
[1:24:08] children of Israel out he brought down
[1:24:10] an an angel God is always using angels
[1:24:13] in his work there's never been an angel
[1:24:16] of God worshiped for he wouldn't stand
[1:24:19] for it a true angel of God God doesn't
[1:24:23] stand to be
[1:24:25] worshiped but God has had Angels through
[1:24:28] every
[1:24:31] dispensation true angel will never
[1:24:33] accept
[1:24:37] worship but isn't it interesting when we
[1:24:39] look
[1:24:40] at this this scripture that we read here
[1:24:42] in
[1:24:46] Revelation I I think it's just so
[1:24:50] beautiful verse 17 out of Revelations
[1:24:53] chapter 1 just keep that quote there too
[1:24:55] don't take it
[1:24:56] down but Revelations 1:1 17 says and
[1:25:00] when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[1:25:04] dead John did that a couple other times
[1:25:07] but not as dead but he did fall at
[1:25:10] others feet right when I saw him I fell
[1:25:13] at his feet as dead and he laid his
[1:25:16] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[1:25:18] not I am the first and the last this one
[1:25:22] didn't tell him don't worship this one
[1:25:26] explained who he was but the other two
[1:25:29] in Revelations said no no no no see thou
[1:25:32] do it not I you know what don't do it
[1:25:35] that's going to get us kicked out of
[1:25:36] here don't do that right worship
[1:25:39] god brother Ram says recently a man that
[1:25:43] belongs to a fine Full Gospel Church
[1:25:45] said to me brother branam said you keep
[1:25:48] speaking of an angel that visit you I I
[1:25:52] just just got into this and I thought
[1:25:53] it's so interesting so that's why that's
[1:25:55] why I'm reading it tonight I I just
[1:25:57] think it's important he said you keep
[1:26:00] speaking of an angel that visit you I
[1:26:01] read your books and so forth an angel
[1:26:03] said son that's an
[1:26:06] error I said sir it isn't he said God
[1:26:10] don't lead any church today by
[1:26:13] angels He
[1:26:15] said he said he Daniel and the prophets
[1:26:18] and them had angels in the Old Testament
[1:26:20] but the Holy Spirit leads the church
[1:26:22] Church in this last
[1:26:24] day I said that's true but they're still
[1:26:29] Angels right he said not New Testament
[1:26:33] doctorine brother Bram I said oh brother
[1:26:36] there sure sure there is I said do you
[1:26:39] believe that the Virgin Mary was in the
[1:26:41] New Testament when the angel Gabriel up
[1:26:45] there he said but that was before the
[1:26:47] Holy Spirit came I said then do you
[1:26:50] believe Phillip had the Holy Ghost he
[1:26:52] said yes I said who was it that told him
[1:26:56] down in Samaria to go to the desert Gaza
[1:27:00] for the unic of
[1:27:02] Ethiopia was it the Holy Spirit or the
[1:27:05] angel of the
[1:27:06] Lord it was the angel of the Lord not
[1:27:10] the holy spirit so I said do you believe
[1:27:13] that St Paul had the Holy Ghost he said
[1:27:17] sure do you believe Peter had the Holy
[1:27:19] Ghost he said sure
[1:27:22] I said then when Peter was in prison he
[1:27:25] had a prayer meeting at John Mark's
[1:27:27] house who was it that came into the bars
[1:27:31] like a light and shine down on him the
[1:27:35] angel of the Lord see who was it Paul
[1:27:38] after 14 days and nights with no moon
[1:27:40] stars or nothing to show and all hopes
[1:27:43] they'd ever be saved out on the Storm
[1:27:45] was ever give up and gone and Paul went
[1:27:49] down into the gallery and he after a
[1:27:51] while he returned turned and said be of
[1:27:53] a good cheer for the angel of God whose
[1:27:55] servant I am stood by me saying fear not
[1:27:59] Paul thou must be brought before Caesar
[1:28:02] and lo Gods give all them said wherefore
[1:28:05] Brethren I believe God and it shall be
[1:28:08] just as it was shown unto me and we know
[1:28:11] this story how that ship did crash and
[1:28:14] how everybody did go ashore and how it
[1:28:18] was such a terrible tragedy in that
[1:28:21] moment but imagine what kind of Peace
[1:28:23] would have come over Paul what kind of
[1:28:26] Peace would have come over the people on
[1:28:27] the ship to recognize that not one
[1:28:29] person's going to get
[1:28:31] lost and then we know the rest of the
[1:28:33] story parts of it anyways when they're
[1:28:35] on the shore now they're freezing cold
[1:28:37] trying to get warm and they build a fire
[1:28:39] Paul goes to throw on a stick and what
[1:28:41] happened a Viper jumps out and bites him
[1:28:44] and what did he do he flicked it and we
[1:28:46] know we've heard this story many times
[1:28:47] that was a terrible terrible snake and
[1:28:50] that snake would just inflict pain that
[1:28:52] would actually kill someone the Venom
[1:28:53] from that immediately almost immediately
[1:28:56] but what happened they saw that he was
[1:28:58] actually a man of God if it wasn't in
[1:29:00] the ship getting Shipwrecked seeing the
[1:29:02] angel of the
[1:29:04] Lord that would have changed their
[1:29:07] minds out of the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:29:10] in
[1:29:11] 1953
[1:29:16] 11:22 all this is talking about tonight
[1:29:20] we don't worship an angel we don't
[1:29:22] worship a messenger there's no human
[1:29:24] being on this planet before or after
[1:29:28] aside from Jesus Christ that gets
[1:29:30] worship any other spirit that would say
[1:29:34] any other thing we know that Paul said
[1:29:36] that'll be a cursed anyone that would
[1:29:38] come and preach anything different than
[1:29:40] what Paul
[1:29:43] said 1953 the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:29:47] 11:22 he says look the aisle over on the
[1:29:51] aisle of patmas the whole book of
[1:29:53] Revelations was revealed by an
[1:29:57] Angel I Jesus has sent my angel to show
[1:30:00] you things that'll shortly come to pass
[1:30:03] is that right the whole and John started
[1:30:06] to worship the
[1:30:08] angel but a true angel will never stand
[1:30:11] to be worshiped no sir he said worship
[1:30:14] God that's
[1:30:16] true oh there's false Angels true just
[1:30:20] like there's false spirit
[1:30:22] and so forth but a true angel of God
[1:30:24] will always point you to Jesus Christ
[1:30:28] yes
[1:30:31] sir Paul said if an angel from heaven
[1:30:35] can you imagine that sometimes it's good
[1:30:37] just to think about this if an angel
[1:30:39] from
[1:30:40] heaven would preach any other
[1:30:43] gospel because we know that there's
[1:30:45] other angels that are from Heaven that
[1:30:48] would come as angels of light right and
[1:30:51] they would preach another
[1:30:52] gospel because that's where all the
[1:30:54] Angels Came From if an angel from heaven
[1:30:56] would come and preach any other gospel
[1:30:58] then that which you've already heard let
[1:30:59] them be accursed is that right so
[1:31:02] watch so watch what the angel
[1:31:07] teaches and I just want to say it
[1:31:09] tonight brothers and sisters we we've
[1:31:11] said it already brother Bram has that
[1:31:13] quote I'm not bringing it tonight
[1:31:14] because it makes me feel uncomfortable
[1:31:15] truly to think that brother bradam would
[1:31:17] say that an ordained minister would be
[1:31:20] an actual ministering
[1:31:23] Angel but if a preacher is preaching
[1:31:26] anything other than what this message
[1:31:28] says than what brother brandham brought
[1:31:31] then it's wrong right he's preaching
[1:31:34] something different it's an uncertain
[1:31:36] sound brother branam talks about it I
[1:31:38] just had this inspiration it hit me a
[1:31:40] while ago but you know how brother
[1:31:42] bradam talks about it when they cast
[1:31:43] Bells they cast Bells out of bronze and
[1:31:47] brass and they're giant Bells some are
[1:31:49] giant some are small but they all have
[1:31:51] to be be tested once they're cast and
[1:31:54] and they're cooled the hot metal is
[1:31:55] poured and and and they cool they have
[1:31:57] to pull them out of the molds and
[1:31:59] they've got a bang them to test them and
[1:32:01] if there's a crack or a blemish in that
[1:32:04] Bell it won't ring true and we know that
[1:32:07] we have to take what we hear and it's
[1:32:09] got to be rung and we've got to be able
[1:32:11] to say it resounds correctly we have to
[1:32:14] hear that certain sound and if we don't
[1:32:16] we need to make sure that we can just
[1:32:18] push it aside but we've got to know
[1:32:20] where we stand
[1:32:22] amen watch what that angel
[1:32:25] teaches if it's anything other than what
[1:32:27] William Mary and bradam said then push
[1:32:29] it aside brothers and sisters don't say
[1:32:32] that there's maybe another Vindication
[1:32:34] maybe we've got a sign maybe we saw a
[1:32:36] healing maybe we see a great ministry
[1:32:38] maybe we've got a a a great thing going
[1:32:40] on it doesn't matter if it's an angel
[1:32:42] from heaven that preaches a different
[1:32:44] gospel right that's what Paul said so I
[1:32:48] don't know how we could get any greater
[1:32:50] than that on Earth amen or
[1:32:54] fascinating Paul said if an angel from
[1:32:56] heaven will come preach any of the
[1:32:58] gospel and that which you've already
[1:32:58] heard let him be a cursed is that right
[1:33:01] so watch what the angel
[1:33:05] teaches if it's bringing along in the
[1:33:07] gospel and sound Doctrine and everything
[1:33:09] according to the Bible then believe it
[1:33:12] amen but how are you going to know if
[1:33:15] you don't have the Holy Ghost in your
[1:33:16] life how are you going to know if you
[1:33:19] don't read the Bible how you going know
[1:33:22] if you don't listen to the message of
[1:33:23] the
[1:33:24] hour says so God always sends Angelic
[1:33:27] beings to warn the
[1:33:30] world I believe that there's Angelic
[1:33:33] beings in the Earth
[1:33:36] today isn't that amazing to think about
[1:33:40] what he's saying there I believe there's
[1:33:42] Angelic beings in the Earth
[1:33:45] today did they just disappear when he
[1:33:48] disappeared I believe there's Angelic
[1:33:51] beings in in the Earth today he didn't
[1:33:53] say I'm the only Angelic being in the
[1:33:56] Earth today that's
[1:33:59] right I believe there's Angelic beings
[1:34:02] in the Earth today are warning the world
[1:34:05] of judgment to come I could go a little
[1:34:07] bit go on a little bit about your flying
[1:34:10] saucer here for just a few minutes but I
[1:34:12] won't take that much time but I
[1:34:16] will I just want to press pause brothers
[1:34:18] and sisters we know the world is blowing
[1:34:20] up over in the Middle East
[1:34:22] one of the news headlines I saw I'm
[1:34:23] sorry I'm looking at news again I just I
[1:34:26] I can see what's going on but you know
[1:34:28] one of the things I saw was that UFO
[1:34:31] sightings are up in the United
[1:34:33] States and we're watching this War break
[1:34:36] out over in Israel what's going on yes
[1:34:40] we know what's going on brother bradam
[1:34:42] said those are investigating judgment
[1:34:46] angels and they're coming down to see
[1:34:49] what's going on I'll continue on reading
[1:34:51] here that's the only thing I'm going to
[1:34:52] say about it brothers and sisters this
[1:34:54] this whole earth is
[1:34:57] shaking he says I could go a little bit
[1:34:59] on your flying saucery here for just a
[1:35:01] few minutes but I won't take that much
[1:35:03] time but anyhow did you notice before
[1:35:06] the destruction of Sodom and gomorah
[1:35:08] which is a perfect thing of
[1:35:11] today God sent Angels down there to call
[1:35:14] lot out is that true
[1:35:17] amen I'll just say it what the word of
[1:35:19] God says come out of her my people
[1:35:21] and be ye not partakers of her
[1:35:26] sins he says look just before the coming
[1:35:29] of the righteous one the great Son of
[1:35:31] God God sent an angel down and that
[1:35:33] angel come to a home that was a
[1:35:36] respected
[1:35:38] home if you want angels to visit your
[1:35:41] home be like zachariah's home amen I
[1:35:45] believe we could just preach a whole
[1:35:47] entire sermon on that right there I I
[1:35:50] heard that and I thought my
[1:35:52] I want my home to be like that don't you
[1:35:55] want your home to be like that brothers
[1:35:57] and sisters brother brandom talks about
[1:35:59] fasting and praying and how the angel of
[1:36:01] the Lord would come and visit him when
[1:36:03] he would fast and pray it's just really
[1:36:05] impressed upon my heart I want the angel
[1:36:07] of the Lord in my home and you know one
[1:36:09] of the best ways we can do it is to
[1:36:11] apply the
[1:36:12] token don't go and get a chicken and get
[1:36:15] some blood and try and do it it's not
[1:36:16] going to do it just take the word of God
[1:36:19] for your day take the message of the
[1:36:21] hour and see if that token doesn't come
[1:36:23] into your
[1:36:24] home he says look just before the coming
[1:36:27] of the righteous one the great Son of
[1:36:28] God God sent an angel down and that
[1:36:31] angel come to a home that was a
[1:36:32] respected home if you want angels to
[1:36:35] visit your home be like zachariah's home
[1:36:38] him and Sarah was living upright before
[1:36:40] the Lord and we know that probably Sarah
[1:36:44] wasn't married to Zacharias
[1:36:47] but anyways um he says him and Sarah was
[1:36:50] living upright before the Lord keeping
[1:36:52] all the statutes and all the
[1:36:53] Commandments of the Lord living in
[1:36:55] perfect obedience to the word and in the
[1:36:58] light that they had and Zacharias his
[1:37:02] office was to wave incense burning
[1:37:04] incense at the altar while the people
[1:37:07] were
[1:37:08] praying and we know that an angel came
[1:37:10] and Stood Beside the altar while he was
[1:37:13] there this is Elizabeth's husband for
[1:37:15] anyone that maybe doesn't know and
[1:37:17] Zacharias his office was to wave incense
[1:37:19] burning incense at the altar while the
[1:37:21] people were praying and while he was
[1:37:23] waving this incense standing on the
[1:37:25] right hand side of the altar stood
[1:37:28] Gabriel the great
[1:37:31] Archangel now angels can come I love
[1:37:34] this part but when you hear of Gabriel
[1:37:37] coming be ready something major is on
[1:37:40] the
[1:37:41] road Gabriel announced the first coming
[1:37:44] of Jesus and Gabriel will announce the
[1:37:48] second coming of Jesus that's right amen
[1:37:51] how is that going to happen what is that
[1:37:53] going to look like this this got me
[1:37:56] pondering for hours this afternoon
[1:37:58] what's that going to look like brothers
[1:37:59] and
[1:38:01] sisters I'm not going to say one way or
[1:38:04] the other I know there's going to be two
[1:38:05] witnesses that are going to
[1:38:07] come but Gabriel's going to announce
[1:38:12] it I just think it's
[1:38:14] amazing the angels are talked about it
[1:38:18] was an angel of the Lord that came came
[1:38:21] and actually showed John his servant
[1:38:25] came and indicated came and signified
[1:38:28] this word to his servant
[1:38:32] John and I just think it's so beautiful
[1:38:35] because we've had an angel in our day
[1:38:36] haven't we who has come and indicated
[1:38:39] and signified that this message of this
[1:38:42] hour is the true word of God for us in
[1:38:45] our day and I just think it's fantastic
[1:38:49] that's why I'm just dwelling on it I I I
[1:38:51] don't know we'll get in back into it
[1:38:52] here uh don't
[1:38:55] worry got five minutes left 1958 0214
[1:39:00] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:39:02] and forever
[1:39:04] amen we have his picture here on paper
[1:39:06] he says many of you have seen it might
[1:39:10] we we don't have time to tell you of it
[1:39:14] that's not my
[1:39:15] picture isn't that
[1:39:17] beautiful we have the prophet of God
[1:39:19] saying that's not my picture
[1:39:21] what's what's this man doing what's this
[1:39:24] angel doing he's actually separating
[1:39:27] himself and saying don't look at me look
[1:39:29] at him amen that light you see ain't me
[1:39:33] that light is not a gift that God gave
[1:39:35] me that that light is him that's with me
[1:39:39] he says we don't have time to tell you
[1:39:40] of it that's not my picture I'm your
[1:39:42] brother but it's been questioned what
[1:39:45] was that to me it was the same God that
[1:39:48] led the children of Israel by a pillar
[1:39:50] of Fire
[1:39:51] fire we all know that that was the logos
[1:39:55] that the angel of the Covenant which was
[1:39:57] Christ that led the children of Israel
[1:40:00] Christ declared it to be so he said he
[1:40:03] was the I am that was in the burning
[1:40:05] bush and he was the rock that was in the
[1:40:10] wilderness don't you just love reading
[1:40:12] the
[1:40:13] messag isn't it wonderful I know some
[1:40:16] people would say just paron the prophet
[1:40:18] I say Amen I'm going to be a real good
[1:40:22] parrot he said he was the I am that was
[1:40:25] in the burning bush and he was the rock
[1:40:28] that was in the wilderness that Pillar
[1:40:30] of Fire was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:40:33] Us and when he was here he said I come
[1:40:37] from God and I go back to God and after
[1:40:40] his death burial and Resurrection when
[1:40:42] he appeared to Paul on the road to
[1:40:43] Damascus he had again the same logos in
[1:40:47] a pillar of fire manifesting himself and
[1:40:50] remember Paul said said who is it Lord
[1:40:53] isn't it interesting that he knew that
[1:40:55] the light was so bright that it put
[1:40:57] Paul's eyes out yet those standing by
[1:40:59] couldn't see it it was a reality to
[1:41:02] those who God would reveal it to but the
[1:41:06] others who stood by didn't know nothing
[1:41:09] about
[1:41:10] it just like the seventh seal he says
[1:41:14] they don't know nothing about it just
[1:41:16] like that A Blank Spot on the tape and
[1:41:19] he said I'm Jesus did the bible say that
[1:41:21] I am Jesus and it's hard for you to kick
[1:41:25] against the Pricks he came in as a
[1:41:26] pillar of fire and delivered Peter out
[1:41:29] of the fiery
[1:41:31] furnace says I've Heard lots of things
[1:41:33] about angels we read of Joseph Smith we
[1:41:36] know that but a true angel of God will
[1:41:40] bear record with the word of God and he
[1:41:44] will never move from the word and that
[1:41:47] my friends my brothers my sisters is why
[1:41:49] I par the prophet
[1:41:51] cuz you know what maybe someone would
[1:41:54] say that that description could fit me I
[1:41:56] wouldn't say that it would but if if if
[1:42:00] I find myself in that position as a
[1:42:02] ministering
[1:42:04] Angel it just sounds weird but if that's
[1:42:08] the case I'll say this I know I've got
[1:42:10] nothing else to say am I want to say
[1:42:13] what he said and that's all I want to
[1:42:16] say cuz there's no new
[1:42:18] revelation the only thing is the
[1:42:20] revelation of the entirety of what he's
[1:42:22] already
[1:42:25] said I just love it he says but a true
[1:42:28] angel of God will bear record with the
[1:42:29] word of God and he'll never move from
[1:42:31] the word of
[1:42:33] God and you know what's interesting
[1:42:35] because Paul himself even identified
[1:42:37] himself as an angel he referenced
[1:42:40] himself as an angel I'll call the
[1:42:42] musicians as we close tonight on study
[1:42:45] of the exposition of the seven Church
[1:42:47] ages just wanted to set the background
[1:42:50] just just really slowly go through this
[1:42:53] as I've mentioned over and over again
[1:42:55] amen we're not worshiping a man and
[1:42:59] we're not worshiping an Angel that's
[1:43:01] right he wasn't worshiping a man and he
[1:43:04] wasn't encouraging worshiping a man or
[1:43:06] an angel when he wrote this book when he
[1:43:09] was the Scribe of this book he was
[1:43:11] saying worship God Amen and we'll read
[1:43:14] the last chapter of it maybe sooner than
[1:43:16] later but if you read it he says what
[1:43:18] his intentions are at the very last
[1:43:21] paragraph of this
[1:43:23] book but Paul in Galatians
[1:43:26] 4:14 and he says and my Temptation which
[1:43:30] was in my flesh ye despised not nor
[1:43:35] rejected but receive me as an angel of
[1:43:39] God even as Jesus
[1:43:42] Christ this
[1:43:44] verse got me stimulated and it does even
[1:43:47] now maybe stand with me as we close
[1:43:48] brothers and sisters can can we do this
[1:43:51] with one
[1:43:52] another this verse
[1:43:55] here if we can say I and my father are
[1:43:58] one amen can we say you and your father
[1:44:01] are one I I can see it in you I can see
[1:44:04] him in you you and your father are
[1:44:07] one that's right and whoever it is that
[1:44:11] we worship whatever it is that we feed
[1:44:13] on that's what we're going to be that's
[1:44:14] what we're going to show amen but can we
[1:44:17] look at ourselves and say my temptation
[1:44:20] we've all got our Temptation which was
[1:44:22] in our flesh we've all got this flesh
[1:44:24] and The Temptations the problems the
[1:44:26] issues that come along with all the
[1:44:29] genetics it says Paul in his temptation
[1:44:34] which was in his flesh you despise not
[1:44:37] nor rejected are we able to do that
[1:44:39] despise not or reject the Flesh in our
[1:44:42] brother or our sister my goodness even a
[1:44:46] and received those people even as an
[1:44:49] angel of God
[1:44:51] even as Jesus
[1:44:54] Christ I think that's just that's a lot
[1:44:57] to take
[1:44:58] in that's a lot to take in I have so
[1:45:01] much more to get
[1:45:04] into I'll read one more quote we're okay
[1:45:07] for five minutes
[1:45:10] yes 1958 0223 Jesus Christ the same
[1:45:14] yesterday today forever he says the
[1:45:16] angel of God paragraph 51 the angel of
[1:45:19] God whose picture is back there if it
[1:45:20] doesn't bear record of Christ then it's
[1:45:23] a wrong
[1:45:24] Angel yeah that about Joseph Smith
[1:45:27] seeing an angel it didn't bear the
[1:45:29] record of Christ but a true angel of God
[1:45:33] will bear the record of Christ a true
[1:45:36] grape vine will bear grapes and a true
[1:45:40] spirit of God will manifest Jesus Christ
[1:45:44] if it doesn't then then it don't answer
[1:45:47] to the urum Thum and we know the urum
[1:45:49] Thum is this right here
[1:45:51] the urum th out of the Old Testament is
[1:45:53] actually the the thing that the high
[1:45:55] priest wore that Aaron wore and we know
[1:45:57] that it had the gems on it and when
[1:46:00] someone had a vision or a prophecy they
[1:46:03] spoke it before that urum th they
[1:46:05] brought them before that and if it
[1:46:07] flashed then it was true if it if it
[1:46:09] resonated like ringing that Bell if it
[1:46:11] had that sure sound then it was correct
[1:46:14] but if it didn't Flash and it had a a
[1:46:16] vibration in it if it sounded a little
[1:46:18] bit off then it was off and they just
[1:46:19] left it alone
[1:46:21] he talking about the ear Thum here true
[1:46:24] spirit of God will manifest Jesus Christ
[1:46:28] if it
[1:46:29] doesn't then it don't answer to the Yum
[1:46:31] thumb then it doesn't answer to the word
[1:46:32] of God then it doesn't line up with the
[1:46:33] word and we just leave it alone amen we
[1:46:36] don't go and talk about it we don't go
[1:46:37] and persecute it we just leave it alone
[1:46:39] step aside and just pray for that
[1:46:41] brother pray for that sister pray for
[1:46:42] that maybe Oh My Angel sometimes pastors
[1:46:46] can get off a little bit yes the humans
