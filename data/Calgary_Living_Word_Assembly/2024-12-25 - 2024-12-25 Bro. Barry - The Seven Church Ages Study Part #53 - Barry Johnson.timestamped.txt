[43:50] tumor and uh was given a terrible
[43:55] prognosis by the doctor
[43:58] they did an emergency operation and then
[44:02] he went back for a followup right after
[44:04] and they said now there's an
[44:06] infection so we want to remember Jesse
[44:10] honton and
[44:12] specifically that he would get well when
[44:16] the doctors would present death there is
[44:19] someone that can present life
[44:21] amen and I'll I'll I'll just share with
[44:23] you my desire is to be able to get
[44:26] together with him
[44:27] and express this gospel to him that
[44:30] there is a living God
[44:32] Amen and I'd also like to remember my
[44:35] Shan my cousin
[44:36] Shannon she uh is suffering from
[44:39] something the doctors can't put their
[44:41] finger on and uh once again it would
[44:44] sure be nice for her to see the power of
[44:47] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[44:49] Christ we know that he could heal amen
[44:52] let's just go to him in prayer tonight
[44:54] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we

[51:21] church tonight father Lord help us each
[51:24] one to just get out of the way and just
[51:26] give you
[51:27] the preeminence that you desire father
[51:29] through the speaker and the hearer alike
[51:31] we just want to commit all the words
[51:32] that are spoken now the scripture that
[51:34] we've read into your hands in Jesus
[51:37] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[51:40] tonight you may be seated isn't it
[51:42] wonderful to think that alls we have to
[51:44] do is just open the door just be zealous
[51:48] and repent that's all we need to do not
[51:52] be be Brazen and bold and have a PR that
[51:57] says I'm good I I don't need to do
[51:59] anything I can just stay the way I am
[52:02] right it's just wonderful to think that
[52:04] he gives us correction and we know that
[52:07] the correction that he gives us is what
[52:08] we need and uh the way we receive that
[52:11] correction is how we show whose child we
[52:15] really are amen we know that Cain and
[52:18] Abel they both had a revelation they
[52:21] both went to church they both
[52:24] worshiped one brought a worship worship
[52:27] according to his Revelation another
[52:30] brought a worship according to his
[52:32] Revelation whose Revelation was
[52:35] right you know both of them were
[52:38] Revelations and even though one was
[52:40] wrong one wasn't accepted there was
[52:42] correction brought and the correction is
[52:45] what showed who was who
[52:48] amen it's a tremendous thing because we
[52:51] can all have Revelation but it's the
[52:53] correction that brings the truth amen
[52:57] it's wonderful I just love this uh
[52:59] scripture we're into the leoan church
[53:02] age um we would say probably many ways
[53:05] that this is our church age and we know
[53:08] that this started in sort of Our
[53:10] Generation we know that this applies to
[53:13] us in the age in which we live there's a
[53:14] lot of wealth there's never been this
[53:16] much wealth being transferred in in
[53:18] modern history there's never been so
[53:21] much opportunity there's never been so
[53:24] much um I would say probably exposure
[53:29] around the world for what people are
[53:30] doing and everybody wants to behave the
[53:33] same way we live in a sort of a global
[53:35] Community now because of all of the
[53:38] social all of the online stuff and uh
[53:42] you know we we can look at this this
[53:44] scripture and say that that's where we
[53:45] are I I think it's beautiful though
[53:47] because you know I'm just going to
[53:49] preach a little I hope that's okay
[53:50] tonight I'm probably not going to try to
[53:53] keep us late I I recognize this is
[53:55] Christmas and for some it's it's
[53:57] probably the only day off the only
[53:59] holiday that you have I just wanted to
[54:01] make sure that we had the doors open if
[54:03] there were people that wanted to come to
[54:05] church we could gather together in
[54:06] Fellowship I also understand that we
[54:08] have commitments with families and
[54:10] that's okay too God richly bless you
[54:13] each one but looking at this scripture
[54:15] in Revelations chapter 3 is a beautiful
[54:18] thing because it is the leoan church age
[54:21] talking about the last of the seven
[54:23] Church ages the seventh age which is a
[54:25] culmination of all the ages and we could
[54:27] say that's where we live but we know
[54:29] that at the end of the ministry in the
[54:31] life of the Vindicated Prophet that we
[54:33] follow he began to speak different words
[54:36] he did not talk about staying in the
[54:38] leodan church age he spoke about another
[54:42] age and that is the bride age amen he
[54:45] spoke about moving into the bride age
[54:47] and I I think probably we're going to
[54:49] wind up preaching about this in the near
[54:50] future but if you turn the page in your
[54:52] Bible or you just go to the next chapter
[54:55] the very next word after where we left
[54:57] off in Revelations 3: 22 Revelations CH
[55:02] 4 it says after this I look John being a
[55:05] type of the bride and behold a door was
[55:08] opened in
[55:10] heaven and we know this door that was
[55:13] open in heaven why was it open in heaven
[55:15] the first voice which I heard was as it
[55:18] were of a trumpet talking with me said
[55:20] come up hither and I will show thee
[55:24] things which must be Hereafter and we
[55:27] know brother Bram talks about this very
[55:30] very clearly in the message of the hour
[55:31] and immediately I was in the spirit this
[55:34] is going right back to the very
[55:36] beginning of the church age book the
[55:39] exposition of the seven Church ages this
[55:40] bride age is calling a church out of a
[55:44] church it's calling a bride out of the
[55:47] the regular church that we would call
[55:50] the nominal Church on Earth and she's
[55:53] called to a greater Revelation according
[55:55] to the scripture here many people will
[55:57] look at it and say that John maybe he
[55:59] had a beach chair and he had some smart
[56:02] water and he was sitting on the beach
[56:04] having a good time on the aisle of
[56:06] patmas for the testimony of Jesus Christ
[56:09] but he wasn't sitting in a lawn chair on
[56:11] a beach somewhere he was suffering he
[56:14] was living in a cave in a den this is a
[56:16] place that more more desperate criminals
[56:19] were positionally placed when they
[56:21] didn't know what to do with them we know
[56:22] that John was boiled in oil for 24 hours
[56:25] trying to do way with this guy but God
[56:27] wasn't done with him yet because he had
[56:30] a a whole Revelation that he had to get
[56:32] into him that he had to express but he
[56:35] was told to come a little higher and I
[56:37] just think that's exactly the same for
[56:39] the bride Age The Bride of Jesus Christ
[56:43] isn't told to stay in the leodan church
[56:45] age amen amen we can look at this and
[56:48] say Well it applies to us we could be
[56:50] rich increase with Goods have need of
[56:51] nothing know us not that we're we're
[56:53] naked we're blind we're wretched we're
[56:55] poor we don't don't even know it but do
[56:58] we is that where we are brothers and
[57:00] sisters if that's where we are I think
[57:01] we've missed the message of the hour the
[57:03] message of the hour has become a
[57:05] traditional teaching to us we've been
[57:07] told to come a little higher and it
[57:09] doesn't make us better than anybody what
[57:10] it does is it gives us more humility
[57:13] because we recognize there's nothing
[57:14] that we did right he's done it all amen
[57:19] I probably shouldn't get preaching here
[57:22] but I just want to it's Christmas prise
[57:24] the Lord Merry Christmas amen let's
[57:26] begin talking about the leodan church
[57:28] age out of the exposition of the seven
[57:30] Church
[57:31] ages it's page 363 of the red book um
[57:36] the leodan church age and unto the angel
[57:39] of the Church of the leod Deans write
[57:42] these things saith amen the faithful and
[57:45] true witness the beginning of the
[57:47] creation of God as I was studying this I
[57:49] was just thinking isn't it wonderful to
[57:50] think that there's a faithful and true
[57:53] witness that's the bride today amen I
[57:56] Know Thy works that thou art neither
[57:58] cold nor hot I would thou work cold or
[58:02] hot so then because Thou Art
[58:04] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[58:07] spew thee out of my
[58:10] mouth because thou sayest I'm rich and
[58:12] increase with goods and have need of
[58:14] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[58:16] wretched and miserable and poor and
[58:19] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[58:22] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[58:24] mayest be rich and white rment that thou
[58:28] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[58:30] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[58:33] thine eyes with THV that thou mayest
[58:36] see as many as I love I rebuke and
[58:38] chasen be zealous therefore and repent
[58:41] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[58:43] any man hear my voice and open the door
[58:45] I will come into him and will Su with
[58:47] him and he with me to him that
[58:49] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[58:51] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[58:56] I'm set down with my father in his
[58:59] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[59:03] what the spirit saith unto the
[59:05] churches just beautiful the city of
[59:09] leoda the name leoda which means
[59:13] people's rights was very common and was
[59:16] given to several cities in honor of
[59:19] Royal ladies so named this city was one
[59:23] of the most politically important and
[59:26] financially flourishing cities in Asia
[59:31] Minor enormous amounts of
[59:34] property were bequeathed to the City by
[59:37] prominent
[59:38] citizens it was the seat of a great
[59:41] Medical School its people were
[59:44] distinguished in Arts and
[59:47] Sciences it was often called the
[59:49] Metropolis as it was the county seat for
[59:52] 25 other cities the pagan God worshiped
[59:57] there was Zeus in fact this city was
[1:00:01] once called diolis city of Zeus in honor
[1:00:05] of their God in the 4th Century an
[1:00:08] important Church Council was held there
[1:00:11] frequent earthquakes finally caused its
[1:00:14] complete
[1:00:16] abandonment how fitting were the
[1:00:18] characteristics of this last age to
[1:00:21] represent the age in which we now live
[1:00:24] for example they worshiped one God Zeus
[1:00:27] who was the chief and father of the
[1:00:30] Gods this forecast the 20th century one
[1:00:34] God father of us all religious premise
[1:00:38] that sets forth the Brotherhood of Man
[1:00:41] and is even now bringing together the
[1:00:44] Protestants Catholics Jews Hindus Etc
[1:00:50] with the intent with the intent that a
[1:00:53] mutual form of worship will increase
[1:00:55] inrease our love understanding and care
[1:00:59] of each other now I apologize because
[1:01:03] it's Christmas I just have to do
[1:01:05] something here bear with
[1:01:09] me I forgot to send an
[1:01:14] email I sent an email to you
[1:01:17] Logan I do
[1:01:19] apologize I did mean to send that but uh
[1:01:24] I just thought it would be interesting
[1:01:26] to just look at this tonight the
[1:01:28] Catholics and the Protestants are even
[1:01:31] now striving for and actually gaining
[1:01:34] ground in this Union with the avowed
[1:01:38] intent that all others will
[1:01:41] follow this very attitude was seen in
[1:01:44] the United Nations organization when the
[1:01:46] world leaders refused to recognize any
[1:01:49] one individual concept of spiritual
[1:01:51] worship but recommended putting aside
[1:01:54] all those separate Concepts with the
[1:01:56] hopes that all religions become leveled
[1:01:59] into one for all desire the same goals
[1:02:03] all have the same purposes and all are
[1:02:06] basically
[1:02:08] right did that come through
[1:02:12] excellent so notice the name leod deia
[1:02:15] the people's rights or Justice of the
[1:02:18] peoples was there ever an age like the
[1:02:21] 20th century Church age that has seen
[1:02:25] all nations rising up and demanding
[1:02:28] equality socially and finan
[1:02:31] financially this is the age of the
[1:02:34] Communist where all men are supposedly
[1:02:38] equal though it is only in
[1:02:44] theory right boy there's a train coming
[1:02:48] must be the Christmas
[1:02:51] train do you have that uh that picture I
[1:02:55] got two pictures that I wanted to bring
[1:02:56] up what brother bradam is talking about
[1:02:58] here is so
[1:03:01] interesting there's uh a church call it
[1:03:04] a church there's a organization a
[1:03:08] building that's called abrahamic house
[1:03:10] and I'm sure that we're all familiar
[1:03:12] with it but if you're not I just wanted
[1:03:15] to bring these up and and just show you
[1:03:17] the Wikipedia version of it it's
[1:03:20] interesting because it's right there in
[1:03:22] plain sight and what it is is the
[1:03:25] worship of the Jews of the Catholics and
[1:03:31] the Protestants I
[1:03:34] believe so yeah I think it's just uh
[1:03:39] pretty amazing thing I'm just going to
[1:03:40] read this here the abrahamic house
[1:03:43] abrahamic family house it's called is an
[1:03:45] Interfaith complex on Sadat Island in
[1:03:50] Abu Dhabi the undertaking was inspired
[1:03:53] by the document on human fr fraternity I
[1:03:56] haven't read that document but I think
[1:03:58] that would be an interesting study the
[1:04:01] document on human fraternity signed by
[1:04:03] Pope Francis on behalf of the Catholic
[1:04:06] church and ammed El tab on behalf of the
[1:04:10] Alazar mosque on 4th February 2019 in
[1:04:15] Abu Dhabi it houses the St Francis
[1:04:18] Church Imam alab mosque and Moses Ben
[1:04:23] mayam synagogue in separate separate
[1:04:26] structures and if you uh can see the
[1:04:29] picture there it's interesting and if
[1:04:32] you just go to the next slide it shows
[1:04:34] kind of the relationship where it is in
[1:04:36] terms of I don't know if this will work
[1:04:38] here Israel can you see the map Israel
[1:04:42] is just just a little ways over there
[1:04:45] it's just interesting to see that this
[1:04:46] is actually right there in the midst of
[1:04:49] the Middle East amen this abrahamic
[1:04:51] house that the pope is on board with and
[1:04:55] uh we know that Pope is still
[1:04:57] seated in uh in action and we know what
[1:05:02] is behind the pope but just in terms of
[1:05:05] what brother bradam is talking about
[1:05:06] I'll just go back to the beginning of
[1:05:08] this last paragraph here notice the name
[1:05:10] leosia the people's rights or Justice of
[1:05:13] the peoples was there ever an age like
[1:05:15] the 20th century Church age that has
[1:05:18] seen all nations rising up and demanding
[1:05:20] equality socially and financially this
[1:05:23] is the age of the communist
[1:05:26] where all men are supposedly equal
[1:05:29] though it is only in theory and it
[1:05:32] really is only in theory you can see
[1:05:35] some of the stuff going on in the world
[1:05:37] now how people are demanding equal
[1:05:39] rights but don't touch my stuff don't
[1:05:43] touch my money and you know the idea of
[1:05:46] defund the police and all that business
[1:05:49] oh my but what's going to happen if
[1:05:50] somebody kicks in someone's door they'll
[1:05:53] be the ones saying defund the police
[1:05:54] because it's great let's all be equal
[1:05:56] but at the same time what they'll do is
[1:05:58] turn around and dial 911 for police
[1:06:02] right it's only in theory even the
[1:06:04] prophet said
[1:06:05] it you know uh this is the this is the
[1:06:10] age of political parties who call
[1:06:13] themselves Christian
[1:06:14] democrats now for those people who have
[1:06:16] ever
[1:06:18] discussed politics with brother Barry
[1:06:20] you know where I'm going with this
[1:06:22] there's no such thing yeah and
[1:06:25] Christians
[1:06:26] socialist it'd be like a Christian
[1:06:28] liberal there's no such
[1:06:30] thing Christian Commonwealth Federation
[1:06:33] Etc according to our liberal theologians
[1:06:37] Jesus was a socialist and the early
[1:06:39] church under the guidance of the spirit
[1:06:42] practiced socialism and thus we ought to
[1:06:46] do so today we know that's not true
[1:06:49] that's right when the Ancients called
[1:06:51] leod deia the Metropolis it was looking
[1:06:53] forward to the One World Government
[1:06:56] that we are now setting up as we think
[1:06:58] of that City being the location of a
[1:07:00] great church Council we see for shadow
[1:07:04] The ecumenical move taking place today
[1:07:07] wherein very soon we will see all the
[1:07:11] so-called Christians come together and
[1:07:14] you know brothers and sisters like we
[1:07:16] put up there that's Wikipedia you can
[1:07:18] see that whether people actually agree
[1:07:21] with it or not it doesn't matter the
[1:07:24] leaders have already pledged allegiance
[1:07:27] to the crown the Triple Crown of the
[1:07:31] Roman Catholic church amen so the people
[1:07:34] who actually fall
[1:07:36] under all of the other leaderships that
[1:07:39] have kissed the ring they automatically
[1:07:41] fall under that spiritual blessing or
[1:07:43] curse depending on how you look at it
[1:07:46] depending on what's gone on and and
[1:07:48] that's why there's only really going to
[1:07:50] be one one maybe even one and a half
[1:07:55] groups of people that will actually make
[1:07:58] it and and only one group will make it
[1:08:00] in the in the resurrection and Rapture
[1:08:01] and that's the people that recognize the
[1:08:03] Jesus Christ of today that are not
[1:08:05] falling under a category that's kissing
[1:08:08] the Ring of Rome if we're doing that
[1:08:10] we're missing what what what actually
[1:08:12] has taken place I think it's just
[1:08:14] amazing because you know um years ago
[1:08:17] brother Ken he played a video in here
[1:08:19] and I tried to find it I wanted to play
[1:08:21] it I might still see if I can get my
[1:08:23] hands on it because I think it's very
[1:08:24] important to see brothers and sisters
[1:08:26] there was a man named Anthony Palmer who
[1:08:28] is since deceased but he actually was a
[1:08:31] friend of Pope Francis before he became
[1:08:34] Pope he is from South Africa this this
[1:08:37] fella and uh you know he talks uh about
[1:08:42] what's going on what's actually
[1:08:43] happening and how there was the protest
[1:08:45] of Luther protested the Catholic Church
[1:08:48] way back when that was Halloween night
[1:08:51] uh somebody know the date I know it was
[1:08:54] Halloween night I can't remember the
[1:08:55] date date it was it was
[1:08:57] 1400s when he protested the Catholic
[1:08:59] church but what happened then there was
[1:09:01] the protest that's when the Protestants
[1:09:03] the protesters moved away from the
[1:09:05] Catholic faith and and and the protest
[1:09:08] was that the just shall live by faith
[1:09:09] not by some instruction from a pope
[1:09:12] there was a trust in God at that point
[1:09:15] and we know that it was it was a it was
[1:09:17] a a little tiny light that God allowed
[1:09:19] to to come into that church age but this
[1:09:22] Anthony Palmer now 10 years ago this
[1:09:24] video came out and he said that I was
[1:09:27] friends with this Pope I actually was
[1:09:29] with the Pope I became closer friends
[1:09:31] since he became the Pope I thought that
[1:09:33] I would be further away but I became
[1:09:35] closer friends with him and I I I I was
[1:09:38] with him and he wanted to record a video
[1:09:39] on my iPhone and he records a video with
[1:09:42] the Pope Francis on his iPhone and
[1:09:45] basically he's calling for Unity between
[1:09:47] all Christian faiths All Peoples of the
[1:09:50] earth let's come together and worship is
[1:09:53] one we're more alike than we are
[1:09:55] different aren't we and and he preaches
[1:09:57] a a little message on his iPhone and
[1:10:00] talks about how this is coming together
[1:10:03] and and then this man Anthony Anthony
[1:10:06] Palmer he addresses all of The
[1:10:09] ecumenical churches in the states the
[1:10:12] big names Kenneth Copeland I don't know
[1:10:14] the rest of them some people might know
[1:10:16] more than I but in this video he says
[1:10:19] that you know what that Luther protest
[1:10:22] is over the lutherans have actually
[1:10:24] agreed to actually sign off on that
[1:10:27] protest and declare it done now we
[1:10:30] actually have come back to Rome and he
[1:10:32] talks about Catholic being uh
[1:10:35] Universal right and we're all alike if
[1:10:38] we're Christians so if that protest is
[1:10:40] over then where's your protest he talks
[1:10:43] about this in this video this is 10
[1:10:45] years ago or more even yes 10 years was
[1:10:48] the video that I saw the little tiny one
[1:10:50] but you know what he talks about in
[1:10:51] there I think it's so amazing because
[1:10:54] words m
[1:10:56] in that video he talks about something
[1:10:58] called spiritual
[1:11:01] racism I thought my goodness that is
[1:11:04] powerful because if you go and make
[1:11:06] yourself exclusive then you're being
[1:11:09] racist spiritually speaking aren't you
[1:11:11] but the word of God does the separating
[1:11:15] isn't that wonderful to think we don't
[1:11:16] have to do it the word of God does when
[1:11:18] that correction comes where do we stand
[1:11:21] right amen do we defy it or do we accept
[1:11:24] it
[1:11:25] because our Defiance to the word of God
[1:11:28] shows what spirit is influencing
[1:11:31] us but I thought that was powerful
[1:11:34] spiritual racism if I don't get the
[1:11:36] video if you want to look it up look up
[1:11:38] Anthony Palmer and you can see maybe a
[1:11:40] couple or three different videos the one
[1:11:42] the main video that showed the beginning
[1:11:44] the main part and then his little
[1:11:45] followup I couldn't find it all in one
[1:11:48] maybe someone that's smarter than me
[1:11:49] could do that but it's pretty amazing to
[1:11:51] look at how this is coming from Rome
[1:11:55] the protest is over brothers and sisters
[1:11:58] it's been over for a long time and we
[1:12:00] had a prophet in our land saying that
[1:12:02] it's later than you think amen yes 60
[1:12:06] years ago where do we stand tonight why
[1:12:10] Christmas Christmas night 2024 Where Do
[1:12:14] We Stand he says this is the age of the
[1:12:17] political parties who call themselves
[1:12:19] Christian
[1:12:20] democrats and Christian socialists and
[1:12:23] Christian Commonwealth Federation Etc
[1:12:25] according to our liberal theologians
[1:12:27] Jesus was a socialist and the early
[1:12:30] church under the guidance of the spirit
[1:12:33] practice socialism and thus we ought to
[1:12:36] do so
[1:12:37] today when the Ancients called Leo DEA
[1:12:40] the Metropolis it was looking forward to
[1:12:42] the One World Government that we are now
[1:12:44] setting
[1:12:45] up as we think of that City being the
[1:12:48] location of a great church Council we
[1:12:51] see foreshadowed The ecumenical move
[1:12:54] taking place to today wherein very soon
[1:12:57] we will see all the so-called Christians
[1:13:00] come together indeed the church and
[1:13:04] state religion and politics are coming
[1:13:07] together the tears are being bound the
[1:13:11] wheat will soon be ready for the
[1:13:14] Garner it was a city of earthquakes such
[1:13:17] earthquakes as finally destroyed it this
[1:13:20] age will end in God shaking the whole
[1:13:22] world Amen that has gone off to make
[1:13:26] love with that old Harlot not only will
[1:13:30] the World Systems crumble but the very
[1:13:33] Earth will be shaken and then renovated
[1:13:36] for the millennial reign of Christ amen
[1:13:40] the city was rich endowed by the wealthy
[1:13:43] it was full of culture science abounded
[1:13:46] how like today the churches are rich the
[1:13:50] worship is beautiful and formal but cold
[1:13:54] and dead
[1:13:56] I say brothers and sisters we don't ever
[1:13:58] want to get too stuffy with our worship
[1:14:00] we don't ever want to get too formal
[1:14:02] with it we don't ever want to get too
[1:14:04] professional with it we want to be able
[1:14:06] to Worship in spirit and in truth
[1:14:09] amen the worship is beautiful and formal
[1:14:12] but cold and dead let us never get that
[1:14:15] way culture and education have taken the
[1:14:18] place of the spirit-given
[1:14:20] word and faith has been superseded by S
[1:14:26] so that man is a victim of
[1:14:29] materialism
[1:14:32] my in every attribute ancient leoda is
[1:14:36] found reborn in the 20th century leodan
[1:14:40] age in every attribute wow in the mercy
[1:14:45] of God May those who have an ear to hear
[1:14:50] come out of her that they be not
[1:14:52] partakers of her sins and the
[1:14:54] consequence quent
[1:14:56] judgment the leoan
[1:14:59] age the leoan age began around the turn
[1:15:03] of the 20th century perhaps in
[1:15:07] 1906 how long will it
[1:15:09] last as a servant of God who has had
[1:15:12] multitudes of visions of which none has
[1:15:16] ever failed let me
[1:15:20] predict I've got that highlighted let me
[1:15:23] predict amen there's something about
[1:15:25] this prediction though brothers and
[1:15:26] sisters let me predict I did not say
[1:15:30] prophesy but
[1:15:33] predict this age will end around
[1:15:36] 1977 the Leo Dean age what was it that
[1:15:40] this Prophet began to say back in
[1:15:44] 1965 just about 10 years
[1:15:47] earlier what was it it was the bride age
[1:15:50] amen he never mentioned it before 1965
[1:15:53] the end of his ministry just before he
[1:15:55] went off the air amen 59 years
[1:16:01] later I think it's
[1:16:03] amazing here we have the prophet in our
[1:16:07] day in the rising of the sun was the
[1:16:10] first time he mentioned it in
[1:16:11] 1965 he mentions bride
[1:16:14] age but you know I just can't help but
[1:16:17] think the thing about this is it's
[1:16:18] exactly like Jesus in his day they were
[1:16:21] thinking something great was going to
[1:16:22] happen something fantastic was going to
[1:16:24] happen happened if you talk to people
[1:16:26] sorry if you talk to people who have
[1:16:28] been around much longer than I have
[1:16:31] there was people having communion
[1:16:32] services on the 31st of 19 uh 76 on the
[1:16:38] 31st thinking something was going to
[1:16:40] take place something really significant
[1:16:42] Naturally Speaking was going to take
[1:16:44] place here we have a prophet predicting
[1:16:46] something is going to happen but it was
[1:16:48] a spiritual happening just like Jesus
[1:16:50] day we know that he came in the flesh
[1:16:52] but he was not exactly the way they
[1:16:54] thought it should be it didn't fit their
[1:16:57] religious Behavior so whoa we had to
[1:16:59] step back just like 1977 it wasn't
[1:17:02] exactly the way the people were thinking
[1:17:04] they were led to believe somehow some
[1:17:06] way that it was going to happen a
[1:17:08] certain way and you know brother bradam
[1:17:10] he says it very clearly that it was the
[1:17:12] teaching it was the way the pulpits
[1:17:14] spoke to the people that caused people
[1:17:16] to think that it should happen a certain
[1:17:18] way what we need to do is make sure that
[1:17:20] we're aligned with the word and think
[1:17:22] that you know when we think that it's
[1:17:23] going to happen a certain way ain't
[1:17:25] going to happen that way we need to be
[1:17:27] ready to be in line with the word
[1:17:29] because then we'll be right that's the
[1:17:31] only ones that will be right the lean
[1:17:34] age began around the turn of the 20th
[1:17:36] century perhaps in 1906 how long will it
[1:17:38] last as a servant of God who has
[1:17:40] multitude of Visions which none has ever
[1:17:42] failed let me predict I did not say
[1:17:45] prophesy but predict that this age will
[1:17:48] end around 1977 not on
[1:17:52] 1977 around 197 77 if you will pardon a
[1:17:56] personal note here I base this
[1:17:58] prediction on seven major continuous
[1:18:02] visions that came to me one Sunday
[1:18:05] morning in June
[1:18:08] 1933 now it gets interesting doesn't it
[1:18:11] amen the Lord Jesus spoke to me and said
[1:18:14] that the coming of the Lord was drawing
[1:18:16] nigh amen but that before he came seven
[1:18:21] major events would
[1:18:23] transpire I just think it's beautiful it
[1:18:25] wasn't six events was
[1:18:27] it it wasn't six Thunders it wasn't six
[1:18:32] seals it was seven seven major events
[1:18:36] would transpire I wrote them all down
[1:18:38] and that morning I gave forth the
[1:18:40] revelation of the Lord the first Vision
[1:18:44] was that musolini would invade
[1:18:47] Ethiopia and that Nation would fall at
[1:18:50] his
[1:18:51] steps that Vision surely did cause some
[1:18:55] repercussions and some were very angry
[1:18:57] when I said it and would not believe it
[1:19:00] but it happened that way he just walked
[1:19:02] in there with his modern arms and took
[1:19:04] over the natives didn't have a chance
[1:19:07] but the vision also said that musolini
[1:19:10] would come to a horrible end with his
[1:19:13] own people turning on him that came to
[1:19:16] pass just
[1:19:18] exactly as it was said and I just want
[1:19:21] to encourage anyone to go and look this
[1:19:22] up in Natural History I'm not going to
[1:19:24] be be a a historian tonight I don't want
[1:19:26] to do that but I just want to say that
[1:19:28] if you have any questions about this
[1:19:30] take a look at what Wikipedia has to say
[1:19:33] the next Vision foretold that an
[1:19:35] Austrian by the name of Adolf hit
[1:19:37] remember this was 1933 amen this was in
[1:19:42] 1933 the next Vision foretold that an
[1:19:44] Austrian by the name of Adolf Hitler
[1:19:46] would rise up as dictator over Germany
[1:19:48] and that he would draw the world into
[1:19:51] war it showed the sigfreed line and how
[1:19:54] art troops the US troops would have a
[1:19:56] terrible time to overcome it then it
[1:19:59] showed that Hitler would come to a
[1:20:01] mysterious end does anybody know exactly
[1:20:03] what happened to
[1:20:04] Hitler those people that have looked
[1:20:06] into it they know the third Vision was
[1:20:09] in the realm of world politics for it
[1:20:12] showed me that there would be three
[1:20:13] great isms fascism Nazism and communism
[1:20:19] but that the first two would be
[1:20:21] swallowed up in the third The Voice
[1:20:24] admonished
[1:20:25] watch Russia watch Russia keep your eye
[1:20:28] on the King of the North and isn't it
[1:20:32] interesting because we know when he
[1:20:34] spoke this in 1933 Russia was not
[1:20:37] Russia Russia was the USSR that's right
[1:20:42] and people said immediately well you're
[1:20:45] wrong but he didn't they didn't know
[1:20:48] right this was a Prophet this was a
[1:20:49] prophet of God speaking foretelling
[1:20:51] something that's going to come to pass
[1:20:54] right
[1:20:55] if they would have known that there
[1:20:56] would be a man sitting on the throne in
[1:20:58] Russia like there is tonight hey there
[1:21:01] he is tonight and we know there's
[1:21:04] there's there's words that talk about
[1:21:06] someone just having a little bit too
[1:21:07] much vodka and just pushing a button and
[1:21:11] watch out the fourth Vision showed the
[1:21:15] great advances in science that would
[1:21:18] come after the second world war it was
[1:21:21] headed up in the vision of a plastic
[1:21:24] bubble toop car that was running down
[1:21:27] beautiful highways under remote
[1:21:30] control so that people appeared seated
[1:21:33] in this car without a steering
[1:21:35] wheel and that they were playing some
[1:21:37] sort of a game to amuse
[1:21:40] themselves it's amazing to look at this
[1:21:43] because we know that this hasn't
[1:21:45] actually landed in mainstream life yet
[1:21:48] we know that there's a few things that
[1:21:49] need to be worked out for it to
[1:21:51] naturally take place but there are cars
[1:21:53] that will operate on their own there's a
[1:21:56] lot of loading and unloading at at
[1:21:58] shipyards that's autonomous there isn't
[1:22:01] people driving the trucks unloading and
[1:22:03] and loading we know that there's there
[1:22:05] are cars moving around there's buses
[1:22:07] moving around that are actually
[1:22:09] autonomous but it hasn't become like the
[1:22:11] Jetson where it's every single vehicle
[1:22:14] on the road is just working on its own
[1:22:16] and I think many times people read this
[1:22:19] or hear this and think that that's
[1:22:20] really the way it's supposed to be and
[1:22:22] maybe it will get that way
[1:22:25] but I know that you can look up and find
[1:22:26] a video that will show a vehicle that is
[1:22:29] very close to the description that we're
[1:22:31] talking about here very very close and
[1:22:34] there's people that have fallen out of
[1:22:35] the message of the hour by looking at
[1:22:38] false Doctrine trying to actually come
[1:22:41] against the message of the hour and
[1:22:43] showing all the different cars that are
[1:22:45] on the roads and and sure enough there's
[1:22:47] no no bubble top plastic bubble top cars
[1:22:50] going down the roads well it doesn't
[1:22:53] have to be it can simply be maybe a a
[1:22:55] commercial maybe it's actually something
[1:22:57] that's happened you know uh this guy
[1:23:00] Elon Musk he actually isn't afraid to
[1:23:02] get into an autonomous car and let the
[1:23:04] car take him to where he's
[1:23:06] going who knows how far it'll go the
[1:23:09] point that I'm getting to is those
[1:23:11] people that get upset because they can't
[1:23:13] see it they're looking for a natural
[1:23:15] occurrence for a spiritual situation
[1:23:18] don't do that look to the word get that
[1:23:22] word inside of you and when this body
[1:23:24] change happens then you'll
[1:23:27] go but to say oh no as soon as I see a
[1:23:30] bubble top car going down the road then
[1:23:31] I'm going to
[1:23:32] believe you missed the entire point of
[1:23:35] the message of the hour it's not to see
[1:23:37] a sign or wonder it's not to play uh
[1:23:39] some sort of show God doesn't clown for
[1:23:44] nobody he showed this Vision to show the
[1:23:47] advances in science and and to show that
[1:23:50] there's coming a time where this this
[1:23:52] will take place and I'm pretty sure that
[1:23:54] some where in the world that this has
[1:23:56] already taken place and it doesn't have
[1:23:58] to be in the public eye it's irrelevant
[1:24:01] whether it is or it isn't the prophet
[1:24:02] said he saw it and and some people can
[1:24:05] believe it the fifth Vision had to do
[1:24:08] with the moral problems of our age man
[1:24:10] this is where it gets a little bit tight
[1:24:13] centering mostly around
[1:24:15] women God showed me that women began to
[1:24:18] be out of their place with the granting
[1:24:21] of the
[1:24:22] vote that's serious
[1:24:25] now now we can start getting in trouble
[1:24:28] with the granting of the vote they had a
[1:24:31] voice then they cut off their hair which
[1:24:34] signified that they were no longer under
[1:24:37] the authority of a man but insisted on
[1:24:41] either equal rights or in most cases
[1:24:44] more than equal
[1:24:47] rights I I could say a lot but I'm not
[1:24:49] going to I'm just going to Simply say
[1:24:52] this this is what the prophet of God
[1:24:54] said said we know what the word of God
[1:24:56] says and women are not supposed to be
[1:24:59] doormats they never were and they're
[1:25:01] never supposed to be and that's not what
[1:25:04] he's talking about here but there came a
[1:25:06] time where women were granted the right
[1:25:08] to vote and when that happened it
[1:25:11] changed everything didn't
[1:25:14] it she adopted men's clothing she cut
[1:25:18] her hair first so she showed that she
[1:25:21] was dishonoring her head then she
[1:25:23] adopted man's clothing which is an
[1:25:25] Abomination and went into a state of
[1:25:28] undress until the last picture I saw was
[1:25:31] a woman naked except for a little fig
[1:25:33] leaf type apron with this Vision I saw
[1:25:36] the terrible perversion and moral plight
[1:25:39] of the whole
[1:25:41] world then in the sixth Vision There
[1:25:45] Rose up in America a most beautiful but
[1:25:48] cruel
[1:25:49] woman she held the people in her
[1:25:51] complete power I believe that this was
[1:25:55] the rise of the Roman Catholic Church
[1:25:58] though I knew it could possibly be a
[1:26:01] vision of some woman rising in great
[1:26:03] power in America due to a popular vote
[1:26:08] by
[1:26:09] women again some folks are looking for a
[1:26:12] woman
[1:26:13] president what difference does it make
[1:26:16] if there's a woman president is that
[1:26:18] going to change anything about what we
[1:26:21] believe we would like to see a a clear
[1:26:24] top plastic clear top bubble car going
[1:26:27] down the road to say see that's what the
[1:26:28] prophet said and I know we would like to
[1:26:30] be able to say see there's a woman
[1:26:32] president but wouldn't you like to see
[1:26:34] the dead in Christ raised up and to be
[1:26:37] able to say see everything that I've
[1:26:40] ever believed is now taking place in
[1:26:42] front of me we don't want to look for
[1:26:44] natural signs and wonders to vindicate
[1:26:46] whether we
[1:26:47] believe the last and seventh Vision was
[1:26:51] wherein I heard a most terrible
[1:26:53] explosion and I turned turned to look as
[1:26:55] I turned to look I saw nothing but
[1:26:57] debris craters and smoke all over the
[1:27:01] land of
[1:27:04] America based on these seven Visions
[1:27:07] along with the rapid changes which have
[1:27:09] swept the world in the last 50 years I
[1:27:13] predict I do not
[1:27:16] prophesy interesting how he says this
[1:27:19] yes twice he said it exactly this way I
[1:27:22] predict I do not prophesy that these
[1:27:25] Visions will have all come to pass by
[1:27:30] 1977 who knows whether the the the
[1:27:33] technology was happening in a scientific
[1:27:35] lab somewhere maybe in a a foreign land
[1:27:38] and and nobody actually saw it happen
[1:27:41] who
[1:27:42] knows and though many feel that this is
[1:27:44] an irresponsible statement in view of
[1:27:47] the fact that Jesus said no man knoweth
[1:27:51] the day or the hour I still maintain
[1:27:53] this prediction after 30 years because
[1:27:56] Jesus did not say no man could know the
[1:27:59] year month or week amen hallelujah can
[1:28:03] you imagine that amen year month or
[1:28:06] week in which his coming was to be
[1:28:11] completed so now I don't want anybody to
[1:28:13] go and start doing math don't go start
[1:28:14] doing math to say that this week this
[1:28:17] month this year he's coming it's not up
[1:28:19] to us to know that no man knoweth the
[1:28:22] day or the hour except the father amen
[1:28:25] so I repeat sincerely believe and
[1:28:28] maintain as a private student of the
[1:28:30] word along with divine inspiration that
[1:28:32] 1977 ought to terminate the world's
[1:28:36] systems and Usher in the Millennium amen
[1:28:40] now this is where I jump back to
[1:28:41] Revelations chapter 4 some people have
[1:28:44] been called up a little hither haven't
[1:28:46] they they've been called up a little
[1:28:48] hither there there ain't just six seals
[1:28:50] open to those people all seven seals are
[1:28:54] actually open and all of the revelations
[1:28:57] all of the loose ends in the Bible have
[1:28:59] been wrapped up and handed to them
[1:29:01] righten because what did the prophet say
[1:29:03] all that Adam
[1:29:04] lost has been restored amen the mind of
[1:29:09] Christ has been restored think about all
[1:29:11] the people that were there with Adam all
[1:29:14] the way up until the flood the knowledge
[1:29:16] that they must have had the stories that
[1:29:18] they must have heard sitting around the
[1:29:20] fire with Papa
[1:29:22] Adam all of the knowled of God as the
[1:29:25] Son of God goodness but all that he lost
[1:29:29] has been restored brothers and sisters
[1:29:32] my now let me say this can anyone prove
[1:29:35] any of these Visions wrong were they not
[1:29:38] all fulfilled yes each one has been
[1:29:40] fulfilled or is in the process right now
[1:29:44] musolini invaded Ethiopia successfully
[1:29:47] then fell and lost it all Hitler started
[1:29:50] a war he could not finish and died
[1:29:53] mysteriously communism took over both
[1:29:56] the other two isms the plastic bubble
[1:29:59] car has been built and is awaiting only
[1:30:02] a better network of roads they need
[1:30:05] 5G women are all but naked and are even
[1:30:10] now wearing topless bathing suits and
[1:30:12] you know what in the City of Calgary
[1:30:14] it's mandated that you can actually go
[1:30:16] that way in in the Leisure centers it's
[1:30:19] actually in writing it's legal to do in
[1:30:22] Calgary
[1:30:24] and just the other day I saw in a
[1:30:26] magazine the very dress that I saw in my
[1:30:29] vision if you call it a dress it was a
[1:30:31] plastic transparent type of cloth with
[1:30:34] three darkened spots that covered both
[1:30:37] breasts in a small area and then there
[1:30:39] was a dark place like a small apron
[1:30:42] below the Catholic church is on the rise
[1:30:45] amen we have had one Catholic President
[1:30:49] and will no doubt have another what is
[1:30:52] left nothing EX except Hebrews 12:26
[1:30:56] whose voice then shook the Earth but now
[1:30:59] he hath promised saying yet once more I
[1:31:02] shake not the Earth only but also heaven
[1:31:05] isn't it interesting to think that there
[1:31:07] was a time and it was it was it was an
[1:31:09] amazing time the prophet was up in a Box
[1:31:12] Canyon and what happened he said that
[1:31:14] God called him and and and he told his
[1:31:17] friends that were around him to get
[1:31:18] under something right quick and one of
[1:31:21] the brothers started to talk to him and
[1:31:22] he said don't talk get under
[1:31:25] something what happened God's voice came
[1:31:28] and shook the whole earth and told him
[1:31:31] that judgment is pending and we know
[1:31:33] that that was Easter Easter morning it
[1:31:36] was it was it wasn't Easter it was
[1:31:38] actually Good Friday that Alaska almost
[1:31:41] sank right after
[1:31:43] that we know there's coming another
[1:31:45] Resurrection another Rapture H H uh uh
[1:31:48] another earthquake that's going to shake
[1:31:50] this whole world first he said he would
[1:31:52] shake the Earth people are looking to
[1:31:55] see a natural shaking there was already
[1:31:58] right Alaska shook don't look for
[1:32:00] California to slip in the ocean and then
[1:32:01] you'll believe H you might slip in the
[1:32:05] ocean with it if you do
[1:32:07] right it was the voice of God that shook
[1:32:10] the Earth it was the voice of God that
[1:32:13] took the trees halfway down in that box
[1:32:16] canyon that caused all of those little
[1:32:19] triangular-shaped rocks that people so
[1:32:21] highly covet that want to have as paper
[1:32:24] on their desk to say that they've been
[1:32:25] there to that place where the Prophet
[1:32:27] was where God spoke to
[1:32:29] him that was the voice of God that
[1:32:32] caused all of that to happen that was
[1:32:34] what shook the Earth brothers and
[1:32:35] sisters people are looking for the
[1:32:36] natural shaking don't do it the word of
[1:32:39] God is already Shook Up This World all
[1:32:41] you got to do is speak to someone who is
[1:32:43] a trinitarian a ston trinitarian about
[1:32:46] this message and see how shaken it
[1:32:48] becomes amen that's all you got to do
[1:32:51] once more God will shake the Earth
[1:32:54] and with it shake everything loose that
[1:32:57] can be shaken then he will renovate it
[1:33:01] amen just last March 1964 that Good
[1:33:04] Friday earthquake of Alaska shook the
[1:33:07] whole world though it did not unbalance
[1:33:10] it but God was warning by a world Tremor
[1:33:15] what he will soon do on a greater scale
[1:33:19] he's going to blast and rock this sin
[1:33:22] cursed world my brother my sister and
[1:33:25] there is only one place I love this part
[1:33:28] there is only one place that can stand
[1:33:31] that shock it's not an underground
[1:33:34] bunker it's not a carefully welded uh a
[1:33:37] stone-built concrete place that a man
[1:33:40] has created we know that they're going
[1:33:42] to hide in the dens and the rocks of the
[1:33:45] caves and say hide us from the face of
[1:33:48] him that's pouring out his wrath upon
[1:33:50] this Earth he says there is only one
[1:33:53] place that can stand that shock and that
[1:33:56] is in the fold of the Lord Jesus amen
[1:34:00] and I would say it's the Lord Jesus the
[1:34:03] Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ
[1:34:06] himself it's not hiding in a natural
[1:34:09] circumstance he says and I would beseech
[1:34:11] you while God's Mercy is still available
[1:34:14] to you that you give your whole life
[1:34:17] unreservedly to Jesus Christ who was the
[1:34:21] faithful Shepherd will save you and care
[1:34:24] for you and presents you faultless in
[1:34:26] glory with exceeding great joy
[1:34:29] amen my the
[1:34:32] messenger I doubt very much if any age
[1:34:35] truly knew the messenger that God had
[1:34:38] sent unto it except that in the first
[1:34:41] age where Paul was the messenger and
[1:34:45] even in that age many did not recognize
[1:34:48] him for what he
[1:34:49] was now the age in which we are living
[1:34:52] is going to be a very short
[1:34:54] one events are going to transpire very
[1:34:58] rapidly so the messenger to this leoan
[1:35:01] age has to be here now
[1:35:05] amen this is 1964 and 65 this was
[1:35:09] actually published it was published in '
[1:35:11] 65 released but being created in ' 64
[1:35:14] and and has to be here now though
[1:35:17] perhaps we don't know him as yet but
[1:35:19] there will surely have to be a time that
[1:35:22] he becomes known
[1:35:24] now I can prove that because we have a
[1:35:27] scripture that describes his ministry
[1:35:29] once again points right back to the word
[1:35:33] not my own not going to go into my own
[1:35:35] encyclopedia off the shelf and give you
[1:35:37] my own words that God gave me to make an
[1:35:40] addendum to his word no right back to
[1:35:42] the word I got a scripture for it first
[1:35:44] of all that messenger is going to be a
[1:35:47] prophet which means
[1:35:49] messenger he will have the office of a
[1:35:53] prophet Propet now that's where that
[1:35:55] messenger has a bit of a special place
[1:35:57] he will have the prophetic
[1:36:00] Ministry it will be based solidly on the
[1:36:05] word because when he prophesies or has a
[1:36:08] vision it will always be word oriented
[1:36:13] and it will always come to
[1:36:16] pass and we know that there's been so
[1:36:18] many I'll say it charlatans that have
[1:36:21] come around ones that have maybe had
[1:36:23] some prophecy I prophesy this thus and
[1:36:27] thus such and such and and it happens my
[1:36:31] but then they do it again and it doesn't
[1:36:34] happen what does the word of God say
[1:36:37] about those men exactly it says don't
[1:36:39] hear them amen that's all you don't
[1:36:43] listen to them because they're hit or
[1:36:45] miss right right yes and the ones that
[1:36:47] are hit or miss and and you know we can
[1:36:50] say well they hit on 10 but they missed
[1:36:52] one or or nine and they miss one out of
[1:36:55] 10 they're running 90% that's pretty
[1:36:58] good but not a prophet amen a prophet is
[1:37:01] going to be 10 out of 10 amen and we
[1:37:04] know that was the case here he will be a
[1:37:07] vind he will be Vindicated as a prophet
[1:37:09] because of his accuracy the proof that
[1:37:12] he is a prophet is found in Revelations
[1:37:15] 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the
[1:37:18] seventh messenger when he shall begin to
[1:37:21] sound not when he shall end to sound
[1:37:24] when he should begin to sound the
[1:37:26] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:37:29] hath declared to his servants the
[1:37:33] prophets I just love how he goes into
[1:37:35] describing this person now this person
[1:37:38] who is in this ver who is in this verse
[1:37:40] is called an angel in the King James
[1:37:43] version it is not a Heavenly being the
[1:37:47] sixth trumpeting Angel who is an
[1:37:49] Heavenly being is in Revelations 9:13
[1:37:53] and in the seventh of like order is in
[1:37:57] Revelations
[1:38:00] 11:15 there is an Angelic being and it's
[1:38:04] interesting because there's some that
[1:38:06] speculate that Angelic seventh being is
[1:38:09] actually William Bram there's a quote
[1:38:13] for that I'll bring sometime in the
[1:38:15] future not tonight though it's
[1:38:17] interesting though this one here in
[1:38:19] Revelations 10:7 is the seventh age
[1:38:22] messenger and it is a man and he is to
[1:38:26] bring a message from God and his message
[1:38:29] and Ministry is going to finish the
[1:38:31] mystery of God as declared to his
[1:38:34] servants the prophets think about all of
[1:38:37] those sages and Prophets and angels from
[1:38:40] all of the past ages that have desired
[1:38:42] to look upon this book that we're
[1:38:44] reading tonight my goodness God is going
[1:38:48] to treat this last Messenger as a
[1:38:50] prophet because he is a prophet amen
[1:38:54] amen that is what Paul was in the first
[1:38:56] age and that last age has won too isn't
[1:39:01] it wonderful to think that it just
[1:39:02] doesn't change this Prophet that we
[1:39:04] claim to follow he said I preach what
[1:39:06] Paul preached amen some people will say
[1:39:09] well when you come against women you're
[1:39:11] actually you guys you know what it's not
[1:39:13] you guys it's what Paul preached amen
[1:39:16] and we just stick to what Paul preached
[1:39:18] amen if the world would just stick to
[1:39:20] what Paul preached it would be a better
[1:39:21] place am
[1:39:24] but people can't stand that correction
[1:39:26] the correction it shows who is who it
[1:39:29] shows what spirit is in us if the word
[1:39:32] of God brings correction what do we do
[1:39:35] if that's what the word of God says
[1:39:36] that's what Paul says Where Do We Stand
[1:39:39] tonight brothers and
[1:39:41] sisters Amos 3 6-7 shall a trumpet be
[1:39:45] blown in the city and the people not be
[1:39:47] afraid shall the message of the Lord not
[1:39:50] come through a prophet to be the shout
[1:39:52] as we heard about on Sunday and the
[1:39:54] people not be afraid my shall there be
[1:39:58] shall there be evil in a city and the
[1:40:00] Lord hath not done it
[1:40:04] my surely the Lord God will do
[1:40:08] nothing but he
[1:40:10] revealeth his Secrets unto his servants
[1:40:14] the prophets amen I love how he just
[1:40:18] lays this out it's so clear it was in
[1:40:21] this end time period that the seven
[1:40:23] thunders of Jesus came forth Revelations
[1:40:27] 10: 3:4 and he cried with a loud voice
[1:40:30] as when a lion Roth and when he had
[1:40:32] cried seven Thunders uttered their
[1:40:35] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[1:40:37] uttered their voices I was about to
[1:40:39] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:40:40] saying unto me seal up those things
[1:40:43] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[1:40:44] write them
[1:40:46] not that's where many people will say
[1:40:49] the devils in the details when did those
[1:40:52] those seven thund ERS that were John was
[1:40:54] told we can agree on that that John was
[1:40:56] told to seal them up but when were they
[1:40:58] opened what happened on Sunset Mountain
[1:41:02] am
[1:41:05] Hallelujah
[1:41:07] 1963 what was in those Thunders no one
[1:41:10] knows but we need to
[1:41:13] know and it will take a prophet to get
[1:41:16] the Revelation because God has no other
[1:41:19] way of bringing out his scriptural
[1:41:22] Revelations except by a prophet am it's
[1:41:27] just so easy and so clear if we could
[1:41:29] just stick to the word of God his
[1:41:31] program we just read Amos
[1:41:34] 3:7 and and surely the Lord God will do
[1:41:38] nothing but he revealeth his Secrets
[1:41:40] unto his servants the
[1:41:45] prophets the word always came by a
[1:41:48] prophet and always will and isn't it
[1:41:51] beautiful what happened in the River
[1:41:54] Jordan when John the Baptist was there
[1:41:56] baptizing by the Revelation that he was
[1:41:58] given brother Brandon brings it out real
[1:42:00] clearly in the message he said that John
[1:42:04] never went looking for Jesus he had a
[1:42:05] revelation that there was one there was
[1:42:08] one standing among you right now who I'm
[1:42:10] not even worthy to do the latches on his
[1:42:12] shoes man this one is the Lamb of God
[1:42:15] who takes away the sin of the world and
[1:42:17] I know that he's standing here right now
[1:42:19] I'm just waiting to see him with my own
[1:42:21] eyes but he never looking for Jesus by
[1:42:24] that Revelation when Jesus came to the
[1:42:28] prophet that was the word made flesh
[1:42:30] came to the prophet amen exactly
[1:42:34] according to the word of God Amen he
[1:42:37] doesn't change
[1:42:40] amen the word always came by a prophet
[1:42:44] and always will right not by a
[1:42:49] school not by a degree no not by liberal
[1:42:53] theologians no way no University uh-uh
[1:42:57] it's not
[1:42:58] happening that is how the law of God is
[1:43:01] evident by even a casual search of the
[1:43:05] scripture the unchanging God with
[1:43:08] unchanging ways invariably sent his
[1:43:10] profit in every age where the people had
[1:43:12] strayed from divine order with both the
[1:43:16] theologians and the people having
[1:43:17] departed from the word God always sent
[1:43:20] his servant to these people but aart
[1:43:23] from the
[1:43:24] theologians in order to correct the
[1:43:26] false teaching and lead the people back
[1:43:28] to God so we see a seventh age messenger
[1:43:32] coming and he is a
[1:43:34] prophet not only do we see this
[1:43:36] messenger coming here in Revelations 107
[1:43:39] but we find that the word speaks of
[1:43:42] Elijah coming before Jesus returns
[1:43:50] amen it's always like this right where I
[1:43:52] want to start preaching amen hallelujah
[1:43:54] we're running out of time and his
[1:43:57] disciples asked him saying why then
[1:43:59] saith the scribes that Elias must first
[1:44:02] come and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:44:05] them Elias truly shall first come and
[1:44:07] restore all things Matthew 1710 to11
[1:44:12] before the coming of the Lord Elijah
[1:44:14] must come back for a work of restoration
[1:44:18] in the church we know this is scripture
[1:44:20] this isn't something we're trying to
[1:44:21] make up here
[1:44:24] excuse me this is what Malachi 4 says
[1:44:26] Malachi 45 and6 behold I will send you
[1:44:29] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:44:32] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:44:35] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:44:36] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[1:44:39] the children to the fathers lest I come
[1:44:42] and smite the Earth with a
[1:44:44] curse so when is that going to happen
[1:44:47] now we know it I know I'm preaching to
[1:44:49] the choir here but I know there's also
[1:44:51] people that potentially will be
[1:44:52] listening that don't know that Wonder
[1:44:55] there's going to be people that are
[1:44:56] watching and listening that will say
[1:44:58] well you know John the Baptist fits some
[1:45:00] of that scripture and then Jesus
[1:45:02] finishes the rest of it I actually had a
[1:45:04] a good discussion with some Jehovah's
[1:45:06] Witnesses that come to my house fairly
[1:45:08] regular and uh we got into a real good
[1:45:11] discussion about this exact scripture
[1:45:13] and they believe that Jesus was the
[1:45:15] Fulfillment of the latter part but we
[1:45:17] know that it wasn't Jesus that fulfilled
[1:45:19] that and it wasn't Jesus that fulfilled
[1:45:21] the first part of it it was John the
[1:45:23] Baptist and it was brother brandham amen
[1:45:27] he goes on to say there is absolutely no
[1:45:29] doubt that Elijah must return before the
[1:45:33] coming of Jesus he has a specific work
[1:45:36] to accomplish that work is the part of
[1:45:39] Malachi
[1:45:41] 46 that says he will turn the hearts of
[1:45:44] the children to their
[1:45:47] fathers the reason that we know this is
[1:45:51] his specific work to do
[1:45:53] at the time is because he has already
[1:45:56] accomplished the part that says he shall
[1:45:59] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:46:01] children when the Elijah Ministry was
[1:46:04] here in John the Baptist
[1:46:08] amen Luke
[1:46:10] 1:17 and he shall go before him in the
[1:46:13] spirit and power of Elias to turn the
[1:46:18] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:46:20] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:46:21] just and to make ready a people prepared
[1:46:24] for the
[1:46:25] Lord now I'm going to preach on the five
[1:46:29] comings of Elijah but I don't know if
[1:46:32] I'll be able to
[1:46:35] tonight there's five comings it's un
[1:46:39] important to understand it the Elijah
[1:46:41] anointing this this is a very important
[1:46:44] uh part of scripture that I think many
[1:46:46] times is overlooked and and I just want
[1:46:48] to say this that you know out of Matthew
[1:46:50] 17 Jesus when he went up to Mount
[1:46:53] Transfiguration who did he see on on top
[1:46:56] of the mountain who did the disciples
[1:46:58] see on top of the mountain with with
[1:47:00] Jesus es saw Moses and elah Elijah amen
[1:47:05] Matthew 17:9 and as they came down from
[1:47:08] the mountain Jesus charged them saying
[1:47:10] tell the vision to no man until the son
[1:47:12] of man be risen again from the dead and
[1:47:15] the disciples asked him saying why then
[1:47:17] say the scribes that Elias must first
[1:47:19] come and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:47:21] them Elias truly shall first come and
[1:47:24] restore all things but I say unto you
[1:47:27] that Elias has come already and they
[1:47:29] knew him not but have done unto him
[1:47:32] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[1:47:36] also the son of man suffer them what
[1:47:39] does the next verse say then the
[1:47:41] disciples understood that he spake unto
[1:47:44] them of John the Baptist
[1:47:46] amen he didn't come out and say it it
[1:47:50] was revelation
[1:47:53] but it was Elias that he
[1:47:56] said why did he say that because in in
[1:48:00] the scripture we just read Luke 1:17
[1:48:02] that he shall go before him in the
[1:48:04] spirit and the power of who Elias Elijah
[1:48:08] there was an anointing that happens we
[1:48:10] know that there was the the anointing of
[1:48:13] Elijah then there was the anointing of
[1:48:15] Eli Elisha Elijah told him if you see me
[1:48:19] when I go up you can have what you ask
[1:48:21] amen we know that he just believed in
[1:48:23] him and he said heyy I want a double
[1:48:25] portion of what it is you got and how
[1:48:27] many of us wouldn't say the same
[1:48:29] testimony tonight oh my let me have a
[1:48:31] double portion of that same spirit in
[1:48:34] the power Spirit of Elias which is the
[1:48:36] Lord Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost
[1:48:39] he's the same yesterday today forever
[1:48:41] but we know that Elisha he actually
[1:48:43] wouldn't be distracted he tried to
[1:48:45] distract him he said just wait here I
[1:48:47] could go on about this one but but he
[1:48:50] wouldn't be distracted he said if you
[1:48:51] see me when I go you can have what you
[1:48:53] asked he saw him when he went so he got
[1:48:55] what he asked and that was the mantle of
[1:48:57] Elijah he picked it up but what did he
[1:49:00] do he went back to the waters and said
[1:49:01] where's the god of Elijah let me see
[1:49:04] that same God in my life and I think
[1:49:07] it's the same thing for us tonight
[1:49:08] brothers and sisters don't be bashful to
[1:49:10] say that where is the god of Elijah we
[1:49:13] have seen the Elijah anointing in our
[1:49:15] age through William Mary and Bram amen
[1:49:19] we know it was John the Baptist it was
[1:49:21] sorry it was Elijah Elisha John the
[1:49:23] Baptist William Mary and Brenham and
[1:49:26] then there's going to be another one and
[1:49:28] that's going to be one of the two
[1:49:29] witnesses that come to Israel amen are
[1:49:31] we going to be here to see them I don't
[1:49:33] think
[1:49:34] so but what difference does it make
[1:49:37] we've seen the anointing of Elijah in
[1:49:40] William Mary and brown
[1:49:42] amen and it's absolutely beautiful I
[1:49:44] better call the
[1:49:46] musicians in the ministry of John the
[1:49:49] hearts of the fathers were turned to the
[1:49:52] children
[1:49:53] we know that because Jesus said so isn't
[1:49:56] that beautiful the Theologian Never Said
[1:49:59] So William Mary and bradam never said so
[1:50:02] Jesus said so but it does not say that
[1:50:06] the hearts of the children were turned
[1:50:07] to the fathers that has yet to take
[1:50:10] place and I say glory to God it's
[1:50:12] already taking place isn't it Hallelujah
[1:50:15] isn't it taking place Hallelujah the
[1:50:17] hearts of the last day children will be
[1:50:20] turned back to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:50:23] John got the fathers ready for Jesus to
[1:50:26] welcome the children into the fold now
[1:50:28] this Prophet upon whom the spirit of
[1:50:31] Elijah Falls will prepare the children
[1:50:34] to welcome back Jesus Jesus called John
[1:50:38] the Baptist Elijah amen Matthew 17:12
[1:50:43] but I say unto you that Elias has come
[1:50:44] already amen hallelujah and they knew
[1:50:46] him not but have done unto him
[1:50:49] whatsoever they listed God bless you
