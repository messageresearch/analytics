[20:01] &gt;&gt; I will lift up my hands in thy name. My
[20:04] soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
[20:06] and fatness,
[20:07] &gt;&gt; and my mouth shall praise thee with
[20:09] joyful lips.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; When I remember thee upon my bed, and
[20:13] meditate on thee in the night watches,
[20:16] because thou has been my help,
[20:18] therefore, in the shadow of thy wings
[20:21] will I rejoice. Amen. Has he been your

[51:19] come Lord Jesus,
[51:22] [music and singing] come.
[51:24] Amen. God bless you this morning.
[51:26] Welcome to the house of the Lord. If you
[51:29] have a need this morning, maybe [music]
[51:30] just make it known unto him by way of an
[51:33] uplift hand. We have a couple of
[51:35] requests we'd like to bring before the
[51:38] church, before his throne. One is for
[51:42] brother Ron Snow's uncle in
[51:44] Newfoundland. He's been identified to
[51:47] have cancer in his body. I believe it's
[51:50] Ronald Snow. Brother Ronald Snow. We
[51:53] want to uplift him today.
[51:56] We have a brother Lazarus from New
[51:57] Delhi. New Delhi Church
[52:00] says, "We have a special prayer request
[52:03] for brother Lazarus. Both of his kidneys
[52:05] have been nonfunctional since 2007
[52:09] and has been hospitalized due to
[52:11] multiple hip fractures.
[52:13] Despite his condition, he has continued
[52:16] to go out and to preach the word with
[52:20] unwavering faith and dedication.
[52:25] Please keep him in prayers for a quick
[52:27] discharge.
[52:29] If you have a need this morning, just
[52:31] make it known [music] unto him by way of
[52:32] an uplift hand.
[52:34] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus,
[52:37] we're so thankful that we can come
[52:40] together this way, Lord, that we can
[52:42] bring our little licks of fire together,
[52:44] Lord, to Father, be in your presence,
[52:47] the pillar of fire.
[52:50] Father, we know that's the very same
[52:51] pillar of fire that came down and met
[52:53] Moses in a burning bush. This is the
[52:57] very same pillar of fire that came and
[52:59] stood between Moses and your people.
[53:04] Oh, father
[53:06] and Pharaoh and his army, the enemy.
[53:10] And Lord Jesus, you're the same God
[53:13] today that you were then, that you ever
[53:15] will be. And Father, we're so thankful
[53:18] that we can, Lord, invite you to come by
[53:21] our way.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; And Lord, not only invite you because we
[53:24] know where you come, you come where
[53:26] you're always come where you're invited,
[53:28] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; And Father, this morning as our brother
[53:31] already prayed, Father, we greet you. We
[53:33] greet you with a kiss, Lord. We welcome
[53:35] you, Father. That we could wash your
[53:37] feet, Lord Jesus. That we could anoint
[53:40] you with oil today, Lord. Father, we
[53:42] don't want to be those that just invite
[53:44] you to come by out of a convenience,
[53:46] Lord, out of an image situation, from
[53:49] pride. Oh Lord, we invite you to come by
[53:52] our way so we can acknowledge you, Lord.
[53:55] So that we can pour out our love to you,
[53:57] Father. Oh Lord Jesus, and thereby you
[54:00] could speak back to us, Father, the
[54:02] words that we need, the words of life.
[54:05] Oh, Father, the words that will change
[54:06] our bodies one day. Father, we're so
[54:10] thankful that we can gather together
[54:11] this way. We don't take it for granted.
[54:13] Lord, we recognize the day in which we
[54:16] live. You told us the signs that would
[54:18] be in the land. And Father, they're
[54:19] everywhere. They're on every hand.
[54:22] Father, we know every single day we
[54:24] could be looking up because we know our
[54:26] redemption isn't just nigh. that's right
[54:28] here at the door.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to check up today
[54:33] with your word.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would meet
[54:37] these requests, Lord, as they've been
[54:38] mentioned this morning, Brother Ronald
[54:41] Snow in Newfoundland, Lord, dealing with
[54:43] that giant of cancer. But we know that
[54:46] he's nothing compared to you, Father.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; No giant can withstand before the armies
[54:51] of the living God,
[54:53] &gt;&gt; and prosper. Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Father, we stand with our brother in the
[54:57] name of Jesus that you would heal him,
[54:58] Lord. Father, we want to stand with this
[55:01] other brother in in the Delhi church in
[55:04] India. Father, we know that once upon a
[55:07] time there was oh father, there was a
[55:09] situation that happened where Lord, even
[55:12] the the biggest giant of all came around
[55:15] and stung your friend Lazarus, a man
[55:18] with the same name. Oh, Father, and you
[55:21] waited 4 days. You didn't come when we
[55:23] thought you should. But Father, you came
[55:26] exactly on time.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; And we invite you because you are the
[55:31] same.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, this is a servant of yours.
[55:36] No matter what the circumstance, he's
[55:38] still interested in promoting you to
[55:40] this world and taking as many people
[55:42] with him as he can. So, Father, we pray
[55:44] that that same God that stood in the
[55:48] frame of Jesus would go by their Delhi
[55:50] church today and stand by that man and
[55:53] raise him up in the name of Jesus.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Father, we're so thankful that we can
[55:58] know you that way. Lord, we know that,
[56:02] Father, we could see many signs and many
[56:04] wonders, many healings, many tremendous
[56:06] victories in our lives. But there's no
[56:09] greater victory or tremendous sign than
[56:11] when a man can be changed from a sinner
[56:14] into a saint. We know that's the
[56:16] greatest miracle. And that's why we're
[56:18] here today, Father, to check up by your
[56:21] word. Oh, Father, we pray that you would
[56:23] just meet the needs that were made known
[56:25] unto you today sovereignly, Father, in
[56:27] each individual's life, Lord. That
[56:29] Father, they would be able to come back
[56:31] with a praise report, Lord Jesus, as
[56:33] that one leper. Oh, let the other nine
[56:35] run away. But Father, we won't. We'll
[56:38] come back and say, "Thank you, Lord
[56:40] Jesus, for what you've done for us."
[56:42] Because once we were blind, but now we
[56:44] can see. Father, once we couldn't
[56:47] actually receive your word, but now we
[56:49] can.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would be with
[56:52] those who might be traveling, Lord, that
[56:54] you would grant them traveling mercies,
[56:56] Father. Oh, Father, if anybody's sick in
[56:58] their body, Lord, maybe at home today,
[57:00] we pray that you would minister to them
[57:02] wherever they are, Lord. We know that
[57:04] you're not bound by time or space. Oh,
[57:08] Father, we love you and we thank you. We
[57:10] just want to commit all these needs into
[57:12] your hands now. And Father, the rest of
[57:14] this service as we turn to your word, we
[57:16] pray that you would just minister to us
[57:18] sovereignly according to your will.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things now in
[57:23] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians.
[57:29] [snorts] God bless you today. If you
[57:31] have your Bibles, I would like to read
[57:33] out of St. John chapter 3.
[57:49] St. John chapter 3 verse one.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[57:59] &gt;&gt; There was a man of the Pharisees named
[58:01] Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[58:10] &gt;&gt; The same came to Jesus by night
[58:13] and said unto him,
[58:18] [clears throat]
[58:19] "Rabbi,
[58:21] we know that thou art a teacher come
[58:24] from God,
[58:26] and no man can do these miracles that
[58:29] thou doest,
[58:31] except God be with him."
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:35] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[58:38] "Verily, verily, [snorts]
[58:41] I say unto thee, except a man be born
[58:44] again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[58:48] God."
[58:50] Nicodemus saith unto him, "How can a man
[58:54] be born when he is old? Can he enter the
[58:59] second time into his mother's womb and
[59:02] be born?"
[59:04] Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say
[59:06] unto thee, except a man be born of water
[59:09] and of the spirit, he cannot enter into
[59:14] the kingdom of God."
[59:16] &gt;&gt; That which is born of the flesh is
[59:18] flesh, and that which is born of the
[59:21] spirit is spirit.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Marvel not that I say unto thee, Ye
[59:28] [clears throat] must be born again.
[59:31] The wind bloweth, whether it listeth,
[59:34] and thou heest the sound thereof, but
[59:36] can not tell whence it cometh, and
[59:40] whether it goeth. So is everyone that is
[59:45] born of the spirit." Nicodemus answered
[59:49] and said unto him, "How can these things
[59:52] be?"
[59:54] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[59:57] Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest
[1:00:00] not these things?
[1:00:02] Verily, verily, I say unto thee, we
[1:00:04] speak that we do know, and testify
[1:00:09] that we have seen,
[1:00:11] and ye receive not our witness.
[1:00:16] If I have told you earthly things and ye
[1:00:19] believe not, how shall ye believe if I
[1:00:23] tell you of heavenly things? Let's just
[1:00:27] bow one more time. Heavenly Father, Lord
[1:00:30] Jesus,
[1:00:32] we just invite you one more time.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen to teach us, Lord, of heavenly
[1:00:36] things.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to not be earthly.
[1:00:41] Help us to not be after the flesh, Lord.
[1:00:44] Yes,
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Father, we just desire to be in that
[1:00:47] place where you spoke about to the
[1:00:49] church in Romans chapter 8, Father,
[1:00:52] where there's no more condemnation
[1:00:55] because we're in you. Help us, Lord
[1:00:57] Jesus, to be in you today. And Father,
[1:00:59] if there's nobody or anybody in here,
[1:01:02] Father, that doesn't know you in the
[1:01:04] power of your resurrection today,
[1:01:06] Father, I pray that we could sing that
[1:01:08] song, this is the day.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; This is the day that the Lord hath made.
[1:01:14] And Father, we will rejoice and be glad
[1:01:16] in it, Lord. Father, every single one of
[1:01:19] us has got to be born again. And we just
[1:01:22] commit this service and all of it into
[1:01:24] your hands for your glory. In Jesus
[1:01:27] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be
[1:01:30] seated.
[1:01:33] Just like to welcome all of our
[1:01:34] visitors. Certainly wonderful to see
[1:01:38] Sister Alice here again. God bless you.
[1:01:40] We have the fly shackers with us. God
[1:01:43] bless you. And we have the gun ones with
[1:01:45] us. Certainly honored to have you with
[1:01:48] us as well. It's always too short. We
[1:01:51] never seem to be able to get enough
[1:01:53] fellowship in. And uh we just certainly
[1:01:56] thank the Lord for the little times that
[1:01:58] we do get because we don't know. They
[1:02:00] could be the last time.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; We don't want to take it for granted. We
[1:02:04] don't know what tomorrow has in store.
[1:02:07] And you know, as believers, I think it's
[1:02:10] important to recognize we're not
[1:02:11] exclusive to the laws of this universe.
[1:02:15] Whether we go by the way of the grave or
[1:02:17] we go by the way of the sky, we've got
[1:02:20] to go.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; I think when brother Menof Freezen was
[1:02:23] here last time, he said these words, "No
[1:02:25] matter what, we can't stay here."
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; No matter what, we cannot stay here. We
[1:02:32] have to go. Every single one of us. So,
[1:02:35] it behooves us to make sure that we've
[1:02:37] got our calling and election made sure.
[1:02:40] And I believe that's why we're all here
[1:02:42] today. I just wanted to read a thank you
[1:02:44] note that we got from the Kikuji family
[1:02:47] after the passing of Sister Germaine,
[1:02:49] laying her to rest there last weekend.
[1:02:53] It says, "The world's a whole lot better
[1:02:55] place because of people like you who
[1:02:58] give real joy and pleasure by the nice
[1:03:02] things that they do. It says here, "Dear
[1:03:05] church family, we want to take a moment
[1:03:09] to express our deep gratitude for the
[1:03:12] many thoughtful messages and prayers.
[1:03:16] Your loving support and kindness have
[1:03:18] comforted us during this time of loss,
[1:03:22] and we know that it's always a great
[1:03:24] time of loss when we lose a loved one.
[1:03:27] You have been a great blessing to us.
[1:03:30] Thanks be to God for putting you in our
[1:03:33] lives, the Kikuji family. And I want to
[1:03:36] say this, we certainly thank you for
[1:03:40] thank God for putting you in our lives
[1:03:43] as an assembly. It wouldn't be the same
[1:03:45] without you.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; We will certainly miss Sister Jarmine
[1:03:50] all the days of our life here on this
[1:03:51] side. But we know that we don't mourn as
[1:03:54] others mourn. We have a promise and that
[1:03:57] is that we will meet with her again.
[1:03:59] We're certainly excited for that with
[1:04:01] all of our loved ones. My
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; this morning, I just wanted to uh also
[1:04:06] announce we've got the the men's
[1:04:09] breakfast is coming up. If you have any
[1:04:11] questions about that, by all means, just
[1:04:13] reach out. Um I'm going to be away next
[1:04:15] weekend. I'll be in Grand Prairie for
[1:04:17] three services. And we have brother Don
[1:04:19] Snow has agreed to take the service for
[1:04:22] us here on Sunday. And we know the Lord
[1:04:24] has put a lot on his heart. And uh it's
[1:04:27] interesting because for those people who
[1:04:29] know him, you know what I'm saying, but
[1:04:31] if you don't know brother Dawn, the way
[1:04:33] the Lord deals with him is such an
[1:04:36] amazing way. He has has a a gift to
[1:04:38] write poetry. And he expresses the words
[1:04:41] that the Lord the inspiration the Lord
[1:04:43] puts on his heart through poetry. And he
[1:04:45] has actually a book of poetry. It's not
[1:04:48] just one or two poems. Um it's amazing.
[1:04:52] And the Lord just keeps pouring out
[1:04:54] through his vessel. And uh that what I'm
[1:04:57] saying is that's just the tip of the
[1:04:58] iceberg. The poems that you hear are
[1:05:00] just the tip of the iceberg. If you ever
[1:05:02] sit around and fellowship with brother
[1:05:04] Dawn, he has a lot to say and uh in a
[1:05:07] great way. I'm not saying it in a bad
[1:05:09] way, in any in any way. I mean it to be
[1:05:12] the the greatest of compliments to see
[1:05:14] what the Lord has done in our brother's
[1:05:16] life and in the life of his family. Is
[1:05:18] your family here today? They're at home.
[1:05:20] They're still not well. We want to
[1:05:22] continue to remember Sister Rebecca and
[1:05:24] the kids as well in prayer.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; But I'll be away next weekend in Grand
[1:05:28] Prairie. I coveret your prayers as we're
[1:05:30] there. Just bringing some encouragement
[1:05:32] to the saints there and uh pray for
[1:05:34] brother Dawn if you don't mind.
[1:05:37] I want to continue on uh it's been a
[1:05:39] long time actually, a few weeks now
[1:05:41] since we talked about questions and
[1:05:43] answers. We've mentioned it to the
[1:05:45] church in the past um and brother Brham
[1:05:47] mentioned it in his church and we know
[1:05:49] that the the books the volumes of cood
[1:05:52] conduct order and doctrine are actually
[1:05:54] put together and uh they're just a
[1:05:57] series of questions and answers that
[1:05:59] were given to the prophet to the seventh
[1:06:02] angel messenger to William Mary and
[1:06:03] Brandham the man whom we do not worship
[1:06:07] I actually I think it's so beautiful to
[1:06:09] uh be able to say that you know we get
[1:06:12] so many questions now I It's wonderful.
[1:06:14] And you know, one of them that came
[1:06:16] through, I believe, I'm just going to
[1:06:17] read it and I'm just going to I'm just
[1:06:19] going to preach from my heart here for a
[1:06:20] minute. It's important to get the
[1:06:22] questions. We've asked people to write
[1:06:25] them down and just drop them in the
[1:06:26] offering or give them to a deacon or
[1:06:28] just give them to me. Um or even send a
[1:06:30] text message, whatever you want, however
[1:06:32] you want to communicate it. But what it
[1:06:34] means is that there's a question in your
[1:06:36] heart. If it's a spiritual question,
[1:06:37] there has to be a spiritual answer.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; And we're certainly thankful for that.
[1:06:40] Brother Random said specifically that it
[1:06:43] shows what's in the heart of the people.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; And it's wonderful because we have the
[1:06:48] opportunity to grow. And I'll tell you,
[1:06:50] it's caused me to grow as I research the
[1:06:52] answers for the questions because I
[1:06:53] could give you brother Barry's answers,
[1:06:55] but they're going to be of no value. The
[1:06:57] only value is going to be the the
[1:06:59] answers according to the word of God.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to change our
[1:07:02] bodies. But it's wonderful that we have
[1:07:04] the questions because it means that
[1:07:06] there's something that we could actually
[1:07:08] learn. So, we're doing this together.
[1:07:10] I'm just saying this. We're doing this
[1:07:12] together. But this one here, I I didn't
[1:07:14] have to research it. I'm not going to
[1:07:15] research it. I'm just going to tell you
[1:07:17] straight as the pastor of Calgary Living
[1:07:19] Word. Absolutely straight as an arrow
[1:07:22] with I don't know if anybody hunts here
[1:07:24] with a broadhead tip on it that's razor
[1:07:26] sharp. All you have to do is just touch
[1:07:28] it and it'll actually slice you open.
[1:07:30] I'm going to make it that sharp and
[1:07:33] straight. It needs to be, brothers and
[1:07:34] sisters. And I know everyone is pausing
[1:07:37] now. We're gasping. What is it going to
[1:07:38] be? This one says, "God bless you."
[1:07:42] In most churches in Congo, this is what
[1:07:44] it says. I'm not saying this. This is
[1:07:47] what it says. In most churches in Congo,
[1:07:49] it says WMBB. I'm assuming that says
[1:07:52] William Mary Brham is worshiped as a
[1:07:56] god. And the word god is capitalized and
[1:07:59] it's underlined twice.
[1:08:02] In most churches in Congo, William
[1:08:05] Mariam Brham is worshiped as a god and
[1:08:08] he is called God.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; There's two of questions here. I'm going
[1:08:14] to address that one first. That is an
[1:08:17] antichrist spirit.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Straight up. It's an evil spirit of the
[1:08:22] devil straight from hell. Amen.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Anybody that would worship William Mary
[1:08:28] and Brandham has actually missed exactly
[1:08:31] what the message of the hour is
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; because what William Mary Brham is not
[1:08:35] the message of the hour. He was the
[1:08:37] messenger of the hour.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; He brought a message to the world of
[1:08:43] Christ.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Back on earth again.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; And he even said it in his message. If
[1:08:53] you listen to it, he says clearly, "This
[1:08:56] is the appearing
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; So, what happened on Sunset Mountain? We
[1:09:05] could go a long ways with it. I'm just
[1:09:06] going to address this. It's going to be
[1:09:08] short and sweet. Anyone that worships
[1:09:10] William, Mary, and Brandham is actually
[1:09:13] going to go into the tribulation.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; They are going to miss the rapture. They
[1:09:18] have completely missed the purpose of
[1:09:21] the message of the hour entirely.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Entirely.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; It's a deity spirit that came around and
[1:09:30] tried to trip up the prophet at a very
[1:09:33] significant time in his life in his
[1:09:35] ministry. It came around in 1962 to try
[1:09:39] and get William Mary and Brennham to
[1:09:40] embrace that spirit, the deity spirit.
[1:09:43] But he wouldn't. He said to them, "You
[1:09:45] make me a heretic. you make me an
[1:09:47] antichrist if I do that.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; So as soon as you stop, I'll actually go
[1:09:53] back on the field. He literally took
[1:09:54] himself off the field
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; because of it.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "You make me an antichrist by
[1:09:59] doing that. You make me an antichrist,
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; not him."
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Anybody that would do that would take
[1:10:07] and make this prophet an antichrist. And
[1:10:09] and you could never take and make him an
[1:10:11] antichrist. You could never take his
[1:10:12] message and make him an antichrist, but
[1:10:14] you could actually make it a figment of
[1:10:16] your imagination. And that's what's
[1:10:18] happened. The Lord said that in the last
[1:10:19] days, they will be given over to a
[1:10:21] strong delusion. And people that think
[1:10:23] that he's God have been given over to a
[1:10:25] strong delusion.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean they can't be saved. It
[1:10:28] doesn't mean they can't be delivered.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; We We love We love the sinner, right?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; We hate to sin.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter. I'm going to say this
[1:10:41] clearly because it says on here in the
[1:10:43] Congo, I want to say it clearly because
[1:10:46] the deity spirit is not race.
[1:10:49] It's not geographical. The deity spirit
[1:10:52] is international.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And the deity spirit is multicultural.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; The deity spirit is in every single
[1:10:59] church.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; And it behooves the believers to make
[1:11:03] sure that they don't actually subscribe
[1:11:04] to that spirit.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just because the angel of the Lord
[1:11:09] came down and visited this man does not
[1:11:11] mean this man died for our sins.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; There's only one, and we're going to get
[1:11:15] into that a little bit later. There's
[1:11:16] only one. Hebrews chapter 10, go and
[1:11:19] read it. It speaks about it.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; William, Mary, and Brandham was not the
[1:11:23] Lord.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Anyone that worships William Mary and
[1:11:26] Brham has missed the message entirely.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; It's a deity spirit and it's an evil
[1:11:31] one. And it came in 1962 to try and trip
[1:11:33] up the prophet as I said because what
[1:11:35] was going to happen in 1963
[1:11:38] something real significant.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Seven angels meet brother Brandham meet
[1:11:43] this man on top of a mountain and tell
[1:11:45] him to go back to Jeffersonville because
[1:11:47] those seven seals that have been sealed
[1:11:50] before the foundation of the world that
[1:11:51] John looked upon and and that voice told
[1:11:54] John, "Seal it up, John.
[1:11:57] It's not for your day." Daniel desired
[1:11:59] it and asked about it and he said, "No,
[1:12:01] it's not for you either, but it's for
[1:12:03] that group of people, that elect group
[1:12:05] of people at the end of time.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; It's for those people."
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Just before those seals were open, that
[1:12:13] spirit had a poke to try and see if he
[1:12:16] could actually trip them up. But he
[1:12:17] didn't.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Because you're never going to trip up a
[1:12:20] true son or daughter of God.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll say this. Someone who isn't
[1:12:24] baptized with the Holy Ghost can be
[1:12:26] tripped up.
[1:12:28] And that's the differentiating factor
[1:12:30] right there. That's what we're going to
[1:12:30] get into today is the Holy Ghost. And I
[1:12:32] know some people will grown. And I think
[1:12:34] if you grown, you probably need the Holy
[1:12:36] Ghost.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say it straight today.
[1:12:39] This ain't time for fooling.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; This is not playtime. This is about
[1:12:43] changing our bodies. We need the
[1:12:45] greatest faith that we're ever going to
[1:12:46] see in any one of the ages in this age.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we're not going to see a body
[1:12:51] change.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; It's not about playing church, brothers
[1:12:55] and sisters. But anybody that would
[1:12:56] worship William Mary and Brandham or the
[1:12:58] image of William Mary and Brandham,
[1:13:00] they've missed the mark.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; We need to have a discussion because
[1:13:02] that's not what the message of the hour
[1:13:04] is. The second part of this, it says
[1:13:06] having WMBB, William Mary Brandham photo
[1:13:10] in at the home is a part of worshiping
[1:13:14] him. I'm assuming that that's what some
[1:13:16] people do. And and maybe when they go
[1:13:19] into people's houses now even and they
[1:13:20] see a picture of William Mry and
[1:13:22] Brandham on the wall or or maybe on a
[1:13:25] bookcase with the the halo over his head
[1:13:27] or the pillar of fire as we commonly
[1:13:29] refer to it as maybe they consider that
[1:13:31] to be worshiping William Mary and
[1:13:33] Brandham.
[1:13:36] And I think it's real important to
[1:13:37] recognize
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; we worship Jesus Christ.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; That's who we worship. Yeah,
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; that's who we worship. We don't worship
[1:13:45] William, Mary, and Brandham.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And anyone that says that we do, they're
[1:13:48] a liar.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; It's another lying spirit, right?
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; We know there's lying spirits. And and
[1:13:55] they're not afraid to come and and kneel
[1:13:56] down right before the throne of Almighty
[1:13:59] God and say that I'll go and do your
[1:14:01] will. I'll make your will come to pass
[1:14:02] in those people's lives.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Lying spirits,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; It's a lie to say that we worship
[1:14:08] William, Mary, and Brham. And anybody
[1:14:11] that does it is completely off their
[1:14:13] rocker in terms of what this message is
[1:14:15] about. That picture was given for a
[1:14:19] reason. We could go into detail about it
[1:14:21] and maybe I will just for a little bit.
[1:14:23] There was a time where this minister, he
[1:14:25] was a denominational minister. He was a
[1:14:27] a Pentecostal minister, a Baptist
[1:14:29] minister is what he was. Best Dr. Best,
[1:14:32] he had the PhD on the word. And what he
[1:14:36] wanted to do, he said he advertised it
[1:14:38] around town. And he was going to take
[1:14:39] this heretic Brandham guy and he was
[1:14:42] going to tack his hide to his study
[1:14:44] wall. He was going to actually embarrass
[1:14:46] him and show that he was a fraud. And we
[1:14:50] know that you're never going to be able
[1:14:51] to do that with the spirit of God.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; But there was pictures that were taken,
[1:14:55] wasn't it? Seven pictures.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Seven pictures were taken.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Six of them.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Remember, six of them were blank. Those
[1:15:03] pictures were Dr. best on the stage
[1:15:06] trying to actually make fun of of uh
[1:15:09] Bosworth, right?
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Because William Brandham said, "I'm not
[1:15:12] even going to go and debate this guy.
[1:15:13] I'm not going to do it." And Bosworth
[1:15:14] said, "Just let me, Adam. I'll do it.
[1:15:17] Let me go." And he said, "Okay, but
[1:15:19] don't fight."
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; So he went up and he said to him, "The
[1:15:23] the redemptive names of Jehovah."
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Do they apply to Jesus?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Right? Those redemptive names, do they
[1:15:33] apply to Jesus? And we know that he
[1:15:35] couldn't answer. And it's the same exact
[1:15:37] spirit that Jesus encountered when they
[1:15:39] came and and said to him, "By whose
[1:15:41] authority do you do this healing? This
[1:15:44] tremendous healing." And what did he
[1:15:45] say? Hey, John's baptism. Is it of God
[1:15:48] or of man?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; You tell me and then I'll tell you.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh, we cannot tell." And
[1:15:53] he said, "Neither do I. I'm not going to
[1:15:55] tell you whose authority is. I don't
[1:15:56] have to."
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; But it was the same spirit there on
[1:16:00] stage. But anyways, Dr. Best was putting
[1:16:02] his fist in the in the in the prophet's
[1:16:05] representative's face. Dr. Dr. Best was
[1:16:07] just trying to make a mockery of it. And
[1:16:09] there were seven pictures taken by a
[1:16:11] professional photographer that best
[1:16:13] hired for that night in the Sam Houston
[1:16:16] Coliseum. And what happened? Six of
[1:16:18] those pictures, they actually were
[1:16:20] blank,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; overexposed, nothing on them. But the
[1:16:25] seventh one,
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; the seventh one.
[1:16:30] Amen, brother.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; That's not a man that we worship.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; That's God saying that's my prophet.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; But if anybody has this in their house,
[1:16:43] I want to say it loud and clear today.
[1:16:45] Just like I said, sharp and and and and
[1:16:48] just like the word, right? If anybody
[1:16:50] has this in their house and and they
[1:16:52] consider it to be something that they
[1:16:54] worship, maybe they put some candles
[1:16:55] there, maybe they have incense around
[1:16:57] it, you're wrong. You're mistaken.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; You're making this an antichrist spirit.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; But you'll never ever make the message
[1:17:07] an antichrist spirit. You'll never
[1:17:08] denominate it.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; What you do is you take and tarnish the
[1:17:12] image that you have of it. And and you
[1:17:14] follow an antichrist spirit.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; But that picture was to identify this is
[1:17:20] my man. This is the guy that I have sent
[1:17:25] after six ages
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; in the seventh age
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; to identify myself with
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; hear his words
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; and remember brother Brandham even when
[1:17:35] he came down the angel of the Lord
[1:17:36] brought him down to the from the balcony
[1:17:38] brought him down his people his family
[1:17:40] were like don't go down there but he did
[1:17:42] it anyways
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; he did
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; and what did he say he just showed love
[1:17:47] he didn't go and debate
[1:17:49] and we know that's the strongest force
[1:17:51] in the universe is love.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; But there's times where we need to say
[1:17:55] it straight. Sometimes it has to be
[1:17:58] exactly laser beam straight. And this is
[1:18:02] an antichrist spirit. If somebody
[1:18:03] worships William Brandham or the image
[1:18:05] of William Miriam Brham, they've got it
[1:18:07] wrong. And I want to say this also.
[1:18:09] Don't think for a second if you are
[1:18:11] coming from that background anywhere in
[1:18:13] the world, doesn't matter what race,
[1:18:15] doesn't matter what continent. If you
[1:18:17] come from a background where people do
[1:18:20] that because you walk into a church here
[1:18:23] in North America and you see that
[1:18:24] picture or you come into someone's home
[1:18:27] and they have a picture of William
[1:18:29] Brandham there, that doesn't mean they
[1:18:31] worship him.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It means that they appreciate that
[1:18:37] supernatural occurrence that happened
[1:18:39] with that guy because that guy led them
[1:18:42] directly to Jesus Christ.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; So wherever it is in the world, if they
[1:18:52] worship William, Mary, and Brandham,
[1:18:55] they're wrong.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; And they do a real disservice to the
[1:18:59] message of the hour.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; But they'll never stop it,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; right? because the truly elect will see
[1:19:05] it
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; and they'll move forward.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; I just wanted to get that one because I
[1:19:10] thought it was pretty straightforward
[1:19:12] and simple. I hope it's okay. If anybody
[1:19:14] has any questions about it, I'm
[1:19:15] certainly happy to talk about it. And uh
[1:19:18] there's nothing to debate about it. It's
[1:19:20] just simple. It's it's wrong to worship
[1:19:22] William Brham. Period. And if you have
[1:19:24] an image of William Brham and you
[1:19:26] worship that, it's wrong. Period. And
[1:19:29] worship Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; He's the one that came as God in the
[1:19:33] flesh to die and make remission for our
[1:19:35] sins. He's the only one and anybody else
[1:19:39] is false.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Anybody else? So, God bless you whoever
[1:19:44] sent that. I know it takes courage to
[1:19:46] submit questions and uh we certainly
[1:19:48] want to try and address them in a in a
[1:19:51] really kind, loving way, but also uh
[1:19:54] direct and straight because like I said,
[1:19:56] we're not we're not playing around here.
[1:19:58] This is not a time for play. This is
[1:20:00] this is life or death.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; This is life or death. And today I want
[1:20:05] to get back into the question that we
[1:20:06] had a little while ago. It was one
[1:20:08] question with four parts. What does it
[1:20:11] mean to truly What does it mean to be
[1:20:13] truly born again? What does it mean to
[1:20:16] be truly born again? Just a beautiful
[1:20:19] question. Is it a different feeling?
[1:20:23] What happens to your actions?
[1:20:28] And how do you change?
[1:20:31] Because of the nature of this question,
[1:20:34] I feel like I could probably preach till
[1:20:38] we have a body change on this question
[1:20:41] and the different parts therein. And
[1:20:42] likely I probably will because it's
[1:20:45] vital and and I think that perhaps in
[1:20:47] some ways I have already. But what does
[1:20:50] it mean to truly be born again? Is it a
[1:20:52] different feeling? What happens to your
[1:20:54] actions? How do you change? Brother
[1:20:57] Brandham, he preached a message. Ye must
[1:21:00] be born again. And the last time I
[1:21:03] preached on this, we talked about this
[1:21:05] question. I actually took a few quotes
[1:21:07] from there. And I'm not going to quote
[1:21:08] us to death today. I'm going to simply
[1:21:11] preach the word. And I hope it's okay.
[1:21:13] You know, we all have to be born into
[1:21:15] this world. And we have to be born into
[1:21:18] this world through the fall in the
[1:21:20] garden. That's how we get born into this
[1:21:23] world. We don't get born by the way that
[1:21:25] we were supposed to. The way the
[1:21:27] original word was supposed to happen. It
[1:21:30] was the spoken word being the original
[1:21:32] seed. And if anybody's interested, we
[1:21:34] probably already know all of us that
[1:21:35] Brother Brandham preached a six-hour
[1:21:37] sermon on that morning and night. Two
[1:21:40] two sermons in one day. That's uh that's
[1:21:42] a big day. Two three-hour services. But
[1:21:44] he preached a sermon called the spoken
[1:21:47] word is the original seed. And he
[1:21:49] addresses this very clearly in that
[1:21:51] message about how there was a fall in
[1:21:54] the garden. We know there was a fall in
[1:21:55] the garden. And I talked about it last
[1:21:57] time. The serpent was not a snake. The
[1:21:59] serpent was not cursed. When God came
[1:22:01] into the garden and said, "Adam, where
[1:22:03] are you?" He didn't say, "Eve, where are
[1:22:05] you?" He held Adam accountable. And it's
[1:22:08] the same God today that we serve. He
[1:22:11] doesn't come down and say, "Why is your
[1:22:12] family a mess, misses?" If our family's
[1:22:16] a mess, he comes down and says, "Son,
[1:22:19] what's going on?"
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Because our relationship naturally is a
[1:22:25] type of our relationship spiritually.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And that's a direct quote. I don't have
[1:22:31] it here now, but I know Brother Brandham
[1:22:32] says that. So, if we're getting bumpy
[1:22:34] waters in our relationship down here, we
[1:22:37] better take a look up there.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; But we have all been subject to this
[1:22:43] fall that happened in the garden. None
[1:22:45] of us can escape it. Because we're born
[1:22:48] into a message home doesn't mean that we
[1:22:51] escape it. And and you can see where I'm
[1:22:53] going with this. I'm going to make sure
[1:22:55] that we underpin this all the way, every
[1:22:57] single step of the way. We have all got
[1:23:00] to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; And you know, we've got to not only just
[1:23:05] go and say, "I want the baptism of the
[1:23:07] Holy Ghost." But we need to know that we
[1:23:09] have it
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; because it's the token. And there's only
[1:23:13] one way to get it. And that one way to
[1:23:15] get it is full obedience
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; to the complete word of God.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; That is what is going to entitle us to
[1:23:24] this token or the Holy Ghost in our
[1:23:27] life. But because of the fall, everyone
[1:23:30] in this world is born the same way.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't it interesting? Sinners and
[1:23:35] saints, we're all born the same way. No
[1:23:39] one is exclusive to it. Everyone falls
[1:23:43] under this curse.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Once upon a time, we were supposed to be
[1:23:48] born by the spoken word.
[1:23:51] But we know that Adam and Eve, they
[1:23:54] changed things the way things were were
[1:23:56] set up in in the garden. And because of
[1:23:59] that, now here we are. And you know,
[1:24:01] we've we've heard it said many times,
[1:24:03] you know, born in sin, shaped in
[1:24:04] iniquity, we come into the world
[1:24:05] speaking lies. It's based on the
[1:24:07] scripture Psalms 51.
[1:24:10] Behold, I was shapen in iniquity and in
[1:24:12] sin did my mother conceive me. This is
[1:24:14] David lamenting
[1:24:16] the actions in his life. David had some
[1:24:19] things, some attributes in his life that
[1:24:21] God had to take out of him.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; He had adultery in his life. That's God
[1:24:27] had to take it out of him. Can you
[1:24:28] imagine that? He was a man after God's
[1:24:31] own heart, but yet he had adultery. He
[1:24:33] was a man after God's own heart, but yet
[1:24:35] he had murder.
[1:24:38] We're all subject to those things in our
[1:24:41] lives
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; unless we actually get the baptism of
[1:24:43] the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Because when mankind chose to reject
[1:24:49] God's provided way at the fall,
[1:24:53] what happened was they accepted Cain's
[1:24:56] way,
[1:24:58] which is a terrible thing. But here we
[1:25:00] are in a hybrid condition now, which is
[1:25:03] what Cain was, right?
[1:25:05] Cain was a hybrid
[1:25:08] thing,
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; not even a person.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Was he a person?
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; I don't think so.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Because the serpent wasn't a person. The
[1:25:17] serpent was not human.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; And it's one of the most twisted things
[1:25:21] when you really step back and look at it
[1:25:22] because the relation wasn't even human
[1:25:25] to human.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] And that's where we know the
[1:25:29] denominational world will go screaming
[1:25:31] and yelling down the road, pulling their
[1:25:33] hair out, saying, "You're a heretic to
[1:25:34] even say such a thing."
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; But why was it so important that God
[1:25:39] would actually curse
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; everyone in the garden? Because they ate
[1:25:43] an apple really
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; or an apricot. It depends on probably
[1:25:49] the decade and maybe the theologian who
[1:25:52] is actually uttering forth the the edict
[1:25:56] for the generation in terms of all of
[1:25:59] the theology schools. But we know that
[1:26:01] many times they say it was an apple. But
[1:26:04] everyone was born because of the fall in
[1:26:06] the garden by the desire the flesh
[1:26:08] desire of our parents. None of us chose
[1:26:12] to come to earth. I know. I don't recall
[1:26:15] saying, "Can I can I go and be born in
[1:26:17] Clarisome, Alberta? I just want to come
[1:26:20] to earth so bad. I just want to be a
[1:26:21] part of this world and and deal with all
[1:26:24] of the victories and all of the defeats.
[1:26:26] I want to experience all of the
[1:26:28] emotions.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:26:31] something happened. My parents caused my
[1:26:34] life to happen here." And we know that
[1:26:37] it was exactly according to the word of
[1:26:39] God.
[1:26:41] Every single one of us is born the way
[1:26:44] that we're born to fulfill the word of
[1:26:46] God.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; There has to be people to receive the
[1:26:50] word of God. There has to be people that
[1:26:52] will be born again because he has an
[1:26:55] elected group of people from before the
[1:26:57] foundation of the world in every single
[1:27:00] age that have to manifest the word for
[1:27:02] their day.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; But you know, because of that fall that
[1:27:08] happened, because of that flesh desire,
[1:27:11] God gave man an avenue of escape
[1:27:14] originally in the garden, didn't he?
[1:27:17] Adam and Eve, they wanted to actually
[1:27:19] cover up their sin. They wanted to take
[1:27:21] and make an an a new religion, right?
[1:27:24] They wanted to make aprons of leaves,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; a covering. And that's what happens to
[1:27:30] religion if we just have religion
[1:27:33] without the spirit.
[1:27:36] And don't think for a second that the
[1:27:38] message of the hour can't be just a
[1:27:40] religion to people
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; because we can be a part of a message
[1:27:44] group but not go all the way into Christ
[1:27:46] and have his spirit manifesting through
[1:27:49] our lives. That's why I think this
[1:27:51] question is so magnificent and
[1:27:53] beautiful. Whoever wrote it, God bless
[1:27:55] you. It's so vital to us. What does it
[1:27:58] mean to be truly born again? Well, it
[1:28:01] means that we've been born in sin shaped
[1:28:02] in iniquity to come to this world
[1:28:03] speaking lies. We have got to have an
[1:28:05] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:07] for ourselves.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Because we come from a message church,
[1:28:12] because we come from a message parent,
[1:28:14] it does not mean that we have the Holy
[1:28:17] Ghost.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Our parents are our protection, our
[1:28:22] leadership, our direction. We heard
[1:28:24] about it on Friday. It was so beautiful.
[1:28:26] I'm going to get into it a little bit,
[1:28:27] but we have we as parents, we are that
[1:28:29] protection. We are the Holy Ghost for
[1:28:31] our children, but only to a certain
[1:28:33] point. As soon as our children start to
[1:28:35] say, I can think for myself immediately
[1:28:38] is the count the point of
[1:28:39] accountability.
[1:28:41] They don't have to just leave the house.
[1:28:43] Sometimes they just start to make
[1:28:44] decisions on their own and they think,
[1:28:46] we know that children get this way.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; They get much smarter than their
[1:28:50] parents.
[1:28:53] Even when their parents say things, you
[1:28:54] can see the the wheels turning in their
[1:28:57] head and they know. They know. They
[1:28:59] know. Don't worry guys, not my kids.
[1:29:04] Of course, my kids. I see it all the
[1:29:06] time. And you know, shockingly, what I
[1:29:08] think is so cool, sometimes they're
[1:29:10] right.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they got better ideas than me.
[1:29:14] And I just think it's wonderful,
[1:29:16] especially when it comes to lifting and
[1:29:18] moving stuff.
[1:29:21] But you know, every one of us is subject
[1:29:23] to this curse, the fall in the garden.
[1:29:27] And and God gave us a way of escape, and
[1:29:30] it's through the blood. Adam and Eve
[1:29:32] attempted to have their own religion,
[1:29:34] and we know that God said, "That's nice
[1:29:36] and everything, but here's what it's
[1:29:38] going to be. It's going to be animals
[1:29:40] until the cross. It's going to be blood
[1:29:43] of bulls and goats. That's what it's
[1:29:45] going to be." And so, here's some animal
[1:29:47] skins. Now, kindly get out.
[1:29:50] And he kicked him out of the garden
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Go worship the way that
[1:29:54] you want to worship now. You chose your
[1:29:56] own way.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Go enjoy it."
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; And he put flaming swords in the hands
[1:30:02] of cherubams blocking their way to the
[1:30:05] tree of life, which was Christ. We know
[1:30:06] that. That was the garden. That was the
[1:30:08] story. And we know that in the day in
[1:30:11] which we live, those cherubams have been
[1:30:14] taken away.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it's actually death to us to
[1:30:20] stay out
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; to stay away from that tree of life.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Now it means death. It's exactly the
[1:30:28] opposite of the way it was in the Garden
[1:30:30] of Eden.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; But God gave man an avenue escape and
[1:30:34] that was through the blood.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:30:44] Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:30:51] So beautiful when we can see the word
[1:30:53] here and just see how it how it actually
[1:30:55] applies to us in the day in which we
[1:30:57] live.
[1:31:05] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1
[1:31:09] it says for the law having a shadow of
[1:31:12] good things to come
[1:31:14] and not the very image of the things
[1:31:18] can never with those sacrifices which
[1:31:21] they offered year by year continually
[1:31:25] make the comers there unto perfect.
[1:31:29] And we know that word perfect means
[1:31:32] complete mature. The blood of animals,
[1:31:36] bulls, and goats could never actually do
[1:31:38] that. It just never could. Verse two
[1:31:40] says, "For then would they not have
[1:31:43] ceased to be offered
[1:31:45] because that the worshippers once purged
[1:31:49] should have had no more conscience of
[1:31:52] sins."
[1:31:54] But in those sacrifices there is a
[1:31:57] remembrance again made of sins every
[1:32:00] year.
[1:32:03] For it is not possible that the blood of
[1:32:05] bulls and goats should take away sins.
[1:32:09] So brothers and sisters, I think it's
[1:32:10] important to remember that we can easily
[1:32:13] create a hybrid religion if we're not
[1:32:15] careful.
[1:32:17] If we come to the place where we believe
[1:32:19] that somehow I'm lost today
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; and I'm saved tomorrow and right now
[1:32:26] today I'm saved and tomorrow when Monday
[1:32:28] comes around something happens to me and
[1:32:30] well I trip and I fall and I'm lost.
[1:32:34] That is it's absolutely a lie.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; I'd say it's a denominational lie. I
[1:32:40] grew up in a Pentecostal church and they
[1:32:42] taught that very clearly that you need
[1:32:44] to get to the altar. You need to repent
[1:32:46] because you've fallen. We all fall.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; But if you're truly a son of God, you're
[1:32:52] always a son of God.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; You know what could happen? Someone in
[1:32:58] the world could come and try and tell
[1:32:59] one of my boys that they're not boys,
[1:33:02] that they're girls, and they're going to
[1:33:03] tell them they're crazy
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; because I know what I am.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Someone in the world could come and tell
[1:33:10] them that you're not the son of Barry
[1:33:13] Allen Johnson. and they'll laugh at them
[1:33:16] and say you're crazy.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; You can take a DNA test. You cannot
[1:33:20] change that fact. It's a fact.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And that's one of the things, one of the
[1:33:25] mysteries that William Brandham brought
[1:33:27] through the spoken word is the original
[1:33:29] seed is that you cannot be lost. You
[1:33:32] can't be saved today and lost tomorrow.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; If you are a son today, you always were
[1:33:39] a son. If you're a daughter today, you
[1:33:41] always were a daughter. You just
[1:33:43] recognized it one day
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; and there's always always a time
[1:33:49] appointed of the father
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; for people to recognize this is the day
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; and you know I'll tell you I'm so
[1:34:00] thankful we got a little bit of a a
[1:34:02] preacher cam
[1:34:04] and it's for worship and and I get to
[1:34:07] watch people worshiping and you can see
[1:34:08] those people that just have the liberty
[1:34:11] of the spirit They're free in the Lord
[1:34:14] to worship him.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to harp and and preach
[1:34:18] about worshiping, but there's something
[1:34:19] about it. When a person recognizes what
[1:34:21] it means to be redeemed,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; when I'm redeemed, and nobody can take
[1:34:26] that away from me, it doesn't matter how
[1:34:27] I feel. It doesn't matter what I say. It
[1:34:29] doesn't matter what I do. I'm a son. I'm
[1:34:32] a daughter. And that's that.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; There's a real liberty that comes over
[1:34:37] them. And it's an opportunity to give
[1:34:38] your praise back to God. I thought it
[1:34:41] was so beautiful last weekend to be
[1:34:42] clear. You know, there's coming a time
[1:34:44] where we're not going to be preaching
[1:34:45] the message. We're not going to be
[1:34:47] preaching the word. We're not going to
[1:34:48] be saying there's conduct, order, and
[1:34:50] doctrine. We've got to do things a
[1:34:52] certain way. We're going to be in
[1:34:53] heaven. We're going to be before the
[1:34:55] King of Kings. We're going to recognize
[1:34:57] that we were one of the few.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; And what are we going to do? We're going
[1:35:01] to worship him. We're going to worship
[1:35:04] him so passionately. All of heaven is
[1:35:06] going to be silent
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; just to listen to that group because no
[1:35:11] one else is redeemed in heaven
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; except those elected ones.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Nobody else in heaven. Remember the ones
[1:35:19] that rebelled? I remember having this
[1:35:22] question. Well, how could people be
[1:35:23] redeemed and not angels? That's God's
[1:35:26] choice,
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; not mine.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; I don't have to choose it. I don't have
[1:35:30] to understand it. I just need to know
[1:35:32] that I'm one of them. And when I sing
[1:35:35] that song, I'm so glad that I can say
[1:35:37] I'm one of them. I'm not so glad that I
[1:35:39] can say I'm a branomite. I'm so glad
[1:35:41] that I can say I'm one of those
[1:35:43] redeemed,
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; one of those redeemed ones that he
[1:35:47] called through the seventh angel
[1:35:49] messenger.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; And it changes the song alto together.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; It changes the perspective to recognize
[1:35:58] really what are we doing here?
[1:36:01] This is not about just getting together
[1:36:03] and having church. This is about
[1:36:05] recognizing that all of those people
[1:36:06] that went on before us, the heroes of
[1:36:09] the Bible, are leaning over the
[1:36:10] banisters of heaven saying, "Amen."
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; But you know, verse four says, "For it
[1:36:20] was impossible, for it was not possible
[1:36:22] that the blood of bulls and goats should
[1:36:24] take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh
[1:36:28] into the world, he saith, sacrifice and
[1:36:30] offering, thou wouldest not, but a body
[1:36:35] hast thou prepared me.
[1:36:38] And we know that goes back to Psalms 40.
[1:36:41] Verse 6 says, "And burnt offerings and
[1:36:44] sacrifices for sin, thou hast had no
[1:36:47] pleasure." Can you imagine through all
[1:36:50] of that? He's had no pleasure
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; since the fall, blood of bulls and
[1:36:54] goats, people coming in and bringing
[1:36:56] their sacrifice and then going home
[1:36:58] bringing the same desires, leaving with
[1:37:00] the same desires. Never a change in
[1:37:02] their life. They've done their spiritual
[1:37:04] duty. Amen. I came. I brought my
[1:37:06] sacrifice. God bless you. And they go
[1:37:09] home. The exact same people. Could you
[1:37:10] imagine? I I think it's astounding
[1:37:13] because some people try and do that
[1:37:15] here. But you know, when we do that
[1:37:16] here, we're only going to be worse or
[1:37:19] better. We're not going to leave the
[1:37:20] same because that's not the covenant
[1:37:22] that we live under.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; In burnt offerings and sacrifice for
[1:37:27] sin, thou hast had no pleasure. Then
[1:37:30] said I, lo, I come in the volume of the
[1:37:33] book, it is written of me to do thy
[1:37:36] will, oh God. above when he said
[1:37:39] sacrifice and offering and burnt
[1:37:42] offerings and offering for sin thou
[1:37:45] wouldest not neither had pleasure
[1:37:48] therein
[1:37:49] which are offered by the law.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Then said he, lo, I come to do thy will,
[1:37:56] oh God, he taketh away the first that he
[1:38:00] may establish the second. M
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; many times when we think about that
[1:38:05] prayer in the garden when Jesus said
[1:38:08] guys come let's pray what was he praying
[1:38:12] I read this and I think man that must
[1:38:14] have been a heavy prayer and we know it
[1:38:16] was because he sweat drops of blood that
[1:38:18] was the first atonement for our sins was
[1:38:21] his prayer saying these words in the
[1:38:24] garden
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; for us so that we could be here
[1:38:27] receiving this word
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; by the witch
[1:38:32] By the which will we are sanctified
[1:38:35] through the offering of the body of
[1:38:37] Jesus Christ once for all.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Once for all. And every priest standeth
[1:38:46] daily ministering and offering oftent
[1:38:49] times the same sacrifices which can
[1:38:52] never take away sins. That's why
[1:38:54] brothers and sisters, I'm going to pause
[1:38:55] right there. We're going to get into
[1:38:57] this a little further as we go, but I
[1:38:59] just want to say this. Let's not come to
[1:39:00] the house of the Lord and just offer the
[1:39:02] same sacrifices for sins and say, you
[1:39:04] know, I just did my duty. I did my civic
[1:39:07] spiritual duty and you know, I'm a
[1:39:08] message believer and bless God and go
[1:39:10] home and come back next week and go home
[1:39:13] and come back next week and go home and
[1:39:15] just live a different life when we go
[1:39:17] home and think that everything is okay
[1:39:19] when we go home and we come back and
[1:39:20] offer the same thing next week and
[1:39:22] everything is good because God's
[1:39:24] blessing us.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; That's not the way it's supposed to be.
[1:39:28] Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be on fire for the
[1:39:31] Lord in the lives in which we live. And
[1:39:33] it's supposed to make a change in our
[1:39:35] lives.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; If it's not making a change, there's
[1:39:38] something wrong in our lives.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; But isn't it beautiful? Because God came
[1:39:45] himself and said, you know what? I never
[1:39:47] did have pleasure in those sacrifices.
[1:39:49] So, I'm going to come and I'm going to
[1:39:50] actually make it happen myself. He came
[1:39:52] and made atonement once and for all for
[1:39:55] all of mankind. It's so beautiful. He
[1:39:58] came to be the total atonement.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; So for us to think that there's
[1:40:04] something that we can do that's going to
[1:40:06] garner us, that's going to merit us
[1:40:08] favor in the kingdom of heaven, we have
[1:40:11] a hybrid religion.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; It's crucial that we understand this,
[1:40:16] brothers and sisters, because there's
[1:40:17] nothing that we can do to merit our
[1:40:19] position in the kingdom of heaven other
[1:40:21] than just accepting it, saying, "Thank
[1:40:23] you, Lord."
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the greatest gift that
[1:40:25] we could ever have given to us.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom preaches that message.
[1:40:32] Works is faith.
[1:40:35] Tell me all about your faith.
[1:40:37] But I can see your works.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Big deal. You got so much faith. You
[1:40:41] know the message. You can quote the
[1:40:43] quotes. You've been a message believer
[1:40:45] your whole life. And all these things
[1:40:47] you have done from your youth.
[1:40:52] But there's one thing thou lacks. We
[1:40:55] heard it on Friday. It was so beautiful.
[1:40:58] Message believer from his youth, raised
[1:41:00] in a message home. Everything he did was
[1:41:03] precise.
[1:41:05] God even acknowledged that when he stood
[1:41:08] there and told him, but he said,
[1:41:09] "There's one thing thou lackest."
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; And remember, we heard it on Friday for
[1:41:14] those that didn't hear it. The love that
[1:41:16] was being expressed to him identified
[1:41:19] the lack.
[1:41:21] It was love that identified it. It
[1:41:24] wasn't it wasn't a scourging. It wasn't
[1:41:26] being brutal. It wasn't abusive. It was
[1:41:29] God saying, "If you just change this one
[1:41:31] thing in your life, you will see a
[1:41:33] greater success than you've ever
[1:41:34] imagined." And I say, "Lord, help me."
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; We're all sinners saved by grace.
[1:41:47] [snorts]
[1:41:50] You know Hebrews 10 verse 12.
[1:41:56] He says, "But this man after he had
[1:41:58] offered one sacrifice for sins forever."
[1:42:02] One sacrifice for sins forever.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And you know forever speaks of a space
[1:42:10] of time
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; that's not eternal.
[1:42:14] So I think it's important for us to
[1:42:15] recognize that space is a space of time
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; on earth.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; It is a space of time that we need it.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; It's God's provided way for us in the
[1:42:26] time that we need it.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Just like healing in our bodies. We
[1:42:29] don't need healing in the millennium.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; We don't need healing at the marriage
[1:42:33] supper of the lamb. We need healing
[1:42:35] right here and now.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; That's why we need healing. But this man
[1:42:40] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:42:42] sins forever sat down on the right hand
[1:42:46] of God. And we know that sitting down,
[1:42:49] it represents a lot.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; It looks like just as we read it, it's
[1:42:53] real simple, but that represents a lot.
[1:42:56] That represents power and authority and
[1:42:59] sovereignty of God to be able to sit
[1:43:01] down and take your rest. It's over. It's
[1:43:04] finished. There's nothing else that can
[1:43:06] be done. goes on in verse 13, from
[1:43:08] henceforth expecting
[1:43:11] till his enemies be made his foottool,
[1:43:13] knowing that it's completely finished.
[1:43:16] When he bowed his head and died on the
[1:43:18] cross, he knew exactly what was going
[1:43:20] on. Satan didn't know what was going on
[1:43:22] until he knocked on the door of hell and
[1:43:25] Satan thought, "Oh, I've got you now. I
[1:43:27] knew you were coming here. We expected
[1:43:29] you." But then he did what? He grabbed
[1:43:32] him by the throat and said, "Not this
[1:43:34] one, buddy.
[1:43:36] this time you failed.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; And he stripped him of the keys of death
[1:43:41] and hell.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And then what did he do? He led
[1:43:45] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:43:47] men.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Verse 14 says, "For by one offering he
[1:43:55] hath perfected,
[1:43:57] completed, set apart." He had perfected,
[1:44:01] completed, set apart, matured. He did it
[1:44:03] all. Jesus paid it all. All to him I
[1:44:07] owed.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Sin had left a crimson stain, but he
[1:44:12] left it white as snow.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; By one offering, he had perfected
[1:44:17] forever. Again, that space of time, he
[1:44:19] had perfected forever them that are
[1:44:23] sanctified.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[1:44:29] to us. So for people to say, well, I've
[1:44:32] got the Holy Ghost. I believe God sent
[1:44:34] the prophet and and I believe the
[1:44:36] message of the hour, but I'm still not
[1:44:38] afraid to just make sure that I always
[1:44:40] always come out on top on every single
[1:44:43] business deal that I do. And it doesn't
[1:44:46] matter who goes down because of it. They
[1:44:48] made a mistake and they're wrong and I'm
[1:44:50] right.
[1:44:52] But what about grace?
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; What about actually not digging up the
[1:44:57] past in a person's life and saying,
[1:44:59] "Don't you remember what you did to me
[1:45:01] 10 years ago? You did that to me.
[1:45:03] Remember,
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; we could talk about charity, which is
[1:45:09] love
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; in Corinthians.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; It's not puffed up.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; It doesn't vaunt itself. It's not always
[1:45:16] first. I don't have to be first in
[1:45:17] everything because I'm the king.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; No, no. The fathers of the homes are
[1:45:24] servants. Just like the pastor of the
[1:45:26] church is a servant to the church. Yeah.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; And as soon as we get that mentality,
[1:45:30] we're not fit for that office,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; unfortunately.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; And what we need is a character change.
[1:45:36] What we need is the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:38] Ghost.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; And when that happens, something happens
[1:45:41] in our life for us to say that I've got
[1:45:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but yet I
[1:45:45] still have these characteristics in my
[1:45:46] life. I don't have the baptism of the
[1:45:48] Holy Ghost.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this. We're going
[1:45:51] to say it straight out.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Ask your spouse.
[1:45:57] Ask your spouse. What do they say? Are
[1:45:58] you the same person at home that you are
[1:46:01] at church?
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're not, why aren't you?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Tell me why.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Is it because home is a better place and
[1:46:10] I can just let my hair down and behave
[1:46:12] differently?
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Why would we be different people at home
[1:46:15] than we are at church?
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Ask your children.
[1:46:19] Yes.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Do the children say that you're the same
[1:46:22] person that we see in church with the
[1:46:24] believers?
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; If they don't say it, why not?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, this is not time
[1:46:32] to fool around. We got to make sure that
[1:46:34] token is applied the right way in our
[1:46:37] homes, our children, our wives, our
[1:46:40] congregation, our church is depending on
[1:46:42] it.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; The death angel is coming through the
[1:46:47] land.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:48] and he don't care who he can devour. In
[1:46:51] fact, I think he has a special taste for
[1:46:53] children.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; And as parents, if we're not applying
[1:46:58] that token correctly by setting the
[1:47:00] example, sir,
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; not just saying it, by doing it,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; the devil's coming.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; He's going to eat your lunch.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; I think it's just beautiful this
[1:47:14] scripture here. Verse 15 says, "Whereof
[1:47:16] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us."
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; It's not just looking at brother and
[1:47:22] saying, "He's got the Holy Ghost. I can
[1:47:23] see the witness in his life." And just
[1:47:25] living my life and not expecting to see
[1:47:27] the Holy Ghost in my life. Brothers and
[1:47:29] sisters, don't look at anyone else. Look
[1:47:31] at yourselves in the mirror of God's
[1:47:33] word and say, "Do I see the Holy Ghost?"
[1:47:36] Because if I do see the Holy Ghost, then
[1:47:37] I've got every reason to have liberty to
[1:47:40] worship with all of my heart in the
[1:47:42] church of the living God. This is the
[1:47:44] place to let it roar. This is the place
[1:47:47] to let it go. Brother Bradom said we
[1:47:49] should be just as exuberant as all of
[1:47:51] those people out in the world. Anybody
[1:47:53] here ever been to a hockey game? NHL
[1:47:54] hockey game? Anybody? Go ahead. I'll say
[1:47:58] it's not sinful. We know that all things
[1:48:00] aren't expedient even though they're
[1:48:01] lawful.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; I mean, they play music there and they
[1:48:05] do things there. You go to a CFL game.
[1:48:08] Anybody gone to one of those? I've been
[1:48:09] to both. Anybody ever go to a a a
[1:48:13] cricket match?
[1:48:16] A cricket match when there's a stadium
[1:48:18] full of people and they really do
[1:48:20] whatever they do in cricket. I was
[1:48:22] there, but I don't even know how they
[1:48:23] play it. I know they got a paddle and
[1:48:25] it's made from really strong wood,
[1:48:27] really good wood. But we should be just
[1:48:29] as exuberant as they are.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; And so I want to say today, brothers and
[1:48:32] sisters, if we get exuberant for other
[1:48:34] things in the world, but we don't hear,
[1:48:36] what's our problem?
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; What are we missing? This is a
[1:48:40] sanctuary. And you know the sanctuary,
[1:48:42] sometimes we can have it in our minds.
[1:48:44] The sanctuary is the place, the holy of
[1:48:47] holies. It's behind the inner veil.
[1:48:48] Indeed, it is.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; And even a child running in an aisle
[1:48:53] after a service can upset the spirit for
[1:48:55] the next service.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Parents, it's important to make sure
[1:48:59] that we understand this. That's what the
[1:49:01] prophet said, not brother Barry. Amen.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; But what I'm saying is let's not look at
[1:49:09] it that way. Let's just change our
[1:49:10] perspective. Let's take another camera
[1:49:12] angle view at it and say this. This is
[1:49:15] the sanctuary of safety.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Where you can just let your hair down
[1:49:20] and worship the way that you always
[1:49:22] wanted to worship and said, "Maybe I
[1:49:24] wish I could just worship that way."
[1:49:26] Today's your day. You can do it.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait for some other
[1:49:31] day.
[1:49:32] This is your day.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; I said I wasn't going to preach on
[1:49:37] worship,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; but you know, God,
[1:49:41] he desires worship.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; And and he insists on it, in fact.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; And if we're not worshiping God, what
[1:49:49] are we worshiping? Because we as humans
[1:49:51] are created to worship something.
[1:49:54] [laughter]
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; We're going to worship something.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. And I'll tell you, if
[1:50:00] we're not worshiping God,
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; we're worshiping the wrong thing.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Because as we live our lives, we
[1:50:07] worship.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Whether we understand it, whether we
[1:50:10] accept it,
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; doesn't matter. Whether we comprehend
[1:50:13] it, as we breathe, as we live, as we
[1:50:16] work, as we aspire to do things in our
[1:50:19] lives and we dream and we build and we
[1:50:21] create and we do all this in our lives,
[1:50:23] we are worshiping. Amen.
[1:50:27] [laughter]
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to get into worship today.
[1:50:31] My But you know what it is? You got to
[1:50:34] go with the spirit.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; It's all we're going to have one day.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Is worship.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; So, I think it's important for us to
[1:50:45] just get used to it now. Get comfortable
[1:50:47] with it now. What a tremendous thing it
[1:50:49] is. What an opportunity it is.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; And worship isn't all about music. For
[1:50:53] the record,
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; let's make sure we underscore that it's
[1:50:56] not all about music. It's not all about
[1:50:57] singing.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; There's so many aspects to it. We heard
[1:51:03] about it on the weekend. If you want to
[1:51:04] go back and and watch it, you can. I
[1:51:06] don't want to preach on that today.
[1:51:08] Verse 16 says, "This is the covenant
[1:51:10] that I will make with them after those
[1:51:14] days." He's going to make a covenant
[1:51:15] with someone
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; after those days, sayeth the Lord. I
[1:51:18] will put my laws into their hearts,
[1:51:23] excuse me, and in their minds will I
[1:51:25] write them. Now, some people would want
[1:51:26] to say that's just for the Jews. We know
[1:51:29] that every scripture has a compound
[1:51:30] meaning and revelation. And we know that
[1:51:33] this actual scripture here was written
[1:51:35] to the Gentile church. So, let's not put
[1:51:37] this off onto the Jews.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Let's take this and eat it up.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Even if it makes our belly bitter,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; let's do it because it's going to change
[1:51:47] our bodies. Yeah,
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; I think it's so important to recognize
[1:51:50] that this is the covenant that I will
[1:51:52] make with them after those days, sayeth
[1:51:55] the Lord. I will put my laws into their
[1:51:58] hearts and in their minds will I write
[1:52:01] them. The Holy Ghost will say, "I like
[1:52:04] that." The Holy Ghost will say, "I don't
[1:52:06] like that."
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; And it's up to us to decide, are we
[1:52:10] going to act on it or not?
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; He's going to put his laws into our
[1:52:14] minds and into our hearts. Amen.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; That's how it's going to happen. It's
[1:52:19] not brother Barry preaching. It's not
[1:52:21] brother Eugene preaching. It's not
[1:52:22] brother Jerry preaching. It's not some
[1:52:24] other ministry out there doing it for
[1:52:26] us. It's the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy
[1:52:29] Ghost himself inside of us.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Writing it in our minds and our hearts.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; But it's so beautiful because verse 17
[1:52:39] says, "In their sins and iniquities will
[1:52:40] I remember no more."
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Remember we preached on this a while
[1:52:43] ago. When we are willing to actually
[1:52:46] reject this flesh, when we're willing to
[1:52:48] reject the mark of the beast and accept
[1:52:50] the Holy Ghost instead of the opposite,
[1:52:52] resisting the Holy Ghost baptism and
[1:52:54] saying, "I'm good. I'm good. I've had
[1:52:56] it. I know that everything is fine.
[1:52:58] There's nothing else that you could
[1:52:59] teach me." As long as we have that
[1:53:00] behavior, we don't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; But as long as we're saying amen to the
[1:53:05] word of God, that is him pulling on his
[1:53:08] word.
[1:53:10] Hallelujah.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; But to think that there's coming a time
[1:53:13] where there's sins and iniquities. Well,
[1:53:15] I remember no more. Some people want to
[1:53:18] put that off to the millennium. Some
[1:53:20] people want to say amen. That's me right
[1:53:22] now. Right here. Right here. Right now.
[1:53:24] And I can say amen to that word because
[1:53:26] I know what it means.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not the same person that I used to
[1:53:30] be. Right
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; now where there is remission of the
[1:53:35] where remission of these is there is no
[1:53:38] more offering for sin
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; saying Lord forgive me I'm a sinner I
[1:53:43] don't have to pray pray the sinner's
[1:53:45] prayer even though we don't do that in
[1:53:47] in in how we believe but we recognize
[1:53:51] there comes a time where we have to say
[1:53:52] that I'm a sinner and I need the Lord I
[1:53:54] need his covenant I need this covenant
[1:53:56] for me it's good to look at it and say
[1:53:59] that somebody gets it somewhere along
[1:54:00] the way. But what about me? It needs to
[1:54:03] be for me. Having therefore, brethren, I
[1:54:07] want to say this today. This is where we
[1:54:08] need to get to. Boldness to enter into
[1:54:10] the holiest by the blood of Jesus. Not
[1:54:12] by our blood. Not by some other
[1:54:14] ministry's blood. By the blood of Jesus,
[1:54:16] not by the blood of William, Mary, and
[1:54:18] Brandham. By the blood of Jesus is what
[1:54:20] the word of God says. By a new and what?
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Living
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; living way
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ in flesh. again,
[1:54:29] his spirit walking and talking in man
[1:54:32] again. Some people would say, "Well,
[1:54:34] there you go. You're talking about a
[1:54:35] deity spirit." No, I ain't. But yes, I
[1:54:37] am.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:40] taking up his abode in our lives through
[1:54:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to get into answering
[1:54:46] some of these questions. I'll say it
[1:54:48] right now. One of them, how will we know
[1:54:49] that we have the baptism of the Holy
[1:54:51] Ghost? Will our will our actions change?
[1:54:54] You bet.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; You bet. So if we're still living our
[1:54:58] lives acting the same way that we've
[1:55:00] always acted, do we have the baptism of
[1:55:02] the Holy Ghost?
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Because he's not going to be contrary to
[1:55:07] his word.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; He's going to have the characteristics
[1:55:11] of his word.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; He's not going to have the
[1:55:14] characteristics, even though we probably
[1:55:15] should say the characteristics of
[1:55:18] Brother Barry or Brother Jerry or
[1:55:20] Brother Eugene, is he going to have the
[1:55:22] characteristics of a minister? We
[1:55:24] certainly hope so. We certainly hope
[1:55:26] that the ministers would actually have
[1:55:27] his characteristics, but don't look to
[1:55:30] ministry, brothers and sisters. Look to
[1:55:31] him.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; That's the characteristics that we want.
[1:55:34] And if you wonder what they are, they're
[1:55:36] in the word. I'm not going to dig into
[1:55:38] them too far today. I don't I don't want
[1:55:40] to do that today. I just want to try and
[1:55:41] answer these questions. They're so rich,
[1:55:44] so amazing to look at it. Having
[1:55:46] therefore, brethren, boldness to enter
[1:55:48] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[1:55:50] by a new and living way, which he hath
[1:55:53] consecrated for us through the veil,
[1:55:56] that is to say, his flesh, and having an
[1:55:59] high priest over the house of God, let
[1:56:01] us draw near
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; with a true heart
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; in full assurance of faith,
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:56:10] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:56:13] pure water. My
[1:56:16] verse 23 says, "Let us hold fast the
[1:56:18] profession of our faith without
[1:56:20] wavering." Let's not go right hand or
[1:56:22] left hand. Let's stay exactly straight
[1:56:24] with the word.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Without wavering, for he is faithful
[1:56:29] that promised.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; He's faithful that promised. He will
[1:56:33] always always lift us up.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; And let us consider what? One another to
[1:56:40] provoke unto love.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; And to good works. Isn't it interesting
[1:56:44] how automatically it goes into provoking
[1:56:47] one another
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; to love
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; to good works
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; one to another? And we know that that's
[1:56:52] the same thing in the book of Ephesians
[1:56:54] chapter 5. Before we get into talking
[1:56:56] about roles, oh the husband and the
[1:56:58] wife, and you better behave this way and
[1:57:00] behave that way, how about we submit
[1:57:02] ourselves unto one another
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; in the fear of God first.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; First, let's do that.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, we uh we heard about
[1:57:11] it, I believe on Wednesday, that, you
[1:57:14] know, faith is based on forgiveness.
[1:57:17] If we're not willing to forgive, then do
[1:57:19] we really have faith?
[1:57:23] But let's hold fast the profession of
[1:57:24] our faith without wavering, for he is
[1:57:26] faithful that promised. And let us
[1:57:27] consider one another to provoke unto
[1:57:28] love and to good works. And we know he
[1:57:31] goes on to say, "Not forsaking the
[1:57:32] assembling of ourselves together as the
[1:57:34] manner of some is." Sometimes we can
[1:57:37] read that scripture and just say that
[1:57:38] and leave the rest of it out. I think
[1:57:40] it's important to get the whole thing.
[1:57:41] But exhorting one another, encouraging
[1:57:44] one another, loving one another, and so
[1:57:46] much more as you see the day
[1:57:48] approaching. We've said it before in the
[1:57:49] past many times. You know, sometimes
[1:57:51] when we go to church, we don't feel like
[1:57:52] it in our flesh. But maybe it's not for
[1:57:54] us. Maybe we're not going to church to
[1:57:56] get a blessing for ourselves. Maybe
[1:57:57] we're going to be a blessing for someone
[1:57:59] else because as they struggle in their
[1:58:00] lives, they're going to go to church and
[1:58:02] they're going to feel alone like nobody
[1:58:04] else is going through it. But they're
[1:58:05] going to look around and they're going
[1:58:06] to say, "There's brother so and so.
[1:58:07] There's sister so and so. Look at this
[1:58:10] family's here. Oh my, look at this
[1:58:12] family here. And everyone is so happy."
[1:58:14] Why is it?
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Because it's the spirit of God.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost living out through
[1:58:20] people.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; I love this this question. Whoever wrote
[1:58:23] it, my what does it mean to be truly
[1:58:26] born again? To be truly born again, it
[1:58:30] means that we have the Holy Ghost in our
[1:58:31] lives.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; That's what it means. To be truly born
[1:58:35] again doesn't mean we come to church and
[1:58:36] that we take a step of faith and we say
[1:58:39] I I surrender my life to God and that I
[1:58:42] just want to be saved now and hopefully
[1:58:44] somewhere along the way it's going to
[1:58:46] happen. No, we do do that. We do do that
[1:58:49] and we keep walking and we hold fast the
[1:58:51] profession of our faith. We keep coming
[1:58:53] to church and we keep feeding on the
[1:58:55] word. But there comes a point in time
[1:58:57] where we truly do get baptized with the
[1:58:59] Holy Ghost. And I'll tell you what, that
[1:59:01] is the new birth. Amen.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Because us coming to church is just an
[1:59:05] association.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Us coming to church, being born in a
[1:59:09] message church, that is not the new
[1:59:11] birth.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; That's the old birth.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; The new birth is where I can say I'm so
[1:59:17] glad that I can say I'm one of them. I
[1:59:20] know that Jesus lives for me. I have a
[1:59:23] personal experience with him myself
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; and it becomes apparent to everyone
[1:59:29] around.
[1:59:30] You know, the the next question is, is
[1:59:33] it a different feeling? And I believe
[1:59:34] all of these answers from these
[1:59:36] questions here, they answer the first
[1:59:39] question.
[1:59:40] What is it truly? What does it mean to
[1:59:42] truly have the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:43] Ghost? Is it a different feeling? Is it
[1:59:45] a different feeling? I I think we could
[1:59:47] look at this and say, "Well, yes, it
[1:59:49] is." But no, it's not. We don't get a
[1:59:52] different feeling. And I've got a
[1:59:54] feeling, so I know I can feel that I've
[1:59:56] got the Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham
[1:59:57] said, "The Holy Ghost is without
[1:59:58] sensation.
[2:00:00] The power of the highest overshadowed
[2:00:02] Mary and she brought forth a life inside
[2:00:05] of her.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; She did,
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't with a sensation.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; But I do know one thing. It would have
[2:00:13] been with emotion.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; That's where I think it's so important
[2:00:17] to recognize, brothers and sisters,
[2:00:19] that's a big scarecrow in and around the
[2:00:20] message where people will say, "You
[2:00:22] can't have emotion.
[2:00:24] The Holy Ghost is without sensation."
[2:00:26] Remember, that's what he said. It's
[2:00:27] without sensation. He didn't say it's
[2:00:29] without emotion.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; When you get the Holy Ghost, some people
[2:00:32] scream, some people run, some people
[2:00:35] shout, some people cry, some people
[2:00:37] sing, some people speak in tongues, some
[2:00:40] people have a gift of prophecy, of
[2:00:42] faith, of healing. We know there's lots
[2:00:44] of different manifestations of the Holy
[2:00:46] Ghost, but all of them line up in one
[2:00:50] place, and that is with the ability to
[2:00:52] say amen to the word for their day.
[2:00:54] Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Is it a different feeling?
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Getting the Holy Ghost in our lives. Is
[2:01:01] it a different feeling? It is a
[2:01:03] different feeling in that you begin to
[2:01:05] feel differently
[2:01:06] about things.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; You begin to feel differently about
[2:01:11] people.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes tremendous great hurts in our
[2:01:16] lives
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; can actually just be absolved,
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; right? and dissolved and just vanish.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can have a buzzsaw temper
[2:01:28] and always be looking for conflict with
[2:01:30] people
[2:01:32] and something happens when we get the
[2:01:33] Holy Ghost in our life and we have a new
[2:01:35] character. There's new characteristics
[2:01:37] that start to come out. I feel different
[2:01:39] in my life. Indeed, yes, you do feel
[2:01:42] different, but you feel different
[2:01:43] towards situations and you feel
[2:01:45] different towards people and you feel
[2:01:47] different especially towards the word of
[2:01:49] God. You feel different about wanting to
[2:01:52] go to church. You feel different about
[2:01:55] wanting to sing. You feel different
[2:01:56] about wanting to say amen. You
[2:01:58] definitely do feel different. But you
[2:02:01] don't feel different in such a way that
[2:02:02] I had a chill run over me, so I must I
[2:02:04] must have the Holy Ghost. Oh my, I
[2:02:05] raised my hands in church and and I felt
[2:02:07] this warmth just come over me, so I must
[2:02:10] have the Holy Ghost. No, not that kind
[2:02:12] of a feeling.
[2:02:14] If it's an earthly sense, then we're
[2:02:16] actually missing the point because all
[2:02:18] of our earthly senses are designed for
[2:02:20] us to contact this earthly world around
[2:02:23] us.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; But there's another sense which is the
[2:02:26] faith sense. And that one is the one
[2:02:29] that dials in to what we're talking
[2:02:31] about today. Is it a different feeling?
[2:02:32] Indeed, it is a different feeling. You
[2:02:34] have a different opinion, a different
[2:02:36] feeling about everything around you. You
[2:02:39] get a totally different perspective
[2:02:40] about this word and about the world
[2:02:42] around you. When people see it,
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; don't think it's invisible. We say it
[2:02:47] many times. It's the invisible union of
[2:02:49] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Sure enough, it is. But after a while,
[2:02:53] when you recognize really what he says
[2:02:55] in that message, and you begin to live
[2:02:57] what he says in that message, what
[2:02:59] happens to you is it becomes a visible
[2:03:01] union of the bride of Jesus Christ and
[2:03:03] the heavenly bridegroom. It becomes very
[2:03:06] visible because you no longer are the
[2:03:08] same. You become a new creature in
[2:03:10] Christ Jesus.
[2:03:17] It's so beautiful. There's only one way
[2:03:19] that you can contact it and it's by
[2:03:21] faith.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Only believe and all things are
[2:03:25] possible.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; The next question,
[2:03:31] what happens to your actions?
[2:03:33] What happens to your actions?
[2:03:36] Brother Brandham, he talks about it. You
[2:03:38] know, how how to deal with things in
[2:03:39] your life. And you know if you do things
[2:03:41] that you don't like and uh I don't have
[2:03:44] the quote with me but I just think it's
[2:03:45] so beautiful how the Lord brings things
[2:03:47] to our remembrance. He says if you want
[2:03:49] to actually change things in your life
[2:03:51] just do the opposites.
[2:03:53] And he says this if you're a spoiled
[2:03:55] brat and you always want your way and
[2:03:58] you always want things to be first you
[2:04:01] you're first with everything. He says
[2:04:03] take just let somebody else have the
[2:04:05] first. Take a step back. If you're
[2:04:08] always angry because of things, start
[2:04:11] smiling.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Take a step back and recognize it. I was
[2:04:14] having a conversation with a brother and
[2:04:15] we were talking about earthly things.
[2:04:18] And it came to the place in the
[2:04:19] conversation where he said, "You know
[2:04:21] what happens is I just get anxiety as I
[2:04:23] start to talk about all these different
[2:04:24] things." And really what I need to do is
[2:04:26] just take a step back and breathe and
[2:04:28] say, "God's got this all under his
[2:04:30] control."
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; And when we can do that, it brings a
[2:04:33] rest.
[2:04:36] But if we're busy getting fussed about
[2:04:37] this and fussed about that and fussed
[2:04:39] about the other thing and this other
[2:04:40] problem and this and that and this and
[2:04:42] that, they're all they're all
[2:04:44] distractions of the devil.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Why are we letting Satan do that to us?
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Why are we letting the devil do that to
[2:04:51] us? We don't have to.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; But what happens to your actions?
[2:04:57] I think it's a beautiful question. This
[2:04:59] is so good. I'm going to try and answer
[2:05:01] it all today. I hope it's okay. Maybe
[2:05:03] we'll go maybe I'll just warn you maybe
[2:05:05] 10 minutes over. Lord willing maybe we
[2:05:07] can finish it up in time. It's 10 to 12
[2:05:09] now. I don't want to try and keep us too
[2:05:12] long. But we've got some questions and I
[2:05:13] want to try and get somewhere with them.
[2:05:15] I want to try and answer them. And if
[2:05:16] anybody as we talk about all this along
[2:05:18] the way, if you have more questions
[2:05:20] about what I've said, Lord willing, I'm
[2:05:22] hoping that I'm answering them, but I
[2:05:23] don't want to create more questions. But
[2:05:25] even if I do, don't feel bashful. Write
[2:05:27] them down and and and and let's answer
[2:05:29] them. Let's study them together and
[2:05:30] learn and grow together. Amen.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; What happens to your actions? And and
[2:05:35] this is just some of my notes here.
[2:05:36] Usually people begin to act differently.
[2:05:38] That's what happens to your actions. You
[2:05:41] begin to act differently because the
[2:05:43] word says that you become a new creature
[2:05:45] in Christ Jesus. You don't remain the
[2:05:47] same when you get the baptism of the
[2:05:49] Holy Ghost. And for people to say that
[2:05:51] they are the same, maybe they are. Maybe
[2:05:54] they got the baptism at an early age.
[2:05:56] Maybe.
[2:05:57] But maybe not.
[2:05:59] I would say if our actions line up with
[2:06:01] the word of God, I would say yes indeed
[2:06:03] we did get the baptism of the Holy
[2:06:05] Ghost. But if we've got attributes in
[2:06:06] our life, if we've got things in our
[2:06:07] life that are identifiers, like we said
[2:06:10] earlier, if we were to ask a spouse, if
[2:06:12] we were to ask the children, what are we
[2:06:14] when we're at home, are we the same
[2:06:15] people? If we're not, we've got these
[2:06:18] things in our life, these actions,
[2:06:20] there's things that we need to deal
[2:06:21] with. And you know, this answers one of
[2:06:23] the other questions as we get there, but
[2:06:25] our actions, they need to be different.
[2:06:28] If we just simply say, "I've got it and
[2:06:30] I'm not willing to change in my life,"
[2:06:32] then there's a huge problem. Because you
[2:06:34] know what one of the biggest identifiers
[2:06:36] is with the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[2:06:38] brothers and sisters, is humility.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Being humble,
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; being able to say, "I'm wrong."
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; And and here's the bigger one in a
[2:06:52] marriage for those people who are
[2:06:53] married that really seem to struggle
[2:06:55] with this. And I I'm saying it because I
[2:06:57] know I do. I want to say I did. But to
[2:07:01] say I'm sorry.
[2:07:03] I I know that I did that and I know that
[2:07:05] that hurt you just now.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; And to deal with it right then
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; instead of taking it with me and saying
[2:07:12] and going away, right?
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; And how long does it take to get it all
[2:07:17] better? Because the longer it's left
[2:07:18] like that, the worse it gets.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; And many times we just pretend. I just
[2:07:24] pretend. I'll say it my way. I just
[2:07:25] pretend, you know, it didn't happen.
[2:07:27] It's okay. Whatever. It did happen.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be right there until I
[2:07:33] go back and say, "I'm sorry."
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; But you know, sometimes sometimes it
[2:07:40] happens in life. We do things in a
[2:07:42] marriage specifically that we can't
[2:07:44] undo. There's no fixing it and there's
[2:07:45] no making it better. And the only thing
[2:07:48] that we can do is say, "I'm sorry." And
[2:07:50] the only thing that we can do is hope
[2:07:52] that that person has the level of
[2:07:54] revelation that maybe I do and that they
[2:07:56] would offer the level of forgiveness
[2:07:58] that I'm hoping that they can bring.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what, when we're
[2:08:04] encountering those situations, the only
[2:08:06] hope for forgiveness is full complete
[2:08:10] humility.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; As soon as we start bristling and
[2:08:13] saying, you know, whatever about that,
[2:08:15] now there's this. Guess what? We're
[2:08:18] going right back to square one. right
[2:08:19] back to zero again. And it's never going
[2:08:22] to get better. It's always going to be
[2:08:23] this cycle of problem and problem. Why
[2:08:26] is it? Because that's never been dealt
[2:08:27] with correctly. All we've got to do is
[2:08:29] deal with it correctly. But what happens
[2:08:31] to our actions is people begin to act
[2:08:33] differently. They do.
[2:08:35] For us to say that I've got the baptism
[2:08:37] of the Holy Ghost and I'm the same
[2:08:39] person that I used to be is a lie of the
[2:08:41] devil.
[2:08:43] And I really welcome the conversation
[2:08:44] with anyone to say, "Well, I believe
[2:08:47] that I I have it and and I'm the same
[2:08:49] person."
[2:08:51] You're not the same person. No one has
[2:08:54] ever had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:56] and stayed the same way.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; So, what would make us think that we're
[2:09:02] exclusive?
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; I I know what a religious spirit.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; And unfortunately, that's the worst one.
[2:09:13] There's countless examples in the Bible
[2:09:15] if you if you wonder. I'm not making
[2:09:17] this up. There's countless examples of
[2:09:19] the of it in the Bible where people some
[2:09:22] people they couldn't see and they got
[2:09:23] their eyesight. They're not the same
[2:09:25] person. Some people they couldn't walk
[2:09:27] but they can walk.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; They were able to move.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Something happened to them in their
[2:09:32] lives. Some people they couldn't hear or
[2:09:34] be able to talk and they began to hear
[2:09:36] and they were able to talk. Remember,
[2:09:38] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:09:40] forever. Some people who met Jesus, they
[2:09:43] just simply stopped doing what they were
[2:09:45] doing and lived a totally different life
[2:09:46] altogether.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And that's kind of the category that we
[2:09:49] fit in, eh? Isn't it? Because we can
[2:09:51] see, we can hear, we can talk, we can
[2:09:53] walk, we can sing, everything is good in
[2:09:56] our lives.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; But every single one of those people,
[2:10:00] they lined up with the word
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; when they met the word for their day.
[2:10:04] Boy, I really wanted to get into what we
[2:10:06] talked about on Friday night. And Lord
[2:10:08] willing, I think maybe we'll be able to
[2:10:10] in the next few minutes here. I I think
[2:10:12] it's so important to us to to recognize
[2:10:14] it. Maybe just in the last few minutes.
[2:10:16] You know, every single one of the
[2:10:18] people, the examples that we just
[2:10:19] mentioned in the Bible, they all lined
[2:10:21] up with the word of God in the day in
[2:10:23] which they lived. Whether it was with
[2:10:24] Jesus, whether it was in any one of the
[2:10:26] church ages that we talk about so often,
[2:10:29] everyone lined up with the word for
[2:10:31] their day. That was the evidence of the
[2:10:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; When someone says they're born again and
[2:10:38] their lives don't line up with the word,
[2:10:40] they're not truly born again.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; That's brother Barry saying it straight.
[2:10:45] But the prophet of God says it, too. He
[2:10:47] says it in that message. Ye must be born
[2:10:50] again.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Go and listen to it.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; I've got a quote, one quote that I'm
[2:10:54] going to read as we as we wrap it up
[2:10:56] here. But the last one, I think it is.
[2:10:58] Is it? Yeah. The last one here of the
[2:11:02] four questions or the three parts to the
[2:11:04] one question is how do you change? And I
[2:11:07] think it's so beautiful. It's like
[2:11:09] somebody wanted me to preach this
[2:11:10] service. So they put them in there and
[2:11:13] crafted it this way so that we would
[2:11:14] actually preach it in such a way that it
[2:11:16] just goes full circle. So we know about
[2:11:19] the problem, brother Barry. We get it.
[2:11:21] How do we change? Isn't it beautiful to
[2:11:24] think that there is an opportunity for a
[2:11:26] solution to the problem? Amen.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you,
[2:11:31] he created us to be a certain way,
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; didn't he?
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; He created us in his image.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Many times we think about, well, he was
[2:11:40] a spirit and, you know, male and female
[2:11:42] created he them and in his image. He
[2:11:44] created us in the image of God. We've
[2:11:46] got arms and legs and and a head and,
[2:11:48] you know, we can imagine what God looks
[2:11:50] like. But I want to say it this way. He
[2:11:52] created us in his image to be a free
[2:11:54] will agent. Amen.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; God can make a choice, but his choice is
[2:12:00] always going to line up with his word.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; And he's given us the choice. Are we
[2:12:05] going to line up with his word?
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Because it's a choice.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; We have got to choose where we stand.
[2:12:12] And we know that we we've heard it many
[2:12:14] times. Choose ye this day.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Whom are you going to serve? Who who are
[2:12:19] you going to serve? Are you going to
[2:12:20] follow Kora and Dayan? You going to
[2:12:22] follow all of the cunningly devised
[2:12:25] fables, all of the traditional teachings
[2:12:27] of man, teaching for doctrines, the
[2:12:30] commandments of men instead of following
[2:12:33] the the lively word that we talked about
[2:12:35] this morning, leadership of the Holy
[2:12:37] Ghost in our lives. How do you change?
[2:12:39] One sentence, I could answer it. You
[2:12:41] fully surrender your entire will.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; You fully surrender your entire will.
[2:12:49] And some people can do it and some
[2:12:51] people just can't. And it's not up to us
[2:12:52] to decide it.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; It's only up to us to just follow the
[2:12:56] leadership of the Lord in our own lives.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; And our actions will show who is who.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; We don't have to determine it. It's not
[2:13:03] up to us to determine it.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; And you know, I I just think it's so
[2:13:07] beautiful because the brother sang that
[2:13:09] song this morning. Brother Faren, thank
[2:13:10] you.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; I'll say yes.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; We sang that song. I'll say yes, Lord.
[2:13:17] Amen.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; But you know, in my notes, I wrote this
[2:13:20] down early this morning as I was
[2:13:22] studying this, as I was meditating on
[2:13:24] this a as we were trying to to to to
[2:13:28] come to a place where I felt the
[2:13:30] leadership of the Lord. And you know
[2:13:31] what came to my heart was how do you
[2:13:33] know h how can you actually do this? How
[2:13:36] do you get the change in your life? I
[2:13:39] want to say this. It came to me this
[2:13:41] morning. It's like that party game that
[2:13:43] you would hear. Now, some people might
[2:13:44] say, "Well, you're getting very carnal,
[2:13:46] Brother Barry, for such a spiritual
[2:13:47] moment." But I believe it is exactly
[2:13:49] like that. And here's why. We sang the
[2:13:52] song to actually show me that it is
[2:13:54] exactly right.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; I'll say yes, Lord. It's like the party
[2:13:58] game where you just say yes to
[2:14:01] everything that's spoken to you. Amen.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing when you think
[2:14:07] about it because I know if I was a child
[2:14:10] and I know that my parents have said no
[2:14:12] to me about many different things, but I
[2:14:14] know now because of the the the covenant
[2:14:17] of the game, they're just going to say
[2:14:18] yes to every single thing that I say.
[2:14:21] Can you imagine that?
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; But you know, brothers and sisters, I
[2:14:25] don't think it's any different.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Is it any different?
[2:14:29] We say yes to every single thing the
[2:14:32] word of God says to us in our lives.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; And when we make excuses
[2:14:39] and we say, "Well, maybe maybe not now."
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Guess what? You said no.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; When you say not now, you said no.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; And you could walk out of the place
[2:14:49] you're in when you say not now and not
[2:14:52] have the opportunity. We heard it on
[2:14:54] Friday. the rich young ruler. He came
[2:14:57] and went face to face with the word of
[2:14:59] God.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; And he said to him, "You know what? All
[2:15:03] of the things that you said you've done
[2:15:05] from your youth is true. You have served
[2:15:08] me faithfully.
[2:15:11] But you know what? Take all you've got,
[2:15:15] sell it, and come and follow me."
[2:15:18] While I was listening to this, I
[2:15:20] thought, man, you know, there's some
[2:15:21] people, some spirits that would say,
[2:15:23] yeah, they're probably saying that
[2:15:25] because he wanted all that tithe.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; But you know what? He he probably
[2:15:29] couldn't manage all that money if God
[2:15:33] gave it to him,
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; not recognizing that he was talking to
[2:15:36] God. All of that money that he got came
[2:15:38] from God.
[2:15:42] There's not one penny that that rich
[2:15:43] young ruler got that Jesus did not
[2:15:46] allow.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; And we heard it on Friday. I thought it
[2:15:50] was so good that he probably got all of
[2:15:52] that money through godly means.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; He was a godly man.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; But the love that was in God right there
[2:16:01] before him told him, "You know what?
[2:16:03] This is going to corrupt you. And unless
[2:16:06] you're willing to let go of your riches,
[2:16:10] and follow me with all of your heart.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; These riches are going to take you down,
[2:16:16] boy.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; And you know what? He was sorrowful is
[2:16:20] what the word says.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Immediately he was sorrowful because he
[2:16:24] knew that he trusted in the wrong thing.
[2:16:28] He trusted in his ability with his
[2:16:31] riches.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; And we know that took him down because
[2:16:36] the next part of the story is he lifted
[2:16:37] up his eyes in hell. Mhm.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; And he of course demanded that there
[2:16:44] should be things going on in his life,
[2:16:46] right? Oh my. Get that Lazarus guy to go
[2:16:48] and dip his finger in water because I
[2:16:51] deserve to have my tongue cool. What do
[2:16:53] you deserve when you're in hell? You
[2:16:55] don't deserve nothing.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Boy, when we get to that place, it's not
[2:16:59] a good place.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; But we don't have to go there.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Alls we have to do is say yes.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; We just got to be willing to say yes. It
[2:17:09] sounds crazy. I know it. But I believe
[2:17:11] the Lord just showed me that this
[2:17:12] morning. Every single time, we need to
[2:17:14] be willing to say yes. And And how do
[2:17:16] you know that? How How do I know that? I
[2:17:18] know it by experience. I encountered it
[2:17:20] in my life. I I just can't explain it
[2:17:22] any other way, brothers and sisters.
[2:17:24] When you hear that you should tithe,
[2:17:26] what are you going to say?
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; When you hear that you should give an
[2:17:30] offering, what are you going to say?
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you should. I say let you
[2:17:35] make the decision. When the word of God
[2:17:38] through a vindicated prophet says you
[2:17:40] should go to church, you should have the
[2:17:42] desire in your heart to go to church
[2:17:43] every time the doors are open, what are
[2:17:45] you going to say
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; when when when he says that you should
[2:17:49] go to church half an hour early just so
[2:17:51] you can get all of the humanity out of
[2:17:53] the way so that you can actually get
[2:17:56] into the spirit of things.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; What are you going to say
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; when he says don't cut hair? What are
[2:18:02] you going to say when he says don't wear
[2:18:03] garments that pertain to a man? What are
[2:18:05] you going to say
[2:18:07] when he says if you've been baptized in
[2:18:09] the name of the father and of the son
[2:18:11] and of the holy ghost means you haven't
[2:18:14] even been baptized at all.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; What are you going to say?
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; But he doesn't leave you there, does he?
[2:18:20] He says, "Have you have you been
[2:18:22] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:18:23] Christ?"
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; Since you believe,
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; but what are you going to say? That's
[2:18:28] what it comes down to. What are you
[2:18:30] going to say when the word of God comes
[2:18:31] your way, comes across your path? What
[2:18:33] are you going to say? Because every
[2:18:35] single time it happens and you know that
[2:18:37] it's contrary to the way that you see
[2:18:39] things, the way that you believe things,
[2:18:41] the way that you live things, when you
[2:18:44] reach that crossroads, sometimes the
[2:18:46] crossroads, brothers and sisters, too,
[2:18:48] is just a little tiny deviation.
[2:18:50] Sometimes it's just what we call a fork
[2:18:51] in the road, right? And sometimes that
[2:18:53] road can run parallel for miles and
[2:18:56] miles and miles. But other times it's a
[2:18:58] crossroad where you have to come to a
[2:19:00] complete stop and then make a turn and
[2:19:02] go the other direction. And remember,
[2:19:03] brother Brandham said, "We're not
[2:19:05] building a h we're not building a wall
[2:19:06] any longer where we're just going down
[2:19:08] the wall and building it up and going
[2:19:09] down the wall and building it up. We're
[2:19:11] building a house." In the message, the
[2:19:13] rapture, he said it very clearly that
[2:19:15] we're building a house. It's a
[2:19:16] three-dimensional object. And you know,
[2:19:18] in this message, ye must be born again.
[2:19:20] He talks about it with a contractor, how
[2:19:22] if a contractor built him a house and he
[2:19:25] went down there to see that house that
[2:19:26] that contractor built him and he paid
[2:19:28] him money to build it according to the
[2:19:30] blueprint and he saw that things were
[2:19:32] not the way it was supposed to be
[2:19:33] according to the blueprint. He's not
[2:19:35] going to say, "Oh, that's cool.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. We'll just leave
[2:19:40] it that way." No. Every single thing
[2:19:42] that a person puts into a house when
[2:19:44] they custom design a house has a
[2:19:46] purpose.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; He's going to say, "Tear it down."
[2:19:49] That's not what I paid you for.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the way it is for us
[2:19:54] in the day in which we live. Unless
[2:19:56] we've got the right foundation, unless
[2:19:57] we've got the Holy Ghost in our lives,
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; all the rest of it doesn't mean
[2:20:01] anything.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; In fact, I think it does. Forgive me.
[2:20:04] The rest of it means religion.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, we just have a
[2:20:08] nice covering. We've got a great
[2:20:10] association,
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; a great fellowship. And and I don't
[2:20:13] think that you could choose better
[2:20:14] people to fellowship with. To be honest
[2:20:15] with you, the best people on earth are
[2:20:18] these people right here.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; But why would we want to come only so
[2:20:23] far? Have just a so far religion where
[2:20:25] I'm only going to go so far and I don't
[2:20:27] care what you tell me. I don't care how
[2:20:29] you say it to me. It's only going to do
[2:20:31] this much to me. I I just don't
[2:20:33] understand that for the life of me. Why
[2:20:35] would we want that? Why wouldn't we want
[2:20:37] to have the true baptism of the Holy
[2:20:39] Ghost where we can see the quickening
[2:20:41] power of the Lord Jesus Christ in our
[2:20:43] lives? that when we have a need for
[2:20:45] something, he is right there with us in
[2:20:47] our lives. But remember, brothers and
[2:20:49] sisters, we've got to make decisions.
[2:20:51] Every time we come to that place where
[2:20:54] the word says something and we believe
[2:20:56] something else, we've got a crossroad.
[2:20:59] Are we going to say yes?
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; I want to challenge us today. Are we
[2:21:02] going to say yes? Because if you've said
[2:21:04] no, or maybe, not now, maybe later, if
[2:21:08] you've been doing that, this is not the
[2:21:10] time to be doing that. This is the time
[2:21:11] to say yes, Lord. Yes. To your will and
[2:21:15] to your way.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Change my life.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; I want to challenge you today. If you
[2:21:21] have had those situations,
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; try me.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; Try me and see.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; By saying yes to his word gives you full
[2:21:32] complete obedience
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; which entitles you to the token.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't seen the
[2:21:38] manifestation of the token in your life,
[2:21:40] it's for a reason. And I challenge us
[2:21:43] today to go all the way and say yes
[2:21:47] because you will see the manifestation
[2:21:49] of the Lord in your life. And as you do,
[2:21:51] it just it becomes perpetual. Brothers
[2:21:53] and sisters, all you can do is worship.
[2:21:56] All you can do is thank him. It just
[2:21:57] becomes so wonderful. He's so wonderful,
[2:21:59] isn't he?
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; You got to make a decision. We all have
[2:22:04] to make a decision. And you know, how do
[2:22:06] you change? I'll say it again because I
[2:22:08] know we're over time now. I'll call the
[2:22:09] musicians. How do you change? You fully
[2:22:11] surrender.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; You fully surrender your will and your
[2:22:14] ways, your traditions, your teachings,
[2:22:17] your ideas, your behaviors. You totally
[2:22:20] surrender them unto the Lord.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; And I don't know why, but maybe that
[2:22:26] picture, maybe you could be so close to
[2:22:28] the truth, but have it skewed just a
[2:22:30] little bit, which is enough to make it
[2:22:32] not have any effect in your life. Maybe
[2:22:35] there's people here that worship William
[2:22:37] Miam Brham.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Stop it. Amen.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; Worship God.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; How do you change? You fully surrender.
[2:22:55] You'll only see a permanent change in
[2:22:57] your life by full obedience to the
[2:22:59] complete word of God.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; You cannot do it on your own. Brothers
[2:23:03] and sisters, many times I think maybe we
[2:23:08] see people live a life and and it looks
[2:23:10] like they do it on their own. Nobody
[2:23:13] does it on their own.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Nobody can do it on their own. Out of
[2:23:19] you must be born again. Brother Brandham
[2:23:21] in 1961 1231 he says so now remember
[2:23:27] it didn't say you ought to be born
[2:23:29] again.
[2:23:31] Now remember, we're in a one room
[2:23:33] schoolhouse.
[2:23:35] There's people here that don't have the
[2:23:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost, that have
[2:23:38] never been born again. And there's
[2:23:39] people here are good old veterans of the
[2:23:41] cross. They've been born again for years
[2:23:43] and years. And they should be the
[2:23:45] loudest ameners of the bunch because
[2:23:48] they know what it means for them and
[2:23:49] their lives.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; So now remember, it didn't say you ought
[2:23:52] to be born again, but you must.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; you must be born again.
[2:23:59] This ain't brother Barry just making
[2:24:00] this sound sharp. This is the word of
[2:24:04] God for our day. This is the vindicated
[2:24:06] prophets prophetic utterance from the
[2:24:09] throne of God to the people in this age
[2:24:11] who were fore orained who were elected
[2:24:14] before the foundation of the world to
[2:24:16] get this word. You must be born again.
[2:24:20] He says now we as English-speaking
[2:24:22] people understand what that word must
[2:24:25] means. That is absolutely. You've got to
[2:24:28] do it. See, it's a must.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Not ought to.
[2:24:34] You'd be better off if you did, but you
[2:24:36] must be born again. I'll say it this
[2:24:38] way. It It would actually be better that
[2:24:40] you didn't hear about it,
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; And not go after it than to hear about
[2:24:45] it and reject it.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; It would be better that you didn't hear
[2:24:49] about this Holy Ghost baptism. Uh he
[2:24:52] goes on to say, "You must be born
[2:24:53] again." And oh, if if we could just take
[2:24:55] that word this morning and break it down
[2:24:58] what it means, how that it's totally
[2:25:00] impossible. And then if it's that
[2:25:03] essential and that great that it's
[2:25:05] totally impossible to enter the kingdom
[2:25:07] of heaven or even see it
[2:25:11] until you're born again.
[2:25:13] And so many different interpretations of
[2:25:16] that word born again. We ought to seek
[2:25:19] it out
[2:25:21] with all of our heart to find out what
[2:25:24] it means.
[2:25:26] This is the vindicated prophet saying
[2:25:28] this. I want to say, brothers and
[2:25:30] sisters, if you haven't heard this
[2:25:31] message, you might want to listen to it.
[2:25:34] You must be born again. Changes
[2:25:37] everything in our lives. It changes our
[2:25:39] walk. It changes our talk. It changes
[2:25:41] our appearance. It changes our desire to
[2:25:44] worship. It changes everything of our
[2:25:47] lives. We no longer look at things the
[2:25:49] way that we used to. We do become new
[2:25:51] creatures even if we're raised in a
[2:25:53] message home. It has to be that way
[2:25:57] because of the way we're born.
[2:26:00] Let's just bow in prayer.
[2:26:03] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[2:26:05] you for your word, Lord. We thank you
[2:26:08] that we know that your word is your
[2:26:10] will.
[2:26:11] We thank you, Lord, for sending us a
[2:26:13] vindicated prophet. Lord, we don't
[2:26:15] worship him, Father. We worship you. And
[2:26:19] Lord, like we heard last weekend, we
[2:26:22] worship you in spirit and in truth
[2:26:24] because you [music] have enabled us to
[2:26:26] be born again. You have enabled us to be
[2:26:28] baptized with your Holy Spirit,
[2:26:30] literally your life.
[2:26:33] So Lord, we have spirit. And Father, in
[2:26:36] this age, you gave us an open book. You
[2:26:38] put it back into the hands of man again.
[2:26:41] So we have truth. And Father, when those
[2:26:43] two come together, we know that it's
[2:26:45] omnipotence, that it's truly your life.
[2:26:48] We thank you, Lord Jesus, that we can
[2:26:50] worship you in spirit and in truth. And
[2:26:52] we know, Father, that it's impossible to
[2:26:53] worship you any other way. And if we've
[2:26:56] ever tried to worship you any other way,
[2:26:58] we pray that you would forgive us, Lord.
[2:27:02] Father, if anybody has worshiped William
[2:27:04] Brandham, we pray that you would forgive
[2:27:06] them for it, Lord.
[2:27:09] Father, if anyone has a picture of him
[2:27:11] in their house and they look at it any
[2:27:12] other way than the way that you intended
[2:27:14] for it, we pray that you would forgive
[2:27:16] them for it.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; Let us look away to you, Father. Let us
[2:27:21] look to you because you are the author
[2:27:23] and you are the finisher of our
[2:27:25] salvation. And Father, through that
[2:27:27] message that you gave to us through your
[2:27:29] prophet, Lord, we have and are working
[2:27:32] out out our salvation with fear and with
[2:27:34] trembling, Lord, recognizing that you
[2:27:37] are a loving father, but you are a just
[2:27:39] God and you will judge this world only
[2:27:42] one way, and that's by your word. Help
[2:27:45] us, Lord, to line up with your word.
[2:27:49] Father, we love you and we thank you
[2:27:50] today.
[2:27:52] Father, if there's anybody here this
[2:27:54] morning that maybe just hasn't quite
[2:27:57] given their lives completely over to
[2:27:59] you, Father.
[2:28:01] Lord, I pray that today would be the
[2:28:04] day, Father, that they would be able to
[2:28:06] surrender their will completely unto you
[2:28:09] today, Father. That Lord, they would say
[2:28:11] yes. Oh father, when that time comes in
[2:28:14] their life where they recognize that
[2:28:16] they've lived their lives a certain way,
[2:28:18] but your word says something different.
[2:28:21] Help them, Father, to say yes. Help me
[2:28:23] too, Lord.
[2:28:27] Heavenly Father, I know I'm not
[2:28:29] exclusive
[2:28:31] and I thank you for this word, Lord,
[2:28:33] because it speaks to me just the same.
[2:28:37] Heavenly Father, we pray that you would
[2:28:38] be with those who couldn't be here
[2:28:40] today.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Wherever they are, Lord Jesus, be with
[2:28:43] the carpenters in the past. Lord, they
[2:28:45] would love to be here. Father, we love
[2:28:48] Brother Jerry and Sister Mary. Lord,
[2:28:51] brother Andy and Sister Shelley and
[2:28:53] Sister Beth. Lord, we love the
[2:28:55] representation of your word.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Over there in the past. And we pray that
[2:29:00] you would just keep your hand upon them,
[2:29:02] Lord.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; Be with the busies, Lord. be with all
[2:29:06] the people, Father, that would love to
[2:29:08] fellowship with the assembly but just
[2:29:10] can't because of time or space, Lord.
[2:29:13] Father, I think about my parents, Lord.
[2:29:15] I pray that you would bless them as
[2:29:17] well. Anyone, Father, that would tune
[2:29:19] in, Lord, and just follow you according
[2:29:23] to the word that they see. I pray that
[2:29:25] you would just bless them abundantly.
[2:29:26] Lord, help us all, Father, to draw close
[2:29:29] to you.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you would be with
[2:29:32] those who are traveling. Give them
[2:29:33] traveling mercies. bring them home
[2:29:35] safely, Father, at the appointed time.
[2:29:38] Lord,
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; now we just ask, Lord, that you would
[2:29:41] keep your hand upon us as we go our
[2:29:42] separate ways today, Father. Bless our
[2:29:45] visitors, Lord. Give them traveling
[2:29:47] mercies as they drive back home this
[2:29:49] afternoon. Lord, and we just ask that
[2:29:52] you would be glorified now in a couple
[2:29:53] songs before we go, Lord. Just ask all
[2:29:57] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:29:59] pray.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song? I'll say yes,
[2:30:04] [music] Lord. I'll say yes.
[2:30:08] I'll say yes, Lord.
[2:30:12] [singing and music]
[2:30:14] I'll say yes
[2:30:21] to your will, Lord.
[2:30:28] I'll [music] say yes.
[2:30:34] Where you lead [singing]
[2:30:37] me, [music]
[2:30:41] I will go.
[2:30:45] [music and singing]
[2:30:48] I'll say yes, Lord.
[2:30:54] I'll [music] say yes.
[2:31:01] I'll say [music and singing] yes, Lord.
[2:31:07] I'll say [music] yes [singing]
[2:31:13] to your will, Lord. [music]
[2:31:20] I'll say yes, [singing]
[2:31:26] where [music and singing] you lead me.
[2:31:32] Oh, I will [singing] go. [music]
[2:31:39] I'll say [singing]
[2:31:40] yes, Lord.
[2:31:43] [music]
[2:31:45] I'll say yes.
[2:31:50] Amen. Are you washed? 891.
[2:31:54] Are you washed?
[2:31:59] Do you know what it is?
[2:32:02] Do you know what it [singing] is not to
[2:32:06] have one [music] guilty feeling? Not to
[2:32:09] wonder where [singing] you're going when
[2:32:12] you die.
[2:32:14] Not condemned [singing and music]
[2:32:16] of the past. Not afraid of what tomorrow
[2:32:21] holds in store. [singing]
[2:32:23] And know the reason [music] why.
[2:32:27] Yes, that's just how it is when you go
[2:32:31] down in the water. Cuz my faith you
[2:32:35] believe in what [singing and music] you
[2:32:37] heard.
[2:32:39] It's no impossible
[2:32:41] dream. [music]
[2:32:42] You can [singing] start over.
[2:32:46] Hallelujah.
[2:32:49] By [music] the water of the world.
[2:32:56] [music]
[2:32:56] By the water.
[2:33:00] [music and singing]
[2:33:09] by the water. [music]
[2:33:12] Are you washed by the water of the word?
[2:33:16] [singing]
[2:33:18] It's like being born again with a
[2:33:22] [music and singing] whole new life to
[2:33:23] live, never having to look back to what
[2:33:28] you did. Thank you, Lord. Because
[2:33:31] [music] according to the Lord, you just
[2:33:34] started [singing] your existence. And
[2:33:37] where he's concerned, there never was no
[2:33:41] sin.
[2:33:43] When God,
[2:33:45] [singing]
[2:33:46] he no longer sees his [music] sight
[2:33:53] as snow
[2:33:56] [music]
[2:33:58] by the blood of God.
[2:34:03] Are you washed by the water of [music]
[2:34:06] the world?
[2:34:11] Amen. Yes, I am.
[2:34:14] [music]
[2:34:15] Yes, [singing] I'm washing by the water
[2:34:18] of the world. [music]
[2:34:22] I wash
[2:34:25] by the water. [music]
[2:34:29] By [singing] the water of the word.
[2:34:32] [music]
[2:34:34] Amen. 5:15. Lord, Lord, Lord,
