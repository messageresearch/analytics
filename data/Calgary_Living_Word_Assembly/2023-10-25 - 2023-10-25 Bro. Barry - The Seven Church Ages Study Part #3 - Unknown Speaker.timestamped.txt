[11:45] Jesus
[11:47] Lord your children have sacrificed to
[11:50] come Lord not on their own making but
[11:55] because you have put something in their
[11:56] hearts Lord why because the Deep
[11:59] responds to the Deep there is a calling

[12:05] heaven and thus now we give ourselves to

[12:14] will hinder your voices to speak to us
[12:17] Lord we know there are many voices

[12:23] silence every voice Lord be it the voice
[12:26] of tiredness or our thoughts wandering

[12:32] Lord Jesus Christ if we consecrate
[12:34] ourselves to you you are here to speak

[12:45] unto thee Heavenly Father like Peter of
[12:48] old who said to whom else shall we go
[12:51] when thou alone H has the words of Life
[12:54] father that statement is still true
[12:56] today it is you and you are alone who
[12:59] has the words of life and because we are
[13:01] thirsting for that word Heavenly Father
[13:04] you said blessed are they who hunger and
[13:06] thirst for righteousness for they shall
[13:08] be filled Master you are not a man that
[13:11] you can lie you said let every man's

[31:44] 1 just two verses

[32:10] before but tonight I just want to read
[32:12] verse 9 and verse 10 Revelations chap
[32:18] 1 we know that it's the revelation of
[32:21] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[32:24] show unto his servants the things which
[32:26] must show shortly come to pass that's
[32:28] Revelations 1:1 but I just wanted to say
[32:32] that just so we can read uh Revelations
[32:35] 1 ver9 I John who also am your brother
[32:39] and companion in
[32:41] Tribulation and in the kingdom and
[32:43] patience of Jesus Christ was in the
[32:46] aisle that is called patmas for the word
[32:48] of God and for the testimony of Jesus
[32:51] Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[32:54] day and heard behind me a great voice
[32:57] voice as of a trumpet let's just bow in
[33:00] prayer one more time Heavenly Father
[33:03] tonight we just invite that great voice
[33:06] that John heard as a trumpet Lord to
[33:09] witness to us once again your word
[33:12] father that you would just speak to us
[33:14] Lord through revelation we know that we
[33:17] can hear the words of man but Lord Jesus
[33:20] many times when the preaching is
[33:22] happening when we listen to a tape
[33:24] father we know that you minister to our
[33:26] hearts that are br brains father they go
[33:28] quickly and they fire many thoughts
[33:31] quickly and father we pray that you
[33:33] would just allow that to happen tonight
[33:34] that your Revelation would just happen
[33:37] in the hearts of your children father we
[33:39] want to commit this word into your hands
[33:41] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[33:45] amen I bless you tonight you may be
[33:50] seated certainly
[33:53] uh looking like winter time out there
[33:55] now
[33:58] just uh one announcement tonight that we
[34:00] have uh gym night coming up on
[34:02] Tuesday and uh I believe that we have
[34:05] two hours booked in the gym so it should
[34:07] be a a wonderful time for some ball
[34:11] throwing and Sport if you're interested
[34:13] to just come out and have a good time
[34:16] that's kind of what we're going to be
[34:17] doing so uh if you have any questions by
[34:19] all means just reach
[34:21] out tonight I would like to get into the
[34:23] exposition of the seven Church ages um
[34:27] chapter one The revelation of Jesus
[34:30] Christ and uh I just wanted to mention
[34:33] if anybody is interested we have more of
[34:35] these books now they're in stock um if
[34:39] you're interested we have them I'm going
[34:41] to be using it as we go along there's uh
[34:44] a few things in there that I want to
[34:46] point out that could be really helpful
[34:48] for us but uh out of the Revelation uh
[34:51] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[34:53] the revelation of Jesus Christ we'll
[34:56] just start with uh the importance of
[34:58] Revelation by the
[35:00] spirit to a True Believer can never be
[35:03] overemphasized
[35:06] amenah that's what I want to really talk
[35:08] about tonight I believe we could just
[35:09] take a whole series even on that one
[35:14] paragraph but I'm not going to do that
[35:17] to us I'm not going to try and drill
[35:19] down too far that way I would like to
[35:22] try and get some progress into the book
[35:25] it seems like I haven't been able to
[35:26] even start with it so um if you could
[35:30] just you have that
[35:32] up the importance of Revelation by the
[35:36] spirit to a True Believer can never be
[35:41] overemphasized you know we can have a
[35:44] lot of Revelation in our lives human
[35:47] beings get Revelation and a revelation
[35:50] is something that's revealed that's
[35:52] that's that's given we're able to maybe
[35:55] comprehend it and and some some might
[35:57] say that it's actually an idea or a
[35:59] thought and and truly it is an idea or a
[36:03] thought call it a revelation when
[36:06] something is revealed to us and you know
[36:09] there's been many many revelations in
[36:11] the world and we can talk about
[36:13] Revelations like some of the great
[36:16] inventors invented what's called
[36:18] electricity but they didn't actually
[36:20] invented it was already there but it was
[36:23] just revealed it was revealed to them
[36:26] that they could actually uh harness the
[36:29] energy of electricity and use it even
[36:31] though you can't see it but somewhere
[36:33] along the way someone had a thought
[36:35] someone had an idea something came to
[36:38] their Consciousness and they were able
[36:40] to take it and then apply it and see
[36:42] that it worked and then they were able
[36:44] to test it and then prove it to prove
[36:47] that it worked but tonight we're not
[36:49] talking about the natural uh call it
[36:51] anointings of Revelation that this world
[36:54] has we know that another example would
[36:56] clearly be the the revelation of the
[36:59] magnetic recording device and we've
[37:01] talked about this in the past too that
[37:03] how many people would say I even
[37:05] believed it this way that uh you know it
[37:07] was created so that you could have
[37:09] movies and and music and all of the
[37:11] worldly entertainments that we have but
[37:13] but we know full well uh as Believers
[37:16] that this anointing this this
[37:19] information this this knowledge was
[37:22] released to the world released to
[37:23] mankind at a specific time for a
[37:26] specific specific purpose and that was
[37:28] so that it could record thus saith the
[37:30] Lord of the Prophet for our day and we
[37:34] know that Satan has taken it and
[37:35] perverted it in such a great way that it
[37:38] would just totally completely outshine
[37:41] what thus saith the Lord looks like to a
[37:43] Believer and even to most Christians in
[37:46] in the denominational World many many
[37:49] Christians in this world you start to
[37:50] talk about thus sayith the Lord maybe
[37:52] sounds a little bit crazy I don't think
[37:54] you hear that very often preached in in
[37:56] a denominational setting thus sayeth the
[37:59] Lord I wonder how many Catholic churches
[38:01] you would hear thus saith the Lord
[38:03] mentioned I I honestly I don't know but
[38:06] I can only assume that it's not a very
[38:08] big topic but there's a reason why that
[38:11] knowledge was released why that that
[38:13] information came into the mind or Into
[38:15] the Heart of a human being so that they
[38:17] could
[38:18] create what was revealed to them what
[38:21] was unveiled that technology was already
[38:24] in Earth we know that the tele Vision
[38:27] was there in the time of the children of
[38:29] Israel being in
[38:31] Egypt they just didn't understand it
[38:34] they didn't have the knowledge it wasn't
[38:35] yet revealed to them but we know there's
[38:39] many different things um that have been
[38:42] revealed I find it fascinating just a a
[38:45] fun fact I know we've probably already
[38:47] seen it everyone has but if you look at
[38:50] some of the early Egyptian hieroglyphics
[38:53] some of them actually show clearly a
[38:55] helicopter
[38:57] a very streamlined helicopter back from
[38:59] the days of the Egyptians now we would
[39:02] say that that knowledge is new but is it
[39:05] did did they have that knowledge before
[39:07] we know that that brother bradam said
[39:09] that they were way more technologically
[39:11] advanced before the anti-d deluvian
[39:14] destruction than where they are today
[39:17] because how did they put those blocks
[39:19] together in the pyramid even today they
[39:21] can't say how they could do that even
[39:24] today they say they can't actually
[39:27] replicate what went into the pyramid the
[39:29] perfect math all of the placement of
[39:32] those heavy blocks how on on Earth could
[39:34] it happened but we know it was a
[39:37] revelation somewhere along the way
[39:40] someone somehow was given an inspiration
[39:43] a knowledge was revealed to them about
[39:46] something that they could actually make
[39:48] happen all of that to say we want to
[39:51] talk about the Revelation by the spirit
[39:55] now not just any spirit because there's
[39:56] many spirits but the revelation of the
[39:59] Holy Spirit and not just to the masses I
[40:02] think it's so important how brother
[40:03] brandham says this the importance of
[40:05] Revelation by the spirit to
[40:09] who only to a True Believer only the
[40:13] True Believer is going to have the
[40:14] ability to catch this
[40:16] Revelation and brother Bram talks about
[40:18] it but I'm just going to jump ahead a
[40:19] little bit because you can take a look
[40:21] in early on in the Bible the Book of
[40:23] Genesis Abel he had a revelation he had
[40:28] a thought somehow somewhere along the
[40:31] way he had the ability to know that God
[40:33] wasn't looking for the best of the land
[40:36] he wasn't looking for the fruit he
[40:38] wasn't looking for the best flowery
[40:40] display he wasn't looking for the
[40:41] worship choir he wasn't looking for the
[40:44] best performance he wasn't looking for
[40:46] the best attire he wasn't looking for
[40:48] all the best everything of of that
[40:50] anyone could offer them what he wanted
[40:53] was a bloody sacrifice am he wanted able
[40:56] to take a stone or a knife and chop the
[40:59] neck of a bleeding
[41:01] lamb and we know that Cain said oh he's
[41:03] a fanatic oh that guy look at him he's
[41:07] always been a fanatic he's always talked
[41:09] about these visions and dreams maybe
[41:12] Revelations that God has given him but
[41:15] we know both were raised by the same
[41:17] parents why didn't Cain have the same
[41:19] idea right it was a
[41:22] revelation by the spirit to a True
[41:25] Believer
[41:27] now some might say well brother Barry
[41:28] the Holy Spirit wasn't given then but
[41:30] you know they had pretty close access to
[41:32] God that's right that's right Adam his
[41:34] dad was the son of God Amen so I would
[41:39] say he had pretty close contact to the
[41:41] spirit but maybe it could be disputed I
[41:44] I don't know I think we could get get
[41:46] that that could take us into that whole
[41:48] discussion brother Brown talks about a
[41:49] little bit later in the church AG book
[41:51] how they were torn the whole world was
[41:53] torn up over what is it the the sound of
[41:55] two different syllables in the same word
[41:57] called a dip thong we could get hung up
[42:00] on on on semantics on a simple little
[42:02] thing but how about we just look at this
[42:04] and think about how this Spirit to a
[42:07] True Believer we can never overemphasize
[42:09] the importance of it and that's why we
[42:12] come to church amen I know I said it in
[42:14] the prayer but many times we could be
[42:16] preaching talking about a specific thing
[42:18] and people's brains will be firing about
[42:20] something else they'll be out on a
[42:22] different planet somewhere but not
[42:24] necessarily thinking about sinful things
[42:27] not necessarily thinking about different
[42:28] things they'll be thinking about the
[42:30] word of God in a different way and I can
[42:32] say by experience from preaching I would
[42:35] listen to a minister preaching I would
[42:37] listen to brother Ken just preaching his
[42:39] heart out and I would be putting
[42:40] together a sermon in my heart I'd be
[42:42] thinking man this is great Yeah the more
[42:44] that he preaches the more I say Amen the
[42:46] more I'm getting Revelation about the
[42:48] word I'm thinking about different
[42:49] scriptures God's speaking to me
[42:52] individually it's revelation of the
[42:55] spirit amen Revelation by the spirit to
[42:59] a True Believer can never be
[43:00] overemphasized and that's why I think we
[43:02] could just go on and on and on I could
[43:04] never overemphasize this right we could
[43:06] never say Amen too much about Revelation
[43:10] by the
[43:11] spirit he goes on to say Revelation
[43:13] means more to you than perhaps you
[43:16] realize now I'm not talking about this
[43:19] book of Revelation and
[43:21] you I'm talking about all
[43:24] Revelation it's tremendous important to
[43:27] the
[43:28] church you know I think this is
[43:30] beautiful because it is the most
[43:33] important thing to the church because it
[43:36] is the new birth brother bradam says it
[43:37] very clearly in the message of the hour
[43:39] the new birth is what it's God revealing
[43:44] himself making himself known personally
[43:47] to the individual amen how does that
[43:49] happen that's
[43:51] Revelation but when that happens that's
[43:53] when people go out on the street corners
[43:55] and start start banging on a box and
[43:57] saying I don't care who's looking at me
[43:59] I don't care who's listening I want to
[44:01] get the word of God out to this world
[44:03] because he has spoken to my heart
[44:06] individually and once that happens it'll
[44:08] never a person can never go back from
[44:10] that amen never if God has ever spoken
[44:13] to an
[44:14] individual now I'm not talking about
[44:16] this book of Revelation and
[44:18] you you just clarifies that so good I'm
[44:21] talking about all Revelation it's
[44:23] tremendously important to the church so
[44:25] that's all Revelation brothers and
[44:27] sisters when we read a scripture and and
[44:29] we begin to recognize wait a second
[44:32] that's that sounds like another
[44:33] scripture in my heart and you you think
[44:36] about it and you maybe you have to go on
[44:37] your search and maybe you can just look
[44:39] it up in your Bible because you know it
[44:41] that well whatever it is you know that
[44:42] God speaks to you and that is the white
[44:45] between the words brother bradam said it
[44:48] you have to be able to read between the
[44:50] lines every scripture has a compound
[44:52] what
[44:53] Revelation and compound
[44:57] meaning yes I've heard it said that
[45:00] there's more white on each page than
[45:01] there is black or red there's more room
[45:05] to read between the lines than there is
[45:07] actually lines of words amen but that's
[45:10] the word of God he'll reveal himself
[45:13] however he will Amen brother bam goes on
[45:16] to say do you remember in Matthew 16
[45:18] where Jesus asked the disciples this
[45:20] question whom do men say that I the son
[45:23] of man am and they said some say thou
[45:28] art
[45:30] John
[45:31] sorry I'm getting ahead of myself here
[45:34] this is where I wanted to get to this
[45:37] tab and put a plug in for this
[45:40] book because in the in the original text
[45:43] and I'm sure this is the same um Matthew
[45:46] 16 do you remember in Matthew 16 where
[45:48] Jesus asked the disciples a question who
[45:50] do men say that I the son of man am and
[45:52] they said some art say that thou art
[45:55] John the Baptist what this book does
[45:58] here is it actually brings up the
[46:00] Scripture it separates the scripture
[46:03] it'll say it says Matthew 16 where Jesus
[46:05] asked the disciples a question whom do
[46:07] men say that I the son of man have man
[46:10] am and they said some say thou art John
[46:13] the Baptist some Elijah others Jeremiah
[46:16] or of the prophets he saith unto them
[46:19] but who say ye that I am and Simon Peter
[46:23] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[46:25] the son of the Living God God and Jesus
[46:26] answered and said unto him blessed art
[46:28] thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood
[46:31] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[46:33] Father which is in heaven yes and I say
[46:36] unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon
[46:39] This Rock will I build my church and the
[46:41] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[46:43] it and at the bottom of that it says
[46:46] Matthew
[46:47] 16: 13 to18 so it separates the actual
[46:51] scripture out of the page of text
[46:54] whereas this is all just text that goes
[46:56] on the original Church age book the blue
[46:59] ones that's how it was printed but this
[47:01] one here actually separates it out it's
[47:03] it's pretty convenient if anybody's
[47:04] interested we have
[47:06] themen it's so important for us to
[47:09] recognize how he was doing it what what
[47:12] he was doing it's just
[47:15] beautiful
[47:17] because
[47:18] Revelation is what it takes for a
[47:23] Believer brother Bram goes on to say
[47:27] I'll just pick up here in mind um he
[47:29] says the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[47:31] against it the Roman Catholics say the
[47:34] church is built upon Peter now that's
[47:37] really carnal how could God build the
[47:40] church Upon A man so unstable that he
[47:43] denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while
[47:45] doing it
[47:49] yeah God can't build his church upon any
[47:52] man born in
[47:53] sin and it wasn't some rock lying there
[47:56] as though God had hallowed the ground at
[47:59] that
[48:00] spot and it isn't as the Protestants say
[48:05] that the church is built upon
[48:07] Jesus it was the
[48:10] Revelation amen amen I love the way he
[48:12] says it read it the way it's written
[48:16] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but
[48:21] my father hath revealed it and Upon This
[48:24] Rock revelation
[48:26] will I build my church the church is
[48:29] built on Revelation on thus saith the
[48:34] Lord the church is not built upon a man
[48:38] the church isn't built upon a
[48:40] theology but it's interesting I have a
[48:43] lot of quotes tonight that I'm going to
[48:45] bring from the revelation of Jesus
[48:47] Christ in
[48:48] 1960 and a lot of the inspiration for
[48:51] this book starts there if you're
[48:53] interested by all means uh take a look
[48:56] at some of the quotes in there but some
[48:58] of it's just profound when you when you
[49:00] take a look at what he was saying back
[49:03] then in
[49:05] 1960 um paragraph
[49:08] 143 it's
[49:10] 1960 D
[49:12] 1204m the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:15] paragraph
[49:18] 143 brother B I'm I'm jumping way ahead
[49:22] in here but I just wanted to bring this
[49:23] point out because I think it's so
[49:25] pertinent even
[49:26] today you know this is all about
[49:28] Revelation what we believe in the
[49:30] message of the hour is all about
[49:32] Revelation and this is where people say
[49:34] that William Bram went off I I I had
[49:38] said it's paragraph 143 if that's what
[49:40] you were wondering sorry brother
[49:42] paragraph 143 of the revelation of Jesus
[49:47] Christ we know brother Bram talks about
[49:50] it very clearly in the church age book
[49:51] he talks about it in this message he
[49:53] talks about in other places as well
[49:54] Satan hates two books books of the Bible
[49:56] more than any he hates the Book of
[49:57] Genesis because it shows his origin it
[49:59] shows that he was an upright being in
[50:02] the garden he came and entered that
[50:04] upright being he wasn't that upright
[50:05] being I should back up but the serpent
[50:08] was that upright being and we know that
[50:11] upright being was cursed to crawl on its
[50:13] belly and eat dust all the days of its
[50:15] life and that's why humans can never
[50:18] find that Gene connection between
[50:21] chimpanzees and man there's no animal
[50:23] connection that was it that was the one
[50:26] connection but God cursed it so far that
[50:28] there's no way a human being is ever
[50:30] going to get it but Satan hates the Book
[50:32] of Genesis and he hates the Book of
[50:34] Revelation because Genesis shows his
[50:36] beginning he shows his evil ways how he
[50:39] got into the race of mankind and the re
[50:42] Book of Revelation shows his destruction
[50:44] he hates those two books Because he
[50:45] believes them he knows the word of God
[50:48] but paragraph 143 the revelation of
[50:50] Jesus Christ so then you see why Satan
[50:53] is so against the Book of Revelation
[50:55] talking about
[50:57] Revelation talking about all Revelation
[51:01] along with the Book of Revelation so
[51:03] then you see why Satan is so against the
[51:04] Book of Revelation anything that's
[51:07] revealed spiritual
[51:09] Revelation Satan is against it right he
[51:13] doesn't want people hearing from God
[51:15] directly he wants people to hear from a
[51:18] man because he knows a man is fallible
[51:20] he knows that if he can get people to
[51:22] hear from a man then he's going to go
[51:23] and infect that man he'll put a virus in
[51:26] that man and cause that man to take
[51:27] people away yes but if people are taught
[51:30] the right way don't listen to a man
[51:33] don't let any man be your influence
[51:35] listen to
[51:37] God then you'll have success but Satan
[51:40] knows that better than any Theologian
[51:42] does and that's why Satan wants people
[51:44] to believe you have to believe in
[51:46] theology you have to believe that
[51:48] theology is the way that's why when you
[51:51] start to talk about Revelation to people
[51:52] who are theologians then they start to
[51:55] get a little uncomfortable maybe even
[51:57] break a little bit of sweat because
[51:58] you're talking about things that maybe
[52:00] they don't know about they're taught to
[52:01] hold to the theology to hold to the
[52:03] theological way to say that I was taught
[52:06] in school I've got a degree that shows
[52:08] me this but did God show you that
[52:12] because if God didn't show you that and
[52:13] it just came from a school what are you
[52:15] holding on
[52:20] toen so then you see why Satan is so
[52:23] against the Book of Revelation anything
[52:25] gets revealed spiritual Revelation Satan
[52:28] is against it he doesn't want us to
[52:30] believe that we're saved right he
[52:31] doesn't want us to believe that we're
[52:33] healed but both of those are why he died
[52:37] that's right both of
[52:39] them he says that's why he's so against
[52:44] the ministry today because what is it
[52:48] the revealing of Christ now he was
[52:51] talking in 1960 back there and some
[52:53] might want to get hung up on the dip
[52:54] thong Theory it was 1960 and brother
[52:57] Bram was talking about it this was a
[52:59] prophet he was prophetically uttering
[53:01] and I believe that this applies to today
[53:04] there's a reason why people just want to
[53:07] press play there's a reason for it the
[53:09] only reason for that brothers and
[53:11] sisters is because the devil's behind it
[53:14] now that's hard and people I know are
[53:16] quiet saying brother Barry how could you
[53:18] say that but if that's the only way
[53:21] you're going to actually worship God
[53:23] it's
[53:24] incorrect but to press play and be a
[53:27] part of a fellowship and go to church
[53:29] and worship and be amongst Believers
[53:31] there's something about that brothers
[53:32] and sisters the five-fold ministry is
[53:34] for the perfecting of the Saints any
[53:37] other way is against the Revelation that
[53:39] we've been given for our day
[53:42] amen I think it's beautiful that brother
[53:44] Brandon would say it because what is it
[53:47] it's the revealing of Christ that's why
[53:49] he's so against the ministry today amen
[53:53] he's not after the Anglican and the
[53:55] Catholics and the Baptists and the
[53:58] Pentecostals all of the denominational
[54:01] churches but what he is after is after
[54:03] the denomination of the message the
[54:06] people that want to denominate and say
[54:08] we've got to hurry up and try and
[54:09] protect this now we've seen a great move
[54:11] of God in our midst let's make sure that
[54:13] we keep it in our midst brothers and
[54:16] sisters we don't want to try and do it
[54:17] let God do
[54:18] it give it to
[54:21] God any true Minister will promote Jesus
[54:25] Christ and any true Minister will
[54:27] promote the revelation of Jesus Christ
[54:30] to the
[54:31] individual but only by the word of God
[54:34] Amen not by
[54:37] theology I just thought this was so
[54:39] profound listening to this today so then
[54:41] you see why Satan is so against the Book
[54:43] of Revelation anything that's revealed
[54:45] spiritual Revelation Satan's against it
[54:47] that's why he's so against the ministry
[54:49] today because what is it it's the
[54:51] revealing of
[54:54] Christ I think it's just
[54:57] incredible as we gather together in his
[55:00] name as we Fellowship around the message
[55:01] of the hour as we talk about the
[55:04] exposition of the seven Church ages what
[55:06] is it brothers and sisters it's the
[55:08] revealing of Christ it's the revealing
[55:10] of Christ it's the revealing of Christ
[55:13] and I believe Satan hates it with all of
[55:15] his heart he has the guns of Hell
[55:17] trained upon us but we love it
[55:22] Revelation is fresh Revelation is pure
[55:25] amen Revelation from God will never ever
[55:29] compromise it will never come contrary
[55:31] to the word of God and that's what I
[55:32] wanted to say early on but I got
[55:34] sidetracked how will you know if your
[55:36] Revelation that's coming into your heart
[55:38] the thoughts and the ideas are correct
[55:40] you take it back to the word of God
[55:41] brother Bram says give it the word test
[55:44] if you can give it to the word and give
[55:46] it the word test and it lines up with
[55:48] the word of God then just praise the
[55:50] Lord brothers and sisters you got every
[55:51] reason to scream and shout to jump up
[55:53] and down maybe to do summer Sals to
[55:55] thank the Lord because not everyone in
[55:57] this world gets that if we have been
[56:00] given Revelation we've got every single
[56:02] reason to praise the
[56:05] Lord in uh in the revelation of Jesus
[56:08] Christ right at the very beginning it's
[56:09] paragraph 4 brother Bram says but the
[56:12] reason for this special time he's
[56:15] talking about the introducing of this
[56:17] topic now just going back I know I
[56:20] jumped way ahead there with that last
[56:21] quote but he says the reason for this
[56:25] special time was that we would upon my
[56:28] heart the Holy Spirit had laid this
[56:30] warning of conviction that the church in
[56:34] this day should have this message
[56:36] because I believe that it's the most
[56:37] outstanding messages of the Bible
[56:40] because it reveals Christ in his church
[56:43] at this time amen we have the prophet
[56:47] saying this is what God's laid on my
[56:49] heart and this is why I want to bring it
[56:51] to the
[56:52] church he goes on to say then no one no
[56:55] one can have faith or know what they're
[56:57] doing or where they're going unless they
[57:00] have something to base their thoughts
[57:03] and faith
[57:04] upon aren't you thankful that God sent a
[57:07] prophet amen therefore if the scripture
[57:10] has revealed Christ to us in these last
[57:13] days and the condition of time it would
[57:16] do us good to search it and find out
[57:19] where we're at yes am and so we know
[57:22] that he's talking about the seven Church
[57:24] ages and this is the the first three
[57:26] chapters of the Book of Revelation and
[57:28] brother bradam he breaks it up we'll
[57:30] read the quote I think it's so good
[57:31] though he says it so clearly in the
[57:33] revelation of Jesus Christ I'm not sure
[57:36] if he says it that way in the in the
[57:37] exposition of seven Church ages but he
[57:39] says that Revelation is broken up into
[57:41] three parts the first part is the
[57:43] introduction of the church the second
[57:46] part is the is uh I'm going to read it
[57:49] I'm going to confuse myself here he just
[57:51] breaks it up into three parts it's it's
[57:53] really really good the way he says it
[57:55] in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[57:57] paragraph 11 it never dawned upon my
[57:59] heart so much until the last election
[58:01] and then I seen where where we're at the
[58:06] Holy Spirit began to reveal to me to
[58:08] warn the people and to place this and I
[58:11] cannot do it in a church like this
[58:13] sufficiently and then if I sat down and
[58:16] just wrote the book I feel that if I got
[58:19] to the pulpit and the inspiration of the
[58:21] Holy Spirit amongst the Christians Came
[58:22] Upon me to help me then I would be more
[58:25] sufficient to write the book then after
[58:28] I took it off the tape because there
[58:31] we'd get the inspiration of it and I I
[58:34] just want to encourage us brothers and
[58:35] sisters if you haven't listened to this
[58:37] you can hear the inspiration of this
[58:39] book by listening to this message by
[58:41] listening to the subsequent messages as
[58:44] well because we get the inspiration of
[58:46] it the books of course will be kind of
[58:48] straightened up a little gramar tized I
[58:51] say because in here we put things in
[58:54] that we could not put in the book and
[58:56] then we take too much time on repeating
[58:59] ourselves or I do and then in the book
[59:03] it'll all be straightened out but we're
[59:05] going to try to get it as much as we can
[59:08] on tapes this was 5 years before the
[59:11] book was released 1960 brother Bram
[59:14] talking about
[59:15] this it's just wonderful I'll just
[59:19] continue reading in paragraph 25 here
[59:22] the revelation of Jesus Christ he says
[59:25] this morning I am starting the first
[59:27] chapter of revelation of the Book of
[59:29] Revelation and Revelation is set in
[59:31] three parts and the first three chapters
[59:33] is what we'll be dealing with in these
[59:35] eight days when one Church age could
[59:38] take us a month but we'll just have to
[59:40] hit the high places as we call it and
[59:43] when you get the book it'll be written
[59:45] out more in
[59:48] detail I think it's just beautiful that
[59:50] he keeps referring to the book and and
[59:52] for anyone that's wondering this is the
[59:54] book the exposition of the seven Church
[59:56] ages I know we all know that but there
[59:58] could be people that maybe listen tune
[1:00:00] in or what have
[1:00:01] you paragraph 26 here he says now
[1:00:04] Revelation the first three chapters
[1:00:06] speaking of the Book of Revelation the
[1:00:08] last book in the Bible deals with the
[1:00:11] church then the church disappears we see
[1:00:14] it no more until the end time from
[1:00:18] Revelations 1:3 is the church
[1:00:20] Revelations 4-9 is Israel and a nation
[1:00:25] and 19 to 22 is both together and the
[1:00:29] plagues and the warnings and so forth at
[1:00:32] the end said in three parts see and
[1:00:34] we're taking the first three chapters
[1:00:36] pertaining to the church and the church
[1:00:39] age that we're living in now first it
[1:00:42] may seem kind of dry I love that he says
[1:00:46] this because it can seem that way I'm
[1:00:48] sorry on a Wednesday night it can be
[1:00:50] that way but now first it may seem kind
[1:00:53] of dry because we have to go back and
[1:00:55] make a foundation I prayed and studied
[1:00:57] and done everything that I could to try
[1:00:59] to get the feeling of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:01] which way to set this that the people
[1:01:04] will see it and that you might in seeing
[1:01:07] it be
[1:01:08] enlightened and cause you to come closer
[1:01:11] to Christ for we're at the end time
[1:01:15] amen I just thought that was so good
[1:01:18] because right there brothers and sisters
[1:01:19] that just goes directly ties directly in
[1:01:22] with Ephesians chapter 1
[1:01:24] Verse 18 do you want to just turn there
[1:01:27] with me tonight
[1:01:29] Ephesians 1 verse
[1:01:35] 18 I'm just going to read out of uh the
[1:01:38] Strong's Concordance while you're
[1:01:39] turning there it's
[1:01:42] g54 61
[1:01:46] enlightened
[1:01:49] fiso for
[1:01:53] tids and it's from G 5457 it says to
[1:01:57] shed rays that is to shine or
[1:02:02] transitively to brighten up literally or
[1:02:06] figuratively
[1:02:07] Enlighten ex illuminate bring to give
[1:02:13] light to make
[1:02:16] see Ephesians 1 verse 18 the eyes of
[1:02:22] your understanding
[1:02:24] being enlightened amen that ye may know
[1:02:28] what is the hope of his calling and the
[1:02:31] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:02:34] to the Saints speaking to you and I
[1:02:37] tonight the Saints those people at the
[1:02:40] end of
[1:02:42] time so here we have brother brandham
[1:02:44] saying
[1:02:46] um I'll just go back and read this that
[1:02:49] I could try to get the feeling of the
[1:02:50] Holy Spirit which way to set this that
[1:02:52] the people would see it and that you
[1:02:55] might in seeing it be enlightened and
[1:02:57] cause you to come closer to Christ for
[1:02:59] at the end we at the end time that we
[1:03:02] would be able to see what the riches of
[1:03:04] the glory of his inheritance to the
[1:03:06] Saints is and what is that brothers and
[1:03:08] sisters tonight we're talking about
[1:03:10] eternal life that's the bottom line here
[1:03:12] knowing that we know exactly where we
[1:03:14] stand if we were to step out of here and
[1:03:17] hit a patch of ice and go around a light
[1:03:19] pole and and Naturally Speaking expire
[1:03:22] in this life that we would actually know
[1:03:25] that we're not afraid we have no fear
[1:03:28] because we know that we've made it right
[1:03:30] with him we know what the riches of our
[1:03:32] inheritance are we know exactly all
[1:03:35] about this message of the
[1:03:39] hour out of paragraph 69 in in the
[1:03:42] revelation of Jesus
[1:03:46] Christ historians agree this is John's
[1:03:50] Life John lived the last of his years in
[1:03:53] the city of EP epis and died there isn't
[1:03:56] it interesting that before they put him
[1:03:58] on the aisle of patmas what did they do
[1:04:01] we we'll go Ahad into all of this later
[1:04:03] I just can't help but Jump Ahead
[1:04:05] sometimes what what did they do to him
[1:04:07] they were so upset with him they tried
[1:04:09] to boil him alive for 24 hours in
[1:04:12] oil and they couldn't kill him because
[1:04:15] he had a work to
[1:04:17] do I remember brother Ken saying
[1:04:20] something along the lines he was quoting
[1:04:21] a quote a man that's that's destined to
[1:04:26] hang he can't drown or or vice versa I
[1:04:29] can't remember exactly how he said that
[1:04:31] but it's so true if if we're destined
[1:04:34] for a certain thing nothing can harm us
[1:04:37] until we're actually completed what
[1:04:38] we're supposed to complete in this life
[1:04:41] am if we could just live our lives that
[1:04:43] way knowing that I I'm here serving the
[1:04:46] purpose the Eternal purpose of the king
[1:04:48] of kings and Lord of lords and nothing
[1:04:50] can harm me until I've served that
[1:04:52] purpose and once I've served serve that
[1:04:54] purpose then he will change my location
[1:04:57] he'll change my my body I'll have a body
[1:05:00] already
[1:05:01] waiting he says historians agree this is
[1:05:04] the life of John paragraph 69 John lived
[1:05:07] the last of his years in the city of
[1:05:09] Ephesus and died there he was on the
[1:05:12] aisle of patmas at the time he wrote the
[1:05:14] Book of Revelation it was not the story
[1:05:17] of his life but the story of Christ in
[1:05:19] future ages see it was a
[1:05:22] prophecy not the life of John not the
[1:05:26] life of Christ but prophesying of an age
[1:05:29] to come it was not his prophetic
[1:05:34] utterances right but the Lord's
[1:05:37] exaltations solemnly yes it was not the
[1:05:41] revelation of St John the Divine but the
[1:05:44] revelation of Christ the
[1:05:48] Lorden that's what this this is the
[1:05:51] revelation of Christ the lord
[1:05:54] Lord we're not looking at this from the
[1:05:58] position of not understanding we do
[1:06:01] understand the eyes of our understanding
[1:06:04] have been enlightened with this it's not
[1:06:07] something that we're poking and prodding
[1:06:09] at the in the dark
[1:06:11] at brother Bram he says in in the
[1:06:15] Revelation uh in the exposition of the
[1:06:17] seven Church ages sorry I'm jumping back
[1:06:19] and forth brother Logan you're doing
[1:06:21] really good with it bear with me it's
[1:06:23] paragraph
[1:06:24] six I believe the Roman Catholics say
[1:06:28] that the church is built upon Peter now
[1:06:30] that is really carnal how could God
[1:06:32] build the church Upon A man so unstable
[1:06:34] that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed
[1:06:38] while doing it he can't build his church
[1:06:40] upon any man born in sin and it wasn't a
[1:06:42] rock wasn't some rock lying there as
[1:06:44] though God had hallowed the ground at
[1:06:46] that spot and it isn't as the
[1:06:48] Protestants say that the church is built
[1:06:50] upon Jesus it was the Revelation the
[1:06:54] understanding read it the way it's
[1:06:56] written Flesh and Blood hath not
[1:06:57] revealed it but my father hath revealed
[1:06:59] it and Upon This Rock revelation will I
[1:07:01] build my church the church is built upon
[1:07:04] Revelation on thus sayith the
[1:07:07] Lord in this message 1960 I didn't bring
[1:07:11] it tonight brother Bram talks about how
[1:07:15] theology is what gets in the way of
[1:07:18] Revelation the theologians don't like
[1:07:21] Revelation I touched on a little bit
[1:07:23] earlier but we'll just let it go now the
[1:07:25] the theological understanding does not
[1:07:28] like Revelation they want everyone to
[1:07:30] conform to a certain way Satan hates
[1:07:33] Revelation because that is the new birth
[1:07:35] we've said it already I'll say it again
[1:07:37] though when we get the Revelation that
[1:07:39] Christ Jesus is Lord we're able to push
[1:07:44] aside everything else in our life and
[1:07:45] allow him to have full control over our
[1:07:48] lives then nothing can stop
[1:07:50] us and Satan knows that better than most
[1:07:53] theologians
[1:07:56] how did Abel know what to do in order to
[1:07:58] offer a proper sacrifice to God by faith
[1:08:02] he received the revelation of
[1:08:05] blood Cain didn't get such a revelation
[1:08:09] even though he had a
[1:08:12] commandment so he couldn't offer the
[1:08:15] right sacrifice isn't it amazing to
[1:08:17] think he had the right commandment but
[1:08:20] he still couldn't do
[1:08:22] it Abel had the Revelation and went
[1:08:24] ahead and did it and Cain had his own
[1:08:28] Revelation from his father and went
[1:08:30] ahead and did it but God didn't just
[1:08:33] leave him there God came back around and
[1:08:35] said hey you know what if you would just
[1:08:37] do like your brother you would be
[1:08:39] accepted
[1:08:40] too but if you choose not to do like
[1:08:43] your brother then sin lith at your
[1:08:46] door and death will surely follow but
[1:08:50] what did he do he got mad and we talked
[1:08:54] about this because he had different
[1:08:55] attributes didn't he he was manifesting
[1:08:58] the attributes of his
[1:09:00] father but Abel was manifesting the
[1:09:03] attributes of his father amen same
[1:09:07] mother two fathers right
[1:09:11] right we could get into that we will
[1:09:13] eventually I'm
[1:09:15] sure it was a revelation from God that
[1:09:18] made the difference and gave Abel
[1:09:21] eternal
[1:09:22] life now you might take what the pastor
[1:09:24] says or what the Seminary teaches and
[1:09:27] though it might be taught to you with
[1:09:31] eloquence but until God reveals to you
[1:09:35] that Jesus is the
[1:09:37] Christ and that it is the blood that
[1:09:40] cleanses
[1:09:41] you and that God is your
[1:09:44] savior you will never have eternal life
[1:09:47] it's a spiritual Revelation that does
[1:09:49] that
[1:09:51] amen now I said this book Book of
[1:09:54] Revelation and the revelation of Jesus
[1:09:56] and what he's doing in the
[1:09:59] churches for those Seven Ages it is a
[1:10:02] revelation because the disciples
[1:10:04] themselves didn't know these recorded
[1:10:07] truths it had not been previously
[1:10:10] revealed to them you remember that they
[1:10:12] came to Jesus in the book of Acts and
[1:10:13] asked him are you at this time going to
[1:10:15] restore the kingdom to Israel and he
[1:10:17] said it's not for you to know the times
[1:10:18] of the seasons those men were still
[1:10:20] thinking of Jesus having an Earthly
[1:10:22] Kingdom but it was a spiritual Kingdom
[1:10:25] that he was going to build even he could
[1:10:28] not tell them about his place in it for
[1:10:31] the father had not revealed it unto
[1:10:35] him it's a very difficult thing to
[1:10:38] understand that the father could not
[1:10:40] have revealed it unto him even though he
[1:10:41] was the
[1:10:43] father manifest in flesh and we know
[1:10:46] that that's what the scripture says amen
[1:10:49] but we're not going to get into that
[1:10:50] tonight either we're just going to carry
[1:10:52] on here par arph 10 but now after his
[1:10:55] death and resurrection and at this
[1:10:57] particular time in his mediatorial
[1:11:00] ministry he is able to set forth here in
[1:11:03] this revelation of himself to John what
[1:11:05] his glory and presence in the church
[1:11:08] would mean and do in this Revelation he
[1:11:12] tells us what the end of the devil
[1:11:14] is he tells us how he's going to deal
[1:11:17] with the devil and cast him into the
[1:11:22] lake of
[1:11:24] fire I just believe he doesn't want me
[1:11:26] to say those words I think he doesn't
[1:11:28] like us all hearing those words I think
[1:11:31] he knows this word better than all most
[1:11:33] theologians do but he is going to cast
[1:11:36] him into the Lake of Fire he reveals the
[1:11:38] end of the wicked ones who follow Satan
[1:11:41] and Satan hates
[1:11:44] that have you ever noticed how Satan
[1:11:46] hates two books in the Bible more than
[1:11:48] all others through liberal theologians
[1:11:50] and pseudo scientists he's always
[1:11:53] attacking the Book of Genesis and the
[1:11:54] Book of Revelation in both of these
[1:11:56] books we find Satan's origin his awful
[1:11:59] ways and his destruction that is why he
[1:12:03] attacks them he hates to be exposed and
[1:12:06] in those books he is exposed for exactly
[1:12:10] what he
[1:12:12] is I just want to jump ahead so
[1:12:15] bad but I have to just I hope it's okay
[1:12:19] we just take our time we'll just go
[1:12:21] through this book and we'll we'll read
[1:12:23] it together it's going to take a while
[1:12:24] but there's so much in here I think it's
[1:12:26] so important Jesus said about Satan he
[1:12:29] has no part in me and I have no part in
[1:12:31] him the devil would like to prove that
[1:12:34] different but he cannot so he does all
[1:12:37] he can to destroy confidence in the word
[1:12:40] and I want to throw this in there Satan
[1:12:42] has moved from Beyond just destroying
[1:12:45] confidence in the word even though
[1:12:46] that's the that's the bottom line that
[1:12:48] that really is the objective but what he
[1:12:50] has done in the minds and hearts of
[1:12:52] people genuine when people good people
[1:12:55] who believe this message of the hour who
[1:12:57] want to believe this message of the hour
[1:12:59] what he does is he destroys confidence
[1:13:01] in those people about the five-fold
[1:13:04] ministry because if they would actually
[1:13:07] believe the word if they would follow
[1:13:08] the word entirely they would have faith
[1:13:10] in the five-fold ministry because they
[1:13:12] would believe it's not the five-fold
[1:13:14] ministry it's not just some man chirping
[1:13:16] off at the pulpit it's the Lord Jesus
[1:13:19] Christ working on the desires in their
[1:13:21] hearts amen
[1:13:24] the word Jesus said about Satan he has
[1:13:27] no part in me I have no part in him the
[1:13:28] devil would like to prove that different
[1:13:30] but he cannot so he does all he can to
[1:13:33] destroy confidence in the word and I'll
[1:13:35] say and the ministry right yes but when
[1:13:38] the church disbelieves Satan and
[1:13:40] believes the spirit's revelation of the
[1:13:43] word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:13:45] against her and that's why I say tonight
[1:13:48] brothers and sisters if you can't sit
[1:13:50] under a Ministry go find a Ministry find
[1:13:54] someone that you can have confidence in
[1:13:56] so that the spirit can actually reveal
[1:13:58] himself to you because that's how he
[1:14:01] does it is through the five-fold
[1:14:03] ministry amen we can listen to tapes and
[1:14:06] that's good there's nothing wrong with
[1:14:08] listening to tapes so long as that's not
[1:14:09] our only way there's still a five-fold
[1:14:13] Ministry amen he goes on to talk about
[1:14:17] I'll just read it verse chapter 14 let
[1:14:20] me just put in a word here for my own
[1:14:21] Ministry if you don't mind you all know
[1:14:24] that this gift in my life is
[1:14:25] Supernatural it's a gift whereby the
[1:14:27] holy spirit is able to discern diseases
[1:14:30] and the thoughts of men's hearts and
[1:14:33] other hidden things that only God could
[1:14:35] know and then reveal to
[1:14:37] me I wish I could stand I wish you could
[1:14:41] stand with me and see the faces of
[1:14:42] people when Satan knows he's going to be
[1:14:44] exposed right now it isn't the people
[1:14:47] that I'm talking about it is that Satan
[1:14:49] has got a hold of their lives through
[1:14:51] sin in indifference and
[1:14:55] disease I I I
[1:14:58] think take note of those three things
[1:15:02] sin indifference and disease Satan gets
[1:15:06] a hold in people's lives this is what
[1:15:08] he's saying here but you should see
[1:15:11] their faces Satan knows he's going to be
[1:15:13] exposed and the most peculiar changes
[1:15:16] come over people's
[1:15:19] countenances Satan is afraid
[1:15:24] I want to say it tonight brothers and
[1:15:25] sisters amen he's the same yesterday
[1:15:27] today and forever yes he is and this
[1:15:30] I'll tell you the difference between the
[1:15:32] five-fold ministry and the Prophet this
[1:15:35] is just my opinion but I can say by
[1:15:37] experience i' I've experienced this the
[1:15:39] difference between the prophet is the
[1:15:41] prophet can look at a person while he's
[1:15:43] preaching and and he can discern the
[1:15:45] thoughts and the intents that's in the
[1:15:47] heart of the individual but when you get
[1:15:49] into the five-fold ministry they can't
[1:15:51] determine whose thoughts are are
[1:15:53] actually happening why they're actually
[1:15:55] going a certain way but it's the spirit
[1:15:57] of the Lord through Revelation that is
[1:16:00] causing that minister to preach what
[1:16:02] he's preaching right amen the word of
[1:16:04] God is Discerning the thoughts and the
[1:16:07] intents of the heart amen and you can
[1:16:10] see it on the faces of the people when
[1:16:12] you're
[1:16:13] preaching the most peculiar looks come
[1:16:16] across their faces when you can see that
[1:16:18] the spirit of the Lord is Discerning it
[1:16:21] right amen and sometimes people get
[1:16:23] upset about it they think that maybe
[1:16:26] someone's been talking or whatever I
[1:16:28] know I've said this so many times but
[1:16:29] it's so important brothers and sisters
[1:16:31] to recognize if you're hearing something
[1:16:33] discern speak to you directly don't
[1:16:36] automatically assume that someone's
[1:16:37] having a carnal conversation if you've
[1:16:40] come here asking the Lord to talk to you
[1:16:42] if you've come here to Worship the Lord
[1:16:44] Jesus Christ then he's speaking to you
[1:16:46] give him pray say Amen because this is
[1:16:50] the way that he's ordained for the
[1:16:51] Perfection of the Saints amen the only
[1:16:55] way it's going to work though is to say
[1:16:56] what the prophet said we've got to
[1:16:59] preach this message of the hour but when
[1:17:02] we do it will change the hearts of the
[1:17:04] people it will discern the thoughts and
[1:17:07] the intents of the heart it has to
[1:17:09] otherwise it's a different God it's a
[1:17:11] different word but he's the same
[1:17:13] yesterday today and forever amen my let
[1:17:16] me just put in a word here from my own
[1:17:18] Ministry if you don't mind you all know
[1:17:20] that this gift in my life is
[1:17:21] Supernatural it's a gift whereby the
[1:17:23] holy spirit is able to discern diseases
[1:17:26] the and the thoughts of men's hearts and
[1:17:28] other hidden things that only God could
[1:17:30] know and then revealed to me I wish you
[1:17:32] could stand with me and see the faces of
[1:17:34] people when Satan knows he's going to be
[1:17:37] exposed it's not people it's Satan knows
[1:17:40] he's going to be exposed now it isn't
[1:17:42] the people that I'm talking about here
[1:17:43] it's that Satan has got a hold in their
[1:17:45] lives through sin indifference and
[1:17:46] disease but you should see their faces
[1:17:49] Satan knows he's going to be exposed and
[1:17:51] the most peculiar changes come over the
[1:17:53] people's countenances Satan is afraid
[1:17:56] tonight Brothers and Sisters Jesus
[1:17:58] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:17:59] forever and so is Satan right he gets
[1:18:03] afraid when the word of God comes to
[1:18:05] town yes and we love it amen he knows
[1:18:09] that the spirit of God is about to let
[1:18:12] the people know of his works that's why
[1:18:14] he hates these meetings so much when
[1:18:17] names are called diseases are revealed
[1:18:19] Satan hates it now what is this it's not
[1:18:22] mind reading it's not telepathy nor is
[1:18:24] it Witchcraft and I'll say it's not
[1:18:27] people talking about people it's not
[1:18:29] gossip it is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:32] ministering to the church brother bradam
[1:18:34] says it's Revelation by the Holy
[1:18:37] Ghost beautiful is he says that's the
[1:18:40] only way I can know it of course the
[1:18:43] carnal mind will call it anything but
[1:18:46] the Holy Ghost so brothers and sisters
[1:18:49] if the word of God discerns something
[1:18:51] going on in your life don't don't call
[1:18:53] it carnally anything else say it's the
[1:18:56] Holy Ghost amen I want to say this and
[1:18:59] I'm sure that everyone would agree to me
[1:19:01] with me on this point and it's too bad
[1:19:03] we don't have more people here tonight
[1:19:05] but I would say this brothers and
[1:19:06] sisters this Church Calgary Living Word
[1:19:09] assembly is not about any one man it's
[1:19:12] not about any one board this church is
[1:19:14] founded on the revelation of Jesus
[1:19:17] Christ to the church in Calgary this is
[1:19:20] all about Jesus Christ
[1:19:23] so if you've come here and you hear the
[1:19:26] word of God ministering to you it's the
[1:19:28] Lord Jesus
[1:19:29] Christ it's a revelation amen and you
[1:19:33] have a reason to Rejoice Oh
[1:19:36] my he says let me show you another
[1:19:38] reason why Satan hates This Book of
[1:19:40] Revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:19:43] church he knows that Jesus Christ is the
[1:19:47] same yesterday and today and forever and
[1:19:51] changes not he knows that a whole lot
[1:19:54] more than do 90% of the
[1:19:58] theologians he knows that since God is
[1:20:01] immutable in his nature then he is just
[1:20:04] as immutable in his
[1:20:07] ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the
[1:20:10] original church at Pentecost with the
[1:20:13] power of God Mark 16 in action is the
[1:20:16] true church that Jesus claims as his own
[1:20:20] all else is false it has to be we still
[1:20:23] got 16 minutes let's turn over to Mark
[1:20:25] 16 quickly let's go there mark Matthew
[1:20:30] Mark
[1:20:33] 16 let's just let's just underline this
[1:20:36] here I'm just going to read the last bit
[1:20:38] it's called the Great Commission Mark 16
[1:20:40] we'll start with verse
[1:20:50] 15 Mark 16 in action is what he
[1:20:55] said Mark 16:1 15 and he said unto them
[1:20:59] go ye into all the world and preach the
[1:21:02] gospel to Every Creature he that
[1:21:04] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:21:07] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:21:09] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:21:12] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:21:15] out
[1:21:16] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:21:19] yes they shall take up serpents and if
[1:21:22] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[1:21:24] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[1:21:27] sick and they shall
[1:21:30] recover doesn't even say lay hands on
[1:21:32] the sick and pray for them it just says
[1:21:35] lay hands on the sick and they will
[1:21:37] recover amen but you know we've seen
[1:21:40] carnal impersonations of every single
[1:21:41] one of those I'm sure that we've seen
[1:21:44] them if you haven't I can tell you that
[1:21:47] you know they they have it going on
[1:21:48] they've they've impersonated William
[1:21:51] brandom and I believe believe there's
[1:21:53] even people out there who have the
[1:21:54] ability to cast out a devil for a moment
[1:21:58] but that Devil comes right back to the
[1:22:01] person people do that they impersonate
[1:22:03] that they speak with new tongues and we
[1:22:06] know that Devils speak with tongues
[1:22:08] don't they brother Bram said that the
[1:22:10] devil Satan can impersonate any gift in
[1:22:12] the
[1:22:14] church they speak with new tongues they
[1:22:17] can take up serpents there's people that
[1:22:19] do that snake handlers they call them
[1:22:22] once they get really inspired by the
[1:22:24] worship and and the music and everything
[1:22:26] that's going on then they bring out the
[1:22:28] snakes and they'll pass around the box
[1:22:30] of snakes and people can reach in and
[1:22:32] and grab a hold of a viper and they can
[1:22:34] dance with it and and get in the spirit
[1:22:37] and put it around their neck and then
[1:22:38] pass it over to someone else and you
[1:22:41] know they know that they've lived and
[1:22:42] they know they've got the spirit of God
[1:22:44] they're taking and impersonating
[1:22:46] carnally Mark 16 trying to put it into
[1:22:50] action but it's false right right they
[1:22:54] drank any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:22:56] them if they lay hands on the sick they
[1:22:57] shall recover we know that both of those
[1:23:00] have been impersonated I'm not going to
[1:23:01] get into that too much tonight to to try
[1:23:04] and and make a deal of it but what I do
[1:23:06] want to just underline is these signs
[1:23:09] shall
[1:23:10] what
[1:23:12] follow the first thing is revelation the
[1:23:15] first thing is the word of God getting
[1:23:18] the spirit to reveal himself personally
[1:23:21] to the individual we can get that to
[1:23:23] happen then you know what there's no
[1:23:25] stopping a Believer all of those signs
[1:23:27] will follow amen but God don't clown for
[1:23:33] nobody going on
[1:23:38] here paragraph 17 now remember this
[1:23:41] Christ in the true church is a
[1:23:42] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:23:45] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[1:23:48] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:23:50] church and defy it making it lukewarm
[1:23:54] formal and
[1:23:56] Powerless I think it's really sad to
[1:23:58] look at that but it's true it will come
[1:24:02] into the church and defile it but it
[1:24:04] will never come into the bride that's
[1:24:06] right amen it will never come into the
[1:24:08] Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the
[1:24:10] truly elect people will never have the
[1:24:12] the the Antichrist Spirit enter into her
[1:24:15] and cause her to be lukewarm formal and
[1:24:18] Powerless because the Bride of Jesus
[1:24:20] Christ will be the one that says I don't
[1:24:22] care who's here I don't care what's
[1:24:23] going on I've got an opportunity to
[1:24:25] worship God I'm going to worship God
[1:24:27] with all that I've got because I know
[1:24:28] what he's done for me I know that I'm
[1:24:30] redeemed and there's millions and
[1:24:32] billions of people in this world that
[1:24:34] think they're redeemed but they're truly
[1:24:36] not and other people that maybe would
[1:24:38] want to be redeemed but don't have any
[1:24:40] concept of redemption right but somehow
[1:24:44] God chose me and him before the
[1:24:45] foundation of the world it causes a
[1:24:48] reaction something
[1:24:51] happens it says he says it exposes Satan
[1:24:53] revealing his Works attempted
[1:24:55] destruction of God's people see that
[1:24:57] attempted destruction not destruction
[1:25:00] the attempted destruction of God's
[1:25:02] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:25:04] word right down to the time he's cast
[1:25:07] into the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[1:25:08] can't stand it that's why he's coming
[1:25:10] against the ministry so hard and he's
[1:25:12] not coming against the ministry so hard
[1:25:13] with bulldozers and tanks is he he's
[1:25:17] coming as an angel of Light to say that
[1:25:20] maybe there's a another messenger maybe
[1:25:22] there's someone else who's prophetic
[1:25:24] maybe they are prophetic but there's
[1:25:26] only one Prophet amen amen there's only
[1:25:29] one major prophet to this age he's come
[1:25:32] he's delivered the message thus saith
[1:25:33] the Lord and God took him home now it's
[1:25:36] up to us to take that message and carry
[1:25:38] on with it am amen but if we do that
[1:25:41] we're not going to do it differently
[1:25:42] than the way the messenger said true
[1:25:44] we're going to do it exactly the way the
[1:25:46] messenger said to do it yes and how is
[1:25:49] that that's exactly according to the
[1:25:50] word of God Amen is is not deviating
[1:25:52] from the word of God and saying that the
[1:25:54] prophet's message supersedes the word of
[1:25:56] God that's where the Crux of the problem
[1:25:58] is that's where we get down to the
[1:26:00] nitty-gritty because somewhere someone
[1:26:02] is trying to say that we can actually
[1:26:04] circumvent uh the word of God I'm going
[1:26:08] to stop with that I apologize I
[1:26:10] shouldn't go too far but it's true
[1:26:12] brothers and sisters we need to put the
[1:26:14] word of God at the central theme of Our
[1:26:16] Lives this has to be our absolute
[1:26:18] because that's exactly what the prophet
[1:26:19] of God said he did not say take my word
[1:26:22] over the word of God if that was the
[1:26:24] case he would have said that he would
[1:26:25] have said there was a misinterpretation
[1:26:27] to the Bible and you need to actually
[1:26:29] redo that portion of the Bible but he
[1:26:30] said if you can't take my word take his
[1:26:32] word
[1:26:33] amen paragraph 19 says he knows that if
[1:26:36] the people get the true revelation of
[1:26:39] the true church and what she is and what
[1:26:42] she stands
[1:26:43] for and that she can do the Greater
[1:26:45] Works amen she will be an invincible
[1:26:48] Army amen thank you Lord amen
[1:26:54] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:26:56] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:26:58] Christian church because it's not going
[1:26:59] to be the two Spirits out in the world
[1:27:03] it's not going to be the two Spirits in
[1:27:04] Hollywood it's not going to be the two
[1:27:06] Spirits in rock and roll amen it's not
[1:27:09] going to be the two Spirits in all of
[1:27:11] the rest of the worldly stuff it's going
[1:27:14] to be in the Christian church
[1:27:16] amen if they get a true revelation of
[1:27:18] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:27:19] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:27:23] not their own by God's spirit discern
[1:27:27] and withstand the Antichrist
[1:27:30] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:27:32] her
[1:27:34] amen he will be as definitely thwarted
[1:27:36] today as when Christ withstood his every
[1:27:39] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:27:43] desert personally when I read this book
[1:27:47] I come to that place and I have to just
[1:27:49] close it and I feel like running around
[1:27:50] the tree screaming and Shing
[1:27:52] I feel like having a Pentecostal Revival
[1:27:55] am because this shows me that there is a
[1:27:57] time right here where Satan will be
[1:28:00] powerless there is a time where we don't
[1:28:02] have to wait for the chains that's not a
[1:28:04] logging chain where where Satan will be
[1:28:06] bound with the chain for a thousand
[1:28:09] years we don't have to wait until a
[1:28:11] specific time where chains of
[1:28:13] circumstance will bind Satan and throw
[1:28:15] him into the bottomless pit no we'll be
[1:28:17] able to bind him here he will actually
[1:28:20] be powerless before us but first we've
[1:28:22] got to be able to discern the spirit
[1:28:24] within the framework of the Christian
[1:28:25] church we got to understand that that
[1:28:27] Antichrist Spirit goes to church that's
[1:28:29] right that Antichrist Spirit wants to
[1:28:31] tell us don't have faith in a five-fold
[1:28:34] Ministry amen that Antichrist Spirit
[1:28:37] wants to tell us there's something
[1:28:39] better than the word of God you know
[1:28:41] what there's nothing better than the
[1:28:43] word of God because that's what the
[1:28:44] prophet of God said thus sayith the
[1:28:49] Lord yes Satan hates Revelation but we
[1:28:52] love it with true Revelation in our
[1:28:55] lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:28:58] against
[1:28:59] who against us the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:29:04] Prevail against us but we will prevail
[1:29:09] over them we don't have to worry about
[1:29:11] the Gates of Hell coming against us
[1:29:13] brothers and sisters tonight I just want
[1:29:15] to over over over overemphasize get the
[1:29:18] true Spirit of Revelation in our lives
[1:29:22] allow his Spirit to come into our lives
[1:29:24] and minister to us maybe there's
[1:29:26] something in our lives that we've said
[1:29:28] you know I can take most of the message
[1:29:30] of the hour but I just can't take that
[1:29:32] one part or or or maybe there's there's
[1:29:34] something about having the five-fold
[1:29:35] ministry and I can only just go so far
[1:29:38] and then and then you got to stop there
[1:29:39] because of whatever happened you know
[1:29:41] what I want to say just try God and see
[1:29:44] if he's not God just say God if you're
[1:29:46] God and this is the word that you gave
[1:29:48] through the prophet for our day then go
[1:29:50] ahead and reveal yourself to me through
[1:29:52] this Revelation and see if he won't yes
[1:29:55] and I guarantee you brothers and sisters
[1:29:57] he'll take you to a higher level he will
[1:29:59] take all of us to a higher level if
[1:30:01] we're willing to let them the only way
[1:30:03] we can let them though is to get down
[1:30:06] because the Way Up Is Down we've got to
[1:30:08] Humble ourselves we've got to Humble our
[1:30:10] pride we got to be willing to say maybe
[1:30:12] the things that I've been taught the
[1:30:14] things that I've I've thought for years
[1:30:16] maybe for decades I just want to push
[1:30:18] them all aside and say Lord be fresh
[1:30:20] unto me tonight Lord reveal yourself
[1:30:23] further unto me tonight help me to just
[1:30:25] tear off all the scar tissue and get
[1:30:27] down to the fresh meat of the matter
[1:30:30] give me fresh meat tonight Lord and see
[1:30:32] if he won't do it I guarantee you he
[1:30:35] will but you know what happens when we
[1:30:38] do that it gets a little bit scary and I
[1:30:39] know it I know it does but you know I
[1:30:42] also know the only way that you're going
[1:30:44] to get anywhere with God is to be
[1:30:45] willing to do that to take down all of
[1:30:48] the high places in our lives to tear
[1:30:50] down all of the idol all of the things
[1:30:53] that we've we've followed and allowed to
[1:30:54] grow to be taller than the word of God
[1:30:56] in our lives tear them down smash them
[1:30:59] down kick out the trash out of the house
[1:31:01] and see if God won't reveal himself in a
[1:31:03] greater way brothers and sisters Satan
[1:31:06] hates Revelation but we love it with
[1:31:08] true Revelation in our lives the Gates
[1:31:10] of Hell cannot Prevail against us what
[1:31:14] are the gates of hell
[1:31:16] today now let's get on with it brothers
[1:31:19] and sisters is it television is it video
[1:31:23] games is it movies is it
[1:31:27] pornography where's all the gates of
[1:31:29] hell those are all gates of hell and if
[1:31:32] you're going to allow them to Prevail
[1:31:34] over you you don't have the right
[1:31:36] Revelation but if you've got that
[1:31:38] Revelation that we're talking about
[1:31:40] tonight they won't have any power over

[1:32:19] bombs can go off the bride goes home am
[1:32:23] where are we at tonight are we going to
[1:32:25] let the Gates of Hell Prevail over us

[1:32:29] this Revelation and Prevail over the
[1:32:32] gates of
[1:32:33] hell because it's not going to be a
[1:32:35] church it's not going to be a teacher
[1:32:37] it's not going to be an evangelist it's
[1:32:39] not going to be any great ministry it's
[1:32:41] only going to be the revelation of Jesus

[1:34:23] sacrifice and that it was a revelation

[1:34:36] a revelation and you said so that it was
[1:34:39] given unto Peter from from your father

[1:34:44] Blood it wasn't a theology school
[1:34:47] teaching he wasn't taught that by flesh
