[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] Long after the tears fall,
[0:20] I'm still your child.
[0:23] I put down my defensees
[0:28] and lay down my pride.
[0:32] Love and forgiveness
[0:36] flowing deep and wide. So I'll run to
[0:41] you
[0:43] and surrender
[0:46] all as I lay down my life
[0:52] and pick up my cross.
[0:56] What a joy it is to give my life away to
[1:03] you.
[1:04] All that I need
[1:08] and all that I seek
[1:12] is you here with me. Holy Spirit,
[1:18] have your way
[1:22] in me.
[1:24] [Music]
[1:29] In times of trouble,
[1:33] though trials may come,
[1:37] the rock of ages
[1:41] still standing strong.
[1:45] I'm fighting battles,
[1:49] but the war is won. So I'll run to you
[1:56] and surrender
[1:59] now as I lay down my life
[2:05] and pick up my cross.
[2:09] What a joy it is to give my life away to
[2:16] you.
[2:17] All that I need
[2:21] and all that I see
[2:25] is you here with me. Holy Spirit,
[2:31] have your way
[2:35] in me.
[2:39] Hallelujah.
[2:41] More of you
[2:45] and less of me. God, more
[2:51] of you
[2:53] and less of me. God, more
[2:59] of you
[3:01] and less of me, my God. More
[3:07] of you overflowing
[3:13] [Music]
[3:16] as I lay down my life
[3:21] and take up my cross.
[3:26] What a joy it is to give my life
[3:31] away to you.
[3:33] All that I need
[3:37] and all that I see
[3:41] is you here with me. Holy Spirit.
[3:47] As I lay down my life
[3:53] and pick up my cross,
[3:57] my joy is to give my life
[4:02] away.
[4:03] [Music]
[4:05] All that I need
[4:08] and all that I see
[4:12] is you here with me, Holy Spirit.
[4:17] Spirit,
[4:18] have your way
[4:22] in me over and over again.
[4:28] Holy Spirit, Lord Jesus,
[4:32] have
[4:34] your
[4:36] way in me.
[4:40] [Music]
[4:46] [Applause]
