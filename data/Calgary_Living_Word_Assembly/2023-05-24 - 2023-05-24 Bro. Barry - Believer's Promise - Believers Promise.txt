change father we know that we have a date father there's a time appointed of you father and Lord until that day Lord we know that you took 39 stripes for our healing Lord and we just commit that healing to our our brother Henry's dad Lord we just asked that you would touch his body tonight father you would touch his mind Lord that you would just help him father to have courage and

and father we'll do our part father we just love you and we thank you and we just want to commit every aspect of this service into your hands tonight father Lord we pray that you would just feed your children once again Lord we've all come Desiring to hear from you just want to ask all of these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians thank you for the specials I believe I always forget to say thank you for the specials if I don't ever say thank you for them I want to say thank you they're so wonderful they set such an atmosphere it does something for the atmosphere of the church tonight I'd like to read from Ephesians chapter 1 once again while you're turning there we'll just have a couple of announcements um I've sent out the the vote so if you have not received it and you would like to vote and you qualify to be able to vote please reach out and let me know and I'll make sure that you're able to do that uh we'll we'll announce the results on Sunday coming up we have communion service on the 28th of the month and we have uh brother Mervin taking the 31st service so the book of Ephesians chapter one I just like to read verse 3 and verse 4 tonight blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word thank you Lord that it's a Living Word and father we we don't want to just be formal and lukewarm and Powerless father we want to recognize that this word the only way this word can have life is if you Quicken it and when you Quicken it father then it is truly a Living Word father I pray that tonight we could just take these words that were spoken that were read your Eternal Word father and that you would just allow it father to Quicken our souls father Lord that it would just be more than print on pages father that we would be able to read between the lines father that you would just open this word to us like those two on the road to Emmaus father Lord we need to hear from you it takes your spirit to make these words life to us father so we just invite you father to have the preeminence in the service now help me to get out of the way father help the listeners to get out of the way help all of us father to just open our hearts and our minds unto you father and give you the preeminence that you desire Lord then we'll be careful to give you the prayer praise we just ask that you would be with all those who couldn't be here tonight for whatever reason Lord that you would just bless them abundantly above all they could ask or think now Lord we just want to commit this service entirely into your hands that when we leave here tonight we could say truly we heard from you we just love you and we thank you we ask all of these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated certainly wonderful to see everyone here tonight I'd like to speak on the believer's position and we've been taking so much time talking about the the positions and and the family and we know that one of the one of the things that God had in his mind is he he wanted to have a family he had an attribute that he needed to express and that's why he chose to express it in mankind and to have a a family but you know I want to take it from the perspective of Ephesians chapter five verse 31 and 32 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh as we heard brother Gilbert say at the beginning of the year I and my father are one that's the purpose that the the people purposed in their hearts and we know that it wasn't the people even it was the devil in the people they purposed to kill Jesus Christ when he was on Earth and it was just fine that he said you know I can heal you and I can deliver you and and I can preach the word real good we can have wonderful meetings but as soon as I begin to declare I and my father are one that's when the people wanted to kill Jesus and you know the devil wants to keep us from receiving that Revelation in our hearts and and I believe it with all of my heart the more that that I talk about it even I feel the pressure of the enemy saying no don't don't go there and and the more I think about it the more it becomes a little bit confusing to me in my mind but I know one thing is for certain when we get up here and we just follow the leadership of the Lord and the notes that he gives us I know something's happening I know that that we are coming to a place brothers and sisters where Satan doesn't want us to get to and that is in our true position because once we get there once the bride body gets to that place where truly she is one with the Lord then Satan is powerless before her and it will be a short quick demonstration not of her power because she has none of her own it's all his power but it'll be a short quick demonstration of his power to this world and then the bride goes home and I think that's what we're all hungering and thirsting for we had such a wonderful time on Sunday after service thank you everyone for coming and participating it's just almost like a taste of the Millennium I just I just wonder will we play music there will we just play songs and and worship I kind of think we will and probably will eat probably will rest but we won't need to rest because we're tired and we won't need to eat because we're hungry we'll just be there doing what we love to do together it'll be so wonderful talking about the believer's position in Christ tonight that is what I want to talk about and and that is truly the believer's position we know that the wife's position is with her husband even in her husband and and the husband's position is with his wife and uh the children's position is with their parents you know sometimes I I remember growing up as a kid it was something that was maybe a little bit uh common sort of in the area that I was living or maybe it was something I saw on television as a child I don't know but children ran away from home sometimes when they're trying to make a statement to their parents now I'm not in any way saying that anyone should ever do that as a child because you're not going to make any statement other than you are rebellious as a child to your parents you have god-given parents for a purpose but I just was it just came to me now and I was thinking you know it's wonderful because sometimes we want to just run away we want to just run away from our problems and what that demonstrates as a child is running away from your problems isn't going to solve anything it's just going to give you a multiplicity of new problems and you know this world is full of bad people and there's people out there that would just love to get a hold of a child that has no authority over them nobody helping them nobody watching over them and and it's a terrible terrible thing but it's a very real thing and you know it's just the same thing I can't help but think it's the same exact thing for a Believer to want to run away from from their leadership from from their headship from from their protection and when that happens when the devil can get us to get away from from our leadership from our protection from our parents so to speak and the devil's got us he's he's got easy access to us and that's what Satan wants he just wants to get us out of our position if he can do that then he's got some some success in our lives but we know as Sons and Daughters of God it will only be for a short while he'll never have true success in our lives even if we give it to him or not he will never do it because if this scripture that we read tonight out of Ephesians chapter one if he has Cho chosen us verse 4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world ain't nobody ever going to touch us Satan can't have us God might say you can put your hand on his life you can you can put the pressure to him so that we can actually see that maturity come out and you know we know Christ he only learned obedience through the sufferings in his life right and not one of us is going to be exempt from from that angle from that direction we have got to go through sufferings in this life and sometimes children our parents can be tough to contend with sometimes our parents are tired sometimes our parents are frustrated sometimes our parents are angry sometimes they're negligent but it doesn't change the fact that they're your parents and you have to obey them because that's your position as a child and it's the same thing as a husband to a wife and the same thing as a wife to a husband but the key to it I believe as a Believer a Believer will always say I was wrong I recognize that I was wrong because when we have the spirit of Christ he will tell you you did wrong you need to go fix that and whether we listen to that voice and fix it or not is is completely up to us but talking about our position and Believers I don't even know how I got into that uh children's thing wow brother Branham says out of the believer's position in Christ such a beautiful message and it's in the 50s too I just think it's so wonderful because we could say you know that was before the seals I think we've gone over this so many times but you know before the seals were open was brother Branham a prophet he was a prophet from his mother's womb right that's that's the office of a prophet so the entirety of the message is applicable the believer's position in Christ um sorry I didn't even put it there it's out of 1955 but you know when when when you do have um the latter part of the message in you when you've eaten that book you know that the stuff that he's saying in the early parts of the message it's just right in line there's no part that's that's off there's a couple places where he was off but he did go and correct that I'm not going to get into that tonight but out of this message believer's position of Christ he says how many Christians are here raise up your hands all the Believers raise up your hands everywhere oh I suppose that's wonderful he says 100 percent now if you're a Believer I believe that I know what the greatest curse that's on the church today is not knowing what they are the greatest curse that's on the church today is not knowing what they are the believer's position in Christ just so beautiful how our positions play into this and and I'll just slide this in right here if we want to be in our positions in Christ brothers and sisters be the best husband that you can be be the best wife that you can be be the best child that you can be be the best in your position in your job that you can be just do your very best live live your life like your Christ to this world and and you will actually show a Living Word to this world but the Bible goes on they say he says now with the help of God this afternoon the holy scriptures if he will help us let's try to place the believer positionally in Christ and show what is his authority in Christ then everybody out there will be praying for the sick and will be having a great meeting I'm sure and I just can't help but think it's so relevant tonight as we gather together if we can just consider what our position is in Christ brothers and sisters he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places he's chosen us before in in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame I just want to dwell there for a few minutes holy and Without Blame and I think the way that the scripture is written it's not to confuse us and I think it's important for us to recognize that it's not written maybe the way that we speak it and that we would comprehend it in in our English language now I'm not going to claim to be grammarically correct or a scholar but I just want to bring this to our our thoughts and and make us consider this that that he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love that word that isn't saying something in the future that some time out there we should be holy and and before him in love blameless it's that he has done that that we truly are before him blameless in love that he chose us to be holy and Without Blame before the foundation of the world that's our position in Christ brothers and sisters not to be condemned with this world not to be saying that you know I did this wrong and I did that wrong and I know I'm going to do something wrong tomorrow so I might as well just give up and and and just live a half-baked Christian life because it's the only life that I know that's not it at all satan wants us to dwell there Satan wants us to be the ones that are just moping around because we don't recognize our position but if we can recognize that you are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ if you want to talk about the the times of the message and and and what do you call it the uh progressive revelation at the end of the message of the hour just before he signs off he says that you are the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ and you never did it in the first place why is that because of Ephesians chapter one he chose you in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and Without Blame there's no way that you could be holy on your own brothers and sisters there's no way that we could be holy on our own I just was thinking about it this afternoon you know what was it like in the Garden of Eden there was a real Harmony that existed there wasn't it just a tremendous Harmony starting with you know even God coming and walking with them in the cool of the evening God himself just coming and walking with them in the cool of the evening just to be able to fellowship with God and ask any question brother Branham talks about the way it was without him I think I've got the quote here but just the way he says it that you know Adam there was nothing held back from him when he was in the Garden of Eden he was the son of God and what could he do he could just go and and crawl right up in daddy's knee he's a man but he was still a son brother Bradham says he could just go and crawl right up in daddy's knee and say Daddy what about this what what about that you could just ask him any question and God would take the time to explain it son you know what here's the answer just exactly the way you want it and you ask that question because I wanted you to ask that question and this is why I wanted you to ask that question to think about the harmony that would be in the garden and then he says you know what I know that my son is a little bit lonely so I'm going to create a woman I'm going to take one from his side a rib out of his side and just allow her to be instead of being in him she'll be with him and isn't it interesting because now in the Garden of Eden he has a bride he has Eve that just comes out of him God takes her from inside of him so that she could be there expressed in his life and there's a a real Harmony still she understands she's the wife she understands that Adam is is is her husband and they both understand that God is the head of both of them and and that he is the head of the church there's there's none greater than God and they understand there's a Harmony in all of creation understands there's this harmony but what happens is that battle that started in heaven Satan coming down and being positionally placed in the garden so that God could express his attributes something interrupts this harmony and Eve gets out from the headship of her husband and begins to think on her own begins to reason on her own begins to think that you know what I don't know if I should take everything that my husband says to be 100 correct I think I should maybe listen to another voice just a little bit because I have I have I have critical thinking in my in my body in my mind so maybe I should just think a little bit about what's been said and and consider what this serpent is telling me can you imagine that Harmony was broken right there before she acted before anything happened the harmony was broken when she stopped accepting her husband's word as soon as she stepped out and said I'm going to think for myself I'm going to do this on my own that's when it ended that's when it changed we know there's a whole bunch of different things and you know brothers and sisters I can't help but think it's the other way around in the in the realm that we live the the world that we're in now at the farthest end of of time and creation from Adam and Eve from that timeline you know we're in a place now where we need to fight everything that's within us I would say as wives to surrender our will to our husband's will to be in our position and the husbands need to do that with their own will to be the Bride of Jesus Christ to be in their position for the Lord and accept his word to be the ultimate for them but we know that something happened in the garden once that reasoning happened Adam stepped out for his wife she was deceived but Adam wasn't deceived Adam knew exactly what he was doing can you imagine that brothers and sisters to step out from that Harmony for your wife whoo you must have loved her I just want to say this and I'm not saying anybody wouldn't but how many of us as husbands would do that step out for our wives today this far down the line with this much polluted DNA how many of us would do that knowing that God could just get us another one how many times do we hear that even in a message it's okay to get divorced you can just get divorced if you're divorced you can just get remarried again because of this reason and because of this quote and because of this angle really I don't know I don't want to do that I shouldn't do that I apologize Christ wasn't deceived either was he he came and he stepped out and that's what dupe Satan I just I'll say it again how holy was God how holy is God how holy was Jesus Christ standing before God when when God would come down and express himself in a Manger in as a baby as a human being to condescend how far was that condescension I think one day maybe we'll begin to consciously understand that but it's just amazing and the reason for it was for the love of his bride when his bride Adam stepped out and said you know what I can't let my wife go I can't let her go because I love her she's a part of me I've got to go after her isn't it wonderful that that's exactly what God has done and in our scripture tonight we can see that that that he he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and Without Blame you know I just can't help but think about all that Adam lost we know that it's been restored in the day in which we live in all that Adam lost has been restored and this is out of the fundamental foundation for faith in 1955 not 65. what about him says an Adam never had to be sick talk about this harmony a little bit in the garden he never had to be sick he never had to die he never had to worry he never had a heartache he never had a fear I heard a brother I think it was brother Donnie Reagan talk about this if nobody's heard it I I it's unreal the way he says it can you imagine what it would have been like that first moment that very first moment when Adam had that very first Rush of adrenaline in his body because of fear he had never experienced it it was a brand new thing he'd never ever experienced fear but when that fear happened suddenly the adrenaline just totally took over his body what that would have been like it was so strong it caused them to go and hide from God from their husband from their dad from his daddy the one that he could just climb up in his knees and ask him anything suddenly he's running and hiding he never had to die he never had to worry he never had heartache he never had fear he just climbed up in the arms of the father and just like a child everything was his whatever he asked why he just got it everything obeyed him because he was God's child and the child is heir of all things now when man fell he lost this and now what he lost in the fall Christ come as a redeemer did you ever stop to think of what Christ redeemed us for he gave us eternal life he brought us back to the Eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall I just think that's beautiful now there's some people I know that would say well you know what it didn't take a profit to come and say that and maybe it didn't but maybe it did maybe it took someone with a prophetic insight to be able to put this together because who else is saying this in in the history of mankind everyone else is saying you know what if you just do what I tell you to do everything will be fine just take communion the way we take communion just do what we do and everything will be good it's not so unless you come according to the word of God all things that Adam lost are not restored to you brother Branham he goes on to say now the thing of it is since he has restored man back to his place man in the fall has lost his consciousness of what father put him here on Earth to do in other words all of the plumbing as it was in our brain and in the outlets the faith has been clogged up with business affair with home life domestic things it's all become so clogged clogged up with that until God can't operate through those channels that he made a man for he's caused us to be those channels brothers and sisters he created us in him before the foundation of the world chosen in him to be holy and Without Blame so that we could be those channels for him to operate through but that's the trick of the devil is to get us so busy and so distracted with everything in this life that we can no longer have access to those channels and you know some might say brother Barry that's easy for you to say because you don't have a job now I I don't actually have a physical employee now that's correct but I'll tell you what I did I did it for years and I'll say it this way I did it in such a way that I was not very smart I didn't listen to the instruction of my parents I disobeyed my parents I didn't run away but I didn't go to school and I understood the only way that I was going to get anything was to work and to work hard so I had better Pony up and and work my my my fingers to the Bone and so I did that brothers and sisters I understand what hard work is I understand what it means to get clogged up in the channels with the cares of this life I 100 understand that and I think that God allowed me to do so much in certain ways that I will never be able to forget that so that that's not even going to be really a discussion I understand it but that's why I'm trying to say it tonight to us That these channels can get clogged up but that's why we come to church and that's why we gather together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we can run some Roto-Rooter through those drains to try and unclog the channels a little bit and the more the channels get on clogged brothers and sisters the more success we see of the spirit in our lives the more we're going to want to unclear those channels the more we're going to recognize the spiritual Amnesia that we're experiencing brother random talks about an experience spiritual Amnesia if you listen to that message that's totally off off base for what we're talking about but I just listen now to a lot of messages and and that's one of them that it kind of talks about this in in a different way but we can forget about our position and that's what brother Branham says here tonight we read that quote it's the the the most difficult thing for the church in the age in which we live in she doesn't remember her position but if we can remember our position brothers and sisters that Satan belongs under our feet and if he's anywhere else in our lives brothers and sisters he's out of his position but we have been given Authority we don't have any power of our own brother Bradham talks about it we can we can have all of the authority that we allow the Lord to work through in our lives but we've got no power it's only Authority you know brother Branham uses that example of the policeman standing there you can have a car worth 400 horsepower and raging down the road it's going and you know that policeman can go on stand out on the street and raise up his hand and say stop and it doesn't mean anything does it but if that policeman takes out his badge his badge that token he can show that token and say stop because there's Authority behind that badge that person driving the car knows that he better stop because if he doesn't he'll be in big trouble but all all of the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets of of the faith have been clogged up with the business affair with a home life domestic things it's all become so clogged up until God can't operate through those channels that he made man for now when God made the human body every little part had its place to play the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God has everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make man to live and if God so patterned the man the body of a man how much more has he patterned and said in order the body of Christ the church I just think it's beautiful brothers and sisters you've been given Authority we haven't been given power we have no power we've been given Authority though you know in the seventh seal brother Branham says in a different way and then just then a voice shook down through there That Rock The Rock said it's the sword of the king and then I come out of it the sword of the king now if it said a sword of a king but it said the sword of the king and there was only one king and that's God and he has one sword and that's his word what I've lived by that so help me God standing over his holy desk here with this holy word laying here it's the word amen oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and the secret and he goes on to say the third poll but you know brothers and sisters tonight I just mentioned that because I want to remind us that all that Adam lost has been restored but it's not the way that maybe we would want to think about as we think about this and the harmony that we talked about in the Garden of Eden and how beautiful it was and maybe how there was no rain and probably no thunder or lightning it was all just gently misted throughout the night and everything grew so Lush and green and it was just perfect harmony all the birds everything was wonderful that's not what we're talking about having a restoration to what we are talking about having a restoration to is the word of God and when brother Branham tells that story about the sword of the king there is only one sword and that's his word he says that it's his word that has been restored to Mankind and his word is what will take us to that Perfection that we're going to we will see that kind of perfection brothers and sisters it's coming there is a restoration of all things that's coming we're going to live on this Earth in a restored condition that was one of the threefold purpose was to restore all things to restore the kingdom and and that's what's going to happen but you know Hebrews 4 12 says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and what does it do piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit exactly what happened in the meetings of William Mary and Branham and I just think it's beautiful because I know it's exactly what happens when we get in a room full of Believers that have sang the songs of Zion and call upon the name of the Lord when a minister Gets behind the pulpit it doesn't matter who it is when you get a group of Believers together pulling on the word of God it's the same word of God it doesn't take a prophet to come and discern the thoughts that are in the heart with the sword of the word it's piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit into the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart that sword has been placed back in the hands of men again brothers and sisters and it's not for gain it's not for personal gain and many times people might say it you know you had a conversation with somebody so you know that I want to say did did someone really have a conversation with somebody or was it the spirit of God Discerning your thoughts Discerning your conversation remember the syrians the king of Syria were saying who's talking who's the the rat who's who's telling everyone what we're doing our secrets our battle plans and it was one of the wise men that he had there he said you know what there's a prophet in the land and that's what the problem is you need to you need to go and talk to that guy get get some words from him because he's the one that's Discerning the thoughts and it's not even him it's just his God you know that's the same Spirit brothers and sisters that we're dealing with here and who is dealing with us better not us dealing with him but he's he's dealing with us and you know he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings I think it's so important for us to remember that it's not something that we need to overlook and maybe just just take for granted blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings where at brothers and sisters in Heavenly places but where's the Heavenly places the last word of this verse is in Christ if you want your your your all spiritual blessings it's in Christ and where is Christ today brothers and sisters it's this book but we have to eat this book if we eat this book then Christ is going to be blessing us with all spiritual blessings in us because we will actually have Christ in US but if we never eat the book then how are we ever going to get Christ in us just coming to church on its own ain't enough it's not enough you got to be like John and eat the book when you eat the book your spirit is going to love it but yours your body is just gonna detest it it's so hard to read the book to take the time to have devotions but take the time set aside a little bit of time just do that just eat the book If You Can Eat the book there is a real spiritual blessing that comes to us I just love that that thought tonight about the the harmony that existed in the Garden of Eden and you know I I just want to say it tonight brothers and sisters when we're in our positions as husbands as wives as children as as the church as deacons as trustees as Treasurer when we're in our positions there is a Harmony that exists and you know we might not actually see a Harmony where we're walking hand in hand singing Onward Christian Soldiers what we're not talking about that kind of Harmony we're talking about the harmony of the word in our lives and I think I could take a whole series on the harmony of the word to think about the the power of that but you know brothers and sisters the harmony that existed in the Garden of Eden is now existing in The Bride of Jesus Christ in in the mystical body of Jesus Christ it's not and a specific geographical location on this Earth it's as the lightning travels from the East to the West that's that's what's happening with the spirit of the Lord right now the day in which we live brother Branham he says this these notable words and and we've heard it all I know we have but I just want to remind us about our position in Christ brothers and sisters as we follow this word as we eat the book as we just keep pressing on towards that Mark or the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus as we keep doing that and not letting anything Shake us from our position in Christ brother Branham he's got words the Holy Spirit has words through his Prophet for us he says the members of the Virgin bride will love him and remember the only way that we're going to be a bride of Jesus Christ is to be a virgin to him and the only way that we're going to be a virgin to him is to not let any other word get in the way not let anybody come to reason with us and say you know I I know this this was said but it was really meant that any of that none of it just like Eve in the beginning when we talked about when when the serpent came and gave her the ability to do some some some critical thinking about the word of her husband this word when we accept it it causes us to be a virgin to it as well but only the people who have been chosen in him before the foundation of the world will be able to it's just the way it is the members of the Virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials they will have his potentials they will discern they will be able to encourage they will be able to heal they will be able to drink any deadly thing and it won't harm them it's the way it is they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him outside of him brothers and sisters it's satanic isn't it to have power in this life without character and and character there's only one character let's just be frank about that there's only one character and that character is the word of God the word of God character brothers and sisters is the only thing that we want anything to do with but when we have that character in our lives all power belongs to him when he's in us we have his potential they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads this is the part that brought me to this he says notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first shown him by the father John 5 19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride if you ever want to wonder about what that means um it's not like we're just gonna have a vision from Heaven God's Not Just Gonna lightning bolt a vision into our heart to see what the father wants done this is where it's critical for us to know the word of God because when we have eaten this book we might not always remember it we might not be able to quote the scriptures but let me assure you if you eat the book genuinely ask God to reveal it to you what will happen is the word will come back to you we know the word of God says take no thought for what you should say in that hour right and and we know for certain there's times where that word will just come to us the word of God that we have eaten it will just rise to the surface and we'll be like why am I thinking this what is that and you know we can just go at that point and look it up and then you'll say wow that's the word that came to my heart and this is the scripture that it's from you know what happens that's the word of God Discerning our thoughts that's the harmony between the father and the son right there he says notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the Father John 5 19. his word is the word it's our word that's me speaking here brother Brown I'm going on he says this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it Eve doubted it didn't she she said yeah I'll accept somebody else's word and I'll I'll maybe challenge that I'll entertain that but she doesn't the Bride of Jesus Christ doesn't she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death this is where I want to say you know I believe believers they don't get afraid they just say hey you know what God wants to change my dwelling place that's all he's got a better body that's already waiting for me if he wants to lay me down with cancer in a bed or or wind up in a car crash or something happens if if it has to happen that way then that's God's choice there's no accidental death in this world it doesn't happen it's only because God allows it she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again and what will water it brothers and sisters it's the word the only thing is the word there's the word that's the seed and then the spirit of Christ Waters that seed for the seed will be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word how many wives know what the husband wants done with his word I just was thinking about that today it's such an amazing thing we were talking about a little while ago it was just a funny little thing but we we witnessed a wife that was just doing things for her husband and he wasn't even asking her and and we were like man look at that she's just doing what that husband would like she just knows what would please her husband and so she's just doing it because she knows that's his word he's not always saying to her oh you got to do this or you got to do that or you got to do this or you got to do that and I you know here I am talking like this now brother Barry he's gonna get a a plug for the husbands tonight I'm not looking to do that brothers and sisters I'm trying to bring it from a spiritual context but remember we've talked about the positions and knowing that that there's there's ways we need to behave in in our world in our lives the wife wants to please the husband and if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ then you're his wife and you want to please your husband we want to please our husband we don't want to wait for him to try and push us down the two brother Bradham talks about that that's one of the problems with the church just waiting for God to show me what to do show me what to do just go walk go March forward by faith and see if he won't direct your path because that's according to his word here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it wasn't Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass and see brothers and sisters we can read that and say well I've seen things in my life where I've prayed and I've spoken the word and hasn't come to pass the way that I've desired I've prayed and and spoken the word hasn't come to pass and the reason for that is not because of you is because of God it's not exactly the way God wants it done or it would come to pass the way that we have wanted it to I believe it just comes to the place where we need to know that it's not our will not my will Lord but let thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven it's got to be according to his will then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that's planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word and and so I just want to mention that paragraph I think I do it every time but I just want to continually do it I want to make sure that we just stick together with this they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still and and you either have the word of God or you don't when you have the word of God you have thus saith the Lord this is thus saith the Lord this is that word that the the sword that was placed back into the hands of the Prophet so it could be an example of it being placed back into the hands of mankind some people don't have thus saith the Lord brothers and sisters and that's why they keep still and I would say this that if the bride the true elect bride of Jesus Christ has an idea that comes to her mind and it doesn't line up with the word she'll keep still too but if it lines up with the word you got no reason to keep still brothers and sisters there's no reason at all for us to keep still just like Joshua and Caleb they they were told to go forwards and and be strong and very courageous don't don't don't turn to the right hand or to the left hand just keep going the way you're going because you believe the word for your day they have thus saith the Lord and they keep still they know it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word it's outside of the word it's someone else's word brothers and sisters he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride I I just love this this really struck me tonight she knows that she knows that such a simple statement do you know that tonight brothers and sisters we're fulfilling the end time Prophecy of the world she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now and if you remember this what I'm reading here someone might say well it's out of the programian church age and just out of the church age book brother Branham take some time to express it that I was just pondering one night and the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said pick up your pen and write this is a message that I want your your pen to put to paper because this is going to go forwards to a group of people that are going to say Amen to this word this was the Holy Ghost speaking here brothers and sisters not just a man talking about things this is God sending a direct message for his bride he did not complete all his Earthly work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time this is the exposition of the seven Church ages the pergamian church age I just think it's beautiful brothers and sisters because she knows that she just knows that there was there was stuff that needed to be finished there was there was scripture that needed to be fulfilled there needed to be a people that didn't actually go by the way of the Grave there needed to be people here that just believe the word of God with all of their heart even though they'd never met Jesus they'd never followed a Ministry they never even met William Miriam Branham but something inside this word that was stored up it just caused them to say Amen from their innermost being there's something about this word there had to be a people to fulfill that part of scripture the brothers and sisters we've been given all spiritual blessings and and I just want to say it this way if we can just recognize that all spiritual blessings tonight it's not about having uh uh God bless my bank account and God gave me a job and and God gave me this and and brought me there and and did this other wonderful thing for me brothers and sisters the spiritual blessings all of the spiritual blessings are right here this is all the spiritual blessings in Heavenly places because this is the only thing that's going to heaven outside of our character is God's word we're not taking any bit of this world with us brothers and sisters it's only his word remember one time in our lives out of Ephesians chapter 2 verse 11 wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called uncircumcision by which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world that's where we were brothers and sisters without this message of the hour we could receive something else for our day but would it have satisfied us I doubt it otherwise why are we here tonight there's no way that would have been enough for us verse 13 says but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ we have been drawn in him from before the foundation of the world to be holy and Without Blame he chose us in him before the foundation of the world I so want to get into verse 5. I could probably say it and and we could come back to it later on he's he's predestinated having predestinated us unto the adoption of children he's chosen us to be those ones that can go and crawl back up in his lap and talk to our daddy and say what about this and what about that and how do we do that brothers and sisters by reading the word of God and going on our knees just picture that going on your knees you're not going on your knees on the hard concrete floor or on your soft beautiful carpet floor you're going and crawling up in Daddy's knees and saying Lord I want to spend some time with you I want you to whisper in my ear I want you to tell me things that I don't know I want you to tell me the things that I need to know I want to hear your voice in my ear I don't want to just say that oh it's impossible for God to for God to speak to man for men to be able to hear God that's that's for some people some people can't hear that voice but others brothers and sisters we know other people can hear the voice of God and once you've heard the voice of God you won't hear any other voice there's no other voice that we want to hear boy oh boy and that's what causes us to be here in in a in a weird little message church that's what causes it to happen is God speaks to us personally that's what the new birth is that's what it's all about but brothers and sisters we are in Heavenly places and we know Romans chapter 8 I'll just maybe read that that first verse and and how do we get there in in in Christ how do we get into Heavenly places in Christ it's just such a beautiful thing I just had it on my heart so strong the last few weeks I just have to express it and maybe then I can move on to something else but you know Romans chapter 8 verse 1 is is a change of gear from Romans chapter 7 the end of chapter seven it's so easy to get caught up in Romans chapter 7 as as human beings in this flesh condition knowing that we're dealing with the hybrid condition we can get so caught up in looking at what kind of a man am I I never seem to be able to overcome my problems and my issues and these things that just continually seem to Badger me and dog dog me down but you know we just need to just flip the page turn to that next chapter don't give up even though it's a dark night and a hard time in our lives brothers and sisters keep pressing on go to the morning because the sun will rise tomorrow and when you get to Romans chapter 8 verse 1 there is therefore now not in the future and not yesterday right now no condemnation to them that what that are in Christ Jesus that like to crawl up on Daddy's lap that like to read his word and eat his book those people those are the ones who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit don't be looking at the flesh don't look at your flesh don't look at the faults and fail of the years in you don't look at the faults and failures in others I was amazed one time in the world when when I was living in sin I I was in a terrible state and I wasn't afraid to just slam people behind their backs and there was one man he said you know we're all a little bit weird in our own way aren't we and I just thought my goodness he's not even a believer he's got no Christian anything with him but yet here he is saying yeah we are and you know we are God's created us to be that way don't look at the flesh brothers and sisters if you are then you're listening to that other voice in the Garden of Eden that's just trying to give you some reasoning just go back to the word of God and recognize there's no condemnation to those who are not walking after the flesh but those who were walking after the spirit and then brothers and sisters you're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's when you can begin to look around and say wow man I'm not seated in this world I'm not part of this world I'm an alien to this world once upon a time I was an alien to heaven but now I'm an alien to this world I'm just a pilgrim I'm just passing through I'm on my way you know brother Branham he talks about this in in I believe it's in this message uh the believer's position in Christ he talks about having a dry crop the only way that we're going to see the Holy Ghost move in our lives brothers and sisters is for us to line up with the Holy Ghost for us to line up with the word and and how are we going to line up with the Holy Ghost is to line up with the word that's the only way and and how are we going to line up with the word in our day unless God sends a preacher and how is a preacher going to know what to say unless God sends a prophet because he doesn't just send his word to a preacher does he God sends his word to the prophet the prophet is the one that brings the word to the people and that is exactly according to God's word I'm not going into that tonight but brother Brian he talks about this if we're willing to operate within the parameters of God's laws of the universe then we'll see success but if we're trying to do it on our own bring it our own way or listen to someone else's reasoning we're not going to see the success that we want to see he talks about it we and I just love how he uses a real life example we can have a a crop in the ground over here and it could be just burning up in the sun just dry as all get out and unless we see some water in the next little bit it's going to die all of my money and my labor is going for naught and over here on this other side we could have a great Artesian well with way more water than we would ever need over here and brother Bradham talks about in this message he says you could scream at it you could shout at it and say just water my crop you could jump up and down scream and shout and it's not going to do a thing your crop's gonna keep burning up and that water up there is going to keep bubbling over and you're going to be caught in the middle wondering what to do but he says boy if you could ever just understand the laws of gravity if you could ever just understand the laws of God's universe and put together a little bit of reasoning about it and say well if I'm able to get a pipe over there to that water and and just get it in the right angle to allow gravity to bring it down and to go far enough to get to my crop I could probably get enough pressure in there to put a sprinkler on it and allow that crop to get some water he says now you're talking because you're operating through the parameters of God's laws but if we want to try and bring the Holy Ghost to operate in our position if we're not in the right position we're not going to see nothing we're going to come to church we're going to scream and shout we might even pray we might read the word if we're out of our positions brothers and sisters we're just screaming and shouting we're not going to see it happen and our crops are going to burn up I'll just read it I know I improvised a bit I wasn't reading there just for the record brother Bradham says it he says so you can scream and you can cry and you can shout you can run you can speak in tongues you could jump up and down you could sing songs you could preach the gospel but until you work in harmony with the Holy Ghost you'll make yourself hoarse and get nowhere he says right you believe that he says that's right that's a believer's the position of a believer in Christ 1955-0227a I'll call the musicians brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us we have been chosen to be holy and Without Blame Satan's trying to tell us no look at you you haven't made it yet no no look at you you haven't made it to spiritual maturity yet no you're not quite in your position yet it's just not quite happened yet you know what as soon as you say Amen to the word brothers and sisters it's happened and I want to say this he's already said it in his word it's already happened before the foundation of the world the only thing that's going to happen is we're going to realize it we're going to recognize it brother Branham says it when did you get saved was it in that meeting that time that place was it tonight was it somewhere along the way when did you get saved but he brings it to our memory only from a prophet isn't it beautiful you were saved before the foundation of the world you didn't just get saved tonight you just didn't get saved over there and then at that place you just recognized it there it's the same thing with this what we're talking about tonight brothers and sisters is adoption getting to the place where we recognize our position in Christ not even so much as adopted sons and daughters but as the Bride of Jesus Christ where your word is as good as his word where he's going to sit back and say to the people you know what just talk to my wife she's the one who's my representative because whatever she wants is going to make me happy it's not what I want I've already got what I want but I know that when she's happy I'm going to be thrilled it's going to do something so it's going to give me the greatest joy of my life is to see my bride happy to see my wife pleased and satisfied maybe stand with me tonight as we close just recognize remember brothers and sisters your position is in Christ and when you're in Christ there there ain't nothing that can touch you not not even death scares us as Believers when we're in our position in Christ God bless you tonight let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word I thank you Lord Jesus myself for your goodness Lord so many times I wonder how am I ever going to say anything that could help your people the Lord is such an encouragement father I pray that tonight in the words that are spoken would just encourage us Lord to want to try more to want to Lord Jesus just forget about the things of this world and and the problems and situations and just want to go on our knees and crawl up in your lap and just say oh Father speak to me just just one more time lord Jesus allow me to hear your voice in My Heart Lord speak to me in my ears Lord Jesus father I pray that each one of us would have the desire to have a more intimate relationship with you father Lord that when we go home tonight we might want to just say a little bit more of a prayer we might just want to read a little bit more of your word father that when we wake up in the morning tomorrow we would recognize that Lord oh Father some bright morning we're just gonna fly away it's not gonna be any of these problems on this Earth we're gonna go to the wedding supper the marriage supper of the Lamb because we know that your bride is making herself ready every single day father we have so much to get get excited about so much to Rejoice for Lord for what you've done for us to give us the ability to recognize our position in you father thank you for speaking to me thank you for giving me Lord just the encouragement that I need just the way that I need other oh Lord you are so wonderful

together as a body and just father speak to you for Andrew Claussen tonight Lord father knowing that our brother he has suffered with this gout and father it's just continually seeming to bug him father Lord tonight I pray that as a body of Believers we could just unite together father and just rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ that father even now Lord Jesus he would see relief father we know that Lord there was a centurion a gentile father but he recognized Authority and father Lord Jesus just one word from you tonight could change everything father we know that on our own we're not good enough for you to even come to our houses Lord Jesus but father we pray that we could just send the agent of the Holy Ghost over to brother Andrew tonight father Lord that you would just take him up in your arms tonight father that you would just encourage him Lord in a way that maybe he's never been encouraged before Lord oh father I pray that you would just touch our brother he would just raise him up that that gout would leave and and just have no more Authority in his life no more position in his life Lord we thank you we love you tonight we just want to ask that you would go with us now as we go our separate ways rather that you would keep your hand upon each one of us thank you for watching over us Lord Jesus thank you for watching over The Travelers Lord pray that
