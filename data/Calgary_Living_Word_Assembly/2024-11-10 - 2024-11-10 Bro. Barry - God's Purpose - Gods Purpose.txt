you brother there he is thank you Lord we know many times when the doctors say no that's just a opportunity for God to come on the scene we're certainly thankful for that answered prayer if you have your Bibles today I would just like to read a scripture that's probably very familiar maybe a little bit of a different direction but um as we're talking about on Wednesday um I just thought this would it it it I believe requires a little bit of attention so I just want to spend a little bit of time talking about this this and I trust the Lord will bless it in Romans chapter 9 I'd like to start reading with verse 1 Romans chapter 9 says I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were a cursed from Christ for my brethren my Kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises my whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever amen not as though the word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed amen for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a sonen and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even our father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word thank you Lord Jesus that father you came and expressed yourself to this world Lord you chose a people to express yourself through and you chose father through election to see them blinded for our sakes Lord how could we not remember you father not just this weekend but every weekend of Our Lives father every day of our lives every time lord Jesus we open our eyes in the morning father let us remember Lord they were blinded for our sakes Lord those ones who had all of the promises according to the law but Lord you gave it to us father we just ask that you would bless the reading of your word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just want to say God bless you to each one and uh I'm going to start something new I think it's important and forgive me for not really doing it effectively in the past but that's all I can do is say all I can do is go forwards and so I just want to talk about birthdays birthdays are important birthdays are the days that God chose to express each and every one of us on Earth on this side of Eternity and I think it's a it's an important thing that I have uh neglected to really deal with so as I said please forgive me as we go forwards I'm going to mention birthdays and uh I just would like to encourage perhaps we could reach out to one another and just say happy birthday God bless you we have access to all of this information on the uh the app if you had wondered so if if you're interested in seeing the exact days by all means go ahead and take a look last week we had uh three birthdays sister Zoe vard sister Lynn Panetta and sister Kik Salu God bless you all this week we have on the 10th brother Luca Kakui on the 11th we have brother Dodie kikuji on the 11th we have sister Lois odene on the 12th we have sister Jane wuti and on the 14th we have brother Ariel Franklin God richly bless each one is that brother Jerry Carpenter here God bless you brother welcome [Applause] I hope you brought your wife we just have a couple of announcements that we wanted to make as well we have uh what was the Youth Event who that has morphed into uh a financial session with brother Joel Clawson that will be in the basement on the 17th and that will start at 2 o'clock and I believe we have all of the logistics worked out for those people who are able to attend it will be uh definitely beneficial in terms of uh I believe it's investing now and we know brother Ram preaches on investments so it's not outside of the word so don't get nervous it'll be uh well worth it to come and and learn we have brother mvin Panetta he's going to take two services for us on the 17th and on the 24th and uh it's not because I'm leaving it's because he we've been talking about uh something for a long time for well over a year and uh we just felt led to do it now so on the 17th and the 24th of November brother mvin is going to take the services and then on December the 8th we have brother gift maruu will be here and he's a brother that was associate Minister I believe in Saskatoon Tabernacle and uh he actually packed up the family and moved back to Zambia I believe a year ago maybe a little over a year ago and uh he's attending a church in Luca Zambia and his Pastor is brother Ronnie Kisha I believe and that's at Hebron Tabernacle in luaka Zambia so our brother gift will be here on the 8th and uh I'm sure it will be a wonderful time he's back in Canada for a a couple of months I believe so now he's actually doing it the opposite to what he was doing God bless you Sister Mary he was actually uh living in Canada working in Canada and then traveling back to Zambia to minister for a couple of months and now he's living there and traveling back here to minister for a couple of months so it's interesting how it works we know God uh God has a way of doing things and it's always perfect the Remembrance Day weekend is upon us today this weekend I think it's a a wonderful thing to acknowledge and to recognize the reason we have freedom here in this country and I don't want to get political but I think it's amazing I'm just going to say this much I think it's astounding how people want to actually take and make the freedom that we have and turn it into some sort of contentious issue why would we do that why wouldn't we just say it's wonderful to be free and we don't have to protest do we have to protest do we have to try and cause a problem it just doesn't make any sense but it's just I just can't help but think it's exactly what brother bradam taught about how people would come out of denomination come right out of denomination and then in time given Freedom turn around and find themselves right back in bondage again of denomination and not recognize it if we're not careful we'll do that with the freedom we have in this country and I personally think it's already gone back there um but there's nothing we can do about that now we can certainly pray and uh we know we can never do that too much but you know there's a reason why we have the ability to have a free voice and that reason is because people gave their lives people actually picked up arms and went to fight and I wonder how many people today would have the courage to do what they did then how many of us would do that would say I might not ever see you again as a young man how many parents would be willing to part with their 16-year-old children to go fly warplanes to go and storm beaches to go and Fight For Freedom my I just think it's wonderful because it's not that far removed we talk about the children of Israel and their Wars and their battles it's not that far removed where we are today the reason why we're here is because someone fought and died and you know I I know many people who have grandparents who actually were there I can say my grandfather was there he he's got stories about being in in the second world war and they're shocking to hear but it's real and uh it's important to remember it's important to look back and thank the Lord for the freedom that we have it's important to look back and thank the Lord for the freedom not just to live and and work and and conduct ourselves but to have the freedom to worship that's part of our freedom is to have the freedom to worship the way that we feel led to go and the way we feel led to go is just amazing that's totally getting into our topic but you know it's just wonderful I I'm going to get into this a little bit later in the service but I'll just say it now the natural types the spiritual the natural typ types the spiritual and we fought a a a really tremendous battle to to go through the world war so that we could have our freedom now what are we doing without freedom I think is the critical Factor when we actually recognize salvation as Believers what are we doing with that freedom is it just something that we have and now we're a better class of people than many people in this world or are we willing to actually do a little sacrifice and share that that that freedom that we have with those people who are in bondage who really don't know about the freedom we have it's just becoming really uh pertinent to me about the City of Calgary where we live do the people in the city know about a prophet do they know God sent a prophet do they know that God sent a prophet to preach in this city in the 50s my I think it's powerful just want to say God bless you this this weekend and uh if you haven't really thought about it just take the time to remember why we have the freedom here there's a real purpose for it and a reason why we have it and and I just like I said I don't want to get too political but I want to say this it ain't so we can go and protest and say that we're this or we're that you know what we're Christians we're Sinners saved by grace man that's all we are oh my but once we recognize that it causes something to stir inside of us you know I I I'm going to talk today on God's purpose out of uh out of Romans chapter 9 verse 11 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth I just think it's a beautiful beautiful verse and it's going to sort of complement what we're talking about on Wednesdays out of the exposition of the seven Church a the sardan church age we're we're talking about what I spoke on Wednesday how I kind of got into the weeds in the afternoon I was studying this and I started to think my this is way more of a topic that should just be read over and we just go through it mechanically line by line in the exposition of the seven Church ages and we say we finished the sard of seean church age and you know we're going to move on to the next chapter and then before long we're done no I think we need to just pause here I feel really led to talk about this this is something that is very important to a Believer to recognize that God does the work and you know what I want to talk about today is the purpose of God God's purpose and that is really where we live as Believers in the day in which we live right we're we're dealing with everything is happening according to God's purpose there's nothing that's happening in this world that's out of control or by accident there's nothing that happens that's an accident in this world the world would speak that there's accidents oh my you driving in a car and somebody runs into you and you have an accident maybe you're driving home and and somebody is fleeing the police and they hit your vehicle and you have an accident we call them accidents there's nothing that's an accident everything that happens is according to the purpose of God and how we conduct ourselves in those moments is what demonstrates who we are God allows these things to happen but you know I want to say this brothers and sisters I'm going to I'm going to harp on this a little bit today I think it's real important this is a direct quote out of the message and it'll come up a little later you don't have to worry don't get nervous brother about trying to bring it up I'm just going to say it many times here we need to remember this brothers and sisters this is the prophet of God speaking he says I'm not saved today because I can shout many people can shout how many here can shout how many here like to get in service and Shout how many like to get into sports games and Shout you know what we can say I'm saved because I shout brother Bram saysi not saved today because I can shout I'm not Sav because I feel like I'm saved how many people feel saved today you can you can show or you don't have to show many times I'll tell you I don't feel like I'm saved I'm saved why because I've met God's requirements that's the what the prophet said I'm saved because I've met God's conditions of this Bible and I just want to stay there and dwell on that for a little while brothers and sisters I remember my pastor brother Ken he preached on this and he said it we need to know that that's how we know we're saved the devil's going to come around and say look what you did you don't feel like you're saved now nope I don't feel like I'm saved now oh you're not saved so you might as well just go and do it again don't worry about it you already got the condemnation who cares you're already there you might as well just stay there no the believer recognizes it and gets back up again amen and recognizes what the prophet said I'm not saved because I feel like it I'm not saved because of some sort of action that I do no I'm saved because I've met his requirements he said get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins repent and get baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and when you do then you know you've met his requirements and you know sometimes in that treacherous moment I'm going to call it a moment sometimes it's a day sometimes it's a month sometimes it's a year maybe a decade maybe 40 years who knows I'm not going to put it a time frame on that that moment from when you do all of the steps you've repented thoroughly you got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins oh my but there's that little Gap there where you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when do you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when does that happen personally I I believe I know when it happens and I know the devil likes to come and say well you just haven't got it yet because of this and and maybe you don't have it yet because you'll know them by their fruit right what kind of fruit are we experiencing in our lives I want to say this the moment that you desire to earnestly do it with your whole heart you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now some people might say brother Barry that's contentious I don't know how that can be I want to say this how many times do you really genuinely earnestly say I surrender all I surrender all the devil knows it and God knows it when you're sincere and when you're not sincere you're not going to get the gift of the Holy Ghost you're just going to be a church member and unfortunately when you get into that little treacherous spot that I was referring to between my fingers of all places it's just a weird example between going and meeting the requirements and then whether you get the Holy Ghost or not that's where the Devil comes around and just has a field day if you let him but if we can come to the place in our lives where we can simply say I'm not saved because of how I feel I'm not SA Sav because of how I act I'm saved because I met the requirements in this Bible like the prophet said I want to say this when we're willing to go there that changes everything because there's two classes of people in this world this is where we're going to go back to the weeds of Wednesday the Wednesday weeds you know what there's elected and not elected people period in this world there's elected and there's Not Elected and it becomes really treacherous to get into preaching this but I think it's important for us to do and it might take a few services and I'm not going to rush I don't think we should rush I think it's important to recognize because wow the devil is going to come around and say are you elected oh my you did this if you did that you couldn't be elected you would never do that if you were elected we got some examples in the Bible that I think are really important really worth taking a look at just remember brothers and sisters when the Devil comes around and says no you're not not say you know what yes I am because I don't believe the elected would ever not oh let me say it this way I don't believe the non-elect people in this world would ever desire to meet the requirements of the Bible they'll say ah no I've I've I've been baptized my own way I I don't believe that Prophet stuff no I I just can't see it the way that you talk about it brother Barry you know there'll always be an excuse some reason to not go all the way and be completely committed to the word of God but we just need to know that you know what if we have the ability to say hey I desire to meet God according to his conditions there's something special about that that the devil can't do nothing about that is a different thing altogether I had a quote come around on uh this week in in 1965 and I just think it's wonderful because it's it's what I've been preaching for a long time and I think it's important I'm just going to say it this is a prophet verbatim I don't know if I sent this to you it's out of Satan's Eden I heard brother Neville say Satan's Eden 19650 829 I'll let you bring it up I heard brother Neville say this morning I heard brother Neville say this morning I'm GNA stutter for a bit I heard brother Neville say this morning Satan's Eden 1965 I believe it's coming I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why didn't I preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's the action in in you brothers and sisters we can say I'm saved I got I got God sent a prophet I believe the message of the hour all we want we can shout we can preach but what's the action in us how do we conduct ourselves how how do the people that know us the most intimately perceive us when we're behind closed doors do those people say you're a Believer or do those people scratch their head and say there's a mixed signal coming through through here I don't know man what you preach on Sunday is a little bit different than the life you live what you try and show the world around you is just a little bit different than what I observe because that's not the way it should be we should be the same same everywhere we go I preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life it's not an emotion because we can shout because we can preach that don't mean we got the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters it's the life of Jesus Christ it's not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is the person it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart you know what the evidence is going to be you're going to be able to go back to the word of God and say I don't know man everything around me seems to be confusing I'm going through the valley of the shadow of of death even I look around me and I can't see a way out but I know that I've met the requirements of God and that's where he's going to come on the scene but if we're not willing to meet him on his requirements then I don't know we might have a little bit of an issue the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence I don't go to church because I go to church I've been in the message for 40 years for 50 years my parents are in the message we do everything exactly right our whole entire Liv but is the message in you just being in the message ain't enough you've got to have that message inside of you and the message is Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence some people might be saying brother Barry why you shouting why you getting so emotional because I think it's time we just get down to the nitty-gritty of this he says but it's a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age not just something we preach we don't just quote quotes this isn't about just saying what the prophet said it's about living what he taught us it's about going on to meeting Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and when that happens something takes place but it's a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age to Quicken every word of the prophet in our lives it quickens that word we say wow the prophet said it that is something that's incredible I don't understand it but I believe it because it's Christ inside of us the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age right he says watch watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstrations but in action what it does according to the word that's what I want to say today brothers and sisters let's let the word be our barometer as we go forwards and we think about the message of the hour we think about our actions and we think about the life of Jesus Christ coming and manifesting in us are we manifesting the life of Jesus Christ according to the word or are we manifesting the life of Jesus Christ According to some Theory or or some man's Doctrine we know that Jesus came and he said you know what you're you're teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men we don't want to do that that's not what the message is for it's not about dos and don'ts I got thinking about it and you know what we've been called to brothers and sisters we've been called to be Eagles right we have not been called to be legals we have not been called to be legals we can say oh my they eat with unwashed or they do this or they do that have they met the requirements of the Lord according to the word for our day where do we stand man we're called to soar into the heavenlies not be straining at a gat we need to be looking back to scripture here to see the reference I think it's wonderful talking about this this this Romans chapter 9: 11 for the children not being yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth as I talk about this I just have to say it I just can't help but think about it brothers and sisters where did Lazarus stand that day oh my when he was not standing anymore when he was laying in the tomb where did he stand there was nothing that he could do I think Lazarus is one of the greatest examples of election that we could look at in the Bible because there was nothing that he could do he was bound hand and foot his face was covered he was cold we know that in incorruption had set in 72 hours his nose started to sink into his face Lazarus was done for but something happened when that Man from Nazareth came by and you know that Man from Nazareth he didn't come by because people said oh you got to come Lazarus is dead he said oh okay what's for supper right just because you call doesn't mean he's going to jumped to action he's coming in his time sometimes Naturally Speaking it'll look like it's three days too late right oh my don't you know I perish Lord don't you know my condition don't you see the agony and the pain and they tried to call him didn't they they called him master your friend is sick unto death come even the sisters said you know if you would have been here this wouldn't have happened and weren't they right but what did Jesus say this wasn't all about just coming and and doing another healing this is the next level sister this is so that you could see the power of God that I am the resurrection and the life your works of righteousness are filthy rags before me what you need is a real experience with the Jesus Christ and what he did when he got there I love how brother Bram says that that woman says well there's no way that he could have been Divine Jesus couldn't have been Divine because he wept right he's God how could you put God in a box and say God should be a certain way and shouldn't be a certain way how could anybody ever do that the prophet in our day the word for our day said that he was all God yet he was all man and you know when he wept he wept emotion for his brother for his friend because he knew that this was not the way it was supposed to be from the beginning he created man to be Eternal he created man to be God and he could see the corruption that this world had taken on think about the weight that was on this man when he walked up to that tomb when he walked down there to see where his friend was laid he wept the Bible says he wept real tears he was all man he had the emotion in his heart oh my I can't help but think that he was all God at the very same time thinking Adam where did you go Adam but then we had the prophet say that you know they're came in moment what did he do he put his shoulders back that little nazarin put his shoulders back and it was no more man speaking it was God Almighty I am spoken that moment and what did he say he said Lazarus come forth and we know the prophet said something that many people many theologians don't even dial into and that is the fact that if he would have just said come forth he would have called the general Resurrection but what he did was he called specifically by name and I want to say today brothers and sisters if you have heard him call your name you can say that you have met the requirements otherwise you wouldn't be able to hear you wouldn't be able to hear what a prophet said you wouldn't be able to hear at all it would be on deaf ears you'd be like oh Lord would he just shut up and let me go [Laughter] home but if you can hear there's something special turn with me back to uh Genesis chapter 25 Genesis chapter 25 talking about this scripture here as I said I'm not going to rush I'm just going to take some time there's a few different angles that we're going to look at this from and uh today we might only just have one brief overview I just want to uh just want to mention this scripture here in verse 10 of Romans chapter n he just I know I know we turn to Genesis don't get nervous just stay there I just want to throw this in there as we go back Romans 9:10 says not only this but when Rebecca had also had conceived by the one even our father Isaac just the verse before what we're reading for the children not being yet born neither having done any good or evil that the promise of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that cth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated so our scripture here in Genesis chapter 25 verse 21 the story of Isaac and Rebecca and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife verse 21 because she was Barren and the Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived we know that word intreated means that he prayed he intercede interceded and God came on the scene and he's the same yesterday today and forever verse 22 and the children struggled together within her my and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and I think brothers and sisters that is something that we really need to make sure that we do and I know we do preaching to the choir here but maybe there's someone I know myself I can say that I need to inquire of the Lord many times where I just go to acting I just go to thinking I just go to pulling the trigger and doing things maybe I ought to inquire of the Lord first verse 23 and the Lord said unto her the two nations are in thy womb and the two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger and so what I want to get into today is talking about the birthright you know brothers and sisters there's no election without the birthright what the birthright is an example of is election true but the literal life of Jesus Christ in the heart of an elected individual because an elected individual is going to desire the birthright but it's interesting because when we look at this story I want to continue on here reading verse 24 and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb so she went and inquired of the Lord and the lord gave her an answer and told her told her that there's two nations in your womb two people my goodness two classes of people verse 25 and the first came out red all over like a hairy garment and they called his name Esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took a hold on Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was three score years old when she bare them and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and Isaac loved Esau Esau was the Elder Esau was the eldest and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob interesting how this is this story here you know I I I was talking to my wife about this as I was maybe preaching a little before but I was talking about this and I always looked at the story one way one certain way until I really started to look at it through this lens of election as we're we're going today we'll carry on here in verse 29 and Rebecca sorry and Jacob saw pottage and Esau came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee that same red pottage for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom and Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright and Esau said behold I am at the point to die and what prophit shall this Birthright do to me and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his Birthright and I want to say today how many people how many people according to scripture just like this allowed the natural circumstances of life to get in the way of their Birthright we know that brother bradam said it very clearly that Elvis Presley he took and and sold his Birthright for a fleet of Cadillacs amen what what price would we be willing to put on our Birthright today is there a price is there something that would be enough I remember when I was in the world that I would go through some really miserable times and many times in my my head and I just go into crazy story land in brother Barry's head but times I would think you know if I could just do this if I could just do that brothers and sisters there's nothing on this side of Eternity that would come anywhere near the value of our souls because that's really what our soul is in order to have our soul we have to have the birthright but here we have this situation where now Jacob and Esau are acting in the natural course of events a and it's the natural happening and he's so hungry he's going to faint he's going to die and what does he do he's willing to say the words I'll sell my Birthright for some food just to satisfy this natural situation this temporal natural situation in my life I'm willing to sell my Birthright who would say those words what that would mean today is is for one of my sons maybe Isaac being the oldest if I was going to give all of whatever I I have the little bit in this earth that I have my Earthly treasures and maybe any money and anything the name of the family all of the lineage would go to the Eld this son as the birthright and for him to say you know what I don't really care you know maybe Benjamin you can have the birthright if you want it a a as long as I can have some food that you're making because that smells really good what a terrible thing that would be what an insult that would be naturally speaking I I think it's just a terrible thing when we look at this here though we know the prophet said it many times the natural types the spiritual now we can take that and put it off to some other great spiritual Mountain somewhere in in the future or Look Backwards and say well I can see where it did it there but what about us right now today in our estate where we're at where we're living Our lives our families our jobs our careers everything that's going on with us in the moment the natural is typing our spiritual amen whether we want to admit that or accept that or realize that it it's irrelevant it's like saying there's no Gra gra ity the prophet of God said it and that settles it from my perspective but looking at this story here I think it's so interesting how it's just so easy to just pass off the birthright but you know we we can go further and I'm not going to do it today I I think it'll be well worth it if you want to see where I'm getting this from is just continue on and read the next couple of chapters the story we're well familiar with it how it seems like Mama Rebecca took and actually persuaded Jacob to be what brother bradam called a Shyer right we know the story very well how it was time to get the birth right and to add the blessing for the father and the father was going to give the blessing we know Isaac was going to do that and so what did he say he said Esau it's time it's time we need to actually get this going go and get me some of my favorite Venice and I'm going to have my favorite meal we're going to celebrate and when we do we're going to have a real spiritual time and I'm going to give the the spiritual blessing to you Esau and we know that mama got in the way and I had always looked at this from the perspective of Mama being deceitful and causing the son to be deceitful and yes indeed she did and yes indeed he did they they both worked together right to make that happen in a deceitful manner but what I didn't catch what I didn't realize and perhaps I'm the only one that wasn't really realizing this is that she was operating according to the Revelation that God already gave her she wasn't just pulling a fast one she was saying I know what God said to me and that's going to happen Esau is not going to get that blessing today no way not if I can help it the purpose of God the purpose of God this kind of shocked me I I'd never seen it that way before but I thought my my my my God will always have his will come to pass in every one of his elected children's lives there's no way that we'll ever escape that and you know the evidence of it will be our willingness to come according to the word for our day that's what's going to be the evidence we're going to be able to say I met the requirements we're not going to have resistance to it and say well I did most of them but you know I did them all years ago and maybe it was just a little bit different than the way brother Barry's preaching I want to say this is Brother Barry preaching any way different than what the prophet of God said I'll throw that out there and I just want to let it let it let it saturate let us think about that because if it is any way different then we have to have a conversation I want to say this the prophet said that that that we all want another that we ought to have a conversation to say you're preaching the doctrine wrong but if we are preaching according to what the prophet said according to what the truth of the word is have we come and met all of the requirements according to the word for our day because if we haven't I just want to say brothers and sisters it's not too late I don't think it's just brother Barry preaching here I think the Holy Ghost is calling he's still calling one of these days the Rapture is going to go the church will be gone and there'll be people that will say I heard about that I knew it was there but I just couldn't live it I want to say to you nobody can live it even those people that go in the Rapture the only difference is they recognized they could never live it and they just gave it all to God and every single day they tried to die out to themselves to say Lord not not me but you you live out through me looking back to the scriptural reference so I just think it's beautiful to see I I had always thought that the they were just deceivers deceivers trying to mess with that Birthright but no no no it was exactly according to the will of God God's purpose was being fulfilled you know talking about the birthright it's about the lineage and and typically it's the eldest male that takes the family name and and usually assumes the family wealth that's the old school way of doing things and maybe we do things a lot differently today and I'm not going to say one way or the other it's it's you know it's up to us to do what we need to do what we feel led to do but that birth rate is what we're referring to and in this particular discussion that's kind of the way it was it was exactly about the lineage of the name for the family and they would take all of the wealth and that was what was supposed to happen the Elder was supposed to get it but we know that she went and had a discussion with God and God said the Elder Shall Serve the younger and because of that Revelation she acted in her life and you know we have the order of birth we've talked about that we have the two people Isaac and Rebecca they're just trying to live their best lives they're trying to do everything they can according to the word according to the Revelation they've been given in in their lives but I just think it's wonderful how we have Isaac he went and he entreated the Lord he prayed and he asked and he acknowledged the Lord and and the Lord honored his prayer and we know that she had twins they struggled and and Rebecca she even went and inquired of the Lord and I think that's just such a beautiful beautiful description to see both of them Desiring to inquire of the Lord I think that it would help us a lot if we would be willing to do that if we would be willing to inquire of the Lord and I know most of us if not all of us have and do so it's a it's a tremendo tremendous thing for us to be able to do that Rebecca she wasn't deceitful not spiritually she had revelation according to the flesh she was this got me thinking how sometimes we can look at people we can look at situations and we can say that's deceitful that's not according to the will of God how do we know how do we know that's not according to the will of God I I know many times we'll say well it's not according to the word of God it's not according to the message of the hour and you know there comes times where we can say we have to say hey I can't explain it I don't understand understand it but I trust God because nothing's happening without him first allowing it to happen but Rebecca she was deceitful and she taught her son to be deceitful according to the flesh but she had already had this conversation with God and God spoke back to her she had this Revelation in her heart and I think it's wonderful when a mama gets a revelation in her heart ain't nobody going to talk her out of it especially when it becomes about her kids ain't nobody going to touch that Revelation in the heart of a Mama it's amazing you know out of demonology in the religious realm brother bradam talks about a little bit about election excuse me kind of going back to our discussion you know yeah I'll read this then we'll go back and read out of the exposition of the seven Church ages 1953 069 demonology in the religious realm I think it's so it's amazing isn't it that there would even be a a sermon title called demonology where in the religious realm what Bram he says in paragraph 63 there's a wheat field out here there's creepers nettle balls stink weed everything else in it is that right but now in there there's wheat there's wheat in that field we talked about it on Wednesday how you can have the what looks like the wheat and you put it in your hands it looks exactly like wheat but you look and there's no wheat there's no seeds it's all chaff but brother Ram here he's talking about there's a wheat field out here there's creepers nettle balls stink wheat everything else in it is that right but now in there there's wheat now the rain comes off upon the Earth to water it now we know that he's referring directly to I believe it's Romans chapter 6 I could be wrong with that I think it's Romans chapter 6 um anyways he's talking about the rain falling on the just and the unjust but now in there there's the wheat now upon the rain now the rain comes off upon the Earth to water it now what's the rain for not to water the nettle ball and and what we're talking about with the rain brothers and sisters is the latter rain call it the latter rain the former rain and the latter rain the the planting rain the Harvest rain call it the word of God for our day call it the anointing of the Holy Ghost in the age in which we live that's what we're talking about we're talking about this rain now what's the rain for not to water the nettle ball now watch and pay attention not to water the creeper not to water the unbelievers and the make Believers but to water the wheat to water the Believers to water the very elect of God that's what this word has been brought to this Earth for now watch and pay attention not to the water and Creeper the rain is sent for the wheat but the nettle ball and the wheed is just as thirsty as the wheat is the Believers and the unbelievers they're going to be drinking it up man they're going to be saying amen and drinking it up but you know what it's not up to us to try and discern who's who it's up to us to serve God according to the full Revelation in which he's given us not to water the creeper the rain is sent for the wheat but the nettle ball and the weed is just as thirsty as the wheat is and the same rain that falls on the wheat falls on the weed and the little old weed will stand right straight up like that happy and rejoicing just as much as the little wheat will stand up and stand himself up he says but by their fruits ye shall know them there you are see now the same Holy Spirit can bless a hypocrite I say Lord don't let me be a hypocrite that knocks some of you Armenians out but that's the truth the ones that believe it's all works I have tremendous Works in my life and I have my whole life and you could look at my parents Works my parents works are tremendous look what my parents have done for the message you know what that that's got nothing to do with it what are we doing in our lives right now he says that knocks some of you Armenians out but that's the truth that's the truth being taught Holiness which I believe in Holiness too but just because we're born into a message family doesn't mean that we automatically get the blessing but the Same Spirit the rain falls on the just and the unjust but by their fruits you shall know them just let that word fall down upon them let the word continually fall down upon them let the word continually bless them and and pour upon them he says if I look out here and go to get a wheat I get wheat but the weeds is all bound up and they live on the same rain that fell for the wheat and the rain was not sent for the weeds it was sent for the wheat but the rain being in the field the wheat being weeds being in the wheat field got just as much benefit out of the rain as the rest of them did and the same rain that made the wheat live made the weed live all things in the natural types the spiritual all things in the natural types the spiritual as we're teaching he says There It Is demonology demons impersonating Christianity yet with the blessing yet with a blessing my he says that's not skin milk Brethren if you can take it see now it's the truth and this just makes me shudder as I read it I think wow my so this is where we got that quote that I started with so so I'm I'm not saved today because I can shout I'm I'm I'm saved not because I feel like I'm saved I'm saved because I met God's conditions of this Bible Jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but as passed from Death unto life I believe that that's right and them conditions I am safe because God said so not because Church said so not because I said so not because Pastor said so or parents said so because God said so and that's where we need to live brothers and sisters we need to recognize it's all what he's done this is the purpose of God coming to pass in our lives giving him the opport Unity to do it he says if you told me you're safe because somebody said a rushing Mighty Wind hit me in the face that's wonderful but I want to know where that rushing Mighty Wind come from before it hit you in the face see now what kind of a life are you going to live after that rushing Mighty Wind has hit you see what kind of a life are we going to live brothers and sisters after that rain falls on the just after it falls on our life after we say Amen to the message of the hour we believe God said a prophet I've got the message Hallelujah I'm saved been baptized Justified Sanctified oh my filled with the Holy Ghost and live a little bit different than what the word says a little bit different than what the prophet says there's something wrong amen there's something wrong with that but boy when we line up with what the prophet says there's something right now don't get me wrong brothers and sisters we're going to stumble we're going to fall the difference between the believer ver and the unbeliever or the make believer is the believer is going to get back up again and say my Lord I'm sorry maybe a brother and sister my I'm sorry maybe a husband and a wife I'm sorry but when we start to see oh my I'm not sorry I got nothing to be sorry for what's that guy harping about why is he barking again talking like this over and over again when we start to see that we know there's something wrong but boy if we've had a wind hit us in the face my if if if he told me you're Sav because somebody said a rushing Mighty Wind hit me in the face that's wonderful but I want to know where that rushing Mighty Wind come from before it hit me in the face see now what kind of a life are you going to live after that rushing Mighty Wind hit you see see it's it's by your fruit you're known so demons can work right amongst Christians very important I'm I'm brothers and sisters some people might be getting upset with me right about now and I'm I I want to say I'd like to say I'm sorry but this is the word of God he he referenced the church not churches in the sardan church age we heard it on Wednesday because he said that the two would be so close that they would deceive the very elected those two twine Vines are intertwined and they're going to be that way all the way to the very end that's where we live and I think it's important to call it out it's important to understand exactly who we are and where we're standing today I'm not Sav today because I can shout now brother Barry is shouting so praise the Lord I'm not trying to demonstrate that I'm actually saved by shouting I'm just trying to preach I feel inspired I'm not saved today because I can shout I'm saved because I feel I'm not saved because I feel like it I'm saved because I've met the conditions of his Bible I know myself in my own life I can say I've met the conditions of his Bible and as soon as I was willing to do that with a genuine heart something changed inside me brothers and sisters I became a new creature in Christ and I believe we can all say that am I I I I I believe that every single one of us can say amen I know what it's like to not be the old man there came a time where there was a change in the birthright and you know the word of God says it I don't know if we'll get to it today but the word of God says there came a time where Esau when he came back from hunting maybe I'll just talk about the little story for a second we know that there was the deceitful part dad said Esau go get go get the venison that I love we're going to have a a ceremony and I'm going to pass off the birthright to you go go go get that Venison and cook it up just the way that daddy likes it and he said sure as an obedient son he went and Mama heard it and she said uhoh I better intercede I better do something about this God told me this isn't the way it's going to be and I can see what's coming around the corner here so I better do do something it's time to act and because she had that Revelation she did act and that's where the natural deceitfulness comes out and we can see it but we know what happened is they put the the clothes of Esau on him and they put the animal skin on his arm so he was there that hairy could you imagine how hairy that would be really to put the skin of an animal with hair with fur from a goat on your arm and that's pretty hairy he's a pretty hairy guy can't even imagine how hairy that would be but anyways they did that and he went in and he actually got the blessing from Daddy right but there came a time where Esau came back Jacob had already got in there as the Shifty one pulling the birthright he got in there got the blessing and he got out Mama helped him do it but there came a time where Esau came back and and we know that Isaac said to him who's here who is this and he said what do you mean who's this it's it's Esau the one you sent out I'm back now I've got the venison I I brought it for you Daddy this is what we talked about and we know it came out no no it's all already done sorry buddy you missed it man I've already blessed someone else I don't know who it was but I can only imagine he understood at that moment what was going on Isaac knew in his heart but the birthright had already been passed on and you know it's interesting because the natural types of spiritual yeah that's what we heard we understand that we all believe that the natural types of spiritual we know that Esau willingly gave up the birthright he he gave it up willingly just to satisfy this Earthly flesh and if we're not careful we will do the same thing I say Lord help me I do not want to pass up my Birthright for this flesh I want to say let this flesh perish so that I can hang on to that Birthright with all of my might but we know there came a time where Esau recognized what happened he recognized his error the word of God says that he came and sought that Birthright with tears and it was too late because that blessing had already been passed on the natural types the spiritual brothers and sisters if you look that up in the message it pops up nine times there's nine results the natural types the spiritual and I just think that it's real important I I felt led to just talk about this a little bit in this light that that we need to recognize the natural types the spiritual how are we living our lives today because how we're living our lives today whether we want to agree with it or not it's irrelevant argue with the Prophet The Prophet said the natural typees the spiritual how's our natural lives I want us to examine our natural lives how are they because they type our spiritual lives whether we want to accept it or agree or not it's irrelevant the prophet said it the natural types the spiritual nine times it comes up exactly that way today we're talking about election and the purpose of God God's purpose in our lives the purpose of God and you know election is a New Covenant word it's not in the Old Testament it's only in the New Testament it only pops up in the Bible after the resurrection I think that's so beautiful you know it's strongs g589 long l l e l i don't know if I'm saying it probably not saying it right but it's from 1586 which means divine selection abstract or concretely chosen election so it's selection Chosen and whether it's abstract or concrete it's it's election it's it's divine intervention it's the Divine selection we couldn't choose to hear the voice of a Vindicated prophet I I would never have wanted to hear the voice of a Vindicated Prophet I remember hearing there was a Vindicated prophet in the land who could tell the secrets of people's hearts men's hearts in my natural flesh I remember very well vividly saying there ain't no way I'm ever going to get anywhere near that guy because he'll probably be able to discern my heart and who I am for real behind closed doors that nobody seems to know except for me I know I'm a skunk I never want to do that I would never have wanted to go and see a Prophet but you know what something on the inside of the inside said maybe you just want to take another look just take another look but you know in our scripture today Romans 9:1 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth talking about the purpose of God specifically the purpose of God according to elect in Romans chapter 9 I just think it brings out the thought it gives us the the ability to consider this you know what there's people that are not even born yet they've never done good or evil but God's purpose in their lives has already been determined and some people want to take it and say well because of that I can just live however I want to be and if I'm elected then I'm going to be there and I don't have to worry about it I'm just going to eat and drink and be merry for tomorrow I die because whatever it's too hard to live and it is too hard to live as human beings will never be able to live this but when Jesus comes into our heart oh my it changes everything it changes everything for us we become a new creature in Christ Jesus but you know because of election his elected will always come in line with the word always come in line with the word and that is the Difference Maker the elect will say maybe I don't understand it maybe I can't comprehend it but something on the inside just believes it and when we believe it we begin to live it we don't just say I believe it and then live a different life but talking about the purpose of God I did a little search on this in the in the in the Bible and uh you know we have our scripture in Romans 9:1 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth sorry this is on Election not not the purpose of God Romans 11:5 even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace I just can't help but think about the election of Grace in the heart of a Believer the election of Grace is God coming and giving us the ability to have ears to hear what the spirit says unto the church the election of Grace the ability to hear that God sent a prophet and not only hear that God sent a prophet but what did that Prophet say that Prophet said oh repent and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no a trinitarian baptism ain't enough you haven't even been baptized at all is what the prophet said and when we hear that we say oh my really wow that's heavy but I want to take a look at it closer because if there is a furtherance to the word of God through a Vindicated prophet in the day in which we live I want to come in line with that word that is a sign of election but when we say oh my I've been baptized in the name of the father and the son of the Holy Ghost I've been baptized already well the prophet in our day said you haven't been baptized at all if that's how you've been baptized and I know myself that's where I was I was baptized in the name of the father and name of the son name of the Holy Ghost who's the father what's his name who's the son what's his name who's the Holy Ghost what's his name we know the Lord Jesus Christ he came and identified himself so that we could know who we're talking about I just want to read from the sardian church age in this book it's paragraph 111 it says now if language means anything at all we must admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus in John 13:18 yet he was not clean John 1310 to11 Judas was also given to Jesus by the Father John 17:12 Let It Be noted here that the choosing and giving is the exact parallel as in the illustration of Moses Pharaoh Jacob and Esau for though Esau and Pharaoh were both forn they were predestinated to wrath it's the sardian church age brother they were predestinated to wrath while the end of Moses and Jacob was glorified my first Peter 2: 8-9 you know I just can't help but think if we if we can really see that we're elected if we can really see that we've been chosen if we can really see that I can't imagine that we would ever come to a worship service ever again in our lives and just be quiet when we really recognize what God has done for us we just get our channels clogged up we get into this Human Condition and we get busy living and working and all the pressures of life and we go to church and then we go home and then we fellowship and then we go to work and and we do I'm talking because I've been there brothers and sisters some might say well brother Barry you don't even work you don't even hold a job you know what I know what it means to hold a job I know what it means to have a business I know what it means to work 16-hour days every single day I know that I know what it means to come to church with ch clogged up channels brothers and sisters oh my I'm not even going to say it as a deacon at the door you know sometimes being a deacon at the door I probably needed more more prayer than anyone I'm going to be honest with you brothers and sisters just because we have a position it doesn't mean nothing we need to recognize that we're elected when we recognize we're elected we're going to give due benevolence to the Lord when we come into his house we're going to acknowledge what he did for us according to election my they were predestined to wrath while the end of Moses and Jacob was glorification 1 Peter 2:8-9 a shows both being reprobates and elect even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed so if we see someone stumbling at the word brothers and sisters we don't want to throw off on them that could be their their calling that could be what their chosen to do but ye brothers and sisters are a chosen generation Judas was numbered with the 12 and actually had a part with them in the ministry previous to Pentecost my just because we have a position it don't mean nothing just because we can preach this gospel brothers and sisters it don't mean nothing does our life line up do we line up with this word are we willing to Humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord are we willing to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God if we're not I want to say there's something wrong Romans 11:5 even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace God's grace to us understanding that it ain't our works it's not by works of righteousness brothers and sisters it's just by his grace alone that's the only reason we can understand God sent a prophet that's the only reason that we can hear what the spirit says that's the only reason we are who we are it's because of his grace unto us and that causes something to stir inside of our hearts Romans 117 what then Israel hath not obtained to that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded my the election hath a obtained it and the rest were blinded who's the election it's not it's not in the book brother it's a scripture it's a scripture Romans 11:7 Romans 11:28 as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching election they are beloved for the father's sakes my that's where I I just want to say this I can't I can't believe anyone would ever throw off on the Jews ever especially someone who would be of the faith if someone is a Believer we should understand that they have been called to be blinded they've been called to be blinded why so that we could be recipients of this Grace the election of Grace it's not because of what we've done it's because he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be the ones today in 1 Thessalonians 4 knowing Brethren beloved your election of God there's a discussion about election we'll get further into this as we go maybe not today but in the future for sure second Peter 1 verse 10 wherefore the rather Brethren wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling in ction sure for if you do these things you shall never fall I I I just want to turn over there for a second if you don't mind let's turn to Second Peter got a couple minutes left before we have to wind it down did I say four second Peter chapter 1 forgive me we know we just read verse 10 wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall I just want to talk about these things what are these things I think it's really important because these things are really only for the elected there's a lot of people that want these things in their life and they'll work really hard to have these things and from an outwardly perspective will demonstrate a lot of these things but you know what the true evidence is is the ability to come according to the word for our day if we just go back to Let's just read verse one of second Peter chapter 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue not because of anything we've done because of what he's done wherefore are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and we know that there's a couple different types of lust I'm not going to go too far into that it's not just a a fleshly lust it's the lust of the mind we can have that as well but he goes on to talk here in verse 5 and he says beside this giving all diligence all diligence brothers and sisters add to your faith virtue strength and add to your strength knowledge and to your knowledge Temperance or or or the ability to just withhold withstand not actually overindulge to your knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience not just fly off the handle but be patient and wait for the promise of God to come to pass in our lives patience and to patience godliness we know that's Holiness and to to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and we know that this is the statue of the perfect man the statute of the perfect man this is the pyramid that we typically so often see and I love how brother mvin brought it as one pyramid now it's not separate with the Holy Ghost on top the two have become one the the twain are one right the husband and and wife there is a new life there's there's there's something that's happened and they have become intimate but you know talking about these things if they be in us and abound then we should never be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ and and will never fall brothers and sisters if we have these things in our lives but what are these things it's not like the pyramid it's not a pyramid scheme right don't think of it in terms of a pyramid scheme you're not just going to climb up on one and then onto the other onto Faith you're going to add virtue and virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance and patience and godliness and and no no no no no get the Holy Ghost in your life when you get the Holy Ghost in your life all of those things come into your life with that life of the Holy Ghost and there will be things along the way that you'll start to see wow I've got patience where I never had patience before whoa I've got strength to go on my knees and pray where I never used to be able to have that strength and go and take time to pray my goodness I've got got knowledge about the word of God where did that come from people will say to you how do you know about the word of God so much oh my because someone else inside of me knows about that word that that that someone else is the word and that's why I have that but Temperance my goodness the things that I just couldn't resist in the past I can leave them alone I can say you know what I can just maybe have one Burger instead of four right there's something holding me back something giving me the the restraint I've never eaten four burgers at once just for the record I might look like it but I don't think I ever could but you know these things in our lives if we can see these in our lives brothers and sisters and abound they'll make you that you shall NE never be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and this I can't help but think brothers and sisters this ain't talking about a rank unbeliever this is talking about someone that maybe has just taken a little bit of a detour someone who is a Believer that's just become maybe maybe a little unsure of their position but he that lath these things is blind cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged of his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence be diligent about it take care is what my Bible says diligence means take care to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall I just can't help but think that's the most beautiful thought there's something that's going to cause me to never fall did you ever think of it that way there's something that's going to cause us to never fall we'll be able to see it naturally in our lives I will never fall wow I just want to say this get the Holy Ghost in your life and you'll see all of these things manifest you can't have the Holy Ghost in your life and not see these things manifest it's impossible so you know brothers and sisters I'll call the musicians because I don't want to take us too long here today we look at all these things we talk about the elected we haven't even really scratched the surface of election I believe and I don't know if we'll ever be able to do it justice or I will be able to do it justice there's probably someone that could who is a very good teacher but speaking about election there might be someone here today who is wondering who is elected then who is it that would be the truly elected because we know that the word of God would be so close so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible but it can't it will never be able to deceive the very elected but who is the truly elected I'm so thankful that we had a prophet in our day come and and identify who the elected are the elected are the ones that have the Holy Ghost because you will never get the Holy Ghost in your life If You're Not Elected that's just not going to happen you'll be able to live under the anointing of the Holy Ghost you'll be able to come to a church service and Thrive off of the anointing in the church service and say my it was so good to be in his presence and that's what everyone says even the elected say that it's so good to be in his presence but you know brothers and sisters we don't just come and experience his presence here we take his presence with us we bring his presence into the sanctuary it's not about coming to experience it it's about being the experience my who is the elected then it's the people who come according to his word and his word alone and the word for our day the prophet's word the word that God gave a prophet that God Vindicated a prophet that word that's going to be the identification of who the elected is then even if it takes our hide off even if we say brother I just can't hardly stand that that hurts I know I've got these things in my life you know what I got things in my life brothers and sisters I'm not claiming to be anyone I'm I'm a sinner saved by grace and if I don't guard my weak spots I've got problems we need to guard our weaknesses if we're not willing to do that the devil's going to have a field day with us but who is the elected the people who are willing to come solely according to his word and if we have something where we hear we need correction in our lives the elected is going to say amen amen forgive me Lord I I just want to be right with you I don't want to try and pretend I don't want to have to ever go down to the river we know brother Bram gives that story about the man standing there at the river he goes down and he knows he needs to have that token in his hand and if he doesn't have that token in his hand he's going to have trouble crossing the river that day there's coming a time where we're we're potentially going to go by the way of the Grave are we going to know where we're going to go we don't want to have any trouble then we've heard it said many times there's a time in our lives where our body starts to separate Body Spirit and soul and when that happens what's going to happen it's going to be too late to make a decision it's going to be too late to cry out to God that's why we've got the opportunity now just to say like Mary be it unto me according to Thy Word and you know unfortunately unfortunately for this whole entire world there isn't going to be any excuses God's only going to judge the World by his word maybe stand with me as we close today he's going to judge the World by his word that's it that is the measuring stick that's how he's going to judge the World by his word and there isn't going to be any excuses we're not going to be able to say there's there's this or that or the other amen it's not by anything that I've done it's by his grace alone that I can meet his requirements you know I'm going to close with one quote did you get the quotes the email this morning brother it's the last one 1963 I am the resurrection and life brother bramy says so is it my friends we are here this afternoon to see what death has done to our brother it's got to be German gerti not germanized gered forgive me we might belong to church we might be fine people we might be a good character in the neighborhood a fine father mother son daughter but unless we are deratization it's finished it speaks to us of these things nature calls out day by day and the sun rises and sets the moon and stars come out the same thing everything in nature revolves in one thing death burial Resurrection death burial Resurrection every day of our life something is to testify to us death burial Resurrection we walk over the top of it many times let's not do that let's not why it was set here and the world set in order like that it's for eternal life that we know and seeing seeing upon seeds that they're not gerti and serve the purpose of God it cannot rise neither will We rise amen though we be good people though we be church members though we be Gallant neighbors find people educated smart science tells us what has been science can't give us life life belongs to God alone and he's the only one handles life so we must come to that place to be jti by the word of God or we will never rise again our life is totally finished when we finish this life here that does it all together if we're not gerti by the word of God or by the life of God brothers and sisters it can't be anything that a church does for us can't be anything that our parents do for us it's got to be what he does for us I just can't help but think about this one scripture and I'm going to close 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 23 it says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy the very God of Peace will look after all of it in your body in your mind in your soul all of it he will sanctify you holy every part of you and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ can you imagine that brothers and sisters God he is the one who answers prayers and this is a prayer of this saint and he said I pray God your your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ you had someone praying for you before the foundation of the world you had someone praying for you before you even express before we even a thought in our parents' Minds someone was praying for us and this next verse is the critical Factor brothers and sisters Faithful Is He that calleth you who will also do it as much as we want to do it there ain't nothing that we can ever do it's not us it's him all the way God bless you today let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to us Lord father help us to recognize the election that you have set in place Lord Jesus father that we can't judge anyone else but ourselves Lord and father that we would take our
