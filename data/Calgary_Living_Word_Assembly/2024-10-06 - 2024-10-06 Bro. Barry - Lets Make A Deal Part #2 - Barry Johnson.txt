whatever felt good that's what they did and today we know it's the exact same thing amen Lord Jesus wisdom has taken the place of faith and father we just this morning are so thankful that there are a few people in this world Lord Jesus that don't esteem wisdom greater than Faith Lord Jesus we esteem your faith greater than any symptom any sickness any situation that we might encounter in this world father and we thank you for that Faith because we know it's not ours it's truly your faith Lord Jesus living out through us oh Father it's not the faith of God it's not the faith in God I mean it's the faith of God it's your very Faith living out through your children and father this morning we just want to unite together around our brother Paul my father-in-law Lord Jesus Our Song leader and our brother father we pray he needs a touch from you and we just thank you Lord Jesus you've done it once before for our brother many times before for our brother and one more time lord Jesus we

outcome Lord Jesus we just ask for each and every request that was made known unto you today by the way of an uplift hand in the Defiance of gravity Lord in the Defiance of the situation Lord Jesus we pray that you would just meet the need sovereignly father whether it's at the preaching of the word or whether it's a natural circumstance father maybe a thought maybe a song who knows know but you father we just want to commit each need into your hands For Your Glory we ask for traveling mercies Lord for those who are already traveling from this weekend father those who might be away from this assembly father those who will be traveling tomorrow maybe tonight father we all rely upon you for traveling mercies and father we just want to commit each life into your hands into your safety we just love you Lord and we're so thankful for your grace and your tender Mercy to each and every one of us Lord we just want want to commit the rest of this service now into your hands For Your Glory we just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles this morning I just like to read from 2 Kings chapter 18 amen thank you musicians once again for bringing of your sacred portion amen it's truly wonderful to have so many gifts in the body Second Kings chapter 18 I just felt led to go into a part two of what we were talking about the last time um the story of Hezekiah out of 2 Kings chapter 18 and uh we titled it let's make a deal I just like to start reading with verse 31 of 2 Kings chapter 18 amen here we have the king of Assyria sending his Messengers to God's anointed he says hearken not to Hezekiah for thus saith the king of Assyria make an agreement with me by and present and come out to me then eat ye every man of his own Vine and every one of his own fig tree and drink ye everyone the Waters of his sistern until I come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and Vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye may live and not die remember this is the enemy speaking here and hearken not unto to Hezekiah when he persuade you saying the Lord will deliver us let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we're so thankful for your word we know that it's the only thing that will remain you have said that heavens and earth will pass away but only your word will remain amen so father we just ask that we could take of this word this morning and eat it eat it up just like the word explains that we should do father that we might prophesy again we just ask now that you would bless the reading of your word father and bless every word that's spoken today father bless every thought that's thought Lord Jesus let all of us come together in one mind in one Accord and just give you the opportunity father to speak to us and through us that when we leave this building today Father we will not be the same we just commit the service now into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just like to welcome every single one here this morning amen we have Travelers I see from Edmonton and we have travelers from Saskatchewan uh unexpected travelers from Saskatchewan God bless you brother Moses and family it's wonderful to see you we have uh my Saskatchewan Manitoba Arizona BC Washington I I don't know how many other uh provinces or States forgive me if we've missed any we certainly are thankful to see everyone we had a tremendous weekend of Fellowship for the singles this weekend at our place and uh I just um we just are overwhelmed with how incredible it it actually was so our thoughts were perhaps maybe it would be wonderful if you know 15 or 20 people would show interest in you know maybe coming to fellowship at our house and I believe we had over 40 people interested that took of their time and their resources to buy plane tickets and to drive all night to come to fellowship with us and it's it's not taken lightly it's truly humbling um just a couple of announcements uh we have the Men's breakfast in Edmonton we'll be going to for those who have responded on the poll uh that's coming up this weekend we'll go up Friday night and then come back Saturday afternoon and we have the Youth Event happening on the the 20th of October as well just wanted to bring the results of the church officer vote we had this week and uh the deacons who have been voted in are brother Emanuel Brother Don and brother Peter brother Emanuel sarpong Brother Don snow brother Peter Boi Manu uh the treasurer is brother mvin Panetta the trustees are brother Henry Henry dick and brother Paul clawen who is in surgery this morning God bless you each one for stepping forward to bring of your sacred portion to the body of Christ it is not uh just magic that things happen in the church it's not just because God just lets it happen it's because people have a burden on their heart and they step forward according to the word and uh we're certainly thankful for everyone's efforts brother Toby odoo he actually is still a deacon we didn't put him on the uh on the ballot this year because he has decided to step back from the office of Deacon so that he can engage in his ministry in a greater capacity he feels LED of the Lord to do that and uh he did talk to me two years ago about that and uh we're certainly thankful for the leadership of the Lord in our brother's life and for the gift in his life so we just want to continue to pray for brother Toby he said he'll serve until the beginning of the new year in the capacity of Deacons so if anybody has a leadership from the Lord to actually stand in that office we certainly have a need for that so by all means let one of us know and we can certainly go from there are you happy this morning um I wasn't going to do this but I'm just going to do this um bear with me for a second here I just wanted to let everyone know uh this morning I just felt led to do it so here we go uh what we did this this weekend was we just took from Isaiah chapter 40 for those people who are wondering about the the singles weekend on Friday night we had a devotion at our house and uh everyone was there and it was just a wonderful time you know sometimes in our lives we can we can start to age and and maybe grow and desire something from the Lord and it can seem like the Lord doesn't really answer us it sometimes feels like his ears are stopped to our prayers and and that life continues on and and we just keep trudging forward believing the Lord but see l in our heart we feel maybe a little bit down that God hasn't actually heard our prayers and he's not actually answering our prayers so we took from Isaiah chapter 40 and I just wanted to try and encourage each and every one that came this morning just or or on Friday this weekend the the singles just to admonish them that the reason they're there is because of the standard they hold in their lives because they believe they are not giving in to the easy way out they're waiting upon the Lord Lord and so I took from Isaiah chapter 40 I started with verse 26 and and you don't have to bring it up I'll just read it quickly because this is not the sermon I just wanted to to bring this for everyone lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth this is the god that we serve Why sayth thou oh Jacob and speakest oh Israel my way is hid from the Lord he doesn't know what's going on in my life he's not listening to me no he's listening he knows exactly what's going on in our lives my way is hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over from my God hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youth shall faint and be wary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run not be weary they shall walk and not faint and you know I I don't know if I talked about it on Friday but it just really hit my heart when I was studying this that you know even the youth shall faint and be weary the ones who aren't actually skillful in the word of God the ones that still require milk but the ones who are into strong meat that really truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost who understand who they are when brother Bram talks about adoption he says you know all about it you know all about who you are you know all about your position you know all about the word in your day when we're adopted we're not youths and we don't faint and become weary and the young men shall utterly fall how will the young men utterly fall they'll just try and do it their own way but they that wait upon the Lord they're the ones that will renew their strength amen I just want to encourage each and every one of us let's wait upon the Lord he will renew our strength we had a tremendous time this weekend and Lord willing um it seems like we'll potentially do it again and uh I think we're really excited about that we have learned a few things and and met a bunch of people and it's just a wonderful time to get together as Believers getting into our our lesson today our our study today talking about the story in 2 Kings chapter 18 uh the story of Hezekiah and and how the king of Assyria came up against him and said make excuse me make an agreement with me by a present show me a token give me something let me know that you actually are willing to make a deal with me and last week week when we talked about this we we brought it out and said that's just exactly what the devil wants us to do is to make a concession in our lives to just make a deal with them and if we can make a deal with the devil then he'll he'll he'll give unto us all the desires of our heart he'll make our way easy isn't it interesting that here we have this enemy King sending his Messengers to the people of Israel saying just don't listen to this guy who's a religious crank over here the the the pastor of your church or whatever it is the king of your land just don't listen to him don't hearken to his voice just listen to me because I can actually take you into your own land I can start to give you the stuff and and I just want to turn back over if you will this morning to the book of numbers and and just do a little comparison with this verse here in in 2 Kings chapter 18 where he says uh make an agreement with me and and specifically of verse 32 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land in Numbers chapter 14 we have the uh spies going out into the land over into the promised land they were right up to the the River Jordan the children of Israel were brought out from bondage they were brought out from the Pharaoh 430 years of task Masters doing whatever they wanted to with the wives and the daughters and the sons of all of the children of Israel according to scripture but we know that they went over into to the promised land and and they actually 12 of them went over and 10 of them said we can't do it we're not going to be able to do it even though they went over and they spied out the land and they actually brought back fruit of the land they brought back evidence one cluster of grapes that it took two men to carry out of Numbers Chapter 13 sorry not 14 they brought the proom pomegranates and the figs and verse 24 of chapter 13 says the place was called The Brook eshkol because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from then and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of parin Unto Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land they brought them and showed them the fruit of the land they gave them the evidence that land is real it's a real land and it has real fruit and they told him and said we came unto the land whether thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it and isn't that interesting that I just wanted to point that out in Numbers Chapter 13 this is what this king of the of the Assyrians is trying to actually bring he's trying to give them something that sounds remotely similar to what they've already been promised and and it's interesting because weren't they already in their Promised Land weren't they already there in the land that floweth with milk and honey so why would the king come and try and tell them that they could actually go somewhere else who would want to leave the promised land when you're there who would want to stop having the Holy Ghost in their life when you have the Holy Ghost in your life because today when we talk about this we're talking about having the baptism of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ himself living out through us and the fruit of that land is the life that we live the fruit of the spirit that we bear on our branches for people to partake of the fruit of the spirit isn't even for us to enjoy we don't pick fruit off our own branches and enjoy I don't pick Joy off of myself and say I'm going to have some Joy I decide I want to have joy and I display joy and the world around me sees that brother Barry's got joy and remember the joy of the Lord not our joy the joy of the Lord is what it's our strength if we want to be strong and stand in this age then we better get some joy and there's no better way to get joy than to encourage ourselves in the the word we know that's what David did David got down David was a man David he suffered some stuff that God had to get out of his life but he encouraged himself by the word is what the word says out of 1963 God doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him talking about positions and understanding where we are in in our in maybe our church and maybe in our families but I want to say even more so in the promised land but the Bram he says if you're working for a man find out what your duties is you wouldn't he in his message he talks about it you wouldn't be working for a man and then just go and sit down and not do any work for him and wait for him to come and tell you you would actually go to him and find out what what should I do for you what's what's the job description because I want to actually be in my position for you he says if you're working for a man find out when what your duties is and then if your life is on the earth the earth here then we should go to the one who put us here and Lord what would you have me to do they that wait upon the Lord right what would you have me to do what what must I do why am I here if it's to be a housewife I love how brother brownon writes this a dishwasher if it's to be whatever God wants you to do then to do that the very best that you know how to do it now I'm just going to throw this out there and people might get upset but that's okay being a housewife doesn't mean that you're a dishwasher that's brother Barry's opinion I'll say it that way you know what you could be a dishwasher for an employe employment I was a dishwasher for employment I did that that was my first job when I really needed to actually earn some money it was a job that I got and uh just because you're a housewife doesn't mean you're a dishwasher it doesn't mean that you're a doormat when you're a housewife you're the Bride of the king of the house just like We The Kings of the house are the Bride of Jesus Christ and just like he treats us the grace and the tender mercy and love that he gives us we give to our bride she's not just a dishwasher but brother bradam in context here is saying if she's if you're a housewife a dishwasher just be whatever God wants you to do and you know it just brings to mind a story that I was reading while I was laid up here I was going through one of the books of uh brother Bram and uh I just heard the story that uh sister ma talked about talking to her daughter her daughter said mom why do you like ironing so much she ironed everything apparently everything she ironed everything and one day she finally said to her daughter you know you know what I don't like ironing I hate ironing I have never liked ironing but I got a revelation one day that if I'm serving my husband I'm actually serving God and the way that I actually do my own duties the way I conduct myself is what I'll be responsible for God it was interesting though because she did Iron so much but she didn't like it she hated it but what an example to show her daughter and what a a reckoning it must have been for her daughter to say what you don't like iron I thought you loved ironing because he ironed everything no no I got a revelation about my position about doing everything that I do according to the best I can no matter how little no matter how little it is brother bradam says You must do it you say well the trouble of it is each one of us wants to do the next man's job right sometimes we get the wives wanting to do the husband's job and don't get me wrong I don't want to be a dishwasher I've done it I know what it's like but I still do it once in a while but I don't want to be in the position of mom in my house that's not the right way we need to do the best we can with every single position we have we don't want to take each other's positions I just got a few quotes to kind of get us going here and then we're going to really get into it here out of God don't call a man to judgment without first warning him paragraph 33 brother Bram says it's hard if you don't you have to depend on the holy spirit because the Bible is wrote in riddle that's why brothers and sisters we can't just say I believe God sent a prophet and woohoo it's great I'm saved what's going to happen is we think we're saved and we're going to slip back into the traditions of this world that we live in maybe our forefathers maybe our genetics maybe an outside influence outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've already received the mark of the beast that's why brother brandham says as parents it's vital for us to apply the token to our family amen I've got it in my notes I'm jumping ahead here but you know what entitles us to the Token brothers and sisters the full obedience to the entire word of God entitles us to the Token not just coming to a message church not just having message parents not just saying I know God sent a prophet and I've been to Jeffersonville we've got to go on to Crossing Jordan to where that fruit lies to where all of the promises are on the other side and that means we've got to dial to ourselves but if we're not willing to do that we're never going to see the fruit we're going to say where's all the Miracles Where's God it's just tradition you can't sit down and read it the Bible like a newspaper brother Bram says it's hid yes sir how would you ever justify God when he told Moses up there said now you don't make any engraven images and that's what he said right don't make any engraven images in his Commandments don't you make anything like heaven any Angel anything else don't make any engraven images And yet on the same day told him to mold two angels out of brass and put them right here at the mercy seat amen how do you explain that many people want to look at it with common knowledge and say well that's contradictory isn't it but if you read between the lines if you allow the Holy Spirit to interpret this word you can see it's God's will he says you have to know God and his nature before you can understand his word that's why we have to go on to having a true relationship with Jesus Christ if we're not willing to do that we're not going to see him he's not going to just come and smack us one day and say Tada here I am we have to be willing to have a relationship with him and he will reveal himself he says he has to he has the key to that word himself he is the only one that can handle it and open it and he's the only one that has to reveal it we can preach the word all we want we can try and encourage each other all we want but we all every single one of us have to go on to having a new birth experience and you know brother Bram talks about it we can get into a situation where maybe the new birth is just a little bit not not cool maybe the the new birth is just a little bit exposing maybe we can feel like people will look at us and judge us if we have a new birth experience brother bradam says it very clearly that a new birth any birth is messy we're we're having kittens at our house this weekend and some of the people got to see them and we've had them for the last little while but you know a a birth is a messy experience it's not pleasant it's not and it's the same thing with the new birth but for us to judge people about how they actually die out to themselves this flesh doesn't want to die if anybody here has ever had the new birth you know exactly what I'm talking about if you haven't had the new birth I strongly recommend it it will change everything this Bible will become a new book the message will become a brand new message brother bradam in the same message God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him he says and that's the way it is with people we all the body of Christ has got to be in their position in harmony not just in their position in harmony he says see and then we can look around and see what time of day it is see then the world's looking to see what it is see but they're watching you remember brothers and sisters we can preach all we want we can say we're Christians all we want but the world around us our families the church body they're watching us and that preach pre is the loudest sermon ever the life that we live he says but they're watching you and if you're just a little hairspring a mainspring or whatever you are you do the best job you can at that now because we have a responsibility that we've got to answer to God someday for every man that come on the face of the Earth has to answer to God for a responsibility my I say Lord help me I want to be ready on that day when he calls me home my and to many of us a stewardship we have to answer for this responsibility is a stewardship that's been committed to us by God he says I don't care what it is as I said a few moments ago a housewife then be a genuine housewife that's right excuse me if it's to be a farmer be a genuine farmer whatever it is that God has put you to do you got a stewardship to that you've got to answer for to God for because it takes all these things to do it it's just so beautiful to think about if we can just do the very best we can and then we reach the end our limit we can't go any farther we can't do any better and we call upon the name of the Lord to help us I guarantee you he's going to take us higher and farther he's going to take us to places we never even imagined that we would go to but it takes surrender we've got to be willing to surrender to him you know just going over this before Israel uh our lesson in uh 2 Kings chapter 18 Israel had succumbed to the traditional worship of the heathens in the land even though they were in the promised land they were already in the land that floweth with milk and honey they have already gone over and conquered the land all of the old Fighters brother Bram talks about that if you want to see something you could look it up the old fighters of the land the ones that wanted to bicker and try and contest and argue and the chors and the daans all those guys were long gone they were now in the promised land they were where they should have been to receive the full blessing of God they were in the land where David said how long you going to let that giant down their boast against the armies of the Living God don't you know this is our Promised Land we can actually stand up and defend ourselves and God will fight the battles am that's where they were but what happened was everything was good for them their fridges were full of food their bank accounts were full they had lots of garments they had nice cars everything in their lives were good they were in the promised land what happened was they started to look around and the Heathen worship started to creep in it started to come into the Church of the Living God and God wasn't happy with it at all we'll go back and we'll read I think it's in chapter 17 it is in chapter 17 17 God wasn't happy with them and you know it was through the prophet that he reminded them and it's no different today brothers and sisters we can take the message of the hour and it will actually encourage us and build us up and give us encouragement because we can say amen I know I'm in the promised land and I'm trying my best I fail all the time but I always have the desire to get back up again and say Amen thank you Lord for sending a prophet let me take that word and make it all about about my life or we can say that message is searing that message is just controlling people just take the message and try and manipulate people with it one of those two ways is what's going to happen in our lives there's no neutral ground we cannot live in this world and just remain neutral especially spiritually speaking we're either living or we're dying we're growing or we're shrinking That's the Law of this universe but the prophet of God in this day came around and told them get back in line with the word don't get up mixed up with the heathens don't get all bent out of shape and and forget about God but that's what they did you know how they did it the interesting thing is what we're going to study today here God reminded the people how they were once under bondage in in Egypt and he reminded them you can go back and read it for the sake of time I I don't really want to read too much of it today but God God reminded the people that he had delivered them out of bondage how they were there for 430 years and and and how he did it with a mighty hand he hardened Pharaoh's heart and how he destroyed all of the enemies once they were out all they had to do was follow the word of the Lord and where was the word of the Lord it was in the prophet Moses all they had to do was listen to him and do exactly what he said and if they did that they actually went forward and they conquered all of the enemies in the land even right up till they came to K Kesh barnea and Kadesh barnea was a defining moment in the lives of the children of Israel wasn't it it was at kadish barnea that they had the ability to say Amen everything that our forefathers fought for all the people that died the enemies that died to get us to come this far all of those lives are not in vain because we know that God is more than able to take us across but there was 10 of them that said no I don't know I don't know don't you know there's Giants in the land oh I we're just like grasshoppers brothers and sisters there's Giants spiritually speaking in our land and they're boasting saying that we're sick they're boasting saying that we've got a detached retina they're boasting saying that our marriages are in trouble they're boasting saying all manner of things in our lives but we have the ability to say I know exactly who I am and I know exactly where I stand and I don't have to take that from any giant because I know that God God is more than able and willing to deal with this giant for me but God reminded these people how they were once under bondage and how they had been delivered and how all their enemies were destroyed but the reason they got to where they are is because of their [Music] Disobedience and it's just it's sad because really it's obedience that entitles us to the Token it's obedience to the entire word of God and it's not is saying the entire word we've got the written word it's black and white and we can read between the lines here we've got the entire word and I obey the word I I just can't really deal with the prophet bit it's a bit much it's a bit heavy it's a bit carnal because it's a man and you know we live in a modern age it's a bit much but the entire word is the word of God through the prophet amen and the word of God through the prophet will only point back to the entire word of God he won't bring his own word we have a prophet in our day and full obedience to the entire word of God that He gave in print and through the prophet entitles us to the token and one iota of a deviation from that brothers and sisters gives us the opportunity to actually not really receive the token in our lives and you know unfortunately I believe it and I'm sure that every one of us do this is the day and age where we need to make sure that it's absolutely cut and dried there's no room for deviation here there's no saying that we can just make a hybrid religion and say it's okay to do a little bit of this and it's okay to do a little bit of that and God will still bless me I could still come to church and be blessed sure enough you can but do you have the token because if you don't have the token there's a [Music] problem full obedience to the entire word of God entitles us to the Token it's an exact quote what is the token brothers and sisters today in our our age it's the Holy Ghost and you know sometimes it's a little uncomfortable to talk about the Holy Ghost but those people who know me know that that's pretty much all I like to talk about because without the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we're not going to understand this word of God as we read in Isaiah we've got to have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it makes the Bible a new book it makes the message a new message and most importantly of all it makes us a new creature amen in Christ Jesus because we're not just getting into Christ Jesus we're actually getting Christ Jesus into us and it becomes his Spirit living out through us to the world around us the token is the Holy Ghost how do you get it you get it by a new birth the dying out of ourselves not just saying that I believe am and therefore I'm saved no no that's a BAP good Baptist Doctrine but understanding that we have got to actually make a change in our lives and how how can we ever live the life of the token in our lives nobody nobody can there's not one of us that could ever live the life of the message I'm sure brother art would be one who' be able to testify about that the amount of years that you've been around the message of the hour have you ever been able to live the message it's got to be God's life living it out through us how could you serve God that many years with that many Winds of doctrine that many different things that come around and Shake us you get the life of Jesus Christ the token and you're able to with stand all of the enemies that come our way but God allowed Israel because of their Disobedience to be carried off into another land and he allowed Judah to become Under Siege and and this is where it leads into our story this morning now we're going to really begin the story I I am sorry I just wanted to lay a bit of a background with it sort of a recap from last week God allowed Israel to be carried off why because they were disobedient if we become disobedient children to the word of God in our day then he will allow us to be carried off we can never ever think that we're going to be able to just dabble a little bit with something that's unclean and and think it's going to be okay we I I don't know what the the quote is there I think there's a song that you know if we sin a little bit it's going to take us a whole lot farther than we ever intended for it to take us and it's going to cost us a whole lot more than we ever thought we would ever be able to pay or would have to pay for it but just like Israel was carried off so will we be carried off if we are not careful and God allowed Judah the remaining country the remaining Believers to become Under Siege now so they weren't carried off but they had all of the enemy surrounding them and there was no way for them to escape there was nothing that they could do a and why was it though if we could just look in in Kings 2 Kings chapter 17 I think it's important just to maybe dwell on this for a little bit just to to look at it we'll start with verse 24 of 2 Kings chapter 17 talking about where the the people came from and and how he placed them verse 24 and the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from Kua and from Ava and from hamath and from sepharim and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel and they possessed Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof why on Earth were their enemy people living in the promised land in the position where the children of Israel should have been and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not the Lord they didn't know the Lord they didn't care therefore the Lord sent Lions among them which slew some of them wherefor they spake to the king of Assyria saying the Nations which thou Hast removed and placed in the cities of Samaria know not the manner of God of the land therefore he hath sent lines among them and and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of the god of the land why wouldn't they know the manner of the god of the land this was the promised land and the king of Assyria commanded what did he say saying carry tither one of the priests whom he brought from then and let them go and dwell there and let him teach the manner of the god of the land get one of the these priests back here and and get them preaching get them teaching preaching Saves The Sinner but we know teaching positionally places them and we needed a little bit of that then then one of the priests who they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in bethl and taught them how they should fear the lord but here's the problem how be it every nation made gods of their own and put them in houses of the high places which the Samaritan had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt and the men of Babylon made Sako benoth and the men of C made Negel and the man of hamath made Ashima and the aites made nibas and tarac and the saphar vites burnt their children in fire to adriam MC and Anam Al the gods of searam and you know it's been said I think it might even be in the Bible I could be wrong but uh I remember hearing it said preached it's probably in the message that when they were doing that passing their children their seed through the fire to to Molech that's who it really was the god of Molech uh uh they're passing their children throwing their children they literally put their children on the arms of this Idol at their babies and let the babies roll off the hands Into the Fire and you know what was said is that they had the music playing and the drums beating and all of this stuff happening in the background and what they did was they actually made the sounds louder so they could overcome the screams of the children as they died could you imagine parents doing that it doesn't make any sense but you know what brothers and sisters we look at it naturally and say it's terrible and it surely is oh Lord have mercy that nobody on Earth would do that now but I want to say as Believers of this message if we let down the bars in our own homes as parents we're letting our children potentially have the opportunity to pass from our hands Into the Fire and if we're not careful maybe we'll just turn up the music a little louder and just drown out the screams of our children we don't want to do that we want to make sure that we're presenting the cleancut word of God according to the messenger for our age without excuses if it takes our own hide off that's what we need isn't it goes on in verse 32 so they feared the Lord they feared the Lord and made unto themselves of the lowest of them Priests of the high places oh my which sanri s sacrifice for them in the houses of the high places verse 33 they feared the Lord and served their own Gods brothers and sisters let us not fear the lord say we believe the message of the hour and serve other gods this ain't no time to play church this ain't no time to be getting caught up in the left hand or the right hand we know that Israel is in our homeland we know the whole world now is gathering around Israel we can see the sign of the times we know exactly where we are brothers and sisters the prophet said that it's later than you think we're 60 years down the road where do we stand today this is no time to play Church they feared the Lord and served their own Gods after the manner of the Nations whom They Carried Away from then unto this day they do after the Lord unto this day they do after the former manners they fear not the Lord neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law and Commandments which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob whom he named Israel this just about put me on the floor when I was reading this they feared the Lord but they made unto themselves their own religion they feared the Lord but they serve the other gods I just wonder brothers and sisters today if any of us myself included have ever feared the Lord and served another God because if we're doing that we're taking away the blessing in our lives we're going to find ourselves getting carried away by the king of Assyria to a place that we don't want to go to we'll find ourselves in a position where we won't even be able to worship the way we want to because we're in a position that we allowed ourselves to get to isn't it interesting though that God in this situation in chapter 17 here God he'll never be without a witness will he he even took the king of the enemy and said we're we're getting attacked with lions in here we we better we better actually call one of those priests in here not because we want to see them succeed and worship God and have the token in their life and have successful marriages and families and and to see them just Excel and and live the best life they ever could no no just so we can save our hide there's Lions coming in and eating people up so we better get one of those priests in here and have a hlink preacher and just get some some word of God going on so we're safe right that's not the way God does it but he still allowed it to happen he still allowed the ministry to come in and help them amen I think it's beautiful that's the God we serve but you know even in this situation God did not leave his people he didn't leave his people for the sake of his name without a representation here we have King Hezekiah there in 2 Kings chapter 18 going a little bit forwards now in 2 Kings 18 verse1 it says now it came to pass in the third year of HOSA son of ela king of Israel that Hezekiah the son of ahaz King of Judah began to Reign 2 and5 years years old was he when he began to Reign and he reigned 20 and9 years in Jerusalem his mother name also was Abby the daughter of Zachariah this was the one right in the middle where this verse applies from the king before and the King after and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord I say Lord help me Lord help us to do that which is right in the sight of the Lord according to all that David his father did and what did he do remember they feared the Lord but they had their own Gods right this King came in now at 25 years old we talked about this last time I just think it's so good I I can totally talk about it again what did he do he removed the high places and break the images and cut down the Groves and break in pieces the Brazen serpent that Moses had made he completely made a mess of everything that they had going on imagine the pers ution he must have got just like the two the two spies with the other 10 Elders of the church that were there they said no no no we can't do that we're we're just grasshoppers look at the natural circumstances there's no way we could take that Promised Land but the two of them because they were another Spirit they said you know what we're more than able God himself is going to do it for us we can't do it we just need to follow him and trust him he said he give it to us he brought us this far didn't we make it this far isn't that fruit of the land my goodness here we have this King Hezekiah and he just thrashed their religion he thrashed it cut it down and brought it right back to the word of God right back to the word of the Prophet right back to the message of the hour he remove the high places break the images cut down the Groves and break in pieces the Brazen serpent that Moses had made why did he break that BRAC and serpent For unto those days the children of Israel took what was given given by God to help them and they Twisted it and manipulated it and began to make it their religion again we're going to take what God has given and just pervert it it's the way of the devil we'll take the the message of the hour we'll take the theory and we'll just pervert it just a little bit and we'll wind up with a a hybrid religion and there ain't no hybrid about this religion it will never become hybridized but the children of Israel they took this thing this good thing and they actually perverted it but God didn't leave his people forsaken his word says that he'll never leave us or forsake us I just think it's so beautiful if we turn over to chapter 19 Hezekiah he heard the boast of the great king he understood what the king had said you know if you just make an agreement with us if you'll just listen to us if you'll just hearken to us because we're stronger naturally we're stronger everyone is surrounded you can't get away from us you might as well just make a league with us and let us lead you into the greener pastures and we'll give you a land that's sort of flowing with milk and honey not realizing that this is their land but it's God who is rich in Mercy will not leave his word unattended he will always have a representation on earth in every single age in every single situation and so he has Hezekiah here on the ground in chapter 19 and it came to pass when King Hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the Scribe and the Elders of the priest covered with sackcloth in total humility covered in sackcloth to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos and they said unto him it's just beautiful isn't it they went right to the prophet right they didn't go to a pastor they didn't go to a preacher they didn't go to a Ministry they didn't go to their parents they didn't go anywhere else they went right to what the prophet said what is the prophet going to tell us he went unto him thus sayith Hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to birth and there was not strength to bring forth and we talked a little bit about this last time I think it's probably good just to make a little bit of a point of it we can come to the place where we are just on the brink of getting into that new birth but just not have the strength to be able to push ourselves all the way through and see that new birth manifest in our lives just like the children of Israel coming up to the Jordan River to Kadesh barnea and saying you know what it's all right here we're we're just about ready to have the new birth but oh there's just not enough strength because there's Giants on the other side don't look at the natural situations brothers and sisters don't wait for a miracle to come our way for God to show us that he loves us he says he loves us in his word that means he loves us thank you Lord we've got to be willing to take him at his word amen Hezekiah going into the house of the Lord going into the prophet in verse four it may be well it it may be the Lord thy God will hear all the words of R Shaka RAB Shaka remember remember the bad guy that we talked about last week this is the messenger from the king of Assyria it may be that the Lord God will hear all the words of this guy whom the king Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the Living God a Goliath standing in the promised land thinking he's got any power attraction my and will reprove The Words which the Lord thy God hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left and remember this guy he was bringing word to the people in in Judah telling them thus saith the great king thus saith the great king and the people were trying hard not to listen but they were getting nervous because they kept hearing thus saith the great king and it was an uncertain sound and we know the prophet preaches a a message like that we don't want to hear an uncertain sound we want to hear a certain sound and you know what the certain sound is that they were're longing to hear is exactly the same thing that we long to hear thus sayith the Lord and we know they heard it so the Servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah they came to the prophet the servants were looking at the natural situations but they came to the prophet and Isaiah said unto them verse six thus shall ye say to your master thus saith the Lord not thus sayth the great king thus saith the Lord be not afraid of The Words which thou Hast heard which Hast the Servants of the kinging of Assyria have blasphemed me I love it because right there brothers and sisters he's taking it and he's making it personal against himself they have blasphemed against me not against you you got everything to do with it but it's all about me verse seven behold I will send a blast upon him and he shall you shall hear a rumor I was thinking a nuclear bomb maybe a catapult with something really explosive on it and fiery something some kind of a blast brothers and sisters rumors are dangerous things and shall return to his own land and I will cause him to Fall by the sword of his own land so RAB RAB Shaka returned and found the king of Assyria Waring against libna for he had not had heard that he was departed from lakes and when he heard say of triath the king of Ethiopia behold he has come out to fight against thee he sent Messengers again unto Hezekiah saying thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah the king of Judah saying let not thy God in whom thou trust us deceive Thee the devil's not afraid to come around and quote the word of God just like he was in the Garden of Eden it was only one word off and we know that it would be so close it would deceive the very elected if it were possible what's the difference how is it not possible with the very elected the very elected go on to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost some people live under the anointing of the Holy Ghost where they come to service and it's a great service and they can see maybe signs and wonders and they can hear good preaching and they feel encouraged and then Monday morning rolls around and they fall flat on their face again and they say I just can't live it the only reason you can't live it is because you haven't experienced it don't just take a service don't just take service or or special meetings or Camp experiences it's got to be the true indwelling of the Holy Ghost in your life and when that happens brothers and sisters it becomes spiritually speaking autopilot alls we do is surrender to him and his word and he drives we're not his co-pilot he's not our co-pilot he's our God he is the Mighty God I think it's so beautiful this story is just amazing verse 11 beh behold thou Hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered is this guy really going to save you this God this one that hezekiah's preaching about you might as well not listen to him his where where they're going with it just jump down to verse 14 and we talked about this last week it's just so good we got to do it again verse 14 says and Hezekiah received the letters of the hand of The Messengers he got the word he got the doctor's report he got the argument from the spouse he got the problem with the children who've gone Wayward he understood the situation he was manifesting before him and Hezekiah received the letter in the hand of The Messengers and read it and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord we talked about this last week we need to take the situations in our lives and know where to go they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength if we try and find a natural solution for a spiritual problem brothers and sisters the devil's got us duped we will never solve a spiritual problem with a natural solution the world wants us to try and live with it through medication through psychology but not according to the word of the Living God Amen no way the king of Assyria the True Believers they're going to take their problems and spread them out before the Lord the prayer meeting on Thursday night is not going to be too much for their schedule they're going to go up to the house house of the Lord and lay their problems out before him because they know that he is alive and Hezekiah verse1 15 prayed before the Lord and said oh Lord God of Israel oh Lord God of the Church of the Living God I want to say this morning which dwelleth between the cherubims Thou Art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou Hast made Heaven and Earth remember we talked about this a little while ago sometimes we need to remember the Lord's Prayer the disciples said teach us how to pray Lord Master Rabbi tell us how you want us to speak to you we need to remember that one once in a while how to speak to him to think about it we need to speak like Hezekiah spoke unto him my verse 16 Lord bow down thine ear and hear Open Lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of s cherub which hath sent him to reproach not the children of Israel to reproach the Living God and I think that's really maybe a key to where we stand today brothers and sisters is to remember when the Devil comes around with his boasts in our lives he's not coming around boasting against us he wants us to believe that he's coming around boasting against us he's coming around and boasting against God and we just need to go Lord he's coming around to boast against you Lord bow down thine ear and hear and open Lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of Sienna cherub which hath sent him to reproach the Living God of a truth Lord the kings of Assyria have destroyed the Nations and their lands of a truth Lord these are the facts yes this is what's going on and it's real and it's true and have cast their gods Into the Fire for were no Gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone and therefore they have destroyed them now therefore oh Lord Our God I beseech thee that thou save us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God even thou only isn't it beautiful this next verse I know I'm repeating a lot from a lot from last week praise the Lord then Isaiah the son of Amos sent to Hezekiah saying thus saith the Lord God of Israel the sweetest words ever heard in the ears of a mortal human I can only imagine in that moment hey the sweetest words you could ever desire to hear thus saith the Lord concerning you thus saith the Lord of Israel that which thou Hast prayed to me against Sienna cherub the king of Assyria I have heard so beautiful so amazing what a mighty God we serve it's just such a beautiful thing amen and you know what the prophet did when Hezekiah went Hezekiah went to the Lord not the prophet Hezekiah went to the Lord himself and and what did he do he took the word of the Prophet to the Lord he didn't take his own words he did he prayed but but he took his own words and the prophet's word which is actually the word of God and he brought it back to the Lord in his prayer he reminded him that he is the Lord and that he is more than able to deliver them and he's just looking for that same thing in our lives today brothers and sisters that kind of surrender in our lives and I can guarantee you if we're willing to do that we'll hear him say I have heard heard thy prayer amen many times in our lives the devil will come around and make his boast I bet we could ask every one of us and every single one of us would be able to say that I've experienced it this week the devil's come around and made his boast he knows me he knows my DNA he knows my physical makeup he thinks he knows my mental makeup he probably knows a lot more about it than I do because of the genealogies behind me and this natural state that I live in but you know I don't trust in him amen so when he comes around to make his boast I I don't trust in him I trust in the Lord am I trust in the word of God I trust in the message of the hour I'm willing to esteem that greater than any one of the circumstances that I encounter in my life I'm not willing to hearken to a devil that's going to come around and say do this do that think about this look at that go over here go over there blah blah blah all of that is just garbage from the devil and we don't have to tolerate it brothers and sisters we don't have to hearken to it we don't have to give him a second of our time we can simply dismiss him you know we talked about a little earlier I told you I jumped ahead but I'm getting into my notes here we've got Numbers Chapter 13 and 14 the children of Israel they had evidence that there was a land flowing with milk and honey they had the proof right right before them but many of them were more willing to actually go after the natural circumstances than actually believing the word of God in their moment believing that that moment was actually in the eyes and the ears of the Lord that the Lord was well aware of their circumstance and their situation the devil wants us to believe that nobody has ever gone through what you're going through right now the stuff that I'm going through in my mind and my heart nobody ever deserves to know about it because no one has ever gone through it like this and if anybody ever heard or understood what I'm actually experiencing in my life right now they would say that I'm an unbeliever and maybe a heretic and maybe they wouldn't want to associate with me anymore that's all the devil you're a son and daughter of the most high God when you start hearing that kind of talk just recognize who it is and put them to flight amen they that wait upon the Lord will renew their strength there is evidence there is evidence brothers and sisters and I can promise you if you looking for evidence get in the word get in the word of God and when your time comes for for the test you'll actually see the fruit of the land you'll see in the experience that this is a living God that you serve when the devil wants to come around and try and Shake our faith we'll be able to say uhuh ain't happening here out of 1963 God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him brother Bram he says paragraph 43 when you plead anything to God you got to be reason for it it's just like this scripture that I so often refer to if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but you believe that what you've said will come to pass now you can have what you said now that's all alt together controlled on motive and objective see or it won't happen see and I want to say this brothers and sisters if we're not seeing the results of God in our lives maybe according to the way we believe that they should be according to the word of God if we're not witnessing those results I want to ask the question and and it's just a question I don't want any answers I want us to just think about these words I I take this in my own heart and think about it as I say it is there anything in our life that we can change that will cause us to line up with this word a little better because if there is then that means we got something stopping us from seeing the manifestation the full manifestation of this power in our lives but when we're willing to just say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word just like Mary said then we're going to see the results he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the Keystone verse of the message he is the same yesterday today and forever this is the God we serve he said it's controlled on motive and objective I've got prayers for a brand new Ferrari Lord I need a Ferrari I can see what that does for my image oh yeah people like it when people have Ferraris when you pull up to a stoplight and you rev that engine and people can hear it and they look and they say man that's different than everything else around look at that guy he must be rich my is my motive correct you could hear a whole bunch of different things in there if you're listening there's a lust of the flesh there's a pride of life there's all these different things going on is that where we're living no do we need to have a new suit of clothes do we need to have a new car do we need to have a new house say Amen brother have we got the right motive and objective according to the message of the hour I I can say this I I think it's beautiful I would say that's God speaking right there out of the mouth of babes brother bradam says you just can't go out here here that's where many of us make so many mistakes and I can tell you brother and sister I'm not saying this from a Pious position behind a Pulpit I'm preaching to me I've done it out of the wrong motive many times you just can't go out here that's where many of us makes many mistakes it's it's going out and say now I'll show you I got faith to do this now you're wrong to begin with God don't give you gifts just to play with God won't be mocked we can't wave our little wand and say just I can do this and God's going to do his thing you know it's not going to happen it won't work sometimes I I don't know I can only be honest brothers and sisters I'm just going to be me once upon a time I saw this little thing I trust that maybe it will help somebody the only reason I'm saying it is not because it's not to it's almost to my shame but I'm just going to say it many times I think we can actually behave this way as message Believers and I sayl help me I watched this little clip of a show when I was a kid it was called I don't know what it was called it's a game show and it gets to a showdown in in the game show and to my shame as a Believer I watched just this little clip I didn't watch the whole thing I don't subscribe to it but I saw this thing and right at the end when it was the most critical point of the game and this woman was there and she had the opportunity to win I don't know a few thousand dollars like big deal and and everything was set to start in this game and what happened blew my mind as a Believer it shocked me to my core because here we have this game show Hollywood it's all whatever and and they're just about to The Showdown and now we're going to start okay are you ready and she says no no no just wait just wait just wait to the host to the game show host just hold on a second and he's like really what like what could be so important that youd want to stop this and she just says holy spirit activate Holy Spirit activate and she started doing this and and before long everyone in the studio the game show host everyone was getting into their groove let's activate the Holy Spirit and I just stood back and I thought you know is that what we do sometimes as Believers we think that we can just do something to cause God to move according to our desire we need to be saying Lord not my will but thy will be done I don't want my will I want your will because you know best you've got all things under your control but it shocked me and you know I just have to liken it to the same thing as the prophet saying something told him to bend around and pick up that pack of cigarettes in the woods and he preached that message the smoking man's taste right not that's not what it's called it's the thinking man's filter right or smoking man's taste and are we willing to actually filter all of the things through this word of God it's a tremendous message but it shocked me to think that people would actually think that we can just do some kind of an act and suddenly God's coming on the scene to do something for us he's going to help us win a game show my if that's all we're doing with God then then we got serious problems out of the same message paragraph 60 God don't call a man to judgment without first warning him he says remember God is like always in threes like father son Holy Ghost justification baptism sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost so forth he's in threes now God is that message of repentance to the church nominal not the bride the bride's well beyond just repentance God is that message of repentance to the church nominal gods in that message of Divine Healing to the church Pentecostal the ones seen the the outpouring of the Holy Ghost the isusa Street Revival right the the Pentecostals but he takes it further I think it's so good we don't want to live in the Pentecostal Realms do we we had a prophet say that we're not living in the Pentecostal age or the Leo Dean age we living in the bride age 60 years ago where are we at today Divine heals to the church Pentecostal gods in the message to the bride see so we find out that all of them calling one to this this to that and to that to that God calling the church out of the world the calling the church into the denominational Church into Pentecost and calling out calling the bride out of Pentecost see we're not just interested in seeing signs and wonders we're not just interested in having a a good musical show and our hearts feel energized because we went to church we're interested in recognizing Who We Are The Bride of Jesus Christ there's no greater calling in this universe another quote I hope it's okay actually I'm going to go back to the message here the Bible I mean I just think it's so good verse 35 of 2 Kings chapter 19 actually we'll just go to 32 start at 32 2 Kings 19:32 says therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an AR there nor come before it with Shield nor cast cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the Lord hallelujah and I just want to say this brothers and sisters this applies to our congregations this applies to our homes our marriages this applies to our families amen this applies to us this applies to us as individuals in our lives in our spiritual walk when the Devil comes around and tries to tell us you made this mistake now you've actually gone so far you can't come back or look at what you've done look at what you thought look at what you looked at blah blah blah when you start to hear those thoughts just go and read this and put yourself in this in this verse here for I will defend this city to save it not to lose it to save it for my own sake and for my servant David's sake and it came to pass that night that the the angel of the Lord went out and smoted in the camp of the Assyrians 14 score 5,000 that's 185,000 people and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses this is the same God that we serve brothers and sisters when our Our Lives feel like we're under siege let's go to prayer remember it wasn't I'm going to bring the quote it wasn't the prophet prayer that saved the the people was it I started to think about this as I was studying it it was not the prophet's prayer sometimes we can get caught up in a situation where we want to put it off on the prophet what did the prophet say and sure enough we should do that but that's not enough to give us a relationship with him the prophet came to tell us go on to Christ if we're willing to do that he's willing to defend even if we're not willing ourselves that doesn't change the fact that he's still willing to defend what a mighty God we serveu out of 1952 0716 thou knowest all things it was not the prophet's prayer just think about this brothers and sisters brother Ram he says now if we can see what Jesus was in the New Testament then we'll see what Jesus is working amongst us in the last days is that right now not altogether Jesus working in me he works in you just the same as he works in me what this is the prophet does he work the same in us just the same as he works in him my I haven't seen that in my life the reason I'm saying that is I think it's important for us to recognize he's trying to encourage us to recognize it's not him it's him he works in you just the same as he works in me anybody that's born again dot dot dot I may able may be able to see visions and you may not but that doesn't mean that he's not with you brothers and sisters take courage if you can't see Visions take courage maybe we can't have a prayer line and see person after person after person healed going on rejoicing that doesn't mean anything people can be healed today and die a Lost Sinner moral remember people could be healed at Beatles concerts don't let a sign or wonder be our sticking point let the word of God do it for us he works in you just the same as he works in me anybody that's born again I may be able to see Visions you may not but that doesn't mean he's not with you he's with you just the same he was just the same with Hezekiah as he was with us Isaiah he was just the same Hezekiah was the one who got the blessing Isaiah took the word you know when I was reading this and studying I just thought you know isn't that exactly right about the prophet he lived his whole life fought his whole ministry didn't he with that gastro intestinal thing in his stomach here and some of the doctors tried to tell him it was his heart and he had that Vision that told him don't don't let them tell you it's your heart it's not your heart and we know on the wings of the snow white dove he got his answer he preached it he found that seventh White Dove and we know that God told him your enemy is dead remember the story where he's raking up and down the stick and that little weasel looking thing came out with the electric currents on it that thing was killed brother Bram he did his whole Ministry asking and pleading he even wrote a new verse for that song right oh my I can't even remember the song's name probably yeah on the wings of a snow white dove but here we have the prophet God didn't change his life even though he prayed for it he didn't change his life he let him go a long long ways but he did finally answer his prayer towards the end of his ministry and isn't it interesting right at the very end when he was in the car wreck what was he doing in the car wreck he was apologizing to the people while they were trying to get him out and he moaned in pain he probably screamed in pain and and and and the First Responders were like wow this guy's apologizing to us his wife needed a touch what did he do he reached over and touched sister Ma how many more years did she live by the prayer of that Prophet but you know it wasn't for him was it it was for us amen it was for the Bride of Jesus Christ so that we could go on to have a real relationship with our God Amen not so that we can see signs and wonders but I'll tell you what when you need him when you really need him and you're born again and you call upon the name of the Living God he is more than willing to be right there with you Hezekiah was the one who got the blessing and I want to say it today take hezekiah's name out not adding or or or taking away from don't don't go too far getting that way with me but just take your name and insert it in there right say Christopher was the one who got the blessing brother brandham just took the word put your name in there make it real brother brandom in the message he says we've got to find our own characteristics in the Bible characters we need to be willing to put ourselves in there and when we can do that I think we'll get some great encouragement Hezekiah was the one who got the blessing Isaiah just took the word I better call the musicians amen you see it Hezekiah was the one that got the blessing not Isaiah it wasn't Isaiah's prayers that was heard it was hezekiah's prayers that was heard and I want to say today brothers and sisters the prophet for our day is done gone onto his reward he's been gone for how many years now God's not listening to hear the word of the Prophet he's listening to hear your words he's listening to hear my words but we got to be willing to give him words but when we are his ears open to hear it it was hezekiah's prayers that was heard Isaiah was just the medium that took him the word in human lips what God had said well that's the same thing he says well that's the same thing that was God don't you believe that was Christ the anointed the logos well sure it's the same thing tonight I say sure it's the same thing this morning brothers and sisters they that wait upon the Lord they will renew their strength that's the word of God you have to renew your strength if you're willing to wait upon the Lord H he's not going to come as an Uber delivery or or door Dash or whatever it is skip the dishes whatever it is we're used to just getting instant results for our lives it's not the way God works that's the way Satan Works they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles maybe stand with me as we close today they shall run and not be weary and they'll walk it not faint but we need to say teach me Lord Lord to wait let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word thank you Lord that you are the same yesterday today and forever and Heavenly Father Lord we can see that the children of Israel they were brought into their promised land and they got slack they got slack with the promises everything was looked after in their lives they didn't have to worry but because of that vacuum they got lazy and we know that the enemy crept in and caused them to let down the bars to not be mending the fences when they got

up with the word and father if they don't help us Lord Jesus to have a spirit of repentance have help us Lord to just subject ourselves to you and to your word father let us get your holy ghost your holy spirit that token that we need because there's coming a day where we will meet that River and father if we don't have that token in our hands we're going to have trouble getting over we know that brother brandham talked about that fella he doesn't want to have any trouble that day at the river Lord none of us want to have trouble that day at the river we all have a date with Destiny whether
