[0:04] man it's good to be here I'm just on a
[0:06] training course and
[0:08] leaving tomorrow and just good to be in
[0:10] the house of the Lord amen
[0:13] once I stood in the night
[0:19] with my head thou Lord
[0:25] in the darkness
[0:27] as black has could be
[0:34] and my heart
[0:37] fell too long
[0:40] and I cried oh
[0:44] Lord don't hide your
[0:50] [Music]
[0:55] me like a king
[0:58] I may live
[1:01] in a palace oh so tall with great riches
[1:09] to
[1:11] call
[1:12] my own
[1:17] but I don't know a thing
[1:22] in this whole
[1:25] wide world
[1:28] that's worse
[1:31] [Music]
[1:38] hold my hand
[1:42] all the way
[1:44] every hour of every day
[1:50] from here
[1:52] to the great on Lord
[1:57] [Music]

[2:05] [Music]
[2:08] alone
[2:10] [Music]

[2:29] let me stand where no one
[2:37] stands alone
