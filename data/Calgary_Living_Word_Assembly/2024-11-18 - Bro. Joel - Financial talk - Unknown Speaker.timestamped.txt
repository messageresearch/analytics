[0:00] pray Lord that you'd bless it that your
[0:01] people would be blessed Lord and um that
[0:04] through their natural Prosperity that
[0:07] they could bless other people in this
[0:08] world Lord we love you father we thank
[0:10] you for all your gifts and we ask these
[0:11] things in Jesus name amen amen okay so
[0:16] I'm going to
[0:18] start with what the young people know as
[0:21] my favorite scripture um so this is
[0:24] Matthew 6:30 to 34 I'll just quickly
[0:27] read it although I'm sure it's seared
[0:29] into many people's Minds by now
[0:31] wherefore if God so clothe the grass of
[0:33] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[0:35] cast into the oven shall he not much
[0:38] more clothe you oh ye of little faith
[0:40] therefore take no thought saying what
[0:42] shall we eat or what shall we drink or
[0:44] wherewith All Shall we be clothed for
[0:46] after all these things do the Gentiles
[0:47] seek for your heavenly father knoweth
[0:50] that you have need of these things but
[0:51] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[0:54] righteousness and all these things will
[0:57] be added unto you take therefore no
[1:00] thought for the morrow for the morrow
[1:01] shall take thought for the things of
[1:03] itself sufficient unto the day the evil
[1:05] thereof and I'll give my standard quick
[1:08] blur about this um I don't believe God
[1:11] is saying don't think about tomorrow my
[1:13] personal revelation on this is don't be
[1:16] consumed about the thoughts of tomorrow
[1:18] don't let your mind constantly be
[1:20] worrying about your future and one of
[1:22] the ways to do that is to set up your
[1:24] financial security because you know
[1:26] anybody who's had a bill due and who
[1:30] knows they don't have the money to cover
[1:31] that bill you know how awful that feels
[1:34] and what kind of anxiety twists at your
[1:36] stomach while you're waiting for that
[1:37] due date and it's it's a horrible
[1:39] feeling and you you you're not a worldly
[1:42] person because you're vexed about this
[1:43] problem it's real um so my My Hope Is
[1:47] that um with right principles in place
[1:50] any income level can find a way to
[1:53] manage um and plan for their
[1:58] future oh I guess I have a pointer now
[2:02] yay okay so uh just a couple more
[2:05] scriptures really quickly because I want
[2:06] to make sure we're starting on the right
[2:08] foot um God expects us to be stewards of
[2:11] His blessings so Matthew 25 ver14 to19
[2:15] is the parable of the parable of the man
[2:18] who uh was giving the talents to the
[2:21] different servants and you know one
[2:22] invested them wisely and one best
[2:24] invested them two invested them wisely
[2:27] and one did not and the one was rebuked
[2:30] so my my thought is just make the most
[2:33] of what God has given you regardless of
[2:35] how small it may seem because God
[2:37] doesn't measure US based on the size of
[2:39] the talent we're given he measures US
[2:41] based on how we use what we are given
[2:43] and I think that's a really important
[2:45] key Luke
[2:47] 16:10 um is the scripture he that's
[2:50] faithful in that which is least is
[2:51] faithful also in in much and he that is
[2:54] unjust in least is also unjust in much
[2:58] so we are accountable to God with how we
[2:59] use what he gives us and I think that um
[3:02] it's going to be hard to answer with uh
[3:05] how how did you spend all these gifts
[3:07] and talents that I gave you if you
[3:09] cannot show that you gave anything back
[3:11] to the Lord so um I want to be mindful
[3:13] of that as well and Galatians 6 7 to8 is
[3:18] uh be ye not deceived God is Not mocked
[3:20] what a man Seth that shall he also reap
[3:23] so be intentional with your resources
[3:26] your money time wealth all of your gifts
[3:28] because as you s so um so so shall you
[3:32] reap that's kind of a tongue twister um
[3:35] so I I just want us to be especially the
[3:37] the young people as you're getting into
[3:39] your careers and into um you know even
[3:41] your high school time um you reap what
[3:45] you s so if you're if you're have a huge
[3:47] test or a deadline next week and you're
[3:49] not sewing any any investment of time
[3:52] into studying you might not reap uh a
[3:55] great reward and then your parents will
[3:57] be very ww
[4:00] okay last uh set of scriptures here so I
[4:03] want to I want to make sure that we
[4:05] understand that getting rich is not the
[4:08] goal um I don't think there's anything
[4:11] wrong with being rich just let me say
[4:13] that there's there was plenty of rich
[4:16] people in the Bible Solomon was the
[4:18] wealthiest man on earth I don't think
[4:20] God ever condemned Solomon for that um
[4:23] so there the but the point of this
[4:26] seminar is not to teach you how to get
[4:29] rich or how to get rich quick I don't
[4:30] believe in that personally I think
[4:32] getting rich takes uh many many years
[4:36] or the inheritance of one really wealthy
[4:39] ancestor um but the scripture says uh in
[4:44] Hebrews 135 that comparison is the thief
[4:46] of Joy uh when it says don't let your
[4:49] conversation be jealous be content with
[4:51] what you have for he said I will never
[4:53] leave you nor forsake you so don't be
[4:55] comparing yourself to somebody else
[4:56] who's a few years ahead of you or who
[4:58] has a different skill said or has a
[5:00] different gift monetary value is not
[5:03] what God's looking at in everything you
[5:04] know some people have the gift of
[5:06] preaching or speaking or music or
[5:08] Compassion or um uh even like cooking
[5:11] and serving Hospitality those are all
[5:13] wonderful gifts that have the world
[5:15] doesn't place a whole lot of monetary
[5:16] value on unfortunately and since as
[5:18] brother mban said our medium of exchange
[5:20] is currency we always tend to Value
[5:22] things by currency because that's the
[5:24] fastest way to measure but that's not
[5:26] what God looks at uh his currency is not
[5:29] in pled like ours and um he doesn't look
[5:31] at us that way Matthew
[5:35] 6:19 um lay not Treasures on Earth where
[5:38] moth corrupts and thieves steal lay up
[5:40] your Treasures in Heaven where your
[5:41] treasure is there will your heart be
[5:43] also so although I said it's it's fine
[5:46] to be rich I don't want people to think
[5:49] that you're you know having your heart
[5:52] on your riches is fine because it's
[5:55] being wealthy is one thing but measuring
[5:58] Yourself by that wealth is not uh is not
[6:00] healthy yes but the ber I just have to
[6:03] say what is
[6:05] Rich so I think that's a very flexible
[6:08] personal definition honestly and it
[6:11] depends on where you are probably how
[6:13] old you are and who you know because I
[6:15] would personally consider like for me I
[6:18] think I think of rich as somebody who
[6:20] doesn't have to consider their time for
[6:23] money they can they can volunteer they
[6:27] can do something for other people or
[6:29] they can be selfish and go sit on an
[6:31] island all day and whe no matter what
[6:33] they do they will be taken care of for
[6:35] the rest of their life to me that is
[6:37] like ultimate wealth where you have
[6:40] flexibility to do what you want but for
[6:41] some people rich is probably a million
[6:43] dollars and unfortunately that will not
[6:45] get you to what I just
[6:47] described uh anymore anyways not in
[6:50] Canada what do you think of as Rich I
[6:53] just think it's was mentioned mentioned
[6:55] it a couple times and there's a lot of
[6:57] different definitions you said that
[6:59] that's I'm certainly not here to correct
[7:01] but I just want maybe it's found upon
[7:04] the thought of which some people it
[7:07] could be simply to have a family and a
[7:10] healthy family right that goes to church
[7:13] and serves God that could be great
[7:15] riches but that's a very good point
[7:19] finances so I mean what what is Rich I
[7:22] guess right yeah for just for the stream
[7:24] I'll quickly summarize but Barry brought
[7:26] up a very good point I'm pretty single
[7:28] track at the moment thinking about about
[7:29] money uh but Barry's point I believe is
[7:33] Rich you can be you know there there's
[7:35] many Psalms about being rich in the Lord
[7:38] and rich in family and rich in health
[7:41] and Rich does not always have a monetary
[7:43] value so yeah absolutely like you know
[7:46] there's uh uh I every single day when I
[7:51] think about what I'm thankful for I I
[7:54] give thanks to God every day and money
[7:58] is never in the top three things that
[8:00] I'm thankful for the first thing is the
[8:04] safety of my family I think to live in a
[8:07] country where you have safety and health
[8:09] and we just take it for granted but I
[8:10] remind God every day of how thankful I
[8:12] am for that so very very good point um
[8:15] you can be rich in a whole lot of areas
[8:17] that have nothing to do with your bank
[8:19] account um Matthew 10:42 and whosoever
[8:23] shall give to drink unto one of the
[8:24] least of these my little ones uh sorry
[8:27] this is a different translation and
[8:28] whosoever shall give give to drink unto
[8:30] one of these little ones a cup of cold
[8:32] water only in the name of a disciple
[8:34] verily I say unto you he shall in no
[8:36] wise lose his reward so there's other
[8:39] Investments as well invest investing in
[8:41] your money only is not going to get you
[8:43] to the goal you need to invest in the
[8:45] people around you and in your community
[8:46] in your
[8:47] church Luke 6:38 give it shall be given
[8:50] unto you good measure press down shaken
[8:53] together and running over shall men give
[8:56] unto your bosom for with the same
[8:58] measure that ye meet with all it shall
[9:00] be measured to you again so again I
[9:02] think brother mvin touched on this a
[9:03] little bit today is
[9:05] just being generous with what God has
[9:07] blessed you with if God blessed you with
[9:10] the the gift of uh singing don't hold
[9:13] that to yourself and don't sell it to
[9:15] the world for um what they consider to
[9:18] be riches if God blesses you financially
[9:21] it doesn't mean that he wants you to
[9:22] just sit on an island
[9:24] somewhere uh God calls his children to
[9:27] use their blessings for other people
[9:29] people around them um especially in my
[9:31] opinion Believers but you know the
[9:33] scripture does not say to only bless
[9:35] bless Believers as well the um the the
[9:37] needy the hungry the widows all these
[9:40] people that are less
[9:42] fortunate
[9:44] okay
[9:46] so
[9:47] um these are I
[9:50] think
[9:52] the very very summarized Concepts that I
[9:55] want people to come away with so if you
[9:58] want to invest successfully number one
[10:01] start
[10:02] early H as soon as you can number two
[10:05] you need to be diverse in your
[10:06] Investments don't put all of your
[10:08] investments into one
[10:10] asset um number three is minimize taxes
[10:13] and fees in your investment plan
[10:16] otherwise you'll just constantly where
[10:18] moth where where uh where moth does
[10:21] corrupt and rust Decay that's taxes and
[10:24] fees mostly taxes uh be consistent in
[10:28] your plan don't be side Track by you
[10:30] know Bitcoin or um by whatever is trendy
[10:33] today or by market up ups and downs
[10:36] don't get caught up in the froth it's
[10:38] it's not very healthy and then finally
[10:40] adapt to your phase of life so somebody
[10:42] who's 13 versus 65 should have a very
[10:44] very different plan and a different
[10:47] strategy okay so when to start
[10:50] saving right
[10:53] now I don't care how old you are if you
[10:56] earn income uh the principle of saving
[11:01] is what I what I think is so important
[11:03] it's not how much money you're saving
[11:05] it's the principle and the Habit so a
[11:09] very uh unfortunate statistic these are
[11:12] recent statistics
[11:13] from uh Health the uh Health Care fund
[11:17] of Ontario it's like a giant pension
[11:19] fund come on in um 40% of Canadians
[11:24] these are adults uh did not save
[11:26] anything for their retirement last year
[11:30] 44% of Canadians that are less than 10
[11:33] years from
[11:34] retirement do not have $5,000
[11:38] saved
[11:40] 75% have less than
[11:43] $100,000 so these are really scary
[11:45] numbers unfortunately um and as you can
[11:49] see it's the vast majority the vast
[11:52] majority so if you're on your way to
[11:54] having over $5,000 by the time you're 55
[11:58] consider yourself blessed
[12:00] because you're doing better than a lot
[12:01] of people in this
[12:02] country um I would I would like to start
[12:07] preparing our young people so that they
[12:09] have principles in place that there's
[12:12] another zero added on to that $100,000
[12:15] by the time they're 55 or maybe 65 um
[12:19] inflation is a thing we'll talk about um
[12:21] so numbers uh when when I'm going to
[12:24] talk about future values today I'm going
[12:28] to be
[12:30] saying that there is no inflation I'm
[12:32] going to be pretending that there's no
[12:33] inflation just for the purpose of this
[12:34] discussion but I want to briefly educate
[12:37] you so you know having a million dollars
[12:40] in the bank used to be enough for future
[12:42] security about 15 years ago or so
[12:44] probably a million dollars would have
[12:46] set you up with a middleclass lifestyle
[12:48] forever because you could invest that
[12:50] and earn like three to 5% on that income
[12:52] on that on that asset and you could live
[12:54] on that 3 to
[12:56] five% uh like $3 to $50,000 for the rest
[12:58] of your life
[13:00] you cannot do that anymore unfortunately
[13:01] inflation over the last five or three
[13:03] years has averaged around 6% 5%
[13:07] something like that very very high for
[13:09] Canada anyways now we're back down to 2%
[13:12] which is the target for the Bank of
[13:13] Canada so 2% inflation is what they want
[13:16] forever um so you should understand that
[13:21] if you're saving you know $400 a month
[13:25] and you save that you think yes $400
[13:27] $400 a month I'll make it to a million
[13:29] in like 40 years um you need to increase
[13:33] that $400 like every couple years
[13:35] because in in in in um 10 years that
[13:39] $400 is only going to buy you what $350
[13:43] or so bought you 10 years ago so
[13:47] inflation can be a little bit weedy I
[13:49] don't want to get really really
[13:50] technical but just understand that you
[13:53] need to gradually add to your
[13:55] Investments over time that is
[13:57] complicated to math and I want to hurt
[13:59] our heads and I don't have the brain for
[14:01] that brother Chris is my math guy and
[14:03] he's not here so um for the purpose of
[14:06] this presentation we're going to use
[14:07] constant values so we're going to say
[14:09] that $500 today is worth the same amount
[14:12] in 60 years or 100 years so all the
[14:14] numbers that I'm working with I'm trying
[14:16] to keep them constant as if no inflation
[14:18] happened what that really means though
[14:20] is you're going to have to invest more
[14:22] over time to to make it to that
[14:24] level okay
[14:29] um so annual rate of of Return of 7% and
[14:33] for this for this example only I am
[14:35] going to show you because I want to I
[14:36] want to shock a few people and and
[14:38] encourage others at how much you would
[14:41] need to save to get a million dollars
[14:43] after inflation I should have said what
[14:45] I just said after this slide um so for
[14:48] this calculation this is assuming 2%
[14:51] inflation and that your money is going
[14:52] to return 7% every single year that's
[14:56] not that's not super hard to do honestly
[14:58] 7% uh over the course of 20 years or
[15:01] something is uh is not unreasonable um
[15:05] so if you start saving at the age of 18
[15:08] you will have a million dollars by the
[15:10] time you're 65 if you put $620 a month
[15:14] so how many 18y olds have 620 bucks a
[15:17] month in their jeans that's I think
[15:19] that's quite a lot of money honestly um
[15:22] but keep in mind this is after
[15:25] inflation um so this means that you will
[15:28] have a million in real buying power by
[15:31] the time you're 65 uh if you uh if you
[15:34] took out inflation this would be closer
[15:36] to like uh$ 300 and something dollars
[15:39] but uh 18 to 65 is so long you have a
[15:42] long time to battle inflation but you
[15:44] also have a long time to let your money
[15:45] grow going to the other edge of the
[15:47] spectrum I'm sure you guys can read
[15:49] these numbers yourselves I don't have to
[15:50] read them all out to you but on the
[15:52] other side you know 620 a month if
[15:54] you're
[15:55] 18 turns into 2100 a month if you're 40
[15:59] trying to reach the same goal of getting
[16:01] a million dollar after inflation by the
[16:03] time you're 65 so this is called
[16:07] compounding compounding interest it
[16:10] means that if you put $100 in the bank
[16:13] today and you don't touch it in maybe a
[16:16] year it'll be worth
[16:18] $107 but the next year that seven that
[16:22] 7% um interest is going to apply on $107
[16:26] not $100 so the next year you you're not
[16:29] going to earn $7 of Interest you're
[16:30] going to earn $725 or something if you
[16:33] add zeros behind those numbers that
[16:35] becomes really important the compounding
[16:37] power of of uh interest and Investments
[16:39] as your assets grow they grow faster and
[16:43] that's why if you see return graphs they
[16:44] will often Bend and get much steeper at
[16:47] the end of life because the longer you
[16:50] wait before taking those out those last
[16:52] five to 10 years are your highest
[16:54] earning years the interest alone can be
[16:56] worth more than you've invested for the
[16:58] first 10 years all cumulatively so um
[17:02] really important Concepts here so how do
[17:04] you start saving um going back to our
[17:07] first seminar does this can you see this
[17:09] pointer on the
[17:10] screen I I don't think it works on the
[17:12] screen um okay so budget for it if you
[17:17] don't well if you fail to plan you plan
[17:20] to fail old ad AG very true uh the first
[17:23] seminar that we did um I don't know if
[17:26] you guys remember does anybody want us
[17:27] to take a stab at where but where
[17:29] investing was in your budget plan as far
[17:31] as like you have your
[17:33] income what comes off
[17:36] next tithes what came off next savings
[17:41] savings so after you've paid your tithes
[17:45] you need to pay your future self and if
[17:48] you if you do that your future self will
[17:50] patch you on the back and be very very
[17:52] grateful be nice to your future so
[17:55] budget for it if if you don't budget to
[17:59] invest um what's going to happen is
[18:01] you'll probably end up spending most of
[18:02] your money and then you won't have
[18:03] anything left to invest so that's why I
[18:06] think it's critical to put that in your
[18:08] plan is that you know this 10% or
[18:10] whatever is going to go into my
[18:11] investment and then you can find out how
[18:13] much you can afford to spend on a
[18:15] house automatic transfers absolutely key
[18:18] if I had to manually transfer money into
[18:21] my savings account whenever I had enough
[18:22] left over I'm sure I would never do it
[18:25] maybe like Christmas I would think about
[18:27] it oh yeah I haven't done anything this
[18:28] year and I would like throw a couple
[18:30] hundred in Christmas and then not
[18:31] realize it was supposed to be a couple
[18:33] hundred a month for like the last three
[18:35] years so uh I think automatic transfers
[18:38] are really really powerful
[18:40] yes we all know what automatic transfers
[18:43] is can you just expound because that's
[18:44] been our number one principle so we we
[18:48] never see our never see our paycheck
[18:52] piece of investment it comes out
[18:54] automatically we never see it can we
[18:57] just expound on that a little bit I
[18:58] think that's so so important
[19:03] so I I hope I'm getting at what you're
[19:05] talking about here but like if if you
[19:08] get paid on the first of the month
[19:10] that's probably when you should have
[19:11] your Investments coming out and that
[19:13] that's the way we do it um I'm
[19:15] self-employed so I don't want to really
[19:17] use me as an example because it's not
[19:18] very common but um you know most people
[19:21] you get paid maybe twice a month or
[19:22] something like that on those days you
[19:26] should probably have some fixed trans
[19:28] transfers that come out automatically
[19:30] that you can't control after that point
[19:32] um we also send our investments to a
[19:35] different institution they're not at our
[19:36] our primary bank because I don't want to
[19:38] touch them and I don't want to be
[19:39] tempted to touch them sometimes we just
[19:42] forget about it because the money
[19:43] automatically comes out we we have to
[19:46] live on what's left in the bank account
[19:48] and so it since it's automatic there's
[19:50] no risk or temptation to say oh the car
[19:53] broke down I can't invest this month I'm
[19:56] going to wait till the next month and
[19:58] then the fridge breaks down and then you
[20:00] go for dinner too many times so it's a
[20:02] it's a much safer strategy to just start
[20:04] with an automatic withdrawal you can do
[20:07] this um through your bank itself I might
[20:11] briefly touch on the literal practical
[20:13] steps you take but I don't want to get
[20:14] too far down that road because it could
[20:16] be different for everybody but this is
[20:19] as easy as going to your bank and saying
[20:21] I want to put $500 a month into an
[20:23] investment and they can help you I don't
[20:26] think the bank is the best place to help
[20:27] you but it's the easiest place and if
[20:31] you do nothing else if you from this
[20:34] whole seminar and you and you have not
[20:36] started investing then just go to your
[20:38] bank and start it immediately because uh
[20:40] I don't want you to take the best option
[20:43] but wait years to do it it's better to
[20:45] start today you can always change your
[20:46] Investments you can always take that
[20:48] money out and put it somewhere else once
[20:50] you get more um you know perspective of
[20:52] of your plan does that answer your
[20:55] question employee savings and investment
[20:57] matching this is by far the best one if
[21:00] you have an employer matched pension
[21:02] fund or uh RSP matching something like
[21:05] that they're they're called many
[21:07] different names um crystals I think they
[21:10] they match 5% of her salary so if she
[21:13] invests 5% of her paycheck they will
[21:16] brother sister Helen probably knows
[21:17] better than I do on this because I okay
[21:20] but I forget what the union did right
[21:21] now but it's I think it's 5% they you
[21:24] invest 5% so say you make this is this
[21:27] is not the real number but it's easy say
[21:29] you make $100,000 in a year you invest
[21:31] $5,000 your employer matches another
[21:35] $55,000 what's your return on investment
[21:37] in your first
[21:39] year 100% return on your investment in
[21:42] your first year and compounding interest
[21:46] applies after that so we're going to
[21:49] show you an example uh of how strong
[21:53] that concept is if you are not taking
[21:55] advantage full advantage of your
[21:58] employer matched Savings Plan please
[22:01] stop your other investing
[22:03] immediately if you if you're if you're
[22:05] throwing money into Bitcoin or into a
[22:06] savings
[22:07] account Whittle that down till you're
[22:10] matching till you're fully utilizing
[22:11] your employer matched savings plan
[22:13] because they will give you can invest it
[22:15] in anything you want you don't have to
[22:17] invest it into your employer stock they
[22:18] often want you to but most of the time
[22:21] uh I shouldn't say all the time but most
[22:23] of the time they will allow you to
[22:24] invest in anything um and they'll match
[22:27] it so it's it's extremely valuable
[22:30] windfalls so you know um sometimes
[22:33] you'll get a bonus like a Christmas
[22:34] bonus or maybe you'll do an extra job on
[22:37] the side so your salary is say 65,000 a
[22:40] year I'm using 65,000 by the way because
[22:42] that's what we last seminar we said the
[22:44] average income in C in Calgary the
[22:46] average single earner is 65,000 so
[22:49] that's what I'm going to use for all
[22:50] these examples as well if you make
[22:52] another you know thousand a month tithe
[22:54] on it and then invest on it as well
[22:57] don't let it just go and into ice cream
[23:00] or something like that try to try to use
[23:02] that that windfall to accelerate your
[23:05] investing and your saving your future
[23:07] self will thank
[23:08] you um start now same as kind of
[23:12] previous slide start and end start now
[23:14] start now whatever if if you are not a
[23:18] on a salary job if you're like a student
[23:20] and you're just making a little bit of
[23:21] money I don't care get used to putting
[23:23] 10% away for our kids we force them
[23:29] it's not a democracy in our home uh they
[23:32] put away 10% of their income and uh it's
[23:35] growing in a little account and
[23:39] I don't know if I want all Li to hear
[23:42] this but I think by the time they turn
[23:44] 18 they'll be able to buy a car like
[23:46] almost anything they they want uh on
[23:48] wheels at that age because we are
[23:50] forcing them to save now and that money
[23:53] is slowly growing and by the time you
[23:55] know 16 years after they start maybe 14
[23:58] years years we started them about four
[23:59] years old um they'll probably have
[24:02] enough money and they're putting aside a
[24:03] little bit of their own money too so
[24:04] it's just getting used to not spending
[24:08] everything you make and and you just get
[24:10] used to this concept like okay I made
[24:13] $10 this week but I'm not going to get
[24:15] to spend $10 this week There's tithes
[24:18] and investing that come first and then I
[24:20] can spend whatever's left over
[24:24] okay this is the difference of using
[24:27] your employer matched investing plan
[24:30] versus not the Blue Line both of these
[24:33] people are investing the exact same
[24:35] amount of money in the exact same asset
[24:37] for the exact same amount of time the
[24:39] only difference is the guy in the red
[24:42] you utilized his saving his investor or
[24:45] sorry his employer match savings plan so
[24:48] the N number here this is after 40 Years
[24:52] of investing 10% of a $65,000 income so
[24:56] 10% of $65,000
[24:58] after tax by the way yeah because I I
[25:01] think it's it is actually pretty hard to
[25:02] save 10% of your pre-tax income that's
[25:05] quite aggressive unless you're making
[25:06] good money anyways that is $416 a month
[25:10] they're
[25:11] saving after 40 years this person uh
[25:16] made the the blue I think made 1.2
[25:19] million in 40 years from only investing
[25:21] $416 a month the red is 2.5 million and
[25:26] the only difference is that they you
[25:28] they have an employer ma match Savings
[25:30] Plan it's 100% return guys do not let
[25:34] that go if you if you're working
[25:36] somewhere ask them if you don't know ask
[25:38] them hey do we have any benefits like
[25:39] match saving plan sometimes they don't
[25:41] match 100% when I was at demo they only
[25:44] match 50% but 50% return on your
[25:47] investment on day one it's an absolute
[25:50] bargain so do not let that go
[25:54] um to see if I had any notes on this one
[26:01] okay so the next was diversification uh
[26:04] does anybody know does anybody want to
[26:05] take a stab at what what it means to be
[26:07] diverse in your
[26:11] Investments but Peter just saying that
[26:15] don't put your egg in one basket yes so
[26:20] but Peter says don't put your eggs in
[26:22] one bask all your eggs in one basket so
[26:24] if you have a really good stock that you
[26:27] understand and it's and it's powerful
[26:29] like um I'm going to use the example of
[26:32] like uh Apple because most people know
[26:34] who apple is and they've done quite well
[26:36] over the last 10
[26:37] years so if you had only invested in
[26:40] apple 10 years ago you'd be very happy
[26:43] today because they have beat the market
[26:45] they've done extremely well on average
[26:47] they've they've made you a lot of money
[26:50] do you know who else was making way more
[26:52] than Apple you guys won't remember this
[26:55] Enron in the turn of the century in the
[26:58] in the mid to late 90s Enron was
[27:01] printing money and uh almost literally
[27:04] they um so if you owned Enron stock from
[27:07] like 1992 to 2000 you were so so
[27:12] happy in like May of 2000 that stock
[27:17] went to zero because the the company
[27:20] went bankrupt it didn't go it didn't go
[27:22] like this and slowly waved down it went
[27:25] like this and then it went bam and
[27:28] everybody was caught on the ride and
[27:30] lost their shirt uh 2008 the banking
[27:33] crisis Leman Brothers bankrupt in a
[27:36] matter of like five days nobody thought
[27:39] that would happen I'm not saying Apple's
[27:40] going bankrupt uh but I'm saying that
[27:43] putting all of your your investments
[27:46] into one good asset is a very very very
[27:49] risky thing to do um maybe it doesn't go
[27:52] to zero maybe you're five years from
[27:53] retirement and then it just loses 30% of
[27:56] its value and now how do you make up 30%
[27:59] in 5 years you're going to be very
[28:02] stressed so um I believe in in picking
[28:06] stocks if you know what you're doing I
[28:08] don't I certainly don't uh so what I
[28:11] think is a safer plan is to diversify
[28:14] and have a basket of multiple different
[28:16] stocks so when I say diversification
[28:20] this is not like you know having apple
[28:23] and
[28:24] Microsoft they're in the same industry
[28:27] it's not even having Apple Microsoft
[28:29] Google Nvidia Facebook all those cool
[28:31] stocks they're all following the same
[28:34] trend line and if one goes down they're
[28:36] all going to go down because it's going
[28:37] to be a big reason that pulls them down
[28:39] maybe government regulation changes
[28:41] maybe electricity goes to 300 bucks a
[28:43] kilowatt hour or something um so maybe
[28:46] the robots come who knows but basically
[28:49] if you're going to diversify you need to
[28:50] have many Industries so I have a few
[28:53] points here a diversified investment is
[28:56] many Industries many risk profiles so
[28:59] some assets are like Nvidia much more
[29:03] like this you know risky it's going up
[29:04] and down but it's climbing fast growth
[29:06] growth stock then there's stuff like uh
[29:09] Royal Bank of Canada it's kind of been
[29:12] going like this slow and steady for 50
[29:15] years so it's not growing a ton but it's
[29:18] also quite safe way less risk you don't
[29:21] necessarily want all your eggs in that
[29:22] basket either because then somebody else
[29:24] is going to outpace you and make a lot
[29:26] more than you in the same amount of time
[29:28] so you want both um many geographical
[29:31] locations this is not as applicable if
[29:34] you're only investing in the United
[29:35] States because the United States is the
[29:37] cap is the capital king of the world um
[29:40] but if you're only investing in Canada I
[29:43] personally don't believe that that's a
[29:45] good idea because Canada's Market is
[29:47] growing much slower than the the states
[29:50] um also there's overseas markets there's
[29:52] um Asian markets sometimes they're
[29:55] growing much faster than ours are as
[29:56] well so what I'm trying to say is like a
[29:59] mix of everything will mean that when
[30:03] the market crashes you're less likely to
[30:05] to lose everything and when the market
[30:07] explodes you know you're going to rise a
[30:09] little bit as well um many asset
[30:12] allocations this one's a bit technical
[30:14] but it it's not applicable too much in
[30:15] your early career it's much much more
[30:17] when you're closer to retirement that
[30:19] means like stocks uh is is an asset type
[30:23] then there's bonds bonds is like debt
[30:25] that a company lends you or that sorry
[30:27] that you lend a company
[30:28] much safer but slower growing um then
[30:32] there are like T bills those are
[30:33] government treasuries those are very
[30:35] safe they grow very very slowly though
[30:37] and then there's cash which is very very
[30:39] safe but grows at like 1% so savings
[30:44] accounts basically oh by the way I
[30:47] didn't show this I didn't make a graph
[30:48] for this but I wanted to quickly mention
[30:50] if you are um saving money but you're
[30:53] only putting it into a savings account
[30:54] you're not investing it in the market
[30:56] you're also going to be you're going to
[30:58] be further behind than that blue line
[31:00] that blue line is 7% return if if you
[31:04] only put it in a savings account in the
[31:05] same period of time you'd end up with
[31:07] like around 400,000 so 60% less than the
[31:12] person who invested in the market so
[31:15] sometimes the stock market is
[31:16] scary but it doesn't mean that it's
[31:19] actually dangerous it's just stock
[31:21] picking is dangerous if you pick one
[31:23] good stock that's that or you get a tip
[31:25] from a friend um that's what's really
[31:27] Danger dangerous because you could lose
[31:29] everything but if you're doing what I'm
[31:30] going to talk about um you're not going
[31:32] to lose uh you're not going to lose
[31:34] everything in the stock market unless
[31:36] you know the world comes to an end and
[31:37] then we're happy because that's actually
[31:40] what we all
[31:43] want okay um so the easiest way to
[31:46] diversify is by buying into a large pool
[31:49] of
[31:50] assets I'm sure you've heard of mutual
[31:52] funds that's what a mutual fund is it's
[31:55] a fund that's mutually held by many
[31:57] investors
[31:58] so maybe you have $1,000 maybe Bill
[32:00] Gates has a billion dollars you both
[32:02] invest in the same fund and you are
[32:05] getting uh your cut of the whole fund so
[32:09] if you you know if if your money makes
[32:11] up 1% of the fund you make 1% of the
[32:13] return the fund is not invested in one
[32:16] stock they're invested in whatever you
[32:18] choose you know um there's like there
[32:21] there's different categories and this is
[32:22] what I don't want to get too technical
[32:23] in but if you feel really good about oil
[32:26] and gas there are oil and gas Mutual
[32:28] funds that will hold many different oil
[32:30] and gas industry um uh players you know
[32:32] from from Upstream to uh service and all
[32:36] those different types of elements and
[32:38] that's safer than just buying one stock
[32:41] but you're still going to be exposed to
[32:42] the to the oil and gas market overall or
[32:45] you can buy a diverse group from
[32:46] everything and that's going to be a
[32:48] little bit
[32:49] safer um but mutual funds are actively
[32:52] managed there's there's some guy in the
[32:55] Ivory Tower making way too much money
[32:58] deciding every single day how much to
[33:01] buy and sell for that mutual fund so if
[33:03] if you as an investor you say hey um
[33:06] buddy I want you know 10% return on my
[33:09] investment he's like ah we're only at 6%
[33:13] this year we've done a bad year so I I
[33:15] better buy and sell stuff to make more
[33:17] money and then he does the wrong thing
[33:20] so there's no guaranteed that a mutual
[33:22] fund will make more just because it's
[33:23] managed by a smart person but it is
[33:26] guaranteed that you'll pay more in fees
[33:28] uh I'll show that soon exchange traded
[33:30] funds these are very similar but a
[33:33] completely different method instead of a
[33:35] smart guy making decisions or girl
[33:37] making decisions every day about what to
[33:39] buy and sell they set a rule so of of
[33:43] the most popular rule that most people
[33:45] are buying into is um it's just called
[33:48] like the SNP 500 Index an index fund so
[33:53] an ETF exchange trated fund the rule
[33:56] will be what whoever is in the S&P 500
[33:59] which is the 500 biggest companies in
[34:01] the in the US Stock Market we are going
[34:04] to buy one of each show those shares and
[34:07] you know if somebody else puts a million
[34:09] dollars in we're going to buy that value
[34:12] of each of those shares that's their
[34:14] rule they don't make a decision if the
[34:16] market crashes or if the you know if um
[34:18] oil is found in Antarctica they don't
[34:21] they don't make any decisions based on
[34:23] that all they do is follow the rule so
[34:26] as an investor you have to kind of make
[34:28] a decision do I like their rules or do I
[34:31] want a smart guy making all the
[34:33] decisions the big difference between
[34:35] these two is fees and that's the rust
[34:38] decaying your uh returns in my my
[34:41] personal uh opinion there are great
[34:44] mutual funds but um I'm going to show
[34:46] you why they might not be the best uh
[34:48] Bank your buck minimize
[34:51] taxes this one is uh I think most people
[34:55] understand probably over 18 I don't
[34:57] think a lot of the young guys do so I I
[34:59] wanted to kind of go through this um R
[35:02] RSP is registered retirement Savings
[35:05] Plan it's a government of Canada program
[35:08] other countries have it but they're
[35:09] called different things so the way this
[35:12] works is just as it says your
[35:16] contributions to an RSP give you a tax
[35:18] refund so say you're making $65,000 in
[35:22] our
[35:23] example um your tax rate is 30.5% in
[35:28] Alberta if that's your income that's
[35:30] your federal and provincial tax
[35:32] combined so um every th000 that you
[35:36] invest into an RSP the government is
[35:40] going to say that is $1,000 less we're
[35:43] going to tax you on it's the
[35:44] government's way of incentivizing the
[35:46] public to
[35:47] invest um so say you made $65,000 you
[35:52] invest $1,000 you're going to get
[35:55] $35 um as a as a refund from your tax or
[35:59] return reduction technically in your tax
[36:03] bill so um bu math here was um you know
[36:08] investing 10% of 50,000 a year that'll
[36:11] come into I think the next example give
[36:14] me a quick sec to read what I wrote
[36:19] here yeah yeah yeah okay so um every
[36:23] thousand you invest simple math not not
[36:26] getting very tax rates change every five
[36:28] or $6,000 don't don't think about that
[36:30] just pretend it's always
[36:32] 30.5% every th000 you contribute to your
[36:35] RSP is going to reduce your taxes this
[36:37] is huge if you're really smart with that
[36:42] return so you know you can take that, or
[36:45] that $35 and buy a new pair of shoes but
[36:48] that that is money that you had already
[36:51] spent you'd already been taxed on you'd
[36:53] already let it go out the door pretend
[36:55] that that money is no longer yours
[36:58] and when you get that tax refund put it
[37:00] back into your RSP you're going to make
[37:03] much much more over the long run so
[37:06] maximize your returns by reinvesting
[37:08] your refund if you get a refund in this
[37:10] example investing 10% of your $50,000
[37:14] net income is $5,000 a year so you're
[37:17] investing 10% per year into your RSP
[37:20] you're going to get a refund of
[37:23] $1,525 at the end of the year when you
[37:25] do your taxes
[37:28] and um if you put that
[37:30] $1,525 back into your
[37:33] RSP plus your $5,000 that you're
[37:36] investing every year anyways your next
[37:38] year you're investing
[37:44] $6,595 guess what that's higher than
[37:47] 5,000 and guess what that's less taxes
[37:50] you're going to pay your next year's
[37:52] refund is$
[37:54] 1,990 so if you add that to your $5,000
[37:57] that's 6,900 you're investing do this
[38:00] over and over and over and it creates
[38:02] The Snowball Effect where this can just
[38:04] take off and this is if you think about
[38:07] it this way this is free return free
[38:11] money because if you think about that
[38:13] refund is just gone already you've
[38:15] committed it to uh to
[38:18] Trudeau then uh um when it gets when it
[38:22] comes back to you if you reinvest it it
[38:24] just it just takes off so these are the
[38:27] first two
[38:28] examples the yellow is the remember the
[38:31] previous Slide the person who invested
[38:34] 46 46 a month that's 5,000 a year um but
[38:38] they did not get employer matching
[38:40] that's the yellow line the red line is
[38:43] the smarter person who got employer
[38:46] matching and they're way up
[38:49] here the Blue Line did both of those
[38:52] things and then took their refund from
[38:55] both and put it back into the RSB
[38:57] p and they're at I forget the exact
[39:01] number it looks like 3.3
[39:04] million over over the course of 40 years
[39:06] they made over a million dollars more
[39:08] than the other guy did um whoops so huge
[39:12] prompts to brother Chris he did the
[39:14] actuaries on this I couldn't figure out
[39:16] the formulas so uh he put this together
[39:19] and um I think it's amazing to think
[39:22] about if you if you are only investing
[39:25] your own money this is the difference uh
[39:29] that's
[39:30] possible I unfortunately do not get this
[39:32] option my employer doesn't match my rsps
[39:35] but yes brother
[39:37] mvin yeah I mean once you're done with
[39:39] that maybe the previous slide I just
[39:41] have clarification maybe yeah in what
[39:44] you mentioned but 100% of turns are
[39:47] taxable but if if they inside the rrsp
[39:50] account then they're not taable until
[39:52] you put them out very very good point
[39:55] okay
[39:57] so what he's saying at the top I said
[40:01] your contributions to an RSP give you a
[40:03] tax refund that's what we've just been
[40:04] talking about but 100% of the returns
[40:07] are taxable those are not the returns
[40:09] you make every year those are the
[40:11] returns when you cash out so say say for
[40:14] simple math you invested
[40:17] $100,000 and then in 10 years it turned
[40:20] into
[40:21] $200,000 if you take that $200,000 out
[40:24] you get taxed on $200,000
[40:27] so the government gives you a refund
[40:29] when you invest but they kind of make
[40:31] their money back when you pull it out
[40:33] the concept here I'll get into later as
[40:35] to why this is still probably a good
[40:37] thing for some people um and that's all
[40:40] about the timing and how much money
[40:42] you're making or how much tax you're
[40:43] paying now versus in retirement any any
[40:47] questions this is a
[40:48] relatively subtle like not a lot of
[40:52] people do this I feel does it make sense
[40:55] though like does anybody have a question
[40:56] they want to ask ask about
[41:00] this
[41:03] okay so the other way is um there
[41:06] there's two really popular registered
[41:08] savings plans in in Canada one is your
[41:10] RSP which we just talked about there's a
[41:13] complete opposite which is called your
[41:15] tfsa taxfree savings account so at this
[41:20] if you invest you don't get any refund
[41:22] today you don't get any tax benefit
[41:24] today so what that means essentially is
[41:26] you're investing
[41:27] after tax money so if you made like I
[41:30] showed before you make 655,000 a year
[41:33] your after tax money is only 50,000
[41:37] so the the negative thing about tfsas is
[41:41] you don't get a refund to maximize your
[41:44] investing like like an example that we
[41:46] just showed the positive thing is if you
[41:50] believe that your tax that your
[41:52] Investments are going to grow and do
[41:54] really well over time maybe you're going
[41:56] to stay in in it for a very long time
[41:58] like you start investing when you're
[42:00] very young and you're going to let this
[42:01] thing ride till you're 65 or
[42:03] 85 you don't get taxed on a scent of
[42:06] your returns so in the other example I
[42:09] said for simple math you invest $100,000
[42:12] turns into $2 200,000 you get taxed on
[42:14] $200,000 when you pull it out of your
[42:16] RSP hopefully you don't do that all at
[42:18] once this is just for an example sake
[42:20] that would be very very bad decision
[42:22] unless you had much more money elsewhere
[42:26] um with taxfree savings account if if
[42:28] your 100,000 grows to 200,000 you don't
[42:30] get taxed on any of the returns so you
[42:33] could pull out you this could your
[42:34] 100,000 could turn into a trillion
[42:36] dollars probably wouldn't but it could
[42:39] and you wouldn't get taxed on any of the
[42:42] returns so if you have this might be a
[42:46] little bit too personal and I'm not
[42:49] saying this is advice I'm just saying
[42:50] this is like a strategy if you if you
[42:53] have play money like money that you are
[42:55] taking a little bit of a risk on it's
[42:57] not your 10% this is like your extra
[43:00] slush money that you want to just play
[43:01] on the stock market maybe you want to
[43:03] put $1,000 into Tesla for some reason if
[43:06] you do it in a
[43:07] tfsa and it go it goes to the moon uh
[43:11] that's probably going to be a really
[43:13] good tax day because um those those
[43:15] highrisk assets that go up really
[43:18] quickly if you time it right and sell at
[43:19] the right moment you know you could uh
[43:22] you could walk away with a lot of cash
[43:23] and not pay any taxes on it that's not a
[43:25] strategy for long term growth though
[43:27] that's like uh I'm just talking about
[43:29] playing around the other thing that
[43:31] tfsas are great for is medium to
[43:33] short-term savings um this is I did this
[43:36] uh early in the the last four years or
[43:38] whatever I've been putting a little bit
[43:40] of money into a tfsa for a car and this
[43:43] summer I just pulled the money out of
[43:45] the tfsa when I found a car I liked and
[43:47] I I bought the car and I didn't pay any
[43:49] taxes on any of my returns so it's nice
[43:52] for short to medium-term investing
[43:53] because you don't want to do that to
[43:54] your RSP because you're going to trigger
[43:56] a tax
[43:57] and um that's going to minimize how much
[44:00] you get back and your long-term
[44:02] investing you shouldn't be touching ever
[44:04] until your in your retirement years but
[44:07] tfsas can also be excellent for long
[44:09] term they're they kind of cover all the
[44:11] bases because like I said if this is
[44:13] going to grow for 45 50
[44:16] years that tax saving is massive um so I
[44:20] kind of recommend
[44:22] both um in
[44:24] parallel the the big brain strategy here
[44:28] is if you think you're going to make
[44:31] more money now while you're investing
[44:33] like if your tax if you think your tax
[44:35] ratees going to be higher today than it
[44:36] is when you retire you should probably
[44:38] put more money into your RSP because
[44:41] you're going to be getting a bigger tax
[44:42] advantage today if you think you're
[44:44] going to be making way more money in
[44:46] retirement like you're young and you
[44:48] think your income is just going to grow
[44:49] grow grow grow and by the time you
[44:50] retire you're going to be in the top
[44:52] bracket or something then a tfsa might
[44:54] be the better idea because your tax
[44:55] advantage is much bigger when you're in
[44:57] the higher tax bracket for
[45:00] tfsa sorry if you're taking it out in
[45:02] your higher tax bracket does that this
[45:05] one's pretty technical I'm open to
[45:08] questions does anybody have any
[45:09] clarifications or questions about
[45:12] this just seeing some semi-glazed
[45:15] looks um again I'm just trying to
[45:19] trigger your memories this is the kind
[45:21] of stuff there's pretty clear
[45:23] information online about how these pro
[45:25] programs work and every major bank will
[45:28] offer you this you can get tfsas and
[45:29] rsps at any Bank um also all the
[45:32] investing apps like wealth simple or
[45:34] Robinhood you can get registered
[45:36] accounts and all of those so this is not
[45:38] hard to do it's just as hard as opening
[45:40] a bank account opening an RSP so don't
[45:44] let that ever scare you away from
[45:49] investing you might have it in your
[45:51] slide the the first Home Savings Account
[45:54] It's a combination of DF I don't have
[45:57] that no no I don't actually understand
[45:59] that one very well it started last year
[46:01] 8,000 per year for those who wanted to
[46:04] buy their first home it will be like a
[46:07] tfsa but when you withdraw you don't
[46:09] need to return it to tfsa uh to your RSP
[46:12] then you not tax that all so you get the
[46:14] you get the RSP style benefit when you
[46:16] invest yes but you don't have to
[46:18] reinvest it when you take it out you
[46:20] don't need to pay taxes on it when you
[46:22] take it
[46:23] out it's a combination you get both yes
[46:26] you have both the the benefit of tfsa
[46:28] I'm sorry I didn't I didn't look into
[46:30] this one because uh I'm I'm a little bit
[46:32] um out of touch with that so I I'll have
[46:35] to do some research on this what's it
[46:36] called first Home Savings Account fhsa
[46:40] FHS okay so look up the fhsa if you have
[46:44] not bought a home yet if you're planning
[46:46] to buy one these guys yeah no these guys
[46:49] are all sitting
[46:51] on they got property in
[46:54] Dubai so what brother brother mvin is
[46:56] saying I have not read this yet so um do
[46:59] your own research but he's saying that
[47:00] like if you invest you get the tax
[47:02] benefit today of an RSP where you get a
[47:04] deduction on your taxes but when you
[47:06] take the money out to buy your first
[47:07] home you also don't get taxed on the
[47:09] returns that sounds like a win-win win
[47:11] to me if you're saving up for a home you
[47:15] should probably be doing that and the
[47:16] limit is 8,000 8,000 a year is what you
[47:18] can put in start in
[47:20] 2023 otherwise before if you have an RP
[47:24] and you want to withraw it you pay at$
[47:29] mhm and then you have to re you have to
[47:31] reinvest it as
[47:34] well a def
[47:36] tax no what I'm saying is that before
[47:39] this before this it's a def
[47:43] tax tax yet but you pay the tax when you
[47:47] are not 55 65 years okay if you withdraw
[47:51] the money before 65 now the bank we need
[47:55] you need to pay that tax ta that you did
[47:57] not pay and then you P penalty but now
[48:00] the government came and said that you
[48:02] don't have as far as you have an N you
[48:05] can go and take this money without going
[48:08] through
[48:12] this I think yeah I I think there might
[48:15] be a bit of differences here between
[48:17] like pensions RSP and then this fhsa I
[48:20] think we might have touched on all three
[48:21] of those right now but um for Simplicity
[48:24] I'm more so talking about your
[48:26] investment for retirement I don't have
[48:28] anything in here for buying your first
[48:29] home um but that is definitely something
[48:32] that obviously you need to save up for
[48:34] if you want to be getting one and that
[48:36] sounds like an amazing plan so I would
[48:38] definitely take advantage of the
[48:42] fhsa
[48:49] um okay I think I got all of
[48:53] that so after minimizing taxes
[48:57] then you want to think about minimizing
[48:59] fees this one is kind of a personal take
[49:02] so don't don't trust me as being like
[49:05] the expert because I'm not a financial
[49:08] planner um however this is something
[49:12] that I feel pretty pretty strong about
[49:16] um but it's just an opinion it's not um
[49:20] uh there there's not an absolute right
[49:22] or wrong to this direction it's more so
[49:25] your beliefs will direct how you invest
[49:28] in this so I mentioned mutual
[49:32] funds you can technically have a mutual
[49:35] fund and a and a t um an
[49:38] ETF that have very very similar plans
[49:41] and goals and aspirations but the way
[49:43] they're managed is the big difference so
[49:45] an RS or sorry a mutual fund is actively
[49:48] managed there's a bunch of nerds in an
[49:50] office somewhere calculating and finding
[49:53] the best assets and calling up Buy byy
[49:55] Buy sell sell so that's th that's those
[49:58] guys and because there's so many Nerds
[50:01] they they cost a lot of money their
[50:03] salaries are massive and uh they also
[50:06] get massive bonuses whenever you make
[50:08] money they make money so that's supposed
[50:10] to incentivize them to do the right
[50:11] thing right but they still make a lot
[50:13] more than you
[50:14] do
[50:16] so uh oh and also if they lose all your
[50:18] money they still make money which seems
[50:20] a little bit weird but anyways uh the
[50:24] active management side is very expensive
[50:27] so um on a on an investment a standard
[50:32] mutual fund 1.5 to 2.8% is is a pretty
[50:37] big spread Canada has some of the
[50:38] highest mutual fund fees in the industry
[50:40] in the world ours are averaging closer
[50:43] to
[50:44] 2.2% um if you work with a bank like RBC
[50:48] bimo that kind of stuff they're very
[50:50] very high and I'll show you in a graph
[50:52] soon you know I like graphs um how much
[50:55] this is going to erode your returns over
[50:57] time so if you think
[51:01] about a an asset manager you know
[51:04] targeting a 10% rate of return if he's
[51:06] charging you
[51:09] 2.8% how much do you get after it's all
[51:12] said and done you're getting like
[51:16] 7.2% so he is taking off the
[51:20] top from from everything that you make
[51:23] so you know some some asset managers are
[51:25] brilliant and they actually do make more
[51:28] money than the market but it's
[51:29] exceptionally
[51:31] rare only 12% this is from a study by
[51:36] the uh S&P or sorry the Dow Jones um
[51:40] Industrial Average they do like a survey
[51:43] of mutual funds twice a year and they
[51:47] found that 12% of actively managed funds
[51:51] were actually able to make more than the
[51:54] stock index which means you just put
[51:58] your money in this blind ETF and did
[52:00] nothing and nobody made any decisions
[52:02] the market went like this the mutual
[52:04] fund went like this and ended up lower
[52:07] than excuse me ended up lower than um
[52:11] than the market so you paid these nerds
[52:13] and they actually lost you money 88% of
[52:16] the time that's what happened 88% of the
[52:19] time they lost money not not lost money
[52:22] they they did not beat the market so
[52:25] what's the point um that's kind of My
[52:27] Philosophy again this is a personal take
[52:30] obviously this is a multi-trillion
[52:31] dollar market so there's a lot of people
[52:34] that believe in it um just my buddy
[52:38] Warren Buffett kind of agrees with me
[52:42] so um when you're looking at a mutual
[52:45] fund if you're thinking about investing
[52:47] in a mutual fund I just advise you to
[52:50] ask your um your investment manager
[52:52] whoever is giving you this advice what
[52:55] is the return before and after the fee
[52:59] it's called an me management expense
[53:02] ratio and um they might not want to tell
[53:05] you or if they're good they'll just be
[53:08] like oh yeah this is it and I've been
[53:09] showing you the after fee return this
[53:11] whole time and sometimes that's the case
[53:13] and that's great the other thing to
[53:15] consider though is how long has this
[53:19] Mark this fund been beating the market
[53:20] for they'll they'll say oh from you know
[53:23] 2020 when the market crashed till now
[53:26] these guys have been beating the market
[53:28] that's actually not super hard to do if
[53:30] you looked at what the what the Fed was
[53:31] doing pumping trillions of dollars into
[53:33] the industries and printing money and
[53:35] lowering interest rates I could have
[53:37] made a ton of money if I had somebody
[53:39] else's bucket load of cash to do it with
[53:42] so look at the timing it must be 10
[53:45] years at least if they have not been
[53:47] beating the market over a 10-year
[53:49] average don't believe that they're going
[53:51] to beat the market tomorrow um because
[53:54] there's not enough time for a full cycle
[53:56] to go through in less than 10 years you
[53:58] know there's all those booms and busts
[54:00] that's uh you want to capture all that
[54:03] exchange traded funds the fees that
[54:06] these charge are 100 times lower
[54:12] 0.02% to
[54:14] 0.5% so that's a pretty huge spread but
[54:17] the ones that I'm investing in they're
[54:20] 0.03% like extremely small and and yes
[54:23] they're technically coming off your
[54:25] return but they're so much smaller um uh
[54:28] as long as you believe in the plan that
[54:30] the ETF is setting out so these funds
[54:32] like I said before they just set rules
[54:34] they don't have people managing every
[54:36] day they just set a rule if this then
[54:38] that and there's no decision and that
[54:40] way it can be automated they have a lot
[54:42] of machines and programs doing this and
[54:43] not a lot of humans so it's much much
[54:46] cheaper but good or bad no matter what
[54:49] the market does they stick to their Rule
[54:51] and that's it so that's why that's why
[54:54] they're cheaper so this again thank you
[54:58] Chris this is a simulation that he built
[55:03] showing if you put
[55:06] $110,000 I believe this is
[55:09] over oh I don't I don't have the time
[55:11] Horizon here I think this might have
[55:13] been 25 years or
[55:15] something but uh if you put $10,000 in
[55:17] at the beginning and the market on
[55:20] average returned 7% over this
[55:23] time and the mutual fund returned 8 .5%
[55:27] so in this scenario which only 12% of
[55:30] the time is true the mutual fund beat
[55:33] the market by one and a half percent
[55:36] very good job the Nerds earned their pay
[55:39] um but after the mutual fund fees
[55:44] W you're
[55:46] here so these guys made more money the
[55:49] fund overall returned a higher return in
[55:51] the
[55:52] market but the managers took most not
[55:55] most but took a lot of your returns and
[55:58] because of the rule of compounding
[55:59] interest that I talked to you guys about
[56:01] you know as your investment grows you
[56:03] get more growth on the growth and then
[56:05] you get growth on the growth on the
[56:06] growth kind of like uh no I won't say um
[56:10] but they're
[56:12] uh yeah it's like gaining weight um so
[56:17] over here you can see right away when
[56:19] this starts to pull away the Blue Line
[56:21] starts to pull away from the orange it's
[56:23] basically over already because now every
[56:26] year they're working with more money and
[56:28] more money and more money and that just
[56:31] compounds over the course of 20 years
[56:34] and this is why I feel so strongly about
[56:38] ETFs um and so I just urge you if you're
[56:40] only invested in mutual funds just at
[56:42] least read into it don't take my word
[56:44] for it do some do a little bit of
[56:46] reading about what an ETF is if you I
[56:49] don't want to give any any individual
[56:51] names but the most popular things that
[56:53] people invest in here are just index
[56:55] funds
[56:56] so if you've ever heard about the TSX
[56:58] that's the Canada's like largest hund
[57:01] companies is it I think something like
[57:02] that the SNP 500 is the United States
[57:06] largest 500 companies the Dow Jones
[57:08] Industrial Average that's like um it's a
[57:11] certain segment of I think a 100
[57:13] companies and there's the uh NASDAQ
[57:17] that's high-tech more tech tech Focus
[57:20] companies so basically those indexes
[57:25] have already done all the work for you
[57:27] they have put together a list of the top
[57:30] blah companies for blah reason insert
[57:32] name here and you can just for
[57:36] 0.03% fee you can just put all your
[57:38] money into you know the ETFs that you
[57:40] believe in and they're Diversified if
[57:43] you're if you're buying into an index
[57:44] fund they're somewhat Diversified
[57:46] because like the S&P 500 is 500 of the
[57:49] largest companies in the United States
[57:52] um they're Diversified they are low fee
[57:56] and then you can use these in your tfsa
[57:58] or your RSP or probably your fhsa so
[58:01] they're quite flexible and if you're
[58:04] just you know picking individual stocks
[58:07] or you're only buying mutual funds or
[58:09] you're only using a savings account you
[58:11] could be leaving quite a bit of return
[58:12] on the table over the course of you know
[58:14] 20 years or whatever yes um so when
[58:17] you're investing do you want to look for
[58:20] a a fund that has pay
[58:25] dividends so she asked if you're
[58:28] investing do you want to look for a fund
[58:29] that pays dividends and I would say it
[58:31] depends on your stage of life where you
[58:36] are I as a you know what I'm
[58:40] still like relatively early in my
[58:43] process I would say I'm not too worried
[58:45] about dividends myself I'm more
[58:48] interested in growth so if I can get a
[58:50] fund that gives me you know a 5%
[58:53] dividend or a fund that gives me 7%
[58:56] growth I would rather take the growth
[58:59] because I don't need income at this
[59:00] stage however if you're anywhere like if
[59:03] you're within like 10 years of
[59:05] retirement I think dividends become more
[59:07] important than growth because you're
[59:09] going to get a fixed income off of these
[59:11] most companies will not reduce their
[59:13] dividends it's a Death Note to their
[59:14] value if they reduce dividends so they
[59:16] always want to maintain or grow
[59:18] dividends over time and you can live off
[59:21] those dividends um a a dividend is
[59:23] basically at the end of a quarter or or
[59:25] a
[59:26] year the companies who do declare
[59:28] dividends they're like Banks a lot of
[59:30] these lower growth but more stable um
[59:33] value stocks I think is what they're
[59:35] called they they can declare a dividend
[59:38] um and that dividend goes straight to
[59:40] shareholders so if you own 500 shares
[59:43] and they declare a five like a two cent
[59:46] dividend you get a th000 cents but you
[59:50] know uh over hundreds and thousands of
[59:53] of shares um that some somebody might
[59:56] own that can be your entire income so
[59:58] you can retire on only dividend income
[1:00:01] you get taxed differently as well
[1:00:02] there's different taxes for divid income
[1:00:04] which I don't understand well enough to
[1:00:06] talk about but um does that kind of
[1:00:09] answer your question I think it depends
[1:00:11] a little bit on what age you are or how
[1:00:13] far from retirement you
[1:00:16] are I do believe though everybody should
[1:00:18] have a little bit of everything at the
[1:00:19] end of the day you should have a mix um
[1:00:22] that's what diversification is all about
[1:00:23] if you only have growth stocks um and
[1:00:26] the market collapses you collapse with
[1:00:27] it so having a little bit of more stable
[1:00:29] dividend uh fixed income can definitely
[1:00:32] Shield you from
[1:00:34] that okay I think I'm done with all my
[1:00:36] pretty
[1:00:37] graphs uh just a couple more slides
[1:00:42] here so the next uh point was
[1:00:46] consistency so consistent monthly
[1:00:49] contributions we talked about making an
[1:00:51] automatic transfer from your account so
[1:00:54] personally um you know we have we have
[1:00:58] different Investments going to different
[1:00:59] things they're all automatic um but in
[1:01:02] the last two years or so I set up a
[1:01:04] wealth simple account and I love it
[1:01:06] honestly it's so easy to use um there's
[1:01:10] there's many other apps out there uh
[1:01:13] like Quest trade there's I don't know if
[1:01:15] Robin Hood is good for Canada or not but
[1:01:17] no um and there's another big one in
[1:01:20] Canada I can't remember the name of I
[1:01:24] sorry I
[1:01:27] that might be it ibkr anyways if you
[1:01:29] look if basically if you're in Canada
[1:01:32] and you're you're using an app like you
[1:01:34] need to have a you want to have a
[1:01:36] Canadian um not a Chartered Bank uh but
[1:01:40] you want to have it being a Canadian
[1:01:43] institution because in Canada we have
[1:01:44] Deposit Insurance for you know $250,000
[1:01:48] of your bank balance is insured by the
[1:01:50] government so if you're downloading an
[1:01:52] app that is international a you're
[1:01:54] probably going to have to fund it with
[1:01:55] US dollars or a different currency and
[1:01:58] then B you don't lo you don't get the
[1:01:59] deposit protection insurance but anyways
[1:02:03] for well simple I don't use it for
[1:02:05] banking at all I have an automatic
[1:02:07] transfer coming out into certain ETFs
[1:02:10] there and what what I personally love
[1:02:12] about it is it's so easy to just like
[1:02:14] pull up my phone any time of day and I
[1:02:16] can just pop and see what oh the market
[1:02:17] went up what's my investment doing okay
[1:02:20] I can see it that's pretty cool but for
[1:02:22] some people that can be a negative
[1:02:24] because if you have access to it you
[1:02:25] might be attempted to Tinker and be
[1:02:29] consistent don't panic when the market
[1:02:32] crashes don't sell in a crash if you are
[1:02:35] you know five plus years from retirement
[1:02:39] please do not react to a market crash
[1:02:41] it's a good thing for you if you're not
[1:02:44] selling so think about it if you're
[1:02:46] doing um the next uh the next bullet
[1:02:49] point here it's called dollar cost
[1:02:51] averaging I'll kind of give you a
[1:02:52] scenario to explain it if you're
[1:02:53] investing like in our example $416 a
[1:02:57] month and the market
[1:02:59] crashes and you're still investing $416
[1:03:02] a month what do you think is happening
[1:03:04] to your investment say you're buying
[1:03:07] shares that cost $100 a share and then
[1:03:11] the market crashes to $50 a share you're
[1:03:14] buying twice as many shares and if
[1:03:17] you're not selling in the next few years
[1:03:20] who cares keep buying at that lower rate
[1:03:23] you're literally getting a sale and so
[1:03:26] don't sell in the middle of a crash
[1:03:28] Market um it's not uh you know it's it's
[1:03:32] generally nearly impossible to time the
[1:03:35] market that's what the Nerds are trying
[1:03:36] to do and 88% of the time the very very
[1:03:39] well-paid very very well educated people
[1:03:42] cannot do it so I don't think I have a
[1:03:45] chance maybe you have an anointing or
[1:03:48] you you have an inside loop or something
[1:03:50] and and like that's I think I think if
[1:03:52] you understand an industry very very
[1:03:54] well like brother mvin knows a lot about
[1:03:56] oil and gas he's probably one of the
[1:03:58] very few people that could actually
[1:04:00] predict and time things in his industry
[1:04:03] because if you have a super solid
[1:04:05] connection with the value of your
[1:04:07] industry you can probably do a lot
[1:04:08] better than most other people can in
[1:04:10] that same industry for me though I don't
[1:04:12] understand any industry well enough to
[1:04:14] make stock picks so I just go into the
[1:04:17] index and when the index crashes I just
[1:04:19] keep buying because I'm not selling so I
[1:04:21] don't really uh I'm not worried about it
[1:04:22] at all and when it goes up I'm not
[1:04:25] really selling
[1:04:26] either uh some some people buy more in a
[1:04:30] hot market and I understand the
[1:04:33] emotional aspect of that because like oh
[1:04:35] it's going up I want to get in but if
[1:04:37] you're not selling you're now paying a
[1:04:40] premium and you don't know if that
[1:04:42] Market's going to slide down tomorrow
[1:04:43] like if you look at the last five years
[1:04:46] uh speaking of
[1:04:49] which this is from 2014 to
[1:04:54] 2023 look at all these crashes and
[1:04:57] valleys and
[1:04:59] mountains there are a million reasons to
[1:05:01] sell here's 31 of them so US Stocks flat
[1:05:06] for 20 months that happened here look
[1:05:09] what happened right after that so if you
[1:05:11] would have sold because you were
[1:05:12] depressed about the flat Market you
[1:05:14] would have lost all this return or what
[1:05:17] about if you bought at the top of this
[1:05:19] peak because oh the Market's hot it's
[1:05:20] going up I better buy in and then it
[1:05:22] goes down it's better generally safe
[1:05:26] to just have a budget for how much
[1:05:27] you're going to invest and just stick to
[1:05:29] your plan unless you're investing into a
[1:05:31] specific niche market that could go away
[1:05:34] forever like if you're if you're really
[1:05:36] into Ai and then the world finds out oh
[1:05:39] shoot AI is not actually worth what we
[1:05:41] thought it was that's the only time you
[1:05:43] might actually be a bit uncomfortable
[1:05:45] with Market crashes because you could
[1:05:47] lose everything uh like if you're in
[1:05:49] Enron in the turn of the century that
[1:05:51] was a bad day um but look at this uh
[1:05:57] uh UK Russian Ukraine war happened
[1:06:01] here and look how much like everybody
[1:06:04] thought this is going to this is going
[1:06:05] to drag down the market Commodities are
[1:06:07] going to are going to go through the
[1:06:08] roof energy is going to be unaffordable
[1:06:10] for everybody my utilities now are
[1:06:12] cheaper than they've ever been and uh
[1:06:14] obviously I don't live in Europe so I'm
[1:06:16] much more shielded than they are but the
[1:06:18] point is there's bad news almost every
[1:06:20] single day and this is only a 10year
[1:06:23] cycle um so
[1:06:26] believe that if you invest for 10 years
[1:06:28] you're going to see your money go down
[1:06:29] many many times just don't panic stick
[1:06:32] to your plan and see it
[1:06:34] through going back for one second I like
[1:06:37] this idea um making a game out of
[1:06:40] investing so if you have a hard time
[1:06:43] putting money away consistently I think
[1:06:46] it could be an interesting concept
[1:06:48] especially maybe if you have children to
[1:06:51] incentivize them like you know once you
[1:06:55] maybe set a quarterly or an annual goal
[1:06:57] or something like that and you say hey
[1:07:00] if you invest or if I if you're talking
[1:07:02] to yourself if you make all the rules
[1:07:03] yourself if I invest 200 bucks a month
[1:07:07] for three months in a row I get to
[1:07:10] go buy a new pair of shoes or I get to
[1:07:14] add $50 a month to my my eating out
[1:07:17] budget this month and you can you can
[1:07:19] like you know if you've got the cash you
[1:07:20] can afford it because you've been so
[1:07:21] good to your future um so I I really
[1:07:25] like this idea if somebody's having a
[1:07:27] hard time just getting started um I
[1:07:29] think this could be a good way to just
[1:07:31] kind of give yourself a little bit of a
[1:07:33] kick in the pants and make it
[1:07:36] fun this is um maybe a bit
[1:07:39] controversial but this is something that
[1:07:41] Mom and Dad's financial planner told me
[1:07:43] a long long time ago and it just is kind
[1:07:46] of trying to tap into human nature and
[1:07:48] your own personal
[1:07:50] psyche and uh he actually said if you're
[1:07:53] having a hard time investing
[1:07:55] um
[1:07:57] borrow borrow a little bit of money to
[1:08:00] pay for something other than investing
[1:08:03] and then invest the money you were going
[1:08:04] to use for that so don't leverage your
[1:08:06] investing because that's risky and very
[1:08:08] dangerous but uh for example we had um
[1:08:12] you know like things things coming up we
[1:08:14] had a line of credit
[1:08:17] and we were trying to decide if we could
[1:08:19] afford to buy like I think a certain
[1:08:21] amount of life insurance for me and
[1:08:23] maybe some
[1:08:24] Investments because had a car that was
[1:08:26] kind of on the
[1:08:27] fritz so instead of I I was thinking I
[1:08:30] can't really afford to commit to
[1:08:32] investing because I don't want to start
[1:08:33] and stop once I start I never want to
[1:08:35] stop I just want to leave that money and
[1:08:36] keep it going in there every
[1:08:38] month but I didn't want to because of my
[1:08:40] car so he said well um you sound like
[1:08:43] the kind of person who doesn't let debt
[1:08:47] get out of control and if this is you
[1:08:49] this might be applicable if not stay
[1:08:51] away uh but I am that way if I see debt
[1:08:54] I'm just crushing it as soon as as I can
[1:08:55] I'm I'm pulling out you know personal
[1:08:57] spending I'm pulling out entertainment
[1:08:59] I'm pulling out a lot of like travel
[1:09:02] everything I'm going to cut my cost
[1:09:03] until I get rid of that debt and um so
[1:09:07] what we did was I ended up committing to
[1:09:09] this investment and then when the car
[1:09:11] needed a fix I used my line of credit
[1:09:13] for like the $300 part or whatever it
[1:09:14] was and I crushed that like within a
[1:09:17] couple months I got rid of it but it
[1:09:19] allowed me to kind of get into this
[1:09:21] habit and um you know over time we got a
[1:09:25] little bit of emergency account and you
[1:09:26] know how it is like unexpected stuff
[1:09:28] comes up and instead of robbing my
[1:09:31] investment account you know instead of
[1:09:33] stopping my investment when covid
[1:09:35] happened this happened to me I lost
[1:09:37] about 80% of my income in one week and
[1:09:40] it and it was gone for like six seven
[1:09:43] months it was extremely dire and so we
[1:09:46] stopped everything we stopped our
[1:09:48] mortgage payment we stopped our
[1:09:49] utilities payment we called our phone
[1:09:51] company we called everybody we owed
[1:09:53] money to and they allowed us to stop
[1:09:56] payments indefinitely until I had work
[1:09:59] again and um the one thing we didn't
[1:10:02] stop was investing and that was just
[1:10:04] because of the principle of how hard it
[1:10:07] is to restart an optional payment if
[1:10:11] it's optional You'll Always Find a
[1:10:13] reason to option out because you know
[1:10:15] you want to have something else or
[1:10:16] something else goes wrong but I knew I
[1:10:18] had to pay my phone bill eventually I
[1:10:20] knew my mortgage was going to need to be
[1:10:22] paid and that's why we paused those
[1:10:24] things we definitely could have paused
[1:10:26] our investments that we're fully within
[1:10:28] our rights to but I pulled strings to
[1:10:31] make my debt pause and I paid interest
[1:10:34] on them I had to keep paying interest on
[1:10:35] those those those debts but um I think
[1:10:38] the principle
[1:10:40] was force yourself find a way if you
[1:10:43] know yourself if you know what makes you
[1:10:45] tick find a way to manipulate your your
[1:10:48] mindset to get into investing in a
[1:10:51] consistent basis and just don't let it
[1:10:52] stop if something comes up try to find
[1:10:55] something else to cut obviously if
[1:10:57] you're in a really bad place you don't
[1:10:59] want to be living on credit cards and
[1:11:00] lines of credit because you're still
[1:11:03] investing you're going backwards at that
[1:11:05] point um but within reason I just wanted
[1:11:08] to throw that out there as like you know
[1:11:10] making a game out of it also manipulate
[1:11:13] yourself to uh to make sure you're
[1:11:19] investing so I don't want to get into
[1:11:21] this too much this is super high level
[1:11:24] but
[1:11:25] just really really briefly touching on
[1:11:29] these I've been I've mentioned a few
[1:11:31] times that you should change your
[1:11:32] investment over time so when you're
[1:11:35] living at home save as much as you can
[1:11:38] um use that first time uh for for first
[1:11:41] Home Savings Account
[1:11:43] fhsa um save for for marriage you know
[1:11:46] if you want to be able to uh get engaged
[1:11:51] to somebody or something like that
[1:11:52] there's there's a lot of cost believe me
[1:11:53] for that that transaction
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:57] um and then of course there's retirement
[1:11:59] as well but when you're living at home
[1:12:01] you're not all you're not only thinking
[1:12:02] about your long-term future you need you
[1:12:04] have short-term goals that you need to
[1:12:06] fit you need to probably get a car you
[1:12:07] need to get a house of some sort or rent
[1:12:10] a house um there's there's a you need
[1:12:13] one month of rent in advance before you
[1:12:14] start renting so that's uh almost a
[1:12:17] couple grand these
[1:12:18] days so what I'm trying to say is don't
[1:12:22] be spending all your money on food and
[1:12:24] games and clothes
[1:12:26] make it minimum 20% if you're living at
[1:12:29] home I think that should be the absolute
[1:12:31] minimum personally and you know if
[1:12:33] you're only making like 50 bucks a month
[1:12:36] well then you don't have a lot of money
[1:12:37] to spend get a job but uh when you're
[1:12:41] when you're living at home I don't think
[1:12:43] there's many excuses to spend all your
[1:12:44] money I think it's uh I think it's quite
[1:12:46] wasteful um and be good to your future
[1:12:50] you know when you're five years down the
[1:12:51] road you're going to be so happy that
[1:12:55] you can afford to do things and that you
[1:12:57] can afford to get into maybe a house or
[1:12:59] something like that um yeah it's uh I
[1:13:03] shoulda have Andy and Ben talk about
[1:13:06] this I when you guys were like saving
[1:13:09] every penny that you found yeah these
[1:13:12] guys were saving like 99% of their
[1:13:14] income it was uh
[1:13:18] remarkable still do no maybe sometimes
[1:13:22] no
[1:13:27] oh man so so next living at home you
[1:13:31] might still be living at home at this
[1:13:32] point but it's a different phase when
[1:13:34] you're not at school anymore when you're
[1:13:36] when you have a career you have a
[1:13:37] full-time job um if you're if you're
[1:13:40] still living at home and you have a
[1:13:42] full-time job boost your savings up like
[1:13:45] way much um I would
[1:13:49] say try to try to do some math with
[1:13:51] yourself to find out I was making $200 a
[1:13:54] month casually while I was in school now
[1:13:56] I'm making $2,000 a month somehow with
[1:13:58] with my
[1:13:59] job you know save $1,800 of that or
[1:14:03] something give yourself a 100% of your
[1:14:05] pre career income as as spending money
[1:14:08] just for fun but please do not just go
[1:14:11] buying cars and all that kind of stuff
[1:14:12] right away um there are principles I
[1:14:15] think that we talked about in our first
[1:14:16] presentation about how much of your
[1:14:17] income you should spend on your first
[1:14:19] car um there's uh there's there's good
[1:14:22] principles to put in place to keep
[1:14:24] yourself under control and if you just
[1:14:25] kind of become a person of principles it
[1:14:27] doesn't matter how much you're making or
[1:14:29] spending because your principles will
[1:14:30] guide your decisions every step of the
[1:14:32] way but if you're not living at home and
[1:14:35] you're in your early career I think you
[1:14:36] should just kind of try to hit that 10%
[1:14:39] Like 99% of people aren't doing that so
[1:14:42] you are in the v like way at the very
[1:14:45] top if you're investing 10% of your
[1:14:46] income but it's not that hard it's it's
[1:14:49] not impossible to do it is hard to do
[1:14:51] when you're in your early career um but
[1:14:53] it's not impossible so try to invest 10%
[1:14:56] I would personally say growth stocks are
[1:14:58] likely what you're looking for something
[1:15:00] that's going to grow with the market and
[1:15:01] not be super stable because you've got
[1:15:03] so much time to recover and like I said
[1:15:05] if it crashes keep buying it on sale as
[1:15:07] long as you believe that it will
[1:15:09] eventually recover then uh that's what
[1:15:11] you're looking
[1:15:12] for so when you're early in your career
[1:15:14] you can afford to take a lot of risk
[1:15:15] with your Investments uh I'm not saying
[1:15:17] to bet the farm on something that could
[1:15:19] go to zero I'm just saying to get into
[1:15:20] Investments that are more like this but
[1:15:22] are going up over time um same with your
[1:15:25] career you know you can try something be
[1:15:27] creative do something entrepreneurial or
[1:15:29] take a risky job that you think you know
[1:15:31] might not work out but it's challenging
[1:15:33] and exciting and could pay off once you
[1:15:37] are in your mid-career I would say try
[1:15:39] to invest um if if you want to retire
[1:15:43] with the same lifestyle you have now in
[1:15:46] your midcareer you need to be closer to
[1:15:49] 15% of your income net
[1:15:51] income if you expect that you're going
[1:15:53] to be able to cut your lifestock when
[1:15:55] you retire then you can stick at
[1:15:57] 10%
[1:15:59] um and again you're still looking for a
[1:16:02] diver always a diverse portfolio but
[1:16:04] probably growth is still your primary
[1:16:06] motive a little bit more of the value as
[1:16:08] well like the dividend stocks late
[1:16:10] career in your 50s um keep investing try
[1:16:14] to keep it around that 15% again and um
[1:16:17] reduce your risk so this is where you're
[1:16:20] starting to go a little bit closer to
[1:16:22] value stocks and fix fixed income
[1:16:26] and then pre-retirement
[1:16:28] transition again this is just my
[1:16:32] personal feelings I I think at if you're
[1:16:34] in your pre-retirement you should
[1:16:35] definitely have U an investment planner
[1:16:37] or a guide some professional who's
[1:16:39] helping you plan for how you're going to
[1:16:41] withdraw your income when you retire
[1:16:43] this is just a benchmark guideline it's
[1:16:46] not at all like a good um fit for
[1:16:48] everyone but start to transition
[1:16:51] approximately 60% of your existing
[1:16:53] investments into low risk because now
[1:16:55] you're at the point where very soon you
[1:16:58] will not have income anymore you'll be
[1:16:59] on a fixed income based on what you
[1:17:01] saved and um if you're still in Risky
[1:17:05] stuff and you need to go buy groceries
[1:17:08] tomorrow and your Bitcoin crashes well
[1:17:12] so so much for your groceries um so
[1:17:15] start to get into more steady
[1:17:17] Investments they're not going to grow
[1:17:19] very much but they're going to be there
[1:17:20] for you then once you're in your
[1:17:22] retirement you're truly on a fixed
[1:17:24] income you cannot recoup any losses keep
[1:17:27] your Investments consistent and never
[1:17:30] risk your principle
[1:17:32] I've I've been close to some really
[1:17:35] really awful stories when I was working
[1:17:37] at the bank of people who thought this
[1:17:39] was a great opportunity their grandson
[1:17:43] gave them a tip or asked them to invest
[1:17:46] and they lost you know like the last
[1:17:49] five years of their life's income in
[1:17:52] this investment how how do you live I I
[1:17:56] don't know
[1:17:57] like you're you're going on welfare at
[1:18:00] that point because you risked your
[1:18:01] principle much much better to you know
[1:18:05] go to the food bank once in a while and
[1:18:07] have a lower income that you understand
[1:18:10] than to risk it on something that is
[1:18:12] unlikely to pay off and could in fact
[1:18:13] lose you
[1:18:17] everything last Point these are things I
[1:18:20] didn't want to get into today but things
[1:18:22] you should probably consider if you're
[1:18:23] if you're um uh later a little bit later
[1:18:26] in your in your investment
[1:18:30] planning if you're looking at in real
[1:18:32] estate that's a whole another topic how
[1:18:34] do you start to invest in real estate
[1:18:36] there's actually quite a few Real Estate
[1:18:37] Investors in the in the the church well
[1:18:39] quite a few there there's a handful so
[1:18:41] like if you're looking for any advice or
[1:18:43] input there are people that you can talk
[1:18:45] to in the message how much do you need
[1:18:47] to retire this is a topic I didn't want
[1:18:49] to get into today just because it takes
[1:18:51] some time but it is something you know
[1:18:53] if if people if people want I could do
[1:18:55] another session I don't feel like it's
[1:18:58] it's going to cause a lot of hazed eyes
[1:18:59] in the young people but if you know how
[1:19:01] much you need to retire you can
[1:19:03] understand how much you need to invest
[1:19:05] today and so Crystal and I started with
[1:19:07] this we didn't know we we we we talked
[1:19:10] to an investment planner and we made
[1:19:12] something up but it gave us a goal and a
[1:19:14] guide and that uh that 10% is a good
[1:19:17] Baseline if you don't know but you can
[1:19:19] get much more accurate if you plan it
[1:19:21] out something we didn't talk about at
[1:19:23] all how does old age security and Canada
[1:19:25] pension plan impact your savings there's
[1:19:29] a lot of different timings you can start
[1:19:30] to take those out at 65 or if you delay
[1:19:33] it to 70 they go up why should you or
[1:19:36] when should you things to think about is
[1:19:39] your um bank or investment adviser
[1:19:41] trustworthy to help you invest I just
[1:19:44] put this in there because the easiest
[1:19:46] way to invest is to go to your Banker
[1:19:48] just like a any retail bank and say I
[1:19:50] have $500 to invest they'll put you down
[1:19:52] with somebody else and he'll hear will
[1:19:55] say hey this looks good or they'll ask
[1:19:57] you questions like how much risk you can
[1:19:58] you can take and that kind of stuff and
[1:20:00] then they'll they'll recommend something
[1:20:01] for you they have a Fisher duty to
[1:20:05] recommend the best advice for
[1:20:08] you how many times does that
[1:20:10] happen I worked in a bank and trust me
[1:20:15] they are not in it for you they are
[1:20:18] there to make their sales targets and
[1:20:20] every month there's a new flavor that
[1:20:23] has the highest return for them and they
[1:20:26] will try to find a way to fit your
[1:20:28] square peg in the round hole until it
[1:20:31] works and you know there's great Bankers
[1:20:34] there's a lot of very very honest really
[1:20:38] sincere people out there generally they
[1:20:41] have some gray hair though like if
[1:20:42] you're working with a young Banker
[1:20:45] chances are they just want to hit their
[1:20:46] target and become the salesperson of the
[1:20:48] month or something like that and it's um
[1:20:51] it's really sad because I would say I
[1:20:53] don't know I don't have a number but I
[1:20:54] would guess that it has to be the vast
[1:20:56] majority of people are investing through
[1:20:57] their bank and they just don't really
[1:21:00] understand you well enough or care
[1:21:03] they're trying to hit their own sales
[1:21:04] targets everybody that sells you
[1:21:05] something makes makes something off of
[1:21:07] it just remember that and be skeptical
[1:21:09] I'm not saying your person is a liar uh
[1:21:11] I'm just saying be a little bit
[1:21:13] skeptical whenever they advise you
[1:21:15] something challenge them a little
[1:21:17] bit um should you borrow money for
[1:21:19] leverage investing very likely not um
[1:21:22] but there are some scenarios
[1:21:25] I.E real estate business um other
[1:21:28] Ventures where it could make sense um
[1:21:31] and then should you buy life insurance
[1:21:33] and if yes what type of insurance should
[1:21:35] you be getting into so these are all
[1:21:37] questions that I would say if you've
[1:21:39] never thought about these do take some
[1:21:42] time to think and it it just starts by
[1:21:44] tomorrow morning send an email to
[1:21:46] somebody you know just take pick a topic
[1:21:49] and send somebody an email asking hey
[1:21:50] how do I start this conversation and
[1:21:53] they'll they'll give you some info um if
[1:21:55] you don't know anybody ask somebody you
[1:21:57] know uh hey do you know somebody who who
[1:21:59] could help me out with insurance or
[1:22:00] whatever um because referrals are always
[1:22:03] always a little bit safer than just
[1:22:05] calling somebody randomly or going off a
[1:22:07] social media
[1:22:09] ad finally
[1:22:11] remember wherefore if God so clothe the
[1:22:14] grass of the field which today is and
[1:22:16] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[1:22:18] not much more clothe
[1:22:20] you oh you have little faith take no
[1:22:24] thoughts saying what shall we eat or
[1:22:25] what shall we drink or wherewith All
[1:22:27] Shall we be clothed for after all these
[1:22:29] things do the Gentiles seek your
[1:22:31] heavenly father knows that you have need
[1:22:32] of these things but seek ye first the
[1:22:34] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:22:37] all these things shall be added unto you
[1:22:39] take therefore no thought for the moral
[1:22:41] for the morrow shall take thought to the
[1:22:43] for the things of itself sufficient unto
[1:22:45] the day is the evil
[1:22:49] thereof all right that is it
[1:22:56] [Applause]
[1:23:00] does anybody want Q&A or should we
[1:23:03] just sure okay
[1:23:06] but
[1:23:08] I I do a
[1:23:11] lot
[1:23:13] very
[1:23:17] and
[1:23:19] well so for a person like me who's not
[1:23:22] using any
[1:23:25] or any s directed I was hoping you just
[1:23:30] out some suggestions
[1:23:34] some blame thank you thank
[1:23:38] you yeah so brother Manuel was just uh
[1:23:41] asking for somebody who doesn't have any
[1:23:44] ideas to where to start for investing
[1:23:46] and you don't have a banker or an
[1:23:47] investment adviser he just asked if I
[1:23:49] could throw out a name of some some
[1:23:52] asset that you could maybe look at
[1:23:55] so
[1:23:56] personally
[1:23:58] I I'm probably putting around like 50%
[1:24:03] of my of my new money into just an S&P
[1:24:07] 500 in index um so that market that
[1:24:12] graph that I showed you this is Happ
[1:24:13] like the last 10 years all the bad news
[1:24:15] and reasons you should sell that was the
[1:24:17] S&P 500 okay um so I would highly invest
[1:24:21] looking at an ETF exchange traded fund m
[1:24:24] for the S&P 500 and just understand what
[1:24:27] it is if you're if you're interested in
[1:24:29] investing in it um for younger people
[1:24:32] who are maybe have more time and or more
[1:24:34] risk appetite the NASDAQ is is a very
[1:24:37] similar index but it's heavily weighted
[1:24:39] towards technology stocks that grow way
[1:24:42] faster but also crash harder um the TSX
[1:24:46] index is the Canadian version and Canada
[1:24:50] just has you know we're very exposed to
[1:24:51] resources I think oil and gas is like
[1:24:53] 20% % of those companies or something in
[1:24:55] the TSX it's quite quite high so if you
[1:24:58] want to be invested in Canadian stuff or
[1:25:00] if you have more faith in the energy
[1:25:02] energy sector
[1:25:05] um then after that I would
[1:25:09] probably look at just like really
[1:25:11] conservative things like if you want
[1:25:13] more safety these are all all the ones
[1:25:14] that I just mentioned are very like
[1:25:18] volatile but they they represent the
[1:25:20] whole market so over time unless we go
[1:25:23] into apocalypse they will continue to to
[1:25:25] go up so it barring those I would
[1:25:28] probably look at um some
[1:25:33] like I I don't have a specific name off
[1:25:35] the top of my head but like a value fund
[1:25:38] or a value ETF and these will be ETFs
[1:25:41] with again very low fees that track an
[1:25:43] index that is more focused on like Banks
[1:25:46] like you can do a bank ETF it buys like
[1:25:49] all the banks in North America and holds
[1:25:51] them and banks are stereotypically very
[1:25:53] stable they go up very slowly but they
[1:25:56] don't go down so that's kind of where I
[1:25:59] would start um so you don't do
[1:26:01] individual none names I don't do any
[1:26:04] individual stocks no I'm not smart
[1:26:06] enough for that I lost uh a lot of money
[1:26:09] at the beginning when I did
[1:26:12] that okay that's
[1:26:16] smart I forget what they were even I not
[1:26:19] not not even by M's thing no once I
[1:26:24] learned brother mvin was getting
[1:26:25] promoted I sold everything
[1:26:27] oh all right no but I don't have any
[1:26:30] individual stocks no no
[1:26:33] no I saw yeah I saw
[1:26:38] question just hold it in your face I
[1:26:40] guess um is it a good choice to invest
[1:26:44] in I mean put money in both um r one
[1:26:50] minute r r RSB n dfsa
[1:26:55] yeah I think uh especially when you're
[1:26:57] when you're starting out the question
[1:26:59] was is it good to put money in a tfsa
[1:27:01] and an
[1:27:02] RSP and um it is that's a pretty
[1:27:07] complicated discussion as to which one
[1:27:10] is better and if you don't know which
[1:27:12] one is better for you because of you
[1:27:14] know I don't know which one's better for
[1:27:15] me I personally I think right now my
[1:27:19] income is is fairly high so my taxes are
[1:27:23] fairly High I don't think I'll be making
[1:27:24] this much necessarily when I'm retired
[1:27:27] so for me now I'm transitioning more
[1:27:30] into rsps at the moment only because I
[1:27:33] don't think I'll have this much income
[1:27:35] when I'm retired so for somebody who
[1:27:38] doesn't know though like for for you at
[1:27:40] your age I would probably say taxfree
[1:27:43] savings account because your income is
[1:27:45] is likely not high enough that you're
[1:27:47] going to be triggering a lot of taxes
[1:27:48] anyways so if you invest into an RSP and
[1:27:51] your tax bill at the end of an entire
[1:27:53] year is you know
[1:27:56] $500 and you invest into an RSP like you
[1:27:59] cannot possibly get 100% of your your
[1:28:02] your taxes back so the most you're going
[1:28:03] to get is maybe $100 or so so I think
[1:28:06] that that is not as valuable to somebody
[1:28:09] who's uh who's younger um once your once
[1:28:12] your taxes start to get into like the
[1:28:14] thousands or tens of thousands that's
[1:28:17] when rsps become pretty powerful because
[1:28:19] you can do what I talked about here
[1:28:20] where you reinvest your return so does
[1:28:23] that answer your question yeah what's
[1:28:25] the age for RP investor I think you have
[1:28:27] to be 18 for either tfsa any any
[1:28:30] registered investor I think I just lost
[1:28:32] my mic is it
[1:28:35] 18 18 yeah yeah and that's another Point
[1:28:39] too with the children that are under
[1:28:41] under 18 years old I think they don't
[1:28:43] pay taxes until you're 18 or something
[1:28:47] like that well so they should look into
[1:28:49] it because they can really invest that
[1:28:51] money into your tfsas
[1:28:54] um and I think you're allowed 6,500 a
[1:28:58] year or something in your tfas but they
[1:29:00] can really gain a lot of investment room
[1:29:04] by investing when they don't have to pay
[1:29:06] taxes or do you pay taxes if you're over
[1:29:09] 18,000 a year or 20 30,000 there's a lot
[1:29:14] of room in there for young ones to make
[1:29:17] money and not be paying taxes and
[1:29:19] investing money just one clarification
[1:29:21] you don't get t tfsa room until you're
[1:29:24] 18 yes so you after you turn 18 you
[1:29:27] start acre whatever the annual limit is
[1:29:31] I think there was 7500 this year maybe
[1:29:33] so for me I was 18 when they started so
[1:29:36] I have $95,000 of contribution room I
[1:29:40] did have a note in there I didn't make a
[1:29:41] big deal out of it uh but for rsps and
[1:29:45] tfsas you need to check your
[1:29:47] contribution limits before you start and
[1:29:50] that'll be on your tax return so if you
[1:29:51] have not gotten a tax return yet you
[1:29:53] don't have any cont contribution room
[1:29:54] either uh unless you're 18 and for some
[1:29:57] reason have never had a tax bill um so
[1:30:00] when you're when you're getting when
[1:30:02] you're paying taxes you'll have a RSP
[1:30:05] contribution limit that'll show up on
[1:30:06] your T4 I think it is or maybe your T1
[1:30:09] okay yeah and then your tfsa every year
[1:30:12] regardless of if you make money or not
[1:30:14] once you're 18 you get contribution room
[1:30:16] every single year so like guys like
[1:30:18] Daniel and Miles you you you probably
[1:30:21] have like you know 30 $40,000 of
[1:30:23] contribution room or something like that
[1:30:25] in your uh in your and they're maxed out
[1:30:28] I believe
[1:30:31] right
[1:30:35] yeah uh yeah so and I I don't know what
[1:30:38] the minimum income is for taxes I feel
[1:30:40] like you have 18,000 before you start
[1:30:42] paying taxes something like that like
[1:30:44] it's not very very high but um once you
[1:30:47] start making you know more than a
[1:30:48] basically more than $1,200 a month
[1:30:50] you'll probably start to have a tax bill
[1:30:52] did you have a question
[1:30:54] um I'm just
[1:30:57] wondering who you would suggest for um
[1:31:01] like what companies well simply was
[1:31:02] mentioned what are some of the other
[1:31:04] options to get into the
[1:31:05] ETFs yeah so for ETFs um I would really
[1:31:10] that's a good question
[1:31:12] because as with anything there are some
[1:31:16] ETFs that are just so small there's so
[1:31:20] little money in them that there is a
[1:31:22] chance that everybody just pull pulls
[1:31:24] out and like it's not like you would
[1:31:25] lose all your money they would have to
[1:31:28] redistribute I believe I'm I'm not
[1:31:30] certain exactly how those work but um I
[1:31:34] would stick to big big names personally
[1:31:37] so Vanguard is a big U distributor of
[1:31:41] ETFs Black Rock okay Bank of
[1:31:44] Montreal um there are certainly others
[1:31:47] but I I guarantee you in those three
[1:31:49] companies they will have every ETF Under
[1:31:51] the Sun there are thousands of thousands
[1:31:54] and thousands of ETFs so and and like
[1:31:57] for the one ones that I mentioned uh
[1:31:59] like the S&P 500 there's probably 50
[1:32:02] variants of the exact same thing just
[1:32:05] just managed by different companies
[1:32:07] because they have slightly different
[1:32:08] fees or maybe they redistribute at a
[1:32:12] different time of month okay very very
[1:32:14] small differences but you know if I was
[1:32:16] comparing if say I wanted to get the ETF
[1:32:19] for S&P 500 and I was saying which one
[1:32:22] do I get I would look at the lowest fee
[1:32:26] with the highest um like
