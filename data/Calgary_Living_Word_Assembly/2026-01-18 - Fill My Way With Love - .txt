Description:
Let me walk blessed Lord
In the way Thou hast gone
Leading straight to the land above
Giving cheer everywhere
To the sad and the lone
Fill my way every day with love

CHORUS
Fill my way every day with love
As I walk with the heavenly dove
Let me go all the while
With a song and a smile
Fill my way every day with love

Keep me close to the side 
Of my Saviour and guide
Let me never in darkness rove
Keep my path free from wrath
And my soul satisfied
Fill my way every day with love

Soon the race will be o'er
And I'll travel no more
But abide in my home above
Let me sing blessed King
All the way to the shore
Fill my way every day with love
