[0:05] I'm not a singer at all but I um had
[0:08] this song impressed on my heart this
[0:10] morning after Barry was
[0:11] speaking and um I know brother Ferron
[0:14] has sang it I sang this years ago
[0:16] so I will not do it the same just as he
[0:18] does but I just really felt to sing it
[0:20] so it's um it's a Joyful Noise tonight
[0:27] [Music]
[0:38] oh
[0:43] the room goes down as she made her way
[0:48] to Jesus
[0:50] stumbled through the tears that made her
[0:54] blind
[0:56] [Music]
[0:58] she felt such pain
[1:01] pain
[1:02] some spoken anger
[1:05] hurtful's whisper there's no place here
[1:08] for her kind
[1:11] [Music]
[1:13] still on she came
[1:16] through the shame that flushed her face
[1:19] until it last she knelt before his feet
[1:29] and though she spoke no words everything
[1:33] she said was heard as she poured her
[1:38] love for the master from her box of
[1:43] alabaster
[1:47] and I've come to
[1:50] pour my praise on him like oil
[1:55] from Mary's Alabaster Box
[1:59] to kneel before him wash my feet with my
[2:04] tears and dry them with my head
[2:11] it was there
[2:14] the night he found
[2:19] when he came to my side and rubbed his
[2:23] love all around me I know Jesus knew the
[2:29] cost
[2:30] of the oil in my Alabaster Box
[2:36] [Music]
[2:42] I can't forget
[2:45] the way life used to be I was a prisoner
[2:51] to the sin that had me back
[2:57] I spent my days
[3:00] pouring life without measure to a little
[3:05] treasure box I thought I'd found
[3:12] until the day when Jesus came to me and
[3:18] healed my soul with the Wander of his
[3:23] time
[3:25] so I'm giving back to him all the praise
[3:31] He's Worthy
[3:33] I've been forgiven and that's why I love
[3:38] him so much
[3:41] much
[3:42] I've come to
[3:45] pour my praise on him
[3:50] [Music]
[3:53] to kneel before him and wash his feet
[3:58] with my tears and draw them with my
[4:03] hands
[4:05] it was there
[4:08] for the night he found me when he came
[4:14] to my side and wrapped his love all
[4:18] around me I knew Jesus knew the cost of
[4:24] my world in my Alabaster
[4:28] Box
[4:30] it was
[4:32] there the night he found me when he came
[4:39] to my side and round his love all around
[4:44] me I knew Jesus knew the cost of my oil
[4:52] only Jesus knows the cost of your oil
[4:58] in your Alabaster
[5:06] [Applause]
