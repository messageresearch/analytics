name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you musicians you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to read from Isaiah chapter 60. I've just been getting a real thrill a real inspiration out of the prophet Isaiah it's wonderful I forgot to mention this a little while ago if anybody has lost a ring two rings to be particular we found this little bag someone found it on the playground outside a while back or the parking lot somewhere outside and uh they could be really special to someone there's two rings inside of here just uh let us know if you want to see them Isaiah chapter 59 I'd like to read from tonight Isaiah chapter 59. verse 17. just love how the spirit of the Lord moves and ties it all together beautiful Isaiah chapter 59 verse 17. for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay Fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him let's just bow in prayer one more time gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word as we've already said we know that heavens and earth will pass away Lord Jesus but your word will remain we thank you Father that we can esteem your word to be the greatest father there's nothing greater than your word we know that's what you brought that was the message that you brought father Lord we can see many great manifestations of Supernatural instances in our lives Lord but they do not compare to your word and father we just put your word first tonight Lord Jesus we esteem it the greatest and we just ask father that you would break it fresh to us tonight Lord oh Father we love you and we thank you for your word and we pray that you would just be glorified in all that's said and done just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated try not to keep us too long for those who have to travel and I know we're few in number and of course the weather isn't great but it's just wonderful to get together and just want to say God bless you to those who are tuning in I know there's probably a good number who are who aren't here tonight we just pray that the Lord will be with you a couple of announcements that I wanted to make just a reminder that we have the 31st communion and I didn't say this before but I want to say it now I just sort of assumed it and I mustn't do that I know we'll have communion but we'll also have some worship too I I want to not hold us here until midnight so we can count down the seconds because I know some people just want to go Fellowship on on New Year's Eve and that's fine I just don't want to add any pressure but I also don't want to put the pressure on us to say we have to be out of here at a certain time either Spirit of Lord is moving and and we want to worship I want to create that atmosphere a place where we can just be free so if you have a special or something you'd like to do on the 31st we certainly would like to participate in that we'll have a communion of foot washing and then we'll all go home we are going to leave on the first the next day so there won't be a service on Sunday just because I anticipated we could be here late and it would just be easier I want to recommend that we just have Fellowship um have some dinners have some more food and friends and family just enjoy a day off Lord willing so in January while we're away we have brother Gilbert who's going to take Wednesday the 4th and uh brother Toby has agreed to take Sunday the 8th services and then brother Emmanuel is going to take the 11th which is a Wednesday and then the 15th which is the Sunday and Lord willing will be here that Sunday we're supposed to get back on the 14th we just don't know for sure what's going to happen and I don't know how the jet lag is going to be how it all worked out we might not even be back then but we should be so I just wanted to just make a provision so we know what's happening so we'll have the calendar out for January here in the next couple of days I'll talk to brother Faron and we'll get that going so we leave on Monday the 1st and we return on the 14th and we'll just see what the Lord has in store we're very excited I spoke to brother Mervin the other night and uh he was really excited he's feeling much better they just had a cold and brother brother uh miles made it safely and sister Lynn made it safely brother miles had a tremendous uh hiccup with his airline he uh basically he's it's terrible what's happening with Airlines now he said that he missed his connection he got to the gate and they had already closed the gate because of his flight from Calgary and once he got there he said that plane sat on the runway for nine hours sitting on the runway and he said that Miles had no food or entertainment inside the terminal but everyone on the plane at least had something to do it's just unreal I pray that does not happen we do not want to do that but then he was able to get on the plane and actually go and have his flight so it's not easy to fly and certainly not one of my favorite things but if you don't mind just pray for us we'll see what the Lord will do you happy tonight we uh last week we spoke about follow me as I follow Christ and that was Paul's instruction to the church and I just think it's so wonderful to look at this and and know that it's God's pattern and you know we all have a decision to make there's a time in our lives where we get faced with the word ourselves and we get that instruction we get that instruction very clearly from the word follow me as I follow Christ and we know that brother Branham he preached what Paul preached this is exactly what Paul preached I guess the inspiration for me is is coming from the thought of Ephesians paralleling Joshua that's the grand picture sort of and I just can't seem to get away from that understanding that there's a reason why the seventh angel messenger preached that and and that it was changed the title to adoption the adoption series and that's really what we all are is adopted Sons and Daughters of God but not the way that we would think about it in the world here where there's just a random child out there and someone decides one day that they want to have a child that's not it at all the way that brother Branham brought it with adoption was that we always were Sons but there came a time of appointment a time of authority a time where the Baton was handed and when your words become the same as the father's words it's no longer just a child speaking and nobody takes it seriously it's when the father brings out the child and says hey look he's already sealed and he's understanding that now it's not something that I have to continually try to teach him and that's what Paul said to the Corinthians you know when you should be eating strong meat you have need for milk when you need to be teaching you still need to be taught but we're not in that age today we're not in the Corinthian age we're in the Ephesian Church age I believe it with all my heart we're in the bride age and you know the bride hath made herself ready and she changes into the wife and there's a transformation and when we go in the Rapture we're not going to the wedding many times we hear people talk about that the wedding in the sky but the wedding is already happening the wedding is on we're going to the Celebration In The Sky that's what's going to happen but God has a pattern and every age has a messenger we talked about that and Paul he said follow Christ follow me as I follow Christ and and how did he follow Christ I just think it's good to sort of maybe just uh unearth this again and and scratch it a little bit and and just make it stir up our our Pure Minds by way of remembrance the way he followed Christ was to die out to himself and we talked about that on Sunday it wasn't Sunday a wonderful service my goodness a baby dedication at the beginning and then a baptism at the end Merry Christmas hey to the true meaning of it like just almost the maximum potential of the church capacity of what we do here and uh just to think about it though brother Branham talks about that and sirs we would see Jesus the Greeks came and said to him sir we would see Jesus we want to they said that to the disciples we want to see this man we want to see his great wonders his Works where is the Healer and and you know brother Bradham said it very clearly that you're not going to see Jesus until you're willing to die be able to see him you've got to die you've got to go to Calvary to see Jesus that's the only way we're going to be able to see him but that's what brother Paul he taught you know he dies daily he doesn't die just once a week or or twice a week or maybe once or twice a year or or whenever there's just a good song service or whenever there's just a communion service it's daily every single day he dies and how does he die he crucifies his flesh the desires of the flesh my goodness that's the worst one that's the toughest one but to take it and just say it's resilient I know it's a very difficult thing but it's got to die and the only way it's going to die is when we willfully choose to kill it when we're willing to go on our knees and ask the Lord Jesus to crucify this flesh but boy once we do that what we're doing is we're setting the stage for the days the weeks the months and the years down the road because we know that the Lord said in his word that he'll visit the iniquity upon the second and the third generation right or to those who hate him we know that but what's happening is our prayers today aren't really affecting they are sometimes affecting us immediately but we're not the prophet we don't have the ability to have the spontaneous instantaneous healings like the prophet did although we have all of that potential I'm not saying we don't have that potential I'm just saying that typically when we pray for a moment it doesn't supernaturally lightning strike Striker we see a situation change it takes some time before it will change even in the moment in great Temptations If we whisper a prayer it will change the situation but it's going to take a couple of minutes God will come on the scene but he's a gentleman he doesn't stomp his way into the room that that Spirit of Christ is a dove and he's timid and when we invite him he comes but it can take a little bit of time we know that Daniel had a situation where it was 21 days of time in his temptation before the angel of the Lord came to his need but it takes a little bit of time and if we're willing to put the time in today we can see a result tomorrow we talked about that on Sunday we've talked about its services in the past many times the things that we've been faced with as Temptation it will just disappear it will just vaporize one day we'll look back and say didn't that tempt me wasn't that a problem in my life once upon a time it will happen brothers and sisters we could have a great trial today a great problem in our lives seemingly a great problem in our lives stop looking at the problem and stop talking about the problem start looking at the promise and start talking about the promise and watch the angel of the Lord come on the scene in his time he'll come in his time but how do we follow Christ we follow the messenger for our age and what I did was I typed it as brother Branham like Paul because he preached what Paul preached and we said this that many people will say well that's a heretic right there saying that we uh we follow we're making brother Branham brother Paul and you know what we are but it's not the man it's the word and that's why we're talking about the word being the Paramount Feature of Our Lives that's that's our the essence of our existence here isn't it the word it's not about necessarily even the prophet we can take the prophet and make him an idol we can turn it into idolatry if we're not careful we're not interested in that we want to put the word out there looking at this scripture tonight thinking about you know the the book of Ephesians and and how beautiful it is maybe we can turn over there to the book of Ephesians well you're turning to Ephesians chapter 6. I'll just read this scripture here again in Isaiah chapter 59 we want to turn to Ephesians chapter 6. for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak isn't it wonderful to look at what Paul was saying here put on the whole armor of God it's not something new he didn't say something new he was talking about scripture that was already prophesied but you know we talk about this many times in Ephesians chapter six we want to put on the whole armor of God we're going to go to war we're going to go to battle we're going to be a spiritual Warrior but the only way we're going to be able to do that is to follow this word entirely and to to to recognize that we've got to be willing to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God not say that I'm the man I'm the king I'm the king of the castle you've got to serve me everyone else is the minions that's not the way it works the husbands the heads of the homes are supposed to love the wives the wives are supposed to reverence their husbands when their husbands say something their husbands say it in such a way that's nice and kind and loving and and encouraging to the family and to the wife and the wife responds to that and says wow my husband's wonderful I want to serve him I want to reverence him according to the word because of the way he treats me right it's awfully quiet but it's true but you know if you go back even further than that how talking about the family roles the children obeying your parents the first the first commandment with promise go go back beyond all of that it gets really kind of sticky because there's so many different Traditions that have crept in unawares into the framework of the Christian church because Ephesians chapter 4 says he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers there's some out there in the message of the hour claiming that Ephesians chapter 4 Ain't Enough now that's a heretic but you know we want to put on the whole armor of God but we want to Discount that and say no there's no evangelist or no there's no more pastors we just want to press play we want to put on the whole armor of God but we want to Discount some of that other stuff in there it ain't gonna work you can put on the whole armor of God but there is going to be a big hole in that armor we're gonna like we said it before we're gonna put on that busting great breastplate of righteousness and look at me how righteous I am I've got the breastplate of righteousness we're not going to have the sword of the spirit but you know what the word of God says is to take the whole armor of God put on the whole armor of God it's not something new it's something that was already prophesied it's such a beautiful thought and the why do we do it because we wrestle not against flesh and blood when our wife says something to poke us it's not flesh and blood that's coming against us when our husbands maybe say something because of a temper or whatever it is it's not the husband is not flesh and blood it's Satan getting in our our lives in the moment and if you wonder is that possible take a look at when Jesus said it's coming time for me to his disciples to go up and be crucified to die for the men and women of this world and what did his disciple is call it his chief disciple say to him oh no nobody's going to kill you ah fight to the death for you and what did Jesus say to him he didn't say Peter come on you got to just step back and think about this we're not wrestling against flesh and blood Peter what did he say he said get behind me Satan because you're an offense to me imagine how Peter felt in that moment now husbands don't go and say that to your wives I'm telling you it might be cold dinners for a while but wives don't do the same to your husbands and children don't ever do it but we need to recognize as Sons and Daughters of God adopted Sons and Daughters of God that we're we're we're more than conquerors through this word of God and that we know we can recognize when Satan is there remember we said it's a proverb I can't remember exactly what it is but soft words turn away Wrath when someone wants to speak sharp to you just push it aside and say I love you honey maybe I'll just go and do this for you and maybe you don't even have to say a word maybe you can just go and act I'm more of an actor it's a terrible thing it's a trait for me that I I just I'm not skillful with words to go to my wife and write a big poetic letter and and make her feel good she loves that I know it but my thing is I'll go and do something I'll go and do the laundry I'll go and do the dishes I'll go and try and do something to show my love we're all created differently but we have the ability to recognize the battle that we're in it's not against one another when we do that we're giving Satan a day off who wants to give him a day off we want to see him punished if there's anyone that wants to see anyone punished it's got to be the Sons and Daughters of God wanting to see Satan get his but we're not wrestling against flesh and blood brothers and sisters it's principalities and powers and remember we heard about that the principality is the the guy that's got that great portfolio of administrative assistants just waiting to do his bidding he says one word go and see brother Henry and the dick family and just get in their midst and and mess with them that's what the principalities are an army of devils working against the Sons and Daughters of God principalities and Powers that's who we're wrestling against so when we can surrender ourselves to Christ because remember Paul the messenger for the age the first Ephesian age he said my his strength is made perfect in my weakness not in my strength not not in me showing off my breastplate of righteousness and showing what I can do I know the word I know the quotes I know this I know that we know nothing Paul Paul said he had to go to Arabia and counted all that he thought he knew is done and crucify his flesh to accept Christ you know this scripture just really I really want to get into this now we'll get into it here uh Isaiah 59 verse 19. so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him how many times has the enemy come in like a flood brothers and sisters into our churches into our homes into our relationships into our minds Oh my he always comes in like a flood that's that's so beautiful that the scripture would identify the tactics of the devil because he does come in like a flood I've had times in my life where he's come into my life in such a way I don't know if anybody else has ever experienced it where I start to get waves of of fear and anxiety waves of fear and anxiety and I don't even know if I can breathe I don't even know what I should do whether I should stand up or sit down or lay down I can't even drive I just need to sit down and breathe but then cry out to the Lord and say Lord help me I just don't know what to do in this moment but then when we do cry out to him doesn't he come around and he gives us some fresh oxygen in our lungs he gives us the ability to breathe he takes those Devils off of us and just gives us the freedom that we want out of 1965 the power of transformation brother Branham he says now remember don't forget this brother Leo and Gene especially now you think Satan is going to let this go on like this without a hindrance oh no he sure won't he's going to fly in one of these days just like a whirlwind but when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against it we have to remember that when we get those overwhelming moments it feels like we're overwhelmed the situation in the church the situation in our home the situation in our relationships maybe in our business whatever it is that's the devil coming in like a flood but if we're patient if we're willing to just take God at his word he will raise a standard against that situation brother Branham goes on to say just keep lifting yourself up in prayer before God cling to one another hold to God the devil wants us to retract he wants us to stay home and say oh no that stepped on my toes nope I can't do that when we do that we're playing into the devil's tactics we're not recognizing that he's coming in like a flood he's shaking us up and trying to get us to see the hinder Parts remember the hinder Parts Balaam and balak that was the way that he tried to curse Israel get the prophet to go and look at all the hinder parts that's the same Spirit today that gets people to talk to people to go and talk about the hinder Parts the more we do that brothers and sisters the more we give devil a day off we just work for him brother Branham says just keep lifting yourself up in prayer before God cling to one another hold to God for if you love one another it shows you love God this will all men know that you love my disciples when you love have love one for the other not when you're not when you're a good good Christian a good message believer and you go to church all the time but you just can't stand that brother and you'll never go and talk to him and something about them or whatever it is that's not going to do it for you got to remember that we're not wrestling against flesh and blood Bush aside the Flesh and Blood Brothers and Sisters push aside the hinder Parts recognize that every one of us have hinder Parts even even new King Charles he's got hinder parts they're quite hidden though he's got people to actually help scrub his hinder parts from the view of society but you know us as normal peasants we don't have anybody to scrub that not not from society's eyes but what we do have is the Lord Jesus Christ to actually take away those hinder parts to take away our own thoughts you know what the biggest problem is when we get into those situations and we start to look at other people you know what it's not the other people it's ourselves is the devil working on us and that's why we have to be like David and have a contrite heart and a humble spirit and say Lord create in me a new heart don't create a new heart in them create one in me and renew a right spirit in me because if you do that you'll change the situation entirely that brother that would spit in your face and and your friend would say I'll take his head off of that dog what what you'll say is no no no no no no that was just a test from God don't worry about it he's a Believer he didn't mean to do that even though he spit right in my face and stomped on my feet and maybe stuck it between my my ribs from my backside he didn't mean to do that it was just an evil spirit that was afflicting him that's what we'll say because we have a new heart there's a new spirit inside of us and what's that new heart or spirit is simple it's the Holy Ghost when we're sealed in like we sang brothers and sisters it doesn't matter what comes our way we won't be overwhelmed nothing can overwhelm us I got some real good inspiration from the whole armor of God to take on the whole armor of God from 1962. brother Adam says lowest of all the nations talking about North America lowest of all the nations more divorces in America than there is in the rest of the world put together almost corrupt dirty filthy the last civilization and we're on the west coast where the East and the West will meet that's right right in our own churches right among our own people I trust that isn't here I trust that isn't there I trust that's not in the Church of the Living God but we know Satan comes to church Satan's not afraid to come to church and get in people's minds and you know honestly I've heard people even say it the word divorce I've heard it but you know what that's of the devil it's the devil getting in our minds trying to get us to speak his language and you know the power of the spoken word we were talking about that brothers and sisters we said it a long time ago if we believe in the power of the spoken word we're living in the third poll realm when we talk about things people in the world recognize this that you can set an intention and you can actually create a vision board and you can start to speak to all of the vision and all of the different components that go in that vision board and you can carefully select the pictures of the things you want to visualize and as you go through that and you study it and you worship that that will come to manifest in your life and if you're not careful those words and thoughts that Satan plants in your head will become your vision board and you'll start to study them and you'll start to look at them and before long you'll see them start to manifest but how much more the Sons and Daughters of God the positive no Satan that's my wife and God gave her to me before the foundation of the world God took her from my side just like he took me from his side that that business of thinking that I've got the right to do anything about putting away no way because if I've got the right to put someone away my wife away then God's got the right to put me away and really if we believe that God gave us our wives then it works that way and I think that's Dangerous Ground I would never want to step out on that Limb and think oh my I've got the right to put my wife away because then I would say you know what what we're doing is we're living under the law hi we got the power of the spoken word in our lives personally I believe we can go one step forward by the power of the spoken word in our lives if we talk about the positive we'll go one step forward One Foot In Front of the other but if we start going negative and we start talking about that that that improper Parts the the hinder parts of people and start talking for Satan being Satan's voice box what happens is one word won't take us one step forward it'll take us ten steps backwards and every second word might be 20 steps further and we go so far back before long we don't even know how we got there and before long we're different people but it's because we're of a different spirit it's not it's not human beings it's just a spiritual battle but the random goes on I'll just read this here I just get inspired I get excited sorry but Satan makes it appealing Satan makes the ideas appealing he makes us think maybe maybe it's appealing I've suffered from it I went through it in my own marriage I have to say it there is a time in my life where I wasn't right with God and what did I do I want to put it on my wife and say that it's her fault she's not submitting she's out of her position but who was out of their position brothers and sisters was brother Barry on his knees in prayer nope was he in the word nope did he come to church yep dressed up nice came to church everything was great right no it wasn't I was actually battling a spirit and I didn't realize it I was trying to battle my own self really but here we have brother Brad I'm saying Satan makes it appealing he makes us think that it's the right thing certainly it's appealing sin is appealing but the enemy keeps finding a better bait he he will strip her off a little more do this do that and don't worry he'll never make her completely naked she would be horrible then see he knows just what to do but Satan keeps bringing sin in and that was the original sin that's where he's going out with the same thing as the kingdom come in the Warfare he says now watch but God doesn't have to do anything more to his make it any more appealing and it's true he doesn't have to change his word anymore doesn't have to have a greater Ministry he doesn't have to do anything more because his word is what will do it now watch but God doesn't have to do anything more to his make it any more appealing the only thing he has to do is just raise up a standard of his own word against the enemy when the Bible said when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises the standard against it what does he do he makes the word that he has already said more positive he goes woo take in his same word and just making it more positive but brothers and sisters not going to do what I always do I'm just going to get to the punch line where does he make that word where does that word come from it's it's in print form here there it is all the potential lies in this word but if someone doesn't speak this word it's just potential sitting there black and white right on pages but boy oh boy when we speak his word when we're sealed in like we sang about when we're truly adopted Sons and Daughters of God and we begin to speak his word the enemy can come in like a flood can he when he comes in like a flood we'll just raise right above it doesn't matter how much flood comes in we'll just continually go over it think about Noah's Ark the ark that Noah made didn't matter how how many Fountains of the deep were Unleashed and how much rain came from the heavens and how much water gushed upon the Earth that Ark was always on top of it and that's the standard of God and you know the standard of God is his word but that word inside of us is what gives us the ability to rise and Float above all of the trash in this world and that's where I say when we have the Temptations If we can just put on the whole armor of God if we can just take his word if we can just get sealed in if we could just not have a door in a door not just have a secret place that we're not willing to let go of in our lives as long as we got a secret place that we're holding on to in our lives Satan has every single right to attack us but boy when we get rid of all the reservations when we clear out all the trash and we say Lord just be it unto me according to Thy word if I've got to get rid of this if I've got to go do that whatever it is I've Got to Do Lord I'll do it I'm willing now you got my full attention when we do that then we eliminate Satan's power from our life we eliminate Satan's power from our families and what we do is we actually create a situation where we're now pitched in so pitched in it doesn't matter how much water how much flood comes our way we will always rise above it goes on to say to take the whole armor of God 1962. what was it Luther and the Reformation justification then when the enemy begin to come in like a flood he raised up a standard sanctification a little more powerful in the spirit then when the enemy began to cover that over and they begin to organize and join this and that and the other then the spirit of God moved into the Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy Ghost they organized and went off now what's he doing there's no other age to come to but he's taking that Pentecostal church and taking the elect out of that and honing it so that when this headstone comes upon it it will have to be like the rest of it why it's so them rocks laying up there with hundreds of tons laying up there is so close together without mortar that you can't run a razor blade between them and when The Headstone comes Christ come to his Temple it will have to fit perfect like the rest of it and the ministry of the Pentecostal Church will have to get so perfect to it'll fit right in with the same Ministry that he had here which will take the whole thing into the rapture being the church that's right remember I talked about it before the stature of the perfect man and I still haven't done it I need to talk to someone technical maybe I can do that before I go to the Philippines I'll bring that there I don't know maybe it's crazy but I just personally believe based on this here the way we look at that the stature of the perfect man we see all of the layers all the way up right up to where we get to the Holy Ghost and then we have Christ himself we see two triangles that's the way this is always represented as two triangles what he's saying here is not two triangles what he's saying here is one triangle one individual triangle it will fit together as one I believe personally just my own view that we need to stop looking at it as two separate triangles we're not going up a bunch of stairs like we're going to get to a certain destination what we're going to do is get the baptism the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and become one mind and one Accord and we will have every single virtue that there is in the Statue of the perfect man because it's the fruit of the spirit not fruits it's not a plural thing we don't just go and get one portion of it remember in Ephesians we read this here put on the whole armor of God did we read that we didn't we didn't we just turned there I'm sorry got excited Ephesians chapter 6 verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day having done all to stand and the word with stand there it remains it means you remain undamaged or unaffected by and resist offer strong resistance or opposition to the attacks of the enemy recognizing it's not flesh and blood that we're fighting against we're not fighting against our brother and our sister we're not fighting against the deacons we're not fighting against our parents what we're doing is we're wrestling against flesh and blood and and that's not what we need to do we're wrestling against principalities and Powers against Spirits rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places I know some people have turned there I'll just read that again verse 13 of Ephesians chapter 6 take unto you wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you'll be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints I personally believe this with all my heart we we can only put on the whole armor of God all of it brothers and sisters it's not stages it's not steps it's not pieces and parts when we are truly sealed in when we're truly baptized into Christ when we have Christ inside of us we we pitch out all of the worldly things and we pitch in all of the armor of God the whole armor of God is what we put on when we are truly baptized into Christ truly adopted Sons and Daughters of God you know out of to take on the whole armor of God brother Branham says now when the enemy comes in like a flood he raises a standard against it and you know we can look at this world I just want to say it this way we look at this world the enemy has come in like a flood they have dialed in now that really what's going to get the people is screens that's what's going to get the people the screens Holograms it attracts the eyes it's just we're just created like nature we have that that that animal element in us from the hybridization that happened in the garden right where where we're paralyzed when it comes to screens and all of the marketing agents they've realized it it's not just Billboards now but it's ginormous televisions showing images we go into stores and that's what we get that's why they're smartphones in everyone's pocket because it's to capture the attention of the people and and we had talked about this before and this is just for free for our friends but we were telling our children the original television is that fire that we've been sitting around talking about we Put Another Log on the flyer we change the channel and there's something about it it's mesmerizing it pulls our eyes in but Satan now has created a painted fire to try and warp our minds and we can watch something and it can be completely Innocent but there's always something subliminal somewhere along the way that's going to penetrate and get us we were talking about it on the way to church tonight and we heard that video games are no longer a part of of our friends lives and I think that's such a beautiful thing and really honestly I don't think there's good in video games video games are are an addiction video games will take us the wrong way and especially for our children for our children to see that that's a dangerous thing I believe and and maybe we could have a discussion about it afterwards but you know what as as as heads of the home as as husbands as fathers it's our responsibility We're The Gatekeepers you know brother Branham talks about that song how did the goats get in how do we have problems in our family where do they come from we got to go to the top we talked about that book you know when fish fly if a fish always stinks at the head first it's the head of the home they're the ones that are going to answer for it God never came down to the Garden of Eden and said eve where are you where where are you at Eve aren't you where are you at Eve he didn't do that he came to the Garden of Eden he said Adam what's going on he didn't tell Eve God didn't tell Eve don't eat of that fruit of that tree he told Adam don't eat of the fruit of that tree and it's up to the husband to actually explain this stuff to the wives to be The Gatekeepers of the home when the enemy comes in like a flood brother Brad I'm speaking here he raises a standard against it in our day with all of this flood of evil in this world we are the standard against it and the only way we can be the standard against it is to have his word on our lips his word in our hearts to be sealed in with the pitch of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives now when the enemy comes in like a flood he raises a standard against it now watch in Eden he gave them his word for their armor put on the whole armor of God In the Garden of Eden really wasn't it perfect there didn't they have everything they needed but he said he gave them the armor of his word he gave them his word for their armor just the word spoke then the enemy came in like a flood isn't that interesting I don't know if I ever looked at it this way that it was like that right the enemy came in like a flood all of the curse came in just flooded in just because of one word and I know that we we know this this is Elementary as Believers but I personally have never looked at it this way the enemy came into Eden as a flood from one word one word and he took the word and made it flesh to dwell Among Us a little stronger from there speaking here he is walking on Earth Glory going to call me Holy Roller anyhow so you might as well get used to it now he says oh first it was a spoken word out yonder now here it is you could touch it remember when he created everything he's talking about creation and then Jesus well first it was a spoken word out yonder now here it is you could touch it and it was made flesh then when the enemies still come in like a flood he poured the word into the person being the form of the Holy Ghost there's your one two three again justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost like father son Holy Ghost and so forth into protection in Perfection sorry now notice the spoken word God above us God With Us God in us the word above us the word with us the word in us hallelujah ye are God's Army marching on God's spoken word above us in a pillar of fire God's manifestation of his word in flesh now God's spirit spoken word in US amen remember we've seen this before many many times all that God was he poured into Christ the mystery of God revealed all that Christ was he poured into his church all that Christ was that's a heavy statement how do we actually understand that even it's hard to comprehend that because I sure don't feel like Christ do you but it doesn't matter how we feel isn't that amazing the prophet of God saying our feelings have nothing to do with it the Holy Ghost is without sensation it is without sensation but it causes a reaction in the life of a Believer it causes an emotion it causes something to happen in our lives we're no longer the same people that we used to be but we want to remember this brothers and sisters we put on the whole armor of God it gives us the ability to withstand to remain undamaged or unaffected and we're able to resist it and also when we when we have those moments of Temptation those those trials in our lives we put on the whole armor of God we put on Christ Jesus we put on the Seal of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we recognize that we are adopted Sons and Daughters of God you've put on the whole armor of God when you recognize you've got the fruit of the spirit you've got all the fruits of the spirit you have all of Christ because he poured all of Christ into the church it's not a portion we're not talking about a halfway religion a so far religion we're talking about the manifestation of the word is what brother Branham said here and we're able to remain undamaged or unaffected by it we can resist Satan we can actually quench all of the fiery darts of the wicked one that's what the word says when we put on the whole armor of God not just most of the darts or some of the darts but all of the fiery darts that's tremendous and the second the second definition for withstand is to offer strong resistance or opposition to not just remain undamaged we've been playing chess a little bit and uh it's just a wonderful thing because you look at it and you can you can be on the defense and on the defense and on the defense but there comes a time where you can say I'm tired of running around and being defensive I can actually be offensive and say no I have power too I can actually start to move my men in and push the enemy out of the way we don't have to be slapped around by the devil if he's coming around Brothers and Sisters Let's just examine let's just take inventory let's go through our lives let's go through our homes let's confess our faults one to another and pray for one another because then we know how to pray and you know what we'll be healed that's what the word says we can look at 2012 and and see so many times the Lord Has Come on the scene in our lives in our homes and our families and and personally in our businesses in school and everything that we do he's always with us and he's helped us so many times but he's got more for us brothers and sisters there's more for us we know that the word says when that squeeze comes watch it it'll be a short powerful work a short powerful demonstration we're not looking for signs and wonders we're looking for the word we're going to put the word of God first in our homes and everything else will follow when the Devil comes knocking and tries to tell us oh your children have this terrible illness and you just have to accept it you can say I can hear the rattles in that box and you can take it back I'm not going to accept that because I know that I've gone through my house I know that I'm in a righteous position and if you see fit for us to walk through this trial then be it unto me according to Thy word because you can touch this flesh but you will never touch my soul we've got to be able to have that Assurance in our lives the only way we're going to do it is to crucify the flesh to die out to ourselves to follow Christ as Paul followed Christ follow Christ as brother Branham followed Christ be willing to just lay ourselves down and say it doesn't matter what happens in this life because he can't touch my soul what's the biggest thing that we contend with is fear of death as humans that's the biggest thing you know when people are actually about to expire when an animal is about to expire you can see their bodies gasping trying for that last breath but it's just the flesh it's just this body you know who we are here is who we will be there that's why we need to work it out now we don't want to try and go to the other side and work it out that'll never happen death only changes our Dwelling Place it doesn't change our character at all that's why we need to make sure we've got his character in our lives and I tell you that shaking that trembles me that that makes me shudder to think Lord have mercy because I got work to do there's things in my life that I don't want to have over there and I hope that somehow they'll be gone by the time I get there but but I just trust that the Lord won't allow it to to travel with me over there he's working on every one of us isn't that wonderful that little song they sing in Sunday school he's still working on me he is every one of us he's still working on every one of us and we need to have that Grace one for another and be able to submit ourselves therefore one to another we talked about that extensively if we want to talk about our husbands being in his position a wife being in her position and children being in their position the very first part of that that Paul talks about in Ephesians first before any of the roles is submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God that's the most important thing then he talks about wives then he talks about husbands then he talks about the children but don't do any of it until you're willing to submit yourselves unto God first we talked about this as well I just think it's so powerful you know we want communion the last two messages that brother Branham preached was leadership and then communion it's no accident that that's what happened before he went off the air there's a reason for that if we want communion with God true communion with the Lord Jesus Christ we've got to be willing to be led but there's some people they're just not willing to accept Ephesians chapter 4 and we know that it's a strong spirit it's a spirit of delusion and the Lord said that I'll send a spirit of delusion in the last days there's people that won't want to follow the word of God but that's where we have to say you know like uh the disciples said is is he the one that's going to be here he's gonna see you're coming and Jesus said what is that to you follow thou me it doesn't matter what anyone else is up to we want to encourage our brothers and sisters but this is an individual walk we've got to make sure that we're working out our own salvation with fear and trembling is what the word says and I say my goodness I fear and I tremble when I think about this character if I've got to drag this character over there Lord have mercy there's work to do here on this side I really want to get that worked out and I'm not joking I'm just a human being I'm just a man goodness but everyone is when they're in their office aren't they the wives are just human wives the husbands are just human husbands the children are just children and you know brother Branham said it in our study I think it's so beautiful sometimes we can look at children and say oh those are Renegades brother Branham said don't you do that our children are the best children on the planet because they get the word of God they get the true word of God and for anyone to ever be in and around this message of the hour and to say that they're not my children because they're tarnishing my image they're they're they're coming out of against my family idols it's terrible to think that people would do that they would rather actually sacrifice their children for their image than actually throw themselves down in the way throw themselves in the breach just like the prophet did for the people remember we talked about it Moses did it in his day Jesus the Lord said to him out of the pillar of fire step aside I'm gonna just destroy these people I'm sick and tired of their murmur and every time we do something good for them they get delivered and then they get lacks they get fat and lazy and they just start to murmur about all of the troubles that they're going through and they forget that they were once slaves but they're now free remember brother Bradham in the Tabernacle he had the spirit of the Lord write it out on the on the wall in the last Church age there would be no light but the prophet once again goes into the breach for the people to say no Lord there's going to be one sliver of like there's going to be one tiny group of people scarcely a dozen people out of this age that will actually go in the rapture wow that's frightening you know I'm just going to close with this one scripture I'll call the musicians or I'll keep going Luke chapter 6. if you want to turn there Luke chapter 6 verse 4 verse 46 of Luke chapter 6. Jesus talking to his disciples he says to him and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say verse 47 Luke chapter 6 whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them I will show you to whom he is like he's like a man which built a house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock when the flood came verse 49 but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the Earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great to me this just spoke to me when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against him but only if we build it on a rock and that rock has got to be the rock of revelation of the message of this hour the word of God for our day what was given to us through Malachi 4. Revelations 10 7 sunset Mountain the pillar of fire the seals the Thunders all of it packaged together was to recognize that we have full Authority and power we don't have to be subject to Satan no time no how we have full Authority and power fully adopted Sons and Daughters of God in the day in which we live and when the enemy comes in like a flood brothers and sisters God has already raised you up as a standard against it stand with me tonight if you will build our houses on the rock of Revelation on a solid foundation and when that flood comes in it's gonna beat vehemently against that house against our families against our churches even against the Revelation that we've got of the word for our day but it won't touch us if we get it built right let's just go to him in prayer tonight gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord we esteem it greater than anything that we have on Earth because we know it's you and you're the greatest father Lord Jesus tonight we pray that we would just take the things that were spoken and just Ponder them in our hearts Lord Jesus father that the meditation in our hearts would be pleasing unto you father Lord Jesus we just ask that you would allow us to go our separate ways tonight father that you would keep your hand upon us as we go and father if it be a will for us to meet again here on Saturday Lord we just thank you for that opportunity Lord thank you for the ability to come and hear from you tonight Lord Jesus father if I've said anything untowards tonight I pray that you would forgive me for it Lord and that you would show me correct me I don't want to ever say anything that would mislead anyone father I just want to be in my position for you Lord father we pray that you would just be glorified in the songs that are sun Lord Jesus and and the thoughts and and meditations in our hearts now as we go our separate ways we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen change my heart oh God a kid ever true change my heart oh God [Music] may I be like you [Music] you are the part ner I am the clay oh hold me and make me this is what I pray [Music] is my heart oh God make it ever true you change my heart oh God may I be like you you are the Potter Lord Jesus you are the part on you I am the place [Music] oh God [Music] make it ever true change my heart oh God [Music] may I be like you sing 284 he is our peace it's broken down the middle wall of partition brothers and sisters he is our peace who has broken down everyone here is our peace he is our peace [Music] who has broken down everyone [Music] is our peace [Music] he is our peace cast all your cares [Music] on him for he caring for you foreign [Music] he is our peace number 48 as we're dismissed tonight so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm Yours God bless you all tonight we'll see most of you on Saturday God bless you Wilcox certainly enjoyed our visit come again anytime [Music] so glad I'm your foreign [Music] [Music] so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm Yours one more time unto him tonight so glad I'm Yours so glad I'm yours [Music] has followed me all the days of my life thank you Lord Jesus [Music] and you set me free God bless you tonight [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign
