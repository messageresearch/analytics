[33:47] [Music]
[33:49] amen
[33:50] I think that's all the thing it will do
[33:53] um
[33:54] let's just quickly go into the scripture
[33:56] so you can have your seats
[33:59] I'm reading fresh from Jeremiah first
[34:01] the first chapter of Jeremiah
[34:05] I'll just take the verse
[34:09] the verse 12.
[34:12] um thank you my friend
[34:16] I'll read it 11 and 12.
[34:21] I read 11 and 12.
[34:30] Jeremiah 1
[34:38] all right
[34:40] Jeremiah 1 11 moreover the word of the
[34:43] Lord came unto me saying Jeremiah what's
[34:45] he as thou
[34:47] and I said I see a rod of an almond tree
[34:50] not 12. then say the Lord unto me thou
[34:54] has well seen for our history my word to
[34:57] perform it amen now the amplifier said
[35:01] a watch over my word to fulfill it amen
[35:06] um let's refresh Genesis chapter 1
[35:11] I will read from
[35:16] 26.
[35:25] Genesis 1 26.
[35:30] and God said let us make money in our
[35:33] image after our likeness and let them
[35:36] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[35:39] and over the fowl of the air and over
[35:41] the cattle
[35:43] and over all the Earth
[35:45] and over every crippling thing that
[35:47] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[35:50] man in his own image
[35:54] in the image of God created he him male
[35:58] and female created he them
[36:01] and God blessed them
[36:04] and God said unto them be fruitful and
[36:07] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[36:09] subdue it and have dominion over the
[36:11] fish of the sea over the fowl of the air
[36:14] and over every living thing that moveth
[36:17] upon the Earth
[36:18] may the Lord add His blessings unto the
[36:21] reading of his word he may be seated
[36:28] so I am very grateful for the
[36:31] privilege of standing
[36:34] before the most important lady on Earth
[36:37] right now
[36:39] it's a very special privilege
[36:43] um before I forget
[36:45] um let's all remember to pray for the
[36:47] ordeline sisters and
[36:49] the linear family as a whole um I think
[36:53] tomorrow
[36:55] well the the funeral starts tomorrow
[36:57] sort of like there's a sing song
[36:58] tomorrow and then the funeral is on
[37:02] on Friday yeah so let's remember it's
[37:07] never easy to lose their mother
[37:09] you are never ready for it for her to
[37:12] live so suddenly uh
[37:15] it'll take the Lord so let's be honest
[37:17] for them amen
[37:20] and so this evening I have some course
[37:23] that I just want to share and that is
[37:25] all I want to do
[37:26] I
[37:30] I think in the summer
[37:32] or even before the sermon
[37:35] you know when this we're thinking about
[37:38] marriage and
[37:40] and the things related to marriage
[37:42] um I I was just doing some studies and
[37:45] making some notes and and all I like I
[37:49] had it what I had in mind was for the
[37:51] young people who were
[37:54] like who were not yet married just a way
[37:58] to set sort of a realistic expectation
[38:00] you know as opposed to the fantasy of
[38:03] Hollywood
[38:04] and so uh those were the things that I
[38:07] had in mind those were the notes that I
[38:08] had
[38:09] and then uh when we had to when I had to
[38:13] go to Leverage
[38:16] [Music]
[38:16] um
[38:17] I couldn't just take it off I couldn't
[38:19] think of anything else I would try to
[38:21] read something I'll try to do anything
[38:24] about nothing so that that was what
[38:26] stuck to me and so then
[38:28] that is what I went to that bridge with
[38:30] it and just as I went there and I
[38:33] started I realized this is not going to
[38:35] be
[38:36] at one service center
[38:37] because I thought I'm doing it for
[38:40] somebody but I was learning probably
[38:41] more than everybody else
[38:43] and so on and on I think took about four
[38:47] services that I was there that was the
[38:49] only thing I did the purpose of marriage
[38:52] but
[38:53] one thing that kept popping up is this
[38:56] thought that I want to share with you uh
[38:58] tonight and it just kept coming up and
[39:01] I'll just mention it and keep going
[39:03] but afterwards I I felt like I had to
[39:06] actually give it some attention
[39:09] and then in recent times I started
[39:12] hearing the same thing running through
[39:14] everything that is going on here I hear
[39:18] brother Gilbert break it out of the
[39:20] wrong cycle and then he's talking about
[39:22] a jubilee year and the blowing of the
[39:25] trumpet and and how it spells freedom
[39:28] for everybody
[39:30] and yet you have to be it is
[39:34] specifically for the people of the
[39:35] Covenant who get the freedom and so you
[39:39] have to know who you are to get their
[39:41] freedom and I remember sitting there and
[39:43] thinking if I'm paying that debt for my
[39:45] lineage then maybe I can receive the
[39:48] blessing from my origin as well
[39:51] and so it it just it just kept going and
[39:54] then I think brother Bevin came with
[39:56] with preserving the seed uh for the
[39:59] purpose of God that was very direct like
[40:02] preserving the sea for the purpose of
[40:04] God so it's his own purpose and then
[40:07] relatively put it blindly God is
[40:09] responsible for you that's it
[40:12] I I so I feel like I've been inspired
[40:15] along these lines to say well let me
[40:17] just share this uh these thoughts with
[40:20] you
[40:21] and so this evening
[40:23] um
[40:24] my topic will be going back
[40:28] going back
[40:30] and and I like it because even when you
[40:33] say this so doesn't say much so you have
[40:34] to listen to me to know what I'm saying
[40:37] Hallelujah
[40:38] and so uh the scripture that we just
[40:42] read Genesis 1 26
[40:45] God sets out to do something
[40:48] and in 26 he expresses the purpose for
[40:51] which he wants to do what he's going to
[40:53] do
[40:53] and so you see when he expresses the
[40:56] purpose it gets to 27 then it starts
[40:59] fulfilling
[41:01] and so he says yes he's going to create
[41:04] man but he says exactly what purpose for
[41:07] man to have dominion
[41:09] and so when it says that he sets out to
[41:12] to actually create man and afterwards in
[41:15] 28 he fulfills the other part of it
[41:18] which is actually passing on Dominion to
[41:21] man
[41:22] and so that is how it has been a
[41:24] recurring theme in in creation that God
[41:27] always expresses a purpose and once the
[41:31] purpose is expressed it must of
[41:33] necessity come to pass Hallelujah
[41:35] because he's the master of creation
[41:38] praise the name of the Lord and so you
[41:41] find out that in in Genesis chapter 1
[41:43] verse 6 he expresses a purpose he says I
[41:46] want to make a firmament but what is
[41:48] that from moment for it is to separate
[41:50] the waters above from the waters below
[41:53] and so when you get to verse 7 you see
[41:56] that
[41:56] he created it and it did separate the
[41:59] waters above from the waters below
[42:01] when you get to uh verse 9 it says I
[42:04] want dry land and so he says oh let's
[42:06] see or let the waters gather into one
[42:09] place
[42:09] and lo and behold what has gathered into
[42:11] one place you have seen and you have dry
[42:13] land
[42:14] and so through our creation that was
[42:16] what it was now what I want to say is
[42:19] this there's nothing I can stop not
[42:23] stand in the face or that that can stand
[42:25] in the purpose of God from being
[42:27] fulfilled
[42:29] and so when you hear a purpose of God
[42:32] Express because that's actually the only
[42:34] way we will know the purpose of God is
[42:36] when he expresses it when you hear the
[42:38] purpose of God Express
[42:40] is the purpose of God fulfilled
[42:43] it may take a day it may take a minute
[42:46] it may take thousand years but it'll
[42:48] come to pass Allelujah now just as I'm
[42:52] saying this because that's not on my
[42:54] mind I'm thinking of God expressing a a
[42:58] desire so to speak expressing something
[43:01] about Ahab and saying ah
[43:05] who was going to convince Ahab so that
[43:07] he'll go to remote Gilead and go and
[43:08] fall
[43:09] that was God's expressed desire now even
[43:13] demon evil spirits fulfill God's purpose
[43:18] and so let's just start from that point
[43:21] now in Genesis we go to Genesis 14 it
[43:25] speaks about putting a light in the
[43:27] firmament
[43:28] but then when he says is putting the
[43:29] light in the firmament he actually says
[43:31] what it is for is it to give light on
[43:34] the earth into a separate day and night
[43:36] into this differentiate seasons
[43:39] praise the name of the Lord and so when
[43:41] it says that it gives all these purposes
[43:43] and then 17 18 it fulfills it
[43:47] and so that is it that is what I came to
[43:49] say that if God expresses
[43:52] a purpose that purpose will come to pass
[43:56] and so when we are reading Genesis 1 26
[43:59] it is about us
[44:01] and Genesis 1 2 and says he says he
[44:03] created us to have dominion over the
[44:06] Earth Hallelujah now you realize that
[44:09] man was very unique in creation
[44:12] in the sense that we're the only ones
[44:15] who were created in the image of God
[44:18] were the only ones who were created in
[44:21] the likeness of God we are the only ones
[44:23] who were created to have authority over
[44:26] all of creation
[44:29] but the greatest privilege I say is that
[44:33] we're the only ones who have fellowship
[44:35] with God
[44:36] Hallelujah and fellowship with God was
[44:40] actually a purpose of God
[44:42] so the big elephant was created
[44:45] but there's no record of God having
[44:47] fellowship with elephants
[44:49] oh the the will is the biggest mama
[44:52] there's no record of God having
[44:54] fellowship with them with the will oh
[44:56] the The Majestic Lion and the wild tiger
[44:59] and all of this and the little ones and
[45:02] the beautiful breasts and the fishes
[45:04] there's no record of God having
[45:06] fellowship with them
[45:08] but Bank comes on the scene the one that
[45:11] was created to have dominion the one
[45:13] that was created in the image and
[45:15] likeness of God and suddenly God desires
[45:18] fellowship with man Hallelujah I'm
[45:20] reading my first code that is fellowship
[45:22] with God's reconciliation brother
[45:24] Abraham says God Longs for Fellowship
[45:27] he yes he wants people to speak with him
[45:32] and so once I say that I say let's see
[45:35] he says he loves Fellowship he wants
[45:38] people to speak with him it means that
[45:40] speaking with him is fellowship
[45:42] halleluia and how do we speak to God
[45:45] through prayer praise the name of the
[45:48] Living God so now when we start talking
[45:49] about love affair you have to understand
[45:51] that you have to want to talk to the
[45:53] person and the person has to want to
[45:55] talk to you Hallelujah
[45:59] he wants people to speak with him
[46:01] to talk with him
[46:03] you might think too much or you might
[46:06] pray too much sometime but there's one
[46:09] thing that you'll never be able to
[46:10] overdo that is pray
[46:12] the Bible said I will that men pray
[46:15] everywhere lifting up holy hands you
[46:17] will never be able to have too much
[46:19] fellowship with God
[46:21] and God Longs for his creature who he
[46:25] created in His image to fellowship with
[46:28] him so it's not all of creation but the
[46:31] one that he created in His image to
[46:34] fellowship with him
[46:36] and so brother sister the next time you
[46:38] go on your knees remember
[46:40] it's not just about you and your list of
[46:43] wants it's not just about you and your
[46:47] list of needs God also desires
[46:50] Fellowship
[46:51] the question is are you going to give it
[46:54] how is the fellowship going to be done
[46:56] I remember one of these days we're
[46:58] talking with some friends and a a it
[47:01] just occurred with our servant the fact
[47:03] that of all the things that Jesus did
[47:07] the one thing that we asked him to teach
[47:09] us as his followers was prayer
[47:13] the Mind came on Earth he healed the
[47:15] sick
[47:16] we never asked him can you show us how
[47:18] to heal the sick he walked on water we
[47:21] didn't ask that
[47:23] if he didn't ask him how to sing we
[47:25] didn't ask him how to preach but we
[47:27] asked him how to pray now remember the
[47:29] people whose lips actually asked the
[47:31] Lord Jesus we are not any Ordinary
[47:34] People there were people who were
[47:36] prayerful already
[47:38] there were people who were who worshiped
[47:40] God
[47:41] and yet they asked him how to pray why
[47:44] they found a distinction the difference
[47:46] between how they pray and how the Lord
[47:49] Jesus prays and so there is something to
[47:51] learn because if there is flaw in our
[47:54] traditional way of doing it then there
[47:56] is a there is something to learn from
[47:57] how what Jesus taught us
[48:00] right and so prayer is important not
[48:04] just for us but for the Lord
[48:06] and as I'm saying that I'm fed yes it
[48:09] may not be as fun as you know singing
[48:12] singing this can be very fun
[48:14] even sometimes the preaching of the word
[48:15] people can enjoy it prayer isn't like
[48:18] that but if you understand the essence
[48:20] of it and that's what I was telling some
[48:22] people you if you understand that you
[48:26] either do it or die
[48:28] you will do it and you will take it
[48:30] serious
[48:31] and that is literally what it is we may
[48:34] not die physically but a prayerless
[48:36] Believer is a powerless believer and the
[48:39] prayers congregation is a powerless
[48:41] congregation
[48:43] and so let's understand it that when you
[48:45] go before Lord
[48:47] it is not expected to be a monologue
[48:50] and for me that is where my problem is
[48:53] a lot of times I'm busy I'll get on my
[48:56] knees I'll pray and I'll get up and go
[48:59] but that that is not Fellowship
[49:02] Hallelujah if we intend for it to be
[49:04] Fellowship then Fellowship must be in a
[49:07] way that will go before him that we
[49:11] actually know that we are going to go
[49:13] before him we schedule the time
[49:16] you see we don't have our schedule and
[49:18] fit God around whenever we have free
[49:20] time we schedule the time we look
[49:23] forward to it sometimes we even think of
[49:26] what we want to say and plan it
[49:29] so that you go knowing that this is
[49:32] going to be a good encounter
[49:34] and then once we go in the presence of
[49:36] the Lord
[49:38] let's let's take the time to express
[49:41] ourselves to him
[49:43] and after that let's relax
[49:45] and let him speak back to us
[49:47] that is when Fellowship is complete
[49:50] because if I invite you to my house and
[49:52] come and I give you a lecture do this do
[49:55] that don't do this do that done go
[49:58] that is not Fellowship
[50:00] and I I can assure you if you call me to
[50:03] your house and you do that to me I'll
[50:04] probably not come back anymore
[50:06] and so the idea is to fellowship with
[50:09] him
[50:10] to make him feel welcomed
[50:13] and to express ourselves to him
[50:15] Hallelujah
[50:19] and hear his voice Brian says when men
[50:21] and women used to pray all night
[50:24] and their homes were said in order by
[50:27] the book of the Lord and God was first
[50:29] in their homes see we got too many
[50:31] things ahead of
[50:33] of the Lord
[50:34] you can't have the prayer meeting
[50:36] because Mr Godfrey is on tonight you
[50:40] can't have prayer meeting because we
[50:42] love to see is on tonight
[50:44] or some kind of foolish nonsense like
[50:46] that that's right
[50:50] that takes up the time and we don't have
[50:53] time to hear the voice of God and those
[50:55] who do claim to be Christians just kneel
[50:57] down of a little prayer like this kind
[51:00] of homemade Lord bless me and my family
[51:02] and take care of us good night
[51:05] and the next morning rise and say just
[51:08] guide us through the day good day
[51:10] we should wait on the Lord
[51:13] you see we do all the Talking we don't
[51:16] give him a chance to talk back to us
[51:19] that if we would pray
[51:22] and pray unto our soul comes into the
[51:24] presence of God and then just relax
[51:27] and listen to his voice
[51:30] Hallelujah
[51:32] and so this is what God desired and this
[51:35] is what God did in the Garden of Eden
[51:37] but I just remember was the time when
[51:39] there was complete Harmony between God
[51:42] and man and that's what I came to say we
[51:45] are going back
[51:47] Hallelujah
[51:49] not before creating man
[51:52] God was the only one in His image he was
[51:55] the only one in his likeness he was the
[51:57] only one with authority over
[51:59] or every all of creation
[52:02] but once Man was created then there was
[52:06] another one in the image of God in the
[52:08] likeness of God but also has the
[52:10] authority of God
[52:12] so when God does that what is he doing
[52:14] he was creating God on Earth
[52:18] and that is our position praise the name
[52:21] of the Living God yes we're falling from
[52:23] it
[52:25] but we are going back Hallelujah
[52:28] so the very source of our position the
[52:32] very source of our privilege is the
[52:34] spoken word of God
[52:36] Hallelujah so understand it this way
[52:39] that
[52:41] before man was ever created
[52:44] God created the earth on which man will
[52:47] be God created the water that we will
[52:49] need God created the air that will
[52:52] breathe God created everything that we
[52:54] need but on top of all that he created a
[52:57] position and Authority
[53:01] Hallelujah so I understand that it is
[53:03] his purpose for us now we didn't create
[53:06] ourselves no and so we may have
[53:09] something and aim something we want to
[53:11] do but no we are here to serve a purpose
[53:13] there is nothing that God did that is
[53:16] without a purpose
[53:19] and so if God had a purpose that purpose
[53:22] must of necessity come to pass Allelujah
[53:25] and so for us to Manifest this this
[53:29] attribute to to manifest
[53:31] and and being the role and position that
[53:34] God has called it us to be
[53:37] we have to be in harmony with God
[53:40] because our position is dependent on his
[53:42] word
[53:43] our privilege our Authority is dependent
[53:45] on his word and so we have to be in
[53:48] harmony with him
[53:50] sure we came from him
[53:51] and that is the difference between man
[53:54] and all other creation
[53:57] we came from God hallelujah
[54:00] and so because for us to fulfill what we
[54:03] we have
[54:04] we started manifesting the attributes of
[54:07] God
[54:07] we started exercising authority of our
[54:10] creation
[54:11] we could speak to the wind we could
[54:14] speak
[54:15] to the sun we could speak to the trees
[54:19] that the lion and all these wild animals
[54:21] were tame before man we could exercise
[54:24] all of that why
[54:27] because that was God's purpose and as
[54:30] long as we're in harmony with him we
[54:32] were exercising that Authority and today
[54:35] I come to say we are going back
[54:40] now like I said we need that
[54:42] relationship of Harmony
[54:44] to fulfill God's purpose for us
[54:47] but at the same time God also needs that
[54:50] same relationship of Harmony to fulfill
[54:52] that purpose for us
[54:54] for his purpose to fulfill it as God
[54:57] needs that relationship of Harmony
[54:59] because God needs a divine order and his
[55:02] Spirit operates in his divine order
[55:05] and he never he doesn't go outside of
[55:08] that
[55:09] right and so if we are here today
[55:14] and we want salvation
[55:17] the divine order is faith
[55:20] education will not do it
[55:22] fasting 21 days will not do it we can
[55:26] jump up and down and make our best right
[55:28] here and just it will not do it the
[55:30] divine order is faith
[55:32] Hallelujah if you want healing it's like
[55:35] that now if we step outside of that
[55:37] let's say we talk of something
[55:41] like a sister wants to have a baby now
[55:43] there's no magic like snapping your
[55:45] finger and a baby baby will come out of
[55:47] you no it's nine months right that is
[55:50] divine order you want to know the word
[55:53] for your day you go to the prophet that
[55:55] is divine order and any time that divine
[55:58] order is in place God's spirit moves
[56:01] freely Hallelujah
[56:03] and so God needs that relationship for
[56:06] his purpose to be fully fulfilled in us
[56:09] now we have to remember that
[56:11] in creation or through creation God
[56:15] himself was also transformed
[56:18] and I understand that that is a bit of a
[56:20] difficult statement to make but that is
[56:22] what the message teaches us the true
[56:25] creation God was transformed first he
[56:28] was Elohim he was a self-existent one he
[56:31] was the god who lived alone but once he
[56:35] created us he became Jehovah Hallelujah
[56:38] The God Who lives with his family no in
[56:42] adoption
[56:43] 1965 Bible says he made a man an amateur
[56:48] God
[56:49] so he is in self-existence anymore
[56:52] he exists with his family
[56:55] now he's Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one
[57:00] who exists with his family
[57:03] now God made man to be predominant over
[57:06] all the Earth he had dominion and the
[57:09] Earth was man's Dominion is that
[57:10] scripture then if that is his domain he
[57:14] was God over the Earth he could speak
[57:16] and it will be so he could speak this
[57:18] and it will be so oh there he is god
[57:21] Jehovah the one who once existed in
[57:25] self-existence but now exists with his
[57:28] family and his little ones with him
[57:30] there you are
[57:33] Hallelujah
[57:35] aren't you glad that the very identity
[57:37] of God is linked with us so if God
[57:40] cannot die we cannot die
[57:43] Hallelujah if God is omnipotent we are
[57:46] omnipotent praise the name of the Living
[57:48] God that is purpose of God for our lives
[57:52] Hallelujah and so you are an attribute
[57:54] of him
[57:55] he is still Jehovah tonight we are an
[57:58] expression of him praise the name of the
[58:00] Living God so even when he came to die
[58:03] he was looking for a part of him that
[58:05] makes him Jehovah Hallelujah
[58:09] now we found out in Genesis that
[58:11] when God looked at all that he had
[58:14] created
[58:15] the Bible says he was pleased
[58:18] and that like we just read
[58:21] he blessed it
[58:23] and he said be fruitful and multiply and
[58:26] replenish the Earth what was God doing
[58:29] he was filling the Earth with his image
[58:32] and his likeness as present his
[58:35] attribute with all of this subjection to
[58:39] him after we came from him and we
[58:42] expressing of him so God wanted to fill
[58:44] the Earth with his likeness
[58:47] it has not happened but it's the purpose
[58:50] of God hallelujah and so it must of
[58:52] necessity come to pass that is why I'm
[58:55] here to say we are going back
[58:58] Hallelujah
[59:02] now the Bible says at the end of Genesis
[59:04] that God saw
[59:06] what he had made
[59:07] and it was good
[59:10] Hallelujah and so this is what God
[59:14] intended for us
[59:16] and so that is where we are going back
[59:18] to
[59:19] so we are going back to the time
[59:22] when God could visit man in the garden
[59:25] we are going back to the time when man
[59:28] had complete access to God when God will
[59:32] come in fellowship with man a man will
[59:34] fellowship with God praise the name of
[59:36] the Living God
[59:38] now
[59:40] in God's provided way of approach to
[59:42] Fellowship
[59:43] Abraham says fellowshipping around the
[59:46] world there is something great about it
[59:49] man loves to Fellowship even to the
[59:52] unconverted man he will want a business
[59:54] deal he will go out and talk to his
[59:57] friend buy a little dinner and they'll
[59:59] sit together and eat talk of a business
[1:00:02] problems and fellowship around one
[1:00:04] another because they have things in
[1:00:06] common
[1:00:08] as my old southern mother used to tell
[1:00:10] me birth of a feather flock together
[1:00:13] and that's a lot of Truth in that and I
[1:00:17] wonder about that then if we'll go back
[1:00:20] to the beginning all things begin in
[1:00:22] Genesis and in Genesis we found out that
[1:00:25] God created man for his Fellowship
[1:00:29] God loves to come down and to fellowship
[1:00:32] with his people
[1:00:33] Hallelujah but why
[1:00:37] because there was a divine order
[1:00:39] praise the name of the Living God
[1:00:44] so God loves the divine order in which
[1:00:46] we wear in the Garden of Eden
[1:00:49] where man was in the garden in the
[1:00:53] position that God created him everything
[1:00:55] else was in the position that God
[1:00:57] desired for it to be and we were
[1:00:59] fulfilling the purpose for which God
[1:01:01] created us hallelujah so that was
[1:01:04] perfect harmony and there was perfect
[1:01:06] Fellowship halleluia perfect harmony
[1:01:09] with God perfect Fellowship because that
[1:01:12] was his purpose for us and since his
[1:01:14] purpose cannot be defeated
[1:01:16] we are going back
[1:01:18] praise the name of the Living God
[1:01:20] now in the message Fellowship
[1:01:23] Abraham says now
[1:01:26] when God made man
[1:01:29] in the beginning to fellowship with him
[1:01:32] then this man was in perfect Fellowship
[1:01:35] in the Garden of Eden
[1:01:37] he was in perfect fellowship with God
[1:01:40] and how it must have been on that day
[1:01:43] when God will come down the cool of the
[1:01:45] evening and call Adam he and Eve would
[1:01:47] come up and they would worship God and
[1:01:50] they'll fellowship and commune one with
[1:01:52] the other that's the very thing that
[1:01:54] calls us together like this sitting
[1:01:57] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:01:59] Jesus fellowshipping in the Holy Spirit
[1:02:02] no difference in us we are all one in
[1:02:04] Christ Jesus in that Perfect Harmony of
[1:02:07] Fellowship there is nothing like it I've
[1:02:09] ever found on Earth is to come together
[1:02:12] in Heavenly places and have communion
[1:02:15] fellowship with God and with each other
[1:02:18] that's what God intended in the garden
[1:02:22] halleluia
[1:02:25] now
[1:02:27] in this order
[1:02:29] there was no room for the devil
[1:02:31] and so now the devil threw the serpent
[1:02:34] attacked the woman
[1:02:37] or should we say he attacked Humanity
[1:02:42] or maybe even better say he had attacked
[1:02:44] God's divine order
[1:02:47] Hallelujah and how did he do it because
[1:02:50] there's a divine order if he just gets
[1:02:52] one out of place that is all it takes
[1:02:55] that is so and that is what he did WOW
[1:02:57] by interpreting the word to the woman
[1:03:01] or you can say interpreting or
[1:03:03] misinterpreting because he's not called
[1:03:05] to interpret the word so once he takes
[1:03:08] that role he's misinterpreted already
[1:03:11] Hallelujah now remember that was the
[1:03:14] attack then
[1:03:15] that is the attack still today
[1:03:18] and so remember if the devil wants to
[1:03:22] come after us he will attack God's
[1:03:24] divine order
[1:03:26] he wants to go after the children why
[1:03:28] does he do he goes after marriages
[1:03:31] praise the name of the Living God and so
[1:03:33] let's just understand these things that
[1:03:35] there are certain basic things that are
[1:03:37] in the Bible they are there to fulfill
[1:03:39] God's purpose like I said there's
[1:03:40] nothing that God instituted just for the
[1:03:44] sake of doing no there's always a
[1:03:46] purpose and that purpose unfortunately
[1:03:49] has been switched in these days
[1:03:52] but then he created a people and
[1:03:55] restored a word that together will go
[1:03:58] back to restore the divine order so that
[1:04:01] his purpose will be fulfilled again we
[1:04:04] are that people
[1:04:10] so over and over Abraham speaks about
[1:04:12] divine order but ah
[1:04:14] I don't I can't read all the quotes here
[1:04:16] still with me I have a few to read
[1:04:22] if you remember the story of brother
[1:04:24] Abraham in Finland and when this little
[1:04:27] boy the two boys were strapped with the
[1:04:30] car and one died and the other didn't
[1:04:33] die and brother Brown got there saw the
[1:04:35] Dead one prayed for the dead one the
[1:04:37] Dead one came back to life
[1:04:39] and then the other one who was in the
[1:04:42] hospital was dying and the parents
[1:04:45] minded their way to brother Abraham
[1:04:48] and
[1:04:50] they came with the direct request the
[1:04:52] mom said come and heal our boy well I
[1:04:55] don't heal I cannot heal so then Brown
[1:04:57] has to explain divine order is God who
[1:05:00] heals he said well you hear the other
[1:05:02] one he said no God did that and God
[1:05:06] actually showed me by a vision
[1:05:08] he says okay then see a vision
[1:05:12] you can never underestimate the love of
[1:05:14] a mother
[1:05:16] see have you seen for for our boy
[1:05:19] he says no I can't so again you have to
[1:05:22] explain divine order
[1:05:23] and then as he goes on he says now are
[1:05:27] you believers they said no he said so
[1:05:29] you're asking a lot when you are
[1:05:32] yourself not the believer so in simple
[1:05:34] times he explained to them that well the
[1:05:36] boy is very little if he dies it's going
[1:05:38] to heaven
[1:05:40] but if you die as unbeliever you'll
[1:05:42] never see the boy
[1:05:44] now if you die as Believers even if the
[1:05:47] boy dies you'll see him again
[1:05:49] and so
[1:05:50] but but all what I want to bring across
[1:05:53] is that there's a divine order
[1:05:56] so when you explain that okay even after
[1:05:58] you accept him then you can claim his
[1:06:01] promise then they thought they cannot
[1:06:04] lose by accepting the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:05] and they did and the Lord was faithful
[1:06:08] praise the name of the Living God
[1:06:11] and so all what I want to say is this
[1:06:13] don't allow the devil to break any
[1:06:16] divine order in your life
[1:06:20] don't get out of position
[1:06:22] don't get out of place even if it cost
[1:06:25] you your job stay in your position in
[1:06:27] God's program
[1:06:30] because that is how the spirit of God
[1:06:32] moves and God has a purpose for pleasing
[1:06:35] you where he has placed you
[1:06:37] Hallelujah
[1:06:42] now um
[1:06:44] there's another place where Abraham
[1:06:46] speaks about Moab and Israel
[1:06:49] and he says they are both religious
[1:06:52] but the mobiles look down upon the
[1:06:54] Israelites
[1:06:55] and he said yes because they don't have
[1:06:57] the denomination that we have
[1:06:59] they don't have a king
[1:07:01] they don't have a land of Their Own
[1:07:04] they are just tent dwellers they are
[1:07:07] Renegades moving around and then Barbara
[1:07:10] says they fail to see the smitten Rock
[1:07:14] they failed to see their brass serpent
[1:07:16] they failed to see a prophet that they
[1:07:19] had received a message and they were
[1:07:21] going to their promise under a divine
[1:07:24] order
[1:07:26] and that is what makes the difference
[1:07:27] now I believe there are people here
[1:07:30] tonight who have received the prophet
[1:07:32] who have received a message who have
[1:07:34] received a visitation of the pillar of
[1:07:35] fire Hallelujah and that was my purpose
[1:07:39] and the purpose is that we are going
[1:07:42] back
[1:07:43] praise the name of the Living God
[1:07:48] Hallelujah
[1:07:49] so even in Satan saying God still
[1:07:52] requires divine order right
[1:07:58] now from the Garden of Eden we know that
[1:08:01] the pure word of God
[1:08:04] produce the son of God who was in
[1:08:06] perfect harmony with God
[1:08:09] now we also know that the devil cannot
[1:08:11] create
[1:08:12] and that's because the devil has no word
[1:08:15] listen the most perverted of word is
[1:08:19] God's word pervaded
[1:08:21] the devil cannot claim it as his own
[1:08:23] he just progresses and uses for his
[1:08:25] purpose but you see the perverted word
[1:08:28] also produced a hybrid man seed of the
[1:08:31] serpent who in it was in every way a man
[1:08:34] and yet a murderer
[1:08:36] right he had the characteristics of his
[1:08:38] father
[1:08:39] now we should also have the
[1:08:41] characteristics of our father
[1:08:43] and so from that time civilization has
[1:08:46] evolved on the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:08:48] and Evil
[1:08:51] and so we missed an entire civilization
[1:08:54] of God
[1:08:55] we don't even remember how it was
[1:08:58] we know almost nothing about it unless
[1:09:00] what we read about from the Bible
[1:09:03] about all along the evolution has been
[1:09:05] on the knowledge of true and Evil
[1:09:08] and that is because that is the choice
[1:09:10] that we made
[1:09:13] but now
[1:09:16] that knowledge
[1:09:18] the Tree of Life sorry was God's purpose
[1:09:21] for us
[1:09:22] and so now we have to go back to it
[1:09:25] and that's what God is restoring to a
[1:09:28] particular people praise the name of the
[1:09:30] Lord
[1:09:30] now I'm going to read something about
[1:09:32] the power of transformation
[1:09:35] Rebrand says now he has six thousand
[1:09:37] years to do it with his poison spirit
[1:09:40] and he was talking about the devil
[1:09:42] and how did he do it now this is the
[1:09:45] Striking part and listen close down he
[1:09:47] did it by civilization
[1:09:49] now that sounds strange but that's what
[1:09:52] I'm going to make a statement here that
[1:09:54] will keep you guessing maybe for a few
[1:09:55] minutes I hope not but did you realize
[1:09:58] this no I'm not trying to support
[1:10:00] ignorance
[1:10:01] but did you know that Civilization
[1:10:04] Science Education and the things that we
[1:10:06] cherish so great today
[1:10:08] is they're very instrument of Satan
[1:10:11] even civilization
[1:10:13] civilization never come by God
[1:10:17] civilization come by Satan now I'll
[1:10:20] prove that to you by the word just in a
[1:10:22] few minutes civilization is not of God
[1:10:25] for let me show you
[1:10:26] in this civilization the more civilized
[1:10:29] we get as we work through science we are
[1:10:32] always killing ourselves
[1:10:34] this civilization has built up to its
[1:10:37] Pinnacle now and we got death in this
[1:10:41] civilization we got sin in this
[1:10:43] civilization we've got sickness in this
[1:10:45] civilization that can't be of God
[1:10:49] so God
[1:10:51] his own great Kingdom that is to come we
[1:10:54] will have a civilization but it will not
[1:10:57] be anything like this it won't be by
[1:10:59] science it will be a faith Civilization
[1:11:02] by the word see there's this scientific
[1:11:06] civilization we have is
[1:11:11] exactly Satan's trap
[1:11:15] Hallelujah so we completely Miss That
[1:11:18] civilization and yes I'm grateful for
[1:11:20] what we have today but it's nothing
[1:11:22] compared to what God intended for us
[1:11:26] and because it was his purpose we must
[1:11:29] of necessity go back
[1:11:32] now if it is going to be a world-based
[1:11:34] civilization
[1:11:36] then what happens when we receive the
[1:11:38] full word
[1:11:39] what happens when it is restored to us
[1:11:42] right so faith in the word of God
[1:11:45] actually is initiation into God's
[1:11:48] civilization that is to come and
[1:11:50] remember it's an eternal civilization
[1:11:52] praise the name of the Living God
[1:11:54] now let me read this
[1:11:57] God's power to transform
[1:12:00] Abraham says
[1:12:07] and there will not be this kind of civil
[1:12:10] as a civilization in the world to come
[1:12:12] there will be no automobiles or nothing
[1:12:15] that science has ever done
[1:12:17] there will be no such things in the
[1:12:19] world that is to come but it will be
[1:12:21] God's Own type of civilization that he
[1:12:23] will set up in the Glorious Reign for in
[1:12:25] this civilization there is sickness dead
[1:12:27] sorrow griffs and wants but in that
[1:12:30] Kingdom that is to come there is no
[1:12:31] death no sorrow no sickness no old age
[1:12:35] oh God it'll all be new there in your
[1:12:41] civilization
[1:12:43] Hallelujah
[1:12:45] and so you see
[1:12:48] today we've we've made a lot of
[1:12:49] advancements we all know that
[1:12:52] I can finish from here
[1:12:55] and be in Edmonton in two or three hours
[1:12:59] and even that
[1:13:01] I'll go in in warmth I won't be
[1:13:04] suffering all the call that
[1:13:06] that we have now that is scientific
[1:13:09] advancement
[1:13:10] we can talk about the speed of cars and
[1:13:13] the speed of planes I can leave here and
[1:13:16] maybe be in Africa in
[1:13:18] 18 hours
[1:13:20] maybe even 16 hours
[1:13:23] right and so that is simple that is that
[1:13:25] is advancement
[1:13:27] and we ought to be grateful for that
[1:13:31] today
[1:13:33] uh
[1:13:35] we can see a baby in the womb
[1:13:39] we can't diagnose the baby in the womb
[1:13:41] we can even start treating the baby in
[1:13:44] the womb before they are born
[1:13:46] and that is good
[1:13:48] but what if there is no sickness
[1:13:52] and that's the other civilization
[1:13:54] what if we could travel at the speed of
[1:13:56] thought
[1:13:58] then of what uses the supersonic or
[1:14:00] whatever name we give it
[1:14:02] and so what is going on is that we don't
[1:14:04] have a feel of how that is but it makes
[1:14:08] a complete nonsense of all that we think
[1:14:10] is great right now and that is what
[1:14:12] we're going back to
[1:14:15] he didn't do that just for Rachel just
[1:14:18] waste away
[1:14:20] no he did it and we were at the helm of
[1:14:24] that and we are going back to it
[1:14:26] Hallelujah
[1:14:29] so we have no memory of what we missed
[1:14:33] but we have a fortress of it praise the
[1:14:36] name of the Living God
[1:14:38] now interest
[1:14:41] reference is all this modern
[1:14:42] civilization the whole educational
[1:14:45] program the whole scientific program is
[1:14:48] all contrary to God's word and his will
[1:14:50] civilization is absolutely
[1:14:53] there will never be a civilization in
[1:14:55] the world that is to come like this one
[1:14:57] this is a perverted civilization
[1:15:01] God had his first civilization upon the
[1:15:03] earth when he spoke his words and they
[1:15:06] come up every seed of his clan and in
[1:15:10] that Civilization there was no death
[1:15:12] sickness or sorrow
[1:15:15] Hallelujah
[1:15:16] praise the name of the Living God so
[1:15:20] parallel systems came up
[1:15:23] the pure World produced a man in harmony
[1:15:26] with God and produced a civilization
[1:15:30] and then the perverted word produced a
[1:15:32] man
[1:15:33] who opposed everything divine
[1:15:36] and It produced
[1:15:39] a perverted civilization
[1:15:41] unfortunately our choice was a
[1:15:43] preventative civilization but God's
[1:15:46] purpose cannot be defeated amen
[1:15:54] so in spite of that attack on God's
[1:15:58] divine order in the garden
[1:16:00] which is what created this perverted
[1:16:02] civilization that Abraham calls it God
[1:16:05] has always sought to reconcile his
[1:16:07] children
[1:16:08] he has always sought to bring back his
[1:16:10] children to himself why it says because
[1:16:13] it is his purpose or it was his purpose
[1:16:15] from the beginning
[1:16:16] and so when you recognize who you are
[1:16:18] when you recognize where you are from
[1:16:21] when a word comes to tell you where you
[1:16:24] are from what is it doing you have found
[1:16:27] your way back and that is why I come to
[1:16:30] say we are going back
[1:16:34] now like I said uh
[1:16:38] when the Jubilee trumpet sounds
[1:16:40] is for the people of the covenants right
[1:16:44] if you're not of the Covenant
[1:16:46] it may be
[1:16:48] a great trumpet or it may be nice
[1:16:51] but if you have the Covenant when you
[1:16:53] hear it you react
[1:16:55] when you hear it you claim your freedom
[1:16:58] and that is what all of this has been to
[1:17:01] emphasize Who We Are
[1:17:03] to emphasize who we've been
[1:17:06] and to tell us that we can go free we
[1:17:08] can go back
[1:17:10] now I'm reading for Satan's Eden and
[1:17:13] time is far gone already I will try to
[1:17:17] read
[1:17:18] portions quickly
[1:17:20] the God has attributes in his body
[1:17:23] now you did not know anything when you
[1:17:25] were in your father
[1:17:27] but yet science and God's word proved
[1:17:30] that you were in your father
[1:17:31] but you know nothing about it
[1:17:35] now that's the way now now that's the
[1:17:39] way God was in the beginning every son
[1:17:41] and every daughter of God was in God at
[1:17:45] the beginning
[1:17:46] you don't remember it now but you were
[1:17:49] there
[1:17:50] and as children of God we are part of
[1:17:52] God's attribute that was in him
[1:17:54] praise the name of the Lord
[1:17:57] he says then when we went to take when
[1:18:00] he went to take a little rest his
[1:18:02] enemies lived in
[1:18:05] if animus lived in in this discipline
[1:18:08] with disease and took it over
[1:18:12] by misinterpreting his program to his
[1:18:14] children see he slipped in the enemy of
[1:18:18] God slipped in and misinterpreted the
[1:18:20] word
[1:18:27] Hallelujah
[1:18:28] so I'll just cut some of them now so the
[1:18:32] fall in the garden broke the harmony
[1:18:34] between God and man
[1:18:37] but you feel if you were in him
[1:18:40] then it becomes his responsibility to
[1:18:44] restore you
[1:18:45] thank you brother Toby for that ceremony
[1:18:48] and he does that by restoring the word
[1:18:51] for our day
[1:18:53] you see when God sets out to restore the
[1:18:55] word
[1:18:56] he was setting out to restore man back
[1:18:59] to his original position Hallelujah
[1:19:02] so the word gave man his position right
[1:19:06] the word
[1:19:08] restores man
[1:19:11] in God's divine order in the beginning
[1:19:14] and so we lost it by this believing
[1:19:16] and God is working to restore it now
[1:19:19] Hallelujah and so when I say we are
[1:19:22] going back it is on the authority of the
[1:19:24] word that there is something that we
[1:19:27] bypass and it has been God's desire to
[1:19:30] restore and because it's his purpose
[1:19:32] because it's his plan and because I've
[1:19:35] seen that he's restored to you and I so
[1:19:38] then I have the authority to say yes we
[1:19:41] are going back
[1:19:43] Hallelujah
[1:19:45] and so that is why what it has been
[1:19:48] restored to us
[1:19:49] we have to take it
[1:19:51] and we have to eat it
[1:19:53] thank you brother Gilbert we have to
[1:19:55] take it and we have to eat it because
[1:19:58] there are real lives of victory
[1:20:01] therein lies are restoration therein
[1:20:04] lies our way back there is no other way
[1:20:07] the one who placed it in that position
[1:20:09] is working to bring us back and he says
[1:20:13] this is the way he's doing it Hallelujah
[1:20:16] in the church at the last young Church
[1:20:19] age programs says the word always came
[1:20:21] by a prophet and always will
[1:20:25] that this is the law of God is evident
[1:20:27] even by a casual search of scripture
[1:20:32] now if you have Revelation you see it
[1:20:34] clearly otherwise you can't even see
[1:20:37] that you will Challenge and say yeah it
[1:20:39] comes to my pastor oh it comes to this
[1:20:41] great bishop and it comes to that
[1:20:42] evangelist no it comes to the prophet
[1:20:45] Hallelujah he says the unchanging God
[1:20:47] with unchanging ways invariably sent his
[1:20:49] prophet in every age where the people
[1:20:52] are strayed from divine order
[1:20:54] with both the theologians and the people
[1:20:57] having departed from the word of God God
[1:20:59] sends his servant to these people in
[1:21:02] order to correct false teachings and
[1:21:04] lead the people back to God
[1:21:07] you see what the message is doing you
[1:21:09] understand why it was sent to you
[1:21:12] praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:21] now you may be asking
[1:21:25] because when we say certain things
[1:21:28] what the devil does is tell you well
[1:21:31] it's in the Bible we are seeing the
[1:21:32] message so it's true God is restoring
[1:21:35] his word and with that he's restoring
[1:21:38] the people back to their position
[1:21:40] but it's not for you
[1:21:42] right that's what he comes to tell you
[1:21:45] so how do you know that it's for you
[1:21:48] yes we may not remember that we were in
[1:21:50] him
[1:21:51] but we have the evidence
[1:21:54] Hallelujah and what is the evidence
[1:21:57] he's brought the word to us
[1:21:59] we've received it we've believed it and
[1:22:03] we are living it
[1:22:04] that is why I can say we are going back
[1:22:08] because that is the confirmation Now
[1:22:11] understand that in this end time for us
[1:22:13] it came by Elijah's Ministry
[1:22:16] and and that is right now what I'm doing
[1:22:19] with the children but that is a little
[1:22:22] different because it's
[1:22:23] slowly a little bit of time and and you
[1:22:27] cannot go very deep but slowly it's
[1:22:29] necessary they have to know why we are
[1:22:31] different they have to know why we will
[1:22:33] Skip and drive distance to come here
[1:22:36] when there are churches bigger churches
[1:22:39] close by our houses
[1:22:41] they have to understand it that God has
[1:22:44] a specific purpose and you were chosen
[1:22:46] for that
[1:22:47] Hallelujah and how do I know that and
[1:22:50] and so this is what I like if parents
[1:22:53] could just
[1:22:54] talk to the children now what did you
[1:22:56] learn about Sunday School
[1:22:57] you know
[1:22:59] just just talk to them tell them
[1:23:01] something uh question them teach them a
[1:23:05] little bit make them know that they can
[1:23:07] also ask you questions
[1:23:09] because it's it's important not just to
[1:23:12] be good Christians quite frankly that's
[1:23:14] not what I do down there no not good
[1:23:17] Christians no to know why we are
[1:23:19] different
[1:23:20] and what is God's purpose for us and
[1:23:23] that's for us alone
[1:23:25] listen
[1:23:27] and I this is there it's not enough time
[1:23:29] for me to go through every Elijah
[1:23:31] Ministry but I can at least I can
[1:23:33] mention the original Elijah Ministry
[1:23:36] when it burst on the scene it was
[1:23:39] complete condemnation and rebuke to
[1:23:41] their denominations
[1:23:42] they couldn't accept it when that
[1:23:45] Ministry broke out straight away when
[1:23:47] when a break there will not be rain on
[1:23:50] the earth until I call for it then he's
[1:23:53] gone what was it judgment
[1:23:56] the last time he comes on the scene
[1:23:58] Mount Carmel show down call the people
[1:24:00] let's go and he slaughtered us all them
[1:24:03] prove that God is the only living God
[1:24:05] judgment the next time I have missed him
[1:24:08] in the garden of neighbors oh have you
[1:24:11] killed and you are coming to inherit
[1:24:13] what was it judge when you pronounced
[1:24:15] judgment on him and on his entire family
[1:24:17] and on Jezebel
[1:24:19] even when they say go and bring that man
[1:24:21] can you imagine you're going to bring
[1:24:23] one old man you need a military Captain
[1:24:27] with 50
[1:24:29] I'm sorry
[1:24:30] I'm a little Captain with 50 military
[1:24:32] men to go and bring one man
[1:24:35] so they themselves they had their fear
[1:24:37] before they will approach them but even
[1:24:38] that if I be man of God let Fire come
[1:24:40] and consume that and they are gone 50
[1:24:42] they are gone so over and over again
[1:24:45] Elijah's Ministry was a rebuked to their
[1:24:49] denominations
[1:24:50] that is why they can never accept it
[1:24:52] they can never like it they can never
[1:24:54] bring it to the mainstream
[1:24:56] and I always say it go to any Bookshop
[1:24:59] if there's any left go there Christian
[1:25:01] Bookshop and ask for a book of William
[1:25:03] Brown see if you'll find it
[1:25:05] no
[1:25:06] why and God permits it because it was
[1:25:09] for a very special lady
[1:25:12] Now understand that when all of this
[1:25:14] happened he was actually sent to a
[1:25:16] gentile lady
[1:25:17] is that right he was sent to zaraphat or
[1:25:21] if you read the New Testament sister
[1:25:22] raptor is the same he wasn't desire
[1:25:24] about which is Insider so that is at the
[1:25:26] past the northern borders of of Israel
[1:25:31] so this is this was in Lebanon then it's
[1:25:34] still in Lebanon today
[1:25:35] it was never part of Israel so
[1:25:38] the ministry was sent to a particular
[1:25:40] Gentile woman
[1:25:42] did the woman receive it Hallelujah
[1:25:45] aren't you glad that it was sent to you
[1:25:47] it was specific listen even when God was
[1:25:50] calling Elijah he says I've commanded a
[1:25:53] widow woman to take care of you
[1:25:56] so it's not just anything that Widow man
[1:25:58] was commanded you are under command from
[1:26:01] God to receive that message
[1:26:04] praise the name of the Living God and it
[1:26:06] is coming to sell the purpose for which
[1:26:08] it was sent
[1:26:10] so don't receive it and still doubt is
[1:26:14] it for me
[1:26:15] it wouldn't come to you
[1:26:17] and when I say it wouldn't come to you I
[1:26:19] mean you won't believe it enough to say
[1:26:21] that I believe the message
[1:26:23] yeah because many people hear it and
[1:26:26] they turn their back it didn't come to
[1:26:28] them
[1:26:29] right like when
[1:26:33] when Elijah's Ministry was targeting a
[1:26:37] particular General you saw how it went
[1:26:39] somebody got captured went to the house
[1:26:43] spoke the wife heard it another person
[1:26:46] heard it they all didn't think it was
[1:26:48] for them and then the general name and
[1:26:51] had it he said no this is for me this is
[1:26:53] my call you understand it so when you
[1:26:56] respond this and and you go to this cold
[1:26:58] weather and come and sit here don't
[1:27:00] question whether it's for you because
[1:27:02] you see when you embrace it when you
[1:27:05] accept it the first benefit for that
[1:27:07] woman what was it
[1:27:09] the food was guaranteed throughout the
[1:27:11] family
[1:27:13] rather we have food
[1:27:15] since that we have food we have enough
[1:27:17] food today
[1:27:19] praise the name of the Living God
[1:27:21] and because she stayed there and at that
[1:27:24] because that was all that was available
[1:27:26] and she added what was the second
[1:27:28] benefit she received the resurrection
[1:27:32] I'll just leave it at that because
[1:27:33] there's too much in there but I just say
[1:27:36] this to and let you understand that God
[1:27:39] has thought of you
[1:27:40] he had a purpose for you from the
[1:27:42] foundation of the earth yes our Humanity
[1:27:45] God in the way but it does not defeat
[1:27:46] God's purpose and he is bringing us back
[1:27:49] to that purpose
[1:27:51] that is why we're sitting here so please
[1:27:53] we have the food let's eat it
[1:27:57] Hallelujah
[1:28:03] I'm reading from the audition Church age
[1:28:05] programs is already the visible
[1:28:07] manifestations of what I've been telling
[1:28:09] you are seen all around us
[1:28:12] their communicable move of the test is
[1:28:14] factual
[1:28:15] but also it is a fact that the prophet
[1:28:17] for the last age must be bringing forth
[1:28:20] a message from God that will for around
[1:28:22] the second coming of the Lord
[1:28:24] for by his message with the hearts of
[1:28:26] the children returned back to the
[1:28:28] Pentecostal fathers and with the
[1:28:30] restoration of the word will come the
[1:28:32] restoration of the power
[1:28:36] with the restoration of the word comes
[1:28:38] the restoration of the power
[1:28:40] if you're looking for that power where
[1:28:43] do you find it eat the word eat the book
[1:28:50] I said
[1:28:51] so the revealed word on one hand is for
[1:28:54] the bride it feels the bright it
[1:28:57] empowers the bride the perverted word it
[1:29:00] distracts the bride from God
[1:29:03] and there's so many of that around
[1:29:06] go to the internet go anywhere at all
[1:29:09] now social media everybody is preaching
[1:29:13] their specialty for Africans is often
[1:29:16] prophecy
[1:29:18] soccer and politics
[1:29:20] oh this one is going to win elections
[1:29:21] here and this one is going to score this
[1:29:24] margin
[1:29:25] like like it's so perverted it's it's
[1:29:28] just ugly
[1:29:30] but God has his pure word still
[1:29:33] and this is For Those whom he has he
[1:29:35] intends to restore back to the original
[1:29:40] and so let's remember that just like
[1:29:42] everything else
[1:29:44] that God does there is a purpose
[1:29:46] Hallelujah
[1:29:48] when he sends the message there is a
[1:29:50] purpose
[1:29:51] it is not a hidden purpose
[1:29:53] no it is to send us back to the
[1:29:55] beginning Hallelujah
[1:29:58] his purpose for us before creation which
[1:30:01] is a declared in his word which we
[1:30:03] bypass by unbelief his restoredness back
[1:30:06] to us back to that Hallelujah
[1:30:10] now what makes it difficult for many
[1:30:12] people is the fact that
[1:30:14] the message was not sent to everyone
[1:30:18] and without notion of of justice and
[1:30:21] everything and give it to everybody no
[1:30:23] God came for his own
[1:30:26] what came out of him is what he's
[1:30:28] looking to restore
[1:30:31] praise the name of the Living God
[1:30:34] I don't want to sound like
[1:30:36] a Gilbert and all the Israel but yes
[1:30:39] when it flashes your identity before you
[1:30:41] he's saying you belong here that is not
[1:30:43] you
[1:30:44] Hallelujah
[1:30:46] Hallelujah so this is what brings us
[1:30:50] back to the beginning now I'm reading
[1:30:52] this and I'll be closing in a just one
[1:30:56] or two chords
[1:30:58] I'm reading why and how to be Shepherds
[1:31:02] 1964. Brian says it wasn't his clergy
[1:31:06] man it was in the theologians that's
[1:31:08] right it wasn't the denominational
[1:31:10] people no it was Shepherds why there was
[1:31:14] a sheep born that's the reason
[1:31:16] see his subject heard it God knew
[1:31:22] exactly who God knew would believe it
[1:31:25] God sent his message to those who would
[1:31:28] believe it
[1:31:32] praise the name of the Living God
[1:31:35] so if you are here
[1:31:36] you've received it you've believed it in
[1:31:40] your own feeble way you're making the
[1:31:42] effort to live it don't despair
[1:31:46] it was sent to you for a purpose
[1:31:48] and God will not relent until he see his
[1:31:51] purpose fulfilled until he see you
[1:31:54] manifested in the way he wants you
[1:32:00] right he's all wisdom he knows where to
[1:32:02] send his message who will believe it
[1:32:04] Hallelujah
[1:32:07] now uh he says now this is what here is
[1:32:11] out Elijah says having got a great big
[1:32:13] bunch of cooperation now he's talking
[1:32:15] about his ministry now this is good and
[1:32:18] somebody to go around and make so many
[1:32:19] hundred churches corporate and big bring
[1:32:22] great singers and so forth then Barbara
[1:32:25] Brown says I don't desire that
[1:32:28] imagine God has sent you to pray to the
[1:32:30] world send healing to the world he
[1:32:33] doesn't desire people going to get
[1:32:35] hundreds of churches to cooperate and
[1:32:37] all that no I don't desire that that
[1:32:41] ain't mine I believe the ministry is to
[1:32:45] the elect
[1:32:46] to those who want to listen
[1:32:50] Hallelujah
[1:32:52] do you want to listen
[1:32:55] because God sent it for his own
[1:32:59] Hallelujah and if we send it to you then
[1:33:02] it has to fulfill the purpose for which
[1:33:04] he sent it
[1:33:06] praise the name of the Living God we
[1:33:08] have a place to go to we have our own
[1:33:10] civilization waiting for us hallelujah
[1:33:14] so we've been reminded that we were
[1:33:17] created to have dominion
[1:33:19] the devil got us to doubts
[1:33:22] we lost our position our god-giving
[1:33:24] position
[1:33:25] but let's understand it this way that
[1:33:28] position we didn't earn it in the first
[1:33:29] place
[1:33:30] it's not as if there was a competition
[1:33:32] and we struggled and we did our best
[1:33:33] time we got there no
[1:33:35] it we got we were there because it was
[1:33:37] God's purpose
[1:33:39] and what I'm saying is that the purpose
[1:33:41] of God can never be defeated
[1:33:44] so if we lose it forever God is not God
[1:33:48] and for him to be God he has to restore
[1:33:50] us
[1:33:51] that is why he is responsible for us
[1:33:55] and that's why he sought and made a way
[1:33:57] to restore that word to us because that
[1:34:00] word restores the divine order and in
[1:34:02] that divine order God oppressed
[1:34:04] completely and that is why I saw the
[1:34:06] power to rust so we start even living
[1:34:08] that life experiencing that that that
[1:34:10] that position and pray of privilege here
[1:34:13] on Earth before we go to him
[1:34:17] so whatever happens brother sister all I
[1:34:19] came to say is we are going back
[1:34:27] so we know that God the word has been
[1:34:29] restored and when the restoration comes
[1:34:31] the Power
[1:34:32] but Abraham says we don't realize how
[1:34:34] important it is to stay true to this
[1:34:37] word now when he says this word he
[1:34:40] actually tells you that is that message
[1:34:42] that the seventh angel is bringing
[1:34:44] right so how important it is for us to
[1:34:47] stay true to this word
[1:34:49] but now we have it
[1:34:52] it's on our phones
[1:34:54] we have easier assets than fast food
[1:34:59] I believe God made sure of that
[1:35:02] so what are we doing with it Hallelujah
[1:35:10] I'll call the musicians
[1:35:12] the spoken word is the original silver
[1:35:14] branches you were supposed to be here
[1:35:17] in the right way at the beginning
[1:35:21] hallelujah thank you brother Gilbert but
[1:35:25] being that you come the way you did you
[1:35:27] are subject to the fall
[1:35:29] but being that you are predestinated you
[1:35:32] hear the word
[1:35:33] you understand why you heard the word
[1:35:35] you are predestinated God sends a
[1:35:38] prophet to come and tell you that I came
[1:35:40] to tell you this because you are
[1:35:41] predestinated should we doubt it
[1:35:44] let's not break the divine order amen so
[1:35:48] being that you come this way you are
[1:35:50] subject to the fall but being that you
[1:35:53] are predestinated you hear the word it
[1:35:55] brings you right back where you were
[1:35:58] predestinated amen
[1:36:06] Hallelujah okay I think that the time is
[1:36:09] far spent I'll leave some of these codes
[1:36:12] but all I want to say is
[1:36:14] we have it
[1:36:16] it has a purpose there's a reason why he
[1:36:18] brought it to us
[1:36:21] and it has to achieve a purpose
[1:36:23] are we going to allow ourselves or are
[1:36:25] we going to resist it
[1:36:27] it's far easier to allow ourselves than
[1:36:29] to resist it when you are God's choice
[1:36:34] think of Jonah
[1:36:38] think of The Prodigal Son when you are
[1:36:40] God's choice
[1:36:42] you are better off relaxing Letting Go
[1:36:45] surrender to this word and let it have
[1:36:48] its affected you that was God's purpose
[1:36:51] let it be fulfilled praise the name of
[1:36:52] the Living God you are way better of
[1:36:54] doing that
[1:36:56] resistance
[1:36:57] let's read on it but more than that
[1:37:00] let's focus on feeding on it exclusively
[1:37:04] but that word has a purpose it's
[1:37:07] different it's different from any other
[1:37:08] one that comes
[1:37:10] it is for you
[1:37:12] I'm not saying somebody else is not
[1:37:14] going to ever know
[1:37:15] but for you and I
[1:37:17] this is what brings us in the rapture
[1:37:20] this is what send us back to where we're
[1:37:22] coming from
[1:37:24] Hallelujah let's be on our feet
[1:37:26] [Music]
