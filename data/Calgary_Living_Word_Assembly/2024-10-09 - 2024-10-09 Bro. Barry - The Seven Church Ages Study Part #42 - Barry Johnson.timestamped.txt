[23:42] you God bless you
[23:45] everyone amen welcome to church thank
[23:48] the Lord for his goodness upon us I just
[23:50] want to share something quickly before
[23:53] we start I was looking at the book of
[23:55] Jeremiah and um in the first chapter
[23:58] there's a verse there that um struck me
[24:03] this morning Jeremiah 1:12
[24:05] says in KJV then said the Lord unto me
[24:09] thou Hast well seen for I will hasten my
[24:12] word to perform it and in Amplified
[24:15] version it said then said the Lord to me
[24:17] you have seen well for I am alert and
[24:21] active watching over my word to perform
[24:25] it in this book Jeremiah had that called
[24:28] Jeremiah and Jeremiah was initially
[24:30] hesitant and then he saw a vision of an
[24:32] Almon tree and that Vision represents
[24:35] fruitfulness represents positive things
[24:38] and God reassured Jeremiah that he will
[24:41] be with him and he will guide him and I
[24:44] believe that that word is is instant
[24:47] God's
[24:48] word um to Jeremiah is the same thing he
[24:50] saying to us today says he alert and
[24:53] active watching over his word to perform
[24:57] it

[57:51] out that perfection in our lives Lord
[57:53] they work out patience in ways that that
[57:56] we could never orchestrate and father we
[57:59] just want to commit each need into your
[58:01] hands because you are God and we we
[58:03] trust you that way father amen we love
[58:06] you and we thank you we just commit
[58:08] these requests into your hands now in
[58:10] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[58:15] thank you musicians if you have your
[58:16] Bibles tonight I'd like to continue on
[58:18] with the study in the exposition of the
[58:21] seven Church
[58:23] ages thank you sisters for the special
[58:26] amen so wonderful to set an atmosphere
[58:30] on a Wednesday night thank you brother
[58:32] faren for stepping in and each one that
[58:35] just brings of their sacred portion week
[58:38] after week it really makes a
[58:42] difference in Revelations 2: 18 we're
[58:46] carrying on in the thyrian church
[58:52] age and unto the angel of the church in
[58:55] th tyia
[58:57] write these things saith the Son of God
[59:00] who hath his eyes like unto a flame of
[59:04] fire and his feet are like fine
[59:07] brass I Know Thy works and charity and
[59:11] service and faith and thy patience and
[59:15] thy works and the last to be more than
[59:18] the first not with understanding I have
[59:20] a few things against thee because thou
[59:22] sufferest that woman Jezebel
[59:26] which calleth herself a prophetess to
[59:29] teach and to seduce my servants to
[59:32] commit
[59:33] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[59:36] unto
[59:37] idols and I gave her space to repent of
[59:41] her fornication and she repented
[59:44] not behold I will cast her into a bed
[59:49] and them that commit adultery with her
[59:52] into Great
[59:53] Tribulation except they repent of of
[59:56] their deeds and I will kill her children
[59:59] with death and all the churches shall
[1:00:02] know that I am he which searcheth the
[1:00:06] Reigns and
[1:00:07] hearts and I will give unto every one of
[1:00:10] you according to your
[1:00:13] works but unto you I say and unto the
[1:00:17] rest in
[1:00:19] thota as many as have not this Doctrine
[1:00:23] and which have not known the depths of
[1:00:25] sin Satan as they
[1:00:27] speak I will put upon you none other
[1:00:32] burden but that which ye already hold
[1:00:35] fast that which he have already hold
[1:00:39] fast till I come and he that overcometh
[1:00:43] and keepeth my Works unto the end to him
[1:00:46] will I give power over the
[1:00:48] Nations and he shall rule them with a
[1:00:51] rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter
[1:00:55] shall they be broken to
[1:00:57] Shivers even as I received of my father
[1:01:02] and I will give him the Morning
[1:01:04] Star he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:01:08] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:01:11] let's just bow one more time Heavenly
[1:01:14] Father we thank you for that ear to hear
[1:01:17] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:01:19] Lord and father if there's anybody that
[1:01:22] just doesn't have that ear tonight we
[1:01:24] pray that Lord
[1:01:26] you would give it to him and father
[1:01:29] sometimes our ears can get a little
[1:01:31] stopped up and father we pray that you
[1:01:33] would just clear out the channels for us
[1:01:36] Lord amen if they have become stopped up
[1:01:39] Lord if our experience has grown cold
[1:01:42] father we pray that you would light that
[1:01:43] fire one more time and Lord Jesus we
[1:01:46] will rise and we will trim our
[1:01:49] lamps father we thank you for the ear to
[1:01:53] hear what your spirit says to the
[1:01:54] churches we just commit the rest of this
[1:01:56] service into your hands all the words
[1:01:59] that are spoken all the thoughts that
[1:02:00] are thought our very hearts Lord we just
[1:02:04] commit them into your hands now in Jesus
[1:02:06] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[1:02:09] tonight you may be
[1:02:13] seated just uh couple of announcements
[1:02:15] quickly we have the Men's breakfast in
[1:02:17] Edmonton this weekend we're certainly
[1:02:19] excited for
[1:02:21] that um just to see the old friends and
[1:02:24] maybe make some new ones
[1:02:26] we have the 20th of October Youth Event
[1:02:29] after the
[1:02:30] service and uh for those who have not
[1:02:34] noticed I'm sure everyone probably has
[1:02:36] by now we just like to thank brother
[1:02:38] Joshua and brother Henry for their
[1:02:40] efforts and the assist by Brother John
[1:02:44] panicker God bless you Brothers we have
[1:02:46] a a new monitor at the back and it's a
[1:02:49] tremendous blessing for those who are up
[1:02:52] here to be able to just look back and
[1:02:54] not have to try and look down
[1:02:56] and fight with the lights they reflect
[1:02:59] off the the screen here so God bless you
[1:03:01] Brothers I really appreciate your
[1:03:03] efforts I'm sure we all
[1:03:06] do it's a wonderful thing to be in the
[1:03:10] service once again we're working on the
[1:03:14] tharan church age I don't think we're
[1:03:16] going to finish it tonight and I don't
[1:03:18] think there's any rush to do it but I
[1:03:20] think it's just a uh another portion of
[1:03:24] this incredible study of the exposition
[1:03:26] of the seven Church ages I'll just
[1:03:29] continue on where we left off last week
[1:03:32] um on paragraph 48 I Know Thy works and
[1:03:37] uh this is out of the thot tyan Church
[1:03:40] age the eulogy it's near the end of the
[1:03:44] eulogy I Know Thy works and the last to
[1:03:47] be more than the
[1:03:50] first this is certainly
[1:03:52] remarkable as the darkness of the age
[1:03:57] increased as the sorry this is certainly
[1:04:01] remarkable as the darkness of the age
[1:04:03] increased as the honor role of the
[1:04:06] martyrs grew lengthier day by day they
[1:04:09] worked all the harder they served all
[1:04:13] the more and their faith
[1:04:16] increased how tragic it was that in the
[1:04:19] Ephesian age love
[1:04:22] waned and truly nothing is said of the
[1:04:25] increased labor of love in the other
[1:04:28] ages but in this age in the darkest of
[1:04:32] all ages they served him even more yes I
[1:04:38] just want to turn over to
[1:04:40] Hebrews and read a scripture that just
[1:04:42] came to my heart as I was sitting in the
[1:04:45] back
[1:04:46] tonight the thyrian church age is during
[1:04:50] the Dark Ages and I believe the Bible
[1:04:53] speaks about what these people had to go
[1:04:56] through in Hebrews chapter 11 this is
[1:04:59] the chapter of
[1:05:01] faith and I just want to
[1:05:04] read maybe verse
[1:05:06] 35 of Hebrews chap 11 we'll start with
[1:05:10] verse
[1:05:11] 35 women received their dead race to
[1:05:13] life again and others were
[1:05:16] tortured not accepting
[1:05:19] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[1:05:22] better
[1:05:22] Resurrection speaking directly to what
[1:05:25] we're talking about about here verse 36
[1:05:28] and others had
[1:05:31] trial of cruel mockings and scourgings
[1:05:35] yay moreover of bonds and
[1:05:38] imprisonment they were
[1:05:40] stoned they were saw aunder they were
[1:05:44] tempted were slain with the
[1:05:47] sword they wandered about in sheep skins
[1:05:50] and goat skins being destitute Afflicted
[1:05:54] tormented
[1:05:56] of whom the world was not
[1:05:58] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[1:06:01] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[1:06:04] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:06:08] good report through
[1:06:10] faith they reive not the promise
[1:06:15] why God having provided some better
[1:06:19] thing for
[1:06:21] us that they without us should not be
[1:06:24] made perfect
[1:06:27] that's the people that brother bram's
[1:06:29] talking about here in this
[1:06:31] book what a lesson that is he
[1:06:34] says there is no ceasing of this
[1:06:37] gracious service of Love unto the Lord
[1:06:41] but rather an increasing of
[1:06:45] it and here we have the prophet I
[1:06:48] believe giving us a nugget he says that
[1:06:52] is the
[1:06:53] secret let the enemy
[1:06:56] attempt to thwart our service to the
[1:06:59] Lord our reply is increased
[1:07:03] service when the faint are crying in
[1:07:06] fear that is the time to shout the
[1:07:10] Victory and that's where we left off
[1:07:13] last
[1:07:14] Wednesday he goes on to say I Know Thy
[1:07:17] works and the last to be more than the
[1:07:21] first now as we have already said this
[1:07:24] age is called called the Dark Ages
[1:07:27] because it was indeed the darkest period
[1:07:29] of all
[1:07:30] history and it wasn't just because
[1:07:33] people were killed and tortured it
[1:07:36] wasn't just because of what we read
[1:07:37] about there brother Ram gets into detail
[1:07:40] here he says it was the age of Pope
[1:07:43] Innocent III who claimed that he was the
[1:07:47] Vicor of
[1:07:48] Christ Supreme Sovereign over the church
[1:07:53] and the world who instit instituted the
[1:07:57] Inquisition which under his Direction
[1:07:59] shed more blood than at any other time
[1:08:04] except in the
[1:08:06] reformation and we know that this is
[1:08:08] history we can look this up and see this
[1:08:12] it's interesting that it's not talked
[1:08:14] about
[1:08:14] though it was the age of pornocracy the
[1:08:19] rule of
[1:08:22] Harlot sarius III
[1:08:26] had a mistress and filled the papal
[1:08:29] choir with
[1:08:32] paramor and bastard sons and turned the
[1:08:35] papal Palace into a den of
[1:08:39] robbers anastasius III was smothered to
[1:08:42] death by
[1:08:44] marosia who was mistress to
[1:08:48] sadarius John I 6 was marosia
[1:08:51] illegitimate son John the 7th was the
[1:08:55] Grand grandson of
[1:08:56] marosia and he violated widows and
[1:08:59] virgins and was killed while in the act
[1:09:02] of adultery by the woman's enraged
[1:09:07] husband now this is the the leadership
[1:09:11] behaving this
[1:09:12] way it was the age of papal Schism for
[1:09:17] two lines of popes one ruling from aagon
[1:09:21] and the other from Rome cursed and
[1:09:23] fought each other the popes were not
[1:09:26] only guilty of immoral sex acts
[1:09:28] fathering scores of illegitimate
[1:09:30] children committing sodomy Etc but were
[1:09:34] guilty of selling Priestly offices to
[1:09:37] the highest
[1:09:39] biders they boiled it down to an
[1:09:42] economic
[1:09:44] transaction
[1:09:45] terrible it was the age when the light
[1:09:49] glowed ever so
[1:09:51] faintly yet the few Believers labored
[1:09:54] more fervently as the darkness increased
[1:09:57] until toward the end of the age many
[1:10:00] arose attempting reforms their labors
[1:10:04] were so fervent that they paved the way
[1:10:07] for the oncoming
[1:10:09] Reformation therefore as the word says
[1:10:12] concerning that age your last End of the
[1:10:15] Age works are more than the
[1:10:18] first they were running a
[1:10:21] marathon and they still had some energy
[1:10:24] at the end
[1:10:25] the word
[1:10:26] thara has various meanings amongst which
[1:10:29] is continual Sacrifice by many this is
[1:10:34] believed to be a prophecy concerning the
[1:10:36] use of the mass which is continual
[1:10:40] presentation of the sacrifice of Christ
[1:10:44] that is an excellent thought but it
[1:10:46] might also mean the continual sacrifice
[1:10:48] in lives and labors of the True
[1:10:51] Believers of the Lord surely the tharan
[1:10:56] saints were the cream of the crop full
[1:11:00] of the Holy Ghost in faith created unto
[1:11:03] good works showing forth his praise
[1:11:07] holding not their lives dear unto
[1:11:10] themselves but gladly giving all as a
[1:11:14] Sweet Sacrifice unto the Lord boy I
[1:11:18] think when we get a little bit down
[1:11:19] sometimes in our lives it might do us
[1:11:21] some good just to think about what these
[1:11:23] people had to go through our brother and
[1:11:25] sisters so that the cause of Christ
[1:11:28] could still go
[1:11:29] on the rebuke out of Revelations
[1:11:32] 2:20 not withstanding I have a few
[1:11:34] things against thee because thou
[1:11:36] sufferest tolerate that woman Jezebel
[1:11:40] which calleth herself a prophetes to
[1:11:42] teach and to seduce my servants to
[1:11:46] commit fornication and to eat things
[1:11:49] sacrificed to
[1:11:51] Idols now with this verse I want you tow
[1:11:55] drop down to verse 23 and see the proof
[1:11:59] of a great truth I have been bringing to
[1:12:02] your attention all along Revelations
[1:12:05] 2:23 and I will kill her children with
[1:12:08] death and all the churches shall know
[1:12:12] that I am he which searcheth the Reigns
[1:12:16] and hearts you see we can try and hide
[1:12:20] all we want even the pious popes and
[1:12:24] those people who have the false
[1:12:25] religions can try and hide all they want
[1:12:29] but we know the spirit searcheth the
[1:12:32] Reigns of the hearts we can't hide that
[1:12:36] I have been saying right
[1:12:38] along that there are actually two
[1:12:41] churches though the spirit speaks to
[1:12:43] both of them in each age isn't that
[1:12:45] wonderful the spirit speaks to both of
[1:12:48] them nobody will be without
[1:12:50] excuse as though they were but one here
[1:12:54] it is plainly stated that there are
[1:12:57] churches and that it states just as
[1:12:59] plainly that some of those churches most
[1:13:02] evidently do not know that he is the one
[1:13:07] who searcheth the Reigns and the hearts
[1:13:10] he is going to prove to them that this
[1:13:13] is so now then what churches will be
[1:13:17] those that do not know this truth of
[1:13:20] course it is the false Vine group
[1:13:24] because the True Believer certainly know
[1:13:26] that judgment begins at the house of God
[1:13:31] that's where brothers and sisters when
[1:13:33] we hear the word coming forth we're not
[1:13:35] saying my that's a good service but I
[1:13:39] know I'm good it's where we say Lord how
[1:13:42] does that apply to me in my life how
[1:13:44] does it apply to me in my heart I heard
[1:13:47] something epic and I'm going to repeat
[1:13:49] it probably many times going forwards
[1:13:52] for me I thought it was epic you know
[1:13:54] the the soul the difference between the
[1:13:56] soul and the spirit the soul is who we
[1:14:00] are the soul we can't change the soul is
[1:14:04] what's Eternal the spirit is what we
[1:14:08] think we are the spirit is what we think
[1:14:11] we are the spirit is who we think we are
[1:14:15] but the soul can't be changed the soul
[1:14:17] is exactly who we are and when people
[1:14:20] die there's that separation between Body
[1:14:23] Soul and Spirit the soul and the spirit
[1:14:26] start to pull apart from each other but
[1:14:28] you know there's only one thing that can
[1:14:30] divide the soul and the spirit and we
[1:14:32] know that that's the word of God Amen
[1:14:35] the word of God is what separates our
[1:14:38] personalities from our souls I thought
[1:14:41] that was so good and I'm probably going
[1:14:42] to bring a little bit of a study on that
[1:14:44] in the future here but it's just a
[1:14:46] wonderful thing to know that he is
[1:14:49] looking at us he knows exactly who we
[1:14:51] are and judgment does begin at the house
[1:14:53] of God and you know but I know brother
[1:14:55] brandham says it it's got to start from
[1:14:57] the pulpit and it's got to go all the
[1:14:58] way through to the janitor it's got to
[1:15:00] go from the top to the bottom from the
[1:15:02] bottom to the top through every single
[1:15:04] heart mind and soul in the church and
[1:15:07] when it does watch out because we're
[1:15:09] going to see a Revival
[1:15:11] amen he goes on to say and they being
[1:15:13] God-fearing judge themselves that they
[1:15:17] be not
[1:15:18] judged now why does God call these
[1:15:20] churches his churches even though they
[1:15:23] are the false Vine
[1:15:25] the truth of the matter is that they are
[1:15:30] Christians are they amen that's what he
[1:15:33] says here the truth of it is that they
[1:15:36] are
[1:15:37] Christians but they are not Christians
[1:15:40] of the spirit my they are Christians of
[1:15:44] the
[1:15:45] flesh they are bearing the name in vain
[1:15:50] Mark 7:7 how be it in vain do they
[1:15:53] worship me teaching for doctrines
[1:15:55] the Commandments of
[1:15:57] men but indeed they are Christians for
[1:16:00] what else could they be a Muhammad
[1:16:04] hamadan is a muhammadan that is his
[1:16:08] religion no matter how he lives it
[1:16:10] because he subscribes in theory to what
[1:16:14] the Quran teaches in the same way a
[1:16:17] Christian is a Christian as long as he
[1:16:20] subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the
[1:16:23] son of God born to a virgin was
[1:16:26] crucified and died and rose again that
[1:16:29] he is the savior of mankind
[1:16:33] Etc in fact in the leodan age there will
[1:16:37] be those who call themselves Christians
[1:16:39] because they
[1:16:41] subscribe to the Fine qualities of
[1:16:44] Jesus while reserving to themselves the
[1:16:48] right to deny his
[1:16:51] deity and I think it's beautiful when we
[1:16:54] read read this when we study this I
[1:16:58] think it's so good to just pause and
[1:17:00] zoom out and remember that we look at it
[1:17:02] through the lens of progressive
[1:17:05] revelation because we're not just
[1:17:07] looking at it as Jesus Christ he came he
[1:17:10] he was born he he was crucified he died
[1:17:13] he rose again that's that's mainstream
[1:17:16] Christianity as Believers of this word
[1:17:20] we know that his spirit is still here on
[1:17:22] Earth but where is it it's in the true
[1:17:25] church it's in those that are able to
[1:17:28] say Amen to his word amen Christian
[1:17:31] Scientists have done that already as
[1:17:34] well as multitudes who preach a social
[1:17:37] gospel we just make it comfortable for
[1:17:39] everyone God loves all of us and he does
[1:17:42] he would that all would come to
[1:17:44] repentance wouldn't he he is a nominal
[1:17:48] Christian and belongs to the
[1:17:50] church but he is not a true or spiritual
[1:17:56] believer that kind of a Believer is one
[1:17:59] who has been baptized in the body of
[1:18:02] Christ and is a member of him amen but
[1:18:06] nonetheless it is in God's order that
[1:18:08] the tears grow up with the
[1:18:12] wheat and they are not to be
[1:18:14] uprooted that is the command of God
[1:18:17] their day for binding and burning is
[1:18:19] coming but is not yet but I'll say from
[1:18:23] this when this book was being authored
[1:18:25] and published that is actually taking
[1:18:28] place now we are all coming to the place
[1:18:32] where you look around the world stand up
[1:18:33] and be counted unless you're willing to
[1:18:36] subscribe to a certain belief structure
[1:18:38] the social justice machine will come our
[1:18:41] way and expose us for not actually being
[1:18:45] chosen one side or the other but I think
[1:18:48] it's just beautiful because we
[1:18:50] know we know that there will be a day
[1:18:52] where there will be a short powerful
[1:18:53] demonstration of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:58] hallu carrying on paragraph 57 here he
[1:19:01] says so the spirit is speaking to this
[1:19:03] mixed group on the one hand he's
[1:19:06] praising and on the other he's
[1:19:08] rebuking he has told what is right to
[1:19:12] the True Believer now he warns what the
[1:19:15] false Vine must do if it is to stand
[1:19:18] Justified before the Lord just makes me
[1:19:22] think of that story where brother Bram
[1:19:23] talked about it where
[1:19:25] someone said you know I was sitting in
[1:19:27] service and alls I heard was that I'm an
[1:19:30] eagle I'm an eagle I'm an eagle and
[1:19:33] someone else they said man all she said
[1:19:35] was I was a buzzard or or a crow I can't
[1:19:38] remember what the what the bird was
[1:19:41] but just makes me think of
[1:19:45] that yes so the spirit is speaking to
[1:19:48] this mixed group on the one hand he's
[1:19:50] praising on the other he's rebuking he
[1:19:52] has told what is right with the truth
[1:19:54] True Believer and he warns what the
[1:19:57] false Vine must do if it is to stand
[1:19:59] Justified before the Lord and isn't that
[1:20:01] beautiful out of our scripture Amen to
[1:20:04] know that he knows what's going on in in
[1:20:09] the life of the people there the ones
[1:20:11] that actually sufferest that woman
[1:20:14] Jezebel which called herself a
[1:20:18] prophetess he says I gave her space to
[1:20:21] repent of her fornication and she
[1:20:23] repented not even even the one who was
[1:20:26] so terrible who was leading everyone
[1:20:29] astray we know the story of Jezebel I
[1:20:31] probably should get into it maybe next
[1:20:33] week we will um talk a little bit about
[1:20:35] Jezebel how she came and actually caused
[1:20:38] Israel to sin only because Ahab married
[1:20:43] her because of his Allegiance with her
[1:20:45] because he chose to marry her he brought
[1:20:47] the whole country into sin but here in
[1:20:51] this scripture two times he mentions
[1:20:53] giving her giving them a space to
[1:20:56] repent but they didn't what a loving God
[1:21:00] we serve James
[1:21:02] 1:14 and
[1:21:05] 15 that woman Jezebel but every man is
[1:21:08] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[1:21:11] lust and enticed and when lust hath
[1:21:16] conceived how does it
[1:21:18] conceive in the
[1:21:20] mind when we get that Temptation and it
[1:21:23] comes our way I'm we don't say get lost
[1:21:27] when we see that woman on the street and
[1:21:29] we don't look
[1:21:31] away it's conceived in our mind when it
[1:21:34] goes that next step that's the
[1:21:36] conception it bringeth forth sin because
[1:21:40] we know to do wrong is sin when we know
[1:21:43] better to do wrong is actually sin and
[1:21:46] sin when it's finished bringeth forth
[1:21:49] death the trick of the devil is to say
[1:21:52] to us well you sure
[1:21:55] won't die you're not going to die if you
[1:21:57] eat of that fruit my goodness you're not
[1:22:00] going to get struck by lightning when
[1:22:01] you step off that curd and W curb and
[1:22:03] walk across the street no but we're not
[1:22:05] talking about physical death this is not
[1:22:08] speaking of physical death this is
[1:22:09] talking about spiritual death total
[1:22:12] separation from the
[1:22:14] Lord the Apostle James showed us the
[1:22:17] chor that sin
[1:22:19] takes now that is a picture of exactly
[1:22:23] what is happening in the church
[1:22:25] ages as Sin started in nothing but a
[1:22:28] feeling so the death to the church
[1:22:32] started with the simple little noticed
[1:22:36] Deeds from the
[1:22:38] nicians from the Deeds it went to a
[1:22:42] Doctrine from the doctrine it embraced
[1:22:45] the power of the state and the
[1:22:47] introduction of paganism now in this age
[1:22:51] it goes to its own prophetess teacher
[1:22:55] and so it travels on until it will find
[1:22:57] itself in the Lake of Fire for that is
[1:23:00] exactly where it is going to end up in
[1:23:04] the second
[1:23:05] death now the whole Cry Of God against
[1:23:08] this fourth age is found in his
[1:23:12] denunciation of this propheus Jezebel
[1:23:16] and to understand exactly why he
[1:23:18] denounces her so we will have to look
[1:23:21] her up in history in the Bible and when
[1:23:24] we find what she did back there we will
[1:23:27] know what is going on at this
[1:23:31] time the first and very important thing
[1:23:34] that we learn about Jezebel is that she
[1:23:39] is not a daughter of
[1:23:41] Abraham nor is her induction into the
[1:23:45] tribes of Israel one of spiritual
[1:23:48] admission as was that of Ruth the
[1:23:51] moabitas no sir this this woman was the
[1:23:55] daughter of ethal king of sidon First
[1:24:00] Kings
[1:24:01] 16:31 who was the priest unto
[1:24:05] estarte he had gained the throne by
[1:24:08] murdering his predecessor
[1:24:10] philis so we see right away that she was
[1:24:14] the daughter of a murderer and we know
[1:24:17] that this manifested in the vineyard of
[1:24:20] naboth and the prophecy about how God's
[1:24:24] word is going to come to pass in ahab's
[1:24:27] life and so on but she was the daughter
[1:24:30] of a murderer this certainly reminds us
[1:24:33] of Cain and the way she became a part of
[1:24:37] Israel was not through the spiritual
[1:24:39] channels that God had ordained for
[1:24:42] Gentile admission but she came in by
[1:24:46] marriage to Ahab the king of the 10
[1:24:50] tribes of Israel now this Union as we
[1:24:53] have seen
[1:24:54] was not
[1:24:56] spiritual it was
[1:24:58] political and so this woman who is
[1:25:01] steeped in idolatry did not have the
[1:25:04] least desire to become a worshipper of
[1:25:07] the one true God but rather she came in
[1:25:11] with the avowed intentions of turning
[1:25:13] Israel away from the Lord and it's
[1:25:17] interesting because I just can't help
[1:25:19] but think perhaps I don't know for sure
[1:25:23] but perhaps she didn't even intend for
[1:25:25] that to happen her intentions may not
[1:25:28] have been to try and defile Israel
[1:25:30] although they might have been sometimes
[1:25:33] when we're under the influence of a
[1:25:34] spirit our intentions are the best but
[1:25:37] that Spirit that's inside of us is going
[1:25:39] to live out through us and cause us to
[1:25:42] behave certain ways that maybe we don't
[1:25:44] even understand maybe we can't even
[1:25:47] explain that's why we need the Holy
[1:25:49] Spirit In Our
[1:25:51] Lives now Israel the 10 tribes had
[1:25:55] already known what it was to worship the
[1:25:58] golden calves but as yet they were not
[1:26:01] sold out to idolatry for God was
[1:26:05] worshiped and the law of Moses was
[1:26:08] acknowledged I just my I just get
[1:26:11] inspired I just can't help but think
[1:26:12] about our lesson on Sunday talking about
[1:26:15] how they feared the Lord but they served
[1:26:18] their gods they feared the Lord but they
[1:26:21] still had their Groves and their high
[1:26:23] places their traditions and their ways
[1:26:26] but they feared the
[1:26:28] Lord but from the time of ahab's
[1:26:31] marriage to Jezebel idolatry progressed
[1:26:35] in a deadly fashion it was when this
[1:26:38] woman became a priestess in the temples
[1:26:42] that she erected to estarte Venus and
[1:26:45] bael Sun God that Israel came to the
[1:26:49] crisis point of her life with this in
[1:26:53] mind we can now begin to see what the
[1:26:56] spirit of God is setting forth in this
[1:26:58] thot tyrian age here it
[1:27:01] is Ahab married Jezebel and he did it as
[1:27:04] a political maneuver to strengthen his
[1:27:06] kingdom and secure it that is exactly
[1:27:11] what the church did when it Mar married
[1:27:13] under
[1:27:14] Constantine they both got together for
[1:27:17] political
[1:27:18] reasons though they put a spiritual air
[1:27:21] to it why
[1:27:25] now no one can convince me that
[1:27:26] Constantine was a Christian he was a
[1:27:30] pagan with what looked like Christian
[1:27:34] trappings he painted white crosses on
[1:27:36] his soldiers
[1:27:38] Shields he was the originator of the
[1:27:41] Knights of Columbus he put a cross on
[1:27:43] the steeple of St Sophia's thereby
[1:27:47] starting a
[1:27:49] tradition it was Constantine's idea to
[1:27:52] get everyone together the pagans nominal
[1:27:55] Christians and true Christians and for a
[1:27:58] while it looked as if he would succeed
[1:28:01] for the real Believers came along to see
[1:28:04] if they could bring back the ones that
[1:28:06] had drifted away from the word when they
[1:28:10] saw that they couldn't bring them back
[1:28:12] into the truth they were forced to break
[1:28:15] away from the body
[1:28:17] political then when they did they were
[1:28:20] called Heretics and
[1:28:22] persecuted my
[1:28:24] this next paragraph let me say right
[1:28:27] here that we have the very same thing
[1:28:30] going on right now the people are all
[1:28:34] coming together they are writing a Bible
[1:28:37] that will suit everyone whether it be a
[1:28:41] Jew Catholic or
[1:28:46] Protestant and I just can't help but
[1:28:48] think it's a probably a good time to
[1:28:50] mention they already have the abrahamic
[1:28:52] house if anybody doesn't know what that
[1:28:54] is maybe try and look it up the
[1:28:56] abrahamic house I think it might be in
[1:28:58] Saudi does anybody know where that is
[1:29:01] it's it's a temple that's built and it's
[1:29:03] built for the Jews it's built for the
[1:29:05] Christians and it's built for the uh
[1:29:08] muhammadans it's built for the uh
[1:29:12] islamics so we can have a one world
[1:29:14] religion and it's actually a functioning
[1:29:16] church and there's more of them coming
[1:29:18] up all around the world because it's
[1:29:21] supposed to happen the prophet said it
[1:29:23] there's no way around it let me say
[1:29:25] right here that we have the very same
[1:29:27] thing going on right now this was 60
[1:29:28] years ago wasn't it the people are all
[1:29:30] coming together they were writing a
[1:29:32] Bible that will suit everyone whether it
[1:29:34] be a Jew Catholic or
[1:29:36] Protestant they have their own n seeeing
[1:29:39] Council but they call it the ecumenical
[1:29:42] council and do you know whom all these
[1:29:45] organizations fight they fight the true
[1:29:49] Pentecostals I don't mean the
[1:29:51] organization called Pentecostal I mean
[1:29:54] the ones who are Pentecostal because
[1:29:56] they are filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:59] have the signs and Gifts in their midst
[1:30:03] because they walk in
[1:30:05] truth when Ahab married Jezebel for
[1:30:08] political reasons he sold his
[1:30:12] Birthright you join up with an
[1:30:15] organization and you sell your
[1:30:18] Birthright brother whether you want to
[1:30:20] believe it or
[1:30:22] not every protest group that ever came
[1:30:25] out and then went back sold their
[1:30:29] Birthright and when you sell your
[1:30:31] Birthright you're just like
[1:30:34] Esau my you can cry and repent all you
[1:30:40] want but it won't do you any good
[1:30:44] there's only one thing you can do and
[1:30:47] that is come out of her my people and
[1:30:50] stop partaking of her sins
[1:30:54] cuz if we can still hear that word those
[1:30:57] words if we can still hear the word of
[1:31:00] God then he's giving everyone a space to
[1:31:05] repent we're getting that space to
[1:31:07] repent now if you don't think I am right
[1:31:11] just answer this one
[1:31:13] question can any man living tell me what
[1:31:16] church or what move of God ever had a
[1:31:19] Revival and came back after she went
[1:31:23] into organization a and became a
[1:31:25] denomination read your histories you
[1:31:28] can't find one not even
[1:31:31] one and I I know for
[1:31:34] sure it doesn't take a lot to look back
[1:31:38] and
[1:31:39] see when when did the pants come
[1:31:43] in I know it's a touchy subject not so
[1:31:46] much around Believers but when did the
[1:31:48] pants come in when did it become fine
[1:31:49] for women to begin wearing garments that
[1:31:52] pertain to a man it changed somewhere
[1:31:54] along the way something caused that
[1:31:56] change and it wasn't very long ago that
[1:31:59] women all wore
[1:32:01] dresses in fact I was I was chuckling
[1:32:04] one time we were up at Bass proo and
[1:32:06] they've got pictures all over the store
[1:32:08] for those people that don't know it's an
[1:32:09] outdoor store but there's actually
[1:32:12] pictures in there of women climbing
[1:32:15] mountains to the top of the mountains
[1:32:18] wearing long dresses and and the boots
[1:32:21] that they wore in those days like fullon
[1:32:24] dresses climbing a mountain you wouldn't
[1:32:27] hear of that now people would say that
[1:32:29] it's unsafe there's no way that you
[1:32:30] could do it there' be all manner of
[1:32:32] excuses but you know it wasn't very long
[1:32:34] ago that women actually didn't wear
[1:32:37] garments that pertain to a man how how
[1:32:39] did it happen it's the change of of life
[1:32:43] you can look at the you're wondering how
[1:32:45] I'm getting into this I I I grew up in
[1:32:47] the penny costal Realms and uh I
[1:32:50] remember vividly seeing I've probably
[1:32:52] said it many times a woman
[1:32:54] uh speaking in tongues and she was a
[1:32:56] little woman she was elderly but she was
[1:32:58] in high heels and had short hair and
[1:33:00] earrings and a tight short mini skirt
[1:33:02] and boy could she ever speak in tongues
[1:33:04] and
[1:33:05] prophesy and is that the spirit of God
[1:33:08] it doesn't line up with the
[1:33:11] word but to take a look at that was
[1:33:14] probably 40 years ago 45 years ago
[1:33:19] where's the church
[1:33:20] today what's the condition you know
[1:33:22] brother randam said
[1:33:24] I just find it amazing because brother
[1:33:26] gram said it if you want to see where a
[1:33:27] church is at just take a look at the
[1:33:29] women right amen and I I think back to
[1:33:32] that and I think my where's that church
[1:33:34] today he says read your histories you
[1:33:36] can't find one not even one it was the
[1:33:39] Midnight Hour for Israel when she joined
[1:33:41] with the world and left the spiritual
[1:33:44] for the political it was the Midnight
[1:33:47] Hour at niia when the church did the
[1:33:49] same thing it is the Midnight Hour now
[1:33:53] that the churches are coming
[1:33:56] together now when Ahab married Jezebel
[1:33:58] he allowed her to take the state money
[1:34:01] and erect two huge houses of worship to
[1:34:04] estarte and Baal the one was erected for
[1:34:07] Baal was big enough for all Israel to
[1:34:10] come and worship there at and when
[1:34:12] Constantine and the church married he
[1:34:15] gave the church buildings and set up
[1:34:17] altars and images and organized the
[1:34:20] hierarchy that had already been shaping
[1:34:23] up
[1:34:24] when Jezebel got the power of the state
[1:34:27] behind her she forced her religion on
[1:34:30] the people and killed the prophets and
[1:34:34] Priests of God it got so bad that Elijah
[1:34:39] the messenger to his day thought he was
[1:34:41] the only one left but God had 7,000 more
[1:34:45] that hadn't bowed the KNE knee to Baal
[1:34:48] and right now out there amongst those
[1:34:51] denominations of Baptist method IST
[1:34:54] Presbyterians Etc there are some that
[1:34:58] will come out and come back to God I
[1:35:01] want you to know I am not I am not now
[1:35:06] and never have been against the people
[1:35:09] it is the
[1:35:10] denomination the system of organization
[1:35:13] that I am against I have to be against
[1:35:16] it amen for God hates it my that's
[1:35:22] beautiful I think he says it so well if
[1:35:25] people could just listen to what he
[1:35:28] said now just let us stop a minute here
[1:35:32] and rehearse what we brought out about
[1:35:34] the worship in
[1:35:36] thota I said that they worshiped Apollo
[1:35:38] who was the son God along with the
[1:35:40] emperor now this Apollo was called the
[1:35:44] averter of
[1:35:46] evil he turned evil away from the people
[1:35:49] he blessed them and was real God to them
[1:35:53] he was supposed to teach the people he
[1:35:57] explained about worship and Temple
[1:35:59] rights services to Gods about sacrifices
[1:36:03] and death and life after
[1:36:06] death the way he did this was through a
[1:36:10] propheus who sat entranced Upon A tripad
[1:36:14] tripod chair Ma and we know that she was
[1:36:18] called the Oracle do you see it here is
[1:36:22] that prophetess called Jezebel and she
[1:36:25] is teaching the people and her teaching
[1:36:29] is seducing the Servants of God and
[1:36:31] causing them to commit
[1:36:33] fornication now fornication means idol
[1:36:38] worship that is what its spiritual
[1:36:41] meaning is it is an illegal union ahab's
[1:36:45] union and Constantine's Union were both
[1:36:48] illegal both committed spiritual
[1:36:51] fornication every fornicator will wind
[1:36:54] up in the Lake of Fire God said
[1:36:58] so now then the teaching of the Catholic
[1:37:01] church the church is female it is a
[1:37:05] woman denies the word of God the pope
[1:37:10] who is literally Apollo in a modern
[1:37:13] version has taught the people to join
[1:37:15] themselves to
[1:37:19] Idols the ROM sorry the Roman Church has
[1:37:23] now become a false prophetess to the
[1:37:26] people because she has taken away the
[1:37:29] word of the Lord from the people and
[1:37:32] given her own ideas as to what
[1:37:35] constitutes forgiveness of sins what
[1:37:38] brings the blessings of God and the
[1:37:41] priests have gone so far as to State
[1:37:45] categorically that they have power not
[1:37:48] only in life but in death amen and I
[1:37:52] would have to say I agree with that
[1:37:53] because if people are following them and
[1:37:55] not following the word of God from a
[1:37:58] Vindicated Prophet then they surely do
[1:38:00] have the power over life and death
[1:38:02] because they will take people to the
[1:38:04] second death
[1:38:07] why they teach on their own that there
[1:38:11] is a Purgatory but you can't find that
[1:38:13] in the word they teach that prayers and
[1:38:16] masses and money will get you out of
[1:38:19] purgatory and into heaven works right
[1:38:23] the whole system that is based upon its
[1:38:26] teaching is false it does not lie in the
[1:38:29] sure foundation of the revelation of God
[1:38:32] in his word but lies on the shifting
[1:38:36] sinking Sands of its own diabolical
[1:38:40] untruths the church went right from
[1:38:43] organization to denomination and hence
[1:38:46] to false teaching that's right the Roman
[1:38:50] Catholics don't believe that God is in
[1:38:52] his word no no sir if they did they
[1:38:56] would have to
[1:38:57] repent and back up but they say God is
[1:39:01] in his church that would make the Bible
[1:39:05] the history of the Catholic church that
[1:39:07] isn't so look what they did to water
[1:39:10] baptism alone they took it away from
[1:39:13] being Christian baptism and make it made
[1:39:17] it a
[1:39:18] pagan one of titles it was the Catholic
[1:39:22] church that did that
[1:39:24] let me tell you what an experience I had
[1:39:26] with a Catholic priest a girl that I had
[1:39:29] baptized at one time turned Catholic so
[1:39:33] the priest wanted to interview me about
[1:39:35] her he asked what kind of baptism she
[1:39:38] had I told him I baptized her in
[1:39:43] Christian baptism which is the only kind
[1:39:46] there was to my knowledge I had buried
[1:39:50] her in water in the name of the Lord
[1:39:52] Jesus Christ the priest remarked to me
[1:39:56] that at one time the Catholic Church did
[1:39:59] that right away I asked him when the
[1:40:02] Catholic Church did that for I have read
[1:40:04] the histories and I could not find what
[1:40:07] he said he told me that it was found in
[1:40:10] the Bible and that Jesus had organized
[1:40:13] the Catholic church I asked him if he
[1:40:15] thought Peter was really the first pope
[1:40:18] he emphatically said that Peter was I
[1:40:21] asked him if the masses were said in
[1:40:25] Latin in order to ensure that they were
[1:40:28] correct and would never
[1:40:31] change he said that was true I told him
[1:40:35] that I thought they had wandered a long
[1:40:38] way from what they had in the beginning
[1:40:41] I let him know that if the Catholic
[1:40:43] Church really believed the book of Acts
[1:40:46] then I was an old-fashioned
[1:40:50] Catholic he told me that the Bible was
[1:40:53] the record of the Catholic church and
[1:40:56] that God was in the
[1:40:58] church I disagreed with him for God is
[1:41:01] in his
[1:41:03] word let God be true and every man a
[1:41:07] liar if you take away or add to that
[1:41:11] book God has promised that he will add
[1:41:14] plagues to those who add and take away
[1:41:17] their part from The Book of Life if they
[1:41:22] dare subtract ract it from Revelations
[1:41:25] 228 and
[1:41:29] 19 let me just show how the Roman
[1:41:31] Catholic Church believes that God is in
[1:41:33] the church instead of the
[1:41:36] word here is an excerpt from the Diary
[1:41:39] of Pope John uh I don't know what that
[1:41:42] is my experience during these three
[1:41:46] years as Pope since in fear and
[1:41:50] trembling I accepted this service in
[1:41:52] pure pure obedience to the Lord's will
[1:41:56] conveyed to me through the sacred
[1:41:58] College of cardinals in
[1:42:01] conclave Bears witness to this maximum
[1:42:05] and is a moving and Lasting reason for
[1:42:09] me to be true to it absolute trust in
[1:42:13] God in all that concerns the present and
[1:42:18] perfect Tranquility as regards the
[1:42:21] future this Pope states that God spoke
[1:42:25] through the church revealing his
[1:42:28] will how false now if you don't have
[1:42:31] ears to hear what the spirit says to the
[1:42:34] church that would sound like someone
[1:42:37] very
[1:42:38] religious but to be able to pick it out
[1:42:41] that he got it through the sacred
[1:42:43] College of cardinals in
[1:42:46] conclave how false brother bradam says
[1:42:49] God is in his word and speaks by the
[1:42:52] word
[1:42:54] revealing his
[1:42:55] will he also stated that he placed
[1:42:59] absolute trust in the word of men and
[1:43:03] thereby obeyed it with
[1:43:06] Tranquility why it sounds so beautiful
[1:43:09] but it is so false just like the
[1:43:13] perversion in the Garden of Eden one
[1:43:15] word off and boy we can find
[1:43:19] ourselves in a bad place now let us get
[1:43:24] get over here in Revelation 17 and see
[1:43:26] this woman the church who is living on
[1:43:29] false prophecies and not the word of God
[1:43:32] in verse one God calls her the great
[1:43:35] why is she a because she's
[1:43:38] in
[1:43:40] idolatry supposed to be married to
[1:43:42] Christ but doing something else on the
[1:43:45] side she has caught the people up into
[1:43:49] the same
[1:43:50] thing what's the cure for idolatry the
[1:43:54] word of God Amen it's not complicated
[1:43:58] brothers and sisters it's just the word
[1:44:02] so this woman is a because she has
[1:44:05] left the
[1:44:06] word there she is sitting upon many
[1:44:09] Waters which means multitudes of people
[1:44:12] this surely has to be the false church
[1:44:15] because the Church of God is small few
[1:44:19] there be that find it Matthew 7:14
[1:44:23] notice what she is like in the eyes of
[1:44:26] God no matter how wonderful she looks to
[1:44:29] people and how philosophical she sounds
[1:44:33] she is filthy drunk on her
[1:44:36] fornications now she was drunk with the
[1:44:39] blood of the martyrs just like Jezebel
[1:44:42] who killed the prophets and Priests and
[1:44:44] destroyed the people of God Who Would
[1:44:47] Not Bow Down and Worship
[1:44:50] Baal and that is exactly what the
[1:44:52] Catholic Church did they killed those
[1:44:55] who would not bow down to the popish
[1:44:57] rule those who wanted the word of God
[1:45:00] instead of the words of men were put to
[1:45:02] death usually by cruel
[1:45:05] methods but this church that dealt in
[1:45:08] death was dead itself and didn't know it
[1:45:11] excuse me there was no life in her and
[1:45:14] no signs ever followed her isn't it
[1:45:18] amazing I'll probably stop there tonight
[1:45:20] and call the
[1:45:21] musicians isn't it amazing that those
[1:45:24] people who renounced the church and
[1:45:26] state union that fornication and they
[1:45:28] said no no no I'll believe the word of
[1:45:30] God before I actually believe this
[1:45:32] fornication
[1:45:34] stuff they were given the opportunity to
[1:45:38] Simply renounce all they had to do was
[1:45:41] renounce and say I'll put the word of
[1:45:44] God aside I'll save my hide and
[1:45:47] sacrifice the word and they would be
[1:45:49] allowed to live they'd be permitted to
[1:45:51] live but there was something in inside
[1:45:53] of them there was another Spirit there
[1:45:55] wasn't there just a tremendous thing and
[1:45:58] and we have that same Spirit tonight God
[1:46:00] bless you Brothers and Sisters Let's
