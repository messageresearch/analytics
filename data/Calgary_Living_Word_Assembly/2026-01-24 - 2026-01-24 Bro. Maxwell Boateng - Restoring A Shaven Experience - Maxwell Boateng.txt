Oh music that will be told when the redee. Aren't you glad you're redeemed tonight? Oh, heat, heat. Oh sh.

Can you please put up Mercy walked in? &gt;&gt; Mercy walked in. I stood in the courtroom. The judge turned my way. It looks like you're guilty now. What do you say? I spoke up your honor. I have no defense. But that's when mercy walked in. Oh, mercy walked in and pleaded my case. Called to the stand. not saving grace. The blood was presented that covered my sin, forgiven.

He's here tonight to be touched. I believe he's here. He promises. Our brother prayed this morning or this evening. He's here. No doubt about it. He's here.

You're the one who walked away from the empty tomb that day. And you set your people free in love and liberty. Now I can walk with you every night and every day. Every night and every day. Oh, you're the father of creation. You're the risen lamb of God. You're the one who walks away from me with love and we walk with you every night and every day. every night, every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Certainly an honor and a privilege to gather together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The way that he's ordained for us &gt;&gt; on this side of eternity. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're very thankful to have brother Ethan Hammermeister and brother Maxwell Bang Jr. here with us. I'm certainly honored to be able to call them friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that uh the Lord has given brother Maxwell &gt;&gt; something for us tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I believe that it's our privilege to be able to pull on that word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's not going to be brother Maxwell Bang speaking to us tonight. It's going to be the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. We've already declared this meeting to be in his name. So, he's already here with us according to his word. There's a lot that I would like to say, but I'm just going to save it. We're certainly thankful that the Lord brought Brother Joel back home safely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was in Fernie for a few days, and I'm sure the roads were pretty slick. We just want to continue to remember brother Mvin in our prayers as he ministers the word &gt;&gt; in Japan before he goes over to Philippines. If you have a need tonight, by all means, just make it known unto him as we go to him in prayer. &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we're so thankful that we can call upon your name tonight. &gt;&gt; Father, we're so thankful that Lord, not only can we call upon you, but you answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You always hear our prayers, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, where else could we go in this life, but to you, &gt;&gt; Father? We just want to thank you for keeping us all safe on the roads today, Lord. and as we travel for bringing our brothers safely down from Edmonton, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just bless them and their their journey here, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, bless their time with us, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just continue to be with Brother Mvin, Lord, and Sister Fay in Japan, Lord. And that you would just minister to the bride over there through our brother, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, when he goes to Philippines that you would continue to just break yourself &gt;&gt; to the people, Lord, open that word through our brother. We ask. And &gt;&gt; Father, we just thank you that we can gather together tonight in your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; We just want to commit each and every need that was made known unto you tonight, Lord, by the way of an uplift hand. We know that you know the need. We know that you already have the solution, Father. &gt;&gt; We just commit them all into your hands. And we thank you, Father, for your answers to our prayers. &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, as we turn to you, we just want to commit all the words that are spoken. Father, we know that our thoughts here on earth are louder &gt;&gt; than our voices are &gt;&gt; in heaven. Father, we just want to commit the words that are spoken, the thoughts in our hearts into your hands for your care. Lord, we pray that you would be glorified with every single aspect of our service now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song? Touching Jesus is all that really matters. Certainly thankful that Brother Maxwell has come to minister. I've known Brother Max for a few years now. introduced a couple times a couple of meetings, but we've been on a an online Bible study for years. I think uh we're talking about it tonight. I think since co since 2020, we've been on the same study. We've been going through some really good stuff. But we're certainly thankful to have him here with us tonight. We know how it goes. If you go to Poland, he'll go to preaching and God will minister to our needs. Touching Jesus is all that really matters. And your life will never be the same. And there's only one way to come when you call his name. Amen. Touching Jesus. Touching Jesus is all I really need. will the same way. Let's sing it one more time. Oh, touch him Jesus. It's all your life forever. always searching just &gt;&gt; when you call on his name. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we just want to say thank you tonight, Lord. And father, we thank you to once again, Lord, we can come into your presence, Lord. Father Lord as it was said early Lord God forever two or three you are gathered in your name Lord there you are in the midst of us oh God and father we believe and we know that you are here with us oh God Lord even as Lord one time as a leazer will go Lord and try to find a bride oh Lord God for your son Isaac oh God Lord and how the prophet will say Lord the angel of the Lord was there 20 minutes earlier before he got there oh God and father we believe that you've been here oh God, Lord. And you've been waiting, oh God, Lord. And Father, we believe that this is a divine appointment, oh God, that you have with you people to know you, oh God. And and Father, Lord, in all days, Lord, you see every heart and every need to Lord that is here to know you to God. And Father, as a human, Lord, there's no way, Lord, we can know and we will be able, Lord, to minister to to God. But you are the one who is a discerner of the thoughts and intent of our hearts. To God, Lord, you are the one that knows. So father Lord everything that we going through and where we are at oh God lord and father we desire that tonight you be the one Lord who stands behind this desk oh God lord father we don't desire to see a man tonight Lord but we desire to see you oh God Lord we desire Lord that in your own sovereign way that you minister to every heart and every soul oh God Lord Father we just pray Lord you help me to get myself fed away Lord and Father I just pray you be the one Lord and the hearer of your word oh God Lord and Father Father, we pray you be the one to bring the revelation of your word, oh God, Lord, and the understanding of it, oh God, Lord.

Man, God bless you and we we appreciate the confidence and the trust to have us come and and share the word of the Lord this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh I I know you've not come to see me cuz if you came to see me, you're going to be disappointed, but I believe that you came to see the Lord. Amen. He is faithful and he knows our needs. Amen. And and I believe that he's he has an appointment with us this weekend. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but I I have been praying and it's been it's been very special. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's been just just just felt God just moving in a special way even as we've been praying and and I believe that he he he has something that he has to speak to us and &gt;&gt; and to do for us. And you know, I know sometimes in the service we can be distracted, &gt;&gt; but I just say, let's give him undivided attention. Amen. And and just stay there and pull on the word. Amen. And and and allow God to minister to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I've come with a set of notes, but I told the Lord I'm willing to go off the notes. I've told the Lord I'm willing to do whatever he desires. And so, &gt;&gt; and I believe that God wants to minister personally to everyone. You know, we are coming to a time where we know that the coming of the Lord is very close and and we we we don't want to find ourselves unprepared. Amen. And and neither do we want to be in a place where we're missing the blessings that have been given to us or be in a place where the spirit of the Lord is moving and we we we just, you know, out of it. We want to be in a place that if God is dealing with us that we ready to respond and if God is speaking to our hearts, we're ready to open our hearts and receive the word. Amen. And that's our desire. And that's been our burden on our hearts. And and that's what we we we're trusting and believing that the Lord will do for us in these meetings. Amen. Amen. We sure do bring greetings from our pastor, brother Ed Hammer Meister in in Edmonton and the saints over there. Brother Ed really wanted to make sure that I brought greetings to you, brother Barry. And to the saints here and and also brother Jerry Fox do send us greetings. Some of you know brother Jerry Fox and he really send us love and greetings to you all. and and uh we we we thank the Lord. Amen. We we grateful to him and again as we said we we we appreciate the invitation to be here. Amen. Amen. Maybe let's just take a Bibles this evening. Thank you musicians. Amen. God bless you. Go to the book of Judges this evening. Judges chapter 16. Amen. Judges chapter 16. Some of you that don't know me, well, I think my name has been mentioned. I am brother Max and full name is Maxwell. Maxwell Bang Jr. And um I'm junior because my dad is brother Maxwell as well. And uh we we we have been serving the law for the past I think 13 years now. And uh been ministering for the past nine years. And uh we we we we were born and raised in a believer's home. My dad is a minister of the gospel in Ireland and uh held sight with brother brother Andrew. Good to see sister Nave. Amen. And uh good to have some Irish person in the church. Amen. So uh my dad ministers in Ireland and uh we we we grew up believing the message and but you know we we we it's one thing to be born in the message &gt;&gt; and it's one thing to become the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen many of us you can be born in the message but until you become the message you're just born in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so for for a very long time in my life, I I was just born in the message and I was just around the message and you know I was was serving the Lord but you know I was was drawn in the world and at different ends but God got a hold of me when I moved to Ireland and begin to turn my life around and and uh not long after that he called us to the ministry and and he's been faithful. Amen. It's nothing that I did what he did and we we're grateful to the Lord for it. Amen. Amen. So Judges chapter 16, we'll read from verse 27 to verse 30. Amen. Judges 16, verse 27 to verse 30. Amen. So now the case was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samson made it part. And Samson called unto the Lord and said,"Oh Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, oh God, that I may be at once avenge of the Philistines for my two eyes." And Samson took a hold of the two middle pillars upon which the haze stood and on which it was born up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left. And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." And he bailed himself with all his might. And the haze fell upon the Lord and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which is slew in his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessing to the reason of the word. Amen. You may have your seat. Amen. Want to speak for for a few moments. Amen. And on restoring a shaven experience. Restoring a shaven experience. Amen. Restoring a shaven experience. Amen. You know, there's something based on experience. Amen. How many have ever had an experience before? &gt;&gt; There is something based on experience. Amen. When you have an experience, whatever the experience is, Amen. There is something that you can identify. Amen. With that experience, Amen. You take for example, how many have ever been sick before? If you've never been sick before, you're quite the creature. Amen. But I believe that everyone has been sick before. Amen. And and and you can identify with with what comes with sickness. Amen. You've experienced what it is like to be sick. And you can identify with the pain that comes with being sick. And you can identify with the weakness, the discomfort that comes with being sick. Amen. And how many of us have had an experience with God before? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so if you've had an experience with God before, again, you can identify, Amen, with God's saving power. Amen. You can identify with the saving grace. Amen. You can identify with his suffering, with his healing. Amen. You can identify with him being Jehovah Gyra. Amen. The God that provides all our needs. Amen. We can identify with him to being the one that makes aware where there is no way. Amen. We're the one that, you know, the calms, the raging. See, we can identify with all these things. Why? Because we have had an experience with God. Amen. We know the God is real. Amen. We are a witness of the realities of God. Amen. And we stand steadfast on these experiences that we have. Amen. Because it's something that is personal to us. Amen. So we stand firm upon them. Amen. No one can move us away from those experience. Amen. Are you with me this evening? No one can move us away from those experience. Amen. Those experience that we will have is not an experience that we had from maybe our dad telling us about us. Amen. It's not an experience that we had from the pastor telling us about it. But this is an experience that we had personally with God. Amen. It is our own experience. Amen. We were there when God came on the scene. Amen. We were there when God visited us and began to turn our lives around. We were there when God be to do a miracle in our life. Amen. Brother Brandham will say that the greatest miracle that has ever happened to us. Amen. And is the change of a sinner into a saint. Amen. It is for you going down a certain path and all of a sudden God turns you around. Amen. And changes your life. Amen. To a place. Amen. Where you are not the same anymore. Amen. Your language has changed. Amen. And your actions have changed. Amen. Everything about you has changed. What is it? It is an experience that has caused it. Amen. Because you have come face to face with God. Amen. You remember Moses. Amen. Listen. He was a man that was called Amen to deliver God's people. Are you with me this evening? He was called to deliver God's people. Amen. But but we see we see that he tried to do it in his own self with his own strength and and with his own might. Amen. And and we saw that he became a failure of it and and ended up on the back side of the desert. Amen. And it felt like that there was no way for him probably gave an openness commission. Amen. But but he there was a moment where he had an experience with God. Amen. And that experience with God, Amen, brought him back, amen, to his purpose again. Are you with me this evening? Amen. Each and every one of us were born with a purpose in our life. Amen. And what is going to bring us to that purpose, Amen, is an experience with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, for Moses to go back to fulfill his purpose of delivering, Amen. God's children, he had to have an experience with that burning bush. Amen. He had to meet face to face with God. Amen. And that's what God wants from his children. Amen. That we may have an experience with him and meet face to face with him in time tested faith. Amen. Brother man was saying is that no person has a right to call themselves a Christian until first they've had an experience with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we can't even call ourselves to be Christians if we haven't had an experience with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order for us to call ourselves Christians, we must have had an experience with God. And you see today, Satan is busy trying to keep the church away from an experience. &gt;&gt; Satan is very busy trying to keep the church away from an experience with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Satan knows Amen. Are you with me? Satan knows the effect of an experience with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows the effect of an experience with God. Listen, he thought that he had Moses whipped. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But when Moses had an experience with God, the story changed. &gt;&gt; So, Satan is very very busy to make sure that the believer never comes to a place where they have a personal experience with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that experience, Amen, is something that can change the person's life. That experience can bring God Christ on the inside of that person. That experience can bring that person to the revelation of who they are. Amen. That experience can bring that person to a place where they believe for things that are impossible. Amen. They believe for things that Amen has no reason to even believe for them. But because they've had an experience with God, amen, they can stand firm upon the word and say this can happen. Why? Because God said so. Because all we experience is healing power. Amen. So whether it be cancer, whether it be TB, if he was able to heal me of a tooth ache, he's still the same God and he's still able to heal me. Whether it be cancer, it be any disease of my life, he's more than able to still heal me again. Why? Because I have had an experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are many people we can call on the Bible when know Paul. Amen. He he was on on a certain amen. Now I want you to notice that Paul a man believed that what he was doing was right. &gt;&gt; Amen. In going and persecuting the Christians. Amen. He believed that it was right. It was the right thing to do. Amen. And you know sometimes we we we can be so consumed and be going down a certain path. Amen. And feel like this is the right thing for me to do. Amen. But God came by his way in the form of a pillar of fire. Amen. And begin to say, Paul, Amen. Why are you persecuting me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to notice that Paul recognized that it was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul recognized that it was God. And I think it's very important for the believer that when Amen. God comes by your way that we recognize that it is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That it is God speaking to me. Amen. And when God begin to speak to us and listen Paul was determined and he knew there is no way that I am wrong. &gt;&gt; But now when he asked that voice and say you know who are you? &gt;&gt; And he said that I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now now then now then now then now then now then now then now then now then now then now then now Paul begin to say but wait a minute how can you be Jesus? There is only one Lord and and and that's the only thing we've known as Israelites. And and now you were telling me and he begin to cast a revelation. You begin to see then God is showing me something that I have never seen before. God is moving me to a greater revelation of who he really is. Amen. Now, it was up to Paul to say, "Listen, Lord, if this is you, I'm going to follow you." It was up to Paul to say, "Oh, I don't care whether this is God or not. I'm just going to go ahead and do what I am doing." But you see, Paul was very sensitive. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That he said, "If this is the Lord, I will follow through." Amen. He had an experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That turned him around. &gt;&gt; Amen. An experience is so important. So Satan heads, Amen. to see the church &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; have an experience with God. &gt;&gt; And when we talk about an experience, Amen. We we're not just talking about a one and done 10. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But we're talking about a constant encounter with God, a constant fellowship with God, a a constant connection with God. Amen. And tonight, as I'm talking about the church, Amen. I am not just talking about the church as as just the body that is here. But you know that you are the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are the church. Amen. You are the call to one. Each and every individual of us, we bring and make together the body of Christ. Ask the church. Amen. And so I'm not just referring to to the group, but I'm speaking to you personally. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask the church. Ask the called age. Amen. So Satan hates Amen. And the reason he hates to see the church, we as individual come in in contact with God continually is because when we come in contact with God, we becomes the dynamics &gt;&gt; of the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; When we are constantly in contact with God, &gt;&gt; we become the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the church. &gt;&gt; Now, we know this quote very well, brother Brandham. What shall I do with Jesus called Christ? &gt;&gt; Is that the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. that that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body. &gt;&gt; You stay with me. &gt;&gt; It said but when that head and body anoint together. &gt;&gt; It said the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that. Even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And take a Floyd to the skies. The dynamics is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So a constant encounter with God, amen, makes us the dynamics of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. It brings a man in contact with the head. Now let me say this now. Brother Brandham here. He said that when the headstone is coming down to unite with the body. But let me declare to you tonight that the headstone has come down. Listen church, we are no longer talking about a future event. Are you with me this evening? It is no longer future event that is coming. It is here. Amen. The headstone is here. Amen. The headstone is united now with the body. Are you with me this evening? And that's why I'm saying it is so important. Amen. that we don't miss the moving of the spirit, that we don't miss the moving of God in our lives. Amen. Even in this meetings, amen, as God will begin to move, we ought to be careful not to miss that moving. Amen. Because listen, the hapstone is here. We're not waiting for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is come. It is here. It is anointed. The dynamics is here. The Holy Spirit is here. Amen. What is the hapstone here to do? It is here to lift the church up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, many times we talking about the resurrection and and we always thinking about the resurrection of the dead that we buried. It's true. We're going to have that resurrection. &gt;&gt; But there is a resurrection now. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a resurrection now. &gt;&gt; In the rising of the sun, I believe brother say what a resurrection this is. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. And listen, it wasn't the resurrection of the saints, &gt;&gt; but there was a resurrection taking place. And brother Ben said, "What a resurrection this is." What is this resurrection? Amen. It is Christ being risen in you. &gt;&gt; It is Christ risen in you to bring you in your rightful position as a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this resurrection &gt;&gt; rising us from our dead works of sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. Into a into the glorious liberty of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this bride has been called. Amen. To to come back into a rightful position &gt;&gt; with full power, &gt;&gt; with full authority, &gt;&gt; with full assurance &gt;&gt; of who she is. Amen. &gt;&gt; But for this to happen, it's going to take a constant &gt;&gt; refilling, &gt;&gt; a constant experience, &gt;&gt; a constant encounter &gt;&gt; with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The dynamics of the church. You see church, I believe we never have to come to a place where where we get away from from an experience with God. You know many times it is so easy for us to get to a place where we just get so content and and you know just just you know just so happy and you know we're doing well family's doing great and everybody's doing fantastic you know and so we just get relaxed and &gt;&gt; you know we we always you know we we we we we doing the the the chovin ministry you know how many know the chovin ministry you know is the chovin ministry those that you know when the word is being preached the chauvinist Oh, that's for that brother over there and that's for that sister over there. And you know, we we get into the sho ministry business, you know, and we always shoving it off to someone else and because we think that we good. &gt;&gt; Amen. We think that we're doing fantastic. And church, I believe we are doing fantastic, but there is more. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; There is more. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I never want to come to a place where I am satisfied. There is always more &gt;&gt; that we can guess. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can because we can never run eyes of the Holy Spirit. It is the eternal spirit of God. Amen. That that God has released upon the bra to unfold this purpose in us. Amen. Because listen, it's the Holy Spirit that's going to bring us to the revelation of our healing. Is the Holy Spirit going to bring us to the revelation of our deliverance and our peace? Amen. See, God is still alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is still living. God is still working through his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still working through you and me. There is another book of Acts that is being written again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to read a quote that we know very well. If you're a believer in all day, you've read this quote before. Amen. But brother Bon begin to talk about the church. Amen. And the church age book. And it says, "Now remember this is that Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I want I want us to take this slowly. Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of acts. Now are we the true church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he said but the book of but the book of revelation amen shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defoil it make it lukewarm formal and powerless. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Now this is the season that we're living in is the live the church age lukewarm powerless formal cold. Now that's what the antichrist spirit will do. Now remember what we said Satan is very careful that we don't have an experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he knows the effect of the experience. &gt;&gt; And here brother Brandham's name telling us that this antichrist spirit will try to come into the church to defoil it and make it look warm, cold and powerless. Yes. &gt;&gt; But it says that the book of Revelation said it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word. It said right down to the time that he's cast down cast into the lake of fire is that he he fo that he cannot stand it. He knows that if the church if the people get the true revelation &gt;&gt; of the true church. Now listen to these things &gt;&gt; of what she is, &gt;&gt; what she stands for, &gt;&gt; and that she can do the greater works. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Now this is you. &gt;&gt; Listen, I am not talking about just the church as I'm talking about you personally. &gt;&gt; This is you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you know who you are, what you stand for, that you can do the greater works, you will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that it's time that we begin to read this message &gt;&gt; for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Behold, I sent you, Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I sent it to you personally. Amen. &gt;&gt; Invisible army is that if they get the true revelation of the two spirit within the framework of the Christian church &gt;&gt; and boy the spirit and and boy God's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; Satan will be powerless before her. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's going to take a discernment &gt;&gt; and astounding. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Many times we discern but we don't withstand. &gt;&gt; We discern but we don't withstand. &gt;&gt; But it's going to take a discerning and a withstanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the two spirits. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said he he he will be talking about Satan. He said he would be as definitely twe you know as when G as when Christ bestowed his every effort to gain power over him in the desert. Yes, Satan has revelation but we love it &gt;&gt; with true revelation in our lives. The gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them. Man, this is you. &gt;&gt; This is your promise. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? This is your promise. &gt;&gt; Church, I believe that the time has come, amen, for us not only to discern but also to withstand, Amen. this antichrist spirit. What is the antichrist spirit? It is any spirit that is contrary to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me this evening? any spirit that is contrary to the word of God. And again, remember, I am not talking just about the church as a body, but I'm talking about you, about me as an individual. Amen. I want that to be very clear. It's about you personally tonight. God has come to visit you tonight. He's coming to your pew tonight just as much as he came to Abraham's tent. Amen. He's made his way tonight to your tent. Amen. He's got a message for you tonight. Amen. He's coming personally to speak to your heart tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only way we are going to discern and withstand amen this contrary spirit is by having the spirit of God on the inside of us. Amen. Because it is the spirit of God on the inside of us that is going to give us the revelation of the two spirits. Amen. that are operating in the framework of our lives. Amen. Because remember, there is a white dog and there is a black dog. There are two spirits, amen, that are operating in the framework of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. One is trying to get you to an experience and the other one is trying to keep you away from an experience. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And these two spirits, the scripture will tell us that they will be so close. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That they could deceive us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have an assurance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; Because we have been elected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been elected for what purpose? &gt;&gt; Amen. to make Satan powerless &gt;&gt; before us. &gt;&gt; We've been elected to destroy the works of Satan. &gt;&gt; We've been elected to prevail against the works of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; That's what we've been elected for. But these two spirit are going to be very close. Amen. But we have an assurance. &gt;&gt; You see, Satan has designed his scheme. Amen. his scheme that he has designed, amen, is to attempt the destruction of God's people, &gt;&gt; and to discredit the word of God. &gt;&gt; And the way he's planning on carrying out his scheme is to get us to doubt the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To get us to question the word. &gt;&gt; To get us to fear. &gt;&gt; To get us to to to Amen. to a place where we are so focused on our failures &gt;&gt; and our mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice that Satan has got attacked us. And he I say this because he's done a before and he still tries it. But you see, Satan will will try to get you to a place where will try to make you think the certain things in your life is just part of your nature. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; He try to get you to think the certain things are just part of your nature &gt;&gt; that you were born this way. You were made this way. It's it's been down through your your your your genes and your genetics and whatever more brother would say your human gra. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it just make you feel like this is just who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, he he can get you to a place that you may have. Amen. Maybe a loyal spirit or you may have a temper or you may have a tendency to be designed to be high passionate p person. It tends that we we are born with. Are you with me this evening? But now Satan will get you to a place to think that this is part of your nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you begin to get you to begin to feed that in &gt;&gt; and still let you think this is part of your nature &gt;&gt; and make you feel comfortable in it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; And you accept it. Now when you accept it and and you take it and you say, let's take for example a lustful spirit and you take it and you accept it. Amen. And you say this is just part of my nature. Now he's gotten to your place where you're not even thinking about overcoming, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? You're not even considering the fact to overcome it because he's made you think that this is your nature. &gt;&gt; You take temper. He makes you think, well, for you to fly loose is just normal. &gt;&gt; And so you don't even try to overcome it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And so as he gets you to this place, Amen. And and he holds you b in this in this place. Amen. Now, an experience will come, a service will come where where God begin to moves and and he begins to deal with these things and begin to deal with these things that that you know that is part of your your life. But now you resist it because Satan has told you that is part of your nature &gt;&gt; and you don't give yourself a man for God to break that band away. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. And you see the same devil that told you that this is part of your nature. He's the same one that when the presence of the Lord is coming or when when you get to a place where where you you need something from the Lord and you begin to approach the Lord and go to him in prayer or whatever it is, the same one that told you that's your nature is the same one that will come back and condemn you &gt;&gt; and tell you you can't receive it &gt;&gt; because of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm. &gt;&gt; You can't receive it &gt;&gt; because of that temper. &gt;&gt; Because you're not living right, &gt;&gt; but then he'll tell you, "But that's your nature." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But that's your nature. &gt;&gt; You can't overcome that. But I tell you one thing, George, my God is greater than our nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan can lie as much as he wants to lie. &gt;&gt; But let me say this. If he's been doing that to you, tonight is a good night. &gt;&gt; To serve him a notice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, you're not serving him a notice. The night to say, "Listen, you've got one month to live." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, this is immediate effect. &gt;&gt; He whispers tonight. &gt;&gt; This is immediate effect. You leaving tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; You were not born to be living with a temper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? You were not born to be living with a lustful spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were not born to be living with a loyal spirit. &gt;&gt; You were born to be a son of God. You were born to be a daughter of God. You were born to be living what the word says about you. But Satan has been loyal to you. But I say that tonight there is a spirit here that is greater than the spirit of the devil. There is a power here that is greater than the power of Satan. Amen. The presence of God is here boy as Holy Spirit to break the bands of the enemy &gt;&gt; and bring a true experience to the believer. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As we said, the dynamics is here. &gt;&gt; The headstone is here. Christ is here. Oh, listen church. Listen. Brother Brandon will say this. Amen. He'll say this in Christ the mystery of God revealed. He'll say now notice. He say being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question. &gt;&gt; If you are personally identified &gt;&gt; with the headship. Now remember the quote we read. What did he say? He said that this headstone was coming &gt;&gt; and he said when he unit anoints with the with the body amen it'll be the power of the Holy Ghost on the inside offer and it will lift her up. Is that correct? That's the first quote we read. Now he is saying here amen that when you identify with that headstone with that headship with Christ coming when you identify with it he said you've got the answer to the devil's question. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen, glory." We have the answer to the devil's question. He said, "He, Christ is risen and has paid the price." &gt;&gt; And rising up the body. &gt;&gt; Christ has risen. He's paid the price. And now he is lifting this body, you and I, up with him. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said the devil can't stand it. &gt;&gt; He said that's the reason why these economic ecumenical kingdoms are setting up. He said that's the reason they're all coming into into into what they doing now. He said the devil that's the reason his hell the way he is. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; His wickedness, his king has been uncovered. &gt;&gt; Amen. by the risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body. &gt;&gt; The scheme of the devil has been uncovered. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; By Christ anointed with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, church, you were raised and born to be an invincible army &gt;&gt; to do the greater works. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Satan will try to keep us from an experience. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because listen, the court told us, Amen, that Satan knows that if the people, &gt;&gt; get the true revelation of the true church and what she is. Amen. Now, now I want you to notice what she is. Now, what she is, what are you? As I said, you are not a sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody believe that they're a sinner here tonight? If you claim the blood, you are not a sinner. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are not a failure. &gt;&gt; You are not a weakling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet said that you are the pure, &gt;&gt; virtuous, &gt;&gt; sinless, &gt;&gt; bride of the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are born of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are washed by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You believe his word. &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham said, "Now you are standing perfect." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; As you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; You are perfect because he is perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when we are talking about perfection, &gt;&gt; I can't see lust in perfection. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now listen, we humans, there are things that will happen in our lives. There are things we'll see. Now, I'm not saying that, you know, we not we won't make mistakes. Don't get me wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not saying we won't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; But to be dominated &gt;&gt; by that spirit &gt;&gt; is not what we're called to be. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah, &gt;&gt; don't get I'm not saying that we're going to be, you know, we humans. We're living in this flesh that is unredeemed. That's why there is a blood for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. We will make mistakes. Sometime without we see things we don't want to see. Amen. And sometimes we make mistake and fall. Amen. And then but listen, there is a blood that atones for us. But when it becomes the what is driving us, when it becomes something that has gotten a hold of us, when it becomes something that is completely amen has has almost taken over us to a place where Amen. we have a hard time amending a relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Then at that point, Satan has infiltrated in our camp. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me this evening? Then he's infiltrated in our camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we have a right &gt;&gt; to claim what God has given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were born to be overcomers. &gt;&gt; It is overcomers that are going to live this generation. Amen. In this last day is that overcomers are going to sit with him in his throne. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "What is this brandom for?" &gt;&gt; Because once we know what she is, &gt;&gt; that she's the pure virtuous. Amen. sinless bride of the live of the son of the living God. And what is she standing for? We standing for the word. &gt;&gt; She's standing for the truth. Are you with me tonight? &gt;&gt; And you know what? When he talks about being an invincible army, listen, we in ourselves can never be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; But you know what makes us invincible is the word. &gt;&gt; It is the word of God in us. That is what makes us invincible. Because listen, there is nothing on the face of the earth that can defeat the word of God. &gt;&gt; And when the word of God now has the preeminence in you, then it makes you invincible. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? When the word of God has the preeminence in you, then you have the right, Amen, and to speak to whatever spirit and defoy that spirit and push that spirit back to wherever it came from because there is authority and power in the word. Amen. The word is something that when Satan hears, he has to back off. Amen. Listen, when when he came to tempt Jesus, Amen. Listen, Jesus had lots of power that he could have used. Amen. But what did he use? He just used the word. He just spoke the word. Amen. That's all he did. That's all he used to defeat the enemy. The Bible say he did it to prove to the weakest of saints &gt;&gt; that the word is more than enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the word is more than enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is more than enough. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you see here as we read in the scriptures was a man by the name of Samson. &gt;&gt; And you see Samson, he was playing church with the word. Now remember that that where we going I don't want you to lose the train of thoughts &gt;&gt; that there are two spirits in the framework &gt;&gt; of our individual lives &gt;&gt; and we are not only to discern but to withstand. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; And so Samson, Amen. He was playing church with the word. Amen. Samson seemed to not have caught the revelation of the two spirits that were operating in his life. Are you with me? Even though the power of God was upon Samson. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he seemed to not amen come to a place. Amen. And where he was able to discern and withstand that contrary spirit. &gt;&gt; Let me say this church, we better defeat our enemy or destroy our enemy before our enemy destroys us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he couldn't he couldn't discern it. That was what exactly brought him to his fall. But I want you to notice that Samson went to church. &gt;&gt; Now stay with me. Samson went to church. &gt;&gt; Samson paid his offering and to &gt;&gt; Samson was a faithful believer. As a matter of fact, one time Samson was bound. Amen. And he got out and pulled the gates of Gazer on his shoulders and went and stood up on a mountain. &gt;&gt; One time he faced the lion. Amen. And he tore the lion apart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Samson had the power of God on him. &gt;&gt; But Samson had not fully surrendered to God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? Listen, he could go to church. He could quote the quotes. He could quote the scriptures. But there was something in his heart that had not fully surrendered to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There were two spirits that were operating in the life of Samson. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if Samson discerned it, Samson never bought it to withstand it. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't deceive him. But he kept on entertaining it and he kept on accepting it. Just as you know, as we said, Satan will try to get you to a place to think that is just part of your nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know, but maybe that's what he told Samson. It is just a part of your nature. That is just the way you born to be, Samson. You can be this way and yet you can see the power of God upon you. So what is the point of overcoming Samson? &gt;&gt; What is the point? Amen. Of of even trying to be free from this. &gt;&gt; The power of God is still upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He still went to church and did everything. &gt;&gt; But he had not fully surrendered. He had not fully sold out. Listen, there came a time one time that Elijah, amen, came on a mountain called Caramel and he told the people, listen, it's time for you to make a decision. Amen. It's time for you to make a decision. If Bal is God, then serve him. But if God is God, then serve him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? Listen, that is where we are at in this time. It is time to make a stand. It is time to make a decision. If Bal is God, then go ahead and serve him. If God is God, then it's time to dedicate and surrender all we have unto God. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you a little bit about this bad God. Because he's the God of this evil age. Are you with me? Listen. This bad God, he will give you all the riches that you want. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He will give you all the riches that you want. Amen. He He will make you feel like that you are the best. Are you with me? But at the end of it all, he's only got a hell for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. This bad God, listen, he will destroy your life. Are you with me? He'll tell you that forum is going a p. Are you with me this evening? He'll tell you that forum, amen, is going on many girls that you can go out with or many boys that you can go out with. This bad God will put you in a relationship and get you divorced and put you in another relationship and get you divorced again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is all this bad God has got to offer to you. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; He'll get you to compromise on the word. &gt;&gt; He'll get you to sit on the pew and be a lukewarm believer. He'll get you to sit on a pew and just be warm and just be here and show your presence. &gt;&gt; Yeah. just for people to know that you are doing well. But deep within your heart, you know that you are not there. Deep within your heart, you know that you're missing that experience. Deep within your heart, you know that something is missing. &gt;&gt; But this bad God will tell you that it's okay. This bad God will tell you that you're still coming to church. Are you with me this evening? &gt;&gt; That's what this bad God will do. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you about my God. Let me tell you about this God who is not the God of this evil age, but he's the creator of this age. He's the creator of this urge. Listen, he is the God that when Bal has done destroying your life and has broken it into pieces, he's the God that will take those broken pieces. Oh, come on, church. He will take those broken pieces and he'll begin to put them back together. Amen. This is the God that I'm talking about. He is the God that he'll give you a good family. He is the God that will give you a good home. He is the God that will give you an experience, a reality of who God is. He is a God that has a mansion prepared for you. Oh, hallelujah. He's a God that will take you through a trial to give you a greater revelation of who he is. This is my God. This is the God that you are serving. Choose you this day. Who are you going to serve? If God be God, then let's serve him. If God be God, then let's walk away from this message. Oh, but I tell you, this message is more than a prophet. This message is more than quotes. This message is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is the God that I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A full surrender. &gt;&gt; But Samson wanted to have one feet here and one feet there. Those days are over. &gt;&gt; It's time to make a decision. &gt;&gt; We can't be on the borderline anymore. We can't be on the fence anymore. We can't be playing church anymore. Those days are over. It's time to make a clear code decision and begin to walk with the Lord and say, "Lord, whatever it takes, I am going with you. If you taking me through the fire, I am going with you because I know that you are the fourth man that can stand in that fire and begin to blow away the fiery furnace that will try to burn me. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God once bought your strength and your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Samson gave him his strength but not his heart. What Samson needed was a fresh experience. Amen. A fresh experience that would have quickened him to the revelation of his purpose, to the revelation of his call. That would have brought him to a place where he would have caught the revelation of the plan of God for his life. Are you with me this evening? That he was born to defeat the Philistines. He wasn't born to compromise with them, but he was born to defeat them. Oh, come on. Come on, church. He was born to destroy and deliver the children of Israel. He was born to possess the gates of the enemy. But there was a deloer. There was a deloer that was pulling him back. A deloer of unforgiveness that was pulling him back. Oh, he will let him go just a little bit, but then he'll pull him back again. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Deoya, &gt;&gt; oh church, the spirit of deoila will try to stop the church from a true experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Will try to stop the church from a true experience. But listen, church, this bride was born to be an invincible army. This bride was born to make Satan powerless before her. That is what you were born to do. Not to compromise but to defeat your enemy. Are you with me tonight church? Amen. No matter which form it comes in, whether it comes in the form of sickness, whether it comes in the form of depression, whether it comes in the form of anxiety, you have been given the authority, amen, to make Satan powerless before you. &gt;&gt; But it's going to take a total surrender. &gt;&gt; It's going to take a total surrender. It's going to take a discern and a withstanding of that antichrist spirit. Oh, hallelujah. That is what it's going to take, church. Amen. Listen, brother Brandham. Here again, we'll say we've got to make a complete surrender and come to God. Is that you've got to surrender to him both soul, body, and spirit. is that everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and in me. &gt;&gt; Everything has to be surrendered to him. &gt;&gt; And the only way that God is going to work his will in our life is for us to catch the revelation of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said the will of God is his word. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the secret weapon or the secret strength of the believer is the revelation of the word of God &gt;&gt; in our in our own life. &gt;&gt; Listen, because the revelation of the word will show you God's will for your life. &gt;&gt; Listen, when you know that is God's will for you to do something, nothing can stand against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, there is nobody that can talk you out of its &gt;&gt; when you've got the revelation that this is the will of God for my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop you. &gt;&gt; That is the strength of the believer. &gt;&gt; Is catching the revelation of the word of God &gt;&gt; that will show us his will for our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you when you got the revelation that that sister sitting next to you was your wife. Oh boy. There was no other boy on earth. Oh well, glory brother Tabiso. Oh &gt;&gt; because you have a revelation of us &gt;&gt; and no one can beat you out of that revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I'm just going to read some few quotes here about what Brandon said about revelation and it's all in the church age. It said, "But when the church disbelieves Satan and believe the spiritual revelation of the word, the gates of hell cannot prevail against her." &gt;&gt; Again, he says, "It is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil." &gt;&gt; Again, he said there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the secret strength of the believer is the revelation of the word of God in our life. Amen. That is the strength of the believer. And now what is the revelation of the word of God? The revelation of the word of God is the revelation of who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; The revelation of the word is the revelation of who you are. &gt;&gt; Because you are a part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you go back to the word and begin to feed on the word and cast a revelation of God's will for your life, you cast a revelation of who you are. &gt;&gt; That is what makes you invincible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's why church, this is the season that we ought to feed on this message like we've never fed Hana before. &gt;&gt; We ought to be in the word like we've never been in the word before. &gt;&gt; There is where the book &gt;&gt; there is where we will know who we are &gt;&gt; and be an invincible army &gt;&gt; and do the greater works. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see, Satan fought us. Satan will foil us &gt;&gt; to keep us away from that strength. &gt;&gt; He was deceiving him. He will fight us to keep us away from that strength. Just as he was fighting Samson to keep him away from his strength, you know, since since the church ages began, you know, brother Brandham says that, you know, Satan has been fighting. Satan was fighting the church to find the strength of the church. And you know, brother Bram said that Satan actually did find it. And he said he find it at no. I'm talking about the church ages. He said he find it at no. And he said he bobbed off the strength of the church. But you see, God had a masterpiece bright on his mind. And so he went back and begin to build a rope again. But when we say began and went through Luther and begin to break the bands of the Catholic dogma and and then went to went to Wesley when the Philadelphia age of sanctification and Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Well, brother Bham said that Satan came all the way back again and bobbed off and took away their strength again. &gt;&gt; Why? Because for the word he gave them dogmas and he gave them creeds. for the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He gave them the speaking in tongues and he began again to take away the strength from the church. &gt;&gt; But God's purpose cannot fail. &gt;&gt; God's purpose cannot fail. &gt;&gt; He was determined to have a bride that will not be deceived. He was determined to have a people that will not that will not compromise and will not give up. Amen. That was what he was determined to have. And let me say this, that bride is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That brid is here. He was determined to have a bride. Amen. That that Satan will be powerless before her. And she is here. And you see, Satan is fighting her. Amen. Listen, I'm not going to go through all these notes. Satan is fighting her. Are you with me this evening? Satan is fighting this bride. Amen. For what? To try to take away his strength. Just as it did to Samson. Just as it did at Noa. Just as it did to Pentecost. But she can't do it to this bride. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this evening? She can do it to this bride because she has been born of a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen. He got Samson, but he's not going to get you. Amen. Because you have been predestinated to be victorious. You have been predestinated to be an overcomer. Amen. Listen, this is not a time for us. Amen. To be condemning ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you see, when Samson was in the place that he was, you see, he got to a place where he felt, I failed. &gt;&gt; I failed. and he realized it was my mistakes and I should have fully surrendered. I should have done this and I didn't. But let me say this truth. This is not a time &gt;&gt; to be counting your mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not a time to be condemning yourself. &gt;&gt; This is not a time to to be feeling guilty and because this is the season of restoration. &gt;&gt; This is the season of restoration. No matter what you've done, God is more than able to restore. &gt;&gt; He said that this is the season of Jubilee. &gt;&gt; This is the season that the trumpet assigned that that you can go free. Amen. No matter what Satan has done, God can reverse it. He has the power to reverse it. But now the question is, are you willing? Amen. The question is, have you been able to discern to know to say this is the spirit? This is the 10 that I'm fighting with. And are you willing to withstand it? Are you with me tonight? Are you willing to withstand it? And say, "Lord, I am willing. Lord, I want to give it all. Lord, I want to go all the way." Amen. Because he is here and he is willing to restore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there is still a possibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is still not over. If God has allowed you to be in the service tonight, it means that it is still not over. That there is still a possibility that no matter what the enemy has done to you, done to your family, done to your children, there is still a possibility. Amen. You are still in a position to claim what God has rightfully given to you. You are still in a position to stand to say, "I am an invincible army." Why? because I have accepted the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Listen, while Samson Amen. and was over there and and he was just grinding away and just grinding away. His eyes has been taken away and he's just grinding away. You know, sometimes that's how Satan gets us to a place where we just grinding. Are you with me? We're just grinding as believers. We're grinding in a cycle. One day we overcome, the next day we b again. Sunday we are Christians, Monday we backsliding. Are you with me tonight? And we just grinding. Grinding as believers. And we just saying, "Brother, how are you doing? I am making it, brother. I am just grinding away. I know you're making it, brother. Oh, but listen. God has got more and more for you than just a grinding. You were born to grind. You were born to overcome. Oh hallelujah. But you know what was happening while Samson was grinding and he was grinding away. There was something that was happening that the enemy was not paying attention to while he was grinding and his locks that the loyal has saved away. What has the loyal done to you? Amen. And the locks that he had shaved away while he was growing and they begin to grow again. They begin to grow again. Listen, every time that you hear the word of God, what is it? It is a lock that is trying to grow in you and you again. But you have to open yourself. You have to come to a place of a total surrender and say, "God, I messed up. God, I made a mistake. God, I allow these sins in my life for too long, but now I am well. Now I am ready for a full surrender. &gt;&gt; And you watch those lock begin to grow again. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The locks begin to grow and the enemy couldn't see him. Oh, but he was growing and it was growing. Listen, every prayer is a lock that is growing. Every service is a lock that is growing. Every tape that you press play is a lock that is growing. Every scripture that you read is a lock that is growing. Don't stop. Keep growing that lock. Oh, hallelujah. Because it may feel that you've been growing them, but God has got a greater purpose for you. Because the very enemy that seemed to have had you defeated him, God is here to save him. You were born to defeat that enemy or allowed it in your life to prove to you that you are invincible. Oh, hallelujah. Listen, you may say, why have we been struggling with this for years? God allowed to prove to you that you are invincible to prove to you that he's a deliverer. But sometimes it just feels like it is a groin and a groin and a groin. Oh, but he's here to make a way. He's here to make a way. Brother Barham said while they had Samson B. He said there was a new shock grow. He said, I am praying God that he will grow out of here somewhere. A new shock that will shake the Philistines like they've never been shook before. that is more in prayer tonight that a new shock will grow upon us to save him that will shake the enemy like he's never been shook before. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother said I believe that God will have it. Amen. I believe that God will have it. Oh church, let me say tonight it is your season. Amen. There is still a possibility tonight. If you have discerned and you're willing to withstand that spirit that is operating in the framework of your life, God is here saying, "I am ready. I am ready." Amen. I am ready to pull you out over them. I am ready to change your life. I am ready to give you a fresh and new experience to renew your walk with me. You don't have to be a bench warmer. You don't have to be just a church goer. You can be a full believing Christian living this message. This message wasn't given to us to be on the tape. The word wasn't given to us to be just on the pages of a Bible. It was given to us to have feet that can walk. It was given to us to have lips that can speak. As a matter of fact, in this last age, you have been called to prophesy again. What have you been told to prophesy? The word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; To speak the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To speak the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was Brrenam doing? He was meditating on Mark 11. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah, church. He was meditating on Mark 11. He was putting the word on his mind. Listen, even though he couldn't understand it, he couldn't know how it could happen, but he said, "I'm just going to meditate upon him." What was he doing? It was a shock that was growing out. A man of the throat pull. Are you with me this evening? while he was meditating on that word as shock was growing out for the manifestation of that turle. How is the turle going to manifest in your life? By feeding on the word, feeding on the word. I don't fully understand the Lord, but I'm going to keep fading. I can't fully see the Lord, but I'm going to keep fading. I'm going to keep fading because I know eternal life is here. I know the power of God is here. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that in all the land of that day, there was only one head &gt;&gt; that those shock &gt;&gt; could grow upon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Among all the people, &gt;&gt; only one &gt;&gt; had the promise. That's right. &gt;&gt; Only one &gt;&gt; could defeat the enemy. &gt;&gt; Only one was chosen and called. &gt;&gt; There was no other head. There were many of them, but no other could those sharks grow on. &gt;&gt; Let me say this in love this year. There's only one group of people. &gt;&gt; Just one group of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. just one group of people that have been called to do the greater works. There's only one group of people that has been chosen. There's only one group of people that has been predestinated for a rapture. Are you with me tonight? No, I don't know other person but you alone. &gt;&gt; You alone. &gt;&gt; Listen church, we are at another showdown and I'm closing. We are at another showdown. The lords of the Philistines are gathered. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No days as the word has been going forth, &gt;&gt; they've been speaking to you. They were speaking to you. It's just another service. We've heard these things before. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the Lord of the Philistines. Because you see Satan had come to a place where he begin to look at Samson and he begin to belittle him &gt;&gt; because he's like what has he got left? &gt;&gt; His eyes are taken away. &gt;&gt; They shave the the power off. What has he got left? &gt;&gt; And sometimes he looks at you as the bride. What has she got left? &gt;&gt; Right? What has she got left? She's living in the darkest of age. I'm able to get them lukewarm. What has she got left? And the Lords were all gathered and they were having the party. We got Samson. We got Samson. And he's been he's been he's been talking to you. But I got you. before I got you. &gt;&gt; You've been services before, but the preacher spoke about overcoming and you went back home. Did you not fall again? &gt;&gt; I got you. You've tried to fix your home. When you went back, what's happened? I got you. The Lord of the Philistines have got it. But I'm looking for Samson tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for Samson tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for someone that has come to a place that has recognized the Lord, the sense of a light in my life that I wasn't supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I am willing to die with my enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm willing to die with my enemy. I'm looking for Samsons tonight. &gt;&gt; Sometimes they're going to say, "You know what? Lord, &gt;&gt; just take me to the pillars." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan tend to think there's nothing left in you because he's got you in a cycle. &gt;&gt; He's got you grinding and he thinks there's nothing left. &gt;&gt; But let's go to the pillars. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; let's go to the pillars. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Let's go to the pillars &gt;&gt; because there is a once more. &gt;&gt; There is still a possibility. &gt;&gt; There is still a possibility tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; The promise has not failed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he called you invincible, he did not make a mistake. &gt;&gt; When he said that you can do the great works, he did not make a mistake. &gt;&gt; When he called you to prophesy again, he did not make a mistake. When he chose you, when you were fallen, he did not make a mistake. When he felt like a man, the world had taken you over, but he pulled you out of the womb. He did not make a mistake. When you were sliding into into the pit of a moy clay and he reached out his hand and he pulled you out of that pit and set you upon a rock. He did not make a mistake. &gt;&gt; He did not make a mistake when he p you names on the lamb's book of life. He did not make a mistake. &gt;&gt; He did not make a mistake when he brought this message across your bride. He did not make a mistake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now you feel surrounded. And no day. Amen. Like that day when the servant came to Elijah and said, "Elijah, we are surrounded Elijah. &gt;&gt; We are surrounded by the enemy." But Elijah said, "Open his eyes." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Open his eyes. And if I can recall it in this age that we have been told, "Come to me and come and get some ice laughs." Come and get some ice laughs that will open your eyes. That you begin to see that there is more with you than there is against you. You might feel like you are alone, but there is more with you than there is against you. Some God was alone. Sam God was alone. But listen, he came to the revelation of who he is. But it wasn't a mistake that he was born an Israelite. All he needed was just an ox code in his hands. That's all he needed. That's all he needed. &gt;&gt; And you know what he be to do? Listen. And with that us gold, he couldn't have just stand there and slay all the Philistines. But one by one, little by little, one by one, the demon of loss came and it kicked him off. The demon of depression came and it kicked him off. There was more with him, but there was against him. When it came to the revelation of who he is, I'm looking for Samsons tonight. I'm looking for David tonight that can say I don't care what the Goliath is before me. I'm looking for David that will take the stone. Is it the scripture that says he that set us free has made us free indeed. That is enough of a stone to tear down the enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's time to go to the pillars. &gt;&gt; It's time to go to the pillars. &gt;&gt; It is your season. &gt;&gt; It is your hour. &gt;&gt; It's time to say, "Satan, give it back." &gt;&gt; You've robbed me for too long. &gt;&gt; But my family is mine. My joy is mine. My peace is mine. My freedom is mine. My children are mine. You have no right over them. God gave them to me. &gt;&gt; It's time to go to the pill church &gt;&gt; because there's still a possibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the musicians come tonight restoring &gt;&gt; a shaven experience. &gt;&gt; Restoring a saving experience. &gt;&gt; What has he taken away? What has he robbed you of? It can be restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can be restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's taken away your experience. And the reality of God in your life &gt;&gt; can be restored. You say, "I want to know God more, and I'm happy where he's brought me, but I want a deeper walk." &gt;&gt; He's here to give it to you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I've been banging, and I've been in a cycle, and I've been crying, and I've put on the smile, and because I can say the words, I can dress the dress, and I can do all that I need to do to show everybody that I am a Christian. But deep within my heart, there is a hole. There is an emptiness. And I've kept running, Lord. I've kept running, Lord. &gt;&gt; But I know that you've been running after me. &gt;&gt; You've been running after me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've been running after me, calling me back home. &gt;&gt; But it's time to turn and say, "Lord, here I am. Lord, here I am." It might have been a prodal that have walked away for so long. The father has got his arms open. The father has got his arms open &gt;&gt; to receive you. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. There is still the possibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "I need the Holy Ghost. It's yours. &gt;&gt; It's yours." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need a refill of it. It is yours. He's here to restore. He's here to give you back everything that the enemy has taken away. Whatever he's shaven, the word has come to restore every shock that has been shaven off and put you back in your rightful position. Hallelujah. stand on our feet tonight. Hallelujah. Oh yes, Lord. More. Can you sing that for us? Oh, you know, Chris. Is that your desire tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz you me. You need to be broken tonight. Maybe it's time to be broken. &gt;&gt; You've tried to do it yourself, but it's time to say, "Lord, break me &gt;&gt; of my love. Oh, let me be you, Lord. you. Oh, sing it once more time to Oh, consume. &gt;&gt; Go to the pillars tonight. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, once more. &gt;&gt; Once more, Lord. &gt;&gt; Once more, Lord. Make me whole like you. Oh, break. Break me Lord. Unlast the broken pieces of my life. Let me be you, oh Lord. By you, Lord, by you. &gt;&gt; There is a possibility tonight in church. &gt;&gt; Maybe you find yourself like Jacob and come to a place where you feel like you've been wrestling and wrestling. Maybe you need a name change. &gt;&gt; Maybe you need a name change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe you need a name change. &gt;&gt; You need to walk different from the way you've been walking up until now. &gt;&gt; Jacob didn't only get a name change, but he walked different. &gt;&gt; Everybody knew Jacob is different. &gt;&gt; He's not walking the same way he walks. One time there were people that came out of a room and the testimony that was said of them was that these people &gt;&gt; have been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can that be our testimony tonight? &gt;&gt; Now we can walk out of this building and &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; and the people can look at us and say these people &gt;&gt; have been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. The same people that you see every day, the same people that you walk with and the same people that are your colleagues at work your friends at school that they can look at you. &gt;&gt; The same believers that you go to church with &gt;&gt; they can look at you and they can say &gt;&gt; he's been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; My name has changed. &gt;&gt; We ask for the barriers to come. Let's sing that again. Consume me Lord. Consume to me the fire of your spat. Lord and bless the broken pieces of my life. Lord, by you consume me, Lord. Your spirit be more like you. me and bless the broken pieces of my life. Let me be used might be in the fire of the spirit. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. and bless. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.

You know, I just can't help but think about how we can get on that treadmill. We can get on that grinding circle with our eyes put out, our spiritual eyes put out, and go round and round and round and listen to that devil tell us that's the way it's always been. &gt;&gt; It's your nature. You're never going to escape it. It's always a lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight we heard from the Lord &gt;&gt; and he told us there is deliverance if we want it. Yes. &gt;&gt; But it's like anything in life, you got to want it. &gt;&gt; And until we get to the place where we're grinding long and hard, he'll let us go. And he'll let us go. Tonight, I just want to declare liberty &gt;&gt; because the spirit of the Lord is here tonight. &gt;&gt; We're not in bondage. We're not under bondage. Tonight when we go home, brothers and sisters, when we lay our heads down &gt;&gt; on our pillows, remember these words. You're free. &gt;&gt; You're free. &gt;&gt; What happened at Calvary was just a manifestation of what he did before the foundation of the world when he wrote our names in that book. My goodness, I'm so thankful for the word that came forward tonight because I heard it a couple of times that it was for me, but I want to say that it was for me, too. &gt;&gt; He was talking to me, too. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that he is he's ever present. My goodness. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful, Lord Jesus, that one more time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, you came by our way. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We called upon your name, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And you faithfully came one more time. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight I just want to pray for each and everyone who came up, Lord, and each and everyone who didn't come up, Lord. Father, that you would allow us one more time, Lord Jesus, to recognize that in this life, we can find ourselves living in cycles. Lord, I just want to pray for each and every one of us, Lord, that we would just, oh, Father, allow ourselves to go to the temple, Lord Jesus, to go to the post, Father, and Lord God, just allow ourselves to die out with our enemy tonight. Father, don't let us, Father, go from this building tonight with a desire to keep that old man alive. Father, that old man will take us to the grave. Father, let us die to ourselves so that you can live. Father, &gt;&gt; I pray that you would just bless each one, Father, for their willingness to come and meet with you tonight, Lord. Father, we are blessed. We're so thankful for your ministration to us by your word, Father. As we heard tonight, you could have done many different things, but you showed us. You showed us in your word the way to defeat Satan is by your word. Father, help us to not be Lord Jesus in the message. Help us, Lord Jesus, to recognize that in this day and age that we live in, we are the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us take the book and eat it up, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, we pray that you would just be glorified. And Lord, maybe another song or two. And Father, as we go our separate ways tonight, I pray that you would keep your hand upon us, Lord.
