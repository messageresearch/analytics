[1:15:57] and tolda how the Lord just came down
[1:15:59] and used those meetings in a special way
[1:16:01] and amen it is a I don't know about you
[1:16:03] but I I am excited Amen to serve the
[1:16:06] Lord amen I don't know the world gets
[1:16:08] excited about sports and they get
[1:16:10] excited about all the activities of Le
[1:16:12] osia amen but to the believer we get
[1:16:14] excited about the Lord amen I don't know
[1:16:17] I don't ever want to lose that fervor
[1:16:19] amen or that enthusiasm Amen to serve
[1:16:22] the Lord amen The Book of Luke the 16th
[1:16:24] chap chapter we want to look here in the
[1:16:27] 16th verse amen the Bible here says that
[1:16:30] the law and the prophets were until John
[1:16:34] but since that time the kingdom of God
[1:16:37] is preached somebody say preached
[1:16:40] preached it's not played but preached
[1:16:44] the kingdom of God is preached now watch
[1:16:47] this and every man presseth somebody say
[1:16:51] presseth presseth into it so there is a
[1:16:55] preaching amen and then there is a
[1:16:57] pressing the kingdom of God is preached
[1:17:00] and every man presseth into it now I
[1:17:03] want to go to the book of Philippians
[1:17:05] the third chapter Philippians chapter
[1:17:08] 3 Philippians chapter 3 and I want to
[1:17:11] read there in the 13th verse I know this
[1:17:13] is another uh very familiar reading
[1:17:16] Philippians chapter 3 and verse number
[1:17:20] 13 Paul here writing in Philippians 3
[1:17:24] and verse 13
[1:17:25] he says now Brethren I count not myself
[1:17:27] to have
[1:17:28] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:17:32] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:17:35] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:17:38] which are before so there are some
[1:17:40] things behind us but Paul says to forget
[1:17:44] those things that are behind us and let
[1:17:46] us reach forth unto those things which
[1:17:48] are before now watch this he says so I
[1:17:51] press toward the mark for the prize of
[1:17:55] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:17:58] so the kingdom of God is preached and
[1:18:01] every man presseth into it but here Paul
[1:18:04] says amen that we got to forget some
[1:18:07] things that are behind us and we've got
[1:18:09] to press toward the things that are in
[1:18:11] front of us now in 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:18:14] 4 I want to read one verse there in 2
[1:18:16] Corinthians 4 and verse 13 and I want to
[1:18:19] ask you this question amen how do we
[1:18:23] press amen and how do we press in 2
[1:18:27] Corinthians 4 and: 13 I believe we will
[1:18:30] find the answer he says now we having
[1:18:33] the same Spirit of Faith according as it
[1:18:36] is written I believed and therefore have
[1:18:40] I spoken now watch this we also believe
[1:18:44] and therefore we speak so we actually
[1:18:47] press forward by believing the things
[1:18:50] that have been spoken amen or preached
[1:18:52] unto us amen how many he says this
[1:18:55] morning Lord I want to go forward amen I
[1:18:57] want to move forward we ask Lord this
[1:18:59] morning to add the blessing Amen to the
[1:19:01] reading of his word as you can have your
[1:19:03] seats here today amen I want you by the
[1:19:05] help of the Lord for amen just a few
[1:19:07] moments this morning I actually uh was
[1:19:09] planning to go a whole different
[1:19:11] direction amen continuing in our thought
[1:19:13] from last night but the Lord just
[1:19:14] changed things on me so amen if it's
[1:19:16] okay we'll just follow him amen but I
[1:19:18] want to speak to you this morning Amen
[1:19:21] on the brides breakthrough amen the
[1:19:24] brides break through you know I believe
[1:19:27] amen that the time has come amen for the
[1:19:30] Believers to press amen I believe the
[1:19:32] time has come amen for the Believers to
[1:19:35] press amen and that is to press forward
[1:19:38] amen amen not to go backwards amen not
[1:19:41] to go to the left or to the right but to
[1:19:43] press forward now the prophet of God
[1:19:45] would say we all have to work together
[1:19:47] as one Unity see amen we have to get our
[1:19:50] differences away we have to lay aside
[1:19:52] our doctrines and things amen and put
[1:19:55] our arms together amen and press forward
[1:19:58] and take the promise amen that God
[1:20:00] Almighty has given us amen how many
[1:20:03] would agree that we have been given
[1:20:05] promises amen but they're not natural
[1:20:07] promises amen but they are Divine
[1:20:10] promises amen then if they are Divine
[1:20:12] promises then we are under amen a Divine
[1:20:16] commission to possess amen those Divine
[1:20:19] promises brother B said a man amen
[1:20:21] that's commissioned of God Amen he looks
[1:20:24] up Ward and he looks onward amen he
[1:20:26] doesn't look backwards and he doesn't
[1:20:28] look downward amen but he looks upward
[1:20:31] and he looks onward see you don't have
[1:20:33] to care what the world says about it
[1:20:35] anyhow amen he's not listening to the
[1:20:38] world Amen he's got a Divine commission
[1:20:42] from God Amen and he is enjoying that
[1:20:45] presence you know I believe this morning
[1:20:47] that we are enjoying amen the presence
[1:20:50] or the company amen of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:53] now I believe the Holy Ghost how many
[1:20:56] amen how many believes in the Holy Ghost
[1:20:58] amen you believe in the Holy Ghost amen
[1:21:01] so you believe that the Holy Ghost comes
[1:21:03] among the church amen then when the Holy
[1:21:05] Ghost comes among the church amen he's
[1:21:07] coming to do more than just excite us
[1:21:09] amen he's coming to do more than just
[1:21:11] make us feel good or amen give us a
[1:21:13] little sensation or a little emotion
[1:21:15] amen but the Holy Ghost is coming among
[1:21:18] the church to make the church amen
[1:21:20] persever it now you know what
[1:21:21] perseverance means amen it means to be
[1:21:24] persistent Amen to make a goal brother
[1:21:27] said a man that's ever amounted to
[1:21:29] anything at any time through any age has
[1:21:33] been men who believed in God they had
[1:21:35] faith in God and they stood against the
[1:21:38] enemy Amen on every side now you all
[1:21:40] will agree amen that the enemy is coming
[1:21:43] in like a flood right amen but the Bible
[1:21:45] says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:21:47] flood amen that the spirit of the Lord
[1:21:51] amen will raise a standard against the
[1:21:53] enemy he said and was perseverant
[1:21:55] because they believed in God he said
[1:21:58] then I believe amen that every Christian
[1:22:01] therefore amen should be very
[1:22:04] perseverant amen another place as long
[1:22:06] as a Christian can know that he's living
[1:22:09] above sin and the Holy Spirit is
[1:22:11] blessing him and standing with him then
[1:22:14] be perseverant amen and press towards
[1:22:17] the mark of the High Calling amen
[1:22:19] Christians should be that way they
[1:22:22] should be very perseverant in their
[1:22:24] claims to God Amen stay with it listen I
[1:22:28] think it's time Amen to get some
[1:22:31] perseverance back in the church I think
[1:22:33] it's time to get some perseverance back
[1:22:35] in our prayers I think it's time to get
[1:22:37] some perseverance back in our preaching
[1:22:39] you all remember amen that we used to
[1:22:41] not just lay down so easily to the devil
[1:22:44] amen when the devil threw something
[1:22:46] against us we didn't just back up and
[1:22:47] say well amen I guess this is the way
[1:22:50] it'll be I guess the devil will have his
[1:22:52] way amen but we used to have prayer
[1:22:54] Warriors amen they would get together
[1:22:56] and pray till things change amen they
[1:22:58] would pray till Spirits broke amen they
[1:23:01] would believe God till Faith come in the
[1:23:03] room and you know what I say I say our
[1:23:05] young people should not be handed amen a
[1:23:08] secondhand religion they should not be
[1:23:10] handed another idea amen or another cold
[1:23:13] Creed amen I say oh God bring some fire
[1:23:16] back in the church amen bring some
[1:23:18] perseverance back Among Us amen bring
[1:23:20] the oldfashioned Holy Ghost amen that'll
[1:23:23] Shake us from the floor Amen to the
[1:23:25] ceiling amen that'll bring reality in
[1:23:27] the church now amen I know amen some
[1:23:30] people get a little bit cold and
[1:23:31] intellectual amen and they get all wed
[1:23:33] up when you start preaching Amen on the
[1:23:35] moving of the Holy Ghost amen but you're
[1:23:38] looking at one preacher amen that will
[1:23:40] not lay down the teaching of the baptism
[1:23:43] of the Holy Ghost amen for some
[1:23:45] intellectual devil that wants to rob the
[1:23:47] church amen of the reality of Jesus
[1:23:50] Christ listen there is a true God and
[1:23:53] there is a false god amen and the false
[1:23:55] god is a God Amen of this evil age and
[1:23:58] he will lead you into the depths of
[1:24:00] Satan amen but there is a true God and
[1:24:03] he is Jehovah and he is a living God he
[1:24:06] is a breathing God he is a moving God he
[1:24:09] is a God that will take the church amen
[1:24:12] forward in every Divine promise I say we
[1:24:14] are not just pressing amen or putting
[1:24:17] our efforts together in vain amen but we
[1:24:19] are pressing amen towards the mark amen
[1:24:22] of the High Calling amen if you can turn
[1:24:24] these up and give me more on the floors
[1:24:26] I'd appreciate it as Paul said amen I
[1:24:28] could stand quoting again amen
[1:24:30] forgetting those things that are in the
[1:24:33] past amen now I press towards the mark
[1:24:37] amen of the High Calling watch to the
[1:24:39] complete identification amen so we're
[1:24:42] not just pressing amen towards a partial
[1:24:46] identification amen but we are pressing
[1:24:48] towards a complete identification when
[1:24:51] all time will fade out into eternity
[1:24:54] amen when Jesus comes another place he
[1:24:57] says we're not going to have amen a
[1:25:00] rearview mirror Affair he said a
[1:25:02] rearview mirror only looks back and sees
[1:25:05] where you have been he said but we're
[1:25:07] looking forward Amen to see where we are
[1:25:10] going listen We're Not Looking Back to
[1:25:12] see that we have been in justification
[1:25:15] or that we have been in sanctification
[1:25:17] or that we have been in the baptism amen
[1:25:19] of the Holy Ghost but we're looking
[1:25:21] forward Amen to the Rapture of the
[1:25:23] church we're looking forward to the body
[1:25:25] change we're looking forward to the
[1:25:27] resurrection amen don't look through a
[1:25:29] rearview mirror amen 40 years ago amen
[1:25:32] look what is tonight amen look what the
[1:25:36] scripture amen is promising today he did
[1:25:39] promise them in that day but we're

[1:26:01] all have settled down amen that this is
[1:26:04] as far as you can go amen and you can't
[1:26:06] go no higher and you can't go no deeper
[1:26:09] amen but I come by here this morning
[1:26:11] Amen to say that devil is a liar he was
[1:26:14] a liar from the beginning and his truth
[1:26:16] is not abiding in him if there is a seed
[1:26:19] in your soul that you are a part amen of
[1:26:22] the Seed of Abraham and when God called
[1:26:25] Abraham out he said as the sand of the
[1:26:27] sea and as the stars of the sky amen so

[1:27:54] pray anyhow I may not feel like it but
[1:27:57] I'm going to worship anyhow I may not
[1:27:59] sense it but I'm going to believe God
[1:28:01] anyhow and you begin to press and you
[1:28:04] begin to press because the kingdom of
[1:28:06] God is preached amen listen I am here
[1:28:09] this morning under a Divine Commission
[1:28:12] of Mark 16 Amen to preach the kingdom of
[1:28:15] God you are here this morning as the
[1:28:18] seat of God Amen to believe what's being
[1:28:20] preached and to press into it listen
[1:28:24] that word pressive it means to use and
[1:28:27] apply
[1:28:29] Force so when you press against
[1:28:31] something you don't just say
[1:28:34] move when it don't move you apply Force
[1:28:37] now listen what the Bible said every man
[1:28:40] amen presses into it brother says not
[1:28:43] just simply walks into it easily oh my
[1:28:46] but it's got to be pressed into it now
[1:28:49] see you know what desperation does Amen
[1:28:52] is desperation causes you
[1:28:54] Amen to press somebody say desperation
[1:28:57] it causes you to press now I love what
[1:29:00] the prophet says he says the law and the
[1:29:02] prophets were until John amen but since
[1:29:05] then amen the Kingdom of Heaven has been
[1:29:08] preached and Men press into it you don't
[1:29:12] just stand around and say pick me up by
[1:29:14] the collar Lord and push me in no you
[1:29:17] press into it see you get desperate it's
[1:29:21] between life and death listen listen
[1:29:24] amen when you get tired of just going to
[1:29:25] church amen and going through the
[1:29:27] motions amen and being a good church
[1:29:29] member amen and just paying your ties
[1:29:32] amen amen I I'm I'm preaching to you
[1:29:35] when you get tired of that amen then
[1:29:37] there comes a strength Amen to begin to
[1:29:39] press into Revelation I believe this
[1:29:42] morning that we are following amen a
[1:29:45] Vindicated Prophet how many will agree
[1:29:47] that brother R was a Vindicated Prophet
[1:29:49] now you believe that he could see amen
[1:29:51] into other dimensions you hear him on
[1:29:53] table he'll say like this I see a black
[1:29:56] streak and it's here and it's going over
[1:29:58] there he said then it's going back there
[1:30:00] amen he said now right there's a streak
[1:30:02] of cancer he said it's like streaks
[1:30:04] going back and forth he said now watch
[1:30:06] he said those demons are crying out for
[1:30:08] hell so he identify those black streaks
[1:30:11] amen as demons which are negative now
[1:30:14] let me say this I don't believe amen
[1:30:16] that he could just look and see it in
[1:30:18] the negative amen but I believe he could
[1:30:20] see the positive too I believe he could
[1:30:22] look into a congregation
[1:30:24] and he could see a cancer or he could
[1:30:26] see a heart trouble or he could see a
[1:30:28] marriage issue or amen or immorality
[1:30:31] amen he could look and see those things
[1:30:33] but listen brother mvin I believe that
[1:30:35] he could see the positive as well
[1:30:37] because he had the Divine ability Amen
[1:30:40] to see things that would get the people
[1:30:42] to believe amen that there was a
[1:30:45] possibility for the situation to change
[1:30:47] and they were facing 1950 in a sermon
[1:30:50] called so is the father and it suffices
[1:30:53] us he said don't doubt amen just have
[1:30:56] faith to believe he said and I believe
[1:30:59] God Amen is going to give us a
[1:31:01] breakthrough tonight he said I believe
[1:31:05] amen it's on the audience oh God Amen he
[1:31:08] can see a cancer he can see a heart
[1:31:10] trouble he can see a nervousness he can
[1:31:13] see a sin listen if he can see the
[1:31:15] negative hey I believe he can see the
[1:31:18] positive if he could see the spirit that
[1:31:21] was oppressing the life if he could see
[1:31:23] the spirit amen that was binding the
[1:31:25] church I believe he could see the
[1:31:27] Breakthrough that was upon the people
[1:31:30] Amen to break out of the condition
[1:31:32] listen I may be as crazy as you ever
[1:31:34] thought I am this morning but I think
[1:31:36] it's time to have a breakthrough I think
[1:31:38] it's time Amen to break out a form I
[1:31:41] think it's time to break out a tradition
[1:31:43] I think it's time to break out a
[1:31:44] ritualistic worship I think it's time to
[1:31:47] break out into a dimension with God
[1:31:50] where we can believe God in the face of
[1:31:52] every obstacle we can walk like Enoch we
[1:31:55] can pray like David we can dance like
[1:31:57] David we can shout we can preach this
[1:32:00] message I think it's time for a good
[1:32:03] oldfashioned
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:06] breakthrough I think it's time to bring
[1:32:08] the fire of God Amen back on the altars
[1:32:11] I think it's time to tear down
[1:32:13] intellectualism and lift up spiritual
[1:32:15] Revelation I believe there's a
[1:32:19] breakthrough listen that was more than
[1:32:21] just a prophet thank you that was a
[1:32:25] prophecy he's looking at you and he's
[1:32:28] saying I see a breakthrough now the
[1:32:32] prophet was not speaking by the word of
[1:32:35] a man brother bar he was speaking by the
[1:32:39] word of faith in Romans chapter 10:8 but
[1:32:43] what saith it amen the word is nigh thee
[1:32:46] it is even in thy mouth and in the heart
[1:32:50] that is the word of faith amen oh my the
[1:32:55] word of faith which we
[1:32:59] preach so the kingdom of God
[1:33:02] is
[1:33:04] preached the word of faith and every man
[1:33:08] presseth into it look at this word
[1:33:10] preach it means to publish it means to
[1:33:12] Proclaim openly it means to be a Herald
[1:33:15] with the authority which must be
[1:33:17] listened to and Obey listen it's
[1:33:19] something which has been done so when
[1:33:22] you begin to preach the word of Faith
[1:33:24] you are preaching that what I'm saying
[1:33:27] has already been done somebody say well
[1:33:29] why are you preaching about a
[1:33:30] breakthrough because there's already
[1:33:32] been one and if there's already been one
[1:33:34] that means there can be another one
[1:33:36] listen friends some of you all have had
[1:33:38] breakthroughs many times amen listen
[1:33:40] that ought to give you the courage right
[1:33:42] here this morning to say if I had a
[1:33:44] breakthrough a year ago or two years ago
[1:33:47] or 6 months ago that right here this
[1:33:49] morning the same God that gave me that
[1:33:51] breakthrough is Hebrews 138 he's
[1:33:54] Ecclesiastes 3 he's Malachi 3:6 he's the
[1:33:58] unchanging God and what he did before
[1:34:00] he's able to do again brother said I
[1:34:03] must preach the kingdom of God he said I
[1:34:05] must preach the truth amen regardless of
[1:34:07] how it hurts amen or what it hurts amen
[1:34:10] now sometimes when you preach amen you
[1:34:12] got to hurt some Spirits you got to hurt
[1:34:15] some devils you got to hurt the feelings
[1:34:17] of some demons I tell you what we've
[1:34:18] done we've quit preaching the gospel and
[1:34:21] we put on a pair of gloves and we've
[1:34:22] started trying to counsel Devils out of
[1:34:24] the church amen and psychology Devils
[1:34:27] out of the church but I say take the
[1:34:28] gloves off this morning amen and look
[1:34:31] that devil square in the face and say
[1:34:33] devil you've gone as far as you're going
[1:34:35] to go you've taken as much as you're
[1:34:37] going to take you've stolen as much as
[1:34:39] you're going to steal there is an
[1:34:40] anointing by the word of faith listen
[1:34:43] I'm not believing a man's idea I'm
[1:34:45] believing thus sayith the Lord and the
[1:34:48] prophet of God said listen we must
[1:34:49] preach that word until every devil backs
[1:34:52] up now I'll say this we must preach the
[1:34:55] word of faith said see amen Paul writes
[1:34:58] to Timothy now somebody say what is amen
[1:35:01] the identifying characteristic of a
[1:35:03] Ministry well Timothy says preach the
[1:35:06] word amen preach the word you be instant
[1:35:09] in season out of season you reprove you
[1:35:12] rebuke you exhort amen with all
[1:35:14] longsuffering and Doctrine he said now
[1:35:16] listen I want my friends both here and
[1:35:18] out in the lands where these tapes will
[1:35:19] go amen the reason I have stood that I
[1:35:22] have heard the word in the very reason
[1:35:24] preached the word he said that's the
[1:35:26] reason I would not Tate amen with any
[1:35:29] Creeds and any denominations amen
[1:35:32] because I have been commissioned Amen to
[1:35:35] stay with the word I say God sends his
[1:35:38] word amen by anointed preachers in
[1:35:41] Romans 10:14 it says how then shall they
[1:35:44] call on him in who they have not
[1:35:46] believed and how shall they believe in
[1:35:48] him of whom they have not heard and how
[1:35:50] shall they hear without a preacher now
[1:35:53] watch and how shall they preach except
[1:35:55] they be sent as it is written how
[1:35:58] beautiful amen are the feet of them that
[1:36:00] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:36:02] Glad Tidings of good things but they
[1:36:04] have not all obeyed the gospel for
[1:36:07] Isaiah saith Lord amen who has believed
[1:36:10] our report so then Faith cometh by
[1:36:13] hearing amen and hearing by the word of
[1:36:17] God Amen so the faith that cometh into
[1:36:19] your heart amen it cometh by hearing the
[1:36:22] word somebody say this morning brother
[1:36:24] Andrew I ain't got no faith well you're
[1:36:26] in the right place amen because I can
[1:36:28] stand here today and say faith
[1:36:31] cometh amen Faith cometh amen Faith
[1:36:34] cometh to the hearing of the word of God
[1:36:37] said then you can only serve God on
[1:36:39] Earth see amen as God's servants that
[1:36:41] sent on Earth amen by divine inspiration
[1:36:45] interprets the word to you another place
[1:36:47] a few years ago when the Holy Ghost when

[1:42:01] preacher on the platform but we need the

[1:44:13] sick and they shall recover can I say

[1:44:23] when you begin to preach the gospel it
[1:44:26] is the casting out of the devil so if I

[1:58:58] morning somebody say well well I ain't
[1:59:01] worthy to praise we ain't praising

[1:59:09] not we ain't praising
[1:59:12] you but he's
[1:59:15] worthy you
[1:59:17] areth somebody say how do you water the
[1:59:20] word well according to a prophet the
[1:59:21] water in the word is the punctuating the
[1:59:23] word with an amen amen yes sir when it
[1:59:26] said repent and be baptized amen when it
[1:59:29] says these other things
[1:59:32] amen that's it amen to everything now
[1:59:35] can I can I just drop something to you
[1:59:37] people get a little bother when people
[1:59:39] in the message go to praising like that
[1:59:41] but can I just tell you something the
[1:59:43] praise of the Bride is
[1:59:45] different right she does not wait until
[1:59:49] it's manifested to praise right but the
[1:59:52] minute she receives the promise she
[1:59:55] begins to praise on the
[1:59:57] promise for the coming
[2:00:01] manifestation see in other words they
[2:00:03] praise before the manifestation then
[2:00:06] when the manifestation comes their
[2:00:08] praise goes to a higher
[2:00:11] level than you thank you Lord uh I said
[2:00:16] like this there was a woman one time in
[2:00:17] a meeting and her husband had been out

[2:02:32] I've got the purchasing power of the
[2:02:34] loaf of bread listen before you get too
[2:02:36] critical before you get too critical let
[2:02:39] me bring you a testimony amen from the
[2:02:41] preaching of that quote there was a man

[2:02:53] front row and just started doing a
[2:02:55] little jig the man is Leukemia 3
[2:02:59] today this ain't emotion this is the
[2:03:02] preaching of the word of faith it's a
[2:03:05] breakthrough on the church it's a
[2:03:07] reality it's a prophecy coming into
[2:03:11] Power God by his spirit amen sends his
[2:03:14] word and then he energizes his word amen
[2:03:17] by his Spirit can I say this to you this
[2:03:21] is the word of the Lord UND deserv
[2:03:23] saying not by might nor by power but by
[2:03:27] my spirit saith the
[2:03:31] Lord somebody say the word the word is
[2:03:34] energized ised by the Spirit by the
[2:03:37] spirit not my

[2:03:46] energize your feelings that's right
[2:03:48] they'll lie to you right brother said
[2:03:51] not by wisdom not by knowledge not by
[2:03:53] denomination but by my spirit will I
[2:03:55] energize my word he said see the
[2:03:58] disciples had it swed into them then the
[2:04:02] Spirit come to energize the word so the
[2:04:05] disciples already had the word so when
[2:04:09] the spirit came it came to the word see
[2:04:12] it's the water of the word of faith that
[2:04:15] energizes the word of God and makes it
[2:04:17] grow in other words you don't maybe
[2:04:20] understand it but right here this
[2:04:21] morning in this building there is an
[2:04:23] unseen energy Among Us Jesus said I am

[2:04:41] be something between us here amen it has
[2:04:44] to be God using us as branches see he's
[2:04:46] being theine now watch this he's
[2:04:49] energizing your heart to believe and

[2:06:17] wall comes amen between a church and a
[2:06:20] pastor amen is when a Pastor so
[2:06:22] surrenders himself to God that he
[2:06:24] becomes basically a dis rag in the hands
[2:06:26] of God and he just becomes so open I'm
[2:06:29] getting open here I'm sorry but he
[2:06:30] becomes so open to receive from the mind
[2:06:33] of God and he comes to the pull pit and
[2:06:35] he's taking time away from his wife he's
[2:06:37] taking time away from his kids and he
[2:06:39] stands here and he's pouring his heart
[2:06:41] out and you sit there like a bump on a
[2:06:43] pickle and you got your mind on your job

[2:06:48] your mind on what you don't like in the
[2:06:50] church amen it'll wear that man down but
[2:06:53] you know what I say I say if we require
[2:06:55] the pulpit to be prepared and we require
[2:06:58] the spirit of the preacher to be yielded
[2:07:00] to receive the word of God I say we
[2:07:02] ought to prepare ourselves to receive
[2:07:05] the word that he has yielded himself to
[2:07:10] receive I ain't afraid of that devil I
[2:07:13] ain't afraid of that devil I've seen it

[2:08:34] to have preeminence in
[2:08:36] everything amen yes remember one time I
[2:08:38] was preaching over in Virginia in a
[2:08:40] meeting one time and brother I just

[2:08:45] preaching and preaching and preaching
[2:08:46] and preaching and I was just giving it
[2:08:48] all I had I just just a young preacher
[2:08:49] just started out on the field and I
[2:08:51] remember I looked over am man man and
[2:08:53] there was a there was a man sitting over
[2:08:55] there and he had his checkbook out and
[2:08:56] his calculator and he had his pen and a
[2:08:57] piece of scrap paper and the whole time
[2:08:59] we was having church he was balancing
[2:09:01] his checkbook I mean it wasn't a casual
[2:09:03] balance it was a a calculator and
[2:09:05] scratch paper
[2:09:07] and so we come out of church and he said
[2:09:09] well he said I'll just say this he said
[2:09:11] I've heard all that before and I said
[2:09:12] well I'll just say this amen I think
[2:09:15] it's a little
[2:09:16] disrespectful he said what do you mean
[2:09:19] so then he wants to start telling me all
[2:09:20] the problems with the pastor you and I'm
[2:09:21] thinking buddy you picked the wrong guy
[2:09:24] Hallelujah he going start telling me how
[2:09:25] the pastor does this and the pastor does
[2:09:27] that and he don't like fish he don't
[2:09:28] like that and all and all of a sudden he
[2:09:30] just looks at me and he goes you know
[2:09:31] what I just I just guess I just I said I
[2:09:33] guess you just need a Revival I said cuz
[2:09:36] I guarantee you when you got saved you
[2:09:38] weren't balancing your checkbook you was
[2:09:40] back in the word of God but when things
[2:09:42] become common Spirits begin to come in
[2:09:45] but can I say this this morning amen
[2:09:48] it's time to break the
[2:09:50] spirit you give room for one devil you

[2:10:04] has got to stand up and say devil you've
[2:10:07] gone his
[2:10:08] far as you're going to
[2:10:11] go now I know what I'm talking about
[2:10:13] spiritual real are you hearing me and
[2:10:16] Spirits want to go from one generation
[2:10:18] to another generation in other words
[2:10:21] what was a spirit in one generation or a
[2:10:23] limitation will be passed down and
[2:10:26] become a limitation in another I
[2:10:28] remember one time like this amen I was
[2:10:30] preaching in a service and while I was
[2:10:31] preaching the spirit of the Lord just
[2:10:32] began to deal with me on temper and I
[2:10:35] began to preach on God delivering
[2:10:36] somebody from a temper and when I said
[2:10:38] that amen there was a man come out the
[2:10:40] back and he come down the altar carrying
[2:10:42] his baby and he was weeping his eyes out
[2:10:44] and I just went over and prayed for him
[2:10:46] I didn't know what he was wanting from
[2:10:47] God Amen but as I was praying for him
[2:10:49] when I got up we left we come back a few
[2:10:51] months later to that church and there
[2:10:53] was a testimony on the bulletin board
[2:10:55] how that God delivered that man in that
[2:10:57] service from a
[2:10:58] temper now you know what motivated the
[2:11:02] Deliverance was he said while the
[2:11:04] minister was preaching he said Spirits
[2:11:06] go from one generation to another he
[2:11:08] said the other day I saw in my daughter
[2:11:11] amen my temper being reflected in her
[2:11:14] and he said I thought God Amen I don't
[2:11:16] want her to carry this he said so we
[2:11:18] came down together God we came down
[2:11:22] together and he said the Holy Ghost
[2:11:24] broke the thing listen friends how many
[2:11:26] believes the Holy Ghost amen still has
[2:11:28] the ability Amen to break generational
[2:11:33] curses he has the ability Amen to break
[2:11:36] besetting sins listen things that
[2:11:38] controlled your fathers and forefathers
[2:11:41] amen do not have a right to control you
[2:11:44] because you are underneath a blood
[2:11:46] sacrifice atement there is a blood and
[2:11:49] that blood is a powerful blood and that
[2:11:51] blood has the ability to say Satan
[2:11:54] you've gone as far as you're going to go
[2:11:56] amen can I take you to the Bible on it
[2:11:58] John 19:30 when Jesus therefore received
[2:12:01] the vinegar he said these words it is
[2:12:08] finished it is finished and he bowed his
[2:12:12] head and he gave up the ghost look at
[2:12:15] this word finished it means to bring to
[2:12:17] a close it means to perform or to
[2:12:20] execute it means to per are y'all ready
[2:12:22] for this it means to perform the last
[2:12:26] act which completes a process well glory
[2:12:30] to God Amen he was in the process of
[2:12:33] redeeming mankind but the last Act was
[2:12:36] when he hung between the heavens and the
[2:12:38] Earth and he said these three words he
[2:12:41] said it is finished that word finish
[2:12:45] means to pay it means Christ satisfied
[2:12:48] God's justice by Dying For All the sins
[2:12:52] of the Saints you need a Deliverance
[2:12:54] this morning how many says I need a
[2:12:55] Deliverance how many says I need a
[2:12:57] healing how many says I need something
[2:12:59] from God can I say this to you you don't
[2:13:02] have to go to Calvary to get it you
[2:13:04] don't have to go hang on the cross and
[2:13:06] die amen listen amen we don't have to go
[2:13:08] to Jerusalem Amen to go to the literal
[2:13:11] Place amen but what was done there has
[2:13:14] come here by the preaching of the Gospel
[2:13:17] of Jesus
[2:13:19] Christ now can I just say something
[2:13:21] that's amazing is when Jesus died he
[2:13:24] said it is
[2:13:26] finished right do you notice what he
[2:13:28] didn't say he did not say cancer is
[2:13:32] finished because if he only said cancer
[2:13:35] is finished that means that's the only
[2:13:37] thing
[2:13:39] finished but he said
[2:13:45] it he said it which gives you the
[2:13:48] license to identify what it is
[2:13:53] is and when you identify what it is then
[2:13:57] you have a right to say it's finished
[2:14:00] can I say this morning amen some of
[2:14:02] y'all need to put depression there and

[2:14:32] resurrection quickening power is in this

[2:18:13] Christ completed the Plan of Salvation
[2:18:15] and healing at Calvary how many believes
[2:18:18] that can I see your hand
[2:18:21] you believe that Jesus Christ completed
[2:18:23] the plan then a prophet said now listen
[2:18:26] the only thing he can do is shock you or
[2:18:29] bring you to an
[2:18:31] understanding that he's still
[2:18:35] God and he keeps his
[2:18:37] promise amen amen so in doing so he
[2:18:41] anoints
[2:18:44] preachers that's These Fine men standing
[2:18:47] around here and many back there he
[2:18:50] anoint oints them to preach am amen
[2:18:55] anointed preachers well Jesus said you
[2:18:58] had a little while in the world shipping
[2:18:59] no more but ye see me because I live ye
[2:19:04] shall live also can I identify three
[2:19:08] people there can I identify the world as
[2:19:11] the unbeliever can I identify ye as the
[2:19:14] believer can I identify I as
[2:19:17] Christ the world seeth me no more but ye
[2:19:20] see me because I live brother said I
[2:19:22] Christ in his church energizing bringing
[2:19:25] the same things he did when he was here
[2:19:28] on the earth he said the Christ that
[2:19:30] sends the man goes with him and is in
[2:19:32] him then Jesus Christ is in his church
[2:19:35] his branches energizing them bringing
[2:19:38] forth the same fruit that he brought
[2:19:41] when he was here on Earth now can I just
[2:19:44] say this it's a powerful statement he
[2:19:46] said then when he comes to the church in
[2:19:48] the last days he comes come in the
[2:19:51] fullness of the light of the Sun so when
[2:19:55] light comes what does light do light
[2:19:58] exposes the darkness now watch here the
[2:20:01] fullness of Christ in the
[2:20:04] bride right is making her
[2:20:13] undefeatable so when he comes in the
[2:20:16] fullness of his light or in the fullness
[2:20:19] of himself he will come in light and
[2:20:22] what he comes into will become
[2:20:24] undefeatable brother said when you
[2:20:26] really realize that God has revealed to
[2:20:29] you the truth of the thing there is
[2:20:31] nothing in the world going to defeat you
[2:20:34] in it that's all you're absolutely
[2:20:38] undefeatable well somebody put your joy
[2:20:41] shoes on in the house of God Amen nud
[2:20:43] somebody next to you and say you're
[2:20:46] undefeatable well I had a bad day you're
[2:20:49] undefeatable young man amen well I don't
[2:20:51] feel like it brother Barry you're
[2:20:53] undefeatable sister Lisa it don't matter
[2:20:55] what the devil flows against you it
[2:20:57] don't matter the Mind battles and the
[2:20:58] stresses and the pressures there is a
[2:21:00] revelation on the inside of your soul
[2:21:03] that's making you undefeatable listen
[2:21:05] then what happens when the word comes
[2:21:07] forth the spirit of God energizes the
[2:21:10] Revelation that's in your soul you all
[2:21:12] know you've come to church on Wednesday
[2:21:14] nights and you said this is my last
[2:21:16] service I can't go another step this is
[2:21:18] as far as I can go and you better barely
[2:21:21] make it in the house of God and you
[2:21:23] barely make it to your seat and you
[2:21:25] barely sit down and the whole song
[2:21:27] service the preacher or the song leaders
[2:21:29] trying to get the world off your
[2:21:30] shoulders and you're just sitting there
[2:21:32] like this and you're saying well I can't
[2:21:34] go no further am I preaching anybody
[2:21:36] well I've gone as far as I can go and
[2:21:38] it's just too hard and then here comes
[2:21:40] that man of God who's fought all hell to
[2:21:42] get to the pull pit and he gets up there
[2:21:45] and he begins to say greater is he that
[2:21:48] is in you than he that is in the world
[2:21:51] he begins to say if God be for you then
[2:21:54] who can be against you he begins to say
[2:21:56] though a thousand fall at one side and
[2:21:58] 10,000 fall at my other side they will
[2:22:01] not come nigh thee and while you're
[2:22:03] sitting there underneath that mind
[2:22:05] battle the spirit of God begins to
[2:22:08] energize the word seed and it causes a
[2:22:11] reaction and you stand up and you say
[2:22:13] yes sir I'm going to make it I've
[2:22:16] already made it I'm going to overcome
[2:22:18] he's already overcome the re Revelation
[2:22:21] in your soul will make you undefeatable
[2:22:24] there is no devil there is no Spirit
[2:22:27] there is no Goliath big enough bad
[2:22:29] enough to defeat this
[2:22:31] bride when the spirit comes to the
[2:22:34] [Applause]
[2:22:39] word when the spirit when it comes to
[2:22:42] the word it'll energize the
[2:22:45] [Applause]
[2:22:49] word you're absolutely
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:22:54] undefeatable amen thank amen not
[2:22:59] you but the god that's in
[2:23:02] [Music]
[2:23:02] [Applause]
[2:23:08] you I just want to let that one hover
[2:23:10] for a
[2:23:12] minute not you that's
[2:23:15] right brother mvin the god that's in you
[2:23:21] not
[2:23:22] Mary the word that was born in her now
[2:23:27] can I have just a few more
[2:23:29] minutes according to Galatians 4 Mary
[2:23:32] was persecuted right right do you know
[2:23:36] when the persecution come he said when
[2:23:39] Christ Jesus was being formed in her
[2:23:42] that's right he says but she was
[2:23:46] undefeatable
[2:23:49] Hallelujah amen well can I just go ahead
[2:23:51] and say it and it's the same thing in
[2:23:55] you
[2:24:00] yes when Christ the hope of glory formed
[2:24:05] in you Christ is being formed in you
[2:24:08] when you are dying and Christ has coming
[2:24:12] to life then watch the persecution set
[2:24:15] in watch trouble start on every hand
[2:24:19] watch the devil will go on a rampage
[2:24:22] certainly when Christ is being
[2:24:26] formed in
[2:24:28] you what are you saying brother Andrew
[2:24:30] I'm saying this in this age you will
[2:24:33] either have a
[2:24:34] breakthrough or you will have a break
[2:24:38] down the spirits are
[2:24:41] real amen yes the pressure are great can
[2:24:46] I just tell you something just just to
[2:24:47] just to leave you with a few thoughts
[2:24:49] here you know what it breakdown is a
[2:24:51] breakdown is a mechanical
[2:24:55] failure a failure of a relationship or a
[2:24:59] system now that's a breakthrough or a
[2:25:02] breakdown but a breakthrough I love this
[2:25:04] a breakthrough is a
[2:25:09] sudden dramatic and important Discovery
[2:25:12] or development are you ready for this it
[2:25:14] is an instant it is an instance of
[2:25:17] achieving success in a particular
[2:25:23] sphere so when you have a breakthrough
[2:25:26] you break into another
[2:25:29] sphere what is a sphere it is a domain
[2:25:33] it is a realm it is a kingdom so the
[2:25:35] Prophet by discernment broke through
[2:25:37] another sphere he said now listen the
[2:25:39] human part is gone and the supernatural
[2:25:41] comes in and works through the human
[2:25:44] flesh the supernatural working through
[2:25:47] see brother says can I read you a few
[2:25:48] quotes here is that okay okay he says
[2:25:51] see you got to break into a sphere that
[2:25:54] people know nothing about he said may it
[2:25:56] sway over the building till people will
[2:25:58] just lose sight of their diseases and
[2:26:01] sway on out in those spheres where they
[2:26:03] can see Jesus and take his word he said
[2:26:05] now come near to me father and anoint
[2:26:08] thy servant and pack me God have mercy
[2:26:12] pack me from this sense bound existence
[2:26:16] into the Spheres where you live so
[2:26:19] obviously Jesus amen does not live
[2:26:22] underneath this sense bound existence
[2:26:25] but there is a sphere that is not bound
[2:26:27] by the Sick senses that a Believer can
[2:26:30] go to and he said now Thou Art here Lord
[2:26:32] oh God amen amen can I can I just preach
[2:26:35] to you for a second hallelujah thank you
[2:26:39] Jesus he says Thou Art here Lord and the

[2:58:19] did you hear from God
[2:58:20] today did you hear from your theophany
[2:58:24] today I know we've got things to do and
[2:58:27] places to go and you know if you're in a
[2:58:29] hurry and you need to go we certainly
[2:58:31] don't want to hold you we want you to
[2:58:33] have the Liberty to just feel free but
[2:58:36] you know something special took place
[2:58:38] here today and I want to say something
[2:58:41] special is taking place
[2:58:44] today you know I just can't help but
[2:58:46] think brother Andrew was was was
[2:58:48] preaching and and the Lord was speaking
[2:58:50] to us through him it just made me think
[2:58:52] about a man one time he came in the in
[2:58:55] the prayer line and in the prayer line
[2:58:57] he got prayed for and and his symptoms
[2:58:59] never changed when he left the prayer
[2:59:01] line and and he came back in the prayer
[2:59:03] line and he saw the prophet again and
[2:59:05] and he said I thought you said I was
[2:59:06] healed and the prophet said I thought
[2:59:08] you believed I thought you said you
[2:59:12] believed and what happened was that man
[2:59:15] caught a revelation in that moment and
[2:59:16] when he caught that revelation it didn't
[2:59:18] matter what anybody thought it didn't
[2:59:20] matter what anybody said to the point
[2:59:22] where the deacons were trying to kick
[2:59:23] him out of some of the churches because
[2:59:25] he had a hat on top of a Cane running up
[2:59:28] and down the aisles saying I can see I
[2:59:31] can see I can see and everybody said
[2:59:34] you're
[2:59:35] blind until one
[2:59:38] day but what did he do he actually
[2:59:41] worshiped all the way along to the place
[2:59:45] where the Barbers were mocking that man
[2:59:48] they were mocking him saying oh you can
[2:59:50] see Canya he was a blind shoe cobbler I
[2:59:53] guess I can relate to it but he could he
[2:59:56] couldn't see anything naturally speaking
[2:59:59] but he could see the Promise and that's
[3:00:01] what counted and because of that
[3:00:03] Revelation in his heart he was able to
[3:00:07] worship and it didn't matter what
[3:00:09] anybody thought and you know what
[3:00:10] brothers and sisters if we have a need
[3:00:12] in our hearts in our lives it doesn't
[3:00:14] matter what anybody thinks you know what
[3:00:16] if we come to the place where our back
[3:00:18] is up against the wall and we get a dose
[3:00:20] of cancer or we're on our deathbed or
[3:00:23] our children need salvation whatever it
[3:00:26] is who cares what anybody thinks
[3:00:29] worship accept the promise of
[3:00:31] God it's here for you now don't wait

[3:03:30] your tender Mercy to us once again amen
[3:03:33] Lord Jesus for you to come by here and
[3:03:37] tell us that there ain't no devil that's
[3:03:40] got any power over your
[3:03:42] bride and father to know that Lord when
[3:03:46] you were here on Earth Earth in the
[3:03:49] flesh and and you you taught you you
[3:03:53] expounded all of the
[3:03:57] scriptures and then you went to the
[3:03:59] cross and as we heard you say this
[3:04:03] morning after you got the vinegar you
[3:04:06] said it's
[3:04:08] finished and Lord I believe you spoke to
[3:04:11] me in that moment a and you said to me
[3:04:16] you gave up the ghost
[3:04:18] and we know you didn't give up the ghost
[3:04:20] to go to Rome you didn't give up the
[3:04:23] ghost to go to heaven you gave up the
[3:04:26] ghost for your bride body and father
[3:04:29] there's a group of people here in
[3:04:30] Calgary today that we accept the
[3:04:33] provision that you have made for us in
[3:04:35] our day and Lord as we receive the word
[3:04:38] for our day we become that word and we
[3:04:40] know that word is nothing else but that
[3:04:44] ghost you gave up at Calvary Lord that
[3:04:46] blood cell that you broke for every
[3:04:49] single one you said it's to whomsoever
[3:04:52] will even as far off as many as our Lord
[3:04:56] God should call Father we love you and

[3:05:29] Andrew father the strength that he has
[3:05:31] poured out today Lord amen father we
[3:05:34] pray that Lord even though he's going to
[3:05:36] be weary in his body for some time now
[3:05:39] we pray that when he goes home he would
[3:05:41] just have a spring in his step from the
[3:05:43] encouragement that he saw by the body of
[3:05:46] Believers here at Calgary
[3:05:48] father we know that it takes your spirit
[3:05:50] Lord but I believe that just as you

[3:05:57] the other side of the log and we saw
[3:05:59] some logs today Father oh Lord Jesus

[3:06:08] that desire we thank you for that
[3:06:09] ability there's only one reason we have

[3:06:16] and all the glory father today we just
[3:06:18] want to remember Davies Franklin Lord

[3:06:36] today Father you could touch that boy in
[3:06:39] the name of Jesus Christ and father he
[3:06:41] could go and see a doctor and the doctor
[3:06:43] would say what happened did he already
[3:06:45] have a surgery because there's no need
[3:06:47] for a surgery we know that that's the
[3:06:49] God you are and father we just rebuke
