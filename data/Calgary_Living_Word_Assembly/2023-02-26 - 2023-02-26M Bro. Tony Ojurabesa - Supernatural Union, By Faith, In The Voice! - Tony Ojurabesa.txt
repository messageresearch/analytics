four years ago when um uh former president United States Donald Trump um threatened to drop the mother of all bombs can you please can you give me that green one he tried to draw the mother of all bombs in North Korea some people got scared well into that back in 2003 the U.S army planned to drop that bomb but the background out of it because they are afraid of the damage you don't do but 14 years later that uh president Trump now told us so they have to go and drop that bomb and that bomb did some damages people of God they said for 20 miles you can see smoke in the sky thank you it was too big that they cannot even put this bomb in any any kind of aircraft that put this bomb in a special cargo airplane that's how big it is once they drop it it does some damage they dropped this in Afghanistan Hallelujah and then then 14 years Donald Trump said he's going to drop the same bomb the mother of all bomb in North Korea and the people got scared because they know they they crazy that young man he cannot predict him so because even the church Minister they're afraid foreign we are not afraid of that amen when I feel that kind of thing amen they say let them throw their bomb amen uh now sometimes uh we are when I believe in the late 50s or early 60s but the brown was in Colorado I said you saw this mother Eagle way up high in the mountain amen with three is binoculars and it's that is then it's you watch from there that eagle was looking towards the sky and they saw a storm coming in Northern coming say and that mother I go to go from that mountain where Paul and flew to the to the playing field and spread the two Wings I'm in the Trap I'm crying amen he said all the igles all the baby eagles in the area come to her Hallelujah I mean they came to her and went to hang on our wings been to hold to with their big on every feather on our wings with a Wings full of eaglets with one flap she was up in the air he met somebody I said that mother a good flu rise with two of that stomach and go through that storm wings through that storm and went into a rock here to there there's somewhere to hide I had English and safety amen she was not afraid of that of that strong and I always says unto God that God's children are not afraid of Trials amen somebody brigidity we're not afraid of tires amen but the Browns said if God has ordained me to go through any trial I will not be a coward but I will pray for grace to go through the trials and to be all right amen in that message she was the father August 11 1954 I said I said Hallelujah it's when I saw the eagle flying through that Storm Into The Rock to keep her babies safe I said Hallelujah it says someday this great happy life we're living in the storm will be coming but our savior will come spread versus wings and I'll take a whole of calvary I'm flat away Hyundai to The Rock into our heaven heaven in his presence and His glory save from all he said so let him drop Adam a bomb at the gym Burns what do I care about that see I got someone who's watching over tonight and you got someone this morning that's fortunate about you Hallelujah somebody said let them drop atomic bomb at regime bombs what do I care amen Hallelujah somebody said why does this church worry about that why the smoke won't be dried up she will be in glory shouting the presence of God with the saints that had gone on why what we care about the atomic bombs and the hydrogen bombs and the z-bombs and all the other bombs say brother we've done God a bomb the busted all the Devils out and they seen out and has a power a bomb of the power of Jesus Christ that made us light enough to fly up to heaven with him amen so don't fear people of God don't live in fear even brother Brown said in the church services the devil come to mess up with the church services say if we if we flog real bad go flogging real bad you got the weeping amen that's why he said before we got here this morning could I send his angels here before us yeah their job reports to make sure the service go successfully because if you notice in the program services after preaching for you start praying for the sea for the sick you know what I'm waiting for I went for him to arrive the angel of Lord and that's how danger life he knows and everyone will change for me to mental health authority you see now I take every street in this building under my control the glory of God brother you have to watch Neil citizen the spiritual realm what's happening when I say that said during the services there are fallen angels in the building when you go to church gospel church sit down also go to church too they are all in a building trying to destroy the services yeah see that's why he had those little babies crying it's not their fault there's a foreign that I can cry and to stop the problem of God preaching right someone about when I say that he said they're all good they're also those challenges are glued to the wall they can't move anymore on the services are over amen and I believe pastor Barry the head here this morning Hallelujah say use it let the devil go to fooling around in the Christian meeting one time and watch what the flogging he gets that's right because our great master of life has clamped up higher and setting in his majesty looking down his eyes like on the sparrow amen and he watches every every one of his children Hallelujah he saw he knows where they are at and what they are doing Hallelujah so this morning Daniel about that the God is there our Master savior there he's watching by you this morning

pastor they see this from my family testimony this this young man that was attending Assembly of God Church in Brazil I just came out from Brazilian way not long ago and that this young man um he uh somebody witnessed the message to him he believed message but did not commit he was not baptized anything so a few years later later God bless this guy he got a nice job and he built me he got married and he built him his dream home and put a swimming pool at the back of the house amen and eventually God blessed this brother and his wife with a little baby girl so someday Brother Don and when that was 10 months old this patlama and the Father the brother went to his job as shiza and this the in-laws came to his their house to say hello to the wife and while they're in the kitchen just having Fellowship brother Emmanuel this baby crawled from the kitchen away from the mother not known to her and come across to the back of the house and found that simple and drowned and die there in that

let my people come back to life begin to breathe that God came back to life Hallelujah somebody and that's why I'm going to this man that our God is not dead your God is not dead he's alive forever

I go see go on please thank you sir in the numbers 56. the prayer of God said now want to see and place this before our audience that God still is the same that he ever was then he said the people get away from God but God Remains the Same where Paul he said in his nature in his power and his desire let me stop right there what's God's there for this liberal Judy Hallelujah God his desire is to he not is a blood wash people a royal priesthood a holy nation a special class of people called the blood of Jesus Christ and you are here this morning you have special people of God that's why you're here this morning so here is something like this from our pastor and myself or another Minister here you are here because you're special class of people to hear this message to understand it Hallelujah so you are special people of God Hallelujah somebody I mean you know guess what you need to act like that yourself like that don't walk around draw up your drop your head and it was a very

people of God don't let you're not the Trashy people yourself as a son and daughter of a king we are Prince and princesses of the king Hallelujah act like that act like that dress like that earlier somebody this morning so what's the problem then why they couldn't start a church today in the message Pastor living message today is the people that get away from God and not God from the people you won't let go not break his word now he already promised you and I he said I would never leave you know forsake you I will come to you I'll be with you even in you till when till then when you make mistake no no to the end of the world even your mistake cannot change God's mind about you whoa nah I feel like Dustin now Hallelujah here now even your music I'm not sure God's mind about you you say you fall you fall you fought you rise again God you don't tell you you're not going to fall but what the Bible says said the righteous fall how many times seven times what happened again even before you rise again you know what because you're not the one holding his hand he's one holding your hands Hallelujah somebody you sing this song Jesus I'll hold my hands I need you everywhere he's holding your head if I'm not holding his hand brother I've left I've dropped that hand so many times but he's the only one holding my hands when I fall he put me up son come on it ain't over yet it ain't over here come on brother Paul Aaliyah you treat somebody he said he threw that God there from God well God not God from people he said they said now what happened then he said they lose their faith oh that's what happened broide that they lose their faith Masters uh president for 35 years all of a sudden another one in North Carolina I haven't started the church in Gastonia not turn their backs against message and blessing the prayer of God the liar that's a blasphemy you call him you know that we have tried that when Barbara he was alive are dead call him a liar oh brother Barry law how much what did they were living in yeah come us all space all everywhere is omnipresent so he's everywhere and it's always has been everywhere and he always will be everywhere I've already said God because he's omniscient first he knows all things so he can be everywhere that makes me only present I'm not I'm the only omnipresent this morning I'll be in Nigeria at the same time while I'm here but I'm number he is omnipresent he can be can you imagine how many people villains are praying to God every second all over the world every second and he has each one request one by one one by one one but and without comparing confusing the request or one with the other what did mardigans because it's omnipresent and because it's an impression that means important all powerful he can do all things so God is Not There People he's not dead he's still doing the miraculous today so what's the problem why why people think they're not seeing results it is the attitude of the people that bring this results Pastor said the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise will bring it to pass all right people that are bringing the results each of us is a creator so we create the atmosphere in which we live in so let's create Specialists away from us I used with somebody amen somebody Hallelujah I love you church if you have a little faith like must just feed you move mountains he said if you have a little like monster you can create another world somewhere and go live there is that what it says they had to go to the an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came came because they got in one place and won Accord and that's the one in his church one Accord one heart Hallelujah one place amen this morning Hallelujah we need to create that atmosphere because God forgot to come and bless us hallelujah somebody he said is the atmosphere that bring the results you say you believe that now you believe that this morning Hallelujah he said let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus and a conjunction believe that you stand person here right now and you see something happening that will cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning that's right you see it this morning Hallelujah somebody is here to bless you you said to answer all your prayers because God does not lie but the man said that's one thing God can never do brother down God can never deny his word when he said he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name they have been there miss now that's not me that when you are in your home God blessed by yourself brother Emmanuel but God loves Fellowship are you with somebody that's why I said we're about two or three I got in mind I've been there amen okay if you can only take your mind off of that brother and sister beside you or somebody else or even your pastor Hallelujah and focus on on Lord Jesus Christ you be blessed people of God because you can't now see Christ and somebody else at the same time it's not gonna happen why do you want to bother about the body person beside you or somebody or sister that don't greet you well I don't care about that don't care about that but Paul said looking not to Jesus and is the word this morning the author and the finish of our faith amen Hallelujah I don't when I come to church I'm here to be blessed amen somebody when the Apostle preaching last last week I was so blessed I'll say they are saying amen don't try to be careful I don't know cause any attraction start running around in this place I love the word of God I'm here I'm not here for sure my sheep somebody we are here to bless our Hallelujah somebody I'm here to Worship the Lord back in the days in America I don't know what you come to do I don't know what you come to do you and you and you and you I come to praise the Lord I come to serve the Lord I don't know what you come to do Hallelujah we are here to Worship the Lord amen somebody Hallelujah you know in every age the problem is not the people if the leaders of the people the ministers that's what he said breakfast buddy it's in every the problem because even in our convention you think we have two more ministers you should bring that nutty down strongly audience but no when they are there they are fighting on Petty doctrines shouldn't be like that amen somebody when you come to the church be like that monkey but Brian said that monkey that's all in Miami that has an instruction I see no evil I hear no evil I speak no evil look straight into Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah somebody let's come together in unity Ephesians 4 verse 1 to 3 says Ephesians 4 1 3 he said therefore I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you meaning I implore you I beg you that ye was worthworthy of the vocation we we are with year course with the loneliness of meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love and the other another was trying hard doing your best to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace assembly now are you with somebody Fellowship fell as you come firstly now assembly amen if we can have a bond of Peace you have to have Felicia first how can you help a brother that doesn't believe this right Doctrine you have to get with him first but if you come first Hallelujah this morning Hallelujah somebody it is to show that God is not dead I want to go ahead and I'm going to be done for just me in a few minutes and then they told this joke that brother was told he said brother Branham do you know that a puppy can hack a hence egg but when I say come on brother password no that's not gonna happen yeah is that atmosphere say that egg and be on that incubator under a chicken or pop your dog once the temperature is when temperature is reached that egg will hash it means I'm somebody I know that I always say that's what it is you don't have to be going from church to church stay where you have people of God support your pastor pray foreign and wonders and powers of God Among the people it is the atmosphere of the people because you I'll pray the gifts Hallelujah and when people got to a place they are reasoning and wondering I wonder how why they brother dressed like that like that I don't care about the brother I'm here to Worship the Lord I wonder how that sister talk like that I don't care about the sister I don't know how I know I know me I don't know what's going through to their heart I know what I know I love Lord Jesus Christ amen wondering I wonder why the person I don't care about past approach I want to believe this is the word I'm gonna say Amen to it and believe it thank you wondering while it's always wondering eventually Wonder out of the church and go somewhere else Wanderers like Cain we don't be wondering wondering thinking Hallelujah Hallelujah are this with me go to a place that they are listening and wandering and stewing and thinking and all top and don't know where they do stand half of them not even spiritually taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right can do it you know the anonymous especially correctly remember a woman that come before she has cancer and she couldn't pray for brother Paul and she was dancing she was dancing disco stops his top stop stop she didn't stop she's Pentecostal you know what she died of cancer for that when you come for God you have to be in your right mind people of God be sending my Hallelujah amen before we close this morning I want I'd like to show you the purpose of the revelation of the son of man in this last days if you don't mind Luke 17 30 is that okay pastor the scripture says in Luke 17 30 and 17 28-30 that as it was in this of Noah so shall be in this when the son of man is revealed and as it was in days of a lot so shall this be in the day when the son of man is revealed why did God choose to repeat the minister of son of man and it is when the world is in Sodom condition people of God remember I said Christ come in three sons name right he came first a son of man which means a prophet right yeah can you see the same in somebody secondly he came as Son of God which is the only ghost in the church in churches and slowly it came as the son of David in a millennium are you still with me he said he came in three sons name he came as son of man Son of God Son of David now son of man is a prophet even Jehovah's himself called Ezekiel said Son of Man give us speaking to a man Prophet call him son of man and Jesus identified himself as son of man because the scriptures cannot cannot be broken and eternally that Army 18 verse 15. said don't let God speak anymore we want Moses to speak to us you said I won't speak to them and no more like that but I will send them a prophet I used it means and then God said the law your God in Germany 15 said the law of God shall raise up a prophet like lacking unto me and so that so that structure cannot be broken he had to come as son of man now that that was for this his age when he was here on Earth there he did when he died Rose ascended and sent back the holy spirit that was the thou the son of God God is a spirit and through the church ages it's been Son of God Amen and don't forget that between the Son of God which is now and the son of David Ministry he had to show up as soon as the prophet then that's what we had today I used to with me amen and then in the Millennium is son of David sitting on the throne throne ruling are you still with me this morning but the purpose of relation the son of man in this last days is no such another Organization no no sir he's not to start another movement he got the attorney message to the United Nation now I'm the message but the question is the messaging you yeah organization that's messed up don't have much upon us but the purpose is to bring about a union with Christ and with one another Hallelujah that's that's what the Bible says first John chapter 1 verse first John 1 verse 5 and 7. first John 1 5-7 he said and this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness will lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another Union Hallelujah and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleansed us from all sin you know what that means that means there's atonement in Fellowship are you within somebody said there's a block coverage for the church chocolate that's why the past will have the authority to cast a brother from that under the blood if he won't repent in 30 days is that okay with me because that guy is protected from by the blood Hallelujah are you still with me this morning by faith in the boys I probably preached three unique messages on that line first he preach domestic the entitled United time and sign United time and sign Hallelujah and they preached and there he told us that in this last days it's only about Union Union you know every everywhere in your jobs in school you know Club societies he said and even watch out now eventually he's going to end up in the Antichrist movement are you with somebody because they are there are you serving somebody amen somebody they have got their each other so that these are bundles are you even talking about somebody that Christ spoke about in Matthew 13 verse 30. and when he spoke about it the Bible is so all right and that's why he said so I went to see his sickness written in on his farm and the enemy came behind him at night brother party and so tears let them grow up together till Harvest at the average time I'll send the India together the the the tears and boundaries and boundaries and today we have Baptist bundle Pentecostal bundle your Club Brando and they're all going to go to the fire at the end and the bread the wheat is going to go to Ghana of God this morning the rest of Abraham this morning and we are going to Rapture by God's grace and also we also appreciate myself and call invisible Union of the blood of Christ there he told us how that in these last days through this message something happening in the spiritual world invisibly God is united with his bride by the word are you with somebody invisibility of the bread of Christ they also preached a message entitled Oneness of unity where he told us that Christ is becoming one today we've got one for the first time to fill that word they are promising John 14 20 where he said at that day what day which day this day you shall know that I am and the father and ye in me and are in you Oneness God and Christ I mean Christ and the bread becoming one Hallelujah the Oneness of unity Hallelujah and this is where I'm going this morning Supernatural Union by faith in The Voice that when you say Amen to every word of this message you are Financial United with Christ because this Bride is a word bride you don't see the difference but you already won Christ because it's the word hallelujah that's why you can say that word because you're part of that word you know we're in the promise of this for this last day love said behold I will send you who you you Tony you Barry you Judy you told me you Paul I'll send you Elijah the prophet so before God said Elijah here he sent you here for us as a great farmer as a great plan that a planet our God is as a good farmer you have to prepare the ground for your crops before you plant it right and what about the seed right so God has a prayer they had they'll received that a bearing grounds for to sow the seed of the spoken for this hour and your heart and my heart that that that building ground somebody that's why I said I send you not to the world you of the Lord and look at somebody um that we're gonna go to heaven in a Rapture for the wedding supper no no no it's for the wedding no sir when it's going on right now when you say Amen to this message you're married to Christ supernaturally he already he's already claiming you Hallelujah you might say well I don't feel like no you have to feel like it there are times don't feel like you're Christian it's happened but was destroyed too you want to kill himself maybe God's not with me but God who was with him and we all feel the same way sometimes we feel that God's not with you but this is all always with you at least you're gonna just just pay attention Hallelujah so the second reason why God sent the Prophet this last day is to bring about faith amen somebody Beyond healing of the body fat for the larger for the body change because listen to the sin of God is hard to have faith for healing of the headache how much for our faith to have you changed the second are you with somebody that's why God sent his message from this last days to give us faith on the Rapture because we are this we are we are the Innocence for this hour we're not going we're not going to test death we're going to be changed Paul said we shall not all we are changed in our night we are the anarchists the seventh one Adam Hallelujah you saw that in Jude chapter 1 verse 14 which you said and enough also there's seven that was seven years seven seven from Adam but beside of this the bride saying behold the law command with ten thousand of his of his Saints that's the brother Hallelujah Hallelujah somebody also Danny also saw that in in his day so he said he saw a thousand thousand Minister before with him to him and instead thousand thousand it's time before him he said judgment is in the western judgment but who minister to the husband with the wife are you listen to somebody named by faith in The Voice and that's why God sent the problem this last day is because we are the innocuous for this hour amen We Shall Not Die somebody for death I'm looking for the rapture because it's a promise Rapture is a promise to do for those who are looking to look for it it's naturally not by faith in The Voice Hallelujah in our test this morning very close I want to is that okay pastor uh I don't want to take your time I was playing I was kind of now I've been careful because I don't want to feel like I'm in Nigeria I keep here all day long preaching I don't want to do that but now I text this point if you ever buy with me with me I want to make few comments on that state this morning in this Instagram I want to open the second Peter again are you with me this morning saying to God second periods chapter one verse 10. Peter said Simon Peter is remember number one use this scripture twice use the same questions here when you preach the message Blasphemous names and inside of such a perfect man are you with somebody says some Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them who the believer they are about 10 like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of of God your righteousness we are saved by his righteousness my Bible said righteous is no good they're like fill their acts they're not good we are saved by a group also by grace are you saved and not that of not of yourself it's a gift of God hallelujah by his righteousness and Savior Jesus Christ two Grace and peace be multiply unto you through how through the knowledge of of God the word and Jesus Christ Our Lord that's how Grace two things are increasing your life in your life Grace and peace as you get in that word that's what we have to encourage you to study message read your Bible daily about Bible daily and pray that's how you grow in Christ Hallelujah and come to church regularly come here the word of God preaching you you don't come for the past person you come for yourself or your soul for your Heavens to go Hallelujah three according as his divine power have given us unto us all things Paul said all things are yours that's why we don't care for anything because all things belongs to us it's a promise Hallelujah is ours we're going to come after them purified we fire God we're going to come back and live on this Earth Brea Paul this world belongs to us not this President well this one will pass

eight messenger that's not credible that's possibility that's that's not the word that's an arrow I know many years ago Brothers Paul there's a man in in Arizona I don't want messages maybe you know him he's the eighth messenger I say yeah yeah you're a liar Messengers I used it with me this morning because when you go to it you're back to the other the beginning again what is this race I used to be this morning so on each of this each other is his own Messenger to them and each of these Messengers are the voice of God to their age age amen now here we are in the seventh age pastor Barry and I want the prophecy Luke 17 30 religion 10 7 Ephesians 4 12 and then foreign to this age the messenger of the of God to this age and God's promise to raise up a prophet not a reformer but a prophet an eagle and I don't kind of like what happened some years ago when David Branham was here and someone in Canada and some a man made myself what do you say your last name is you say my name is Branham isn't that a grandfather a pastor he said no no no no no no no no my grandfather was not a pastor it was a prophet I like that but right it's not a proud Pastor hello he's a prophet he's not a former Hallelujah Pentecost is the last Reformation this is the this is the Homegrown of the Bride are you even somebody um said that he's truly he's the voice of God to us in this age Hallelujah somebody Hallelujah and I want to clarify this today that don't pay attention that those guys are there Peter uh we only have one verse this hour if anybody push anything does not message through the way Hallelujah somebody William Brown is God's voice to us in this age in the message my commission May 5 1951 by the brown said now I'm just your brother by the grace of God very humble man but when the angel of Lord moves down it becomes them a voice of God to you yeah said that right in the audience you can feel resentment from the audience who doesn't think he is he ain't nobody yeah and you know that's it was supposed to walk into when your password to preach for you you say mental word of God pull on this gift don't say who's here I know him before he became Pastor that's that's very kind of right don't talk like that put his man in his place yeah are you with somebody almost done build me he said when the angel Lord come down then it becomes a voice of God to you so after and then somebody starts to resent me I can Peter from this and then the spirit said if an advice saying that forgive me but I felt that that might be resented but I am God's word to you Hallelujah and that's why I'm going to discipline people of God William Bram is God's voice to you to you to you to you to me no nobody else no not even the son not just Abraham not Billy Paul he's God's voice to us Amazon he said I'm God's word to you see I say that again the first time was under inspiration see when I felt bad about it the first time but it then your lord repeated it again I can say imagine pastor Barry when he said the first time the people didn't resent him nothing because it's God's word to you to us hallelujah say now see I can say nothing in myself but what is shows me I said you believe it and watch what happens what a challenge people of God Hallelujah somebody in Mexico another word at the end time July 25 1965 but the man said now I want you to know this is sure and you guys
