[50:49] together the way that you've ordained
[50:51] for us Lord Jesus Through the five-fold

[51:33] very words and we're so thankful Lord
[51:36] that we have a desire to hear these
[51:38] words and to study these words Lord we
[51:40] know that not everyone can take these
[51:42] words father Lord It's like a a
[51:45] medication Lord that only a certain
[51:48] amount at a certain time will work and

[54:20] on the
[54:21] 17th and that will actually not be a
[54:25] youth event per se it will be uh a
[54:29] session on finance by Brother Joel and
[54:32] originally we had announced that we will
[54:33] hold it in the sanctuary here we did the
[54:36] last time but I believe it would be
[54:38] better if we held it in the basement so
[54:40] we will hold it in the basement here of
[54:42] the church after service I believe we're
[54:45] going to start at 2 o' so like we did
[54:47] before if you want to come and attend by
[54:50] all means make arrangements for your
[54:52] lunch lunch will not be served so bring
[54:54] a picnic or run out and grab something
[54:56] quick and come and bring your pen pen
[54:59] and paper and we trust the Lord will add
[55:02] a blessing we also have something
[55:04] special happening that weekend and the
[55:06] next weekend November the 17th and the
[55:09] 24th brother mvin Panetta is going to
[55:11] take the services he's going to speak to
[55:14] us on uh what the Lord has placed on his
[55:18] heart as the treasur of the assembly and
[55:20] I believe it will be a real blessing
[55:22] we've talked about it for uh probably
[55:24] well over a year maybe even two years
[55:27] and uh we just decided the Lord's
[55:30] leadership is now so we're going to go
[55:32] forwards with that on November the 17th
[55:34] as well so we'll have brother mvin take
[55:36] the morning service and then brother
[55:37] Joel will take the info session in the
[55:40] afternoon um we're certainly thankful to
[55:42] be here one more time if you have your
[55:45] Bibles we will just continue on with uh
[55:49] our study in the exposition of the seven
[55:51] Church ages and we' like to read from
[55:53] Revelations chapter 3
[55:58] Revelations chap 3:1 talking about the
[56:00] sardan church
[56:03] age just a tremendous study I
[56:07] uh I believe I got into the weeds today
[56:10] with uh with the message just it it is
[56:14] so uh
[56:17] amazing Revelations chapter 3: one and
[56:21] unto the angel of the church in Sardis
[56:23] write these things saith he that ha the
[56:26] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[56:30] I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name
[56:32] that thou livest and art dead Be
[56:35] watchful and strengthen the things which
[56:38] remain that are ready to die for I have
[56:41] not found thy works perfect before God
[56:45] remember therefore how thou Hast
[56:47] received and heard and hold fast and
[56:51] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[56:55] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[56:57] shalt not know what hour I will come
[57:00] upon thee thou Hast a few names even in
[57:04] Sardis which have not defiled their
[57:07] garments and they shall walk with me in
[57:10] white for they are worthy he that
[57:13] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[57:16] white rment and I will not blot out his
[57:19] name out of the book of life but I will
[57:22] confess his name before my father and
[57:26] before his
[57:27] angels he that hath an ear let him hear
[57:30] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[57:34] let's just bow one more time Heavenly
[57:36] Father we thank you Lord
[57:38] that every single Church age father
[57:41] you've given a space to repent and
[57:44] father tonight we just ask Lord that you
[57:46] would forgive us for every single sin
[57:49] and iniquity in our lives Lord father we
[57:52] cannot live in this world and not sin
[57:55] and we know that you know that father
[57:57] but Lord Jesus you have placed something
[58:00] on the inside of the inside that cannot
[58:02] be touched not even by sin and we thank
[58:05] you for that Lord and tonight we pray
[58:07] that you would just Quicken that Gene we
[58:10] pray that you would Quicken that seed
[58:11] that you've placed in your children one
[58:14] more time father that when we leave here
[58:16] tonight we would say that truly you have
[58:18] spoken to us Lord we just love you and
[58:21] we thank you we commit all that's said
[58:23] and done tonight for you and for your
[58:25] glor glory in Jesus Christ's name we
[58:27] pray amen amen God bless you tonight you
[58:30] may be
[58:33] seated I see I got ahead of myself I
[58:35] typically would do announcements after
[58:37] we seat but I guess maybe a little bit
[58:40] of standing tonight isn't a bad
[58:44] thing last week we uh talked
[58:48] about how the different Church ages the
[58:51] lutherans were the
[58:54] reformation and how brother Bram had
[58:56] that discussion about how in the
[58:58] Reformation
[58:59] age uh they were like the wheat that was
[59:05] um not quite formed yet there hadn't
[59:08] been enough life given through the chaff
[59:12] to Quicken the life into the seed and we
[59:15] know that that's the final part of the
[59:17] cycle the life cycle of a plant that
[59:19] brother branam used which is just a
[59:21] tremendous example he makes it so easy
[59:24] to understand that you have to have a
[59:27] seed and then it actually grows a chute
[59:30] and then you actually have the tassels
[59:32] and then you have the Shu and then you
[59:34] have the seed again and we know that he
[59:37] actually preaches a message the seed
[59:39] shall not be air with the shack and Lord
[59:43] willing will maybe get into that a
[59:44] little bit ways down the road here but
[59:47] you know just sort of recapping on what
[59:49] we were talking about last week brother
[59:52] branam talked about there was a time
[59:54] where you could go out in the field and
[59:55] you could could see the field full of
[59:57] Wheat and you could pick the wheat and
[59:59] you could you could say I've got wheat
[1:00:01] and you could take it and you could rub
[1:00:03] it in your hands when it's nice and dry
[1:00:05] and before the wheat had formed when you
[1:00:07] do that you would see that it's just
[1:00:09] chaff there's no actual seed there but
[1:00:12] at the right time at the right time
[1:00:15] after being dried after ripening in the
[1:00:19] sun after enough Life coming from the
[1:00:22] Shu into this seed that seed formed a
[1:00:26] life and at the right time the farmer
[1:00:28] can go out and do it again and he can
[1:00:30] see the seeds are there and when the
[1:00:32] temperature is right and the humidity is
[1:00:34] Right everything is right then he can go
[1:00:36] and harvest and that's exactly the age
[1:00:39] in which we're living in that's why I'm
[1:00:41] going on about it it's actually a pretty
[1:00:43] amazing comparison and we talked about
[1:00:45] it last time brother Bram said it in the
[1:00:48] message the invisible Union of the Bride
[1:00:50] I can hear the sound of the combine it's
[1:00:52] coming and that's what's happening it's
[1:00:55] a amazing when we look at the world
[1:00:57] around us we can see so much happening
[1:01:01] where we left off was the reading in
[1:01:03] Ezekiel
[1:01:04] 47 verses 2
[1:01:07] to5 and uh maybe I'll just read that
[1:01:12] then brought he me out of the way of the
[1:01:16] gate
[1:01:17] northward and led me about the way
[1:01:20] without unto the utter gate by the way
[1:01:23] that lookth
[1:01:24] Eastward and behold there ran out waters
[1:01:27] on the right side and when the
[1:01:30] man had that had the line in his hand
[1:01:34] went forth Eastward he measured a
[1:01:37] thousand cubits and he brought me
[1:01:39] through the waters the waters were to
[1:01:42] the ankles again he measured a thousand
[1:01:45] and brought me through the waters and
[1:01:46] the waters were to the knees again he
[1:01:48] measured a thousand and brought me
[1:01:50] through the waters were to the
[1:01:53] loins afterward he measured a thousand
[1:01:56] and it was a river that I could not pass
[1:01:58] over for the waters were risen Waters to
[1:02:01] swim in a river that could not be passed
[1:02:05] over that's Ezekiel
[1:02:07] 47:
[1:02:09] 2-5 brother bam he goes on to say here
[1:02:12] and the way that it was done was by
[1:02:15] God's perfect will and programming the
[1:02:18] Lutheran had the Holy Ghost
[1:02:21] potentially just like we were talking
[1:02:23] about the wheat had the seed potentially
[1:02:27] under justification the Methodist had it
[1:02:29] potentially under sanctification and
[1:02:32] today it is brought back a
[1:02:35] restoration the Holy Ghost is
[1:02:38] here Be watchful and strengthen the
[1:02:41] things which remain that are ready to
[1:02:44] die now the ideas expressed in the two
[1:02:47] words watchful and strengthen are these
[1:02:52] to watch contains not only the idea of
[1:02:56] being awake but to be alert to be
[1:03:00] otherwise insinuates danger and loss to
[1:03:04] strengthen means more than just to give
[1:03:08] strength it means to fix and establish
[1:03:12] for
[1:03:13] permanency these two commands refer to
[1:03:16] what is left of the truth which itself
[1:03:20] is ready or about to
[1:03:22] die this expression of the spirit comes
[1:03:25] before me as an
[1:03:27] illustration a group of slaves in total
[1:03:30] bondage physically and morally have
[1:03:33] risen up and escaped from their captors
[1:03:36] indeed that is what Sardis means the
[1:03:38] escaped ones they are pursued and their
[1:03:43] great and glorious gains are all but
[1:03:46] lost they have not been
[1:03:49] retaken but about all that can be said
[1:03:53] is that they have escaped but not clean
[1:03:56] escaped as some were according to the
[1:03:59] word they had lost much of their
[1:04:02] Liberties now the Lord says you are
[1:04:05] potentially back in captivity see that
[1:04:08] you don't go back to keep from going
[1:04:11] back become alert and remain ever
[1:04:14] watchful concerning the things of your
[1:04:16] captivity or you will lose all
[1:04:20] strengthen yourself now in what you have
[1:04:23] left in such a manner as to permanently
[1:04:26] establish what you have and thus ensure
[1:04:30] against future
[1:04:31] loss this will be your opportunity to
[1:04:35] fulfill what you have not
[1:04:38] fulfilled but did they go on no sir they
[1:04:42] did not heed the voice of the spirit and
[1:04:45] another age went into captivity and so
[1:04:49] God raised up others who would carry out
[1:04:51] carry out his will God bypassed the
[1:04:54] Lutheran denomination
[1:04:56] as he has all others and they will never
[1:04:59] come back God had to go on in a new age
[1:05:03] bring forth further truth and a little
[1:05:07] more
[1:05:08] restoration isn't it beautiful that's
[1:05:10] what every single Church age did
[1:05:12] restored just a little further right up
[1:05:14] until the last Church age where there's
[1:05:16] a Total
[1:05:18] Restoration Revelations 3:3 the Judgment
[1:05:23] remember therefore how thou Hast
[1:05:25] received and heard and hold fast and
[1:05:27] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[1:05:31] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[1:05:34] shalt not know the hour which I will
[1:05:37] come upon
[1:05:38] thee I want to read another
[1:05:41] translation W of this verse be
[1:05:45] remembering
[1:05:47] therefore in what way you have received
[1:05:50] the truth as a permanent
[1:05:53] deposit and what way you heard it and be
[1:05:57] safeguarding it and have a change of
[1:06:01] mind at
[1:06:03] once I just want to point this out here
[1:06:07] the truth as a permanent deposit that is
[1:06:11] what we have brothers and sisters the
[1:06:14] truth is a permanent deposit it's not
[1:06:16] something that's given today and taken
[1:06:18] away tomorrow if we have received the
[1:06:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost if we have
[1:06:22] that desire in our hearts you are safe
[1:06:25] Saed until the day of your Redemption
[1:06:27] you're not saved today and lost tomorrow
[1:06:29] because you trip and fall this isn't
[1:06:32] about the way we live in our flesh even
[1:06:34] though our flesh follows the way that we
[1:06:37] live it's an interesting
[1:06:40] comparison Works in our lives is Faith
[1:06:46] expressed The Works that we do Express
[1:06:49] the faith that we
[1:06:53] have it's very evident brother Bram says
[1:06:56] from this verse that God had given them
[1:07:00] truth as a permanent
[1:07:02] deposit it was received and is
[1:07:06] irrevocably
[1:07:08] theirs and
[1:07:10] ours it now remains to be seen what they
[1:07:13] will do with it whether they will regard
[1:07:16] it or not I say Lord help us to regard
[1:07:20] it and that is true they had been given
[1:07:24] the basic truth
[1:07:26] of the whole
[1:07:27] gospel the just shall live by faith
[1:07:30] salvation is of the Lord they had heard
[1:07:33] the truth of the Bible which cast down
[1:07:36] the doctrines of Rome and set at not all
[1:07:40] papal
[1:07:41] Authority they knew the truth that the
[1:07:44] church does not
[1:07:46] save they understood the Lord's
[1:07:49] Supper they had light on water
[1:07:52] baptism they put out the images TR truth
[1:07:56] why there was never an age with any more
[1:07:59] men with so much light to
[1:08:03] shed they had enough illumination to
[1:08:05] completely overhaul the old system or
[1:08:07] start out fresh and let God lead them
[1:08:10] line upon line and precept upon precept
[1:08:13] they received the truth they wanted it
[1:08:16] and heard it but the question was how
[1:08:20] did they hear
[1:08:22] it how did they hear it
[1:08:26] to build upon or was it with the same
[1:08:30] attitude that many Greeks had something
[1:08:34] to discuss and theorize
[1:08:38] over evidently the rich word of Truth
[1:08:42] was being heard in an academic
[1:08:45] manner rather than for practical
[1:08:49] outworking for God was demanding a
[1:08:52] change of mind concerning it
[1:08:56] if this is the word of God which indeed
[1:08:58] it is then it must be obeyed amen
[1:09:02] failure to obey would bring
[1:09:05] judgment when the guards of the Sacred
[1:09:08] Temple were found sleeping they were
[1:09:10] beaten and their garments burned what
[1:09:13] shall the Lord do to those who in this
[1:09:16] age have relaxed their
[1:09:21] guard I will come on thee as a thief
[1:09:24] ancient sard was constantly harassed by
[1:09:27] Bandits that swooped down from the hills
[1:09:29] and pillaged the people thus they knew
[1:09:32] only too well that the spirit was saying
[1:09:35] that in the coming of the
[1:09:37] Lord is as a thief vigilance and
[1:09:41] preparation alone will suffice to be
[1:09:43] ready for his coming now we know that
[1:09:46] this is a message for the false Vine for
[1:09:50] the coming of the Lord will be as it was
[1:09:52] in the days of
[1:09:53] Noah the eight saved were well aware of
[1:09:57] the impending flood and being aware they
[1:10:01] were prepared and
[1:10:04] saved but the word the world sorry of
[1:10:08] the ungodly was swept
[1:10:10] away though they daily were in contact
[1:10:13] with the righteous and heard the
[1:10:16] truth they turned it aside until it was
[1:10:19] too
[1:10:20] late say Lord help
[1:10:23] me those completely carnal people in
[1:10:27] that ancient period type out today the
[1:10:31] nominal Christians whose lives are full
[1:10:34] of Earthly things and take pleasure in
[1:10:38] them to such extent that they have no
[1:10:41] desire for the spiritual and are not at
[1:10:44] all aware of nor ready for his
[1:10:49] appearing just makes me think about the
[1:10:53] times we get together with Believers and
[1:10:55] what's our conversations like how long
[1:10:58] does it take for us to actually get into
[1:11:00] talking about the things of the Lord or
[1:11:03] is it about the presidential election or
[1:11:05] is it
[1:11:07] about sports or is it about you name it
[1:11:11] what do we talk about when we get
[1:11:13] together is it the things of the Lord or
[1:11:14] is it the things of this
[1:11:17] world the eulogy out of Revelations
[1:11:20] 3:4 thou Hast a few names even in Sardis
[1:11:23] which have not defiled their garments
[1:11:26] and they shall walk with me in white for
[1:11:29] they are
[1:11:30] worthy
[1:11:33] my of course the word names means people
[1:11:37] as it says in Acts 1:15 concerning those
[1:11:41] in the upper room the number of names
[1:11:43] together were about
[1:11:46] 120 but to me it goes far beyond just
[1:11:48] signifying people it brings out the
[1:11:51] truth that is set forth in every age
[1:11:54] which was spok spoken to us by our Lord
[1:11:56] with great emphasis it is this the
[1:12:00] church system of these ages is made up
[1:12:04] of two Vines true and
[1:12:06] false god in his own Sovereign purpose
[1:12:09] has put them all together calling them
[1:12:12] the
[1:12:13] church see in this age how he has
[1:12:16] rebuked them saying unto the church
[1:12:18] which is not churches are in Sardis but
[1:12:23] rather lumping them together the church
[1:12:25] which is I Know Thy works you are dead
[1:12:30] your works are
[1:12:33] unfulfilled and then he goes on thou
[1:12:37] this church in Sardis has a few people
[1:12:39] in you that are right and not wrong like
[1:12:42] the majority these people walk in clean
[1:12:46] garments and they are worthy of
[1:12:49] me now these people that were the true
[1:12:53] saints of God were walking all pleasing
[1:12:56] unto the Lord their garments were clean
[1:12:58] you see in those
[1:13:00] days the garments would sweep along the
[1:13:02] road and pick up dirt and
[1:13:06] defilement and I just can't help but
[1:13:08] think you know I I heard a minister say
[1:13:10] it one time in this world that we live
[1:13:12] in it is no different spiritually
[1:13:14] speaking than it was Naturally Speaking
[1:13:16] there we cannot walk in this world and
[1:13:19] not become defiled by this world it's
[1:13:22] just the way it's set
[1:13:24] up but it's not about these garments on
[1:13:26] the
[1:13:27] outside these were watching how they
[1:13:30] walked so that they were not corrupted
[1:13:33] by the world they were in the spirit and
[1:13:37] walking in the spirit and they were holy
[1:13:41] and Without Blame before him thus they
[1:13:44] were fulfilling their purpose for that
[1:13:47] is what Ephesians 1:4 says is the
[1:13:50] purpose of God for us that we should be
[1:13:54] holy and with Without Blame before
[1:13:57] him now from this verse which shows the
[1:14:01] elect of God to be a few names you can
[1:14:05] see clearly what we have been teaching
[1:14:08] about this age it was chaotic it was
[1:14:13] unfulfilled it was split scores of ways
[1:14:17] and God rebuked it almost in its
[1:14:20] entirety
[1:14:22] my it was weak and sickly and ready to
[1:14:25] die it was not the Glorious era that
[1:14:29] carnal-minded
[1:14:30] Protestant historians have tried to make
[1:14:33] it one quick look at that tree saw it
[1:14:37] was cankered and blighted de nuded of
[1:14:42] leaf and Barren of fruit except for some
[1:14:46] deformed and wormy fruit that was fast
[1:14:49] dropping to the ground but hold a moment
[1:14:53] look closer there at the top in the
[1:14:56] light of the sun were some first fruit
[1:15:00] fruits a few names perfect in him for
[1:15:05] they were born of him filled with him
[1:15:09] and walking with him by his
[1:15:12] word thank God for those
[1:15:14] few and isn't that wonderful because
[1:15:17] that's exactly where we find ourselves
[1:15:20] not because of anything that we've done
[1:15:22] we just recognize what he's done not
[1:15:25] just at Calvary either we recognize that
[1:15:27] he sent us a Perfection to his word to
[1:15:31] tie up all of the Loose Ends that were
[1:15:34] not explained and were untied throughout
[1:15:36] all the ages so we can say that clearly
[1:15:39] the first futs a few names perfect in
[1:15:43] him how can we be perfect in this world
[1:15:46] who can be perfect in this world I know
[1:15:47] there's some people that really truly
[1:15:49] believe they're perfect in this world
[1:15:51] they look in the mirror and they think
[1:15:52] my it's just a perfect example of
[1:15:57] perfection I'm not one of them but
[1:15:59] there's people that actually literally
[1:16:01] do that and we know that's not what
[1:16:04] we're talking about we're talking about
[1:16:06] being able to perfectly receive the word
[1:16:09] that's the Perfection we're talking
[1:16:11] about when we can receive this word that
[1:16:13] makes us perfect there's no way in this
[1:16:15] world we're ever going to be perfect at
[1:16:17] sport we're never going to be perfect at
[1:16:18] music we're never going to be perfect at
[1:16:20] speech we're never going to be perfect
[1:16:22] at investing we're never going to be
[1:16:23] perfect at anything in this World there
[1:16:25] will always be someone better than what
[1:16:28] we are the only Perfection we have to
[1:16:31] look forwards to is his word inside of
[1:16:33] us that's the Perfection we're speaking
[1:16:36] of tonight and they shall walk with me
[1:16:39] that is what God says he will bestow
[1:16:42] upon them for this upright walk that is
[1:16:46] their part of their inheritance that he
[1:16:50] has reserved for them and I want to say
[1:16:53] it tonight there is an inheritance that
[1:16:56] is in heaven uncorruptible
[1:16:59] undefiled reserved there for each and
[1:17:02] every one of us who walk before him
[1:17:04] perfect in the age in which we
[1:17:06] live but he has reserved it for them if
[1:17:10] they were willing to walk with him
[1:17:11] through the toils and snares of life and
[1:17:14] be an honor to him he was going to
[1:17:17] reward them he's not forgetful of our
[1:17:20] labor of love God will always recompense
[1:17:24] us for our efforts to please him and you
[1:17:27] know brothers and sisters remember it
[1:17:30] might not be a simple exchange from one
[1:17:33] hand to the other I did something for
[1:17:36] God today tomorrow he's going to reward
[1:17:38] me it's not the way God works it's not
[1:17:40] at all the way God works God just might
[1:17:43] honor our work today two generations
[1:17:47] down the
[1:17:48] line but he does not forget our works
[1:17:51] and he's not unwilling to actually
[1:17:53] recompense us for our work Works in in a
[1:17:55] rather immediate fashion either don't
[1:17:58] get me wrong he he he comes on the scene
[1:18:01] many many times in our lives carrying on
[1:18:04] he says yes they had walked through the
[1:18:05] world and had not partaken of it they
[1:18:07] had not let the World Systems become
[1:18:10] them when the illustrious names of that
[1:18:12] age had yielded to the blandishment of
[1:18:15] the state and chosen political
[1:18:18] mindedness rather than spiritual
[1:18:22] mindedness and were on their way back
[1:18:24] back into the
[1:18:26] world these few stood for the word of
[1:18:29] God and thereby honored the Lord that's
[1:18:32] what we need to do today brothers and
[1:18:34] sisters not to get political mindedness
[1:18:37] not to get political mindedness but
[1:18:39] remember spiritual mindedness is what's
[1:18:41] going to do it amen now he would honor
[1:18:45] them in return for they shall walk with
[1:18:48] him in white they had identified
[1:18:51] themselves with him on Earth and now he
[1:18:54] would identify himself with them in the
[1:18:57] New Jerusalem how marvelous will be that
[1:19:02] identification just
[1:19:04] tremendous it makes me rejoice and yet
[1:19:07] it makes me weep to think of his
[1:19:10] condescension for you will note that he
[1:19:13] is not dressed in another color
[1:19:16] different from the Saints his Earthly
[1:19:19] leaders would so do no they are like him
[1:19:24] he is like them they are like him even
[1:19:27] as John said for they see him as he
[1:19:33] is for they are
[1:19:36] worthy do you realize who is saying
[1:19:39] this do we realize who is saying this
[1:19:43] it's Jesus the worthy one
[1:19:46] himself this is the only one who is
[1:19:49] accounted worthy to take the book out of
[1:19:51] the hand of him who sits upon the throne
[1:19:54] and now this worthy one is saying to his
[1:19:57] Saints you are
[1:20:00] worthy here is this one the only one
[1:20:03] qualified to judge and indeed all
[1:20:06] judgment is committed unto him and the
[1:20:09] words in Romans
[1:20:12] 833b God says I am righteous way
[1:20:18] translation there in the white light of
[1:20:21] God's
[1:20:22] righteousness hear the sweet voice of
[1:20:25] Jesus as he says oh my these are mine
[1:20:30] they are righteous they are worthy they
[1:20:34] shall walk with me in
[1:20:38] white
[1:20:40] my the promise to the
[1:20:43] Overcomer how are we doing for time
[1:20:46] we're doing pretty good the promise to
[1:20:49] the Overcomer Revelations 3:5 he that
[1:20:52] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:20:55] white rment and I will not blot out his
[1:20:59] name out of the book of life but I will
[1:21:03] confess his name before my father and
[1:21:07] his holy
[1:21:09] angels He that overcometh the same shall
[1:21:12] be clothed in white
[1:21:14] rayment this is exactly a repetition of
[1:21:17] verse 4 wherein is made reference to the
[1:21:20] few who have not defiled their garments
[1:21:24] we used to have a saying years ago that
[1:21:27] no doubt was taken from this verse it
[1:21:31] was keep your skirts
[1:21:33] clean it meant don't get involved in
[1:21:37] questionable
[1:21:38] things others will be involved and you
[1:21:42] might be tempted to be involved or
[1:21:45] someone might even try to involve you
[1:21:48] but stay clear of it all by steering A
[1:21:52] Chorus away from it
[1:21:55] we all have that ability in our
[1:21:57] lives the devil's going to bring us
[1:22:00] temptation but we can steer clear of
[1:22:03] it now God is going to reward those who
[1:22:06] follow this
[1:22:08] advice they are going to be clothed in
[1:22:10] white even as he is clothed in
[1:22:14] white Peter James and John saw him on
[1:22:18] Mount
[1:22:20] Transfiguration and his clothes were as
[1:22:23] white as light
[1:22:25] that is how the Saints are going to be
[1:22:28] clothed their garments will be shining
[1:22:30] exceedingly
[1:22:32] white isn't that beautiful brothers and
[1:22:35] sisters we're going to be clothed we're
[1:22:37] going to have a garment we're not going
[1:22:39] to have to try and find that garment
[1:22:41] we're not going to have to try and
[1:22:43] tailor it it's going to be given to us
[1:22:47] exactly the way it's supposed to
[1:22:49] be you know we are living in the end
[1:22:52] time it is in in this age that the
[1:22:56] churches are going to come together and
[1:22:59] as they are even now controlling World
[1:23:02] politics they will soon control the
[1:23:05] finances of the
[1:23:07] world then if you don't belong to the
[1:23:10] world organization of churches you won't
[1:23:14] be able to buy or sell you will lose it
[1:23:18] all those who stay true to God and keep
[1:23:21] their garments clean from the defilement
[1:23:24] of this world's system of church
[1:23:27] orders will be physically
[1:23:31] bereft there will be present presented
[1:23:34] to them a great temptation to give in my
[1:23:38] just take away the food just take away
[1:23:40] gas just take away the ability to pay
[1:23:42] our mortgages things could get really
[1:23:45] really
[1:23:46] tough the Temptation could be strong to
[1:23:49] give in Preachers will give in with the
[1:23:52] excuse that they will serve serve God
[1:23:55] within the framework of the Antichrist
[1:23:57] Beast system we'll just keep the doors
[1:24:00] open we'll say it's okay if you need us
[1:24:02] to sign a declaration to say that you
[1:24:05] know same-sex marriage is actually
[1:24:06] appropriate according to the word of God
[1:24:08] we we're willing to just say okay to
[1:24:10] that yep just keep the doors open and uh
[1:24:13] otherwise we lose our status they take
[1:24:15] our building you know what that could
[1:24:18] happen just like that lose our status
[1:24:21] take our building but you can't touch
[1:24:22] this message he's already declared me
[1:24:26] perfect you can't take that from a real
[1:24:30] believer but preachers will give in with
[1:24:32] the excuse that they will serve God
[1:24:34] within the framework of the Antichrist
[1:24:36] Beast system my goodness they will give
[1:24:39] in to the flatteries and blandishments
[1:24:43] of the hierarchy and all the people will
[1:24:45] follow these false Shepherds right into
[1:24:48] the
[1:24:49] slaughter but in the Judgment they will
[1:24:52] all be found naked
[1:24:54] yes they will not be given those white
[1:24:57] robes neither will they walk with him
[1:25:02] you can't walk in the spotted garments
[1:25:04] of the world holding your holding hands
[1:25:07] with the devil here and then expect to
[1:25:11] be with God am that is strong but it's
[1:25:15] brother and sister true as true can be
[1:25:18] there's no way that we can hold the
[1:25:20] hands with the devil anything in this
[1:25:23] world is of the devil devil the only
[1:25:25] thing that we want to do is hold to his
[1:25:27] unchanging hand I can't help but think
[1:25:30] of this story that Jesus brought he said
[1:25:33] there was a wedding Feast wasn't there
[1:25:35] and someone got in with a different
[1:25:38] garment on they never had the wedding
[1:25:39] garments and he said friend how did you
[1:25:42] get
[1:25:43] in and we know the man had nothing to
[1:25:45] say he was speechless and brother bradam
[1:25:47] I think says it maybe he came popped in
[1:25:49] through a window he he he found a way
[1:25:52] got a ladder and and and took a back
[1:25:54] door somehow worked his way into it
[1:25:56] there will be people that try and do
[1:25:58] that there's only one way one truth and
[1:26:00] one life we talked about it on Sunday we
[1:26:02] need to be justified we need to be
[1:26:04] Sanctified we need to be filled with the
[1:26:06] Holy Ghost Jesus Christ himself that's
[1:26:09] the only way we will be clothed in white
[1:26:12] that's the only way there's no other way
[1:26:15] I think it's so good that's why I keep
[1:26:17] saying it it's so easy it's such a
[1:26:20] simple
[1:26:21] formula don't get caught up and defiled
[1:26:23] in this World brothers and
[1:26:26] sisters they will not be given those
[1:26:28] white robes neither will they walk with
[1:26:31] him you can't walk in the spotted
[1:26:33] garments of the world holding hands with
[1:26:36] the devil here and then expect to be
[1:26:38] with
[1:26:39] God it is time to wake up and hear the
[1:26:42] voice of God crying come out of her
[1:26:45] organized religion my
[1:26:48] people that you be not partakers of her
[1:26:52] sins that you receive not of her plagues
[1:26:55] and here's the thing with that we can
[1:26:57] look at many different churches and many
[1:26:58] different people and many different
[1:27:00] denominations and you know at our level
[1:27:03] on the ground maybe just in Calgary
[1:27:05] Alberta Canada we have churches where
[1:27:06] people are fantastic
[1:27:09] people they're great citizens they truly
[1:27:12] love the Lord and they serve the Lord to
[1:27:14] the capacity of the light that they've
[1:27:16] been
[1:27:18] shown and I believe there's Believers
[1:27:20] there real genuine Believers there
[1:27:24] according to what we're going to get
[1:27:25] into here when we go a little bit
[1:27:26] further but you know brothers and
[1:27:28] sisters when we talk about that we're
[1:27:30] not saying that you can just go
[1:27:31] backwards once you've heard about this
[1:27:33] truth you can only go forwards there's
[1:27:36] no reversing there's no backing up and
[1:27:38] saying well I don't I don't think that's
[1:27:39] good enough I I I just don't think I can
[1:27:41] do it or whatever but where where I want
[1:27:43] to get to with this is to recognize that
[1:27:46] it is very important for us to
[1:27:49] recognize these people in the organized
[1:27:52] religions are good people
[1:27:54] they are not Sinners they're not
[1:27:56] terrible people there's people that are
[1:27:59] going to be in in in glory eternal life
[1:28:03] because of their actions towards the
[1:28:05] bride there's going to be people there
[1:28:08] that do that they they never were
[1:28:10] baptized they never were even saved but
[1:28:13] somehow they're going to be there in
[1:28:14] eternal life and we're going to I'm
[1:28:15] jumping way ahead of myself here but you
[1:28:17] know brother bam he says that they need
[1:28:20] to come out from her plagues and and
[1:28:22] when we look at these churches and we we
[1:28:24] look at these people we can say very
[1:28:26] easily there's no plagues I could look
[1:28:29] at that church I could look at name a
[1:28:30] couple of churches in the city I don't
[1:28:31] see any plagues and we all went through
[1:28:33] covid but that's not what he's talking
[1:28:35] about we we can look at the sins you
[1:28:38] don't want to get partakers be partakers
[1:28:40] of their sins what sins you can look at
[1:28:42] the people and say they're great people
[1:28:44] and their churches are fantastic they
[1:28:46] help the needy they they have soup
[1:28:48] kitchens they do all the things that
[1:28:50] that that help Society what he's talking
[1:28:53] about is the organized ation of religion
[1:28:55] and how we have the Harlot the Harlot
[1:28:59] out of
[1:29:00] Revelations I believe Revelations
[1:29:03] 1314 even later on Revelations 19
[1:29:06] there's the Harlot the Scarlet colored
[1:29:09] woman the Harlot she has a bunch of
[1:29:12] daughters we could get into this and
[1:29:14] we're not going to go too far with it
[1:29:15] tonight but she had a bunch of daughters
[1:29:17] that were harlots and and and uh anyways
[1:29:22] what I'm getting at is the way these
[1:29:24] churches sign up underneath the
[1:29:28] authority of that spiritual headship
[1:29:32] causes all of those other churches even
[1:29:35] here on the ground to be partakers of
[1:29:37] the sin of the great Harlot and you know
[1:29:41] we we talked about it many times there's
[1:29:43] a a movement that happened in the states
[1:29:45] a while ago when brother Ken was still
[1:29:47] alive he played the video of it Tony
[1:29:49] Palmer he he actually said you know what
[1:29:52] the protest with Luther is over the
[1:29:54] lutherans have already signed up under
[1:29:56] the headship of Rome and they've said
[1:29:58] the protest is over we've got a brand
[1:29:59] new document which brings all of the
[1:30:01] Lutheran churches around the world under
[1:30:04] the headship of Rome and now all of the
[1:30:07] other Protestants that were present
[1:30:09] there at that meeting he said now what's
[1:30:12] what's your protest you still have a
[1:30:15] protest and we know there's no protest
[1:30:18] anymore everyone has signed up under it
[1:30:21] but we're certainly thankful that there
[1:30:24] is a few that are willing to walk with
[1:30:27] the Lord even when it gets as dark as it
[1:30:29] as it was here in Sardis even as it gets
[1:30:32] as dark as it is here today on the earth
[1:30:35] we look around and we might not see
[1:30:37] people who are partakers of of the sins
[1:30:40] but just the association under the
[1:30:42] spiritual headship does it that's why we
[1:30:46] have every single reason to Rejoice
[1:30:47] brothers and sisters when we gather
[1:30:49] together oh my sometimes alls we have is
[1:30:52] a Hallelujah but what a tremendous thing
[1:30:54] it is just to say praise our God just to
[1:30:57] give him worship from our very Souls
[1:31:00] what a tremendous thing it is here he
[1:31:02] says my people that you be not partakers
[1:31:06] of her sins that you receive not of her
[1:31:08] plagues amen God is speaking shun the
[1:31:11] religions of this world like you shun
[1:31:14] the plague leave off walking with the
[1:31:17] world and make your garments white by
[1:31:21] repentance and the blood of the Lamb but
[1:31:24] do it now for tomorrow may be too
[1:31:28] late and he that overcometh I will not
[1:31:32] blot out his name out of The Book of
[1:31:35] Life once again we come to a most
[1:31:38] difficult portion of the word this is
[1:31:40] what I was referring to when I said I
[1:31:42] got into the weeds we're going to have
[1:31:44] to talk about this for a little while I
[1:31:47] know it this verse superficially
[1:31:50] regarded will be used by both Armenians
[1:31:53] and and calvinist to suit their purposes
[1:31:57] the Armenians will declare that this
[1:31:59] verse assuredly anuls John 6
[1:32:03] 37-44 all that the father giveth me
[1:32:06] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[1:32:10] me I will in no wise cast out for I came
[1:32:13] down from heaven not to do my own will
[1:32:15] but the will of him that sent
[1:32:17] me this is the Father's will which hath
[1:32:21] sent me that of all which he hath given
[1:32:24] me I should lose nothing but should
[1:32:27] raise it up again at the last day the
[1:32:30] Jews then murmured at him because he
[1:32:32] said I am the bread which came down from
[1:32:34] heaven and they said is not this Jesus
[1:32:38] the son of Joseph whose father and
[1:32:40] mother we know how is it then that he
[1:32:42] saith he came down from heaven just
[1:32:44] getting right into the natural of course
[1:32:47] Jesus therefore answered and said unto
[1:32:49] them murmur not amongst yourselves no
[1:32:51] man can come to me except the Father
[1:32:55] which hath sent me draw him and I will
[1:33:00] raise him up at the last day what a
[1:33:03] tremendous statement that must have been
[1:33:04] for them to hear who will raise them up
[1:33:07] at the last day I will raise them up my
[1:33:11] Armenian ISM makes the will of the
[1:33:14] father not a sovereign
[1:33:17] purpose but merely a complacent desire
[1:33:21] as he stands back to see what all men do
[1:33:25] with his good and gracious gifts and
[1:33:29] even life
[1:33:30] eternal the Calvinists do not see that
[1:33:34] they see in this verse strong
[1:33:37] consolation given to the suffering
[1:33:39] burdened saints that no matter how evil
[1:33:43] are the times how terrible the
[1:33:45] persecution because the Overcomer is one
[1:33:48] who believeth that Jesus is the Christ
[1:33:52] then he will not have his name removed
[1:33:55] from that
[1:33:56] book some also say that this book of
[1:34:00] life is not the Lamb's Book of Life but
[1:34:04] as usual when one regards a verse
[1:34:09] superficially he comes up with a
[1:34:12] superficial understanding and you know
[1:34:14] it just makes me think of the idea where
[1:34:17] we're sometimes looking to solve a
[1:34:20] spiritual problem with a natural
[1:34:23] solution
[1:34:25] there's no way that's ever going to
[1:34:26] happen the devil loves it when we try
[1:34:29] and do that the only way we can solve a
[1:34:32] spiritual problem is with a spiritual
[1:34:36] solution I think it's just an amazing
[1:34:39] part of the actual study of the
[1:34:41] exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:34:44] because when we recognize this what
[1:34:45] we're going to start talking about
[1:34:47] tonight it can change everything about
[1:34:49] how we
[1:34:50] believe when we really can understand it
[1:34:54] and if any of us doesn't understand it I
[1:34:57] strongly recommend seek the Lord for
[1:35:01] Revelation ask God to give you
[1:35:03] Revelation about this and if you do it
[1:35:06] earnestly he will give it he will he
[1:35:09] will not leave us in the weeds as I have
[1:35:12] said
[1:35:14] today some also say that this book of
[1:35:17] life is not the Lamb's Book of Life but
[1:35:18] as usual when one regards a verse
[1:35:21] superficially he comes up with a
[1:35:22] superficial understanding
[1:35:24] the possibility of the removal of a name
[1:35:28] from the records of God deserves more
[1:35:31] than a casual
[1:35:33] study for up until now most students
[1:35:37] have merely drawn a conclusion that God
[1:35:40] places the names of those Born Again
[1:35:43] within the Lamb's Book of Life at the
[1:35:46] time of their rebirth so for me brother
[1:35:49] Barry I don't know everyone has their
[1:35:50] own walk with the Lord I can say very
[1:35:53] clearly that in 2005 July
[1:35:57] 27th if I believed this way there would
[1:36:00] have been a recording angel in heaven
[1:36:02] and he would have been documenting
[1:36:04] brother Barry came into Calgary Living
[1:36:06] Word assembly in the upper room had an
[1:36:08] upper room experience at about maybe
[1:36:10] 7:30 8:00 in the evening and gave his
[1:36:13] heart completely to the Lord July 27th
[1:36:17] 2005 and that would be the record and
[1:36:19] now I would actually have my name put on
[1:36:22] The Book of Life
[1:36:24] but that's not what the prophet is
[1:36:25] saying here and I want to say this I
[1:36:28] want to really emphasize this that's not
[1:36:30] what God is saying through the
[1:36:35] prophet the possibility of the removal
[1:36:38] of a name from the records of God is is
[1:36:39] more than a casual study for up until
[1:36:41] now most students have merely drawn a
[1:36:43] conclusion that God places the names of
[1:36:45] those Born Again within the Lamb's Book
[1:36:47] of Life at the time of their
[1:36:51] rebirth and if for any reason
[1:36:54] that name must be removed the space on
[1:36:58] the record will simply be a blank as it
[1:37:01] was before the name had been placed
[1:37:05] there here we have these words and I'm
[1:37:09] just going to put it out there now and
[1:37:11] let us decide whose words these are this
[1:37:14] is 100% opposite to what the word
[1:37:17] actually teaches
[1:37:20] amen at the very start of our study let
[1:37:23] it be known that there is not one
[1:37:26] scripture that teaches that God is
[1:37:30] presently compiling a record of names do
[1:37:33] you remember when we read that there is
[1:37:35] no compilation of a record of names
[1:37:40] presently this was all done before the
[1:37:42] foundation of the world Amen now this
[1:37:47] takes us to another level this takes us
[1:37:49] to a place brothers and sisters where
[1:37:51] we've got to have faith and not our own
[1:37:54] faith this needs to be the faith of God
[1:37:55] living out through us our own faith will
[1:37:58] come to an end our own faith will lead
[1:38:00] us astray our own faith will actually
[1:38:03] lie to us but it's got to be his faith
[1:38:06] living out through us that we could even
[1:38:09] begin to understand begin to even speak
[1:38:12] these words and think about it how
[1:38:14] someone's name could be on the book of
[1:38:16] life before the foundation of the
[1:38:19] world brother bam says as we will point
[1:38:22] out shortly also
[1:38:23] it is not a question of Simply involving
[1:38:26] ourselves with two groups of people both
[1:38:30] of whom had an opportunity to receive
[1:38:33] eternal life wherein one group received
[1:38:36] it and had their names placed on the
[1:38:39] record while the others who refused it
[1:38:43] refused did not have their names so
[1:38:47] placed he says we will actually show by
[1:38:52] scripture that
[1:38:54] multitudes who were not even born again
[1:38:58] will go into eternal
[1:39:01] life
[1:39:03] multitudes who were not even born
[1:39:06] again one example would be the thief on
[1:39:09] the
[1:39:10] cross he didn't ask him when he got
[1:39:12] saved he didn't say what church did you
[1:39:15] attend where did you get
[1:39:17] baptized he didn't ask him any of that
[1:39:19] did you know any of the Apostles any of
[1:39:21] the disciples he didn't ask him any of
[1:39:23] that
[1:39:24] all he said to him was you'll be with
[1:39:28] me in Paradise
[1:39:31] today that's what he said to him am what
[1:39:35] a tremendous thing
[1:39:37] yes we will actually show by scripture
[1:39:40] that the
[1:39:41] multitudes were not even born again will
[1:39:44] go into eternal life as strange as this
[1:39:47] may sound it is certainly
[1:39:50] true we will also show that there is a
[1:39:54] group of people whose names having been
[1:39:58] placed on that record before the
[1:40:01] foundation of the
[1:40:03] world cannot under any
[1:40:07] circumstances this that's Capitals in
[1:40:09] there too cannot under any circumstances
[1:40:13] have those names removed brothers and
[1:40:16] sisters tonight I just want to say I
[1:40:17] believe that's where we are that's our
[1:40:20] position those people who have taken the
[1:40:23] the fullness of the word in our day and
[1:40:25] said be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:40:27] just like Mary did those who have
[1:40:29] received this message of the hour who
[1:40:31] have been baptized in the name of the
[1:40:33] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:40:35] our sins who have gone through
[1:40:36] justification sanctification all the way
[1:40:39] up to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:41] the infilling the indwelling of Jesus
[1:40:43] Christ cannot under any circumstances
[1:40:46] have your name
[1:40:50] removed but we'll also show
[1:40:53] that another
[1:40:55] group whose names were on that record
[1:40:59] before the foundation of the
[1:41:01] world will have their names
[1:41:07] removed this gets
[1:41:09] heavy this takes reading and
[1:41:13] rereading and I just can't help but say
[1:41:15] I'll warn you I'm I'm actually inspired
[1:41:18] by this I'm going to preach on this now
[1:41:20] we're going to we're going to really dig
[1:41:21] into this I think it's really important
[1:41:23] to recognize it if you have been
[1:41:25] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:27] Christ if you have given your whole
[1:41:29] entire heart to Jesus Christ maybe you
[1:41:31] haven't really en enjoyed the maybe the
[1:41:33] fullness of the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:35] Ghost in your life maybe you can't say
[1:41:36] that I don't I just don't know for sure
[1:41:38] whether I've got the Holy Ghost if you
[1:41:40] have met all of the requirements
[1:41:42] brothers and sisters that's all you have
[1:41:43] to do is meet the requirements it's up
[1:41:45] to him to do the rest of it and alls
[1:41:47] you've got to do is stay put meeting him
[1:41:49] and the requirements the position that
[1:41:50] he's placed Us in and he will do all of
[1:41:55] it and if you have that
[1:41:58] desire you will never have your name
[1:42:01] removed it's impossible for you to have
[1:42:04] your name
[1:42:06] removed now brother Bram I've only got a
[1:42:09] couple minutes left here tonight so
[1:42:11] we'll we'll definitely dwell here for a
[1:42:13] bit I hope it's okay this is this is
[1:42:15] really important stuff to begin with
[1:42:18] there is no basis for the claims that
[1:42:20] the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same
[1:42:24] as the book of
[1:42:26] life I remember talking to someone once
[1:42:28] upon a time and they said no they're two
[1:42:30] separate books totally two separate
[1:42:31] books and I I I thought my that's
[1:42:34] interesting what an interesting thought
[1:42:37] two separate books there's one book that
[1:42:38] just holds the names of those people who
[1:42:40] are going to be in heaven and that's it
[1:42:42] they're the bride the elect and there's
[1:42:43] the other book with all the people that
[1:42:46] can be put on or taken off that's not
[1:42:47] what the prophet's saying here to begin
[1:42:50] with there's no basis for the claims
[1:42:51] that the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:42:53] is not the same as the Book of Life The
[1:42:56] Book of Life might be called the Lamb's
[1:42:58] Book of Life or Christ's Book of Life or
[1:43:01] even thy book and book of the
[1:43:04] living only names are written in
[1:43:09] it Revelations
[1:43:12] 138 and all that dwell upon the Earth
[1:43:15] shall worship Him the Beast whose names
[1:43:19] are not written in the Book of Life of
[1:43:22] the Lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:43:25] the world Revelation 178 the Beast that
[1:43:28] thou sawest was and is not and shall
[1:43:32] Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go
[1:43:34] into predition and they that dwell on
[1:43:37] the Earth shall wonder whose names were
[1:43:40] not written in the Book of Life from the
[1:43:42] foundation of the world when they beheld
[1:43:45] the Beast that was and is not and yet
[1:43:49] is we have Revelations 20:2
[1:43:53] to 15 and I saw the dead small and great
[1:43:58] stand before
[1:44:00] God and the books were open and another
[1:44:03] book was
[1:44:05] open which is The Book of Life and the
[1:44:08] dead were judged out of these things
[1:44:11] which were written in the books
[1:44:12] according to their
[1:44:14] works and the Sea gave up the dead which
[1:44:17] were in it and death and Hell delivered
[1:44:20] up dead which were in them
[1:44:24] and they were judged every man according
[1:44:26] to their
[1:44:27] works and death and hell were cast into
[1:44:30] the Lake of Fire this is the second
[1:44:33] death and whosoever was not found
[1:44:35] written in the Book of Life was cast
[1:44:38] into the Lake of
[1:44:40] Fire I remember hearing about this when
[1:44:43] I was a kid and they had a real push in
[1:44:46] in the denomination I think it was
[1:44:48] actually even through my cousins we went
[1:44:51] to a they went to a Baptist Church
[1:44:53] church when I was growing up and in the
[1:44:55] summertime they had events programs for
[1:44:58] kids and stuff and we went and we
[1:44:59] watched a a movie and I think it was the
[1:45:02] original version of Left Behind and uh
[1:45:06] they they had a lot of tracks and
[1:45:08] different things that they were really
[1:45:10] putting forward and one of them was a
[1:45:12] depiction of this the white Throne
[1:45:14] judgment and I remember as a kid being
[1:45:17] terrified looking at it and thinking
[1:45:19] that there must be a God but everyone's
[1:45:21] going to have to go and stand before the
[1:45:23] Throne of the the great judge and
[1:45:26] hopefully there's something good in our
[1:45:27] lives that's going to be enough to save
[1:45:29] us from having to go down the conveyor
[1:45:31] belt into the Lake of Fire where we're
[1:45:33] just dismissed and I remember just being
[1:45:36] absolutely terrified by it and you know
[1:45:39] having that in my life sort of in the
[1:45:41] background my whole entire life right up
[1:45:44] until that that fateful day where I
[1:45:47] actually heard the prophet's voice where
[1:45:50] I was able to hear him say it that you
[1:45:52] know know what if we judge ourselves
[1:45:55] here then we won't be judged there in
[1:45:57] fact if we truly are the Bride of Jesus
[1:45:59] Christ we our promise from the leodan
[1:46:03] church age is to sit with him in his
[1:46:06] throne we're not even going to have the
[1:46:09] perspective that everyone else in the
[1:46:11] entire world is going to have we're
[1:46:13] going to be looking out from the throne
[1:46:16] judging with the one the one who's
[1:46:19] sitting on the throne it's just just an
[1:46:21] amazing depiction I I think it's
[1:46:24] wonderful it totally changed it for me
[1:46:26] to realize of course he's not going to
[1:46:28] judge his bride she's already
[1:46:32] judged why would he want to
[1:46:53] other books mentioned there is always
[1:46:55] the reference to one book containing
[1:46:59] names in the Revelation it's called the
[1:47:01] Lamb's Book of Life or The Book of Life
[1:47:06] Now where is this book located I better
[1:47:08] call the musicians or I'll keep going
[1:47:11] I'm I'm just getting started with this I
[1:47:12] think this is so
[1:47:14] good where is this book
[1:47:17] located and this is Luke 101 17 to
[1:47:26] 24 and the 70 70 returned again with Joy
[1:47:30] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[1:47:32] to us through thy name and he said unto
[1:47:36] them I beheld Satan as lightning fall
[1:47:39] from Heaven behold I give unto you power
[1:47:42] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[1:47:44] over all the power of the enemy and
[1:47:47] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:47:51] notwithstanding in in this Rejoice not
[1:47:54] that the spirits are subject unto you
[1:47:58] but rather Rejoice because your names
[1:48:01] are written in heaven in that hour Jesus
[1:48:04] rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee
[1:48:06] oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[1:48:08] thou has hid these things from the wise
[1:48:10] and prudent and Hast revealed them unto
[1:48:14] babes even so father for it seemed good
[1:48:18] in thy
[1:48:19] sight all things are delivered to me of
[1:48:22] my father and no man knoweth who the son
[1:48:25] is but the father and who the father is
[1:48:29] but the
[1:48:30] son and he to whom the son will reveal
[1:48:35] him and he turned him unto his disciples
[1:48:39] and said privately blessed are the eyes
[1:48:43] which see the things that ye see for I
[1:48:46] tell you that many prophets and Kings
[1:48:49] have desired to see those things which
[1:48:51] ye see and have not seen them and to
[1:48:55] hear those things which ye hear and have
[1:48:59] not heard
[1:49:00] them brother Bram he says this sentence
[1:49:03] maybe stand with me as we close the Book
[1:49:05] of Life is definitely located in
[1:49:08] heaven it's not in
[1:49:10] Rome it's not in North America it's not
[1:49:13] in South America it's not even on this
[1:49:15] Earth it's just a little bit higher than
[1:49:18] us it's in heaven in that Dimension
[1:49:21] let's just bow in prayer
[1:49:24] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[1:49:26] this word that you've given to us Lord
[1:49:28] thank you for a a Vindicated Prophet
[1:49:30] Lord Jesus a man that would humble
[1:49:33] himself to your word Lord Jesus from an
[1:49:35] early age Lord we thank you that through
[1:49:39] that prophetic office Lord your
[1:49:41] five-fold ministry that we are able Lord
[1:49:44] Jesus to be perfected by this word and
[1:49:47] Lord Jesus
[1:49:49] thereby be able to be clothed in white
[1:49:53] be able to be that group of people that
[1:49:55] we know our names are written and they
[1:49:58] can never be removed because they
[1:50:00] weren't written with pencil and they
[1:50:01] weren't written with pen they were
[1:50:04] written with your
[1:50:05] blood before the foundation of the world
[1:50:08] father Lord I pray that this would
[1:50:10] become so real to your children father
[1:50:12] that Lord when the devil would come
[1:50:14] around and try and tempt us that we
[1:50:17] would be able to just point to that word
[1:50:20] that we would be able to point to that
[1:50:22] position
[1:50:23] that we could say in our flesh indeed
[1:50:26] there's nothing good but that soul that
[1:50:29] you placed in us before the foundation
[1:50:31] of the world Lord we thank you for that
[1:50:34] Revelation Lord we pray that tonight you
[1:50:36] would go with us father that you would
[1:50:38] help this word to become real in our
[1:50:41] lives father in such a way that we would
[1:50:43] recognize there is no way that we could
[1:50:46] ever
[1:50:47] fall we love you father and we thank you
[1:50:50] Lord I pray also that as we read these
[1:50:54] words and we recognize what's happening
[1:50:57] father that we would recognize how we
[1:50:59] have the ability to give people to
[1:51:03] impart to other humans eternal life by
[1:51:07] our
[1:51:08] actions oh Lord the gravity of Our Lives
[1:51:12] is heavy but we know it's no more than
[1:51:15] father way less even than what you had

[1:51:21] your shoulders
[1:51:23] father we have many Sinners potentially
