[48:39] 15 love not the world neither the things

[48:46] the world the love of the father is not
[48:49] in
[48:50] him for all that is in the world the
[48:53] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[48:57] and the pride of life is not of the
[48:59] father but of the world and the world
[49:03] passeth away and the lust
[49:07] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[49:09] God abideth
[49:12] forever as we turn over to 1
[49:15] Thessalonians chapter 5 I just want to
[49:17] remind everyone that the will of God is
[49:20] his word and the will of God is not just
[49:23] the word in print form and and not just
[49:26] the study of the Bible and the
[49:28] memorization of the verses but it truly
[49:31] is the life of Jesus Christ Living out
[49:34] through the individual in this
[49:37] day we have uh 1

[50:25] or a cultural difference father we take
[50:27] it the way that you've given it to us
[50:29] father we know there's no accidents that

[50:55] father that we would just
[50:57] Lord oh father that we would give you
[50:59] the glory that you desire we just ask
[51:02] all these things now in Jesus Christ's
[51:04] name we pray amen God bless you this
[51:06] morning you may be
[51:08] seated we just have a few announcements

[51:21] service but I'm certainly excited to
[51:24] have Wednesday service here because
[51:26] we're going to get back into the
[51:27] exposition of the seven Church ages and
[51:29] you know we left at a real hot spot it's
[51:31] probably one of my favorites in that
[51:33] book and I think it's just going to be a
[51:35] real good service and certainly excited
[51:37] to be able to do that but we're going to
[51:40] uh going to go to Ohio we're going to go
[51:42] and visit some of Brother Paul's
[51:44] siblings we get to participate in a

[52:03] think it's true word Tabernacle in bluon
[52:06] Ohio and uh I can tell you that I'm
[52:08] pretty nervous because we know brother
[52:11] Wayne that boy knows how to preach he
[52:13] knows how to shock the corn is what one
[52:16] of the other ministers said and uh you
[52:18] know he's just a real brother and a real
[52:21] friend he's been a real encouragement to
[52:23] me in in in this position and just as as
[52:26] a friend even before this when we would
[52:29] you know fellowship with brother Ken
[52:30] he's just been a real friend and and I'm
[52:33] certainly thankful to be able to go and
[52:35] and see him so pray for me and we'll
[52:37] certainly be praying for services here

[52:59] certainly excited to see what will
[53:01] happen amen are you happy this
[53:04] morning I truly mean it when I say uh
[53:08] it's exciting to see everybody's face
[53:10] here it's uh it's very humbling to stand
[53:13] in this position it's not something
[53:15] that's taken lightly so God richly bless
[53:18] each one of you as uh we heard earlier I
[53:21] I do want to say uh just a real uh God
[53:25] bless you a heartfelt God bless you to
[53:28] the Sunday School
[53:30] teachers they're the ones that we're
[53:32] trusting with our
[53:33] children and trusting them to to train
[53:36] them up in the way they should go in in
[53:39] terms of the scripture and wasn't it
[53:40] wonderful to hear them reciting
[53:42] scripture just reciting scripture to
[53:45] have the desire to go to Sunday school
[53:46] to to want to be a part of the assembly
[53:49] and it's just a real wonderful thing and
[53:51] we're certainly thankful to have people
[53:53] that have a burden for the children so
[53:56] God God richly bless you Sister Shelly
[53:58] for your commitment to
[54:01] [Applause]
[54:07] that and brother Emanuel God bless you
[54:17] brother certainly wonderful to be a part
[54:20] of the
[54:21] assembly I I want to get back into our
[54:24] discussion about God's Will and uh have
[54:29] you enjoyed the ministry that's come
[54:32] through here hasn't it been wonderful
[54:35] we've been so
[54:37] wellfed I I just think it's amazing I I
[54:40] I felt almost guilty because we had so
[54:42] many ministers come through we had
[54:44] brother Mar o Chua we had brother Dela
[54:46] ad delodon brother Jack Duff and then
[54:49] brother Cadre Diggs all in the same
[54:50] month that that's unheard of here I
[54:53] think but you know I I think we've been
[54:55] really well fed
[54:57] it started by hearing about Resurrection
[55:00] by seed with brother marot Chua and
[55:03] isn't it wonderful to think that if we
[55:06] have been resurrected then that's
[55:08] because we have that seed Gene of God
[55:10] inside of us the only way that
[55:12] Resurrection can happen though is for a
[55:15] death to take place the original life
[55:18] the first man has to rot for that seed
[55:21] to actually take place for that seed to
[55:24] come to life brother Dela preaching on
[55:27] God's provided way so many so very many
[55:31] nuggets in that message that he preached
[55:34] God has a way and he's provided it for
[55:36] us and alls we have to do is accept it
[55:39] it's just tremendous brother Jack Duff
[55:42] chosen for
[55:44] royalty that's what we've been chosen
[55:46] for that's what the resurrection by the
[55:48] seed is that's what God's provided way
[55:50] is is to actually be royalty to
[55:54] understand that and and I just love how
[55:56] brother kadre brought it he topped it
[55:57] off fundamental people with a
[55:59] Pentecostal faith if you could ever get
[56:02] those two people together is everything
[56:03] okay
[56:04] brother okay I wasn't sure if you were
[56:07] motioning to me or not okay fundamental
[56:10] people with Pentecostal faith if you
[56:12] could ever get the fundamentalists
[56:14] together the ones that have all of the
[56:16] mechanics everything looks right
[56:18] everything sounds right they talk right
[56:20] everything is right they know the
[56:22] message oh my but they just don't have
[56:25] that Pentecostal faith to put together
[56:27] with that act that that life that they
[56:29] live but if you can get those two people
[56:32] together those two classes of people
[56:33] brother Bram talked about my goodness
[56:36] look out what we will see is the true
[56:38] manifestation of the word for our day
[56:41] and that's really probably where I'm
[56:43] stuck with you know coming out of the
[56:45] exposition of the church ages the
[56:46] manifestation of the word for our day
[56:50] that's who we are brothers and sisters
[56:52] we're not just churchgoing people we're
[56:54] not just message believers we don't just
[56:57] believe that God sent a prophet you are
[56:59] the literal manifestation of God in this
[57:04] age if you believe his
[57:07] word because if you believe his word
[57:09] you'll believe what the prophet said and
[57:11] you'll take that word and you'll apply
[57:13] it in your own life you'll be just like
[57:15] John as the type of the Bride you'll
[57:17] take that book and you'll eat it up and
[57:18] your flesh won't be able to stand it
[57:20] your flesh won't like it one bit oh my
[57:25] but your soul will
[57:28] talking about God's will God's will for
[57:32] our lives it's his word but it's more
[57:35] than just a print word and we know that
[57:39] it's more than just a print word it's
[57:41] it's it's the word of God through a
[57:43] Vindicated Prophet because outside of
[57:45] that where would we be today am we would
[57:49] be fundamental
[57:50] people without the baptism of the Holy
[57:52] Ghost because brothers and sisters if
[57:54] we've just been baptized in titles we
[57:55] haven't been baptized at
[57:57] all that's pretty sharp but that's true
[58:01] why was it that Paul said to the people
[58:04] unto what baptism have you been
[58:06] baptized and he corrected them he said
[58:09] hey unless you're willing to come and
[58:10] get baptized
[58:12] again you haven't been baptized but
[58:14] anyways I don't want to go too far into
[58:16] that I want to talk about God's Will and
[58:18] it's his word and it's not just a print
[58:20] word it's actually the word given to the
[58:22] age by a Vindicated prophet and isn't
[58:25] that a wonderful thing to think that we
[58:26] have the ability to receive that word
[58:28] because out of millions and billions of
[58:30] people almost nobody in this world can
[58:32] receive that
[58:34] word but it's so beautiful to think that
[58:37] uh he has a
[58:39] will and a
[58:41] way and he doesn't change he doesn't
[58:44] change in his ways or in his character
[58:48] God bless you brother Jo way and sister
[58:50] Becky it's good to see you
[58:52] again they've been away for a little
[58:54] while welcome back
[58:57] Isaiah chapter 54 maybe turn with me
[59:01] there as we as we get into this
[59:03] discussion I want to turn over to Daniel
[59:05] chapter 6 as well we're going to get
[59:07] into a very well-known story about
[59:10] brother Daniel the Prophet but first I
[59:13] want to just talk about Isaiah 54 verse1
[59:19] 17 it's important to remember that every
[59:22] single step of our way that we go
[59:24] through in life nothing not one thing
[59:28] will supersede the word of God in our
[59:31] lives the devil will come around and try
[59:33] and tell us nope God doesn't care NOP
[59:35] God's not listening nope God was never
[59:36] there no God's not real but that's just
[59:39] the devil amen because everything else
[59:41] we just heard about it is going to pass
[59:43] away but his word will
[59:46] remain so all of the trials and
[59:48] tribulations all of the the the lusts
[59:51] that we have in this life whether it's
[59:53] the the the lust of the flesh or the
[59:55] lust of the the eyes whatever it is we
[59:57] all suffer every one of us has one of
[1:00:00] those three maybe two of those three
[1:00:02] maybe three of those three all of us
[1:00:04] suffer with those three Giants in our
[1:00:06] lives brothers and sisters but there
[1:00:08] comes a time where we will absolutely
[1:00:11] overcome every one of them and not to
[1:00:13] say that we won't have those thoughts
[1:00:16] and those Temptations coming our way
[1:00:17] they're always going to come our way
[1:00:19] until we actually either go to the Grave
[1:00:21] or go in the sky one of those two things
[1:00:23] is going to happen to us but we're
[1:00:24] always going to have those temptation
[1:00:26] what's going to happen is they're going
[1:00:27] to have less and less impact on us less
[1:00:29] and less effect on our lives and that's
[1:00:31] where the devil's going to say I don't
[1:00:32] want to go and have to deal with those
[1:00:34] people because I can't get them to
[1:00:37] respond I don't want nothing to do with
[1:00:39] them because they're the literal
[1:00:41] manifestation of the word for their day
[1:00:45] they believe that God sent a prophet
[1:00:47] amen but Isaiah 54:17 when we're going
[1:00:50] through our trials when we're going
[1:00:51] through our Temptations Just remember
[1:00:53] this verse brothers and sisters no
[1:00:56] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[1:00:58] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[1:01:03] against thee in judgment Hallelujah Thou
[1:01:07] shalt
[1:01:08] condemn and you know what it might not
[1:01:10] even be here maybe it'll be before the
[1:01:12] white Throne of judgment but as the
[1:01:14] bride as as the redeemed as as the
[1:01:17] chosen of God we are going to offer
[1:01:20] Grace to everyone yes but that doesn't
[1:01:22] mean they're going to accept it many
[1:01:24] times we're going to get kicked right
[1:01:26] many times we're going to get spit in
[1:01:27] the face many times we're going to get
[1:01:29] rejected but that's not going to change
[1:01:31] the character of Christ Living out
[1:01:33] through US am every tongue that shall
[1:01:36] rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[1:01:39] condemn this is the heritage of the
[1:01:42] Servants of the Lord and their
[1:01:44] righteousness is of me saith the Lord
[1:01:48] now I just can't help but think that you
[1:01:50] know maybe Daniel had this scripture
[1:01:53] written after him in his life because he
[1:01:56] actually the last where we left off was
[1:01:59] I believe it was chapter five yeah it
[1:02:00] was chapter five in in the Book of
[1:02:02] Daniel and and how there was the Feast
[1:02:05] of belshazzar wasn't there he was the
[1:02:07] son of Nebuchadnezzar he was brought up
[1:02:10] in the ways of Nebuchadnezzar we talked
[1:02:12] about this how he knew all about this
[1:02:14] Prophet that God had given as as the
[1:02:17] Captivity of Judah into into the the
[1:02:20] country of Babylon the the people of the
[1:02:22] Chaldeans they had this guy but Bel
[1:02:25] shazar
[1:02:26] grew up and became king when his dad
[1:02:29] Nebuchadnezzar passed away and what did
[1:02:31] he do he got caught up in all of the
[1:02:33] worldly things all the lust of the world
[1:02:34] he got caught up in to the point where
[1:02:37] all of those Devils that were around him
[1:02:39] and in him they said you know what it's
[1:02:41] time to actually just go a little step
[1:02:43] further the devil never just wants to
[1:02:45] let us stay put brothers and sisters
[1:02:48] today this morning the law of the
[1:02:50] universe is you are either growing or
[1:02:52] you are dying you are not neutral there
[1:02:54] is no neutral ground especially
[1:02:56] spiritually speaking brothers and
[1:02:58] sisters you are either spiritually
[1:03:00] growing or you are spiritually
[1:03:03] dying the devil is never going to let
[1:03:05] you have peace never unless you let
[1:03:09] Jesus Christ into your life unless the
[1:03:11] Lord Jesus Christ comes right inside and
[1:03:13] reveals himself to you personally and
[1:03:16] you have that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:18] experience where you have the new
[1:03:20] birth but the devil's not going to let
[1:03:23] anyone just stay put so of course in his
[1:03:26] fashion he took Bel shazar he he's the
[1:03:29] same as he was all along too he can't
[1:03:31] change his ways that's the way God
[1:03:33] created him so what did he do he pushed
[1:03:35] Bazar to just step too far because there
[1:03:38] was a prophecy that was written in
[1:03:40] Jeremiah saying that that Kingdom would
[1:03:42] come to an end and what happened was
[1:03:44] Darius came marched in we know we saw
[1:03:47] the handwriting was on the wall God came
[1:03:50] down and he wrote on the wall brother
[1:03:51] Bram had that happen in the Tabernacle
[1:03:54] in our generation the thing he's the
[1:03:56] same yesterday today and forever it
[1:03:58] sounds like it's kind of Hokey Pokey
[1:04:00] Supernatural but it's
[1:04:02] true he is the same he came in down in
[1:04:05] the Tabernacle Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:04:07] and he wrote the same thing not not the
[1:04:09] same thing Bel shazar but he wrote the
[1:04:12] church ages the the the stages of the
[1:04:15] moon and the complete Black outat the
[1:04:17] complete apostasy in the Leo Dean age
[1:04:20] but isn't it wonderful to think brothers
[1:04:22] and sisters we're no longer in the leoan
[1:04:24] age there's some people that are full on
[1:04:26] in the leodan church age but you know we
[1:04:28] had a prophet in our day come around and
[1:04:30] say this is not the leodan church age
[1:04:33] this is the bride age there is another
[1:04:36] age happening and the same Prophet said
[1:04:39] the ages are not hard start and hard
[1:04:42] stop they blend they always blend and
[1:04:45] that's where it tricks people because
[1:04:46] they miss the
[1:04:48] corner but blessed be the name of the
[1:04:50] Lord fundamental people with Pentecostal
[1:04:52] Faith they can't miss it because they're
[1:04:54] chosen for royalty
[1:04:56] they they didn't even choose themselves
[1:04:58] he chose them before the foundation of
[1:05:00] the world and that's God's provided
[1:05:04] way because there's a seed that has to
[1:05:06] be
[1:05:07] resurrected oh my it's so beautiful but
[1:05:10] there Ain ain't no weapon that's formed
[1:05:12] against you that shall prosper it's that
[1:05:13] way that's that's the Lord's word and
[1:05:17] it's just such a beautiful thing I I'm
[1:05:19] going to take uh a bit of a a a tour
[1:05:22] through Gabriel's instruction to Daniel
[1:05:24] today but first let's let's maybe turn
[1:05:27] over to Daniel chapter 6 if you haven't
[1:05:30] yet let's just read this
[1:05:33] this chapter here hopefully we can get
[1:05:36] through it remembering that God's will
[1:05:38] is his word Daniel is an example of a
[1:05:43] Believer who just trusted God every
[1:05:45] single step of his way he was taken put
[1:05:47] into captivity we talked about this
[1:05:49] early on in this study this is part 10
[1:05:52] of of the series about God's will being
[1:05:54] his word and and Joseph was another
[1:05:57] example of someone that just simply put
[1:05:59] God's word first in his life and and God
[1:06:02] made a way for him through every
[1:06:04] scenario every situation he was not
[1:06:08] destroyed David was carried away into
[1:06:10] captivity with the children of of of
[1:06:13] Judah but in chapter 6 verse1 it says it
[1:06:16] pleased Darius to set over the kingdom
[1:06:19] and 120 princes which should be over the
[1:06:22] whole
[1:06:23] Kingdom and over these three
[1:06:26] presidents of whom Daniel was first that
[1:06:30] the princes might give accounts unto
[1:06:32] them and the King should have no
[1:06:36] damage now we know that Daniel was the
[1:06:39] one that that he God used him mightily
[1:06:42] he he he he was given the ability to see
[1:06:45] dreams and and to interpret them as well
[1:06:48] not just be able to interpret a dream
[1:06:50] and that was what Nebuchadnezzar wanted
[1:06:52] was someone to show him the dream first
[1:06:54] to prove to him that they actually knew
[1:06:56] the dream they knew what they were
[1:06:58] talking about this was a supernatural
[1:06:59] experience so when the interpretation
[1:07:01] came the king would be able to say
[1:07:03] that's truth because nobody would ever
[1:07:06] be able to know what the dream was
[1:07:07] unless the gods revealed it to him but
[1:07:10] we know that it was God one God the only
[1:07:13] God that gave him the interpretation of
[1:07:15] it the the revelation of that
[1:07:17] dream but here we have Daniel in this
[1:07:20] situation now where Bel shazar
[1:07:23] completely forgot about God forgot about
[1:07:26] this prophet and Bazar is taken right
[1:07:29] off the scene according to the prophecy
[1:07:31] now we have Darius stepping in and
[1:07:34] saying this kingdom is mine now everyone
[1:07:36] is going to fall under the jurisdiction
[1:07:38] of my kingdom and and we talked about
[1:07:41] this before how the people even in the
[1:07:43] Chaldeans must have been upset think
[1:07:46] about the people now in darius's Kingdom
[1:07:49] and how there was three presidents that
[1:07:51] he set up but Daniel was the first
[1:07:55] now he wasn't just a captive from Judah
[1:07:58] he was a captive from Judah that was
[1:08:00] taken by the Chaldeans and now he was
[1:08:03] taken by the Chaldeans to be over or
[1:08:05] under darius's
[1:08:08] Kingdom it's pretty amazing you can
[1:08:10] think about how the people must have
[1:08:13] been upset the other presidents the ones
[1:08:14] that thought they were in line for that
[1:08:16] promotion for that position in the
[1:08:18] kingdom and here we have this one that
[1:08:21] was a captive now suddenly he is
[1:08:23] actually right up there one of the three
[1:08:25] protecting the king and you can see that
[1:08:27] the word says it was so that the king
[1:08:29] should have no damage he didn't want
[1:08:31] nothing to do with the people they were
[1:08:33] the king's Shield everything that
[1:08:35] happened in the Kingdom came to these
[1:08:36] three
[1:08:38] presidents Daniel was one of them verse
[1:08:40] three then this Daniel was preferred
[1:08:43] above the presidents and the princes
[1:08:46] because an excellent Spirit was in him
[1:08:50] brothers and sisters today I want to say
[1:08:52] to you if you want to see God's will in
[1:08:54] your life just have his word living out
[1:08:57] through you in your life and you will be
[1:08:59] just like Daniel because the people that
[1:09:02] encounter you whether it's at school
[1:09:04] whether it's at work whether it's in
[1:09:06] your family whether it's in church they
[1:09:08] will see that you have an excellent
[1:09:10] spirit in
[1:09:11] you but man if you're going around
[1:09:13] moping if you're going around saying you
[1:09:15] know you hear about the pastor he's got
[1:09:18] this new vehicle or you got this thing
[1:09:20] or there's that we sang that song again
[1:09:23] there's this problem there's that
[1:09:24] problem if that that's what we're doing
[1:09:26] brothers and sisters that's not the
[1:09:27] spirit of Christ let's call it out if
[1:09:31] you're going to be talking negative you
[1:09:33] are giving voice to the devil Satan is
[1:09:36] speaking through your lips but if you're
[1:09:38] going to have an excellent Spirit you're
[1:09:40] going to be encouraging you're going to
[1:09:42] be uplifting you're going to be speaking
[1:09:43] the word of God people around you are
[1:09:46] going to experience that and they're
[1:09:47] going to love that if you want a
[1:09:50] promotion at work have an excellent
[1:09:53] Spirit if you want to excel at school
[1:09:56] have an excellent
[1:09:58] spirit and I want to tell you brothers
[1:10:00] and sisters those are wonderful things
[1:10:02] aren't they if you want to have
[1:10:05] acceleration in your spiritual walk have
[1:10:08] an excellent Spirit when you come into
[1:10:10] the sanctuary of the Living God because
[1:10:12] you don't come here to hear from Brother
[1:10:15] Barry don't come here to worship with
[1:10:18] brother Paul come here to worship God as
[1:10:21] the
[1:10:22] redeemed you know this is the quietest
[1:10:25] place place we're ever going to be is
[1:10:26] what brother Bram said that's a direct
[1:10:27] quote the quietest place we're ever
[1:10:29] going to be cuz down low it's going to
[1:10:31] be really loud they're going to be
[1:10:32] screaming and saying I should have
[1:10:34] listened I should have taken that whole
[1:10:35] message of the hour I shouldn't have had
[1:10:37] a critical spirit on me but you know
[1:10:40] what they're not going to be as loud as
[1:10:42] the redeemed worshiping God because
[1:10:44] they're going to recognize that they
[1:10:46] could have been there but the redeemed
[1:10:48] are going to be given him the praise and
[1:10:50] the glory that he's desired because it's
[1:10:52] his seed because it's royalty they've
[1:10:55] been chosen to go God's provided way and
[1:10:59] just I just can't get away from this
[1:11:01] thought you know the people who are
[1:11:02] locals here you know you heard me say it
[1:11:04] many times just imagine how holy and how
[1:11:08] magnificent Heaven
[1:11:10] is all of that Heavenly Host all of
[1:11:13] those cherubims and seraphim those ones
[1:11:16] that cry holy holy holy art thou Lord
[1:11:19] God Almighty day and night they're so
[1:11:21] holy but they have to cover their feet
[1:11:24] and they have to cover their face
[1:11:25] but two of their wings are flapping and
[1:11:27] they're crying out to God continually
[1:11:29] before him all of those are going to be
[1:11:32] silent to listen to you
[1:11:35] worship they're going to step back and
[1:11:37] say whoa listen to
[1:11:40] this when we were praying this morning
[1:11:42] before service with the musicians I just
[1:11:44] said you know isn't it wonderful when
[1:11:46] you hear people have those testimonies
[1:11:47] I've heard at least a couple maybe even
[1:11:50] three where people say there's times
[1:11:52] where we're we're singing and and I just
[1:11:54] suddenly hear a sound it sounds like
[1:11:56] there's thousands of people in the room
[1:11:59] brothers and sisters you're breaking
[1:12:01] through that's the theophany body is
[1:12:03] coming that's Heaven and Earth meeting
[1:12:05] in that
[1:12:07] moment there's coming a time where the
[1:12:09] only thing we're going to do is worship
[1:12:11] and that might sound boring to some
[1:12:13] people but the truly redeemed they long
[1:12:15] for that day oh my imagine no more bills
[1:12:19] no more troubles no more sickness no
[1:12:21] more heartaches no more
[1:12:23] misunderstandings no more problem no
[1:12:25] more issues just worship just giving God
[1:12:29] the glory for what he's done for
[1:12:32] us the devil wants us to think well
[1:12:34] sitting around on a cloud if I look at
[1:12:37] it that way I'd think man yeah I'd
[1:12:38] rather go fishing I want to float around
[1:12:40] on a cloud but it ain't going to be like
[1:12:43] that it's not going to be like that at
[1:12:44] all we don't even have an understanding
[1:12:46] of what it's going to be like the
[1:12:48] closest that we can get is just like
[1:12:50] brother brandham said there was a time
[1:12:51] where he went beyond the curtain of time
[1:12:53] and he actually saw those millions of
[1:12:56] people right that's as close as we get
[1:12:59] to it we don't have to eat we don't have
[1:13:01] to sleep we don't have to worry about
[1:13:04] any any of the problems or situation I
[1:13:06] just think it's so beautiful my goodness
[1:13:09] but you know Daniel he had an excellent
[1:13:12] spirit that excellent Spirit was in him
[1:13:16] call it Part B of verse three and the
[1:13:19] King thought to set him over the whole
[1:13:23] realm am this isn't just for Daniel
[1:13:25] brothers and sisters this is for every
[1:13:28] single son and daughter of God on Earth
[1:13:31] you get that excellent spirit inside of
[1:13:33] you and watch out watch and see what
[1:13:36] will happen verse four then the
[1:13:38] presidents and the princes sought to
[1:13:40] find occasion against Daniel concerning
[1:13:42] the kingdom but they couldn't find none
[1:13:44] occasion or fault there was nothing that
[1:13:47] they could find on him you know brothers
[1:13:49] and sisters there's things that we can
[1:13:52] find on everyone on each one of us isn't
[1:13:54] there if we really want to look we can
[1:13:56] get right into the hinder parts and say
[1:13:58] wow there's this about that brother and
[1:13:59] there's this about that sister and
[1:14:01] there's this about the other you know
[1:14:03] unfortunately we all do things we all
[1:14:07] are sinners and have fallen short of the
[1:14:10] glory of God but we don't look at one
[1:14:13] another after the flesh we don't know
[1:14:15] one another after the flesh it's only
[1:14:18] after the
[1:14:20] spirit but to think that Daniel I just
[1:14:24] love how brother Bram says going to get
[1:14:25] into it we got some quotes here you got
[1:14:27] the quotes brother right
[1:14:29] on Daniel he didn't even have a
[1:14:33] church he didn't even have a worship
[1:14:36] service he didn't have anything
[1:14:39] spiritually going for him in his day to
[1:14:41] encourage his walk did
[1:14:43] he but yet this is what the word of God
[1:14:45] says about this man so we don't talk
[1:14:48] about God's will being his word brothers
[1:14:50] and sisters if we have that new birth
[1:14:52] experience there's times in our life
[1:14:54] where we will say how did that happen
[1:14:56] how did I say that how did I react that
[1:14:58] way because there's no way on my own
[1:15:01] accord that I would ever do that and you
[1:15:03] can step back and say thank you Lord
[1:15:06] thank you Lord when you get into worship
[1:15:08] service you don't worry about anybody
[1:15:09] else you say Thank you Lord I know what
[1:15:11] you've done for me this week I know what
[1:15:13] you've done for me this last decade I
[1:15:15] know what you've done for me every step
[1:15:17] of the way in my life there's no reason
[1:15:19] that I would be here today were it not
[1:15:21] for
[1:15:23] you my
[1:15:25] then the presidents and princes verse
[1:15:28] four sought to find occasion against
[1:15:30] Daniel concerning the kingdom but they
[1:15:32] could find none occasion nor fault for
[1:15:35] as much as he was faithful neither was
[1:15:38] there any error or fault found in
[1:15:41] him why then said these men we shall not
[1:15:46] find any occasion against this Daniel
[1:15:50] except we find him except we find it
[1:15:54] against him concerning the law of his
[1:15:57] God and isn't that exactly the way of
[1:16:00] the
[1:16:01] devil brothers and sisters don't worry
[1:16:03] about your flesh in this world just
[1:16:06] don't let like brother brandham said
[1:16:08] don't don't let anything get between you
[1:16:12] and that word for your day don't ever
[1:16:15] let anything get between you and the
[1:16:17] word for your day that's a direct quote
[1:16:19] from Brother bradam it might be a little
[1:16:20] bit bized but it's very much exactly
[1:16:23] like that don't let anything get in the
[1:16:25] way don't let a song leader don't let a
[1:16:26] deacon don't let a neighbor don't let a
[1:16:28] brother don't let a sister don't let a
[1:16:30] Sunday school teacher don't let anybody
[1:16:33] get in the way between you and that word
[1:16:35] because it's not that person it's the
[1:16:37] devil trying to set an occasion so that
[1:16:40] you will stop following the word for
[1:16:42] your day and that's all it's going to
[1:16:43] take brothers and sisters is to be one
[1:16:45] word off Eve was one word off in her day
[1:16:48] she stepped back and didn't follow one
[1:16:50] word for her day and what happened we
[1:16:53] know what happened
[1:16:55] but these presidents and princes they
[1:16:57] sought to find Fulton Daniel they
[1:16:58] couldn't find any so what did they do
[1:17:00] they decided to get low they decided to
[1:17:02] try and find something about him
[1:17:04] spiritually we'll carry on here verse
[1:17:06] six then these presidents and princes
[1:17:08] assembled together to the king and said
[1:17:11] thus unto him King Darius live forever
[1:17:13] all the presidents and Kingdom and
[1:17:16] governors and the princes and counselors
[1:17:18] and the captains have consulted together
[1:17:20] my they really worked hard to get
[1:17:24] something on down Daniel didn't
[1:17:26] they and you can count on it there's
[1:17:29] principalities brothers and sisters and
[1:17:31] Powers working real hard working over
[1:17:33] time to come against the
[1:17:36] bride but no weapon formed against them
[1:17:38] can
[1:17:41] Prevail then these presidents princes
[1:17:43] assembled together to the king and said
[1:17:45] unto him uh King Darius live forever all
[1:17:48] the presidents the kingdom the governors
[1:17:50] and the princes and the counselors and
[1:17:51] the captains have consulted together to
[1:17:54] establish a a royal statute and to make
[1:17:57] a firm decree that whomsoever shall ask
[1:18:00] a petition of any God or man for 30 days
[1:18:04] save of thee Oh King he shall be cast
[1:18:08] into the Den of
[1:18:09] Lions now oh King establish the decree
[1:18:13] and sign the writing that it be not
[1:18:15] changed according to the laws of the mes
[1:18:18] and the Persians which
[1:18:23] alterthe written and it's put into law
[1:18:26] there's no changing it in the laws of
[1:18:28] the mes and the Persians wherefore King
[1:18:30] Darius signed the writing and the
[1:18:33] decree he was in a probably a happy
[1:18:36] State he probably wasn't thinking it all
[1:18:38] the way through because he was friends
[1:18:41] with Daniel he really appreciated Daniel
[1:18:44] Daniel was an asset to the kingdom you
[1:18:47] can
[1:18:49] imagine so we have this story I think
[1:18:52] it's just beautiful because it looks
[1:18:54] like there's a giant weapon formed
[1:18:55] against the the believer for his day
[1:18:57] right
[1:19:00] right now when Daniel knew that the
[1:19:03] writing was signed he went into his
[1:19:06] house and closed all the blinds and ran
[1:19:07] down into the basement and
[1:19:11] cried no no he was a
[1:19:14] Believer he never had a pastor he never
[1:19:17] had a church he never had tapes to
[1:19:19] listen
[1:19:20] to he never had a song service he never
[1:19:24] had any nobody there encouraging him
[1:19:26] just keep going just keep pressing on
[1:19:28] come on brother nobody texting him
[1:19:30] nobody calling him nobody emailing him
[1:19:32] nobody doing nice things or saying nice
[1:19:35] things it was just simply him there and
[1:19:38] what did he do anyone who actually
[1:19:41] disobeyed was going to be thrown into
[1:19:43] the L Den of Lions brothers and sisters
[1:19:46] 700 lb beasts 600 bound beasts that love
[1:19:50] to eat flesh and Crush
[1:19:53] bones why
[1:19:55] now when Daniel knew the writing was
[1:19:57] signed he went into his house and his
[1:20:00] windows being open in his chamber
[1:20:02] towards Jerusalem he kneeled on his
[1:20:05] knees three times a day he just said you
[1:20:08] know amen blessed be the name of the
[1:20:12] Lord whether I live or I die I'm Christ
[1:20:15] ain't nobody going to get between me and
[1:20:17] that word for my
[1:20:21] day three times a day and prayed and
[1:20:24] gave thanks before his God thank you
[1:20:27] Lord that you've made a decree that Lord
[1:20:30] you could manifest your powers greatly
[1:20:34] again in my life before all the people
[1:20:37] of the land he already saw the Hebrew
[1:20:39] kids into the fire right he already
[1:20:43] witnessed that he already witnessed the
[1:20:45] identification of dream he knew that he
[1:20:47] served the Living
[1:20:48] God he recognized the prophet's word
[1:20:52] most of all the reason he was there was
[1:20:55] he recognized the prophet Jeremiah's
[1:20:57] word and he accepted it the way the
[1:20:59] prophet gave it to him and he went
[1:21:01] forwards believing that word and because
[1:21:05] of that God spared his life and it ain't
[1:21:08] no different today brothers and sisters
[1:21:09] if we want to try and interpret the
[1:21:12] prophet's word or say that there's
[1:21:14] something that gives us license to
[1:21:16] disobey the prophet's word which really
[1:21:18] isn't the prophet's word it's actually
[1:21:20] the word of God through a prophet if
[1:21:22] that prophet's Vindicated you're
[1:21:24] actually negotiating with the word of
[1:21:27] God but those people who say Amen to
[1:21:30] that word isn't it beautiful we don't
[1:21:32] have to hold up a sign right there's
[1:21:36] just something on the inside of the
[1:21:37] inside that recognizes that's actually a
[1:21:40] part of spiritual worship it's not just
[1:21:42] being fundamentalist it's actually
[1:21:45] saying God's speaking to me and I want
[1:21:47] more of it speak to me more God give me
[1:21:50] more because the bit that I've had
[1:21:52] already this week it's not enough I need
[1:21:55] a little bit more in my
[1:21:57] life Daniel went into his house and said
[1:22:00] amen thank you Lord gave thanks before
[1:22:03] his God as he did a four time he didn't
[1:22:06] change nothing he just said Thank You
[1:22:07] Lord I know you you are a living God and
[1:22:10] it doesn't matter what weapon gets
[1:22:12] formed against me it cannot Prosper
[1:22:15] verse 11 then these men assembled and
[1:22:17] found Daniel praying and making
[1:22:19] supplication before his God I say Lord
[1:22:23] help me if if there's ever a time in
[1:22:26] this world where I have to do something
[1:22:29] not according to the law of the land let
[1:22:31] it be that I would be found three times
[1:22:34] a day on my knees just like Daniel
[1:22:37] praising the Lord just like I did before
[1:22:40] not because they're putting a squeeze on
[1:22:42] saying no you you believed William
[1:22:44] brandom you need to actually shut your
[1:22:47] doors you can't declare that and N hey
[1:22:50] you know what when that happens we're
[1:22:52] going to say it all that much more
[1:22:54] aren't we or is there some people that
[1:22:57] are going to go hide brothers and
[1:22:59] sisters this is going to come time for a
[1:23:02] showdown that's where we're headed and
[1:23:04] it's rapidly increasing in time there is
[1:23:07] going to be a showdown we can't help it
[1:23:10] I love it though was I was talking this
[1:23:12] week to someone you know we're going to
[1:23:13] have people they're going to come to you
[1:23:15] and one of the first greetings instead
[1:23:16] of just saying hello sir or hello ma'am
[1:23:20] how are you today in this world they're
[1:23:22] going to say how do you identify what's
[1:23:24] your
[1:23:26] pronouns I was telling a brother I'm
[1:23:28] going to say my pronouns are I
[1:23:32] am I am and you know those people they
[1:23:35] won't recognize what you're saying but
[1:23:37] the devil's inside of them they will
[1:23:39] they will understand full well and they
[1:23:41] will say wow look at this is this really
[1:23:45] the manifestation of the life of Jesus
[1:23:49] Christ that's where we're
[1:23:52] headed those guys came near and verse 12
[1:23:54] then they came near and spake before the
[1:23:56] king saying oh my the king's decree
[1:23:59] concerning the king's decree hast thou
[1:24:01] not signed a decree that every man that
[1:24:04] shall ask a petition of any God or man
[1:24:07] within 30 days save of thee Oh King
[1:24:11] shall be cast into the Den of
[1:24:14] Lions the king answered and said the
[1:24:17] thing is true according to the law of
[1:24:19] the mes and the Persians which
[1:24:22] alterthe and said before the King that
[1:24:25] Daniel that Daniel I just want to say
[1:24:29] brothers and sisters take your name and
[1:24:31] pop it in there that brother that sister
[1:24:34] oh my that
[1:24:37] Daniel that
[1:24:40] Daniel which is of the children of the
[1:24:42] Captivity of Judah regardeth not thee O
[1:24:46] King nor the decree that thou Hast
[1:24:49] signed but maketh his petition three
[1:24:51] times a day just pouring it on they want
[1:24:54] to get him in trouble they were just
[1:24:57] jealous it's all getto they just
[1:24:59] couldn't stand the fact that the king
[1:25:01] had favor for
[1:25:03] Daniel but it was because he was of an
[1:25:05] excellent Spirit he had another spirit
[1:25:08] in him and you know I want to say it was
[1:25:10] the Holy Spirit even though some might
[1:25:13] say well brother Barry the Holy Spirit
[1:25:15] wasn't given yet you know what it was
[1:25:17] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:25:18] and forever who was it in the Fourth Man
[1:25:21] in the fire was it God was it Jesus or
[1:25:24] was it the Holy Spirit who was
[1:25:28] it verse 14 then the King when he heard
[1:25:32] these words was sore
[1:25:34] displeased with himself he wasn't upset
[1:25:38] with Daniel for disobeying him because
[1:25:39] he knew that Daniel worshiped God that's
[1:25:42] what made him an asset in his kingdom in
[1:25:45] his
[1:25:45] toolbox then the king heard these words
[1:25:48] he was sore displeased with himself and
[1:25:50] set his heart on Daniel to deliver him
[1:25:55] and he labored till the going down of
[1:25:57] the sun to deliver him I just can't help
[1:25:59] but Wonder as I was studying this as we
[1:26:01] talk about this how many people ever had
[1:26:04] King Darius do that I would wager none
[1:26:09] not one other human being and I could be
[1:26:11] wrong about that but we know that God
[1:26:14] does things a certain way for a certain
[1:26:16] purpose then these men assembled unto
[1:26:18] the king and said unto the king know oh
[1:26:21] King that the law of the mes and the
[1:26:22] Persians is that no Cree nor statute the
[1:26:25] king established may be changed don't
[1:26:28] bother trying to save him it's too late
[1:26:30] we're going to see him get crunched by a
[1:26:32] lions and we're excited to see it it's
[1:26:35] no different hey than the Roman spirit
[1:26:37] that happened where they threw
[1:26:38] Christians into the lions Same Spirit
[1:26:41] it's the
[1:26:42] devil then the king
[1:26:45] commanded and they brought Daniel and
[1:26:47] cast him into the Den of Lions now the
[1:26:51] king spake and said unto Daniel his last
[1:26:54] words to him hey thy God whom thou
[1:26:57] servest continually he will deliver
[1:27:00] thee even this King recognized this was
[1:27:04] a living
[1:27:05] God God would not allow this King have
[1:27:08] any other way out other than recognizing
[1:27:12] him as the deliverer isn't that
[1:27:15] beautiful and we know that a stone was
[1:27:17] brought and laid upon the mouth of the
[1:27:19] dead and the King sealed it with his own
[1:27:21] signant and with the signant of his
[1:27:23] Lords that the purpose might not be
[1:27:25] changed concerning
[1:27:27] Daniel oh my then the king went to his
[1:27:30] Palace and passed the night fasting
[1:27:33] neither were their instruments of Music
[1:27:34] brought before him and his sleep went
[1:27:38] from him and we know this King he was
[1:27:40] pretty
[1:27:42] anxious then the king arose very early
[1:27:44] in the morning and went in haste to The
[1:27:47] Den of Lions and when he came to the den
[1:27:50] he cried with a lamentable voice unto
[1:27:52] Daniel you can only imagine Daniel are
[1:27:55] you there Daniel oh
[1:27:59] Daniel and the King spake and said to
[1:28:01] Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living
[1:28:04] God is thy God whom thou servest
[1:28:07] continually able to deliver thee from
[1:28:09] the Lions oh my you can only imagine
[1:28:12] that moment hey then
[1:28:15] Daniel and then said Daniel unto the
[1:28:18] king oh King live
[1:28:21] forever my God hath sent his Angel and
[1:28:25] have shut the Lion's
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:29] mouths that they have not hurt me for as
[1:28:32] much as before him innocency was found
[1:28:35] in me and also before thee O King I have
[1:28:39] done have I done no hurt isn't it
[1:28:43] wonderful to think that that truly is
[1:28:46] what happened to this man this was on
[1:28:47] Earth this was a manifestation on Earth
[1:28:50] but this was a manifestation of the word
[1:28:51] for his day because of that all of those
[1:28:54] Lions mouths were shut for Daniel's sake
[1:28:58] isn't that beautiful brothers and
[1:29:00] sisters it's no different today and I
[1:29:03] guarantee you there are lions roaming
[1:29:06] around seeking whom they may devour
[1:29:08] Devils Desiring to Chomp on the bones to
[1:29:12] Devour the young to get after the women
[1:29:15] and the children to take down the
[1:29:17] husbands in relationships to destroy
[1:29:20] Church assemblies that's what the devil
[1:29:22] is busy up to but you know what we have
[1:29:25] the ability to say my god he has sent
[1:29:28] his Angel and you know what I have
[1:29:30] believed his word just like Mary said be
[1:29:33] it unto me according to Thy word I might
[1:29:35] not understand it but I'm not going to
[1:29:37] challenge it I'm just going to say hey I
[1:29:39] can see there's an angel and he's got a
[1:29:41] message for someone and I'm going to say
[1:29:43] Amen that message is for me I'm going to
[1:29:45] take that message and I'm going to put
[1:29:47] it in my heart and you know what's going
[1:29:49] to happen is we're just going to
[1:29:50] actually become that message Mary
[1:29:54] actually became that message didn't she
[1:29:57] when she said Amen to that angel just be
[1:29:59] it unto me according to th Thy word what
[1:30:01] happened the Holy Spirit overshadowed
[1:30:03] her and she grew a life inside of her
[1:30:06] now we know that she delivered a baby
[1:30:08] and and you know what we will deliver a
[1:30:10] life also and it will be the life of
[1:30:12] Jesus Christ and that life will no
[1:30:14] longer be able to be contained in these
[1:30:16] fleshy Earth and vessels it will
[1:30:18] actually have to go to its theophany
[1:30:20] body in the clouds one day where we meet
[1:30:23] with those people who are in the graves
[1:30:26] out of Gabriel's instructions to
[1:30:28] Daniel in 1961 brother brandham says in
[1:30:31] paragraph 78 and I want you to notice
[1:30:34] how Daniel yet an alien he wasn't from
[1:30:38] this land he was an alien in this land
[1:30:40] yet an alien ousted from his people
[1:30:42] ousted from his church without one
[1:30:44] church service without any church to go
[1:30:46] to without any hyms to be saying but
[1:30:49] what he sang himself in the midst of all
[1:30:53] this he still held on to what that
[1:30:55] Prophet said amen are we able to do that
[1:30:58] today brothers and sisters doesn't
[1:31:00] matter who comes doesn't matter who goes
[1:31:03] doesn't matter what's up or what's down
[1:31:06] we have the ability to hold on to what
[1:31:08] that Prophet said to us in this
[1:31:11] day I just can't help but think that the
[1:31:13] people that do that they recognize this
[1:31:15] is not a prophet speaking it's not just
[1:31:18] a man if the man is a prophet he's
[1:31:21] actually God's voice box on Earth am
[1:31:25] hallah but my goodness many times we'll
[1:31:28] hear stories we'll see things situations
[1:31:32] will rise and people will just leave
[1:31:34] church oh my people will get upset with
[1:31:37] one another yes there'll be all these
[1:31:39] things you know what it is it's the
[1:31:41] devil it's
[1:31:43] Satan and he wants to upset the people
[1:31:46] of God but just go on praising him
[1:31:49] brothers and sisters go on thanking him
[1:31:51] giving him praise
[1:31:54] he says no church to go to nobody to
[1:31:57] fellowship
[1:31:59] with everybody went to Heathen temples
[1:32:03] and I can't help but Wonder was that
[1:32:04] even the the the children of Judah they
[1:32:08] just go to the Heathen temples and say
[1:32:10] hey everyone else is doing it we might
[1:32:13] as well we know that's what they were
[1:32:15] doing early on in Daniel's visit in the
[1:32:17] Kingdom where they were eating the
[1:32:18] king's meat and drinking the King's Wine
[1:32:22] but not Daniel not Daniel he wasn't
[1:32:25] going to defile himself with any of that
[1:32:27] but here we have this man with no church
[1:32:29] to go to nobody to fellowship with
[1:32:31] everybody went to Heathen temples
[1:32:33] everybody worshiped their Idols no
[1:32:35] Christian songs nobody believed the same
[1:32:38] thing he
[1:32:40] did and in 68 years from a young man of
[1:32:45] about 12 or 14 years old so for 50 years
[1:32:49] the Year of
[1:32:51] Jubilee half a century this man had no
[1:32:55] church no Fellowship no tapes to play
[1:32:59] probably no Bible to even read he just
[1:33:02] had him in his
[1:33:04] heart and you can imagine that there was
[1:33:06] probably some of the sweetest Fellowship
[1:33:08] that ever could take place on earth that
[1:33:11] could ever take place this side of
[1:33:13] Eternity because there's nothing in the
[1:33:15] way there's no man's ideas it's just
[1:33:18] simply Fellowship one-on-one with God
[1:33:20] and we know that God ministered to this
[1:33:22] man why did he minister to this man
[1:33:24] because he was of an excellent Spirit if
[1:33:27] you go later on into Daniel I don't know
[1:33:29] if I'm going to go into it or not Daniel
[1:33:31] 70 weeks he had Visions even while Bel
[1:33:34] shazar was on the scene and so before
[1:33:37] the story that we're talking about God
[1:33:39] came and dealt with him sovereignly he
[1:33:41] had Visions in his head while he laid
[1:33:43] upon his bed and it troubled him and we
[1:33:45] know it's about the RAM and the horns
[1:33:47] and the Bear all these different things
[1:33:49] that he started to
[1:33:51] see but you know God came and dealt with
[1:33:54] him like that when he was busy he was
[1:33:58] busy doing one of those three things
[1:34:00] that he did every day he was busy
[1:34:03] praying and you know what the word says
[1:34:05] as you go further you can go and read it
[1:34:07] later for time sake but what he was busy
[1:34:09] doing was he was busy praying for his
[1:34:11] sins and praying for the sins of the
[1:34:14] people praying for his brothers and his
[1:34:16] sisters interceding for them knowing
[1:34:20] that there was a God and the only way
[1:34:23] was to give all of that life all of that
[1:34:25] trouble and tribulation to God and let
[1:34:28] him sort it out some way somehow it was
[1:34:30] going to happen and you know it wasn't
[1:34:32] until he was 68 years old that he was
[1:34:35] reading in the books a
[1:34:38] prophecy there was a prophecy and when
[1:34:41] he read that brother I'm jumping way
[1:34:43] ahead brother bradam says when he read
[1:34:45] that he got excited and he really got to
[1:34:47] praying and he really got to fasting and
[1:34:50] really trusting that God was going to
[1:34:51] move on the scene for him amen he says
[1:34:55] and in 68 years from a young man of
[1:34:58] about 12 14 years old when he was taken
[1:35:00] down there he held true to God and isn't
[1:35:03] that beautiful brothers and sisters it's
[1:35:04] just exactly like Joseph he held true to
[1:35:08] God there's no making excuses for it and
[1:35:11] and just trusting in Him knowing that he
[1:35:13] knows everything he knows the beginning
[1:35:15] from the end the end from the beginning
[1:35:16] everything in
[1:35:18] between don't look at our flesh when we
[1:35:21] look at our lives brothers and sisters
[1:35:22] we're going to say that we're going to
[1:35:23] fail
[1:35:24] but you know when brother bradam says
[1:35:25] that he's only coming for a virgin the
[1:35:28] the Bride is a virgin you know that you
[1:35:31] know that the Bride of Jesus Christ is a
[1:35:34] virgin he's not talking about our flesh
[1:35:37] don't go there he's talking about his
[1:35:40] word she is a virgin to his word and
[1:35:44] that's all do you have the ability to
[1:35:47] say Amen to his word for the day if you
[1:35:50] do then you are a virgin to Jesus Christ
[1:35:56] amen I think it's just beautiful he held
[1:35:58] true to God and understood by Jeremiah's
[1:36:02] Prophet that the days were almost
[1:36:05] accomplished we know that Jeremiah was
[1:36:08] alive in 606 BC and he prophesied
[1:36:12] because of their sins and their
[1:36:14] ungodliness that they would be there for
[1:36:16] 70 years they would be led into
[1:36:19] captivity for 70 years but you know
[1:36:22] brothers and sisters not everyone was
[1:36:24] led into
[1:36:25] captivity we need to remember that there
[1:36:27] was a lot of people most of the people
[1:36:29] were not led into captivity most of the
[1:36:31] people were actually
[1:36:33] destroyed because the spirit of God
[1:36:35] prophesied through this Prophet Jeremiah
[1:36:37] to go through the land and not spare not
[1:36:40] spare the women not spare the children
[1:36:42] don't worry about the elderly you know
[1:36:44] what when they cry out to me I'm not
[1:36:46] going to have pity for them because I
[1:36:48] called unto them over and over and over
[1:36:51] again and they continually rejected me
[1:36:53] and they continually mocked me but they
[1:36:55] would say no no no we just simply mocked
[1:36:57] that man we just simply talk bad about
[1:36:59] that man we just simply talk behind that
[1:37:01] man's back we just simply talked about
[1:37:03] him and and disregarded him but what
[1:37:05] they didn't realize is that man was the
[1:37:08] voice of God for their
[1:37:10] day and the more they did it the more
[1:37:13] they disrespected God and God you know
[1:37:15] he eventually came to the place where
[1:37:16] the Prophet said to them you know even
[1:37:17] though your city is under siege
[1:37:20] Jerusalem was under siege with
[1:37:21] Nebuchadnezzar they were camped around
[1:37:23] it they were starving them out and we
[1:37:25] know the people just turned into Savages
[1:37:27] they were they were eating young the
[1:37:29] children boiling babies how Savage can
[1:37:33] you get those were Believers right the
[1:37:35] chosen ones in Jerusalem that's how bad
[1:37:38] it got while they were yet Under Siege
[1:37:40] God came to them in the prophet and said
[1:37:43] if you would just go and submit yourself
[1:37:46] to the king to King Nebuchadnezzar go
[1:37:49] surrender say I'm sorry you'll live
[1:37:53] right but if you got so much pride so
[1:37:57] much pride you'll say nope I won't hear
[1:37:59] one word of Correction no way I've gone
[1:38:01] so far out on this limb I'm not going to
[1:38:03] go back not one inch what's going to
[1:38:06] happen is you're going to
[1:38:07] die that's what the prophet told him you
[1:38:10] will die but at least you have the
[1:38:11] opportunity to live if you will Just
[1:38:13] Surrender yourself to the king you'll
[1:38:15] live as a slave the rest of the days of
[1:38:17] your life but at least you
[1:38:20] live and they never had the ability to
[1:38:23] get rid of that Pride one of those one
[1:38:25] of those lusts one of those things that
[1:38:27] we read about those things that will all
[1:38:29] pass away that thing had more power over
[1:38:32] them than the ability to surrender
[1:38:34] themselves to the word of
[1:38:38] God I want to encourage us today if you
[1:38:40] got the ability to surrender to the word
[1:38:42] of God don't let the devil tell you
[1:38:45] nothing if it's if you hear any thought
[1:38:47] or any idea come to you that's contrary
[1:38:49] to the word just dismiss it and say it's
[1:38:51] Satan it's Satan it's Satan you know
[1:38:52] when you get bad thoughts thoughts
[1:38:53] they're not your thoughts brothers and
[1:38:54] sisters it's the devil the devil has
[1:38:56] learned that you react to those thoughts
[1:38:59] and so because he knows you react to
[1:39:00] those thoughts he continually gives you
[1:39:02] those thoughts and you know maybe you
[1:39:04] don't react to those thoughts but maybe
[1:39:05] your dad did maybe your mother did maybe
[1:39:07] your grandfather your grandmother maybe
[1:39:09] your great great great great great
[1:39:11] person actually reacted in certain ways
[1:39:13] to those thoughts but you know as long
[1:39:15] as we entertain those thoughts and we
[1:39:18] actually act on those thoughts the devil
[1:39:20] is going to have victory in our lives
[1:39:22] he's going to have a toe hole he's going
[1:39:23] to have his fingernail in the crack of
[1:39:25] the door of our lives but as soon as we
[1:39:28] actually start slamming that door on him
[1:39:30] and saying no that's not my thought
[1:39:31] that's your thought that's that's you
[1:39:33] that's the devil anything contrary to
[1:39:35] the word of God brothers and sisters
[1:39:37] anything that would play into to those
[1:39:40] lusts is of the
[1:39:42] devil there comes a point in time where
[1:39:45] a son and daughter of God is no longer
[1:39:47] going to be subject to those thoughts
[1:39:50] where they're going to say hey you know
[1:39:52] what I understand now way different than
[1:39:55] when I did because the word of God says
[1:39:57] that when I was a child I thought as a
[1:39:59] child and I acted as a child but now
[1:40:02] that I'm a grown man I'm Sovereign in my
[1:40:05] life and I know that he is Lord over me
[1:40:08] and he is The Sovereign God I'm not
[1:40:10] going to allow myself to act like I used
[1:40:13] to as a
[1:40:16] child some of the biggest children are
[1:40:20] grown
[1:40:21] adults and I say Lord Lord help me
[1:40:24] because I've acted like a child but as
[1:40:27] we go forwards brothers and sisters
[1:40:29] there's no need to act like children
[1:40:31] there's no need to be afraid there's no
[1:40:33] need to worry there's no need to talk
[1:40:36] evil about other people there's no need
[1:40:39] to say mean things one to
[1:40:42] another all we need to do is just give
[1:40:44] him preeminence in our lives make sure
[1:40:47] that we're allowing him to live out
[1:40:49] through US recognizing that this is the
[1:40:51] Temple of the Holy Ghost right
[1:40:54] here and he's not going to allow his
[1:40:56] Temple to be defiled brothers and
[1:40:58] sisters when we want to go and defile
[1:40:59] these temples in whatever manner then
[1:41:02] he's not going to be there I say Lord
[1:41:04] help me I don't ever want to push him
[1:41:05] out but I know there's times where the
[1:41:07] Holy Ghost has just gone and flowing I'm
[1:41:10] so sorry to say this but I know in my
[1:41:11] life there's times where the Holy Ghost
[1:41:13] has done what the prophet said he'll
[1:41:14] just go and sit up in the tree there
[1:41:16] he'll just go and and be a little bit of
[1:41:17] ways away watching over me but still
[1:41:20] just saying you know what while you've
[1:41:21] got that walth nature you're not going
[1:41:23] to have my spirit and you need to get
[1:41:25] another spirit inside of you you need to
[1:41:27] calm yourself down you need to clean
[1:41:29] yourself out and when you do that then
[1:41:30] the Holy Ghost will come back the Holy
[1:41:32] Ghost will come back amen Gabriel's
[1:41:35] instructions to
[1:41:37] Daniel Daniel he made himself ready I
[1:41:40] think it's
[1:41:42] beautiful brother bradam says how that
[1:41:44] would warn the heart of any true prophet
[1:41:47] of God
[1:41:49] today that we look back and see what
[1:41:52] this true Prophet said said amen and
[1:41:54] know that we're at the end
[1:41:58] time he said I understood by books that
[1:42:02] Jeremiah my
[1:42:04] brother didn't make him a great one
[1:42:08] didn't make him someone that he wasn't
[1:42:10] didn't worship
[1:42:12] Him D Daniel saw Jeremiah as his
[1:42:18] brother he said I understood by books
[1:42:20] that Jeremiah my brother many many years
[1:42:22] ago prophesied that Israel would stay
[1:42:24] down here 70
[1:42:25] years and that time is about
[1:42:29] fulfilled isn't that beautiful and that
[1:42:32] time is about fulfilled take a look at
[1:42:35] our day brothers and sisters I want to
[1:42:37] say and that time is about
[1:42:40] fulfilled as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:42:45] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[1:42:47] of man yes sir and you know we have seen
[1:42:50] we have witnessed we have beheld the
[1:42:53] coming of the son of
[1:42:55] man don't wait for a worldly event some
[1:42:58] sort of pride thing to trigger you to
[1:43:01] get into Christ because if it doesn't do
[1:43:03] it by the preaching of the word brothers
[1:43:05] and sisters ain't nothing going to do
[1:43:08] it what we're going to do if we're
[1:43:10] waiting for an Earthly event maybe
[1:43:12] California is going to sink into the
[1:43:13] ocean and then we're going to get right
[1:43:15] with God maybe we're going to see
[1:43:16] something happen like that you know what
[1:43:18] happens is we're going to find ourselves
[1:43:20] with the mark of the beast and not even
[1:43:22] know it is what the prophet said because
[1:43:25] everything that's supposed to happen has
[1:43:26] happened the only thing the prophet saw
[1:43:29] left for the church is for the
[1:43:31] Rapture he said I understood by books
[1:43:34] that Jeremiah my brother many many years
[1:43:36] ago prophesied that Israel would stay
[1:43:38] down here 70 years and that time is
[1:43:41] about fulfilled and he made himself
[1:43:44] ready I just think that's beautiful we
[1:43:47] have every single reason to Rejoice
[1:43:49] brothers and sisters when we get into a
[1:43:51] church service whether it's preaching or
[1:43:53] or whether it's worship to rejoice and
[1:43:55] be very very glad because the marriage
[1:43:58] of the Lamb has come and what not his
[1:44:01] bride we heard it this morning not the
[1:44:03] bride but his wife has made herself
[1:44:06] ready that one who he knew who he had
[1:44:09] the relationship in an intimate fashion
[1:44:12] with she was no longer the bride there
[1:44:16] was no longer a veil over her head he
[1:44:18] had already taken the veil lifted it up
[1:44:20] and and kissed her and told told her
[1:44:23] that he loved her and took her veil and
[1:44:25] put it on his shoulder to signify that
[1:44:28] all the responsibility for her is his
[1:44:33] now brothers and sisters that's what
[1:44:36] happens in marriage when you take that
[1:44:39] bride all of the responsibility for that
[1:44:43] woman now is yours
[1:44:46] all of the responsibility for those
[1:44:49] children is yours you will stand before
[1:44:54] almighty God and give an account for how
[1:44:57] you managed your
[1:45:02] position he called a fast and he
[1:45:05] Sanctified himself and when ashes and
[1:45:08] Sack cloth and put it upon his head and
[1:45:12] went to fasting and
[1:45:14] praying he didn't just say oh well it's
[1:45:18] how it is I don't know what to
[1:45:21] do in captivity been here this
[1:45:24] long I don't know what's going to happen
[1:45:27] maybe we'll go back I'm already an old
[1:45:29] man maybe I won't get to see it now he
[1:45:31] didn't do that he didn't start moping
[1:45:33] around he didn't look at the natural
[1:45:34] circumstances other than he started to
[1:45:36] get ready he started to
[1:45:38] say Deliverance is near it's just about
[1:45:41] time brothers and sisters it's not a
[1:45:43] time to get weary in well-doing it's not
[1:45:45] a time to get tired of marching to the
[1:45:47] beat of this gospel it's time to
[1:45:50] actually be looking to see when the
[1:45:52] notes are going to change so that when
[1:45:54] our time to play is that we're able to
[1:45:56] be in time in step with the great
[1:45:59] Symphony that brother bradam talks about
[1:46:01] in that message uh talking about Peter
[1:46:03] and the Wolf but in Gabriel's
[1:46:05] instruction to Daniel he goes on to say
[1:46:07] and if Daniel the Prophet of the Lord
[1:46:10] could consult Jeremiah's books oh my and
[1:46:13] bring him to such a place that even
[1:46:16] Israel coming out all of them alive was
[1:46:20] coming out of Babylon to go back to the
[1:46:22] Homeland would cause him to fast with
[1:46:24] sackcloth and Ashes how much more ought
[1:46:28] it to do the Church of the Living God to
[1:46:32] know that time is fading out and shall
[1:46:35] be no more it just makes me think
[1:46:37] brothers and sisters I I can't see why
[1:46:39] we wouldn't have a prayer meeting on
[1:46:41] Thursday night recognizing that this is
[1:46:43] the books this is the prophecy that's in
[1:46:45] the books when we would have a Thursday
[1:46:47] night prayer meeting that the house
[1:46:48] wouldn't be full here of Believers
[1:46:50] saying hey we know that Deliverance is
[1:46:53] near we know that the son of man
[1:46:54] Ministry is already
[1:46:56] happened in fact it's still happening
[1:46:59] and I feel it right now now don't get me
[1:47:01] wrong we don't we don't dwell on
[1:47:03] feelings and emotions and there's a
[1:47:05] whole push in the word in the world
[1:47:08] today in the message to get caught up in
[1:47:11] emotions and feelings don't worry about
[1:47:13] that brothers and sisters just keep that
[1:47:15] word keep the word of God first in your
[1:47:17] life and that will be what we need
[1:47:20] that's the only thing that we need to
[1:47:22] try and say that I've seen a sign or a
[1:47:24] Wonder I've seen a healing I've seen a
[1:47:26] miracle in my life sure enough you will
[1:47:28] see them if you put that word first in
[1:47:30] your life but here's the trick if you
[1:47:34] put experiences first if you put
[1:47:37] something Supernatural happening in your
[1:47:39] life first in front of that word the
[1:47:41] devil can impersonate it the devil can
[1:47:45] impersonate every gift and what will
[1:47:48] happen is we'll say oh that's
[1:47:49] Supernatural experience but you know
[1:47:51] what sometimes the super natural
[1:47:53] experiences aren't exactly according to
[1:47:55] the word of God we know the prophet said
[1:47:57] it very clearly away with experiences as
[1:48:00] the plum line put that word of God first
[1:48:03] in our lives
[1:48:06] my that even Israel coming out all of
[1:48:10] them alive was coming out of Babylon to
[1:48:12] go back to the Homeland would cause him
[1:48:15] to fast with sackcloth and Ashes how
[1:48:18] much more ought it to do the Church of
[1:48:20] the Living God to know that the time is
[1:48:22] fading out and shall be no more and the
[1:48:25] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[1:48:28] great Millennium ready to set in how can
[1:48:33] we spend wasteless time gambling
[1:48:36] swimming hole on Sundays no time for the
[1:48:40] Lord just run down if the pastor speaks
[1:48:43] on something another that you don't like
[1:48:47] you get up and go
[1:48:50] out and if the church holds to
[1:48:53] long why you're dissatisfied my I had
[1:48:56] that roast in the oven and that guy just
[1:48:58] keeps going on my we had a guest speaker
[1:49:00] here and he went an hour longer oh my
[1:49:03] we're not used to that that's crazy talk
[1:49:05] how could we do that and then another
[1:49:07] Minister comes through and does it again
[1:49:09] oh my brothers and sisters where are we
[1:49:14] at don't want to get caught in ruts if
[1:49:17] you've ever driven on a road a 4x4 Road
[1:49:20] where there's ruts deep ruts or snow
[1:49:22] we've probably all experienced it where
[1:49:23] you get ruts that are deep so deep when
[1:49:26] you try to steer out of them when you're
[1:49:27] in mud or snow you can't get out of them
[1:49:29] you're stuck you can put your hands
[1:49:31] behind your head and you can actually
[1:49:33] just rest and just press on the gas and
[1:49:35] it'll just be like a train it'll just
[1:49:37] continue going you cannot get out of
[1:49:39] those ruts but blessed be the name of
[1:49:41] the Lord when we get in our spiritual
[1:49:43] ruts he is more than willing to just
[1:49:46] accept us and help us to get out of
[1:49:48] those ruts to shatter the Traditions I
[1:49:51] couldn't help but think it when when
[1:49:52] brother Cadre was was preaching on
[1:49:54] Wednesday isn't it interesting how they
[1:49:56] had all of their traditions and ideas in
[1:49:59] in the days of Jesus and when Jesus came
[1:50:02] what did he do he shattered all of their
[1:50:04] Traditions all of their reasoning all of
[1:50:06] their ways he shattered them and what
[1:50:08] happened a little bit later on in
[1:50:10] history 2,000 years later God sends a
[1:50:12] prophet hasn't been a prophet for
[1:50:14] thousands of years on the face of the
[1:50:16] Earth but here we have a prophet
[1:50:18] shattering the traditions of men all of
[1:50:21] the religious people shattering those
[1:50:23] Traditions it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:50:25] yesterday today and forever don't get
[1:50:27] stuck in Traditions brothers and sisters
[1:50:30] if you have traditions in your life make
[1:50:32] sure they line up with the word of God
[1:50:34] if they don't line up with the word of
[1:50:35] God throw them out just get rid of
[1:50:38] them but if the pastor speaks on
[1:50:41] something or other that you don't like
[1:50:42] you get up and go out if if the church
[1:50:44] holds too long while you're disatisfied
[1:50:47] look at your condition look what we're
[1:50:50] doing here we have him talking about
[1:50:53] this in
[1:50:55] 1961 back in Daniel's day they never
[1:50:58] even had a
[1:50:59] church isn't it interesting to think the
[1:51:02] one brother said that that job's problem
[1:51:06] job's problem originated in
[1:51:09] church we have to know where we stand
[1:51:12] brothers and
[1:51:13] sisters but don't let the church be your
[1:51:15] absolute and you know I think that's
[1:51:17] really why people get upset and leave
[1:51:19] that's why people get fussed is because
[1:51:21] they're putting their trust in man if
[1:51:24] you put your trust in God you know he's
[1:51:26] in complete control brothers and sisters
[1:51:28] don't you believe that you could
[1:51:29] actually pray to that God and have him
[1:51:31] change the heart of that preacher of
[1:51:33] that Pastor of that song leader of that
[1:51:35] Deacon of that brother the
[1:51:40] sister we've been given this
[1:51:41] encouragement to be a part of a
[1:51:45] body I just can't help but think why
[1:51:47] would we want to scorn that why would we
[1:51:49] want to spurn
[1:51:51] that first Thessalonians 5:18 and
[1:51:54] everything brothers and sisters give
[1:51:57] thanks
[1:51:58] everything and it's not everything as
[1:52:00] one
[1:52:02] word
[1:52:04] every everything that we do brothers and
[1:52:06] sisters everything that we think every
[1:52:08] experience that we go to Every Valley
[1:52:10] that we encounter every problem every
[1:52:14] really exceedingly hard trial that we
[1:52:16] encounter in our lives give
[1:52:19] thanks why why for this is the will of
[1:52:23] God in Christ
[1:52:26] Jesus because there ain't things that H
[1:52:30] we don't encounter things just by
[1:52:31] accident in our lives and the devil I
[1:52:33] think tries to get us to believe that
[1:52:36] well we caused this sometimes we do
[1:52:38] we'll step outside of the will of God in
[1:52:40] our lives but when you're genuine in
[1:52:42] your heart of hearts and you're really
[1:52:45] honest with yourself and you find
[1:52:47] yourself in a trial brothers and sisters
[1:52:49] God has allowed that trial to actually
[1:52:52] show
[1:52:53] everyone around to show all the spirits
[1:52:55] around all the principalities and powers
[1:52:57] that are trying to attack you who you
[1:52:59] are and most of all he's trying to show
[1:53:01] you who you are because when we go
[1:53:04] through these exceedingly hard trials
[1:53:06] it's showing us who we
[1:53:08] are how could we ever make it through
[1:53:10] some of the trials that we've gone
[1:53:12] through in our lives I I don't know
[1:53:14] Naturally Speaking there's no way that
[1:53:16] we should many times in a marriage
[1:53:18] there's things that happen where the
[1:53:20] world will just blow up in the marriage
[1:53:22] and that will be it for the marriage and
[1:53:24] the children grow up and they've got
[1:53:25] scars and now they're in a situation
[1:53:27] they don't know what it means to have a
[1:53:29] healthy marriage in their life and on
[1:53:31] and on and on it goes but something
[1:53:33] happens in the heart of a Believer we
[1:53:35] can go to the deepest darkest Realms on
[1:53:38] Earth in our marriages and God will
[1:53:41] still meet us there and he'll say to you
[1:53:44] just do this just do that and if we're
[1:53:47] willing to heed his call he will heal us
[1:53:51] and what happens is we lined up with a
[1:53:53] marriage that's way stronger than it
[1:53:55] ever could have been because we've gone
[1:53:56] right down to the foundation right down
[1:53:58] underneath the foundation right to the
[1:54:00] very core of who we are it's so
[1:54:03] beautiful I can't help but think Daniel
[1:54:05] went there many times in his life no
[1:54:08] church no Fellowship no friends no no
[1:54:13] joint assemblies maybe no no other
[1:54:16] message preachers anywhere he only had
[1:54:18] himself and maybe the couple other
[1:54:20] brothers that were there looking to him
[1:54:22] for instruction looking to him for
[1:54:23] encouragement he was the encouragement
[1:54:25] to the people out of Gabriel's
[1:54:28] instruction to Daniel brother Bram says
[1:54:30] compare our lives with that Prophet one
[1:54:32] man in a kingdom with no church to go to
[1:54:35] and nowhere else to go it was tore down
[1:54:38] and burned down his City his people was
[1:54:42] captive 68 years 69 70 he had two years
[1:54:47] left so when he began to read the book
[1:54:50] and see that the time was drawing night
[1:54:52] to be fulfilled be fulfilled he went to
[1:54:55] God In Prayer to find out about it
[1:54:57] brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:54:58] encourage us today you know we could
[1:55:01] leave this building and think my
[1:55:04] goodness the Rapture has taken place now
[1:55:06] we're already in
[1:55:08] glory but then maybe we had a little bit
[1:55:12] more worship that we could have
[1:55:14] gave we could look back and say you know
[1:55:16] what in that service there I I just had
[1:55:19] this thing in my heart this thing that
[1:55:20] happened that week and it just CAU
[1:55:22] caused me it just really has been
[1:55:24] bugging me and it just got in the way of
[1:55:26] My Worship my ability to worship God we
[1:55:29] don't want to look back from eternity
[1:55:30] and think there was a time where we just
[1:55:32] didn't give all that we've got brothers
[1:55:34] and sisters we might not have another
[1:55:36] service and would you want to look back
[1:55:38] and think that we could have gave more
[1:55:40] but we didn't it's a little bit like
[1:55:42] running a race if you've ever ran before
[1:55:44] when you get to the Finish Line you
[1:55:45] don't want to cross that Finish Line
[1:55:47] thinking you've got more energy you got
[1:55:49] you you could have gone faster you could
[1:55:52] have got a better time now nobody's
[1:55:54] going to get to heaven faster than
[1:55:56] anyone I'm not saying that what I am
[1:55:57] saying is God desires worship he is an
[1:56:00] object of worship and that's the only
[1:56:02] thing that he wants is our worship and
[1:56:05] Satan wants to be just like the most
[1:56:07] high and to keep us from worshiping him
[1:56:10] and get us to worship a god of our
[1:56:14] imagination but if we're willing to just
[1:56:16] strip the hide off ourselves and say I
[1:56:18] don't care about that problem this week
[1:56:19] I don't care about the problem next week
[1:56:21] I don't care about tomorrow or yesterday
[1:56:24] or anyone else around me I'm just going
[1:56:25] to give him the praise that he desires
[1:56:27] right now brothers and sisters he'll
[1:56:29] come down and he will minister to the
[1:56:31] very need in our lives Daniel recognized
[1:56:35] the time was short he recognized the
[1:56:37] time was near he knew that God's will
[1:56:40] was his word now I don't know if he ever
[1:56:42] had a prophet say it that way to him but
[1:56:44] something was on the inside of him that
[1:56:46] just took it that way and what did he do
[1:56:49] he put God first in every single
[1:56:52] situation of his
[1:56:55] life so I want to say today what are we
[1:56:58] doing it's not just me saying it the
[1:57:00] prophet I believe said it in this same
[1:57:04] message what a time what are we doing
[1:57:07] when nations are breaking the sea is
[1:57:09] roaring men's heart failing for fear
[1:57:12] perplexed of time all these things the
[1:57:15] handwriting on the wall the handwriting
[1:57:18] on the wall wasn't just belshazzar's
[1:57:20] Feast it was in Jeffersonville IND
[1:57:23] the handwriting was on the wall
[1:57:25] vindicating what this Prophet had said
[1:57:27] what this Prophet had drawn earlier in
[1:57:29] the day on a Blackboard God came down
[1:57:31] and said this is my beloved Son hear ye
[1:57:34] him listen to what this man is
[1:57:37] saying now don't get me wrong I'm not
[1:57:39] saying brother Brandon was Jesus Christ
[1:57:41] I'll say it about you if you have his
[1:57:43] spirit inside of you and you talk to
[1:57:45] people in this world I guarantee you
[1:57:47] that God will be saying the same thing
[1:57:50] this is my beloved Son here ye
[1:57:53] him we can't be anybody else but Jesus
[1:57:57] Christ if we've got his spirit inside of
[1:57:58] us brothers and sisters the devil wants
[1:58:00] to say no no no no no no no no no no you
[1:58:02] can be you yeah you just you just do you
[1:58:05] isn't that what's the common phrase you
[1:58:06] do you and I'll do me I'll just be
[1:58:09] myself and you just be yourself no
[1:58:12] that's the way of the
[1:58:13] world we just want to see Jesus Christ
[1:58:16] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:58:18] living out through our
[1:58:20] lives but but what are we doing what a
[1:58:23] time what are we doing when nations are
[1:58:25] breaking the sea is roaring men's heart
[1:58:27] failing for fear perplexed of time all
[1:58:30] these things we see the handwriting on
[1:58:31] the wall racial
[1:58:33] disintegration all kinds of evil going
[1:58:36] on in the
[1:58:38] world excuse me and fusses and fights
[1:58:41] and
[1:58:42] stews isn't it interesting fusses and
[1:58:45] fights and stews even in the message oh
[1:58:48] my fusses and fights and
[1:58:53] stews it's all the
[1:58:55] devil when you see that brothers and
[1:58:57] sisters that's the devil someone is
[1:59:00] giving place to the devil and the word
[1:59:02] of God says to not give place to the
[1:59:06] devil fusses fights and stews and
[1:59:10] weapons hanging in hangers that one
[1:59:12] little Nation by the size of Cuba down
[1:59:15] here can destroy the world in 10
[1:59:18] minutes and them fussing with one
[1:59:20] another ungodly man who knows not God
[1:59:23] and knows not his power and the Holy
[1:59:26] Spirit in the church moving amongst the
[1:59:29] elected showing himself alive after
[1:59:32] 2,000 years that he is the same
[1:59:34] yesterday today and forever how can we
[1:59:36] set slothfully how can we just run over
[1:59:39] the top of
[1:59:42] it time we were checking
[1:59:45] up watching for that great hour
[1:59:49] approaching I just think it's so
[1:59:51] beautiful
[1:59:54] maybe stand with me as we begin to close
[1:59:56] here I'll say stand so it'll keep me
[2:00:00] kind of honest with the
[2:00:02] closing out of expectations you know
[2:00:05] brother brandham he said I've got a
[2:00:07] right and I just can't help but think
[2:00:09] that wasn't just for the
[2:00:10] prophet that was for
[2:00:13] Daniel that was for
[2:00:15] Ezekiel that was for
[2:00:17] Jeremiah that's for the Bride of Jesus
[2:00:20] Christ brother BR himself says and
[2:00:23] listen the devil put us in the pawn
[2:00:27] shop back there from Adam's
[2:00:30] sin but Jesus came down and paid the
[2:00:33] pond
[2:00:34] bill so it's not going to be our good
[2:00:36] works and it's not going to be our good
[2:00:38] looks and it's not going to be our our
[2:00:39] good
[2:00:40] actions and things that we
[2:00:43] do God's already paid it all he's
[2:00:46] already done it
[2:00:48] all he's already paid the pond bill
[2:00:52] wrote it on the
[2:00:54] word and I got to write for it
[2:00:58] amen I just believe brothers and sisters
[2:01:00] I want to encourage us this week as we
[2:01:02] go forwards to remember this quote I've
[2:01:05] got a right for it amen Satan get back
[2:01:09] I've got a right for
[2:01:11] it may Brothers told me you can't get
[2:01:14] well and maybe you've got a doctor
[2:01:16] that's told you you can't get
[2:01:17] well maybe you've got a doctor that said
[2:01:20] you need this medication this is is the
[2:01:22] only way that you'll ever be able to be
[2:01:23] semi functional in this world because of
[2:01:25] depression if you have that that's a
[2:01:27] devil that's Satan that's his agent tell
[2:01:30] him to get back in the name of Jesus
[2:01:33] Christ maybe it's an illness in our
[2:01:37] body it's the devil tell them you got a
[2:01:41] right to it you've got a right to
[2:01:42] Healing get back in the name of Jesus
[2:01:45] Christ he said well you inherit it from
[2:01:47] your father maybe you got a temper like
[2:01:49] a buz saww oh my I inherited it it's the
[2:01:54] devil don't say those
[2:01:57] words tell them I got a right to peace
[2:01:59] and
[2:02:00] joy and so do the people around
[2:02:04] me you inherited it from your father you
[2:02:08] inherited peace and love and joy and
[2:02:11] longsuffering and
[2:02:13] gentleness from your father that's what
[2:02:16] you inherited from your father I say but
[2:02:18] my heavenly father redeemed me amen I'm
[2:02:21] out of the shop now amen so just move
[2:02:24] over Satan he said I'll just pull
[2:02:27] symptoms all around you watch when that
[2:02:30] happens that's what brother Bram said
[2:02:32] when the healing comes on the scene
[2:02:33] everything's going to get worse when
[2:02:35] you're truly getting healed it gets
[2:02:38] worse but you can tell him just get back
[2:02:42] I said stand around can you imagine that
[2:02:45] the prophet wasn't even tell him to get
[2:02:46] back now he's saying come on come to
[2:02:49] church with me and listen because I'm
[2:02:51] going to work worship and ain't nobody
[2:02:53] going to stop me from giving praise I'm
[2:02:55] going to worship when I'm throwing up
[2:02:57] I'm going to worship when my head
[2:02:59] doesn't even think straight because of
[2:03:01] the headache that's in me when I feel
[2:03:03] depression whatever it is I'm going to
[2:03:05] praise God I'm not going to let Satan
[2:03:07] have any room in my life and I said
[2:03:09] Satan stand around listen at me testify
[2:03:13] I'd like for you to hear me I said I'll
[2:03:16] testify that much harder I'll make it
[2:03:19] much more testimony if you want to hear
[2:03:21] praise God stick around a while you'll
[2:03:25] hear me I just kept praising God and
[2:03:27] made it so hot for him he had to flee
[2:03:29] just heard him brother Brandon makes a
[2:03:31] noise hitting his hands together scoot
[2:03:33] off his old sleo foot right down the
[2:03:35] street as hard as he could had to
[2:03:38] couldn't stand the
[2:03:40] praise when you hear brother brandom say
[2:03:42] you know what there'll come a time where
[2:03:44] the devil just won't even know what to
[2:03:45] do with you it's not going to be because
[2:03:46] you're sitting down with your arms
[2:03:48] folded just pressing play and listening
[2:03:50] to a tape and doing nothing it's it's
[2:03:51] going to be because you praise God it's
[2:03:53] going to be because you're willing to
[2:03:55] defy this flesh and all the
[2:03:57] circumstances around you even Satan
[2:03:59] himself and say I'm going to praise God
[2:04:02] and it's not going to be stopped by
[2:04:04] anything on this Earth nothing will
[2:04:06] stand between me and that
[2:04:10] word oh my the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:04:15] through the power of the Holy Ghost was
[2:04:18] burning him up amen and I just want to
[2:04:21] say today brother brothers and sisters
[2:04:22] if you're willing to actually just go
[2:04:24] beyond the pain you know there's a
[2:04:27] minister that has said it I don't know
[2:04:29] if I've ever said his name before in the
[2:04:31] past but he says it quite often don't
[2:04:32] waste the pain when we have pain
[2:04:35] recognize it brothers and sisters it's
[2:04:37] for a purpose it's not so that we just
[2:04:39] get slapped around it's so that we can
[2:04:41] learn a lesson we get pain for a purpose
[2:04:44] don't waste the
[2:04:46] pain take that pain and turn it into
[2:04:50] praise if anybody has ever exercised
[2:04:53] here you know what I mean yes you're not
[2:04:55] doing anything until you feel
[2:04:57] pain your muscles aren't going to grow
[2:05:00] you're not going to do anything
[2:05:01] different in your life until you start
[2:05:03] to feel pain but boy when you start to
[2:05:04] feel pain the next few days you feel
[2:05:06] that pain when you're stretching your
[2:05:08] muscles out you're like man yeah I

[2:05:12] yeah I feel that pain it's the same
[2:05:13] thing sis sisters and brothers when when

[2:05:18] feel pain the devil doesn't like it he's
[2:05:20] going to send more and more and more
[2:05:22] Temptations but you can just tell them
