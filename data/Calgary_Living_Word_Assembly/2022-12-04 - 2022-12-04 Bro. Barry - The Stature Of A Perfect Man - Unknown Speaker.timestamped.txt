[46:49] certainly an honor and a privilege to
[46:50] gather together again one more time the
[46:53] way that he's ordained
[46:54] we don't know how many more days we have
[46:56] like this
[46:58] to come together in honor of the
[47:00] Resurrection we have a few prayer
[47:02] requests we'd like to bring before the
[47:03] church this morning we'd like to
[47:05] remember sister Faye Panetta and her
[47:08] family
[47:09] over there in the Philippines her uncle
[47:11] passed away
[47:13] and I believe we prayed for him already
[47:15] but he's gone on to glory and the
[47:17] consolation for that situation is
[47:20] that apparently he was able to reconcile
[47:23] with the Lord
[47:24] I believe we saw the text message but
[47:26] what a tremendous testimony that is
[47:28] there's nothing greater in this world is
[47:31] there than to be able to reconcile with
[47:33] the Lord
[47:34] my goodness
[47:35] we can say we know the message of the
[47:37] hour but what good is it if we have not
[47:39] reconciled ourselves with the Lord
[47:43] we want to remember Sister face
[47:45] family
[47:47] thank the Lord for healing our bodies
[47:50] sister Michelle Livesey sister Shayla

[48:06] sister Shayla along with her with the
[48:08] cold
[48:09] I want to remember sister Tina sister
[48:11] Charmaine sister adidja
[48:14] brother Wilson Rory looking to be
[48:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:19] Christ
[48:21] there's never a shortage of things to
[48:22] pray for is there
[48:24] it's amazing how the devil will get in
[48:26] our way and make us think that there's
[48:28] nothing to pray for get us to the place
[48:30] where we just won't even want to pray
[48:32] but you know that's just the devil
[48:34] all we have to do is start thinking

[54:35] God bless you this morning thank you
[54:37] musicians once again for bringing of
[54:40] your gifts
[54:42] offering them to the Lord freely
[54:44] this morning I'd like to just preach a
[54:47] little hope that's okay if you could
[54:50] turn with me in your Bibles to Exodus
[54:54] Exodus 14.
[55:00] and then I'd like to read another
[55:02] scripture over in second Corinthians
[55:04] chapter 10.
[55:07] Exodus chapter 14.
[55:11] second Corinthians chapter 10.
[55:27] Exodus chapter 14.
[55:30] let's start reading with verse 19.
[55:34] of Exodus chapter 14.
[55:40] and the angel of God which went before
[55:43] the camp of Israel
[55:45] removed
[55:46] and went behind them
[55:49] and the pillar of the cloud went from
[55:52] before their face
[55:53] and stood behind them
[55:56] and it came between the camp of the
[55:58] Egyptians and the camp of Israel
[56:02] and it was a cloud and darkness to them
[56:06] but it gave light by night to these
[56:10] so that the one came not near the other
[56:13] all the night
[56:15] and Moses stretched out his hand over
[56:18] the sea
[56:19] and the Lord caused the sea to go back
[56:21] by a strong East Wind all that night
[56:25] and made the sea dry land
[56:27] and the waters were divided
[56:30] and the children of Israel went inside
[56:33] the midst of the sea
[56:35] upon the dry ground
[56:37] the waters were a wall unto them on
[56:40] their right hand and on their left
[56:43] and the Egyptians pursued and went after
[56:46] them to the midst of the sea even all
[56:49] Pharaoh's horses his chariots
[56:53] and his Horsemen
[56:55] and it came to pass
[56:57] in the morning watch
[57:00] the Lord looked unto the host of the
[57:03] Egyptians through the pillar of Fire
[57:05] and of the cloud
[57:07] and troubled the host of the Egyptians
[57:10] and took off their chariot wheels that
[57:13] they draved them heavily so that the
[57:15] Egyptians said let us flee from the face
[57:18] of Israel
[57:19] for the Lord fighteth for them against
[57:22] the Egyptians
[57:25] let's turn over to Second Corinthians
[57:30] second Corinthians chapter 10.
[57:47] second Corinthians chapter 10.
[57:51] verse 3.
[57:55] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[57:58] not war after the flesh
[58:02] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[58:04] carnal
[58:06] But Mighty through God
[58:07] to the pulling down of strong holds
[58:11] casting down imaginations and every High
[58:14] thing that exalteth itself against the
[58:16] knowledge of God and bringing into
[58:19] captivity every thought
[58:21] to The Obedience of Christ
[58:23] let's just bow one more time
[58:26] gracious Heavenly Father
[58:28] Lord Jesus even at this very moment
[58:31] Lord we pray that you would just help us
[58:33] to take every single thought into
[58:35] captivity
[58:37] unto The Obedience of you father
[58:40] Lord Jesus we pray that you would just
[58:42] help me to get out of the way I pray
[58:45] that you would stop any word that you
[58:46] don't want spoken father and that you
[58:48] would just open the well father and just
[58:51] allow a gusher to come this morning
[58:53] Father for the words that you want to
[58:55] hear Lord Jesus we've come to be fed
[58:58] we've come to meet with you and Lord we
[59:00] know that you always come when you're
[59:02] invited we know that your word declares
[59:04] where two or three are gathered together
[59:05] in your name that you're there in the
[59:07] midst and father if we haven't said it
[59:08] yet we declare this meeting in the name
[59:10] of Jesus Christ to know that you are
[59:13] here and father maybe it's just to every
[59:15] devil that wants to come around here and
[59:17] try and exalt itself against your word
[59:19] father but Lord Jesus we just we just
[59:21] quietly rebuke them in the name of Jesus
[59:24] Christ and we declare this time for you
[59:26] father Lord we ask that you would open
[59:28] this word that we've read father break
[59:30] it open to us fresh like the bread of
[59:32] life that you did to those disciples
[59:34] along the way father when they invited
[59:36] you in the evening time father you open
[59:38] their eyes father by opening the the
[59:40] bread by the prayer that you spoke
[59:42] father by the words that came out of
[59:44] your mouth you opened their eyes and
[59:45] father we pray this morning that you
[59:47] would just open our eyes father just a
[59:49] little bit further to you
[59:50] we just ask all these things now in
[59:52] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God
[59:55] bless you this morning you may be seated
[59:57] today
[1:00:00] I don't have really any announcements
[1:00:02] this morning I just
[1:00:04] felt inspired once again I just think
[1:00:06] it's wonderful the way the Lord leads us
[1:00:08] and certainly excited to see what he'll
[1:00:10] do today
[1:00:12] just want to welcome everyone in the
[1:00:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:15] there's no greater name
[1:00:17] in heaven or in Earth
[1:00:20] certainly a pleasure to be here I just I
[1:00:22] guess I feel a little nervous that's why
[1:00:24] I maybe I'm repeating myself it's kind
[1:00:26] of it's kind of fun because I recognize
[1:00:28] that presence and that's what makes me
[1:00:30] nervous and uh we just certainly are
[1:00:32] thankful that he's here today
[1:00:35] because I know he's got something he
[1:00:37] wants to say
[1:00:38] we just want to ask for prayer for the
[1:00:43] trip to the Philippines just keep your
[1:00:45] your prayers on sister Faye while she's
[1:00:47] over there and the family and brother
[1:00:49] Mervin who was leaving soon I believe he
[1:00:52] leaves on the 10th and uh the children
[1:00:55] will be going as well just a little bit
[1:00:57] after I can't remember the exact dates
[1:00:59] but brother miles will be going and then
[1:01:01] sister Lynn and then we'll be going over
[1:01:04] there to meet them as well but there's
[1:01:06] going to be many many services preached
[1:01:09] and the people in the Philippines have
[1:01:11] the word that we're coming and we just
[1:01:14] want to we just want to make sure that
[1:01:16] we're in tune with what the spirit has
[1:01:18] to say for the church
[1:01:19] so just remember brother Mervin
[1:01:22] and me and your prayers as we get ready
[1:01:24] to go over there and uh we'll just see
[1:01:26] what the Lord will have in store
[1:01:29] um we have a communion service on the
[1:01:31] 31st it's amazing how time flies we're
[1:01:34] already into December now
[1:01:36] and for those people who are around I
[1:01:38] know many will be traveling for
[1:01:39] Christmas and we'll just ask the the
[1:01:42] Lord for traveling mercies while you
[1:01:43] travel
[1:01:44] and pray that he brings you back safely
[1:01:46] at the appointed time
[1:01:49] um
[1:01:49] so yeah that's probably about it I'm
[1:01:52] sure there's going to be a few things
[1:01:53] going on do we know that there's a young
[1:01:55] people's uh this month there's going to
[1:01:58] be a caroling I believe at
[1:02:00] all folks home
[1:02:02] it's probably not the politically
[1:02:04] correct term for it so I apologize but I
[1:02:07] hope you know what I mean it's uh I
[1:02:10] guess what I've called it all my life
[1:02:11] and anyways there's going to be uh a
[1:02:14] carol singing for those who are
[1:02:16] interested and it's a beautiful thing
[1:02:18] because we know we have Christmas carols
[1:02:20] that are anointed they're not just uh
[1:02:24] they're not just songs that we sing that
[1:02:26] maybe would be about Christmas tree
[1:02:29] we're not going to go and sing O
[1:02:30] Christmas tree oh Christmas tree because
[1:02:33] we know that that's idol worship
[1:02:35] there's people that sing that song and
[1:02:37] that's not Christian there's nothing
[1:02:38] Christian at all in that song and and I
[1:02:40] trust that's not a song we're going to
[1:02:42] sing to the people we're going to sing
[1:02:43] hymns we're going to sing about the
[1:02:45] gospel we're going to sing about Jesus
[1:02:46] Christ because that's the true meaning
[1:02:48] of Christmas but we know all of
[1:02:51] Christmas is not what the world teaches
[1:02:52] about Christmas and this isn't a
[1:02:54] Christmas message I don't even know why
[1:02:55] I'm going here but I guess we're moving
[1:02:57] into the Christmas season and you know
[1:02:59] so many things about Christmas that's
[1:03:01] taught about Christmas is not the truth
[1:03:02] about Christmas Jesus was not born on
[1:03:05] the 25th we know that was a Roman
[1:03:06] Holiday that was implemented I believe
[1:03:09] back in the early early church by the
[1:03:12] Romans but we know Jesus was a type of
[1:03:14] the Lamb was born in the springtime is
[1:03:16] what the prophet said to us and uh
[1:03:19] anyways they're going to sing uh have a
[1:03:21] sing song and I think it'll be a
[1:03:23] wonderful time if you feel inclined by
[1:03:25] all means reach out and uh I'm sure it
[1:03:28] would be a blessing to have as many
[1:03:29] people come as as as
[1:03:31] possible so are you happy this morning
[1:03:37] sometimes I have to wonder
[1:03:39] you know many times I look at my
[1:03:41] position and I I wonder you know Lord
[1:03:43] why me
[1:03:44] um
[1:03:46] but I find myself here and the only
[1:03:48] thing that I can do is just follow the
[1:03:49] leadership of the Lord just like the
[1:03:51] children of Israel coming out of Egypt
[1:03:52] and and that's all we can do so I trust
[1:03:56] it's a blessing today we can just go
[1:03:57] forwards and you know I want to talk
[1:04:00] today brothers and sisters about
[1:04:01] strongholds and and this word out of out
[1:04:05] of
[1:04:05] second Corinthians chapter 10
[1:04:07] strongholds I always thought that it was
[1:04:09] one word a stronghold but it's not it's
[1:04:13] a strong hold it's two separate words
[1:04:15] out of second Corinthians chapter 10.
[1:04:20] verse 4.
[1:04:22] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:04:24] carnal
[1:04:25] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[1:04:28] down of strong
[1:04:31] holds
[1:04:33] and just to do what I always do I'm
[1:04:35] going to set the I guess the final scene
[1:04:38] for this message this morning and to
[1:04:40] recognize that you know brothers and
[1:04:41] sisters we live in the evening time
[1:04:43] going back to our scripture here that we
[1:04:46] read a little earlier out of Exodus
[1:04:48] chapter 14. you know this word that we
[1:04:51] preach it's Darkness to some just like
[1:04:53] it was to the children of Israel it was
[1:04:56] a light to them at night but it was
[1:04:58] Darkness to the Egyptians and you know
[1:05:00] what this is to the people who are
[1:05:02] actually in strongholds by devils in
[1:05:05] this world this message that we preach
[1:05:07] this word that we love what we believe
[1:05:09] every fiber of our body is a Darkness to
[1:05:12] these people and you might say brother
[1:05:14] Barry we're the light of the world and
[1:05:15] we are the light of the world but you
[1:05:17] know what it's it's it's just blinding
[1:05:20] to some people because they could never
[1:05:21] ever hear this gospel that we preach if
[1:05:24] you say don't cut your hair to someone
[1:05:27] who is worldly they'll they'll say
[1:05:29] you're crazy that was a cultural thing
[1:05:30] don't wear pants look at the entire
[1:05:32] world the whole whole world is under the
[1:05:34] sway of that influence and then my
[1:05:36] goodness if you want to get into the
[1:05:38] trinitarian discussion and say you know
[1:05:40] what under until what have you been
[1:05:42] baptized and they'll say well in the
[1:05:44] name of the Father the Son the Holy
[1:05:45] Ghost you say that's just titles you
[1:05:46] haven't been baptized at all you've got
[1:05:48] to be baptized in Christian baptism
[1:05:49] they're going to say you're crazy but
[1:05:52] you know what it is brothers and sisters
[1:05:53] it's a strong hold of a devil in their
[1:05:56] lives and they don't even know it
[1:05:58] but you know what that does
[1:06:00] is it humbles us as Believers it's
[1:06:02] humbling to recognize that we can see
[1:06:04] this because the whole entire world
[1:06:07] can't see it out of now now it's over 8
[1:06:10] billion people in the world it's not
[1:06:13] even seven point whatever like we talked
[1:06:15] about probably the last time I said it
[1:06:16] maybe last year or early this year it's
[1:06:19] over 8 billion people in the world how
[1:06:21] many people have an ear to hear what the
[1:06:23] spirit saith unto the church in our day
[1:06:28] you know as I find myself in this
[1:06:30] situation I just I just want to read a
[1:06:32] quote here and I'm sorry or or
[1:06:36] you're welcome depending on how you look
[1:06:38] at it some people like quotes and some
[1:06:40] people don't I got some quotes today
[1:06:42] but you know that's what we base all
[1:06:44] that we believe on brothers and sisters
[1:06:46] it truly is it's up upon the message of
[1:06:48] the hour that's the only thing that's
[1:06:49] going to save us today because the
[1:06:51] message of the hour points the direct
[1:06:53] Avenue it's the key to unlock the door
[1:06:55] to get to Jesus Christ to be able to be
[1:06:58] perfect as he said be ye therefore
[1:07:00] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[1:07:02] perfect there has to be an Avenue for us
[1:07:04] to be perfect and every single age was
[1:07:06] given an Avenue and this age is no
[1:07:08] different and this is the way this is
[1:07:11] the Avenue for us
[1:07:13] out of you must be born again I think
[1:07:15] the title is perfect because that really
[1:07:17] would be if I had to have a subtitle
[1:07:19] that's it for today brothers and sisters
[1:07:20] you must be born again and and everyone
[1:07:22] would say well brother I am well I know
[1:07:25] we are but sometimes we just need a
[1:07:27] little stirring up a little stirring up
[1:07:29] our Pure Minds by way of remembrance
[1:07:33] talking about a pastor and his role so
[1:07:36] you kind of understand my perspective
[1:07:38] with this brother Branham says in this
[1:07:40] message out of you must be born again
[1:07:42] and there's known in the Western
[1:07:44] countries a weed
[1:07:46] that an animal can eat
[1:07:48] it's called Loco weed
[1:07:50] I don't know whether anybody ever heard
[1:07:52] of it or not a loco weed yes a horse can
[1:07:56] eat that
[1:07:58] and you just can't do nothing with them
[1:08:00] he just becomes an outlaw
[1:08:02] you can't put a saddle on him
[1:08:04] you can't do nothing with him it's
[1:08:07] called Loco weed
[1:08:09] and you must keep your stock away from
[1:08:11] that weed
[1:08:13] and if it'll cause a horse to eat
[1:08:15] something if a horse rather it'll eat
[1:08:18] something that throws him into this
[1:08:20] condition into this spasm why you would
[1:08:24] be a very poor Cowboy to let your horse
[1:08:26] eat a weed local weed it shows that you
[1:08:30] don't care
[1:08:33] he says and a real pastor
[1:08:35] a real servant of Christ
[1:08:38] will be a poor example of Christ to see
[1:08:41] the sheep eat something that's going to
[1:08:43] drive him away
[1:08:45] or make him an outlaw before God a
[1:08:49] breaker of his word
[1:08:51] a breaker of his Commandments
[1:08:53] you shouldn't do that
[1:08:56] he says you should watch that very
[1:08:58] closely
[1:09:01] so just to set a background for today
[1:09:03] brothers and sisters you must be born
[1:09:06] again
[1:09:08] let's take a look at strongholds let's
[1:09:10] tear down strongholds but you know how
[1:09:13] we've got to do that I believe with all
[1:09:15] my heart brothers and sisters has
[1:09:16] changed our perspective
[1:09:19] change our perspective sometimes we can
[1:09:21] look at things in our lives and say well
[1:09:23] it's just normal
[1:09:24] it's just normal it's just the way that
[1:09:26] we do things and you know what many
[1:09:28] times we can become comfortable with it
[1:09:30] look at the children of Israel that
[1:09:32] generation that was raised up in Egypt
[1:09:34] in bondage they probably said this is
[1:09:37] normal it's not fun but it's just all
[1:09:39] we've ever known we haven't known
[1:09:40] anything else besides the the Master's
[1:09:43] Whip and so long as we perform for them
[1:09:45] and work really hard we get good food
[1:09:47] and we get good accommodations
[1:09:48] everything is looked after in our lives
[1:09:51] sometimes we can get under bondage in
[1:09:53] our lives and say you know what I'm just
[1:09:55] willing to accept this bondage in my
[1:09:57] lives in my life and you know it's just
[1:10:00] what God has appointed me so I'm just
[1:10:02] going to March forward with this bondage
[1:10:04] you know if it's bondage brothers and
[1:10:05] sisters if it's contrary to the word of
[1:10:07] God it's bondage and you don't have to
[1:10:09] accept it we don't have to tolerate it
[1:10:11] in our lives it's a devil that's trying
[1:10:14] to have a strong hold in our lives
[1:10:17] and he doesn't have to have a stronghold
[1:10:19] and you know the word stronghold can be
[1:10:21] used two ways one is to actually have a
[1:10:24] strong grip a stronghold you're holding
[1:10:26] on very strong another one is the castle
[1:10:29] a fortified
[1:10:31] building a place where you're safe a
[1:10:35] stronghold and we don't want a devil to
[1:10:37] have either one of those in our lives do
[1:10:39] we not one of us
[1:10:41] so we got to be careful what we're
[1:10:43] feeding on
[1:10:44] because you are what you eat
[1:10:47] and you know we can say brother Barry
[1:10:49] you know I eat the best of foods it's
[1:10:50] all organic
[1:10:52] and sometimes we do and I know really
[1:10:55] Ken he used to preach it many times he
[1:10:58] would say we can eat the best of foods
[1:11:00] and brother Branham even says it too but
[1:11:02] we'll poke anything down our throats
[1:11:05] we got to be careful
[1:11:07] that was probably a hybrid of what
[1:11:09] brother Ken would say and what brother
[1:11:10] Bradham said but you know if we go to
[1:11:12] McDonald's and eat at McDonald's guess
[1:11:14] what's going to happen if we keep eating
[1:11:16] there we're going to get unhealthy if we
[1:11:17] only eat fast food but if we actually
[1:11:20] exercise we want to have some strong
[1:11:22] meat why do we want strong meat because
[1:11:24] there's protein in it and that helps
[1:11:26] heal the cells in our bodies it helps us
[1:11:28] grow and it's the same thing with the
[1:11:30] word of God we've got to be willing to
[1:11:32] eat strong meat of the word and not not
[1:11:35] worry about eating fast food you know
[1:11:37] what I just come to church once or twice
[1:11:39] a week and I just say God bless you and
[1:11:40] I just have a 15-minute prayer session
[1:11:42] and a little bit of song and and say
[1:11:44] Amen once or twice and then I go home
[1:11:46] and I'm good for the week brothers and
[1:11:47] sisters that fast food will kill you
[1:11:50] we've got to be coming to church
[1:11:51] prepared
[1:11:53] we've got to come to church with our
[1:11:54] hearts ready to hear the word of God
[1:11:58] not just have the song leader struggle
[1:12:00] to try and till the soil and the hearts
[1:12:03] of the people to shake off all of the
[1:12:04] cares of this life
[1:12:10] we don't want to eat local weed
[1:12:12] it can make us in trouble it could make
[1:12:14] us sick you know one of the worst things
[1:12:16] that can happen is for us to get
[1:12:17] spiritually sick one thing to get sick
[1:12:19] in our bodies because we can say God's
[1:12:20] our healer and we know that we've been
[1:12:22] healed before in the past and he'll come
[1:12:23] and do it again but when we get
[1:12:25] spiritually sick brothers and sisters we
[1:12:26] don't necessarily see it we can be blind
[1:12:29] to that and say you know what everything
[1:12:30] is fine in my life I'm healthy my bank
[1:12:32] account's full I got a great house I've
[1:12:34] got a perfect family everything is going
[1:12:36] on just fine the church is great
[1:12:38] everything is fine but spiritually sick
[1:12:41] and not even know it
[1:12:45] out of questions and answers brother
[1:12:47] Bradham
[1:12:50] he says let's see
[1:12:52] do you believe this is a question given
[1:12:54] to brother Brown he's reading it here do
[1:12:56] you believe that God gives the Holy
[1:12:58] Spirit to everyone that is truly born
[1:13:00] again Christian at the time they accept
[1:13:02] salvation or do you believe that this is
[1:13:07] a different work of Grace that in the
[1:13:10] experience of most Christians comes
[1:13:12] later
[1:13:13] please clarify this subject as many are
[1:13:17] confused because of the different
[1:13:19] teaching on this subject
[1:13:23] now if I don't answer this correctly
[1:13:24] well then you ask me I'll put it on my
[1:13:27] desk for tonight and then I'll get a
[1:13:29] hold of it
[1:13:31] he says now Christian friend
[1:13:34] a person cannot be born again until they
[1:13:38] have received the Holy Spirit
[1:13:41] see
[1:13:42] you can't
[1:13:43] you are not even converted until you
[1:13:47] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:13:49] if you ever wonder why brother Barry
[1:13:51] harps on the Holy Ghost that's why
[1:13:55] and I think it's a beautiful beautiful
[1:13:57] discussion today because brothers and
[1:13:59] sisters we're not talking about working
[1:14:01] our way up into something and many times
[1:14:03] I think we can look at the stature of a
[1:14:06] perfect man and think that you know I'm
[1:14:08] going to add to my my faith virtue and
[1:14:10] I'm going to add to my virtue knowledge
[1:14:11] and I'm going to add to my knowledge
[1:14:13] Temperance and I'm going to add to that
[1:14:15] and I'm going to add to that and before
[1:14:16] long I'm going to have worked my way to
[1:14:18] a place where I'm actually going to get
[1:14:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:14:23] think that's the case I don't think
[1:14:25] brother Branham says that's the case
[1:14:26] either
[1:14:27] he says we get it all together
[1:14:30] and you know what if you want a just
[1:14:32] simple example of that if you're a son
[1:14:34] today you always were a son even yet
[1:14:36] while you were dead and sins and
[1:14:38] trespasses in this flesh you already
[1:14:41] were a son or a daughter of God you just
[1:14:43] didn't know it
[1:14:45] that's what the new birth is God
[1:14:46] revealing himself personally to the
[1:14:49] individual
[1:14:51] but don't think that we're going to work
[1:14:53] our way into the Holy Ghost we're not
[1:14:54] just going to exercise and come to
[1:14:57] church and go home and read our Bibles
[1:14:59] and pray and suddenly one day we're just
[1:15:00] going to have the Holy Ghost because
[1:15:01] we've done enough works no it's when we
[1:15:04] open our heart to God and when we go on
[1:15:06] our knees and we pray from the innermost
[1:15:08] Parts when we say Lord there's no doors
[1:15:11] inside a door here every single door in
[1:15:13] the heart of this person is wide open
[1:15:15] unto you and just be it unto me
[1:15:17] according to Thy word and when he comes
[1:15:19] into you you'll have that spiritual
[1:15:22] connection that spiritual connection
[1:15:24] conception will take place that word
[1:15:27] will hit the seed Gene of God that he
[1:15:29] placed before the foundation of the
[1:15:30] world in that little space that he's
[1:15:32] made in the human heart and when that
[1:15:34] happens the life that comes forward
[1:15:36] inside the individual will only be one
[1:15:38] life
[1:15:39] it won't be our life plus his or his
[1:15:42] life plus ours it will just be his
[1:15:45] just his only Jesus Christ just like it
[1:15:49] was in Mary brother Adam says no if I
[1:15:51] don't answer this correctly well then
[1:15:52] you ask me I'll put it on my desk for
[1:15:54] tonight I'll get a hold of it now
[1:15:56] Christian friend a person cannot be born
[1:15:57] again until they have received the Holy
[1:15:59] Spirit see you can't you are not even
[1:16:02] converted until you receive the Holy
[1:16:04] Ghost
[1:16:05] now I just want to say this I'm not
[1:16:07] saying this to discourage anybody I'm
[1:16:09] saying this to encourage all of us to
[1:16:11] recognize that the work of Grace it's
[1:16:14] already done all we have to do is accept
[1:16:15] it if we're willing to accept it
[1:16:18] according to the word for our day then
[1:16:19] you've got it all right now Brothers and
[1:16:21] Sisters You've got it all it's already
[1:16:23] there
[1:16:25] I'm not say you're lost before you
[1:16:27] receive the Holy Ghost because you're
[1:16:28] not
[1:16:30] there's three there's one work of Grace
[1:16:31] only one work of Grace that's the Holy
[1:16:34] Spirit and and it's made in three
[1:16:37] manifestations just like there's one God
[1:16:39] made in three manifestations father son
[1:16:42] Holy Spirit one God one only one now
[1:16:45] there's three works of Grace but three
[1:16:48] manifestations there's a manifestation
[1:16:50] of justification by faith
[1:16:53] a man believes God says yes sir I
[1:16:56] believe that I believe there's a true
[1:16:58] God and now for my personal savior I
[1:17:01] accept Jesus Christ his son as my
[1:17:04] personal savior
[1:17:05] now that's what's called justification
[1:17:07] by faith and that's what the disciples
[1:17:09] receive first
[1:17:12] it's a long quote I know it you're
[1:17:14] probably wondering brother Barry where
[1:17:16] are you going we all know this what I
[1:17:17] want to do is get right to where the
[1:17:19] rubber meets the road today brothers and
[1:17:20] sisters and talk about strongholds in
[1:17:22] our lives and recognize that this work
[1:17:25] of Grace it's all encompassing it's
[1:17:27] completely overshadowing all of the
[1:17:29] cares of this world and all the life
[1:17:31] problems that we think we have if we can
[1:17:34] change our perspective we can change our
[1:17:36] perception of this life that we live and
[1:17:39] look at it through the lens of God I
[1:17:41] think we can probably see maybe just a
[1:17:43] uh maybe a little easier time in our
[1:17:45] lives and that's what I would really
[1:17:47] like to see is just a bit of
[1:17:48] encouragement in our lives to just look
[1:17:50] at things a little bit differently to
[1:17:51] recognize that when you're looking at
[1:17:53] something brothers and sisters if you're
[1:17:54] truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it's
[1:17:56] not you that's looking it's God that's
[1:17:57] looking at it and this is kind of the
[1:17:59] punch line that I wanted to get at you
[1:18:00] know we we read the scripture out of
[1:18:02] Exodus chapter 14 and it came to pass
[1:18:05] that in the morning watch the Lord
[1:18:07] looked unto the host of the Egyptians
[1:18:09] through the pillar of fire and of the
[1:18:11] cloud and today brothers and sisters we
[1:18:14] talk about the pillar of fire and we
[1:18:16] talk about the cloud but what if we stop
[1:18:18] looking at the pillar of fire and
[1:18:20] looking at the cloud and start looking
[1:18:21] at our lives through the pillar of fire
[1:18:24] and through the cloud take a step and
[1:18:26] put ourselves in the pillar of Fire and
[1:18:28] Put ourselves in that cloud that
[1:18:30] happened on 1963 and recognize that it's
[1:18:33] God's work his own life that we're
[1:18:35] living out through our lives it's not us
[1:18:38] living Our Lives thinking we're going to
[1:18:39] and fro working better getting better
[1:18:41] careers and nicer houses and better cars
[1:18:44] and all the clothes and everything that
[1:18:45] we do in our lives we're manifesting
[1:18:48] Christ here on Earth that's what this
[1:18:49] age is doing brothers and sisters
[1:18:53] brother Branham goes on to say no the
[1:18:55] next thing this man will go out
[1:18:57] and today he might Smoke Drink curse do
[1:19:02] things that his habits is hanging on to
[1:19:05] him
[1:19:06] it's just rooted in there
[1:19:08] it's spirits
[1:19:10] habits are spirits
[1:19:14] I'm just going to pause there and say
[1:19:16] that habits are spirits if we've got
[1:19:19] habits in our lives brothers and sisters
[1:19:22] are they edifying to your body
[1:19:25] spiritually and naturally if they're not
[1:19:28] they're an evil spirit
[1:19:31] we need to just pause there and
[1:19:33] recognize that we're either for God or
[1:19:36] we're for the world and we know that
[1:19:37] Jesus said you can't serve God and
[1:19:40] Mammon together you can only serve one
[1:19:42] and if you serve one you'll hate the
[1:19:44] other
[1:19:45] we need to make sure that if we've got a
[1:19:47] habit in our life that it is edifying to
[1:19:50] your body spiritually and physically
[1:19:53] now the next thing this man will go out
[1:19:55] today he might Smoke Drink curse do
[1:19:57] things his habits is just hanging on to
[1:19:59] him it's rooted in there
[1:20:02] it's a strong hold in his life and you
[1:20:05] know brothers and sisters preaching to
[1:20:07] the choir here I'm preaching to me I
[1:20:08] recognize this there's things in my life
[1:20:10] where Satan has had strongholds on but
[1:20:13] you know what there's a way out there is
[1:20:15] an escape from strongholds there is an
[1:20:17] escape from these things that the devil
[1:20:19] wants to try and say no it's just a
[1:20:21] genetic to default it's from another
[1:20:23] generation you just have to serve that
[1:20:25] Master you just have to accept what he's
[1:20:26] done your grandfather did it so it's
[1:20:28] just something you have to take you
[1:20:29] don't have to take it you can tell him
[1:20:31] no I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:20:33] Christ and I overcome you by the blood
[1:20:35] of the lamb and by my testimony of the
[1:20:37] word that I believe for my day
[1:20:41] he might do things his habits just
[1:20:43] hanging on to him it's rooted in there
[1:20:45] it's Spirits habits are spirits
[1:20:49] the Bible said they're unclean spirits
[1:20:51] in men
[1:20:54] now
[1:20:55] he was maybe he's lustful
[1:20:58] brother speaking here he says excuse
[1:21:00] this we're a mixed audience and I say it
[1:21:02] this morning excuse this we're a mixed
[1:21:04] audience brother Branham says but we're
[1:21:06] we're standing in the Judgment House of
[1:21:09] God see and we must say these things
[1:21:11] clear
[1:21:13] for instance men sometimes especially
[1:21:16] men become lustful
[1:21:19] sex maniac
[1:21:21] and not only that but just lustful
[1:21:25] the way women dress in things today no
[1:21:27] wonder they are
[1:21:29] but and if the woman becomes the same
[1:21:32] way
[1:21:34] lustful Spirits get on them
[1:21:37] he says in their nice little ladies
[1:21:40] and then he put on
[1:21:42] short clothes
[1:21:44] and little bitty things around them
[1:21:46] which looks terrible they get out why
[1:21:49] they don't want to be bad
[1:21:52] but they don't realize
[1:21:54] that old-fashioned demon spirit is
[1:21:57] working on them
[1:21:58] and brothers and sisters if we just
[1:22:00] pause there how many people in this
[1:22:02] world have an old passion demon Spirit
[1:22:05] working on them
[1:22:07] we can't look at a magazine we can't
[1:22:09] look at a billboard doesn't matter what
[1:22:11] is being advertised they're using a
[1:22:13] woman to to capture the attention to say
[1:22:15] look at look it it's it's a it's a
[1:22:17] bathtub
[1:22:18] or it's a toilet or it's a car or it's a
[1:22:22] house or it's a festival whatever it is
[1:22:24] they're trying to use a woman to capture
[1:22:26] the attention of humans
[1:22:30] they don't realize that it's an
[1:22:31] old-fashioned demon Spirit that's
[1:22:34] working on them
[1:22:37] he says they don't do that to appear
[1:22:39] before God
[1:22:40] they do it not to be cool because pure
[1:22:43] science proves you that you take your
[1:22:45] clothes off the hot air on your body is
[1:22:47] more harder to you than what it is when
[1:22:49] you got your clothes on
[1:22:52] he says the Indian girls in Arizona are
[1:22:55] beautiful a lot more than what you see
[1:22:57] one of these nudes
[1:22:59] and she don't only put her clothes on
[1:23:01] but a big blanket around her when she
[1:23:03] walks across the desert to keep cool on
[1:23:05] perspiration when the heat comes up then
[1:23:08] then it's air conditioning see so it's
[1:23:10] it's nothing in the world but a lust
[1:23:12] passion spirit
[1:23:15] he says maybe you're lady enough not to
[1:23:18] do anything wrong
[1:23:19] to live untrue to your husband
[1:23:21] or to your own morals but my sister
[1:23:23] that's disgraceful and you don't realize
[1:23:26] if you could look in God's looking glass
[1:23:28] here and find out what God said about
[1:23:31] that it's an evil spirit that's on you
[1:23:33] and you don't realize it
[1:23:37] I just can't help but think brothers and
[1:23:39] sisters sometimes in our lives we can
[1:23:41] have an influence and not recognize
[1:23:43] where that influence comes from
[1:23:45] brother Branham calls it out very
[1:23:47] clearly here if we have that desire a
[1:23:49] sister to represent any part of our body
[1:23:52] that's untowards
[1:23:54] brother Brown I'm just clarified what
[1:23:56] kind of spirit it is the same thing with
[1:23:58] the brothers if we're wanting to to show
[1:24:00] our bodies off for any reason Brothers
[1:24:02] there's only one reason it's because of
[1:24:05] that Spirit that's on us and you know
[1:24:07] what we need to make sure that we have
[1:24:09] one Spirit on us and that's the Holy
[1:24:11] Spirit and when we have the Holy Spirit
[1:24:13] we're going to recognize these things
[1:24:15] and you know sometimes in our lives
[1:24:17] brothers and sisters this is why I'm
[1:24:18] saying this sometimes in our lives we
[1:24:20] don't even recognize that we have this
[1:24:22] hanging on to us but what happens is we
[1:24:24] go to church and we hear some preaching
[1:24:25] and something says to us in our heart
[1:24:27] hey wait a second have I done that hey
[1:24:30] wait a second have I seen that what's
[1:24:32] going on in my life and you know what we
[1:24:33] shake our heads and we say whoa and
[1:24:36] that's the moment that we have the
[1:24:37] opportunity to say be it unto me
[1:24:39] according to Thy word Lord Heal My Soul
[1:24:41] or step back and get worse and that's
[1:24:45] what we're faced with in this hour
[1:24:46] brothers and sisters there's no middle
[1:24:48] ground to just stay neutral about it
[1:24:51] he goes on to say Mary Magdalene didn't
[1:24:53] realize the spirits that was on her see
[1:24:55] well now when you get that kind of
[1:24:57] spirit on you or men you get out here
[1:25:00] and start lusting for women it's you say
[1:25:03] well it's Human Nature
[1:25:06] he says not like that
[1:25:08] not like that
[1:25:10] Brothers if we've got that problem in
[1:25:12] our lives that's not according to the
[1:25:14] word
[1:25:15] that's an evil spirit that's on us and
[1:25:18] we need to recognize it
[1:25:20] we can't blame it on our wives and say
[1:25:22] oh it's your fault
[1:25:24] can you imagine that standing before God
[1:25:26] and saying that daughter of God that you
[1:25:28] gave me that daughter of yours you gave
[1:25:30] her to me
[1:25:32] and it's her fault
[1:25:36] Mary Magdalene didn't realize the
[1:25:38] spirits that was on her see well now
[1:25:39] would you get that kind of spirit on you
[1:25:41] or men you get out here and start
[1:25:42] lusting for women you say well it's
[1:25:44] human nature not like that see he says
[1:25:46] no it's a spirit the Bible said it was a
[1:25:49] spirit that's right so the thing to do
[1:25:51] then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:25:54] you from lust and passion
[1:25:57] he says it's called sanctification
[1:26:00] the word sanctification means to be
[1:26:02] cleaned and set aside for service
[1:26:05] you get what I'm
[1:26:07] he says now that lust Spirit leaves you
[1:26:09] under sanctification
[1:26:12] Brothers
[1:26:13] sisters anyone if you're dealing with
[1:26:15] Allah spirit
[1:26:17] you're still being Sanctified there's
[1:26:18] still something trying to cleanse you
[1:26:20] out that spirit's got to go
[1:26:23] and you know what I've heard it said
[1:26:24] I'll say it this way the way I've heard
[1:26:26] it said and forgive me for it I know
[1:26:27] we're in a mixed audience starve it out
[1:26:30] that's what we got to do brothers and
[1:26:31] sisters starve it out you know if we're
[1:26:34] dealing with a spirit in a certain way
[1:26:36] in our lives regardless if it's Allah
[1:26:38] Spirit if it's a music Spirit starve it
[1:26:40] out if it's a social media Spirit starve
[1:26:43] it out the only way you're going to get
[1:26:45] rid of it if it's a smoking Spirit stop
[1:26:47] it drinking stop it if you keep going
[1:26:51] around that and being influenced by it
[1:26:52] you're feeding it
[1:26:57] spirit
[1:26:59] the Bible said it was a spirit that's
[1:27:02] right so the thing to do then the blood
[1:27:04] of Jesus Christ cleanses you from lust
[1:27:06] and passion called sanctification the
[1:27:07] word sanctification means to be cleaned
[1:27:09] out set aside for service
[1:27:11] and what service service for the king
[1:27:14] service to be filled with his holy ghost
[1:27:16] service to be the literal manifestation
[1:27:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ in Flesh on
[1:27:22] Earth before the Rapture of the church
[1:27:26] that's brother Barry's words
[1:27:29] he says let a little nice little lady
[1:27:31] nice goes to church he sings in the
[1:27:34] choir but she has to mow her grass with
[1:27:36] a little pair of shorts on
[1:27:38] let her get Sanctified one time
[1:27:41] and let her put on a Piercy
[1:27:43] let that man
[1:27:45] that'll almost have a wreck looking at
[1:27:47] that woman in the yard
[1:27:49] and let him get Sanctified one time
[1:27:52] and go down the street
[1:27:54] he'll keep his mind on exactly what he's
[1:27:56] doing that's exactly right
[1:27:58] if he gazes sideways he'll turn his head
[1:28:02] this way the holy spirit says turn your
[1:28:04] head that's it see there you are see
[1:28:07] that's right that's sanctification
[1:28:10] that's out of questions and answers the
[1:28:12] law having a shadow
[1:28:13] 1954 brother Branham
[1:28:17] brothers and sisters we're dealing with
[1:28:19] strongholds in our lives we're dealing
[1:28:21] with strongholds that want to get in our
[1:28:23] children's lives we're dealing with
[1:28:24] strongholds that want to get inside the
[1:28:26] church we're dealing with strongholds
[1:28:28] and you know what they are they're
[1:28:30] Devils they're Devils that want to get
[1:28:32] in our lives and mix us up and say no
[1:28:34] you've got this problem you've just got
[1:28:36] this thing you don't you can't get rid
[1:28:38] of it you're never going to get you're
[1:28:39] never going to outgrow it yes you will
[1:28:41] I'm here to say yes you will
[1:28:43] I'm not here to say you're going to be
[1:28:45] overcome you're going to be an overcomer
[1:28:47] you're gonna go and sit with him in his
[1:28:49] throne but the only way you're going to
[1:28:50] do that is to have a contrite spirit
[1:28:52] brothers and sisters you know what's
[1:28:54] going to keep you from actually being
[1:28:55] able to do that to be able to overcome
[1:28:57] what's going to stop the church from
[1:28:58] being able to overcome you'll never be
[1:29:00] able to stop completely if you truly are
[1:29:02] a son and daughter of God but you know
[1:29:04] what will happen you can have pride in
[1:29:06] your life Pride will keep you from
[1:29:07] saying nope I don't have that problem
[1:29:09] nope I don't have a problem you know
[1:29:11] what brothers and sisters the word of
[1:29:12] God says to confess your faults one to
[1:29:14] another to pray for one another that you
[1:29:16] may be healed if you're dealing with
[1:29:18] something in your life you're not healed
[1:29:19] from maybe just try taking the word of
[1:29:21] God and just pour a little bit of into
[1:29:22] your life and say oh my I'm going to
[1:29:25] find someone I've got confidence in you
[1:29:26] know what if it's a husband you got a
[1:29:28] wife if you're a wife and you've got a
[1:29:30] husband they're the ones you can trust
[1:29:31] man pour it out to them tell them we
[1:29:34] heard it said at the The Men's breakfast
[1:29:35] our husband or our wife is God's Divine
[1:29:38] portion for us if we can't trust them
[1:29:40] who can we trust
[1:29:44] if you feel uncomfortable that way find
[1:29:46] a brother or a sister you can trust but
[1:29:47] confess your faults we're all humans
[1:29:49] dealing with spirits that want to have
[1:29:51] strongholds but you know what if we're
[1:29:53] willing to just apply the word pour that
[1:29:55] word out into our lives you know what
[1:29:57] we'll do is tear it out in the
[1:29:58] strongholds we'll cast down Devils we'll
[1:30:00] get rid of them they'll have no power
[1:30:02] they'll have no hold there won't be any
[1:30:04] any any family genetics that will have
[1:30:07] control over our lives
[1:30:10] when that Holy Ghost comes in brothers
[1:30:11] and sisters he burns it all out
[1:30:14] and that's what I wanted to do today was
[1:30:16] try and encourage us you know what if we
[1:30:19] stop looking at the problems through our
[1:30:20] human flesh and saying I've got this
[1:30:22] thing I've I've got these ribs they just
[1:30:24] hurt
[1:30:26] what what if I was to just step inside
[1:30:28] the pillar of fire and say but my word
[1:30:30] says you're already healed
[1:30:33] my word says that that by my stripes
[1:30:36] you're already healed brother Barry what
[1:30:39] what if I started to look at my life
[1:30:40] that way if I had a need in my life what
[1:30:42] would God say about the need that I have
[1:30:44] in my life instead of saying that I just
[1:30:46] have this need in my life
[1:30:49] maybe I'm crazy but I say just leave me
[1:30:52] here I like it it's good
[1:30:55] you know what we want to do brothers and
[1:30:56] sisters is we want to get into the
[1:30:57] person of Jesus Christ and recognize his
[1:31:00] presence recognize really what the
[1:31:02] message of the hour is it's not just a
[1:31:04] Creed it's not just a Dogma it's not a
[1:31:06] book of do's and don'ts the the seven
[1:31:09] Church H book is not just a book of do's
[1:31:11] and don'ts and this is the the thing
[1:31:13] that we follow what we follow is Christ
[1:31:16] but what happened the purpose for the
[1:31:18] message of the hour was to introduce the
[1:31:21] bride to the bridegroom to introduce
[1:31:24] Jesus Christ to this world and you know
[1:31:26] when brother Branham went off the scene
[1:31:28] people will say well you worship brother
[1:31:29] Bradham then no we don't
[1:31:31] he was not the son of man he was a son
[1:31:34] of man revealing the son of man so where
[1:31:38] is the son of man today brothers and
[1:31:40] sisters we're living in the son of man
[1:31:42] Ministry and we know that when we go
[1:31:44] into the Millennium we're going into the
[1:31:46] son of David Ministry that Throne that's
[1:31:49] Eternal that will never disappear
[1:31:51] but currently right now where are we
[1:31:53] brothers and sisters if we can recognize
[1:31:55] our position in Christ then the Rapture
[1:31:56] will go if we can recognize what it is
[1:31:58] the church when we can recognize it then
[1:32:00] the Rapture will go why is that because
[1:32:02] the bread of life will be open before
[1:32:04] our eyes our eyes will be open to really
[1:32:07] what our position is and what our
[1:32:08] position really is brothers and sisters
[1:32:11] is that you are the literal
[1:32:13] manifestation of Christ if you have his
[1:32:14] spirit in you who are you
[1:32:17] are you yourself
[1:32:19] the word says that we become a new
[1:32:21] creature in Christ Jesus
[1:32:23] and that new creature isn't going to be
[1:32:25] anything but Jesus Christ himself
[1:32:29] I
[1:32:33] I just love this word
[1:32:35] questions and answers 1964.
[1:32:39] brother Branham
[1:32:41] he says when you use the expression that
[1:32:45] if we do not believe the word
[1:32:47] we will be eternally separated from
[1:32:50] Christ
[1:32:51] do you mean the foolish virgin will live
[1:32:54] eternally but they will be separated
[1:32:56] from the New Jerusalem where Christ will
[1:32:59] dwell with the bride
[1:33:02] here are those who do not have the Holy
[1:33:05] Spirit born again as the scripture
[1:33:07] speaks of being born again if the
[1:33:09] natural birth requires water blood and
[1:33:11] spirit does not the spiritual birth
[1:33:13] require all three stages of grace before
[1:33:17] the person is truly born again
[1:33:20] but the Branham says absolutely I just
[1:33:23] explained that this morning
[1:33:26] the same on the same thing
[1:33:28] you've got to have all stages
[1:33:32] your begotten of the spirit
[1:33:34] just like a baby has begotten
[1:33:36] and in the womb of a mother
[1:33:38] but not born until they receive the Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost
[1:33:43] we've got to receive the Holy Ghost In
[1:33:45] Our Lives brothers and sisters that's
[1:33:46] what causes the new birth
[1:33:48] it's not just coming to church and
[1:33:49] saying well I I believe that God sent a
[1:33:51] prophet and I believe that Jesus died on
[1:33:53] a cross it's getting the Holy Ghost In
[1:33:55] Our Lives that's what the new birth is
[1:33:57] and when we get that new birth and this
[1:33:59] Bible becomes a new book to us
[1:34:02] then we can see Jesus Christ in print
[1:34:04] form
[1:34:06] they're not born until they receive the
[1:34:08] Holy Ghost that's right you're born then
[1:34:10] you're not converted
[1:34:12] you're in the process of being converted
[1:34:14] until that time
[1:34:16] that wonderful to think about I grew up
[1:34:18] in the Pentecostal sort of offshoot and
[1:34:21] there was always some sort of Revival
[1:34:22] and something happening and and you know
[1:34:25] Ministries coming through and and
[1:34:27] there's people being born again all over
[1:34:29] the place and and and people were were
[1:34:31] dealing with conversions and and and
[1:34:34] people getting saved and and all this
[1:34:36] stuff was happening but I wonder I think
[1:34:39] back now and I wonder how many were
[1:34:41] truly getting born again they were
[1:34:43] called being born again but were they
[1:34:45] truly being born again because they had
[1:34:47] not been baptized in the name of the
[1:34:50] Lord Jesus Christ they were baptized in
[1:34:52] the name of the father Son and Holy
[1:34:54] Ghost so what's happening here brother
[1:34:56] Branham says is they're just still being
[1:34:58] converted and truly believing with all
[1:35:01] of their hearts to the manifestation of
[1:35:03] gifts I remember seeing all kinds of
[1:35:06] stuff in the church but you know
[1:35:07] brothers and sisters they couldn't go on
[1:35:09] and receive the word and that's the
[1:35:10] trick today we look at the first and
[1:35:12] second polls in brother Brown's Ministry
[1:35:14] and sometimes we could say where's the
[1:35:16] Third Paul in my life you know what the
[1:35:18] third poll is it's the opening of the
[1:35:20] word it's being able to say Amen to
[1:35:22] every word that's what the third pull is
[1:35:24] it's not some great wondrous work where
[1:35:26] we can just speak the word to go and
[1:35:29] heal someone in our lives you know what
[1:35:31] they're already healed they have to be
[1:35:32] the ones to accept that healing in the
[1:35:34] name of Jesus Christ
[1:35:37] we're not dealing the first poll we're
[1:35:39] not dealing the second poll we're
[1:35:40] dealing with a third pull and the third
[1:35:42] poll is the is the word manifestation of
[1:35:44] Jesus Christ and where is that word
[1:35:46] manifestation it has to be on our lips
[1:35:48] it's got to be in our voice it's got to
[1:35:51] be in our very lives that we live
[1:35:55] your begotten of the spirit just like a
[1:35:57] baby has begotten and in the womb of a
[1:35:59] mother but not born until they receive
[1:36:02] the Holy Ghost that's right you're born
[1:36:03] then you're not converted you're in the
[1:36:06] process of being converted until that
[1:36:08] time that's the reason that all these
[1:36:10] great Mysteries could not be given to
[1:36:12] Luther could not be given to Wesley
[1:36:14] could not be given to the age that has
[1:36:17] passed by us the Pentecostal age why it
[1:36:21] wasn't time
[1:36:23] they were begotten
[1:36:25] now the person of Christ himself the son
[1:36:28] of man you understand revealing himself
[1:36:31] in human flesh
[1:36:34] it could not have come until now
[1:36:37] this is 1964.
[1:36:40] so brother Branham
[1:36:41] here we might have some people say well
[1:36:43] you've got the prophet of God saying it
[1:36:45] couldn't come until now in 1964. so what
[1:36:47] does that mean brothers and sisters he
[1:36:49] means one of two things either well
[1:36:52] maybe one of three things either Jesus
[1:36:54] Christ is alive on Earth again walking
[1:36:57] around in his Corporal body which we
[1:37:00] know that's not supposed to happen until
[1:37:01] Revelations 19 so we can rule that out
[1:37:04] he has come in the manifestation of
[1:37:06] William Miriam Branham and people say
[1:37:09] that it's Christ Branham and we know
[1:37:11] that that's a devil a doctrine of a
[1:37:13] devil and we don't say that we won't
[1:37:15] agree with that not for a second a True
[1:37:16] Believer won't say that brother Branham
[1:37:18] was Christ in flesh
[1:37:20] so what's the only other option
[1:37:22] where is Christ made flesh
[1:37:25] has got to be in his bride
[1:37:27] those children that say Amen to his word
[1:37:31] he said now the person of Christ himself
[1:37:33] the son of man you understand revealing
[1:37:36] himself in human flesh it could not have
[1:37:38] come until now it had to be the right
[1:37:41] time right brothers and sisters that's
[1:37:43] right
[1:37:44] so you know what I want to do today I
[1:37:46] want to bring up the slides Brothers if
[1:37:49] you don't mind
[1:37:51] I did a little tiny PowerPoint just for
[1:37:53] the sake of discussion today
[1:37:56] maybe I'm getting a little more used to
[1:37:58] uh the technology
[1:38:02] I think that uh
[1:38:03] there's just a point that I wanted to
[1:38:05] make I I said it before and I don't know
[1:38:07] if it really
[1:38:08] was clear but and of course I can't get
[1:38:11] this to work now
[1:38:13] oh my
[1:38:17] it's not going to work
[1:38:18] all right so the statue of the perfect
[1:38:21] man we're very familiar with this
[1:38:23] brother Branham preaches on it
[1:38:25] extensively and uh and we all know it
[1:38:27] very well
[1:38:29] but there's just one point that I want
[1:38:30] to make and and if we can just go to the
[1:38:33] first slide
[1:38:35] we have this this pyramid that we're
[1:38:38] very familiar with
[1:38:39] and on the left side we have the church
[1:38:41] ages of the pyramid and and The
[1:38:44] Messengers
[1:38:45] on the right side we've got the lion
[1:38:47] oxman and Eagle we've got the the wheat
[1:38:50] and we know that it starts in the seed
[1:38:53] and it goes to the stock then it goes to
[1:38:55] tassel then it goes to the shuck
[1:38:58] and we have the the seed again and we
[1:39:01] know we heard brother Mervin say it uh
[1:39:04] real well that that seed has to be a
[1:39:06] rotten seed and that's what has to
[1:39:08] happen to our lives our lives has to
[1:39:09] become rotten we've got to die out to
[1:39:11] ourselves brothers and sisters we we
[1:39:13] talked about it last week we we have to
[1:39:16] have a contrite spirit and we'll get
[1:39:18] into that in a little bit but we can't
[1:39:19] just say that everything is going to be
[1:39:21] okay and I'm going to be myself and and
[1:39:23] everything is going to be uh normal it's
[1:39:26] not going to be normal when you truly
[1:39:28] get the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:29] you're no longer normal what people
[1:39:31] would call normal but we have this
[1:39:34] pyramid that we talk about the stature
[1:39:36] of the perfect man I mentioned it
[1:39:37] earlier we have faith virtue knowledge
[1:39:39] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:39:41] kindness and then we have Grace and love
[1:39:43] that Capstone Ministry that comes down
[1:39:46] on top of that pyramid and that's what
[1:39:48] we're so accustomed to to being taught
[1:39:50] and and we preach even and you know what
[1:39:53] I'm not I don't want to do away with any
[1:39:54] of that but if you could go to the next
[1:39:56] slide please
[1:39:58] we have another example of it the Great
[1:40:00] Pyramid brother Branham says the Great
[1:40:01] Pyramid was never capped he also says
[1:40:04] that I believe Enoch built the Pyramid
[1:40:06] and it wasn't kept because the builders
[1:40:09] rejected the stone that became the
[1:40:11] corner they didn't put a cap on top of
[1:40:13] that pyramid and it was a witness that
[1:40:15] they rejected that stone that Capstone
[1:40:17] but we know in our day there is this
[1:40:20] Capstone that's coming and many times I
[1:40:22] think by the way that this is
[1:40:24] represented it can show it as some sort
[1:40:26] of future tense event that's going to
[1:40:28] happen but if you could go to the next
[1:40:30] slide brother I just want to show this
[1:40:32] just for an example today that there is
[1:40:35] coming a Time brothers and sisters where
[1:40:37] there's going to be no space between any
[1:40:39] one of those levels any one of those
[1:40:42] virtues and you know that time is now
[1:40:44] brothers and sisters and what I wanted
[1:40:46] to do maybe someone could help me with
[1:40:48] this if they're technologically advanced
[1:40:50] is to actually show that entire pyramid
[1:40:53] as gold because there's coming a time
[1:40:55] where it becomes one the two are not one
[1:40:57] if if you want to see what I'm talking
[1:40:59] about for the sake of time I don't have
[1:41:01] all the quotes I've got other quotes
[1:41:02] today look up stature of a perfect man
[1:41:05] and listen to brother Branham talk about
[1:41:07] the two becoming one there isn't a space
[1:41:10] between them I'll never forget the first
[1:41:12] time I heard that it was brother Meadow
[1:41:14] that said that he said there's no mortar
[1:41:16] between those stones there will be no
[1:41:18] mortar between that Capstone and his
[1:41:20] church that stone that Capstone is made
[1:41:23] to fit exactly the same as the church
[1:41:26] and you know brothers and sisters it's
[1:41:29] one pyramid it's not two there's no
[1:41:31] future event that's coming right now as
[1:41:33] we speak as we come to church as we
[1:41:36] Fellowship around the word of God that
[1:41:38] Capstone is coming down in our lives and
[1:41:40] we know what that is that's love that's
[1:41:42] charity that's Jesus Christ himself
[1:41:45] so brothers and sisters I want to say to
[1:41:48] us today that as we have that thank you
[1:41:50] brother for the for the slides
[1:41:53] what habits do we have in our lives what
[1:41:56] do we fill our time with
[1:41:58] you might say brother Barry now you're
[1:42:00] getting personal you're stepping on toes
[1:42:01] I don't want to step on toes but I want
[1:42:03] to make sure we're not eating local weed
[1:42:05] brothers and sisters I want to make sure
[1:42:06] that we're healthy and I know by
[1:42:09] experience myself that if I'm not
[1:42:11] careful I'll go and just eat local weed
[1:42:13] this flesh wants to eat local weed man
[1:42:15] it looks good to the body it looks so
[1:42:17] appealing doesn't it but it will make us
[1:42:19] crazy it will make us so there's nothing
[1:42:21] that can be done with us and you know
[1:42:23] what it does is it just opens the door
[1:42:24] to Spirits brothers and sisters I'll say
[1:42:26] it for for example I've experienced it
[1:42:29] in my life to go and do something that I
[1:42:31] know I shouldn't do as a Believer and
[1:42:33] you know what happens it will take you a
[1:42:36] lot farther than you think you want to
[1:42:37] go it will take you and it will cost you
[1:42:40] a lot more than you want to pay and you
[1:42:42] know you'll have a problem in your life
[1:42:44] if you just allow one little thing to
[1:42:46] happen in your life brothers and sisters
[1:42:48] that's all satan wants I quit smoking
[1:42:50] many times when I was a smoker in my
[1:42:52] life and I found out even in the world
[1:42:54] that you know what cigarettes are devils
[1:42:56] and they never come alone and that I
[1:42:58] would say oh I quit but someone would
[1:43:00] say come on have a smoke just go for it
[1:43:02] and I hope this is okay I'm not being
[1:43:04] too liberal but you know it was in the
[1:43:06] world and I've been delivered from it
[1:43:08] because of the blood of Jesus Christ I
[1:43:09] can only talk about what's gone on in my
[1:43:11] life but you know any time that I would
[1:43:13] have quit else I had to do was not do it
[1:43:15] anymore just don't do it anymore and I'd
[1:43:17] be done with it but there was always a
[1:43:19] time where I would just have one and as
[1:43:22] soon as I had one well there's five and
[1:43:24] before long there's 25 and then there's
[1:43:26] a carton and before long you're looking
[1:43:27] back saying man a year and a half ago I
[1:43:30] quit smoking
[1:43:31] but I'm smoking now how did that happen
[1:43:34] brothers and sisters that's the way it
[1:43:36] is with the devil especially for Sons
[1:43:38] and Daughters of God if you have been
[1:43:40] delivered from something don't look back
[1:43:42] remember Lot's wife she turned to a
[1:43:45] pillar of salt because she looked back
[1:43:47] there was something in her heart that
[1:43:48] wanted her to look back don't do it what
[1:43:51] habits do you have brothers and sisters
[1:43:54] what do we fill our time with then if we
[1:43:56] don't want to call it habits what do we
[1:43:58] fill our time with
[1:44:00] what is it that's influencing Our Lives
[1:44:02] is it from God or is it from the world
[1:44:05] because it's one or the other
[1:44:08] it's a pretty bold statement but it
[1:44:10] truly is one or the other
[1:44:13] one is going to edify the body of Jesus
[1:44:15] Christ's life inside of us and one is
[1:44:18] going to
[1:44:20] canker it it's going to quash it it's
[1:44:22] going to push out that light
[1:44:25] but you know what
[1:44:27] if we can determine what the inspiration
[1:44:29] is behind it
[1:44:30] then we can guarantee where it comes
[1:44:32] from
[1:44:33] if we can identify the inspiration
[1:44:35] that's behind it is from God if it's
[1:44:37] based on the word of God then just keep
[1:44:39] going with it brothers and sisters
[1:44:40] because it's going to be beneficial to
[1:44:42] your body spiritually speaking
[1:44:45] but you know what happens is it starts
[1:44:47] to manifest in our physical bodies you
[1:44:49] might say brother Barry how can that be
[1:44:50] well you know what if we're doing
[1:44:51] something and it causes us to have a
[1:44:54] behavior in our lives whatever it is
[1:44:58] is it of of Christ is is the nature that
[1:45:01] we display
[1:45:02] while we're doing what we're doing of
[1:45:04] Christ or not because if it's not of
[1:45:07] Christ we can tell what the inspiration
[1:45:09] is
[1:45:10] you know brothers and sisters look at
[1:45:12] the clothing today what's the
[1:45:13] inspiration for clothing today
[1:45:15] comes from Hollywood from designers
[1:45:17] everybody wants to be a part of the lead
[1:45:19] designers you know many of the clothing
[1:45:21] designers want to get an endorsement
[1:45:24] from some crazy star from Hollywood or
[1:45:28] or maybe an athlete isn't that what it
[1:45:30] is it's all about some sort of stardom
[1:45:33] and some sort of inspiration behind it
[1:45:35] they could get their name get their
[1:45:37] endorsement on it we know that people in
[1:45:39] sports it's one thing to be a good
[1:45:40] player in sports but it's a totally
[1:45:42] different level it's the next level from
[1:45:44] professional sports when you start to
[1:45:46] get endorsements from manufacturers
[1:45:48] right that's what they're after what's
[1:45:49] the inspiration behind that
[1:45:51] so if we've got clothing that has to say
[1:45:54] a certain thing on it brothers and
[1:45:55] sisters what's the inspiration behind
[1:45:57] that you think there's no Spirits
[1:45:58] attached to that think again
[1:46:00] we can say oh no no no no there's no
[1:46:03] Spirits because I've got it I've cast
[1:46:04] out those demons but what are you
[1:46:06] reflecting to the world
[1:46:09] what inspiration is behind women's
[1:46:11] clothing the whole entire industry and
[1:46:14] then I'll say what's the inspiration
[1:46:15] behind men's clothing the entire men's
[1:46:18] industry and you might say well brother
[1:46:19] Barry why would you say that well think
[1:46:21] about it brothers and sisters we're
[1:46:22] living in a solemn condition how many of
[1:46:25] the manufacturers the ones who are
[1:46:26] actually designing the clothes for men
[1:46:28] today are women how many of them are
[1:46:31] women that actually believe this word
[1:46:33] for our day
[1:46:34] none of them most of them are men most
[1:46:37] of them are living in a Sodom Condition
[1:46:39] what Kind of world do we live in here
[1:46:42] my goodness but you know what's behind
[1:46:44] our habits brothers and sisters what's
[1:46:45] the inspiration in our lives behind the
[1:46:48] habits the things that we do the way we
[1:46:49] fill our time
[1:46:50] I have habits I'll say it I'm not afraid
[1:46:53] to say it you know what I did I got onto
[1:46:55] Facebook a little while ago and I'll
[1:46:57] tell you I told you I got onto Facebook
[1:46:58] a little while ago so that I could get
[1:47:00] in the marketplace it's a beautiful
[1:47:01] thing there's really good deals but you
[1:47:03] got to go through Facebook to do it oh
[1:47:06] my goodness can it ever be a bottomless
[1:47:08] pit
[1:47:11] it's a bottomless pit and you know what
[1:47:13] I found in my life I got to be careful I
[1:47:15] gotta watch it it can become a habit
[1:47:18] and that's not edifying the word in my
[1:47:20] life
[1:47:23] but what's inspiring our habits brothers
[1:47:25] and sisters is it watching is it
[1:47:27] watching screen time is it movies is it
[1:47:30] music because all of it it's either
[1:47:32] inspired by God or it's not and you know
[1:47:34] we've heard it said many times brothers
[1:47:36] and sisters we can have Christian rock
[1:47:38] and roll can we
[1:47:40] there's no such thing
[1:47:43] it's a lie of the devil there's no such
[1:47:44] thing as Christian rock there's no such
[1:47:46] thing as Christian rap there's no such
[1:47:49] thing as anything other than worship
[1:47:51] songs unto the Lord if we're listening
[1:47:54] to music and it sounds like the world
[1:47:55] it's because it's of the world it's an
[1:47:58] inspired song of the devil that's trying
[1:48:00] to capture your inspiration
[1:48:04] what's the other thing one other thing
[1:48:07] that we can be doing brothers and
[1:48:08] sisters gaming
[1:48:11] gaming we can be playing video games I
[1:48:14] want to say this who manufactured the
[1:48:16] game whatever the game is there can be
[1:48:17] all kinds of different games I know
[1:48:18] there's so many different kinds of games
[1:48:20] who manufactured the game and what's the
[1:48:22] inspiration behind it
[1:48:23] is it to edify the word in our lives is
[1:48:26] that video game an inspiration to the
[1:48:28] word or is it from the pit of Hell
[1:48:30] that's up to you to decide that Holy
[1:48:33] Ghost and you will determine that
[1:48:35] but you know it's either leading us
[1:48:37] closer to God or it's the most subtle
[1:48:40] voice of the field
[1:48:43] because it's the same devil isn't it the
[1:48:46] same serpent that old serpent the devil
[1:48:48] that came to speak to Eve is the same
[1:48:50] one that's whispering in the ear of the
[1:48:52] Bride today you can do it
[1:48:54] you have control
[1:48:56] you don't have to worry
[1:48:58] you know the message of the hour
[1:49:01] oh you've got the Holy Ghost because you
[1:49:02] can say Amen to the word but you know
[1:49:05] what if you do have the Holy Ghost in
[1:49:07] your life you're going to say uh-uh I'm
[1:49:08] going to look the other way man I'm not
[1:49:10] looking at that girl over there on the
[1:49:11] street I'm not going to look to that
[1:49:13] other thing that that is so tantalizing
[1:49:15] to my flesh I'm going to turn away and
[1:49:17] I'm going to look to Jesus I'm not going
[1:49:19] to allow that thing to ruin my life any
[1:49:21] longer and you know what brothers and
[1:49:22] sisters the more we conquer devils like
[1:49:24] that because that's what they are
[1:49:26] we got to call them what they are the
[1:49:28] more we conquer these Devils the less
[1:49:30] local weed we're gonna eat and you know
[1:49:32] what we're going to find ourselves in a
[1:49:34] position where Satan just won't even
[1:49:36] know what to do with us because we won't
[1:49:38] eat that food anymore we won't eat those
[1:49:40] weeds
[1:49:41] but as long as we keep eating them as
[1:49:44] long as I keep opening up Facebook and
[1:49:46] saying well I can see that guy and that
[1:49:47] guy and that guy and you know what I can
[1:49:49] do I can look up friends that I knew
[1:49:51] from before in the past and I can see
[1:49:52] how they're doing I can be creepy with
[1:49:55] it and it'll be fine nobody will know
[1:49:57] you know let's design that way
[1:49:59] for a purpose
[1:50:01] to capture our attention and just suck
[1:50:04] Us in how many other things are there in
[1:50:06] this world just like Facebook brothers
[1:50:07] and sisters my goodness the inspiration
[1:50:10] behind our habits what is it is leading
[1:50:13] us closer to God or it's the most subtle
[1:50:15] beast of the field it's one or the other
[1:50:17] remember brother Branham said it in the
[1:50:19] first quote that we read
[1:50:21] habits are spirits
[1:50:23] actually a second quote that we read
[1:50:25] habits are spirits
[1:50:27] they're actually spirits and you know
[1:50:29] what the holy spirit is going to become
[1:50:31] a habit for us to go on our knees and
[1:50:33] pray for our brothers and sisters
[1:50:35] the holy spirit is going to be a habit
[1:50:37] for us to say oh my I know that that
[1:50:39] brother said that and I know that sister
[1:50:41] said that but I'm just going to say
[1:50:43] bless God I know their sons and
[1:50:45] daughters of God and I'm just going to
[1:50:46] say I can't wait to have that grand
[1:50:48] reunion with them over there on the
[1:50:49] other side because they're my brother
[1:50:51] and they're my sister and it doesn't
[1:50:52] matter what happens
[1:50:55] we can have habits that are good and we
[1:50:58] can have habits that are bad
[1:51:02] and brothers and sisters here we go this
[1:51:04] is where the rubber meets the road in
[1:51:05] our lives we're talking about tearing
[1:51:07] down strongholds casting down
[1:51:09] imaginations that would try and exalt
[1:51:10] themselves against the word of God in
[1:51:12] our lives right that's really what we're
[1:51:15] after that's the scripture that we read
[1:51:16] in second Corinthians this morning
[1:51:18] looking at things through the pillar of
[1:51:20] fire just like God did for the children
[1:51:23] of Israel when they had the Egyptians
[1:51:25] the whole Egyptian Army after them hot
[1:51:27] on their Trail and you know brothers and
[1:51:29] sisters you can put yourself in that
[1:51:31] position we can put ourselves in
[1:51:32] opposition and say we are the children
[1:51:34] of Israel and we got our back up against
[1:51:36] the mountain we got our back up against
[1:51:37] the the sea and here comes all the
[1:51:40] Devils of Hell raging in their chariots
[1:51:43] after us what are we going to do and we
[1:51:45] know that God said to Moses what are you
[1:51:46] crying to me for speak the word all we
[1:51:50] need to do is speak the word we just
[1:51:52] need to put ourselves in that Pillar of
[1:51:54] Fire better yet get that Pillar of Fire
[1:51:56] Inside you and you're going to have a
[1:51:57] different perspective on it
[1:52:00] but if you're wondering if something
[1:52:01] that you're dealing with in your life is
[1:52:03] a is a habit
[1:52:05] stop doing it
[1:52:07] stop it
[1:52:09] completely
[1:52:10] I want to give us a challenge stop it
[1:52:13] brother Barry turn off Facebook
[1:52:15] brother Berry get rid of the app

[1:52:25] Barry this is this is what brother
[1:52:26] Branham called Fresh I'm getting this as
[1:52:28] I'm talking to you here this ain't in
[1:52:30] the notes okay challenge accepted I
[1:52:32] don't need Marketplace who cares about
[1:52:34] Marketplace I can go to Kijiji
[1:52:38] brothers and sisters their habits though
[1:52:41] if we can't stop doing it what's wrong
[1:52:44] with us
[1:52:45] and you know what I want to say I want
[1:52:46] to throw this out there if you stop
[1:52:48] doing it what happens to you when you
[1:52:50] stop doing it
[1:52:52] does it make you happy
[1:52:53] or do you get angry
[1:52:55] does it make you feel like you're going
[1:52:57] with through withdrawals I just can't
[1:52:59] deal with myself I can't deal with this
[1:53:01] situation because I have to go back on
[1:53:03] Facebook oh my goodness I can't live
[1:53:05] without seeing what everyone's doing in
[1:53:07] their lives you know what if that's what
[1:53:09] happens to me it's a devil
[1:53:11] it's a devil
[1:53:13] pull down that stronghold brothers and
[1:53:15] sisters don't let it have a hold in your
[1:53:17] life
[1:53:20] if you want to know just stop doing it
[1:53:22] for a while and see how you react to it
[1:53:24] is it an addiction
[1:53:26] is Facebook an addiction for brother
[1:53:27] Barry
[1:53:29] my goodness
[1:53:33] but if it makes you I'm angry to stop
[1:53:35] doing something
[1:53:36] just take a step backwards brothers and
[1:53:38] sisters and look at the inspiration of
[1:53:39] it
[1:53:42] see where that inspiration comes from
[1:53:45] see if it's truly from God if it's not
[1:53:48] from God let alone just leave it alone
[1:53:50] because you know what it's going to do
[1:53:52] it's going to drag you down and you know
[1:53:54] what it's going to do it's going to drag
[1:53:55] your family down you know what it's
[1:53:56] going to do it's going to drag your
[1:53:57] church down and you know what it's going
[1:53:59] to do it's going to take you and put you
[1:54:01] in a cage and that devil is going to not
[1:54:03] stop until he has destroyed your life
[1:54:06] destroyed your experience and you know
[1:54:08] what if you have a devil with a strong
[1:54:11] hold in your life brothers and sisters
[1:54:13] just confess it to someone confess your
[1:54:15] faults one to another and pray for one
[1:54:18] another that you may be healed and you
[1:54:20] will be delivered of it
[1:54:22] you don't have to stay in that position
[1:54:28] is the inspiration of whatever it is of
[1:54:31] Christ or is it of Satan
[1:54:33] I think that's such an important
[1:54:34] question
[1:54:36] you know we've heard it said many times
[1:54:37] in the scripture do all things unto
[1:54:39] Christ if we can't do something with you
[1:54:41] or without Jesus Christ in our lives
[1:54:43] then why are we doing it
[1:54:44] it applies
[1:54:46] why would we listen to whatever we're
[1:54:48] listening to without Jesus Christ say
[1:54:50] here brother Jesus why don't you put
[1:54:52] these headphones on and listen to this
[1:54:53] great song that I like secretly nobody
[1:54:56] else knows I listen to it but I just
[1:54:57] can't get it out of my system I just
[1:54:59] love it and you know brothers and
[1:55:00] sisters I'll tell you
[1:55:02] music has a major influence for me
[1:55:06] and and I'm not drawn to it
[1:55:09] by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:55:10] testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:55:13] but isn't it interesting how does
[1:55:15] Facebook know a lot of the music that I
[1:55:18] used to listen to before I even got on
[1:55:20] Facebook
[1:55:21] I'll tell you how because it's not of
[1:55:24] God it's an inspiration of the devil the
[1:55:26] devil remembers the music that he used
[1:55:28] to have a grip in my life with and he
[1:55:31] wants me to have that that burden in my
[1:55:33] life he wants to get that strong hold in
[1:55:35] my life again but I won't give it to him
[1:55:39] but it's interesting because I
[1:55:40] experienced that and I find myself going
[1:55:43] high I remember that song you know and
[1:55:45] then I'm like what am I doing on
[1:55:47] Facebook wasting my time
[1:55:49] and you know what I I don't really have
[1:55:51] anything against Facebook if anybody's
[1:55:52] on it I'm not saying you shouldn't have
[1:55:54] it in your life because I think there's
[1:55:56] a balance too and I think that there is
[1:55:58] a possibility for a pastor or a Ministry
[1:56:01] to overstep and say that you should do
[1:56:03] this and you shouldn't do that I say
[1:56:05] this this is all I'll say just what my
[1:56:07] pastor taught me that I grew up in he
[1:56:10] said get the Holy Ghost in your life and
[1:56:12] he'll tell you the spirit of truth will
[1:56:14] tell you what you should or should not
[1:56:16] do and you know many times I'd go to him
[1:56:18] and ask him that and he would never tell
[1:56:20] me he would never tell me what the
[1:56:21] answer is he'd say you know what you got
[1:56:23] to get the answer you're the one that's
[1:56:25] got to do the work God needs to reveal
[1:56:27] it to you personally and when he does
[1:56:30] nobody can change it from you because if
[1:56:32] someone can talk you into it then the
[1:56:34] devil can talk you right out of it and
[1:56:35] you'll be right back to where you were
[1:56:38] we talked about it last week brothers
[1:56:40] and sisters you know
[1:56:42] out of Isaiah
[1:56:45] God bless you brother Isaiah
[1:56:48] I don't even have it here open we talked
[1:56:51] about having a contrite heart
[1:56:54] and having a humble spirit
[1:56:58] you know what that word contrite means
[1:57:00] out of Strong's
[1:57:02] it's number 1793 it means crushed
[1:57:06] powder destruction
[1:57:09] having a contrite spirit
[1:57:12] knowing that our spirit if we've got our
[1:57:14] will and our spirit brothers and sisters
[1:57:16] it ain't been crushed yet
[1:57:18] and you know what has to happen it's got
[1:57:19] to be crushed
[1:57:21] it's got to be destroyed our own
[1:57:23] perspective we've got to get rid of it
[1:57:25] we've got to let it be Jesus Christ in
[1:57:27] our lives
[1:57:28] and this word contrite out of strong
[1:57:30] 1793 comes from 1792. I typically don't
[1:57:34] like doing this because the root of a
[1:57:36] word the root of a root of a root it
[1:57:38] just makes my eyes flutter back in my
[1:57:39] head but I think it's so important for
[1:57:41] us to look at this because of where this
[1:57:43] word comes from from 1792 of the strongs
[1:57:45] it means to crumble
[1:57:48] transitively to bruise literally or
[1:57:51] figuratively
[1:57:53] to beat to pieces
[1:57:55] how much of this old nature do we want
[1:57:57] to have in our lives brothers and
[1:57:59] sisters the word says that we've got to
[1:58:00] have a contrite heart
[1:58:03] to crumble transitively to bruise
[1:58:06] literally or figuratively to beat to
[1:58:08] pieces to break in pieces bruise
[1:58:10] contrite Crush destroy humble
[1:58:15] we've got a contrite heart
[1:58:17] our old nature is going to be gone
[1:58:19] there's not going to be anything left in
[1:58:21] our nature how much of Jesus old nature
[1:58:24] do you think was in him when he made it
[1:58:26] to Calvary when he finally made it up
[1:58:27] there after being whipped almost to
[1:58:29] death
[1:58:30] my goodness after that prayer meeting in
[1:58:32] the garden
[1:58:33] after healing that servant's ear that
[1:58:37] his his follower cut off all the things
[1:58:40] that he had to go through and suffer the
[1:58:43] the robe being put on him and then torn
[1:58:46] off tearing off all of those those scabs
[1:58:48] of blood the the crown of thorns put
[1:58:51] upon his head talk about being crushed
[1:58:53] talk about being destroyed that's what
[1:58:56] Jesus went through how much persecution
[1:58:58] did we go through in our lives my
[1:59:01] goodness I've got to just turn off
[1:59:02] Facebook are you kidding me that's
[1:59:04] terrible I can hardly do that what a
[1:59:06] ridiculous thing that is to even think
[1:59:08] about to think that I would be
[1:59:10] challenged to do that but you know what
[1:59:11] the devil's subtle he's going to come at
[1:59:14] us with every single angle that he's got
[1:59:16] because he can't come and crucify us on
[1:59:18] a tree
[1:59:19] he missed his opportunity
[1:59:22] he can't put a crown of thorns on our
[1:59:24] head
[1:59:25] he can't whip us with the cat of nine
[1:59:27] tails until we're just about bled out to
[1:59:30] nothing
[1:59:31] the only thing he can do is Captivate
[1:59:33] our attention distract Us in any way
[1:59:37] possible from realizing truly who we are
[1:59:39] from realizing truly The Authority that
[1:59:42] lies in us already
[1:59:44] as a son and daughter of God
[1:59:46] Isaiah 57 when thou Christ let thy
[1:59:50] companies deliver thee but when the but
[1:59:52] the wind shall carry them all away
[1:59:53] vanity shall strike them but he that
[1:59:56] putteth his trust in me shall possess
[1:59:58] the land and shall inherit my Holy
[2:00:00] Mountain and shall say cast ye up cast
[2:00:03] ye up prepare the way take up the
[2:00:05] stumbling block out of the way of my
[2:00:07] people
[2:00:10] with us saith the high and lofty one
[2:00:11] that inhabiteth eternity
[2:00:14] whose name is Holy I dwell in the high
[2:00:17] and holy place with him also that is of
[2:00:21] a contrite and humble Spirit to revive
[2:00:25] the spirit of the humble and to revive
[2:00:27] the heart of the contrite ones those who
[2:00:31] are willing to die out to themselves
[2:00:32] those are the ones that are going to
[2:00:34] inhabit eternity those are the ones that
[2:00:36] are going to inhabit the most high those
[2:00:39] ones who say no no I've got it I'm good
[2:00:41] I you know what I I don't need to listen
[2:00:44] to that I I it's all good I I believe
[2:00:46] what I believe and there's nothing you
[2:00:48] can tell me you know what there isn't
[2:00:49] there isn't because the devil's got a
[2:00:51] stronghold
[2:00:53] this is the word of God this is what the
[2:00:54] prophet of God spoke about this is what
[2:00:57] he preached
[2:00:58] you know brothers and sisters if we
[2:01:00] haven't had a new birth and we say that
[2:01:02] everything is okay
[2:01:03] brother Branham says we ain't ready for
[2:01:05] a ceiling
[2:01:07] remember the quote that we read last
[2:01:09] week I'll call the musicians up as we
[2:01:10] close today remember the the quote that
[2:01:13] we read last week brother Branham
[2:01:15] talking about the boxcar
[2:01:17] and the inspector coming by and shaking
[2:01:19] The Boxcar and seeing what's inside it
[2:01:22] has everything been packed properly
[2:01:23] because if it hasn't been packed
[2:01:25] properly then we can't seal it it can't
[2:01:27] make it to its destination everything
[2:01:28] that's inside of it is actually going to
[2:01:30] be damaged
[2:01:32] we can say that everything is okay but
[2:01:34] we ain't ready for sealing yet if we
[2:01:36] haven't had a new birth but when God
[2:01:38] sees a man
[2:01:40] contrite broken Spirit sincere in heart
[2:01:45] come down at the altar God closes the
[2:01:48] door of the world to him and seals him
[2:01:50] in there by the baptism of the Holy
[2:01:52] Ghost
[2:01:54] brothers and sisters stand with me today
[2:01:56] I don't want to have an altar call
[2:01:59] but I do want to have an altar call I
[2:02:00] want to say to you the altar of God is
[2:02:03] open and if there's anything in our
[2:02:05] lives that we want to change we want to
[2:02:07] make right brother Branham said it here
[2:02:09] we ain't ready for sealing if we say
[2:02:11] that everything is all good in our lives
[2:02:13] and there's nothing wrong
[2:02:14] but when God sees a man contrite
[2:02:16] remember we talked about that a spirit
[2:02:19] that's crushed
[2:02:21] there's no more pride in me you can't
[2:02:23] take anything more out of me remember
[2:02:25] job he was contrite he said there's
[2:02:28] nothing more I wish that I hadn't even
[2:02:30] have been born because there's nothing
[2:02:31] in me more to give I can't do anything I
[2:02:34] can't say anything I can't be anything
[2:02:37] we got to be contrite we got to
[2:02:39] recognize that there's nothing in our
[2:02:41] lives that is going to save me
[2:02:43] but until we get there we're not going
[2:02:46] to receive the Holy Ghost
[2:02:47] God's going to allow us to remain right
[2:02:49] there in that position and we can
[2:02:52] sometimes just get stuck in
[2:02:53] sanctification brothers and sisters
[2:02:55] don't get stuck in the second phase of
[2:02:57] it go all the way into Christ get the
[2:03:00] baptism of the holy spirit so you know
[2:03:02] that you know that you know
[2:03:04] the only way you're going to get that
[2:03:06] though is to have a contrite heart
[2:03:08] to not have anything inside of me to say
[2:03:10] no no no I know I'm good I don't need
[2:03:12] any more if you if that's the way it is
[2:03:14] then that's the way it is that's the way
[2:03:15] it'll be
[2:03:17] since we ain't ready for sealing but
[2:03:19] when God sees a man contrite broken
[2:03:20] Spirit sincere
[2:03:22] in heart down at the altar
[2:03:25] God closes the door of the world to him
[2:03:27] and seals him in there by the baptism of
[2:03:30] the Holy Ghost and it lasts until Jesus
[2:03:33] comes not from one Revival to the other
[2:03:36] but until the day of your Redemption
[2:03:40] brothers and sisters we don't want to
[2:03:42] have a stronghold in our lives the only
[2:03:44] stronghold we want in our lives is a
[2:03:46] stronghold for the Holy Ghost we want to
[2:03:48] be fortified with the word in our lives
[2:03:50] to recognize there ain't no devil that's
[2:03:52] going to have any hold on me and you
[2:03:54] know what brothers and sisters if there
[2:03:55] is one if you could look at your life
[2:03:57] and recognize that there is one you can
[2:03:58] get rid of it right now you don't have
[2:04:00] to come to the altar you just have to
[2:04:02] have a contrite heart you've got to be
[2:04:04] willing to say take it out of me Lord
[2:04:07] you take it out of me and I'll go
[2:04:10] forwards and do what I need to do to
[2:04:11] make it right in my life and he will
[2:04:14] [Music]
[2:04:19] a devil wants to have a stronghold in
[2:04:22] your life
[2:04:23] the devil wants to have a stronghold in
[2:04:25] my life but we we read this earlier
[2:04:27] today in in Corinthians second
[2:04:30] Corinthians we're looking at pulling
[2:04:33] down strongholds the weapons of our
[2:04:34] Warfare brothers and sisters
[2:04:36] are Mighty through God to the pulling
[2:04:38] down of strongholds
[2:04:40] and you know I I just want to say this
[2:04:42] for those people who are into war and
[2:04:45] understand
[2:04:46] we have got laser guided ordinances
[2:04:50] for the devil
[2:04:52] we have got Precision Munitions to
[2:04:55] destroy those Devils out of our lives
[2:04:58] he's not going to blow up our whole
[2:04:59] house he's just going to surgically
[2:05:01] remove that devil from our life and that
[2:05:03] devil is going to sing to you no no no
[2:05:05] no if you do something if you do
[2:05:06] anything about this then the whole
[2:05:07] church is going to know and everybody
[2:05:09] you know what that's a lie of the devil
[2:05:11] he wants to keep you exactly where he's
[2:05:14] got you
[2:05:15] your brother isn't going to think any
[2:05:17] less of you he's going to think more of
[2:05:19] you because you've got the spirit of God
[2:05:21] and you know what your brother might say
[2:05:23] my I admire his courage I wish I had
[2:05:25] courage like that
[2:05:28] same thing with the sister cast out
[2:05:30] imaginations brother your sisters humble
[2:05:32] yourselves in the sight of your lord of
[2:05:34] the Lord and what will he do he'll lift
[2:05:36] you up
[2:05:37] he'll take you and he'll give you the
[2:05:39] baptism of the Holy Spirit if you can
[2:05:41] humble yourself in his sight and then
[2:05:43] you know what there ain't no devil
[2:05:44] that's going to have a hold in your life
[2:05:45] they'll try and hold on they'll try and
[2:05:47] grab on they'll try and drag you down
[2:05:48] but there'll always be a sermon
[2:05:50] somewhere somehow someone will say
[2:05:52] something a message might say it a
[2:05:54] brother could call you you could get a
[2:05:55] text message something will come your
[2:05:57] way and it'll just be that little still
[2:05:59] small voice of the Lord speaking to you
[2:06:01] and you'll say oh my be it unto me
[2:06:03] according to your word Lord and you'll
[2:06:05] just go to prayer and say Lord forgive
[2:06:06] me and it'll be over
[2:06:08] that'll be the end of it
