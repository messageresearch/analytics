Description:
There is coming a day 
When no heartaches shall come
No more clouds in the sky
No more tears to dim the eye
All is peace forevermore 
On that happy golden shore
What a day, glorious day 
That will be

CHORUS
What a day that will be
When my Jesus I shall see
When I look upon His face 
The One who saved me by His grace
When He takes me by the hand
And leads me through 
The Promised Land
What a day, glorious day 
That will be

There'll be no sorrow there
No more burdens to bear
No more sickness, no pain 
No more parting over there
And forever I will be 
With the One who died for me
What a day, glorious day 
That will be
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
A man day and no heartache shall come. Oh clouds in the sky for all of that gold. Glorious day I will be. Oh my. Oh my Jesus. I shall see. The one will save me. But he's going to take your boy the hand. Oh, and he'll leave me through the land. The promise glorious. Oh, no more burdens to bear. No more sickness, no more pain, no more padding over there. Oh, and forever we will be with him. When the one will die for me. Die for me. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I lead the pro. Oh, what a day. Glorious day that will be. Oh, what a day that will be. Oh, what a day that will be. Oh, my Jesus. Heat. Heat. I live through the promised land. Oh, glorious day will be. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, it will be a reality. It is a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are walking in. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandon one time will tell us a story about a violin. There was a violin that was at an auctioneer and you know the violin was was being auctioned and people making offers on it. $1, $2, $3 seem to have no value in us. You see, the violin was dirty and dusty and and it just just lying there. But you see one day the master walked in. &gt;&gt; You see the one that that could play it, &gt;&gt; the one that knew about music, &gt;&gt; the one that knew about symphonies, &gt;&gt; he walked in and he picked up that violin and it began to dust us, began to clean us. Then he began to play some music. As he began to play some music, the offer came back again. From $1, it began to go to a,000, 2,000, 3,000. Encourage you to say it this morning to say the master is here. &gt;&gt; He's the composer of your life. &gt;&gt; He knows how to play it. Maybe you may feel like you've gotten dusty or may maybe feel like you've lost value of of who you really are. But let me say the master is here. &gt;&gt; He can pick up that violin. &gt;&gt; He can begin to dust it off. And &gt;&gt; play the symphony. Play the music that he wants to play through your life. &gt;&gt; You are of a great value. &gt;&gt; You are of a great value. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy tell you anything else. &gt;&gt; You are of a great value. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Arise and shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is you season, church. This gross darkness and we see it all around us, but there's still light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are the light &gt;&gt; by the vindicated words of this day and of this hour. &gt;&gt; You may help me to believe that this morning. I'm going to say, "Lord, here I am. Take my violin. Begin to play. Begin to play the music that you want played out of my life and let it glorify you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want no glory in this. We don't want to be like Lucifer. We want to glorify you again. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song?
