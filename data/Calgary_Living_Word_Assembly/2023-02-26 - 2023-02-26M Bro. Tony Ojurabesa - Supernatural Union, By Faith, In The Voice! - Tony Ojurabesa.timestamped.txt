[1:05:42] back in 2003
[1:05:44] the U.S army planned to drop that bomb
[1:05:47] but the background out of it because
[1:05:49] they are afraid of the damage you don't
[1:05:50] do
[1:05:51] but 14 years later that uh president
[1:05:54] Trump
[1:05:56] now told us so they have to go and drop
[1:05:58] that bomb
[1:05:59] and that bomb did some damages people of
[1:06:02] God

[1:06:32] he's going to drop the same bomb the
[1:06:34] mother of all bomb in North Korea
[1:06:37] and the people got scared because they
[1:06:39] know they they crazy that young man

[1:16:39] God bless you Pastor Barry
[1:16:42] relation 10 7.
[1:16:46] are you there yet
[1:16:47] he said but
[1:16:49] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:16:53] angel not eight angel
[1:16:55] but seventh angel
[1:16:57] we shall begin to sound
[1:17:00] the mystery singular not not Mysteries
[1:17:04] as plural
[1:17:05] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:17:08] as he had declared to his servants the
[1:17:10] prophets
[1:17:11] may God bless you have you see this
[1:17:12] morning
[1:17:14] for the Lord this morning I'd like to
[1:17:16] speak to you
[1:17:18] for the next 35 or 45 minutes on the
[1:17:21] subject of of Supernatural Union
[1:17:24] by faith in their voice
[1:17:27] Supernatural Union by faith in the voice
[1:17:30] amen
[1:17:33] now brother Peter we now we know that
[1:17:35] the worst financial means something
[1:17:37] super
[1:17:38] yet natural amen
[1:17:41] some that is beyond the element of this
[1:17:43] world
[1:17:44] something that your five senses cannot
[1:17:45] declare amen but he's there just like
[1:17:48] the bible define faith in Hebrews 11
[1:17:51] chapter that faith is the sometimes of
[1:17:53] things hoped for
[1:17:55] they've done the things that you don't
[1:17:56] see at all Hallelujah
[1:17:58] so Supernatural means something that's
[1:18:00] in the heavenlies in the other in the
[1:18:01] Heavenly Realms somebody
[1:18:04] and the word Union means two or more
[1:18:07] things becoming one amen all right
[1:18:09] and faith is a revelation

[1:18:16] expressed amen

[1:40:46] another one in North Carolina I haven't
[1:40:48] started the church in Gastonia not turn
[1:40:50] their backs against message and blessing
[1:40:52] the prayer of God
[1:40:54] the liar that's a blasphemy you call him
[1:40:59] you know that we have tried that when
[1:41:00] Barbara he was alive are dead call him a
[1:41:05] liar
[1:41:06] oh brother Barry law how much what did
[1:41:08] they were living in
[1:41:10] yeah
[1:41:12] come us all space all everywhere
[1:41:17] is omnipresent so he's everywhere
[1:41:20] and it's always has been everywhere and
[1:41:23] he always will be everywhere I've
[1:41:25] already said God
[1:41:28] because he's omniscient first he knows
[1:41:31] all things
[1:41:32] so he can be everywhere that makes me
[1:41:34] only present
[1:41:35] I'm not I'm the only omnipresent this
[1:41:37] morning
[1:41:39] I'll be in Nigeria at the same time
[1:41:41] while I'm here but I'm number he is
[1:41:43] omnipresent
[1:41:44] he can be can you imagine how many
[1:41:47] people villains are praying to God every
[1:41:48] second all over the world
[1:41:50] every second and he has each one request
[1:41:53] one by one one by one one but and
[1:41:57] without comparing confusing the request
[1:41:58] or one with the other
[1:42:00] what did mardigans
[1:42:03] because it's omnipresent and because
[1:42:05] it's an impression that means important
[1:42:08] all powerful he can do all things
[1:42:12] so God is Not There People he's not dead
[1:42:15] he's still doing the miraculous today
[1:42:18] so what's the problem why why people
[1:42:20] think they're not seeing results
[1:42:24] it is the attitude of the people that
[1:42:26] bring this results
[1:42:28] Pastor said the right mental attitude
[1:42:32] towards any Divine promise will bring it
[1:42:34] to pass all right
[1:42:38] people that are bringing the results
[1:42:45] each of us is a creator
[1:42:48] so we create the atmosphere in which we
[1:42:49] live in so let's create Specialists away

[1:43:16] pray until the Holy Ghost came came
[1:43:18] because they got in one place and won
[1:43:21] Accord

[1:43:40] he said is the atmosphere that bring the
[1:43:42] results

[1:50:56] be sending my Hallelujah
[1:50:59] amen before we close this morning I want
[1:51:02] I'd like to show you
[1:51:04] the purpose of the revelation of the son
[1:51:06] of man in this last days if you don't
[1:51:08] mind Luke 17 30 is that okay pastor
[1:51:12] the scripture says in Luke 17 30 and 17
[1:51:15] 28-30 that as it was in this of Noah
[1:51:19] so shall be in this when the son of man
[1:51:21] is revealed
[1:51:22] and as it was in days of a lot so shall
[1:51:25] this be in the day when the son of man
[1:51:27] is revealed
[1:51:28] why did God choose to repeat the
[1:51:31] minister of son of man and it is when
[1:51:33] the world is in Sodom condition people
[1:51:35] of God
[1:51:36] remember
[1:51:37] I said Christ come in three sons name
[1:51:40] right
[1:51:42] he came first a son of man which means a
[1:51:44] prophet right
[1:51:46] yeah can you see the same in somebody
[1:51:49] secondly he came as Son of God which is
[1:51:51] the only ghost in the church in churches
[1:51:53] and slowly it came as the son of David
[1:51:56] in a millennium are you still with me
[1:52:02] he said he came in three sons name he
[1:52:04] came as son of man
[1:52:06] Son of God Son of David now son of man
[1:52:09] is a prophet even Jehovah's himself
[1:52:12] called Ezekiel said Son of Man
[1:52:14] give us speaking to a man Prophet call
[1:52:17] him son of man and Jesus identified
[1:52:19] himself as son of man because the
[1:52:21] scriptures cannot cannot be broken
[1:52:24] and eternally that Army 18 verse 15.
[1:52:28] said don't let God speak anymore we want
[1:52:31] Moses to speak to us
[1:52:33] you said I won't speak to them and no
[1:52:35] more like that but I will send them a
[1:52:37] prophet
[1:52:38] I used it means
[1:52:42] and then God said the law your God in
[1:52:45] Germany 15 said the law of God shall
[1:52:47] raise up a prophet like lacking unto me
[1:52:49] and so that so that structure cannot be
[1:52:51] broken
[1:52:52] he had to come as son of man
[1:52:54] now that that was for this his age when
[1:52:58] he was here on Earth there he did when
[1:53:01] he died Rose ascended and sent back the
[1:53:03] holy spirit that was the thou the son of
[1:53:05] God
[1:53:06] God is a spirit and through the church
[1:53:09] ages it's been Son of God Amen and don't
[1:53:12] forget that between the Son of God which
[1:53:14] is now and the son of David Ministry he
[1:53:16] had to show up as soon as the prophet
[1:53:19] then that's what we had today I used to
[1:53:21] with me
[1:53:23] amen and then in the Millennium is son
[1:53:26] of David sitting on the throne throne
[1:53:28] ruling
[1:53:29] are you still with me this morning
[1:53:31] but the purpose of relation the son of
[1:53:33] man in this last days is no such another
[1:53:35] Organization no no sir he's not to start
[1:53:38] another movement he got the attorney
[1:53:40] message to the United Nation now I'm the
[1:53:42] message
[1:53:43] but the question is the messaging you
[1:53:46] yeah
[1:53:48] organization
[1:53:50] that's messed up
[1:53:52] don't have much upon us
[1:53:55] but the purpose is to bring about a
[1:53:57] union
[1:53:58] with Christ
[1:54:00] and with one another Hallelujah
[1:54:03] that's that's what the Bible says first
[1:54:04] John chapter 1 verse first John 1 verse
[1:54:07] 5 and 7. first John
[1:54:10] 1 5-7
[1:54:12] he said and this then is the message
[1:54:14] which we have heard of him and declare
[1:54:17] unto you that God is light
[1:54:20] and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:54:23] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:54:25] him and walk in darkness will lie and do
[1:54:28] not the truth
[1:54:30] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:54:34] the light then we have Fellowship one
[1:54:37] with another Union
[1:54:39] Hallelujah and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:54:42] his son cleansed us from all sin
[1:54:46] you know what that means
[1:54:47] that means there's atonement in
[1:54:50] Fellowship
[1:54:51] are you within somebody
[1:54:52] said there's a block coverage for the
[1:54:54] church chocolate that's why the past
[1:54:57] will have the authority to cast a
[1:54:58] brother from that under the blood if he
[1:55:00] won't repent in 30 days is that okay
[1:55:02] with me because
[1:55:05] that guy is protected from by the blood
[1:55:09] Hallelujah
[1:55:12] are you still with me this morning
[1:55:15] by faith in the boys
[1:55:17] I probably preached three unique
[1:55:19] messages

[1:55:23] the entitled
[1:55:25] United time and sign United time and
[1:55:27] sign Hallelujah

[1:55:35] your jobs in school you know Club
[1:55:37] societies he said and even watch out now
[1:55:39] eventually he's going to end up in the

[1:55:45] there are you serving somebody
[1:55:49] amen somebody
[1:55:51] they have got their each other so that
[1:55:53] these are bundles
[1:55:54] are you even talking about somebody that
[1:55:56] Christ spoke about in Matthew 13 verse
[1:55:59] 30. and when he spoke about it the Bible
[1:56:02] is so all right
[1:56:03] and that's why he said so I went to see
[1:56:06] his sickness written in on his farm and
[1:56:09] the enemy came behind him at night
[1:56:11] brother party and so tears
[1:56:19] let them grow up together

[1:56:50] and we are going to Rapture by God's
[1:56:52] grace
[1:56:52] and also we also appreciate myself and
[1:56:55] call invisible Union of the blood of
[1:56:57] Christ
[1:56:58] there he told us how that in these last
[1:57:00] days through this message something
[1:57:02] happening in the spiritual world
[1:57:04] invisibly
[1:57:06] God is united with his bride by the word
[1:57:10] are you with somebody
[1:57:13] invisibility of the bread of Christ they
[1:57:15] also preached a message entitled Oneness
[1:57:17] of unity
[1:57:18] where he told us that Christ is becoming
[1:57:20] one today
[1:57:21] we've got one for the first time
[1:57:24] to fill that word they are promising
[1:57:26] John 14 20 where he said at that day
[1:57:29] what day which day this day
[1:57:31] you shall know that I am and the father
[1:57:35] and ye in me and are in you Oneness God
[1:57:40] and Christ I mean Christ and the bread
[1:57:42] becoming one Hallelujah
[1:57:44] the Oneness of unity Hallelujah and this
[1:57:47] is where I'm going this morning
[1:57:48] Supernatural Union by faith in The Voice
[1:57:51] that when you say Amen to every word of
[1:57:54] this message
[1:57:55] you are Financial United with Christ
[1:57:57] because this Bride is a word bride
[1:58:01] you don't see the difference
[1:58:05] but you already won Christ because it's
[1:58:08] the word hallelujah that's why you can
[1:58:10] say that word
[1:58:12] because you're part of that word
[1:58:13] you know we're in the promise of this
[1:58:15] for this last day
[1:58:18] love said behold I will send you who you
[1:58:23] you Tony you Barry you Judy you told me
[1:58:26] you Paul I'll send you
[1:58:28] Elijah the prophet
[1:58:30] so before God said Elijah here he sent
[1:58:33] you here for us
[1:58:35] as a great farmer as a great plan that a
[1:58:37] planet our God is
[1:58:39] as a good farmer you have to prepare the
[1:58:41] ground for your crops before you plant
[1:58:42] it right and what about the seed right
[1:58:45] so God has a prayer they had they'll
[1:58:46] received that a bearing grounds for to
[1:58:48] sow the seed of the spoken for this hour
[1:58:49] and your heart and my heart that that
[1:58:52] that building ground somebody that's why
[1:58:55] I said I send you not to the world you
[1:59:02] of the Lord
[1:59:04] and look at somebody
[1:59:07] um
[1:59:08] that we're gonna go to heaven in a
[1:59:11] Rapture for the wedding supper no no no
[1:59:12] it's for the wedding no sir when it's
[1:59:15] going on right now
[1:59:16] when you say Amen to this message you're
[1:59:18] married to Christ supernaturally he
[1:59:21] already he's already claiming you
[1:59:22] Hallelujah
[1:59:24] you might say well I don't feel like no
[1:59:25] you have to feel like it
[1:59:27] there are times don't feel like you're
[1:59:28] Christian
[1:59:29] it's happened but was destroyed too you
[1:59:32] want to kill himself maybe God's not
[1:59:33] with me but God who was with him and we
[1:59:36] all feel the same way sometimes we feel
[1:59:38] that God's not with you but this is all
[1:59:39] always with you
[1:59:41] at least you're gonna just just pay
[1:59:42] attention Hallelujah
[1:59:45] so the second reason why God sent the
[1:59:47] Prophet this last day is to bring about
[1:59:48] faith amen somebody
[1:59:51] Beyond healing of the body
[1:59:54] fat for the larger for the body change
[1:59:56] because listen to the sin of God is hard
[1:59:58] to have faith for healing of the
[2:00:00] headache how much for our faith to have
[2:00:02] you changed the second
[2:00:04] are you with somebody
[2:00:06] that's why God sent his message from
[2:00:09] this last days
[2:00:10] to give us faith on the Rapture because
[2:00:13] we are this we are we are the Innocence
[2:00:15] for this hour
[2:00:16] we're not going we're not going to test
[2:00:18] death we're going to be changed Paul
[2:00:20] said we shall not all we are changed in
[2:00:22] our night we are the anarchists the
[2:00:25] seventh one Adam Hallelujah
[2:00:28] you saw that in Jude chapter 1 verse 14
[2:00:30] which you said and enough also there's
[2:00:33] seven that was seven years seven seven
[2:00:35] from Adam but beside of this the bride
[2:00:38] saying behold the law command with ten
[2:00:41] thousand of his of his Saints that's the
[2:00:43] brother Hallelujah
[2:00:44] Hallelujah somebody
[2:00:46] also Danny also saw that in in his day
[2:00:49] so he said he saw a thousand thousand
[2:00:52] Minister before with him to him
[2:00:55] and instead thousand thousand it's time
[2:00:57] before him he said judgment is in the
[2:00:59] western judgment but who minister to the
[2:01:01] husband with the wife
[2:01:03] are you listen to somebody
[2:01:05] named by faith in The Voice
[2:01:08] and that's why God sent the problem this
[2:01:10] last day is because we are the innocuous
[2:01:12] for this hour amen
[2:01:13] We Shall Not Die somebody
[2:01:16] for death I'm looking for the rapture
[2:01:19] because it's a promise
[2:01:21] Rapture is a promise to do for those who
[2:01:23] are looking to look for it
[2:01:25] it's naturally not by faith in The Voice
[2:01:27] Hallelujah in our test this morning very

[2:17:27] up a prophet not a reformer
[2:17:30] but a prophet an eagle
[2:17:33] and I don't kind of like what happened
[2:17:34] some years ago when David Branham was
[2:17:37] here and someone in Canada and some a
[2:17:40] man made myself what do you say your
[2:17:41] last name is you say my name is
[2:17:44] Branham isn't that a grandfather a
[2:17:47] pastor he said no no no no no no no no
[2:17:48] my grandfather was not a pastor it was a
[2:17:51] prophet I like that but right it's not a
[2:17:53] proud Pastor hello he's a prophet he's
[2:17:56] not a former Hallelujah

[2:18:06] um said that he's truly he's the voice
[2:18:09] of God to us in this age Hallelujah
[2:18:10] somebody
[2:18:12] Hallelujah and I want to clarify this
[2:18:14] today that don't pay attention that
[2:18:16] those guys are there Peter
[2:18:18] uh we only have one verse this hour if
[2:18:21] anybody push anything does not message
[2:18:22] through the way
[2:18:24] Hallelujah somebody William Brown is
[2:18:26] God's voice to us in this age
[2:18:28] in the message my commission May 5 1951
[2:18:32] by the brown said now I'm just your
[2:18:34] brother by the grace of God very humble
[2:18:36] man
[2:18:37] but when the angel of Lord moves down it
[2:18:40] becomes them a voice of God to you
[2:18:43] yeah said that right in the audience you
[2:18:46] can feel resentment from the audience
[2:18:47] who doesn't think he is he ain't nobody
[2:18:51] yeah and you know that's it was supposed
[2:18:52] to walk into when your password to
[2:18:54] preach for you you say mental word of
[2:18:57] God pull on this gift don't say who's
[2:18:59] here I know him before he became Pastor
[2:19:01] that's that's very kind of right don't
[2:19:03] talk like that
[2:19:05] put his man in his place
[2:19:07] yeah are you with somebody
[2:19:10] almost done
[2:19:12] build me
[2:19:14] he said
[2:19:16] when the angel Lord come down then it
[2:19:18] becomes a voice of God to you
[2:19:21] so after and then somebody starts to
[2:19:23] resent me I can Peter from this and then
[2:19:24] the spirit said if an advice saying that
[2:19:27] forgive me but I felt that that might be
[2:19:31] resented but I am God's word to you
[2:19:35] Hallelujah
[2:19:36] and that's why I'm going to discipline
[2:19:37] people of God William Bram is God's

[2:19:59] that again
[2:20:01] the first time was under inspiration see
[2:20:03] when I felt bad about it
[2:20:06] the first time but it then your lord
[2:20:08] repeated it again
[2:20:10] I can say imagine pastor Barry when he
[2:20:12] said the first time the people didn't
[2:20:13] resent him nothing
[2:20:24] because it's God's word to you to us
[2:20:25] hallelujah
