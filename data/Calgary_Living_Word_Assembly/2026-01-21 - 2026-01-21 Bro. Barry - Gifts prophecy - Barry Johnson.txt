I'm going to sing All My Life once more as brother Don comes. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. Every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Pray this is a blessing for someone tonight. This poem is called Dying to Die. Yahweh put a seed deep in my heart. Didn't look like much at the start. No bro lights, no open door, just quiet life growing more. I'm learning how to die well. Lord, lay my life down to your will, Lord. Like a chopped timber, I fall so the word may live. That's all. The seed grew up by grace alone, found its way through flesh and bone. It bore much fruit along the way, fed the hungry, help them stay. I'm learning how to die. Well, Lord, lay my life down in your will, Lord. Not my name, not any fame, only Jesus, the very same. &gt;&gt; Now the seasons changed, I see. Your life asks more of me. &gt;&gt; To let go, to not hold tight, to endure the dark before the light. I'm learning how to dwell, to die well, Lord, knowing you are with me, Lord. &gt;&gt; The seed don't die to end the story. It dies bringing you glory. &gt;&gt; So every day I lay it down in little deaths that make no sound. When I forgive, when I bow, when love's the only thing I know. I'm learning how to die well, Lord. Spend my life like you did, Lord. If they see anything in me, let them see you clearly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the night feels long and near, still I rest without fear. What you bury, you will raise. Life comes out of dying ways. &gt;&gt; I'm learning how to die well, Lord. Fall like wheat into your field, Lord. When my time is finally gone, may you live in others on simply seed in your hand. Just the life you planned. I will fall. I will trust dying well because I must. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Stand if you would. Thank you. Gift like that is quite amazing. We hear a lot of those poems. There's a whole collection of them. Now, brother Don's brought true gift and our brother. We certainly thank the Lord for it. It seems fitting that this song was right after he mentioned the word grace. If we died well, amazing grace will always be our portion. &gt;&gt; We die daily is what our apostle Paul said. We must die to this flesh. The amazing grace shall always be my song of praise. For it was grace that brought my liberty. I do not know just why he came to love. He saw he looked beyond my faults and he saw my need. Aren't you glad he did tonight? Oh yes. I shall my eyes to die for me. The grace that my he looked beyond my thoughts and he saw blind me. Yes, he looked beyond my faults and he saw. &gt;&gt; Can you hear the sound from heaven? Like the sound of many waters, it's the sound of worship coming from the throne. Here's his throne tonight. Oh yes. Oh Christ to make his glory. Oh, see Oh, we worship you. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Isn't that easy? It's so wonderful to worship him. So thankful that we can gather together one more time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The way that he's ordained the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just have a few prayer requests we would like to bring tonight. And we're certainly thankful that you know a couple of them. One of them is for the Charneck family in South Africa. Just want to continue to hold them before the throne. trust the Lord will work things out for his good &gt;&gt; in their lives. That's the family that lost everything in the fire. Also, we want to pray for the Panettas who fly out tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To Japan and then they will go over to Philippines and I believe in Japan as well as Philippines. Brother Mvin's going to be ministering many many services. &gt;&gt; Yes. And uh yeah, they don't let you get away easy when you go. But we certainly want to pray for our brother that the Lord would continue to give him a a call or two off of the altar that he'd be a real blessing to the the bride &gt;&gt; over there. Um two praise reports before we go to prayer. Brother Henry's doctor report came back all good. certainly wonderful when uh the doctor's report will match the great physician's report. &gt;&gt; I'd also like to thank the Lord for allowing my nephew Zach to go back home today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And on behalf of the family, I would just like to thank everyone who took the time and resources to help them. However you did, we know there was people that did. So, thank you so much. If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, tonight we're so thankful that we can gather together, Lord, the way that you've ordained for us in in the age in which we live, Lord. And we know that's in you. As our brother already prayed, only in your spirit are we going to have our prayers heard by you. Many people in this earth today gather together and they gather together in your name. But Lord, they're not willing to take your spirit. They're not willing to allow you to be Lord. They're very interested in you being Jesus and even the Christ, but not their Lord. Father, tonight there's a group of people gathered here in this building and maybe virtually that truly want you to be Lord. That means master over everything in their lives. &gt;&gt; And Father, we're so thankful that we can gather together that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, one more time, we just want to thank you for touching Brother Henry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, there's no doubt there was symptoms and no doubt there was actual devils trying to afflict our brother. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; you touched him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just continue to watch over Brother Henry and his family. They've been a real blessing to the assembly, Lord. We pray that you would just continue using them, Brother Henry and his family for your glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for touching Zack Natarak. &gt;&gt; Amen. for allowing him to go home, Lord, to defy all of the doctor's reports, Lord, &gt;&gt; to say that someone with a disease like that may not be able to recover so easily. But, Father, here he is at home tonight, Lord. Bless him abundantly. I pray, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you would just bless the parents, Brad and Kelly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, and Betty that's worked so hard to help them in their home, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that you would just continue to watch over them, Lord, &gt;&gt; and that you would receive the glory. &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to remember the Charneck family in South Africa, Lord. That you would just continue working out your perfect will in their life, Lord. &gt;&gt; We know all things work together for the good to those who are called according to your purpose. And Lord, we just want to commit them into your hands, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we also just thank you for watching over the Panettas, Lord. Yes, &gt;&gt; we know that you've ordained their trip, Father, that you have it all worked out from the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; And Father, we pray that you would just keep your hand upon them, Lord. &gt;&gt; That you would bless their way, Father. That they would come home with a a manifold testimony of your grace, &gt;&gt; as they walked with you along the way, &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to commit each need that was made known unto you tonight by the way of an uplift hand, maybe just an uplift heart, Father, someone present or even away. Father, we know that brother Jerry Carpenter has requested prayer. The doctor's report says one thing, Father, but we know &gt;&gt; we don't believe the doctor's report. We believe your report. &gt;&gt; And it all depends on whose report we believe, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you would just bless each one tonight, Father. &gt;&gt; As we turn to your word now, we pray that you would just break it fresh to us once again in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you musicians. If you have your Bibles tonight, I would like to continue our study in the uh book of 1 Corinthians talking about spiritual gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking about spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians chapter 12. 1 Corinthians chapter 12. Just like to welcome brother Josh Adrian with us. had the pleasure of meeting our brother in Edmonton last year and took me a moment to register who he was. I I I knew I met him and I just couldn't remember his name, but it's certainly good to to see you, brother, and I trust you feel right at home. 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse one says, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. You know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Interesting because it's not as though you just walked after them. As Gentiles, we were led. Wherefore, I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God callth Jesus accured, and that no man can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same Lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which workketh all in all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. Aren't you thankful for that tonight? For to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit, &gt;&gt; to another faith by the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To another the gifts of healing by the same spirit. &gt;&gt; To another the working of miracles. To another prophecy. To another discerning of spirits. to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. &gt;&gt; But all these workketh that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will. For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many are one body, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, tonight it's our dire our desire, Lord Jesus, that we could just drink in from that spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; We pray that Lord Jesus we could drink in so that you could push out. &gt;&gt; We just invite you Lord to have the preeminence in our service now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. Certainly thankful to be able to gather together again on a Wednesday. &gt;&gt; Amen. something special about the Wednesday services and you know we thank the Lord for the ability to do this. We don't know how long we will be able to but as long as we can we will. you know, uh, I had something cross my feed today that I thought was intriguing and tonight, if it's okay, I'm just going to take a minute and talk about it. And, uh, I think probably many people have seen it going around on the internet now for the believers. But, you know, uh, we believe that William Brham was a prophet. &gt;&gt; We believe he was a prophet to this age. And we know that many times he talks about Russia and watch Russia and you can see the king of the north in in the visions from 1933 and uh what took place there. But he also said something interesting about what's taking place quite literally in the news now. I mean how many people here have heard about what's taking place with Greenland these days? I can imagine just about everybody's hands would go up if you're involved with the news at all. You can hear that Trump is actually vying to actually take over Greenland as a US uh state, I would guess, &gt;&gt; but he's very interested in Greenland. And I didn't didn't realize that Greenland was even mentioned in the message. Brother Brandham mentioned it five times. &gt;&gt; The uh the continent of Greenland. So, out of 1961, I'm just going to read two quotes about Greenland that brother Brandham said, and uh I guess we'll just let it fall where it may. 1961 0315, an uncertain sound. Brother Bradom says, "And then I believe it was the senator of some state was just talking to brother Shakarion and up in Greenland where this nation is prepared from Greenland to destroy the earth with atomic weapons. Just one touch and any nation will go plum off the earth. See, the only thing we hear is just they got a bomb will do certain certain things, but they got it bigger than that. You know, they don't you don't let all of your secrets out when it's in national affairs. I had no idea that this was even in the message that Brother Brandham spoke this way about Greenland. I thought maybe perhaps there would be discussion about Greenland in, you know, maybe some of the people up there. And you know, in a couple of the quotes, Brother Brandham just does talk about the people that are in Greenland and how they're kind of Eskimos and so on, but you know, three of the quotes he speaks with this tone talking about atomic weapons and and I think that's astounding when we can see really where we are. Um, we see everything that needs to happen, you know, happened already. Don't get me wrong, 70 years ago, the prophet said, "Everything that needs to happen for the rapture has happened except for the ripening in the sun." And here we are ripening 70 years later. In 1961, Abraham and his seed after him, Brother Brandham says, "Come, go with us to Miami." when a man that stood with his hand yonder in Greenland to turn atomic bombs loose that would have destroyed half the earth shook and become a Christian will be speaking when he saw a missile in a screen and they thought it was Russia starting he says we're ready too other nations are ready also Castro used down yonder just as a puppet playing up so Russia can get in there close enough they can throw their atomic missiles and things here it is right under our nose you know brother Brandham talks about it this is 1961 he's speaking about this and we know that Russia now has what they call hypersonic missiles that there's no stopping you they go so fast there's no way that you can actually intercept them it's just not going to happen. There's no way to do that. And uh so I just find it interesting that brother Brandon would even talk about Greenland. And here we hear it's in the news so profoundly about how the US and you know if you get into the study about the US, Revelations 11, Revelations 12, Revelations 13 specifically speaking about the USA that uh that lamb that came in with two horns and uh it's right out of Revelations 13. It's taking place right before our very eyes, brothers and sisters. It's astounding when you really look at it with the revelation that we have in the day in which we live. I just thought I would bring those just because uh you know here here we are right in the midst of prophecy being fulfilled. You know, brother Brandham preached a message called modern events made clear by prophecy. When we can see these things happening, it's no accident. It's it's no happen chance. We we and and you know, brothers and sisters, I I I want to be clear. I'm I'm not saying this to make us afraid. &gt;&gt; I want to say this. If we're afraid, then something is wrong. We need to actually get a little closer to the cross. &gt;&gt; We need to recognize who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It could be frightening for children. But parents, we need to encourage our children. I will encourage our children. Get into Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the only bomb shelter that we've got. There is no shelter on this earth that will save us from any of this affliction that's coming. And it's not like it might happen. It's going to happen. &gt;&gt; It's been prophesied. &gt;&gt; Thus sayaith the Lord. We spoke about that on Sunday. There's something so profound, so powerful about thus sayaeth the Lord. And there's something about the elect that can actually recognize the power, the the the immensity behind those words, thus sayaeth the Lord. But tonight, we're talking about spiritual gifts. I want to get back into our our little study about the spiritual gifts, recognizing that there's nine spiritual gifts in the body, from the Holy Ghost, through the Holy Ghost, by the Holy Ghost. It is the Holy Ghost. And brother Brandham says that every local body should experience these gifts. They should be a part of every local assembly. And uh you know, for the record, for those people that might maybe be visiting or or not know what's uh Brother Barry's heart is or maybe we've forgotten, we're not chasing gifts. We're simply saying that they are a part of the believer's life. They are actually part of the Holy Ghost. And sometimes, many times from old, even looking at the message of the hour, some people have brought in scarecrows and made it a scary thing to maybe speak in tongues. They've made it a scary thing to prophesy, a scary thing to see a miracle. It's not a scary thing. It's actually the working of the Holy Ghost. And we ought to be expecting to see it. And I think we've heard it said, I probably said it. I I think that I need to calibrate myself this way. We ought to be more surprised when we don't see these things than when we do. &gt;&gt; But many times as believers, we can get really surprised when we see the hand of God move in our life and think, "Wow, it's amazing. It is truly amazing." But that's the life of a believer. &gt;&gt; The apostles, I don't think, were very surprised after the day of Pentecost, were they? We know the the two went to the gate beautiful and they saw that beggar at the gate and of course he asked for alms and he they looked at him Peter's eyes fastened on him and said listen I don't have any alms to give you but what I've got I will give you in full measure &gt;&gt; take up your bed stand up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; we know that there will be a book of acts written behind the believers of this age &gt;&gt; so looking at spiritual gifts we're not chasing the gifts We're chasing the giver. &gt;&gt; And you know if there is any chasing the only thing we need to do is surrender to the giver &gt;&gt; and all the gifts follow. &gt;&gt; Some people want to see s certain individual gifts. And you know brothers and sisters I believe it is a dangerous ground that we can find ourselves standing on to say that I have a gift of certain. I have a gift of this or I have a gift of that. If you do have a gift that is according to the scriptural spiritual gifts, then it will manifest according to the word. &gt;&gt; And if it manifests any other way, remember Satan can impersonate any one of these gifts. &gt;&gt; That's why it's treacherous. That's why it's tricky. That's why there's scarecrows raised around the gifts in the church, specifically around the message of the hour. But we oughtn't to be afraid of them. Brother Bradom says, "Where there's scarecrows, that means there's good eating." &gt;&gt; That's where the apples are. We ought to get in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And get some good eating. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, tonight I want to encourage us to get in there and get some good eating. Tonight, we're going to talk about uh prophecy. We've covered knowledge, wisdom, faith, healing, working of miracles, and tonight we're just going to talk a little bit about prophecy. And remember, I I've said this all along that we're only skipping across the the top of the pond with this. We could go into a greater detailed study, but I think there's so much to actually study in the word. Um, I'm not going too deep with it, and I hope that's okay. Some folks maybe want to see it to be deep and everything to be deep, but you know, the Holy Ghost is as deep as it gets. That's right. &gt;&gt; And looking at the attributes of the Holy Ghost, it doesn't get any deeper. And these are all attributes of the deepest revelation that we could ever have. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful how we are are here just worshiping in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Talking about prophecy, um it is out of verse n I believe to other faith by the same spirit the gifts of healing another working of miracles. It's verse 10. To another prophecy. And that's all it says. It's so so simple. It's just to another prophecy. Wow. &gt;&gt; Someone else gets a gift of prophecy. And and it's such a a wonderful thing to think about this because every one of these gifts, we've spoken about it, are given to every man to profit with all. These gifts are not to profit ourselves from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not given these gifts to make merchandise of. And if that's what happens, then that means there is a wrong spirit behind the gift. Because remember, brothers and sisters, gifts and callings are without repentance. We're born with gifts in our life. &gt;&gt; And you know what? The same rain that falls on the wheat falls on the weeds. And all of them profit with all. And you know what? It doesn't matter who we are. we will actually manifest the gift that's inside of us if we just allow that word to water us. &gt;&gt; We can't prevent that. But talking about prophecy, there's a very specific method for prophecy to come in the church. And I I don't know, I I I'm just so thankful that we have a church age messenger, Paul the Apostle, who was the one to lay the foundation, the one to actually set the pattern for every church age. We covered that when we studied the church age book and and he said it very clearly. Let's turn over to Romans chapter 12. Romans chapter 12. We'll just talk about this prophecy tonight a little bit from scripture. We've got a a quote that we're going to bring as well. I just wanted to take a little bit of time here and and go over this. We know full well that brother Brandham preached what Paul preached. He based the entirety of the message upon what Paul preached &gt;&gt; and any other message is a false message &gt;&gt; because he went back to that scripture that Paul said very clearly that you know what if an angel from heaven came any other man came and preached any other gospel than what I've already preached than what we've already brought to you let him be accursed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me say it again. He says, he underscores it. He makes it so profoundly clear. It has to be according to this pattern &gt;&gt; in uh Romans chapter 12. Paul speaking to the church. Don't put it back in history 2,000 years ago. He's speaking to us. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. I think that's so profound. every single one of us, myself included, let us let us present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God. Verse two says, "And be not conformed to this world." We don't want to look like this world. We don't want to talk like this world. We don't want to think like this world. We are not of this world. &gt;&gt; We're of another world, aren't we? Amen. &gt;&gt; And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. That just speaks exactly to what brother Brandham said. How do you know you got the Holy Ghost? What's the sure evidence you got the Holy Ghost in your life? That scripture right there. &gt;&gt; It's that one. You're going to say amen to the word. You're not just going to say amen to the word, but the the word is going to actually manifest and live out through your life. You're going to die out well to yourself so that he can live &gt;&gt; because you're not being conformed to a church. You're not being conformed to the message. You're not being conformed to an assembly. Legalism will put you in the grave. But this word has the resurrecting power of the living God to get you out because you're not conformed to this word or this world, but you're transformed by the renewing of your mind. You die out to yourself that ye may prove. How do you prove? Your life proves it. &gt;&gt; You can say it all you want, but your actions demonstrate what spirit is motivating you. you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Remember the word perfect. We know it is in perfection. It's having everything correct. But it's also incomplete. &gt;&gt; That word means complete. It means mature. &gt;&gt; Having a mature will of God in your life. No longer children tossed to and fro. Verse three says, "For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith." Amen. &gt;&gt; Remembering that what verse four says, for we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office. So we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another. We're not all individuals. Many times we can say, well, the gentile church, God deals with the gentile church as individuals. He does. But he also has one bride body. &gt;&gt; And that one bride body is going to be identified by the attributes of that one spirit. Because every single attribute in that bride body, the spirit, the gifts by the spirit, they're going to all manifest according to that word. &gt;&gt; The devil will come around and impersonate any gift. But there will be an uncertain sound. And if there's an uncertain sound that doesn't ring true with this word, we know it's not the spirit of God because the spirit of God will not deny one word. He will not deny one word. Satan will though. He proved that in the Garden of Eden, didn't he? One word off. The hallmark of Satan. For I say through the grace given unto me, that every man is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. For we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office. So we being many, are one body in Christ, and everyone members one of another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry, let us wait on our ministering. Or he that teacheth on teaching, or he that exhortth on exhortation, he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity, not complicated. &gt;&gt; I want to give, but it's got strings. No, give freely. &gt;&gt; The word of God says not to let the right hand know what the left is doing. &gt;&gt; Just to give freely &gt;&gt; because the way we give is the way we'll receive. It's the way that the Lord will deal with us. &gt;&gt; My, it's so beautiful. &gt;&gt; Verse eight, or he that exhortth on exhortation, he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity. He that ruleth with diligence. He that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness, let love be without dissimulation. &gt;&gt; And we know that word is without delusion. being diluted, diluting it down. We don't want to let that love be diluted at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dissimulation. Abore that which is evil. Cleave to that which is good. &gt;&gt; Now, I just think these next scriptures really get into how the spirit wants to deal within the body, one to another, as we are individuals, but yet we're one body. One member ministers towards the other member. when when we're actually contrary to this, I want to say what kind of spirit is actually influencing us. Cuz verse 10 says, "Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In honor, preferring one another, &gt;&gt; not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Distributing the necessity of saints, given to hospitality, bless them which persecute you. Bless &gt;&gt; and not curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And curse not. Sorry. Bless them which persecute you. Bless and curse not. We're not living under Old Testament law, an eye for an eye, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; A tooth for a tooth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What we're doing is we're living under grace. &gt;&gt; That unmarited favor that he has given us freely. &gt;&gt; My rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of the same mind, one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. &gt;&gt; Be not wise in your own conceits. I think this is such a a really interesting scripture here. Be not wise in your own conceits because we could see that we have a gift in our life and be kind of wise because we got a gift in our life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; My goodness. That's not going to do us any good, is it? Recompense to no man evil for evil. &gt;&gt; Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lith in you, live peaceibly with all men. &gt;&gt; That's an amazing scripture because it shows if it be possible as much as lith in you, live peaceibly with all men. It would actually lead me to believe that there's a possibility that you might not be able to live peaceibly with all men, which is shocking. Verse 19, dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath. For it is written, vengeance is mine. I will repay, sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he thirst, give him drink. For in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This makes me think of the scripture that we we read about how Elisha, you know, he was able to smite those guys blind, the Syrians. He smoked them blind and he was able to say to them, you know what? Don't don't worry to his his his student. Don't worry to his his pupil. Just watch this. And he went out and said, who you looking for? and told them and smoked them blind, stood to them face to face, the guy they were looking for and said, "You know what? I'll take you to where he's at." And what they he took him and and led them right into a trap, led them right into Israel. The Syrians brought them right in to where the king was. And the king was shocked and said, "What should we do? Should we smite them? Should we smite them?" And he said, "No, no. Scripture says that if thine enemy hunger, feed him." &gt;&gt; Right? If if he thirst, give him drink. &gt;&gt; Don't don't try and and render evil for evil. But in doing so, in doing what the scripture says that you'll heap coals of fire upon his head. And what happened was the Syrians went home and there was no more battle. There was no more struggle. I think it's so beautiful. I I read this tonight because I wanted to talk about the the attributes of gifts, the attributes of the Holy Ghost in in our lives. They actually will line up with the word. &gt;&gt; We're not going to render evil for evil. We're not going to curse. We're not going to be doing all that stuff. What we're going to do is actually display divine love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we're displaying anything but that, we're under the influence of another spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. 1964 of perseverant. &gt;&gt; Brother Random says, "Well, if he is the same yesterday, today, and forever," which he is, by the way, &gt;&gt; sometimes we'll say things, you know, if he is, and and I know some people get upset by that. I can't help it. That's what the prophet says. And I know I've said it, but I'm not going to back down from it because I know my testimony was I said, "If you're God, be God to me." Some people need to say that. Brother Brandham has said that. We've heard it preached before. But but he says here, well, if he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, only he is not in physical form. When he returns like that, time is over. He'll take the church with him. But he's here in the form of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is where I believe with all my heart that most of Christianity misses the second coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The full return of the Lord according to his word because he's not coming to walk on this earth. He's coming to take his bride. &gt;&gt; And when she realizes the prophet said it, when the church recognizes what it is, the rapture is going to go. He didn't say when he comes again, then then the church is going to go. And maybe he did in certain ways, but I'm just referring to that one quote specifically where he said, "Where the church recognizes what it is." But he is here in the form of the Holy Ghost to come into me and into you and perform his same works. He said in John 14:12, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also." Is that right? &gt;&gt; And we know that, Brother Brandham said it very clearly that Mark 16 in action is the true church and all else is false. And that's where I think some people they they really like to dismiss that part in the church age book and maybe say the church age book is a little bit outdated or maybe somebody else helped grammatize it so it wasn't actually everything that William Mary and Brandham said. But you know I I think it's a copout because why would we not want to see the full manifestation of Mark 16 in our lives? Why would we not want to see this scripture 14:12? He that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only reason I could think that maybe we would try and make an excuse for that is because we've got something off in our life that we're just not willing to go back and do the harder work to fix so that we can see the full manifestation of the Holy Ghost in our life. It's not easy surrendering, surrendering all the way. But the people who have surrendered all the way that have had that full full surrender experience, you know what I'm talking about. And if the world is in us and we're telling the truth, sorry, if the word is in us and we're telling the truth and it is the word that he promised for today, then isn't the word of God sharper than a two-edged sword? Isn't he able to surgically remove things from us? Isn't he able to to cut hurts out of our life and cut out pain that we don't like and and take away these things that maybe will so easily beset us and hold us back? His word is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Does the Bible say that was not all the prophets could discern in the thoughts in the people's mind? Is that right? Why? It was the word that was in them. It was the word that was in them. It wasn't them doing it. &gt;&gt; Many times people will say that about William Brham. It wasn't him doing it. He was just standing there when the angel of the Lord came. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when he came, then he was just a conduit. &gt;&gt; He said that's how they were vindicated. That was their credentials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think this is so beautiful because many times we can look at our lives and say that we've got all these credentials. I can say that I can fix this and I can fix that and I can do the other. All of it is for nothing. We know that Paul who was a Pharisee of Pharisees before God knocked him off of his spiritual high horse right on his way to persecute the church. After that happened, he went into Arabia and he came back and said, "You know what? I had to go through everything in my life. I had to take a full accounting of everything that I thought I knew in my life to find out that IT'S ALL DONE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING. All of my credentials are worthless &gt;&gt; because I realize I've been doing it wrong." &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful. There are credentials, brothers and sisters. And the credentials are the vindication of his word in our lives by his word following us by the gifts manifesting in our lives by our ability to serve him day in and day out. &gt;&gt; He says that's how they were vindicated. That was their credentials. None of them belonged to an organization. Not one never did. Their credentials was their ministry. &gt;&gt; So beautiful. God said, "If there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet and what he says comes to pass, then hear him." Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it must not be must must not just be once. It must be continually all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. from prophets. There is a gift of prophecy that's in the church which is to be examined by the examiners before it can be told to the church. Of course, let it be before two or three judges and then it's told to her. And we know brother Brandham says the very same thing. He repeats what Paul says that that's the same thing with tongues and the interpretation of tongues. When you get into these gifts manifesting in the church, there is a specific church order. If there is a gift of prophecy in the church, which they're supposed to be, it has to be handled correctly. It has to be judged. It doesn't just get to manifest in the congregation. If it does just manifest in the congregation, it's out of order according to the word of God. Same with speaking in tonesues. There has to be an interpretation of it and it has to be a very specific event, a very specific meaning. We're going to get into tongues tonight. We're talking about prophecy. Prophecy is a very interesting discussion. Tonight, while we were at the supper table, Christopher asked me, "What is the difference? What are we talking about prophecy? We're talking about a prophet." And I said, "No, son. There's a difference between the gift of prophecy in the church and actually a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and the I'll say the third part which can make it really confusing is there are people who are smaller prophets and they're still around &gt;&gt; but there's no more major prophets. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The only major prophets that are going to be seen on this earth are two witnesses that are headed to Israel. And I can't help but think just any day now we're going to see them there. &gt;&gt; But those are the only prophets that are coming. There is not a a an eighth age messenger after William Brham &gt;&gt; as some might suppose. There's not a continuation of his ministry in the lineage of the Brham family as some might suppose. Even though I would say this, he said Joseph is a prophet. &gt;&gt; Joseph has a prophetic gift, but that doesn't mean there's another age prophet. And if anything that Joseph said takes us away from what William Brham said, then he needs to be accursed. Now, I'm not saying that we want to curse anyone. THAT'S WHAT PAUL SAID. Because if anybody says anything other than what they've already said, then let him be accursed. &gt;&gt; If he's in line with the word, he's going to say what his daddy said. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If he's in line with the word, he's going TO SAY WHAT PAUL SAID. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be different. &gt;&gt; Right? Now, I'm not throwing off on Joseph Brham. I've never met him before. I love him. I believe he's my brother &gt;&gt; and I believe that we'll be there with him. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not throwing off on that. What I am doing is I will throw off on the spirit that would try and take him and exalt him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are people who are prophets who will be minor prophets. God will use them as a prophet to go and do something that he needs done. Maybe go right up and talk to someone and say, "Thus sayaith the Lord, you need to get this straight in your life." &gt;&gt; Don't doubt that for a second. &gt;&gt; If you ever hear that, you have that crossroad now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Either it's going to be false and that guy's a liar or it's going to be right on the money and you're going to know that you just heard from God. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean there's any change to the church age message. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a gift of prophecy that can be in the church and someone can have that gift and that gift is to profit the whole body with all. It is not for that person to actually become I'm prophetic now and everybody should watch it because I've got a gift and I could actually prophesy something that could come to pass and you better be afraid. That's not the way God does stuff. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a gift of prophecy that's in the church which is to be examined by the examiners before it can be told to the church. Of course, let it be before two or three judges and then it's told to her. So, we have the church age prophets. We have the major prophets in the Bible and and those are the prophetic offices. They're born prophets from their mother's womb. And then we have other people that have gifts of prophecy. And we know that gifts and callings are without repentance. But I think there's something really interesting here. We we might just take a little little minute or two and talk about it. There's a possibility for someone to have a prophetic gift and be under the influence of an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; Because brothers and sisters, we're either under the influence of the Holy Spirit or under the influence of an evil spirit. There's no middle ground, you know, kind of good spirits that aren't just really the Holy Spirit. It's one or the other. If it's not the Holy Spirit, it's an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; There's people that can have a gift of prophecy and be fully under the influence of an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; There's people that can have the gift of music &gt;&gt; and be under the influence of an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without repentance. People are born with the gifts in their lives. And what they do with that gift manifests the spirit that's actually living out through them. Amen. &gt;&gt; If they take their gift and offer it as the musicians do continually, service after service, they offer it to God as a sacrifice, as a free will offering, it demonstrates what spirit is influencing them. &gt;&gt; Their desire is to bring and set an atmosphere for the body of Christ. It's to profit every man with all. When we come into the building and we feel that atmosphere that that that spirit of God that's moving in the building, it's because people have dedicated their gifts back to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what these gifts are for, to profit every man with all. But there's the the major prophets and then there's the gift of prophecy. And the gift of prophecy is to profit the body to actually help. It's going to be something that benefits the body. You know, in second Peter, it says, "We have also a more sure word of prophecy." I think it's just amazing. We were in a Bible study last night and we're talking about worshiping worshiping. They're talking about out of the church. We're studying the church age book and we got into Satan's seat in in the Pergamian church age. And it's just such a powerful rich study. You could do it over and over and over and over and never ever get bored of the church age book. But we're talking about Satan's seed and the power of that. And you know how we we worship in spirit and in truth. And you know what age have people ever been able to worship in spirit and in truth like this age? There's never been an age, brothers and sisters. We'll say maybe the lid of hell has taken off and it's such a dark evil age and we've got so much persecution of all the spirits around. But you know we have such a manifestation of the spirit as well. &gt;&gt; It is not actually being wiped out. The spirit of God is not being snuffed out by the darkness in this world. In fact, the spirit of God is being magnified and amplified through the surrender of the bride in this age. It it's it's amazing to see it. We have also a more sure word of prophecy. We have been given the ability to worship. When Jesus met that woman at the well, he said,"Woman, you don't even know who you worship, but there's coming a day, I assure you, where people will worship, and they will worship in spirit and in truth." In fact, you know what? It's not even going to be possible to worship outside of worshiping in spirit and in truth. Jesus told that woman that, but there's a people he was speaking about, and I just can't help but think that's a group of people that would be around in the end time saying, "I believe the full word of God. I believe the seventh angel's message. We also have a more sure word of prophecy where unto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the dawn. Oh my. And the day star arise in your hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When that day star arises in our hearts, brothers and sisters, maybe it will be the Mount Zion showdown. We know the Mount Zion showdown is not going to be a third pole manifestation of seeing limbs restored. It's not going to be that. What that's going to be is actually the rapture. &gt;&gt; Well, all that's filthy just they're just going to be filthy still. They're not going to be able to be anything other than what they are. And whoever's holy is going to be holy. They're going to be in a body change. That's what's going to happen. And that's happening. It's happening right now. How is it happening? Day by day, every single time we eat this word and it actually changes our body. It changes our character. It's coming from the inside out. I think it don't you think it's amazing how it's coming from the inside and working its way out. &gt;&gt; We've heard it said many times, these bodies will not be able to contain the level of revelation that's coming. &gt;&gt; And what is that revelation? That revelation is that we are the word made flesh today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a time where the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. But now that word is made flesh and dwelling in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? It's so magnificent to think this day star is arising in our hearts. &gt;&gt; I I just it gets me excited. Talking about prophecy recognizing that it's a gift in the church. You know, in uh my goodness, 1964, I'm going to read this one and then we got another scripture here. I got to get going. Um 1964, the voice of the sign. Brother Brandham says, "Now we find out what Moses said come to pass." See, that made him a vindicated seer. That was his credentials. Here we go with the credentials again because what he said happened. He said, "About this time tomorrow, there will be fleas all over the ground." And there was. This time tomorrow, there will be so and so. And there was. It must hit exactly on the dot. Not just haphazard. &gt;&gt; Not just sometimes it's got to be exactly bullseye. &gt;&gt; So many men today, if you'll excuse this just for a minute, and I'm I'm no judge, just passing a personal opinion. Many man has raised up good spiritfilled men and they try go out. Maybe the Lord give them a gift of prophecy. Now, there's a million miles difference between a gift of prophecy and a prophet. &gt;&gt; A prophet fulfills exactly the word of God with thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A gift of prophecy does something a little bit different. He says it here, a gift of prophecy must be judged by three before it can even be passed into the church. So someone who might have a gift of prophecy according to what the prophet said. Now we all believe the prophet in the day in which we live. Hey everyone here in this church according to Calgary living word assembly we believe in the seventh angel message. So that means that a gift of prophecy must be judged by three before it can be passed into the church. We know it's the same as speaking in tongues. It must go before three judges before it can even be given to the church. This is not just what William Brandham said. This is what Paul the apostle said when he set out the pattern, the foundation for every single church age. &gt;&gt; He says now we find out now that these men go out sometimes and then people begin to press upon them. Oh brother, what will you say? See, he goes by impression. See the way he feels. Why the Lord will do that? Thus sayaith the Lord. That's a lie. See you. You can't say thus sayaith the Lord until God in his own language has spoke to you and told you that then it's not you saying it not your impression the Bible said if a prophet did that was going on presumptuously that is presuming and presuming is to adventure without authority he's going upon his own but when you see this is what brother Bradam is saying here this is the seventh angel messenger here saying these words. I believe the Holy Ghost through the messenger to the bride stored up food for a season, for this season. We take this food and we eat it up or not. But when you see the man speaking, what's going to happen in the name of the Lord? And it happens day in and out, week in and out, month in and out, year in and out, which is the ministry of William Mary and Brandham. that you know that come from God. See, &gt;&gt; that's God's credentials. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful to think that's God's credentials to the man that he is the interpreter of the written word for that day because God sent the man to do it. You know what I want to do tonight, brothers and sisters, is encourage us to remember that when we see the manifestation of these gifts in our lives, when we see our ability to say amen to the word, then we can see the credentials of God in our very own lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to see his credentials in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the ultimate credential is the ability for us to actually be transformed into a saint. To go from being a cuckle bird to being a wheat. How does that happen? by the renewing of our mind &gt;&gt; that we could be transformed into a new creature. Brother Brandham, he goes on to say, "If the churches only could have some good sound teaching on these things, see, they would understand it." &gt;&gt; I hope tonight and every night we talk about these gifts that this is good sound teaching because we're saying what he said. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; this is what he said. He says only thing we get a little a little we get one little track and we run excuse me like wild with it. &gt;&gt; That's just taking on that one thing and just making a hobby out of it. That's what every denomination originated from. &gt;&gt; Taking something and just running out there with it. You know, we talk about the gifts and and I hope that people don't think that we're taking the gifts and making a little hobby out of it. I'm not trying to do that. I'm trying to shine a light on it to say that that is a part of the body for the body &gt;&gt; and we mustn't be afraid of it. If we are afraid of it, I want to ask the question why. Why are we afraid of gifts? Why would we be afraid of gifts? It's part of the word of God. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. Let's turn over to first Corinthians chapter 13 tonight with the few minutes that we have left. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians chapter 13. Very familiar scripture, I'm sure. talking about the gift of prophecy and how important it is to recognize that we can have it, but there's something else that we need to have in order for that to actually be legitimate in our lives. Verse one of 1 Corinthians chapter 13, though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity, I become as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol. You know, once upon a time I I brought that picture up and I'll just try and paint the picture tonight of that little sometimes you'd see it as a little stuffed doll. And uh it's it's many times got little symbols and what it does is it just has symbols on its hands and it just claps. You can wind it up on the back and all it does is it just claps these symbols together and it's a kids toy. And you know, I just can't help but think about that every time I read this scripture here. What is charity? We know that charity is the Holy Ghost. Some people would say love. And truly, indeed, it is love. But it's more than love. It's truly the love of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not it's not ailio love. It's not human love. It's agape love. It's the the love of God. It's divine love. It's being, you know, able to actually line up with the word of God every single time. Even if it takes our hide, even if it hurts to say, "Be it unto me according to thy word." If we don't have that in our lives, doesn't matter whether we speak with the tongues of men and angels, does it? We have got to have charity in our lives. The Holy Ghost, as our brother prayed earlier, I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. And I love how Paul does this. He does it in such a way that he puts himself in the seat. He's not taking it and throwing it out there and saying, "You are a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol." He says it, "Though I, the age messenger, the one setting the pattern for all the ages, speak with tongues of men and angels, but have not charity, I am become as a sounding brass and a tingling symbol." And what's going to happen? You're going to hear that clapping of that symbol, and you're going to tune it out and think, "That's annoying. I don't want to hear that anymore. We don't want to do that with the scripture. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I HAVE ALL FAITH SO THAT I COULD REMOVE MOUNTAINS and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, &gt;&gt; and though I give my body to be burned, &gt;&gt; and have not charity, it profitth me nothing. Right. &gt;&gt; Charity, &gt;&gt; love, agape love, divine love, the literal life of Jesus Christ in our lives, in our marriages, in our relationships, in our body of believers, suffereth long. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And is kind. &gt;&gt; Charity envieth not. I don't want to go and do what someone else is doing. I I just want to stay in my lane. I want to stay exactly where God put me to be. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It envth not. Charity vaunteth not itself. Doesn't have to be the first. Doesn't have to be the best. Is not puffed up. Does not behave itself unseemly. Seekth not her own. is not easily provoked. Thinkketh no evil, rejoicth not in iniquity when I see that brother and I know that he's so wrong. Look at him. &gt;&gt; I know what he does. I know what he says. I know what he watches and what he listens to. I'm so glad that I don't do that. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; That's not according to the word of God. So, what spirit is influencing you to have those words? Amen. &gt;&gt; Rejoiceth not in iniquity. When we see that, we're going to go and pray for that person. &gt;&gt; We're going to try and encourage them and to say, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCORDING to the word. &gt;&gt; Not going to rejoice in it, &gt;&gt; but rejoicth in truth. &gt;&gt; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeeth all things, endureth most things. cuz you know some of them are really hard and I just can't really go that far you know there's just that that hurt that you know you don't know how much that hurt right you you don't know what I had to go through no right endureth all things &gt;&gt; able to endureth all things why is that because we're talking about charity &gt;&gt; charity is able to endureth all things we can't &gt;&gt; how on earth could you ever endure continually hearing brother Barry preach over and over and over again. But I'll tell you what, the Holy Ghost can do it in you. &gt;&gt; Charity never faileth. &gt;&gt; But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. &gt;&gt; Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. &gt;&gt; I think that's so good because you know our credentials, our credentials are worth nothing. They're dumb. His credentials though are everything. &gt;&gt; His credentials to a Christian believer are absolutely everything. That is what we're looking for in our lives. Verse 9 says, "For we know in part and we prophesy in part." Can you imagine Paul the Apostle writing these words and and and expressing his heart in the day in which he lives? We know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, when is that going to happen? Brothers and sisters, that's why I get so excited and that's why I'm excited tonight. When that which is perfect has come, when's that going to happen? Anybody know the day, the time, nobody knows the day or the hour when he's coming, right? To take his bride away. Nobody can put a pinpoint on that. But I can tell you one thing is for sure. And I'll say it this way, not because I have a gift of anything other than the ability to recognize the revelation of the open word in the day in which we live. When that which is perfect is come, it's already come, brothers and sisters. We have been given the full word, the opening of the word in the day in WHICH WE LIVE. THAT WHICH IS PERFECT IS COME. So when THAT WHICH IS PERFECT IS COME, THEN THAT WHICH IS IN PART SHALL BE DONE AWAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING FABLES. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AFTER DENOMINATIONAL WAYS. THAT WHICH IS PERFECT IS COME. THE FULL REVELATION OF THE WORD. That's what gives us the ability to worship in spirit and in truth is that revelation. Brothers and sisters, when we have that revelation, that revelation unlocks the full power of this word we're TALKING ABOUT. THE HOLY GHOST CAN worship through us in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; And when that happens, THAT'S WHEN VICTORIES ARE WON. THAT'S WHEN BATTLES are fought. That's when enemies are slaying. We can look back through the Old Testament. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. All of the victories were WON AT THE SHOUT OF PRAISE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; When that which is perfect is come, which is now. &gt;&gt; That which is in part shall be done away. I think this is so good. When I was a child, I spake as a child. And I understood as a child. I thought as a child, &gt;&gt; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. And I think it this way, brothers and sisters, when we read this here, we're not just talking about riding a a a tricycle. We're not talking about playing with the little windup doll that just claps the symbols. What we're talking about is recognizing the revelation that we're living under. &gt;&gt; Recognizing that we're no longer worshiping under partial truth. We're we're worshiping under the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is literally Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Manifesting in his bride body to this world in which we live in. When I was a child, I spake as a child. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. NOBODY ever told me that God sent a prophet. But one day I heard that God sent a prophet to this age. AND I SAID, "WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?" &gt;&gt; He could discern your heart. Hi. &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spake as a child. Ah, religion is all just money-making scheme. It's all a lie. The devil, they're all just living under a business. They all just want your money. I understood as a child, that's what everybody talked about. I even thought about it as a child. But when I became a man, I recognized charity. &gt;&gt; I recognized what was going on. That which is perfect is truly come. And I had to look around and say, "How many people in this world actually know this?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Is this just something that I've learned? &gt;&gt; And you look around and you see believers here in the body and and you look over there and you see believers over there in another body, but there's not many people that can recognize what we're talking about here. Many people will SAY, "BROTHER BARRY, YOU SOUND LIKE A FANATIC TONIGHT." AND I'M SO GLAD THAT I CAN SAY I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of these days they're going to look for us and we'll be gone. &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child. When I became a man, I put away all that childish stuff. I recognize there's nothing good in me. It's only that charity. It's only that word that Jesus Christ that has become manifest in flesh. Once again, &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Goes on to say this. Now we see through a glass darkly in the age in which he lived in. He knew that there was something else coming. We know that he knew it. We know that Daniel knew it. We know that John knew it. They all look for it. They all desired to see this. Even angels desired to look upon the seventh seal to see what William Brandham preached there in Jeffersonville, Indiana. And we can just take it and play it. &gt;&gt; We can just take it and read it. &gt;&gt; We can just talk about it. &gt;&gt; We can sing about it. But do we really really benefit from it? DO WE REALLY SEE THE LITERAL LIFE OF THE SEVENTH seal in our lives? I think it's so beautiful. Now we look through a glass darkly as Paul said. But then when &gt;&gt; But then when &gt;&gt; face to face, &gt;&gt; now I know in part. But then when then shall I know even as I also am known. Amen. My and now abideth faith, hope, and charity. these three, but the greatest of these is Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. I'll call the musicians as we close tonight. Brothers and sisters, there is a gift of prophecy. But we heard about it in the word tonight. It's going to hit the bullseye every single time. And if there is a gift of prophecy in the church, according to the scripture, there is. I'm not saying there is. But I'm just saying if there is, then it needs to happen exactly according to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; It has to be judged by witnesses in order for it to be legitimate. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. Maybe stand with me as we close. Gracious heavenly father, we're so thankful for the revelation that you have given us, Lord. &gt;&gt; The word for our day. We know that revelation is what unlocks our ability to worship you in spirit and in truth. And Father, we know that unless we're worshiping you in spirit and in truth, we're not even worshiping you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're worshiping Satan, the God of this evil age. And that is what your prophet said to us. That's what you said to us through your prophet. Oh Lord, help us to push aside all of our thoughts, all of our thinking, all of our carnality and traditions and just give way to you, Lord. That you could live out through us, that you could worship through us, that you could pray through us, that you could sing through us, that you could play music through us. Oh, Father, that you could live out through us every single day of our lives. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us to die to ourselves well. Help us to die to ourselves well, Lord Jesus. Father, that you could live. Oh, Father, we love you and we thank you for your word. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that we don't have to look for you. We know that you're here, oh Lord, in your fullness, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we're not looking through a glass darkly, &gt;&gt; but face to face. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to think about these things as we go to sleep tonight, Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; As we recognize how far down the road we really are, one of these days, someone's going to hit the button and all the bombs are going to drop. But father, before one of them can go off, you told us that we have a place already prepared for us. Oh father, you said you had to go away, that there will be many mansions for us. And we thank you for that revelation, Lord. Thank you for bringing us blessed assurance, Lord, that we know that we will not perish. &gt;&gt; Father, oh Lord, we thank you for the manifold revelation that you've given us. Thank you for your word. But most of all, Lord Jesus, thank you for you. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that you are alive and well, that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever, living out through your bride. &gt;&gt; We just ask now, Lord, that you would keep your hand upon us as we have to part ways one more time on this side of eternity. Lord, we don't know how many more times we'll be able to get together and worship. &gt;&gt; Father, you could call us home before this service is over, before we even make it back to our homes tonight. We don't know. But if it's your will for us to gather again on Sunday, Lord, we'll bring a song of praise, Lord. Father, we'll go and get ourselves good and ready to come and bring you a sacrifice of praise that you, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, is worthy of. &gt;&gt; Father, we love you tonight. And we thank you for your goodness. We pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us, Lord, as we go our separate ways. &gt;&gt; Father, watch over the Panettas, Lord. We ask in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song? Word of God ever true. &gt;&gt; Holy word. Holy word. Long preserved for our in this world. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the ancient words impart. Word of God, it's ever true. Changing me, changing you. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart. Words of life, words of hope, gives us strength, helps us in this world where we go. The word of God will guide us. Word of God ever true. Changing me. changing you. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart. Holy words of our faith handed down to this gave to us to sacriice. Only the faithful words of Christ changing me. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God. Our word of God. Word of God and true. Changing me, changing you. We have come with open heart. Oh, let the word of God. &gt;&gt; Can we sing the goodness of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. For your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hands. From the morning that I wake up till I lay my hand on the goodness of God. Amen. For all my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able I can see all the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have made me through the fire. In darkest night, you are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. I have been in the goodness of God all my life. Thank you, Lord. All my life you have been faithful even when I wasn't. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I have made, I will sing of the goodness of God. Amen. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. With my life laying down. I surrender now. I give you everything. Your goodness is running after. is running after me. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. Every breath that I am able I will sing of the goodness of God. There's nothing greater is there to sing of the goodness of God. Can we sing all in all as we dismiss tonight? You are my strength when I'm weak. You are my strength when I am weak. You are the treasure that I seek. You are my all in all. Seeking you as a preious jewel. I want the Holy Ghost to rule. You are my only worthy Jesus. Lamb of God, worthy is your name. Taking my sin, my cross, my shame. Rising again, I bless your name. You are my all in all. Thank you Jesus. When I am dry, you feel my cup. Lord, you are my all. All my blessings tonight. Amen. Jesus worthy. Worthy glory. Heat. Heat. just Someone school. Just Hallelujah. Jesus. All we pray. Holy Spirit.
