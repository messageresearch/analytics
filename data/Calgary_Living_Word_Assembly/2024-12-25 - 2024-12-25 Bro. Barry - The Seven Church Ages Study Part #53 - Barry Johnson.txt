of persecution to have the desire even is something else but to be able to do it to exercise that that that right is just something amazing that he's given us and just want to welcome you warmly tonight if you have a need maybe just make it known unto him by way of an uplift hand we have two requests that I wanted to bring and that is to remember Jesse honton he uh was diagnosed with a tumor and uh was given a terrible prognosis by the doctor they did an emergency operation and then he went back for a followup right after and they said now there's an infection so we want to remember Jesse honton and specifically that he would get well when the doctors would present death there is someone that can present life amen and I'll I'll I'll just share with you my desire is to be able to get together with him and express this gospel to him that there is a living God Amen and I'd also like to remember my Shan my cousin Shannon she uh is suffering from something the doctors can't put their finger on and uh once again it would sure be nice for her to see the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ we know that he could heal amen let's just go to him in prayer tonight Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we know that you are a living God and that is the the Keystone of the Bible and of the message that you are the same yesterday today and forever amenallah Lord Jesus we're so thankful that we can look back and see all that you've done father the children of Israel coming out of Egypt coming out of the world and Lord you parting the Seas for them and Lord all the many signs wonders and miracles you did for them and father we know that you positionally placed them in the land father and Lord Jesus we can look at the the prophets that you've sent Lord they delivered a a a sign so that they could capture the attention of the people and then you gave them a message a word oh father that they should get back to you father Lord Jesus we know there's a time where there's coming to be a a resurrection where we will meet with those people who have gone on before us father in the air oh Lord to be with you forever Lord Jesus we love those things but father help us now tonight to recognize that you are here with us the same one that's going to meet with us in the clouds is the same one that parted the waters oh Father for the children of Israel you haven't changed one iota father help us Lord Jesus to align ourselves with your word with your thought in Hebrews 138 that you are Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever father we thank you for this day Lord that you've given us it's a holiday father where we can change our lives and we can celebrate with family and Friends Lord oh Father and what can we celebrate but you father the Risen God the one that came in the form of a baby Lord that was oh Father unfit to be born in a hospital you had to come by the way of a a stable a stinking stable to be wrapped in a an ox cloth Lord Jesus wrapped in a swaddling cloth a filthy Rag and then placed in a Manger a place where they feed animals father so against the Jewish customs and traditions father but that's the God you are you come against our customs and our Traditions father and we're not here Lord Jesus tonight coming according to a custom or tradition but Lord we're here because we have something in our hearts Lord that wants to hear more about you father thereby knowing more about ourselves and father we know there's coming a day where this body will no longer contain that Revelation father tonight we just pray that we could bring our prayers and our requests Lord Jesus unto you father each need that was made known unto you tonight by way of an uplift hand father we commit it into your hands Lord whether it's present here tonight or whether it's virtual Lord or even afterwards Lord as a recorded message we know that you're not bound by time or space we commit the needs into your hands father Lord tonight we want to remember Shannon Dean my cousin Lord Jesus father we pray that Lord you would just heal her in the name of Jesus we want to remember oh Lord Jesus Jesse he Lord father the doctors have nothing but death to offer him Lord Jesus but father we know that you have life father we don't have to die we can live father we pray that he would be able to hear this message of Life father Lord Jesus we just want to commit the needs made known tonight into your hands father For Your Glory and we'll be careful to give you all the praise Lord Jesus father we love you and we thank you and we just Commit This service into your hands now For Your Glory every single aspect of it Lord in jesus' name we pray amen amen amen thank you musicians thank you each one if you have your Bibles tonight we just like to read the next Church age as we continue on our study and the exposition of the seven Church ages we just like to welcome our visitors in our gates brother Nicholas God bless you good to see your face again Brother David and family certainly wonderful to have you here with us as well Brother David is a a deacon I believe at the Saskatoon Tabernacle and uh certainly wonderful to just be able to gather together in his name the name above every name the Lord Jesus Christ just want to turn over to Revelations chapter 3 verse 14 Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the leoan write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither hot nor cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent amen behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne amen even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne amen he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord tonight we just ask that you would give us ears to hear what your spirit would say to the church tonight father Lord help us each one to just get out of the way and just give you the preeminence that you desire father through the speaker and the hearer alike we just want to commit all the words that are spoken now the scripture that we've read into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated isn't it wonderful to think that alls we have to do is just open the door just be zealous and repent that's all we need to do not be be Brazen and bold and have a PR that says I'm good I I don't need to do anything I can just stay the way I am right it's just wonderful to think that he gives us correction and we know that the correction that he gives us is what we need and uh the way we receive that correction is how we show whose child we really are amen we know that Cain and Abel they both had a revelation they both went to church they both worshiped one brought a worship worship according to his Revelation another brought a worship according to his Revelation whose Revelation was right you know both of them were Revelations and even though one was wrong one wasn't accepted there was correction brought and the correction is what showed who was who amen it's a tremendous thing because we can all have Revelation but it's the correction that brings the truth amen it's wonderful I just love this uh scripture we're into the leoan church age um we would say probably many ways that this is our church age and we know that this started in sort of Our Generation we know that this applies to us in the age in which we live there's a lot of wealth there's never been this much wealth being transferred in in modern history there's never been so much opportunity there's never been so much um I would say probably exposure around the world for what people are doing and everybody wants to behave the same way we live in a sort of a global Community now because of all of the social all of the online stuff and uh you know we we can look at this this scripture and say that that's where we are I I think it's beautiful though because you know I'm just going to preach a little I hope that's okay tonight I'm probably not going to try to keep us late I I recognize this is Christmas and for some it's it's probably the only day off the only holiday that you have I just wanted to make sure that we had the doors open if there were people that wanted to come to church we could gather together in Fellowship I also understand that we have commitments with families and that's okay too God richly bless you each one but looking at this scripture in Revelations chapter 3 is a beautiful thing because it is the leoan church age talking about the last of the seven Church ages the seventh age which is a culmination of all the ages and we could say that's where we live but we know that at the end of the ministry in the life of the Vindicated Prophet that we follow he began to speak different words he did not talk about staying in the leodan church age he spoke about another age and that is the bride age amen he spoke about moving into the bride age and I I think probably we're going to wind up preaching about this in the near future but if you turn the page in your Bible or you just go to the next chapter the very next word after where we left off in Revelations 3: 22 Revelations CH 4 it says after this I look John being a type of the bride and behold a door was opened in heaven and we know this door that was open in heaven why was it open in heaven the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and we know brother Bram talks about this very very clearly in the message of the hour and immediately I was in the spirit this is going right back to the very beginning of the church age book the exposition of the seven Church ages this bride age is calling a church out of a church it's calling a bride out of the the regular church that we would call the nominal Church on Earth and she's called to a greater Revelation according to the scripture here many people will look at it and say that John maybe he had a beach chair and he had some smart water and he was sitting on the beach having a good time on the aisle of patmas for the testimony of Jesus Christ but he wasn't sitting in a lawn chair on a beach somewhere he was suffering he was living in a cave in a den this is a place that more more desperate criminals were positionally placed when they didn't know what to do with them we know that John was boiled in oil for 24 hours trying to do way with this guy but God wasn't done with him yet because he had a a whole Revelation that he had to get into him that he had to express but he was told to come a little higher and I just think that's exactly the same for the bride Age The Bride of Jesus Christ isn't told to stay in the leodan church age amen amen we can look at this and say Well it applies to us we could be rich increase with Goods have need of nothing know us not that we're we're naked we're blind we're wretched we're poor we don't don't even know it but do we is that where we are brothers and sisters if that's where we are I think we've missed the message of the hour the message of the hour has become a traditional teaching to us we've been told to come a little higher and it doesn't make us better than anybody what it does is it gives us more humility because we recognize there's nothing that we did right he's done it all amen I probably shouldn't get preaching here but I just want to it's Christmas prise the Lord Merry Christmas amen let's begin talking about the leodan church age out of the exposition of the seven Church ages it's page 363 of the red book um the leodan church age and unto the angel of the Church of the leod Deans write these things saith amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God as I was studying this I was just thinking isn't it wonderful to think that there's a faithful and true witness that's the bride today amen I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou work cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with THV that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches just beautiful the city of leoda the name leoda which means people's rights was very common and was given to several cities in honor of Royal ladies so named this city was one of the most politically important and financially flourishing cities in Asia Minor enormous amounts of property were bequeathed to the City by prominent citizens it was the seat of a great Medical School its people were distinguished in Arts and Sciences it was often called the Metropolis as it was the county seat for 25 other cities the pagan God worshiped there was Zeus in fact this city was once called diolis city of Zeus in honor of their God in the 4th Century an important Church Council was held there frequent earthquakes finally caused its complete abandonment how fitting were the characteristics of this last age to represent the age in which we now live for example they worshiped one God Zeus who was the chief and father of the Gods this forecast the 20th century one God father of us all religious premise that sets forth the Brotherhood of Man and is even now bringing together the Protestants Catholics Jews Hindus Etc with the intent with the intent that a mutual form of worship will increase inrease our love understanding and care of each other now I apologize because it's Christmas I just have to do something here bear with me I forgot to send an email I sent an email to you Logan I do apologize I did mean to send that but uh I just thought it would be interesting to just look at this tonight the Catholics and the Protestants are even now striving for and actually gaining ground in this Union with the avowed intent that all others will follow this very attitude was seen in the United Nations organization when the world leaders refused to recognize any one individual concept of spiritual worship but recommended putting aside all those separate Concepts with the hopes that all religions become leveled into one for all desire the same goals all have the same purposes and all are basically right did that come through excellent so notice the name leod deia the people's rights or Justice of the peoples was there ever an age like the 20th century Church age that has seen all nations rising up and demanding equality socially and finan financially this is the age of the Communist where all men are supposedly equal though it is only in theory right boy there's a train coming must be the Christmas train do you have that uh that picture I got two pictures that I wanted to bring up what brother bradam is talking about here is so interesting there's uh a church call it a church there's a organization a building that's called abrahamic house and I'm sure that we're all familiar with it but if you're not I just wanted to bring these up and and just show you the Wikipedia version of it it's interesting because it's right there in plain sight and what it is is the worship of the Jews of the Catholics and the Protestants I believe so yeah I think it's just uh pretty amazing thing I'm just going to read this here the abrahamic house abrahamic family house it's called is an Interfaith complex on Sadat Island in Abu Dhabi the undertaking was inspired by the document on human fr fraternity I haven't read that document but I think that would be an interesting study the document on human fraternity signed by Pope Francis on behalf of the Catholic church and ammed El tab on behalf of the Alazar mosque on 4th February 2019 in Abu Dhabi it houses the St Francis Church Imam alab mosque and Moses Ben mayam synagogue in separate separate structures and if you uh can see the picture there it's interesting and if you just go to the next slide it shows kind of the relationship where it is in terms of I don't know if this will work here Israel can you see the map Israel is just just a little ways over there it's just interesting to see that this is actually right there in the midst of the Middle East amen this abrahamic house that the pope is on board with and uh we know that Pope is still seated in uh in action and we know what is behind the pope but just in terms of what brother bradam is talking about I'll just go back to the beginning of this last paragraph here notice the name leosia the people's rights or Justice of the peoples was there ever an age like the 20th century Church age that has seen all nations rising up and demanding equality socially and financially this is the age of the communist where all men are supposedly equal though it is only in theory and it really is only in theory you can see some of the stuff going on in the world now how people are demanding equal rights but don't touch my stuff don't touch my money and you know the idea of defund the police and all that business oh my but what's going to happen if somebody kicks in someone's door they'll be the ones saying defund the police because it's great let's all be equal but at the same time what they'll do is turn around and dial 911 for police right it's only in theory even the prophet said it you know uh this is the this is the age of political parties who call themselves Christian democrats now for those people who have ever discussed politics with brother Barry you know where I'm going with this there's no such thing yeah and Christians socialist it'd be like a Christian liberal there's no such thing Christian Commonwealth Federation Etc according to our liberal theologians Jesus was a socialist and the early church under the guidance of the spirit practiced socialism and thus we ought to do so today we know that's not true that's right when the Ancients called leod deia the Metropolis it was looking forward to the One World Government that we are now setting up as we think of that City being the location of a great church Council we see for shadow The ecumenical move taking place today wherein very soon we will see all the so-called Christians come together and you know brothers and sisters like we put up there that's Wikipedia you can see that whether people actually agree with it or not it doesn't matter the leaders have already pledged allegiance to the crown the Triple Crown of the Roman Catholic church amen so the people who actually fall under all of the other leaderships that have kissed the ring they automatically fall under that spiritual blessing or curse depending on how you look at it depending on what's gone on and and that's why there's only really going to be one one maybe even one and a half groups of people that will actually make it and and only one group will make it in the in the resurrection and Rapture and that's the people that recognize the Jesus Christ of today that are not falling under a category that's kissing the Ring of Rome if we're doing that we're missing what what what actually has taken place I think it's just amazing because you know um years ago brother Ken he played a video in here and I tried to find it I wanted to play it I might still see if I can get my hands on it because I think it's very important to see brothers and sisters there was a man named Anthony Palmer who is since deceased but he actually was a friend of Pope Francis before he became Pope he is from South Africa this this fella and uh you know he talks uh about what's going on what's actually happening and how there was the protest of Luther protested the Catholic Church way back when that was Halloween night uh somebody know the date I know it was Halloween night I can't remember the date date it was it was 1400s when he protested the Catholic church but what happened then there was the protest that's when the Protestants the protesters moved away from the Catholic faith and and and the protest was that the just shall live by faith not by some instruction from a pope there was a trust in God at that point and we know that it was it was a it was a a little tiny light that God allowed to to come into that church age but this Anthony Palmer now 10 years ago this video came out and he said that I was friends with this Pope I actually was with the Pope I became closer friends since he became the Pope I thought that I would be further away but I became closer friends with him and I I I I was with him and he wanted to record a video on my iPhone and he records a video with the Pope Francis on his iPhone and basically he's calling for Unity between all Christian faiths All Peoples of the earth let's come together and worship is one we're more alike than we are different aren't we and and he preaches a a little message on his iPhone and talks about how this is coming together and and then this man Anthony Anthony Palmer he addresses all of The ecumenical churches in the states the big names Kenneth Copeland I don't know the rest of them some people might know more than I but in this video he says that you know what that Luther protest is over the lutherans have actually agreed to actually sign off on that protest and declare it done now we actually have come back to Rome and he talks about Catholic being uh Universal right and we're all alike if we're Christians so if that protest is over then where's your protest he talks about this in this video this is 10 years ago or more even yes 10 years was the video that I saw the little tiny one but you know what he talks about in there I think it's so amazing because words m in that video he talks about something called spiritual racism I thought my goodness that is powerful because if you go and make yourself exclusive then you're being racist spiritually speaking aren't you but the word of God does the separating isn't that wonderful to think we don't have to do it the word of God does when that correction comes where do we stand right amen do we defy it or do we accept it because our Defiance to the word of God shows what spirit is influencing us but I thought that was powerful spiritual racism if I don't get the video if you want to look it up look up Anthony Palmer and you can see maybe a couple or three different videos the one the main video that showed the beginning the main part and then his little followup I couldn't find it all in one maybe someone that's smarter than me could do that but it's pretty amazing to look at how this is coming from Rome the protest is over brothers and sisters it's been over for a long time and we had a prophet in our land saying that it's later than you think amen yes 60 years ago where do we stand tonight why Christmas Christmas night 2024 Where Do We Stand he says this is the age of the political parties who call themselves Christian democrats and Christian socialists and Christian Commonwealth Federation Etc according to our liberal theologians Jesus was a socialist and the early church under the guidance of the spirit practice socialism and thus we ought to do so today when the Ancients called Leo DEA the Metropolis it was looking forward to the One World Government that we are now setting up as we think of that City being the location of a great church Council we see foreshadowed The ecumenical move taking place to today wherein very soon we will see all the so-called Christians come together indeed the church and state religion and politics are coming together the tears are being bound the wheat will soon be ready for the Garner it was a city of earthquakes such earthquakes as finally destroyed it this age will end in God shaking the whole world Amen that has gone off to make love with that old Harlot not only will the World Systems crumble but the very Earth will be shaken and then renovated for the millennial reign of Christ amen the city was rich endowed by the wealthy it was full of culture science abounded how like today the churches are rich the worship is beautiful and formal but cold and dead I say brothers and sisters we don't ever want to get too stuffy with our worship we don't ever want to get too formal with it we don't ever want to get too professional with it we want to be able to Worship in spirit and in truth amen the worship is beautiful and formal but cold and dead let us never get that way culture and education have taken the place of the spirit-given word and faith has been superseded by S so that man is a victim of materialism my in every attribute ancient leoda is found reborn in the 20th century leodan age in every attribute wow in the mercy of God May those who have an ear to hear come out of her that they be not partakers of her sins and the consequence quent judgment the leoan age the leoan age began around the turn of the 20th century perhaps in 1906 how long will it last as a servant of God who has had multitudes of visions of which none has ever failed let me predict I've got that highlighted let me predict amen there's something about this prediction though brothers and sisters let me predict I did not say prophesy but predict this age will end around 1977 the Leo Dean age what was it that this Prophet began to say back in 1965 just about 10 years earlier what was it it was the bride age amen he never mentioned it before 1965 the end of his ministry just before he went off the air amen 59 years later I think it's amazing here we have the prophet in our day in the rising of the sun was the first time he mentioned it in 1965 he mentions bride age but you know I just can't help but think the thing about this is it's exactly like Jesus in his day they were thinking something great was going to happen something fantastic was going to happen happened if you talk to people sorry if you talk to people who have been around much longer than I have there was people having communion services on the 31st of 19 uh 76 on the 31st thinking something was going to take place something really significant Naturally Speaking was going to take place here we have a prophet predicting something is going to happen but it was a spiritual happening just like Jesus day we know that he came in the flesh but he was not exactly the way they thought it should be it didn't fit their religious Behavior so whoa we had to step back just like 1977 it wasn't exactly the way the people were thinking they were led to believe somehow some way that it was going to happen a certain way and you know brother bradam he says it very clearly that it was the teaching it was the way the pulpits spoke to the people that caused people to think that it should happen a certain way what we need to do is make sure that we're aligned with the word and think that you know when we think that it's going to happen a certain way ain't going to happen that way we need to be ready to be in line with the word because then we'll be right that's the only ones that will be right the lean age began around the turn of the 20th century perhaps in 1906 how long will it last as a servant of God who has multitude of Visions which none has ever failed let me predict I did not say prophesy but predict that this age will end around 1977 not on 1977 around 197 77 if you will pardon a personal note here I base this prediction on seven major continuous visions that came to me one Sunday morning in June 1933 now it gets interesting doesn't it amen the Lord Jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh amen but that before he came seven major events would transpire I just think it's beautiful it wasn't six events was it it wasn't six Thunders it wasn't six seals it was seven seven major events would transpire I wrote them all down and that morning I gave forth the revelation of the Lord the first Vision was that musolini would invade Ethiopia and that Nation would fall at his steps that Vision surely did cause some repercussions and some were very angry when I said it and would not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there with his modern arms and took over the natives didn't have a chance but the vision also said that musolini would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him that came to pass just exactly as it was said and I just want to encourage anyone to go and look this up in Natural History I'm not going to be be a a historian tonight I don't want to do that but I just want to say that if you have any questions about this take a look at what Wikipedia has to say the next Vision foretold that an Austrian by the name of Adolf hit remember this was 1933 amen this was in 1933 the next Vision foretold that an Austrian by the name of Adolf Hitler would rise up as dictator over Germany and that he would draw the world into war it showed the sigfreed line and how art troops the US troops would have a terrible time to overcome it then it showed that Hitler would come to a mysterious end does anybody know exactly what happened to Hitler those people that have looked into it they know the third Vision was in the realm of world politics for it showed me that there would be three great isms fascism Nazism and communism but that the first two would be swallowed up in the third The Voice admonished watch Russia watch Russia keep your eye on the King of the North and isn't it interesting because we know when he spoke this in 1933 Russia was not Russia Russia was the USSR that's right and people said immediately well you're wrong but he didn't they didn't know right this was a Prophet this was a prophet of God speaking foretelling something that's going to come to pass right if they would have known that there would be a man sitting on the throne in Russia like there is tonight hey there he is tonight and we know there's there's there's words that talk about someone just having a little bit too much vodka and just pushing a button and watch out the fourth Vision showed the great advances in science that would come after the second world war it was headed up in the vision of a plastic bubble toop car that was running down beautiful highways under remote control so that people appeared seated in this car without a steering wheel and that they were playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves it's amazing to look at this because we know that this hasn't actually landed in mainstream life yet we know that there's a few things that need to be worked out for it to naturally take place but there are cars that will operate on their own there's a lot of loading and unloading at at shipyards that's autonomous there isn't people driving the trucks unloading and and loading we know that there's there are cars moving around there's buses moving around that are actually autonomous but it hasn't become like the Jetson where it's every single vehicle on the road is just working on its own and I think many times people read this or hear this and think that that's really the way it's supposed to be and maybe it will get that way but I know that you can look up and find a video that will show a vehicle that is very close to the description that we're talking about here very very close and there's people that have fallen out of the message of the hour by looking at false Doctrine trying to actually come against the message of the hour and showing all the different cars that are on the roads and and sure enough there's no no bubble top plastic bubble top cars going down the roads well it doesn't have to be it can simply be maybe a a commercial maybe it's actually something that's happened you know uh this guy Elon Musk he actually isn't afraid to get into an autonomous car and let the car take him to where he's going who knows how far it'll go the point that I'm getting to is those people that get upset because they can't see it they're looking for a natural occurrence for a spiritual situation don't do that look to the word get that word inside of you and when this body change happens then you'll go but to say oh no as soon as I see a bubble top car going down the road then I'm going to believe you missed the entire point of the message of the hour it's not to see a sign or wonder it's not to play uh some sort of show God doesn't clown for nobody he showed this Vision to show the advances in science and and to show that there's coming a time where this this will take place and I'm pretty sure that some where in the world that this has already taken place and it doesn't have to be in the public eye it's irrelevant whether it is or it isn't the prophet said he saw it and and some people can believe it the fifth Vision had to do with the moral problems of our age man this is where it gets a little bit tight centering mostly around women God showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote that's serious now now we can start getting in trouble with the granting of the vote they had a voice then they cut off their hair which signified that they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights I I could say a lot but I'm not going to I'm just going to Simply say this this is what the prophet of God said said we know what the word of God says and women are not supposed to be doormats they never were and they're never supposed to be and that's not what he's talking about here but there came a time where women were granted the right to vote and when that happened it changed everything didn't it she adopted men's clothing she cut her hair first so she showed that she was dishonoring her head then she adopted man's clothing which is an Abomination and went into a state of undress until the last picture I saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with this Vision I saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world then in the sixth Vision There Rose up in America a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power I believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to a popular vote by women again some folks are looking for a woman president what difference does it make if there's a woman president is that going to change anything about what we believe we would like to see a a clear top plastic clear top bubble car going down the road to say see that's what the prophet said and I know we would like to be able to say see there's a woman president but wouldn't you like to see the dead in Christ raised up and to be able to say see everything that I've ever believed is now taking place in front of me we don't want to look for natural signs and wonders to vindicate whether we believe the last and seventh Vision was wherein I heard a most terrible explosion and I turned turned to look as I turned to look I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of America based on these seven Visions along with the rapid changes which have swept the world in the last 50 years I predict I do not prophesy interesting how he says this yes twice he said it exactly this way I predict I do not prophesy that these Visions will have all come to pass by 1977 who knows whether the the the technology was happening in a scientific lab somewhere maybe in a a foreign land and and nobody actually saw it happen who knows and though many feel that this is an irresponsible statement in view of the fact that Jesus said no man knoweth the day or the hour I still maintain this prediction after 30 years because Jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week amen hallelujah can you imagine that amen year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so now I don't want anybody to go and start doing math don't go start doing math to say that this week this month this year he's coming it's not up to us to know that no man knoweth the day or the hour except the father amen so I repeat sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world's systems and Usher in the Millennium amen now this is where I jump back to Revelations chapter 4 some people have been called up a little hither haven't they they've been called up a little hither there there ain't just six seals open to those people all seven seals are actually open and all of the revelations all of the loose ends in the Bible have been wrapped up and handed to them righten because what did the prophet say all that Adam lost has been restored amen the mind of Christ has been restored think about all the people that were there with Adam all the way up until the flood the knowledge that they must have had the stories that they must have heard sitting around the fire with Papa Adam all of the knowled of God as the Son of God goodness but all that he lost has been restored brothers and sisters my now let me say this can anyone prove any of these Visions wrong were they not all fulfilled yes each one has been fulfilled or is in the process right now musolini invaded Ethiopia successfully then fell and lost it all Hitler started a war he could not finish and died mysteriously communism took over both the other two isms the plastic bubble car has been built and is awaiting only a better network of roads they need 5G women are all but naked and are even now wearing topless bathing suits and you know what in the City of Calgary it's mandated that you can actually go that way in in the Leisure centers it's actually in writing it's legal to do in Calgary and just the other day I saw in a magazine the very dress that I saw in my vision if you call it a dress it was a plastic transparent type of cloth with three darkened spots that covered both breasts in a small area and then there was a dark place like a small apron below the Catholic church is on the rise amen we have had one Catholic President and will no doubt have another what is left nothing EX except Hebrews 12:26 whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven isn't it interesting to think that there was a time and it was it was it was an amazing time the prophet was up in a Box Canyon and what happened he said that God called him and and and he told his friends that were around him to get under something right quick and one of the brothers started to talk to him and he said don't talk get under something what happened God's voice came and shook the whole earth and told him that judgment is pending and we know that that was Easter Easter morning it was it was it wasn't Easter it was actually Good Friday that Alaska almost sank right after that we know there's coming another Resurrection another Rapture H H uh uh another earthquake that's going to shake this whole world first he said he would shake the Earth people are looking to see a natural shaking there was already right Alaska shook don't look for California to slip in the ocean and then you'll believe H you might slip in the ocean with it if you do right it was the voice of God that shook the Earth it was the voice of God that took the trees halfway down in that box canyon that caused all of those little triangular-shaped rocks that people so highly covet that want to have as paper on their desk to say that they've been there to that place where the Prophet was where God spoke to him that was the voice of God that caused all of that to happen that was what shook the Earth brothers and sisters people are looking for the natural shaking don't do it the word of God is already Shook Up This World all you got to do is speak to someone who is a trinitarian a ston trinitarian about this message and see how shaken it becomes amen that's all you got to do once more God will shake the Earth and with it shake everything loose that can be shaken then he will renovate it amen just last March 1964 that Good Friday earthquake of Alaska shook the whole world though it did not unbalance it but God was warning by a world Tremor what he will soon do on a greater scale he's going to blast and rock this sin cursed world my brother my sister and there is only one place I love this part there is only one place that can stand that shock it's not an underground bunker it's not a carefully welded uh a stone-built concrete place that a man has created we know that they're going to hide in the dens and the rocks of the caves and say hide us from the face of him that's pouring out his wrath upon this Earth he says there is only one place that can stand that shock and that is in the fold of the Lord Jesus amen and I would say it's the Lord Jesus the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ himself it's not hiding in a natural circumstance he says and I would beseech you while God's Mercy is still available to you that you give your whole life unreservedly to Jesus Christ who was the faithful Shepherd will save you and care for you and presents you faultless in glory with exceeding great joy amen my the messenger I doubt very much if any age truly knew the messenger that God had sent unto it except that in the first age where Paul was the messenger and even in that age many did not recognize him for what he was now the age in which we are living is going to be a very short one events are going to transpire very rapidly so the messenger to this leoan age has to be here now amen this is 1964 and 65 this was actually published it was published in ' 65 released but being created in ' 64 and and has to be here now though perhaps we don't know him as yet but there will surely have to be a time that he becomes known now I can prove that because we have a scripture that describes his ministry once again points right back to the word not my own not going to go into my own encyclopedia off the shelf and give you my own words that God gave me to make an addendum to his word no right back to the word I got a scripture for it first of all that messenger is going to be a prophet which means messenger he will have the office of a prophet Propet now that's where that messenger has a bit of a special place he will have the prophetic Ministry it will be based solidly on the word because when he prophesies or has a vision it will always be word oriented and it will always come to pass and we know that there's been so many I'll say it charlatans that have come around ones that have maybe had some prophecy I prophesy this thus and thus such and such and and it happens my but then they do it again and it doesn't happen what does the word of God say about those men exactly it says don't hear them amen that's all you don't listen to them because they're hit or miss right right yes and the ones that are hit or miss and and you know we can say well they hit on 10 but they missed one or or nine and they miss one out of 10 they're running 90% that's pretty good but not a prophet amen a prophet is going to be 10 out of 10 amen and we know that was the case here he will be a vind he will be Vindicated as a prophet because of his accuracy the proof that he is a prophet is found in Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound not when he shall end to sound when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets I just love how he goes into describing this person now this person who is in this ver who is in this verse is called an angel in the King James version it is not a Heavenly being the sixth trumpeting Angel who is an Heavenly being is in Revelations 9:13 and in the seventh of like order is in Revelations 11:15 there is an Angelic being and it's interesting because there's some that speculate that Angelic seventh being is actually William Bram there's a quote for that I'll bring sometime in the future not tonight though it's interesting though this one here in Revelations 10:7 is the seventh age messenger and it is a man and he is to bring a message from God and his message and Ministry is going to finish the mystery of God as declared to his servants the prophets think about all of those sages and Prophets and angels from all of the past ages that have desired to look upon this book that we're reading tonight my goodness God is going to treat this last Messenger as a prophet because he is a prophet amen amen that is what Paul was in the first age and that last age has won too isn't it wonderful to think that it just doesn't change this Prophet that we claim to follow he said I preach what Paul preached amen some people will say well when you come against women you're actually you guys you know what it's not you guys it's what Paul preached amen and we just stick to what Paul preached amen if the world would just stick to what Paul preached it would be a better place am but people can't stand that correction the correction it shows who is who it shows what spirit is in us if the word of God brings correction what do we do if that's what the word of God says that's what Paul says Where Do We Stand tonight brothers and sisters Amos 3 6-7 shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall the message of the Lord not come through a prophet to be the shout as we heard about on Sunday and the people not be afraid my shall there be shall there be evil in a city and the Lord hath not done it my surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his Secrets unto his servants the prophets amen I love how he just lays this out it's so clear it was in this end time period that the seven thunders of Jesus came forth Revelations 10: 3:4 and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not that's where many people will say the devils in the details when did those those seven thund ERS that were John was told we can agree on that that John was told to seal them up but when were they opened what happened on Sunset Mountain am Hallelujah 1963 what was in those Thunders no one knows but we need to know and it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet am it's just so easy and so clear if we could just stick to the word of God his program we just read Amos 3:7 and and surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his Secrets unto his servants the prophets the word always came by a prophet and always will and isn't it beautiful what happened in the River Jordan when John the Baptist was there baptizing by the Revelation that he was given brother Brandon brings it out real clearly in the message he said that John never went looking for Jesus he had a revelation that there was one there was one standing among you right now who I'm not even worthy to do the latches on his shoes man this one is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world and I know that he's standing here right now I'm just waiting to see him with my own eyes but he never looking for Jesus by that Revelation when Jesus came to the prophet that was the word made flesh came to the prophet amen exactly according to the word of God Amen he doesn't change amen the word always came by a prophet and always will right not by a school not by a degree no not by liberal theologians no way no University uh-uh it's not happening that is how the law of God is evident by even a casual search of the scripture the unchanging God with unchanging ways invariably sent his profit in every age where the people had strayed from divine order with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word God always sent his servant to these people but aart from the theologians in order to correct the false teaching and lead the people back to God so we see a seventh age messenger coming and he is a prophet not only do we see this messenger coming here in Revelations 107 but we find that the word speaks of Elijah coming before Jesus returns amen it's always like this right where I want to start preaching amen hallelujah we're running out of time and his disciples asked him saying why then saith the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things Matthew 1710 to11 before the coming of the Lord Elijah must come back for a work of restoration in the church we know this is scripture this isn't something we're trying to make up here excuse me this is what Malachi 4 says Malachi 45 and6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so when is that going to happen now we know it I know I'm preaching to the choir here but I know there's also people that potentially will be listening that don't know that Wonder there's going to be people that are watching and listening that will say well you know John the Baptist fits some of that scripture and then Jesus finishes the rest of it I actually had a a good discussion with some Jehovah's Witnesses that come to my house fairly regular and uh we got into a real good discussion about this exact scripture and they believe that Jesus was the Fulfillment of the latter part but we know that it wasn't Jesus that fulfilled that and it wasn't Jesus that fulfilled the first part of it it was John the Baptist and it was brother brandham amen he goes on to say there is absolutely no doubt that Elijah must return before the coming of Jesus he has a specific work to accomplish that work is the part of Malachi 46 that says he will turn the hearts of the children to their fathers the reason that we know this is his specific work to do at the time is because he has already accomplished the part that says he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children when the Elijah Ministry was here in John the Baptist amen Luke 1:17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just and to make ready a people prepared for the Lord now I'm going to preach on the five comings of Elijah but I don't know if I'll be able to tonight there's five comings it's un important to understand it the Elijah anointing this this is a very important uh part of scripture that I think many times is overlooked and and I just want to say this that you know out of Matthew 17 Jesus when he went up to Mount Transfiguration who did he see on on top of the mountain who did the disciples see on top of the mountain with with Jesus es saw Moses and elah Elijah amen Matthew 17:9 and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and the disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer them what does the next verse say then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist amen he didn't come out and say it it was revelation but it was Elias that he said why did he say that because in in the scripture we just read Luke 1:17 that he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of who Elias Elijah there was an anointing that happens we know that there was the the anointing of Elijah then there was the anointing of Eli Elisha Elijah told him if you see me when I go up you can have what you ask amen we know that he just believed in him and he said heyy I want a double portion of what it is you got and how many of us wouldn't say the same testimony tonight oh my let me have a double portion of that same spirit in the power Spirit of Elias which is the Lord Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost he's the same yesterday today forever but we know that Elisha he actually wouldn't be distracted he tried to distract him he said just wait here I could go on about this one but but he wouldn't be distracted he said if you see me when I go you can have what you asked he saw him when he went so he got what he asked and that was the mantle of Elijah he picked it up but what did he do he went back to the waters and said where's the god of Elijah let me see that same God in my life and I think it's the same thing for us tonight brothers and sisters don't be bashful to say that where is the god of Elijah we have seen the Elijah anointing in our age through William Mary and Bram amen we know it was John the Baptist it was sorry it was Elijah Elisha John the Baptist William Mary and Brenham and then there's going to be another one and that's going to be one of the two witnesses that come to Israel amen are we going to be here to see them I don't think so but what difference does it make we've seen the anointing of Elijah in William Mary and brown amen and it's absolutely beautiful I better call the musicians in the ministry of John the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children we know that because Jesus said so isn't that beautiful the Theologian Never Said So William Mary and bradam never said so Jesus said so but it does not say that the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers that has yet to take place and I say glory to God it's already taking place isn't it Hallelujah isn't it taking place Hallelujah the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers John got the fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the children into the fold now this Prophet upon whom the spirit of Elijah Falls will prepare the children to welcome back Jesus Jesus called John the Baptist Elijah amen Matthew 17:12 but I say unto you that Elias has come already amen hallelujah and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed God bless you tonight tonight I'll stop there maybe stand with me as we close the service it's just an incredible incredible study to know exactly where we stand to have the understanding the Revelation about what God's done for us in our lives are you grateful tonight we just would like to also bring a note from the Livy the livsey family they said that we are grateful to the Lord for 5 years in Canada today amen God bless you all from the Livy family amen we all come from somewhere and it's certainly wonderful to be gathered together in the fold of Jesus Christ as we read tonight let's just close in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your Tender Mercies to each and every one of us Lord to think that we are able to look upon what John was told to seal up father that we're able to look upon what Daniel desired to to know and to see but was told to just go about his life to just go on his way because it was for another age oh Father and we know that this is the age and and this is the people and father you have given us the opportunity Lord by Revelation to look on these things father we're so thankful we can never give you the praise and the glory that you deserve but we do say thank you Lord we know there's many different gifts and and and celebrations going on but we know the

miracle that could ever take place on Earth outside of you rising from the dead from the grave and that is to see that a sinner could be turned into a saint Lord Jesus that Hearts could be turned back oh father that the hearts of the children could be turned back to the faith of the Pentecostal father others that's the greatest miracle that we could ever see in our days and we thank you for that Lord thank you for the many manifold Revelations that you've given us Lord Jesus thank you for the many ministries of your gospel that you've placed father the laborers in the field Lord Jesus to minister to your bride to bring her to Perfection because we know it's only by a five-fold Ministry that your Saints will be perfected true father we love love you and we thank you we just take you at your word tonight Lord help each one of us as we go our separate ways Lord just to desire more of you father to turn our hearts all the way to you father and to not be caught up in this world to one
