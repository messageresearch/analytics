[0:00] thing when we can get together and dwell
[0:02] in unity.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; And I want to make it expressly clear as
[0:05] I announced this this morning. You know,
[0:07] I'm not interested in having an
[0:09] adversarial relationship.
[0:11] Sometimes when these things happen,
[0:13] people can get emotional and they can
[0:15] say things and we're always going to
[0:17] hear stuff in the background. But you
[0:18] know what? I just appreciate what
[0:20] Brother Brandham said. You know, when
[0:22] you would hear something and you'd think
[0:23] that's, you know, really distasteful and
[0:25] maybe a little bit sour. You know what?
[0:27] Maybe my brother didn't mean it that
[0:29] way. He he just didn't mean it that way
[0:31] or she just didn't mean it that way. You
[0:34] know, it it's it's up to us what we do
[0:36] when we hear stuff and you know how we
[0:38] actually process stuff. It's very
[0:41] important because we have a direct we
[0:43] have a direct instruction from the Lord.
[0:46] Let's not say that we have a direct
[0:48] instruction from the prophet even though
[0:49] we do from the Lord. But the word of God
[0:52] says to take every thought into
[0:54] captivity.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; Before we speak, let's run those words
[1:00] through the filter of the Holy Ghost
[1:02] &gt;&gt; and see what he has to say about it.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to announce that this is
[1:07] happening and uh that I really
[1:09] appreciate that brother Toby came came
[1:11] to me and said this is what I'm I'm
[1:13] planning the leadership of the Lord in
[1:14] my life for me and my family. I very
[1:17] much appreciate that.
[1:19] So, for now, all I know is that they
[1:21] will hold their first service on March
[1:24] the 1st. I have no idea about details
[1:27] where or when or who. Um, that's
[1:31] completely
[1:32] uh up in the air for now. But you know
[1:35] what? We certainly want to encourage
[1:37] them. And if there's something that we
[1:38] can do for them, we can pray for them.
[1:41] We can certainly send encouragement and
[1:43] love. And you know, the great great
[1:46] consolation that I get from it is that
[1:48] brother Toby and Sister Faith, they're
[1:50] not leaving the city of Calgary. Their
[1:53] children aren't leaving the city of
[1:54] Calgary. We can actually still
[1:56] fellowship together. And you know, if we
[1:59] can't fellowship together, there's
[2:00] something wrong. There's there's a wrong
[2:03] spirit in there somewhere. If we can't
[2:04] fellowship together, and I one thing
[2:07] that I really do appreciate, Brother
[2:08] Toby said is, "Can the youth still
[2:10] fellowship?" And I said, "Of course they
[2:12] can. We We have an open door. Those two
[2:15] doors are open right now. And the other
[2:17] two doors downstairs, they're open right
[2:19] now. We have an open door here.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; We're not We're not interested in trying
[2:24] to segregate. And and and you know that
[2:26] word to the church back there, it says
[2:28] it very clearly from the prophet. Now,
[2:30] we can get into the prophet. If you
[2:32] haven't read that word to the church,
[2:34] you might want to read it sometime. But
[2:36] it says in there, "Don't get clanish."
[2:41] where it's just our group inside the
[2:45] group.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; That's not going to work.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Don't get clanished."
[2:51] So, we don't want to do that. We want to
[2:53] encourage our brother and our sister.
[2:54] And I want to say this. I can promise
[2:58] you one thing that brother Toby and
[3:02] sister Faith would not be doing this
[3:04] unless the Lord wanted them to.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; Because if the Lord didn't want this, it
[3:09] wouldn't be happening. Yes.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; And for anybody to think that maybe
[3:14] that's not true. Either he's God or he's
[3:17] not.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Let's not say that maybe things could be
[3:21] happening and God's not in control. God
[3:23] is fully in control.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; So, we want to actually just see the
[3:28] Lord bless it. And, you know, we're
[3:30] we're I I was telling brother Toby this.
[3:33] I hope it's okay if I could just express
[3:35] my heart this morning a little bit. You
[3:37] know, I worked with brother Paul and uh
[3:39] I worked with him for many years and we
[3:41] worked with someone uh this this
[3:44] gentleman he he had a PhD in I think
[3:47] civil uh societies or something. I I
[3:51] can't remember what his degree was but
[3:53] one of the things that he did it was
[3:55] maybe it was just his dissertation. He
[3:56] said he told us when a city reaches a
[3:58] million people within 10 years they can
[4:01] actually reach 2 million people. It can
[4:03] take decades for a city to reach 1
[4:06] million people. And that's the way it
[4:08] was for the city of Calgary. But then we
[4:11] saw it actually coming close to a
[4:12] million people and thinking, "Wow, that
[4:14] wasn't that long ago, brothers and
[4:16] sisters. I would say 15 maybe maybe 20
[4:18] years." We had that conversation with
[4:20] Mike Michael and and he said, you know,
[4:23] it doesn't take that long. And here we
[4:25] are. Here we are. We're pushing 1.5 1.6
[4:29] million people in the city of Calgary.
[4:30] It's probably not going to take long
[4:32] till we're two million people in the
[4:34] city of Calgary.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; I think it just is amazing to see how
[4:38] the Lord works. Don't you?
[4:40] &gt;&gt; It's just wonderful. So, we want to
[4:43] certainly appreciate Brother Toby and
[4:45] Sister Faith for their stand on the word
[4:48] and uh we certainly can pray for them
[4:51] and we can encourage them and just see
[4:53] what the Lord will do through them for
[4:57] the city of Calgary. And uh as I said,
[5:00] you know, they're not moving. So there
[5:02] should still be just just as much
[5:04] fellowship as we've had. Maybe not so
[5:06] much meeting on a Sunday or a Wednesday
[5:08] or whatever the Lord should lead them to
[5:10] do for service times, but we uh want to
[5:12] encourage the fellowship. We do not want
[5:14] to discourage that. And anybody that
[5:16] would ever say, "Brother Barry has
[5:18] discouraged fellowship," that person is
[5:21] under the influence of a lying spirit
[5:24] because brother Barry has never one time
[5:26] and never will discourage fellowship.
[5:29] That is a devil.
[5:32] So there you have it. There's going to
[5:34] be another lighthouse in the city of
[5:36] Calgary. And we certainly want to pray
[5:38] with them and trust that the Lord will
[5:40] bless them and lead them and guide them
[5:42] to reach those last predestinated seeds
[5:45] in this uh in this city. So God bless
[5:49] you this morning. I want to I want to
[5:51] pick up our our study last week from uh
[5:54] from Judges chapter 6 and talking about
[5:56] Gideon and how the Lord actually came
[5:59] around and and used this man and and
[6:02] such a mighty way. And you know, I just
[6:05] was thinking about it, this this story
[6:07] and you know, how Israel was crying out
[6:09] because of the persecution.
[6:11] It's such a terrible thing. Many times
[6:14] we can find ourselves in our lives
[6:16] crying out because of persecution in our
[6:18] lives. And you know, there's a reason
[6:20] why the children of Israel had
[6:22] persecution. It wasn't because the enemy
[6:24] was bad, even though it was. It wasn't
[6:28] because the enemy was there, even though
[6:31] it was. And it was actually I should
[6:34] correct myself because the enemy was
[6:36] there but you know they were given a
[6:39] specific instruction.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; They were given very direct instructions
[6:43] and it was to not tolerate the
[6:45] inhabitants of the land but to drive
[6:48] them out
[6:49] &gt;&gt; to get them out of the land.
[6:52] And you know in verse one of chapter 6
[6:54] it says it right in there. And the
[6:56] children of Israel did evil in the sight
[6:58] of the Lord.
[7:00] So what' the Lord do? Exactly what he
[7:03] said he would do. He did exactly what he
[7:06] said he would do. He is bound by his
[7:08] word.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; In the book of Deuteronomy, the the two
[7:11] laws, he said, "If you will, I will."
[7:15] And he said, "If you don't, then I
[7:17] will." It's it's it's pretty simple.
[7:20] It's it's cut and dried. The children of
[7:22] Israel, they did evil in the sight of
[7:24] the Lord. And you know how quickly it
[7:27] can happen. I I don't have the quotes in
[7:30] front of me this morning. I'm just going
[7:31] to I'm just going to preach a little
[7:33] from my heart here. I think it's it's
[7:34] amazing to look at this scripture and
[7:36] and see how how people can become bound
[7:39] up and and see c certain circumstances
[7:42] and situations and how they affect them
[7:45] in their lives and then you know
[7:48] sometimes wonder why is it the way it
[7:50] is. Sometimes we actually get off track.
[7:54] Sometimes we actually forget the
[7:57] commandments of the Lord. Sometimes we
[7:59] forget what the Lord has actually done
[8:00] for us in delivering us from the enemies
[8:04] in our lives, in our lands.
[8:06] But the children of Israel, they did
[8:08] this. But isn't it interesting that
[8:10] still even in the midst of this, they
[8:13] began to cry out. It was when they cried
[8:15] out that the Lord actually sent them a
[8:18] deliverer. And isn't it beautiful
[8:20] because he didn't send them an angel of
[8:22] the Lord with wings and a sword, a
[8:25] flaming sword to come and drive out the
[8:27] enemy. What did he do? He sent them a
[8:30] prophet. He sent them a prophet with the
[8:33] word of the Lord. And as I was reading
[8:35] this scripture this morning at the
[8:36] pulpit here this morning, this is just
[8:38] fresh. I think it's so interesting how
[8:41] it would be if we could actually
[8:43] fellowship with some of the people from
[8:45] old. And one day we will. But to think
[8:48] about the the spiritual aspect, the
[8:50] people who are for ordained before the
[8:52] foundation of the world and and they
[8:54] don't even realize it until it becomes a
[8:58] revelation to them. We don't know that
[9:00] we're sons and daughters of God until
[9:02] one day somebody actually tells us that
[9:05] we are. And then we have to look into
[9:07] the word of God and say, "Is that me?"
[9:10] Like looking into the mirror. Brother
[9:11] Brandham tells that story of the little
[9:13] kid looking into the mirror and he sees
[9:14] the little kid wave and and the little
[9:16] kid waves back and he raises his hand,
[9:19] his hand raises. Everything that
[9:21] happens, he begins to see a mimic of
[9:23] what he's doing and he can recognize
[9:25] that is myself. That's no other kid. I
[9:28] thought that was some other kid. And as
[9:30] believers of this word, sometimes we can
[9:32] look at it and think that's someone
[9:34] else. Someone else is going to have that
[9:36] faith. But that's not the case at all.
[9:39] When we can look into the word of God,
[9:41] that word strikes that seed gene of God.
[9:45] It actually does something for us.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; It actually starts to create a life
[9:50] inside of us. That seed gene takes off.
[9:55] It comes to life. But I got thinking
[9:57] about this. What would it be like for
[10:00] those people of old that actually
[10:02] understood thus saith the Lord?
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:07] I know myself as a I I'll say a maybe a
[10:11] normal or or maybe more accurately an
[10:13] abnormal human being living in this
[10:15] world in in in you know the the 21st
[10:19] century just trying to make my way not
[10:21] really knowing if there is a God or or
[10:23] or if we should even believe that
[10:26] there's a God just just making my way
[10:28] before he came and introduced himself to
[10:30] me. But when I heard thus sayaith the
[10:33] Lord the first time, I thought that's
[10:35] kind of odd.
[10:37] That's that's kind of different. But you
[10:40] know, that's kind of the way it is for
[10:41] us in our lives in the day in which we
[10:43] live until it becomes a revelation. But
[10:45] going back to what I was thinking about
[10:47] those people who actually knew what thus
[10:49] sayaith the Lord meant, can you imagine
[10:52] their their their ability to receive
[10:54] that word in a moment to say there's
[10:57] something about that? That's thus
[11:00] sayaith the Lord. It's time to perk up
[11:02] our ears and listen because we have not
[11:04] heard thus sayaeth the Lord for a few
[11:06] years. And the judges, they hadn't. It
[11:08] had only been a few years, not very
[11:10] long. But here we are in the day in
[11:12] which we live. There's something inside
[11:13] of us that reacts when we hear, "Thus
[11:16] sayaeth the Lord."
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing to think out about
[11:20] how the Lord came and sent them a
[11:22] prophet and said, "Thus saith the Lord
[11:25] God of Israel, I brought you up from
[11:27] Egypt and brought you forth from the
[11:29] house of bondage." In our lives, we can
[11:32] look at that and say, "Praise the Lord.
[11:34] I've been able to hear thus sayaith the
[11:36] Lord in the day in which I live and to
[11:38] recognize that I've been brought out
[11:40] from the house of bondage." But many
[11:42] times we can find ourselves in a
[11:44] position where we say, "Praise the Lord.
[11:46] I'm not under bondage. I believe the
[11:47] message of the hour. But you know what?
[11:49] That's not what we've been called to
[11:51] just to believe the message of the hour.
[11:53] What we've been called to is a greater
[11:55] life.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; A greater life. The literal life of
[11:59] Jesus Christ to live out through us
[12:01] through that thus sayaith the Lord
[12:04] &gt;&gt; to call us to the message, but to get
[12:06] the message and take the message and eat
[12:08] it up
[12:09] &gt;&gt; and it will become sweet as honey in our
[12:12] mouth.
[12:14] BUT WHEN IT TELLS US YOU CAN'T DO THAT
[12:16] ANYMORE, you shouldn't go there anymore,
[12:19] don't say that anymore, don't act that
[12:21] way anymore, it becomes bitter in our
[12:24] bellies.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; But aren't you thankful for thus sayaeth
[12:29] the Lord. [laughter]
[12:31] &gt;&gt; I just love it. I think it's so
[12:33] beautiful. You know, the children of
[12:34] Israel, they wondered why they were in
[12:35] bondage when they were down in in Egypt.
[12:39] And and it was a prophecy. It was a thus
[12:41] sayaith the Lord. We know that happened.
[12:45] God delivered them from it. Brought them
[12:47] out, gave them into their promised land.
[12:49] And and there they were in the promised
[12:51] land crying out. Why were they crying
[12:54] out? Why was Gideon threshing by his
[12:58] wine press privately?
[13:01] And we know, we know it says it in the
[13:04] word. He was doing it so that they
[13:06] wouldn't actually, the Midionites
[13:07] wouldn't actually see it. He was being
[13:09] covert about it in his promised land. He
[13:12] was being covert about it. The place
[13:15] where there was not supposed to be any
[13:17] man stand before them all the days of
[13:19] their life.
[13:22] We have to be careful. We don't want
[13:23] them to see, right?
[13:25] &gt;&gt; No.
[13:27] It's because they did evil in the sight
[13:28] of the Lord and it put them in bondage.
[13:31] And you know, evil, I'll say this, I
[13:34] think it's so amazing when you look at
[13:36] it. I heard it the first time from
[13:37] brother Eugene Braun this way. Evil
[13:40] isn't maybe as we suppose. It's not the
[13:43] rock and roll and it's not the maybe
[13:46] movies and Hollywood and all the stuff
[13:48] that's in this world that really is
[13:49] evil. One word off is evil.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; One word off is evil. One substitution
[13:57] is evil. One tradition that's greater
[13:59] than the word of God for the day in
[14:01] which we live is evil.
[14:04] And to think that God's going TO BLESS
[14:06] US. WHERE'S ALL THE MIRACLES? I THOUGHT
[14:08] THAT GOD SENT US A PROPHET IN THE DAY IN
[14:11] WHICH WE LIVE. I THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD
[14:12] SEE MIGHTY SIGNS AND WONDERS.
[14:16] What are we doing about it? Are we
[14:18] actually living according to the word
[14:21] &gt;&gt; for our day? Because if we are, then all
[14:24] the signs and wonders are going to
[14:25] follow.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; And they do.
[14:30] But sometimes I I feel like we can find
[14:32] ourselves in bondage and say, "You know
[14:34] what? If God really is with us, then
[14:35] where's all the miracles?"
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the miracles. I want to
[14:42] encourage us today. Look at the word.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Let's get our focus right. It has to be
[14:47] on the word.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; When we have our focus right, all of the
[14:52] miracles, they follow. Amen.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; When the children of Israel got back
[14:57] with God, he did something for them. And
[14:59] you know, he did something mighty in in
[15:01] the life of Gideon. And and we'll
[15:04] probably get into it, Lord willing, uh a
[15:06] little bit later, but you know, he the
[15:08] angel of the Lord came to him after the
[15:10] prophet did first, right? It wasn't
[15:13] before, it was after, but he said to
[15:15] them, "The Lord is with thee, thou
[15:16] mighty man of valor." This is verse
[15:19] verse 12 and 13 of of chapter 6 of
[15:22] Judges. And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my
[15:25] Lord, if the Lord be with us, then where
[15:28] is all this befallen us? What's befallen
[15:31] them?" They chose it. God told them, "If
[15:33] you don't do what I tell you to do, then
[15:35] this is what's going to happen." This is
[15:36] what was happening. But yet, they're
[15:38] scratching their head wondering, "Why is
[15:40] this happening?"
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Let's not be scratching our head
[15:43] wondering why these things in our life
[15:46] happens.
[15:50] Did not the Lord bring us up out of
[15:52] Egypt? But now the Lord hath forsaken us
[15:54] and delivered us into the hands of the
[15:55] Midionites.
[15:57] I think it's so beautiful. Now that he's
[15:59] actually talking to him, the Lord sees
[16:01] that he's got his attention.
[16:03] And the Lord looked upon him.
[16:07] I say, Lord, look upon me. Oh my. and
[16:10] said, "Go in this thy might, and thou
[16:13] shalt save Israel from the hand of the
[16:15] Midionites. Have not I sent thee?"
[16:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to be threshing by his
[16:23] wine press privately.
[16:26] He could be serving the Lord with all of
[16:28] his might and saying, "This is the land
[16:32] that the Lord gave Moses to take us to.
[16:35] And this is the land when Moses was
[16:38] taken off the scene that Joshua was
[16:40] given to take us to and to positionally
[16:42] place us in.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Why weren't they talking about that?
[16:48] Because sin crept in and then it became
[16:50] traditional for them and they liked it
[16:52] that way. So they just kept doing it
[16:54] that way. But I think it's beautiful.
[16:56] You know, we'll we'll we'll just carry
[16:58] on in our story here. Verse 14 says,
[17:00] "And the Lord looked upon him and said,
[17:02] Go in this thy might, and and thou shalt
[17:05] save Israel from the hand of the
[17:07] Midianites. Have not I sent thee?" And
[17:10] he said unto him, "Oh my Lord, wherewith
[17:13] shall I save Israel? Behold, my family
[17:18] is in is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
[17:22] least in my father's house."
[17:25] Isn't it wonderful that he would
[17:27] recognize this?
[17:29] &gt;&gt; I think it's wonderful that we can
[17:31] recognize it as well. God does not
[17:34] choose the proud. He chooses the abase.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; He doesn't take the ones that are big
[17:41] and tall and head and shoulders above
[17:44] all the rest. That's what man does.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; We know the children of Israel did that.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; And look what it got him. got him a king
[17:52] that didn't believe.
[17:55] But isn't it interesting to think that
[17:57] after that
[17:59] what happened? The prophet came on the
[18:02] scene. The prophet came with thus
[18:04] sayaeth the Lord. Let me let me see your
[18:08] children.
[18:10] We know Jesse had a bunch of boys. Let
[18:12] me see all your boys. And he went
[18:15] through the house and he showed them all
[18:17] the boys. And there were fine specimens
[18:20] all the way along, weren't they? But
[18:22] then he said to him, "But isn't there
[18:24] one more? Isn't there one more? The
[18:26] spirit of the Lord isn't given me he
[18:27] thus sayaith the Lord here for some
[18:29] reason. I don't know what's going on."
[18:30] And he said, "Yeah, there's another one.
[18:32] He's out tending the father's sheep."
[18:34] And he said, "Get him.
[18:36] Get him." And we know that he was the
[18:38] ruddy fella. He was the one that didn't
[18:41] match what man's ideas were.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; But that's God's choice. His thoughts
[18:46] are not our thoughts, brothers and
[18:48] sisters. Neither his are his ways our
[18:50] ways.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; The only thing that we've got to do is
[18:54] follow the word.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; But I think it's beautiful because
[18:58] immediately he started doing what you
[19:00] know what most of the servants do that
[19:02] follow the Lord, that have been called
[19:03] of the Lord. You know, I I'm the least
[19:05] in my father's house. And you know what?
[19:08] I grew up in a poor family. How could we
[19:10] ever do this? I don't have an education.
[19:12] I don't have a big huge bank account.
[19:14] But I'm not going to get a tremendous
[19:16] inheritance of money from my
[19:18] forefathers. That's not going to happen.
[19:20] How could I be that one?
[19:23] I think it's important to recognize that
[19:25] uh that's God's choice. That's how he
[19:28] does it.
[19:29] My goodness.
[19:32] Verse 16 says, "And the Lord said unto
[19:34] him, surely I will be with thee, and
[19:37] thou shalt smite the Midionites as one
[19:40] man."
[19:42] That's a tremendous thing because when
[19:43] you hear the story as we go about how
[19:46] many Midionites there were there. I
[19:47] don't know if we'll get that far today.
[19:49] There was a lot.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; There was a lot of Midianites in the
[19:53] land. I mean, the the word says that
[19:56] they couldn't even count their camels.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; There were so many camels there. There
[20:01] was, excuse me, so many people. But
[20:04] they're going to they're going to get
[20:05] smoked as one man.
[20:08] Verse 17. And he said unto him, "If now
[20:10] I have found grace in thy sight, then
[20:14] show me a sign. Show me a sign that thou
[20:17] talkest with me.
[20:19] Depart not hence I pray thee until I
[20:22] come unto thee and bring forth my
[20:25] present and set it before thee." And you
[20:28] know the angel said to him, "I will
[20:30] tarry until thou come again." We talked
[20:33] about this last week. You know, a few
[20:34] hours later, he turns up again with the
[20:38] sacrifice, with a gift for him. And
[20:40] Gideon went in and made ready a kid and
[20:43] unleavened cakes of an ephath of flour
[20:46] and flesh. He put it in a basket, and he
[20:48] put forth in a pot, and brought it out
[20:51] unto him under the oak, and presented
[20:54] it. Very, very similar to what what what
[20:58] Abram did too, right? When Abram was
[21:00] getting his his change, his name change,
[21:03] we know that three men approached and he
[21:06] said, "My Lord," by revelation, we know
[21:10] that that's what happened. But very very
[21:12] similar, he he brought out his his his
[21:14] present. He brought him a present and
[21:17] gave it to him and presented it to him.
[21:19] And the angel of God, verse 20, said
[21:22] unto him, "Take the flesh and unleavened
[21:25] cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and
[21:27] pour out the broth." And he did so. And
[21:31] the angel of the Lord put forth the end
[21:33] of his staff, and was in his hand, and
[21:37] touched the flesh and the unleavened
[21:39] cakes. And there rose up fire out of the
[21:42] rock, and consumed the flesh and the
[21:45] unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the
[21:47] Lord departed out of his sight. Isn't
[21:50] that wonderful
[21:52] to think about that story? We talked
[21:54] about that. I think we ended with that
[21:55] last week. How he was able to say to
[21:58] him, you know, I if if if I found grace
[22:01] in your sight, then show me a sign that
[22:04] that thou talkest with me. And what did
[22:06] he do? He he was able to go and create
[22:09] this this offering unto the Lord. And I
[22:12] I just want to encourage us today,
[22:13] brothers and sisters. We all have an
[22:15] opportunity to bring that offering unto
[22:18] the Lord.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; It starts with bringing our soul, our
[22:23] whole mind, body, and soul, and giving
[22:25] it to the Lord. Putting it upon that
[22:27] rock of revelation that thus saith the
[22:30] Lord for the day in which we live and
[22:32] saying, "Be it unto me according to thy
[22:34] word." I might not understand it. I
[22:36] might not be able to explain it, but
[22:38] something inside of me says, "I believe
[22:40] it. And when we can do that, brothers
[22:42] and sisters, don't think that we don't
[22:45] have a gift, that we don't have a
[22:47] present that we can bring the Lord. But
[22:49] once that happens, I think it's so
[22:51] beautiful. And I believe it with all my
[22:52] heart that the musicians are a fine
[22:55] example of those people that have this
[22:58] revelation, they have a present that
[23:00] they can bring and offer unto the Lord
[23:03] week after week, service after service.
[23:06] by bringing a gift and offering it unto
[23:09] the Lord. The music, the the the the
[23:12] worship that the Lord has put in their
[23:13] heart, right in their soul, it's another
[23:16] avenue to worship.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; But let's not stop with the musicians
[23:19] because it's not just for musicians.
[23:21] It's all about the worship in the heart
[23:24] of the believer.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; That is the most beautiful thing I can
[23:28] think of, brothers and sisters. Once
[23:30] we've had that revelation that we can
[23:32] pour ourselves out, like those quotes we
[23:34] read last week, pour our souls out
[23:36] before the Lord as an offering and see
[23:39] if he won't consume it.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; And what does he do? He burns out the
[23:43] old man.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; That's what takes place. THE OLD MAN
[23:46] DIES. We no longer have the desire to go
[23:49] to where we went. We don't have the
[23:51] desire to listen to what we do. We don't
[23:53] have the desire to say the things that
[23:55] we said or think the way we thought. But
[23:59] what happens is the devil comes around
[24:00] and says, "Remember how much fun that
[24:02] was? You like that song?
[24:05] Come on, just press play once." And when
[24:07] you do, what happens? Before long,
[24:09] you're like, "Wow, yeah." And then you
[24:11] shake out of it and you say, "No, no,
[24:13] no, no. That old man's dead."
[24:16] &gt;&gt; And you have to bury him again. That's
[24:18] why Paul said, "I die daily."
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's with music. Sometimes
[24:22] it's with shorts. And I'm not talking
[24:24] about pants. I'm talking about videos.
[24:27] Sometimes it's with video games.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; There's many different things in our
[24:31] lives that are of the old man.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you if it's of the old
[24:37] man or not. You want to know how.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Does it take your time? Does it consume
[24:42] your mind?
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Does it take you away from thinking
[24:45] about the things of the Lord? If it does
[24:47] that, it's of the old man.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Pour it out on the rock and say, "Lord,
[24:52] I don't like this anymore. I WISH THAT
[24:54] YOU WOULD take it from me. CONSUME IT.
[24:56] BURN IT OUT of me.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; And with all sincerity, if it is all
[25:00] sincerity, he will.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; He will. But if we think that we can
[25:05] entertain on one hand parts and
[25:08] provisions of the old man and parts and
[25:12] provisions of the thus sayaith the Lord
[25:14] revelation in the day in which we live,
[25:16] we are mistaken
[25:18] because God won't accept it. It'll be a
[25:21] vain sacrifice that we bring and we pour
[25:23] out and think, "Wow, he's going to be
[25:25] happy with it." He won't be happy with
[25:27] it. And then we'll wonder why he's not
[25:29] happy with it. And you know what will
[25:31] happen in our heart? We will hear him
[25:34] say, "Just do like your brother and I'll
[25:37] accept it and whoever's inside of us
[25:40] will come forth."
[25:42] Will we say, "Oh Lord, be it unto me. I
[25:44] do want to be like my brother. I do want
[25:46] to bring a worship that you'll receive."
[25:48] Or will we be like, "Oh no, I'm gonna
[25:50] murder that guy. I don't like that guy."
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Remember the story of Cain and Abel? You
[25:55] know what I'm talking about.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Cain was of his father, the what? The
[26:01] devil.
[26:03] We know what happened there.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; But Gideon, talking about our story
[26:07] here, he had a present that he was able
[26:09] to offer the Lord. And it's such a
[26:10] wonderful thing to think that this guy
[26:12] had a present that he gave the Lord.
[26:14] Abram had a present that he offered the
[26:16] Lord. And we too have a present that we
[26:19] can offer the Lord.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; And many times it's in different ways.
[26:23] Sometimes it's with worship. Sometimes
[26:25] it's it's with our attendance in the
[26:27] church. Sometimes it's it's being able
[26:30] to just pray for people. Sometimes we
[26:32] can actually offer a gift, something
[26:35] that maybe somebody wouldn't do for
[26:36] themselves ordinarily. We can just offer
[26:39] it to them because we know it would make
[26:40] them happy. There's many different
[26:42] presents that we can do. But you know
[26:44] the word of God says, "As you've done to
[26:46] the least of these, my little children,
[26:49] you've done unto who?" You've done unto
[26:51] me.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing when we look at
[26:54] it that way. But he he brought this
[26:57] present and and gave it to the to the
[26:59] Lord, to this angel. And we know that it
[27:01] was the Lord in angel form, in angelic
[27:04] form. Some people want to get to the
[27:06] scientific formula calculation of was it
[27:08] really the Lord? Because it says it was
[27:10] an angel. Brother Brham, he says that it
[27:12] was the Lord.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; It was the theophony form of the Lord in
[27:16] an angel. Just like he says in who was
[27:18] this Melzdc? Who was Melzdc? Some people
[27:21] would say, well, he he he he was a
[27:23] different guy. He was one other
[27:25] personality that's just maybe now what
[27:28] happens is we wind up with four persons
[27:30] in the in the maybe not Holy Trinity
[27:33] anymore if that's the case because
[27:35] there's a fourth man, right? And that's
[27:38] not the way it is. Who was that guy? He
[27:40] was without mother. He was without
[27:42] father. He was without descent.
[27:43] Beginning of days or ending OF LIFE.
[27:45] THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON THAT fits that
[27:47] description.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; And don't think for a second that God
[27:50] Almighty couldn't just
[27:52] &gt;&gt; a body and then just step into it.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful to think that's the
[27:59] case?
[28:01] We know that the word of God says that
[28:03] many times people entertain angels
[28:06] unawares
[28:09] &gt;&gt; that angel could be the Lord himself
[28:13] &gt;&gt; in a human body
[28:16] &gt;&gt; not as Jesus because Jesus is seated at
[28:19] the right hand of the father. Now many
[28:21] people might be thinking brother Barry
[28:23] you're getting crazy talking this way
[28:24] and you know we're talking about God.
[28:27] We're talking about God Almighty. Don't
[28:29] think for a second that he can't do
[28:30] whatever he wants to do. We know that in
[28:33] Balam's day he could actually speak
[28:35] through a donkey. And he did, didn't he?
[28:39] God can do anything he wants to do.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Anytime he wants to do it, he'll never
[28:45] be outside of his word.
[28:47] But I think it's beautiful because we we
[28:49] could actually entertain an angel in our
[28:52] life and not even know that that's an
[28:54] angel. Not even know it. That's the word
[28:57] of God.
[29:01] But he had his present and he came and
[29:03] he offered it and and you know he did it
[29:05] with all sincerity, didn't it? You know
[29:08] how he did it with all sincerity? The
[29:11] angel accepted it. The angel actually
[29:14] consumed his present. And how do we know
[29:18] that the Lord has accepted our
[29:20] sacrifice?
[29:23] When he does consume it. When he does
[29:25] take it. when he actually accepts it.
[29:29] [snorts] And uh it's just such a
[29:30] beautiful thing that we're able to bring
[29:32] our presence unto the Lord.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Verse 22. And when Gideon perceived that
[29:36] he was an angel of the Lord, Gideon
[29:40] said, "Alas, oh Lord God, for because I
[29:44] have seen an angel of the Lord face to
[29:47] face."
[29:48] And the Lord said unto him, "Peace be
[29:50] unto thee. Fear not, thou shalt not
[29:53] die."
[29:55] And I think that's actually a message
[29:57] that applies today to every single
[29:59] believer that's ever alive right now in
[30:02] the end time and maybe through all all
[30:05] times any believer of this word. This
[30:07] applies just just peace be unto thee and
[30:11] and fear not. Thou shalt not die.
[30:15] Many people will say, "Well, Brother
[30:16] Barry, many people I know who are
[30:18] believers, they've actually are are in a
[30:21] coffin in a graveyard somewhere out
[30:23] there and they died." No, they never.
[30:25] They just changed their dwelling pace.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; Because death is not a part of life.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Death is never going to be a part of the
[30:34] literal life of Jesus Christ. If we have
[30:38] his life inside of us, we can never die.
[30:45] The Lord said unto him, "Peace be unto
[30:47] thee, fear not. Thou shalt not die."
[30:51] &gt;&gt; I personally believe this with all my
[30:52] heart. When we get that revelation in
[30:54] our lives that we shall not die, it
[30:58] doesn't matter what devil comes around
[30:59] our life.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what any doctor tells us
[31:03] because we have something to stand on.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; We know that we shall not die. You
[31:08] cannot die. If the devil, the bully,
[31:11] knows that he can scare you, he's going
[31:15] to bully you and he's going to scare
[31:16] you. But if the devil knows that he's
[31:19] not going to actually bully you and
[31:21] scare you, you're going to say boo back
[31:24] to the devil when he comes around. He's
[31:26] not going to want to come and try and do
[31:28] something to you.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; But I love this. I just want to take it
[31:33] and make it my own. I hope that we can
[31:35] do that today together. And and the Lord
[31:37] said unto him, "Peace be unto thee,"
[31:39] fear not. Thou shalt not die.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; And I wonder, it makes me wonder, read
[31:45] in the scripture, how many people were
[31:47] afraid?
[31:48] How many people actually did die? And
[31:52] and we'll get into maybe a little
[31:54] further here. You know, they they
[31:55] actually went and found themselves
[31:58] living in in caves. They were living in
[32:02] caves. The children of the promise, the
[32:05] ones that were delivered out of bondage,
[32:07] were living in their promised land,
[32:09] hiding out in strongholds and in caves
[32:12] because of the INHABITANTS OF THE LAND.
[32:15] Why is that? They were instructed to
[32:17] destroy the inhabitants of the land. And
[32:20] I just want to encourage us this
[32:22] morning, if we have the the idea that we
[32:25] need to spiritually run and hide into a
[32:27] cave, we need to find a a safe spot that
[32:30] we can get to because of the persecution
[32:32] of the devil. Now, I'm preaching to
[32:34] myself. If we have to feel like we have
[32:37] got to do something to run and hide, you
[32:39] know what? The name of the Lord is a
[32:42] strong tower
[32:44] &gt;&gt; and the righteous can run into it
[32:47] &gt;&gt; and be saved.
[32:50] The devil can't touch us. Not unless God
[32:53] sees it fit for him to do so. And if he
[32:55] does, it's only going to be for God's
[32:57] glory in our lives.
[33:02] But the Lord said unto him, "Peace be
[33:03] unto thee, fear not. Thou shalt not
[33:05] die." Then Gideon built an altar there
[33:08] unto the Lord, and called it Jehovah
[33:12] Shalom.
[33:14] And you know, if I had to title this the
[33:16] last message and this message, I'm
[33:18] terrible for that. I guess I'm not that
[33:20] that scholarly, I would call them
[33:22] Jehovah Shalom. As we talk about Gideon,
[33:25] Jehovah Shalom. That is our God. Jehovah
[33:30] Shalom. The mighty name Jehovah and all
[33:34] of the other attributes that he has.
[33:36] Shalom. And you know, Brother Brandham
[33:38] preached that. We preached it at the
[33:39] beginning of the year. Peace. God's
[33:41] peace be upon thee. Fear not, you shall
[33:44] not die. And what did Gideon say? Hey,
[33:47] I'm going to build an altar unto the
[33:48] Lord, and I'm going to call this place
[33:50] Jehovah Shalom. I think if I had the
[33:53] opportunity, I would say, brothers and
[33:55] sisters, we can call our spot, our
[33:58] altar, Jehovah Shalom. And it says unto
[34:02] this day, it's an Oprah of the
[34:04] Abysserites. I looked it up, and Jehovah
[34:06] Shalom is not actually identifiable as
[34:10] an actual place today. It's not actually
[34:13] known exactly where this was. There is a
[34:16] state park in Israel that is called
[34:19] Gideon's Spring, I believe it is.
[34:22] There's a cave there, but it's not
[34:24] proven that this is actually the place.
[34:27] And you know, I heard a historian say
[34:29] that this is actually assumed that this
[34:32] is the place based on the fact that it
[34:34] was it was written in the books book of
[34:36] Judges at the time. So they had a an
[34:39] idea of where it was, but where it was
[34:42] exactly, it doesn't really matter, does
[34:44] it?
[34:45] &gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is that it
[34:46] happened.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; It happened. He was able to build an
[34:50] altar, and he was able to say that this
[34:52] was unto the Lord and call it Jehovah
[34:54] Shalom. Unto this day, it is yet an
[34:56] Oprah of the Abby. Where I want to get
[34:59] to today with our service is the next
[35:02] verse 25. And it came to pass the same
[35:05] night that the Lord said unto him, "Take
[35:07] thy father's young bullock, even the
[35:10] second bullock of seven years old, and
[35:13] throw down the altar of Baal that thy
[35:17] father hath." What does his dad have an
[35:20] altar of Baal for?
[35:23] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Aren't they believers delivered out of
[35:26] the bondage of Israel?
[35:28] &gt;&gt; What's he GOT AN ALTAR TO BAAL?
[35:32] Throw down the altar of Baal thy father
[35:35] hath and cut down the grove that is by
[35:39] it.
[35:41] What's going on here?
[35:44] &gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful, brothers and
[35:45] sisters.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; This is an example for us in the day in
[35:48] which we live.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; The word of God says that we need to
[35:52] make our own calling and election sure.
[35:54] Yes.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; If this guy, if this fella would have
[35:58] rode the coattales of his daddy's
[36:00] religion,
[36:02] &gt;&gt; what would have happened?
[36:04] &gt;&gt; He would have been consumed and he would
[36:06] have died.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; He would have been afraid first.
[36:11] But something happened in his life. God
[36:13] came to him personally. And isn't that
[36:16] the truth about the message of the hour?
[36:18] That's what the new birth is. God coming
[36:20] to the individual personally and showing
[36:23] them, take everything you think you know
[36:26] and set it aside and run it through the
[36:28] filter of my word and take it for
[36:32] yourself.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Why is that? You say,
[36:36] "Brother Barry, because God has no
[36:38] grandchildren."
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Because I'm a believer doesn't mean that
[36:42] my children get a free pass to heaven.
[36:44] They have to have their own relationship
[36:47] with the Lord God. Jehovah Shalom.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; It's got to be their own deal, not mine.
[36:54] I can make the introduction, but they've
[36:57] got to become friends. And I'll tell
[36:59] you, that's my heart's desire. I'm not
[37:02] interested in trying to paint a flowery
[37:04] picture of religion. I want my children
[37:07] to have a real relationship with the
[37:09] King of Kings and Lord of Lords for
[37:11] themselves.
[37:13] Cuz if I talk him into it, someone can
[37:16] talk them out of it.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; And what's worse is if I show them that
[37:22] I've got a little secret altar to bail.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; I believe the message of the hour, but I
[37:26] also believe this.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; And I got a grove, man, that's right
[37:30] beside it. It's a beautiful place. My
[37:33] goodness. It's so peaceful and tranquil.
[37:36] Oh my. And you know what? Everybody's
[37:38] doing it. SO IT'S OKAY, IS IT?
[37:42] It's exactly what put the children of
[37:43] Israel in that position that they had
[37:47] this plus that.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; There ain't none of it. We're supposed
[37:52] to drive out all of the inhabitants of
[37:54] the land. So, how do we do that? Take
[37:56] the old man and make sure that old man
[37:58] is dead. How much of that old man? Every
[38:01] single speck of that old man's got to
[38:04] die.
[38:06] Because remember, brothers and sisters,
[38:08] and this this makes me shudder because I
[38:10] know
[38:12] I know this guy all too well, and I'm
[38:14] sure that we could all say that. We all
[38:16] know ourselves way better than anybody
[38:18] else.
[38:20] [sighs]
[38:22] But, you know, there isn't going to be
[38:23] any sin that actually inherits.
[38:26] What's going to happen is we're just
[38:28] going to change our dwelling place. Our
[38:30] character is not going to magically be
[38:33] transformed because we actually go in
[38:35] the rapture. Our character is not going
[38:37] to magically be transformed because we
[38:40] actually go by the way of the grave. Who
[38:42] we are right now is who we're going to
[38:44] take with us. That is who we are going
[38:47] to be.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; So what has to happen before we see a
[38:50] body change either by death of this
[38:52] flesh or a rapture where the molecular
[38:55] composition changes into our theophony
[38:58] bodies. Before that happens, there's got
[39:00] to be a character change.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; The rapture is not going to change our
[39:04] character.
[39:05] It's only going to change our dwelling
[39:07] place.
[39:09] It's an amazing thing to think about.
[39:11] But this guy here is instructed by the
[39:13] Lord. Isn't it beautiful? Take and throw
[39:16] down the altar of Baal that thy father
[39:19] hath, and cut down the grove that is by
[39:22] it.
[39:23] the first order of business that God
[39:25] tells him, "You're a mighty man of
[39:27] valor, Gideon. I love you and you're
[39:30] going to take out all of the enemy just
[39:32] as one. It's not going to be a big huge
[39:34] fight. You don't have to worry. I'm
[39:35] going to do it for you. But there's
[39:37] first there's some some business that
[39:39] we've got to tend to
[39:41] &gt;&gt; and you need to get rid of that father's
[39:42] tradition. That is not going to help
[39:45] you. It's going to hinder you." Isn't it
[39:47] wonderful about the mighty grace of our
[39:49] Lord God? how we can actually have a
[39:52] relationship with the Lord ourselves and
[39:55] we don't have to rely on our parents.
[39:58] And you know, many times I'll tell you,
[40:00] our parents probably look at us, my
[40:02] children probably look at me and say, "I
[40:03] know daddy behaves this way. He's got
[40:05] this problem and he's got that problem
[40:07] and I know if I if I push this button,
[40:09] I'll get that result. I know I know him.
[40:13] They know me.
[40:15] But they don't have to rely on my
[40:17] religion
[40:19] because my religion will put them into a
[40:20] tribulation.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; I don't want religion
[40:24] &gt;&gt; and I don't want to give them religion.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; I want to give them an introduction to
[40:28] the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; To the Lord of Hosts,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; to the literal life of Jesus Christ to
[40:34] recognize that it's not just a a a a
[40:37] Easter bunny. It's not just chocolates
[40:40] at Easter. It's not Santa Claus and
[40:42] presents at at Christmas. It's not just
[40:44] a resurrection. A death, burial, and
[40:46] resurrection 2,000 years ago.
[40:50] There was a death, burial, and
[40:51] resurrection July 27th, 2005.
[40:56] In an upper room experience in Calgary,
[40:58] living word assembly for this guy. There
[41:01] was a death, burial, and a resurrection.
[41:03] The death and the burial was the old man
[41:06] dying out. And the resurrection was
[41:08] Jesus Christ, the king of kings and lord
[41:11] OF LORDS IN MY LIFE. I HOPE BROTHERS AND
[41:13] SISTERS that we can ALL SAY WE KNOW WHEN
[41:16] THAT HAPPENED.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Then there came a time where I recognize
[41:22] water baptism isn't just something
[41:24] flowery an option.
[41:28] I knew I was baptized in titles.
[41:31] But that wasn't enough. Paul said if
[41:33] you've been baptized in titles, you
[41:34] haven't even been baptized at all.
[41:37] [laughter]
[41:38] And you need to be baptized again.
[41:42] When that revelation hit me, Brother
[41:44] Logan and I got to go down to the Bow
[41:46] River in Calgary and actually get
[41:49] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:51] Christ for the remission of our sins
[41:54] because we recognized it was according
[41:56] to the word of God.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; But the death, burial, and resurrection
[42:01] isn't something 2,000 years ago. And
[42:03] that's not what I'm interested in
[42:04] presenting to anybody. I want to show
[42:06] them a living God in this life right
[42:08] here. As I walk and I talk, there is
[42:11] something different about me.
[42:14] It's got to be that way, brothers and
[42:15] sisters. He has to be the I am of today.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; The Lord God walking in our lives,
[42:22] living out through us. Our body change
[42:24] is not going to change our character.
[42:28] Verse 26
[42:31] gives them the instructions in 25. and
[42:33] throw down the altar of Baal thy father
[42:35] hath, and cut down the grove that is by
[42:37] it, and build an altar unto the Lord thy
[42:40] God upon the top of this rock in the
[42:44] ordered place." It's so beautiful
[42:46] because the Lord already knew he knew
[42:48] how to build an altar, didn't he?
[42:51] Clear off all of the old, get rid of all
[42:53] of the old religion, get rid of all of
[42:55] the old tradition, get rid of all of
[42:57] that, and build an altar unto the King
[43:00] of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[43:04] and take the second bullock and offer a
[43:06] burnt sacrifice with the wood of the
[43:09] grove
[43:10] which thou shalt cut down. Isn't that
[43:14] beautiful? I think that's so beautiful.
[43:16] Take that grove, those trees, that
[43:18] beautiful tranquil place, that that that
[43:21] place where all of the wonderful things
[43:24] happen and and cut it down and burn it
[43:27] up. make that the altar and burn it with
[43:30] the wood that you cut down from there.
[43:32] Verse 27 says, "Then Gideon took 10 men
[43:35] of his servants and did as the Lord had
[43:38] said unto him, and so it was because he
[43:42] feared his father's household and the
[43:44] men of the city that he could not do it
[43:47] by day, so he did it by night."
[43:51] In doing that, he knew that he was going
[43:53] to suffer persecution because they
[43:54] already gave the Midianites a a place to
[43:58] stay, a place to lodge and proinder for
[44:01] their animals. They were already in the
[44:03] land, which is so strange.
[44:06] But they went and did according to the
[44:08] word of the Lord.
[44:10] 28 And when the men of the city arose
[44:12] early in the morning, behold, the altar
[44:14] of Baal was cast down, and the grove was
[44:18] cut down that was by it, and the second
[44:20] bulock was offered upon the altar that
[44:23] was built. And they said one to another,
[44:26] "Who hath done this thing?" And when
[44:29] they inquired and asked, they said,
[44:31] "Gideon, the son of Joash, hath done
[44:34] this thing."
[44:37] Now it's getting sticky. Now the
[44:39] persecution's going to come. But
[44:41] remember, he knew in his heart, the
[44:43] angel of the Lord told him, "Don't be
[44:44] afraid because you shall not die."
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; You know how to build an altar. Just go
[44:50] forward, you mighty man of valor.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to save Israel.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; You are going to save Israel. What a
[44:57] tremendous thing that is. Then the men
[44:59] of the city said unto Joash, "Bring out
[45:01] thy son that he may die."
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Interesting. Okay.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; They were willing to kill him for their
[45:09] father's traditions.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; It's the same way today. The religious
[45:16] spirit is so savage.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; It will kill for that tradition.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[45:23] Then the men of the city said unto
[45:24] Joash, "Bring out thy son, that he may
[45:27] die,
[45:28] because he hath cast down the altar of
[45:30] Baal, because he had cut down the grove
[45:34] that was by it."
[45:36] [sighs and gasps]
[45:37] Now Joash caught in the middle as a
[45:40] father, you can imagine,
[45:42] &gt;&gt; he's afraid.
[45:44] He's afraid. He never got the
[45:46] revelation. He never got the visit by
[45:48] the angel. He never heard the word of
[45:50] the prophet or he would have changed his
[45:51] ways. Joash said unto the all that stood
[45:55] against him, "Will ye plead for Baal?"
[45:58] Suddenly, it's coming back to him. Wait
[46:00] a second. This isn't what I was taught.
[46:02] This isn't what what Joshua taught us
[46:05] and our our parents coming out of
[46:07] bondage as he positionally placed us in
[46:09] the land uh uh the promised land. This
[46:11] isn't what he taught us. Joash said unto
[46:14] all that stood against him, "Will ye
[46:15] plead for Baal? Will ye save him? You're
[46:19] going to worry about an idol?
[46:22] &gt;&gt; You're going to worry about the
[46:23] Midianites God. Now there's a separation
[46:26] happening.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; The grace of the kind-loving father.
[46:29] Hey,
[46:30] &gt;&gt; to even look after the family as a
[46:33] whole.
[46:35] He that will plead for him, let him be
[46:38] put to death whilst it is yet mourning.
[46:42] If he be a god, let him plead for
[46:44] himself because one hath cast down his
[46:47] altar. One boy could come in and take
[46:50] down his altar and and shred his grove
[46:53] and offer a sacrifice with the wood from
[46:56] that grove and he's a god. Are you
[46:58] serious? If he was a god, then he
[47:01] wouldn't allow that to happen. Remember,
[47:04] they took the ark of the covenant, the
[47:07] enemies of the land, and they put it in
[47:09] the temple of Dagon. Not in this story,
[47:12] but in a further story, they put the
[47:14] temp the ark in the temple of Dagon. And
[47:16] what happened that that that idol Dagon,
[47:20] they would come back in the morning and
[47:21] they would find that idol on its face
[47:24] before the ark of the covenant.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; And they would stand it up and say,
[47:29] "There's something fishy going on.
[47:30] There's something weird about this." And
[47:32] they would come back the next day. It
[47:34] would be on its face before the ark of
[47:36] the covenant.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; And we know it even happened again. And
[47:40] the next time they came back, the hands
[47:42] were gone, the feet were gone, and it
[47:44] was just the stump of this idol before
[47:47] the ark of the covenant. Nothing can
[47:50] stand before this word,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; especially in the day in which we live,
[47:53] brothers and sisters. [cheering]
[47:57] But it's so beautiful to look at this
[48:00] how Gideon, the mighty man of valor,
[48:03] who's the least of all of his household,
[48:07] the the maybe the least educated, maybe
[48:09] not even the smartest out of all of
[48:11] them. But that's the one that God chose
[48:13] to be that one to come and not just tear
[48:16] down the idols of all of the men, to
[48:19] tear down the idols of his family, his
[48:22] dad's altar unto Baal.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; To destroy that tradition
[48:29] &gt;&gt; and it's immediately they're talking, oh
[48:31] no, someone's got to die for this. But
[48:33] his dad had to come to the rescue. His
[48:35] dad was starting to get revelation out
[48:36] of this, wasn't he? His dad said, come
[48:39] and let Hey, you know what? If one
[48:42] person can cast down this altar, then
[48:44] can't your god actually be a god and
[48:47] deal with him? Verse 32 says, "Therefore
[48:50] on that day he called him Jerubable,
[48:54] saying, let Baal plead against him
[48:57] because he hath thrown down this altar."
[49:02] He got a name change for it, didn't he?
[49:05] &gt;&gt; He became a new creature in Christ
[49:06] Jesus. Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; He was a deliverer of the children of
[49:10] Israel.
[49:12] Then all the Medidianites and the
[49:14] Amalachites and the children of the east
[49:17] were gathered together and went over and
[49:20] pitched in the valley of Jezel. You can
[49:24] imagine now there was a stir in the
[49:26] land. And a lot of the people, a lot of
[49:29] the the religious people, a lot of the
[49:32] message people in that day probably
[49:34] said, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. that
[49:37] guy, he actually he messed with our God.
[49:39] Now we're in for it.
[49:43] But something actually probably settled
[49:44] in his heart to say, "Hey, this is
[49:46] exactly what the angel of the Lord said.
[49:48] I don't know how it's going to happen. I
[49:49] can't explain it, but I know he said I'm
[49:51] not going to die. So don't worry." He
[49:54] told me, "Fear not. We're not going to
[49:56] die." What a tremendous thing it would
[49:58] be to be caught in the middle of that.
[50:01] But the spirit of the Lord, verse 34,
[50:04] came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet,
[50:07] and Abzar was gathered after him. And he
[50:11] sent messengers throughout all Manasseh,
[50:15] who was gathered after him. And he sent
[50:17] messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun,
[50:20] and unto Nefali, and they came up to
[50:23] meet them. And Gideon said unto God, "If
[50:27] thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as
[50:30] thou hast said,
[50:33] behold, I will put a fleece of wool on
[50:36] the floor in the floor. And if the dew
[50:39] be on the fleece only, and if it be dry
[50:43] upon all the earth beside, then shall I
[50:46] know that thou wilt save Israel by my
[50:50] hand, as thou hast said."
[50:53] Isn't it interesting to see how this
[50:55] story is going
[50:57] &gt;&gt; here? This guy had been called by the
[50:59] prophet. He heard, "Thus sayaith the
[51:01] Lord." Then an angel of the Lord came
[51:04] and visited him personally.
[51:07] Made himself known
[51:10] personally.
[51:11] He had a little bit of a new birth
[51:13] experience. Fear not. Thou shalt not
[51:15] die. You're a mighty man of valor. God's
[51:18] going to use you for a great purpose.
[51:21] And and here now after all of that
[51:24] following the instruction of the Lord,
[51:26] tearing down the idol of of the tearing
[51:29] down the altar of the idol rather and
[51:31] and seeing that he hasn't been killed
[51:33] even though they said bring him out.
[51:35] We're going to kill him. This guy
[51:37] deserves to die. But somehow he didn't
[51:40] die. How'd that happen? That was the
[51:42] word of the Lord.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Wasn't it?
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Now it comes time for the battle.
[51:51] and he can see it forming and he doesn't
[51:53] know exactly how it's going to take
[51:54] place but he knows God's called him and
[51:57] here he is in this position and he puts
[52:00] out a fleece before the Lord and many
[52:03] times we know that we have all done this
[52:05] and if we haven't sometimes I think it
[52:08] would do us well if we did do it
[52:11] sometimes we need a sign from the Lord
[52:14] we know that he's called us unto
[52:16] adoption with full authority and power
[52:18] that's the word for our day.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we just need a little
[52:23] assurance. Sometimes we just need a
[52:25] touch from the father. I've heard it
[52:27] said sometimes we just need our dad to
[52:29] just reach over and put his hand on us
[52:32] and let us know that he loves us.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not a a bad thing,
[52:38] brothers and sisters, to just put a
[52:39] fleece out before the Lord and say, "If
[52:41] this is what's actually going to take
[52:43] place, then just let it be like this
[52:46] according to your word and see if God
[52:48] won't do it." Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in
[52:54] the floor. And if the dew be on the
[52:56] fleece only, and it be dry upon all the
[53:00] earth beside,
[53:02] then shall I know that thou wilt save
[53:04] Israel by my hand as thou hast said.
[53:08] Take him at his word. Take him at his
[53:11] word and see if he won't actually reveal
[53:14] himself to us just the way that we need
[53:16] him to reveal himself. the way that he
[53:19] does to other people isn't necessarily
[53:21] the way that he will for us. And to try
[53:23] and categorically say it has to be a
[53:26] certain way is wrong. I'm so thankful
[53:29] that the prophet for a day said there's
[53:31] only one infallible evidence that you
[53:34] have the Holy Ghost in your life. You
[53:36] will not deny the word of God.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; If you deny one word of God, you don't
[53:43] have the Holy Ghost. Unfortunately,
[53:45] that's the truth.
[53:48] We've got to say it that way, brothers
[53:49] and sisters. To defy the word of God
[53:52] means you don't have the right spirit.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Holy Ghost will never
[53:58] deny himself, which is the word.
[54:02] But sometimes I think it's good to put a
[54:04] fleece. Sometimes we're not talking
[54:07] about necessarily getting a fleece. Does
[54:08] everybody here know what a fleece is? A
[54:10] skin from from a a a lamb.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; You can buy them in the store. You can
[54:15] get lamb skkins and you can take it out.
[54:17] Maybe a sheep skin. You can take it out
[54:19] and you can put it on the ground. And
[54:20] I'm not talking about that. Even though
[54:22] that's exactly what we're talking about
[54:24] in this story. What I'm saying is
[54:26] actually ask the Lord something specific
[54:28] and very private to you in your life and
[54:31] put it before the Lord and see if he
[54:33] won't do it.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Ask him very specifically, not in a
[54:38] vague manner, but in a very specific
[54:41] manner. If this, then that. and see if
[54:45] he won't.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; We're not asking the Lord to clown and
[54:48] I'm not encouraging us to do that
[54:49] because he will not perform for nobody.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about third pole stuff
[54:53] here. We're talking about communicating
[54:54] with the Lord so so that we understand
[54:57] in a way that we will understand it. And
[54:59] it doesn't matter what anybody else
[55:00] thinks or says because it's not about
[55:02] them. It's only about us and the Lord.
[55:05] It was only about Gideon and the Lord.
[55:07] He knew that he already heard from the
[55:08] Lord. And that's why he wanted a
[55:10] confirmation about what he had heard
[55:12] from the Lord. Because the devil comes
[55:14] around and says, "Yep, you heard about
[55:15] the Lord. You heard from the Lord. But
[55:17] you know what? He He's probably busy
[55:18] with new converts. He's probably busy
[55:21] maybe with other things going on. You
[55:23] don't want to actually bring too many
[55:24] prayer requests. You don't want to
[55:26] actually make a problem. You don't want
[55:28] to stand out." That's what the devil's
[55:29] going to say. But he wants us to. He
[55:31] wants us to cry out. Brother Brandham
[55:33] said that as he he created children in
[55:36] this world, babies, he never gave them a
[55:39] better way to cry out when they need
[55:41] something. And he talks about it in
[55:43] terms of the ecclesiastical way. Maybe
[55:45] what they should do is give that baby
[55:47] just a little bell and get the baby to
[55:49] ring a bell when he's hungry. The baby's
[55:51] not going to ring a bell. THE BABY'S
[55:53] GOING TO CRY OUT THE WAY THAT HE WAS
[55:54] CREATED TO.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; And it's the same for us, brothers and
[55:58] sisters. Don't be afraid to cry out.
[56:01] But look at this story. I just think
[56:03] it's such a wonderful thing. He says,
[56:05] "Behold, I will put out a fleece of wool
[56:07] on the floor. And very specifically, if
[56:10] the dew be on the fleece only, and it
[56:13] shall be dry upon all the earth beside
[56:15] it, then shall I know that thou wilt
[56:19] save Israel in mine hand, as thou hast
[56:22] said."
[56:24] thinking about this story just from my
[56:25] own human perspective.
[56:28] I know that I've actually had
[56:29] conversations like this with the Lord
[56:32] and I know that, you know, the next day
[56:34] comes around and suddenly there's, you
[56:37] know, maybe there's a text message and
[56:39] maybe there's something that has to be
[56:40] done and then there's something else
[56:42] that pops up and and another thing and
[56:44] another thing and another thing and
[56:46] you're before you know it, you haven't
[56:47] even really gotten going in your day.
[56:48] you haven't even left your house yet and
[56:50] your mind is racing 100 miles an hour
[56:52] because you got all these different
[56:53] things that you know you have to tend to
[56:55] and you got to deal with and and maybe
[56:57] what will happen is you'll actually
[56:59] stumble out the door and as you're
[57:01] stumbling out the door you'll stumble
[57:02] over something and you'll be like what's
[57:04] that and you'll carry on and and and go
[57:06] your way but what happens is I've
[57:08] experienced this get in the vehicle and
[57:10] start to drive away and think wait a
[57:12] second that thing that I stumbled over I
[57:14] wasn't even expecting it I wasn't even
[57:16] thinking about it but didn't I ask the
[57:17] Lord for that.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about something
[57:21] literally. I'm talking about something
[57:22] in my mind that I would stumble over as
[57:24] I walk out the door. Didn't I ask the
[57:26] Lord about that? Did you not ask about
[57:29] that thing specifically? And the
[57:32] reminder comes in. Wait a second. You
[57:34] actually laid that out as a fleece to
[57:37] say, if it's going to happen, let it
[57:39] happen this way. And he comes and
[57:41] answers it. And our lives can come
[57:43] sometimes get so busy and get in our way
[57:46] and keep us distracted from recognizing
[57:49] God answering exactly specifically the
[57:52] question that we gave him.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 38.
[57:59] And it was so. For he rose up early on
[58:02] the mororrow and thrust the fleece
[58:05] together, squished it together,
[58:08] and ringed,
[58:10] &gt;&gt; and the dew out of the fleece a bowl
[58:14] full of water.
[58:17] The ground was dry, but that fleece was
[58:20] full.
[58:21] How do you explain that? But it wasn't
[58:24] enough for Gideon, was it?
[58:26] And you know the word says that we
[58:28] should ask abundantly. Why? So that our
[58:31] joy will be full.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Gideon said unto God, "Let not thine
[58:37] anger be hot against me, and I will
[58:39] speak. But this once, let me prove,
[58:44] let me prove, I pray thee. But this once
[58:48] with the fleece, let it now be dry only
[58:51] upon the fleece, and upon all the ground
[58:55] let there be dew.
[58:58] The opposite to what he had asked
[59:00] originally.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, the point that I
[59:05] want to get to with this is quite
[59:07] simple. God knows exactly our station.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly where we are at. He
[59:14] knows exactly what our personalities are
[59:16] like. He knows exactly all about it. The
[59:20] end from the beginning in our lives.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we can get in a position
[59:25] where we think that he, you know what,
[59:27] I've done this, so he's not even going
[59:28] to listen to me. He is listening. Even
[59:31] when you've done things wrong, Gideon
[59:33] found himself in a position where all
[59:35] the people around him were doing wrong.
[59:38] And I'll tell you what, you would say
[59:39] maybe he was right because he was a
[59:40] mighty man of valor. He was doing wrong.
[59:43] This is just brother Barry speaking
[59:45] here. Maybe we can have a conversation
[59:46] about it somewhere. I know Hebrews 11
[59:48] speaks of this guy and I'm not going to
[59:50] dispute that for a second. He had a
[59:52] faith because he was able to receive the
[59:53] word for his day. But was he not doing
[59:55] wrong when he was actually hiding the
[59:58] fact that he was threshing in the
[59:59] promised land. There's not one man that
[1:00:02] was able to stand before them all the
[1:00:05] days of their life if they were
[1:00:06] following the word of Joshua.
[1:00:09] But the family tradition put him in a
[1:00:11] position where he had to behave that
[1:00:13] way. I say, Lord, help me not have any
[1:00:16] family traditions that would put my
[1:00:18] children in such a place where they feel
[1:00:20] like they have to actually hide from the
[1:00:22] enemies. The enemies that my that their
[1:00:25] daddy let in the door. Can you imagine
[1:00:27] doing that for your families? What a
[1:00:29] tragic place that would be. Goodness.
[1:00:32] Verse 40 says, "And God did so that
[1:00:35] night, for it was dry upon the fleece
[1:00:38] only,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; and there was dew on all the ground."
[1:00:42] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second, brothers and
[1:00:45] sisters, that he's not listening. Just
[1:00:48] because we get off track, just because
[1:00:50] we have errors in our lives, just
[1:00:53] because all of the different
[1:00:55] circumstances, it doesn't mean that he's
[1:00:57] still not God. He is God and he wants to
[1:01:01] deliver us.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; He hasn't left us or forsaken us. We
[1:01:05] always do. And what what did the prophet
[1:01:06] say? He said just go back to where you
[1:01:08] got off.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Just go back to where you got off. But
[1:01:12] what is the biggest hindrance to that is
[1:01:14] pride.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; No, I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK all the way
[1:01:17] there because then I'll have to go and
[1:01:18] talk to those people or maybe I'll have
[1:01:20] to go and do that thing or pay that
[1:01:22] thing or whatever that thing. I'll tell
[1:01:24] you what, brothers and sisters, some of
[1:01:26] the greatest rewards that you could ever
[1:01:28] experience in your life is to go back
[1:01:30] and actually humble yourself in the
[1:01:32] sight of the Lord before your brother or
[1:01:34] your sister and make that thing right
[1:01:36] and actually see if he won't come on the
[1:01:38] scene and bless you.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; I'm talking from experience now.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Speaking from experience, sometimes you
[1:01:46] got to go and make things right.
[1:01:47] Sometimes I know it. I've experienced it
[1:01:50] in my life. I'm not going to lie. I'm
[1:01:52] not going to deny. Sometimes you can do
[1:01:54] things in your life you can't undo.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; But you can go and try and make it
[1:01:59] right.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; You can go and try and make it right.
[1:02:05] And you know what it might do is it
[1:02:06] might just show that other person or
[1:02:09] people
[1:02:10] that there's something different about
[1:02:11] you. What is it that happened in your
[1:02:14] life? And you can tell them, you know
[1:02:16] what, the old man's dead.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; The old man's dead. Amen.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; I don't care about the past. Just like
[1:02:23] Paul said, I'm forgetting about all the
[1:02:25] things that were in the past because
[1:02:27] they are in the past. And what I'm doing
[1:02:29] is I'm pressing towards the mark for the
[1:02:31] prize not of the church. I'm pressing
[1:02:34] towards the mark OF THE PRIZE NOT of the
[1:02:36] family. I'm pressing towards the MARK OF
[1:02:38] THE PRIZE OF THE HIGH CALLING OF GOD IN
[1:02:41] Christ Jesus.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; The word for my day.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Not going to let anything stand in my
[1:02:47] way.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. OH, BUT DON'T YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?
[1:02:50] I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Don't you KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER? I don't
[1:02:55] care about that. The only thing I care
[1:02:57] about is crossing that finish line with
[1:02:59] the token in my hand.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second that it's
[1:03:06] actually out of order to ask the Lord to
[1:03:08] show you something.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; If you want him to show you something,
[1:03:12] he'll do it.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Guarantee you he'll do it. and he'll do
[1:03:16] it in a way that's specific to you,
[1:03:19] which is so beautiful. That's the God we
[1:03:22] serve.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; It's not just a cookie cutter religious
[1:03:26] thing where it's got to be according to
[1:03:28] the way the church says. No, it ain't.
[1:03:30] It's according to the way he says.
[1:03:34] [laughter]
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; So beautiful.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; You know, why were they why were they in
[1:03:40] this position, brothers and sisters?
[1:03:42] Why were they in this position? because
[1:03:44] they actually forsook the word of God.
[1:03:47] And and what word of God? The word of
[1:03:49] God through the prophet.
[1:03:52] Because God never came down and spoke to
[1:03:53] the children of Israel himself. He gave
[1:03:56] them Moses.
[1:03:58] And God never came down and spoke to the
[1:04:00] children of children of Israel himself.
[1:04:02] He he when Moses passed away, he gave
[1:04:04] them Joshua.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And Joshua is the one that they ought to
[1:04:09] have been listening to. But you know
[1:04:11] when they were being positioned in the
[1:04:13] land in in in Judges chapter 1, you
[1:04:17] know, it came to the place in the book
[1:04:18] of Judges where every man they they just
[1:04:22] did everything that was fine in their
[1:04:25] own sight, right? Everything that they
[1:04:28] felt was okay in their own sight, they
[1:04:31] just did. Why was that? Because they
[1:04:34] came to a place of callousness.
[1:04:37] You know, brother Brandham in the church
[1:04:38] age book, he talks about what causes
[1:04:40] people, what causes the devil to get a
[1:04:42] foothold in people's life. He says
[1:04:44] sickness,
[1:04:46] disease,
[1:04:48] indifference, and sin, unbelief,
[1:04:52] indifference, just being like, "Yeah,
[1:04:54] it's the message. I know it. I've been
[1:04:56] in it my whole entire life. There's
[1:04:58] nothing that you could ever teach me or
[1:04:59] tell me." As soon as that comes out, you
[1:05:01] know what? You're right. You're 100%
[1:05:03] right. But you can have sin, which is
[1:05:07] unbelief. You can have indifference,
[1:05:10] or you can have an illness. And all of
[1:05:12] those things will cause people to become
[1:05:14] callous towards the word of God,
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; the living word of God. And that's all
[1:05:19] we're talking about. We're not talking
[1:05:20] about the historical records. Even
[1:05:22] though we are talking about the story of
[1:05:23] Gideon, I I'm trying to encourage us to
[1:05:26] recognize, let's resurrect Jesus Christ
[1:05:28] from 2,000 years ago and see him alive
[1:05:30] and well in our lives. Amen.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; And if we're not seeing that in our
[1:05:34] lives, then I want to encourage us to
[1:05:36] seek that. Put a fleece before the Lord
[1:05:38] and say, "If you are God, then be God to
[1:05:41] me. Show me that fleece will only be wet
[1:05:44] and all of the ground will be dry." And
[1:05:45] then, you know what? JUST ONE MORE TIME,
[1:05:47] don't be angry. DON'T GET HOT WITH ME,
[1:05:50] BUT SHOW ME THAT THE GROUND CAN be wet
[1:05:52] and that fleece can be dry. Be God to me
[1:05:54] in the way that I need to see it. And I
[1:05:56] promise you, brothers and sisters, he
[1:05:58] will do it.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you know what? First, we
[1:06:02] got to be willing to tear down those
[1:06:03] altars. We got to be willing to tear
[1:06:05] down all that we think we know. We got
[1:06:08] to be willing to GET OURSELVES
[1:06:09] COMPLETELY HUMBLE IN THE sight of the
[1:06:11] Lord so that he can lift us up.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Or else, forget it.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; The only thing we're doing is playing
[1:06:17] religion.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, what did they
[1:06:21] do? They didn't kick out the inhabitants
[1:06:23] of the land. That's what happened,
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:26] God through the prophet Joshua told him,
[1:06:29] "You can have the promised land as long
[1:06:31] as you actually follow my word and serve
[1:06:35] the Lord. You will have peace. You will
[1:06:38] have tranquility. You will have this
[1:06:40] land that is large, that flows with milk
[1:06:44] and honey, with pomegranates, with
[1:06:46] grapes, with figs. You'll have cities
[1:06:49] THAT YOU NEVER BUILT, HOUSES THAT YOU
[1:06:51] CAN INHABIT, GARDENS THAT YOU NEVER
[1:06:53] PLANTED. ALL OF THIS WILL BE yours if
[1:06:56] you follow the word of the vindicated
[1:07:00] prophet Joshua.
[1:07:02] But what happened was they got into the
[1:07:04] land and they just they just didn't do
[1:07:07] it. They started to ask questions like
[1:07:09] in the book of Judges 1 verse one. After
[1:07:12] the death of Joshua, it came to pass the
[1:07:15] children of Israel asked the Lord
[1:07:16] saying, "Who shall go for us against the
[1:07:19] Canaanites first to fight against them?"
[1:07:22] And the Lord said, "Judah."
[1:07:25] And we know that he went out and he
[1:07:27] actually did fight with them, but he
[1:07:29] never destroyed them.
[1:07:32] Judah went with Simeon, his brother.
[1:07:35] This is verse 17. And they slew the
[1:07:37] Canaanites that inhabited Zapath and
[1:07:40] utterly destroyed it. They destroyed
[1:07:42] that place.
[1:07:44] And the name of the city was called
[1:07:46] Horma. And Judah took Gaza with the
[1:07:50] coast thereof, and Ascalon on the coast
[1:07:52] thereof, and Echron, and the coast
[1:07:54] thereof. And the Lord was with Judah,
[1:07:57] and drove out the inhabitants of the
[1:07:59] mountain.
[1:08:00] Oh,
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; but could not drive out the inhabitants
[1:08:05] of the valley because they had chariots
[1:08:08] of iron. But if you go back in Joshua, I
[1:08:11] feel like I want to start preaching now.
[1:08:13] If you go back in the book of Joshua,
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; he said to them, "How long are you going
[1:08:18] to be SLACK IN YOUR PROMISE?"
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; HERE WE ARE. We're in the promised land,
[1:08:23] but you're not doing anything about
[1:08:25] going and getting into your own
[1:08:27] inheritance.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; What you're doing is living in other
[1:08:30] people's inheritances. And they said,
[1:08:32] "Oh, don't you know that they have
[1:08:34] chariots of iron down in the valleys?"
[1:08:36] And Joshua SAID, "WHAT'S THAT TO US?
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; God is more THAN ABLE. HE PUT US here in
[1:08:42] this land.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; How long are you GOING TO BE SLACK IN
[1:08:46] THE PROMISE OF GOD? GO TAKE the land.
[1:08:49] It's yours.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; And the children of Benjamin. Verse 21.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; The children of Benjamin did not drive
[1:09:01] out the Jebusites that inhabited
[1:09:03] Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with
[1:09:06] the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to
[1:09:08] this day. Verse 27, neither did Manasseh
[1:09:12] drive out the inhabitants of Bashin and
[1:09:15] her towns.
[1:09:19] My verse 30, neither did Zebulun drive
[1:09:22] out the inhabitants
[1:09:26] of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nabal,
[1:09:30] and the Canaanites dwell among them, and
[1:09:32] became tributaries.
[1:09:35] Neither did Asher drive out the
[1:09:36] inhabitants of Ako, nor the inhabitants
[1:09:40] of Zidon, nor Halib.
[1:09:44] Verse 33, neither did Nefali drive out
[1:09:46] the inhabitants of Bethimesh.
[1:09:50] What's going on here?
[1:09:52] The prophet went off the scene and
[1:09:55] suddenly all these people now just got
[1:09:58] slack concerning the promise of God.
[1:10:02] I want to encourage us today, brothers
[1:10:04] and sisters. Let's not get slack
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; concerning the promise of God.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Let's let's actually work towards the
[1:10:10] encouragement to put him to the test.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Not to make him clown. We're not
[1:10:15] interested in signs and wonders, but
[1:10:17] what we are interested is having him as
[1:10:19] the head of our home. Having him as the
[1:10:22] head of our church, having him as the
[1:10:24] one who is leading and guiding us
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; in every single aspect of our lives. We
[1:10:30] don't want to be like these children of
[1:10:31] Israel. They just didn't drive out all
[1:10:33] the enemy. Why didn't they do it?
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; They just got slack.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; My We got most of them out of the way.
[1:10:40] It's probably going to be okay. But we
[1:10:42] know that Joshua was told, "Don't spare
[1:10:44] one of them.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Don't spare one of them. A man, a woman,
[1:10:48] grandma, grandpa, children."
[1:10:52] Terrible to think about. That's the Old
[1:10:54] Testament law. Now, some people today,
[1:10:56] just for the record, because we're being
[1:10:58] recorded and streamed, some people today
[1:11:00] would say maybe they're talking about uh
[1:11:02] creating some kind of a war. A Christian
[1:11:05] is never going to go and actually harm
[1:11:07] another person.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; That's not going to happen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; The Christian's going to get hurt by
[1:11:12] another person. That's what's going to
[1:11:13] happen. We're not talking about slaying
[1:11:15] people. We're talking about slaying
[1:11:17] devils.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; The devils like to get a foothold, a
[1:11:20] stronghold in the lives of people. We
[1:11:23] love people. We hate devils.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; That's the correction. That's the exact
[1:11:30] interpretation of what I'm saying. We're
[1:11:32] talking about a spiritual warfare,
[1:11:33] brothers and sisters. We're not dealing
[1:11:35] with human beings. We're not wrestling
[1:11:37] against flesh and blood. If we take a
[1:11:39] look at the laws of the lands now, it's
[1:11:42] it's it really is crazy when you look at
[1:11:45] it humanly speaking.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop there because I don't
[1:11:48] want to get political, even though I
[1:11:49] really do. I really really do.
[1:11:53] But I just I I'll say this. I think it's
[1:11:55] absolut Isn't it it's it's absolutely
[1:11:57] insane. It's it's mentally deranged for
[1:12:01] a man to think that he can go and
[1:12:04] actually change his gender and have all
[1:12:06] of those genetics and still compete with
[1:12:08] women in women's sport.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; It's because he can't make it in men's
[1:12:14] sports.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; It's ridiculous. It's insane.
[1:12:20] And that's not even the tip of the
[1:12:22] iceberg for what's going on. I don't
[1:12:23] want to get political and talk that way.
[1:12:25] But brothers AND SISTERS, MY POINT IS
[1:12:27] LOOK AT THE DAY IN which we're living
[1:12:28] in. We're living right between the days
[1:12:30] of Noah when men were evil in their
[1:12:33] hearts continually and the day in which
[1:12:35] it WAS IN SODOM. WE'RE CAUGHT RIGHT IN
[1:12:37] THE MIDDLE of that.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; But there is a delivering power from all
[1:12:42] that.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And we don't HAVE TO BE SUBJECT to it.
[1:12:45] We love the sinner, but we hate the sin.
[1:12:53] I didn't even get into where I wanted to
[1:12:55] today, but I'm I'm just going to read
[1:12:57] this little bit here. I'll call the
[1:12:58] musicians as we as we bring it to a
[1:13:00] close. I didn't even get to read a quote
[1:13:02] today. [laughter]
[1:13:04] I've got some that I really want to
[1:13:05] bring, but you know, verse chapter
[1:13:08] chapter 2 of Judges, we just read about
[1:13:10] how they just didn't they just weren't
[1:13:12] interested for whatever the reason to go
[1:13:14] and actually really do what they were
[1:13:16] commissioned to do. They weren't going
[1:13:18] to die. There was no man that could
[1:13:19] stand against them all the days of their
[1:13:21] life so long as they followed the Lord.
[1:13:23] But Judges chapter 2, an angel of the
[1:13:26] Lord came up from Gilgal unto Bochim and
[1:13:30] said, I made you to go out of Egypt, and
[1:13:34] have brought you unto the land which I
[1:13:37] swear unto your fathers, and I said, I
[1:13:40] will never break my covenant with you.
[1:13:44] the Lord speaking to them. And ye shall
[1:13:47] make no league with the inhabitants of
[1:13:50] this land. Ye shall throw down their
[1:13:52] altars.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Remember, he's the same yesterday,
[1:13:58] today, and forever.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, I want to tell you
[1:14:01] today, if you've got an altar, if we've
[1:14:02] got an altar to anything,
[1:14:05] anything
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; but the word of God, tear it down.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Tear it down.
[1:14:15] He says, "But ye have not obeyed my
[1:14:17] voice.
[1:14:19] Why have ye done this?
[1:14:21] Why is it?
[1:14:24] Why would we keep an altar in our lives?
[1:14:27] Why would we keep something that's going
[1:14:29] to take us from the promise of God in
[1:14:32] our lives?"
[1:14:34] I want to encourage us today, brothers
[1:14:36] and sisters.
[1:14:38] If you want to see if God is real to
[1:14:40] you,
[1:14:42] just put a fleece out before him. But
[1:14:44] before you do it, don't think he's going
[1:14:46] to come and answer. You got to be
[1:14:48] willing to shred all that you think you
[1:14:50] know.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Take all of those trees that you cut
[1:14:54] down from that grove. Don't save one of
[1:14:56] them so you can save a little sapling
[1:14:58] just in case God doesn't answer you. Or
[1:15:00] a seed so that you can go and actually
[1:15:02] save it, dry it out, and go and plant
[1:15:04] another grove in case God doesn't come
[1:15:06] and answer you. No, take it all and burn
[1:15:09] it.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; BURN IT ON THE sacrifice of the old
[1:15:13] man's life.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Let that old guy die on that altar
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; and see if God won't be God.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me today as we close.
[1:15:28] I'll read this quote here as we close.
[1:15:30] If God be with us, then where is all the
[1:15:32] miracles? in 1961.
[1:15:36] He says, "If God remains God, lay your
[1:15:38] sinful soul on his altar and he'll touch
[1:15:42] it with the power of his word
[1:15:46] and his power and the world will be gone
[1:15:50] from you and then you'll be a new
[1:15:54] creature
[1:15:56] if he remains God."
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; How many witnesses are there here today
[1:16:02] that he remains God?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; He was God of the Old Testament. He was
[1:16:08] God of the New Testament. He's the same
[1:16:10] God today, yesterday, today, and
[1:16:12] forever. And you know then down in your
[1:16:14] heart that a supernatural work has been
[1:16:17] done by a supernatural being. You cannot
[1:16:20] behave the way that you do now on your
[1:16:23] own. There's no way that you could ever
[1:16:25] do it. When you once drank and smoked
[1:16:30] AND LIED AND YOU WOMEN loved the world
[1:16:33] so much, you kept wearing your makeup a
[1:16:36] or short hair and doing other things you
[1:16:40] did. And you find out that something
[1:16:42] happens
[1:16:45] that all the devils in hell couldn't
[1:16:47] make you do it again.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Something happened. A God of miracles
[1:16:56] performed. What did he do? He changed
[1:16:58] your vile heart,
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; changed your desires, changed your
[1:17:02] nature.
[1:17:04] That's what we're talking about today,
[1:17:05] brothers and sisters. Even though we're
[1:17:06] talking about the inhabitants of the
[1:17:08] land, our promised land today is the
[1:17:11] Holy Ghost. Don't let a devil try and
[1:17:13] talk you out of that Holy Ghost blessing
[1:17:15] in your life.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; He'll change your vile heart. He'll
[1:17:20] change your desires. He'll change your
[1:17:22] nature.
[1:17:24] And it has to be him that does it.
[1:17:25] Because many times people will say,
[1:17:27] "Well, I tried, but I just couldn't do
[1:17:28] it. I just couldn't do it." You never
[1:17:30] can. You never will.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; We never will. It's got to be him.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And us dying to ourselves every day so
[1:17:37] that he can live.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; A supernatural word by a supernatural
[1:17:42] God made a creature of time, a human
[1:17:45] being, turn into a creature of eternity.
[1:17:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Took the world out of you and put Christ
[1:17:53] in you,
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory and you're filled with
[1:17:56] his spirit and ready to meet him.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; How many here today are ready to meet
[1:18:01] him?
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; It's never been closer, brothers and
[1:18:04] sisters. Let's just bow in prayer.
[1:18:07] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:18:09] you for your word.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the many stories in the
[1:18:13] Bible, Lord. Thank you, Father, that
[1:18:15] this this Gideon, Father, he he was a
[1:18:18] victim of the circumstances,
[1:18:21] of his family traditions, oh Lord, but
[1:18:24] you still came to him.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we thank you that Lord, we
[1:18:28] can look at our lives and say that you
[1:18:30] did the same for us. You gave us the
[1:18:32] ability to hear your voice, Lord. It's
[1:18:34] not something that anybody could do
[1:18:36] except for you. And we thank you for
[1:18:38] that, Lord. Thank you that you came and
[1:18:41] took us and took out the stony heart,
[1:18:43] Lord, and gave us a heart of flesh with
[1:18:46] your spirit in it, Lord Jesus. Father,
[1:18:48] that we would have the desire to serve
[1:18:50] you. That we would have the desire to
[1:18:51] worship you. Father, we love you and we
[1:18:54] thank you today. I pray that, Lord
[1:18:57] Jesus, we all would be able to see you
[1:18:59] as the living God in our lives. Father,
[1:19:01] that our children wouldn't see a
[1:19:03] religion, but that they would see a
[1:19:05] living God. Oh heavenly father, that
[1:19:07] everyone in the assemblies around us,
[1:19:10] Father, would see a living God. That it
[1:19:12] wouldn't be some form of worship. Oh
[1:19:15] Lord Jesus, that it would truly be the
[1:19:18] great I am for today.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you would be with
[1:19:22] those who are away today. Father, I
[1:19:24] think of the work in Lethbridge and the
[1:19:26] brothers with their shoulder to the
[1:19:28] wheel. Father, continue blessing them
[1:19:29] abundantly. Father, above all they could
[1:19:32] ask or think. Be with the saints in
[1:19:33] Lethbridge, Lord. Father, let them
[1:19:35] continually be encouraged by new growth
[1:19:38] in the assembly. Father, Lord, we're not
[1:19:40] interested in numbers, but Lord Jesus,
[1:19:43] that last predestinated seed, that is
[1:19:45] the goal. We pray that you would just
[1:19:48] continue to encourage the work in
[1:19:49] Lethbridge, Lord. Father, we pray for
[1:19:51] Brother Toby and Sister Faith, Lord,
[1:19:53] that you would just continue leading and
[1:19:55] guiding them, Lord, in their journey,
[1:19:57] Father. Lord, we just pray that Lord,
[1:20:00] you would help us, Lord, to encourage
[1:20:02] them, to be an encouragement to them,
[1:20:04] Father.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just ask also that you
[1:20:07] would be with each and everyone, Father,
[1:20:09] who couldn't be here for whatever
[1:20:11] reason, maybe working or traveling. Keep
[1:20:13] your hand upon them, Lord Jesus. Maybe
[1:20:15] some sick in their body. Raise them up
[1:20:17] in the name of Jesus. Thank you for
[1:20:19] touching Sister Rebecca. Lord, Father,
[1:20:21] we know that you are a living God, and
[1:20:23] we're so happy that we can serve you as
[1:20:25] a living God to us now. Father, as we go
[1:20:28] our separate ways, we pray that you
[1:20:30] would just be glorified in a few songs
[1:20:32] that we sing. And Lord, that if it be
[1:20:35] your will for us to gather again on
[1:20:36] Wednesday, we'll be careful to give you
[1:20:38] all the praise.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just love you and we
[1:20:42] thank you. We ask all of these things.
[1:20:45] In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:52] The name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[1:20:57] The name of the Lord is
[1:21:02] a strong tower.
[1:21:06] The righteous run into it
[1:21:11] and they are saved.
[1:21:17] Lord is

[1:22:14] [singing and music]
[1:22:16] and they are saved.

[1:23:18] [singing] the way thou hast [music]
[1:23:20] gone. Leading straight to the land of

[1:26:52] We [music] all

[1:26:57] What a day.
[1:27:02] [music] Oh, when we [singing] all

[1:27:27] what.

[1:27:50] see Jesus.
[1:27:53] We'll sing and we'll [music] shout the

[1:28:17] [music]
[1:28:22] Oh, [singing]
[1:28:23] [music]
[1:28:26] what a day. I'm rejoicing [music] that
[1:28:30] will be
[1:28:32] when we all
[1:28:39] shout.
[1:28:41] When we [music] all get to heaven. When
[1:28:43] we all

[1:29:09] Isn't it wonderful that we don't have to
[1:29:11] wait?
[1:29:13] We can do it right now. Why don't we
[1:29:15] sing original life?

[1:29:21] you and me, brothers and sisters.
[1:29:24] Tremendous.
[1:29:26] God's attributes were manifested to his
[1:29:30] bride this last age. Have you caught it?
[1:29:35] By the last prophet's [music] message.
[1:29:37] [singing] And we know who we are and
[1:29:41] what [music] we're raised up for. Praise
[1:29:43] the Lord. [singing]

[1:30:06] life,

[1:30:11] We are [singing] the word made flesh
[1:30:13] today. This is what the scriptures
[1:30:15] [music]
[1:30:16] say. And our [singing] names are seen
[1:30:18] within life. [music]
[1:30:22] Yes, we are anointed. Oh, and we
[1:30:26] [music and singing] are inspired by our
[1:30:28] God.
[1:30:30] The original life. [music and singing]

[1:31:50] this hour [music]
[1:31:53] to be over. Oh, glory hallelujah
[1:31:56] [singing]
[1:31:57] to our God.

[1:32:48] blessed beyond measure
[1:32:52] and by his strength the Lord. [music]
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:33:00] [music and singing]
[1:33:03] Count successes
[1:33:06] like [singing] diamonds in my hand.
[1:33:09] [music]
[1:33:12] Those trophies could not be

[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:34:28] I seek no [singing] greater honor
[1:34:32] than just to know you all
[1:34:35] [music and singing]
[1:34:38] and to count my gains [music] for losses
[1:34:42] to the Lord.
