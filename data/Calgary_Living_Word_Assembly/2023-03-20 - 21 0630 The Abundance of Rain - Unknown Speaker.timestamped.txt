[58:14] certainly a blessing to be here tonight
[58:15] why don't while you're standing why
[58:16] don't we just bow our heads for a word
[58:18] of prayer Heavenly Father we want to
[58:20] give you thanks again this evening Lord
[58:22] for another opportunity Lord
[58:25] Lord we realize father that the laws of
[58:28] the land have uh have
[58:31] put us in such a place Lord that we are
[58:33] we've had to be in obedience to them
[58:36] Lord
[58:37] and we are as children of God we know
[58:39] that we are not above the laws except
[58:42] the time comes when they tell us what we
[58:44] can't preach
[58:45] and so tonight Lord Jesus we want to
[58:48] respect that as much as we can and Lord
[58:51] we realize that the law that you hold is
[58:54] not constrained by walls and buildings
[58:56] lord it's not constrained by glass we
[58:59] know that this word that with that in is
[59:01] abiding within us is powerful Lord and
[59:04] Lord It's sharper than a two-edged sword
[59:07] Lord is not bound by man's Traditions or
[59:09] man's ideas
[59:10] father it's not even Bound by these
[59:14] walls Lord for we know that across the
[59:16] across the the internet Lord the digital
[59:19] world Lord our voices are being
[59:21] proclaimed and Lord we know that there
[59:23] is a voice that is being proclaimed for
[59:26] the voice of the bride and the voice of
[59:27] the Prophet are saying the same thing in
[59:29] this age Lord there's a bride that's
[59:32] being made ready father and tonight Lord
[59:34] we come for that purpose oh God we just
[59:37] ask that you would wash Us Again by the
[59:39] water of the word take the hearer Lord
[59:41] take the speaker take each one Lord
[59:43] present those that are online Lord break
[59:45] the bread of life to us Lord may we once
[59:48] again may we say it's been good to sit

[1:00:02] seats I just wanna
[1:00:05] take a moment
[1:00:07] and bring greetings from the Tabernacle
[1:00:10] back home
[1:00:11] my brother erno texted me this afternoon
[1:00:13] he said make sure and greet the saints
[1:00:15] that are here and
[1:00:17] and uh brother Blair sister Rebecca good
[1:00:20] to see you I think there's more just
[1:00:22] about as much visitors as there is home
[1:00:24] Folk
[1:00:24] and uh I'll tell you what Sunday is
[1:00:28] going to be a happy day Sunday is going
[1:00:30] to be a happy day and we've all I think
[1:00:33] we've all been subjected long I say this
[1:00:35] we've all been subjected long enough
[1:00:37] and uh I'll just be as much as you're
[1:00:40] looking forward to it we're going to be
[1:00:41] looking forward to it too and we we've
[1:00:43] got to I guess we're just a little
[1:00:45] behind you you guys are ahead of us
[1:00:47] I don't know I think uh what's BC like
[1:00:50] brother Blair
[1:00:52] communistic to the Core
[1:00:54] yeah we'll so are the rest of us you
[1:00:57] know I can say that freely
[1:00:59] I can say that freely
[1:01:01] because a prophet of God said in 1956 or
[1:01:04] 1957 he said that communism has
[1:01:07] honeycombed
[1:01:09] the United States oh it's it's flogged
[1:01:12] it's
[1:01:14] portrayed like we're like we're all just
[1:01:16] Free People we're all free people but
[1:01:18] it's not at all
[1:01:20] there's a spirit that has come up
[1:01:21] underneath and it's absolutely its grip
[1:01:24] has taken a hold and for all these years
[1:01:26] it has suddenly gone this way in that
[1:01:28] way but I'll tell you what a prophet
[1:01:30] told us it was there then now look
[1:01:33] you're seeing with your eyes the force
[1:01:35] that's coming up underneath that little
[1:01:37] spirit that was a uh maybe I'll say it
[1:01:40] like this like was was the white horse
[1:01:41] rider you know better than this but I
[1:01:44] want to portray it just this way in a
[1:01:45] moment you know how he come with his
[1:01:47] little doctrine that we're just Free
[1:01:48] People we're just free it's all good
[1:01:50] it's all good you just go ahead and live
[1:01:52] your life and we can have the Canadian
[1:01:54] dream we can have the America but just
[1:01:56] wait a little while pretty soon he
[1:01:58] begins to show his other face
[1:02:01] and now you're going to do what we're
[1:02:03] going to tell you to do and it won't be
[1:02:04] long this is Brother Brown's talked
[1:02:06] about that he talked about that red
[1:02:08] horse rider he said watch he said his
[1:02:10] sword was bloody red and he said it will
[1:02:13] be that way again
[1:02:15] you see that Spirit hasn't died but
[1:02:17] neither listen church that Spirit hasn't
[1:02:19] died
[1:02:20] but then neither has Christ
[1:02:23] there is a people that are anointed to
[1:02:25] rise up above all that she's not going
[1:02:27] to be here he's going to take her home
[1:02:30] and we're I just believe we're part of
[1:02:32] that people tonight and and I I'm
[1:02:34] thankful to be part of the body of
[1:02:36] Christ I say the body of Christ
[1:02:37] everywhere but uh but here in
[1:02:40] Saskatchewan and uh in in Alberta BC
[1:02:44] isn't it good to know that wherever we
[1:02:47] go that God's got people and that that
[1:02:49] same spirit is what binds us together
[1:02:51] it's it's this word that we hold so dear
[1:02:54] to our hearts
[1:02:55] so real to us

[1:11:45] me this evening
[1:11:49] turn over to the book of First Kings
[1:11:52] chapter 18.
[1:12:01] I was sitting in my truck the other day
[1:12:02] and and just waiting on the Lord and
[1:12:07] you know how sweet he is sometimes he
[1:12:08] just comes right down in there and
[1:12:10] begins to unveil himself and you know
[1:12:12] one little scripture ties to another and
[1:12:14] you're busy writing you're busy writing
[1:12:16] and I thought well that must be what he
[1:12:18] wants me to speak here and uh
[1:12:20] so I I put it all down and
[1:12:23] you know I I couldn't feel that same way
[1:12:25] this afternoon
[1:12:26] and so I don't know what he's got in
[1:12:28] mind
[1:12:29] uh but I feel that this subject tonight
[1:12:32] or this thought tonight will be a
[1:12:34] blessing for you kind of led me this way
[1:12:36] First Kings chapter 18. and I want to
[1:12:39] start reading it verse 41.
[1:12:41] First Kings 18 and 41 and it says Elijah
[1:12:44] Sunday Ahab
[1:12:46] get the up
[1:12:47] eat and drink
[1:12:49] for there is a sound of abundance of
[1:12:52] rain
[1:12:53] so Ahab went to eat and to drink and
[1:12:55] Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and
[1:12:57] he cast himself down upon the Earth and
[1:13:00] put his face between his knees and he
[1:13:02] said to his servant go up now look
[1:13:04] towards the sea and he went up and
[1:13:07] looked and he said there's nothing
[1:13:09] and he said go again seven times
[1:13:13] and it came to pass at the seventh time
[1:13:16] that he said behold there Arise at the
[1:13:17] little Cloud out of the sea like a man's
[1:13:20] hand
[1:13:21] and he said go up say unto Ahab prepare
[1:13:23] thy Chariot and get thee down that the
[1:13:26] rain stopped thee not and it came to
[1:13:28] pass in the meanwhile that the heaven
[1:13:31] was black with clouds and wind and there
[1:13:34] was a great rain
[1:13:35] an Ahab Road and went to Jezreel and the
[1:13:37] Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he
[1:13:39] girded up his loins and ran before Ahab
[1:13:41] to the entrance
[1:13:43] of Jezebel God bless you you can have
[1:13:46] your seats
[1:13:48] if I could uh if I could put a title on
[1:13:50] on my little thought this this evening
[1:13:52] would be the abundance of rain
[1:13:56] you know Elijah had been in a time uh
[1:14:00] this had been an hour in his time this
[1:14:02] has been an hour in their country this
[1:14:04] has been an hour that a people of God
[1:14:06] had actually been in a a a not just a
[1:14:10] spiritual drove but they had been in a
[1:14:12] natural drought
[1:14:13] and the reason that they'd been in a
[1:14:15] natural was was the fact that that uh
[1:14:19] you know they had turned their backs on
[1:14:21] God
[1:14:22] they had they had had a word of God come
[1:14:24] to them they had a prophet in the land
[1:14:26] but the but the world around them had
[1:14:29] been so enticing and to be so let me say
[1:14:32] this way the enemy had been so seducing
[1:14:34] he had been he had been so he had so
[1:14:37] seductively brought them in until the
[1:14:39] place brother Brown said this the
[1:14:40] scripture says this they begin to lust
[1:14:42] after the flesh pots the land they were
[1:14:45] living in had so much to offer and and
[1:14:48] Ahab in his rule you know uh we
[1:14:50] recognize Ahab as an as a backslidden
[1:14:52] Believer brother Branham called him he
[1:14:54] was he actually knew right he was
[1:14:56] actually raised up in in truth and yet
[1:14:59] he got his eyes off the truth and he
[1:15:01] began to he began to uh he began to be
[1:15:04] allured until finally he married a
[1:15:06] jezebel a woman that was actually a
[1:15:09] priestess
[1:15:10] of the Roman gods and and here he is he
[1:15:14] allowed that into his home and he's
[1:15:16] become a he's become a king and the
[1:15:18] whole Kingdom has has spiraled down oh
[1:15:21] how what it should tell us about
[1:15:22] leadership in this hour look at our
[1:15:24] Nations right now look at our countries
[1:15:26] that we're living in look at the very
[1:15:28] situation that's going on here here
[1:15:30] we're sitting tonight and and we could
[1:15:33] call it the same way tonight how you're
[1:15:35] hungry to see this building full of
[1:15:38] Believers again how you desired to see
[1:15:41] the the chairs put out and the and the
[1:15:43] building full and everyone rejoicing and
[1:15:46] and worshiping the very God that that we
[1:15:49] believe that is alive today and and is
[1:15:52] ever present and yet here we are with
[1:15:55] the same desires they were in a natural
[1:15:57] drought and here we are spiritually
[1:15:59] feeling like somehow we've had a drought
[1:16:01] and we need to get back to where we were
[1:16:05] that's how we feel tonight
[1:16:07] we we believe that the word is here we
[1:16:09] believe we've got the word we believe
[1:16:11] but we feel like something's missing
[1:16:13] that that we want to see everything
[1:16:15] restored the way it was before this all
[1:16:18] transpired and we we realize that that
[1:16:21] they had been in a backslidden condition
[1:16:23] they had the nation had come to a
[1:16:26] backslidden place and and they got to
[1:16:28] the place where all they could talk
[1:16:30] about was was what God used to be and
[1:16:33] the things he used to do and how he used
[1:16:36] to be in and oh my listen remember
[1:16:38] Church they were in a drought literally
[1:16:41] the people around them were dying the
[1:16:43] Rivers had dried up the Brooks had dried
[1:16:45] up the streams had dried up cattle had
[1:16:48] died listen we're just experiencing a
[1:16:51] heat wave right now like we've never
[1:16:52] experienced for a long time 36 37
[1:16:55] degrees I'll tell you what if this kept
[1:16:57] on for one month two months those crops
[1:17:00] would burn up and you wouldn't you
[1:17:02] wouldn't think much of it now but come
[1:17:04] fall and your grocery prices Skyrocket
[1:17:07] you would be complaining too pretty soon
[1:17:09] it would be down on your table you'd be
[1:17:11] realizing that there's a cost to
[1:17:13] everything
[1:17:14] and here they got into the place where
[1:17:16] there was where everything their
[1:17:18] sustenance around them had dried up and
[1:17:20] died and and what was God doing
[1:17:24] they had already heard Elijah's message
[1:17:27] they'd already heard the truth they'd
[1:17:29] already heard it and because they
[1:17:31] rejected it now here comes the wrath of
[1:17:34] God upon them
[1:17:36] and God's God's God's come what's he
[1:17:39] doing he's pushing him to a place
[1:17:41] of a showdown
[1:17:44] listen every one of us is going to be
[1:17:46] put in this place tonight
[1:17:48] every one of us is getting is going to
[1:17:50] be pushed to a place where you better
[1:17:52] know where you stand in Christ
[1:17:54] you better know that the god that you're
[1:17:56] serving is not just a letter or a dead
[1:17:58] letter or a gospel that Grandpa preached
[1:18:01] or daddy preached her or Mommy believed
[1:18:03] but that the god that you serve is a
[1:18:05] living God that that he's just as much
[1:18:07] God right now as he has ever been God or
[1:18:10] ever will be God listen he hasn't forgot
[1:18:12] us he hasn't he hasn't just deemed us as
[1:18:15] unimportant but His Eye Is on the
[1:18:17] Sparrow and he's watching us daily
[1:18:20] remember when when Elijah after this
[1:18:23] great Showdown remember Elijah was he
[1:18:25] end up in the wilderness out there and
[1:18:27] he's all troubled and and oh God I'm the
[1:18:29] only one I'm the only one and I've been
[1:18:31] zealous for for the kingdom of God and
[1:18:33] God rebukes him says no Elijah you're
[1:18:35] not the only one There's 7 000 others
[1:18:39] that have never bowed their knee to bail
[1:18:41] they've they've never kissed his finger
[1:18:43] they believe the same message that you
[1:18:45] preach and they're standing faithful on
[1:18:48] it
[1:18:48] listen there is a widow woman they're
[1:18:50] not in that drought there was a widow
[1:18:51] woman that God fed daily
[1:18:54] we're going to promise church that
[1:18:55] regardless of our situation regardless
[1:18:58] of where we're at I don't I don't know
[1:19:00] about you I don't want to be caught just
[1:19:01] talking about a god of the past
[1:19:04] I don't want to just tell everybody
[1:19:06] about the God of the past but I want to
[1:19:08] talk about the God of today I want to
[1:19:10] talk about what God is doing now I want
[1:19:12] to give God glory for for what he's
[1:19:14] doing in my life today for for for
[1:19:16] keeping us and we heard testimony again
[1:19:19] brother Paul you brought it up he's
[1:19:21] Jesus Christ the same cancer means no
[1:19:24] more to him today than it ever did
[1:19:26] tuberculosis means no more kovid means
[1:19:29] means no nothing means any more to God I
[1:19:32] am the Lord your God that healeth all
[1:19:34] your diseases and forgives all your
[1:19:36] iniquities
[1:19:37] I'll tell you what David said blessed is
[1:19:40] the man and whom the Lord impute is not
[1:19:42] his iniquities
[1:19:44] there is a people on Earth that God
[1:19:46] doesn't impute sin and iniquity to
[1:19:48] I want to be that person that's standing
[1:19:50] there that day listen they've been
[1:19:52] standing there here's a prophet of God
[1:19:54] that stood there in that hour he walked
[1:19:56] right up into the face of the king and
[1:19:57] said not even do will fall till I call
[1:20:01] for it you talk about a power that's in
[1:20:03] God's people listen Church you talk
[1:20:05] about this is before the holy ghost ever
[1:20:08] fell
[1:20:09] this is before the holy ghost ever fell
[1:20:11] that same God that was there in Elijah
[1:20:14] that day is the same God you forgive me
[1:20:16] but there's nobody for 30 feet so I can
[1:20:18] just preach over here that same God I
[1:20:20] don't know about you I have a terrible
[1:20:23] time being massed up and being cornered
[1:20:25] up I feel like I'm a dog on a chain when
[1:20:27] I get like this so you just forgive me
[1:20:29] but listen that same God that was in
[1:20:31] Elijah thou walked boldly into the face
[1:20:34] of Ahab and said not even do is going to
[1:20:36] fall until I call for it is the same God
[1:20:39] that is now walking in the midst not
[1:20:41] just in the midst of his people he's
[1:20:43] walking in his people in the darkest
[1:20:46] hour that has ever been
[1:20:49] how blessed are we tonight to know this
[1:20:52] God is leading his guiding he's given us
[1:20:55] a sure a sure Foundation to walk on
[1:20:58] Hallelujah
[1:21:01] what an hour there's their kingdom was
[1:21:03] spiritually dying and and I just want to
[1:21:05] lay this as a background tonight I would
[1:21:07] say this way they had spiritually dried
[1:21:10] up and were dead the joy of the Lord was
[1:21:12] gone their thoughts towards God had been
[1:21:14] skewed they had to entertain the things
[1:21:16] of the world that too many there had
[1:21:18] been too many voices
[1:21:20] that they'd heeded too many voices and
[1:21:23] it had stolen their Joy listen church we
[1:21:25] get caught in these same things there's
[1:21:26] voices voices voices and voices but
[1:21:29] there's only one voice there's only one
[1:21:32] voice that we need to hear and that is
[1:21:35] the voice of God to this age I don't
[1:21:37] care about what John Gormley you guys
[1:21:39] probably don't even get him here he's
[1:21:40] some talk show host I don't care what he
[1:21:42] has to say I don't care what they preach
[1:21:44] I don't care about 540 radio or 650
[1:21:47] radio or enlightened radio or whatever
[1:21:50] other radios you want to listen to It's
[1:21:52] all lying vanities there's one voice
[1:21:55] there's one truth and all other voices
[1:21:58] are meant to distract you they're meant
[1:22:00] to take away or you just feed on that
[1:22:02] for a little while Church you just feed
[1:22:04] on that stuff for a little while you'll
[1:22:06] find yourself just as Barren and as dry
[1:22:09] spiritually as Israel was that day not a
[1:22:12] blade of grass not a flower not nothing
[1:22:14] was growing why because they had turned
[1:22:17] their they turned their ears and their
[1:22:18] hearts from the one true living God
[1:22:21] you do the same and you'll find you sit
[1:22:23] here tonight in a message Church totally
[1:22:26] dried up spiritually and wondering where
[1:22:28] is that God of Elijah
[1:22:31] hallelujah oh God be merciful listen the
[1:22:34] word that was sent is powerful it's
[1:22:37] Sharp
[1:22:38] God sent it for a purpose he said did
[1:22:40] not it was a rebuke Ahab but listen it
[1:22:42] was life to that little widow woman
[1:22:45] the same God the same word the same
[1:22:48] voice it was a rebuke to Ahab but it was
[1:22:51] life to a little widow woman
[1:22:53] both of them starving
[1:22:55] Hallelujah when God speaks once if God
[1:22:59] ever says anything
[1:23:01] it can never be changed
[1:23:03] it's the end of it
[1:23:05] brother Brown says this
[1:23:07] he says it says Oh my he says he says
[1:23:10] I'm going to tell you something that's
[1:23:11] going to choke you I'm going to say it
[1:23:13] man is omnipotent you don't believe that
[1:23:15] but he is
[1:23:17] a man that's fully surrendered to God
[1:23:21] is omnipotent
[1:23:23] omnipotent what is the word omnipotent
[1:23:25] means
[1:23:27] a power without bounds or authority
[1:23:31] without bounds here's Elijah walking
[1:23:34] into the face of a man here's a man a
[1:23:37] man born in sin shaped a a man
[1:23:39] that had a temper a man that had
[1:23:41] problems in his life here's a man
[1:23:43] walking into the face of another man and
[1:23:45] saying not even do is going to fall kill
[1:23:48] I call for it
[1:23:49] if some if if I said that to you would
[1:23:51] say who Do You Think You Are
[1:23:55] but he had thus saith the Lord
[1:23:57] he had thus saith the Lord a man's voice
[1:24:01] God in a man
[1:24:04] you don't believe in a man that's fully
[1:24:06] surrendered to God oh Church of God how
[1:24:08] we ought to be so surrendered tonight
[1:24:10] did not he say in Mark 11 22 whatsoever
[1:24:13] you say you don't doubt it'll come to
[1:24:15] pass you can have what you said now
[1:24:18] listen what happens when two omnipotents
[1:24:20] meet when God and man comes together
[1:24:23] through omnipotence some things got to
[1:24:26] shake
[1:24:28] whosoever you would say with that
[1:24:30] creative power of omnipotence of God
[1:24:34] knowing that he promised it he said it
[1:24:38] in his word it creates a power that goes
[1:24:41] out yonder and brings things to pass
[1:24:46] what's the Holy Spirit been trying to
[1:24:48] get to us for the last 50 years Church
[1:24:51] you say well brother Dwayne you haven't
[1:24:52] even served in God 50 years you're right
[1:24:53] I haven't even been serving God 50 years
[1:24:55] but that same voice
[1:24:57] that same word that came back in 1947
[1:25:00] 1949 what is the holy spirit been trying
[1:25:02] to get to the church
[1:25:04] to his little elect lady that you and
[1:25:07] him are one and the same
[1:25:10] it's not just God that you know we get
[1:25:12] so tied up on the godhead thinking oh
[1:25:14] yeah father son Holy Ghost that's a
[1:25:16] trinity Doctrine but listen there's such
[1:25:18] a reality to this they are one the
[1:25:21] father and the son are one but Jesus
[1:25:23] said that we also are one like him
[1:25:26] and that's what Satan has been trying to
[1:25:28] keep from us that you are actually the
[1:25:30] very spirit being of God manifested now
[1:25:33] in a many-membered body that makes you
[1:25:36] the omnipotence of God being manifested
[1:25:39] now oh how powerful are the words we
[1:25:42] speak tonight
[1:25:43] no wonder Satan wants you to discourage
[1:25:46] you no wonder he wants to get you
[1:25:47] distracted because if we can ever get
[1:25:49] surrendered to God what is going to
[1:25:51] stand in the way of this little elect
[1:25:53] lady not nothing not no devil in hell
[1:25:56] not no not no seducing Spirit not no
[1:25:58] Antichrist Spirit not nothing is going
[1:26:01] to stand in her way
[1:26:02] Hallelujah whatever you say
[1:26:05] would that creative power of omnipotence
[1:26:07] of God knowing he promised it he said it
[1:26:10] in his word it creates a power that goes
[1:26:13] out yonder and brings things to pass
[1:26:16] things that is not it makes them as
[1:26:18] though they are because what two
[1:26:20] omnipotents have met listen he's not
[1:26:23] talking about himself he's not talking
[1:26:25] about Elijah of old he's not talking
[1:26:27] about some prophet of gone days not a
[1:26:30] Daniel not an Ezekiel not a Jeremiah
[1:26:32] he's not talking about just a preacher
[1:26:34] he is literally talking about you and
[1:26:37] Christ are one and if he can recognize
[1:26:40] what we are that's why we're here to let
[1:26:41] the word wash us that if we can
[1:26:43] recognize what we are by the grace of
[1:26:46] God
[1:26:47] listen we're nothing on our own but by
[1:26:50] the grace of God Jesus could say I come
[1:26:52] from God I go to God this little bride
[1:26:55] is saying I come from God this world's
[1:26:57] not my home I'm going back to God what
[1:27:00] is God we want to make him one like our
[1:27:02] finger but he's a many-membered being
[1:27:04] his spirit is just how do you contain
[1:27:07] God
[1:27:09] if he's God now in this flesh listen
[1:27:11] church if that God is living in this
[1:27:13] flesh is there not enough power in this
[1:27:16] flesh to step into another another
[1:27:18] dimension another world in the moment in
[1:27:20] the twinkling of an eye
[1:27:22] he's promised it's gonna happen
[1:27:24] Hallelujah I'm so thankful for the word
[1:27:27] that's coming this hour that same word
[1:27:29] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:27:31] word is with God and the Word was God
[1:27:32] and the Word was made flesh and we want
[1:27:36] to say and that was Jesus yes it was but
[1:27:40] he was the firstborn of many brothers is
[1:27:42] what the scripture says what is that
[1:27:44] that's a supernatural being in a fleshly
[1:27:47] body a God man in a fleshly body what
[1:27:51] about you what about me
[1:27:52] same God men in a fleshly body have
[1:27:56] taken on the very name Jesus
[1:27:59] Jesus and there's no other name in
[1:28:02] heaven there's no other name on Earth
[1:28:04] there's no other name anywheres every
[1:28:06] knee will bow to that name and someday
[1:28:09] not to us but to the lamb that was slain
[1:28:13] and tonight we can bow our knees in
[1:28:16] glory and honor and praise to know that
[1:28:19] he I was there then and now he placed me
[1:28:22] here now that I might reflect him in
[1:28:25] this age for what for one purpose that
[1:28:28] this world this world here in Calgary
[1:28:30] would know Jesus Christ lives
[1:28:33] Hallelujah God's got people right now a
[1:28:36] church I feel good tonight God's got
[1:28:38] people right now in the 20th century
[1:28:40] that literally are manifesting God to
[1:28:43] this present world and they're blind and
[1:28:46] they're and they can't know it they
[1:28:48] don't know it they can't see it there he
[1:28:50] is just like he was then walking amongst
[1:28:53] them and they knew him not you and I are
[1:28:55] walking amongst them in this world and
[1:28:57] they can't recognize that there goes
[1:28:59] Christ
[1:29:00] there goes Christ but blessed are your
[1:29:03] eyes
[1:29:04] they see all my praise God how are we to
[1:29:08] treat one another church but we're if
[1:29:09] our eyes are open to this how are we to
[1:29:12] treat one another I want our words to be
[1:29:15] to each other oh God help us tonight
[1:29:18] oh I need you Lord I need you
[1:29:21] praise the Lord Elijah come back with
[1:29:23] purpose
[1:29:24] Elijah was sent back into ahab's present
[1:29:27] with purpose
[1:29:29] he had already called the drought on the
[1:29:31] land but now God told him you go back
[1:29:34] what was he doing now I want us to stop
[1:29:36] and think for a minute because we can
[1:29:38] find a parallel in this to the very
[1:29:40] things that's happened in our in our own
[1:29:42] day
[1:29:43] here's Elijah has walked back into an
[1:29:45] into a nation of God's people that is
[1:29:48] absolutely turned their back on him and
[1:29:51] Elijah's message has not only brought
[1:29:53] Redemption for for a little widow woman
[1:29:56] but it's actually brought a curse upon
[1:29:58] the whole nation same message and now
[1:30:01] God tells him go back
[1:30:03] go back I'm going to bring my word to a
[1:30:05] showdown the word that I have there
[1:30:07] present in that hour is going to stand
[1:30:09] good for The Showdown
[1:30:11] so here comes Elijah he he walks right
[1:30:14] back up into aab's presence he says
[1:30:16] gather the people together
[1:30:18] gather the people together we're going
[1:30:20] to find out if this word listen Church
[1:30:22] it's coming
[1:30:24] it's coming this word that you've been
[1:30:26] washing yourself with this word that
[1:30:28] you've been feeding on you've taken the
[1:30:30] book and you've eaten the book and the
[1:30:32] book is becoming life in you this very
[1:30:34] word that you're feeding on tonight is
[1:30:37] going to be the very word that's going
[1:30:38] to stand up right in the face of it all
[1:30:40] and it will overcome it does overcome it
[1:30:44] has overcome but one day it's going to
[1:30:46] give you a body change the final thing
[1:30:48] to overcome
[1:30:49] is going to be what I want to say this
[1:30:51] right now gravity holds us here
[1:30:54] this whole this being is caught in this
[1:30:56] Dimension but there's one thing coming
[1:30:58] that's there's not going to be it's no
[1:31:00] more is it going to be held in this
[1:31:01] demand we're going to cross dimensions
[1:31:03] I'll tell you what it makes me think of
[1:31:05] this now this forgive me if this sounds
[1:31:06] terrible but you think of the perversion
[1:31:08] of this world they've got cross dressers
[1:31:10] what are they doing men trying to be
[1:31:11] women women trying to be men but here we
[1:31:14] are as sons of God in this hour we come
[1:31:16] from a different dimension standing here
[1:31:18] on this Earth we've crossed Dimensions
[1:31:20] do you realize right now Time and
[1:31:22] Eternity is Blended
[1:31:24] it's Blended you are coming from an
[1:31:26] eternal an eternal Dimension and living
[1:31:29] in a in in a in a Time Dimension but
[1:31:32] your spirit man is calling something is
[1:31:34] calling your your theophan he's drawing
[1:31:36] you and you're actually rising up in the
[1:31:39] presence of God here the spirit of God
[1:31:41] has told you come up a little higher and
[1:31:43] you're moving
[1:31:45] you say well I don't see it brother
[1:31:46] Dwayne you are because if you're the
[1:31:47] same person as you were three years ago
[1:31:49] you got a problem
[1:31:51] if you're the same person you worked a
[1:31:53] month ago you got a problem
[1:31:55] he's called us to come up higher
[1:31:57] so every day we need to be moving on
[1:31:59] moving on moving on praise God
[1:32:03] Elijah come back to put things my
[1:32:05] goodness I won't need these things
[1:32:06] pretty soon I'm thankful for that Elijah
[1:32:09] had come back to put things in order
[1:32:11] and isn't that just what God did to this
[1:32:13] age to the to the very last age he
[1:32:15] brought in Elijah on the scene for what
[1:32:17] for one purpose to bring things back
[1:32:19] into order what for because there was a
[1:32:22] people that God was going to Rapture
[1:32:24] there was a people that God was dealing
[1:32:26] with he'd come for his own people so
[1:32:28] here comes Elijah and if you go back and
[1:32:31] read the story we're not going to do it
[1:32:32] tonight but you go back and read the
[1:32:34] story you'll find out Elijah calls a
[1:32:36] showdown and the word always brings a
[1:32:38] showdown in our in our lives church
[1:32:40] every time you watch Daily the word is
[1:32:43] bringing a showdown in your life
[1:32:45] absolutely you're going to be faced with
[1:32:47] something tomorrow that the word the
[1:32:49] holy spirit is going to say
[1:32:50] you got a choice to make what are you
[1:32:52] going to make
[1:32:53] I wouldn't do that son
[1:32:55] I wouldn't do that daughter
[1:32:57] that little still small voice
[1:32:59] is going to cause you to make a decision
[1:33:01] I believe this that we're sons of God
[1:33:03] led by the spirit of God therefore that
[1:33:05] God will give us the ability to make the
[1:33:07] right decisions
[1:33:08] I just believe that but Elijah had come
[1:33:11] on the scene and now there was going to
[1:33:12] be a showdown he gathered he said he
[1:33:15] says call in all the prophets of Baal
[1:33:16] call in all call in all the prophets
[1:33:19] that sit at Jezebel's table
[1:33:22] you know there was a god called Prophet
[1:33:24] standing there and he was calling for
[1:33:26] all the what we call him
[1:33:30] the prophets of Baal were one one group
[1:33:32] of prophets
[1:33:33] but there was another group of prophets
[1:33:35] that were the prophets to Israel that
[1:33:36] sat at Jezebel's table simply because
[1:33:38] she fed them
[1:33:41] and therefore they didn't have the
[1:33:42] courage to speak truth
[1:33:45] God will judge them thus
[1:33:48] he said call him in
[1:33:50] call them in
[1:33:52] let's put God to the test let's put
[1:33:54] God's word to test now that's a good
[1:33:55] thing for us tonight
[1:33:57] Calgary Living Word let's put God to the
[1:34:00] test
[1:34:00] God don't mind being tested listen this
[1:34:03] great God we serve he don't mind being
[1:34:04] tested you got a problem go to God
[1:34:08] you go tell them about your problem but
[1:34:10] don't stand there and boohoo about it
[1:34:11] and don't stand there and weep and
[1:34:12] complain about it and don't stand listen
[1:34:14] that widow woman I'm sure she wasn't
[1:34:16] boohooing she was simply trusting God
[1:34:20] in all of the all of the drought in all
[1:34:23] of the trial and all the struggle
[1:34:25] watching her own children waning away
[1:34:27] her own little son waning away she was
[1:34:30] still trusting God
[1:34:32] I believe that we have the same
[1:34:34] opportunity tonight God gives us the
[1:34:36] opportunity tonight to trust him I'll
[1:34:38] tell you what so yeah absolutely he lets
[1:34:40] things go wrong he lets them go that way
[1:34:43] on purpose what for so that we can put
[1:34:45] his word to the test father you said so
[1:34:48] Lord you see my situation I don't know
[1:34:50] what to do about it but you promised me
[1:34:51] Lord that not only would you not leave
[1:34:53] me or forsake me but that you would show
[1:34:55] me the way
[1:34:56] you would direct my steps oh God that's
[1:35:00] my desire
[1:35:01] Hallelujah
[1:35:03] what an hour
[1:35:04] Elijah come and he tore down all the oh
[1:35:07] he tore down the altars he tore down the
[1:35:09] idols he tore down the Groves and then
[1:35:12] he begin notice the story he began to
[1:35:14] rebuild

[1:35:18] took the he began to make an altar God's
[1:35:21] provided way
[1:35:23] and when we come God's provided way we
[1:35:26] can expect God's can expect God's
[1:35:28] results
[1:35:30] you know many times we come our own way
[1:35:32] we we
[1:35:34] forgive me for saying this but I know

[1:36:49] raise in the message home
[1:36:51] you know our children know how to walk
[1:36:52] right because we taught them right
[1:36:55] they know the right talk because we
[1:36:57] taught them right they know what the
[1:36:58] word says because they heard it they
[1:37:00] understand some of them can walk and
[1:37:03] talk
[1:37:04] and still without revelation
[1:37:06] they may even be justified in their walk
[1:37:08] maybe be Sanctified they've never come
[1:37:10] to that real filling of the Holy Spirit
[1:37:12] that's a dangerous place for us to be in
[1:37:15] that's a dangerous place for us to be
[1:37:17] and we're coming right to the end where
[1:37:18] only those with the Holy Ghost are going
[1:37:20] to be there
[1:37:22] and sometimes we just like to tell
[1:37:23] everybody oh you're okay you're okay no
[1:37:25] no you're not okay until you get the
[1:37:27] Holy Ghost
[1:37:28] and I don't care if you're 10 years
[1:37:30] older if you're 60 years old or 80 years
[1:37:32] old without the Holy Ghost you're in
[1:37:34] trouble I'm in trouble
[1:37:36] listen Brothers we need more than
[1:37:38] anything we need the Holy Ghost we need
[1:37:40] to know that we know that we know that
[1:37:42] we know I don't want just a good way of
[1:37:44] life I don't want just a nice Fellowship
[1:37:46] I don't want just nice people to shake
[1:37:48] hands with it and have coffee with but I
[1:37:50] want to be with the people of God that
[1:37:52] are filled with the power of God that
[1:37:54] filled with the spirit of God whose very
[1:37:56] desire whose very life is is subjected
[1:37:59] to him and him alone
[1:38:01] and here they sat here's all the
[1:38:03] children of Israel we can't blame them
[1:38:05] let's just look at our own doorstep
[1:38:07] he called God called them all on the
[1:38:10] scene God called them all and said all
[1:38:11] right now listen
[1:38:13] you've turned your back on me and you've
[1:38:15] proclaimed that Baal is God and you
[1:38:17] you're happy with the just the way you
[1:38:19] are you're contented just were they bad
[1:38:21] people
[1:38:22] I don't believe for a minute they were
[1:38:24] bad people they were just as lovely a
[1:38:26] people as they were before
[1:38:29] you realize that you can walk over to a
[1:38:31] Pentecostal church you can go to a
[1:38:32] Baptist Church I know Catholic people
[1:38:34] that are some of the finest finest
[1:38:36] people you ever met in your life would
[1:38:38] put us to shame
[1:38:39] as message people
[1:38:42] they ain't no more saved than nothing if
[1:38:44] they've never received the blood of
[1:38:45] Jesus Christ
[1:38:47] so just to be a nice person isn't good
[1:38:49] enough
[1:38:51] God calls a showdown
[1:38:54] God brings our lives to that place where
[1:38:56] we've got to know that we know that we
[1:38:58] know that we know and there stood Elijah
[1:39:00] and after he said you go ahead and call
[1:39:02] on your Gods go ahead call your God on
[1:39:04] the scene and we'll just whichever God
[1:39:06] is going to answer by fire that's the
[1:39:08] God we're going to serve listen Elijah's
[1:39:10] God was a consuming fire not just a
[1:39:13] painted fire but a consuming fire it was
[1:39:16] enough fire in him that went Elijah's
[1:39:18] God came on the scene that even the
[1:39:21] Rocks not just the wood but it devoured
[1:39:23] the rocks it devoured the water it
[1:39:26] cleaned up everything
[1:39:28] listen what kind of God do we serve
[1:39:30] tonight
[1:39:31] what kind of God are we serving in our
[1:39:33] lives if he's that powerful of God when
[1:39:35] you serve him though if we come to him
[1:39:37] the way he asks us to come and if he's
[1:39:39] that powerful of God that he can consume
[1:39:42] listen he'll consume your Revelation
[1:39:44] tonight he'll consume my Revelation
[1:39:46] he'll consume My Sacrifice if we'll come
[1:39:49] with a pure heart before him our God is
[1:39:52] more than able tonight
[1:39:54] Hallelujah
[1:39:56] Hallelujah
[1:39:57] I like what bro what what Elijah said he
[1:40:00] said listen Elijah was calling for rain
[1:40:04] Elijah The Showdown was coming Elijah
[1:40:06] had said listen
[1:40:08] the god that answers by fire he's the
[1:40:11] God we're going to serve but we we we
[1:40:13] really we realize after the great
[1:40:16] Showdown that God they were still in
[1:40:18] drought
[1:40:19] they were still in a drought because the
[1:40:21] word had not come forth yet
[1:40:24] to change the scene
[1:40:26] God had proved himself and the people
[1:40:28] had repented and said that's the God
[1:40:30] we're going to serve and when they
[1:40:32] finally repented oh Church of God if we
[1:40:35] could just get this tonight how many
[1:40:36] times in our lives do we come to God and
[1:40:38] oh God you know my situation Lord you
[1:40:41] know where I'm at oh God I don't know
[1:40:43] what else to do most of the time it's
[1:40:45] because we there's a little something in
[1:40:47] our past that we haven't repented for
[1:40:49] we there's too many times amongst
[1:40:52] message people where we just Shuffle
[1:40:53] things under the carpet oh you know what
[1:40:56] I mean and we just push it under no no
[1:40:57] no no no God wants up repentance from
[1:41:00] your heart God wants to know you right
[1:41:02] from the depths of your heart that
[1:41:04] you've you know what does the word
[1:41:05] repent mean it means actually change
[1:41:07] your mind not just press reset not just
[1:41:10] do this not just just shovel it under
[1:41:12] the carp and say well we'll pretend that
[1:41:14] didn't happen we'll just no no it
[1:41:16] happened and God is requiring you to do
[1:41:19] something about it and when you're
[1:41:20] willing to humble yourself and do
[1:41:22] something about the consuming fire of
[1:41:24] God is still just as powerful tonight as
[1:41:28] he was then
[1:41:29] when the people repented Elijah
[1:41:31] immediately went up on the on the hill
[1:41:33] and he and he called for rain he says he
[1:41:36] said I hear the sound listen they are in
[1:41:39] a drought
[1:41:40] and the voice of God comes and says I
[1:41:42] hear the sound of abundance of rain not
[1:41:44] just a not just a little sprinkle of
[1:41:46] rain I was at a I was at home out at the
[1:41:49] farm the other day and the man who
[1:41:50] rinsed my field was he was out there
[1:41:52] looking at it and he said he said Dwayne
[1:41:54] he said where's the rains that they used
[1:41:56] to have the three the four of the one
[1:41:58] week soaking rains where are they at
[1:41:59] anymore
[1:42:00] I said yeah I said the world sure seems
[1:42:03] like it's in chaos doesn't it he doesn't
[1:42:04] want to hear the gospel he's heard it
[1:42:06] listen Elijah wasn't calling for an
[1:42:09] overnight shower
[1:42:10] God don't want to just give you a little
[1:42:12] moisture like sometimes we do on our
[1:42:13] plants we give them 20 minutes or or 30
[1:42:15] minutes listen God was wanting to
[1:42:18] literally God all the seeds that were in
[1:42:21] the ground when it was dry were still
[1:42:23] there just waiting on the moisture of
[1:42:25] God the spirit of God to take to have us
[1:42:28] Abode in their lives
[1:42:30] and when Elijah called for rain he said
[1:42:32] I hear the sound listen here's the voice
[1:42:34] of a man I hear the sound of an
[1:42:37] abundance of rain I'm reminded of a
[1:42:40] prophet of God who said There will come
[1:42:41] a time when when you're when your
[1:42:43] brother's crops are burning up and you
[1:42:45] speak the word and say brother is I'll
[1:42:47] send you rain in the name of the Lord
[1:42:49] Jesus Christ and what is it he said you
[1:42:52] will say I send you rain
[1:42:55] two omnipotence meaning how can you help
[1:42:57] it it's got to transpire
[1:43:00] never said Elijah and he said he said I
[1:43:03] hear the sound of abundance or rain
[1:43:04] Elijah didn't stay there he literally
[1:43:07] went up on top of the mountain and he
[1:43:09] took his servant with him and he said go
[1:43:12] check
[1:43:13] he had an expectation
[1:43:15] he knew he had done what God called him
[1:43:18] to do he knew that he was right before
[1:43:19] God therefore God would answer what he
[1:43:22] was asking for he wasn't asking amiss he
[1:43:24] was asking and there was a great need in
[1:43:26] the land god your people have made
[1:43:28] themselves right now God to answer by
[1:43:30] rain you've answered by fire now water
[1:43:33] the ground Lord
[1:43:35] here's gehaza
[1:43:37] first day
[1:43:39] first hour I don't know how many days it
[1:43:41] took maybe if I don't even know how far
[1:43:43] he was from the mountain from the ocean
[1:43:46] you know we just read it that they were
[1:43:47] standing there overlooking the ocean but
[1:43:49] but maybe they weren't I don't know the
[1:43:51] geography maybe maybe Hazel had to go 20
[1:43:53] miles to find rain to find enough rain
[1:43:56] to or or look over top of the ocean
[1:43:58] maybe you had to go through mountains
[1:44:00] and valleys and and I don't know
[1:44:03] but maybe he walked us 20 miles and came
[1:44:06] back and said there's nothing
[1:44:07] what did Elijah say
[1:44:09] go look again
[1:44:11] listen this is like us go look again the
[1:44:13] next day go look again
[1:44:15] go look again
[1:44:18] I give up God must not have answered my
[1:44:20] prayer shame on us
[1:44:23] Elijah's word was truth he said there
[1:44:26] would be an abundance of rain Elijah
[1:44:28] wasn't concerned he wasn't worried the
[1:44:30] Bible said he just sat down on the
[1:44:32] ground put his head between his knees
[1:44:33] what was he doing waiting for rain
[1:44:36] how many times do we ask God oh God you
[1:44:39] know my need Lord you know my need and
[1:44:41] one day goes by in two days goes by
[1:44:43] three days goes by and we're like oh God
[1:44:45] I guess you must not have heard me Lord
[1:44:47] you surely you know God heard you I
[1:44:49] wonder if we expect when we ask
[1:44:52] we have not because we ask not we don't
[1:44:54] ask us what
[1:44:56] we don't believe
[1:44:58] when he said ask abundantly
[1:45:01] what that your joy would be full
[1:45:03] ask abundantly that your joy would be
[1:45:06] full he knows your exact situation and
[1:45:09] he said ask
[1:45:10] well Lord you know where I'm at no he's
[1:45:12] waiting for you to ask
[1:45:15] how many times do we we listen we are
[1:45:18] the children of God brother Brown told
[1:45:19] you this he would bankrupt heaven
[1:45:23] for you
[1:45:27] he did
[1:45:28] because the value the very value of
[1:45:31] Heaven itself which was its creator
[1:45:33] actually left its career actually left
[1:45:35] its glory and stepped down into this
[1:45:37] Earth
[1:45:38] he actually bankrupted heaven for you
[1:45:41] all the power that was in God was
[1:45:43] standing right there on Earth
[1:45:45] the very God of creation came for one
[1:45:48] purpose for me
[1:45:50] you talk about bankrupting heaven do you
[1:45:52] think that that same God would leave us
[1:45:54] destitute
[1:45:56] not a chance
[1:45:58] not a chance he knows where we're at in
[1:46:00] our lives
[1:46:01] he knows our situation
[1:46:03] he knows what you have need of
[1:46:06] and he's waiting for you to ask
[1:46:08] he's waiting for me to ask my goodness
[1:46:12] what an hour
[1:46:13] there he was three times four times five
[1:46:16] times
[1:46:19] you see anything not nothing yet
[1:46:22] go look again
[1:46:24] I'll tell you what sometimes can I just
[1:46:26] backpedal just a little bit here
[1:46:27] sometimes this is where we get to in our
[1:46:29] Revelation with our walk with the Lord
[1:46:32] God's got the windows of Heaven are open
[1:46:34] the blessings of God are there the power
[1:46:36] of God's all there we get hunkered down
[1:46:38] on a little Revelation in our life and
[1:46:40] we think we got it
[1:46:41] we put our period right at the end of
[1:46:43] our revelation we think we've got it
[1:46:46] and God's telling you no there's more go
[1:46:48] look again
[1:46:49] put a comma go look again I don't see
[1:46:51] anything Lord go look again Ask
[1:46:54] abundantly that your joy would be full
[1:46:56] go look again
[1:46:57] and pretty soon gehaza came back listen
[1:47:00] church I don't know this but I know the
[1:47:02] seventh time there might have been one
[1:47:04] Church Age Two church ages three Church
[1:47:06] ages four Church ages on the seventh
[1:47:09] Church age an abundance of rain was
[1:47:12] promised I will send you the former and
[1:47:15] the latter rain all in one month it's
[1:47:18] all coming to you listen be expecting it
[1:47:21] church we come to church without
[1:47:22] expectation
[1:47:24] too many times we just walk in the door
[1:47:26] and sit down and and God understands but
[1:47:29] listen he understands but he doesn't
[1:47:31] he's expecting you to expect Lots the
[1:47:35] very expectation of God lays within you
[1:47:37] and he wants to express himself how does
[1:47:40] he Express himself to you if you don't
[1:47:41] come expecting
[1:47:43] this is how we are listen a preacher
[1:47:45] can't even preach if you don't expect
[1:47:47] amen that's just the way it works
[1:47:50] brother Paul how many times I can say
[1:47:52] this how many times have you stood here
[1:47:54] and you know when the people come under
[1:47:55] such a they're they're pulling they're
[1:47:57] hungry they want to worship you know in
[1:48:00] your spirit it's just so easy to worship
[1:48:03] the next time you get up there and you
[1:48:04] begin to sing and some are sitting there
[1:48:06] and some are tired I'm not I'm not
[1:48:08] rebuking anybody hey we're all living in
[1:48:09] a crazy world and it's exhausting but
[1:48:12] listen when you're there you're the one
[1:48:14] that's plowing you're basically paddling
[1:48:15] Upstream you're you're doing your best
[1:48:17] and finally all of a sudden something
[1:48:19] happens
[1:48:21] what is it the spirit of God go look
[1:48:23] again go look again I didn't feel it
[1:48:26] don't matter if you felt it or not be
[1:48:28] expecting it I I I I I need more well
[1:48:31] then expect more Lord I need more of you
[1:48:33] in my life expect more of God I need a
[1:48:36] greater Revelation listen I we get
[1:48:38] hunkered down in our little Revelations
[1:48:40] we hold them dear for 50 years we hold
[1:48:43] on and say no I've got it no you don't
[1:48:45] you had it because God moved on you
[1:48:49] might get stuck with your Revelation but
[1:48:50] God's unfolding himself all the time all
[1:48:53] the time listen I want him to unfold
[1:48:55] himself in my life
[1:48:57] I want to I want to be the expression
[1:48:59] that God wants me to be
[1:49:01] my oh my
[1:49:02] what a promise I'll tell you what how
[1:49:06] many times we get stuck on the things
[1:49:08] that we say on our thoughts we speak our
[1:49:11] thoughts
[1:49:14] I'll just drop this in here we speak our
[1:49:17] thoughts
[1:49:19] when our thoughts are not even our
[1:49:21] thoughts
[1:49:23] you know Satan has as much right to this
[1:49:25] thing as God does
[1:49:27] God has complete right to this Satan
[1:49:29] doesn't
[1:49:30] but we speak our thoughts too many times
[1:49:33] and our thoughts are negative
[1:49:35] they're actually Satan's thoughts
[1:49:37] Satan's thoughts and we speak them
[1:49:41] and what happens it creates an
[1:49:42] atmosphere
[1:49:44] it's it's the same law God uses the same
[1:49:47] law Satan he's allowed the same thing
[1:49:49] it's his word versus God's word
[1:49:53] but I tell you what if you ever speak
[1:49:54] from here
[1:49:56] it also creates an atmosphere
[1:49:58] Lord help us
[1:50:00] keep our mouths shut if it's going to be
[1:50:02] negative let's just bite it let's just
[1:50:03] zip it
[1:50:05] you'll just shut Satan right down right
[1:50:07] there
[1:50:09] brother Duane are you listening
[1:50:11] all right
[1:50:14] oh my I'm gonna I'm just gonna have to
[1:50:17] skip a lot of this tonight I think
[1:50:28] brother Brown said
[1:50:32] he can only do
[1:50:34] as you say
[1:50:36] because he's the high priest of what you
[1:50:38] confess
[1:50:40] he's there before the presence of the
[1:50:42] Majesty to make good anything
[1:50:44] that his Redemptive blessing calls for
[1:50:47] his sacrifice that's what he paid for
[1:50:50] and standing there to make good to you
[1:50:53] anything that you say
[1:50:55] that you accepted what he has done
[1:50:59] what he has done
[1:51:01] we've found him
[1:51:03] he can only do as you say what is that
[1:51:05] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:51:07] tonight
[1:51:09] Lord help us to confess the right things
[1:51:10] listen remember remember little remember
[1:51:12] Little John Ryan the little blind man
[1:51:14] that came in the in the in the in the
[1:51:15] prayer line
[1:51:17] remember brother Brown said he he said
[1:51:19] well you told me I was healed he said
[1:51:21] you told me you believed
[1:51:23] he said I do he said then go and confess
[1:51:25] it
[1:51:26] then go and confess it but you told me I
[1:51:29] was healed listen Brothers do we believe
[1:51:32] what God says or don't we
[1:51:34] God said that by my stripes you are
[1:51:37] healed
[1:51:39] we have a sister standing right here
[1:51:41] tonight that every one of you here is a
[1:51:43] testimony that's truth
[1:51:45] you are healed
[1:51:47] he's God
[1:51:49] if we believe it then let's speak it
[1:51:52] all right
[1:51:56] all right
[1:51:58] so many times we get caught
[1:52:02] my I'm trying to just find a spot where
[1:52:03] I can just
[1:52:04] bypass a bunch of this stuff
[1:52:14] brother Brown says this now isn't it
[1:52:15] strange
[1:52:17] that people they say well I'm weak my
[1:52:20] faith is not very much
[1:52:22] I'm not a very good Christian
[1:52:24] he said that's just what the devil wants
[1:52:26] you to say
[1:52:28] you're just talking his language right
[1:52:30] then
[1:52:31] you must never say that no don't never
[1:52:34] let your testimony
[1:52:36] be negative let it be positive all the
[1:52:38] time I am saved I have God in my heart I
[1:52:42] believe him with all my heart listen
[1:52:44] it's not just how Devil Comes
[1:52:47] I'll tell you what he is
[1:52:50] to say he's a good adversary he's a good
[1:52:53] adversary
[1:52:54] how many times does he trip us up and we
[1:52:57] fall on our face and then he holds your
[1:53:00] nose to that and says listen there's no
[1:53:02] way a Son of God does not act like that
[1:53:04] there is no way you're a daughter of God
[1:53:07] there's no way God don't even bother
[1:53:08] asking God because he doesn't hear you
[1:53:11] that is a lie
[1:53:13] that is a Lie the Bible says that he who
[1:53:16] confesses his sin God is just and true
[1:53:18] to forgive him
[1:53:20] you know what that's such a reality to
[1:53:22] him that confesses to him that says he
[1:53:25] has no sin he is a liar
[1:53:27] well we're not listen church we realize
[1:53:29] tonight very very plainly that we were
[1:53:32] born in sin shaped in iniquity and came
[1:53:34] to this world speaking lies that's why
[1:53:37] we go that's why we have a a heavenly
[1:53:39] father that became a lamb a redeemer for
[1:53:42] us
[1:53:43] now I'll tell you what we can go when
[1:53:44] Satan comes to us we can just say go
[1:53:45] talk to him
[1:53:47] hit the power of confession
[1:53:49] the power of confessing your sins is uh
[1:53:52] we don't we don't recognize let's not
[1:53:54] sweep things under the carpet but let's
[1:53:55] confess them so God will forgive us and
[1:53:59] then when Satan goes to God God says I
[1:54:01] don't even know what you're talking
[1:54:01] about
[1:54:02] then you can boldly go Before the Throne
[1:54:05] of God and say father
[1:54:06] Lord You Know listen we don't need to be
[1:54:08] ashamed to confess our sins Church
[1:54:11] Satan wants to make you feel guilty he
[1:54:13] wants to make you feel like you're
[1:54:14] you're you're you're littler then
[1:54:16] somehow you should be greater than all
[1:54:17] no I listen the Bible and I wouldn't say
[1:54:20] the Bible says this but I got a little
[1:54:21] plaque I think it's hanging in my house
[1:54:23] it says Christians are not perfect
[1:54:26] they are forgiven
[1:54:28] that's the difference between you and I
[1:54:30] tonight
[1:54:31] we're not perfect listen we're perfect
[1:54:33] in God's eyes I'm they hear me what I'm
[1:54:35] saying in God's eyes there's not so much
[1:54:37] as even a speck of sin in your life
[1:54:40] but in this life in this flesh we
[1:54:42] realize we are not perfect but we are
[1:54:45] forgiven and that's what makes the
[1:54:47] difference
[1:54:48] that's why you can come to God and say
[1:54:50] father you know what we have need of
[1:54:52] tonight
[1:54:52] listen Jesus Christ is my savior pardon
[1:54:55] me I'm just going to go on here he's the
[1:54:57] high priest of our confession Hebrews
[1:54:59] chapter 3 and he can only do for us as
[1:55:03] we accept it and believe it and confess
[1:55:06] it
[1:55:07] what are we
[1:55:09] this Supernatural race of people what
[1:55:11] kind of confession are we to have
[1:55:12] tonight
[1:55:13] I'm not sure I'm not just talking about
[1:55:15] our natural lives I'm not just talking
[1:55:16] about about my finances and about my
[1:55:19] health and about my my marriage and
[1:55:21] about all these I'm not just talking
[1:55:22] about these things but what kind of
[1:55:24] confession ought we to have our
[1:55:26] confession ought to be absolutely no
[1:55:29] different than this word
[1:55:31] which has told us that we are the
[1:55:33] Overcomers of this age
[1:55:35] which is absolutely told us that that
[1:55:37] it's not law that we're not just a a
[1:55:40] letter on a book but that we're living
[1:55:42] Epistles that are being written and read
[1:55:44] of all men
[1:55:46] we are the sons of God
[1:55:49] Hallelujah
[1:55:50] Hebrews 10 35 so many times we get to
[1:55:53] the spot in our lives you know that we
[1:55:55] we find ourselves a doubting when God
[1:55:58] God doesn't move right away as we find
[1:56:00] ourselves doubting and and Satan begins
[1:56:02] to bombard us and and Buffet us and and
[1:56:05] maybe we've been sick and we get there
[1:56:07] and and months go by and months go by
[1:56:09] and we we say larger but you said you'd
[1:56:11] hear me but you said you'd heal me but
[1:56:12] you said yes he said you would he would
[1:56:15] heal you now thank God for healing you
[1:56:18] thank them for healing you don't just
[1:56:19] accept it don't make excuses for it well
[1:56:22] I'm just no you're not you're a Son of
[1:56:24] God and Satan is literally already under
[1:56:27] your feet we already are over top of him
[1:56:30] he actually actually has no hold on you
[1:56:32] you realize that he he can't even go
[1:56:35] before the father anymore and actually
[1:56:37] accuse you or bring his accusations he
[1:56:41] can't it's no more the blood is atoning
[1:56:44] listen the blood wasn't atoning in job's
[1:56:46] day he was under the the blood of an
[1:56:48] animal but since Jesus Christ is coming
[1:56:50] Satan can't even go and accuse you
[1:56:53] anymore God says I don't even hear you
[1:56:55] it's not there's nothing to have done
[1:56:57] nothing
[1:56:58] they're perfect before me
[1:57:00] but we listen to him we give them the
[1:57:03] time of day and and when we hear them
[1:57:05] and oh oh what's that little thing and
[1:57:06] oh oh I don't oh I'm just not I don't
[1:57:08] know there's something wrong with me no
[1:57:10] why do we confess these things that's
[1:57:13] the devil's lie and that's you accepting
[1:57:15] his lie and guess what you're gonna
[1:57:17] you're gonna just deal with it that's
[1:57:18] all you're gonna suffer with it but
[1:57:20] until the time comes where we can begin
[1:57:22] to say no by his stripes I'm Healed
[1:57:24] thank you Lord for healing me I'll tell
[1:57:26] you what let me just let me just give a
[1:57:29] little bouquet
[1:57:31] brother Ken when he was here your pastor
[1:57:35] he stood right behind this pulp and how
[1:57:38] often through that last through the
[1:57:39] valley of his last nine months or 14
[1:57:42] months whatever it was of his life he
[1:57:45] never failed to quit confessing the fact
[1:57:47] I'll buy his stripes I'm Healed I'm
[1:57:49] absolutely you I'll tell you one thing
[1:57:51] God's desire was for God picked his
[1:57:54] little flowers bouquet and took him home
[1:57:57] he held his confession in the face of
[1:58:00] death
[1:58:01] he held on to a confession that was
[1:58:04] greater than death
[1:58:06] it was God's God could have absolutely
[1:58:08] raised him up but it was God's choice to
[1:58:10] take him home
[1:58:12] I'll tell you what I I you know what God
[1:58:14] just knows just when
[1:58:17] How great is our confession
[1:58:22] Hebrews 10 says cast not away therefore
[1:58:24] your confidence which has great
[1:58:26] recompense of reward
[1:58:29] for you have need of patience that after
[1:58:31] you've done the will of God what's the
[1:58:33] will of God tonight Church
[1:58:36] to confess his word
[1:58:38] that's the will of God
[1:58:41] his word is truth it's yea it's Amen and
[1:58:45] in the face of death Hell In The Grave
[1:58:47] it don't matter what Satan throws at it
[1:58:48] to confess it is the will of God
[1:58:52] cast not therefore your confidence would
[1:58:55] which hath great recompense of reward
[1:58:57] for you have need of patience that after
[1:59:00] you've done the will of God you might
[1:59:02] receive the promise
[1:59:04] for yet a little while and he that shall
[1:59:07] come will come and will not Tarry
[1:59:10] now the just shall live by faith but if
[1:59:12] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[1:59:14] pleasure in him but I like how this ends
[1:59:17] up but we are not of them who draw back
[1:59:22] to Perdition but of them that believe to
[1:59:26] the saving of the Soul
[1:59:29] what's God looking for
[1:59:32] what's God why isn't life easy for us
[1:59:34] Church
[1:59:35] we're the sons of God life should I mean
[1:59:38] listen to the prosperity preachers
[1:59:39] preaching God is so great he should be
[1:59:41] giving you everything you ever desired
[1:59:43] Everything You Ever Wanted life should
[1:59:45] be so good here at the bank your bank
[1:59:47] account should be bursting you should
[1:59:48] have your your yacht and your big jet
[1:59:51] airplane and you should be able to go on
[1:59:52] all that's how God wants to do no that's
[1:59:54] not just that's not what God's thoughts
[1:59:56] are
[1:59:57] God's going to give you all more than
[2:00:00] all that when we get to the other side
[2:00:03] but God's got a little bride on Earth
[2:00:04] right now that's being tested she's
[2:00:07] being tried she's being put to the test
[2:00:09] to see is to prove not to test to see
[2:00:12] but to prove that she's going to stay
[2:00:13] with my word she's going to stay right
[2:00:15] on my word she's not going to deviate
[2:00:17] left she's not going to deviate right
[2:00:19] her eyes are for me and for me alone
[2:00:21] what is it God is testing he's he's time
[2:00:24] testing his church this is the only
[2:00:27] element that they'll ever be in where
[2:00:29] they're time tested
[2:00:31] over there there'll never be time
[2:00:34] and he's proving to Satan that she is
[2:00:36] holding on that that she's going to
[2:00:38] stand in the face of it all she's going
[2:00:40] to stand the test of this age
[2:00:43] brother Brown says this
[2:00:45] God wants a time-tested church he said
[2:00:48] he's no he's got a Time tested church
[2:00:51] that's went through the trials through
[2:00:53] the losses through sickness through
[2:00:55] sorrow through death and still standing
[2:00:58] with a testimony
[2:01:00] that's the man yes that's the man he's
[2:01:04] looking for
[2:01:05] I don't care if you're a pauper I don't
[2:01:07] care if you're a beggar I don't care if
[2:01:09] you're a rag picker whatever you are
[2:01:12] God puts the test to you
[2:01:14] he's looking
[2:01:16] for time tested material
[2:01:20] I dare say that he he's got the material
[2:01:23] on Earth right now that he knows is
[2:01:25] going to be time tested it's going to
[2:01:26] stand the test
[2:01:28] Hallelujah
[2:01:30] Hallelujah
[2:01:32] how many times Church what's God looking
[2:01:34] for he's looking for somebody that'll
[2:01:36] just take him at his word

[2:01:44] and we know leprosy is a type of sin and
[2:01:46] and here's a man that that there was no
[2:01:48] cure for his situation but there was one
[2:01:51] young lady that had a testimony that
[2:01:53] worked for him
[2:01:54] how powerful is your testimony tonight

[2:02:08] the Kings and with potentation and the
[2:02:11] Great Men of War he would fellowship

[2:02:31] when she told them listen to him I know
[2:02:34] the God that I serve can deliver you
[2:02:37] from this thing

[2:08:56] free in the presence of God anymore some
[2:08:58] of us can't even express ourselves in
[2:09:00] God's presence anymore some of us are so
[2:09:02] bound up and and so why why Church
[2:09:05] there's a river there's a there's a
[2:09:06] river Jordan that that we can step down
[2:09:09] into that we can humble ourselves in the
[2:09:12] presence of all listen not in the
[2:09:14] presence of a man Elijah was not even
[2:09:16] standing on the bank he wasn't looking
[2:09:19] down he wasn't doing he just gave him
[2:09:21] his word listen if you'll just do what I
[2:09:23] asked you to do God will make you
[2:09:26] completely whole
[2:09:27] I need Joy tonight I need peace well I I
[2:09:31] got such anxiety in my life listen
[2:09:33] you're a Son of God you don't need to
[2:09:35] walk with anxiety in your life that's a
[2:09:38] devil and he's already been defeated
[2:09:41] why don't you just get down in the
[2:09:42] rivers you know what your problem is
[2:09:44] you've got a voice you're listening to
[2:09:46] and it's not the voice of God there's a
[2:09:49] whole bunch of voices the day that
[2:09:50] Elijah walked up and and poured the
[2:09:53] water on his sacrifice and said God Of
[2:09:55] Heaven come down and consume this
[2:09:57] sacrifice every other voice was shut up
[2:10:00] after the sacrifice was consumed
[2:10:03] you excuse me but there was 450 prophets
[2:10:06] of Baal and another 400 prophets of of
[2:10:09] Jezebel and every one of them the Bible
[2:10:11] says Elijah gathered them all together
[2:10:13] and he literally slayed them he hacked
[2:10:16] them to Pieces why because their voice
[2:10:18] was different than God's voice and the
[2:10:21] people were confused and listen when the
[2:10:23] people are confused they don't know
[2:10:25] which way to go it's time that we get
[2:10:27] back to hearing the voice of God
[2:10:30] listen church we don't need voices
[2:10:33] voices voices let's tune our ears to the
[2:10:35] voice of God and if God is calling you
[2:10:38] to get down like Nahum and repent in the
[2:10:40] River Jordan one more time then you be
[2:10:43] man enough woman enough to say God here
[2:10:45] I am you might go down one time Lord I
[2:10:49] didn't feel anything I don't feel no
[2:10:50] different then go down again go down
[2:10:52] again go down the third time go down the
[2:10:55] fourth time go down the fifth time I'll
[2:10:57] tell you what God will honor you
[2:11:00] when Naaman finally humbled himself to
[2:11:03] Listen by the time Naaman was there the
[2:11:05] sixth time there was no more name and
[2:11:07] left
[2:11:08] he was already his pride was already
[2:11:10] hurt he was already wet he was already
[2:11:13] dirty every thought was already gone now
[2:11:16] he was just taking God at his word and
[2:11:18] the seventh time when he came back up
[2:11:20] something Supernatural happened in his
[2:11:23] life because not even the speck of
[2:11:25] leprosy not even the speck of unbelief
[2:11:27] not the speck of anything was on Naaman
[2:11:30] anymore oh Church of God we don't have
[2:11:33] to walk around defeated we don't have to
[2:11:35] walk around with unbelief we don't have
[2:11:37] to walk around hindered we are the sons
[2:11:40] of God we are not going to be sons of
[2:11:42] God we are now the sons of God
[2:11:46] Hallelujah
[2:11:48] Satan is afraid of this little church
[2:11:50] right here I'll tell you what all there
[2:11:53] is ten there might be a thousand
[2:11:54] churches in Calgary and Satan don't care
[2:11:57] about one of them but Satan fears this
[2:11:59] little church right here
[2:12:01] I'll tell you and that's the very reason
[2:12:03] he's got you on a treadmill he's got you
[2:12:05] going in circles he's got you staring at
[2:12:08] your accounts receivable you can't you
[2:12:10] know what the I go I bank at the
[2:12:12] Canadian Western Bank back in in
[2:12:13] Saskatchewan they've got this they got
[2:12:15] these pictures on the wall and I get a
[2:12:17] chuckle of them every time I'm in there
[2:12:18] because here's a here's a woman pouring
[2:12:21] her coffee in the morning and it's all
[2:12:23] over the floor and she's looking at her
[2:12:24] accounts receivable
[2:12:26] come on come on
[2:12:28] here's another guy he's standing there
[2:12:30] with an ironing board and he's frying
[2:12:32] his shirt he's looking at accounts
[2:12:34] receivable we all live in this present
[2:12:36] world you're subjected to it just like
[2:12:39] they're subjected to it uh listen you
[2:12:41] guys used to have a little restaurant
[2:12:42] what was that restaurant that we used to
[2:12:44] go to uh
[2:12:46] what's it
[2:12:48] hey no no not that one the one that's
[2:12:50] closed down
[2:12:52] 32nd Street
[2:12:54] whatever it's called I I remember going
[2:12:56] there with you all and it's changed why
[2:13:00] probably covert changed it
[2:13:02] they couldn't make it accounts
[2:13:03] receivable counts receivable
[2:13:06] pretty soon they shut the door listen
[2:13:07] Satan would love I'm not going to talk
[2:13:09] spiritually naturally right now Satan
[2:13:11] would love to see you bankrupt
[2:13:13] he would like to see you like name and
[2:13:15] so bankrupt in spirit that there's
[2:13:18] absolutely there's nothing for you to
[2:13:19] grasp you can't reach up and get a hold
[2:13:21] of the promise of God we are called by
[2:13:24] God to pull down the very strongholds of
[2:13:26] the enemy
[2:13:27] we are called by God Satan is afraid
[2:13:30] Satan is afraid of you you got the you
[2:13:32] got the same power that that I want to
[2:13:34] say this you got the same gods in the
[2:13:37] threefold purpose of that uh of Christ
[2:13:40] The Mystery of God revealed what was the
[2:13:41] last thing that God wanted that he would
[2:13:44] have preeminence
[2:13:46] in a broad body
[2:13:48] preeminence do you know what that means
[2:13:50] that means that God himself
[2:13:53] if he says go left you go left because
[2:13:56] you don't know anything else
[2:13:58] if he says you go right you're going
[2:13:59] right you don't know anything else
[2:14:01] if he said Step Into the Fire you just
[2:14:04] stepped right into the fire
[2:14:06] he's got preeminence in your life
[2:14:09] listen daddy mommy Grandpa Grandma
[2:14:13] we are the devil's worst nightmare
[2:14:16] and if we're not it's our fault
[2:14:21] because when Jesus Christ stood on the
[2:14:23] earth the devils in hell were petrified
[2:14:26] of him
[2:14:28] and I'll say this he was the firstborn
[2:14:30] then here we go to the 20th century and
[2:14:32] here comes the prophet of God the wave
[2:14:34] Chief being waved across here comes
[2:14:37] another Son of God being waved across
[2:14:39] and the Very devils in hell were afraid
[2:14:42] of him
[2:14:44] how much more are those same devils and
[2:14:46] hell just as much afraid of you and me
[2:14:48] this evening
[2:14:49] absolutely you are Satan's worst
[2:14:52] nightmare
[2:14:53] because what he speaks you override when
[2:14:57] he brings in fear you speed away
[2:15:00] listen we're not we're not subject to
[2:15:02] fear we're not we're not to be bound by
[2:15:04] fear
[2:15:05] we're sons of God we're living in a
[2:15:08] different atmosphere different realm
[2:15:09] where the peace of God passes all
[2:15:11] understanding
[2:15:13] the spirit of God has preeminence in our
[2:15:16] bodies
[2:15:16] brother Barry come on up
[2:15:18] I'll just forget the rest of the notes
[2:15:21] tonight I think we're just at a good
[2:15:22] place it's a good
[2:15:23] listen we are the sons of God
[2:15:26] we can sing that little song says
[2:15:28] greater is he that's in me
[2:15:30] than he that's in this world let's not
[2:15:33] be so proud let's let's not be so
[2:15:35] arrogant that we are that we're that
[2:15:37] we're ashamed
[2:15:39] we're ashamed to to Humble ourselves in
[2:15:41] the River Jordan on a daily basis you've
[2:15:44] got something that you need to clean up
[2:15:45] go clean it up don't don't just don't
[2:15:48] just come to church and and sit there
[2:15:50] spiritually dry and dead and wonder
[2:15:52] where is that love of God and where's
[2:15:53] where's the spirit of God in my life and
[2:15:55] where oh God I know you're there but
[2:15:57] where where's the god like he used to be
[2:16:01] isn't that where we find ours we find
[2:16:03] ourselves in those positions I want the
[2:16:05] god that used to be no no I want that
[2:16:07] God present tonight
[2:16:09] I don't want to go back there I just
[2:16:10] want the same God present tonight
[2:16:13] and I believe he is
[2:16:15] I believe he is because you brought him
[2:16:17] here
[2:16:20] literally brought him with you when you
[2:16:22] came
[2:16:23] this church does not this building does
[2:16:25] not house God
[2:16:27] but that building and that building and
[2:16:29] that building is the housing of God
[2:16:32] ye are the Tabernacle of the Living God
[2:16:37] I believe that tonight I believe that
[2:16:39] Satan is just as fearful
[2:16:42] of the children of God knowing their
[2:16:44] position knowing what they truly are is
[2:16:48] just as fearful tonight as he was when
[2:16:50] Jesus stood there that day and said to
[2:16:53] Legion Satan come out of him
[2:16:58] same God
[2:17:00] veiled in a different Veil
[2:17:03] same God
[2:17:05] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:17:09] and forever
[2:17:12] I'm so thankful to be part of the of the
[2:17:14] economy of God aren't you glad you're
[2:17:16] not what you used to be
[2:17:18] aren't you glad that Jesus Christ has
[2:17:20] made you whole listen we don't we don't
[2:17:23] have to we don't have to live with
[2:17:25] partial understanding even do you
[2:17:26] realize that tonight Church
[2:17:28] we don't have to live with partial
[2:17:29] understanding
[2:17:31] God has come in this age the Elijah
[2:17:33] minister of this age has come to do what
[2:17:35] to tear down all the altars of Baal
[2:17:39] to show them for what they are false
[2:17:41] prophets Antichrist spirit
[2:17:44] and to raise back up the standard of God
[2:17:47] bring the word of God back to its
[2:17:50] rightful position that the children of
[2:17:52] God will say that's the god that we'll
[2:17:54] serve
[2:17:56] amen
[2:17:58] greater is he that's in me than he
[2:18:01] that's in this world brother Barry come

[2:19:13] wind it blew into the upper room and

[2:20:01] local
[2:20:04] I don't know how many people picked it
[2:20:05] up but you probably think that brother
[2:20:07] Dwayne and I have had a lot of
[2:20:09] conversations about what we've been
[2:20:11] preaching about but we haven't had one
[2:20:13] conversation about what we've been
[2:20:15] preaching about I'm so thankful that
[2:20:17] it's the same Spirit preaching the same
[2:20:20] word that is
[2:20:23] it does something to me makes me so
[2:20:25] thankful to show that I'm surrendered
[2:20:27] unto the unto the Lord being feeling

[2:20:59] [Music]
[2:21:02] can we do it one more time
[2:21:04] we don't always get together like this

[2:21:10] lake
[2:21:11] where we maybe don't have a piano but if
[2:21:14] you don't mind

[2:22:19] well praise the Lord
[2:22:21] you know what the Bible says that that
[2:22:23] he inhabits Praises of his people
[2:22:26] and I I don't think that praise just
[2:22:29] comes from here in church
[2:22:31] I think God is the real praise of our is
[2:22:34] the praise of Our Lives when we walk out
[2:22:37] these doors in our lives are so bright
[2:22:39] the light shines so bright in this
[2:22:42] present Darkness
[2:22:43] I think that's the real praise that God
[2:22:45] gets
[2:22:46] this is the Praises of our lips and
[2:22:48] we'll give them we'll give them Glory
[2:22:49] just the same
