[0:15] In [singing]
[0:16] my moment
[0:19] of fear,
[0:22] through every pain,
[0:25] every [music]
[0:26] tear,
[0:29] there's a God
[0:32] who's been faithful
[0:35] to me.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Glory. [music and singing] Hallelujah.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; When my strength
[0:44] was all [music] gone,
[0:46] when my heart [singing]
[0:49] had no song, [music]
[0:52] still in [singing] love,
[0:56] he was faithful.
[0:59] to me.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; Every word
[1:08] he promised,
[1:10] &gt;&gt; it is true.
[1:15] Oh, what I [music] thought [singing]
[1:19] was impossible,
[1:22] I've seen [music]
[1:23] my [singing]
[1:24] God do.
[1:29] Cuz [music] he's
[1:31] been
[1:33] faithful, [singing]
[1:36] faithful
[1:38] to me. [music]
[1:43] looking [singing and music]
[1:44] back his love and mercy.
[1:51] I see
[1:54] though in [singing and music] my heart
[1:58] I had questioned,
[2:01] even [music] failed
[2:03] to believe.
[2:06] Yet he's [music] been faithful.
[2:10] faithful
[2:12] to me.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:17] When my heart [singing]
[2:20] looked away,
[2:23] the many times
[2:25] I [singing and music] could not pray.
[2:29] Even then,
[2:31] my God [music and singing] was faithful.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; To move.
[2:36] Yes, Father [music] God.
[2:39] All the days I spent so selfishly,
[2:45] reaching [singing and music]
[2:46] out for what pleased me.
[2:50] [music] Even then, [singing]
[2:54] he was faithful
[2:56] to me. [music and singing]
[3:02] Every [music] time [singing]
[3:05] I come back
[3:08] to him.
[3:11] Oh, I see him [music and singing]
[3:14] waiting
[3:15] with his open arms. And he proves once
[3:21] again [singing and music]
[3:24] that he's
[3:26] been faithful. [singing]
[3:30] faithful
[3:32] to me. [music]
[3:37] Oh, looking [singing]
[3:38] back through this year, [music] his love
[3:41] and mercy
[3:43] I have seen.
[3:47] Although in my [singing] heart
[3:51] I [music] have questioned,
[3:54] even failed [singing]
[3:56] to believe. [music]
[3:59] Yet he's been faithful. [singing]
[4:03] Faithful low in my [singing] heart.
[4:07] I have question. [music]
[4:10] Even [singing] fail
[4:12] to believe.
[4:15] Yet he's been faithful.
[4:19] Faithful in [music] my heart.
