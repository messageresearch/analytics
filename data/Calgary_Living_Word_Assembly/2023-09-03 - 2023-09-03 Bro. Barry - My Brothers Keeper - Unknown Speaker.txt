yes me please [Music] bless you all [Music] Lord Lord lead us on my heart and once again comes out as a poem yesterday morning I was just having a real good time in the Lord just the thought of honoring the Living Word [Music] the word in our brothers and sisters the word Made Alive in this day and it went to Matthew 22 and where he gave the great Commandments and just the lurk started looking at that word neighbor and it has a compound meeting there is our neighbor geographically but I've asked you to look around here today and consider your neighbor those sealed into Heavenly places those that make a stand for this word there's no one else in this earth that deserves more reverence and more honor than the Bride of Jesus Christ so this is titled the great commandment in the bosom of our being growing Within the love that was promised to return again to love the Lord our god with heart soul and mind the first and great commandment truly defined with all our soul declaring Let It Be a love that believes what our hearts can see to acknowledge his presence in every situation and send surrender our souls to his Heavenly communication with all our mind with wisdom profound meditating on his truth in thoughts that astound seek understanding to know him deep and letting his revelations in our hearts steep and loving Our God with all our might our souls manifest glowing with his light his presence consumes filling every part bringing fulfillment purpose of Revival to start but the Commandment does not end there another connection a truth we must share to love our fellow being like ourselves Pride Must Die on these two Commandments the entirety relies to extend love as we have received care and uplift our siblings in need to show kindness compassion and Grace for our fellow people no matter the place when we love our Kindred as ourselves a Unity forms binding hearts and souls the Prophecies of prophets find their rightful place by these two Commandments loves true embrace let your love for God be fierce and pure but heart and Minds in all we endure let your love for others be the same a reflection of his love the ultimate aim and these two Commandments we find happily a Divine love that unites God's spiritual family so let us hold this mystical body close each and every day and walk in love's path in every possible way Lord bless you all [Applause] thank you amen enjoy your gift Brother Don stand with me if you would wonderful exhortation I believe to the people this morning recognizing God and each one of us is remarkable hearing a prophet on me I think it was the breach between the seals this morning talking much along that same lining talked about after the blood before the blood after Calvary and he said how much more now after Calvary how that connection between all of our souls exists and how we ought to love each other God is manifested flesh once again each one of you God bless you it's wonderful but feeling that gift is certainly encouraging to us faithful one his brother there he comes one of my favorite songs I just [Music] get any better than that he's the faithful one and so unchanging so thankful for this crazy world we live in of all the change there's one absolute one rock that doesn't change we thank the Lord for his faithfulness [Music] full one so unchanging [Music] you're my rock IES [Music] fall out too a king and again [Music] oh here's our confession [Applause] [Music] a traveler [Music] [Applause] [Music] so please [Music] don't think about how he must feel this morning that our hope is in him alone he was of trouble [Music] foreign [Music] with an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer to have a few requests this morning continue to remember Sister Helen family passing of her dad you know that on this side of Eternity there's nothing that can fill the void when we lose a loved one but we know that he said that he would send a comforter we want to ask the Lord to just watch over the family navigate these next steps I want to remember the orderly sisters who are traveling in Ottawa for the John is traveling in Ontario Toby is in metola with brother wolf you have a need making no on open up the times gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just thankful for your goodness to each and every one of us Lord father many times we don't understand the way you do things but we know that that's exactly according to your word you said that my ways are not your ways neither are my thoughts your thoughts and father we just trust you we believe you father that everything that you choose is the right thing father we pray for the family Lord sister Helen's mom and sisters father the many other family members who were affected by this Lord grandchildren Lord aunts and the uncles

they seek you for Comfort we pray that you would just Lord grant it unto them help them to make the decisions as they move forward Lord Jesus father we just want to remember the other requests made known Lord I'm ready to be with your lead sisters while they travel their brother John while he is traveling for the Toby father while he's traveling father if it's your will for him to be in service this morning and pray that you would just continue to pour yourself out to our brother and Lord we just ask that you would bring each one home back home to their families at the appointed time safely father we just want to remember every other need made known unto you this morning by an uplift hand father I know myself I have needs father you know them and we just present them to you father because there's no other source for our problems to be solved Lord we don't want a man's solution father we want your solution just pray that you would rent Your solution to each and every one according to their freedom father and Lord if our faith be lacking this morning we pray that you would just grant unto us a special measure of your faith Lord Lord we love you and we just ask that we can commit the rest of this service into your hands now as we go forwards father that you would just speak to us along the way would just help us Lord Jesus to change our hearts that we would not leave this service today Father the same as we can we love you father we thank you we ask all these things Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you musicians bless you this morning certainly good to be back if you have your Bibles standing I just like to read from Genesis chapter 4 this morning maybe a little bit of a different thought a different topic trust the Lord will bless it Genesis chapter 4 very familiar scripture start with verse one an atom knew Eve his wife she conceived in Bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the first Links of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very rough and his countenance fell the Lord said unto Cain why art thou Wrath why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well Thou shalt not be accepted shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not will sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him verse 8 and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field the cane rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and now Thou Art cursed from the Earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the Earth and Cade said unto the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and the Lord saith unto him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain Vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you for the the ability Lord Jesus to understand through a Vindicated Prophet Lord what you say in your word we know that you have written this word Lord that it's no accident that it says it exactly the way it does it's so that certain things can be eliminated if we are willing to allow your spirit father to eliminate it to us father we pray that one more time you would just eliminate the scripture to us father that you would just change us father one more time from glory to glory we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I bless you this morning you may be seated this morning I really wanted to just set the background for the story about Cain and Abel we're very familiar with it I'm sure um before we get into it we just have a few announcements I wanted to make sure that we brought them one of the uh one of the happy ones is that brother Juma has traveled and taken himself a bride and he is now married amen so God bless you brother Juma [Applause] I will share some pictures on WhatsApp I was going to try and bring them up here but I got sidetracked this morning so um we'll put them on WhatsApp I'm sure he won't mind and as well brother tabiso and sister Marion have traveled to Kenya to go and visit the families so they can deal with the Dowry because they are now officially engaged [Applause] they have been they have been courting for a long time and the Lord has just been wonderful he's really opened up doors for them and helped each one of them as they've gone along the way and it's just been wonderful to see them operate under the the influence of the Holy Spirit so if you can just remember them all in prayer for the Juma I know would like to have his wife immigrate so that's going to be a bit of a process but we know the Lord can do wonderful Mighty things um just a few more announcements we have a Youth Event coming up and decided to change it from the Friday to a Sunday and that's in hopes that the parents would be able to help facilitate the children actually being able to get to the youth events on a Sunday that way it's not during the work week it's after service and uh you know we're just going to try it and see what happens so uh brother Joel and Sister Crystal have moved it to Sunday uh September the 10th and it will start from two o'clock it end at five and lunch will be served at their house and uh so if you want to pick up your children come by five o'clock that would be wonderful it will be over then for those who are older that have the ability to travel on their own they've said you can stay that's fine but it is a work night and a school night so they request that you would leave by 11. sometimes the fellowship is actually so good personally I would say it would be best in my opinion to leave much sooner than that but I'm not going to get involved that's just my opinion it's not worth a lot but um if you have any questions by all means just reach out and uh either myself or brother Joel could answer the questions um just pray for them we know that when you do events on a Sunday it's a very difficult thing it's not easy so they're really trying to put their best foot forward here to facilitate as many young people being able to be involved as possible so if you can come it certainly will be a blessing I'm sure for everyone uh September is here we will be getting back to the regular uh service program if you will I know that could be a bad word around the message and maybe I shouldn't say that but I'm sure you understand what I mean uh we're going to have a community service on Sunday September the 17th at 6 PM we're going to have a prayer meeting Thursday September the 14th at 7 30 pm and we have brother James Nevada Bandy here on Wednesday September the 28th so I think we're going to have uh just a wonderful month it's always nice to get into September we can see the leaves changing the the seasons are changing and children are going back to school for some it's good for some it's bad but we know that it has to be that way it's just the world that we live in and certainly thankful for the goodness of God in our lives I definitely want to pray with the children um you know what maybe we could do that now would you mind maybe we could just invite all the children up to the front of the church here those who are going to be going to school old and young if you're going to school by all means come up the school system today is not designed for Sons and Daughters of God and I believe as a body of Believers we have the opportunity to actually pray God's blessing over the children so if you don't mind children just come on up let's ask the blessing it might sound like a silly thing some might say it's some kind of a tradition but I believe is a body of believers to our point this morning you know we are our Brother's Keeper and if we're not our Brother's Keeper then I think we need to take a look at our experience because we know whose spirit that Cain was of look at this amazing group here just give them a hand amen [Applause] what a tremendous come on up buddy it's okay it's really nice yeah you want to come over here you're okay buddy all right let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this this representation Lord of your spirit we know that each one of these children father according to what you said to us through the Vindicated prophet in our age this is our heritage Lord and father it behooves us as a body of Believers to stand in the gap for our children Lord Jesus father it's not oh Lord just a parent's problem to deal with their children it's our problem as a body of Believers and father this morning we pray that we could just unite together father and just apply the token to each one of these children Lord as a body of Believers father help us to recognize our position Lord and help us father to stand in the Gap as we've said for each one Lord help us to remember each one by Name Lord Jesus father that we could just learn our brothers and our sisters burdens Lord and that we could just pray one for another Lord Jesus this morning we just want to commit these children into your hands father as they go forwards into school another school year Lord dealing with all of the all of the the knowledge of of the tree of good and evil Lord Jesus we know that father you said to this generation that education is of the devil and father we know that even now it's even worse than it was 60 years ago father how far have we gone how how full does the cup of the amorites have to get but we know that you're in complete control and father this morning we just want to commit each child fresh into your hands as they have to go and bear all of the stuff that they have to deal with in school Lord all of that that scientific teaching Lord Jesus according to Cain's race father Lord we pray that you would just cover them with your blood that you would just allow them to go forwards with your token that the teachers and the students alike would say what is it about you that makes you so different because of your spirit that's with each one father we just commit them all into your hands as they go to school this year in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you all God bless you isn't he wonderful [Applause] thank you we certainly had a wonderful time away thank you each one for helping make it possible Brethren took the services certainly thankful to have the ministry in the body um I just enjoyed watching the services catching up certainly incredible to see the the Lord moving in our midst and uh really enjoyed brother Meadow coming here sister Shelley's birthday um yeah just a wonderful time to be with brother Meadow anytime you know brother Branham we were talking about brother Meadow and brother Branham said that you know the real big man tries to make you feel that way the bigger man always tries to make you feel that way and I have never met a time where I have come face to face with brother Mena where he has not exactly done that every single time you speak to him he just makes you feel good he just appreciates you and what what an honor it was to have brother meno here so anyways um I just love his approach and his encouragement is I would say just about Second To None he's been a real encouragement to me I uh certainly thankful for all the brothers brother Gilbert and brother Emmanuel alike just wonderful time in the word and uh just pray that God richly blesses you all for your efforts you know in our scripture this morning I want to talk about uh Genesis chapter 4 verse 9 and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and we know full well that Cain knew exactly where his brother was that he killed him in the field and maybe he would say scientifically technically I don't know where he went to after he died did his Spirit go up or did it go down or did it fly to another planet I can only imagine that Cain would start down that road to say technically speaking I don't know but we know that he knew he slayed him he killed his brother and and we know that that was the answer that God was looking for but of course because he wasn't of Adam he was of Satan what did he do he lied he started with a lie and we know that that's Satan's way is to lie but then what does he do he questions God he says am I My Brother's Keeper and you know this has really been on my heart when we were fishing we were up north we were having a conversation and it just became part of our fellowship and it just resounded with me and I just love it when the Lord speaks to me individually I'm sure we all understand what that's like but just resounded with me I am My Brother's Keeper and you know brothers and sisters I'm going to say it again if we don't have the spirit of being our Brother's Keeper if we say what Cain said with our words or think it with our thoughts my house is fine my children are fine my Affairs are fine my church is fine everything in my business my schooling everything is fine who are we talking for whose voice is that speaking to us and through us that's not God's voice it's interesting because that's Satan's voice and we know full well that this is this is the characteristics of of Satan and and people might say well this is just Cain and he just maybe made the wrong choice and as human beings we can make the wrong choice and before we get too far into this I I feel like this is going to be a really long topic and I'm not going to try and drag it out for us today I'm probably just going to hit some highlights but I think it's going to be really important to just lay a foundation for it to really drill into this and just make sure that we're we're catching all of the sort of the Revelation in this one verse and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper I have heard it said many times I'm not my brother's keeper and and I've thought it many times you know I've heard someone would ask something about someone and and I'd say I don't know is it my problem it's not my problem I've got everything in order it's I don't know where is he how is he it is our responsibility it is up to us because anything other than the spirit of looking after our brothers I don't know I think it's pretty close to this year you know we've heard it said many times when when we see the characteristics of children we can look at them and say you know that's just like their daddy can't we say that that's just the chip off the old block you look at the way that boy is he's just exactly like his daddy maybe he talks like his daddy maybe he sings like his daddy maybe he walks like his daddy he might chew like his daddy he might comb his hair like his daddy or dress like his daddy but there's characteristics that come out and we can't hide them we are the same as our dads I just think it's interesting because we have all these characteristics just in that one verse we can say that he was a liar and he was a murderer in one verse we can look at that and we know the verses it goes further into into Genesis we talked about it there but I'm just saying it for the sake of time in one verse we can see how he just wants to cover it up and that's not the spirit of Christ at all in any way so today I want to talk about My Brother's Keeper the exposition of the seven Church ages uh you can look up this phrase before Adam ever and I'll just wait so we can bring that up before Adam ever I know that it's very helpful to bring it up on the overhead so we're working to to integrate that together all be slower they'll be faster and excuse me we'll get there as for being able to upload all of the quotes initially I don't know if I'm going to get there I'm not going to promise anything but you know we're just here to to Fellowship around the word of God and there's no pressure we don't need to get nervous you don't need to have any stress before Adam ever are we able to find that in the exposition of the seven Church ages before Adam ever it's in the Ephesian Church age just yeah you got it there it is before Adam ever had carnal knowledge of Eve the serpent had that knowledge ahead of him and that one born of it was Cain was of born of begotten of that Wicked one First John 3 12. clear identification in the word of God about who Cain was the holy spirit in John could not in one place call Adam the wicked one for that is what he would be if he fathered Cain and in another place called Adam the Son of God which he was by creation in Luke 3 38. Cain turned out in character like his father a bringer of death a murderer this is really what I want to get into here I don't know if I've ever seen this before maybe so vivid but sometimes it's just the way the Lord does stuff Candor turned out in character like his father a bringer of death a murderer his utter Defiance of God when faced by the almighty in Genesis 4 5 9 13-14 showed him to be absolutely unhumanlike in characteristics seeming even to surpass any account we have in scripture concerning a confrontation of Satan by God isn't that interesting it makes me think of the statement that brother Bradham would say that fools will tread in hob-nailed shoes Where Angels won't even go fools would dare make accusations but the characteristics it's amazing going on it says but unto Cain and his offering he had not respected and Cain was very Roth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and Cain said unto the Lord My Punishment is greater than I can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me notice the exact way the record of God sets forth the account of the births of Cain Abel and Seth I think it's beautiful how he spells this out and you know for most of us we understand this we get it we preaching to the choir and I would just invite you to say Amen to it and just come along for the ride because I know there's people that don't know this and it's probably important for them to hear it because if we can understand what happened in the Garden of Eden it unlocks the message of the hour it gives us the ability to recognize who we truly are and you know we we heard the poem this morning we talk about being the Bride of Jesus Christ it's not an exclusive Club brothers and sisters for anybody who might be listening when we say that we're not saying that oh my word that that group I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and I'm not one of them although that's what a True Believer does know in their heart because it's only by the grace of God that we're saved through faith and not of Works lest any man should boast it's only the grace of God that we're saved it's only the grace of God that we can dare say that I am the Bride of Jesus Christ that's the only way but if we are the Bride of Jesus Christ then we're going to Bear different characteristics like we're talking about this morning and those characteristics are going to be right in line with the word of God they're not going to be mixed with some idea they're not going to be changed and adapted to fit our personality types or maybe the scars and wounds that we have in our life we're going to say Amen to every single word and not just say Amen by saying amen we're going to show it by living it living the am in our Amen in our lives he says notice the exact way the record of God sets forth the account of the births of Cain Abel and Seth Genesis 4 1-2 and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel just pause in there for a second just on purpose Genesis 4 25 and Adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name Seth I'm just going to read it the way brother Branham reads it I feel really inspired and want to say it but I'm just going to continue reading he says there are three sons born from two acts of carnal knowledge by Adam and if we didn't catch that it's important to go back into the Bible and read it maybe I'll just read it again and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again bear his brother Abel act Genesis 4 25 and Adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name Seth two carnal Acts three children how does that work we know that in the modern world there's a term for that and we'll get to that so brother Branham goes on to say there are three sons born from two acts of carnal knowledge by Adam since the Bible is the exact and perfect word of God this is no mistake but a record for our illumination so I think it just Bears record or or maybe it's worthwhile to just pause there and say do we believe the word of God to be the infallible word is it the absolute for us because if it's not then we really don't have a whole lot more to talk about but if it is then I believe it causes something inside of us to say well tell me more let me see what you're talking about I have a curiosity about what you're saying here are three sons born from two acts of cardinal knowledge by Adam since the Bible is the exact and perfect word of God this is no mistake but a record for our elimination since three sons were born from two acts by Adam you know positively that one of those three was not the son of Adam otherwise Adam would be the wicked one we read that earlier is that correct Adam would have to be called The Wicked one and we know that there's a an account of this further in the Bible we're not going to get into that this morning because I don't really want to try and do that what I do want to do is talk about his characteristics but along the way I want to try and spell this out a little bit God has recorded in this exact manner to show us something the word of God is no accident it's not just a happen chance there was there was the authors the sorry the scribes there's one author of The Bible and that's God himself with many different scribes over many different years we know that but God recorded this in this exact manner to show us something but we know that it's only going to happen by Revelation right that's the only way it's going to happen the truth of the matter is that Eve had in her womb two sons twins from separate impregnations I believe it's called super fundication yeah there's actually a scientific term for it you can look it up on Google for anyone that's interested it's actually a real thing she was carrying twins with Kane's conception sometime previous to that of Abel's see those twins again perfect type as always to those who think that this is not possible let it be known that medical records are complete with replete with cases where women have carried twins who are of separate OVA and separate insemination with the fertilization of the eggs being days apart and not only so but some of the records show that the twins were fathered by separate males that's exactly what happened in the Garden of Eden and this is where the denominational World said that William Mary and Bradham went off the rails right yeah he got into his own crazy Doctrine but how could the serpent be cursed to be the serpent how could you go from being a snake when the curses were being handed out to being a snake it just doesn't work you just can't even yeah we're not going to go too far with it today but I just wanted to lay this out to say you know what something significant happened in the Garden of Eden Cain was not of Adam there's a reason why he has the characteristics that he does some people in the denominational world will say Do you believe that that Eve had sex with with the Devil well maybe not directly no but indirectly yes exactly according to what we've just read I just want to say it again I think it's so important for us we have to be our Brother's Keeper we have to be our Sister's Keeper we have to be our children's keeper when something happens in the body it's not us saying oh look at that pinky finger oh it's terrible oh look at that injury no the body grabs that and and works on it and heals it brother Bradham says that healing comes through the body brother Branham says that salvation comes through the body and if we don't like our left hand we can't get mad at it and say I no longer want you because you're not a right hand we need our left hand just like we need our right hand if we're if we're right-handed we still need our left hand if we're left-handed we still need our right hand we need our our feet our toes we need the hinder parts we need the four parts we need every part of the body we are our Brother's Keeper and this is just something that's so impressed upon me and and I just I felt led to go here today so we'll just see what the Lord has in store I trust it's all right you know when we think about our lives and and where we stand in our lives harboring unforgiveness in our lives isn't going to do us any good if we're harboring unforgiveness in our lives then I would say that's not the spirit of Christ because in Luke 17 Jesus said then he said unto the disciples it is impossible but that offenses will come but woe unto him through through whom they come it were better for him than a millstone were hanging about his neck and cast into the sea then he should then that he should offend one of these little ones he said take heed to this yourselves If thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him bring it to him tell him you stepped on my toes man if I'd rather trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him the word of God says if he doesn't repent then take a witness I'm not going to get too far into that but I just want to talk about the natures about the characteristics of the two spirits Cain has characteristics and a spirit yeah but so does Seth and Abel because they're of their father Adam but we know Cain isn't it verse 3 take heed to yourselves If thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him and if he trespasses against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying I repent what does the word say oh man you did it one too many times I can't do it no we just went a little too far no that's not what the word says right the word of God here I'm just going to dwell on some scripture for a bit I hope it's okay if he trespassed against these seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying I Repent thou shall forgive him and the Apostle said unto him Lord increase our faith and I just think you know I want to say to us I say those words myself I believe that that is the bride's Revival Lord increase my faith because outside of his faith we're never going to get it we need more faith today than any other age brother Branham said because we're looking for rapturing faith in this age we're not looking to be church members and just be Association associate members I belong to a good church so I could get a letter for employment if that's what I want or maybe to enter a school or to immigrate to a different country I belong to Calvary Living Word assembly brothers and sisters that'll put you in Tribulation one of these days the bride's going to be gone and I trust that we'll all be there and nobody will come to church one of the things that can be a real problem is forgiveness the real problem Matthew 18 verse 21. then came Peter to him and said Lord how oft en shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times Jesus saith unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until Seventy Times Seven how many times is that brother Mervin do you know that 490 I remember brother Ken he talked about this he taught this and he said that so many times that you just couldn't even actually sin that many times in a day there's no possible way that you would be able to do that kind of offense to another human being on Earth and go to him and say forgive me for it in a day it's just not possible but that's what Jesus is pointing out it doesn't matter how many times somebody offends you or steps on your toes or trespasses against you forgiveness is free for the Bride of Jesus Christ she offers it willingly because she recognizes that she has free forgiveness and I think I'll probably get into it as one of the scriptures but we know the story the story about the man who had someone that owed him money and and and he went to him and said you know I need you to pay the debt and the guy said I don't get the money I can't pay you sorry man and what did the guy do he said oh throw him in jail this guy's terrible and what happened the king found out about it and he said you know no no no that's okay I'll pay his debt don't worry about it I'll look after his debt get him out of jail we'll bring him out I'm probably quoting it wrong but you understand the scripture I'm talking about bring him out of prison and I'll cover his debt and then what happened the guy that got saved he went to one of his friends he got a little puffed up he got a little bit of Revelation something happened maybe he heard something and he just got a little bit jazzed up and he went to one of his buddies and said now pay me my debt and you're not going to do it and he took him and threw him in jail and the King found out about that and he said you know what that's not gonna fly and that was for an example brothers and sisters if we've been given Grace freely how could we Harbor anything because the word of God says to go to your brother go to your sister and you know I want to say this I think it's such a beautiful thing because you know what you're doing when you're harboring something you're hindering both you and that other person but you can set that other person free and you can look at it selfishly and say you know what this isn't for them it's for me and in some cases that's exactly the way it's got to be sometimes people will hurt people in ways that there's no way that you could ever make it right you could never fix it on this side of Eternity sometimes people do that sometimes it's willingly sometimes it's by accident so I'm not going to pretend here we're living in a real world I don't want you to think that I'm trying to talk about something from a a pie in the sky perspective we live in a real world here things happen but you know what happens when things happen is what makes the difference things are going to happen offenses are going to come we read that already but what do we do when they do that shows Who We Are Jesus saith unto him I say not unto thee until seven times but until Seventy Times Seven until you can't forgive anymore because he can't actually tell you the offenses there's no way that you will ever be able to not forgive and you know in Romans 14. verse 7. none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself I could just pause there for a little bit do you ever think about that none of us live to ourselves and none of us die to ourselves something is causing us to live and when we die something causes us to die there's no accidental living and there's no accidental dying in this world some people might say oh now you're getting a little bit out there brother Barry because sometimes there are accidental births but I want to say this Arthur God knows every single thing that's happening he knows exactly when it's going to happen and how it's going to happen he's not surprised by nothing not surprised by nothing for none of us live to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived that he might be both Lord might be lowered both of the living and the dead but verse 10 is what I want to get to brothers and sisters recognizing that we live and we die because God chooses us to but then we get to verse 10 but why Dost thou judge thy brother well our Brother's Keeper why do thou judge our brother or why Dost thou set at not thy brother for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ for it is written as I live saith the Lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God so that every one of us shall give an account of himself to God let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way this is the word of God we are a Brother's Keeper we are interceding for our brothers we are interceding for our sisters we are interceding for our brothers and sisters children we are a body of Believers here we are our Brother's Keeper and I just want to say it again as soon as we start to not be our brother our Sister's Keeper there's another spirit is there and you know brothers and sisters it's always going to be there trying to needle at us trying to get in our way trying to stumble us but are we still throwing a stumbling block in our brother or sister's way or are we actually clearing a stumbling block out of the way and you know what maybe they won't even know it do we need to go and tell them oh I saved you from this oh I prevented you from that what good is that maybe it will help them but are we looking for a pat on the back is that what we're doing that's not the word of God I made a note here let's just turn over to Romans chapter 14 for a second Romans chapter 14. we just read verse 7. 7 to 13. this read 13 let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way let's jump down to verse 21. it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak and what might seem like a stretch and a little bit out there but I believe there's a real important point with that if somebody comes to us and and says you know what I saw you do this certain thing and I'm wondering about it is it necessary for us to do it it could be we know that Paul said all things are lawful even though they're all lawful they might not be expedient and you know if we can take whatever a brother or sister brings to us and then go back to the prophet and the message and see what he said about it if it is truly according to the word of God likely it's going to be in the message of the hour and and if it is an offense then why would we want to do it I believe we wouldn't want to do it as a believer and you know what I'll say this I'll just say it openly people might mock me forward or judge me for it but it's okay we all have our own Revelation to live by I had somebody come and say to me somebody saw a picture of you wearing shorts and they were offended by it and I I actually kind of scratched my head about it because the word of God says to go to your brother not go to another brother and have that brother go but that's okay I took it to heart immediately I got a little bit offended myself and thought why would this be why what's the big deal what's you know what go and look it up check it out in the message of the hour seek the face of God and see what he has to say about it does it line up with the word of God does it line up with the message of the hour that's up to you to decide I won't say it I just know what it meant to me as a Believer and to have someone actually say it obviously God wanted me to see something about it and you know what it did was it gave me the ability to say really I don't care whether I wear shorts or not really is that going to be something that I'm willing to fight over and have a an issue about and struggle and say you know what I I come out of the world I come from a different world than the message of the hour and I took so many things in my life and just laid them down and threw it away and said I don't care I want to follow the word of God I want to follow all that God has for me in my life whatever he says do I want to do that how many people have heard the voice of God Echo from the clouds down through the air to them specifically a message has anybody nobody I haven't either but I'll tell you what I've heard God speak to me do you a brother or a sister have you he uses man he doesn't have a voice on earth except for human beings and you know what if the human beings won't cry out he said the rocks will immediately cry out but if we won't cry out he could just use a donkey I wouldn't say that any human being is I'm not saying that don't get me wrong what I am saying is we know a scriptural account Balaam and balak in the Bible The Madness of a prophet God spoke he had a donkey speak but none of us have heard the voice of God where he he Thunders from the clouds and we get the message but if somebody says something to us what's our reaction and this is my point brothers and sisters tying it back to the scripture this morning what spirit is inside of us is it one to say am I My Brother's Keeper I don't care who came and told me that that's their problem they should come and tell me themselves if they're a real mature believer is that what I said no I said Lord are you speaking to me I want to get right with the Lord I'm not so worried about a brother or a sister although I am because I don't want to cast a stumbling block and you know what it might not affect a brother or a sister but what about their children we are our Brother's Keeper we are let us therefore let us not therefore judge one another anymore I'm judging with one another anymore let's judge ourselves let's judge ourselves according to the word of God and just see whether we line up with the word of God but I love how he says this but judge this rather if you want to judge something judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way how easy it could be for us to cast a stumbling block in front of a brother or a sister by our Behavior we've talked about it before I'll say it again I just feel that too I guess but we could just have a little wine for the stomach's sake and it's just fine isn't it it is some people cook with it I'm not going to judge anyone for it but if somebody comes to your house and opens your fridge and sees a bottle of wine what message does that send what's the signal that you're showing some people might even be bold enough to sit back after a a a week of work and just unwind with a glass of wine I'm not here to judge you but what are your kids seeing and then if your kids go and start doing something else maybe we'll scratch our head and say why are they doing that well we maybe gave them an occasion for a stumbling block in their way I think we just I don't know I I I I I I feel like I want to say I'm sorry but I I just felt so led to go this way we are our Brother's Keeper brothers and sisters and I believe as the Bride of Jesus Christ it behooves us to make sure that we're not casting stumbling blocks that we are encouraging that we're not judging if we're judging what spirit is that if someone's doing wrong then you go to your brother and say hey you're doing wrong according to the word of God and I I'm so thankful that I had a pastor that said if you do it as a mature Christian you're going to do it in love right you're not going to come and say you're a sinner I see this in you and you and and right you're not going to do that you're going to come and love and say brother sister there's this thing and I just don't know how to get around it and I just I just want to come according to the word of God and I pray that you you and I could just get together and have a coffee and maybe a word of prayer and just talk about this thing and you know what sometimes the things that we see with our eyes aren't actually what's happening and that's why the word of God says we need to go to our brother because we can be judging under the surface of not knowing what's going on we know the disciples in Matthew chapter 6 they said to Jesus teach us to pray how do we pray how should we pray Lord and we know this is very familiar very familiar scripture here Jesus said after this manner therefore praying Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as what as we forgive our debtors amen not saying that we don't need to pair that's brothers and sisters what I'm saying is Jesus is setting an example here to say look don't hold on to money so tightly or good so tightly that you can't actually just forgive a debt because there's times in our lives that's going to be the best thing for us because what that could be is simply the devil just at our door waiting to see our reaction to the situation if a brother or sister just doesn't pay their debt if they're not good for it then what happens what spirit is going to come out of us in that moment right we need to be able to forgive our debts to our our brothers and our sisters verse 13 says and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen verse 14 for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you who doesn't want forgiveness this morning every one of us do but verse 15 I think is the is is the Crux of it all but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses it's heavy I can tell you by experience sometimes people do things to us that can't be fixed on this side of Eternity they can say sorry however many times they want they can maybe repent with dust and Ashes all they want and they will never be able to actually fix the situation I can give you an example I know a young man we prayed for him he made a terrible mistake driving out of a golf course having a few drinks while he was playing and what happened accidentally while he was in the moment people will say it wasn't an accident because he chose to do that and that's where I'll stand with it we make decisions and if we make bad decisions to get behind the wheel while we're drinking he actually killed a man accidentally he didn't mean to kill a man but he chose to get in the vehicle with alcohol on him and we know that brother Branham said that should be capital murder it's not an easy thing how can you ever fix that situation how could you ever bring Comfort to that Widow how could you ever bring Comfort to the children it was one week before that he gave his daughter away in a wedding I could go on and on about it and I don't want to belabor the fact my point is things can happen that you cannot undo but the word of God says that you need to forgive their trespasses that's all doesn't say whether they're big ones whether they're small ones whether they're terrible ones whether they're minor ones whether they're fixable or unfixable or forgive their trespasses that's it and if you don't do that he won't forgive yours so whose characteristics are we displaying you know we're having a conversation and I think it's so good so amazing to look at many times we can look at the scripture that says you know you can talk about me Jesus talking to the disciples and the Pharisees and the Sadducees you could talk about me all you want you can slander me all you want but one of these days the Holy Ghost is coming and you say one word against him and that will never be forgiven you so I want to say this this morning this was our conversation we were having if our brother our sister has the Holy Ghost in their life and we say one word against our brother or sister what are we saying I would say we're venturing into very dangerous Waters very dangerous Waters many times I thought for the longest time well if we say something about maybe the the prophet for our day that could be blaspheming or maybe we say something about the word of God I just don't see it that way or or maybe uh something about the scripture or Jesus I or even the holy ghost in the day of Pentecost maybe sort of nebulous out there if someone's baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost and we say something against them brothers and sisters beware you could potentially be saying something against the Holy Ghost in that brother or that sister's life and that will never be forgiven is what the word of God says that to me is powerful that's amazing that that is sobering to think I say Lord forgive me because I know brothers and sisters I'm not going to pretend for a second I've said things about brothers and sisters that I know today have been filled with the Holy Ghost but I believe I've got a quote for it brother Branham says there's forgiveness for it if you're willing to get forgiven if you're willing to do it but you got to do the harder work man you got to go and see someone and say look I don't know I'm I'm kind of sorry about what I said or did or thought you know I I maybe went too far and you know when that person does have the Holy Ghost they're going to say you know don't even worry about it Matt don't think about it it's cool we're good are we good fist bump can we just go forwards and not have to worry about it it's not going to be well really you said that about me oh my let's have an inquisition I want to call another brother witness here to hear that you said that about me and make a big deal that's not the Bride of Jesus Christ right of Jesus Christ has endless Grace just like God has for his bride it's exactly the way it is it's not judgment Grace that's Mercy just like many of the scriptures many of the gospels while while Paul was in prison how he started them was Grace and peace unto you from God our Father which art in Heaven Grace and peace unto you not judgment and Scorn Mark 11 25 and when you stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses sometimes it can be very difficult for us to do but I promise you brothers and sisters just like getting saved if you truly want to be saved and you genuinely come to the Lord and you say Lord I'm ready I'm willing and I'm able and I believe you with all my heart I want you to save me I want I want to pray maybe the sinner's prayer and have you come into my heart and be my savior what's he gonna do he's gonna save you and once that happens it's the justification sanctification then the baptism of the Holy Ghost you go and you get cleansed out you get set aside you go and you get baptized in water is the outward expression of the inward work whether you get the Holy Ghost after whether you get the Holy Ghost before the desire in your heart is what he knows and he will give you the comforter if that's truly what you desire and when that happens you can't have another spirit and and if there is another Spirit the word of God says to take every thought into captivity and control those thoughts control that other spirit that wants to get a hold of us and cause us to act out and behave in certain ways the blood speaks brothers and sisters out of 1963 the token it's zero nine zero one m Paul tells us that the blood speaks and we know that we read that in the scripture this morning that the blood speaks when Cain slew Abel he was in the field his blood spilled on the ground his blood is what called out to God I'm I'm pretty sure the prophet of God said that his blood is what caught God called called God on the scene his blood was calling out and it's interesting if you think about it I I don't know if there's an account of anyone else that died before Abel but could you imagine being number one in heaven or in Paradise the very first one there do we have it up Paul tells us that the blood speaks that anyone knows that the blood is actually itself can't speak it's a chemistry is that right how many knows that but how many knows that the blood speaks that's a paradox isn't it it's incredible but it's true the blood doesn't speak because it's a chemical but yet the blood speaks how is that how many knows that he says but how many knows that the blood speaks if you want to put that down Genesis 4 10 God said what about your brother said his blood cries from the earth against you that right his blood is speaking Hallelujah God said what about him he said am I My Brother's Keeper said and his blood is crying out his blood is a crying out it's a token it's a token that he had been killed his blood was crying out against him now if you get that in Genesis 4 10 then in Hebrews 12 24 start reading in Hebrews 10 12 24 said the blood of Jesus speaketh better things than that of Abel see Abel he was a righteous man he died he died innocent because he was in the way he was in the way standing for the real Revelation he had he spoke it cried out the Justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed amen and speaketh better things it makes you sons and daughters this is where I said there's a quote brothers and sisters if we have said things if we have even acted things stumbling blocks what have you things left unresolved he speaks speaks on our behalf remember the story of brother Bradham in that in that Tavern that little place going in and he saw the policeman and the woman the ill-famed woman and the other guy and they're playing slot machines and he's got his hand around her and she's dressed immorally and he's just disgusted with the situation the Vindicated Prophet for our age and what did he do he got up and he left he went to the washroom and he cried out to God and said oh Lord I I just wish you would do something with this just wipe it off the map and he went into a vision and when he went into the vision he saw Jesus and he saw when he called the bumper of blood and he saw sins coming out of the earth and going up and hitting Jesus hurting him not just hitting him but hurting him and the sins kept coming and the sins kept coming and and he said oh my the end of the story is he he said oh that immoral woman that was and the man there that was that was their sins and God said to him no no no no no that's not their sins that's your sins as the Vindicated prophet can you imagine that oh my I say I don't even stand a chance then but I'll tell you what I'm certainly thankful for that bumper of blood because brothers and sisters that blood that was shed at Calvary speaks on our behalf that blood gives us the ability to forgive our brothers and our sisters because that blood gives us unconditional forgiveness but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed amen and speaketh better things it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides you from the wrath of God see the blood of Abel could not hide Cain see but the blood of Jesus can you imagine that he's saying the blood of Jesus could hide Cain he goes on to say so old Cain come out today if you've been a persecuted shooter against the word and say days of Miracles has passed this thing is all nonsense in things he says it's crying out you see the blood of Jesus Christ Cries Out but there is forgiveness in it if you'll just accept it wish we could stay there a while on that sea blood speaketh a better thing isn't it interesting in the scripture here I've been studying this for a while and Cain we read this earlier Cain he said you know what this this is more than I could bear because he was the tiller of the ground remember and now the ground that he tilled and we could only imagine how good his Harvest was how good the Harvest of his Fields were before the curse in his life but once he actually murdered his brother and lied about it God said cursed is the ground for your sake you you will no longer be able to do what you did and you will be run out of the guard and you will no longer have your first estate you'll be a vagabond in the earth and that's what he said to God oh no now my curse is way more than I could bear because everyone that finds me they're going to send they're going to kill me they're going to want to destroy me because I'm out from the presence of God it's amazing to think about but what happened was God set the mark of the beast on that man the very first one to have the mark of the beast and I believe myself just my view that was brother bradham's Trail of the serpent the beginning of it right there at the Garden of Eden here we have him now he's set with a mark what Mark was that that wasn't the token of the blood of Jesus Christ that was the mark of the beast his daddy the one that was actually there from the very beginning now I want to say today brothers and sisters we look at these scriptures and say you know Jesus was talking to his disciples and saying you know forgive people you don't want to hold on to stuff but where are we standing today as the Bride of Jesus Christ having the full message of the hour understanding that that angel descended with what an open book in his hand all of the seals open all of the Revelation all the loose ends tied up from from all the other ages Where Do We Stand are we further ahead now today than the disciples or are we still stumbling around groping around saying I've got this and I've got that and I just don't know how to do the other or do we say you know what we understand our position because when the church recognizes its position then the Rapture will go and I I say Lord help me I don't I'm not saying this to say that I've got a greater Revelation than anybody I would say that I'm the chiefest of Sinners I just find that God positioned me here and the only thing I could do is March forward and when he says March we got a March that's all huh but I think it's amazing because I can tell you firsthand I have learned a lot and as we go forwards it's just more and more and that's why we do this why we gathered a church so that we can stir up our Pure Minds by way of remember it so that we can shake off that spiritual Amnesia and and remember our first estate you know what we're not from this world we're from somewhere else so I just want to take it maybe from I know we were reading from the New Testament but I think it was sort of from maybe a little bit of an Old Testament perspective Jesus was bringing the new doctrine of the New Testament to just be able to forgive it's not an eye for an eye but what what I want to do is actually go forwards into sort of where the bride lives today according to scripture and you know what we've been given the ministry of reconciliation we're not given the ministry of judgment so if you turn with me to Second Corinthians chapter five let's just read this together I think it's so important it's so good it's so liberating it's so free gives us the ability to recognize really Where We Are Who We Are we're a lot more alike than we are different second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 18. and all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation not the ministry of division to it verse 19 that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ's dead be ye reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we may be the righteousness of God in him the gift of Grace unmerited favor we didn't deserve it many people would say well I've never done anything wrong in my life I've been a good person my whole entire life but the thing about it is we weren't supposed to be born the way that we were born and that's the critical Factor it took me a long time to actually have that unlock and that's why the initial thing that we were talking about here Cain Abel and Seth two acts and three sons it's a great mystery but once it becomes a revealed thing to us it gives us the ability to recognize really where we stand man and how incredible it is to have full reconciliation we're not bound by the chains of sin we don't have to be stuck in the situations that we're in If we Just Surrender ourselves unto the word we've talked about it in Ephesians chapter 5 for so long husbands you know love your wives wives submit yourselves unto your husbands children obey your parents in the Lord where it's the first commandment with promise we've studied that for a long long time but first before you get into any of that submit yourself one to another in the fear of God and if we can't do that then how can we ever go forwards as a body of Believers we've got to be willing to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God and you know that's one of the reasons why we do have a communion foot washing because we recognize we're not just getting together to just weirdly wash each other's feet because we're a part of a cult we do it because the word of God says it and the word of God says happy are ye if ye do these things so when you do those things you recognize there's a purpose for it and the purpose for it is to recognize that if God the king of kings and Lord of lords would humble himself to come down into this filthy stinking Flesh on Earth and submit himself not just to be murdered and hung on a cross but to Humble himself beforehand and wash the feet of other human beings he brought himself down to be a foot wash flunky how much more we be willing to follow the word of God and recognize that my brother my sister they have the spirit of Christ I'm not washing my brother my sister's feet I'm washing Christ's feet I'm willing to just apply the word and allow the full blessing to unlock let's turn over to Ephesians chapter 2. a few scriptures today and we'll get into some quotes a little bit later I trust it's all right recognizing what we've been given because we've been forgiven and we didn't even ask for it how many asked for the Forgiveness before they received it Ephesians chapter 2 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins so whether we understand it or not we were born in sin that's the way we came into the world and you know we we're born in sin was shaped in iniquity what does it mean to be shaped in iniquity by doing things that we shouldn't be doing and by not doing the things that we should that's the definition of iniquity born in sin not the way that God had intended originally for his family in the Garden of Eden when he said to Adam and Eve go forth and multiply That was supposed to be a spoken word birth but because of the fall things changed so every single human being on Earth is born in sin shaped in iniquity and coming into the world speaking lies every single human being lies outside of the goodness of God in our lives outside of having his spirit in us every single one of us has told a lie there's no way around it it's the word of God whether it's a little child lying about a piece of candy or whatever the simple question is that mommy or daddy asked them or an adult sometimes as adults we tell lies oh my I can tell you as an adult I have why because I want to save my hide we know that Abraham did he was a backslidden prophet wasn't he twice he did it with his wife it's a totally different story but that's the way we come into this world we're born in sin shape to iniquity come to the world speaking lies outside of the grace of God outside of recognizing what he's done for us his total absolute complete discharge from any of the charges or ordinances that were against us we would be doomed but here we have Ephesians chapter two I mean I would say I recommend it just read Ephesians chapter one to to Really expound upon what I'm talking about maybe when you go home sometime this week but Ephesians chapter 2 just for time's sake and you have to be quickened given life to that word Quicken means life you hathy Quicken who are dead in trespasses and sins wherein times past he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air that Cain spirit outside of Christ's spirit we have Cain spirit outside of the mark of the Holy Ghost the sealing of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and sisters we don't have to today because of the hybrid condition we're living in we don't have to run out and do something wrong to get the mark of the beast that's one of the false things that this world even around the message has taught that somewhere along the way you're going to be able to just go and get the mark of the beast outside of getting the holy ghost in your life you got it the token saves you from getting the mark of the beast to reject the Holy Ghost what brother Bradham said what God Said through brother Branham to reject the Holy Ghost is to accept the mark of the beast when the time comes that they put a mark on the back of the hand or on the forehead when that time comes he brother Branham does say that will come the bride will be long gone we don't want to be here for that don't look for that don't look for anything natural brothers and sisters it's a spiritual thing that we're talking about that's what's so important to us today to recognize our position to reject the Holy Ghost is to receive the mark of the beast and that is why I have harped on it and harped on it and will and will and will get the Holy Ghost if you don't got the Holy Ghost ask him for the Holy Ghost he'll give it to you and what's the Holy Ghost the message of the hour Christ himself wanting to live out through you remember in this age the laodicean church age this is the age that he's standing outside the door knocking to come in it's the only age where the church put him on the outside but if you open the door to him he'll come in and sup with you but remember that picture I think it was Hoffman that did the picture it shows Jesus on the outside of the door and brother Branham said the man he he said when you did that picture it looks really nice but you did something wrong you never put a handle on the outside he said no that's intentional the reason there's no handle out there is because the handle's on the inside the handles on the inside of the heart brothers and sisters if we want the Holy Ghost he's not going to force his way in we've got to open the door to him but he says that if you open that door unto me I'll come in unto you and sup with you he'll break the spread of Life open to us make it fresh every single time he'll make his mercy new to us every single day so whether we understand it or not we're born in sin-shaped and iniquity come to this world speaking lies I remember brother Ken teach him that and I didn't believe it for the first time I heard it I was like really but you don't have to teach a child to lie they don't have to be influenced by anybody they just have it inside on the inside of the inside it's just inside them to protect their hide where in times past you walked according to the course of the world of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience who are the children of Disobedience anyone that rejects the Holy Ghost among whom we also had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind and where by Nature the children of Wrath even as others outside of receiving the word for our day brothers and sisters we're the same as everyone else there ain't no way that we can just dress ourselves up and join an association and just be I've been in the message my whole entire life there's nothing wrong if you have not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's something very fundamentally wrong you have to have it otherwise we're just like the children of Wrath by Nature verse 4 I think is so critical but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ it says by Grace ye are saved but didn't just save us and leave us here did he and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I just think to speak so much to us that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and not of yourselves not of yourselves not any one of us just because we recognized it one day doesn't mean that we're anything we we recognize how insignificant we truly are outside of the word of God that's what happens brother Branham says that true Revelation brothers and sisters doesn't puff us up doesn't give us the ability to say that I've been in a message my whole life and I have no scars in my life and there's nothing wrong with me in my life no true Revelation gives us the ability to say you know what outside of the grace of God but for the grace of God there go lie when I see all these addicts in the world when I see all of these problems in the world all these people with all the troubles oh my every single one of us would be subject to that I'm not trying to scold us but I just want to try and bring it out you know what we are all children of Wrath by Nature but God who is rich in Mercy he knew us before the foundation of the world and chose to express Us in this age to give us the ability to receive the word for our day and that gives us the ability to offer Grace and forgiveness to this world around us my in Colossians 2 verse 13 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross that blood it speaks better things for us brothers and sisters because we are our Brother's Keeper we are our Sister's Keeper we are our children's keeper it's up to us brothers and sisters to apply that token or the Branham said his parents were the token for our children until the age of accountability and I think that's so sobering to think about how could I possibly do that the only way I could do that is more surrender the only way we can ever do it brothers and sisters is more surrender unto the word more surrender unto the Lord that's the only way we're getting just getting into the part that I really wanted to get to and only got a few minutes left I love it how it goes that's why I said we you know we'll uh we'll probably pick this up a little bit later and and maybe not from the angle necessarily that we started with because I feel like maybe it's a bit heavy and I don't want it to be that way I just want to set the foundation for it you know um John John 20 verse 23 maybe we should turn there we'll finish with this today John 20 verse 23. as the Bride of Jesus Christ the truly elective God there was four four known before the foundation of the world to be the ones who who we are today to be that bride of Jesus Christ my goodness I think this is applicable not even just to the bride now maybe I'd be going a little bit far with this but I would say to even nominal Christians now maybe we could have a discussion about it and I think it would be good I would love to because I think it's really important very important for us to recognize we can't change the word of God this is the absolute this is what makes the world go round is the word of God this is what framed the universe John chapter 20 verse 23 who's so ever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them remember brother Bradham says there's a compound meaning and a compound Revelation to every single scripture some people might say well this was Jesus just talking to his disciples and for some people that's as far as it will go but for other people that will be able to say hey Amen to that word that word's for me that means something to me more than just print on a page who's so ever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins ye retain they are retained I read this scripture many times in the past and I thought that it said whosoever sins ye retain unto them they are retained that's not what it says you can forgive sins we can forgive brothers and sisters who trespass against us especially if we pray about it God will give us that ability but whosoever sins ye retain they are retained so I want to say this morning who retains them who retains those sins I think it's an interesting topic of discussion because I want to say I think that we take those sins upon ourselves because we're not willing to forgive they become ours we've heard it said in the past if there's something covered up under the blood of Jesus Christ dealt with properly according to the word now you want to go in there and dig it up and bring it out whosoever sins are retained we're going to retain them I don't think we want to do that you know I had a quote in uh just had this on my mind maybe not as the way that I've presented it this morning I'll call the musicians or I'll just keep going and I don't want to keep us here too long we'll pick this up later but when I was in Saskatoon I just had this on my heart out of perseverance 1964 if you want to go there brother perseverance 1964-0619 said you know it reminds me of a guy that some neighbors they all got them some ducks and each one put them in a little puddle in the backyard and put a fence around it he said well you know it got to raining and raining you know how slow brother Grant can talk said the puddle kept rising in each yard until it got so high it got above the fences and so the Ducks just swam all around they wasn't fenced off no more brother Branham says so I think if we can just let the tide of God's blessing rise and rise you see until we'll all be in the same pond or the same Lake after all we are it's little Creeds and things that separate us but being the children of God we're all under one family of God you know I got to thinking about it maybe stand with me as we close I got to thinking about this I never looked at it this way on on a personal level one to one Heart to Heart brother to brother sister to sister but how when that water rises and we become one I'm going to get into this two brothers and sisters the word to the church the devil ain't going to let it stay that way and we know that he hasn't and he won't he hates it when we get together and we're United together under one headship and that's not the headship of the pastor that's the headship of the Lord but Satan hates that I got thinking about this quote here how it's not just congregation it's a congregation and I always thought of it that way that it was separate church with church we've got different fences in the way you know what what if it's not that I just want to pose it this way what if it's heart to heart brother to brother sister to sister but Revelation comes up in our lives and it causes us to float and recognize we're more alike than we are different we're fighting the same enemy I've got a quote and I don't want to keep you here but brother Bradham says as long as we're putting the guns at one another we're giving Satan day off but if we can turn our guns and fight Satan with our guns then he ain't going to stand a chance [Music] but I got thinking about this this this quote here how I'd always thought about it being separate churches but what about it being brother to brother sister to sister and and what if there was fences there dividing the Ducks and what if they were barbed wire fences I said this in Saskatoon under inspiration what if somebody decided to say you know what I thought there was separation maybe I need to go down there and dive down into that thing and look it up and try and find what's there you know what if it's a barbed wire fence what if you got down there underwater and you got snagged up in the thing and you could not get back up for air I think spiritually brothers and sisters what can it do to us if we go and get tangled up in something that's already dealt with leave it alone we don't have to have a fence be free forgive just like our father in Heaven forgives us because we are our Brother's Keeper if we're not our Brother's Keeper then we're of that Spirit of Cain I I'm sorry for saying it so cut and dried but I think it's the day in which we live in we've got to say it that way brothers and sisters there's no other way to say it we're either going to have the spirit of Christ or we're going to have the spirit of the devil and the devil is going to say I'll just allow you to put whatever label you want on me and it can sound like someone really nice we know brother Branham he said if you've got the spirit of Christ you're going to display the attributes of Christ if you've got the spirit of Dillinger you're going to be a gangster if you've got the spirit of Beethoven you're going to compose but if you've got the spirit of Christ you're going to forgive because you are your brother's keeper it's just bowing prayer as we close gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just love you and we thank you for your goodness to each and every one of us Lord to recognize the grace that you have given Lord that you would just come from Glory that you would set aside your your heavenly robes Lord and you would come down and put on this robe of Flesh Lord and tell all the angels in Heavenly hosts just step aside this is a job that only I can do and to come and humble yourself Lord unto death father so that we could stand here today and say Amen to the word you've given us father I pray that the words that were spoken today would just ReSound in in our souls that it would resonate father that we would think about the words that were said that we would think about what we think about our brothers and our sisters that we would think about what we say about our brothers and our sisters father that we would draw that much closer together through this Lord father that we wouldn't be pushed apart that the word of God wouldn't destroy us but that the word of God would build us up Lord Jesus father I pray that you would just help us to recognize that we have the ability to remit sins oh Father and we don't want to retain sins that should be remitted you remitted all of our sins father and help us to remit all the sins that we see we know that your word says that we can hide a multitude of sins father help us each one as we go forwards Lord father we pray that you will just watch over the children that you would watch over the families Lord be with those who are away who are traveling father wherever they are father we pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways father if it Be Your Will for us to gather again on Wednesday we'll be careful Lord to give you all the praise and all the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] came to me [Music] came to me and when I could not go he came we'll sing the uh yeah the chorus he [Music] came [Music] when I could not come to where
