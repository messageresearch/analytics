But here we are together tonight to worship the Lord, to give him praise, to give him honor. He's worthy of it. Let's start this evening with the name of the Lord is a strong and mighty tower.

Our thinking, our ambitions, our plans, Lord, we just lay them at your feet tonight. We have We've got one desire, Lord, and that's to worship you in spirit and in truth. Lord, we know our brothers labored, our pastors labored for the service tonight. [music] And Lord, we believe that he'll he'll speak the truth. We've seen that record, Lord, in his life. And Father, may we worship you in spirit and in truth. Lord, may the revelation of your word just be so strong and so anchored in our hearts, Father, that we could sing with with that revelation to you, Lord, that it wouldn't [music] be just lip service, but it would be from our hearts a worship to you tonight. You're so worthy, Lord, of more than we can bring you, Lord. You're worthy of our adoration, Lord. You're worthy of our praise. You're worthy of our thanksgiving, Lord. Where would we be without you tonight? And Lord, we've gathered tonight for one purpose. That's to receive from you. Lord, as we hear the word, we become the word. That seed keeps dropping in. That that that that word is planted in our hearts. It continues to bring more [music] fruit, Lord. It grows ourselves, our word cells. And Father, we want to leave it here tonight more like you, more in love with you. And Lord, more more in line with your word. Father, I think of it all the time. Oh God, that you would just break the just bake the greenness out of me, Lord. Bake it all out, oh God. May the lukewarmness and apathy that just has flooded this world just be purged from me, from us, from our midst tonight, Lord. It's something we fight. All of us fight. Your your prophet was told, "You must be more sincere." And Lord, here we are a non-vindicated individual. There was a vindicated prophet being told he had to be more sincere. Lord, help our our unbelief tonight. Forgive us, oh God, for for the apathy that that might just overwhelm us at times. Lord, we love you. We we we so appreciate you, Lord, and you're worthy of all of that praise from us tonight. But Lord, may you not hold those things against us.

We thank you for loving us so that we can love you in return. receive our worship now we pray in the precious name of the Lord Jesus we ask these mercies. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats tonight. Well, how do you explain? How do you explain? [music] How do you describe a love that flows from east to [singing] west, [music] runs as deep as it is wide. Oh, you [music] know all our hoes. Oh, you know [singing] all our [music] fears and words cannot express [music] the love we feel but we long [singing] for you to hear. [music] Oh, listen [singing] to our hearts. [music] My [singing] spirit singing [singing and music] from those [music] who have redeemed. We [music and singing] will use the words we know to tell you what and [music] awome God [singing] you are. But words of God [music] to tell you [singing] I love. So listen to my heart.

And you make yours, you make your mercy new every day. You've changed [music] my life in so many ways. [singing] For you cradle [music] me in your sweet grace. Lord, you fil me [music] yesterday, [music and singing] today, forever more. Oh, there's [music] one thing that I know for sure. [singing] Fresh as [music] the morning do. You make your mercy new [music] every morning. [music] Ever felt this way? Oh, and I [music] thought that I had crossed [singing] a line. walked away [music] from love one time [singing] too many. [music] Oh, [singing] and I thought I'd used up all [music] the grace [singing] set aside [music] for my mistakes. [singing] So many. Aren't you glad for this song? Oh, but on my knees I found [music and singing] to my surprise. Let your mer [music] with the sunrise. Thank you, Lord. Your mercy every [singing] day. Oh Lord, you [music] change my life in so [singing] many ways. For you [music and singing] mess tonight. Lord, you [music] build [singing] me yesterday, today, forever more. Oh, [singing] there's one thing that I know for sure. [singing] [music] Fresh as a morning, you make your mercy new [music] every morning. [music] And oh [singing] the wasted times that I have known [music] a prodal [singing] away from home will not know. Oh, and your mercy [music] to [singing] for [music and singing] your mercy every [music and singing] day. Oh Lord, you changed my life in [music and singing] so many ways. For you on me [singing and music] with grace. Oh Lord, you help me. [music] Thank you, Lord. Oh, yesterday, [singing] today, forever more. Oh, there's one thing that I know for sure. Precious the morning do you [music] make your mercy new every [singing] morning. [music] What a song of reminder how great our God is. Let's sing the chorus first. Stand with [clears throat] me if you would. We'll call our pastor up after we sing this [music] song. What a day that will be &gt;&gt; when he takes us by the hand and gives us a tour of that promised land. Just eternity is hard to fathom. But there'll never be an end of our ability to give him praise, to give us give him worship, fellowship with one another, fellowship with him. It's a wonderful, wonderful promise. We'll sing it this way. Oh, [singing] what a day that will be when my Jesus [singing] I shall see when I look [music] upon his face that one save [singing] me by his grace and he takes [music] me by the hand and he leads me through and promise this [music] land. Oh, what a day, [singing] glorious day that will be. I don't think this song was written by Fanny Crosby, but I did a certain research to today. And she wrote somewhere between five and 8,000 hymns. She was just an incredible, incredible hymn singer, h himwriter, and she died in 1915. I thought, wow. In the 1800s, all the way through that that man age, she came up. But one thing that we heard just recently, I think from our pastor maybe was uh maybe that was somebody else that was saying about uh her blindness. How will you know? They were ridiculing her and wanting her to sell her her talent to the world. And she said, "No, I'd never do that." Well, how will you know him? As you heard the story, she said, "I'll know him by the nail prints in his hands." And those nail [music] prints he showed Thomas, remember? He showed Thomas that. So those nail prints will be with him. that that that spear in his side, that scar will be there all through eternity. Fanny Crosby knew her scripture and what a wonderful lady she was. [music] 5,000 hymns in her lifetime. What a wonderful testimony. Prophet told that story many times. Here we are tonight singing a song perhaps not written by her, but it sounds like her, doesn't that? It's intimate. I'm going to take him by the hand. I'm going to take my savior by the hand. He'll take me by that nail scarred hand and lead me through that land. Think about it tonight. Well, there is coming [singing] a day when no heartaches shall come. No more clouds in the sky. There'll be no more tears to dim [music] your eyes. Oh, is peace forever more. [singing] All that golden sh [music] [music] will be [music] [singing] in my Jesus I shall see. When I [music] look upon his face and what he [singing] say by his [music] grace and he takes [singing] me by the hand and he leads me [music] through that promise. Oh, on the day a glorious [music] day and will be there'll be no [singing] sorrow there. There'll be no [music and singing] burdens to bear, no more sickness, no pain. There'll be no more [music] for [singing] the one [music] who died for me. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. [music] takes me by [music] the day and leads me through the promised land. [music] What a day, glorious day that will be. Amen. God bless you tonight. What a day that will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have such a promise. certainly thankful to be gathered once again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just have a couple of requests that we like to bring before the church. Um, brother Marty Cormas, I think is the name. He passed away in Arkansas's and we'd like to pray for the family. This is from uh, Brother Harvey. I hope I pronounced that last name correct. and uh brother Glenn &gt;&gt; Chart &gt;&gt; he actually he had operation in [music] his leg and he's asking for prayer as well if you have a need tonight maybe just make it known unto the Lord as we go to him gracious heavenly father Lord Jesus we just thank you for this opportunity one more time to &gt;&gt; sit at your feet Lord Jesus and hear from you &gt;&gt; Lord to hear from you telling us about who we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Father, we just thank you, Lord, for each and every one who's come out tonight. Lord, we know that we all have desires in our hearts, Lord. And Father, we know that you're more than able to meet the desires. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to lift each and every prayer that was made mentioned tonight by wave and uplift hand before your throne. And we just invite you, Lord Jesus, to sovereignly meet the needs in the hearts of your children. Father, we just want to ask, Lord, for the two requests from Brother Harvey, Lord, for the family, for brother Marty, Lord, the family mourning, the passing of this brother. We know that you saw fit to bring him home to your house, Lord. And &gt;&gt; we know that he's not mourning, but Father, when we leave this world, there's people that miss us, Lord. And &gt;&gt; there's holes that are left that can never be filled. And Father, we know that you said that you will comfort the brokenhearted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask, Lord Jesus, that you would do that tonight in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just pray for Brother Glenn Short. Lord, we pray that you would just touch his legs according to his faith. Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to stand with him united in faith tonight. &gt;&gt; Now, Lord Jesus, as we turn to your word, we just ask that we could push aside all of the cares of this world. And Father, that we could just one more time, Lord Jesus, just recharge our souls &gt;&gt; by the encouragement of your word. Father, we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. If you have your Bibles, thank you musicians. If you have your Bibles, I would like to read from Corinthians once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Corinthians chapter 12. Oh my. Corinthians 12:1 it says, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. And there are differences of administrations but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which workketh all in all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles. to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one and the self-same spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will, and we know that he is not the individual man, that he is God. For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body. Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. For the body is not one member but many. Let's just turn over to the book of Hebrews chapter 11. We know this is a very very familiar scripture &gt;&gt; but I believe it speaks to where we want to get into tonight. I want to speak to verse nine. of 1 Corinthians chapter 12 talking about faith. Hebrews 11 verse 1 says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Let's just bow in prayer one more time. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for your word, Lord, to know that Lord, there's nothing greater in this world. And we know that everything in this world will pass away except for your word. So help us, Lord Jesus, to just dress ourselves in your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Father, more than just dressing ourselves in your word. Help us to eat your word. Father, that we would become your word. Lord Jesus, we just want to commit the words that are spoken, the word that we've read into your hands now. and we pray that you would break it open to us fresh once again by revelation in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. Certainly thankful to be back once again and uh getting into our discussion about the spiritual gifts. I think there's so [snorts] many different uh directions that we could go with this and I just felt led to talk about spiritual gifts and just see what the Lord would do with it for us and uh we're just getting into it. So I'm excited about it. Just wanted to remember uh a few announcements. We want to continue to pray for brother Simply who has uh gone to Belgium to visit his wife and to bring home his baby. And uh that's going to be a wonderful thing. He said he would be back in January. And I don't think we have brother Toby and his family here tonight, do we? They're not here. No, they haven't come. They are back in Calgary safely by the grace of God from Nigeria. And uh he said they may not be back tonight in service because of jet lag. And that's understandable completely. Uh they're probably taking their rest and welld deserved. And uh remember to pray for brother John O Jerabessesa. He'll be traveling back tomorrow from Nigeria as well. We certainly miss one another when we're away, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly uh happy happy that we can get back together again. Just wanted to remind everyone also that we have uh a busy busy weekend. This one coming up. We have brother Cadre Diggs here Saturday evening. Um at 6:00 p.m. we have the funeral for Sister Jermaine. Uh basically all day on Saturday. 10:00 is the funeral at the funeral home. And uh then we'll have the 1:00 burial. Then there's a 2:00 um reception as well on Saturday. So it's going to be a busy weekend here. And then we'll have the regular service on Sunday. And uh we have the uh boy, there's just so much to talk about. That's all I'm going to do for announcements. Um certainly excited to uh to get into our study tonight. We're speaking on gifts and uh you know, talking about the same spirit. And uh when we talk about this this scripture as we were reading it, you know, in verse 11 it says, "But all these workketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will." We're talking not about some other spirit. We're not talking about some other personality. We're talking about the self-same spirit, which is what the word of God says. And that he that's mentioned there is the Lord Jesus Christ who is God. It is not a second or a third person &gt;&gt; in a holy trinity. &gt;&gt; It is one person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of a holy trinity. A holy trinity of three offices with the same person. There's no division of personalities. It doesn't work that way. And uh we know that that's one of the greatest tricks the devil has over the the the believing community, the church in general in the world is to believe that there's three distinct persons. And it's just amazing to think that we would we would be given ears to hear and and and a heart to receive it. Eyes to be able to read it and understand what a vindicated prophet would say that the English language doesn't even make sense to take one person and try and say that there's three different personalities in that person. You know, when that happens, um it's not one person, is it? &gt;&gt; It just doesn't even make sense in in the English language. But tonight, we're talking about the self-same spirit. Uh we have spoken a little bit about wisdom. We've spoken a little bit about knowledge and uh tonight I want to carry on with faith. I think it's it's really important one. It's it's vital in fact because without faith it's impossible to please God. &gt;&gt; So it's not even optional for us to have the level of faith that I think we need for the day in which we live because this is the age that's going to require the greatest faith out of every single age. Because brother Random said very clearly that this is the age where we need rapturing faith. This isn't the age where we can just believe in a man or the teachings of a man and hope that it's going to be okay. And you know, brothers and sisters, we could say that we believe in the teachings of William, Mary, and Brandom. But I'll say this, do you live them? &gt;&gt; Do we live them? &gt;&gt; Because if we can say that we believe in them, that's one thing. And that's wisdom and that's knowledge. We've got the knowledge of the teachings of William Mary and Brham and and maybe a little bit of wisdom to maybe live a little bit of a different life, a better life. But do we have the ability to let another life, his life live out through us? Not William, Mary, and Brandham's his being him in the scripture that we read about tonight out of verse 11 as he will the Lord Jesus Christ. It has to be him living this out in our lives. But faith is the substance of things hoped for. It's the evidence of things not seen. And I think it's so beautiful because as we look at one another tonight, the reason why we come here is because there's faith inside of us. &gt;&gt; We come here by faith, believing that there's something going to happen. That we're not going to leave this service the same way that we came. We believe by faith &gt;&gt; that we're going to see a body change one day. By faith, we understand that not not only the worlds were framed, but our lives were framed before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; By faith, we believe that we're saved through grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not of works. &gt;&gt; Because if it was of works, then we're probably lost because there's better people. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? I was listening to the message today. Brother Bradom said it and it's just one of those things that just jumped out of the player to me. You know, the common people heard him gladly. &gt;&gt; So if we find ourselves in a position where we think we're exquisite, &gt;&gt; are we hearing him? &gt;&gt; The Bible says that not William Marryiam Brandom. The Bible says the common people heard him gladly. &gt;&gt; Now some people might say, "Well, I'm refined individual and I can hear him gladly and God bless you if you can." But he didn't come to save the aristocrats, did he? He didn't come to to to do that. He came to save the common people. And and I just was thinking about it. I'm so thankful that I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Aren't you tonight? &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to think &gt;&gt; that we're just one of them? &gt;&gt; Just because he chose us, not because of what we've done. This is to profit every single man with all. &gt;&gt; So, tonight talking about faith. I just want to try and encourage us. You can't explain it even though we're going to try to a little bit. You you can't you can't break it down into a scientific formula. You can't just give someone faith and and say, "Here, this is the faith that I have. You should have this faith, too." Right? When we do that, we actually wind up with a religion. &gt;&gt; It has to be our own experience. It has to be our own faith. And you know, unfortunately, this is the way that the Lord has created it. Our faith is created through trials. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; The faith that we're talking about tonight isn't just faith to believe that we have a church that we can go to and we can pay our tithes to and we can get a tax receipt from and there's a benefit because we're a better people because we belong to a church. There are those benefits and and that's wonderful, isn't it? I mean, it is naturally speaking. That's wonderful. But is that all? &gt;&gt; No. Tonight we're talking about another level of faith. &gt;&gt; And we mentioned it last time about brother Brandham talking about in the very first recorded message. Faith is the substance. And and he talks right out of Hebrews chap 11, but he talks about that girl with a the the rupturing appendix and she has no chance to go and get operated on. There's nothing that can save her except for faith. And she says, "Oh yeah, I have faith." To the prophet. And he says, "Do you okay? Show me. Show me your faith. Move that chain hanging from the light." And she said, "No, no way. That's spiritualism. How could you ever do that? Nobody could ever do that." And he said, "Watch me." And he did it. Why did he do that? To show her that there was another level of faith. Mhm. &gt;&gt; And and I just think it's beautiful because we know that in the end she was able to receive her healing &gt;&gt; because she realized how terribly errored she was. &gt;&gt; And and that's the same for every single one of us. There comes a point in time where we have to realize, you know, maybe I've got it wrong. Just be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; And it's so beautiful because it's the word of an angel messenger. &gt;&gt; I cannot get away from that thought. It's an angel messenger. And this is what we're talking about here. This is the the message for our day. It's from an angel messenger. And many people might say, you know, that's crazy talk. And and that's where you go off the rails with what you believe. And I say, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm going to keep on going all the way off the rails. [laughter] We heard about it on Sunday. David, he got so excited when the word of God was coming to his house. Finally, what did he do? He took off his shirt and he started dancing. And we know that brother Brandham talks about it that way and and his wife was mortified that he would behave such such such in such a terrible way. Act so outrageous to be dancing in front of everyone without his shirt on. And we know that David said, "Hey, if you like that, watch this." And he didn't care because the word came to him. &gt;&gt; It was coming to his house. And I think it's got to be that way. When we get to that place, brothers and sisters, I believe that we will see a new level of faith manifesting in our lives when we don't care about what's going on. We're not too fussed about having everything just exactly so. We just want to see the spirit of God move so bad. We're just going to tune everything else out and just allow him to come on the scene. &gt;&gt; Watch out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might wonder, where's Brother Barry going tonight? I I'm heading somewhere. But you know, faith is a gift. Faith isn't just something that we just have. If we have faith, it's a tremendous gift from God. &gt;&gt; Even just a little bit of faith. And we know that Jesus when he was on earth, he said, "If you even just had faith the size of a grain of mustard seed, and we know that that's a very, very small seed. It looks like powder." When you look at mustard seed, they look like powder. But faith is a gift. And it's it's it's a gift from God. And and I just couldn't help while I was studying this, thinking about it, you know, there was a time where brother Brandham, he preached a message in 1962 called wisdom versus faith. &gt;&gt; Wisdom versus faith. Sometimes we can get wisdom and knowledge about this message of the hour or the word of God. And what can happen is we can start to confuse that with faith. They're not the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were talking about it this morning having a conversation. You know, fear and faith cannot coexist. &gt;&gt; They are emnity against one another. &gt;&gt; You cannot have fear and have faith at the same time. Now, that's not to say, brothers and sisters, that you can't have fear. We can have fear. And I'll tell you, I I I have that experience where we went out to Victoria that one time and I misqued a job and I knew that we had a $40,000 problem on our hands and I had to somehow figure that out. And you know what happened was I kept it to myself. I didn't talk about it. I didn't really deal with it the any way that I should. And what happened was is I took that with me. I took on a spirit of depression. I took on a spirit of great fear. I took on a spirit to the place where I felt so helplessly alone that I thought the world would be better off without me &gt;&gt; on vacation with my family. But what happened was fear began to grip me. And I allowed that fear to grip me more and more and more without realizing, wait a second, I should be having faith and say, you know what, if there's a problem like this, that means that there's a solution from God just waiting to happen. And you know, after we went through all of it, we finally prayed through and and got to the place where we came back. I I went and had a conversation with the homeowners and said, "Look, I made an error. I did this. I messed up." &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh, really? Okay. Well, how much is it?" And I told them, they said, "Oh, well, we probably had to do that somewhere along the way anyway, so that's okay." &gt;&gt; And I'm like, "Are you serious?" Here I was thinking the world would be better off without me. Whose thoughts were those? &gt;&gt; Those weren't even my thoughts. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But I was given over to fear instead of actually [clears throat] trying to go for faith. &gt;&gt; But you know, we can have wisdom. We can we can be wise &gt;&gt; in our own conceit &gt;&gt; and actually push faith away. I'm not going to get into that message tonight. Wisdom first is faith. But I might, but not tonight. Tonight I want to actually really get into Mark chapter 10 starting at verse 46. So if you want to just turn over to Mark chapter 10. This is uh this is something that I preached on a little while ago and I just thought my it just it just resounded. It just rang true. So tonight I'm going to preach out of this message talking about faith. Mark 10 verse 46. Jesus walking down the road here. And they came to Jericho. Do we have that right? Yeah. And they came to Jericho. And as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind Barameus, the son of Timus sat by the highway side begging. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me." And many charged him that he should hold his peace. But he cried the more a great deal, thou son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus stood still. Now, Brother Brandham, I'm going to read some of these quotes here in this message. But brother Brandham, he says, I love that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I just love that, don't you? Jesus stood still at his voice, &gt;&gt; at this man's voice. Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying unto him, "Be of good comfort. Rise, he calleth thee." So it makes me wonder which ones were they that came back and called him. After they told him, "Shut up. This is the master. You're just a blind beggar. Go away. You're you're actually just getting in the way. You're making a mess of the situation, interrupting the church service, GETTING EXCITED, GETTING OUT OF ORDER. DON'T DO THAT. Suddenly they had to call him cuz he said, "Get that guy." And he casting away his garment rose and came to Jesus. And you know, I I hadn't really heard this in before and didn't really think about it until this message, but brother Bradom talks about it. There was something inside of this guy who was blind. &gt;&gt; The word of God says this for a reason. Brother Brandham just sort of glazes over it, but it really caught my attention. This guy who was blind begging in the way in the street, he just jumped up and cast away his garment. How was he going to find his garment? &gt;&gt; How was he going to get that garment back? &gt;&gt; But something was on the inside of the inside, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he casting away his garment rose and came to Jesus. And Jesus answered and said unto him, "What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?" The blind man said unto him,"Lord, that I might receive my sight." &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto him, "Go thy way. Thy faith &gt;&gt; hath made thee whole." &gt;&gt; And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way. So tonight I want to take a look at this and I want to talk about this from this perspective. You know sometimes we got to cry out. &gt;&gt; And and I would say not sometimes I would say every time. &gt;&gt; And I think the more we cry out the more we're going to see how much he's listening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know crying out isn't necessarily crying out in lamenting and and and and in pain. Sometimes crying out is just in worship, &gt;&gt; saying, "Thank you, Lord. I know you've got this under control." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of the best ways to deal with problems is to actually praise them away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; Not cry about them and talk about them and lament about them, but to actually just start to WORSHIP THE LORD AND thank him for making provision for every single one of our needs. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this guy, blind Barnameus, he stopped Jesus in his tracks. Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; The Messiah walking down the road. You know, we talked about this before, how brother Brham, he just paints such a picture of this man. How he he was sitting there and the son just blind and begging and another day is going by. And he probably got helped out into his spot on the rock there from one of the rocks that was in the wall of Jericho when when Joshua was around. and and he probably heard all those stories from his mom and he was remember brother Brandham talks about this not in this message though the one I'm going to read from but he does he talks about it in another one that's called blind Barameus but he talks about how he has the memories of of feeling the sun and seeing the sun and seeing the grass on the hill and maybe seeing the springtime flowers and what it looks like in Judea at the time and here he is now he's blind and and just trying to get any little bit that he can as a beggar out of this life. But he remembers hearing his mama's voice and what it was like to come running back to his mama sitting on the porch and and just putting his head in her lap and and just having her tell him the stories about how there was there was Jericho and and the mighty warrior, the mighty conqueror Joshua and Caleb and how they they conquered this city and where he was. he was able to be sitting on the very rocks, the very stones that fell down from the leadership of this man and how much of a leader he must have been. And and and he talks about this guy in such a way that he he feels like if he could just have been there when Joshua was there talking to the captain of the Lord's house, he could have received his sight, but he wasn't there then. But it was such a wonderful time where God was moving. And then he goes on to talk about how he is sitting there thinking, you know, this is the very same road that Elijah walked with Elisha on. &gt;&gt; And if he could only be there when the great prophets were walking down this road, maybe, just maybe, he could have received his sight there. And then, just tremendous way tells these stories. and and he he just says, "If I COULD HAVE JUST CRIED OUT, I MIGHT have received my sight as he's sitting there." And you know, we could say that brother Brandham just makes it theatrical and and and and probably does to some extent, but I kind of like to think that this is prophetic insight &gt;&gt; where this man likely goes back into the mind of God and looks out through the eyes of God, looking down on the scenario and paints a picture like no one else could paint. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. if I could have just cried out then I might have received my sight. And and you know while he sat there thinking if only what happened that day he heard the commotion. He heard a commotion happening and he had probably heard that there was a healer in the land. He probably heard that some people were even saying that this was the Messiah. He'd probably heard the noise that was noised abroad about how all this commotion was taking place and and he probably even thought to himself there, me being a blind beggar, if only I could just get in front of that man, somehow &gt;&gt; I could receive my sight, not realizing that that man was actually coming by his way. &gt;&gt; And it was no accident. &gt;&gt; We were talking about this a couple weeks ago. You know, there is no coincidences in this world. That's right. &gt;&gt; We talk about it that way. We talk about it being an accident or a coincidence. You know, when Jesus comes by our way, it's there's no coincidence. Brother Random says that you don't just stumble into the mission on the corner and get saved one day. No, no. That's that's the time appointed of the father where he comes and actually introduces himself personally to you as an individual. You have that experience. But here he is sitting there thinking, "If only, if only, if only." And he hears the commotion. And we know that something welled up inside this guy, didn't it? Something had to have welled up inside of him. And his faith began to grow. And as his faith began to grow, he just simply began to cry out. And you know, brothers and sisters, when we talk about faith in in the real life application in the church, in our lives, when we have something inside of us starting to grow and starting to want to cry out, I want to encourage you with all of my HEART TO LET IT OUT. &gt;&gt; Don't hold it in. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Oh, I better not I better not get excited. I better not say anything about it. I I better not get too excited. Oh, if I do that, then something might happen. Someone might look at me. Who's looking at you? &gt;&gt; If we came here into this building and we're worried about someone looking at us, we've come here for the wrong reason. &gt;&gt; Because there's only one person that we want to have look at us, isn't it? &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And we know that where two or three gather in his name that he's there. &gt;&gt; So, he's here. &gt;&gt; He's here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you have need of? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we've seen some pretty fantastic things happen in this building. &gt;&gt; Not because of the building, but because of the people in the building. &gt;&gt; Because the character of the people is the beauty of the church. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this church is some beautiful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But this guy's faith began to grow because he heard the commotion. And what did he do? He wasn't interested in what anybody thought. He wasn't interested in what anybody had told him in that moment. He knew that he was going to cry out. And and it's funny because as he began to cry out, what happened? Verse 48 says, "Many charged him that he should hold his peace." Many charged him and told him that he should hold his peace. How would we be with a blind beggar on the side of the road holding a maybe a pot and a sign while we have a great church service going on? Will we be the same? Would we say, "No, no, no. Just hold your peace. Don't get too excited. Don't don't don't be saying, "I'm healed. I'm healed." Even though we know you're blind. Look at you, [laughter] you blind shoe cobbler. You're going up and down the aisles waving a hat on a cane saying, "I'm healed. I'm healed." Deacon, stop that man. No, &gt;&gt; we're going to say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something about being blind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And being able to see, &gt;&gt; even though naturally with our eyes we can't, but yet with our heart somehow we can. And somehow with our ears we can because if we give it an ear to hear. But many people charged him to hold his peace. Be quiet. Don't make a scene. But he cried the more a great deal. Can you imagine what that looked like? Telling him to be quiet. Don't yell. Now we have children and we try and console them sometimes. Maybe even in the church in the sanctuary, they'll start fussing and get fussy and maybe they want to do something and the parents don't want them to do that and they'll just throw a fit. And it happens. I've got three kids and sometimes it happened with us. It happens. But what happens is the child starts to get fussy and the more you try to console them and stop them, the more they fuss. There's only one thing left to do and that's to take them out of the sanctuary. But situations like that with a baby. Can you imagine a grown man &gt;&gt; realizing that this could be my chance? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This could be my chance. The master is walking by. The Messiah is walking by. All that I've heard about is right here right now. and I can see it for myself and I'm not going to let anybody stop me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know that's what happens when we get that level of faith. This man had a body change because of the faith that welled UP INSIDE OF HIM. AND WHAT DID JESUS SAY? THY FAITH hath made thee whole. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's pretty tremendous, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So tonight I want to remind us we're not talking about our faith. &gt;&gt; We're talking about something else. We're going to get into that. We still got time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Today I had a a little a little a little discussion with a guy and uh it was quite interesting. He's a painter and he he knew that I was going to go to service tonight and uh he said to me at at the sort of the end of the day, he said, "So so what are you going to do now?" And I said, "Well," and he said, "Are you going to go to church?" And I said, "Well, yeah." And he said, "Oh, you're a man of God." And I'm like, "Yeah, how'd you know that?" And he's like, "I know." And I'm like, "Oh, okay." And he said, "You know, I've I've I've been persecuted and I I just don't understand. I just don't understand." And I said, "Well, you don't have to understand. Why don't you come to church? Are you coming tonight?" And he said, "Are you inviting me?" And I said, "Of course I am. Come on." &gt;&gt; You know what? And he said, "Oh, I'm I'm a Muslim. Would that be okay?" And I said, "Sure. Come on." And he said, "I've been persecuted." I said, "Really? Why were you persecuted?" And he said, "Because I wouldn't pray." And I'm like, "Really? Who persecuted you?" And he said, "My dad." I said, "Really?" And that was because his dad persecuted him. His dad's dad. His grandpa persecuted his dad. His dad persecuted him. So, I was interested in how he's calling it persecution. I don't know what it was. That's just the word that he used. But he said he he forced us to pray and and a lot and and he said, "It just didn't encourage me to this faith, but I still find myself a Muslim." And I said, "Well, you don't have to be." &gt;&gt; But I thought it was interesting. I said, you know, I I actually make a point of not forcing anything. I said, "I've got children, and my greatest desire with my children is to actually get them to have their very own personal experience with Jesus Christ themselves. And that way, I don't have to persecute them to pray." And I think that's incredible because that's the last thing we want to do is persecute our children to pray. &gt;&gt; What kind of thing is that? What kind of God are you praying to? &gt;&gt; That's right. It's just so amazing to think that we don't we don't serve a God like that, do we? &gt;&gt; We serve a loving God. &gt;&gt; We serve a gentleman. He he doesn't force himself on anyone. &gt;&gt; Doesn't persecute us to pray. But I just thought it was interesting. So if uh if you can think about it, just remember a fellow named Ally in prayer. I'm going to continue to express the Lord Jesus Christ to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We had a real good conversation and he was very respectful &gt;&gt; and uh he said you can call me Eli because then you don't have to think of me as a Muslim and I said I don't know I don't know whatever it doesn't bother me. Um but yeah I'm just going to continue to speak to him and see what the Lord will do. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know faith is the substance of things hoped for and it's the evidence of things not seen. Faith is not the same [snorts] as hope. &gt;&gt; Sometimes in our lives, we can hope for things, but it's not faith. &gt;&gt; It's not actually the faith that's going to take us to the place we want to be. You know, out of 1954, I believe this is part of the quotes that I sent. Thy faith has saved thee. And brother Brandham is it's exactly out of Mark chapter 10, the story of blind Barameus. And this is where he says it and Jesus stood still. He says, "Oh, I love that his faith stopped Jesus in his track." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? And tonight, I want to encourage us, brothers and sisters, as we talk about these quotes, as we talk about this faith. This isn't the faith of some other group somewhere else in in in history or in the future. This is the faith of the saints. The faith of the believers in the day in which we live. This is what I want to encourage us to to think about it. Not just blind Barnameus's faith, sons and daughters of God's faith. &gt;&gt; Stop Jesus in his track. And when we talk about these reading these quotes, we could probably preach just on this one paragraph and Jesus stood still. Oh, I love that his faith stopped Jesus in his track. To think that this is just a man speaking or is it the Holy Ghost speaking directly through a man to a generation? &gt;&gt; I think it's the latter. &gt;&gt; Jesus stood still. His faith stopped Jesus in his track. Tonight, I want to encourage us to stop Jesus in his track. &gt;&gt; We're not going to force Jesus to do anything. The only thing that we're going to do is humble ourselves unto him. And how do we do that? We do it by his word. But I think it's even further than that. How do we do it in the natural world in which we live in? We submit ourselves one to another &gt;&gt; in the fear of God. &gt;&gt; And we know we talked about it a while back, but maybe we'll get into it again. Talking about roles, husbands and wives and and children before any of that. It says submitting yourselves therefore one to another. If we're not willing to do that, then we might as well forget about saying, "I'm the husband. Reverence me. And I'm the wife. You got to love me." If we're not interested in doing that, how could we possibly think that somebody else is going to follow in their the the the word of God? We've got to be willing to take the word of God for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we'll demonstrate it by the way we live. &gt;&gt; But our faith has the ability to stop Jesus in his track. If he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, brothers and sisters, don't you think that we could stop him in his track if we have a need tonight? Faith is a person. Faith is a person. I want to say that a few times. Faith is a person. The person of Jesus Christ living out through our lives through his spirit. Not as a second person, not as a third person, the person. &gt;&gt; Not even as the first person, the person. The person of Jesus Christ is faith. out of thy faith has saved thee. In 1954 0411, brother Brandham says that all that screaming going on. Jesus never noticed it. He walks steadily on towards Jerusalem. Just the way that he portrays these is just unreal. He walks steadily on towards Jerusalem knowing that that was his own children crying for his blood. Can you imagine that? Anybody here ever seen The Chosen? Have you seen The Chosen? [clears throat] If you see this depicted in that show, they show Jerusalem a buzz. Jerusalem has something going on that's never happened before. There is an element of anticipation that something really big is taking place. The way they portrayed in that show, it's pretty good, I have to say. But that actually speaks to this. Jesus never noticed all the all the noise. He just walked steadily on towards Jerusalem knowing that that was his own children crying for his blood. And he couldn't turn them down. Can you think how that could possibly be? How can a father turn his own children down? They were crying for his blood. They hadn't even said it yet. Let his blood be upon us and our children. When Pilate said, "Hey, what would you rather have? The murderer, Barabus, or Jesus the man?" And they said, "Give us the murderer." A and they said on top of that, "And let his blood be upon us." and our children. [clears throat] That one just about made me fall over when I was able to connect the dots when I started actually really reading the Bible and and getting revelation by the spirit about this word to recognize the persecution of the Jews throughout the ages is exactly that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's exactly that. Let his blood be upon us and our children throughout all the generations, but it ain't going to be long before that blood isn't going to be there anymore. It's not going to be on them. They're going to RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S ON CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; They'll recognize the same blood that we recognize. &gt;&gt; But he walks steadily on towards Jerusalem. How many of us would walk steadily on towards our crucifixion? My knowing that was his own children crying for his blood and they could he couldn't turn them down. How could a father turn his own children down? And here he walks onto Jerusalem. But this poor old blind beggar, this poor old blind beggar standing way back. People tried to stop him from crying. I believe good people with good intentions. And you know, isn't that the way it is in the church? Good people with good intentions sometimes can cause severe problems, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Really deep hurt. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. in a moment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good people with good intentions. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Meaning, well, &gt;&gt; causing major problems. &gt;&gt; Good people with good intentions. No, no, no. Don't get too excited. Just be quiet. You're just a blind beggar. This is the Messiah here. And I mean, I probably would feel the same way. &gt;&gt; I honestly would probably feel the same way. THIS THIS IS MESSIAH. GET OUT OF THE WAY. Make room for the king. It's the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good people with good intentions. But said, "Set down. Don't make so much noise. Why the days of miracles has passed?" &gt;&gt; If we ever hear that, that's a lying spirit. &gt;&gt; That's a lying spirit. &gt;&gt; The days of miracles has passed. &gt;&gt; My good people with good intentions You know, our priest tells us that. And do you want to be considered with a bunch of fanatics? Sit down. And you know, sometimes this can apply because we can have former teachings and we can say, "Well, that supersedes this." &gt;&gt; And and I say that's good if it does. If if anything supersedes, let it be this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's man, this &gt;&gt; But if it's this, I think it's important to make sure that it's not man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It has to be the word of God, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we can actually have something in our lives where we say, you know, our our priest, our former pastor, he tells us that this is the way we ought to do it. And and and where does that come from? If it's in the word of God, great. Let's do it. But if it's not in the word of God, hold on a second. Let's pump the brakes. Let's make sure the days of miracles aren't passed. We know that. You know, our priests tell us that. And and do you want to be considered with a bunch of fanatics? Yep. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. As long as it's with the word of God. It's got to be with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can hear them saying, "Sit down." And and what did this man do? He turned a deaf ear to them. He didn't even argue with them, did he? &gt;&gt; Why not? &gt;&gt; Because Jesus was passing by. &gt;&gt; And I think that's really important for us to to to just consider if we haven't ever, you know, the time and space that we're living in. We can spend our time being critical and and considering things, examining things, and having a whole bunch of examination and and missing out on what's actually taking place because of all of our criticism and our our thinking and and maybe it should be this way and it's not this way, it should be that way and it's not that way. Maybe we could be missing what's actually taking place right now. &gt;&gt; And we know that brother Brandham says it many, many times in the message of the hour. TALK ABOUT WHAT HE'S done in the past and we talk about what he's going to do in the future, but we ignore what's taking place right now. &gt;&gt; And let's not put it off, brothers and sisters. Let's not take it and put it off and say, "Well, we're not looking back at what Brother Brandham did and saying that was all tremendous." And we're going to look forwards to what God's going to do in the future. We're going to see a body change. What about in our very own lives? Let's not get hung up 40 years ago thinking that things were great 40 years ago. And my goodness, it's going to be so tremendous when we get a new body. What about right now, tonight? What's the Lord doing tonight here in THIS BUILDING, A CALVARY LIVING WORD ASSEMBLY? NOT the assembly of of the people, with the charitable organization, but with the assembly of the spirit of Jesus Christ in our lives. What is he doing in our lives right now? Are we a bunch of fanatics? Are we more concerned about just telling people to sit down and don't get out of order? Don't don't get too excited. I want to say get excited. I want to say get out of order. &gt;&gt; Let the spirit of the Lord move in our midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This guy, he turned a deaf ear to them. He said, "Thou son of David, have mercy on me. My only hope is leaving me. If I don't cry out right now, &gt;&gt; I might not get another chance. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters, when we gather together this way, &gt;&gt; can you guarantee there's another chance? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We've got our schedules booked. We've got our time frames figured out. Our lives are are secured in terms of planning, but there's no guarantees we're going to have another opportunity to worship God the way that he's provided for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no guarantee when we're sitting in the in the in the street as it were on on the stones that were knocked down by the spirit of the Lord. There's no guarantee that we're going to have the opportunity to cry out to the Messiah as he passes by again. But he turned a deaf ear to them. He said, "Thou son of David, have mercy on me. I don't have time to argue with you about whether I should be quiet or whether I should shout. He's going. I can hear. He's going. I'm not gonna miss him. I'm not going to let anybody or anything stand between me. And we know, brother Brandham said it in the church age book. Remember this. Never let anyone or anything get between you and this word &gt;&gt; because as soon as something like that does, guess what? He's going to keep going. He's not gonna stop. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; We've got to have the faith to stop him in his tracks. &gt;&gt; Turn a deaf ear. I want to say that tonight. Turn a deaf ear. &gt;&gt; Turn a deaf ear to the devil. Turn a deaf ear to critics. &gt;&gt; Turn a deaf ear to all of our our our inhibitions. Turn a deaf ear to ourselves and say, "Be it unto me according TO THY WORD. LET THAT LIFE COME TO TO BIRTH INSIDE of me in a way like maybe it never has. [clears throat] Because you know why we keep talking like this, brothers and sisters? We keep talking like this because and I'm I'm preaching to me now. I'm preaching to brother Barry. If if that screen was here, the glass, I'd be looking in the mirror. But I'll tell you what, I'm talking to me tonight. We're not going to suddenly have a body change and a character change. &gt;&gt; The promise is for a body change. The character change happens right now. This is the rubber meeting the road is us changing our characters and not us changing our characters but him CHANGING OUR CHARACTERS, US HUMBLING OURSELVES TO THE WORD OF GOD. And the more that I surrender, the more he takes control. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's not the more he takes control, THE MORE I SURRENDER. &gt;&gt; We surrender first. &gt;&gt; Amen. He takes control. Second, you know, we heard it on Sunday. Submit yourselves therefore unto God. Resist the devil and he will flee. &gt;&gt; I'll never forget it. Brother Aaron Mciri preached a notable message about that. He said, you know, many times people say it, resist the devil and he will flee. And amen, he will. That's the word of God. But don't forget that first part. It's like putting a key into an ignition. You can turn the ignition all you want without the key and it's not going to do nothing. &gt;&gt; Submit yourself therefore unto God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you can resist the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if we're in a position where we're just not submitting ourselves unto God, we can resist the devil all we want and he knows that we're bluffing. &gt;&gt; We're not going to fool the devil and we're not going to fool God. And and you know, sadly, I think that we're not really going to fool ourselves, but we can for a while. We can fool ourselves, &gt;&gt; but we need to start turning a deaf ear to the devil. Turn a deaf ear to the critics. Turn a deaf ear to all of the negative in our lives. All of the negative in our lives. Turn a deaf ear to it. Go like this. La. Don't listen to it. &gt;&gt; Negative is going to take you down. Negative is the devil. &gt;&gt; I'll say that again tonight. Negative is the devil. &gt;&gt; If we're always dwelling in a negative realm, we're giving PLACE TO THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; TELL HIM TO SHUT [screaming] UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Tell him to beat it. &gt;&gt; Show him surrender on your knees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Show him surrender on your knees. Show him that you worship God. And that's why we come to church is to show THE DEVIL WHOSE SIDE we're on. &gt;&gt; Not just to do that though, but to actually feed on the word. But turn a deaf ear to the devil. This guy, he said, "Thou son of David, have mercy on me. My only hope IS LEAVING ME. I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT GO. OH GOD, be merciful to me. A blind man." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And something touched the master. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just think it's so relevant to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have got to be willing to be this outrageous, this outlandish in our lives, &gt;&gt; this outspoken in our lives. OH, THOU SON OF DAVID, HAVE MERCY NOT ON EVERYONE ELSE. HAVE MERCY ON ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET IT BE ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE, you know, we hear it said many times, how can we ever give out if we don't take in? How are we ever going to have any faith to show other people if we don't have faith on our own? And I'm not talking about just working it up. And don't get me wrong, I'm talking about letting him, the person of Jesus Christ, you know, the repentance for our sins, baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins, and then baptism in water, baptism of the Holy Ghost, but then not just staying there. Many people have done that. 40 years ago I got baptized. Sure. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, but still living a life that's a little bit contrary, a little bit edgy, a little bit crusty, a little bit prickly. Something's wrong. There's not just exactly the spirit of Christ in there. There's someone else living in there. Two people are not going to live in the same house. Christ is sovereign. He's only going to live alone. But we can come to a place where we've got to give away to the spirit of Jesus Christ. The person of Jesus Christ. The baptism of the Holy Ghost gives way to the person of Jesus Christ. That's actually a quote. We're not going to go too far into that tonight. But I want to encourage us to turn a deaf ear to all of the negative in our lives. He said, "Thou son of David, have mercy on me." I want to say tonight, we should be saying these words, "Thou son of David, have mercy on me. Thou son of God, have mercy on me. Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me. Stop him in his tracks, brothers and sisters. See if he won't stop and listen. My only hope is leaving me. Oh God, be merciful to me, a blind man. And something touched the master. And the faith of that blind, ragged beggar stopped Jesus Christ in his tracks. Now, I ain't just making this up. This is what the prophet says. It'll do the same thing tonight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It'll do the same thing tonight. &gt;&gt; Anybody here have a need? &gt;&gt; Anybody here have a situation that we have to contend with that we just don't know what to do? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Stop him in his tracks. &gt;&gt; See if he's not God. &gt;&gt; Say, "I'M NOT INTERESTED IN LOOKING FORWARDS. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN LOOKING BACKWARDS. I'M ONLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING FORWARDS TO YOU. RIGHT AT YOU. Something touched the master and the faith of that blind ragged beggar. You know, every single one of us outside of Christ in our lives, that's our description. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Common people, &gt;&gt; just common folks, right? Ragged, blind beggars. Now, how could we possibly be that? We know the word of God says that the Leoysian people, what are they? They're naked. They're blind &gt;&gt; and they don't even know it. They think that, oh, I'm so perfectly clothed. Look at me. Yeah, that's not where we want to be. We want to be trusting the Lord with all of our hearts. He stopped, looked around, and said, "Bring him here." Can you imagine that tonight for us to call on the master while he walks by one more time through this congregation up and down the aisles? Don't think that he's not here, brothers and sisters. He's here. The same one that we're talking about in this story is in this building right now. He's here right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Call on him and see. I saw many, many hands go up when I asked that question tonight. I SHOULD HAVE PUT MY HAND UP. BUT TO THINK ABOUT IT, THE SAME EXACT PERSON THAT WAS WALKING on that street is in this building tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He stopped and looked around and said, "Bring them here." Can you imagine having the master, the king of kings and lord of lords, Jesus Christ himself say, "Stop everything and bring that man to me. Bring that sister to me." She has called my name. She has a faith inside of her that's going to change the course of this action right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she touched my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Some of them said, "Be of a good cheer. He calleth thee. Can you imagine? Isn't it wonderful when we see someone get the victory? &gt;&gt; Isn't it? &gt;&gt; Suddenly we change from being those ones saying, "Shh, stop. Don't get too excited." We can see them getting a victory and and all of a sudden NOW IT'S LIKE, "WOW, THIS IS TREMENDOUS." &gt;&gt; NOW, I'll say this. I'm going to use it for an example, and I trust that it will be okay. But you know, sitting right over here, right about where where brother and sister Paul and Elaine and and brother Elias and Sister Shellyley, Sister Rebecca Hildebrandt was sitting right there during a song service one night. And you could imagine that THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME PEOPLE, maybe even devils, trying to tell her, "Shh, don't don't get too excited. Don't do anything too excited." BUT RIGHT THERE IN A SONG SERVICE, SOMETHING SAID, "STAND UP AND RECEIVE YOUR HEALING FOR THE breast cancer." &gt;&gt; And what'd SHE DO? I WITNESSED IT WITH MY EYES. I WATCHED HER STAND UP AND START TO worship and she was healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there was probably critics, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you know, I'll say this, maybe to some extent I was one of them. &gt;&gt; Maybe. But I'll tell you this. I saw her stand up and guess what? I did too. &gt;&gt; I SAID, "AMEN. LET'S WORSHIP GOD. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Some of them, some of the ones that might have said, "Sh, don't get too excited. It's the master. We're having church. Don't don't don't get out of order." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't get too excited. You know, things have to be a certain way, &gt;&gt; do they? &gt;&gt; I want to say that tonight. Do they? &gt;&gt; God is a God of order. But what does he want more than anything, brothers and sisters? He wants our heart. &gt;&gt; He wants a genuine heart. And when we're in the midst of worship, &gt;&gt; just let it fly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; When we're dealing with gifts, we're not going to go out of order. &gt;&gt; We will not go out of order if we have his spirit inside of us. &gt;&gt; It's impossible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He will never be contrary to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But talking about this story here, he says, "Some of them be of a good cheer. He calleth thee." Maybe some of the naysayers, they saw something was happening. The master stopped and said, "Get him. I want to talk to that guy right there. The one that was just being sh, oh, look at faith. Go to work." Now, he says, &gt;&gt; "And that's the way it is." If you ever listen to the messages and you listen to the very end in in 63 and 64 60 61 62 59 58 all of the message if you ever listen through all the way brother Brandham he'll do some discernments and he'll talk and then suddenly something happens you can hear a shift in the service at the end of the service. What is it? It's the Holy Ghost falling. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost falling on the service, on the congregation, going from the man in the front to the people in the group. It's a tremendous thing. And you know, some people start screaming. They can't control themselves. Sisters just start screaming at THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS. WHAT WOULD THAT HAPPEN IN OUR MIDST tonight if that started happening? might get uncomfortable, but you know what, brothers and sisters, that might be healthy for us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When the spirit of God really falls on someone, we don't act like ourselves because we're not. &gt;&gt; How could we act like ourselves under the influence of the spirit of God? &gt;&gt; But some of these people, they said, "Be of good cheer. He calleth thee." He says, "Look at faith. Go to work." Now, it was starting to spread. People were starting to get excited. something was taking place. Look at Faith. Go to work now. He says, "Faith leaps up, grabs his ragged coat, and throws it sideways. Not laying, not placing it down right here, and then feeling his way along so he can remember what it feels like, where his coat is." No, just taking it off and throwing it. SOMETHING ROSE UP INSIDE of this guy. Notice where he lays it nice so he could pick it up or find it when he was feeling his way around the wall. He had an audience with Jesus. He just threw it. &gt;&gt; He knew he would get what he wanted as long as he could have an audience with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Going to jump to the punchline tonight, brothers and sisters, right now. Right now, this moment, you've got an audience with Jesus. &gt;&gt; We have an audience with Jesus. &gt;&gt; He says, "And brother, sister, tonight, let's have an audience WITH JESUS TONIGHT. ASK, HE SAID, AND YE shall receive." &gt;&gt; Amen. But many times we ask to consume it on our lusts in our lives. We don't ask correctly and then we wonder why. And sometimes we ask for things that we're just not going to receive. And we have to be able to say amen. You know, we've read it in the message. Brother Brandham says that's that's one of the marks of a true Christian. Someone who can actually say, "I don't understand it. You haven't answered my prayer the way that I've asked it, but I love you anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is powerful. That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, "Brother, sister, tonight, let's just have an audience with Jesus tonight." Ask, he said, "And you shall receive." What you ask the father in my name, that I'll do. Let's ask an audience with him tonight. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, we got just a few minutes left. He he didn't say, "Bardemus, are you a Pharisee or a Sadducee or a publican?" And you know where brother Barry would go with this. What what message do you go to? What who's your pastor? &gt;&gt; What is it that you believe? He didn't go to him and say that. And he's not going TO DO THAT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He's going to say, "Do you believe the word?" &gt;&gt; Because if you believe the word, then you will actually call on him the way that he wants to be called and you will stop him in his tracks. But he doesn't say Bararddameus are you a Pharisee or a Sadducee or a publican or what are you Bararddameus? That didn't matter nothing to Jesus. &gt;&gt; A man in need had faith enough to stop him. &gt;&gt; And you know that's why brothers and sisters in the age in which we live in if we wonder why we have trials. It's exactly why. Because he wants to shake us out of the people that we are. He wants us to recognize the only way that we're going to have the faith that we need to change our bodies is to actually go through the fiery trials of affliction because it's building that character. It's molding that gold that can only be bought from him. He says it in the Leodysian church age. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire. And we know we learned about that. That's the character of God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith and fear cannot coexist. And you can tell in this message that they didn't in this man in blind Barnameus. Fear did not actually exist in that man. Brother Brandham goes on to say, I'll call the musicians as we close. If I don't call them, then I'll just want to keep preaching. I feel like I just want to start preaching now. He goes on to say, now he didn't say the days of miracles has passed. Jesus didn't. He didn't try to. Barnameus wasn't asking Lord that I might. I'm blind. I'm a blind man. I've been told the days of miracles is passed. But if I'm told I'm a believer in God that I'll go to heaven someday. Oh, good master, tell me what heaven looks like, will I receive my sight when I get to heaven? I love the way he says this because this points out, it underscores the fact that we're not going to have a new character when we get there. Let's not talk about what our character will be like when we get there. It's going to be a perfect character. We're going to have a perfect character here. &gt;&gt; And the perfect character, the perfection that we're talking about isn't character that's maybe perfect heavenly character that you might hear maybe have the the idea of a angelic character. We're humans and we're going to suffer as humans until our bodies do change. But when we're talking about with perfect character, perfect character, perfection is mature character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Complete character. Ability to say, "Beat it, Satan. I can call you out every single time you come around me." Brother Brandham says that we'll be able to be that way in the in the series adoption where the devil just won't want nothing to do with you because you can see him coming a mile away. He says, "Oh, good master, tell me what heaven looks like. Will I receive my sight when I get to heaven? Is this God's blessings for me to be blind as I've been told?" Sometimes we can look at our problems in life and say, "Is this is God's blessing for my Maybe I'm supposed to do this. This is part of my character molding. Maybe it's the devil." and God is waiting to see if we're going to have the faith that will actually move the situation. He said that wasn't what blind Barnameus wanted. Blind Barameus wanted to receive his sight. That was the first thing. Get out of that dark world he was living in. And Jesus said, "Thy faith has saved thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turned and walked on up the road. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I can see old blind Barnameus. He's staggering yet in the dark. Walked over and got out of the crowd said, "Let me see now if I can see my hand. I believe I am. He's He's done told me what his word is. He's God. What what he said is true." Waited a little while and the crowd going up this up the road, he said, "Let's see." He told me as I believed it. I believe. Oh, I see now. Light begins to break into his eyes. And he didn't stay silent, did he? No. &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close tonight. &gt;&gt; He didn't stay silent when that light begins to break into his eyes. And tonight, brothers and sisters, we're not talking about the the the natural lights. We can see these natural lights. We're talking about the invisible light of faith. One of the gifts that God has given to the church. We're talking about his faith in our lives. And it only comes from believing. He says, "Oh, I see now." The light begins to break into his eyes. Screamed to the top of his voice and down the road he went to follow Jesus. There it is. Why? All because he had found an audience with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just have an audience with him now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just confess our sins and our weaknesses of human beings. And you know, that's all we need to do really is just confess our humanity before him. Humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord. I just want to say this before we close tonight. I'm I'm going to bring these in the future. I'm not done with faith. I'm not even started with faith. [laughter] I don't know how we're going to be able to do this. But, you know, I just want to encourage us if you want a little homework assignment. If you don't, it's okay. I'm not trying to put any pressure on, but if you want something to think about, go and look up faith is not, type in faith is not into the message and read what Brother Brandham says about it. If we have any struggles with faith, just read what he says about it. I think it's such an encouragement because he tells us what it's not. And so if we can look at those knots and maybe see that some of the things parallel what's going on in our lives, then maybe what we can do is see that maybe what we think we have as faith just isn't really faith because the prophet said faith is not. So what is it then? And and I think there's a whole bunch that we can get into. We're not going to now. I can see that we're past nine. I just want to say God richly bless you all for coming out on a Wednesday night. It's wonderful to celebrate the life of Jesus Christ together once again. Let's just bow in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for your word. We thank you, Lord Jesus, that [music] we know that it's a living word. And father, our desire is to see this word living so strongly in our lives that Father, there's there's really no room for anything else in this world because there's nothing in this world that's really going to satisfy us as sons and daughters. Father, really the only thing that satisfies a a believer is you and your word. That is the only satisfaction in this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything else pales in comparison to you, Father. Lord, we know that we live in these bodies. We live in these minds. But Father, we pray that you would change our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that Lord, we could mold ourselves and shape ourselves to your word rather than trying to mold and shape your word to us. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that Lord Jesus, you would just reveal yourself to us and through us in just a greater measure, Father, as we go forwards, Lord, that we would begin to see this this faith manifesting in our lives as we've heard about that we should see these things. We should be able to have a supernatural experience in our lives and understand that it's you with us. Father, we love you and we thank you for your goodness to us. Thank you for the story of blind Bardameus, Lord, to recognize that that that truly is a believer until the moment they recognize that it has to be their own experience. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We are all truly blind until you open our eyes. Father, I pray that you would open the eyes of our hearts, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. that you would reveal yourself to us in a greater way, Father. That Lord, we would be able to show the world all around us that you are a living God. That it is a living word. That it's not something that we preach. It's something that we live. And once in a while, we'll actually preach. &gt;&gt; Father, tonight we just want to commit each life into your hands. Lord, we pray that as we've read, that you would forgive us for our humanity. &gt;&gt; That you would forgive us for our shortcomings and our sins, Lord. And that, Father, we could just commit our lives fresh unto you once again. That as we go forwards, Lord, we would make a room for you to walk by our lives. And as you do, Father, we would just cry out to you once again every day of our lives, Lord. Father, we just ask that you would keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways. We love you, Lord, and we thank you for your goodness and your tender mercy to us. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing 1062? New mercy, new mercy.
