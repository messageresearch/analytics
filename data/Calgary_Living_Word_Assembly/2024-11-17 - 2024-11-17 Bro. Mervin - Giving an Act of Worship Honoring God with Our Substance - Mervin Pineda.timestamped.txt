[1:07:14] Amen to Worship the Lord in spirit and
[1:07:17] in truth amen so I have two parts of uh
[1:07:21] presentation or you can say first is the
[1:07:24] report for the Philippine uh typhoon and
[1:07:28] flood and uh pretty much it's a video
[1:07:32] and some pictures maybe you can be seit
[1:07:35] and then we'll so it will be easy thank
[1:07:38] you
[1:07:43] musician so the first uh first
[1:07:47] PowerPoint brother Josh Philippines
[1:07:49] report love offering for the typhoon
[1:07:51] just a check okay all right so
[1:07:57] so you can see
[1:08:00] uh we provided love offerings to the
[1:08:04] Philippines who got affected with this
[1:08:06] flood you can see it's in CNN and all
[1:08:09] over the place uh but we are we
[1:08:12] concentrated on giving some love
[1:08:14] offerings to to the church there which
[1:08:17] uh well which we knew and we contacted
[1:08:22] directly right and uh
[1:08:25] so you can see it's in CNN some people
[1:08:29] passed away but praise the Lord some of
[1:08:31] the or most most of the Saints there are
[1:08:35] safe and uh we were able to provide some
[1:08:39] uh relief goods and what not but uh
[1:08:42] let's put some history on it so severe
[1:08:47] typhoon you can see there tropical storm
[1:08:50] Christine that's the name locally and
[1:08:52] it's inter internationally known as tra
[1:08:55] so if you if you check in in YouTube or
[1:08:59] or in the internet you will you will
[1:09:01] find that the Bol region of the
[1:09:03] Philippines was hit severely so the
[1:09:06] storm made landfall on October 23rd 2024
[1:09:09] bringing heavy rainfall that led to
[1:09:11] widespread flooding and landslides
[1:09:13] across the region the B region
[1:09:15] particularly the provinces of albai and
[1:09:18] kamarina Sur so kamarin isur uh the the
[1:09:21] town is Nawa and the province is kamarin
[1:09:24] Sur that's where
[1:09:26] uh the church is uh the name of their
[1:09:29] church is the house of God the oh the
[1:09:34] house of God's word yeah th
[1:09:38] HG W yeah yeah and their Pastor is
[1:09:41] brother Ryan Mendoza and I've been in
[1:09:43] contact with him uh in Facebook and yeah
[1:09:46] he gave me all the pictures they are not
[1:09:48] from the internet so they came from him
[1:09:51] directly the B region particularly the
[1:09:53] provinces of albai and kamarina
[1:09:56] experienced significant flooding as
[1:09:58] early as October 21st 2024 due to the
[1:10:01] storm's slow approach and intense
[1:10:04] rainfall the severe weather conditions
[1:10:07] persisted for several days causing
[1:10:09] extensive damage and loss of
[1:10:12] life so you can see the Philippines for
[1:10:15] those who already went there so this is
[1:10:18] Manila here and this is Palawan but this
[1:10:21] is where Nawa is it's in the the eastern
[1:10:25] part it's in the middle you see
[1:10:26] Philippines has
[1:10:28] 7,700 Islands including uninhabited ones
[1:10:32] so but uh you can see it's prone to
[1:10:36] typhoons and storms but wherever you go
[1:10:39] the only uh Pro safe place is in the
[1:10:42] Lord right it's in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:44] wherever you go we we also experience
[1:10:46] flooding flooding here in 2013 we
[1:10:49] experience fire here we experience wars
[1:10:52] in the Middle East wherever you go
[1:10:54] there's nothing safe
[1:10:55] that's why we need to go away from from
[1:10:58] this Earthly uh from this Earth amen so
[1:11:02] this is the you can see the the full
[1:11:05] Philippines there almost then I a little
[1:11:08] bit zoomed
[1:11:10] in so that's where NAB
[1:11:14] here right oh previous previous to that
[1:11:17] there there's a previous
[1:11:21] one are there on two there bear with me
[1:11:27] okay yeah that's where it is you can see
[1:11:30] this is where we went Kuran before with
[1:11:32] the with the Johnson's you can see how
[1:11:35] far it is we we stayed in Manila and
[1:11:38] this is our home in Angela City this is
[1:11:40] uh sister uh the aqu Queens live sister
[1:11:49] uh Judith yeah sister Judith uh brother
[1:11:53] Cyrus uh sister Zen
[1:11:55] this is their place we're we're a bit
[1:11:57] close maybe around 1 and a half hour
[1:12:00] away right and uh yeah so that's
[1:12:05] where Nawa is this is this is the
[1:12:08] location here so even further you can
[1:12:13] see so it's close to the to the shore
[1:12:16] also so that's why they experience a lot
[1:12:18] of flooding so before the typhoon and
[1:12:21] the
[1:12:23] flood that's their Church chur typically
[1:12:26] while they're waiting for the flood at
[1:12:28] least they gathered and then you can see
[1:12:31] they have some good uh fellowships
[1:12:36] there that's their
[1:12:39] Church yeah you can see no no flood
[1:12:42] there all good they have a good church
[1:12:44] amen they were
[1:12:48] blessed so you can see that's the
[1:12:50] entrance of door of the church and they
[1:12:53] have this vehicle which totally
[1:12:56] submerged and it's totally wrecked right
[1:12:58] now that's what the brother they use
[1:13:01] this to to transport Believers because
[1:13:03] uh you know in the Philippines if you
[1:13:05] were there it's difficult to go from one
[1:13:07] place to place without a vehicle and
[1:13:09] this is totally
[1:13:10] submerged and it's not working it's
[1:13:13] totally wrecked they have three vehicles
[1:13:16] in the church they use for for the
[1:13:18] ministry they are all gun and the other
[1:13:20] two with the brothers they're also gun
[1:13:22] so yeah let's pray for them but for us
[1:13:25] we cannot help everyone we cannot meet
[1:13:27] all the needs of the whole wide world
[1:13:29] right so we we can only help what what
[1:13:32] is before us amen so we're not trying to
[1:13:36] ask or pull money it's just this is an
[1:13:39] opportunity for us it's not a burden
[1:13:41] it's an opportunity to help because when
[1:13:43] you help you'll be
[1:13:44] given uh abundantly multiple folds amen
[1:13:49] so during the flood and the typhoon so
[1:13:53] miles oh do you have sound
[1:14:03] brother
[1:14:13] brother
[1:14:16] CH Church

[1:16:02] are rescued not the human beings so
[1:16:05] we're we're thankful still amen
[1:16:08] so so you can see the the effect of that
[1:16:14] tropical storm amen so next slide

[1:16:25] slide now
[1:16:27] yeah okay so these are pictures now this

[1:16:42] so you see all totally
[1:16:43] submerged
[1:16:45] amen uh this is their church after the
[1:16:49] flooding which they evacuated they use
[1:16:52] the Strong Tower which is the church
[1:16:54] good thing that it's founded on Solid
[1:16:57] Rock of stones and
[1:17:01] concrete
[1:17:04] yeah okay this is Bayan NG NAA means
[1:17:07] town of nabua it's totally submerged
[1:17:10] almost you can say
[1:17:15] yeah all
[1:17:17] right uh you'll see the good Smiles of
[1:17:21] Filipino people in despite of the the
[1:17:24] flooding and everything that's maybe
[1:17:26] that's why you can see us always smiling
[1:17:28] maybe when you're even when talking but
[1:17:31] uh yeah we'll try to be Canadians maybe
[1:17:36] and I don't know I'm just yeah okay so
[1:17:41] so yeah some of the Pastors in Lon went
[1:17:44] there I think we met them brother Berry
[1:17:45] this is brother dondon and brother Val
[1:17:48] they and this is the pastor brother Ryan
[1:17:51] and this is one of the deacons of
[1:17:53] brother Bal so they went there after the
[1:17:55] flood then they they also help of course
[1:17:59] this one is uh world news right so they
[1:18:02] ask for help also from from other from
[1:18:05] other churches which is good that's why
[1:18:08] we are here we we belong to the mystical
[1:18:10] body right we don't only sit here and be
[1:18:14] fat in the word or or be fat in what we
[1:18:16] receive financially we we extend we're
[1:18:20] stewards amen
[1:18:26] okay first service after the church they
[1:18:29] were able to you know you know how it
[1:18:31] goes uh despite of what happens you
[1:18:33] wanted to go to the uh to the to the
[1:18:36] house of the Lord amen and they were
[1:18:38] able to do
[1:18:40] that maybe a week after the
[1:18:43] flood
[1:18:45] yeah
[1:18:47] okay yeah he was able to preach so this
[1:18:51] is the the thing about the report so
[1:18:53] it's a love offering from Calgary Living
[1:18:55] Word assembly us amen so you can see we
[1:19:00] sent them sub substantial amount I won't
[1:19:03] mention but uh you know how it goes you
[1:19:05] gave it and uh we're so thankful even
[1:19:08] from the small kids I won't mention who
[1:19:11] but you will
[1:19:12] see the the the amount that you provided
[1:19:16] went like this they bought some good
[1:19:18] stuff right and it's not that cheap also
[1:19:22] there maybe half price some right like
[1:19:25] rice I've been talking to my wife it's
[1:19:28] 50% off compared there but we have
[1:19:30] jasmine rice which is the the good one
[1:19:32] but there they they're able to to live
[1:19:35] with a little bit of less quality but it
[1:19:38] go it goes uh maybe 50 to $60 for a 50
[1:19:42] caban uh 50 kilogram of rice right so
[1:19:45] but here we have 8 kilos $20 so it means
[1:19:49] it's more than double basically so they
[1:19:52] yeah I think this might be the the wife
[1:19:55] of brother uh Ryan
[1:19:58] so you see uh they bought a lot of rice
[1:20:03] in Philippines as long as you have rice
[1:20:06] you're good you can have only you know
[1:20:09] soy sauce maybe or salt or or maybe
[1:20:11] sugar then you'll make it work this is
[1:20:15] survival for them right and then they
[1:20:17] were so thankful when we contacted
[1:20:18] brother Ryan he was so thankful and then
[1:20:21] they were all crying and they're they're
[1:20:23] so thankful amen so you see for us This
[1:20:26] Is War can goods or War food but for
[1:20:29] them it's a luxury right because
[1:20:32] uh
[1:20:35] yeah yeah so you can
[1:20:38] see soap uh they they need to clean up
[1:20:42] uh you know
[1:20:44] Downey

[1:20:49] milk right so canned goods coffee right
[1:20:53] three in one
[1:20:57] I know the Johnson the Johnson kids love
[1:20:59] three in one so yeah this one is yeah
[1:21:04] oops so you can see the brothers and
[1:21:06] sisters helping to distribute it's just
[1:21:09] like the the time of
[1:21:11] the Pentecost when they put all things
[1:21:13] together and then you know distribute uh
[1:21:17] evenly amen not uh not one benefiting
[1:21:22] only right it's for everyone
[1:21:25] so they they did this more than 50
[1:21:28] families were were uh or benefited from
[1:21:33] this lab offerings this is just only
[1:21:35] from us okay they might have others but
[1:21:38] this one is immediately when I sent the
[1:21:40] money he went there with the you know
[1:21:43] I'll show you how the transportation
[1:21:45] there they are just using tricycle
[1:21:47] because the thing is it's flooded most
[1:21:49] of their vehicles are all flooded so
[1:21:51] it's a it's a it's a it's a bit uh uh
[1:21:55] difficult times uh for them
[1:21:58] amen okay and you can see so you see the
[1:22:02] bags that they provided plus the
[1:22:05] rice

[1:22:09] recipients
[1:22:11] okay uh I want to finish quickly but uh

[1:22:30] the one I'm talking about they've been
[1:22:31] delivering because some they cannot go
[1:22:33] anywhere so they have to you know use
[1:22:35] this kind of uh uh transport to to give
[1:22:39] it to to the Believers and not only
[1:22:43] Believers by the way he asked for
[1:22:44] permission can I ask the family that are
[1:22:47] not yet attend uh that are not yet
[1:22:49] baptized and not yet Believers but we
[1:22:52] want to be a blessing to them because
[1:22:54] they also stayed in their church I told
[1:22:56] him by all means
[1:22:58] brother this gospel is not only for the
[1:23:01] Believers we are here so that we can be
[1:23:04] stewards of what is given to us amen so
[1:23:07] you can see so yeah
[1:23:11] so these are the recipients you can see
[1:23:14] more than 50 families brothers and
[1:23:16] sisters for this little thing that we
[1:23:18] gave amen for us maybe it's just 40 Mor
[1:23:21] tons right or but for them it's it's
[1:23:24] life it extended their life
[1:23:27] yeah to help them amen so GL God bless
[1:23:31] you for that uh may the Lord richly
[1:23:34] bless
[1:23:44] you amen now we can go to
[1:23:48] preaching and teaching and it's related
[1:23:52] to that because we're giving amen giving
[1:23:54] as an act of worship honoring God with
[1:23:58] our substance amen and uh I know it
[1:24:02] looks like it's a finance week this week
[1:24:05] amen we have the spiritual we have the
[1:24:08] natural amen and we're so thankful we we
[1:24:11] just need to to uh recognize the gifts
[1:24:14] amen and uh we need to do it according
[1:24:17] to the word amen according to his
[1:24:20] leadership and we'll be good I mean uh
[1:24:23] not being good will be great because we
[1:24:26] are blessed amen beyond
[1:24:29] measure so this will be a a bit of a
[1:24:31] study teaching and
[1:24:34] preaching amen tithes offerings and
[1:24:36] missions and
[1:24:38] uh uh and whatever it is because uh yeah
[1:24:42] we've been talking about this me and
[1:24:45] Barberry like being the
[1:24:47] treasurer it's good that uh I'm not
[1:24:51] saying that it's not good if it comes
[1:24:52] from a pastor to to preach on ties and
[1:24:54] offerings but typically it's a it's a
[1:24:57] subject that is a little bit uh touchy
[1:25:00] because they might think the pastor
[1:25:02] wanted the money right no no it's it's a
[1:25:06] commandment of the Lord amen and uh just
[1:25:09] with a little gift that is that he placs
[1:25:11] in us I put uh good uh good verses or
[1:25:17] all the verses are good amen and uh they
[1:25:19] are inspired and uh we have also the
[1:25:22] quotes from bar Branham and it will be a
[1:25:25] a good uh way to to do this as a study
[1:25:30] so it will be a two two parts wherever
[1:25:33] we finish I don't want to take lots of
[1:25:35] time because I have only one hour and uh
[1:25:37] we have presentation so we can continue
[1:25:40] if I won't finish amen so please stand
[1:25:42] to your feet Let's uh read
[1:25:46] the Proverbs 3 9 to8 for the sake of
[1:25:50] time uh I already put the the script
[1:25:54] ures right so that uh it will be we
[1:25:58] don't waste time Proverbs 3:9-10 King
[1:26:01] James version honor the Lord with thy
[1:26:04] substance and with the first fruits of
[1:26:06] the all thine
[1:26:08] increase so shall thy barns be filled
[1:26:12] with plenty and thy pressence shall
[1:26:14] burst out with new wine let's bow our
[1:26:18] hearts oh Lord Jesus want to thank you
[1:26:21] for the reading of your word Lord may
[1:26:23] you reach it that it will be a benefit
[1:26:27] for the hearers including myself I just
[1:26:29] want to put myself out of out of the way
[1:26:32] so that you can uh you can use me
[1:26:35] completely oh God we love you we adore
[1:26:38] you we glorify your name in Jesus
[1:26:40] Christ's name we ask it amen you may be
[1:26:42] seated amen
[1:26:45] so Proverbs 3:9-10
[1:26:48] amen you can see my
[1:26:52] title uh for this part is giving as an
[1:26:55] act of worship honoring God with our
[1:26:58] substance but then at first we know
[1:27:00] giving giving but then what is worship
[1:27:03] we always say even in the prayers we
[1:27:07] worship worship worship amen so by
[1:27:11] definition Noah Webster 1828 dictionary
[1:27:15] so I want to use uh this dictionary as
[1:27:19] well because uh because it looks like
[1:27:22] language evolves so but uh at the same
[1:27:27] time uh we want to go with the original
[1:27:30] as much as possible amen so definition
[1:27:34] it's a noun because in this Con in this
[1:27:37] context it is used as a noun but uh
[1:27:39] worship is also a verb amen so chiefly
[1:27:43] and eminently the act of paying Divine
[1:27:47] honors to the Supreme Being paying okay
[1:27:51] I emphasize paying because we pay tithes
[1:27:55] we although BR Bram all the scriptures
[1:27:57] say give tithes but uh we pay because
[1:28:00] it's not ours we owe the Lord amen or
[1:28:04] the
[1:28:05] reverence and homemade paid to him again
[1:28:09] again paying so it's a sacrifice when
[1:28:11] you're paying it's a sacrifice Amen in
[1:28:13] religious exercises consisting in
[1:28:17] adoration
[1:28:18] confession prayer Thanksgiving and the
[1:28:22] like amen so you can can see amen uh
[1:28:26] worship is a
[1:28:29] profound Act of aligning ourselves with
[1:28:32] the
[1:28:33] Divine expressing love adoration and
[1:28:37] admission to God what does that mean we
[1:28:41] align
[1:28:43] ourselves with the Lord we align with
[1:28:46] what the Lord means the word we align
[1:28:49] with the word and then not only aligning
[1:28:54] we have to express it so that's why what
[1:28:57] we did love offering for the Philippines
[1:28:59] is an expression of love of God through
[1:29:03] us so that we can you know through our
[1:29:06] little Financial uh contributions we
[1:29:09] were able to help other people
[1:29:11] especially the bride there amen so it
[1:29:16] transcends goes beyond physical actions
[1:29:21] amen as it originates from the heart
[1:29:24] amen which is where the soul lives or
[1:29:28] where the soul is located by Bram is
[1:29:29] saying to our mind which is our spirit
[1:29:34] so from inside out so it's so when it is
[1:29:38] expressed we already know that we are
[1:29:40] aligned according to the word amen so
[1:29:44] the biblical
[1:29:45] Foundation uh of worship this is this is
[1:29:48] a foundation amen he described it in uh
[1:29:51] John
[1:29:53] 42324 for us worshiping in spirit and in
[1:29:56] truth amen emphasizing what sincerity
[1:30:00] and alignment with God's word so we
[1:30:04] that's why bar Bram is saying help me to
[1:30:06] be more sincere imagine a prophet saying
[1:30:08] that amen how about us are we are we
[1:30:13] sincere enough to to to to focus on God
[1:30:17] Amen so you can say it places God at the
[1:30:22] center
[1:30:24] glorifying his
[1:30:26] attributes will and works what are his
[1:30:29] attributes he's God he's an object of
[1:30:31] worship he's a provider he's a he's a
[1:30:34] Healer all those attributes we we
[1:30:37] glorify his attributes amen because we
[1:30:39] we believe that he's God Amen and the
[1:30:42] good thing also is this is worship is a
[1:30:45] way of life what does that mean is not
[1:30:48] limited to rituals of church services
[1:30:51] amen it involves living in obedience
[1:30:54] and love towards God not
[1:30:57] only every week but daily amen every
[1:31:01] minute every hour of our our being we
[1:31:04] need to dedicate it for worship that's
[1:31:06] what he wanted the reason why we come
[1:31:09] here together is to worship Him amen and
[1:31:12] there are forms of worship individual
[1:31:14] worship Prayer by yourself right because
[1:31:17] uh it's a personal relationship with the
[1:31:19] Lord we need that we meditate and we
[1:31:23] need to study the word amen uh personal
[1:31:25] Bible study is a it's an individual
[1:31:28] worship but we can have also group
[1:31:30] worship or Collective one which is we do
[1:31:32] prayer meetings congregational singing
[1:31:35] the sermons preaching what we do to here
[1:31:37] it's a group worship but the lifestyle
[1:31:40] worship is the is the important ones
[1:31:42] because we only have two Services every
[1:31:44] week but the lifestyle we need to
[1:31:47] reflect God's nature through our actions
[1:31:51] amen integrity
[1:31:54] and
[1:31:55] compassion and concern for others and
[1:31:57] we're so thankful we have this ability
[1:31:59] to to to to share not only financially
[1:32:03] but Also spiritually we are witnesses to
[1:32:06] our colleagues to our schoolmates to our
[1:32:09] classmates to our friends to our
[1:32:10] families let's not go very far because
[1:32:13] our families they might not be believing
[1:32:16] yet or serving the lord now but they are
[1:32:18] our
[1:32:19] promises there we don't need to worry
[1:32:22] amen amen
[1:32:25] so so worship it's a foundation right uh
[1:32:29] it seeks a relationship with the
[1:32:31] Creator personal relationship with the
[1:32:34] Creator that's why what's the new birth
[1:32:37] is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:32:40] to you personally amen it's a
[1:32:42] relationship with the Creator which is
[1:32:44] the Lord himself engaging both the heart
[1:32:47] which is our Soul and Spirit which is
[1:32:50] the mind to glorify him be be Beyond the
[1:32:54] human comprehension so there's a
[1:32:56] supernatural in it amen worship is
[1:32:59] Supernatural it's spiritual amen so in
[1:33:02] essence true worship flows from
[1:33:05] acknowledging God's Supremacy so when
[1:33:08] you acknowledge that God is supreme
[1:33:09] Sovereign is God is everything then we
[1:33:13] express that
[1:33:14] acknowledgment through every aspect of
[1:33:16] Our Lives that's why every fiber of our
[1:33:19] being must be towards the worship of God
[1:33:23] Amen
[1:33:24] so that's that's the introduction for
[1:33:28] this or you can say uh so when we talk
[1:33:32] about uh
[1:33:35] uh bear with me
[1:33:37] here Proverbs 39
[1:33:44] to10
[1:33:48] okay
[1:33:49] so what what the scripture is saying
[1:33:53] here is
[1:33:55] honor the Lord with thy substance what's
[1:33:58] what does that mean substance
[1:34:01] means material
[1:34:03] possessions amen wealth or blessings
[1:34:06] received from God any blessings that is
[1:34:09] any blessing that is received from God
[1:34:11] is our substance amen including our time
[1:34:15] everything that uh that that
[1:34:17] it's under our
[1:34:20] control amen anything that's beyond our
[1:34:22] control that's different that's
[1:34:24] spiritual we cannot do anything but
[1:34:26] anything that is under our control right
[1:34:28] it's it it can be considered as
[1:34:30] substance first fruits symbolizes the
[1:34:35] very first and best portion of one's
[1:34:37] income or harvest first fruits so it
[1:34:40] means when we receive our salary for
[1:34:43] example we give tights immediately we
[1:34:45] don't need to wait right which is uh you
[1:34:48] can say that's the first fruits because
[1:34:50] uh we thank the Lord for for giving that
[1:34:53] or even
[1:34:54] because uh in the Old Testament titing
[1:34:56] is also about their uh what they harvest
[1:35:01] right uh they they tight on their on
[1:35:04] anything if you baram is saying if you
[1:35:06] have 10 apples the nine will be uh for
[1:35:10] for you and the 10th is for the Levites
[1:35:12] which is for the priests uh in in the
[1:35:15] Old Testament amen and uh it's the same
[1:35:17] for us right now which we
[1:35:19] don't we are mostly uh employed here so
[1:35:23] that's why we put tithes in the form of
[1:35:25] money amen and that's the the medium of
[1:35:29] exchange amen so that's uh that's the
[1:35:32] first fruits and it's an acknowledgement
[1:35:35] that all provision comes from the Lord
[1:35:38] when we Believers Place God first our
[1:35:42] Act of Faith and obedience opens the way
[1:35:45] for His blessings to overflow in our
[1:35:49] lives right acknowledging that that's
[1:35:52] why these are basic principles but very
[1:35:54] important ones that's why I'm
[1:35:56] uh I'm being slow with them I hope
[1:35:59] you're okay so that we can at least uh
[1:36:02] uh you know uh feed feed on it
[1:36:08] amen so when we give God the
[1:36:12] best he gives you the best in
[1:36:14] return I think you for those who are I
[1:36:19] I'm I'm trying to encourage everyone
[1:36:21] even the small kids uh or or the
[1:36:24] children that uh whatever you receive
[1:36:26] it's an increase that is an increase to
[1:36:29] you you should tight it and or or Pro
[1:36:33] give an offering although you might not
[1:36:35] uh uh be filing your taxes no problem
[1:36:40] but God will bless you abundantly and
[1:36:42] it's a start I know you're already doing
[1:36:44] it but it's an encouragement it starts
[1:36:47] from small and and when we think about
[1:36:49] it oh I have a $100 I will give 10 how
[1:36:53] about how about if you have 1,000 you
[1:36:54] will give 100 right how about if you
[1:36:56] have 100,000 you have 10,000 so it means
[1:36:59] it's relative it's
[1:37:00] 10% God is only asking 10 the government
[1:37:04] is asking 30 or even more amen amen
[1:37:07] aren't we
[1:37:09] thankful and uh yeah I hope you'll be
[1:37:12] with me and you'll not hate me after
[1:37:19] amen I'm just your brother here and
[1:37:22] putting the things to together and you
[1:37:24] know we are when we give God the best he
[1:37:28] gives us the best in return this aligns
[1:37:31] with Proverbs 39:10 as it reflects the
[1:37:33] concept of giving wants first and best
[1:37:37] which is the first fruits to God
[1:37:40] resulting in Divine favor and provision
[1:37:42] you see when when we give our tithes he
[1:37:45] will take care of the rest amen we don't
[1:37:47] need to worry at all
[1:37:49] amen we are stewards of what God has
[1:37:55] given us and the way we handle what he
[1:37:58] puts in our care shows our faith and
[1:38:01] reverence for him so so if if if we have
[1:38:06] faith of God in us and we want to follow
[1:38:09] his commandment then you know and we
[1:38:12] love him then we will obey his
[1:38:13] Commandments amen so what's the the
[1:38:16] application uh of worship in in in our
[1:38:20] daily lives material giving bar Branham
[1:38:23] uh of and encourage us amen Believers to
[1:38:25] tight and give offerings with a joyful
[1:38:27] heart amen trusting God to meet their
[1:38:30] needs amen and even the time and talents
[1:38:33] beyond beyond Financial giving we should
[1:38:37] offer our
[1:38:38] time it's a it's a valuable you can say
[1:38:41] commodity because time will pass but
[1:38:43] then we're if if we if we procrastinate
[1:38:46] you can say right in doing things so it
[1:38:49] means it's not only our money it's also
[1:38:51] our time so do we we have 24 hours in a
[1:38:54] day so that means 10% is 2.4
[1:38:58] hours are we dedicating it to the Lord
[1:39:01] amen I'm guilty forgive me Lord amen two
[1:39:05] and half two two and a half hours a day
[1:39:08] that's what he needed from us right our
[1:39:11] time
[1:39:13] amen so God's blessing and
[1:39:16] multiplication right he brother Bram
[1:39:19] thought that uh God honors faithfulness
[1:39:21] by multiplying blessings
[1:39:23] in ways that go beyond material wealth
[1:39:26] open resulting in spiritual joy and
[1:39:29] satisfaction which symbolizes the new
[1:39:32] wine you can see the joy The Joy that's
[1:39:37] uh with this verse is uh burst out with
[1:39:40] new wine
[1:39:42] right wine represents the stimulation of
[1:39:46] Revelation so with new wine did you
[1:39:49] realize when something is revealed to
[1:39:51] you you're so happy oh not only happy
[1:39:54] you're so joyful that oh Lord why did
[1:39:57] you reveal this to me and I'm so
[1:39:58] thankful unto
[1:40:00] you we're blessed we we're feeding on
[1:40:03] the revealed word brothers and sisters
[1:40:05] so that's why that's so important amen
[1:40:08] so let's go with the the next one uh
[1:40:11] these are basic things that you might
[1:40:13] already know and we might have already
[1:40:16] preached before right so so the the the
[1:40:20] origin of uh tights titing and offer
[1:40:23] uffing a
[1:40:24] amen bear with me here my uh my notes
[1:40:29] okay so Genesis
[1:40:32] 14-20 and Genesis 4
[1:40:36] 4-5 you can see this is the these are
[1:40:39] the first scriptures where tights and
[1:40:41] offerings were mentioned in Genesis
[1:40:44] 14:20 and blessed be the most high God
[1:40:48] which had delivered thine enemies into
[1:40:50] thy hand and he gave him tits of all
[1:40:54] this is the sto story of Abraham right
[1:40:57] giving or paying tits to melkisedek you
[1:41:00] you can read the Genesis 14 it's
[1:41:02] beautiful so titing it appears first in
[1:41:06] 14:20 and you can see Abraham P ties to
[1:41:09] melkisedek even before the law there's
[1:41:12] no law before that right because the law
[1:41:15] was given to Moses right for the law was
[1:41:18] given under Moses showing a precedent
[1:41:20] for honoring God with resources so you
[1:41:22] can see he gave he paid tights he gave
[1:41:26] him tights of all of all the spoils
[1:41:28] after the war after the the war with the
[1:41:31] with with
[1:41:33] the I forgot uh yeah anyway so after the
[1:41:39] war he gave all the the spoils amen so
[1:41:41] that's the first
[1:41:43] instance right uh of where tits
[1:41:46] was was mentioned amen how about
[1:41:49] offerings Genesis 44-5 and Abel
[1:41:54] he also brought of the firstlings of his
[1:41:57] plaque and of the fat thereof and the
[1:42:00] Lord had respect unto Abel and to his
[1:42:03] offering but unto Cain and to his
[1:42:06] offering he had not respect and Cain was
[1:42:09] very wroth and his counter countenance
[1:42:11] fell so you can see the Lord gives us an
[1:42:14] example right in the lives of Cain and
[1:42:16] Abel in the area of bringing their
[1:42:19] offerings unto the Lord but uh even
[1:42:22] though uh both children brought
[1:42:25] offerings unto the Lord God had pleasure
[1:42:27] in Abel because it was done in the
[1:42:30] spirit of Revelation so you see yeah
[1:42:34] we're living in the revealed word that's
[1:42:35] why everything that we do it must align
[1:42:37] with the word revealed word for our day
[1:42:40] amen we don't feed on on the word of
[1:42:43] Noah or word of Moses although they
[1:42:46] might be applicable but they are shadows
[1:42:48] and types amen and for us we have the
[1:42:51] revealed world that's why
[1:42:53] we should know or or why we believe this
[1:42:56] way because it's a revealed thing to us
[1:43:00] we cannot force anyone to be a believer
[1:43:02] of this message but we're not Cults we
[1:43:06] believe this message which is Christ in
[1:43:07] us the hope of glory so we believe the
[1:43:09] Bible in its entirety the full word we
[1:43:13] don't follow a man we follow the god
[1:43:15] that is in that man amen amen so okay so
[1:43:20] it's a combination of teaching and
[1:43:22] preaching forgive me but but uh at least
[1:43:24] uh it's good that uh we can we can have
[1:43:28] solid foundation why we do what we do
[1:43:30] why we pay tights why we give offerings
[1:43:32] because it's the Commandment of the Lord
[1:43:34] amen tight means it's a tent of one's
[1:43:38] income dedicated to
[1:43:41] God Amen and it's derived from Strong's
[1:43:44] number Hebrews 46 43 age it's it's a
[1:43:49] Hebrew because it's in the Old Testament
[1:43:51] and when you see those strong numbers
[1:43:53] because the Old Testament was written in
[1:43:55] Hebrew and uh if it's in the New
[1:43:58] Testament they use G which is Greek
[1:44:00] right uh so it it is meser masar or M
[1:44:06] mahra it means 10th part or tight okay
[1:44:11] and offering it's a gift it's a gift
[1:44:15] given beyond the tight reflecting
[1:44:19] gratitude and love so it means it's
[1:44:21] beyond the titing so 10% is tight
[1:44:23] anything that you give beyond the tight
[1:44:25] it's called offerings whether it can be
[1:44:27] on missions but sometimes it's uh it's
[1:44:31] how you interpret because missions is
[1:44:33] apostil ship and it's F part of
[1:44:35] five-fold ministry that's why missions
[1:44:38] you can see go you're you're spreading
[1:44:40] the gospel that's why it can be part of
[1:44:44] uh of the tiing because uh you know it's
[1:44:46] for ministry right but then however it
[1:44:50] is it doesn't matter in the face of the
[1:44:52] CRA it's all donations but for us we
[1:44:55] follow the word of the Lord and the word
[1:44:57] of the Prophet that's why we we put them
[1:44:59] we set them aside amen so it is derived
[1:45:03] from the Strong's number AIDS
[1:45:07] 4503 which uh which is pronounced Mina
[1:45:11] and it's called the gift Tri tribute or
[1:45:14] offering amen so you can see uh those
[1:45:18] are the foundations amen so let's go
[1:45:21] start with the with some uh scriptures
[1:45:25] here about tithing and offerings so this
[1:45:30] first Foundation is everything belongs
[1:45:32] to God Amen Psalm 241 the Earth is the
[1:45:36] Lord's and the fullness
[1:45:39] thereof the world and they means
[1:45:43] us that dwell therein so it means we all
[1:45:46] belong to the Lord so if we belong to
[1:45:49] the Lord anything that we own Belongs to
[1:45:50] the Lord amen the whole earth Belongs to
[1:45:54] the Lord and in Hagi 2:8 the silver is
[1:45:57] mine and the gold is mine said the Lord
[1:46:00] of H so everything belongs to God so
[1:46:04] let's not hold lightly or or hold
[1:46:06] tightly we should hold lightly because
[1:46:08] it doesn't belong to us anyway we're
[1:46:10] just stewards we have to distribute what
[1:46:13] we have been given to us amen we don't
[1:46:17] we we don't
[1:46:19] uh only feed on ourselves that's the
[1:46:22] reason why we have also Fellowship we
[1:46:24] want to be blessed that's why we you
[1:46:26] know we we invite people so that we can
[1:46:28] Feist on together right it's a sacrifice
[1:46:32] but who are you feeding it's the Lord in
[1:46:34] that bride in the Lord on that brother
[1:46:36] and sister that you're feeding that's
[1:46:38] why it's a
[1:46:39] blessing amen because everything belongs
[1:46:41] to God and the good thing also all
[1:46:44] things come from God you can
[1:46:46] see in this
[1:46:49] scripture 1 Chronicles 29 14 but who am
[1:46:54] I and what is my people this is David
[1:46:57] speaking that we should be able to offer
[1:47:01] so willingly after this sword for all
[1:47:05] things all things come of thee or come
[1:47:08] from thee and of thine own have we given
[1:47:11] thee so King David's recognition that
[1:47:16] everything given to God including your
[1:47:19] tithes offerings Mission comes from what
[1:47:21] he already
[1:47:23] owns amen he already owned it before and
[1:47:27] he's only asking for what he it is his
[1:47:30] and he's so gracious he only has 10% for
[1:47:33] tithes and whatever if you're a cheerful
[1:47:36] Giver then you can give more that will
[1:47:37] be considered offerings
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:41] okay so this is a a very popular
[1:47:45] scripture but then also we have to think
[1:47:48] of it spiritually also because this
[1:47:52] verse can be a blessing but also a
[1:47:56] curse amen we're not trying to pull
[1:47:59] money or something this is the scripture
[1:48:01] it's not even ours right it's the Lord's
[1:48:04] Malachi
[1:48:05] 37-12 let we should not only reading 310
[1:48:09] which is about titing but then even
[1:48:12] before that and after that so that we
[1:48:14] can really identify that it's important
[1:48:17] to follow God's
[1:48:19] word align ourselves in God's word and
[1:48:23] express it we just don't align and then
[1:48:26] that's it you walk no there is an action
[1:48:28] after it
[1:48:30] amen so let's read it amen even from the
[1:48:36] days of your
[1:48:37] fathers I don't know if you can read it
[1:48:40] hopefully you can
[1:48:43] amen ye are gone away from mine
[1:48:47] ordinances and have not kept them return
[1:48:51] unto me and I will return unto you said
[1:48:55] the Lord of hosts but ye said wherein
[1:48:58] shall we
[1:49:00] return and then a question will a man
[1:49:04] rob
[1:49:05] God yet ye have robbed me but ye say
[1:49:09] wherein have we robbed thee in tights
[1:49:12] and offerings so it's so clear brothers
[1:49:15] and sisters tights and offerings ye are
[1:49:18] cursed with a curse for ye have robbed
[1:49:22] me even this whole nation robbery theft
[1:49:27] that's one of the Ten Commandments right
[1:49:30] Thou shalt not steal so we're stealing
[1:49:32] from God if we don't pay our tithes and
[1:49:35] offerings amen let's
[1:49:39] continue but we are not like
[1:49:42] denominational Christians that only pull
[1:49:44] money that's why they're putting this
[1:49:46] ass against the Believers or or their
[1:49:48] congregation right but for us we're
[1:49:51] trying to put it in a scriptural way so
[1:49:54] that we will be taught that there is a
[1:49:55] foundation but once it's revealed to you
[1:49:58] you will see the
[1:50:00] benefits amen so we're so thankful
[1:50:05] amen so this is the popular scripture
[1:50:09] bring ye all the tights into the
[1:50:11] storehouse that there be that there may
[1:50:14] be meat in mine house and prove me now
[1:50:18] here with said the Lord of host if I
[1:50:20] will not open you the windows of heaven
[1:50:23] and pour you out a blessing that there
[1:50:26] shall not be room enough to receive it
[1:50:28] so
[1:50:30] blessing that's a blessing if you apply
[1:50:33] it you will you will benefit from it but
[1:50:36] don't just apply it because so that I'll
[1:50:38] be blessed it's just automatic the the
[1:50:40] main point there is you're obeying the
[1:50:42] Commandment of the Lord you believe the
[1:50:44] Commandment that's why you
[1:50:46] obey right it's not that uh oh I want to
[1:50:49] pay Tis so that I will be blessed no
[1:50:52] that's not it you love the Lord that's
[1:50:54] why you do it amen and I will rebuke the
[1:50:58] Devourer for your
[1:51:00] sakes and she he shall not destroy the
[1:51:03] fruits of your ground neither shall your
[1:51:06] Vine cast her fruit before the time in
[1:51:09] the field said the Lord of hosts but the
[1:51:11] number 12 you see here and all nations
[1:51:15] shall call you blessed for you shall be
[1:51:19] a delightsome land said the Lord of
[1:51:21] hosts aren't we thankful brother and
[1:51:24] sisters if if we hold tightly then God
[1:51:27] will also hold tightly on His blessings
[1:51:29] unto us but we if we will hold lightly
[1:51:32] then the blessings Will Will just
[1:51:35] overflow it's so important brothers and
[1:51:37] sisters Amen to to to understand this I
[1:51:42] have a lot of quotes uh after this
[1:51:47] so these are questions that are we we we
[1:51:52] don't want to scare people but uh you
[1:51:54] know but we have a Vindicated Prophet
[1:51:57] that just opened our eyes of
[1:52:00] understanding and there was a question
[1:52:03] here does a Christian not get to heaven
[1:52:06] because they don't not they do not pay
[1:52:10] tith and what did he answer I could not
[1:52:14] say yes or
[1:52:16] no to that but I do believe that every
[1:52:20] Christian is obligated to pay TI thingss
[1:52:23] because it's a commandment of the
[1:52:26] lord we are born to follow or obey the
[1:52:30] Commandments of the Lord amen that they
[1:52:33] may have a right
[1:52:36] imagine to enter into the life the tree
[1:52:39] of life so it means when you're
[1:52:40] following the Commandment of the Lord
[1:52:42] you you have the right to enter because
[1:52:44] you're not withdraw uh withholding
[1:52:46] anything from him amen now I do believe
[1:52:49] that tight paying is essential to a
[1:52:52] Christian experience for I'll get to
[1:52:55] that in another question in a few
[1:52:56] moments I know there's another one
[1:52:58] pertaining to that he said let's
[1:53:04] continue but you know I feel like
[1:53:08] this that a member of a church their
[1:53:12] first obligation is with their tith and
[1:53:15] offerings first obligation brothers and
[1:53:17] sisters is to to support their Church
[1:53:22] if you are members of These Fine
[1:53:24] churches that's represented here you
[1:53:27] support your church that's your first
[1:53:30] duty to God bring your tithe and
[1:53:33] offerings into the
[1:53:36] storehouse and the
[1:53:38] storehouse this not my words I'm just
[1:53:41] quoting not parting parting means you
[1:53:44] don't understand but we understand it
[1:53:45] with Revelation amen and the storehouse
[1:53:48] you surely know what it that is is where
[1:53:51] you get your food
[1:53:53] yeah so there is where you get your
[1:53:55] spiritual food and your
[1:53:58] obligation is your church and not to an
[1:54:02] evangelist like me so it's brother
[1:54:04] Branham
[1:54:05] saying you don't pay the Evangelist here
[1:54:08] although he's paid us with love offering
[1:54:10] but we don't pay our tis there because
[1:54:12] it doesn't belong to
[1:54:14] him amen but it it will be uh he will be
[1:54:18] paid according to the tight uh donations
[1:54:21] that we have because it's part of the
[1:54:22] Ministry but we don't pay our tights to
[1:54:24] that evangelist or whoever that will
[1:54:27] come right but if if if you give him
[1:54:30] that's an an offering bar Bram is saying
[1:54:33] here tight belongs to the church and
[1:54:35] it's God's in in this assembly amen
[1:54:38] where where you're feeding where you're
[1:54:40] a member amen just you
[1:54:45] know and your obligation is to your
[1:54:48] church and not to an evangelist like me
[1:54:52] it's taken up somewhere along in the
[1:54:54] meetings when we have campaigns like
[1:54:56] this where you have a little laying
[1:54:57] aside to help support it that takes care
[1:55:00] of me he said so because he he was the
[1:55:02] one talking about it amen uh and he said
[1:55:06] I won't accept your tithes because you
[1:55:09] know I'm not your pastor right so
[1:55:12] something like that so and uh you put
[1:55:15] your tights in in in in in our bank here
[1:55:18] which is the Bank of Heaven Calgary
[1:55:20] Living Word assembly because because you
[1:55:22] belong to this
[1:55:24] church
[1:55:31] amen some
[1:55:33] more good
[1:55:35] stuff so I put the question there why
[1:55:38] did melis sedc receive tights imagine
[1:55:43] melis
[1:55:44] sedc let's read it
[1:55:47] I I it's so good what would a man take
[1:55:52] titing for he's talking about milk's
[1:55:54] deck if he had if he never was born and
[1:55:59] never will die and was from beginning to
[1:56:02] end and never had no father or mother or
[1:56:07] descent and own the whole heavens and
[1:56:09] earth and all in it why would he take
[1:56:14] tight amen it's a good question right
[1:56:17] it's just like why would God he
[1:56:20] everything he owns
[1:56:22] you know everything belongs to him why
[1:56:24] would he need our tithing why would he
[1:56:26] need our offering amen you can
[1:56:30] see why would he ask Abraham to pay
[1:56:34] tights you see what a strict thing it is
[1:56:37] to pay
[1:56:39] tights because it's a
[1:56:41] commandment right it's a strict thing
[1:56:44] titing is right every
[1:56:47] Christian is dy is Duty bound to pay
[1:56:50] tight that's right never has has been
[1:56:52] changed it's from the Old Testament and
[1:56:54] it's even in the New Testament that's
[1:56:57] why we practice it it's not because we
[1:56:58] follow other churches that are you know
[1:57:01] established before us but it's in the in
[1:57:03] in in the
[1:57:04] scripture
[1:57:05] now paragraph 124 as I may so say Levi
[1:57:11] also who received tight paid tights in
[1:57:14] Abraham I know I already preached a
[1:57:16] little bit of this but then let's go
[1:57:17] into detail about it amen now oh 125
[1:57:21] here is something
[1:57:22] for he was yet in the loin of his father
[1:57:26] when melchisedek met him so it's Abraham
[1:57:30] who paid tis but it's accounted for Levi
[1:57:34] so let's read more because uh I want to
[1:57:37] encourage on what we do we're talking
[1:57:40] about the third and fourth generation
[1:57:42] that's the punch line there but then the
[1:57:44] thing is somebody Beyond us or I mean
[1:57:47] before us three or four generations
[1:57:49] praying and serving the lord and then we
[1:57:51] are are here now sitting in this church
[1:57:55] November 17th
[1:57:56] 2024 right and how about what we're
[1:57:59] doing in the next third and fourth
[1:58:02] generation amen so what
[1:58:06] Levi Abraham was Levi's great great
[1:58:09] grandpa and the Bible said here that
[1:58:12] Levi paid tis when he was in the Lo of
[1:58:16] Abraham four
[1:58:18] generations before he ever come to Earth
[1:58:21] he was paid K tights to
[1:58:23] melkisedek blessed be the name of the
[1:58:26] Lord then you that can't believe in
[1:58:29] predestination thank the lord it's so
[1:58:31] clear to us we're predestinated because
[1:58:33] we are elected amen or for ordination
[1:58:38] and here four generations before Levi
[1:58:41] would ever come out of the loins of
[1:58:43] Abraham was paying tights to
[1:58:46] madc wish we had time to run this
[1:58:48] through through the scripture brother
[1:58:50] Bram was saying
[1:58:55] verse
[1:58:57] 128 if you'd take it over to like in
[1:59:00] Jeremiah
[1:59:01] 1:4 Jeremiah
[1:59:05] 1:4 God said I knew you before you was
[1:59:08] even formed in your mother's
[1:59:11] womb he's talking about Jeremiah being a
[1:59:14] prophet same for br Branham the Lord
[1:59:18] knew him that he's a prophet even before
[1:59:20] the before the the world ever began and
[1:59:23] even us we're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:59:27] predestinated for ordained predestinated
[1:59:29] to be the bride because we accepted the
[1:59:31] full word not partial word amen not the
[1:59:34] word of any man but the word of the Lord
[1:59:36] amen through the Vindicated Prophet I
[1:59:40] knew you before you was even formed in
[1:59:42] your mother's womb and I Sanctified you
[1:59:46] and ordained you a prophet to the
[1:59:48] Nations then what can you say that you
[1:59:52] did you cannot Merit the kingdom
[1:59:56] amen wherefore ordained it's by his
[1:59:59] election elective love because he knew
[2:00:03] that we will accept him even before the
[2:00:05] foundation of the world it's not our
[2:00:09] works of righteousness amen but by his
[2:00:12] grace alone what can I say that I did
[2:00:15] it's God that showeth
[2:00:17] mercy God knew us before the foundation
[2:00:20] of the world Amen
[2:00:22] predestination oh what an important
[2:00:25] concept amen of what we believe why we
[2:00:27] believe what we believe because it's
[2:00:29] already in the word and it's been
[2:00:31] revealed to us amen he not
[2:00:34] willingly that any should
[2:00:40] perish paragraph
[2:00:42] 129 certainly not but if is God he knew
[2:00:48] who would be saved and who wouldn't be
[2:00:50] saved or or he didn't know anything
[2:00:53] that's why we don't need to worry this
[2:00:55] is rest for us brothers and sisters we
[2:00:57] know we're trying to do God a
[2:00:59] service sometimes right especially when
[2:01:02] our children are not serving oh I will
[2:01:05] send you back to Philippines oh I will
[2:01:07] send you back to Africa right we've been
[2:01:10] talking so that you will you will be in
[2:01:12] line but what even in Philippines they
[2:01:15] have cellphones right even in Africa
[2:01:17] they have cell phon wherever you go
[2:01:20] right it's a rest for us amen that uh if
[2:01:23] God says uh said it in his word It's
[2:01:26] Already Done Deal we should just let go
[2:01:28] and let God
[2:01:30] Amen we cannot do anything amen uh to
[2:01:34] Merit it it's unmerited Grace that's why
[2:01:37] that's that's his his Mercy he be if he
[2:01:40] didn't know if he didn't know who would
[2:01:43] make the Rapture before the world was
[2:01:45] ever formed then he's not God
[2:01:48] right if he's
[2:01:50] infinite he knows every flee every fly
[2:01:54] every louse every that would
[2:01:57] ever be on the earth before the Earth
[2:01:59] was ever formed that's right he knew all
[2:02:03] things before the foundation of the
[2:02:05] world he knew us the Bible said that he
[2:02:08] knew us and predestinated US does God
[2:02:12] know you this morning amen do you know
[2:02:15] God Amen we we're thankful on on this uh
[2:02:19] uh when we have the chance to to feed on
[2:02:22] this word
[2:02:24] amen so talking about the
[2:02:29] iniquity because once you do the
[2:02:31] Commandments of the Lord is a blessing
[2:02:33] but once you don't do it it's also a
[2:02:35] curse so that's why he's a fair God you
[2:02:39] know God's nature is also a just God
[2:02:42] Amen he but for us being the bride we
[2:02:45] are already being judged right now
[2:02:48] because we will sit in the white Throne
[2:02:50] judgment judging the whole thing
[2:02:52] amen and we will be sitting in his
[2:02:54] throne right so we're blessed that's why
[2:02:58] when when you accept the message of the
[2:03:00] hour which is the the message for this
[2:03:02] day you you you're already being judged
[2:03:05] according to the word of God being the
[2:03:07] bride we are special class of people we
[2:03:10] we we know there are other people there
[2:03:13] that will that will be in
[2:03:16] heaven that will be saved because
[2:03:18] salvation is a big thing but Redemption
[2:03:21] is a little bit different because we
[2:03:23] belong to God that's why we're redeemed
[2:03:25] and transformation is also different
[2:03:28] right and and translation is also
[2:03:30] different because the bride will be the
[2:03:32] only one that will be raptured for for
[2:03:36] this day amen for our for our age amen
[2:03:39] the bride age it's only the bride those
[2:03:41] who will not make it they will suffer
[2:03:43] tribulation like the foolish virgins bar
[2:03:45] branam is saying but they will die
[2:03:48] according to their works and their their
[2:03:51] sacrifice and uh they will accept later
[2:03:53] on Jesus Christ during the tribulation
[2:03:56] but for us we're already gone we are
[2:03:58] already in glory with the Lord amen we
[2:04:00] we're having our three and a half years
[2:04:02] of uh of uh uh uh married supper amen
[2:04:07] we're thankful unto the
[2:04:10] Lord numbers 14:1
[2:04:13] 17-21 and
[2:04:15] now so we have time 15 minutes don't
[2:04:17] worry BR Joel you'll have time yeah amen
[2:04:20] and now I beit thee let the power of my
[2:04:23] Lord be great according as thou has
[2:04:25] spoken saying the Lord is long-suffering
[2:04:29] and of great Mercy forgiving
[2:04:32] iniquity and transgression and by no
[2:04:35] means clearing the
[2:04:37] guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[2:04:40] fathers upon the children unto the third
[2:04:43] and fourth
[2:04:44] generation this is kind of hard because
[2:04:47] in the Old Testament if you are a
[2:04:49] bastard child you cannot even enter
[2:04:52] the the congregation even to 10
[2:04:54] Generations I believe but uh with this
[2:04:56] is three and fourth generation pardon I
[2:04:59] beseech Thee the iniquity of this people
[2:05:02] according unto the greatness of thy
[2:05:04] mercy and as thou Hast forgiven this
[2:05:07] people from Egypt even until now but
[2:05:10] this is the the good
[2:05:12] stuff on verse 20 and the Lord said I
[2:05:17] have pardoned according to Thy
[2:05:20] word praise the Lord
[2:05:22] but as truly as I live all the Earth
[2:05:24] shall be filled with the glory of the
[2:05:26] Lord as are we not thankful brothers and
[2:05:29] sisters we are condemned by
[2:05:32] representation one man Adam of course
[2:05:36] with Eve right because Eve is part of
[2:05:38] Adam he was we we are condemned but one
[2:05:42] by one man
[2:05:45] also the blood of Jesus Christ amen the
[2:05:48] Lord that's why it's so important to
[2:05:50] understand that amen we are pardoned
[2:05:53] according to Thy word
[2:05:55] amen
[2:06:00] oh another
[2:06:06] one
[2:06:09] listen just to encourage you God is not
[2:06:12] concerned so much about your
[2:06:15] money but even before that just to
[2:06:18] finish about the third and fourth
[2:06:19] generation what we do today Brothers and
[2:06:22] sisters there will be beneficiary in the
[2:06:25] future we are beneficiaries of what our
[2:06:28] ancestors did for us we might not know
[2:06:32] maybe you can ask DNA test and whatever
[2:06:34] or or your ancestry.com whatever then
[2:06:37] you will find that somewhere before us
[2:06:41] we're praying and doing the will of the
[2:06:43] Lord and they're praying that their
[2:06:45] Generations or or their their future uh
[2:06:50] uh descendants will also be Christians
[2:06:52] amen and for us what we do today will
[2:06:56] also
[2:06:57] benefit our grand children Grand
[2:07:00] grandchildren and great great great
[2:07:02] grandchildren so it will be a continuous
[2:07:04] cycle it's it's like paying it forward
[2:07:07] what we receive now we're so blessed
[2:07:10] brothers and sisters beyond measure
[2:07:11] where where can you find good people
[2:07:13] like this only in the church right
[2:07:16] beautiful people that really loves the
[2:07:18] Lord and why would you not like or love
[2:07:21] this kind of uh life you don't drink you
[2:07:25] don't smoke you don't defile your body
[2:07:27] in any way although we're working
[2:07:29] progress everyone is but don't you want
[2:07:32] this kind of life when you are asked who
[2:07:34] would not want this right we're so
[2:07:37] blessed beyond
[2:07:39] measure oh brothers and sisters if if we
[2:07:42] if we can just make an inventory of what
[2:07:45] God has done to us that's why we BR
[2:07:50] brandom is saying whatever he he
[2:07:53] receives he he he give tis to the church
[2:07:55] he paid tight to the church but then
[2:07:58] he's not satisfied he wanted to give 90
[2:08:00] to the church and then take only 10 but
[2:08:02] the the government didn't allow him
[2:08:04] right but then the thing is look at that
[2:08:06] as an example to us right prove me we
[2:08:12] read the scripture prove me if I will
[2:08:14] not open the windows of Heaven for the
[2:08:16] blessings that you cannot
[2:08:19] contain if we are so
[2:08:22] uh faithful in doing that we know we
[2:08:25] have a lot of uh good people here amen
[2:08:28] that does that that's why we're blessed
[2:08:29] amen I'll include myself amen I'm I'm
[2:08:33] thankful that God blessed me abundantly
[2:08:35] Beyond even measure or Beyond even
[2:08:39] reasoning that God just who who would be
[2:08:44] who who would think that I will be here
[2:08:46] in Calgary I didn't even know that
[2:08:47] there's a place called Calgary in my
[2:08:49] life when I was in Philippines I know
[2:08:51] know that there's Canada but I didn't
[2:08:53] know that there's a beautiful place like
[2:08:54] Calgary but God put us here amen and
[2:08:57] we're so thankful amen so think of that
[2:09:00] brothers and sisters what you're doing
[2:09:02] today it might not benefit you right
[2:09:04] away but how about your future
[2:09:06] Generations your descendants your child
[2:09:08] your grandchild and so on if the Lord
[2:09:11] ties right then then then we will see it
[2:09:15] amen but uh maybe based on the condition
[2:09:19] of time there might not be a lot of time
[2:09:21] but then the thing is it's still a
[2:09:22] balance we cannot spir spiritualize
[2:09:25] everything that's why we have a session
[2:09:28] uh this afternoon right we we think of
[2:09:31] spiritual here but then we're also
[2:09:33] humans so how can we give if we don't
[2:09:36] have anything to give right so it's good
[2:09:39] to
[2:09:39] invest but think of the good Investments
[2:09:42] amen bar Branham already put there I
[2:09:45] think five Services he he put on
[2:09:46] investments just a Prelude spiritually
[2:09:49] but later on you will feed natur
[2:09:52] right spiritual we cannot spiritualize
[2:09:55] everything right but we need to be
[2:09:58] careful also Investments because uh
[2:10:00] investment means something that will
[2:10:02] grow okay it's not an overnight scheme
[2:10:05] that you will be rich overnight amen bar
[2:10:08] Bram is saying if you think that company
[2:10:10] will grow then invest in it put your
[2:10:13] faith in it right so you know but but we
[2:10:16] know money and even other currencies
[2:10:20] they will all disappear later on that's
[2:10:22] the reason why BR Branham is saying it
[2:10:24] will go back to Gold Standard right
[2:10:26] because all these things are manipulated
[2:10:28] Fiat money doesn't have any value you're
[2:10:30] only relying on what on the government
[2:10:33] that okay I will do you good because it
[2:10:35] will be taken from the people anyway how
[2:10:38] will we pay it through our taxes anyway
[2:10:41] that's why it's
[2:10:44] negotiable right when you have the money
[2:10:46] Canadian dollar when you put it they
[2:10:48] will you know exchange it with goods and
[2:10:50] services
[2:10:51] right because but you're it's not backed
[2:10:53] up by gold it's backed up by trust or a
[2:10:57] decree right by by the government saying
[2:11:00] oh this has a value of
[2:11:02] $100 but actually it doesn't mean
[2:11:04] anything because before it's on the gold
[2:11:05] standard but you cannot bring a one
[2:11:07] kilogram of gold that is worth let's say
[2:11:10] $2,500 right now because if you buy $1
[2:11:13] how could you cut the gold right so they
[2:11:15] put it simply to make it uh in a paper
[2:11:19] right so I'll call the musicians as I as
[2:11:22] I as I close but what I'm saying is
[2:11:28] Investments they are important amen but
[2:11:31] bar Branham also mentioned to us that
[2:11:33] invest in things that are
[2:11:35] Eternal when when when you invest in in
[2:11:39] in things that will grow physically you
[2:11:42] have the ability now to help the kingdom
[2:11:45] how by missions by your tithes by
[2:11:49] offerings right so there is a balance in
[2:11:51] everything you cannot Spirit
[2:11:53] spiritualize everything even anything
[2:11:56] that we do here in the church you cannot
[2:11:58] spiritualize everything there's always a
[2:12:00] natural and there's always spiritual so
[2:12:03] we have to balance ourselves so that
[2:12:05] we'll not be thinking that oh oh God
[2:12:08] will come tomorrow anyway so I will not
[2:12:10] work right people already took that so
[2:12:13] hoing potatoes if you know that God is
[2:12:15] coming tomorrow right you should still
[2:12:18] do it amen and that's balance in
[2:12:22] our in the in in the message that we
[2:12:26] receive we don't take a coat and then
[2:12:29] run away with it I've heard so many
[2:12:34] people Revelations 3 1 to three is for
[2:12:38] the church and he will come back on the
[2:12:39] 19th Revelation 19 right because the
[2:12:42] church is is done so they forget
[2:12:44] Revelations 4
[2:12:46] to8 amen but he preached Revelation 6
[2:12:51] the seals it's about the bride
[2:12:54] Revelations 10:7 it's about the prophet
[2:12:56] Mal so we we cannot get one one coat
[2:13:00] only and then rely or or or bet your
[2:13:03] your life on it you you should think of
[2:13:06] what the prophet is saying as a whole
[2:13:09] because the message is different before
[2:13:12] the message of the hour is on the table
[2:13:14] right now it's on your cell phone the
[2:13:17] older preachers they have books they
[2:13:19] will come with the you know lots of
[2:13:21] books when they preach we understand
[2:13:24] that because there's no nothing
[2:13:25] electronic before but now being the
[2:13:29] bride you can tell whether the preacher
[2:13:31] is saying the truth or not so you cannot
[2:13:33] teach the bride anymore but we need to
[2:13:36] be teachable what I'm saying is you
[2:13:38] cannot just think of your own
[2:13:40] denominational thinking and preach that
[2:13:42] that's correct because it is written in
[2:13:44] English especially with North America
[2:13:47] they understand English better than
[2:13:48] anyone so how could you teach
[2:13:51] the language right it's by Revelation so
[2:13:54] what I'm saying is the message is
[2:13:56] already it's in
[2:13:58] entirety right we don't put one coat and
[2:14:01] then run away with it and forget the
[2:14:03] other Coates right that's why
[2:14:06] everybody's thinking oh the seals are
[2:14:07] not open how how can you feed on a book
[2:14:10] that is not open and it's even in the
[2:14:13] scripture right
[2:14:15] so it's a it's a warning to us but not
[2:14:19] even a warning right it's a it's a
[2:14:23] reminder to us that uh we need to study
[2:14:26] the Bible and check what BR Branham said
[2:14:29] yeah we were we were fellowshipping with
[2:14:31] Barberry when I when I accepted the
[2:14:34] message we almost accepted the message
[2:14:36] same time 2005 or six I was in Qatar and
[2:14:40] by the way they have their 50th year
[2:14:42] anniversary in uh in uh in that church
[2:14:45] in in Philippines that's now the pastor
[2:14:48] is uh sister Carmen's son son but the
[2:14:52] previous Pastor was the one who baptized
[2:14:54] me and my wife so they started 50 years
[2:14:57] ago I didn't even know that they're 50
[2:14:59] years I'm golden also I'm 50 years old
[2:15:01] so I will remember that I'm so thankful
[2:15:04] that because of that small Church in
[2:15:07] 1974 accepted the message and it just
[2:15:11] imagine I accepted the message in a
[2:15:14] Muslim country witness which is a
[2:15:17] product of that church that witnessed to
[2:15:19] me and everything is history I'm so
[2:15:21] thankful that's what you call
[2:15:25] predestination for ordination from God
[2:15:28] we're so thankful brothers and sisters
[2:15:29] you see it's a different generation 1974
[2:15:32] that's the first generation maybe we're
[2:15:34] second or third but with that what we
[2:15:37] are part of it and you know it's
[2:15:40] important that whatever we give through
[2:15:44] missions like that you can say that uh
[2:15:47] they work in Qatar it's a Muslim country
[2:15:50] but they don't live there basically they
[2:15:52] they they work there for to make a
[2:15:54] living to support their family in the
[2:15:56] Philippines but there's a small Church
[2:15:58] there and that's where I I I knew the
[2:16:01] message I'm so thankful and then I I saw
[2:16:03] in the in in online that uh there're
[2:16:07] celebrating the 50th
[2:16:09] anniversary I'm so thankful brother Dano
[2:16:12] Bernardo was the one who baptized me and
[2:16:15] and and and my wife and and the son was
[2:16:18] the one witnessed to me for a year
[2:16:22] you know removing all the the impurities
[2:16:26] in me or you can say the the
[2:16:27] denominational thinking in me being a
[2:16:29] Catholic and uh being
[2:16:32] a an Evangelical that got baptized two
[2:16:35] times so when I was
[2:16:37] told you know acts 238 and then showing
[2:16:40] all the scriptures do you need to be
[2:16:42] baptized again the third time you will
[2:16:46] be you must be
[2:16:48] Gible so you have to prove brothers and
[2:16:50] sisters what I'm saying is what we have
[2:16:53] been given we need to be ready you know
[2:16:57] to be stewards right we're just stewards
[2:17:01] we manage what we are given amen it's
[2:17:03] not only for us the reason why he gave
[2:17:05] us more is because he knows that we know
[2:17:08] how to manage it so
[2:17:13] last the last uh slide and then we can
[2:17:17] sing are you happy this morning brothers
[2:17:20] and sisters I I I have a lot here but I
[2:17:23] I need to stop it
[2:17:25] here okay the the last verse before the
[2:17:27] God bless you
[2:17:30] brother that's the attitude in the queen
[2:17:32] of shivba
[2:17:34] listen God is not concerned so much
[2:17:37] about your
[2:17:38] money but he wants you to support him
[2:17:41] with all you
[2:17:43] are he don't want 10% of your money so
[2:17:46] much as he wants your time your talent
[2:17:49] your testimony and all all that you are
[2:17:51] to be given into his hands so he can
[2:17:54] control
[2:17:55] you he wants
[2:17:58] you he wants to be your Lord amen Lord
[2:18:03] means the all powerful the one that can
[2:18:07] control you right not only your savior
[2:18:12] but your lord lordship to govern you man
[2:18:17] has
[2:18:19] been you know man wanted to be
[2:18:22] governed right and we don't want any
[2:18:26] denominational thinking or
[2:18:28] denominational Creed will control us we
[2:18:31] want the Lord Jesus Christ to control us
[2:18:34] amen God's
[2:18:36] promises you know blessings to those who
[2:18:38] Faithfully tight stating that they're
[2:18:41] robbing him if they withhold their
[2:18:42] tithes and offerings it's also a
[2:18:44] blessing and a curse right so it means
[2:18:47] just I'm not warning or or or giving giv
[2:18:50] giving anything that
[2:18:52] will uh make us lonely because we're not
[2:18:56] faithful in titing no it's just to
[2:18:59] encourage you brothers and sisters try
[2:19:01] him try him that's what he said in his
[2:19:04] word right try me try me prove me he
[2:19:07] said right and and it's the same BR
[2:19:09] brandham was saying I challenge everyone
[2:19:12] here to dispute this uh scripture he
[2:19:15] said right so brothers and sisters we're
[2:19:18] thankful it's revealed to us that's why
[2:19:20] we don't need to worry at all amen uh
[2:19:24] let's uh sing the last uh uh sing a song

[2:25:50] think about the power of tithing I know
[2:25:53] the Lord revealed it to me in such a
[2:25:55] powerful way and I trust that he would
[2:25:57] do that for each and every one of us
