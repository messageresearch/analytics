[12:07] Christ what a faithful one he is if you
[12:10] have a need this morning just make it
[12:12] known unto him by way of an uplift hand
[12:15] as we go to him in prayer gracious
[12:18] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're so
[12:21] thankful Lord that while we stand here
[12:24] on this Earth Lord knowing that it's in
[12:27] the shifting Sands of Time time father
[12:30] everything is changing around us Lord
[12:32] you never change father we thank you
[12:35] that we can depend on
[12:37] that Lord we're so thankful that you've
[12:40] given us your rock of Revelation your
[12:42] word Lord Jesus and father the ability
[12:45] to hear it in the day in which we
[12:48] live father we just ask Lord that you
[12:50] would meet each need made known unto you
[12:53] today by way of an uplift hand father
[12:55] and Lord if there's a need that wasn't
[12:58] made known unto you physically Lord we
[13:01] know that you know mentally father we
[13:03] know more than anything that you know
[13:05] spiritually we just want to commit each
[13:08] and every need into your hands father
[13:10] and Lord we'll be careful to give you
[13:12] the praise and the glory for answering
[13:14] those prayers Lord father as we've said
[13:17] in the past we'll say it again today
[13:19] Lord Jesus let us not be like the other
[13:22] nine lepers father that were healed of
[13:24] their unbelief that Lord just turned and
[13:27] ran and celebrated and reveled in what
[13:31] you did for them but never once took the
[13:34] time to turn back to you and say thank
[13:36] you Lord for what you've done oh Father
[13:40] give us strength in the day in which we
[13:42] live father we pray that you would just
[13:44] bear us up on the wings of an eagle
[13:48] father we thank you for your tender
[13:50] loving kindness to each and every one of
[13:52] us Lord we know that you're more than
[13:54] willing more than able to meet each need
[13:57] as we commit them into your hand hands
[13:59] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[14:04] amen
[14:06] amen thank you musicians certainly
[14:09] appreciate each one continually bringing
[14:12] of their
[14:14] gifts offering them as a free will
[14:17] offering certainly does something for
[14:20] the service to have musicians so
[14:22] talented if you have your Bibles this
[14:25] morning I'd just like to read from 2
[14:28] Kings chapter
[14:32] 20 a familiar
[14:35] story just an inspiration that I believe
[14:37] the lord gave me and we'll just
[14:39] certainly trust
[14:43] him second Kings chapter
[14:46] 20 a story not the story but a story
[14:51] amen about King
[14:54] Hezekiah
[14:56] amen it's probably one of the most most
[14:59] famous stories of
[15:03] Hezekiah chapter 20 verse1 and second
[15:07] Kings says in those days was Hezekiah
[15:10] sick unto death and the prophet Isaiah
[15:14] the son of Amos came to him and said
[15:17] unto him thus saith the Lord set thine
[15:21] house in order for Thou shalt
[15:25] die and not live
[15:30] then he turned his face to the
[15:32] wall and prayed unto the
[15:35] Lord saying I beseech thee Oh Lord
[15:40] remember now how I have walked before
[15:43] thee in truth and with a perfect
[15:47] heart and have done that which is good
[15:52] in thy
[15:54] sight and Hezekiah wept
[15:57] sore and it came to
[16:00] pass at four Isaiah was gone out into
[16:05] the middle
[16:06] court that the word of the Lord came to
[16:09] him
[16:11] saying turn
[16:17] again and tell Hezekiah the captain of
[16:20] my
[16:22] people thus saith the Lord the god of
[16:25] David thy
[16:27] father I have heard heard thy prayer
[16:30] amen I have seen thy
[16:33] tears behold I will heal thee on the
[16:36] third day Thou shalt go up unto the
[16:41] house of the
[16:42] Lord and I will add unto thy days 15
[16:47] years and I will deliver thee and this
[16:50] city out of the hand of the king of
[16:53] Assyria and I will defend this city for
[16:57] my own sake
[16:59] and for my servant David's
[17:02] sake let's just bow in prayer one more
[17:05] time Heavenly Father we thank you for
[17:07] this word thank you that you are the
[17:11] faithful
[17:12] one thank you that you are unchanging
[17:16] Lord father we just pray that you would
[17:19] take this word that was spoken that was
[17:22] written that was inspired father that
[17:24] you would take it and just break it open
[17:26] to us fresh once again father I know
[17:29] your children have come hungry and
[17:31] father Lord I pray that I could just get
[17:33] out of the way father and that you would
[17:35] just have the preeminence Lord that you
[17:37] would just speak to all of us this
[17:39] morning Father and Lord that we would
[17:42] have hearts to receive what you have to
[17:44] say we love you and we thank you we just
[17:46] commit all the rest of this service into
[17:49] your hands For Your Glory in Jesus
[17:51] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you
[17:54] this morning you may be seated
[18:01] just can't get in his presence and not
[18:03] get emotional I think it's just
[18:05] wonderful just a few announcements
[18:07] before we get started here we have a
[18:10] communion service tonight at 5:30 p.m.
[18:13] just a wonderful opportunity to get
[18:15] together and uh discern the Lord's body
[18:18] just thank him for what he's done for
[18:20] each and every one of us we have an
[18:21] opportunity to partake of the communion
[18:24] table um as well as give a testimony for
[18:27] what the Lord's doing
[18:29] and it's a wonderful thing when we can
[18:31] give a testimony for what the Lord's
[18:32] doing whether it's seemingly great or
[18:34] whether it's seemingly small if the
[18:37] Lord's doing it it's perfect and uh it's
[18:40] just a wonderful time in the Lord so
[18:43] service tonight at 5:30 p.m. the
[18:44] communion service we haven't had one for
[18:46] a few months kind of took the summer off
[18:49] and
[18:50] uh I hope it's okay we have uh brother
[18:54] isacson coming here on uh the 25th on
[18:57] Wednesday from from Ghana he'll be here
[19:00] and uh he I think has a a Ministry that
[19:04] he's been ministering over western
[19:07] Canada he was with the Saints in
[19:09] Manitoba and I don't think he's been in
[19:11] Saskatchewan but I know he's heading to
[19:13] Edmonton as well so I spoke to brother
[19:16] Ed hammermeister and we coordinated a
[19:19] little bit of a schedule brother Ed did
[19:21] coordinated a bit of a schedule uh for
[19:24] his Alberta visit and uh our lot landed
[19:27] with the 25th so he'll be coming here
[19:30] and uh we're certainly excited to hear
[19:32] what the Lord has put on his heart we
[19:34] have uh October 1st we'll be going
[19:37] forwards with the church officer
[19:39] officers vote and uh it'll be the same
[19:43] thing that we've done in the past it
[19:44] will be uh by proxy so it will be an
[19:46] email and you can just answer the
[19:48] questionnaire either yes or no to each
[19:51] one brother mvin Panetta as the
[19:54] treasurer brother Paul clawen as a
[19:56] trustee brother Henry dick as a trustee
[20:00] brother Emanuel sarpong as a deacon
[20:03] Brother Don snow as a deacon brother
[20:06] Peter Boi Manu as a deacon brother Toby
[20:10] odoo has decided to step back from his
[20:13] duties of Deacon to pursue his ministry
[20:18] and uh he's been promoted to minister
[20:21] this gospel in many different places and
[20:23] the Lord has really blessed his ministry
[20:25] and we certainly want to encourage him
[20:27] in his leadership of the Lord so he has
[20:30] felt like he just hasn't been able to be
[20:33] strong in his position as a deacon here
[20:35] and it's really kind of bothered him and
[20:37] I don't think anyone has had issue with
[20:39] it at all understanding that he's been
[20:41] putting his shoulder to the wheel in a
[20:44] really strong way with the Saints in
[20:46] Lethbridge helping that church become
[20:48] established and rooted and grounded in
[20:51] the word and uh so he's really made a
[20:54] lot of efforts him and brother Gilbert
[20:56] to actually establish that that church
[20:59] and you know the church in Lethbridge
[21:01] has really come a long ways and I can
[21:03] tell you that myself I could never do
[21:06] what those two brothers have done there
[21:08] and that's the leadership of the Lord in
[21:09] their lives and I think it's well worth
[21:12] celebrating I think it's well worth
[21:14] congratulating them and uh you know the
[21:17] labor of love that they have for the
[21:19] Saints to see the gospel spread and to
[21:21] see a church established in Lethbridge I
[21:24] think that's nothing short of the
[21:26] leadership of the Lord in our brother's
[21:28] lives and you know they haven't been
[21:30] around many times and maybe we've
[21:32] wondered why they haven't been here it's
[21:33] not because they've stopped coming here
[21:35] it's because they're working to
[21:37] establish the church in Lethbridge and I
[21:39] know brother Jose he has been integral
[21:42] with what's happened in Lethbridge he
[21:44] carried the ball for a while down there
[21:46] and really labored and we certainly
[21:48] thank brother Jose for his efforts and
[21:51] uh you know it's a many membered body
[21:53] that makes things happen so brother Toby
[21:56] has decided to step back from um Deacon
[21:59] duties and he actually reminded me of it
[22:01] that he he spoke to me two years ago and
[22:03] said I don't know how long I'll be able
[22:05] to actually uphold this position because
[22:08] he knew he was going to travel and
[22:09] Minister and I just think it's wonderful
[22:12] to see the leadership of the Lord and so
[22:15] that is what we'll be voting on uh
[22:17] brother Toby will stay on he said until
[22:20] the end of the year so I don't think
[22:22] there's really a need to vote for him
[22:25] unless somebody has a an issue with him
[22:28] come and see me directly but I don't
[22:30] think we'll put him on the ballot I
[22:32] don't think there's any need for it um
[22:34] so if anybody has a leadership from the
[22:36] Lord where they would like to stand in
[22:39] the capacity of a deacon I want to call
[22:42] upon you now and say if that's what you
[22:44] feel led to do and you qualify there's
[22:48] very specific qualifications in the word
[22:52] and I think it's well worth going over
[22:53] we can certainly talk about that but if
[22:55] you have a leadership from the Lord to
[22:57] serve in that capacity we certainly do
[23:00] need someone um to actually help so
[23:04] we'll be going forward with a vote uh
[23:06] look for that it will be open from the
[23:09] 1st of October until the 4th of October
[23:11] it's not going to be very long so you'll
[23:13] have to watch for that and then just
[23:15] take your opportunity to vote and we'll
[23:17] go forwards from there on October the
[23:19] 12th we have the Men's breakfast we've
[23:21] been invited to in Edmonton and uh I
[23:24] think we're going to have I think it's
[23:25] brother Alistair from South Africa and
[23:28] uh and brother uh Matthew Watkins from
[23:33] uh North Carolina North no I'm getting
[23:36] it wrong South
[23:38] Carolina so I think that'll be a
[23:40] wonderful time as well there's been a
[23:42] tremendous response too from the
[23:43] brothers and uh I think it'll just be a
[23:45] wonderful time in the Lord and you know
[23:47] it's a bit of a sacrifice to go and do
[23:49] that and uh you know just come back but
[23:52] we know that uh through sacrifice
[23:55] there's gain so uh we also have the
[23:58] youth event coming up on the 20th I
[23:59] think it is is that right the 20th of
[24:01] October it's the weekend yeah that's
[24:04] what I thought so we certainly look
[24:06] forward to that as well are you happy
[24:08] this
[24:09] morning it's nice to see the weather
[24:11] changing see the snow dust the mountains
[24:14] and feel the little teeny bit of cool
[24:17] air fortunately it hasn't been really
[24:19] cold we haven't had a hard Frost yet
[24:21] which is a real blessing from the Lord
[24:24] I'm certainly thankful for that but we
[24:27] uh we'll just see what the Lord has in
[24:29] store it's been a a wonderful year and
[24:32] we're certainly excited to to see what
[24:34] the Lord has in store uh for anyone that
[24:37] might be wondering uh there's been a
[24:39] little bit of Buzz I guess a little bit
[24:41] of discussion uh we're going to be
[24:42] putting a monitor up on the back wall
[24:44] here um and I apologize um to everyone
[24:49] I'm terrible when it comes to
[24:51] communication and I know some folks have
[24:53] had questions about things um maybe what
[24:56] I'll try and do is just overc
[24:57] communicate a littleit bit what I would
[24:59] feel might be overc communicating a
[25:00] little bit so and you know if you do
[25:03] have any questions please by all means
[25:05] feel free to reach out to me directly I
[25:08] don't bite in fact I I really think a
[25:11] lot of confusion can be eliminated if
[25:12] somebody has a question if we could just
[25:14] have a conversation there's nothing
[25:16] wrong with talking to the pastor and a
[25:18] pastor that won't receive a
[25:20] conversation is actually got something
[25:22] wrong with him because he's there for a
[25:25] purpose and that's to help people so um
[25:28] anyways all that to say we're going to
[25:30] be putting a monitor up on the back wall
[25:31] it's going to hang from the ceiling and
[25:33] it's going to help those people who are
[25:34] leading songs here uh we'll be able to
[25:37] see the words up there and we won't have
[25:38] to try and look around the reflection of
[25:40] the lights on the screen here and so on
[25:43] so um if you see something different
[25:45] back there that's what's happening it's
[25:47] just so we can actually see a little
[25:49] easier God bless you this morning today
[25:52] I want to talk about a little bit about
[25:54] uh Hezekiah the story of Hezekiah and
[25:57] how he was the King and uh the king of
[26:00] Judah and just to see how the Lord
[26:02] really blessed him in his life and uh if
[26:05] I had to make a title for today's
[26:09] sermon it just hit me that uh I I'm I'm
[26:12] going to call it this and I might
[26:14] actually take a little bit of a series
[26:15] on this we'll see what the Lord has in
[26:17] store but let's make a
[26:19] deal let's make a
[26:21] deal and you know that's what the devil
[26:25] wants to do the devil wants to make a
[26:27] deal
[26:28] and we're going to talk about this now
[26:30] in uh I think a bit of detail here as we
[26:33] go forwards but we know that Hezekiah he
[26:37] was struck with an illness and uh he
[26:40] prayed and isn't it wonderful to see in
[26:43] second Kings chapter
[26:45] 20 verse
[26:47] 5 the prophet of God who had gone into
[26:51] him and was told by God to pronounce to
[26:54] him put your house in order because your
[26:56] house maybe is a little a little bit out
[26:58] of order and you're going to die in your
[27:01] flesh you're going to actually go to
[27:03] where your fathers were buried and
[27:05] you're going to now die and and then
[27:08] because of his prayer is kind of what
[27:12] I'm I'm so inspired by because of this
[27:14] man's prayer God turned his Prophet
[27:18] around and sent him back before he even
[27:21] left the
[27:23] premises and he said to him I've heard
[27:25] your your prayer has come to my ear
[27:28] and I have also seen your tears I
[27:31] understand that you're not ready to die
[27:32] you don't want to die so that's okay you
[27:36] know what because I I know I know who
[27:39] you are and I know how you love me I am
[27:42] prepared to give you 15 additional
[27:46] years I think it's just wonderful if you
[27:49] listen to the message I've got a bunch
[27:51] of quotes that I'm going to be uh
[27:52] pulling for from today and and you don't
[27:55] have to bring any of them up just yet
[27:57] brother but it's out of uh does god
[28:01] um I just have to look it up because I'm
[28:04] going to get it wrong God doesn't call
[28:06] man to judgment without first warning
[28:09] him God doesn't call man to judgment
[28:13] without first warning him I think it's
[28:16] just a beautiful message if you listen
[28:18] to that message brother Bram he talks
[28:21] about this and and he says here we have
[28:24] Hezekiah the king a human being remember
[28:27] he's a human being he's in flesh he's a
[28:30] man of like passions and and probably
[28:33] struggles maybe even a little more than
[28:35] many people because anything he wants
[28:37] he's got because he's the king he just
[28:40] has to go like that right or maybe it's
[28:43] like that that's what I want and and he
[28:45] can have it but here he's got something
[28:48] now that's beyond his control and he
[28:50] takes it to the Lord but the way he
[28:52] brings it to the Lord brothers and
[28:54] sisters is I think so significant he
[28:56] says I beseech thee Oh Lord verse 3 of
[28:59] 20 remember how I have walked before
[29:03] thee in
[29:04] truth and with a perfect heart yes sir
[29:08] now who on Earth has a perfect
[29:12] heart we know that David he was a man
[29:16] after God's Own Heart wasn't he and why
[29:19] was he the prophet of God said he was a
[29:22] man after God's Own Heart because he was
[29:24] quick to
[29:25] repent he wasn't interested in dragging
[29:28] around balls and chains he wasn't
[29:30] interested in in in in in the garbage
[29:33] from the past he wasn't even interested
[29:35] in making a deal with the devil he knew
[29:38] that the devil came around and tempted
[29:40] him but he never one time said it's all
[29:42] the devil's fault David said oh lord
[29:46] it's my fault and he went on his face
[29:49] himself to repent for his sin but here
[29:53] we have this King now death is brought
[29:56] to his doorstep you you are sick you're
[29:59] up on your bed and you're not coming
[30:00] down buddy get your house in order write
[30:03] out a will make sure that everybody
[30:06] knows what's going to happen when you
[30:08] die plan your funeral make sure
[30:10] everything is in order because now
[30:12] that's it's beyond your control even
[30:14] though you're a king you can't stop this
[30:16] what's coming to pass but my to be able
[30:20] to look to the Lord how many of us this
[30:22] morning can look to the Lord with
[30:23] confidence in your hearts I'm not
[30:24] looking for a hand I'm just trying to
[30:26] stimulate our hearts this is is really I
[30:28] guess the heart purpose of what I felt
[30:30] for today how many of us can say that
[30:33] we've walked before the Lord with a
[30:35] perfect
[30:38] heart I don't think it depends
[30:41] necessarily on how we walk every single
[30:43] day of Our Lives even though it does I
[30:46] think more than anything it depends on
[30:49] how willing we are to subject ourselves
[30:51] to the word of God and
[30:53] repent because the Zeal of the age is to
[30:56] repent it's not to say that everything
[30:58] is fine and live a different life behind
[31:01] the
[31:02] scenes that is not a Christian
[31:05] walk but here this king is saying
[31:09] remember now how I have walked before
[31:12] thee in truth and with a perfect heart
[31:15] and have done that which is good in thy
[31:18] sight I say Lord help me to do that
[31:22] which is good in your
[31:25] sight why
[31:28] you know looking at this
[31:30] King how could he have that
[31:34] confidence let's just back up a little
[31:36] bit let's turn the page back a little
[31:39] bit in uh in Second Kings if you just
[31:42] turn back to 2 Kings chapter
[31:54] 18 2 Kings chapter 18
[31:58] now it came to pass in the third
[32:01] year o of
[32:04] hos son of ela king of
[32:07] Israel that Hezekiah the son of ahaz
[32:12] King of Judah began to
[32:15] Reign 2 and5 years old was he when he
[32:20] began to Reign and he
[32:22] reigned 29 years in
[32:26] Jerusalem his mother 's name was also
[32:29] Abby the daughter of
[32:31] Zachariah and here's the key to it right
[32:34] here verse three and he did that which
[32:37] was right in the sight of the Lord
[32:40] according to all that David his father
[32:43] did what did he do that was right in the
[32:45] sight of the Lord you ask verse four he
[32:49] removed the high
[32:51] places break the
[32:53] images cut down the
[32:56] Groves break in pieces the Brazen
[33:00] serpent that Moses had made now when I
[33:04] read this I thought wow he broke the
[33:07] Brazen serpent wouldn't that be a sacred
[33:12] artifact it truly would be wouldn't it
[33:15] because God told them if you look at
[33:17] this thing you'll
[33:19] live when the serpents come through and
[33:22] bite you for murmuring cuz that's what
[33:24] it was
[33:25] about when you look upon this Brazen
[33:28] serpent you'll
[33:30] live now here we have this King that had
[33:32] a perfect heart that walked perfectly
[33:34] before the Lord he smashes this this
[33:37] sacred
[33:38] artifact this is why For unto those days
[33:42] the children of Israel did burn incense
[33:45] to
[33:47] it and called it and he called it n
[33:53] hushan why did he break it because they
[33:56] took this thing that God gave them and
[33:59] they perverted
[34:01] it brothers and sisters if we're not
[34:04] careful we can take this thing that
[34:06] God's given us and pervert
[34:10] it and the devil loves that the devil
[34:13] loves to get right in that thing that
[34:16] God has given
[34:18] us and get us to pervert it right and
[34:21] all the while we'll think we're doing
[34:23] right while we're burning incense to the
[34:24] serpent
[34:28] but thanks be to God for a king that
[34:30] would have the desire in his heart to
[34:32] not do what his fathers did to not look
[34:35] around and say I don't need to be like
[34:37] the people of the land we don't need to
[34:39] be like the amorites or the parasites or
[34:41] the kenites or the moabites we don't
[34:44] have to be like any of the IES all we
[34:46] need to do is serve the Lord follow the
[34:49] lord holy
[34:52] Hallelujah I think there's a critical
[34:54] key here brothers and sisters and I'm
[34:57] going to harp on it for a little bit he
[34:59] removed the high places and break the
[35:02] images I believe there comes a point in
[35:05] time in a believer's life where we need
[35:07] to examine all of the artifacts that
[35:10] we've got going on in our Christian walk
[35:12] all of our belief structures everything
[35:15] that that that gives us this idea this
[35:18] ideology that we're a Believer what is
[35:21] it that surrounds us is it truly just
[35:23] the word of God or do we have a little
[35:26] bit of a high place
[35:28] something that we just keep there it's
[35:30] just it's just tradition it's just what
[35:32] we've done so we're just going to keep
[35:34] that there and we'll just continue on
[35:35] with the Lord it'll be
[35:39] okay a
[35:41] grove Grove a nice beautiful garden a
[35:46] nice surrounding area of trees where you
[35:50] can go and prostrate yourself before
[35:53] your God do we have any of that is there
[35:56] anything in our lives that comes before
[35:58] the word of God that we're willing to
[36:00] actually say you know I I know the
[36:03] Lord's just calling me in my heart he's
[36:05] in my heart and he's speaking to me and
[36:07] he's telling me I don't like you doing
[36:09] this thing I I want you to stop whatever
[36:11] it is you're doing but I just can't seem
[36:14] to do it and and and I just don't know
[36:16] how I'm ever going to get over it and
[36:18] maybe what I need to do is just reside
[36:20] to the fact that you know maybe it's
[36:22] genetics maybe it's actually a curse
[36:25] from the past maybe it's my for for
[36:27] fathers maybe there's a grandpa or a
[36:29] grandma or something in my life's
[36:31] history that just had this thing and now
[36:34] it's just come down to the generations
[36:36] we're living in an age brothers and
[36:38] sisters with the culmination of all the
[36:40] devils in Earth but we're also living
[36:42] under the Full Gospel Light of the Lord
[36:46] Jesus Christ we don't have to make a
[36:48] deal with the devil and say no no it's a
[36:50] genetic curse it's it's something from
[36:52] the past and I can just make make an
[36:54] excuse for it and say I I just need to
[36:56] accept it I just have this thing
[36:58] whatever it is the devil loves to make a
[37:01] deal he's just agonizing pining for us
[37:05] to say yeah just accept it it's okay you
[37:08] can't help it you don't have to worry
[37:10] about it you just keep going forward
[37:12] just keep marching forward and going to
[37:13] church brothers and sisters keep
[37:14] marching forward and going to church is
[37:16] right that's what the prophet said
[37:19] that's what the word of God says forsake
[37:20] not the assembling of yourselves even
[37:22] more so as you see the day approaching
[37:25] and be willing to exhort one another
[37:28] encouraging one another what I'm getting
[37:31] at today is we don't have to make
[37:32] excuses we don't have to make a deal
[37:35] with the devil because when we say that
[37:37] I've got this thing in my life and I'm
[37:39] just going to make an excuse for it
[37:41] we're making a deal with the
[37:44] devil Hezekiah never made a deal
[37:47] Hezekiah brought his case to the Lord he
[37:50] didn't say okay I'm going to die that's
[37:52] okay now I I know some people are
[37:55] probably saying but brother Barry you
[37:56] know brother bam in this message does
[37:58] God ever change his mind about his word
[37:59] he says very specifically his first word
[38:02] is his only word that's it and Hezekiah
[38:05] changed the mind of God to give him 15
[38:07] years instead of taking his life right
[38:09] then you know one day or other sooner or
[38:11] later we all have to perish in this
[38:13] flesh we all have to give up the ghost
[38:16] whether we go in the Rapture or whether
[38:17] we go in the grave this flesh is corrupt
[38:20] we can't hang on to this flesh but
[38:23] brother bradam he says the problem with
[38:26] this is that even though God gave him 15
[38:28] years he corrupted himself he went from
[38:31] walking with a perfect heart to being
[38:34] puffed up with pride and it says in the
[38:36] word of God that God stepped back from
[38:38] him and said I just want to see what
[38:40] he'll do now and what did he do he got
[38:43] puffed up with his riches he brought the
[38:45] the friends in from Babylon and he had a
[38:47] little party and he showed them all of
[38:48] the wealth and the treasury he showed
[38:50] them all of his treasures in the
[38:52] treasure room he showed them all of the
[38:54] spices in in the pantry he showed him
[38:56] everything there and the Prophet even
[38:57] came to him and said what did you do
[39:00] what did you do were you bragging were
[39:03] you showing everyone how good you are
[39:06] don't you know that's only because God
[39:08] has blessed you in your life that you're
[39:13] here just because we ask for something
[39:15] doesn't necessarily mean it's going to
[39:17] be for our good brothers and sisters we
[39:19] need to seek it very carefully what
[39:22] we're asking the Lord
[39:25] for but I think it's interesting to look
[39:28] at the past of
[39:29] Hezekiah and to see how he could have
[39:33] such confidence in his prayer to say
[39:35] don't you remember Lord how I walked
[39:38] with you before you with a perfect
[39:40] heart he trusted the Lord God of
[39:45] Israel verse five so that after him was
[39:49] none like him among all the kings of
[39:52] Judah nor any that were before him
[39:58] that's quite a
[40:00] king says for he clave to the Lord and
[40:03] departed not from following him but kept
[40:05] his
[40:06] Commandments What
[40:09] Commandments Not Just the Ten
[40:11] Commandments but all the Commandments
[40:13] amen and the Commandments which the Lord
[40:17] commanded
[40:18] Moses and who was Moses Moses was the
[40:21] prophet Moses brought the word for the
[40:24] day and you know if we want to walk with
[40:26] a perfect perfect heart brothers and
[40:28] sisters we just need to follow the word
[40:29] of the Prophet we just need to follow
[40:32] the word of God for our
[40:34] day but you know what happened was in in
[40:38] hezekiah's life he had a challenge and
[40:43] you know brothers and sisters when we
[40:45] get ourselves into the position where we
[40:47] are in the channel where the Lord wants
[40:50] us to be the devil don't like that none
[40:53] not one bit so what's he going to do
[40:56] he's going to come guns blazing he's
[40:58] going to come after us and he's going to
[41:01] try everything in his Arsenal to try and
[41:05] get us and and I just think it's
[41:07] interesting you know how you you look at
[41:09] the life of Hezekiah if you go further
[41:11] in in chapter 18 over into 19 and maybe
[41:16] if we just look at uh verse
[41:19] 12 maybe 11 and the king of Assyria did
[41:23] carry away Israel into Assyria and put
[41:25] them in halah and into h
[41:27] by the river Goan and in the cities of
[41:30] the mes because they obeyed not the
[41:33] voice of the Lord there God but
[41:36] transgressed his Covenant in all that
[41:38] Moses the servant of the Lord commanded
[41:41] and would not hear them nor do them now
[41:45] in the 14th year of King Hezekiah did
[41:49] Senate cherub king of Assyria come up
[41:51] against all the fence cities of Judah
[41:54] and took them and Hezekiah king of Judah
[41:58] sent to the king of Assyria tashas
[42:01] saying I I have
[42:03] offended return from
[42:06] me that which thou put us on me and I
[42:09] bear and the king of Assyria appointed
[42:13] unto Hezekiah king of Judah 300 talant
[42:16] of silver and 30 talant of
[42:19] gold so he he says I think I've offended
[42:23] you what can I do to make this right and
[42:25] the King says to him I'll tell what you
[42:27] can do I'll tell you what you can do to
[42:29] make this right let's make a deal right
[42:33] verse 15 says and Hezekiah gave him all
[42:36] the silver that was found in the house
[42:39] of the
[42:40] Lord that wasn't even his
[42:42] silver but that's what the devil's
[42:44] coming for brothers and sisters all
[42:46] that's not even his right and in the
[42:50] Treasures of the King's house and at
[42:53] that
[42:54] time did Hezekiah this is where it gets
[42:57] really hard if we're not careful as
[43:00] Believers we can find ourselves doing
[43:02] this trying to make a deal with the
[43:03] devil just to get him to go
[43:06] away at that time did Hezekiah cut off
[43:09] the gold from the doors of the Temple of
[43:12] the Lord and from the pillars which
[43:15] Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid and
[43:18] gave it to who to the king of
[43:21] Assyria the devil's going to come around
[43:23] and try and strip our worship he's going
[43:26] to come around and try and strip our
[43:28] ability to feed upon the word he's going
[43:31] to come around and try and strip our
[43:33] ability to have a solid marriage to have
[43:36] a solid relationship with our children
[43:38] to have overcoming power in our lives
[43:41] he's going to come around and try and
[43:43] strip that gold from our Temple we don't
[43:46] have to make a deal with them right we
[43:48] don't have to say okay I I'll just give
[43:51] you this because remember what what is
[43:53] the saying if you give an inch they're
[43:55] going to take a mile and that's what the
[43:58] devil's going to do he's going to try
[43:59] and take way more than we're willing to
[44:01] give verse 17 says and the king of
[44:03] Assyria sent to Tartan and and to this
[44:07] guy's a bad guy RAB zeras and to rashaka
[44:13] from Lees to King Hezekiah with a great
[44:16] host against Jerusalem and they went up
[44:18] and came to Jerusalem and when they were
[44:20] come up they came and stood by the
[44:23] conduit of the upper pool which is in
[44:25] the highway of the Fuller's field and
[44:27] when they had called out to the king
[44:29] there came out to them eliakim the son
[44:31] of hila which is over the household of
[44:34] she shebna The Scribe and Jonah the son
[44:37] of
[44:38] Assaf and the recorder Assaf the
[44:41] recorder and RAB Sheeka said unto them
[44:46] speak ye now to
[44:48] Hezekiah and and this should have been
[44:50] the very first indicator right here and
[44:53] I'm sure it was in the ears of Hezekiah
[44:56] thus saith who the great king who is
[45:00] this great
[45:01] king thus saith the great king of
[45:05] Assyria what confidence is this wherein
[45:09] thou trust
[45:10] us thou sayest but they are but vain
[45:14] words I have counsel and strength for
[45:17] the war now on whom Dost thou trust that
[45:22] thou rebelles against
[45:25] me here we have a giant standing in the
[45:29] valley boasting out his commands
[45:32] boasting out just like Goliath and the
[45:35] whole entire Israeli Army standing there
[45:39] with their knees knocking and all afraid
[45:41] even the king afraid to go down and face
[45:44] this giant but one little Ruddy man is
[45:47] all that God needed just one little runt
[45:52] right the one that didn't even his
[45:54] father didn't even think he qualified
[45:57] and Samuel came to his house and said
[45:59] show me your sons because one of them is
[46:01] going to be anointed today to be king of
[46:04] Israel amen even his dad didn't have
[46:07] confidence in him but God who is rich in
[46:10] Mercy put something in the heart of that
[46:12] boy David that Shepherd boy and when he
[46:16] heard this he said are you serious the
[46:19] whole host of Israel is making a deal
[46:22] with the devil oh yes don't you realize
[46:25] this is our land he he's standing in our
[46:28] land this is our property we've got the
[46:30] title deed to
[46:33] it and we're going to let him do that oh
[46:36] and and they and they said oh okay okay
[46:38] okay if you want to do it you can do it
[46:40] our way isn't that interesting yeah yeah
[46:43] let's play politics now let's get
[46:45] political and say oh God's got a
[46:47] revelation in your heart now if you want
[46:50] to do what God's put in your heart just
[46:51] do it the way that we say take the
[46:53] king's armor and we know that David said
[46:56] I can't do that just take it off it
[46:58] weighs tooo much I'm not I'm not made
[47:00] that way I've got an experience where I
[47:02] met a lion myself and I never made a
[47:05] deal with that lion and I met a bear
[47:07] myself and I never made a deal with that
[47:09] bear and I know the same God of Israel
[47:13] is with me right now and that devil down
[47:16] there in the valley boasting doesn't
[47:18] stand a chance that's right and when he
[47:21] went down there what did he do brothers
[47:23] and sisters he didn't go down there with
[47:25] just a little bit of confidence where he
[47:27] was a shy Ruddy little boy he says in
[47:29] the word that he ran to the
[47:32] battle he ran to it because he knew
[47:34] exactly where he stood he was not
[47:38] interested in what everyone else was
[47:40] interested in let's make a deal no deal
[47:44] This Is Our Land this is our promised
[47:46] land and I want to say today brothers
[47:49] and sisters this is no time to make a
[47:51] deal with the devil we have been given a
[47:54] Promised Land that's Jesus Christ saying
[47:57] yesterday today and forever through the
[47:59] message of a Vindicated Prophet let's
[48:01] take our
[48:03] [Applause]
[48:05] land we don't have to make
[48:09] excuses if there's people murmuring let
[48:11] them
[48:12] murmur God hates it and he hears it yes
[48:17] he does don't make a deal with the
[48:20] devil Hallelujah you know talking about
[48:22] the same story here in 2 Chronicles chap
[48:25] 32 vers
[48:27] 7 it says be strong and courageous amen
[48:31] this is what the King was now saying
[48:34] this one who had a perfect heart walking
[48:36] before the Lord he knew where he stood
[48:39] King Hezekiah was going to his generals
[48:42] was going to the armies and saying to
[48:45] them be strong and courageous Be not
[48:49] Afraid nor dismayed for the king of
[48:52] Assyria remember the cities were under
[48:55] siege right right they had a host of
[48:59] army they had a lot of of people there A
[49:03] lot of
[49:04] soldiers Be not Afraid nor dismayed for
[49:07] the king of Assyria nor for all the
[49:09] multitude that is with him for there be
[49:12] more with
[49:13] usj than with him does that sound
[49:17] familiar Lord open that boy's
[49:20] eyes and what happened we know there was
[49:23] Chariots of Fire and hosts of angels
[49:26] same thing Brothers and Sisters Jesus
[49:28] Christ the same yesterday today and
[49:30] forever there is more with us than there
[49:32] is of these Devils that are boasting and
[49:35] let me tell you these devils are
[49:36] boasting in our midst they're boasting
[49:39] in our families they're boasting in our
[49:42] congregation amen but we don't need to
[49:44] make a deal with
[49:45] them in fact I'm not going to make a
[49:47] deal with them I simply refuse to make a
[49:50] deal with them because I know that he
[49:52] called me and I know where I stand and
[49:54] I'm going to give it to him to say let's
[49:57] have a showdown this is God's work it's
[50:00] not mine and it's not yours it's up to
[50:03] him verse 8 of 32 it says with him is an
[50:07] arm of Flesh this is the king of Assyria
[50:10] Sienna cherub this really strong guy
[50:13] with all the host of the armies with him
[50:16] is an arm of flesh but with us is the
[50:19] Lord Our God to help us and to fight our
[50:22] battles and the people rested themselves
[50:25] upon the words of Ziah the king of
[50:29] Judah this guy Hezekiah he had an
[50:32] experience with the Lord and you know
[50:34] brothers and sisters I want to encourage
[50:36] us if we're going through a battle if
[50:38] we're going through a giant in our land
[50:40] trying to boast against us in any way
[50:43] from us living in peace in our Promised
[50:45] Land you don't have to accept
[50:48] it have you ever had an experience with
[50:50] the Lord amen have we ever seen him come
[50:53] on the scene when there's no hope when
[50:56] there's no way out when there's no way
[50:58] in the world we can make a change that's
[51:01] exactly where God loves to see us get
[51:04] amen and that was exactly what he wanted
[51:06] to see with the king of Assyria coming
[51:08] up against Hezekiah it was no accident
[51:10] that the king of Syria he wanted to come
[51:12] up against Hezekiah it was no accident
[51:14] that their whole city was under siege it
[51:17] was no accident this was God testing to
[51:20] prove who his son was
[51:25] amen this guy coming around saying thus
[51:28] say the great king the king of Assyria
[51:31] what confidence is this wherein thou
[51:34] trust us my if you've ever had an
[51:38] experience you can have confidence amen
[51:41] you can have confidence you don't have
[51:42] to look at David and say only David can
[51:45] have that kind of of faith and maybe
[51:48] only brother brandham can have that kind
[51:50] of Faith brothers and sisters they've
[51:52] both passed
[51:54] on if someone doesn't pick up that level
[51:58] of Faith then all that they have done is
[52:01] in vain that's right there has to be
[52:03] someone that says I'm so glad that I can
[52:07] say I'm one of them God has called me
[52:11] and I know where I stand amen Hezekiah
[52:15] had an experience with the Lord and I
[52:17] believe today that we've had experiences
[52:19] and that's why I'm I'm preaching and
[52:21] harping today brothers and sisters
[52:22] because I want to say if we have had an
[52:25] experience just dig find that experience
[52:28] and say Lord remind me of that
[52:30] experience bring it back to me show me
[52:32] the joy of my salvation show me the
[52:35] strength of that kind of faith in my
[52:37] life because I know that you're God the
[52:40] devil's going to come around and say no
[52:42] everything's wrong nope everything's out
[52:44] of order nope it shouldn't be this way
[52:46] nope it shouldn't be that way no no no
[52:48] no no who are you putting your
[52:49] confidence in put your confidence in
[52:52] me and you know verse 25 this is
[52:55] beautiful this is beautiful this is
[52:57] where I think we need to really just
[52:58] remember verse 25 it says am I now come
[53:02] up without the Lord against this place
[53:05] to destroy
[53:06] it the king of Assyria his messenger is
[53:09] saying it to to
[53:11] Hezekiah now he's talking about the
[53:14] Lord yeah yeah and he goes on to say the
[53:16] Lord said to me oh which one go up
[53:20] against this land and destroy
[53:23] it Lord
[53:27] I I'll say it this way I would say the
[53:28] Lord of
[53:30] hosts remember the story of the Prophet
[53:34] Micaiah how how how he was brought up
[53:37] into the heavenly host and he was told
[53:39] he was shown the Lord sitting on his
[53:42] throne and he said who's going to get my
[53:44] will my word to come to pass in ahab's
[53:47] life H and we know a few mingled around
[53:50] but one came and said I'll go down I'll
[53:52] go I'll be a lying spirit in the mouth
[53:55] of all the prophets
[53:57] amen there's no doubt in my mind the
[53:59] Lord said to him go
[54:01] up go up and you'll be able to destroy
[54:06] him just just carrying on further in in
[54:10] Second Kings verse chapter
[54:14] 18 it it's
[54:17] terrible the way this guy boasted and
[54:20] and I know we're in a mixed audience
[54:21] it's the word of God I'm just going to
[54:23] say it I wasn't going to but I think I
[54:24] should verse 27 said this bad guy
[54:28] remember RAB shakah he said unto them
[54:32] here my master sent me to speak to thy
[54:36] master and to thee to speak these words
[54:40] hath he not sent me to the men which sit
[54:43] on the wall that they may eat their own
[54:45] dung and drink their own piss with
[54:49] you this is what this King thought about
[54:51] these people this is what the devil
[54:54] thinks of you this is what the devil
[54:56] thinks of me yes he has zero respect for
[55:00] us brothers and sisters he wants to
[55:02] destroy us he doesn't want us to just
[55:04] make a deal by making a deal we open the
[55:07] door for Destruction amen amen yes sir
[55:11] then RAB Sheeka stood and cried with a
[55:16] loud voice in the Jews
[55:18] language I didn't read it but if you
[55:20] want to go back and read the whole story
[55:22] they said please don't talk in in in our
[55:24] language just speak to us in Syrian
[55:26] because we the elders can understand
[55:28] let's not get everyone else
[55:29] upset they they asked him to do that and
[55:32] that's just the devil you can say let's
[55:35] make a deal just please don't talk in
[55:36] that language I don't want to get the
[55:38] family upset and the devil's going to
[55:39] say all right I know exactly what to do
[55:41] I am going to cry with a loud voice in
[55:44] that language and spake again saying
[55:46] hear the word of the great king the king
[55:49] of Assyria the great king the king of
[55:51] Assyria thus saith the king let not
[55:54] Hezekiah deceive you

[55:59] out of his
[56:01] hand and he is
[56:04] right right wasn't he right amen the
[56:07] devil brings
[56:09] truth yes he's not afraid to actually
[56:12] bring truth brothers and sisters there's
[56:14] no way Hezekiah could have done it verse
[56:16] 30 neither let Hezekiah make you trust
[56:19] in the Lord uh oh now he's going too far
[56:22] sir now he's going too far he's stepping
[56:24] over that line yes sir
[56:27] saying the Lord will surely Deliver us
[56:29] and this city shall not be delivered
[56:31] into the hand of the king of Assyria
[56:33] hearken not he just works on them and
[56:36] works on them and works on them hearken
[56:38] not to Hezekiah for thus saith the king
[56:41] of
[56:42] Assyria can you believe this make an
[56:45] agreement with me let's make a deal

[56:50] leadership just forget about it let's

[57:41] Eve in the garden you'll you'll be as
[57:45] gods they were
[57:47] God of the earth amen until I come and

[57:54] land a land of corn and wine a land of
[57:57] bread and Vineyards a land of oil and
[58:00] olive and of honey that ye may live and
[58:03] not die and he just reinforces it he
[58:06] underpins it here the devil speaking
[58:08] hearken not unto Hezekiah when he
[58:12] persuaded you saying the Lord will
[58:15] deliver us can you believe this guy
[58:19] boasting his way around trying to get
[58:22] everyone on side with him to say just
[58:24] forget about it don't listen to them
[58:27] look at the circumstances look at all
[58:29] the natural circum isn't it obvious
[58:31] can't you see the Army surrounding can't
[58:33] you see all the natural
[58:34] circumstances of course it can't turn
[58:36] out right listen to my voice don't
[58:39] listen to him he's saying that God is
[58:42] going to deliver what God he says and
[58:45] and you know this king of Assyria he
[58:46] goes on to talk about it uh I'm oh in in
[58:49] verse 34 where are the gods of harath
[58:52] and arpad where are the gods of sephar
[58:55] vam and and Hina and of IA have they
[58:58] delivered Samaria out of my hand who are
[59:02] they among all the gods of the countries
[59:04] that they have delivered their country
[59:06] out of mine hand that the Lord should
[59:08] deliver Jerusalem out of my
[59:10] hand now this is a beautiful part we
[59:14] read it out of out of uh 2 Chronicles it
[59:17] doesn't actually say it here
[59:19] specifically like it did in 2 Chronicles
[59:22] but verse
[59:23] 36 but the people held their peace
[59:26] amen and answered him not a
[59:30] word I believe that's a critical Factor
[59:33] key brothers and sisters when the Devil
[59:35] comes around and boast just hold your
[59:36] peace amen don't even say a word to him
[59:39] don't even give him a word just do the
[59:41] opposite that's all just do the opposite
[59:44] for the king's commandment was saying
[59:47] answer him not then came eliakim the son
[59:52] of hilka which was over the household
[59:54] and shebna the scribe and Jonah the son
[59:57] of Asaf the recorder to Hezekiah with
[1:00:00] their clothes rent and told him the
[1:00:03] words of this bad guy RAB
[1:00:06] Shaka verse n Chapter 19 Verse one I I
[1:00:10] just think it's so beautiful this is
[1:00:11] where we see this man we see this this
[1:00:14] one excuse me that was walking perfectly
[1:00:17] before the Lord he knew where he stood
[1:00:20] he knew exactly what he was commissioned
[1:00:22] for verse 19 chapter 19 ver1 I I mean
[1:00:26] and it came to pass when King Hezekiah
[1:00:28] heard it that he rent his clothes and
[1:00:30] covered himself with sackcloth and went
[1:00:33] into the house of the Lord he didn't go
[1:00:35] look to some sort of other Guru some
[1:00:39] other source he went right to the
[1:00:41] message for his day amen he went right
[1:00:43] to the house of the Lord to see what
[1:00:45] could happen and he sent eliakim which
[1:00:48] was over the household and shebna the
[1:00:50] Scribe and the Elders of the priest
[1:00:52] covered with sackcloth to Isaiah the
[1:00:55] prophet Hallelujah he went right to the
[1:00:57] word for his day didn't he Hallelujah
[1:01:00] the son of Amos and they said unto him
[1:01:04] thus saith Hezekiah this day is a day of
[1:01:06] trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy
[1:01:09] for the children are come to birth and
[1:01:12] there is not strength to bring
[1:01:15] forth you know brothers and sisters I
[1:01:17] can't help but take and look at this as
[1:01:19] a spiritual connotation for the day in
[1:01:22] which we live the devil is Raging our
[1:01:25] city our our Jerusalem City this
[1:01:28] Promised Land the Holy Ghost is under
[1:01:32] siege and if you think it's not you're
[1:01:35] deceived our cities are under siege by
[1:01:38] the devil today doesn't mean they're
[1:01:41] taken by the devil what I'm saying is
[1:01:43] just like this story he's making his
[1:01:45] boast continually making his boast
[1:01:47] saying are you going to follow the
[1:01:48] leadership of the message of the hour
[1:01:50] are you really going to do that are you
[1:01:52] going to follow the word of the Prophet
[1:01:54] for your day are you really going to do
[1:01:56] that continually trying to break us down
[1:01:59] to wear us down and we know the word of
[1:02:02] God says that you know he's going to try
[1:02:04] and Stamp Out the residue of the
[1:02:06] Believers on the earth out of the Book
[1:02:08] of Revelation he's going to try and wear
[1:02:10] down the Saints and the word of God says
[1:02:12] that he will wear down the Saints right
[1:02:15] but he won't destroy them hallelujah
[1:02:19] amen but this scripture here that says
[1:02:21] this day is a day of trouble and of
[1:02:24] rebuke and of blasphemy me for the
[1:02:27] children are come to birth and there is
[1:02:29] not strength to bring forth the mothers
[1:02:33] are just about ready to pass the baby
[1:02:36] they're just about ready to give birth
[1:02:39] but you know if they don't have strength
[1:02:40] to push what's going to happen they're
[1:02:43] going to die they're going to die trying
[1:02:46] to give birth now I can't help but think
[1:02:49] brothers and sisters this goes a long
[1:02:51] ways our way when we get that
[1:02:53] opportunity to get the baptism of the
[1:02:56] Holy Ghost that is the new
[1:02:58] birth saying that I believe the message
[1:03:01] of the hour that's not the new birth
[1:03:03] saying that I was raised in the message
[1:03:05] of the hour is not the new birth and
[1:03:07] even going and getting baptized in water
[1:03:10] is not the New
[1:03:12] Birth the new birth is Jesus Christ the
[1:03:15] person coming in taking aode and living
[1:03:18] out through our
[1:03:20] lives that's the new birth sir and it
[1:03:24] all comes exactly how we just
[1:03:27] described but I wonder if some people
[1:03:30] aren't to the place where they're just
[1:03:31] about ready to have that new birth but
[1:03:34] there's no spiritual strength to bring
[1:03:36] them
[1:03:39] forward and what causes that oh there's
[1:03:42] a multiplicity of things that will cause
[1:03:44] that but I'll say this probably the
[1:03:46] biggest thing is not feeding on the word
[1:03:48] of God
[1:03:50] properly and you know what when we don't
[1:03:52] hold this word of God continually before
[1:03:54] our eyes day and night when we don't
[1:03:56] follow the word of God and hold it
[1:03:58] before our children's eyes day and night
[1:04:00] and teach them the statutes of this
[1:04:03] living God that Hezekiah followed when
[1:04:05] we don't do that what happens is we
[1:04:08] cause them to live a life thinking
[1:04:10] they're saved and they're not yes sir
[1:04:13] yes sir and they come to the place of
[1:04:15] the new birth and they're just not able
[1:04:17] they just don't have the strength I want
[1:04:19] to say today brothers and sisters push
[1:04:21] aside all of our cares all of our
[1:04:24] thoughts all of our for former thinking
[1:04:26] our Traditions our ideas and have the
[1:04:29] strength the spiritual strength to be
[1:04:31] able to bring forth
[1:04:33] properly verse four says it may be the
[1:04:37] Lord thy God will hear all the
[1:04:39] words it may be that the Lord can hear
[1:04:42] all his words right this bad guy RAB RAB
[1:04:46] Shaka who the king of Assyria his master
[1:04:48] has sent to reproach the Living God and
[1:04:51] will reprove The Words which the Lord
[1:04:54] thy God hath heard wherefore for lift up
[1:04:56] thy prayer for the remnant that are
[1:04:59] left so the Servants of King Hezekiah
[1:05:03] came to
[1:05:04] who prophet Isaiah and Isaiah said unto
[1:05:09] them thus shall ye say to your master
[1:05:12] thus saith who Lord the Lord when the
[1:05:16] Devil comes around and says thus saith
[1:05:18] the king we have the key we have thus
[1:05:23] saith the Lord brothers and sisters
[1:05:26] and if you wonder whether you do or you
[1:05:28] don't the prophet of God God who is rich
[1:05:31] in Mercy through the prophet to us in
[1:05:33] the day in which we live he ha he said
[1:05:36] she has thus saith the Lord and the mind
[1:05:40] of Christ to know what to do with that
[1:05:43] yes Lord
[1:05:44] amen and I want to encourage us what to
[1:05:47] do with that is when we hear thus saith
[1:05:50] the king thus saith the master thus
[1:05:53] saith whatever it is that we serve thus
[1:05:56] saith whatever it is that we feel like
[1:05:58] we're burdened under that we just can't
[1:06:00] escape when we hear that thus saith
[1:06:02] remember thus sayith the
[1:06:06] lord it's for
[1:06:08] you and Isaiah said unto them thus shall
[1:06:12] ye say to your master you you you the
[1:06:14] prophet of God now taking over grabbing
[1:06:17] the rains and saying you just give him
[1:06:19] this word right thus sayith the Lord be
[1:06:22] not afraid of The Words which thou Hast
[1:06:26] heard with which the Servants of the
[1:06:28] king of Assyria have blasphemed me
[1:06:31] behold I will send a blast upon
[1:06:35] him isn't this interesting when I first
[1:06:38] was going through this I thought a blast
[1:06:39] upon him maybe a nuclear blast maybe a
[1:06:42] uh a non-nuclear but really powerful
[1:06:44] blast maybe a a furnace wind blast what
[1:06:47] was it the blast was a
[1:06:50] rumor it was a
[1:06:53] rumor murmuring
[1:06:58] chattering behold I will send a blast on
[1:07:00] him and he shall hear a rumor and shall
[1:07:04] return to his own land and I will cause
[1:07:07] him to Fall by The Sword in his own
[1:07:10] land and you know that's exactly what
[1:07:13] happened to this guy he fell by The
[1:07:16] Sword in his own land and how did he
[1:07:19] fall by the sword he was in his Temple
[1:07:21] he was worshiping his gods and it was
[1:07:24] his son
[1:07:26] his own offspring came and skewered
[1:07:31] him thus saith the
[1:07:34] king let not thy God in whom thou trust
[1:07:38] us deceive thee that is what he said to
[1:07:42] the king verse 10 says thus shall ye
[1:07:44] speak to Hezekiah the king of Judah
[1:07:46] saying let not thy God in whom thou
[1:07:49] trust us deceive thee saying Jerusalem
[1:07:51] shall not be delivered into the hand of
[1:07:53] the king of Assyria he was bold he had
[1:07:56] an anointing same with the devil today
[1:07:58] he's bold he's got an anointing this is
[1:08:01] his evil age he's the God of this evil
[1:08:03] age brothers and sisters this is the
[1:08:05] only age where he was labeled that the
[1:08:08] God of this evil age yes Lord but you're
[1:08:11] the bride of
[1:08:13] Christ he can have this age can't he he
[1:08:16] can have this whole world but give me
[1:08:18] Jesus
[1:08:19] right
[1:08:22] amen
[1:08:23] why verse 14 says and
[1:08:26] Hezekiah received the letter of the hand
[1:08:30] of The Messengers and read it and when
[1:08:32] Hezekiah went up into the house of the
[1:08:35] Lord what did he do this was the letter
[1:08:38] that this King The King The Great king
[1:08:41] thus saith the king this guy he had his
[1:08:44] letter head he probably had an official
[1:08:46] sealed stamp on it you could imagine he
[1:08:48] was a very pompus guy he had this great
[1:08:51] letter what did The King The King
[1:08:53] Hezekiah do he took it he re received it
[1:08:56] but he took it up and he spread it
[1:08:57] before the
[1:08:58] Lord he didn't summon together a a group
[1:09:01] of Believers to have a meeting to see
[1:09:04] what we should do in a council meeting
[1:09:06] and and decide as a committee how we
[1:09:08] should go forwards with this what did he
[1:09:10] do he took it to the Lord and He spread
[1:09:12] it before the Lord and he said Lord you
[1:09:14] know all of the circumstances of my life
[1:09:17] and and now this is what this king is
[1:09:19] trying to do and I want to encourage us
[1:09:21] brothers and sisters if we've got
[1:09:23] problems in our lives if we've got
[1:09:24] devils in our lives don't be afraid the
[1:09:27] devil is going to tell us you've got too
[1:09:29] much to do there's way too much on your
[1:09:31] plate you don't have enough time I want
[1:09:33] to encourage you to take the time to
[1:09:35] bring that letter that the devil is
[1:09:37] trying to boast in your camp and bring
[1:09:39] it before the Lord in
[1:09:41] prayer take the time to pray bring it to
[1:09:45] the house of the Lord come to prayer
[1:09:47] meeting and see if God is not God see if
[1:09:50] he won't honor your sacrifice do you
[1:09:53] know the greatest sacrifice that we
[1:09:55] could give him is our
[1:09:57] time that's the greatest Talent the
[1:09:59] greatest sacrifice that we could ever
[1:10:01] give him some might say well brother
[1:10:03] Barry I'm sorry for spitting I can't
[1:10:05] help but get excited some might say
[1:10:06] brother Barry I I work hard and I earn
[1:10:09] hard and I tithe hard that's not the
[1:10:12] sacrifice he's looking for you can say
[1:10:14] that to your children all you want your
[1:10:16] whole life and your children are going
[1:10:18] to say but where are you I don't want
[1:10:21] your money all I want is you that's all
[1:10:25] all he wants is us if you want to give
[1:10:28] him a sacrifice give them your time take
[1:10:31] from your time say I know I've got a
[1:10:33] full schedule I'm so busy that's the
[1:10:36] world we live in but see if he won't
[1:10:39] honor you maybe he'll give us the
[1:10:41] opportunity to have less to do and
[1:10:44] actually earn more from it because we're
[1:10:47] putting him first we're not putting
[1:10:49] other things first we're not putting
[1:10:51] Devils first we're saying Lord be God in
[1:10:54] my life am let my children see god with
[1:10:57] skin
[1:10:59] on Hezekiah had an experience he took
[1:11:03] this problem and he spread it out before
[1:11:05] the Lord and verse 15 says and Hezekiah
[1:11:08] prayed before the Lord and said oh Lord
[1:11:11] God of Israel which dwellest between the
[1:11:14] cherubims Thou Art the god even thou
[1:11:17] alone of all the kingdoms of the earth
[1:11:20] thou Hast made heaven and earth right
[1:11:24] Lord bow down thine ear and hear Open
[1:11:29] Lord thine eyes and see and hear the
[1:11:32] words of Sienna cherub and remember all
[1:11:36] of these Messengers aren't who he
[1:11:38] labeled he put it right back on The King
[1:11:40] and I think brothers and sisters it's
[1:11:42] important for us to remember we need to
[1:11:44] put it right back on the devil don't put
[1:11:46] it on the symptoms don't go for all of
[1:11:49] the symptoms for a topical ointment all
[1:11:51] along the way go right back to the
[1:11:53] source and say it's the devil
[1:11:55] this is the devil all the words of
[1:11:58] Sienna cherub which ha sent him to
[1:12:01] reproach the Living God of a truth Lord
[1:12:04] the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
[1:12:06] Nations and their lands you can see it
[1:12:08] with natural causes all around it's it's
[1:12:11] naturally there's no
[1:12:14] hope and have cast their gods Into the
[1:12:18] Fire for they were no Gods but the work
[1:12:21] of men's hands wood and stone therefore
[1:12:24] have they destroyed them now therefore
[1:12:27] oh Lord Our God I beseech thee save thou
[1:12:30] us out of his hand that all the kingdoms
[1:12:34] of the earth may know that thou art the
[1:12:37] Lord God am even thou
[1:12:43] only then
[1:12:45] Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos sent
[1:12:49] to Hezekiah saying thus saith the Lord
[1:12:51] God of Israel oh my that which thou Hast
[1:12:54] prayed to me against the king against
[1:12:57] Sienna cherub against this guy the king
[1:13:00] of Assyria have I
[1:13:03] heard brothers and sisters I just want
[1:13:05] to encourage us don't worry he hears
[1:13:09] he's listening and and I think he's
[1:13:12] actually agonizing to hear our words to
[1:13:16] him and when we get so busy in our lives
[1:13:19] and we just don't have words to him
[1:13:21] we're busy with everything else in our
[1:13:23] lives it pains him because he wants to
[1:13:26] bless us what a thousand times more than
[1:13:28] we're really willing to actually get
[1:13:32] it you know going back a little bit I
[1:13:34] just think it's really good I I just
[1:13:35] want to dwell here for a few minutes
[1:13:37] we've got a few minutes left I I didn't
[1:13:40] even get to any quotes today maybe next
[1:13:44] time maybe we'll get one in but just
[1:13:47] going back into uh 2 Kings chapter
[1:13:52] 18 verse 31 hearken not to hez a for
[1:13:56] thus saith the king of
[1:13:58] Assyria I just think it's real important
[1:14:00] to highlight this part here which I did
[1:14:03] in my Bible make an agreement with me
[1:14:05] let's make a deal right make a deal with
[1:14:08] me make an agreement with me by a
[1:14:10] present and come out to me and then eat
[1:14:14] every eat ye every man of his own Vine
[1:14:17] and everyone of his fig tree and drink
[1:14:20] ye every one of the Waters of his
[1:14:23] sistern until I come and take you away
[1:14:27] to a land like your own land a land of
[1:14:30] corn and wine a land of bread and
[1:14:33] Vineyards a land of oil olive and of
[1:14:36] honey that ye may live and not
[1:14:39] die isn't that interesting he's actually
[1:14:43] saying exactly what the children of
[1:14:44] Israel have already heard and they were
[1:14:46] already
[1:14:47] there I think it's just amazing how we
[1:14:51] can look at this and say wow this is
[1:14:54] exactly what the the Lord told him turn
[1:14:56] back to numbers turn back with me to
[1:14:59] numbers let's just bring it out in the
[1:15:02] scripture here I think it's so so good
[1:15:05] to show that the devil he's going to
[1:15:06] come with
[1:15:08] truth he's going to come with the word
[1:15:11] and I'll say this he'll even try and
[1:15:12] come with a
[1:15:13] message and try and confuse us and try
[1:15:17] and bring situations and problems and
[1:15:20] make us look at natural circumstances
[1:15:22] and think there's no way that this is
[1:15:24] right there's no way this could be God
[1:15:26] be careful yes sir God can be moving in
[1:15:29] people's
[1:15:31] lives but here we have this guy this
[1:15:34] this this guy coming and and saying that
[1:15:39] he's going to come and deliver everyone
[1:15:41] and and give them this this this land
[1:15:45] and and in numbers 14 verse
[1:15:49] 23 talking about the spies remember
[1:15:52] there was 12 that went up of them they
[1:15:56] said oh no the natural circumstances
[1:15:58] uh-uh I mean Naturally Speaking how
[1:16:00] could this ever be this is never going
[1:16:01] to work there was only two right out of
[1:16:04] all the Valiant men 23 and they came
[1:16:07] unto the brook of eshkol and cut down
[1:16:10] from then a bunch with one cluster of
[1:16:12] grapes and they bear it between two upon
[1:16:16] a staff two men had to carry that bunch
[1:16:19] of grapes they brought of the
[1:16:21] pomegranates and of the figs the place
[1:16:24] was called The Brook eshal because of
[1:16:26] the cluster of grapes with the children
[1:16:28] of Israel cut down from then and they
[1:16:31] returned from searching of the land
[1:16:34] after 40 days and they went and came to
[1:16:38] Moses and to Aaron and to all the
[1:16:40] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:16:41] unto the Wilderness of peran to Kadesh
[1:16:44] and brought back word unto them and unto
[1:16:47] all the congregation and showed them the
[1:16:50] fruit of the land and told them and said
[1:16:53] we came unto the land whether thou sent
[1:16:57] us and surely it floweth with milk and
[1:17:01] honey and this is the fruit of
[1:17:04] it they brought it all as evidence and
[1:17:08] they showed it to him and now here we
[1:17:10] have the children of Israel in their
[1:17:12] promised land with the king of Assyria
[1:17:15] coming and trying to tell them preach to
[1:17:17] them the same gospel they're already in
[1:17:19] their positions but yet he's coming and
[1:17:22] trying to make his boast what a terrible
[1:17:24] thing thing I'm just so thankful in our
[1:17:26] day that we had a prophet that actually
[1:17:29] came and and brought us into the
[1:17:32] parallel of the Book of Joshua and that
[1:17:35] is the book of Ephesians if you want to
[1:17:37] turn over there with me
[1:17:38] today I think it's real good for us to
[1:17:42] just sometimes have a little refresher
[1:17:45] to remember that it doesn't matter what
[1:17:46] the king of whoever is going to say
[1:17:49] whatever the devil is whatever his boast
[1:17:51] is is irrelevant he's going to try and
[1:17:54] bring truth
[1:17:55] truth but the truth is what's going to
[1:17:57] make us
[1:18:00] free you know out of the book of
[1:18:02] Ephesians chapter
[1:18:04] 1 remember brother bradam said that the
[1:18:07] book of
[1:18:08] Ephesians what does he say mostly
[1:18:12] parallels it he says it perfectly
[1:18:15] parallels the Book of Joshua Amen in the
[1:18:18] Book of Joshua God commissions Joshua
[1:18:21] right at the very beginning and says
[1:18:22] Don't Be Afraid don't be dismayed don't
[1:18:25] be discouraged but be strong and of a
[1:18:27] good courage because every single place
[1:18:29] the soul of your foot Treads is yours
[1:18:33] amen that's your position that's your
[1:18:35] promise land and we're in our day we
[1:18:37] have a prophet that would take us and
[1:18:39] lead us to the book of Ephesians telling
[1:18:42] us this is our promised land in the Holy
[1:18:45] Ghost so everywhere our feet tread in
[1:18:47] the word of God in the Holy Ghost is our
[1:18:50] possession amen it doesn't matter what
[1:18:53] the Devil comes around and tells us you
[1:18:54] don't got the Holy Ghost tell them to
[1:18:56] beat it I've got the Holy Ghost because
[1:18:59] I believe this word
[1:19:01] am I think it's just beautiful I could
[1:19:03] read the whole thing I I I don't know I
[1:19:05] don't think I want to today but just for
[1:19:08] time's sake verse four out of Ephesians
[1:19:10] chapter 1 according as he hath chosen Us
[1:19:12] in in him before the foundation of the
[1:19:15] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:19:17] Blame before him in
[1:19:18] love we're not we're not going to fall
[1:19:21] amen if we're willing to accept this
[1:19:23] word brothers and sisters you can never
[1:19:26] fall because he's chosen us to be holy
[1:19:29] and Without Blame period that's all he's
[1:19:32] he's predestinated us verse five having
[1:19:35] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:19:38] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:19:41] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:19:42] will aren't you thankful that God would
[1:19:43] send us a prophet in our day and say
[1:19:45] that this word adoption is not saying
[1:19:48] that I'm just going to go out into the
[1:19:49] highways and the byways I'm going to go
[1:19:50] to a an orphanage and I'm going to find
[1:19:52] a little child and I'm just going to
[1:19:54] take it and adopt it and and call it my
[1:19:56] own and give it my name and and we're
[1:19:58] just going to live our lives together
[1:19:59] pretending that we're the same family
[1:20:01] that's not what this word means what
[1:20:03] this word means is this was always my
[1:20:05] son this was always my daughter and now
[1:20:08] I'm going to take them because they're
[1:20:10] mature and I'm going to declare to the
[1:20:13] devil and all of the host of Heaven this
[1:20:15] is my beloved Son hear ye
[1:20:18] him now some people are going to say
[1:20:20] brother Barry you're going forwards and
[1:20:22] saying that you're talking about Jesus
[1:20:24] well who's in
[1:20:26] you that's right the devil don't want us
[1:20:29] talking that way people are going to
[1:20:30] start getting nervous when you start
[1:20:32] talking like that but let's call it what
[1:20:34] it
[1:20:35] is who is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:39] Jesus
[1:20:41] Christ having predestinated us unto the
[1:20:45] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:20:48] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:20:50] of his will
[1:20:52] amen we can't put anyone in or take
[1:20:55] anyone out because it's the good
[1:20:56] pleasure of his will brothers and
[1:20:57] sisters to the praise of the glory of
[1:21:00] his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:21:03] accepted and the
[1:21:05] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[1:21:08] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:21:11] sins according to the riches of his
[1:21:14] grace Hallelujah the devil's going to
[1:21:16] say look what you did look who you are
[1:21:19] look at what's going on in your life you
[1:21:21] can't get over it and you know what if
[1:21:23] you say yeah I don't think I can you're
[1:21:24] making a deal with the devil that's
[1:21:26] right but if you say I don't like it I
[1:21:29] know I I don't like it I know what it is
[1:21:31] and I hear it every single day when I
[1:21:33] hear that voice when I get that
[1:21:34] Temptation when that thing comes around
[1:21:36] and I can just simply say no I hate it
[1:21:38] no I don't like it and I don't want
[1:21:39] nothing to do with it when you have that
[1:21:41] desire brothers and sisters that means
[1:21:43] there's life still inside of you so long
[1:21:45] as you've got the desire get up get up
[1:21:48] and keep marching don't give up don't
[1:21:50] give in don't don't don't don't listen
[1:21:53] to the devil
[1:21:55] wherein he hath abounded to us in all
[1:21:57] wisdom and Prudence he's given us the
[1:21:59] ability to understand all of this it's
[1:22:02] not something that we need to poke at
[1:22:03] and prod at and say it's a mystery
[1:22:06] because verse n says having made known
[1:22:08] unto us the mystery of his will remember
[1:22:11] we talked about his will at length what
[1:22:13] is his will it's his
[1:22:15] word and it's not just a word in print
[1:22:19] it's the word that's been quickened to
[1:22:20] us through the word of a Vindicated
[1:22:23] prophet that's the word we're talking
[1:22:25] about the life of Jesus Christ in our
[1:22:29] Lives having made known unto us he's
[1:22:31] made known unto us what the mystery of
[1:22:33] his will is and it's according to his
[1:22:36] good pleasure again which he hath
[1:22:38] purposed in himself that in the
[1:22:40] dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:22:42] are we at the dispensation of the
[1:22:44] fullness of times I would say we're
[1:22:46] we've never been closer have we he might
[1:22:49] gather together in one amen all things
[1:22:52] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:22:54] are in Earth even in him I think it's so
[1:22:57] beautiful we look at that verse there
[1:22:59] how can we ever say that there needs to
[1:23:01] be division there needs to be walls
[1:23:03] there needs to be separation I
[1:23:04] personally believe when we start hearing
[1:23:06] those words and we start hearing those
[1:23:08] rumors what it means is it's not
[1:23:10] according to his will that's right amen
[1:23:13] because his will says that in the
[1:23:14] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[1:23:16] might gather together in
[1:23:19] one all things in Christ both which are
[1:23:22] in heaven and which are in Earth even in
[1:23:25] him and then he goes on to talk about
[1:23:28] how we have an inheritance and you know
[1:23:30] we're not just getting an inheritance we
[1:23:33] actually are an
[1:23:35] inheritance Jesus was given an
[1:23:38] inheritance by the father and he went to
[1:23:41] the cross and paid the price and bought
[1:23:44] our Redemption for all the
[1:23:46] transgressions that could ever happen in
[1:23:49] the life of a human being he bore it all
[1:23:51] upon himself and every single person who
[1:23:55] is called before the foundation of the
[1:23:57] world is his inheritance and he will not
[1:24:01] lose one of them because Jesus Christ is
[1:24:04] not just on Earth hoping and waiting for
[1:24:08] the father to actually say now I give
[1:24:10] you permission to do this and now I give
[1:24:13] you permission to do that like we might
[1:24:14] with our children Jesus Christ remember
[1:24:17] we know this this is Elementary Jesus
[1:24:19] Christ was
[1:24:21] God he he was God Only God God could
[1:24:25] actually step out of the back of the
[1:24:26] ship when everything was going crazy
[1:24:28] around all the storm there and just put
[1:24:30] his foot up on the bow and just simply
[1:24:32] say not even yell just simply say peace
[1:24:35] be
[1:24:36] still all creation follows the voice of
[1:24:39] that man who could do that but God who
[1:24:42] was it that walked up to the grave of
[1:24:44] Lazarus and wept oh my it was a man that
[1:24:48] had compassion for his brother he knew
[1:24:51] where he was and he knew how everyone
[1:24:53] around couldn't understand what was
[1:24:55] happening but we know the prophet in our
[1:24:57] day said when he stepped forward and put
[1:25:00] his shoulders back and puffed his chest
[1:25:02] out and he said Lazarus come forth that
[1:25:04] was all man but it was also all God
[1:25:08] because only God could do something like
[1:25:10] that why in whom we also have obtained
[1:25:14] an inheritance being predestinated
