[19:27] Welcome to the house of the Lord. Full
[19:28] house this morning. Lots of visitors. I

[19:34] the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus

[19:52] worship the Lord this morning. Just just
[19:54] be freed. This is Sunday. We can just
[19:56] kind of let our hair down, so to speak.
[19:58] Just enjoy the presence of the Lord.
[20:00] Invite him into your space this morning.
[20:02] Sing it with me if you would.
[20:06] You were the word at the beginning,
[20:12] one with God the Lord most high.

[21:09] without us.
[21:12] So Jesus, you brought heaven
[21:17] down.
[21:21] My sin was great. Your love was greater.
[21:25] Thank you, Lord.
[21:27] What could separate
[21:31] us now?

[22:15] before you.

[22:24] The heavens are roaring.
[22:28] The praise of your glory
[22:31] for you are raised to life

[27:50] open prayer for us this morning? Would
[27:52] you come? God bless you, my brother.
[27:54] Brother Ernie and I go way, way, way
[27:56] back.
[27:58] Brother Ernie is a brother to Mike Fzen
[28:01] who was part of the believer group. So,
[28:03] back in our home province of
[28:04] Saskatchewan. God bless you, my brother.
[28:06] Amen.
[28:09] Let us bow, saints.
[28:12] Our precious heavenly father,
[28:15] we're so blessed, Lord, to be able to
[28:18] call you our father.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, by your grace are we saved, Lord.
[28:24] We thank you for that precious blood
[28:26] that was shed on Calvary.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; To atone for our
[28:32] weaknesses that we might have. Lord,
[28:35] &gt;&gt; you know our weaknesses. You know our
[28:37] needs.
[28:39] You know every heart, Lord, that has a
[28:42] need, Lord. And
[28:44] &gt;&gt; you're the allsufficient God.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Creator of heaven and earth. You bow
[28:49] down. We bow down to you, Lord.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; And the very earth that we just sang
[28:55] that you created,
[28:57] &gt;&gt; you so graciously came that you could
[29:00] redeem us unto thyself, Lord. Lord,
[29:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not worthy of it, Lord. But
[29:06] &gt;&gt; you're the worthy one, and you created
[29:08] us in before the foundation of the
[29:11] earth, Lord. You already had us in your
[29:13] mind.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're looking for your appearing
[29:17] once again, Lord.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; You said that
[29:22] happy are they that look for that
[29:23] appearing.
[29:25] And Lord, our hearts are crying within
[29:28] us, oh God, for that great and notable
[29:30] day
[29:31] &gt;&gt; when we shall all gather with all the
[29:33] saints that have gone on before.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Thinking of our precious brother Ken
[29:38] that stood behind this desk.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, I remember him so clearly. Lord,
[29:44] &gt;&gt; my heart goes out, Lord.
[29:48] I thank you, Lord, for these memories,
[29:50] Lord, that you give us in our hearts.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. They burn within us, oh God,
[29:56] because of that life that was lived here
[29:59] on earth,
[30:00] &gt;&gt; that was worthy of the gospel of Jesus
[30:03] Christ.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for that worthy gospel.
[30:06] Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; I pray now, Lord, that you would meet
[30:10] every need here this morning and bless
[30:12] our brother as he stands behind this
[30:14] desk leading us in song. And Lord, all
[30:17] the musicians. And I pray that you'd
[30:19] bless the speaker that would come. Lord,
[30:22] that's what we're looking forward to is
[30:25] that word that would come forth and
[30:27] speak to our hearts and meet every need
[30:30] in our heart. Lord, that's our desire.
[30:33] Lord, I thank you once again for this
[30:35] gathering for all the people that have
[30:37] come together to worship you in spirit
[30:39] and in truth in heavenly places in
[30:42] Christ Jesus. And I give you all the
[30:45] glory and praise in Jesus Christ's name.
[30:48] Amen.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:52] Amen.
[30:55] Thank you, my brother. Good to be in the
[30:57] presence of the Lord Jesus this morning.
[30:59] Maybe shake someone's hand as you're
[31:00] seated this morning. Wish God's richest
[31:03] blessing.
[31:04] [Music]
[31:15] God's great bouquet this morning. There
[31:17] many representation. I think we counted
[31:19] one time that we've got 17 countries
[31:22] represented in Calvary Living Word, plus
[31:24] all the ones that came this morning from
[31:25] various parts of the earth that are
[31:28] fellowshipping in Edmonton. Wonderful to
[31:30] be around all the saints of God this
[31:32] morning. As our brother prayed, isn't it
[31:34] going to be wonderful to meet all you
[31:37] again? Never have to part. It's a
[31:39] wonderful, wonderful promise. It's not
[31:41] just a hope, it's a promise. And we know
[31:44] that he never fails to keep his
[31:45] promises. Blessed be his name this
[31:47] morning. Well, the sun comes up. It's a
[31:52] new day dawning.
[31:56] It's time to sing your song again.
[32:02] Whatever may pass. And whatever lies
[32:07] before me,
[32:11] let me be singing when the evening
[32:15] comes.
[32:18] Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul,

[43:18] Our dear heavenly father, what a
[43:21] beautiful sight we have here this
[43:23] morning. Father, each one coming from
[43:26] far and near, bringing their praises,
[43:30] bringing their sacrifices to your house.
[43:33] Father, we want to thank you once again
[43:35] for bringing Brother Danny all the way
[43:37] from Philippines with something upon his
[43:40] heart to come and speak to us. Father,
[43:43] we want to thank you for bringing
[43:45] brothers and sisters, Father, this
[43:47] morning. This assembly is full of them.
[43:50] They drove, they flew, Father, to come
[43:53] here to hear from you, not from Brother
[43:55] Danny. Lord, this morning, one thing
[43:57] that we want to do is to worship you.
[44:00] One thing that we want to do this
[44:02] morning is to praise you. We don't want
[44:04] to think about what you haven't done,
[44:06] but what you have done this morning. So
[44:08] this morning, we are full of praise and
[44:11] sacrifices to you.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Father, this morning, this church is
[44:15] full because of you. Not any man. Yeah.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; And Father, we continue to pray. If
[44:22] there's someone among us this morning
[44:24] that is feeling down, would you reach
[44:27] down and touch that someone?
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Father, we never meet without a need.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; As much as we never meet without a
[44:34] praise report, Father, may you receive
[44:37] every praise report in our hearts. Even
[44:40] if it is unspoken, you have done
[44:43] something for us. This morning we were
[44:45] able to shower and drove to your house.
[44:49] It is by your grace that we are here
[44:51] this morning. And as your word is about
[44:53] to come, may you prepare a place in our
[44:56] hearts to receive it. Lord, may we not
[44:59] look at one another but to look up to
[45:01] you this morning.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Once again, we are bringing our tithes
[45:04] and offering. We ask you to receive it.
[45:07] Bless it in Jesus name that we pray.
[45:10] Amen.

[47:18] believe Brother Justice, Sister Sharon
[47:20] will be here. Is that right? So, they're
[47:22] heading back, moving back to Africa.
[47:24] We're very disappointed that we'll be

[55:18] I think upon your goodness
[55:24] and your faithfulness each day.
[55:31] I'm convinced is not because I am worthy
[55:37] to receive the kind of love that you
[55:41] gave.
[55:44] God, I'm grateful for your mercy
[55:51] and I'm grateful for your grace.

[56:01] your soul,

[56:42] Who am I?
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Who am I to worship him?
[56:51] &gt;&gt; It's your blood that makes a difference
[56:54] in me
[56:55] &gt;&gt; and made a way
[56:58] &gt;&gt; and made a way to enter into your
[57:01] throne.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; I could not come near
[57:04] &gt;&gt; I could not come near your presence. I
[57:08] could never sing your song.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; I could never sing your song.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Y
[57:16] the sacrifice.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; The sacrifice on Calvary stream.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Everybody let's go. is the reason I get
[57:26] higher today.

[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe one more hand clap for all
[1:00:27] those
[1:00:29] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:00:31] Sisters and brothers.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you. What a wonderful contribution
[1:00:36] to the service. Stand with me if you
[1:00:38] would as we change the order this
[1:00:39] morning. We call our pastor. Word of
[1:00:42] God. One of my favorite favorite songs
[1:00:44] this week. I was just telling my wife
[1:00:47] just listening to the prophet through
[1:00:49] multiple services, but there's something
[1:00:51] that I don't know if it was just I
[1:00:52] imagine it was the Lord dealing with me
[1:00:54] specifically, but the Brandon would
[1:00:56] always refer back to the word. He would
[1:00:58] say something and I say, "Okay, that's
[1:00:59] interesting." And then he would say,
[1:01:01] "And there's a scripture in the Old
[1:01:02] Testament." He would just go back to the
[1:01:04] word, back to the word. And I just just
[1:01:06] what just was impressed on me this this
[1:01:08] week was this is a vindicated prophet.
[1:01:11] We all know that. But he had to be
[1:01:14] founded on the word. That's the only
[1:01:15] thing he could found himself on.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; And here we are this morning. What else
[1:01:19] are we going to found ourselves on but
[1:01:21] the word? Brother Danny brought it so
[1:01:22] well last night. The word is the only
[1:01:24] thing that is our absolute.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Our prophet taught us that. He was a
[1:01:28] word prophet. Here we are standing on
[1:01:30] that word this morning. Holy word long
[1:01:33] preserved. All the martyrs through the
[1:01:35] ages, all our brothers and sisters that
[1:01:37] paid and paved the way for us. Even some
[1:01:39] of the ones brother brother Ernie prayed
[1:01:41] and brother Ken and others my dad was in
[1:01:44] brother Bram's meetings but all those
[1:01:45] brothers paved the way. So here we are
[1:01:48] this morning we have a glorious gospel
[1:01:51] that's been delivered to us. Blessed be
[1:01:53] his name this morning. Sing it with me
[1:01:55] as our pastor comes.
[1:01:57] Holy word,
[1:02:00] long preserved
[1:02:03] for our walk
[1:02:05] in this world.
[1:02:08] They resound
[1:02:11] with God's own heart.
[1:02:14] Oh, let the ancient words impart.
[1:02:19] Oh word of God,
[1:02:22] ever true.
[1:02:25] It's changing me and it's changing you.
[1:02:30] We have come
[1:02:33] with open hearts.
[1:02:36] Oh, let the word of God impart.
[1:02:42] Holy words
[1:02:44] of our faith. They've been handed down
[1:02:50] to this age.
[1:02:52] They came to us through sacrifice.
[1:02:58] Oh, he the faithful words of Christ.
[1:03:08] It's changing
[1:03:11] changing.
[1:03:15] We have come with open hearts.
[1:03:20] Oh, let the word of God.
[1:03:26] Amen. God bless you today. Welcome
[1:03:29] everyone to the house of the Lord.
[1:03:32] It truly is an honor and a privilege to
[1:03:34] gather together.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; To worship the King of Kings
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; and Lord of Lords.
[1:03:40] This morning we have a few prayer
[1:03:42] requests that we would like to bring
[1:03:45] before the Lord. But you know, just
[1:03:48] before we do that, we would like to just
[1:03:50] take a moment and appreciate Brother
[1:03:53] Justice, Sister Sharon Rose, and the
[1:03:56] children.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; As they depart. Are the girls here
[1:04:01] today?
[1:04:03] All right. Right in front of me. God
[1:04:04] bless you.
[1:04:06] I usually uh don't look down because I
[1:04:10] don't want to stare at anybody too hard
[1:04:12] in the front row. But God bless you
[1:04:15] sisters. Um it certainly is with heavy
[1:04:18] hearts that we have to say farewell,
[1:04:21] not goodbye.
[1:04:23] We certainly know that the Lord has his
[1:04:25] hand upon the life. he has when they
[1:04:29] brought them here from brother Mike
[1:04:31] Wall's assembly in Washington DC and
[1:04:35] many years ago. Certainly thankful for
[1:04:38] the opportunity that I've had to
[1:04:39] fellowship with brother Justice. He's
[1:04:41] really made an impact in my life when we
[1:04:44] started our business in 2013.
[1:04:47] there was a little downturn in the
[1:04:49] economy and brother Justice just came to
[1:04:51] work with me and I felt so humbled that
[1:04:54] he would just want to spend time with me
[1:04:55] and we did some pretty interesting
[1:04:58] things with uh with appliances. But you
[1:05:02] know this morning I just would like to
[1:05:04] invite the Elatche family to the front
[1:05:06] of the assembly here because this is the
[1:05:07] last time they're going to fellowship
[1:05:09] with us this way. and I would just like
[1:05:12] to have a word of prayer with them
[1:05:15] as we wish them well.
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:19] If you don't mind, just enter into
[1:05:21] prayer with me. If anybody here desires
[1:05:23] to come to the front, by all means,
[1:05:24] you're certainly welcome to do that. I
[1:05:26] know we're packed here today, but we're
[1:05:29] seeing a part of our family leave, and
[1:05:31] uh we just want to wish the richest
[1:05:34] blessing of God upon them.
[1:05:41] going to come right down here and join
[1:05:42] you.
[1:05:45] Certainly hate to see you all go, but we
[1:05:47] know the Lord's leading you and we're
[1:05:48] thankful for his leadership in your
[1:05:50] lives.
[1:05:51] Yeah. Come on. Don't be bashful if you
[1:05:53] want to gather around.
[1:05:57] This might be our last time.
[1:06:00] You know, Brother Brandham says it.
[1:06:03] Don't wait. Don't wait to put a rose
[1:06:07] on a coffin. Give a bouquet while you
[1:06:09] can.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; And I remember brother Tim Mashong. I
[1:06:13] love what he said. I'm going to repeat
[1:06:15] it. I told him I'm going to copy it,
[1:06:16] too. He said, "Don't give me a tribute
[1:06:18] when I die. I don't want no tribute when
[1:06:19] I'm dead. If you're going to give me a
[1:06:21] tribute, do it when I'm alive so I can
[1:06:23] appreciate it."
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; And you know, the only regret that I
[1:06:26] have is that we haven't done more for
[1:06:28] the Elatche family in their departing.
[1:06:42] But as a pastor, I want to do the best
[1:06:43] thing I can do that I know how to do.
[1:06:48] And it's not just to pray right now.
[1:06:50] It's to continue to pray for the Elaji
[1:06:52] family.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Just like we have prayed for them.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:07:03] Gracious heavenly father, we love you
[1:07:05] today. Lord,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; we're just so thankful for this family.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Justice and Sister Sharon Rose.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Sister Victoria, Lord, Sister Jewel,
[1:07:17] Sister Joanne,
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, Sister Bethl, and Brother Isaiah.
[1:07:22] Father, we love the Jesus.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to unite around
[1:07:27] together with them, Father, around your
[1:07:29] word. Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just pray that you would
[1:07:32] keep your hand upon them, Father.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Every step of their life, Lord Jesus.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; We know that this is the part of the
[1:07:40] curse that we hate, Lord. That we have
[1:07:42] to say goodbye sometimes here on this
[1:07:46] side, but we know it's only temporal.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Because we will spend eternity together
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; because of your word, Lord. And this
[1:07:56] morning, Father, as an assembly, as a
[1:07:58] family, Lord, we just unite together
[1:07:59] around the Elatches. And we just pray,
[1:08:01] Father, that you would just continue to
[1:08:03] watch over them. Bless their way,
[1:08:05] Father.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Help Brother Justice as the head of the
[1:08:08] home, Lord, as the father and the
[1:08:10] husband, and help Sister Sharon Rose as
[1:08:12] the wife and the mother, Lord Jesus.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Father, bless the children. We pray that
[1:08:17] you would just help them, Lord Jesus, to
[1:08:20] follow stay in your word, Lord.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord,
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; all the days of their life. keep
[1:08:24] sickness from their home. Lord, just
[1:08:26] continue to
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; allow them to be in that cycle of
[1:08:30] blessing. Father,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we love you and we thank you
[1:08:34] for them. Thank you for the Elijah
[1:08:36] family, Lord. We just ask that you would
[1:08:38] keep your hand upon them.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Everywhere they go, Lord. That they
[1:08:41] would be a living witness of your life
[1:08:44] to the world around them. That they
[1:08:45] would take the blessing that they have
[1:08:47] given to Calgary Living Word and Father,
[1:08:49] offer it to the assembly where they're
[1:08:51] going now, Lord.
[1:08:53] Father, we love you and we thank you. We
[1:08:55] just want to ask that you would bless
[1:08:57] them abundantly, Father, above all they
[1:08:59] could ask or think about.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

[1:09:39] Let's just sing that chorus again. Word
[1:09:41] of God
[1:09:44] ever
[1:09:47] changing me,
[1:09:50] changing you.
[1:09:53] Here I come
[1:09:55] with open hearts.
[1:09:58] Oh, let the word of God.
[1:10:03] [Music]
[1:10:07] Amen.
[1:10:08] just have a couple of prayer requests
[1:10:11] this morning. One of them is from Sister
[1:10:13] Amber. It's for her son-in-law's sister,
[1:10:16] Aaliyah.
[1:10:17] She has been in the hospital with a
[1:10:20] broken leg and a complicated health
[1:10:22] history, and she needs a touch from the
[1:10:25] Lord.
[1:10:27] We also have a prayer request
[1:10:30] for brother Joshua's mother-in-law. I
[1:10:33] believe sister Emily Monk Mona Ken Ziki.
[1:10:40] She is uh travel looking for traveling
[1:10:43] mercy. She's going back to Congo on
[1:10:46] September the 6th. So we want to thank
[1:10:48] the Lord for brother Joe's mother-in-law
[1:10:52] and traveling mercies for her and
[1:10:56] Aaliyah,
[1:10:58] if you have a request this morning,
[1:11:00] maybe just make it known unto him by way
[1:11:02] of an uplift hand.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we
[1:11:07] thank you for your goodness and your
[1:11:08] tender mercies to each and every one of
[1:11:10] us, Lord, thank you for the specials
[1:11:13] this morning, Lord, because we know
[1:11:15] they're an expression of your life in
[1:11:17] the hearts of your children, Lord.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; And Father, to recognize that it all
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; is only about your grace.
[1:11:25] Father, when we can catch that
[1:11:26] revelation, it changes us.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; As we heard last night, we recognize
[1:11:31] that it's only humility that reigns in
[1:11:34] our lives.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Because there's nothing that we ever did
[1:11:37] to achieve your grace. Father, it's
[1:11:39] because you chose us in you before the
[1:11:42] foundation of the world to be recipients
[1:11:44] of your grace.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, it doesn't give us occasion
[1:11:48] to make grace a disgrace. That's not
[1:11:51] your spirit, Father. Your spirit is
[1:11:55] according to your word. And father, this
[1:11:57] morning, we just want to thank you for
[1:11:59] the atmosphere here. Thank you for each
[1:12:01] life represented, for each one who's
[1:12:03] made the effort to come and worship you
[1:12:05] today, today, Lord Jesus. Father, we
[1:12:08] just want to give you praise, Father,
[1:12:10] for touching Brother Juma and his wife,
[1:12:12] Lord, and opening the doors of
[1:12:14] immigration, Father. Lord, we know that
[1:12:17] you're more than able. You've done it
[1:12:18] time and time again. And we thank you
[1:12:20] for doing it one more time for brother
[1:12:22] Juma, Lord.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we pray that you would grant
[1:12:25] his wife traveling mercies as she comes.
[1:12:27] Amen.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Father, we want to remember Aaliyah,
[1:12:30] according to Sister Amber's request,
[1:12:32] Lord. She's in need of a touch from you,
[1:12:34] the great physician. Lord, we pray that
[1:12:36] the words of Sister Amber, Lord Jesus,
[1:12:39] would just be a blessing to this
[1:12:40] Aaliyah, in the name of Jesus, that you
[1:12:43] would touch her body, Father. Lord, that
[1:12:45] she would be able to come to know you in
[1:12:47] the power of your resurrection in this
[1:12:49] age, Lord. Oh, Father, that it wouldn't
[1:12:51] be a 2,000year-old resurrection, but it
[1:12:54] would be a a present tense I am
[1:12:56] resurrection in 2025.
[1:12:58] Heavenly Father, we just want to thank
[1:13:00] you for Lord, Sister Emily, who is
[1:13:03] traveling back to Congo now. Brother
[1:13:05] Joshua's mother-in-law, Father, Sister
[1:13:07] Becky's mom. We pray that you would
[1:13:09] grant her traveling mercies, Lord.
[1:13:11] Hallelujah. She's been a blessing to be
[1:13:13] here in the assembly with us, Father,
[1:13:15] and to the family. We just, Lord, we
[1:13:17] love you and we thank you. Now, we just
[1:13:19] want to ask that you would meet each and
[1:13:21] every need made known unto you today by
[1:13:23] the way of an uplift hand. Father,
[1:13:25] you've created us to be this way so that
[1:13:27] you could express yourself to us and
[1:13:29] through us. Lord, help us as your
[1:13:31] children, Father, to grow into that
[1:13:34] perfection which is maturity. Lord,
[1:13:37] Father, we love you and we thank you now
[1:13:39] as we turn our eyes towards you. Father,
[1:13:41] we pray that you would just be glorified
[1:13:44] in all that's said and done. Now,
[1:13:45] Father, help us all to just get out of
[1:13:47] the way and give your spirit the
[1:13:49] liberty, Lord, that you desire, the
[1:13:52] preeminence, Father, that you desire to
[1:13:54] have in our midst today. We just love
[1:13:57] you and we thank you, Lord. We ask all
[1:13:59] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:14:02] pray.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[1:20:37] the son of Heer, the son of Gilead, the
[1:20:40] son of Makir, the son of Manasse, of the
[1:20:43] families of Manasse, the son of Joseph.
[1:20:46] And these are the names of his
[1:20:48] daughters, Mala, Noah, and Hogla, and
[1:20:51] Mila, and Tiraza. And they stood before
[1:20:55] Moses and before Elizar the priest and
[1:20:58] before the princes and all the
[1:21:00] congregation by the door of the
[1:21:02] tabernacle of the congregation saying,
[1:21:05] "Our father died in the wilderness, and
[1:21:08] he was not in the company of them that
[1:21:11] gathered themselves together against the
[1:21:14] Lord in the company of Kora, but died in
[1:21:17] his own sin and had no sons.
[1:21:21] Why should the name of our father be
[1:21:24] done away from among his family? Because
[1:21:27] he had no son. Give unto us therefore
[1:21:32] a possession among the brethren of our
[1:21:35] father. And Moses brought their cause
[1:21:38] before the Lord. And the Lord spake unto
[1:21:41] Moses, saying, The daughters of Zilopiad
[1:21:44] speak right. Thou shalt surely give them
[1:21:47] a possession of an inheritance among
[1:21:50] their father's brethren, and thou shalt
[1:21:53] cause the inheritance of their father to
[1:21:55] pass unto them. And thou shalt speak
[1:21:58] unto the children of Israel, saying, If
[1:22:01] a man die and have no son, then ye shall
[1:22:05] cause his inheritance to pass unto his
[1:22:07] daughter. And if he have no daughter,
[1:22:09] then you shall give his inheritance unto
[1:22:11] his brethren. And if he have no
[1:22:12] brethren, then you shall give his
[1:22:14] inheritance unto his father's brethren.
[1:22:16] And if his father have no brethren, then
[1:22:18] ye shall give his inheritance unto his
[1:22:21] kinsman that is next to him of his
[1:22:24] family, and he shall possess it, and it
[1:22:26] shall be unto the children of Israel, a
[1:22:28] statute of judgment,
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; as the Lord commanded Moses.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add blessing to the
[1:22:36] reading of his word. Let's just bow our
[1:22:38] heads in prayer. Dear heavenly father,

[1:27:30] not happened before.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; So let's study. Amen. here uh in verse
[1:27:39] two he said in verse two let's see uh
[1:27:44] they stood before Moses and before
[1:27:47] Elisar the priest and before the princes
[1:27:49] and all the congregation of the door of
[1:27:51] the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:27:53] saying our father died in the wilderness
[1:27:57] and he was not in the company of them
[1:27:59] that gathered themselves together
[1:28:01] against the Lord in the company of Kora
[1:28:04] but died in his own sin and had no sons
[1:28:07] and then In verse four, why should the
[1:28:09] name of our father be done away from
[1:28:11] among his family because he hath no son?
[1:28:15] Give unto us.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give unto us therefore a
[1:28:21] possession
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; among the brethren of our father.
[1:28:27] No record.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. no reference whatsoever
[1:28:32] that a woman claim an inheritance that
[1:28:36] belongs to his father to their father.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the first time.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now before we go uh further on.
[1:28:47] Amen. So we see let's go back in verse
[1:28:50] one.
[1:28:52] Then came the daughters of Cilopia, the
[1:28:53] son of Epher, the son of Gilead, the son
[1:28:55] of Makir, the son of Manassef, the
[1:28:57] families of Manasse, the son of Joseph.
[1:29:00] And these are the names of his
[1:29:01] daughters, Mala, Noah, Hogla, and Mila,
[1:29:05] and Tarsa. You know, uh, nothing happens
[1:29:09] by accident in the scripture.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing happens by accident.
[1:29:13] Everything everything is pre-planned by
[1:29:16] the Lord. Everything being, you know,
[1:29:18] God being absolute God. Amen. uh uh uh
[1:29:22] knowing. Amen. Because if if God never
[1:29:25] knew what is from the beginning up to
[1:29:28] the end, he's not God.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, Amen. God is even beyond
[1:29:32] the beginning
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; and the end because he is eternity.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not only a A and Z.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he is a between A up to Z.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; And beyond that, he is the eternal
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; God. He's eternal. Amen. He just he just
[1:29:51] stepped into time.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is his own prerogative.
[1:29:57] That is his own uh h uh uh desire
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; for a certain purpose. Amen. To bring us
[1:30:03] back where we come from.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; All right. And so now you see in the
[1:30:08] Bible seldom names of women are being
[1:30:12] mentioned.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. Unless they uh uh they
[1:30:17] present uh uh something that is so
[1:30:20] special, something that is so prominent.
[1:30:24] Amen. So that's why in the book of in
[1:30:26] the whole scripture, we only have uh two
[1:30:29] books, Ruth and Esther. Amen. And this
[1:30:32] book of Ruth and Esther, both of them
[1:30:34] speaks about the great love stories.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we also uh uh make
[1:30:40] mention of of of Rahab. Amen. uh uh and
[1:30:45] also Rahab had uh uh had occupied or uh
[1:30:49] had uh accomplished something that no
[1:30:54] other women have accomplished during her
[1:30:57] time. Rahab, Amen. And uh we we read of
[1:31:01] Mary also and Mara. So Sarah, so they
[1:31:06] they they uh uh they fulfill some kind
[1:31:09] of a role. Amen. that would be
[1:31:11] monumental in the days to come.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; And now we can we can go back and see
[1:31:16] all these all these women uh uh uh
[1:31:20] expressing amen uh or or making manifest
[1:31:24] the uh uh the characteristics of the
[1:31:27] bride in the day and age that we are
[1:31:29] living in. Amen. So now these five
[1:31:32] daughters of Zilopiad, Mala, Noah,
[1:31:34] Hogla, Mila and Thza. Amen. uh even
[1:31:38] their names
[1:31:41] uh you know the name the name Mala if we
[1:31:46] look the the closest meaning to the uh
[1:31:50] uh to Mala Amen is
[1:31:54] forgiven.
[1:31:56] Mala means forgiven. And remember uh uh
[1:32:00] the five daughters of Cilope had
[1:32:02] mentioned that our father died in the
[1:32:07] wilderness because of his own sin. Amen.
[1:32:11] But there is a catching statement.
[1:32:14] There's a catching statement that the
[1:32:18] daughters of Zilopia had mentioned
[1:32:20] though he died. Amen. He said he was not
[1:32:25] Amen. in the company Amen.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; He was not in the company of those
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; that rebel against Moses.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; So he died. He made probably something
[1:32:42] wrong. But one special thing that these
[1:32:46] five daughters of Zilopiad remember so
[1:32:50] clearly that their father did not join
[1:32:53] the rebellion against Moses.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:32:57] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. What a kind of
[1:33:00] attitude, what a kind of characteristic
[1:33:02] we fathers, we parents can show to our
[1:33:06] children. Amen. That we have not been
[1:33:08] rebellious of the word of God. We have
[1:33:10] not been rebellious of the prophet. We
[1:33:13] have not been rebellious to our pastor.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is something. And in due
[1:33:18] time, hallelujah, our children will
[1:33:20] benefit from it.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Oh God, what an example these five
[1:33:24] children of Cilopia. But now, amen.
[1:33:27] Though he died in his own sin, now you
[1:33:29] will notice that that that uh uh the
[1:33:32] pur's daughter named uh named Mala.
[1:33:35] Amen. Which means forgiven.
[1:33:39] Hallelujah. So it must be the Holy
[1:33:41] Spirit that inspired him. Amen. To name
[1:33:45] his first daughter forgiven. Mala.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; But aren't you glad this morning you're
[1:33:50] not just forgiven?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is not just forgiven.
[1:33:55] The bride is being justified.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're, you know, we we
[1:34:02] everything that we have done before.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have been thrown in God's sea of
[1:34:07] forgetfulness.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we cannot even forget
[1:34:10] ourselves. Amen. We cannot even forgive
[1:34:12] ourselves. Hallelujah. But when we ask
[1:34:14] God, Amen. When God look red, our sin
[1:34:17] red that is our sins that are red. Amen.
[1:34:21] If he looks through his blood that is
[1:34:22] red, it becomes white. Amen.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And God will say, I don't remember any
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; I cannot find record
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; against you because we are justified.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now uh his second child and
[1:34:37] even the sequence, even the order of
[1:34:40] birth, Amen. Mala, of course, Noah, this
[1:34:42] is not Noah during the flood. He's a
[1:34:45] woman. And Noah, Amen. The name Noah,
[1:34:48] Amen. It means a a campaign
[1:34:53] or a in other words a revival.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Nice. Amen.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Noah means a movement.
[1:35:03] Amen. A great move
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; and some kind of you know last time we
[1:35:07] talked about a an attraction.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what have you first felt when
[1:35:13] you realize you're not just forgiven?
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; You're justified.
[1:35:18] Amen.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; As if you have not done it in the first
[1:35:21] place.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that Satan can charge
[1:35:24] against you.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; There is an in internal revival that
[1:35:30] have happened in our hearts that made us
[1:35:33] rejoice and and and and move. Amen.
[1:35:36] According to what we believe.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So a in Noah and that that
[1:35:41] means a revival is something that that's
[1:35:43] a great move, a great movement, a
[1:35:45] campaign. Amen. and and and and Mila the
[1:35:49] third daughter. Amen. It means queen.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; The queen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; And who's sitting beside the king?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; The queen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is therefore now
[1:36:03] condemnation and no condemnation to them
[1:36:05] that are in Christ.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; No more condemnation. Justified.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we are being revived. And
[1:36:12] then we move. Amen. And now we know
[1:36:14] where we are going. We know that when
[1:36:17] judgment comes, we will not be standing
[1:36:19] before the throne. Amen. Chilling and
[1:36:22] being afraid. Amen. Uh what judgment
[1:36:24] will fall on us? What's going to be the
[1:36:26] verdict against us? Amen. We are so
[1:36:29] confident. This message has given us so
[1:36:32] much confidence. Amen. That we will not
[1:36:35] be uh standing before judgment because
[1:36:38] there is therefore now.

[1:36:43] are,
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; if you know what you believe,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; if you know what we are standing for,
[1:36:48] there is therefore it's already a con
[1:36:50] conclusion.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; It's not just laying out the premise of
[1:36:54] something. It's already a conclusion.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Therefore is a finality.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; There is therefore

[1:41:14] trying to to say something
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; because we are God's apple of the eye,
[1:41:19] right?

[1:42:25] eye. That's the same thing. Amen. That's
[1:42:27] the same thing with our children. Amen.
[1:42:30] So that's why, you know, go back to the
[1:42:32] Garden of Eden. Hallelujah. They made a
[1:42:35] mistake. They they transgressed God.
[1:42:37] Amen. But Adam was the son of God.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the woman was part of the man.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.

[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Israel is God's apple of the eye.

[1:43:00] plan for them.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; That's the benefit.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And aren't you glad this morning

[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we fail,
[1:43:16] he doesn't see our failure.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; God sees our need.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; And he always has a remedy for whatever
[1:43:27] we do.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.

[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sarah insulted God. Me? I'm old.
[1:43:37] Shall I have pleasure with my Lord?
[1:43:40] Amen.
[1:43:41] But God was looking to Abraham,
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; his apple of the eye.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; And he knew if God will kill Sarah, he
[1:43:52] will hurt
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; because Sarah was Abraham's apple of the
[1:43:59] eye.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the power of it.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; But what happened to Mrs. Lot?

[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; But I'm sorry. Amen. So he's apple of
[1:44:20] the eye. Hogla means and then you go h
[1:44:24] and the last daughter the youngest which
[1:44:26] means hogla and that means worshipper
[1:44:31] because hogla means circling dancing you
[1:44:35] know worshiing. So hogla was a
[1:44:38] worshipper.
[1:44:40] So all these

[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all these characteristics are
[1:45:10] being contained by the bride.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know who we are, what we are
[1:45:15] standing for. We know
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; the bride knows what she is.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; And she knows what's to be done with the
[1:45:22] word.

[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's not just as I told it's
[1:46:54] not just a division of ownership. No,
[1:46:56] you're not husband and wife. If you
[1:46:58] divide your wealth.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever.
[1:47:03] Amen. The the husband possess the bride
[1:47:06] possesses.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Even in the sun. Amen. You remember in
[1:47:11] the story of the prodigal son. Amen. The
[1:47:13] story of the prodigal son, you know, the
[1:47:15] uh uh uh the younger, you know, took all
[1:47:17] his took all his wealth and went and he
[1:47:20] squandered everything. Amen. But when he
[1:47:22] realized, Amen. he was the son of his
[1:47:24] father. He came back and then here comes
[1:47:26] the older and he said, Amen. You look at
[1:47:29] that your son. Amen. He squandered
[1:47:31] everything and then he comes back here
[1:47:33] and then you uh uh you made the peace.
[1:47:35] You killed Cal and everything. I have
[1:47:37] been I stayed with you for a long time.
[1:47:39] Evan never left you. I'm here. When
[1:47:41] you're sick, I'm here. While your son is
[1:47:44] enjoying out there in the world. Amen.
[1:47:47] But then in my last birthday, you didn't
[1:47:50] even kill me a pot and calf.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the father looked at him and
[1:47:57] said, "Son,
[1:47:59] Amen. Son,
[1:48:01] you know you are my son. I am your
[1:48:03] father.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; I own all of this.
[1:48:06] And if you have the revelation
[1:48:11] of what who you are, then you know,
[1:48:13] Amen. Whatever I have, it's yours.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not my fault if you did not
[1:48:20] kill even a simple goat.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; It's not my fault. Hallelujah. It's not
[1:48:26] God's fault that if you're sick and you
[1:48:28] don't pray and claim your healing, it
[1:48:30] not God's fault. It had done it already
[1:48:32] for you. It has prepared everything.
[1:48:36] Hallelujah. Don't blame God. Don't even
[1:48:39] blame Satan.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Sometime you say, "Oh, Satan is
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; challenging me again.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Satan is
[1:48:49] giving me so much problem, all this
[1:48:51] sickness, all these challenges. Don't
[1:48:53] blame Satan and the devils. They're just
[1:48:57] doing their job.
[1:49:03] What we have to do? We have to do our
[1:49:04] job.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; We have to claim our position.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank the devil. Thank you
[1:49:14] for doing your job. You are perfecting
[1:49:17] me. I'm just you're you're the job the
[1:49:20] problem that you're giving me. You're
[1:49:22] just pushing me to the full adoption of
[1:49:24] son.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So all these things
[1:49:32] and that's why we have reason to
[1:49:33] worship. We have reason to rejoice. We
[1:49:36] have reason to go. Amen. And live and
[1:49:38] forget everything. Hallelujah. And and
[1:49:41] and the only thing that we have
[1:49:43] hallelujah is the confidence the the the
[1:49:45] comfort that we are sons and daughters
[1:49:47] of God.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now look. So see now
[1:50:01] in in in in verse two again,
[1:50:05] and they stood before Moses and before
[1:50:08] Eliza the priest and before the princes
[1:50:12] and all the congregation by the door of
[1:50:14] the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:50:16] saying, "Amen." So they presented their
[1:50:19] claim.
[1:50:20] Amen. Now, one good thing these five
[1:50:24] daughters of Zilope had, that's why I
[1:50:27] know they are taught well by their
[1:50:29] father,
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; is that when they have a problem, they
[1:50:33] know where to go to.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; They know who to approach.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; They went to Moses.
[1:50:44] They went to the tabernacle.
[1:50:47] They went to the priest.
[1:50:50] They did not look for another church.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; They did not consult another minister.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:59] They respect their pastor.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; And so now, Amen. And and and and so
[1:51:07] look at how Moses responded because
[1:51:09] Moses was a vindicated prophet of God.
[1:51:13] And if we put it in a little way, mass
[1:51:16] Moses was the pastor.
[1:51:19] Amen. So they approached their pastor.
[1:51:22] Amen. They went to the church. They want
[1:51:25] to settle the matter, settle the issue,
[1:51:27] present their claim. And that's the
[1:51:29] right thing to do. That's why brother
[1:51:31] Brandham said, "Our first obligation is
[1:51:33] to look for a home church."
[1:51:37] Amen. And he said, "When you have a home
[1:51:40] church, you have a pastor, give your
[1:51:42] full respect to the pastor because he
[1:51:44] can set you through." Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:51:50] So they present and look at Moses
[1:51:54] because they respectfully presented
[1:51:56] their claim.
[1:51:58] Yeah.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Moses did not jump into conclusion
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; saying, "Wait a minute, you women, you
[1:52:05] keep silent.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; You're not allowed to speak."
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We already have a
[1:52:15] system. We already have a pattern.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And this has been done long, long time
[1:52:22] ago. Amen. that the the the the
[1:52:25] possession of the father will be given
[1:52:29] to his son
[1:52:33] only male
[1:52:35] children
[1:52:37] receive the inheritance of their father.
[1:52:41] But Moses said well
[1:52:44] first time it come to my attention.
[1:52:48] Hallelujah.
[1:52:50] But you know because
[1:52:53] they approach
[1:52:55] right.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; They had the right attitude in
[1:52:59] presenting their claim.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we have the right
[1:53:03] sometimes we we are in the the the the
[1:53:05] right position but because the way we
[1:53:07] present and the way we you know just
[1:53:10] like uh uh uh uh uh the people amen
[1:53:13] years ago they approached the Lord tell
[1:53:16] us and we will believe you. Amen. They
[1:53:19] had the wrong approach. So they did not
[1:53:22] receive the favor that we they were
[1:53:24] asking.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But now now the children of God,
[1:53:29] Amen. They they are being taught, we are
[1:53:30] being taught how to approach the gift.
[1:53:34] And so they approach the gift. Amen. And
[1:53:37] Moses said in verse five,
[1:53:40] "Wait a minute."
[1:53:43] Amen. Let's pray about it.
[1:53:46] Amen. give me give me time. I'm going to
[1:53:49] consult God. So in verse five, and Moses
[1:53:54] brought their cost
[1:53:57] before the Lord.
[1:54:01] He never went to another bishop,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Cardinal,
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; or an elder.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; He approached God.
[1:54:13] Moses brought their cost before the
[1:54:15] Lord.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:17] Amen. And you know, he never mentioned
[1:54:20] to anyone in the church, don't be like
[1:54:23] these women.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; They're claiming something that does not
[1:54:27] belong to them.
[1:54:30] Amen. They have no record. They we have
[1:54:32] no pattern. Amen. To uh uh uh to to have
[1:54:37] uh their claim uh uh be implemented at
[1:54:40] this time. We have no record. But Moses
[1:54:43] said he brought their cause before the
[1:54:45] Lord. Amen. And that is always the right
[1:54:48] thing to do. We ministers, we present
[1:54:51] everything to the Lord because there's
[1:54:53] no one higher than God. In the church,
[1:54:56] the the brother Bam said the authority
[1:54:58] is the pastor. Amen. And who's higher
[1:55:01] than than a pastor? Amen. Only God.
[1:55:04] We're just under shepherds of the chief
[1:55:08] shepherd and that's the Lord.
[1:55:10] Hallelujah. And that is where we that is
[1:55:12] where we approach. Amen. We present our
[1:55:15] cause, our claim and everything. And you
[1:55:18] know if we present something to God, he
[1:55:20] is able to respond.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God has ear to hear.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] Thank you Lord.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:39] So now because of that look what have
[1:55:43] happened
[1:55:45] when Moses
[1:55:48] brought their cost to the Lord
[1:55:51] in verse three. Amen. or in in in uh in
[1:55:55] the next verse let's see
[1:56:02] we can see that something have happened
[1:56:06] amen to their presentation
[1:56:09] and God did something
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:15] so when God gives uh uh uh when we
[1:56:18] present things to the Lord Amen he gives
[1:56:21] us an answer
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; amen So let's let's read in verse 7.
[1:56:25] Let's see in verse 7 here. He said, "Now
[1:56:30] Moses brought their cause before the
[1:56:32] Lord.
[1:56:34] And the Lord spake unto Moses."
[1:56:38] I like this. And the Lord spake to
[1:56:42] Moses. And what did God say?
[1:56:47] The daughters of Silofiad
[1:56:50] speak right. Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt surely give them a possession
[1:56:59] of an inheritance
[1:57:02] among their father's brethren, and thou
[1:57:05] shalt cause the inheritance of their
[1:57:08] father to pass unto them. Right.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; The power of saying the right thing.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; The power of approaching the right
[1:57:21] person.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; The power of going to the right place.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; God
[1:57:30] said Moses. And here is the instruction
[1:57:32] to Moses. Moses. Amen. The Lord spake
[1:57:36] unto Moses saying, "The daughters of
[1:57:38] Cilopia speak right. Thou shalt surely
[1:57:41] give them a possession of an inheritance
[1:57:44] among their father's brethren, and thou
[1:57:46] shalt cause the inheritance of their
[1:57:50] father to pass unto them.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; It never happened before.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; It never happened before.
[1:58:06] No basis,
[1:58:08] no reference, no record on file.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; But God is absolute.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God is absolute. So
[1:58:18] God is saying something here. Amen. So
[1:58:21] because they spoke the right thing, give
[1:58:23] them the inheritance that belong to
[1:58:25] their father.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now it didn't stop there. Verse
[1:58:30] nine. And if he has no daughter, Amen.
[1:58:34] Then ye shall give his uh uh uh oh no in
[1:58:37] verse eight. And thou shalt speak unto
[1:58:39] the children of Israel. Listen, look at
[1:58:42] the blessing.
[1:58:44] Because of the five daughters of
[1:58:46] Zilopiad, Amen. that did the right
[1:58:48] thing, said the right thing, went to the
[1:58:50] right place, approached the right
[1:58:52] person. Amen. They were highly favored
[1:58:55] by the Lord.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And the favor of the Lord did not stop
[1:58:59] them.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in verse eight, and thou
[1:59:03] shalt speak unto the children of Israel,
[1:59:06] saying, from now on,
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. from now on, if a man die and have
[1:59:14] no son,
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; then you shall cause his inheritance to
[1:59:18] pass unto his daughter.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride is a game changer.
[1:59:26] [Applause]
[1:59:28] Amen.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Something new.
[1:59:35] Amen. And the blessing did not stop to
[1:59:37] their father. The blessing went to the
[1:59:40] children, to the daughters, and because
[1:59:42] of their attributes, their
[1:59:44] characteristics, know not knowing what
[1:59:46] belongs to them. Amen. So now the favor
[1:59:50] went on through the next generations.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. from now on and thou shalt speak
[1:59:56] unto the children of Israel, saying if a
[1:59:58] man die and have no son, then ye shall
[2:00:00] cause his inheritance to pass unto his
[2:00:02] daughter. Nine. And if he have no
[2:00:05] daughter,
[2:00:07] Amen. So it's spread out.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he have no daughter, then you
[2:00:14] shall give his inheritance unto his
[2:00:16] brethren. And if he have no brethren,
[2:00:18] you shall give his inheritance unto his
[2:00:19] father's brethren. And if his brother
[2:00:22] have no brethren, then he shall give his
[2:00:23] inheritance unto the his kinsman that is
[2:00:26] next to him of his family, and he shall
[2:00:28] possess it, and it shall be unto the
[2:00:30] children of Israel, a statute.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It became a law
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; that from that day on, it will continue
[2:00:46] on and on and on.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:51] Amen.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just just just just look at this.
[2:00:56] Just because of these five women that
[2:00:59] were taught correctly by their father,
[2:01:02] they have he they have seen. Amen. How
[2:01:05] their father stayed true to the prophet.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Although, you know, he had some uh uh uh
[2:01:12] uh uh uh because they said our father
[2:01:15] died in the wilderness. Amen. That's the
[2:01:18] only basis they had. In verse three, our
[2:01:20] father died in the wilderness, and he
[2:01:23] was not
[2:01:25] in the company of them that gathered
[2:01:27] themselves together against the Lord in
[2:01:30] the company of Kora.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. They did not revel against the
[2:01:38] prophet.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; You know, dying in his own sin can only
[2:01:43] mean, you know, he might have died in
[2:01:45] sickness or something. You know, he had
[2:01:47] his own fault.
[2:01:49] Brother Brenham had his own port.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Danny had, you know, I had my
[2:01:54] own. Hallelujah.
[2:01:56] Amen. But you see the only basis
[2:02:02] the only basis that these five daughters
[2:02:05] held in their hands in their hearts was
[2:02:08] that by knowing
[2:02:10] by witnessing the life of their father
[2:02:13] being so
[2:02:17] loyal
[2:02:20] to God by respecting the prophet.
[2:02:25] And if there is something that we can
[2:02:26] pass on to our children,
[2:02:29] that is how we respect the father of
[2:02:31] faith in this generation because he's
[2:02:34] the patriarch. Brother Benham said on
[2:02:36] the other side uh uh uh uh Paul and you
[2:02:40] know like the the patriarchs they will
[2:02:42] be and and and Paul will present his you
[2:02:45] know his aids all the rest of the
[2:02:47] messengers even brother Brham. Amen.
[2:02:50] Hallelujah. So look at this thing and
[2:02:53] you know Of course, you're familiar with
[2:02:56] this. You know, now you know sometimes,
[2:02:59] you know, uh uh uh our our society, you
[2:03:01] know, we're in trouble because of uh uh
[2:03:03] children delinquency, so forth and so
[2:03:06] on. But Brennham said, "No, it's not
[2:03:07] just children delinquency, but parents
[2:03:10] delinquency as well." Amen.
[2:03:13] Because now, Amen. you uh uh uh you know
[2:03:16] on the table, breakfast table, dinner,
[2:03:18] something like that. You know, it's
[2:03:21] our children should witness how we
[2:03:23] respect the office.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; So that is something that we can pass on
[2:03:28] to the next generation.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Look at this what
[2:03:34] brother Benham said. Now if you can't
[2:03:36] respect the man, respect the office he
[2:03:38] holds in God. That's exactly right. See,
[2:03:41] respect him.
[2:03:44] If a minister comes up, your pastor
[2:03:46] always respect him. I've heard
[2:03:48] congregations talk about their pastor.
[2:03:50] I'll just talk about him, run him down,
[2:03:53] ridicule him. How is that pastor ever
[2:03:55] going to do anything for you? He can't
[2:03:58] do it. Don't you I don't say this
[2:04:01] church. I'm not saying this church.
[2:04:05] Amen. I don't say this church, but I
[2:04:06] mean churches I have sinned. You've got
[2:04:10] to love your pastor.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; You've got to know that he's human
[2:04:15] being.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; But if we if the brother can help me, I
[2:04:20] like this portion here.
[2:04:23] He's a human being,
[2:04:25] but yet God has made him. Look at that.
[2:04:29] But yet God has made him his.
[2:04:33] Did you notice that? God made him his
[2:04:38] pastor,
[2:04:40] his prophet,
[2:04:43] his discipled ministry. Amen. So he's
[2:04:46] not just Yes, he's a human being, but if
[2:04:48] God chose him, if God called him, God
[2:04:52] made him his pastor.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; So every vindicated ministry is not
[2:05:00] called by men.
[2:05:03] God made him his.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; And if the ministry is his
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; whatever we do to his, we do it to him.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; God made him his pastor. The Holy Ghost
[2:05:19] has made him overseer. And then you've
[2:05:21] got to respect him in that manner. And
[2:05:23] no matter what the pastor done, if you
[2:05:25] respect him in your heart as God's
[2:05:27] servant, God will respect you for doing
[2:05:30] it. We have seen that to the five
[2:05:32] daughters of Zilope.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; I have basis
[2:05:38] something will happen because of
[2:05:40] respect.
[2:05:43] Amen. So I don't have to tell you and
[2:05:45] relate you what have happened to those
[2:05:46] children. Amen. That because uh they
[2:05:49] they insulted they mocked the you
[2:05:52] bald-headed prophet. Amen. And and you
[2:05:54] know they insulted the prophet and they
[2:05:56] you know they were so innocent
[2:05:59] and yet brother Benham said where did
[2:06:02] they learn this how to disrespect the
[2:06:05] prophet of God they must have heard it
[2:06:08] they must have witnessed that from their
[2:06:10] parents.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're sure that Zilopead.
[2:06:16] Amen. He did the right thing.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He respected the prophet the way
[2:06:22] he should. He recognized the ministry so
[2:06:26] much. Amen. And when there were so much
[2:06:29] rebellion and division and so forth and
[2:06:31] so and these prominent people were uh
[2:06:34] were planning something against Moses,
[2:06:36] Cilopad was just right there. He did not
[2:06:38] join it.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; He stayed true
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; the prophet and that was the only basis
[2:06:47] that these five daughters Amen. Pastor
[2:06:50] Moses, Prophet Moses, we have witnessed
[2:06:54] how our father have so much respect for
[2:06:57] you. How you know uh uh we have
[2:06:59] witnessed we have seen we have seen
[2:07:01] these rebellious men visiting our home
[2:07:04] talking about you. Amen. You have not
[2:07:07] you might have not known it prophet
[2:07:08] Moses but we were witnesses. We were
[2:07:11] young then but we would we we witness
[2:07:13] how. Amen. Our father stood his ground
[2:07:15] and said he was the called of men. Amen.
[2:07:18] Let us respect him and we have sin. I'm
[2:07:21] just giving you some kind of an
[2:07:23] illustration because this was their
[2:07:24] basis.
[2:07:28] He did not join to the company of those
[2:07:30] who rebel against Moses.
[2:07:33] Hallelujah.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why parents are fathers,
[2:07:36] mothers. Amen. You know, elders in the
[2:07:39] family. Hallelujah. You see how this
[2:07:42] kind of respect can pass on, can be
[2:07:44] transferred from one generation to
[2:07:46] another. If the Lord will tar in if our
[2:07:49] children, Amen. They have witnessed how
[2:07:51] we have great respect. I've seen our
[2:07:53] brother Ernie prayed this morning. Amen.
[2:07:55] We were we were just right there at the
[2:07:57] back and you know and and when he stood
[2:07:59] before you said I remember everything
[2:08:02] there's so much memories
[2:08:06] remembering brother Ken. Amen. So I
[2:08:09] could feel that actually brother Ernie
[2:08:11] that that gave me some kind of a
[2:08:13] confidence to preach this this message
[2:08:15] this morning. Amen. You know it's
[2:08:17] something that the Lord has inspired you
[2:08:19] when I stood before him before this
[2:08:21] pullpit behind this pullpit there's so
[2:08:23] much memories. What are those good
[2:08:25] memories that somebody long time ago had
[2:08:29] stood
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It remained faithful to the word
[2:08:32] of God and that is always something that
[2:08:34] we can look on. Hallelujah. Our previous
[2:08:37] pastor stood for the word. He never
[2:08:40] debated amen from any preaching of the
[2:08:42] message of the hour. Amen. us something
[2:08:45] to recon.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; What a good example we can live.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. By just respecting the ministry.
[2:08:59] Oh God, help us.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now the power is say there,
[2:09:05] you know, just like what we said and
[2:09:07] it's there's power in just saying the
[2:09:09] right thing and and you know all these
[2:09:10] things, you know, it went on through and
[2:09:12] on. Last time we me we made mention
[2:09:14] about sister hat. She only said the
[2:09:16] right thing.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; It was just a horrible conversation.
[2:09:21] Brother Brenham was testifying. They're
[2:09:23] just having you know drink, coffee,
[2:09:25] juice or whatsoever. Amen. Sister hater
[2:09:28] and their mother was were serving uh uh
[2:09:31] the brothers including brother Brand. It
[2:09:32] was just a normal conversation.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:38] Hallelujah.
[2:09:40] Amen. And let me borrow that story that
[2:09:42] you told me. Oh, is that okay, brother
[2:09:43] Barry?
[2:09:46] No copyright on that. Right.
[2:09:50] Amen. And he mentioned about our friend
[2:09:53] brother uh when Lawson because all these
[2:09:56] things had prepared my heart. Amen.
[2:09:59] We're just sitting just over a cup of
[2:10:00] coffee. But that story really uh
[2:10:02] inspired me. Lord, this is your message
[2:10:04] this morning.
[2:10:06] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And and by the
[2:10:10] way, during during that fishing, you
[2:10:12] know, perhaps most of you have known the
[2:10:14] story better much than me. Amen. But
[2:10:17] just to uh to give the uh bird's eye
[2:10:20] view on that, you know, they went to
[2:10:22] going to fishing and brother uh when
[2:10:26] Lawson had to buy a license and because
[2:10:30] he's not a resident of Calgary, Amen. Uh
[2:10:34] in order to get a license, they charge
[2:10:36] more. It can cost 245 or 250 or
[2:10:40] something which Amen. the uh the
[2:10:43] licensing agent is giving him an option
[2:10:47] in order for you to save. Amen. You just
[2:10:51] state that your address is in the
[2:10:53] address of your friend here.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just a normal offer.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; And brother Dwayne said, "No, I am
[2:11:05] willing to pay."
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:07] Amen.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Just to compromise
[2:11:11] and tell a lie. I'm not a liar.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have to say I have come give me
[2:11:17] a license. Here is the money. Here's the
[2:11:19] amount. I don't care about the discount.
[2:11:21] I won't compromise the truth.
[2:11:26] Amen. Hallelujah. But later on he
[2:11:29] realized that that was a trap of the
[2:11:31] devil
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; because you know something happened and
[2:11:33] you know there was something that a
[2:11:35] terrible accident have happened and
[2:11:37] something have happened at that time and
[2:11:40] I cannot h uh illustrate how it was but
[2:11:45] you know at that early brother Ken could
[2:11:48] have uh you know left the scene right at
[2:11:51] that moment. Amen. And brother Barry
[2:11:53] said he just he he he never knew what uh
[2:11:56] uh what to do. Amen. And he was shouting
[2:11:59] on the brothers. Amen. Don't don't move
[2:12:01] him. Don't you know something like that.
[2:12:03] And he just when he saw amen the
[2:12:05] situation of our precious brother and
[2:12:06] brother Barry said he just uh uh raised
[2:12:08] his hand, eyes open, look in the blue uh
[2:12:11] blue skies. Amen. And you know
[2:12:15] talking to God. Amen. And then brother
[2:12:18] Wayne Lson came. Amen. And upon seeing
[2:12:22] the situation, assessing the serious
[2:12:24] situation and the serious trouble, Amen.
[2:12:27] He just extend his hand, come let us
[2:12:29] pray right away. Amen. And just before
[2:12:32] the prayer was being finished, Amen.
[2:12:35] Precious brother stood and shake his
[2:12:37] head as if nothing had happened.
[2:12:39] Hallelujah. And if you look back, Amen.
[2:12:43] If that simple lying,
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. had been done just for the sake of
[2:12:48] getting a discount. That lying could
[2:12:51] have prevented the prayer to be
[2:12:54] answered. Come on. Hallelujah. The power
[2:12:57] of saying the right thing. God bless
[2:12:59] you. Tell our precious brother we love
[2:13:01] him and appreciate standing for the
[2:13:03] truth with that simple truth.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on, bride of Christ.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak the truth. Say the right
[2:13:13] thing, the right attitude, the right
[2:13:15] approach.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; The right message of the hour.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to be somebody that
[2:13:22] is so special. We are already special in
[2:13:25] the eyes of God.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now, Amen. Right. said,
[2:13:29] "Brother Brand, that's nothing but the
[2:13:31] truth."
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let I'm not going to repeat
[2:13:34] the story because I have told that
[2:13:36] before and you have heard that story
[2:13:37] before. But uh below that uh statement,
[2:13:42] Amen. Uh in paragraph 2002, brother
[2:13:45] Bernham said he said he said the
[2:13:47] suggestion there said crippled sister,
[2:13:49] her aged father, she was poor. She could
[2:13:51] ask for money. She could have asked for
[2:13:53] anything she wanted to. I said ask
[2:13:56] anything that's in your heart. Anything
[2:13:58] that you want to you ask it and thus
[2:14:00] sayeth the Lord, I'll speak it behind
[2:14:04] you and you'll have it.
[2:14:07] Amen.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now,
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; amen. Don't just look at what miracle
[2:14:14] have happened. Amen. With his two her
[2:14:17] two sons. Amen. But I want you to look
[2:14:20] at what is really the right thing that
[2:14:23] sister hatight said. Amen. The prophet
[2:14:28] made mention of two good options.
[2:14:32] You're poor.
[2:14:34] Amen. You can speak bunch of dollars
[2:14:37] will just fall on your lap. Amen.
[2:14:40] Healing it will come to pass. But Haiti
[2:14:44] Wright said the right thing.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Because she knew what she was standing
[2:14:49] for.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; And she had the right mind of God.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; So Haiti right in her rightful position
[2:14:57] knew what was most valuable right at
[2:15:02] that very moment. And let me tell you in
[2:15:05] this day and age we should know as a
[2:15:07] bride of the Lord Jesus Christ we should
[2:15:09] know where to invest.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is for the precious
[2:15:14] souls.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said hallelujah. It's
[2:15:17] not fair that we have heard this message
[2:15:19] quite a number of times. But there are
[2:15:21] people out there in the islands in some
[2:15:23] other cities that have not heard this
[2:15:24] message not a single ones
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; single time.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're so blessed. And that's
[2:15:31] why because we're so blessed, we are in
[2:15:34] the right position to say the right
[2:15:35] thing. We should know what is more
[2:15:38] valuable.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Healing is good.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; But people who got healed, they may die
[2:15:44] again.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; People get the blessing.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But by just simply getting
[2:15:51] excited, you know, there's another
[2:15:54] another model, another brand of cell
[2:15:57] phone, another car,
[2:15:59] it will come to not
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Haiti said the right thing
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; by basing that one opportunity
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; to invest for the salvation of her two
[2:16:13] sons.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:17] Others are questioning because they
[2:16:20] found out you know that this uh uh you
[2:16:23] know she asked for the salvation right
[2:16:26] and salvation is wide in the message
[2:16:28] hallelujah so I don't care how people
[2:16:30] can interpret that but as the five
[2:16:34] daughters of copiad spoke amen and
[2:16:37] presented claim for the very first time
[2:16:40] it never happened in the history of
[2:16:44] humankind
[2:16:45] hallelujah In paragraph 204,
[2:16:49] Amen. He said in 203, "And those two
[2:16:52] little modern teenage sneak boys that
[2:16:55] had hated the very cause of Christ
[2:16:57] grabbed one another and begin to scream
[2:17:00] the blessings of God. The power of God
[2:17:03] struck that place. Banks fell into his
[2:17:05] place. I don't know what happened for
[2:17:07] about 10 minutes." Amen. These two young
[2:17:09] kids, they never knew what happening
[2:17:12] inside.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. They had no idea. They were just
[2:17:16] in the parking lot playing probably. But
[2:17:19] there is a faithful mother who was given
[2:17:22] one last opportunity might be and he was
[2:17:26] she was able to use it rightfully.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He never missed that opportunity
[2:17:31] and she spoke the writing. Oh Lord,
[2:17:34] brother Benham. Hallelujah. I'm asking
[2:17:36] for the salvation of my two sons. And
[2:17:38] suddenly the presence of God, Amen.
[2:17:41] Hallelujah. Swept the whole building.
[2:17:43] There was such a special presence right
[2:17:46] at that very moment. Hallelujah. And the
[2:17:48] hand of God, the presence of God,
[2:17:51] hallelujah, stretched forth to the
[2:17:52] parking lot. Hallelujah. And took all
[2:17:55] these two sons. Amen. And they walked
[2:17:57] through the path at the middle raising
[2:17:59] their hand. Hallelujah. Holding one
[2:18:02] another's hand.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; And said paragraph 2004, friend, do you
[2:18:09] realize what was that? I have never in
[2:18:14] all my life
[2:18:16] had felt such an anointing.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; It happened for the very first time.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; I have never in all my life had felt
[2:18:27] such anointing. The first time I was
[2:18:29] ever it was ever performed in a human
[2:18:31] being. It bypassed aristocrats. It
[2:18:34] bypassed everything else. And went to a
[2:18:37] poor little old woman living up the in
[2:18:40] the hill there. God knew what she would
[2:18:42] ask.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; God knew.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; That's why she was given this kind of
[2:18:51] power to speak the word because because
[2:18:54] God knew what was in her mind.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; She He knew what she would speak.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; If she would have asked for $10,000, it
[2:19:08] would have been given to her. If she
[2:19:09] would have asked for her sister silly,
[2:19:11] it would have been given to her.
[2:19:13] Anything she would have asked, it would
[2:19:15] have been given to her.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And catch this. Paragraph 205.
[2:19:22] I believe
[2:19:25] that the church of the living God is
[2:19:27] moving into a sphere now,
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; not tomorrow,
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; now.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:36] I believe that the church of the living
[2:19:38] God is moving into a spirit now that's
[2:19:40] going to shake the whole world.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; That's the first time it's been since
[2:19:45] the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human
[2:19:47] being. Ask anything that you will and it
[2:19:49] shall be given unto you. Anything you
[2:19:51] desire. Don't you see the words of Jesus
[2:19:53] Christ being fulfilled. We have entered
[2:19:56] now into that spear. Speak the word
[2:20:00] right.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Speak the right thing.
[2:20:05] Know your position. Stand your ground.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It may not have happened
[2:20:11] before.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen. Hallelujah.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. The value
[2:20:30] of knowing what we are, who we are, what
[2:20:33] we're standing for. Amen. Thank you
[2:20:36] Lord. I believe that you know I have
[2:20:38] driven my point this morning. Amen. So I
[2:20:42] believe you know that the Lord has
[2:20:43] blessed us so much. Amen. But let me
[2:20:47] just uh uh uh uh bring you to another
[2:20:50] portion of the scripture because in in
[2:20:53] in verse one
[2:20:56] uh this is bonus.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:01] [Laughter]
[2:21:04] In verse one, then came the daughters of
[2:21:06] Cilopia, the son of Heer. Amen. Son of
[2:21:10] Gilead,
[2:21:12] Mckir, Anasse, Joseph. Amen. Now, if you
[2:21:17] if you look at it,
[2:21:19] Zilopiad,
[2:21:21] Amen. He was the son of Heer, son of
[2:21:26] Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasse,
[2:21:30] which is the son of Joseph.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Right now, in Genesis 48, Joseph had two
[2:21:36] sons,
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; It was
[2:21:42] Manasseh and Ephraim,
[2:21:45] right? So because Jose uh h uh Israel
[2:21:49] was old and so Joseph in respect he
[2:21:52] brought his two sons.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now because Joseph knew the
[2:21:57] pattern that the blessings
[2:22:01] go to the elder to the eldest son. Amen.
[2:22:06] and and he and and and he knew that the
[2:22:10] uh that Israel Israel's eyes was dim
[2:22:14] because of his old age. Amen. And so he
[2:22:18] made a decision based in history
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; based on on what had been happening long
[2:22:26] time ago that the blessing goes to the
[2:22:30] elder.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so uh uh uh uh Israel was
[2:22:34] sitting. Amen. And when he was sitting
[2:22:36] probably. Amen. And so he put he put a
[2:22:39] frame on the right hand and he put
[2:22:42] Manasse on the left so that Jacob or
[2:22:47] Israel would just extend his hand.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know what have happened?
[2:22:53] Amen. So when uh uh Israel was about to
[2:22:58] bless them, his hand crossed.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So brother Benham
[2:23:04] said, "But now notice what taken place.
[2:23:07] How glorious when Joseph after he
[2:23:09] married a gentile and received a family,
[2:23:11] Aphra and Manasse sons." Did you notice
[2:23:13] at the end Jacob started to bless Abraim
[2:23:16] and Manasse when he started to put his
[2:23:18] hands he put Abraim on the right Manasse
[2:23:21] on the left to get the right hand
[2:23:22] blessing to the oldest but when he
[2:23:24] started to pray his hands crossed and he
[2:23:27] gave the youngest one to the right hand
[2:23:30] blessing instead of the one that was on
[2:23:32] the right hand.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And for the first time
[2:23:38] Joseph said, "Wait a minute. Wait a
[2:23:40] minute, father." Amen. Maybe you know
[2:23:42] you had eye problem but this is the
[2:23:45] eldest. This is the oldest. Ephraim is
[2:23:47] already in your right hand right hand
[2:23:49] side. Amen. And and Manassi this is the
[2:23:51] younger. You should give the the full
[2:23:53] blessing to uh to the oldest. Amen.
[2:23:57] Hallelujah.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; But Jacob said no it's not me.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; My God crossed my hands
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; to give the blessing to Manasse. Amen.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Luke Manasse, Amen. All to go
[2:24:15] to Cilopad.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now we we see we the
[2:24:21] bride, the five daughters of Cilopia
[2:24:23] types, the bride and we are spiritually
[2:24:26] in that lineage of Zilopiad down to
[2:24:29] Joseph. And so we receive the full
[2:24:31] blessing.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:35] Hallelujah. No, it's not me. It's God
[2:24:38] who crossed my hand. Thank God for the
[2:24:41] cross. We receive the full blessing.
[2:24:45] Hallelujah.
[2:24:47] Amen.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's a bonus.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Let me give you another another bonus
[2:24:57] here.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:25:03] Brother, can you put this and I'm
[2:25:06] closing with this bonus.
[2:25:08] Ah. Amen.
[2:25:11] Uh,
[2:25:13] take my rifle off the wall.
[2:25:17] Take my rifle off of the wall.
[2:25:21] Hallelujah.
[2:25:23] Paragraph 33. On the wings of a snow
[2:25:25] white dove, preached in 1965.
[2:25:30] Amen. November. And this is one of the
[2:25:33] last few messages the prophet have left
[2:25:36] us. And it has so much meaning.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in paragraph 33, David, the
[2:25:43] lover of the wilderness, when he got
[2:25:45] distressed and the people wouldn't
[2:25:46] believe him and the enemies had come
[2:25:48] upon him, he said, "If I had the wings
[2:25:50] of Adav, I would fly out into the
[2:25:53] wilderness and there remain." How many
[2:25:56] times have I thought that same thing?
[2:26:00] if I could take my rifle off of the
[2:26:04] wall, my camp bag, go out in the
[2:26:06] wilderness, and never return again. I've
[2:26:10] asked the Lord if I can leave to see the
[2:26:12] day. I don't never want a funeral
[2:26:14] service. I said if I can just go out in
[2:26:17] the woods somewhere, set old Blondie
[2:26:20] against the tree. You know what Blondie
[2:26:23] is? He named that rifle Blondie.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:29] If I can just go out in the woods
[2:26:30] somewhere, set all blondie against the
[2:26:33] tree. That's my rifle. Excuse me. I said
[2:26:37] that on account of my wife sitting
[2:26:39] there. You know that rifle a brother
[2:26:42] here gave me years ago. I killed 55 head
[2:26:46] of game with it. Double grace
[2:26:52] without missing a shot.
[2:26:55] All right. Hallelujah. 55
[2:27:00] hitting through that rifle named
[2:27:02] Blondie. He never missed a single shot.
[2:27:06] Hallelujah. And and in some others uh uh
[2:27:08] preachings, Brother Brandham said, you
[2:27:10] know, when sometimes when I shoot,
[2:27:12] before I get to uh to the one I shoot,
[2:27:16] before I get there, there are already
[2:27:18] eagles
[2:27:20] get there ahead of me.
[2:27:24] So he shoot a creator for the eagles,
[2:27:27] the eagles to feed on.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is the same thing with us.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; He shoot
[2:27:36] and we're the eagles who benefit.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now let's continue on 100
[2:27:42] yards. I call it blondie because my
[2:27:45] wife's a brunette. So she said, "I think
[2:27:47] more of the rifle
[2:27:51] than I do her." So I'd like to set it
[2:27:53] against a tree and say, "Lord, let
[2:27:56] Joseph find it someday.
[2:27:59] I like to take the wings of a dove and
[2:28:03] fly away." I want you to see that rifle,
[2:28:07] not just a literal rifle,
[2:28:10] but it's the word of God.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "One day I'm going
[2:28:19] with that wings of the snow white dove
[2:28:22] and I'm going to put my rifle on one
[2:28:26] side of the wall." Amen.
[2:28:30] And Joseph will find it there.
[2:28:34] Joseph is the son of the prophet,
[2:28:38] right? But Joseph is not the only son of
[2:28:42] this message.
[2:28:44] Joseph types the bride.
[2:28:47] One day I'm living the scene. I'm going
[2:28:50] to follow the snow white dove leading
[2:28:54] the eagle.
[2:28:55] Amen. And one day you'll find my rifle
[2:29:02] blondie
[2:29:04] bright. Joseph will find it there. I
[2:29:08] believe
[2:29:10] Joseph had find it already.
[2:29:13] The five-fold ministry
[2:29:16] had found already the rifle blondie on
[2:29:20] one side of the wall and were shooting
[2:29:23] in it.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's the same thing,
[2:29:27] brothers and sisters, that those five
[2:29:29] daughters of found something. They
[2:29:34] picked up where their father left them.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our father did not go with the
[2:29:43] company of those who rebel against the
[2:29:47] message of the hour. Let's all stand up
[2:29:50] as we praise him this morning.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As we claim our inheritance.
[2:29:56] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[2:29:58] Brother Brennan said, "And he asked,
[2:30:00] Amen. Will Paul also Amen. present his
[2:30:04] age?"
[2:30:06] Amen. Yes. Hallelujah. Thank you. become
[2:30:10] musicians. Amen. And so and and and and
[2:30:12] said, "Well, Brother Benham said,
[2:30:16] I preach what Paul preached."
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I preach what Paul preached. And
[2:30:23] the boys, Amen, surrounded and said,
[2:30:26] "We're resting on that.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; We're resting on that. We're resting on
[2:30:31] this message. We respect on how we we
[2:30:34] respect this message of the hour and how
[2:30:36] the prophet had been so faithful
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; to this message.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on daughters of
[2:30:43] Zilopia. Come on daughters of this
[2:30:46] message of the hour. Claim your
[2:30:48] inheritance.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; Stay on your rightful position and speak
[2:30:53] the right thing.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Oh
[2:30:58] hallelujah.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can we sing that song?
[2:31:02] Possess your inheritance. Amen.
[2:31:05] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Can
[2:31:07] Can our precious Paul help us to sing
[2:31:09] that song? Amen. Come on. Possess your
[2:31:12] inheritance. And thank you so much once
[2:31:14] again. God bless you, my precious
[2:31:16] brother. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you for
[2:31:20] that story. Helps me a lot. Thank you.

[2:31:28] that have come a long way. God bless
[2:31:29] you. Appreciate you all coming over and

[2:31:49] know the song? Can you bring the words

[2:34:20] Sister Helen. Let's let's turn to 560.
[2:34:23] Count your blessings. I'll ask better
[2:34:25] barely to come. With all that we heard
[2:34:27] this weekend, what can we do but count
[2:34:29] our blessings? Who we really are and
[2:34:31] what we're raised up for. Blessed be the
[2:34:33] name of the Lord this morning. I enjoyed
[2:34:35] that so much. Enjoyed last night as
[2:34:37] well. Let's just sing the chorus as we
[2:34:40] call our pastor. Oh, count your
[2:34:44] blessings. Name them one by one.
[2:34:48] Count your blessings. See what God
[2:34:55] [Music]
[2:34:58] them one by one. Count many blessings.
[2:35:04] See what God has done.
[2:35:07] Are you ever burdened with a load of
[2:35:12] care?
[2:35:14] Does the cross seem heavy? you have
[2:35:17] called to bear.
[2:35:20] Count your many blessings. Every doubt
[2:35:24] will fly.
[2:35:26] And you will be singing as the days go
[2:35:31] by.
[2:35:32] Count your blessings. Name them one by
[2:35:37] one.
[2:35:39] Count your blessings. See what God has
[2:35:43] done. Count
[2:35:46] your blessings.
[2:35:48] Name them one by one. Count your many
[2:35:52] blessings. See what God has done. When
[2:35:58] you look at others with their lands and
[2:36:02] gold.
[2:36:03] Think that Christ has promised you his
[2:36:07] wealth.
[2:36:10] Count your many blessings. Money can not
[2:36:14] buy
[2:36:16] your reward in heaven. Not your home on
[2:36:20] high.
[2:36:22] Count your blessings. Name them one by
[2:36:26] one.
[2:36:28] Count your blessings. See what God has
[2:36:33] done. Count your blessings.
[2:36:37] Name them one by one. Count your many
[2:36:42] blessings. See what God has done.
[2:36:47] So amid the conflict with the great or
[2:36:51] small.

[2:37:22] done. Count your blessings,
[2:37:27] name them one by one. Count your many
[2:37:31] blessings. See what God has done.
[2:37:35] Hallelujah.
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; We all have blessings.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; Did you hear from the Lord today,
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; this weekend?
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous blessing it was this
[2:37:50] morning. Just to think that blessing
[2:37:53] came through Manasseh,
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; through the crossing of the hands,
[2:37:57] through doing something that had never
[2:37:59] happened before.
[2:38:01] And I just think it's so beautiful. We
[2:38:03] uh we know that we can look at it and
[2:38:06] say that it was a man standing here
[2:38:09] preaching,
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; but we've got to come to the recognition
[2:38:12] that it either was a man or it was God
[2:38:15] speaking to us the way that his word
[2:38:18] says.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; He's only bound by his word. I just
[2:38:22] think it's so beautiful because I do
[2:38:24] believe with all my heart the Lord was
[2:38:26] here ministering to us today. You know,
[2:38:28] brothers and sisters, today I just have
[2:38:30] one comment about it that he he even
[2:38:33] said it. You know, the she bear story.
[2:38:36] The children's lives were at risk
[2:38:38] because of the parents' conversations.
[2:38:41] And you know, he's the same yesterday,
[2:38:44] today, and forever. I just couldn't help
[2:38:45] but think that. Hebrews 13:8, don't
[2:38:48] worry about us. Worry about our
[2:38:50] children.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; The conversations that we're having, our
[2:38:53] children are hearing and the devil's
[2:38:55] coming for them. I just think it's such
[2:38:58] a an amazing thing. You know, it had
[2:39:00] never happened before. The the the idea
[2:39:03] that Sister Hadtie, right, she didn't
[2:39:05] just say the right thing. She had the
[2:39:06] right mind in her to ask for the right
[2:39:10] thing. And was it the right intellectual
[2:39:12] mind? No, it wasn't. It was the right
[2:39:15] heart. It was the right spirit inside of
[2:39:18] her to ask for the correct thing. Even
[2:39:21] though she could have had the worldly
[2:39:23] things, but it's just so beautiful. It
[2:39:25] had never happened before. I've got that
[2:39:27] written down a few times. It had just
[2:39:29] never happened before. And I can't help
[2:39:30] but think about the children of Israel
[2:39:32] in the book of Joshua chapter 3 crossing
[2:39:34] over Jordan. They were instructed just
[2:39:36] keep your eye on that ark. No one has
[2:39:38] ever gone this way. No one, brothers and
[2:39:40] sisters, has ever been in the position
[2:39:42] that we are today.
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; Nobody has ever been where we are. How
[2:39:49] how awesome it is to be where we are.
[2:39:51] How awesome it is to recognize that we
[2:39:53] are justified. Can we sing that song
[2:39:56] justified?
[2:39:58] I was sitting alone and wondering about
[2:40:01] what I was supposed to do. You know, we
[2:40:03] heard a little bit about what we're
[2:40:04] supposed to do. Say the right thing.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; Speak with confidence knowing that we
[2:40:09] have the mind of Christ.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; And if we don't know if we have the mind
[2:40:13] of Christ, ask him to show us
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; and I guarantee you he will. Amen.
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; My I was sitting alone and wondering
[2:40:22] about what I'm supposed to do. I can't
[2:40:26] deny the times I've made mistakes. I
[2:40:30] can't hide from him, can you? But I know
[2:40:34] that deep within my soul I feel sorry.
[2:40:38] Honest I do. So I try and try and say,
[2:40:42] "Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me again."
[2:40:46] And he will
[2:40:51] justified.
[2:40:54] You have not done it in the first place.
[2:40:58] You're justified.
[2:41:00] [Applause]
[2:41:02] Justified.
[2:41:04] [Applause]
[2:41:06] Justified.
[2:41:09] You have not done it in the first place.
[2:41:13] You're justified.
[2:41:16] [Music]
[2:41:18] So often I'm discouraged
[2:41:21] when I count the times I fall. Cuz he
[2:41:25] promised I'd be victorious
[2:41:28] when I know that I'm not at all.
[2:41:32] Then I heard an eagle screaming.
[2:41:36] His voice quickened my soul before I
[2:41:40] done it in the first place. You're
[2:41:43] justified.
[2:41:47] Justified.
[2:41:50] Justified.
[2:41:54] You have not done it in the first place.
[2:41:57] You're justified.
[2:42:02] Justified.
[2:42:05] Justified.
[2:42:08] You have not done it in the first place
[2:42:12] to justify.
[2:42:15] [Music]
[2:42:17] He looked at your perfect picture
[2:42:20] without blame, spot, or wrinkle. He
[2:42:24] didn't look at you where you are now. He
[2:42:28] looked from eternity.
[2:42:31] He said, "You're just trapped in that
[2:42:34] body. You bypassed your theophony.
[2:42:38] You have not done it in the first place.
[2:42:42] You're justified. He said that. Amen.
[2:42:47] Hallelujah.
[2:42:50] Justified.
[2:42:53] You have not done it in the first place.
[2:42:56] You're justified.
[2:43:01] Justified.
[2:43:04] Justified.
[2:43:07] You have not done it in the first place
[2:43:11] to justify
[2:43:14] the invisible union of the bride. He
[2:43:16] looked at your perfect picture without
[2:43:20] blame, spot, or wrinkle. He didn't look
[2:43:24] at you where you are now. He looked from
[2:43:28] eternity.
[2:43:30] He said, "You're just trapped in that
[2:43:33] body. You bypassed your theophony,
[2:43:37] have not done it in the first place.
[2:43:41] You're justified.
[2:43:43] Already seen it. Justified.
[2:43:48] Justified.
[2:43:52] You have not done it in the first place.
[2:43:55] You're justified.
[2:43:59] Justified.
[2:44:03] justified.
[2:44:06] You have not done it in the first place.
[2:44:10] You're justified.
[2:44:14] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[2:44:18] By his grace. You know, I just want to
[2:44:21] sing that song, that kind of blessing.
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; Don't you want that kind of blessing?
[2:44:26] The kind of blessing that we heard about
[2:44:27] today.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just want to say, brothers
[2:44:30] and sisters, we've already got that kind
[2:44:32] of blessing.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; We just need to recognize it.
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; Because once we recognize it, then the
[2:44:37] rapture will go.
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; My
[2:44:41] maybe help me start here.
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; Met the Lord
[2:44:47] upon that lonely night
[2:44:50] and wrestled there alone
[2:44:54] until the morning light.
[2:44:57] He won a princely title to hurt him for
[2:45:02] the right.
[2:45:04] I want Amen.
[2:45:08] Don't you?
[2:45:10] He fought for it.
[2:45:12] I want that kind of blessing that saves
[2:45:19] and keeps and it satisfies the soul. I
[2:45:25] want I want that full salvation
[2:45:31] till the pillows of heaven glory below.
[2:45:36] Amen.
[2:45:38] When Israel at last came into Canaan's
[2:45:43] land, the Lord his riches gave
[2:45:48] so full on every hand.
[2:45:52] They drove their foes before them and
[2:45:56] dwelt a happy band.
[2:46:00] Do you want to be a happy man today?
[2:46:02] Hallelujah.
[2:46:06] I want I want that kind of blessing that
[2:46:13] saves and keeps and it satisfies the
[2:46:18] soul.
[2:46:20] I want I want that full salvation
[2:46:27] till the pillows of heaven for me roll.
[2:46:33] Amen. This is the day of grace. The
[2:46:38] comforter is here. We are a chosen race.
[2:46:44] Our God is drawing near.
[2:46:47] He's waiting to Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:46:52] Hallelujah.
[2:46:55] [Music]
[2:47:01] I want I want that kind of blessing
[2:47:08] [Music]
[2:47:11] that satisfies the soul.
[2:47:15] I want I want that full salvation
[2:47:21] to the pillows of heaven for me.
[2:47:28] Amen.
[2:47:30] Amen.
[2:47:33] My
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; Can we sing Who I am?
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; Who I am?
[2:47:40] I just can't help but think that's what
[2:47:42] he was saying all all service this
[2:47:43] morning talking about who I am.
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; Who I am, Lord. Who I am. Oh, glorious
[2:47:51] victory.
[2:47:53] That day he set me free.
[2:47:56] And he made my heart
[2:48:00] his very throne.
[2:48:03] My life is no longer mine.
[2:48:06] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[2:48:10] And now I live
[2:48:13] to praise his name.
[2:48:17] Who I am, Lord.
[2:48:20] Who I am.
[2:48:24] I can see now
[2:48:27] who I am.
[2:48:30] I'm a part of my savior.
[2:48:33] I'm a part of his word.
[2:48:37] It's a revelation
[2:48:40] of who I am.
[2:48:44] On Calvary, he died to redeem his lost
[2:48:49] bride. The King of Kings
[2:48:54] became my savior.
[2:48:57] This is God's great mystery
[2:49:01] of his love expressed to me that Christ
[2:49:05] and I
[2:49:08] may be made one.
[2:49:11] Who I am, Lord,
[2:49:15] who I am.
[2:49:18] I can see now
[2:49:21] who I am.
[2:49:24] I'm a part of my savior.
[2:49:28] I'm a part of his word.
[2:49:31] It's a revelation
[2:49:34] of who I am. Hallelujah.
[2:49:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knows my name.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; He knows my name.
[2:49:44] Isn't that wonderful?
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; He knows my name.
[2:49:50] [Music]
[2:49:55] I
[2:49:56] have a maker.
[2:50:02] He formed
[2:50:04] my heart.
[2:50:10] Before
[2:50:12] even time began,
[2:50:16] my life was in his hands.
[2:50:25] He knows my name.
[2:50:32] He knows my every thought.
[2:50:39] He sees each tear that falls.
[2:50:45] and he hears me when I call.
[2:50:54] I have a father.
[2:50:59] Thank you, Lord. He calls me his own.
[2:51:08] He'll never
[2:51:11] leave me.
[2:51:14] No matter where I go,
[2:51:23] he knows
[2:51:25] my name.
[2:51:30] He knows my every thought.
[2:51:37] He sees
[2:51:39] each tear that falls.
[2:51:43] And he hears me when I call.
[2:51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The part of the service that we
[2:51:54] don't like.
[2:51:56] But the justice, could I call on you?
[2:51:58] Would you mind closing in prayer today?
[2:52:04] [Music]
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; Absolutely, brother. Thank you. All
[2:52:14] right.

[2:52:24] of you. Um me and my family we are truly

[2:52:44] Thank you so much. So let's pray.
[2:52:48] Our immortal king of kings, we thank you
[2:52:50] this morning.
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; We exalt your name for your
[2:52:54] faithfulness, for your loving kindness.
[2:52:57] We thank you
[2:52:59] for the preaching of the word.
[2:53:02] We thank you for bringing brother Dan
[2:53:04] Damino to us and sharing and
[2:53:09] your blessing upon us this morning.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; We thank you for
[2:53:14] [Music]
[2:53:17] how you open the scriptures again to
[2:53:20] make us understand that daughters are
[2:53:23] important as well.
[2:53:25] Father, we exalt your name this morning.
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, as we'll be going to our
[2:53:31] homes, everything we've heard, Lord
[2:53:34] Jesus, may it may you bring it to our
[2:53:37] remembrance, Lord.
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:53:40] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, help us to live by your
[2:53:43] word, Lord.
[2:53:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; Father,
[2:53:47] thank you for your faithfulness. Thank
[2:53:48] you for everyone here
[2:53:51] &gt;&gt; for in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:53:54] Amen. Thank you, brother.
[2:54:01] [Music]
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know,
[2:54:08] it's a long weekend.
[2:54:11] I know some people probably have to go
[2:54:13] and if you have to go, by all means, we
[2:54:15] don't want to keep you. But I just want
[2:54:16] to do something that's never done
[2:54:18] before. If that's okay.
[2:54:22] As we heard, there's blessings in that.
[2:54:25] If you need to go, by all means, I
[2:54:27] invite you to. But I want to invite the
[2:54:30] choir to come. Can you sing one more
[2:54:32] time for us?
[2:54:34] Just one. Would the choir mind doing
[2:54:37] that? This one of the songs you sung
[2:54:39] this morning, you pick whichever one.
[2:54:44] Is that okay?
[2:54:46] Am I getting too crazy?
[2:54:50] And we can sing along, too. They can put
[2:54:52] the words up. I I would like that. If we
[2:54:54] could do that one more time, that would
[2:54:56] just be wonderful. And after that song,
[2:54:59] just dismiss. We'll do it differently
[2:55:01] than we've ever done. I hope that's
[2:55:03] okay.
[2:55:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:07] And like I said, if you have to go,
[2:55:09] don't get nervous. Just go. We don't
[2:55:12] want anybody upset. We don't want to
[2:55:13] upset the spirit here. So, uh, if you
[2:55:15] want to stick around though, praise God.
[2:55:18] Thank you so much for humoring me. I
[2:55:20] appreciate it.
[2:55:24] [Music]
[2:55:43] [Music]
[2:55:48] Can you put the lyrics, please?

[2:56:05] When I think upon your goodness
[2:56:09] [Music]
[2:56:13] and your faithfulness each day,
[2:56:18] [Music]
[2:56:20] I'm convinced it's not because I am
[2:56:24] worthy
[2:56:27] to receive the kind of love that you
[2:56:31] give.
[2:56:34] Lord, I'm grateful for your mercy
[2:56:41] and I'm grateful for your grace.
[2:56:45] [Music]
[2:56:48] And because of how you've poured out
[2:56:52] yourself,

[2:56:59] praise. I

[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; Who am I to worship you?
[2:57:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; It's your blood that makes the
[2:57:48] difference in me.
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; And made a way
[2:57:52] &gt;&gt; and made a way to enter into your
[2:57:56] throne.
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; I can come near. I could not come nearly
[2:58:01] your presence.
[2:58:03] &gt;&gt; I could never sing your song.
[2:58:06] &gt;&gt; I could never sing your song.
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; The sacriice of
[2:58:17] [Music]
