Matthew chapter 14. okay we can read but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight away Jesus speak unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou if it be thou beat me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind Paul Saras he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him or thou of little faith wherefore this thou doubt then Revelation chapter 1. 17 and 18. and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his hand right his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and I have the keys of hell and of death then fast John chapter 4 verse 18. there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear has tormented he that feareth is not made perfect in love may God bless the reading of the world and you can have your seeds always you Saints those who are here and those who are watching who have tuned in on the internet I say may God richly bless you now this morning I want to talk about okay this subject I started I started it in late preach it's a long subject and I started in let's preach I will touch on it today and probably I'll do the conclusion of it in let's preach God willing so and it is about the title is fear not he is in the pot and the songs that we sang the summer the songs that we sang in the prayers that were Prayed by Brother Henry and brother Peter they summarized everything [Laughter] oh my what a wonderful God we saw you're not he's in the pot now the inspiration of this subject comes from the message I know my redeemable then also from another message called Awakening Jesus so for you to awaken him he must be in the pot and for you to say that I know my reading my liveth you must have that experience and that is all that we need that experience to say that I know regardless of the situation that I am in I know when you come to that point those are solid Believers that God is looking for now we are living in times of fear fear is everywhere the age that we are living in when the Lord looks down he sees a lot of fear and there must be a situation or else you cannot find me seated relaxing myself then you tell me fear not I I I I'll be surprised at what you are telling me so for you to tell me fear not you must see me in a situation that is not good for me then as a word of encouragement you tell me brother fear not so here the Lord Jesus Christ he comes and says fear not amen now the whole story you can also get it from the message called the testimonies now Jesus had done some Miracles he had 35 000 people with bread and they were satisfied then he decided to take a break away from the disciples he went to be by himself why did he went to be by himself he left and sometimes you can keep a testimony when things are good [Laughter] amen so they were having one time oh what a mighty God we serve oh these this this man this is more than a man I have never seen something like that that was wonderful but he had taken time to be by himself then the disciples decided to follow him to go where he was now they had to take a ship to take them to where he was why did they why did they started their journey in the initial stages of the journey things were good full of testimonies oh brother let me give my testimony oh sister let me give my testimony oh let me give my testimony that was good then the dark edges came the waves started becoming uncomfortable they started sinking then they forgot about the testimonies they had given but in all that situation Jesus knew the situation was under control oh my goodness if God can only help us to know that he's in control whatever situation that you are going in whatever situation that you are going through God is in control if only we can know that so things changed and the Bible where we have read it says he came in the fourth watch in the old times time was divided into watches of three hours now he came in the fourth watch now in the fourth words oh my goodness may God help us in the fourth word that is the darkest part of the night it is between 3 AM and 6 a.m that is the darkest part of the night and remember at that time it is preparing for the rising of the Sun so during that Darkest Hour of the night remember there is going to come ashalom there is going to come on Easter there is going to come the rising of the Sun so in that darkest part of the hour when the situation changed then Jesus Christ came and said fear not it is I be not afraid would you like to hear such a word from Jesus Christ it is I Be not Afraid whatever situation that you are going through remember be not don't be afraid [Music] so we can also say he took a journey to be by himself and he left us in our journey of seven Church ages now in that seven judge ages the first three judge ages things were good until there came The Darkest Hour the Dark Ages but remember after the darker edges there was going to come the rising of the Sun now when he comes he comes so that he could he can give you the confidence that whatever situation you are in is by your by your side [Music] now at desperate times he comes to declare that don't be afraid at desperate times no wonder the message the prophet preached the message which he called desperation if we can get desperate then he comes on the scene always he comes at the right time in the message be not afraid he says paragraph 11 . now I thought on tonight a subject of Our Testimony meeting out of the Bible and I want to read for a text out of Saint Matthew that that is where we read verse 27 and straight away Jesus speak unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid now I want to to take a subject for this testimony meeting of Be not Afraid there are two elements that control the entire human race in the world one of them is fear the other is Faith now it is either fear or faith that controls every nation every denomination every individual you are either fear or faith that controls you okay now there is no sitting on the fence you have to take one side either fear or faith may God give me Faith to trust him there is no sitting on the fence you have to take sight and you have to decide we are going to see don't worry now as we look at different situations in our lives there are so many situations around us there that has caused a lot of fear be it employment there is this issue of govid Now everywhere is covered and remember the prophet says what is what is what is going to come is worse even cancer will just be like a toothache so what is going to come is worse than even covet hello yeah so for there for him to come and say fear not there must be a situation that has brought fear now the whole world is under fear everybody you meet every everybody be they presents Prime Ministers what talk of anybody is afraid no wonder they sing a song and said men's hearts are failing for fear but as the world is under fear there is a group of people I wish I'm one of them there is a group of people that God comes and tells them fear not it is I he's in control I don't know if we are getting it he's in control of every situation you say brother you you say even the situation that I went through he was only he was in control yes men he's there he brings a situation he can only allow a situation to come to you because he has confidence in you he allowed the situation to come to job then he says he posts about job by telling the devil have you seen my servant job then the devil says Ah he trusts you because you have you have you have protected him just give me one more one moment but God had the confidence in the job and today God has his children that he has confidence in them he can post about them he can say have you considered have you considered my son Henry in Calgary he has confidence in them as we shall see how or why he has confidence in you amen don't worry just give me time we'll get to the we'll get to the bearing of the someone I'm just laying the introduction but for those who are in leather preacher I know that you've uh to this day that you know where I'm going but that was just part of it although brother mavin came and entered into that sermon he slashed part of it but I'll still come back and connect amen [Music] no there must be a situation and the situations will come situations will come to cause fear so that those who will be those who will be afraid they will be afraid they will just be living under fear all these all these all these but there is a group of people that God has confidence in them he can say I know that is my son amen now when God created human beings there was no faculty of fear why because we were created as gods and we had Authority Adam had Authority and as long as he had the authority everything was under his control he could speak to Nature and nature would obey him hello as long as he had the authority the prophet talks about the authority you can see a police woman however short or small she is as long as she has the crown once she leaves her hand a track of 24 feet long they have to pull why not because of the stature of the person but because of the authority and God has given us the authority I wish God could open our understanding to know who we are sometimes we sing We Know Who We Are but when the situation comes without ourselves so Adam had the authority and it is that Authority after the fall that was taken away and because it was taken away now our restoration is to go back to Eden where Adam had the authority is it possible yes God has proved it through the prophet that it can be done you can surrender yourself until God can use you to control nature where the Prophet says you can create your own world and live in are we ready some of the things we hear the prophet say we wonder if it is true but it is true when and if we have perfect word then it should reproduce perfect faith and the perfect faith is nothing but love when you come to that point where you have perfect faith when you are controlled by nothing but love then you can take control of every situation sometimes we wonder whether these things are true but this is what we have been called for eign then why should we live below our privileges foreign why do we cry see now in the message fundamental foundations for faith paragraph nine man was made as a secondary God on Earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was Adam Adam was given these great Powers but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell and Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife he would it would obey him he could speak to the waters ever whatever it was everything obeyed Adam now that is the beginning of man that is what God give him power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact that losing his relationship and friendship and the fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original origin again and Adam never had to be sick he never had to die he never had a worry he never had a headache he never had a fear he charged crimed up in the arms of the father and just like a child and everything was his and now when man fell he lost this and now what he lost in the fall Christ come as a redeemer did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to the Eternal fellowship and the relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall now the thing of it is since he has restored man back to this place man in the fall had lost all his consciousness of what father put him here on Earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it was in our praying and Outlets the faith has been clocked up with a business affair with a home life domestic things it all it has all become so clogged so clocked up that until God can't operate through those channels that he made Man full after the fall the channels got clocked we lost our consciousness of what our father made us for but if only God can open our eyes of understanding and the Prophet The Prophet's prayer was for our eyes of understanding to be opened for the channels to be unclocked so that God can use us so that we can trust him so that we can obey him amen may he help me to unclog the channels so that he can flow through but our channels are so cloaked that when he wants to flow through he can't we can't allow him to flow through but this morning if only we can allow him to unclog through the preaching of the word if I can unclog the channels then God can flow through me then I can see what he has made me for eign amen if God designed man's body he certainly designed the body of his son the church and he has designed us to come together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have this Supernatural workings of God out of it through gifts of the Spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and the gifts of healing and all these other different gifts is Outlets that God lets us his power and lets out his Revelation to the people and not as an in not as an individual so much but as a Unity we are all together great body of believers the Mystic body there is the body that is the church the local church but there is the mystical body you can be in the local body but you are not in the mystical body may God help us to unblock the channels so that he can help us to flow through until we see ourselves in that mystical body that the mystical body the the members are very few but the local bodies we can we we can we can create situations who have as many people as we want but my greatest desire is to end that mystical body to see myself in that mystical body that is what is important amen oh the word says by his stripes we were healed but we allow the devil to remind us of that brother or that sister who died of that disease we have an opportunity to go back again to where we can live a Carefree life without fear we have an opportunity that's why he came oh my now since man fell every time God visits him the greetings have always been fear not when he came to Abraham he told Abraham fear not in blessings I will bless you when he come to Moses he told Moses fear not this Pharaoh that you see he will not see him again amen when he came to capria when he when the Capri the angel came to Daniel he said fear not the day you knelt down to pray your prayer was answered can you imagine the very first time you knelt down to pray your prayer was answered so he was said to bring the solution but he was withheld by the demons when he came to America he said fear not when he came to Joseph he said fear not to take thy wife Mary fear not so when he comes he says fear not if he comes here this morning he will say fear not Little Flock fear not so whenever he appears people have always say oh the Lord appeared to me okay fine how did he greet you every time he comes he says fear not and for him to say fear not because he knows they are fearful situations and the circumstances [Music] now let's imagine like a child is screaming because of a nightmare but if the father comes and says don't worry son I'm around now the life that we live in its nightmares and that's why we cry we scream but remember he is in control when he comes he says fear not we cry fine but when he comes he says fear not it is I be not afraid oh my now from the scripture where we read Jesus came to write with them personally he came in the ship so that he could write with them personally and as as he wanted his children not to go through the circumstances with fear I wish we could see it fear not he's in the pot fear not he's here fear not he's with us Little Flock fear not whatever the situation fear not he's here whatever you are going through fear not he's in the boat now if he's in the port then we can awaken him you remember in that boat where he was he was he was dead asleep and the disciples when the situation changed they cried they had to go and awake him and the prophet in the message Awakening Jesus he says he is always there he's always there he's in our meetings so what we only need to do is to wake him up he's in you he's in me what I only need to do is to wake him up I I don't know whether we are saying this preference he's he's there that's the reason he came on Mount sunset he came so that he can he can write with us in the pot or in the ship so that he can be with us so that Saint John Chapter 14 verse 20 where he says in that day you will know so we want to come to a point where we can say I know that is the person who knows where he or she is standing you can say I know I know situation I know my regime I want to have that assurance that is the evidence of the Holocaust you know when it comes to the point where you say I know yes you can push me you can push me that is okay but beyond here I know my redeemer lives in that message I know the prophet says God has a purpose in you he cannot allow his purpose to be defeated oh my goodness he cannot allow his purpose to be defeated go and listen to that message he says when the Hebrew children when the king ordered for the fire to be multiplied seven times the Prophet The Prophet says as long as Court's purpose was there even if it was heated one million times one million times could not defeat the purpose of God so if you know God has a purpose in your life then why fear why fear the only thing you can say I know I know and that's where we need to come to president you come to a point where you say I know for he slay me though whatever happens but I know amen okay okay amen so fear is put up love we can have confidence in the man who came down on Mount sunset and he's in the boat today he came so that he can write with us laughs he came so that he can write with you in the board he is in the port you only need to do wake him up wake him up okay amen now in the message the preach between the seven Church H's and the Seven Seals paragraph 251. the prophet says but now in this world Sevenfold book of seals of redemption that the lamp took within himself was the only one who could do it and he took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now to claim his Redemptive to claim his rights to claim for me and you what he redeemed us from to see back to everything that Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden he has redeemed us back to that now with the lamp with a book in his hands we are ready to ask his grace and mercy upon us to open the seven sealed book to us and let us see past the curtain of time just a little bit oh my notice when he took the book the title did sealed just get that in your mind now and procure the sins of the mystery to reveal them to bring them to his own now when God created human human mind he created us a subconscious mind that is very powerful he created another faculty called imagination which is the creative power of human being I want that one to sing firstly he created you see there is the human mind and behind that there is subconscious now that is where the imagination is in your imagination you can imagine anything you can create anything in imaginations you can imagine a situation in that situation let's say I'm just giving an example you I can start imagining that brother Peter hates me so the devil takes that one he uses imaginations so the Devil comes and takes that and he creates a situation even when when brother Peter that is not aware of what is happening when I see him I avoid him you created the situation in your imagination and in that imagination now the Devil comes and takes that situation he magnifies it so he he creates that situation he makes it look so bad now in that imagination you can create the worst situation or the best situation so how do you overcome that the prophet says do the opposite when the Devil comes and tells you put your brother can it happen do the opposite so that subconsciousness that imagination that is where the devil takes advantage when you imagine something you are subconsciousness records it as real just give me time we will get there that's how situations arises you can see Believers hurting others it's just because of creating situations you create a situation and the Devil comes and takes advantage he magnifies that situation then it becomes so real until oh my and that's why the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so he said what you are imagining what you are imagining even right now what you are imagining the devil takes advantage that is the channel That the the devotees advantage your imagination you start creating some situations you imagine some situations then the devil magnifies that situation may God help us the prophet told us do the opposite okay when the fall came the devil took our creative power to create his own situations he tapped into our imaginations when a human being imagine something and holds onto it for so long it becomes so real and then he starts acting on that God help us okay now the origin okay in control of our imaginations and sometimes we invite situations in our lives by imagining them yeah you start imagining something you continue thinking about it it continues it continues until it becomes real may God help me I would like this subject we go deeper so that we cast out demons in our in our meetings we cast out fear in our in our meetings we want we are we are God's children we are we are we are in the rapture we are candidates for the Rapture so there should be nothing between us amen [Music] okay now in the message perfect Faith paragraph 105. Peter he was doing all right till he got scared the word told him he could walk on the water he was scared fast he thought it was it was a cost and he said Lord if it be you beat me to come to the water Peter Lord if it is you beat me to come what did Jesus say come may God help us if you ask the way Peter asked if it is you beat me to come he was told to come and it's only Peter apart from the Lord Jesus Christ it's only Peter that we know of a man who walked on the waters so the prophet says he was doing all right until he started looking at the circumstances it reminds me the story of some two Believers some two brothers they went to pray so they started praying they started praying then one uh he he ran short of what to pray for so in the process if you are not praying then you are listening to what the other the other brother is praying so when the other brother was praying he was saying Lord if it is you who called me let me not waste your time fill me with the Holy Ghost and let me not waste your time fill me the whole with the Holocaust I want an assurance I want to know that I am U.S and the U.S alone let me not leave this place until you have given me the assurance he could not leave that place the same way the same the same the same person he went now let's change the situation if it is God who called you can we also challenge him to keep to fill us with the Holocaust can we challenge him we need to get to a point where we challenge him if that bad brother challenged God until he could not leave that place the way he went and we are also the same we can also do this then we get out of fear hello if it is you if it is him who called you you are not here by chance if you are here by chance you live by Chance the same way you came the same way you go hello please I hope you will forgive me but I want this this point to sink because remember we said that they are not there is no standing in the middle it is either Faith or doubt now if we are going to take Faith then we need to challenge God we need to come to a point where we can say Lord let's see let's they say like Peter if it is you beat me to come can we also ask the same can we if it is him who called you if it is him who called me then I need to come to a point where I can say I know my little madivas I know sorry for shouting but can we act like Peter can we say like a Peter if it is you who called me I'm not here by chance I know he called me I know he called me now he cannot call you to be lukewarm no he called you to manifest his name he called you to manifest his life here on Earth so if he called me then I need to come to a point whereby I can challenge him there are no there is no standing in the middle you can just you can step on this side or no no no no no no it is either fear or faith I want to take Faith I want to take Faith are we ready brethrens Sue I I I don't want to think so much about that that brother first of all let me let me have that Assurance myself that I know are we ready can we can we do something about our lives can we come to that point where we want to say like Peter if it is you who called me if you did not just find yourself Inside by chance no but you know he called you I know we have some some Believers in our meetings they know they know and I don't want to live on the testimony of others I want to have my own testimony can it happen can it happen oh my God help me may God help us let's come to that point of desperation let's come to that point of desperation I want to know that I know that I know God help us so uh he was scared fast he thought it was a cost then he said Lord if it be you beat me come to you when he beats you to come you don't go to the church you go to him whoa now that is just as this the same as James 5 14 same as Mark 16 the same God said it said come on and he started walking he done all right he called down of the ship he started walking there was a storm on the sea you know Great White Cap waves bigger than these hills around here the form breaking on top of them terrific maybe 15 20 feet from the white cups breaking and that was a terrific thing for him to ask if it Be You Lord come if it be you oh now if it if it is you beat me to come on to on the water Jesus said come on and he stepped down it's the Lord I will just walk but when he caught his eyes on the waves he got scared when you turn your eyes to the situations that's where fear comes in but as long as he was he was supposed to fix his eyes on Jesus the one who told him come so if we can fix our eyes on him the one who told you come the one who bid you come then don't look at the circumstances the circumstances will be there but let us look at the one and to him that called us and to him that beat us to come he didn't call us to go to church he called us to go to him why so that you know him the way job said I know then you have the assurance that he's in the ship amen oh my it is not enough to say that God has sent us a prophet it is not enough to say that he came on Mount sunset but we need our profession and the substance to be sure and that can only happen if we forget about the circumstances the circumstances will be there the situations will be there they will come sometimes you don't invite them they will come but let that not deviate you from the one who called you and the one who called you he's in the ship we can awaken him we can awaken him even now brother maybe you cannot awaken him yeah you can awaken him you can awaken him he's in the boat he's there he's only waiting for you to awake him oh my hey man oh my okay now fear has no evaluation in it none whatever it's perfectly endless it hasn't got one good thing about it if it was to if I was to be shot in the morning I was going to be short what good would it do to have fear what good would it do to me you say well what good would Faith do to you Faith could deliver me but fear won't help me a bit you just get yourself all worked up and more nervous than ever when it comes time for the Khan to fire so let's have faith faith could deliver me but if it doesn't what good would fear do anyhow just stay right with faith and hold on to it foreign in the message show us the father paragraph 55 God doesn't have to use for a coward if you are afraid to trust him don't even make an effort until you are satisfied that he keeps his word and he keeps his promise then there is nothing going to stop you that is right but be sure you know where you are standing be sure you know where you are standing oh my okay then that brings me to brings me to this story okay you must know where you are standing because you will only make yourself worse then I noticed him he's talking of an eagle aren't you afraid of me I had my right riffle set against a tree I said I can grab my rifle rifle and shoot you and he just sat there and I noticed what why why why is he not afraid and I noticed that he had his wings he kept feeling them see if the feeders was all in running order I thought that is it God has given him two Wings he has got confidence in them he knows that he could be in that Timber before I get my my hand on the on the gun and he has got perfect confidence in his god-given way of escape and if an ego in God's Universe can have enough confidence in a god-given gift of his wings how much much more or to we the children of God to have confidence in the Holy Spirit even though the doctor says you are going to die with cancer just as long as you can feel that power of God there let everything be alive and God's word be true I watched him I thought there you are gone I see you know you know because he has he is not afraid God Hates a Coward love casts out fear so if you have got love you don't have any fear there is nothing fear don't have one bit of value about it there is not one thing it will hinder you or you say well what if you are going to be shot in the morning would you be a scared no sir fear couldn't help me fear could only make me worse well what could Faith do for you if they are already assigned that you are going to die in the morning faith can sign a pattern for me and so in that story The Prophet is talking of an ego he saw him he was just relaxed he was not scared so the prophet is saying that ego he knew he had confidence in his god-given way of Escape he trusted in his wings so whatever was going in the mind of the Prophet the ego was saying I have confidence he could just feel the wings are they ready oh I can fly are you sure you can fly oh yes I can feel I know I know may God help us oh my that's the confidence that God needs with his children I know my okay oh my now how do we come to that confidence eat the book eat the book eat the book eat the book until you become the book once you become the book then you have that assurance where you can say I know oh my okay okay amen now when he came in the ship he came to be worshiped he didn't come to listen to the believer's problems but he came to be worshiped he is in the boat today God loves a Covington Christian who stands on God's promises do we have our promises that song you sang it's nothing compares to the promise I have so if you if that promise is sure then you have confidence in that promise what is that promise we'll never leave you nor forsake you he will be with you even in you so can you feel him is in you amen fit on the book eat until the pyramid is cupped what cups the pyramid love God bless you my brother are we are we ready presidents in the book until the pyramid is kept and the pyramid is kept with love once the pyramid is kept with love then you can project that love to any situation oh yes where did the situation come these situations will come so because the situations will come get the book until the pyramid is kept with love can it happen it happened with the prophet we don't have time to go into those to read those quotes all those quotes the prophet he exercised that love when he was approached by the bull it was so fear what happened he projected that love when he was in the church preaching and that man he said use naked whatever what happened he did not hurt the man he loved the man he headed the spirit the demons that the man had subjected himself to so if the prophet was the first fruit to mature yes if he matured to project that love then where are we let me ask my where am I then it calls you and me my brother and my sister to need to come to a point where you can say I know and that cannot come by just you sitting there you just can't sit there remember the prophet says take time to pray in the fourth watch [Laughter] yeah take time to pray in the fourth watch so there is something to do with praying in the fourth watch yes may God help us so fit on the word eat the book any chance you have eat the book until the pyramid is cupped with love overcoming fear doesn't mean absence of circumstances no but when you feed on the seven done on the seven Thunders and keep on feeding you come to that perfect love [Music] oh my in these fearful times where we Face fearful situations economy covet or whatever God ordained you to be an overcomer so what you need to do eat the what what upon what what upon what until Divine Love Takes Over that is my prayer I want to eat until Divine Love Takes Over so when Divine Love Takes Over You cannot now look at the situations you cannot imagine you can now not put things under your imaginations you create a situation you allow the devil to create situations in your imaginations no you only allow love to take off and it can happen it can happen preference have you ever come as in a situation you you enter somewhere maybe people are talking about worldly things but the moment you enter your presence end us there they change the subject it can happen it is happening among us to us if only we can allow ourselves to unclog the channels so that God can flow through flow through me flow through me oh my okay amen oh my okay I have to rush overcoming fear is not called removing difficult situations in our lives but we can overcome by casting out fear completely did you get it overcoming fear is not God removing difficulty situations but we can overcome past by casting out fear fear is the slave of circumstances but faith is the master of circumstances Hallelujah fear Is This Love of circumstances but faith is the master this does allow the master to come let me allow the master to come who now circumstances are in the middle yeah but the faith is in the seven sealed book there is only one thing that is the devil fears yeah there is always one thing that you feel fears yeah fears the open book because without open the book you are restored Back to Eden where Adam was without fear let's eat the book this book has been given to us this book has been opened to us for what purpose to restore us back to what Adam lost we are eating what we are we have believed what are what if disbelieved that's what makes the difference between us and if as a pride the pride of this day oh my goodness that will be a topic for another day what God has done if faint before she could produce God's children yeah that was the first if the second if which was on which started on the day of Pentecost before God could use her to manifest God's children she failed at nicaea Council so now what God has done he knew that he died to be like that she will also fall like Indiana in the other price so he comes with the word and him checks the word in you so that you get the mind of God so when you receive that book when you receive that one you have the mind of God and when you have the mind of God then you can say I know oh my okay perfect faith comes by perfect word you master the circumstances by hearing the word oh my let me Rush okay God help me not just say well I believe Jesus Christ as the Son of God that is all right then add the rest of it to it you say I have been Justified I give my hand to the minister I believe in Jesus Christ then you have got to be born again you must be filled with the Holocaust just keep adding on just keep adding on going on you are growing into the stature of our son and daughter of God my God able to prepare us and to give us that grave in our life that we want to see something how many in here once more of God oh my I don't know we could talk about Elijah foreign was afraid because of the circumstances Elijah prayed for his eyes to be opened now at that time there was the Syria there was war between the Israelites and the syrians now the syrians who are wondering how come whatever we plan Even in our secrets the enemy knows what is happening then he see servants told him no because those people they have a prophet he knows even what you are thinking in your bedroom do we have a prophet yes so if we have a prophet he has given us the mind he has he has given us the mind so so we know even what the devil is planning so if you know what the devil is planning what what is the solution perfect love perfect love let's get perfect love that is the only thing that will be that will defeat the Devil oh my so or you can read this in second Kings chapter 6 verse verses 27. now when there was there was Hunger during those days and uh okay about the four lepers you could converted or read about it but the good part of it is those four lepers it came to a point where they said now here is a situation if we stay here we are going to die of hunger now if we go the armies of the enemy they are going to to kill us if you are there brother Henry what could you have done if you are among the four so they had they had to if we stay here we are going to die of hunger now if we make a step a step to move the armies of the other pharaohs they are going to kill us Jews either faith or fear if they feared they would have remained there but then Faith took hold of the situation they said let's go anyhow death is death but we would rather die trying than you sit here without a train oh my I love that I would rather not gone my knees and pray about it that will sit there and nothing is happening so they make a move let's go they started moving oh my I love that story I say you are approaching the city those guys on the other side God opened the eyes of these pharaohs the four lepers but he opened the eyes of the the ears of those pharaohs they had the Chariots coming and they said oh my that has flee away let us run away the people who are coming are many we cannot withstand them and they ran away and they left everything oh my goodness when they came in the city they found food was in plenty oh my goodness there is plenty of food only if you take a step there is plenty tiger take a step of faith Give Me Faith Lord [Music] who what our situation he opened the ears of those guys they had the Chariots coming they said oh fear now fear entered in them but this was because they took a step of faith faith became a master of circumstance faith Give Me Faith alone oh yes so those guys they armies of the other side their ears were opened they had the Chariots coming until they said no we cannot over we cannot withstand the armies that is coming the army that is coming they are clutter than ourselves so they had to run away but anybody who doubted the promise anybody who was afraid did not get to the to that place to eat the food so if you are afraid you will not eat the food God Give Me Faith Give Me Faith Give Me Faith Hollow may God help us can we make a move how are we ready to make a move Lord Give Me Faith God has overcome Us in this day Lord Give Me Faith let's move if you stay you are going to die you are going to die let us move oh my God could help us Give Me Faith we need faith we need faith like those four lepers they were lepers they were helpless but when they exercised their faith they got food are we ready to exercise our faith can you touch the can you touch and feel feel he's there we have been told he's in the boat he's in the ship there he is here with us that's the reason he came on Mount Sunset to be with us so he's here with us can we wake him up touching Jesus is all that I need he's in the pot you can reach out and touch him oh my oh my oh my I don't have time I don't know God help us now there is this story I think you can read it in in the book of Acts about Paul Paul was to meet I think the king that the king Agrippa on the other side but before then when they started going they were in the ship you can catch the story properly in the in the in the Bible there were problems in the ship yeah now as it was wrecking yeah Paul encouraged his people fear not why because the promise he knew he was to meet with the King on the other side by the king or whoever he was to meet he was to meet so if the promise that we have in our God is there if the promise is there then let us look at the promise [Laughter] let us look has looked there promise so if the promise is there no matter the circumstances let it come let let the circumstances come but as long as the promise is there God will not allow his purpose to be defeated and he has people today if I'm not one of them Lord may he help that person that brother or that sister to know that the promise is there for him or for her can it happen yes the promise is there he will have a pride yeah the promise is God will have a pride where in USA in Asia God will have a pride where is she so as long as he came so that he can write with you then if he's the one who called you you can challenge him you can also challenge him say Lord I don't want to be a hypocrite I don't want to waste your time like that brother prayed let me not waste your time yeah and let me not waste my time I want an assurance I want to know that I know I know and I know that my redeemer leave it he's in the boat he's in the pot can you wake him up let us stand sorry I hope the next Minister will pick it up from there so that he's in the pot oh my because he Because He Lives I confess tomorrow you know that he lives then you confess tomorrow fear is gone give me that give us that song I don't know how to sing it properly but I think the singers are here I enjoyed that song Because He Lives I confess tomorrow if you know he's in the boat then you can Face Tomorrow fear is gone fear is gone fear is gone because he lives I confess tomorrow and for you not don't just sing that because he lives come to that point where you can
