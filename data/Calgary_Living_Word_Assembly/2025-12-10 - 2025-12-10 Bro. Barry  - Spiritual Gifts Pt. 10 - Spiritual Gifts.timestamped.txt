[22:44] [music]
[22:49] [music]
[22:50] [singing]
[22:53] Oh,
[22:54] what [music] a day. We're going to sing
[22:57] it again. Tell you those [music] little
[23:00] little dream testimony. It's many many
[23:02] years old, but this song reminded me of
[23:04] some of you know Kevin Hilderbrand. I
[23:07] haven't had more than probably three or
[23:08] four dreams in my life that were so real
[23:10] to me. This is one of them. We we made
[23:14] it past those past the gates.
[23:17] And brother Kevin and I were were
[23:19] jumping and running and screaming and
[23:21] and and [music] clapping our hands and
[23:23] praising the Lord. So we made it. We
[23:25] made it. We made it. We're running up
[23:27] the streets of Glory.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; It was so real to me. The other one was
[23:30] my grandfather and a brother that sadly
[23:34] he was he was kicked off a horse when he
[23:36] was when he was young and he was he was
[23:39] crippled. He was he was he was lame. His
[23:41] name was Cornelius. We called him really
[23:44] bad name. was crippled corny Freezen is
[23:46] what [singing and music] he was known
[23:47] by. But I saw both my grandfather and
[23:50] him young walking through the streets
[23:54] walking through through wheat sheets
[23:55] like walking through the fields when we
[23:57] fell. You remember the wheat fields and
[23:59] grandpa's grandpa's behind his yard. I
[24:02] saw rows of them. [music] Those are that
[24:04] was just so precious to me and just
[24:06] thought I'd share it with you. Here we
[24:08] are tonight.
[24:10] Soon he'll come in clouds with glory.
[24:12] We'll see all these things. We'll see
[24:14] him. We're going to see him before we go
[24:16] there. That's a beautiful thing. One
[24:17] morning,
[24:18] &gt;&gt; if you ever been, we don't know how that
[24:20] will happen, but I believe we'll just
[24:22] say, "Look at there, brother Candy.
[24:25] There's so and so." Welcome. We made it.
[24:28] If you seen that, you know you made it.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; What a promise.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; What a promise. Good to be a Christian
[24:34] tonight.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Going to be called one of his own. Well,
[24:38] soon
[24:39] he'll come out of glory.
[24:43] [music and singing]
[24:47] Oh, saints of every [music] race.

[28:12] Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord that
[28:14] you are awesome in this place. Lord,
[28:16] &gt;&gt; we thank you Lord for this building. We
[28:19] thank you for this service tonight. But
[28:21] Lord, more than anything, we thank you
[28:23] for the revelation about who you are.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, not just about who you are,
[28:28] but [music] who you are in us.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, when we sing this song
[28:32] tonight, we sing it according [music] to
[28:34] that revelation. You are awesome in this
[28:36] place, Lord. The throne room of your uh
[28:40] oh father, the place that you have
[28:42] chosen in this age to dwell,
[28:44] &gt;&gt; the hearts of your children, Lord.
[28:47] Father, you truly are awesome. We can't
[28:50] even begin [music] to describe
[28:52] &gt;&gt; the measure of your grace to us in the
[28:54] age in which we live. Father, we thank
[28:57] you for all of the trials, Lord. We
[28:59] thank you for all of the tribulations,
[29:02] for all of the struggles, Lord Jesus,
[29:03] that you allow to [music] come by our
[29:05] way because we know that not one of them
[29:07] is by accident or coincidence. Every
[29:10] single [music] one is for us
[29:12] individually, Lord. So that you can see
[29:14] the character that you placed in us
[29:16] before the foundation of the world to
[29:18] come to the top, to come to the surface,
[29:20] Lord, [music] that we can recognize who
[29:22] we are, oh Father. And we know when that
[29:25] happens, that you will take us home.
[29:27] [music] And Father, one more time, we've
[29:29] gathered together in your name that we
[29:31] can prepare ourselves for that great
[29:33] hour. We know it's upon us, Lord. The
[29:36] handwriting is on the wall. The prophet
[29:38] has made the declaration. Judgment is at
[29:40] hand.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, we thank you for this
[29:44] evening, this service. Lord, thank you
[29:46] for each one who's come out tonight,
[29:48] Lord. Each life represented here in this
[29:50] building. Father, tonight we pray that
[29:52] we could lift our our requests unto you,
[29:55] Lord, as they are in the hearts of your
[29:57] children tonight, Father. Every one of
[29:59] us having needs, [music] Lord, we
[30:00] present them to you humbly tonight,
[30:02] Lord, trusting that you are more than
[30:04] able to help us with our needs.
[30:07] And father, we'll be careful to give you
[30:09] all the praise. Lord, we thank you for
[30:12] your presence tonight. [music] We pray
[30:13] that Lord, you would just continue
[30:15] ministering to us, Lord. That you just
[30:17] would receive all of the praise and the
[30:19] glory and the honor from this service
[30:22] tonight. Father, we love you and we
[30:24] thank you. We just ask all these things
[30:26] now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, musicians.
[30:34] Thank you everyone. It's certainly
[30:37] humbling to come out on a Wednesday
[30:39] evening and see the building full. My If
[30:42] you have your Bibles tonight, I would
[30:44] like to read from a few scriptures.
[30:48] I hope it's okay. I I feel like
[30:50] preaching.
[30:52] I thought, you know, what better thing
[30:54] could I do than to share with you what
[30:57] we had going on in Grand Prairie this
[30:59] weekend. So, we preached three services.
[31:02] I'm going to condense three services
[31:03] into an hour
[31:06] if it's possible even. We'll see. But uh
[31:09] in in the book of James, brother
[31:12] Brandham, he he talks about this and the
[31:15] heading in my Bible says faith and
[31:17] works. Brother Brandham in 1965 preaches
[31:20] a message, works is faith expressed. And
[31:23] the inspiration for all of this is from
[31:26] that message. And I'll get into it a
[31:28] little bit later, but uh you know in the
[31:31] book of James
[31:35] James,
[31:38] sorry it's not James chapter 3, it's
[31:40] James chapter 2
[31:43] verse 21.
[31:46] James
[31:48] chapter 2 verse 21.
[31:51] Was not Abraham our father justified by
[31:54] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[31:57] upon the altar?
[32:00] Seeest thou how faith wrought his works
[32:04] and by works was faith made perfect.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; And the scripture was fulfilled which
[32:10] saith Abraham believed God and it was
[32:13] imputed unto him for righteousness
[32:15] and he was called the friend of God.
[32:18] Amen.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Let's turn back. In my Bible, it's two
[32:22] pages. Yours, it might be one or three
[32:26] to Hebrews chapter 13.
[32:29] Very familiar scripture, but I believe
[32:32] it bears
[32:34] uh reading Hebrews chapter 13:8.
[32:38] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[32:43] and forever.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[32:47] seated.
[32:52] I bring you greetings from brother
[32:54] Darren and sister Dearis Ber and Grand
[32:57] Prairie. They said say a big hello to
[33:00] everyone here. Uh we had such a
[33:02] wonderful time over the weekend. I bring
[33:05] you greetings from the Lake. You know on
[33:08] Friday night I was sitting in the
[33:11] pastor's study. I just got settled there
[33:13] with brother Darren and uh just trying
[33:16] to find my place to find [snorts] get
[33:18] into the the routine of you know getting
[33:21] into the service you know and after
[33:23] traveling and and just got into the
[33:26] pastor's study talking with brother
[33:27] Darren and the song leader came in to
[33:29] pray and that song leader was brother
[33:31] David
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Lok and for those people who know
[33:34] brother David Lok he was here in Calgary
[33:37] for a while while brother Ken was here
[33:39] and uh he went through a real real
[33:42] valley. He went through a hard time in
[33:44] his life. So for me to see him walk in
[33:48] as the song leader, it was such an
[33:50] emotionally charged moment. I was so
[33:52] thankful. I just hugged his neck and
[33:55] praised the Lord for a minute. It was
[33:57] incredible to see him there.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; My So the Lake, they send their their
[34:02] greetings to the assembly here. the
[34:05] Meyers, Brother Steven and Sis, Sister
[34:08] Lillian Meyers from Hudson Hope. They
[34:11] send a big hello especially to Sister
[34:13] Shelly,
[34:15] the stewards, Brother John and and
[34:17] Sister Katrina Stewart. There's just so
[34:19] many gems up there in that little corner
[34:21] in the province. And uh everyone else in
[34:24] the assembly, we're just so thankful
[34:27] that we came and uh I think we'll do
[34:29] some more of it. And my desire, and I
[34:31] told brother Darren this, is to actually
[34:33] maybe help uh sponsor some ministry from
[34:36] our assembly because we're so blessed
[34:38] here to actually come and just bring
[34:40] some encouragement. And uh we'll see. I
[34:43] think they can really use the
[34:44] encouragement. If you wonder um my
[34:48] excitement about seeing so many people
[34:49] here on Sunday morning, I think we
[34:51] counted 20 people in the service and
[34:54] that was with visitors. That was
[34:56] including the visitors. So the assembly
[34:58] is pretty thin. It doesn't mean
[35:01] anything. Doesn't change the word of
[35:03] God. It doesn't mean that anything is
[35:06] wrong. But it certainly is encouraging
[35:08] to hear. Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I was thankful that we brought uh
[35:12] brother John Panicker and brother
[35:14] William Pavick. He brought brought us he
[35:17] drove. What a tremendous time it was
[35:19] just to go and fellowship around the
[35:21] things of the Lord and
[35:23] &gt;&gt; to hear. Amen.
[35:25] We uh just wanted to mention we've got
[35:27] the men's breakfast coming up this
[35:28] Saturday. We've got the youth service
[35:29] coming up on Friday. Um brother Toby,
[35:33] he's going to take the service on the
[35:34] 21st and uh he's going to give us a a
[35:37] little synopsis of what took place in
[35:40] Nigeria regarding the hostage situation.
[35:43] He was able to fellowship with the
[35:44] believers that were actually in it, I
[35:46] believe, uh from the assembly that they
[35:49] were actually from. So, uh, and then
[35:52] whatever the Lord has on his heart, I'm
[35:53] sure he's got a he's got a fork full of,
[35:56] uh, goodness for us. So, [snorts] we're
[35:58] excited about that service on the 21st,
[36:00] and then, uh, 24th we get to have a
[36:03] Christmas evening mass.
[36:07] Doesn't that sound fun? Every year I
[36:10] have people say to me, "Are you going to
[36:12] church Christmas Eve?" And I say, "No.
[36:15] Why would I do that?"
[36:17] We know it's a traditional thing in the
[36:19] world, but you know, this year it falls
[36:20] on a Wednesday evening. So, I mean, what
[36:23] else are we going to do?
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Sit at home and eat bon bonss.
[36:28] We can go to church. We can have church.
[36:30] We can worship the King of Kings and
[36:33] Lord of Lords in the day in
[36:34] [clears throat] which we live. It's a
[36:35] tremendous thing. So, we're not going to
[36:36] have mass. Don't worry.
[36:39] I just thought that would be fun to
[36:40] throw out there. Remember, we have a
[36:42] communion service the following
[36:43] Wednesday. That's the 31st. And uh we
[36:47] just trust the Lord will move one more
[36:50] time in our assembly as we have a
[36:51] communion footwashing and we have a
[36:53] testimony service and specials. I don't
[36:55] know if I really want to preach too
[36:57] much. I just want to get together and
[36:58] worship the Lord and just celebrate all
[37:01] the goodness in our lives. What he's
[37:03] done for us over the last year. Hasn't
[37:05] he been wonderful?
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful even tonight? Amen.
[37:10] [applause] Just wonderful.
[37:12] just absolutely wonderful.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Wow. [applause]
[37:17] We thank you for your prayers. The Lord
[37:19] really moved in the services, I believe.
[37:21] And uh you know, if nobody else was
[37:23] blessed, I sure was. That's why I want
[37:25] to talk about it tonight. I thought it
[37:27] was just too good to just keep it to
[37:28] ourselves, so I had to bring a little
[37:30] bit tonight. But we got home at 1. I got
[37:33] home at 1:00 a.m. on Monday uh morning.
[37:36] And uh certainly thank brother William
[37:38] for his efforts in driving and just
[37:40] keeping us in a timely fashion. It was
[37:43] uh really really considerate. So thank
[37:45] you so much brother. And yeah [applause]
[37:53] and brother John
[37:55] he's a preacher.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; He got inspired while we were driving
[37:59] there. That was really good.
[38:02] So, uh, anyways, you know, um, just
[38:04] getting into our service tonight, if
[38:05] it's okay, I just want to talk about
[38:07] what we talked about in in in Grand
[38:09] Prairie and Friday night, we we, you
[38:12] know, how do you find the mind of the
[38:13] Lord for three services? And I just had
[38:15] this this this leadership, this leading
[38:18] to go to works his faith. And I kept
[38:20] wondering, how can I start with that?
[38:21] Why is it that? And I just couldn't
[38:23] understand it. But I just kept feeding
[38:25] on it and kept listening to it and
[38:27] studying it. And you know, this was as
[38:29] the weeks came by and the days were
[38:31] drawing near, we were going and I just
[38:33] waited for the mind of the Lord. I'm not
[38:35] the kind that will really just, you
[38:37] know, prepare a volume of notes and have
[38:40] it with me to go just to be ready. I
[38:43] like to find the inspiration for the
[38:44] moment. And all of the inspiration came
[38:48] in Grand Prairie.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; And I was certainly thankful for that.
[38:51] So, Friday night, we got into talking
[38:54] about the secrets of the heart. And uh
[38:57] it's interesting because it's based out
[38:59] of 2 Kings
[39:02] chapter 6. If you want to turn over
[39:04] there quickly, 2 Kings chapter 6 talking
[39:08] about the secrets of the heart. And it's
[39:10] based on the story of the king of uh
[39:13] Syria
[39:15] and how he was he was wondering what was
[39:18] going on in his world. How who's the
[39:20] spy? There's someone in our midst that's
[39:23] actually helping out the the children of
[39:24] Israel. How could they possibly know
[39:26] what's going on? In verse 8, it says,
[39:28] "Then the king of Syria wared against
[39:30] Israel." This is chapter 6 of 2 Kings
[39:33] verse 8. Then the king of Syria wared
[39:35] against Israel and took counsel with his
[39:37] servants, saying, "In such and such a
[39:39] place shall be my camp." And the man of
[39:44] God sent unto the king of Israel,
[39:46] saying, Beware that thou pass not such a
[39:49] place, for titter the Syrians are come
[39:51] down. And the king of Israel sent to the
[39:53] place which the man of God told him and
[39:56] warned him of and saved himself there
[39:58] not once nor twice.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; So multiple times. This is not an
[40:04] accident or a coincidence. Verse 11.
[40:06] Therefore the heart of the king of Syria
[40:08] was sore troubled for this thing. You
[40:11] can imagine he would be really upset.
[40:14] Who is telling our secrets? And he
[40:17] called his servants, and he said unto
[40:19] them, "Will ye not show me which of us
[40:22] is for the king of Israel?"
[40:26] And one of his servants said, "None, my
[40:28] lord, O king?"
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; But Elisha the prophet that is in
[40:32] Israel, tellth the king of Israel the
[40:35] words that thou speakest in thy bed
[40:38] chamber.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Remember Hebrews 13.
[40:45] Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[40:49] and forever.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; The secrets of the heart. And you know,
[40:52] I I actually took it a little bit
[40:53] further and I started to talk about how
[40:55] how we have vision. We we do have
[40:57] vision. And you know, when you carry on
[40:59] in this story here, how maybe we could
[41:03] just jump down to verse 15. And when the
[41:04] servant of the man of God was risen
[41:06] early and gone forth, behold, a host
[41:08] compassed the city both with horses and
[41:11] chariots and servant said unto him,
[41:12] "Alas, my master, how shall we do?" But
[41:16] you know, this is what the master said.
[41:19] This is what the seasoned believer said.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Right? Now, some would say the prophet,
[41:24] and he was a prophet indeed, but I
[41:27] believe this is the testimony of a
[41:29] seasoned believer, someone who is
[41:31] perfect, not in the fleshly sense,
[41:35] &gt;&gt; not necessarily in all of the works
[41:37] sense, but in the faith sense. And we're
[41:38] going to get into that tonight, in the
[41:40] faith sense, because that's where it's
[41:42] at. It's truly in our faith. That
[41:44] perfection is in our faith. It has to
[41:46] be. But this is the testimony of a
[41:48] believer. He answered, "Fear not,
[41:51] &gt;&gt; for they that be with us are more than
[41:54] they that be with them."
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful because Elisha
[42:00] prayed and he didn't pray, "Oh, smite
[42:04] the enemy. Oh, deal with them." What did
[42:06] he do? He said, "Change our perspective.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Take this boy's eyes and open them to
[42:13] the things of God. open them to the word
[42:15] for his day. So he doesn't have to be
[42:17] afraid. He doesn't have to live under
[42:19] the spirit of fear
[42:20] &gt;&gt; because he hasn't given us a spirit of
[42:22] fear, has he? He's given us a spirit of
[42:24] power and of love and of a sound mind.
[42:27] We don't have to be afraid.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Elisha prayed and said, "Lord, I pray
[42:32] thee, open his eyes that he may see."
[42:35] &gt;&gt; I thought he was seeing.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Weren't his eyes open? Couldn't he see
[42:40] the enemy all around?
[42:44] But I took this story and and brought it
[42:46] in in such a way that we talk about our
[42:48] vision isn't necessarily what's going
[42:51] on. What we look at on the surface in
[42:53] our flesh in the world that we perceive
[42:56] isn't necessarily what's actually taking
[42:59] place even though it is. But we need to
[43:02] be very careful to recognize that it can
[43:05] be a trap. It can be the devil trying to
[43:08] get us to fear, trying to get us afraid,
[43:10] trying to accept that spirit of fear and
[43:13] say, "No, it's greater than those that
[43:16] are around us."
[43:19] &gt;&gt; And I mean, if we've got the open book,
[43:21] if we've got what what do we really have
[43:24] to fear?
[43:25] &gt;&gt; If Revelations 10:7 has actually taken
[43:27] place,
[43:29] &gt;&gt; how many here would believe that it
[43:30] hasn't taken place? Don't show me your
[43:32] hands.
[43:33] But if we really truly have been given
[43:35] an open book, what John the Baptist or
[43:38] not John the Baptist, John the Revelator
[43:40] really desired to look upon and he was
[43:42] told to take that book and eat it up.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; If we've been given that book, what do
[43:47] we have to fear?
[43:52] I know we deal with things naturally in
[43:54] our lives, in our bodies, in our minds,
[43:58] &gt;&gt; but greater is he that is in me
[44:02] &gt;&gt; than he that is in this world.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; So, we went on to talk about this story
[44:06] and how our perception of the situation
[44:08] isn't necessarily what God is seeing.
[44:11] It's not necessarily what's really
[44:13] taking place around us, even though we
[44:15] can see it from a limited perspective.
[44:17] And you know, I I remember brother Wayne
[44:19] Lawson, I think it was, was talking
[44:21] about it. You know, when you fly in an
[44:22] airplane and you look out and you see
[44:23] the world from 40,000 feet in the air,
[44:26] it has a a a perspective. Brother Sam
[44:29] probably knows all about this. But then
[44:31] when you start to come in for a landing
[44:32] and you get closer down, you can see
[44:34] more. And the closer down you get, the
[44:37] more you see. And when you get on the
[44:38] ground, you have a totally different
[44:40] perspective as you begin to look up and
[44:42] around. And that's kind of what I wanted
[44:45] to get at with this this story here is
[44:47] that, you know, we have a perspective
[44:49] ourselves. But let's not get caught up
[44:51] in what we see because it's not
[44:52] necessarily what God sees.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Most times, in fact, it's not.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Especially when it comes to looking in
[44:59] the mirror and seeing ourselves, ain't
[45:01] it?
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Many times we look at ourselves and
[45:03] think, my look at this, look at that,
[45:05] look at the other thing. But that's not
[45:07] how God sees us. Here I go jumping to
[45:09] the the punchline of the service. We're
[45:11] going to get into that. And you know,
[45:12] it's anointed of the Lord because I saw
[45:14] probably five markers in the song
[45:16] service and things that were said and
[45:18] the prayer that went forward that were
[45:20] actually already in the notes for
[45:21] tonight. So, I just love it when the
[45:23] Lord does that.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; But, you know, it came to pass verse 20
[45:29] when they were come into Samaria and
[45:31] Elisha said, "Lord, open the first he
[45:34] said, close their eyes. Follow me. Let
[45:36] them let them. The man that they were
[45:38] chasing went out and said to them, "I
[45:40] know who you're looking for, but he's
[45:41] not here." The guy they were looking
[45:43] for, "But follow me and I'll take you to
[45:46] him." And what did he do? He took him
[45:47] into a trap. These were guys that were
[45:49] seasoned warriors, soldiers, generals.
[45:52] They knew how to triangulate. They knew
[45:55] they were warriors.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; But yet, he was able to take them and
[45:59] lead them.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Now, were they blind? Was his servant
[46:03] blind? Did his servant not see? And then
[46:05] he could see he was able to have they
[46:08] were all able to have a different
[46:09] perspective.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; It's pretty interesting to see it. But
[46:13] he brought them here in verse 20 says,
[46:14] "And it came to pass when they were come
[46:16] into Samaria that Elisha said, Lord,
[46:18] open the eyes of these men that they may
[46:21] see."
[46:22] And the Lord opened their eyes and they
[46:24] saw. And behold, they were in the midst
[46:25] of Samaria. And now they realized,
[46:27] "Uh-oh, we've got a big problem now. Now
[46:30] we're in a trap. Somehow we found
[46:33] ourselves right in the midst of our
[46:34] enemy.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; But you know what did the spirit of God
[46:37] do? Immediately the king came out and
[46:39] said to them, "Master, shall I slay
[46:41] them? Shall I slay them? What shall I
[46:43] do?" Oh my. Shall I smite them? And what
[46:46] did the prophet of God say? I would say
[46:48] the spirit of God said, "No, no, no, no,
[46:50] no, no, no, no. The psalm says, "Thou
[46:53] preparest a table
[46:55] &gt;&gt; before my enemies."
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[46:58] &gt;&gt; We're going to actually feed them food.
[47:00] give them food and water. We're going to
[47:02] accommodate them. We're going to show
[47:04] them kindness. And then guess what's
[47:06] going to happen? They're going to go
[47:07] their way and they're not going to bug
[47:08] us anymore.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it what happened
[47:12] there.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; In the end of verse 23, so the bands of
[47:15] Syria came no more into the land of
[47:18] Israel.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Just treat them nicely. Hey, sometimes
[47:22] our perception is so different than
[47:25] what's actually taking place. And and I
[47:28] think maybe sometimes I know myself by
[47:30] experience, brothers and sisters,
[47:32] sometimes we just need to pray, Lord,
[47:34] change my perspective.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Give me a different fresh view of the
[47:38] situation. It can go so far for where
[47:41] we're at in our lives.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; We can go to sleep thinking the whole
[47:45] world is closing in around us,
[47:48] &gt;&gt; but then wake up in the morning and feel
[47:50] like, "Wow,
[47:52] &gt;&gt; I've got a brand new life to live.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Look at all the things around me.
[47:56] Everything is so good. My My family is
[47:59] good and my I got a job. It's not the
[48:01] greatest. I don't like my job that much,
[48:03] but you know, I've got it and it pays
[48:05] the bills.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; We have reason to rejoice. Sometimes
[48:08] it's just our perspective in the
[48:10] situation.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; That was Friday night.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; That was Friday night. Saturday night,
[48:17] we actually got into it a little
[48:18] further. And uh Saturday night was more
[48:21] the secrets of the heart and and and and
[48:23] vision, being able to see. And Saturday
[48:25] night, we got on to perspective,
[48:28] how we actually see things. And you
[48:31] know, I took that from Second Kings. I
[48:33] couldn't get out of Kings and the story
[48:34] of Elisha. 2 Kings chapter 2. If you
[48:37] want to turn over there, 2 Kings,
[48:39] chapter 2, very familiar scriptures.
[48:44] Thank you, brother Dawn, for taking the
[48:46] service on Sunday. It was powerful,
[48:48] tremendous service. Thank you, brother,
[48:50] for yielding.
[48:52] certainly enjoy hearing the ministry
[48:56] give to us what the Lord has put on
[48:58] their heart.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Need them all.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Second Kings,
[49:05] did I say? Yeah. Two. Sorry, I was
[49:09] looking at it wrong. Second Kings
[49:11] chapter 2 verse one. And it came to pass
[49:13] when the Lord would take up Elijah into
[49:15] heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went
[49:18] to with Elisha from Gilgal. Now, we know
[49:21] that Elijah had already called Elisha
[49:24] and Elisha already fixed up all of his
[49:27] life, got rid of the oxen, changed his
[49:30] his complete focus on life and started
[49:33] following the word for his day.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; That's what he did. He stopped all of
[49:38] his family traditions. He gave
[49:40] everything up and started following the
[49:42] word for his day.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; And and they knew that there was coming
[49:46] a time that he was going to go up by a
[49:48] whirlwind. And Elijah, verse two, said
[49:51] unto Elisha, Terry here I pray thee, for
[49:53] the Lord hath sent me to Bethl. And
[49:56] Elisha said unto him, as the Lord
[49:59] liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will
[50:02] not leave thee. So they went down to
[50:04] Bethl.
[50:06] And and interestingly, the sons of the
[50:09] prophets that were at Bethl, they knew
[50:12] the prophecy, didn't they? They came
[50:15] forth to Elisha and said unto him,
[50:17] "Knowest thou that the Lord will take
[50:20] away thy master from thy head today?"
[50:24] And he said, "Yay, I know it. Hold ye
[50:27] your peace."
[50:30] &gt;&gt; These were the ones that weren't
[50:31] completely sold out.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; They were pretty sold out. They're
[50:36] pretty good believers,
[50:38] most way believers, but not all the way
[50:40] believers because if they were, they
[50:41] would have been following just like
[50:42] Elisha.
[50:45] But it's interesting how they knew the
[50:46] prophecy too.
[50:49] Verse four. And Elisha, Elijah said unto
[50:53] him, Elisha, Terry, here I pray thee,
[50:56] for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho.
[50:58] And he said, as the Lord liveth, and as
[51:00] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.
[51:04] So they came to Jericho. And guess what?
[51:08] [clears throat] Sons of the prophets
[51:09] were there. The sons of the prophets
[51:11] that were at Jericho came to Elisha and
[51:15] said unto him, "Knowest thou that the
[51:17] Lord will take away thy master from thy
[51:19] head today?" And he answered, "Yay, I
[51:22] know it. Hold ye your peace."
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And Elijah said unto him, Terry, I pray
[51:29] thee here, for the Lord hath sent me to
[51:33] Jordan. And he said, "As the Lord
[51:35] liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will
[51:39] not leave thee." And they too went on.
[51:43] And 50 men of the sons of the prophets
[51:46] went and stood to view a far off. Now,
[51:51] there's a reason for that.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; If you flip back and you read the
[51:56] previous story, the 50 men and this
[51:58] prophet was bad news.
[52:02] You didn't take 50 men to follow this
[52:04] prophet and challenge him.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; So they knew full well they better stand
[52:07] far off.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; 50 men of the sons of the prophets went
[52:12] and stood to view a far off.
[52:16] And they too stood by Jordan.
[52:20] And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped
[52:22] it together and smote the waters. And
[52:24] they divided hither and tither so that
[52:26] they too went over on dry ground.
[52:29] I just think it's so beautiful. He shows
[52:31] him exactly how to handle the word,
[52:33] doesn't he?
[52:35] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when they were gone
[52:37] over that Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask
[52:40] what I shall do for thee before I be
[52:43] taken away from thee." And Elisha said,
[52:46] I pray thee, let a double portion of thy
[52:49] spirit be upon me.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; And he said, Thou hast asked a hard
[52:54] thing.
[52:56] Nevertheless,
[52:57] &gt;&gt; if thou see me when I am taken from
[52:59] thee, it shall be so unto thee.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; But if not, it shall not be so.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; And we know the next verse. And it came
[53:10] to pass, they still went on and talked
[53:13] that behold, there appeared a chariot of
[53:16] fire and horses of fire, and parted them
[53:19] both aunderder. And Elijah went up by a
[53:21] whirlwind into heaven.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. As I was preaching this in Grand
[53:26] Prairie, it just occurred to me these
[53:28] were the exact same horses that we just
[53:31] already read about
[53:32] &gt;&gt; that the servant of Elisha actually saw
[53:36] &gt;&gt; standing round about saying there's way
[53:38] more for us than there is against us.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; But you know in this scripture here
[53:42] verse 12 we'll read this. And Elisha saw
[53:45] it and he cried my father my father the
[53:47] chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[53:48] thereof. And he saw him no more and he
[53:51] took hold of his own clothes and rent
[53:53] them in two pieces. He didn't need them
[53:55] anymore, did he?
[53:56] &gt;&gt; He had a brand new position that he was
[53:58] moving into.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; And he took up also the mantle of Elijah
[54:02] that fell from him and went back and
[54:04] stood by the bank of the Jordan. And
[54:06] just the most notable words ever. And he
[54:09] took the mantle of Elijah that fell from
[54:11] him and smokeote the waters and said,
[54:13] "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?"
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; And when he also had smitten the waters,
[54:21] they parted hither and tither. and
[54:23] Elisha went over.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; And we know, we know those ones that
[54:27] would stand a far off, they were just
[54:28] too afraid to get close. They just
[54:30] didn't see things the same way.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; They just were afraid to get in and get
[54:35] too close. They had their own version of
[54:38] the message for their day. So, they just
[54:40] stood a far off. Those ones were right
[54:42] there. And what did they do? They bugged
[54:44] the prophet until he was actually
[54:46] ashamed is what the word says.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, we should go and look for him. But
[54:50] they knew the prophecy, didn't they?
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; All of the believers believers
[54:55] everywhere they went to said, "Don't you
[54:57] know your master's going up?"
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; But yet after he did go up, then they
[55:01] said, "Oh, we just can't really believe
[55:03] it that way. We got to actually put a
[55:05] spin on. Maybe we should send out some
[55:06] bands of men to go and find them."
[55:08] Right? Because he must be up on a
[55:09] mountain somewhere because that was one
[55:12] of the places he liked to go. It's
[55:14] interesting to look at this story. What
[55:16] I really got into was the fact that
[55:18] there was three times that Elijah said
[55:21] to Elisha, "Just tarry ye here
[55:25] &gt;&gt; because I got business to do. The Lord's
[55:26] called me. Just terry here and wait and
[55:29] and then we can carry on our way." And
[55:31] you know, three times it was typed,
[55:33] Brother Darren brought it out really
[55:34] good as a summary. You know, the first
[55:36] one was justification, Bethl, right?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; The second one was was sanctification.
[55:45] sanctification. The third one was the
[55:47] River Jordan, right?
[55:48] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost, crossing
[55:50] over, dying out to yourself, the truth
[55:53] of the word. But, you know, I guess it
[55:55] just became so real to me in in this in
[55:58] this weekend how it wasn't after the
[56:02] promise was given. You know, what do you
[56:04] want, Elisha,
[56:06] for following me? Like, what do you
[56:08] want? What can I do for you? Because
[56:10] you've been such a strong supporter of
[56:12] me and everything that I've done. What
[56:13] can I do to help you? Well, I want a
[56:15] double portion of what you got. That
[56:17] wasn't the arrangement when he actually
[56:19] brought him and attracted him from doing
[56:22] his worldly deeds. What attracted him
[56:24] was the word for his day. And you know,
[56:26] he was at the place, I just think it's
[56:28] so beautiful where I believe it with all
[56:30] my heart that somewhere along the way,
[56:32] he read the church age book that said,
[56:34] "Never let anyone or anything get
[56:37] between you and this word."
[56:40] So even when the prophet said to him, "I
[56:42] got business to do.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; The Lord's called me over here. I think
[56:45] it would be good if you just wait here."
[56:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "No way. Ain't going to happen.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz I believe what the church age book
[56:53] said. Ain't nothing getting between me
[56:55] and that word.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Everywhere you go, I go.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Everything you do, I do.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; I am going to take that word all of the
[57:05] way." Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And because of that,
[57:08] &gt;&gt; it entitled him to the token,
[57:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Full complete obedience to the entire
[57:15] word of God entitles YOU TO THE TOKEN.
[57:18] AND DON'T THINK IT'S JUST READING THE
[57:19] word of God and saying, "Well, I believe
[57:21] in Jesus Christ. He died for my sins,
[57:23] and I'm just going to bypass the prophet
[57:25] with a real good wide sweep and come in
[57:28] at Jesus Christ at the end." If you
[57:30] negate the message of the hour for your
[57:32] day,
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. then you're not entitling yourself
[57:36] to the token.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; In the days of the children of Israel in
[57:39] Gan, if they would have said, "I'm just
[57:41] going to bypass that token." Remember,
[57:43] we've talked about it. Oh man, you're
[57:45] going to make more flies come around.
[57:47] Haven't we had enough plagues of flies?
[57:49] I'm just going to take that blood and
[57:51] put it in a little vial and I'll just
[57:52] set it on the ground by the door so the
[57:54] flies can't get at it and we won't
[57:56] attract. But I'll have the blood. The
[57:57] blood's there, right? Maybe I'll set one
[58:00] up on the lentil. It'll be right up
[58:02] there and there'll be two on the
[58:03] doorpost down here. I've done it my way.
[58:06] It'll work. It's the blood, right? No,
[58:09] you got to do it the way the prophet
[58:11] said. And if you want to do it any other
[58:13] way, it means death.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; But in this in this message here, I just
[58:20] thought it was so good. You know, it was
[58:22] after he was already sold out on the
[58:24] word, after he was already a follower of
[58:27] the word. It didn't take something
[58:31] fantastic for him to commit his life to
[58:34] the word. And you know, going back full
[58:37] circle now, this is where it gets kind
[58:38] of full circle. I'm just going to start
[58:39] blending it together as we go. You know,
[58:42] works is faith what?
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Expressed. Yeah. When we've got great
[58:48] faith, our works demonstrate it.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Brandom says it.
[58:52] I've got the quote. I'm going to read
[58:53] it. But you know what? If we're afraid
[58:55] to act on our faith,
[58:57] &gt;&gt; then we don't even have it.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Because why would we be afraid if we
[59:02] really truly have faith? Why would we be
[59:04] afraid to act on it?
[59:07] We shouldn't fear. There should be no
[59:09] fear about acting on the faith that
[59:11] we've got. If the Lord gives us a
[59:12] revelation and we say, "That's for me. I
[59:15] claim that with all of my heart." Even
[59:17] brother Bradom says that if you do that,
[59:19] nothing's going to stop you. Nothing
[59:22] will stop that promise from coming to
[59:23] pass in your life. Even though you don't
[59:25] see it today, you might not see it
[59:27] today. You'll just know it's closer
[59:28] tomorrow. If you don't see it tomorrow,
[59:30] you'll know it'll be even closer the
[59:31] next day. It's the same faith that it
[59:33] takes for us to see a body change to see
[59:36] the promises come to pass according to
[59:37] the word for our day. It's not different
[59:39] faith. And brother Bradam even says it
[59:41] talking about goan and applying the
[59:43] blood. It's applied with simple weeds,
[59:46] simple thistle, right?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes simple faith, not
[59:50] complicated faith, NOT COMPLICATED
[59:52] SCHOLARLY FAITH WHERE WE'RE TALKING ALL
[59:55] ABOUT DEEP, DARK MYSTERIES.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; The mysteries are history.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; We got an open book.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; And it entitles us to the token.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; But it gives us the ability to recognize
[1:00:08] who we are
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; and what we're raised up for.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; My I think it's just so beautiful. So
[1:00:14] that was Saturday night, Sunday.
[1:00:18] Sunday service, you know, we talked
[1:00:20] about sort of um Friday night, you know,
[1:00:23] how we see as humans, we see and we
[1:00:26] don't see. We talked about Saturday,
[1:00:29] how, you know, other people actually
[1:00:32] perceive maybe perception, our
[1:00:34] perception of things makes all the
[1:00:37] difference. And and how we really
[1:00:39] perceive things because sometimes we
[1:00:41] perceive things with our eyes and
[1:00:43] sometimes we perceive things with our
[1:00:44] heart. And you know, we we're supposed
[1:00:46] to discern the spirits. That's the word
[1:00:48] of God. First John says that to to
[1:00:50] discern the spirits and and that only
[1:00:52] comes by the Holy Spirit. But I took it
[1:00:55] on Sunday. I thought, you know, I can
[1:00:57] see how the Lord was leading this now
[1:00:58] because now works is faith expressed
[1:01:02] comes into view. And you know what it
[1:01:05] comes down to, brothers and sisters, is
[1:01:07] how does God see us?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; That's how I brought Sunday.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; What's God's perception?
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we can look at ourselves
[1:01:15] all day long and say, "Well, I feel like
[1:01:16] this and I I remember that and and I I I
[1:01:19] I I Who cares about us?"
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; What does he see when he looks our way?
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; We know we sing that song. He no longer
[1:01:26] sees a sinner,
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; but a saint
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; who's been washed white as snow. Oh my.
[1:01:32] [laughter]
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; I feel like I could sing that song, but
[1:01:36] I'm not going to right now. I'll spare
[1:01:38] you. But you know on Sunday I just got
[1:01:40] into God's perspective and how he sees
[1:01:44] us and perspective is everything
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; and and I started the the the service
[1:01:50] with the scripture over in James James
[1:01:53] chapter 2 verse 21. Was not Abraham our
[1:01:56] father justified by works when he had
[1:01:58] offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
[1:02:00] Seeest thou how faith wrought with his
[1:02:03] works and by works was faith made
[1:02:06] perfect. And remember that word perfect
[1:02:09] means complete or mature. How works made
[1:02:14] how works was faith made perfect. And 23
[1:02:17] says the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:02:19] saith Abraham believed God and it was
[1:02:22] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[1:02:24] he was called the friend of God.
[1:02:28] Now I I don't know if I'd even be able
[1:02:30] to get into it but I I just want to say
[1:02:32] this. You know, we have been called in
[1:02:34] this generation to a greater calling
[1:02:36] than just a friend of God.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Remember the disciples, they were
[1:02:41] actually the disciples, they were
[1:02:43] servants.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Originally, they were servants. He
[1:02:46] called them all by name, but they were
[1:02:48] servants. And there came a time where he
[1:02:50] said, "I no longer call you servant, but
[1:02:52] I call you friend."
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then through the process of
[1:02:57] time, through all the ages, after Christ
[1:03:01] came and and paid our redemption and set
[1:03:04] all of humanity free, thousands of years
[1:03:07] later, he sends a prophet. And that
[1:03:10] prophet says something so significant.
[1:03:13] I've said it in the past, but I have to
[1:03:15] say it again. He said, "You know what? I
[1:03:17] no longer call you church,
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; but I call you bride."
[1:03:23] And you know, before there's a wedding,
[1:03:25] you have a bride.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Before there's a wedding, there's a
[1:03:29] bride. And you know, brothers and
[1:03:30] sisters, I've talked about it in the
[1:03:32] past. I'll say it again tonight, too.
[1:03:34] There is another move.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; It's not staying as bride. We don't keep
[1:03:38] our wives as brides. We consummate the
[1:03:41] marriage. And they move from being bride
[1:03:43] to being wife.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; And once they're wife, then they're one.
[1:03:50] Amen.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; And we know the scripture says that let
[1:03:54] us rejoice and be exceeding glad. Let's
[1:03:56] be very, very glad. Why? Because the
[1:03:59] marriage of the lamb has come. Don't put
[1:04:02] it off to Revelation 19 when she's
[1:04:04] coming back with the King of Kings.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; The marriage is now. Brother Bradom
[1:04:08] said, "Right now is the marriage. We go
[1:04:11] to the wedding supper in the sky.
[1:04:14] His
[1:04:16] wife
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; hath made herself
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; ready.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; And you know, brothers and sisters, this
[1:04:23] is exactly how we do it. Through the
[1:04:24] five-fold ministry, gathering together
[1:04:26] in the name of the Lord Jesus under the
[1:04:28] banner of his love, this message of the
[1:04:31] hour.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; That's how she makes herself ready.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; My
[1:04:38] so what God sees, you know, talking
[1:04:40] about perspective, what's his
[1:04:42] perspective? It's I said it on on
[1:04:44] Sunday. It's nearly impossible for us to
[1:04:46] explain in one service what his
[1:04:48] perspective is.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; But I I went through those two quickly.
[1:04:52] Now I'm going to kind of dwell on this
[1:04:53] one. I'm going to take a little bit of
[1:04:54] time here because I can see we've got
[1:04:56] perfectly a half an hour. And I know
[1:04:58] what's going to happen. It's going to go
[1:04:59] like that. But you know, it's nearly
[1:05:01] impossible to try and explain in one
[1:05:04] service how God sees us.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm just going to try my best
[1:05:09] just to try and bring us some
[1:05:10] encouragement about how he sees us. And
[1:05:12] and you know, that's why we fellowship
[1:05:14] because we crave more, isn't it? Don't
[1:05:16] we crave more every time? It's like when
[1:05:19] we're a kid and and we have a story
[1:05:21] being told to us and you know, we got to
[1:05:23] go to bed and I can't even remember this
[1:05:25] far back, but I have kids so I know how
[1:05:27] it goes. But you know how the children
[1:05:29] they get a story at night and they're
[1:05:31] going to bed and you know, a is that it?
[1:05:33] Yeah. You got to go to sleep now. You
[1:05:35] got to turn off the light and go to
[1:05:36] sleep. A just one more. Isn't that what
[1:05:38] we do when we gather together as
[1:05:40] children of the king? Just tell me one
[1:05:43] more time about who I am. I just want to
[1:05:46] hear it one more time, daddy. Give me
[1:05:48] more. And you know, the more we do that,
[1:05:50] the more we get the spirit that cries
[1:05:52] out, Abba, father.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Abba, father, tell me more about who I
[1:05:57] am.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; My out of 1965 works as faith.
[1:06:04] Brother Brandom says, "Now we find here
[1:06:07] that James is justifying Abraham by his
[1:06:10] works." James is justifying Abraham by
[1:06:14] his works. But now in Paul, in Romans,
[1:06:19] we didn't read this tonight, by the way.
[1:06:20] I know you know that in Romans, the book
[1:06:23] of Romans the 8th, the 4th chapter 4
[1:06:26] 1-8. I won't read it all, but just read
[1:06:29] a part of it. And what shall we say then
[1:06:32] that Abraham our father as pertaining to
[1:06:35] the flesh has found?
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; For if Abraham was justified,
[1:06:42] you remember we took the word last night
[1:06:45] which was the invisible union of the
[1:06:47] bride of Jesus Christ. By the way,
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; if you want to hear what he's talking
[1:06:51] about last night, the invisible union of
[1:06:54] the bride, the word justified by works
[1:06:57] he has whereof to glory, but not before
[1:07:01] God.
[1:07:03] For what saith the scripture? Abraham
[1:07:06] believed God, and it was counted unto
[1:07:10] him for righteousness sake. And I think
[1:07:13] that's the critical factor there,
[1:07:15] brothers and sisters. Tonight, I'm going
[1:07:16] to dwell on that just for a second.
[1:07:18] Abraham believed God.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; That's what it took.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; It didn't take anything else.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Even though his works expressed that he
[1:07:30] fully believed what God told him.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; And to him that workketh is the reward
[1:07:36] not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
[1:07:39] Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Now what Paul is referring to here is
[1:07:43] what God seen in Abraham.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Now now let's if you we was not turning
[1:07:51] too much we'd go back again to Genesis
[1:07:54] the 15th chapter and the sixth verse 156
[1:07:58] I believe is right. We'll begin at the
[1:08:00] 5th.
[1:08:02] And he brought him forth abroad and
[1:08:04] said, "Look now towards the heavens and
[1:08:07] tell the stars, if thou are able to
[1:08:10] number them." And he said unto him, "So
[1:08:14] shall thy seed be."
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham believed those words.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; And because of that, he knew that God
[1:08:24] had to provide a sacrifice. Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; It wasn't actually a question in his
[1:08:31] mind or in his heart. Maybe turn over.
[1:08:34] Let's turn over to Genesis chapter 22.
[1:08:48] Before we read it, I'm just going to
[1:08:50] read this quote. Is works is faith
[1:08:52] expressed. Another one here. He says,
[1:08:53] "Now the two men
[1:08:56] that were t talking on faith, Paul
[1:08:59] justified Abraham by what God saw in
[1:09:02] Abraham. But James justified Abraham
[1:09:08] by what man saw in Abraham."
[1:09:11] See, now James said he's justified by
[1:09:15] his works.
[1:09:17] Paul said he's justified by faith.
[1:09:22] Now we have a prophet in this age, this
[1:09:24] dispensation, preaching a service called
[1:09:26] works is faith expressed.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; The lives that we live expresses the
[1:09:33] faith that we have.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; We can talk about all the faith that
[1:09:38] we've got, but our lives demonstrate
[1:09:41] that faith.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; He says, but see, Abraham believed God.
[1:09:48] That's what God saw in him. He believed
[1:09:51] it. But then when he went to acting as
[1:09:56] though it was already done,
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; that's what man saw in him.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; The works were not. Oh, I don't know. I
[1:10:07] still feel sick.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know. I can't seem to find a
[1:10:11] job. There's nothing. Oh, no. I don't
[1:10:14] know. The song leader, the pastor, the
[1:10:17] deacon. Ah,
[1:10:19] you know our speech betrays us when we
[1:10:22] say that we believe but yet we start
[1:10:24] doing all those things. Do we really
[1:10:26] believe?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; But then when he went acting as though
[1:10:33] it was already done, that's what man saw
[1:10:36] in him.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; And don't think for a second that God
[1:10:39] never saw it either.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; God saw very clearly that he was acting
[1:10:44] on what he believed. Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; He was speaking on what he believed.
[1:10:48] Remember that he over the course of the
[1:10:50] years he had servants come against him
[1:10:53] and mock him. Brother Brandham said, "Oh
[1:10:55] yeah, you got the baby yet?"
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; We know that even brother Brandham, he
[1:10:59] was mocked, wasn't he
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; about Joseph? He was told he was going
[1:11:03] to have Joseph.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; And people called him and said, "Oh
[1:11:07] yeah, you had another boy or a girl,
[1:11:08] right? You had a girl baby. Huh? I guess
[1:11:12] you were wrong." And he said, "It
[1:11:13] doesn't matter what anybody says." Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; God told me, "I'm going to have Joseph.
[1:11:17] I'm going to have a boy and his name is
[1:11:19] going to be Joseph." And we know that
[1:11:20] there's Joseph.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; He's even here.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; But Abraham had to go through all of
[1:11:26] that, right?
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Even to the point where the closest
[1:11:31] confidant in his life, his wife, said to
[1:11:34] him, "Honey,
[1:11:35] maybe it's just not going to work the
[1:11:37] way you think.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe God's just not going to do it the
[1:11:41] way that you believe, the way that you
[1:11:43] understand. Maybe you just misunderstand
[1:11:45] him. Maybe we need to go acting because
[1:11:47] works is faith expressed. Right.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Maybe we need to do something. We need
[1:11:53] to make it happen.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; And we know that God said, "Okay, go
[1:11:57] ahead.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; But it's not going to turn out right."
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; And we know that's the example, the
[1:12:03] perfect example of perfect will versus
[1:12:05] permissive will. Perfect will is simply
[1:12:07] believing God and then acting like he is
[1:12:10] doing it all.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Not just waiting for him to do it all.
[1:12:14] Remember I said acting like he will do
[1:12:16] it all.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Moving forward trusting that he is in
[1:12:20] control.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; But the permissive will is saying, "No
[1:12:24] way. No, it's taking too long.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You haven't responded to my text in
[1:12:29] time.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; You haven't answered my email yet."
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; I'll say it this way, too. You haven't
[1:12:35] let me preach,
[1:12:38] so it mustn't be right. So, I need to
[1:12:40] take matters into my own hands. I need
[1:12:42] to deal with this my own way. Well, go
[1:12:44] ahead. They that wait upon the Lord
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; shall renew their strength.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; You don't want to get ahead of the Lord.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; But here we have Abraham in this
[1:12:57] situation now. He's gone through all of
[1:12:59] that, all of the drama, all of the
[1:13:01] people trying to usurp their traditions
[1:13:04] and their ideas and their ways, even to
[1:13:07] his wife,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; saying we should just do it our way. And
[1:13:10] and we know it turned out that way. But
[1:13:12] finally, that promise that he trusted in
[1:13:15] 25 years later, they had a body change
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; and she even laughed up her sleeve
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; in front of Elohim.
[1:13:26] And
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; we know the prophet said if it wasn't
[1:13:29] because she was a part of Abraham,
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; she would have been destroyed.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; But because it would have hurt him,
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; he didn't hurt her.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; What a what a loving father.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous thing that is.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Don't ever think for a second that we
[1:13:45] don't look out for one another,
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; that God doesn't consider us in our
[1:13:48] lives. My goodness.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; But here we are with Abraham. And I'll
[1:13:54] just read this last paragraph 90. And
[1:13:56] that's the same as it is to us because
[1:13:59] our works express what faith we have.
[1:14:03] But if we're afraid to act on what we
[1:14:05] believe,
[1:14:07] then we do not believe it.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; If we're afraid to act on what we
[1:14:12] believe, then we do not believe it.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; See, you've got to believe it.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful. It's
[1:14:20] magnificent when you look at this. It's
[1:14:22] like the key to unlock the door to every
[1:14:23] single blessing in the Bible.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; What's the key? Only believe.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Because when we believe, then we're
[1:14:30] going to follow the word. When we follow
[1:14:32] the word, we're going to see the
[1:14:33] apostolic blessing in our lives.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; We're not just going to go and make the
[1:14:37] apostolic blessing so that we can say,
[1:14:39] "Wow, I've got the apostolic blessing.
[1:14:41] Now I believe. Look it. You saw this.
[1:14:43] You saw that. I was able to wave my
[1:14:45] magic wand and get God to move." That's
[1:14:47] not the way it works. But sometimes I
[1:14:49] believe even in the message it can
[1:14:50] appear that way. If we don't actually
[1:14:52] see the great mighty move of God by our
[1:14:55] our our our our efforts then something
[1:14:58] is wrong. And maybe sometimes it is. But
[1:15:01] we don't put works ahead of the word.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; The word goes first
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; every single time. You know in this
[1:15:08] message, Brother Brandham says one of
[1:15:09] the great mistakes that people make is
[1:15:11] they get hung up on emotion and they mix
[1:15:14] up emotion for faith.
[1:15:17] Faith has nothing to do with emotion.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Faith is the sixth sense. It's not part
[1:15:22] of these earthly senses.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; If we get these earthly senses involved,
[1:15:27] then we're actually not participating in
[1:15:30] true sixth sense faith.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; That's just brother Barry.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You know, in Genesis chapter 22, let's
[1:15:39] read from verse 6.
[1:15:43] Genesis 22:6.
[1:15:48] And Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:15:50] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son.
[1:15:54] And he took the fire in his hand and a
[1:15:56] knife.
[1:15:58] And they went both of them together.
[1:16:02] And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father,
[1:16:04] and said, "My father." He said, "Here am
[1:16:07] I, my son."
[1:16:10] He said, "Behold the fire and the wood,
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; but where is the lamb for a burnt
[1:16:18] offering?"
[1:16:20] You can imagine this conversation.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Isaac was pretty smart. He was starting
[1:16:25] to dial in.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; He was starting to see what was going on
[1:16:29] here. Wait a second, Daddy.
[1:16:32] I know that you can be a little bit
[1:16:33] fanatical when you start talking about
[1:16:35] that God of yours. [laughter]
[1:16:37] And by the way, did you tell mama that
[1:16:39] we're coming here?
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Right? Can you imagine the conversation?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible mentions that Isaac spake unto
[1:16:48] his dad, saying, "Identify the wood. I
[1:16:51] identify the knife, but where's the
[1:16:54] lamb?"
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:16:57] And Abraham said, "My son, God will
[1:17:00] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[1:17:02] offering." Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; So they went both of them together and
[1:17:06] they came to the place which God had
[1:17:08] told him of. And Abraham built an altar
[1:17:10] there and laid the wood in order and
[1:17:14] bound Isaac his son. I can't imagine
[1:17:16] having that conversation. Just trust me,
[1:17:18] son. Let me bind your hands. Trust me,
[1:17:20] son. Let me bind your feet. I'm just
[1:17:22] going to set you on top of this altar
[1:17:24] and I'm going to light the fire after I
[1:17:26] cut your throat. Don't worry. GOD'S
[1:17:28] GOING TO PROVIDE A SACRIFICE. Naturally
[1:17:30] speaking, he'd be saying, "Daddy, you're
[1:17:32] crazy."
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; If he's going to provide a sacrifice, is
[1:17:37] he going to make me go through all of
[1:17:38] that?
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Think about the emotional trauma.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; How many of us would do that with our
[1:17:47] children?
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And Abraham stretched forth his hand
[1:17:54] and took the knife to slay his son.
[1:17:58] And the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:17:59] him out of heaven and said,"Abraham,
[1:18:02] Abraham." And he said, "Here am I." And
[1:18:05] he said, "Lay not thine hand upon the
[1:18:07] lad, neither do thou anything unto him."
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; You could imagine that he probably just
[1:18:14] had a jubilee. Isaac was with a gag
[1:18:17] maybe in his mouth going,
[1:18:20] [crying]
[1:18:22] [laughter]
[1:18:24] "For now I know that thou fearthst God,
[1:18:27] seeing that thou hast with not has not
[1:18:30] withheld thy son, thine only son from
[1:18:32] me."
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; We know that Abraham, he worshiped
[1:18:35] there.
[1:18:36] It was right after that he looked around
[1:18:39] and he found the ram. It had to be a
[1:18:41] ram, not a lamb, caught in the thicket.
[1:18:45] and he took that and he sacrificed it as
[1:18:47] a type of Christ as the sacrifice for
[1:18:49] all of mankind.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; I think it's so beautiful because if we
[1:18:54] look at this quote that we just read and
[1:18:56] it's the same as it is to us because our
[1:18:59] works express what faith we have.
[1:19:02] Abraham was willing to go all of the
[1:19:05] way.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Trusting that if he did kill his son,
[1:19:09] that promise that he said, "Take a look
[1:19:11] up and see those stars. your seed is
[1:19:14] going to be just like those stars. And
[1:19:16] knowing that God gave him Isaac, Isaac
[1:19:18] came from their union together through
[1:19:21] the body change.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; It wasn't some other manipulation of the
[1:19:25] promise. It was exactly the way God said
[1:19:27] it. And you know, when we have a promise
[1:19:29] from God, brothers and sisters, it's not
[1:19:30] going to be a nebulous manipulation of
[1:19:34] the word for our day. It's going to be
[1:19:36] exactly the way that God said that it
[1:19:39] would be. Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; But that's where he knew I can act. I
[1:19:45] know that I can march forward with the
[1:19:46] revelation that God has given me because
[1:19:48] he will be obligated to raise him up
[1:19:51] again.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; How it would happen, what it would look
[1:19:56] like, who knows?
[1:19:58] But talk about faith. Talk about really
[1:20:01] true, genuine faith. to be able to pull
[1:20:04] the knife back after binding your son,
[1:20:06] trusting that if you chop his neck, it's
[1:20:08] going to turn out right. Wow.
[1:20:12] But, you know, looking at this this
[1:20:14] thing here, I I just believe it's 100%
[1:20:16] fresh tonight. I just can't imagine what
[1:20:18] kind of faith this stirred up in Isaac.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; For him to witness his dad following the
[1:20:25] Lord,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; holy,
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; pushing mama aside and saying, "Yeah, I
[1:20:31] love you, honey. You're wonderful.
[1:20:33] You're my help. You're You're my wife. I
[1:20:35] love you. But this is God.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; And I follow him.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; And as you follow me, you follow him.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; God wasn't calling Sarah. He was calling
[1:20:48] Abraham.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And that must have been a very difficult
[1:20:53] situation.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Very difficult. If anybody has ever seen
[1:20:57] the Bible in uh it's it's portrayed
[1:21:00] actually in I can't remember where it's
[1:21:02] at. There's a whole series called the
[1:21:04] Bible and it's really quite riveting but
[1:21:07] they portray this story and at the end
[1:21:09] of it Abraham and Isaac come down the
[1:21:12] mountain and Sarah is running up the
[1:21:14] mountain screaming frantically looking
[1:21:16] for Isaac and grabbing him and looking
[1:21:19] at her lunatic worshiping husband. It's
[1:21:22] portrayed in such a way. It's just it's
[1:21:24] just amazing to think about and and you
[1:21:26] know I I don't say that she was
[1:21:28] sacriiggious in that way that she didn't
[1:21:30] believe God herself. Don't get me wrong,
[1:21:32] but I think it's it's wonderful to look
[1:21:34] at it maybe from a human perspective
[1:21:35] because we live in a real world and and
[1:21:38] we deal with humanity. Every single one
[1:21:40] of us. We all have emotions.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; It's amazing to think about, but there's
[1:21:45] none of Sarah in that part of the story,
[1:21:47] is there?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; None of her.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; But you know, I just think it's so good.
[1:21:52] I'm going to read this quote and then
[1:21:53] we'll continue continue on here with the
[1:21:56] last few minutes we have. And that's the
[1:21:58] same as it is to us because our works
[1:22:01] express what faith we have. But if we're
[1:22:05] afraid to act on what we believe, then
[1:22:08] we do not believe it. See, you've got to
[1:22:11] believe it.
[1:22:13] And you know in this scripture here
[1:22:16] verse 12
[1:22:19] we heard the angel of the Lord come to
[1:22:20] him out of heaven and say Abraham
[1:22:22] Abraham he said not thine hand upon the
[1:22:24] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[1:22:27] for now I know that thou fearthst God.
[1:22:32] Did God just learn this?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; It's not something he just learned, is
[1:22:38] it?
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; If he did, he's not God.
[1:22:42] He wasn't God if he just learned that.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; This wasn't for God, was it?
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; This was exactly for Abraham. And I
[1:22:52] think it was exactly for Isaac because
[1:22:54] we know the promise came through Isaac.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And there's so much to read and talk
[1:22:59] about with Isaac, but we're not even
[1:23:01] going there tonight. But to think about
[1:23:02] it, how this must have instilled such a
[1:23:05] great faith in both of those men. Yes,
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; God wasn't learning this even though he
[1:23:12] said, "Now I know."
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Abraham was learning this.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Isaac was learning this. Now you know.
[1:23:19] And you know, brothers and sisters, when
[1:23:20] we go through these trials in our lives,
[1:23:22] when our works express the faith that we
[1:23:25] believe in God and his leadership in our
[1:23:28] lives, I think about all the brothers
[1:23:29] and sisters that immigrate maybe here to
[1:23:31] Canada, to Calgary, how you must follow
[1:23:34] the the Lord, the leadership of the Lord
[1:23:37] to say, I want you to pick up everything
[1:23:39] and move to a brand new country and pick
[1:23:41] up a brand new culture and go and find a
[1:23:43] job and somehow someway it's all going
[1:23:46] to work out for you.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. works is faith expressed.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; But you know, one of the things that I
[1:23:53] think is hallmark and I remember brother
[1:23:54] Ken preaching this real serious and real
[1:23:57] straight that you know when we're going
[1:23:59] to do that, there has to be a
[1:24:01] fellowship. There has to be a church.
[1:24:04] We've got to fellowship with believers.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; And if we're going to go somewhere just
[1:24:09] because of a job and say, "Well, you
[1:24:12] know, I I'll just figure out church
[1:24:13] later." It's not going to turn out
[1:24:15] right.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. when we just leave our
[1:24:17] family at home and say it's not it
[1:24:19] doesn't matter if you go to church on
[1:24:21] Wednesday night. Just raise your kids
[1:24:22] like that and see what happens.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Let them know that it's not important to
[1:24:26] go to church. It doesn't really matter.
[1:24:28] You could, you know, maybe just press
[1:24:29] play. Watch what happens. Doesn't turn
[1:24:33] out right all the time. Sometimes it
[1:24:36] does, but most times I don't know, man.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't do it. But we need to make
[1:24:42] sure that we've got fellowship. And you
[1:24:43] know, that's part of it. making sure
[1:24:45] that I can bring my family to the house
[1:24:47] of the Lord to be a part of a body
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; have brothers and sisters of like
[1:24:51] precious faith
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; that I can fellowship with that I can
[1:24:55] pray for that can pray for me that's why
[1:24:57] we have a body
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; you know this this whole story here it
[1:25:03] wasn't for God to know it was all about
[1:25:05] Abraham and his own revelation for him
[1:25:08] to realize that I actually followed God
[1:25:11] holy
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; and we know that's exactly what Caleb
[1:25:14] said. Right.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I followed God holy. I followed Jehovah
[1:25:19] holy. I followed him all the days of my
[1:25:21] life holy. And how did he do it? He
[1:25:24] followed him through the prophet.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; He followed him through the prophets.
[1:25:28] And because of that,
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; he was able to have the faith enough to
[1:25:31] say, you know what? Now it's my time.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; This is my day. I want my inheritance.
[1:25:37] So give me my mountain.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; We know that he was able to say that.
[1:25:40] Why was he able to do that? because he
[1:25:42] was of another spirit.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; But he believed, he had faith to act on
[1:25:47] the word in his life.
[1:25:50] I just think it's so beautiful. You
[1:25:51] know, Abraham, he had that revelation.
[1:25:53] Ain't nothing going to get between me
[1:25:55] and that word.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; No person, no situation, nothing's going
[1:25:58] to get between me and that word. If
[1:26:00] there's a problem or a situation, God's
[1:26:02] going to deal with it for me because
[1:26:04] nothing's going to get between me and
[1:26:06] that word. It's got to be that powerful
[1:26:09] in our lives. Abraham needed to know
[1:26:11] this and so did Isaac and I can't help
[1:26:13] but think even Sarah. Everyone around
[1:26:15] them needed to know and you know the
[1:26:17] whole world needed to know because
[1:26:18] that's why it's written in this book.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Imagine if Abraham was afraid to act on
[1:26:24] it. It wouldn't even be in here, would
[1:26:27] it?
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; But sometimes, brothers and sisters, God
[1:26:30] will ask the hard things.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And I don't discount that for a second
[1:26:36] because some of the hard things are
[1:26:38] really hard.
[1:26:40] And nobody can actually relate to how
[1:26:43] hard they really are in our lives. But
[1:26:46] God knows.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't give them to punish us.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Why does he give them to us? It's to
[1:26:54] show us how much we really believe.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Because our works express the faith that
[1:27:00] he has given us.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; So if a real hard trial comes our way,
[1:27:04] do we just quit?
[1:27:06] Do we just say there's nothing to it and
[1:27:08] go home? or do we push harder? Do we do
[1:27:12] we get up and and go further? Do we keep
[1:27:15] pressing on like brother Brandham heard?
[1:27:17] You know, our perspective, brothers and
[1:27:18] sisters, many times we see ourselves in
[1:27:20] Romans chapter 7. I'm not going to read
[1:27:23] the scripture tonight. I'm just going to
[1:27:24] paraphrase it. Paul looking at his body
[1:27:27] says, "Oh, who can deliver me this vile
[1:27:29] body that I'm stuck in? Who can deliver
[1:27:31] me from this flesh that I'm in?" And you
[1:27:34] know, we just need to turn the page,
[1:27:36] don't we? Because the turning the page
[1:27:38] goes to Romans chapter 8 verse1 says
[1:27:40] there is therefore now right now
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; present tense now no condemnation to
[1:27:45] those who are in Christ
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh but
[1:27:50] actually believe and are willing to
[1:27:52] express their faith through their works
[1:27:55] because they don't walk after the flesh.
[1:27:57] But guess what? If we walk after the
[1:27:58] flesh, we're actually using our eyes.
[1:28:01] We're stumbling at the veil. We're
[1:28:02] looking at all of the natural
[1:28:03] circumstances and we're forgetting that
[1:28:06] there's way more for us than there are
[1:28:08] against us.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Such a beautiful thing. 1955, the waters
[1:28:13] of separation. Brother Brandham, he says
[1:28:16] how God sees us. God looking through the
[1:28:19] blood.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; He doesn't see you no more as a sinner.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; He sees you redeemed.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; He says that. Amen. You're redeemed
[1:28:28] because he always sees you through
[1:28:30] Christ.
[1:28:33] And remember, he says it somewhere in
[1:28:35] the message. I don't have it. I didn't
[1:28:36] have it up there either, but he says it
[1:28:38] somewhere in the message that he doesn't
[1:28:40] even see you.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; He only hears your voice.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; He only hears your voice.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; So when you come to church, what what's
[1:28:49] your voice?
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say.
[1:28:55] Is it like that or are you really I am
[1:28:58] so glad I can recognize that my soul was
[1:29:00] hanging over hell by one link, one
[1:29:03] broken link of a chain and he redeemed
[1:29:05] me. He's the one that redeemed me. He
[1:29:07] gave me the the the the ticket to
[1:29:10] eternal life. He did it for me. Are we
[1:29:12] on fire for the Lord?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; If he only hears our voice, then what do
[1:29:17] we express to him? What's our works?
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Some people will say, "Well, you can't
[1:29:21] sing. You don't have a voice." The word
[1:29:23] says, "Make a joyful noise." Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; How God sees us. God looking through the
[1:29:30] blood. He doesn't see you no more as a
[1:29:32] sinner. He sees you redeemed.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; You're redeemed because he always sees
[1:29:37] you through Christ. That's the reason we
[1:29:40] can be perfect. Not perfect in the sense
[1:29:42] of sinless. I love how he says this
[1:29:44] here. Not perfect in the sense of
[1:29:46] sinless. We're perfect in the eyes of
[1:29:48] God when we're in Christ. And what does
[1:29:51] that mean? It means that we're mature
[1:29:53] sons and daughters of God
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; because he sees us through the blood of
[1:29:57] Christ,
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; our theophanes. He sees us the way he
[1:30:00] made us,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; not stuck in this body here.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; That's the reason he said, "Be therefore
[1:30:06] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[1:30:09] perfect." We're already seated in
[1:30:11] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Paul in
[1:30:15] the 10th chapter of Hebrews trying to
[1:30:17] explain the law having a shadow of good
[1:30:19] things to come, not the very image of
[1:30:21] the things could never make the comer
[1:30:23] unto perfect because God was looking
[1:30:25] through animal blood. But now he looks
[1:30:28] through the blood of his son. Perfection
[1:30:30] come by Jesus Christ.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Now I'm not perfect in your sight. You
[1:30:35] may not be perfect in my sight. But what
[1:30:38] about in God's sight?
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; There's where it lays. And if you're
[1:30:43] born again into the body of Christ,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; then God looks upon you as perfect as
[1:30:50] Christ was himself.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that?
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; As perfect as Christ was, that's how he
[1:30:59] sees the believer.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; It's not done by works. Wait, I thought
[1:31:08] you said it was.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; No, it's not. It's not done by works.
[1:31:12] The works follow
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; and that's works is faith expressed in a
[1:31:17] nutshell. The works follow our belief.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; If we believe, our lives demonstrate we
[1:31:23] believe.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; And then sometimes we have to preach.
[1:31:27] Sometimes we'll say a word, but our
[1:31:29] lives speak volumes before people.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. It's not by works
[1:31:35] you can do at all. It's by grace.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; God has given you this offer. And if
[1:31:40] you've accepted it in the sight of God,
[1:31:43] you are perfect, redeemed, washed in the
[1:31:45] blood of the lamb without fault, without
[1:31:47] blemish, without spot. Isn't that
[1:31:49] marvelous?
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Now, brothers and sisters, this is 1955.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; The waters of separation.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; I'll call the musicians as we wrap up
[1:32:00] here, but you know, to think about this,
[1:32:04] that's how he sees us.
[1:32:06] You know how brother Brandham was one
[1:32:08] time in that diner?
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; I think it was a Sunday.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; He was traveling. They stopped in for
[1:32:14] some food. And while he was there, he
[1:32:17] was using his natural sight, wasn't he?
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; His perception was just a little bit
[1:32:22] off. And you know, I left out a whole
[1:32:24] bunch. There's so much in here. Maybe
[1:32:26] I'll get into it on Sunday. Perception
[1:32:28] is everything. I will. I'll save it for
[1:32:30] Sunday. You know, brother Brandham, in
[1:32:32] this diner, he's looking around and he's
[1:32:33] seeing the law men back in the 60s. It
[1:32:37] meant something.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; It still does today, but society has
[1:32:40] undermined it in such a terrible way.
[1:32:42] It's awful. It's just a a deliberate
[1:32:45] rebellious spirit. That's all
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; to to to rebel against authority to say
[1:32:50] that my opinion matters. Well, it
[1:32:52] doesn't matter when in the eyes of the
[1:32:53] law, but to some people, I guess it
[1:32:56] does. But to think about it, back in
[1:32:58] that day, there was the policeman and
[1:33:00] what was he doing? He was sitting there
[1:33:02] with a woman of ill fame. And what were
[1:33:05] they doing? They were playing a slot
[1:33:06] machine or something on a Sunday. They
[1:33:09] they were playing the the whatever they
[1:33:11] were doing. They had the music going.
[1:33:13] And brother Bradomy got so so upset in
[1:33:15] the moment, judging these people,
[1:33:18] thinking they should be protecting, you
[1:33:19] know, the law-abiding citizens. And on a
[1:33:21] Sunday in here, instead of being in
[1:33:23] church somewhere, they're in here
[1:33:24] listening to rock and roll and and and
[1:33:27] falling over each other and she was
[1:33:29] dressed immorally and the situation was
[1:33:31] terrible in the eyes of the prophet. And
[1:33:32] what did he do? He got up and went to
[1:33:34] the washroom and and God spoke to him in
[1:33:36] that moment. He prayed and said, "Lord,
[1:33:38] look at them. Look at them. It's
[1:33:40] disgusting that they would behave this
[1:33:42] way." And God popped him in a vision and
[1:33:44] said, "Listen here. I've got something
[1:33:46] for you."
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And he showed him the earth. And he
[1:33:51] showed him a bumper of blood around that
[1:33:53] earth. And then he showed him the face
[1:33:56] of Christ before it all. And he saw sins
[1:33:59] coming up out of the earth and hitting
[1:34:01] Christ in the face like punching him in
[1:34:03] the face and hurting him and punching
[1:34:05] him and hurting him and and we know
[1:34:07] brother Bradom in that moment he was
[1:34:09] like, "Yeah, amen. That's that woman.
[1:34:11] That's that cop. That's those people,
[1:34:13] those sinners."
[1:34:16] And what did Jesus say to him
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; in the vision? He said, "Uhuh. That's
[1:34:20] not them. That's your sin.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; As the vindicated prophet, that's you.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Your sins.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And what did it do? It changed his heart
[1:34:32] in a moment. It changed his perspective.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; He came out of that vision. And he went
[1:34:37] and he sat down and he sat sat down and
[1:34:39] he brought them kindness and love
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; and LED THEM TO CHRIST IN THE MOMENT
[1:34:44] instead of judging them
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; because he had a different perspective.
[1:34:49] Amen. [singing]
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; If you ever need a different
[1:34:52] perspective, just trust the Lord, man.
[1:34:54] He'll show you.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; He'll give you another perspective.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Just ask him.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Just like the prophet did for his
[1:35:00] helper. Lord, open the boy's eyes.
[1:35:03] Sometimes we HAVE TO SAY, LORD, OPEN MY
[1:35:05] EYES.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Show me what's going on because I'm
[1:35:09] caught up in the moment.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; We've got a a saying in North America.
[1:35:12] Sometimes you can't see the forest
[1:35:14] through the trees. You get so caught up
[1:35:16] in all of the three or four trees right
[1:35:18] in front of you, you forget there's an
[1:35:20] entire forest behind you.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes one or two little details can
[1:35:25] just totally drive us down.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Let's not forget what he's done for us.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Let's not forget [music] how he sees us.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me. I've got one more
[1:35:36] quote that I'm going to bring for us
[1:35:38] because I think it's so beautiful.
[1:35:40] Remember the last one we read was in
[1:35:42] 1955.
[1:35:43] If it anybody wonders pre-seals post
[1:35:46] seals this is the way it was post seals
[1:35:48] that was pre-seals and that was pretty
[1:35:50] good post seals 1965 invisible union the
[1:35:53] message that was preached the night
[1:35:54] before he says oh that spiritual union
[1:35:57] of Christ and his church now when the
[1:35:59] flesh is becoming word
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; and the word is becoming flesh
[1:36:05] manifested vindicated brothers and
[1:36:08] sisters don't put that off on the
[1:36:09] prophet take that home and say Is the
[1:36:13] word [music] becoming flesh in me?
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Am I becoming the word manifested and
[1:36:21] vindicated? My faith demonstrates works
[1:36:25] in my life. I'm walking towards what I
[1:36:28] believe. That's the vindication. It's
[1:36:30] not great signs and wonders. It's
[1:36:33] putting that word first.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Just what the Bible said would happen in
[1:36:38] this day. It's happening day by day. I
[1:36:41] love that. Don't you?
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Whether we see it, whether we understand
[1:36:45] it, whether we believe it, there's
[1:36:47] people on earth, this is taking place in
[1:36:50] their lives where they are becoming the
[1:36:52] word. The word is becoming flesh in
[1:36:55] them.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Just what the Bible said would happen in
[1:36:58] this day. It's happening day by day.
[1:37:00] Why? It's culminating so fast out there
[1:37:02] in those deserts and things taking place
[1:37:04] that I couldn't keep up with it. We're
[1:37:05] near the coming of Jesus to be united
[1:37:07] with his church where the word becomes
[1:37:09] the word.
[1:37:12] Not people become the word. The word
[1:37:14] becomes the word. That genetic seed gene
[1:37:17] of [music] God that was in us before the
[1:37:18] foundation of the world. The word
[1:37:20] becomes the word. Calling of the Holy
[1:37:22] Spirit, searching of [music] the hearts.
[1:37:24] Here he is now. He said before, standing
[1:37:26] like you never did it before. A few
[1:37:28] paragraphs back. Here he says it now.
[1:37:30] You standing. You're standing
[1:37:33] completely. You never sinned at the
[1:37:36] first place. God don't even know
[1:37:38] nothing. It's in the sea of
[1:37:40] forgetfulness.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; He says you never did it.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Can we say this about our worst enemies
[1:37:48] here on earth?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Because if we can't say this about our
[1:37:52] worst enemies, then we might as well
[1:37:53] take what the prophet just said [music]
[1:37:54] and put it on the shelf.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; And just wait until God changes our
[1:37:59] heart. Because the way that we judge is
[1:38:02] the way that we will be judged.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; But when we're willing to do with our
[1:38:06] enemies
[1:38:08] what God has done with our sin,
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; then we don't have anything in our hand
[1:38:15] holding us down. We can just raise our
[1:38:17] hands to the Lord and say, "Praise you,
[1:38:18] Lord. Thank you, Lord, because I know
[1:38:20] what you've done for me. Oh my. You
[1:38:22] don't even see my sin. It's in the sea
[1:38:24] of your forgetfulness."
[1:38:26] To think that that's exactly what he
[1:38:28] does for us. It's in the sea of
[1:38:30] forgetfulness. You never did it. You
[1:38:34] were accused of it by the accuser, but
[1:38:36] really from the beginning, you were
[1:38:38] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:38:41] of God.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; I love it how he says that. It's not
[1:38:44] even just you're a son and all the
[1:38:46] daughters are kind of wondering,
[1:38:47] scratching their head, uh, [music] where
[1:38:49] am I standing? No, no. He says it to be
[1:38:51] a son and daughter of God. You're
[1:38:53] standing there washed and your old book
[1:38:55] of divorcement is put away and it's
[1:38:57] dead. absolutely out of existence
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; even in the mind of God.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; How can that be? I don't know. And you
[1:39:07] know, I don't even care. [music] I just
[1:39:09] say, "Amen. I'll take it. I'll take it.
[1:39:11] I'll take it."
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; And here he says, "You're the virtuous
[1:39:15] bride of Christ, washed in the blood of
[1:39:17] Christ, precious, virtuous, sinless son
[1:39:19] of God, standing with the pure,
[1:39:21] unadulterated bride word that he washed
[1:39:24] by the water of his own blood."
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:28] my
[1:39:31] that become flesh and [music] manifested
[1:39:34] that he might take you which were
[1:39:36] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[1:39:39] before the beginning the same as he was.
[1:39:43] He was that great [music] attribute of
[1:39:44] God called love. Remember brothers and
[1:39:47] sisters, the way that he sees us when we
[1:39:51] take his word, the way that he's given
[1:39:52] it to us in the day in which we live,
[1:39:54] the way he sees us is the way he sees
[1:39:58] Christ.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said. Why
[1:40:02] [music] is that? Because he doesn't look
[1:40:04] at us. He looks at Christ.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Help us to look away to Jesus.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly
[1:40:12] Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[1:40:13] these words. Thank you, Lord Jesus, that
[1:40:16] we have the [music] ability to have a
[1:40:18] different perception, Lord. That you can
[1:40:21] open our eyes to the things that [music]
[1:40:22] we need to see. And Father, that you can
[1:40:25] close our eyes to the things that we
[1:40:27] don't need to see. Father, I pray that
[1:40:29] in the world in which we live in that
[1:40:31] you would help us now more than ever to
[1:40:34] close our eyes to the things of this
[1:40:37] world, Lord, and open our eyes to the
[1:40:39] things of life, Lord. the word in its
[1:40:43] fullness, Lord Jesus, [music]
[1:40:45] for the day in which we live because we
[1:40:47] know that's what will entitle us to your
[1:40:49] token. And we know that that token is
[1:40:52] the earnest of what you have given us,
[1:40:54] Father, because eye has not seen,
[1:40:56] neither has ear heard. Oh, hasn't even
[1:40:59] entered into the heart of a man. What
[1:41:01] lies in store for us. So, Father, we're
[1:41:03] so excited for that day.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, not to res refuse
[1:41:08] you, Lord.
[1:41:10] Yes.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to consummate that
[1:41:13] marriage,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; to move from being just a bride, oh Lord
[1:41:17] Jesus, to becoming your wife,
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; to have that level of intimacy where the
[1:41:22] two become one,
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; cuz we know that's what it will take to
[1:41:28] make the rapture. [music]
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Pray that you would just watch over us,
[1:41:31] Lord. That you would continue revealing
[1:41:33] yourself to us and through us. We just
[1:41:36] ask that you would [music] bless each
[1:41:37] one, Father, who's made the effort to
[1:41:39] come out tonight. Be with those, Lord,
[1:41:41] who couldn't come, Father, wherever they
[1:41:43] are, whatever they're doing. We pray
[1:41:45] that you would just minister to them
[1:41:47] sovereignly wherever they are. Father,
[1:41:49] maybe some tuning in later, streaming
[1:41:51] after.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you're not bound by
[1:41:54] time or space.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; We just ask that you would open our
[1:41:57] eyes, Lord. We love you and we thank
[1:42:00] you. We just ask all these things in
[1:42:02] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:42:04] Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; You are awesome in this place.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; You are awesome in this place. Mighty
[1:42:17] God,
[1:42:20] you are awesome [singing and music] in
[1:42:23] this place. Aba Father,

[1:42:32] praise.

[1:42:40] in this place. Mighty God,
[1:42:45] as I come into your presence,
[1:42:48] as I come into your presence,
[1:42:53] ask the [music and singing] gates of
[1:42:55] praise,
[1:42:57] into your sanctuary, [music and singing]
[1:43:01] till we're standing face to face.
[1:43:06] I look upon your mountains. I see the
[1:43:11] fullness [singing and music] of your
[1:43:13] grace and I can only bow down.
[1:43:21] [music]
[1:43:23] You are [singing]
