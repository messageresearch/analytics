[34:30] as we carry on our journey in the
[34:32] exposition of the seven Church
[34:34] ages Revelation Chapter 2 is the
[34:38] beginning of the word through Revelation
[34:41] to John the
[34:43] Revelator from that one who was standing
[34:46] in the midst of the candlesticks with
[34:49] the Seven Stars in his hand with the
[34:51] Flames of of fire for his eyes and feet
[34:54] as brass and my what a
[34:59] depiction that one he's giving the
[35:04] uh he's given the word to the churches
[35:07] now in Revelations chapter 2 so
[35:10] Revelations chap 2 verse
[35:12] one says unto the angel of the Church of
[35:15] Ephesus write these things saith he that
[35:19] holdeth the Seven Stars in his right
[35:21] hand who walketh in the midst of the
[35:24] seven golden candlesticks
[35:27] I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy
[35:31] patience and how thou c not bear them
[35:34] which are evil and how thou Hast tried
[35:38] them which say they are Apostles and are
[35:41] not and Hast found them
[35:45] liars and Hast borne and Hast patience
[35:50] and for my names sake has labored and
[35:53] Hast not
[35:54] fainted nevertheless I have some what
[35:57] against thee because thou Hast left thy
[36:00] First
[36:01] Love remember therefore from whence Thou
[36:04] Art fallen and repent and do the first
[36:08] works or else I will come unto thee
[36:11] quickly and will remove thy Candlestick
[36:13] out of his place except thou
[36:17] repent but this thou Hast that thou
[36:20] hatest the Deeds of the
[36:23] nians which I also hate he that hath an
[36:27] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[36:30] unto the churches to him that overcometh
[36:33] will I give to eat of the tree of life
[36:36] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[36:39] god let's just bow one more
[36:42] time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight

[36:50] scripture Lord Jesus and and read it by
[36:52] Revelation Lord knowing that you have
[36:55] intended for us to to really understand
[36:57] what this means that you have not left
[37:00] it undone it was for many many years but
[37:03] we know now it's revealed to those who

[38:46] somebody has a prayer request it's an
[38:49] easy way to mention it to the whole
[38:50] entire body that there is a need and it
[38:53] can get to people right away and I
[38:55] really don't want to see it get clogged
[38:57] up with uh too many quotes of scripture
[39:00] or what's resting on people's hearts
[39:03] that sort of thing we can chat
[39:04] individually but uh we just want to keep
[39:07] that line of communication open for uh
[39:09] matters that we need to communicate very
[39:11] quickly so that's why we have this uh
[39:14] this activities chat created so we have
[39:16] the the skate happening at bones Park
[39:18] this Friday at 7M um before that we have
[39:22] the men's meeting happening tomorrow
[39:24] evening at the church here so that will
[39:26] be at uh 7:30 downstairs in the
[39:29] basement um I just love looking over the
[39:33] the month of March the 10th of March is
[39:36] daylight savings time that's where we
[39:39] lose an hour we Spring Forward we set
[39:42] our clocks one hour ahead so that
[39:45] happens on uh the 10th and then the 19th
[39:49] which is not very far after that is the
[39:51] first day of spring we're actually going
[39:54] to be entering into the spring months
[39:56] now it's uh it's amazing it feels like
[39:59] we haven't even really experienced
[40:00] winter here yet because we haven't had
[40:02] that much snow usually we get a lot more
[40:04] but um so we're already entering into
[40:07] spring this month near the middle of the
[40:09] month it's pretty amazing so the 21st uh
[40:12] we've got a prayer meeting scheduled for
[40:13] 7:30 at the church on the 22nd we have
[40:17] an indoor arena skate half of the Arena
[40:20] will be uh for just skating around if
[40:22] you just want to skate and the other
[40:24] half will be for those people who like
[40:25] stick and pucks if you'd like to uh I
[40:29] don't know if there's such a thing as
[40:31] half court in hockey um maybe someone
[40:34] like Logan could help educate us but
[40:37] we're going to play hockey on one end of
[40:38] the rink and uh we're just going to
[40:39] skate around the other end of the rink
[40:41] so that will be on the 22nd the 24th at
[40:44] 6 PM we're going to have communion
[40:46] service here and uh that's actually Palm
[40:48] Sunday I think it's a a real good thing
[40:51] that we could just have a communion
[40:52] service then and uh maybe in preparation
[40:55] for the Easter services we have Brother
[40:57] David dehart I think I mentioned I have
[40:59] confirmed he's coming and that will be
[41:01] on the 29th the 30th and the 31st we're
[41:04] going to have uh service 7:30 p.m.
[41:07] Friday the 29th 6:00 p.m. on the 30th
[41:10] and uh 10:00 a.m. on the
[41:14] 31st and uh going into April we have a
[41:17] gym night booked on April the 6th um
[41:20] actually it's a gym day I'm going to
[41:23] have a gym night in the day I guess that
[41:26] will be uh April the 6th from 1: to 4:00
[41:28] p.m. in the afternoon just to try
[41:30] something a little different to see if
[41:32] it's uh easier for folks or more
[41:35] difficult um we're certainly flexible to
[41:38] do things so that we can make it as
[41:39] convenient for everyone as possible but
[41:41] we just thought we'd try something
[41:43] different um we were able to participate
[41:45] in a a gym day in Saskatchewan when we
[41:48] went out there and it was really quite
[41:49] nice to do it during the day so we'll
[41:51] just see what happens there and then
[41:54] August we have have brother Andrew
[41:56] Glover coming August 16th 17th and 18th
[42:00] again it'll be a Friday evening a
[42:01] Saturday evening and a Sunday morning
[42:03] service so uh you'll be able to find
[42:06] those events all on the calendar and uh
[42:09] I trust that's going to be okay for
[42:11] everyone tonight are you happy tonight I
[42:15] just was uh thinking and I hadn't said
[42:18] anything I I I think that we are in what
[42:22] they call a leap year this year
[42:24] typically this is the end of the month
[42:26] today February 28th um the shortest
[42:30] month of the year but tomorrow we
[42:32] actually have one more day so um some
[42:35] folks are either lucky enough or unlucky
[42:38] enough to be born on the 29th of
[42:40] February and that means they get a
[42:42] birthday once every four years which is
[42:45] kind of difficult to imagine but I know
[42:47] there's other ways to celebrate it than
[42:49] waiting every four years but you have to
[42:51] imagine there'd be quite a gift if you
[42:53] had to wait every four years for a
[42:55] present
[42:56] but uh anyways picking up where we left
[43:00] off in the exposition of the seven
[43:02] Church
[43:03] ages
[43:05] um we left off on page 72 and I I just I
[43:10] don't know I just can't help but get
[43:11] excited every time I get into this it
[43:13] just seems to get good and good better
[43:15] and better um when you see what God was
[43:20] saying to his people through the prophet
[43:22] and uh how he wanted to express it in
[43:25] this book so that would understand it
[43:27] that there would be no questions if we
[43:29] really read this book and we really
[43:31] meditate upon the words that are said
[43:33] here how it always points back to
[43:36] scripture and how important it is if
[43:38] we're going to be a Christian why would
[43:40] we want to settle for some other Avenue
[43:43] to be a Christian other than the word of
[43:46] God but we know many times there's uh
[43:50] there's a lot of antichrist behavior and
[43:53] maybe that sounds really sharp but you
[43:54] know anything that it's not according to
[43:57] the word of God is Antichrist that's the
[43:59] way it is it's either yes or it's no
[44:02] it's one or it's zero it's not uh uh
[44:05] many different shades of Christianity
[44:07] which is what the devil has tried to do
[44:09] and you know here we're getting into the
[44:12] the the the Ephesian Church age and
[44:15] brother brandham really begins to lay
[44:17] out what really happened and and why we
[44:20] have all of these differing opinions and
[44:22] why we have all of the the many
[44:25] different versions of what we would
[44:26] potentially call Christianity but there
[44:28] really only is one Christianity and that
[44:31] word Christian means Christlike and the
[44:34] only people that are Christlike are the
[44:36] ones that take the full word of God
[44:38] without measure without watering it down
[44:41] or trying to take and and make it say
[44:43] something different maybe take a
[44:45] different version of the Bible and say
[44:47] well I know the prophet of God read from
[44:49] the King James version but I really like
[44:51] this one you know what we need to do is
[44:53] just push aside all of our own thinking
[44:55] and just allow the mind that was once in
[44:58] Christ Jesus Come into us because once
[45:00] his mind comes inside of us then we'll
[45:02] start to look at things the way that
[45:04] he's fully intended for us but you know
[45:06] where we left off um paragraph 26 on
[45:10] page 72 of the exposition of the seven
[45:13] Church ages brother brother Bram is
[45:15] talking about the the different
[45:17] different revivals that had happened and
[45:20] you know first paragraph 25 he talks
[45:22] about the Welsh Revival and and how what
[45:26] happened was every time that God moved
[45:28] so did Satan there's always twins
[45:31] brother Bram says not here in this
[45:32] paragraph but every time there was a
[45:34] great move of God the devil moves also
[45:36] and and this day and age is no different
[45:38] and that's what he's bringing out here
[45:40] but he says in the great Welsh Revival
[45:42] the insane asylums filled up quickly and
[45:43] there was a great display of devil power
[45:45] to take away the attention from
[45:48] God in paragraph 26 in Luther's day it
[45:51] said that the miracle of his ministry
[45:53] did not lie in the fact that he
[45:54] successfully protested the Roman
[45:55] Catholic church but the miracle lay in
[45:58] the fact he could and did stay sound and
[46:02] sane amidst the Fanatics who are often
[46:06] filled with and guided by wrong
[46:09] spirits and you know brothers and
[46:11] sisters those Spirits were not
[46:13] necessarily raging monster evil demon
[46:16] Spirits I'll say they're very highly
[46:19] polished
[46:21] religious Spirits Christian
[46:24] impersonating spirits
[46:26] that would get in amongst the Believers
[46:29] brother bam goes on to say and if you
[46:30] have been aware of this last day
[46:32] Ministry his ministry Christ's Ministry
[46:35] through him you will have noted the same
[46:37] invasion of false and wicked Spirits it
[46:40] has to be that way am it's amazing
[46:43] because I I I I myself don't know much
[46:46] about the message of the hour I would
[46:48] say I I I I came into the message I
[46:50] didn't even hear about the message of
[46:51] the hour until
[46:53] 2005 and so I mean that's a few years
[46:56] but there's other people here that have
[46:58] known about it way longer than I have
[47:00] and we know that there's no such thing
[47:01] as Apostolic succession or or or
[47:05] greater position in the Kingdom because
[47:07] we've known about the message longer
[47:09] we're not saying that but what I am
[47:10] saying is there has the stories that
[47:14] I've heard just since 2005 about people
[47:17] who have been given the opportunity to
[47:19] have a Ministry in this message of the
[47:22] hour and how they've taken it and
[47:24] perverted it and perverted it for their
[47:26] own sakes take it and twisted it and
[47:29] destroyed people's
[47:31] lives watch people go literally insane
[47:35] because of the way they mishandle this
[47:37] word of God brother brandom he talks
[47:39] about the three-sided
[47:41] club and how he had that Vision remember
[47:44] he saw that man that big strong man how
[47:47] he was taken this club and there was
[47:49] this woman and every time she would
[47:51] start to gather her strength while she
[47:53] was on the ground she would come to her
[47:55] feet tried to get on her feet again and
[47:57] every time she would get up and start to
[47:58] become strong again what did that man do
[48:01] he'd take that three-sided club and he
[48:03] called it a trinitarian club three-sided
[48:05] and he would clobber her with it knock
[48:08] her right back down you know that's a
[48:11] nickan
[48:13] spirit but that
[48:15] happens it's amazing because all of that
[48:18] is around the guise of this message of
[48:19] the hour that's why it's so important
[48:22] brothers and sisters if I was to maybe
[48:24] get hit by a bus and never be here again
[48:26] and you can't rely on brother Barry to
[48:28] lead you and guide you you've got to
[48:30] know where you stand you got to eat this
[48:31] book yourself you got to know the
[48:34] message of the hour yourself because if
[48:35] another Minister were to come into the
[48:37] church and begin to minister how would
[48:39] you know if he was preaching truth or
[48:42] not you got to know where you
[48:45] stand we might not live here maybe we
[48:48] move somewhere else maybe we have
[48:50] another Pastor another church how do you
[48:52] know if he's preaching the truth you
[48:55] have have to know there's a lot of
[48:57] invasion of false and wicked spirits and
[49:00] brother bradam says it has to be that
[49:03] way he says now I hope and trust you are
[49:06] spiritual minded enough to get that and
[49:08] capitalize on it that means get the Holy
[49:12] Ghost capitalize on it know that those
[49:15] Spirits are going to be so close they
[49:17] would deceive the very elected if people
[49:20] claim to know the message of the hour
[49:21] claim to be on fire for the Lord then
[49:24] they're going to live this word of God
[49:26] they're going to live the message of the
[49:28] hour they're not just going to hide
[49:30] behind it but starting with our our new
[49:34] new uh new page tonight page 73 of the
[49:38] exposition of the seven Church ages
[49:40] brother Bram he says to seal up this
[49:42] point on the true and false Vines
[49:44] mingling and demonstrating the two
[49:46] spirits that are at work let us look
[49:49] into these
[49:50] scriptures isn't that beautiful doesn't
[49:53] say Let us look into the encyclopedia
[49:55] let's look at Wikipedia let's look and
[49:57] see what Oral Roberts said or one of the
[50:00] other Ministries around let's look into
[50:02] the scriptures 1 John 41:4 beloved
[50:06] believe not every Spirit but try the
[50:10] spirits whether they are of God because
[50:13] many false prophets are gone out into
[50:16] the world hereby ye know the spirit of
[50:18] God every spirit that confesseth that
[50:21] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of
[50:24] God and every spirit that confesseth not
[50:28] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[50:31] is not of God and this is that Spirit of
[50:36] antichrist whereof ye have heard it that
[50:38] it should come and even now already is
[50:42] it is in the
[50:43] world ye are of God little children and
[50:46] have overcome them Antichrist spirit
[50:49] because greater is he God's spirit that
[50:52] is in you than he that is in the world I
[50:55] just want to back up and talk about this
[50:57] a little bit here we can read this
[50:59] scripture and it might sound really
[51:01] plain and cut and dried in every spirit
[51:03] that that that every spirit that
[51:06] confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in
[51:08] the flesh is of God and and that's very
[51:10] true but there's a lot of people that
[51:12] might profess that Jesus Christ has come
[51:15] in the flesh but there's me there's
[51:17] there's spirits that get into people
[51:19] that would say Jesus Christ came in the
[51:21] flesh but he wasn't
[51:23] God have they confessed that Jesus
[51:25] Christ CHR Has Come In the
[51:27] Flesh and you know it's so subtle
[51:30] brothers and sisters so subtle so subtle
[51:33] one word off is Satan's
[51:35] kingdom Jude
[51:37] 3:4 Jude 34 and2 beloved when I gave all
[51:41] diligence to write unto you of the
[51:43] common salvation it was needful for me
[51:45] to write unto you and to exhort you that
[51:47] you should earnestly contend for the
[51:49] faith that was once delivered unto the
[51:52] Saints for there are certain men not
[51:55] Saints I love how he says that I had to
[51:59] highlight that not Saints crept in
[52:02] unawares these have not come into the
[52:04] fold by means of the door and are
[52:07] therefore
[52:09] robbers and we know that Jesus tells the
[52:13] story about the wedding supper the
[52:15] wedding Feast doesn't he there's no back
[52:17] door brothers and sisters there's no
[52:20] basement entrance there's no side window
[52:23] or or fire escape that's going to get us
[52:25] in there and and you know what's
[52:27] interesting I I I I know I heard this
[52:30] preach once upon a time I believe
[52:31] brother Ken did once upon a time there
[52:33] was a man that made it into that wedding
[52:35] feast and he never had a garment on
[52:37] right so there's people that are going
[52:39] to get there the wrong
[52:41] way or it wouldn't be said that way in
[52:44] the Bible right and what happens to
[52:48] them they're grabbed they're bound at
[52:51] the instructions of the Lord and they're
[52:54] cast into outer Darkness Ness where
[52:55] there's wailing and nashing of teeth
[52:58] there's only one way and today we're
[53:01] talking about the way the truth and the
[53:03] life for the elected some people want to
[53:06] go before the white throne and and I
[53:09] don't know if I'd want to do that if I
[53:10] knew about this truth I think the word
[53:13] of God says it would be better for them
[53:14] to not have
[53:15] known but you know there's certain men
[53:18] that have crept in unawares they've not
[53:21] come into the fold by means of the door
[53:22] and are therefore robbers who were
[53:25] before old ordained to this condemnation
[53:28] ungodly men turning the grace of our God
[53:30] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[53:33] Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ these
[53:37] are spots in your feasts of Charity when
[53:40] they Feast with you feeding themselves
[53:44] without
[53:47] fear I just I just marveled at that when
[53:52] I was looking at this and I still do
[53:54] because we're not necessarily talking
[53:56] about coming to maybe someone's house or
[53:59] or a community center somewhere where
[54:02] we're having a a community Feast where
[54:04] we're having a potluck brothers and
[54:06] sisters we're talking about the table of
[54:08] the Lord we're talking about coming to
[54:10] the church where we worship where we
[54:12] enter
[54:13] in these ungodly men turn up but you
[54:17] know what they were ordained of that now
[54:19] I'm sorry it sounds awkward everyone's
[54:22] awfully quiet but you know what brother
[54:23] bradam says there's three typ of
[54:25] Believers in every group but it ain't up
[54:28] to us to try and determine who's who
[54:30] it's up to
[54:32] God alls we can do is try and encourage
[54:34] one another to the
[54:37] word brother Bram goes on to say it
[54:39] cannot be denied in the face of these
[54:41] scriptures that the true church and the
[54:43] false church are
[54:46] intertwined having been planted together
[54:49] but of different
[54:51] seeds now we got into a topic earlier
[54:54] this week on the the the Bible study the
[54:56] morning Bible study and I just thought
[54:58] it was so good you know when you plant a
[55:00] garden some some of us here well versed
[55:03] at garden planting and uh you know when
[55:06] you plant a garden I don't know very
[55:08] much about it I know a little bit but I
[55:10] know this much when you get a garden and
[55:13] you got the plot of land and you know
[55:14] kind of lay it out the way you want to
[55:16] grow and do things you get your seeds
[55:19] and you got packages that identify what
[55:21] the seeds are you don't just take the
[55:23] seeds and dump them all into to a
[55:25] container and then start throwing seeds
[55:28] into the
[55:28] rows you do that with one type of seed
[55:32] per row and you might stop planting and
[55:35] then plant something new or different in
[55:37] that same row further down the line but
[55:40] you don't just mix all the seeds
[55:42] together because you won't be able to
[55:43] tell what's what you plant your seeds
[55:46] separately you keep your seeds organized
[55:48] you make sure that you know what seed is
[55:50] what because if you took the the
[55:51] wrappers away you wouldn't be able to
[55:53] pick out maybe the celery seeds or or
[55:56] maybe the pea seeds or or whatever the
[55:58] seeds are carrot seeds mustard seeds all
[56:01] the different seeds you wouldn't be able
[56:02] to individually pick them out of a a
[56:04] bowl full of seeds you need to keep them
[56:06] organized but my point with all of that
[56:09] is you can't tell what they are just by
[56:11] looking at the seeds they actually have
[56:13] to begin to
[56:14] grow and if you don't keep track of what
[56:17] they are when they begin to grow you
[56:18] might think one is a weed and pull that
[56:20] weed out but you're actually taking one
[56:23] that you want and and realistically if
[56:26] they're all seeds that you planted every
[56:27] one of them is one that you wanted but
[56:30] they all have to grow and usually when
[56:32] they grow they sprout they look the same
[56:35] and as they grow a little taller they
[56:36] still look pretty close to the same but
[56:38] once they get to a certain height you
[56:39] can start to discern and tell which ones
[56:42] are what you want which ones are planted
[56:44] in that row that you want but really
[56:46] some of them are so close together you
[56:48] won't be able to tell anything until
[56:49] they bear fruit until they actually show
[56:52] what their life is till it goes back
[56:53] into the seed form
[56:55] but brother Bram says it cannot be
[56:57] denied in the face of these scriptures
[56:58] that the true church and the false
[57:00] church are intertwined having been
[57:02] planted together but of different seeds
[57:05] he says now now then I think there is
[57:07] something else you ought to
[57:10] know when I hear that I just I I perk up
[57:13] I'm like man the seven churches which
[57:16] are addressed by John are in Asia Minor
[57:20] and are all Gentile churches he does not
[57:22] speak to the church at Jerusalem which
[57:24] was mostly Jewish with perhaps just a
[57:27] few Gentiles in it the reason that God
[57:30] had turned from the Jews to the
[57:33] Gentiles thus the whole church age is
[57:36] God dealing with the sorry thus the
[57:40] whole of the church ages is God dealing
[57:43] with the Gentiles and calling out a
[57:47] gentile bride to himself that makes the
[57:51] church ages and the fullness of the
[57:53] Gentiles the one and the same
[57:58] thing acts 13:44 to
[58:02] 48 and the next Sabbath day came almost
[58:05] the whole city together to hear the word
[58:07] of God but when the Jews saw the
[58:10] multitudes they were filled with envy
[58:14] and spake against those things which
[58:15] were spoken by Paul contradicting and
[58:20] blaspheming then Paul and Barnabas waxed
[58:22] bold and said it was necessary that the
[58:26] word of God should first have been
[58:28] spoken to you but seeing ye put it from
[58:32] you and judge yourselves Unworthy of
[58:36] everlasting life Lo we turn to the
[58:39] Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded
[58:42] us saying I have set thee to be a light
[58:45] of the Gentiles that thou shouldest be
[58:47] for salvation unto the ends of the Earth
[58:51] and when the Gentiles heard this they
[58:52] were glad and glorified the word of the
[58:55] Lord and as many as were ordained to
[58:58] eternal life
[59:01] believed it's just such an amazing story
[59:03] that is but you know even today there's
[59:06] people that judge themselves Unworthy of
[59:08] everlasting life they do they literally
[59:12] do and and you know the word doesn't
[59:14] actually stop there it just continues on
[59:17] am because no amount of unbelief will
[59:20] stop the word of God isn't that
[59:23] beautiful brothers and sisters doesn't
[59:25] matter what we have around us it doesn't
[59:27] matter what we encounter doesn't matter
[59:29] what we hear or or feel even nothing
[59:32] will stop the word of God from coming to
[59:34] pass am Hallelujah we have Romans 11
[59:39] 1-8 Paul speaking I say then hath God
[59:42] Cast Away his people God forbid for I
[59:46] also am an Israelite of the Seed of
[59:47] Abraham of the tri of Tribe of
[59:50] Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his
[59:53] people which he
[59:55] fornew what ye not what the scripture
[59:59] saith of Elias how he maketh
[1:00:02] intercession to God against Israel
[1:00:04] saying Lord they have killed thy
[1:00:06] prophets and dig down thine altars and I
[1:00:09] am left alone and they seek my
[1:00:13] life but what saith the answer of God
[1:00:15] unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000
[1:00:20] men who have not bowed the knee to the
[1:00:22] image of Baal than you even so then at
[1:00:25] this present time also there is a
[1:00:28] Remnant according to the election of
[1:00:30] Grace and if by Grace then it is no more
[1:00:33] of Works otherwise Grace is no more
[1:00:36] grace amen but if it be of works then it
[1:00:40] is no more grace otherwise work is no
[1:00:44] more
[1:00:45] work what then Israel hath not obtained
[1:00:49] that which he seeketh for but the
[1:00:51] election hath obtained it and the rest
[1:00:55] were
[1:00:57] blinded according as it is written God
[1:00:59] hath given them the Spirit of Slumber
[1:01:03] eyes that they should not see and ears
[1:01:06] that they should not hear unto this
[1:01:10] day and we know that if you start
[1:01:12] talking to a Jew someone who is a true
[1:01:15] Hebrew in Israel you start talking about
[1:01:18] Jesus they're going to say no way he is
[1:01:20] just a prophet there's no way you don't
[1:01:23] don't talk to us about that in fact
[1:01:25] brother bradam says it very clearly many
[1:01:26] times you can't cut God into three and
[1:01:29] give them to a Jew because they think
[1:01:30] that everyone else who is a Christian is
[1:01:32] a trinitarian not realizing that there's
[1:01:35] some truly
[1:01:36] elected which is really the
[1:01:39] difference you know Romans 11:25 to 29
[1:01:42] brother bramy says I would not Brethren
[1:01:44] that you should be ignorant of this
[1:01:46] mystery lest you should be wise in your
[1:01:49] own conceits that that blindness in part
[1:01:52] is happened to Israel until the fullness
[1:01:55] of the Gentiles become in and you know I
[1:01:59] just made a note here I just thought it
[1:02:00] was so good because just on the other
[1:02:02] page brother bradam he says the calling
[1:02:04] out of the Gentile bride to himself that
[1:02:07] makes the church ages and the fullness
[1:02:10] of the Gentiles the one and the same
[1:02:13] thing the fullness of the Gentiles is
[1:02:15] coming in right now we are a part of the
[1:02:17] fullness of the Gentiles that is the
[1:02:20] culmination of all of the church ages
[1:02:22] brothers and sisters and we are are here
[1:02:25] in the midst of that he goes on to say
[1:02:27] and so all Israel shall be saved as it
[1:02:30] is written there shall come out of Zion
[1:02:33] the deliverer and shall turn away
[1:02:35] ungodliness from Jacob for this is my
[1:02:37] Covenant unto them when I shall take
[1:02:39] away their sins as concerning the gospel
[1:02:42] they are enemies for your sake sakes but
[1:02:46] as for touching the election they are
[1:02:48] beloved for the father's sakes for the
[1:02:51] gifts and calling of God are without
[1:02:56] repentance paragraph 30 these seven
[1:02:58] churches located in Asia Minor contain
[1:03:01] certain characteristics within them that
[1:03:04] at that ancient date which became the
[1:03:07] mature fruit of later ages what were
[1:03:11] just seed plants back there came out
[1:03:14] later in a mature Harvest even as Jesus
[1:03:18] said for if they do these things in a
[1:03:20] green tree what shall be done in the dry
[1:03:26] I was thinking about the state of the
[1:03:28] world now and I was trying to explain
[1:03:30] this to Isaac the other day while we
[1:03:32] were driving and you know I was I was
[1:03:34] telling him that the language has
[1:03:37] changed in in humanity basically all
[1:03:41] over the world and you know people in
[1:03:43] government people who are professionals
[1:03:46] doesn't matter where you go office
[1:03:48] meetings everywhere you go the the
[1:03:51] swears and the curses are are like a
[1:03:53] normal part of the language now and and
[1:03:56] it's almost like it's it's if you accept
[1:03:59] that then you're welcome into the club
[1:04:01] but if you don't accept that then
[1:04:02] there's something wrong with you and and
[1:04:04] it's just the way the world has gone now
[1:04:07] and I was explaining to Isaac that you
[1:04:09] know when when my parents were children
[1:04:12] I I don't know when that would have been
[1:04:13] maybe in the in the 40s or the 30s even
[1:04:16] 40s 50s sorry if you're listening mom
[1:04:19] and dad I don't want to date you to be
[1:04:22] uh too Elder but you know back when they
[1:04:24] were
[1:04:25] children what I'm getting at is there
[1:04:28] was no
[1:04:29] swearing you weren't swearing in the
[1:04:31] open public maybe some people would but
[1:04:34] you know typically the people boy this
[1:04:36] is a bit of a tangent the people who
[1:04:38] would swear a and cuss they were the
[1:04:41] ones that were typically of lower
[1:04:44] education and probably more on the
[1:04:46] criminal side the ones who have
[1:04:48] potentially been to jail but nowadays
[1:04:50] the professionals the white callers the
[1:04:53] ones who who are holding meetings at
[1:04:55] high levels it's okay to
[1:04:57] swear if you talk to the police they're
[1:04:59] not afraid to swear it doesn't matter
[1:05:02] where you go this is the world that we
[1:05:04] live in but what's happened is there's
[1:05:05] an anointing on this Earth brothers and
[1:05:07] sisters and all of the spirits are now
[1:05:10] culminating just like all of the spirit
[1:05:13] of the Lord Jesus is culminating in his
[1:05:16] bride body it's not just the devil
[1:05:18] Powers taking over and I think this is
[1:05:20] the direction that I really want to
[1:05:21] impress as we go forwards is that though
[1:05:24] this world is getting dark the bride is
[1:05:26] getting brighter there's no way this
[1:05:28] world darkness is going to Snuff out the
[1:05:30] light which is Jesus Christ Living out
[1:05:33] through his bride body it's only going
[1:05:35] to get brighter and brighter as we have
[1:05:37] this
[1:05:38] contrast anyways um carrying on page 76
[1:05:43] the message to the Ephesian Church age
[1:05:46] unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus
[1:05:48] right these things saith he that holdeth
[1:05:50] the Seven Stars in his right hand who
[1:05:53] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[1:05:55] candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy
[1:05:58] labor and thy patience and how thou thou
[1:06:01] c not bear them which are evil and thou
[1:06:04] Hast tried them which say they are
[1:06:06] Apostles and are not and Hast found them
[1:06:10] liars and Hast borne and Hast patience
[1:06:14] and for my name's sake Hast labored and
[1:06:17] Hast not fainted nevertheless I have
[1:06:20] somewhat against thee because thou Hast
[1:06:23] left thy First Love remember therefore
[1:06:26] from whence Thou Art fallen and repent
[1:06:29] and do the first works or else I will
[1:06:32] come unto thee quickly and will remove
[1:06:34] thy Candlestick out of his place except
[1:06:38] thou
[1:06:39] repent but this thou Hast that thou
[1:06:42] hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I
[1:06:45] also hate he that hath an ear let him
[1:06:47] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:06:49] churches to him that overcometh will I
[1:06:51] give to eat of the Tree of Life which is
[1:06:54] in the midst of the paradise of God now
[1:06:58] remember the
[1:07:00] nicians
[1:07:02] niik niik is the leadership ni is the
[1:07:05] ministry leans is the Ley the people of
[1:07:09] the church a nickol leitan spirit is
[1:07:12] going to be dominating the people who
[1:07:15] are of the leoty and Jesus God speaking
[1:07:19] but this thou Hast that thou hatest the
[1:07:22] Deeds of that ni leot in spirit which I
[1:07:25] also hate isn't it wonderful to look at
[1:07:28] every single Church
[1:07:31] age he identifies with them the good
[1:07:34] things that they've done the good things
[1:07:36] that they're doing he relates to them
[1:07:37] that he understands exactly who they are
[1:07:39] and the position that they're in but he
[1:07:41] says you know what there's a little bit
[1:07:43] of a correction that has to come you
[1:07:44] have to get back to your first love to
[1:07:47] this first church age and you know every
[1:07:49] single one of us can live out I would
[1:07:51] say different portions of church ages in
[1:07:53] our lives and and we can get to the
[1:07:56] place where we forget our first love we
[1:07:58] get saved and God starts to bless us and
[1:08:00] we have a tremendous time maybe we have
[1:08:02] a family we get bogged down with the
[1:08:04] cares of life and what happens is we
[1:08:06] forget our first love we heard it on
[1:08:08] Sunday sometimes we get married and what
[1:08:11] what happens the the cares of Life come
[1:08:13] around the kids happen in our lives and
[1:08:14] we forget our first love and our
[1:08:16] marriage starts to get prickly and we we
[1:08:19] scratch our head and we wonder why all
[1:08:21] you got to do is get back to your first
[1:08:23] love remember how wonderful it was Once
[1:08:25] Upon a
[1:08:26] Time same thing
[1:08:28] spiritually it's a beautiful thing when
[1:08:30] we can look at the invisible Union of
[1:08:33] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[1:08:34] bride it's no different than us with our
[1:08:38] wives but if we have the ability to
[1:08:40] repent that means that we are ordained
[1:08:44] for eternal life brothers and sisters
[1:08:46] because only the ones that he loves does
[1:08:49] he rebuke and chasen all the rest could
[1:08:52] just do whatever they want to do they
[1:08:53] could just carry
[1:08:54] on the
[1:08:56] messenger the messenger Angel to the
[1:09:00] Church of Ephesus was the Apostle Paul
[1:09:02] you know this was one of the things that
[1:09:03] really changed it for me to understand
[1:09:05] the message of the hour um May maybe
[1:09:08] many times for people we can just take
[1:09:10] it for granted or just know that the
[1:09:12] messengers are angels but they're not
[1:09:14] always something that is understood
[1:09:17] sometimes it's good just to dwell on it
[1:09:18] a little bit to remind us that you know
[1:09:20] there's Messengers that are in the Bible
[1:09:23] this isn't just something that William
[1:09:24] Mari and Bram says in the printed book
[1:09:26] that he's come up with as he explains
[1:09:28] this when you look at the Bible and and
[1:09:30] you hear the description you talk about
[1:09:32] Paul there was a man that came to him
[1:09:34] Daniel talks about a man that came to
[1:09:37] him you know when the three Hebrew
[1:09:39] children were in the fire what did the
[1:09:41] king say the king said there's a fourth
[1:09:43] man in the fire one that looks like the
[1:09:45] son of
[1:09:46] man and we know that men are created man
[1:09:49] is created in the image of God Amen but
[1:09:53] anyways
[1:09:54] Paul Paul the messenger Angel to the
[1:09:58] Church of Ephesus was the Apostle Paul
[1:10:02] that he was the messenger to the first
[1:10:04] age of the Gentile era cannot be
[1:10:07] denied though to Peter it was granted
[1:10:10] the authority to open the doors to the
[1:10:13] Gentiles it was given to Paul to be
[1:10:16] their Apostle and
[1:10:18] prophet he was the prophet Messenger to
[1:10:22] the Gentiles
[1:10:24] his prophetic office by which he
[1:10:27] received the full revelation of the word
[1:10:29] for the Gentiles authenticated him as
[1:10:32] their Apostolic Messenger to this agreed
[1:10:36] the other Apostles at Jerusalem once
[1:10:39] again we're going to go through and just
[1:10:41] lay it out by scripture just proving
[1:10:43] this is not something that's just made
[1:10:44] up this is right out of the scriptures
[1:10:46] out of the King James Bible Galatians
[1:10:48] 1:12
[1:10:50] to19 for I neither received it of man
[1:10:53] neither was I taught it but by the
[1:10:55] revelation of Jesus Christ for ye have
[1:10:58] heard of my conversation in time past in
[1:11:02] the Jews religion how that beyond
[1:11:05] measure I persecuted the Church of God
[1:11:07] and wasted it and profited in the Jews
[1:11:11] religion above many my equals in my own
[1:11:14] Nation before more exceedingly zealous
[1:11:18] of the traditions of my fathers but when
[1:11:21] it pleased God who separated me from my
[1:11:23] mother's womb and called me by his grace
[1:11:27] to reveal his son in
[1:11:30] me amen that I might preach him among
[1:11:34] the
[1:11:34] Heathen immediately I conferred not with
[1:11:37] flesh and blood neither went I up into
[1:11:40] Jerusalem to them which were Apostles
[1:11:43] before me but I went into Arabia and
[1:11:46] returned again unto Damascus then after
[1:11:49] 3 years I went up to Jerusalem to see
[1:11:51] Peter and abod with him 15 days but
[1:11:55] other of the Apostles I saw none save
[1:11:57] James the Lord's brother and you know
[1:11:59] brothers and sisters if you look at this
[1:12:01] scripture if you study it out and and a
[1:12:04] great way to do that is in the Hebrews
[1:12:06] series The Hebrews book brother Bram he
[1:12:09] says it very clearly when Paul was
[1:12:13] actually being dealt with by the Lord
[1:12:14] when he was having his conversion when
[1:12:16] he was being transformed into a new
[1:12:18] creature that was no longer laying waste
[1:12:20] when he had his name changed from Saul
[1:12:23] of Tarsus to Paul the Apostle that was
[1:12:27] no surprise to God but it sure was to
[1:12:29] him but when that happened when the
[1:12:32] consciousness of that happened to him he
[1:12:34] didn't go back and confer with all of
[1:12:37] the old people that he used to hang out
[1:12:39] with he didn't go back and talk to the
[1:12:41] old kind old priest he didn't go and
[1:12:44] talk to anyone what he did was he went
[1:12:46] out into Arabia he got away from
[1:12:48] everyone he pushed back all of the
[1:12:50] things that he knew about and got into a
[1:12:53] position where he could compare the
[1:12:55] Revelation that he was getting with the
[1:12:57] word of God because remember we're going
[1:12:59] to go back to it every single time we
[1:13:01] get on this topic we're going to get a
[1:13:02] revelation it's going to come to us
[1:13:04] thoughts will come but it's got to be
[1:13:07] revealed not only by the spirit
[1:13:08] confirmed in the word and then it's
[1:13:10] going to make a manifestation in our
[1:13:12] lives and when it manifests in our lives
[1:13:14] brothers and sisters just having fruit
[1:13:16] on the vine isn't enough that fruit has
[1:13:19] to manifest according to the original
[1:13:21] vine it's got to manifest according
[1:13:23] ording to the word of God which will
[1:13:25] reflect that Revelation that we got at
[1:13:27] the very first it's just a big
[1:13:29] circle but here we have Paul talking
[1:13:32] about how when this was revealed to him
[1:13:34] he went out in Arabia he didn't go and
[1:13:35] check with anyone and ask people's
[1:13:37] opinions he went and saw for himself as
[1:13:40] a scholar of the word does it compare
[1:13:42] with scripture and when that happened he
[1:13:44] was able to say amen and went forward
[1:13:46] with great boldness to be the Apostle
[1:13:49] for the
[1:13:51] age oh what do we have here Galatians 22
[1:13:54] he says and I went up by Revelation and
[1:13:56] communicated unto them that gospel which
[1:13:59] I preached among the Gentiles but
[1:14:02] privately to them which were of
[1:14:04] reputation lest by any means I should
[1:14:07] run or had run in vain but of those who
[1:14:11] seem to be sorry this is another
[1:14:13] scripture here this is Galatians
[1:14:16] 26-9 but of those who seem to be
[1:14:18] somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh
[1:14:21] no matter to me I love how he says this
[1:14:23] doesn't matter who it is whether they're
[1:14:25] important or not whether they're famous
[1:14:27] or not God accepteth no man's person for
[1:14:31] they who seemed to be somewhat in
[1:14:34] conference added nothing to me but in
[1:14:37] contrary wise when they saw that the
[1:14:40] gospel of the uncircumcision was
[1:14:42] committed unto me as the gospel of the
[1:14:44] circumcision was unto Peter for he that
[1:14:48] wrought effectually in Peter to the
[1:14:50] apostleship of the circumcision the same
[1:14:53] when was mighty in me toward the
[1:14:55] Gentiles and when James sephus and John
[1:14:58] who seemed to be pillars perceived the
[1:15:01] grace that was given unto me they gave
[1:15:04] to me and Barnabas the right hands of
[1:15:06] Fellowship that we should go unto the
[1:15:08] Heathen and they unto the circumcision
[1:15:12] and we know the the word heathen in the
[1:15:14] word of God it just doesn't mean
[1:15:16] unbeliever per se even though it is in
[1:15:19] some context but what it means is
[1:15:21] non-jew the Gentile
[1:15:24] we're heathens by Nature outside of
[1:15:26] being
[1:15:28] Christians Romans 11:13 for I speak to
[1:15:31] you Gentiles in as much as I am the
[1:15:34] Apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my
[1:15:38] office mine office he understood where
[1:15:41] he stood so he was able to magnify his
[1:15:44] office and like I said in the Hebrew
[1:15:46] series brother brandham talks about that
[1:15:47] it's so good even if you don't read it
[1:15:49] if you just listen to it it's really
[1:15:50] good it speaks very specifically on that
[1:15:53] and I thought about getting into that
[1:15:55] but you know what maybe sometime down
[1:15:56] the road we'll study the Hebrews series
[1:15:59] uh there's so many nuggets in there but
[1:16:02] for now we'll just carry on paragraph 32
[1:16:04] Paul founded the church at Ephesus about
[1:16:06] the middle of the first century this
[1:16:08] enables us to set the date of the
[1:16:09] beginning of the Ephesian Church age at
[1:16:11] about 53 ad his manner of ministering
[1:16:15] set the pattern that all future
[1:16:18] Messengers were to Aspire to I just love
[1:16:22] this
[1:16:23] I think it's so important for us to
[1:16:25] remember this his manner Paul's manner
[1:16:28] of ministering set the pattern that all
[1:16:31] future Messengers were to Aspire to and
[1:16:35] actually sets the pattern for every true
[1:16:38] minister of
[1:16:41] God though he would not attain to such
[1:16:44] Heights in the prophetic realm as did
[1:16:48] Paul Paul's Ministry had a three-fold
[1:16:52] quality and was as
[1:16:54] follows we'll get into that I just think
[1:16:56] it's so good to to recognize this I just
[1:16:59] want to read a little quote here I think
[1:17:02] we still have time it's out of having
[1:17:04] conferences and it's uh
[1:17:07] 0608 brother bradam he he says I can't
[1:17:10] explain it if you were to search that I
[1:17:13] can't explain it there's no words that I
[1:17:15] can think
[1:17:19] of I can't explain it there's no words
[1:17:22] that I can think of if I'd say superb or
[1:17:26] or or supreme or or perfect that
[1:17:30] wouldn't touch
[1:17:31] it there was no
[1:17:33] tomorrow there was no
[1:17:36] yesterday they they were in
[1:17:39] eternity now many people know exactly
[1:17:42] where I'm at right now this is where he
[1:17:43] was beyond the curtain of time but what
[1:17:45] I'm saying is this is just something I
[1:17:47] felt led to read because it's talking
[1:17:49] about the messenger that we follow today
[1:17:52] how he followed the first church age
[1:17:54] messenger he wasn't interested in some
[1:17:57] sort of alternative or substitute he
[1:17:59] said there was no tomorrow there was no
[1:18:02] yesterday they were in eternity and they
[1:18:05] never got tired they never had to eat
[1:18:08] yet they had
[1:18:09] senses I could feel them they could
[1:18:13] speak they was looking at me they had
[1:18:17] senses and I said I don't understand
[1:18:20] this and that voice said this is perfect
[1:18:22] love said isn't that what you spoke the
[1:18:25] Holy Spirit was I said yes and this is
[1:18:29] perfect
[1:18:30] love and about that time a big bunch of
[1:18:33] men lifted me up and took me to a place
[1:18:36] and set me up kindly high like a stand
[1:18:40] or something and here was people I could
[1:18:43] see them by the tens of thousands coming
[1:18:47] from
[1:18:48] everywhere everyone young beautiful
[1:18:51] running hugging me I saidwell I don't
[1:18:53] get this and just then a beautiful woman
[1:18:57] run up and she said oh my darling
[1:19:00] brother she said we're so happy to see
[1:19:02] you welcome and she walked away and I
[1:19:05] said praise the Lord sister I looked
[1:19:07] around me and then I thought what is
[1:19:10] this what's going on what's happened
[1:19:13] just then a voice said in the Bible
[1:19:15] where it said that Jacob was gathered
[1:19:17] with his people and the other one this
[1:19:21] is like unto that where you'll gather
[1:19:24] with your where you will gather with
[1:19:27] your
[1:19:28] people I said all them
[1:19:32] Brams I said that I never believed that
[1:19:35] there was that
[1:19:36] many he said they're not Brams said
[1:19:40] they're your
[1:19:41] converts they're your
[1:19:43] converts said that woman that you're
[1:19:46] admiring said you know how old she was
[1:19:48] when you led her to Christ I said I have
[1:19:50] no idea said past
[1:19:53] 90 said she's young
[1:19:58] forever and she looked up at me she said
[1:20:00] brother brandom Jesus will come someday
[1:20:03] and then we'll go back to Earth and said
[1:20:06] then we'll receive our glorified body
[1:20:08] then we'll live together
[1:20:10] forever I said well well what what do
[1:20:14] you set me up here for and they said you
[1:20:17] was a leader you led us I said oh let me
[1:20:20] see Jesus if I've passed over I want to
[1:20:22] see him
[1:20:23] and that voice said you can't see him
[1:20:25] now said he will come but first he will
[1:20:29] come to you and said judge you by the
[1:20:32] gospel you
[1:20:34] preached and I said the gospel I preach
[1:20:38] yes and I said will St Paul have to
[1:20:41] stand before his converts said
[1:20:45] absolutely he will too I said I never
[1:20:48] varied one word I stayed just exactly
[1:20:51] the way the Bible said it it I don't
[1:20:53] care what anyone said or did not say I
[1:20:57] stayed right with it like that so if
[1:21:00] Paul's group is saved mine is
[1:21:04] too and a great scream from look like
[1:21:07] thousands and thousands said we know
[1:21:10] that I said praise God I never was so
[1:21:13] happy that I stayed true to the word see
[1:21:16] I never was so happy you know brothers
[1:21:19] and sisters we're not talking about a
[1:21:20] time in the future we're talking about
[1:21:23] eternity so every single one that has
[1:21:26] the ability in this room here tonight to
[1:21:28] say Amen to those words you were
[1:21:32] there your voice is what he heard saying
[1:21:36] amen I just think it's so
[1:21:38] beautiful my
[1:21:41] goodness where do we leave off here oh
[1:21:44] here we go
[1:21:48] um first of all paragraph 34 Paul was
[1:21:52] absolutely true to the word okay sorry
[1:21:54] I'm just going to back up a go uh back
[1:21:56] up a bit Paul's Ministry had a
[1:21:59] three-fold quality and was as follows
[1:22:02] the first of all Paul was absolutely
[1:22:04] true to the word he never deviated it
[1:22:08] deviated from it no matter what the
[1:22:11] cost Galatians 1:8-9 but though we are
[1:22:15] an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:22:16] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:22:19] preached unto you let him be ACC cursed
[1:22:22] and as we said before so say I now again
[1:22:25] if any man preach any other gospel unto
[1:22:28] you than that ye have received let him
[1:22:31] be
[1:22:32] accursed and we have Galatians
[1:22:35] 2:1-4 but when Peter was come to Antioch
[1:22:39] I withstood him to the face because he
[1:22:41] was to be blamed but when I saw that
[1:22:44] they walked not uprightly according to
[1:22:46] the truth of the Gospel I said unto
[1:22:48] Peter before them all if thou being a
[1:22:51] Jew livest after the the manner of the
[1:22:53] Gentiles and not as do the Jews why
[1:22:56] compel us the Gentiles to live as do the
[1:22:59] Jews we know that he was living a double
[1:23:01] life and he just simply called him out
[1:23:03] on it according to the word 1
[1:23:05] Corinthians 14: 36-37 what came the word
[1:23:08] of God out from you or came it unto you
[1:23:11] only if any man think of himself to be a
[1:23:14] prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge
[1:23:18] that the things that I write unto you
[1:23:21] are the Commandments of the Lord
[1:23:24] I just believe it says it right there we
[1:23:25] can't go any further than that scripture
[1:23:27] verse right there we have to be willing
[1:23:30] to acknowledge Paul's Ministry if we
[1:23:33] don't do that then we've got something
[1:23:35] wrong we're going off on a tangent you
[1:23:38] know all we have to do is
[1:23:40] repent we just have to remember our
[1:23:42] first love we just have to go back to
[1:23:44] where we got off is what brother
[1:23:45] brandham said paragraph 35 notice that
[1:23:48] Paul was unorganized but spirit-led as
[1:23:50] when God moved upon Moses to lead Israel
[1:23:53] out of Egypt Jerusalem's Council never
[1:23:57] sent Paul out nor did it have any power
[1:23:59] or jurisdiction over him God and God
[1:24:03] Alone did the sending and the leading
[1:24:06] Paul was not of men but of God isn't
[1:24:09] that beautiful when you think about that
[1:24:11] God took the one who is doing the
[1:24:14] greatest work for those evil leaders
[1:24:17] those S Pharisees and Sadducees hey in
[1:24:21] Jerusalem took the greatest man from
[1:24:24] them and converted
[1:24:26] him took him and used him for his good
[1:24:29] it's just a beautiful thing Galatians
[1:24:31] 1:1 Paul an apostle not of men neither
[1:24:34] by man but by Jesus Christ and God the
[1:24:37] Father who raised him from the dead
[1:24:40] Galatians 2: 3-5 but neither Titus who
[1:24:43] was with me being a Greek was compelled
[1:24:46] to be circumcised and that because of
[1:24:49] false Brethren unawares brought in who
[1:24:51] came in privileged to spy out our
[1:24:53] Liberty which we have in Jesus Christ
[1:24:56] that they might bring us into bondage to
[1:24:59] whom we gave place by subjection no not
[1:25:02] for an hour that the truth of the Gospel
[1:25:05] might continue with
[1:25:07] you he goes goes on to say in paragraph
[1:25:10] 36 secondly his ministry was in the
[1:25:12] power of the spirit thereby
[1:25:15] demonstrating the spoken and written
[1:25:19] word
[1:25:20] remember r faled by the spirit confirmed
[1:25:24] by the word made manifest by the fruits
[1:25:27] that it bears and this one is 1
[1:25:29] Corinthians 2 veres 1 to5 and I Brethren
[1:25:33] when I came to you came not with
[1:25:35] Excellency of speech or of wisdom
[1:25:38] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[1:25:41] for I determine not to know anything
[1:25:43] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[1:25:46] crucified and I was with you in weakness
[1:25:48] and in fear and in much trembling and my
[1:25:51] speech and my preaching was not with
[1:25:52] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:25:55] the demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:25:57] power and that your faith should not
[1:26:00] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:26:04] power of God if there is one thing that
[1:26:07] I would like to say over and over and
[1:26:10] over to the church this is all so that
[1:26:13] your faith should not stand in the
[1:26:15] wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:26:19] God acts 148 to10
[1:26:22] and there sat a certain man at L lra lra
[1:26:27] lisra impotent in his feet and being a
[1:26:30] from his mother's womb who never
[1:26:32] had walked the same heard Paul speak who
[1:26:35] steadfastly beholding him and perceiving
[1:26:39] that he had Faith to be healed said with
[1:26:42] a loud voice stand up on thy feet and he
[1:26:45] leaped and
[1:26:47] walked acts 20: 9 to2 and remember this
[1:26:51] isn't the Acts of the Apostles even
[1:26:53] though many times Bibles say that we had
[1:26:55] the correction in our day in the church
[1:26:57] age in which we live this is the acts of
[1:26:59] the holy spirit in the
[1:27:03] apostles
[1:27:06] uh Acts 20 veres 9 to2 and this is the
[1:27:10] story about falling asleep in church
[1:27:12] brothers and sisters and there sat in a
[1:27:14] window a certain young man named uus
[1:27:17] being fallen into a deep sleep and as
[1:27:20] Paul was long preaching he sunk down
[1:27:23] with sleep and fell down from the third
[1:27:24] Loft and was taken up dead and Paul went
[1:27:27] down and fell on him and embracing him
[1:27:30] said trouble not yourselves for his life
[1:27:33] is in him when he therefore was come up
[1:27:36] again he had broken bread and eaten and
[1:27:39] talked a long while even till break of
[1:27:42] day so he departed and they brought the
[1:27:45] young man alive and were not a little
[1:27:47] comforted the acts of the Holy Ghost the
[1:27:50] holy spirit in the apostle OST Les acts
[1:27:53] 28: 7-9 in the same quarters were
[1:27:57] possessions of the chief man of the
[1:28:00] island whose name was pablus who
[1:28:02] received us and lodged us three days
[1:28:04] courteously and it came to pass that the
[1:28:06] father of pablus lay sick of a fever and
[1:28:09] of a bloody flux to whom Paul entered in
[1:28:13] and prayed and laid his hands on him and
[1:28:15] healed him so when this was done others
[1:28:19] also which had diseases in the island
[1:28:21] came and were healed 2 Corinthians 2:12
[1:28:26] truly the signs of an apostle were
[1:28:28] wrought among you in all patience in
[1:28:32] signs and wonders and mighty Deeds 2
[1:28:36] Corinthians
[1:28:37] 2:12 oh sorry thirdly he had an evident
[1:28:41] he had the evident fruit of his
[1:28:44] god-given ministry it actually
[1:28:46] manifested it bore fruit 2 Corinthians
[1:28:49] 12:1 I am become a fo fool in glorying
[1:28:53] ye have compelled me for I ought to have
[1:28:55] been commanded of you for in nothing am
[1:28:58] I behind the very chiefest Apostles
[1:29:01] though I be nothing 1 Corinthians
[1:29:04] 9:2 if I be not an apostle unto others
[1:29:08] yet doubtless I am to you for the Seal
[1:29:10] of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord 2
[1:29:15] Corinthians
[1:29:16] 11:2 for I am jealous over you with a
[1:29:19] Godly jealousy for I have espoused you
[1:29:22] to one husband that I may present you as
[1:29:26] a chaste virgin to
[1:29:29] Christ I think that's just beautiful I
[1:29:32] would want to follow someone that had a
[1:29:33] Ministry like that someone that had a
[1:29:36] desire in his heart like that that was
[1:29:38] jealous over his people with a Godly
[1:29:41] jealousy my goodness paragraph 38 on
[1:29:45] page 81 Paul had been the means of
[1:29:48] bringing in multitudes of the Gentile
[1:29:51] sheep he fed them and cared for them
[1:29:54] until they brought forth righteous fruit
[1:29:57] and were prepared to meet the Lord as
[1:30:00] part of the Gentile
[1:30:02] bride at the time of the giving of the
[1:30:04] Revelation according to tradition Paul
[1:30:07] had already died a
[1:30:09] martyr but John was carrying on in his
[1:30:12] stead exactly as Paul had done in the
[1:30:16] days of his
[1:30:18] ministry so he's talking specifically
[1:30:21] here about how John was being revelated
[1:30:24] John was on the aisle of patmas after
[1:30:27] Paul had already been martyred he had
[1:30:29] already died he'd been killed but it
[1:30:32] doesn't change the fact that it was true
[1:30:34] Revelation is what he's saying here he
[1:30:36] says the death of Paul before Revelation
[1:30:39] was given does not at all anull the fact
[1:30:43] that he was the messenger to the
[1:30:44] Ephesian Church age for the messenger to
[1:30:48] every age regardless of when he
[1:30:52] appears or
[1:30:54] goes is the one who influences that age
[1:30:58] for God by the means of a word
[1:31:02] manifested
[1:31:04] ministry you know why I'm pausing with
[1:31:07] that we're reading between the lines
[1:31:09] here I hope understanding that it
[1:31:12] doesn't matter that God decided to take
[1:31:15] the prophet off the scene before he took
[1:31:17] the bride off the scene it doesn't mean
[1:31:20] that something is wrong WR with that
[1:31:22] word with the word that he brought
[1:31:25] because all it was was a word manifested
[1:31:28] ministry I'm just going to read that
[1:31:30] again the messenger to every age
[1:31:31] regardless of when he go when he appears
[1:31:34] or goes is the one who influences that
[1:31:37] age for God by means of a word
[1:31:40] manifested ministry and in this
[1:31:42] particular case the Ephesian Church age
[1:31:45] Paul was that
[1:31:46] man the city of
[1:31:49] Ephesus page 82 the city of Ephesus was
[1:31:53] one of the three greatest cities of Asia
[1:31:56] it was often called the third city of
[1:31:58] Christian faith with Jerusalem first and
[1:32:02] Antioch second it was a very rich city
[1:32:06] the government was Roman but the
[1:32:08] language was Greek historians believed
[1:32:11] that John Mary Peter Andrew and Phillip
[1:32:15] were all buried in this beautiful city
[1:32:19] Paul who founded the true faith in this
[1:32:21] City pastured here only about 3
[1:32:25] years but when he was absent from the
[1:32:28] flock he was continually prayerfully
[1:32:31] mindful of them Timothy was its First
[1:32:35] bishop and I would say or Pastor 1
[1:32:39] Timothy 1: 1-3 Paul an apostle of Jesus
[1:32:42] Christ by the Commandment of God Our
[1:32:44] Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is
[1:32:47] Our Hope unto Timothy my own son in the
[1:32:50] faith Grace Merc Mercy peace and peace
[1:32:53] sorry from God our Father and Jesus
[1:32:56] Christ Our Lord as I besought Thee to
[1:32:59] abide still at Ephesus when I went into
[1:33:02] Macedonia that thou mightest charge some
[1:33:05] that they teach no other
[1:33:09] Doctrine paragraph 41 the very name
[1:33:13] Ephesus has a strange compound meaning
[1:33:16] aimed at and
[1:33:19] relaxed the high aspirations of this age
[1:33:22] that had begun with the fullness of the
[1:33:24] spirit the depth of God whereby they
[1:33:27] were aiming at the High Calling of God
[1:33:30] began to give way to a less watchful
[1:33:33] attitude a less Ardent following of
[1:33:37] Jesus Christ began to manifest itself as
[1:33:40] an omen that in the future ages the
[1:33:44] physical vehicle called The Church would
[1:33:47] sink to the awfulness of the depth of
[1:33:50] Satan
[1:33:52] it had become relaxed and was
[1:33:55] drifting already the age was
[1:33:59] backsliding it had left its first love
[1:34:03] the tiny seed planted in the Ephesian
[1:34:05] age would one day grow in the spirit of
[1:34:09] error until all foul birds of the air
[1:34:12] would Roost in its
[1:34:14] branches so inoffensive to human
[1:34:17] reasoning would that little plant appear
[1:34:21] to that new EVE the
[1:34:24] church that again she would be seed by
[1:34:28] Satan so brothers and sisters remember
[1:34:32] the devil even though he's going about
[1:34:33] as a roaring lion he's not going to be
[1:34:35] at our door roaring like a
[1:34:37] lion brother Bram talks about it in
[1:34:39] Africa and there's people here that
[1:34:40] could probably witness it when a lion
[1:34:42] roars brother bradam says that
[1:34:44] everything shuts up because of the sound
[1:34:47] of that creature it's so powerful the
[1:34:50] devil's not going to come around and
[1:34:52] Roar maybe sometimes but more times than
[1:34:56] not he's going to be very inoffensive
[1:34:59] he's going to be an angel of Light he's
[1:35:00] going to be a perfect gentleman he'll
[1:35:01] come on the scene and make it look like
[1:35:02] it's just perfect it's just great
[1:35:04] whatever we're doing is just fine it's
[1:35:06] not a problem right and all she wants to
[1:35:09] do is just get his fingernail in the
[1:35:11] door that's all and then tomorrow it'll
[1:35:14] be his finger and the next day it'll be
[1:35:16] his hand and the next day his arm and
[1:35:19] before you know it he'll be all the way
[1:35:21] in
[1:35:22] but here we have the prophet saying so
[1:35:24] inoffensive to human reasoning that's
[1:35:26] why you got to have the Holy Ghost so
[1:35:28] inoffensive to human reasoning would
[1:35:31] that little plant appear to the new EVE
[1:35:34] the new church that again she would be
[1:35:37] deceived by Satan the Ephesian age had
[1:35:41] presented to her the opportunity for
[1:35:43] God's best and for a while she prevailed
[1:35:46] then what happened brothers and sisters
[1:35:49] she
[1:35:50] relaxed let's not
[1:35:52] relax let's not become relaxed because
[1:35:55] we're rich and increased with goods and
[1:35:57] have need of nothing we don't have need
[1:35:59] of nothing we have need of the Lord
[1:36:01] Jesus Christ in our lives we have need
[1:36:03] of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:36:06] homes and then relaxed and in that
[1:36:09] unguarded moment Satan planted the seed
[1:36:13] of complete
[1:36:15] ruination the very religion of Ephesus
[1:36:17] types out perfectly this first church
[1:36:20] age and sets the tenor of the ages to
[1:36:23] come in the first place the Magnificent
[1:36:26] Temple of Diana that was so many years
[1:36:29] in building housed in its sacred courts
[1:36:31] the most lusterless and unobtrusive
[1:36:34] image of Diana that one could
[1:36:37] imagine now I'm just going to pause
[1:36:39] there because I know full well and you
[1:36:41] do too later on in the exposition of the
[1:36:44] seven Church ages brother branam talks
[1:36:46] about snake worship and how there is a
[1:36:48] church age where they actually housed a
[1:36:50] live snake in the temple and to me that
[1:36:54] sounds very offensive and many times
[1:36:56] people would say that's awful sure but
[1:36:59] here we have Satan just creeping in oh
[1:37:01] it's just an unoffensive inoffensive
[1:37:03] little Idol you can't even see a figure
[1:37:06] you can hardly even tell that it's a
[1:37:08] woman but it's there and it's not
[1:37:11] God the most lusterless and unobtrusive
[1:37:14] image of Diana that one could imagine
[1:37:17] she was absolutely like any other of her
[1:37:19] images seated in the other temples
[1:37:22] dedicated to her she was simply an
[1:37:25] almost shapeless female figure that
[1:37:28] finally sunk into the block of wood from
[1:37:30] which she was carved and her two arms
[1:37:33] were formed out of two simple bars of
[1:37:36] iron how perfectly this depicts the
[1:37:39] spirit of antichrist loosed in the first
[1:37:43] age there he was loosed in the midst of
[1:37:45] the people and yet took no shape as to
[1:37:49] alarm the people yet the two arms of
[1:37:52] iron bars showed that it was his intent
[1:37:56] to crush the work of God as he made his
[1:38:00] inroads and no one seemed to notice him
[1:38:04] or what he was
[1:38:07] doing but one day they would
[1:38:09] notice when those arms of iron his deeds
[1:38:14] became Doctrine and his Doctrine became
[1:38:18] the law of an
[1:38:20] Empire
[1:38:23] I'll just finish this page if it's
[1:38:25] okay paragraph 44 the order of the
[1:38:28] temple service is also very revealing
[1:38:32] there were first of all priests who were
[1:38:35] unic this sterile
[1:38:38] priesthood presaged the sterility of the
[1:38:42] people who would Drift from the word for
[1:38:46] a people who claim to know God apart
[1:38:49] from the word are as Barren as the life
[1:38:54] is
[1:38:55] as sorry I'm going to read this again
[1:38:57] for a people who claim to know God apart
[1:39:00] from the word are as Barren of life as
[1:39:03] is a sterile
[1:39:06] unic secondly the temple had within its
[1:39:09] confines the Virgin priestesses who
[1:39:12] performed the religious acts of the
[1:39:15] temple this showed forth the day that
[1:39:19] ceremony and for form ritual and works
[1:39:24] would take the place of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:27] and no longer with charismatic
[1:39:30] manifestation fill the temple of God
[1:39:34] brothers and sisters don't ever we don't
[1:39:37] ever want ceremony form ritual and works
[1:39:41] to take the place of the holy spirit in
[1:39:43] our church we want to see the
[1:39:46] charismatic manifestation of God in our
[1:39:50] church he goes on to say over them all
[1:39:53] was the high priest a man of political
[1:39:56] power and public influence portraying
[1:40:00] what was already in progress though not
[1:40:02] too manifested that is the church would
[1:40:05] soon begin be given over to the
[1:40:08] leadership of man with man's plans man's
[1:40:12] Ambitions and thus saith the Holy Ghost
[1:40:15] would no longer be a living
[1:40:17] reality and underneath them I'll call
[1:40:20] the musicians as we finish here and
[1:40:22] underneath them were all the temple
[1:40:25] slaves who had no choice but obedience
[1:40:28] to the religious
[1:40:30] hierarchy what can this mean but that
[1:40:33] the day would come when the vested
[1:40:35] clergy by political
[1:40:38] maneuvering State help and the
[1:40:41] substitution of word and spirit for
[1:40:44] Creeds dogmas and human leadership would
[1:40:48] enslave the leoty while the the leaders
[1:40:52] luxuriated in ill-gotten wealth and
[1:40:55] enjoyed their filthy pleasures and the
[1:40:57] poor people who were to be served
[1:41:00] according to God now became the
[1:41:05] servants brothers and sisters maybe
[1:41:08] stand with me as we close how important
[1:41:09] is it for us to stay with that word
[1:41:12] tonight we need to stay with that word
[1:41:14] that was once delivered unto the Saints
[1:41:17] and you know we have no excuse we've had
[1:41:19] a complete tying up of all of the loose
[1:41:21] ends in our day it's just such a
[1:41:24] wonderful thing to be able to look at
[1:41:26] the beginning of that Antichrist Spirit
[1:41:28] how it crept into the framework of the
[1:41:31] Christian church and how did it happen I
[1:41:34] think it's so important to just remember
[1:41:36] to think about this to meditate on this
[1:41:39] how did it happen they
[1:41:41] relaxed they were comfortable they had
[1:41:44] Christ he was in the boat with them the
[1:41:47] storm calmed but then they relaxed let
[1:41:50] us not ever get relaxed Brothers and
[1:41:52] Sisters Let's just bow in prayer
[1:41:55] gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight we
[1:41:57] just thank you once again for this word
[1:42:00] that you have given to us Lord we know
[1:42:03] that there's no author that we're
[1:42:05] interested in listen to other than you
[1:42:08] father but we know that this word this
[1:42:10] book that we're reading tonight that we
[1:42:13] have been studying and reading it it's a
[1:42:15] book that was prepared Lord by your
[1:42:18] servant and father we appreciate it
[1:42:20] because we know that the only thing that
[1:42:22] he did in this book was reveal how that
[1:42:25] Antichrist Spirit crept into the
[1:42:27] framework of the Christian Church
[1:42:29] causing it to be lukewarm formal and
[1:42:31] Powerless and Lord Jesus we don't want
[1:42:34] to replace your spirit Lord the the
[1:42:37] charismatic manifestation of your spirit
[1:42:40] Lord in our church or in our lives or in
[1:42:43] our families Lord for Creeds and dogmas
[1:42:47] and works Lord Jesus if we've been
[1:42:50] guilty of those things forgive us for it

[1:42:55] repent quickly to be a man after your
[1:42:59] own Heart Lord just like David was oh

[1:43:40] book by Revelation father Lord we just
[1:43:44] pray that it would manifest in our lives
[1:43:45] that it would bear fruit according to
[1:43:47] the message of this age father because
