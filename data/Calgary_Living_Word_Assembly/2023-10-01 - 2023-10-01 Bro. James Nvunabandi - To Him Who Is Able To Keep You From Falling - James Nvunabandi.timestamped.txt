[1:00:39] which is a problem to
[1:00:41] me but this time Let It Be Mine which
[1:00:45] will be a problem to you so uh I
[1:00:50] won't uh preach I will just go
[1:00:53] through
[1:00:55] uh just go through and we go
[1:00:59] along as we share the word of
[1:01:03] God I believe what we are going to
[1:01:06] share at least it will help somebody I
[1:01:09] don't
[1:01:11] know if if it does not help anyone among
[1:01:16] you at least it will help
[1:01:19] me yeah I want to keep uh to to pick
[1:01:25] uh from the book of
[1:01:34] Jude you know Jud is one
[1:01:44] chapter uh then it will be uh verse
[1:01:53] 24
[1:01:56] these are notes that have been keeping
[1:01:58] for many years but when I was coming and
[1:02:01] it was like Lord what will I share with
[1:02:03] your
[1:02:04] people I packed also these
[1:02:08] notes they are familiar
[1:02:11] schooles if you have ever heard them
[1:02:15] remember this don't ever get used to the
[1:02:18] word of
[1:02:19] God each day is fresh in itself
[1:02:27] so Jude chapter it is one chapter verse
[1:02:37] 24 uh when you go to read the the whole
[1:02:40] chapter is talking about those who back
[1:02:44] those who
[1:02:45] fail those who enter to
[1:02:48] disrupt to create chaos and everything
[1:02:52] he's speaking about
[1:02:55] defending the faith that was once
[1:02:57] delivered to the Saints you know when
[1:03:00] you hear about to come on defend you
[1:03:02] know there is there is there is a
[1:03:05] war and we are Christians we were
[1:03:09] recruited to
[1:03:11] fight you know God is not calling is not
[1:03:14] recruiting babies he's recruiting
[1:03:17] soldiers uh we are not expected always
[1:03:20] to to to cry to to to always I I was
[1:03:26] telling somebody that you know when you
[1:03:29] meet a
[1:03:32] situation uh you are meant to overcome
[1:03:35] that
[1:03:36] situation that's is not a time to wh oh
[1:03:39] God oh God come and help me God come and
[1:03:42] help me you know when you cry a lot then
[1:03:45] God says okay on my
[1:03:48] back then you thank God oh God has
[1:03:51] rescued me no you you have simply
[1:03:56] failed God has seen that you have simply
[1:03:59] failed he carries you on the back but
[1:04:02] remember that situation is still there
[1:04:05] that's right you meet it again because
[1:04:08] you are trained to
[1:04:12] overcome that's why it says there is a
[1:04:14] message why cry
[1:04:18] speak you have to Transit from a crying
[1:04:22] period to a speaking
[1:04:26] period so now Jude
[1:04:29] continues uh we can probably start on
[1:04:32] verse 20 but you dear friends by
[1:04:35] building yourselves up in your Most Holy
[1:04:39] Faith and praying in the Holy
[1:04:42] Spirit keep yourselves in God's love as
[1:04:46] you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[1:04:49] Christ to bring you to eternal
[1:04:52] life be merciful to those H
[1:04:55] out save others by snatching them from
[1:04:58] the
[1:04:59] fire to others show Mercy mixed with
[1:05:07] fear hating even the clothings stand by
[1:05:11] the corrupted
[1:05:13] flesh to him who is a able to keep you
[1:05:17] from
[1:05:19] falling and to present you before his
[1:05:22] glorious presence
[1:05:25] without fault and with great
[1:05:27] joy to the only God our savior be glory
[1:05:33] Majesty power and authority through
[1:05:36] Jesus Christ Our Lord before all ages
[1:05:39] now and forever more amen you can sit
[1:05:48] down yeah I want to take a
[1:05:51] heading just a thought
[1:05:55] uh uh to to to give ourselves the
[1:05:59] direction it is from these few
[1:06:03] words to him who is able to keep you
[1:06:08] from
[1:06:12] falling before God you can back slide a
[1:06:16] million
[1:06:18] times but there is one thing sure you
[1:06:22] will never fall
[1:06:24] because there is him who will keep you
[1:06:28] from
[1:06:29] falling and at the end of the day he
[1:06:32] will present you before his glorious
[1:06:36] presence without fault and with grow
[1:06:41] Joy that's the God we
[1:06:45] serve as I said it also strengthens me
[1:06:51] it reminds me of many things since I
[1:06:56] believed the message now it is 40 years
[1:07:00] 43 years to be
[1:07:02] exact behind the ppit in the message of
[1:07:07] the 60 years I have been on this Earth a
[1:07:11] big part of it have been in the message
[1:07:16] and especially behind the
[1:07:20] parit so as has
[1:07:22] progress
[1:07:25] you are on a
[1:07:27] highway you are figure yourself on a
[1:07:31] highway you see on the highway there are
[1:07:37] vehicles that are meant to be cruising
[1:07:40] CRC Crossing one
[1:07:43] another but as you
[1:07:46] move you come across a
[1:07:50] wreck and
[1:07:52] another
[1:07:55] it took a situation for that thing to
[1:07:59] happen for a wck to
[1:08:02] happen but as you Cruise
[1:08:05] along and you come across one know that
[1:08:09] that r or so would enjoy to be on the
[1:08:13] highway
[1:08:14] moving but something
[1:08:21] happened now as you move along
[1:08:24] you will
[1:08:25] know that there are WS
[1:08:29] also you know facts are facts they are
[1:08:33] stubborn they are
[1:08:36] real but as you
[1:08:40] move in this Journey of Faith you will
[1:08:44] know that somebody kept me from being a
[1:08:50] wck yes you have spoken many things
[1:08:54] we have heard many things we have seen
[1:08:58] many things we have witnessed many
[1:09:01] things but one thing is sure we are
[1:09:05] still
[1:09:09] standing in the church or in the
[1:09:12] area somebody you give respect somebody
[1:09:17] you give owner somebody who looked like
[1:09:21] a role
[1:09:22] model finally
[1:09:24] he back slides finally he's fallen from
[1:09:29] Grace then is my who is
[1:09:32] me if so and
[1:09:35] so can do like this what is me the
[1:09:41] answer is he who can keep you from
[1:09:49] falling it is just a message of
[1:09:51] encouraging you as we encourage
[1:09:55] ourselves that is what is meant
[1:09:59] today in the
[1:10:01] message things that are to
[1:10:04] be I want to quote something if you
[1:10:07] would ex if you would uh uh allow me to
[1:10:12] quote
[1:10:14] it uh things that are to be it was
[1:10:18] preached on 50th uh December 65
[1:10:22] paragraph 39
[1:10:26] you
[1:10:27] know you grow from your
[1:10:31] birth when you was born and presented
[1:10:34] into this
[1:10:36] world God knew that you were going to be
[1:10:40] here in this
[1:10:43] earth and as you growed from birth to
[1:10:48] maturity things that seemed so strange
[1:10:51] to you in in your young
[1:10:55] Womanhood young Boyhood as children now
[1:11:00] seems very
[1:11:03] real you couldn't understand it when you
[1:11:06] was a child but now as you become a
[1:11:10] child as you become an adult you begin
[1:11:13] to understand and find out that
[1:11:16] everything was just set just
[1:11:22] right SC which has become real to
[1:11:27] you eventually you recognize that
[1:11:30] salvation belongs to
[1:11:33] God he's he's only the one who holds the
[1:11:38] franchise of eternal
[1:11:40] life you know we human
[1:11:42] beings make God more
[1:11:47] strict hard to
[1:11:49] enter by our set of
[1:11:52] rules by the way we set the
[1:12:00] bar but eventually we
[1:12:03] realize that is not the way we take it
[1:12:08] but it is the way God has
[1:12:11] it in Mother's Day there is where
[1:12:13] brother Bram says that when we reach
[1:12:15] there we will find people we never
[1:12:19] expected to be
[1:12:22] there because simply they are there and
[1:12:27] you not question how they are there
[1:12:31] because you eventually discover that you
[1:12:34] yourself you are there by
[1:12:38] Grace it is only somebody who kept you
[1:12:42] from
[1:12:45] falling if you would ask
[1:12:48] St when he saw
[1:12:51] Paul that younger man
[1:12:53] who stood there and gave right those who
[1:12:58] stoned
[1:12:59] him to Steven Paul was a
[1:13:04] mler really he deserved not to be a St
[1:13:08] messenger in heaven but now they meet
[1:13:12] Steven is a Believer and Paul is a St
[1:13:19] messenger then you begin to real realize
[1:13:23] what it
[1:13:25] means by faith
[1:13:28] Able by faith
[1:13:30] Enoch by faith
[1:13:33] Abraham you see those people in the Hall
[1:13:36] of
[1:13:37] Fame while it is true we cannot be
[1:13:42] able we cannot be
[1:13:44] Enoch we cannot be
[1:13:47] Abraham but the good thing is we serve
[1:13:51] the same God Amen
[1:13:54] The God Who made able
[1:13:57] succeed is the god who is telling you
[1:13:59] today that you are able
[1:14:03] also and it is not by your power it is
[1:14:08] not by your might but he who can keep
[1:14:11] you from falling a and is able
[1:14:17] to present you to
[1:14:21] himself you will remember this also will
[1:14:25] come to reality that really God does not
[1:14:29] call the
[1:14:30] perfect but he perfects the Cod
[1:14:35] amen you will know that God does not
[1:14:38] call the
[1:14:40] holy but he sanctifies the
[1:14:46] cold yeah as you
[1:14:49] mature you look along the highway
[1:14:54] you see many things others you cannot
[1:14:57] explain you see you cannot you cannot
[1:15:00] understand God but you consol yourself
[1:15:03] that somebody is keeping me
[1:15:10] alive then you will understand what it
[1:15:16] means that he who started a good thing
[1:15:20] in
[1:15:21] me will will finish
[1:15:25] it because you didn't start it
[1:15:30] yourself it is not the pastor who
[1:15:33] started
[1:15:34] it it is not your mother who started it
[1:15:38] amen but eventually you discover that
[1:15:42] you are in the
[1:15:44] journey when you go to see your address
[1:15:48] how did you get
[1:15:50] saved you just shake your head
[1:15:54] it simply has to be God and because you
[1:15:58] didn't call yourself and you didn't pay
[1:16:01] to be called then you know what means
[1:16:05] that he who started that good
[1:16:07] work will finish
[1:16:10] it because God did not call you to
[1:16:14] destroy
[1:16:15] you God does not work that way God
[1:16:20] called you for a purpose
[1:16:24] and he is patiently waiting for you to
[1:16:29] recognize your
[1:16:32] assignment because you are not God's
[1:16:36] plan
[1:16:37] B you are not God's plan C you are
[1:16:41] always God's plan
[1:16:44] a you were created and called in the
[1:16:49] church to solve a specific problem
[1:16:55] and that specific problem is what we
[1:17:00] call you
[1:17:02] assignment and it is only in your
[1:17:06] assignment that all your blessings that
[1:17:10] all you need are waiting for
[1:17:14] you they are waiting for your arrival
[1:17:18] and when you arrive there all you are
[1:17:23] needs will be
[1:17:33] activated yes you understand what it
[1:17:37] means that it is not he who
[1:17:41] Wills but is God who shows
[1:17:45] favor you will know what a favor
[1:17:49] means because you are favored of God
[1:17:54] God as we talk about favor let me read
[1:17:59] something for you concerning

[1:19:52] heard but I have my father to
[1:19:55] BU Jesus says come on follow me Let the

[1:20:13] interested but he's being
[1:20:17] compelled

[1:21:42] another one takes the whole
[1:21:46] lifetime and many times does not even

[1:21:53] second you get
[1:21:57] it that's what a favor
[1:22:00] is favor
[1:22:04] eliminates all years of pain and
[1:22:08] struggle it is simply
[1:22:13] there you finally
[1:22:15] realize that there is somebody who is
[1:22:19] making you compatible to
[1:22:21] Heaven you don't know what heaven looks
[1:22:25] like but there is a power inside you
[1:22:29] that is molding
[1:22:31] you that is working from the
[1:22:34] inside making you compatible to
[1:22:39] heaven and who is that he who is able to
[1:22:44] keep you from
[1:22:46] falling and to present you Fortress
[1:22:49] before his presence the presence of his
[1:22:52] Glory with exceeding Joy to the only
[1:22:58] wise God our savior be glory and Majesty
[1:23:03] dominion and power both now and ever
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:13] now we
[1:23:16] overcome by our Angelic
[1:23:20] resistance I want you to to mark
[1:23:25] that if you are
[1:23:27] Angel
[1:23:30] because we are given Revelation that as
[1:23:32] long as you are a son of God you are
[1:23:36] given a guiding
[1:23:38] angel in questions and
[1:23:44] answers 30th August
[1:23:48] 64 questions and answers
[1:23:50] for this was a question question that
[1:23:53] was asked explain about each person's
[1:23:56] Angel who abides with them from
[1:24:02] birth this is what brother Bram
[1:24:06] answers now this is pretty
[1:24:12] deep now there is an
[1:24:16] angel but this Angel of the
[1:24:19] Lord that are encamped about those that
[1:24:22] fear that fear
[1:24:25] Him you
[1:24:27] see now it isn't promised that a Sinners
[1:24:31] has
[1:24:33] Angels it is only the redeemed has
[1:24:38] Angels did you know
[1:24:42] that the angels of the Lord encamp about
[1:24:46] those that fear
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:51] Him I love that don't
[1:24:55] you
[1:24:56] now we
[1:24:58] overcome by the Angelic
[1:25:02] resistance because if you are a child of
[1:25:07] God you were represented in
[1:25:12] heaven your angel was
[1:25:15] there and was
[1:25:18] tempted but never
[1:25:21] fail
[1:25:26] is that
[1:25:28] right the angel was there was tempted
[1:25:33] but is not included in the a thir that
[1:25:36] went with the
[1:25:37] devil now he is here with
[1:25:42] you as you move whether conscious or
[1:25:46] unconscious when Temptations come he's
[1:25:50] there to guide you to guide you not to
[1:25:57] fall you can
[1:25:59] recall you see these are things we don't
[1:26:01] even speak
[1:26:03] out if it is a man this is something you
[1:26:07] have never told your
[1:26:09] wife if it is a woman this is something
[1:26:12] you have never told your husband and you
[1:26:15] will not tell
[1:26:17] him but you reach the certain
[1:26:20] situation where when you look back you
[1:26:24] are going to do something
[1:26:26] terrible but you cannot know even why
[1:26:31] and how you escaped
[1:26:33] it it is simple your angel was there
[1:26:43] am your angel was
[1:26:46] there because God knows
[1:26:49] you you see this is the other side of
[1:26:53] God even Lucifer didn't
[1:26:56] know you know you as a human being you
[1:27:00] have side a and side
[1:27:03] B you see we always look at side
[1:27:07] B of another
[1:27:10] individual but not God God always sees
[1:27:14] his side
[1:27:16] a there is something new that always
[1:27:20] excites God
[1:27:23] he will never see your
[1:27:27] negativity but is only we human beings
[1:27:30] who always see the negative part because
[1:27:34] to God even the prodal son was still a
[1:27:42] son it is the brother who was
[1:27:45] complaining you see father I have been
[1:27:48] with you and you have never even killed
[1:27:50] a c for me
[1:27:52] the son when he was coming back he knew
[1:27:56] he didn't have
[1:27:59] anything in the palace he only came to
[1:28:03] ask to be a
[1:28:05] servant but once a son always a
[1:28:10] son when he came expecting nothing the
[1:28:15] father had kept a ring for him the
[1:28:18] father had kept another L for him the
[1:28:22] father had kept good shoes for
[1:28:25] him because the prodal he was still a
[1:28:32] son that Brothers of Joseph tormented
[1:28:36] him and solded him to Egypt didn't stop
[1:28:40] them from being his
[1:28:42] brothers tormentas yes potential Killers
[1:28:46] yes but they still remained his
[1:28:51] brothers
[1:28:53] now if you remember how narrowly you
[1:28:56] escaped from committing sin you stop to
[1:29:00] wonder because it is simple he who can
[1:29:04] keep you from falling was simply there
[1:29:12] am Psalms
[1:29:14] 91 will be quickened in your
[1:29:17] life because it is where he says he will
[1:29:21] send his angels to guide you they are
[1:29:25] there to guide
[1:29:27] you
[1:29:30] now that's what I'm saying that if that
[1:29:33] angel that represents you resisted the
[1:29:35] devil
[1:29:37] then it will warn
[1:29:41] you look at John in the Book of
[1:29:46] Revelation with all those Mighty
[1:29:49] revs when he looks at that woman on the
[1:29:53] horse the Bible says he
[1:29:56] marved the real translation says he
[1:29:59] really
[1:30:01] enjoyed but look where the angel says
[1:30:03] come on John be careful be
[1:30:07] careful that a woman you have enjoyed
[1:30:10] let me tell you the secret about
[1:30:15] her come on Brethren you may
[1:30:19] wonder why why do we why do we need to
[1:30:22] learn about the Serpent's
[1:30:24] Seed it is simple when God reveals you
[1:30:29] The Master about the serpent seed he's
[1:30:32] simply telling you you are not the
[1:30:34] serpent
[1:30:37] seed when God reveals to you
[1:30:41] masteron he's simply telling you you are
[1:30:44] not under that
[1:30:48] system and he who can keep you from
[1:30:51] falling
[1:30:52] that's why he reveals to you the
[1:30:55] mysteries of the Kingdom because you are
[1:30:58] the only one that has the potentials of
[1:31:01] understanding
[1:31:03] them because he says the reason why I
[1:31:07] speak in
[1:31:08] pares it is I don't want them to
[1:31:12] understand because if they can
[1:31:15] understand they will believe and I will
[1:31:18] save them but I don't want to save them
[1:31:22] but to you I have given you the ability
[1:31:26] to understand the messies of the
[1:31:28] [Applause]
[1:31:30] Kingdom because I'm building
[1:31:33] you to be compatible with the kingdom
[1:31:37] why are you told that don't lie don't
[1:31:40] lie don't lie it is because there is no
[1:31:43] lying
[1:31:45] there yeah don't steal don't steal don't
[1:31:49] steal if you would go there with that
[1:31:51] that stealing demon the streets of
[1:31:55] Heaven are gold you cause trouble
[1:32:08] there I want to quote you
[1:32:13] another quote it is from questions and
[1:32:16] answers
[1:32:20] again
[1:32:22] simply
[1:32:23] means you your life proves what you
[1:32:28] are questions and answers preached on
[1:32:32] third January
[1:32:36] 54 paragraph
[1:32:39] 78
[1:32:41] says as I said in the
[1:32:45] beginning what you are somewh
[1:32:48] El is what you reflect here
[1:32:54] what you
[1:32:56] are what you oral body is up
[1:33:02] yonder what your Cal body is somewhere
[1:33:06] else is what you are reflecting back
[1:33:11] here in the spirit
[1:33:14] world what you are is what you are
[1:33:20] here if you are still vgar minded and so
[1:33:25] forth in the spirit land you are VG
[1:33:30] minded
[1:33:34] here if you still got
[1:33:36] Mar
[1:33:38] Envy
[1:33:40] Strife you are in the spirit land with
[1:33:44] that it reflects back
[1:33:48] here but if your whole innermost being
[1:33:51] has has become cleansed and
[1:33:53] purged it shows that you've got a body
[1:33:57] out yonder waiting that has been
[1:34:01] cleansed and pged and it is reacting
[1:34:04] Back In the
[1:34:07] Flesh don't you see there it
[1:34:10] is if this Earth Tabernacle is
[1:34:14] dissolved we we have got one already
[1:34:20] waiting that is also
[1:34:28] powerful now as you
[1:34:31] continue as you
[1:34:35] mature because as long as you are a
[1:34:39] seity maturity is not an
[1:34:43] option it is a
[1:34:46] must and at maturity there is no
[1:34:50] counterfeiting
[1:34:52] you are simply what you
[1:34:54] are you cannot duplicate
[1:34:58] maturity in the parable of the seed and
[1:35:01] the
[1:35:01] S when the servants came to the master
[1:35:05] and said Master do you know what we are
[1:35:07] going to do let us go and PR out those
[1:35:10] evil ons the master says be careful
[1:35:14] because in doing that you can also PR
[1:35:16] out the innocent and the good ones but
[1:35:19] let them mature
[1:35:22] because at maturity you are shown
[1:35:24] exactly what you
[1:35:27] are the only problem the seed does not
[1:35:31] want to
[1:35:32] recognize because if the Bible says let
[1:35:35] the evil be evil I mean when you see
[1:35:39] somebody being evil in the evening time
[1:35:42] don't get scared he is meant to be
[1:35:49] that just thank God
[1:35:52] that he has kept you and you are not
[1:35:54] that
[1:35:57] evil when you see somebody acting and
[1:36:00] seemingly yeah this is the maturity time
[1:36:03] don't get surprised it is meant to be so
[1:36:07] you cannot fast it out you cannot pray
[1:36:10] it out you only thank God that he made
[1:36:14] you what you
[1:36:17] are you know in Uganda we we we mut in
[1:36:23] buses here probably you are in ples and
[1:36:27] I don't know but now when you get a
[1:36:31] ticket what I want to know to find out
[1:36:34] is can this ticket allow you to enter
[1:36:36] the
[1:36:37] bus and when the bus pulls over on the
[1:36:41] bus stop you make sure you jump in the
[1:36:44] bus when you jump in the
[1:36:46] bus mind you are standing where you are
[1:36:50] standing
[1:36:52] immediately you enter in thank God that
[1:36:54] you are already in don't look around to
[1:36:58] other Travelers amen you didn't create
[1:37:01] the bus you didn't put there the way
[1:37:04] your assignment is enter and go to your
[1:37:08] position that's all let the bus continue
[1:37:11] its Journey it will invite in other
[1:37:14] passengers it will drop others he who
[1:37:17] can keep you from falling will take you
[1:37:21] to your
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:29] destination then you continue to
[1:37:32] understand what Jesus meant in John
[1:37:36] 17:2 that while I was with them in the
[1:37:39] world I kept them in thy name those that
[1:37:44] you gave me I have kept and none of them
[1:37:48] is
[1:37:49] lost but only the sign of
[1:37:53] petion that the scrup might be
[1:37:58] fulfilled if the spirit in in Paul says
[1:38:03] in later days terrible times will come
[1:38:07] you will not discern those terrible
[1:38:09] times on trees it will be on human
[1:38:13] beings then you understand John
[1:38:18] 6:39 what means and and this is the
[1:38:22] Father's will which has sent me that all
[1:38:26] which he has given me I should lose
[1:38:30] nothing but should rise it up again at
[1:38:34] the last
[1:38:38] day that's why he had to go for
[1:38:45] Peter really Peter betrayed
[1:38:48] Jesus betrayed him at at the moment
[1:38:52] Jesus needed somebody to confort
[1:38:57] him as I I told you earlier you can
[1:39:01] forget everything but you never forget
[1:39:05] somebody who solved your
[1:39:12] problem Jesus needed somebody to stand
[1:39:16] by
[1:39:19] him I was speaking some
[1:39:23] where about mob
[1:39:27] Justice you know you have your own
[1:39:29] problems here in
[1:39:30] Canada when I talk about mob Justice
[1:39:33] there is no mob Justice
[1:39:35] here but when you go to
[1:39:38] Uganda oh we see a lot of
[1:39:40] them uh I may not explain why there is
[1:39:44] Mob justice but finally people say we
[1:39:47] will take this into our own hands we are
[1:39:49] not waiting for the government
[1:39:54] now there is one rule in mob
[1:39:58] Justice because they are ready to kill
[1:40:02] you and they are determined to do
[1:40:06] it if
[1:40:08] one among those people who are ready to
[1:40:12] kill you stands and says but let us
[1:40:14] first wait let us first
[1:40:17] understand you are
[1:40:19] saved completely you
[1:40:21] saved because they are already
[1:40:26] divided remember when the San were
[1:40:29] talking about Jesus they all had one
[1:40:31] thing in common until one man stood and
[1:40:33] said by the way does our Ro allow us to
[1:40:38] condemn somebody without first hearing
[1:40:41] him do you know what the Bible says they
[1:40:44] turned to him and said ah come on tell
[1:40:46] us are you also from from his PR and the
[1:40:50] Bible says they
[1:40:54] passed so Jesus needed Peter and Peter
[1:40:59] betrayed him three
[1:41:03] times if it was you and
[1:41:06] me friendship completely cut
[1:41:13] off friendship
[1:41:18] completely but no he who can keep you
[1:41:22] from
[1:41:26] falling Peter had already
[1:41:28] resigned boys let us go back to our
[1:41:31] usual
[1:41:32] jobs we had a vision and the vision be
[1:41:36] is no longer there let us go back at
[1:41:41] fishing
[1:41:44] remember signs that you are going to
[1:41:46] back
[1:41:49] right when you start dreaming what I
[1:41:52] used to do before you got
[1:41:54] saved know that that is one of the
[1:41:57] frags do you hear that when you start
[1:42:01] dreaming you see pictures of what I used
[1:42:04] to do before you came to Jesus
[1:42:07] Christ those are wors of the red
[1:42:10] frags so Peter is already on the
[1:42:15] sea as he was there I don't know what he
[1:42:18] was thinking about then somebody's the
[1:42:21] shore on the coast boys is there
[1:42:25] anything you know the story finally he
[1:42:28] recognizes his master he had come for
[1:42:33] Peter Peter do you love me three times
[1:42:37] Peter do you love me he is calling Peter
[1:42:40] back because the assignment the
[1:42:43] assignment of Peter despite his whatever
[1:42:47] he did had the Keys of the Kingdom
[1:42:58] talk about a
[1:43:01] friend you
[1:43:03] see Jesus is a true
[1:43:06] friend Jesus is a true
[1:43:10] friend you see there are three things in
[1:43:13] life that we need in this Christian
[1:43:16] walk and one is God you see one is is
[1:43:20] the holy ghost that Jesus he does not
[1:43:24] need any information about you he knows
[1:43:28] you before he created you he KN he knew
[1:43:31] you so nobody can talk against you
[1:43:35] before
[1:43:37] him then another thing what are
[1:43:42] you then another thing your
[1:43:46] assignment so Jesus goes and brings back
[1:43:51] a Peter who was already going
[1:43:55] away then one
[1:43:57] day the disciples are in the boat with
[1:44:02] Jesus I hope up to now my accent is not
[1:44:06] a problem
[1:44:09] atast then Jesus tells the disciples
[1:44:12] come on move the boat to this direction
[1:44:16] move it he said Master do you know where
[1:44:19] we are going
[1:44:21] yeah move but there is a mad man
[1:44:25] there and always ston people come on
[1:44:29] move because this mad man also is the
[1:44:33] seed of
[1:44:35] God live around the
[1:44:38] madness live around the situation you
[1:44:40] are in the God we serve is bigger than
[1:44:45] the situation you are
[1:44:49] in the God we serve is bigger than the
[1:44:55] Glorious that is standing in your
[1:45:03] way the God we serve is bigger than the
[1:45:07] Red Sea that is cutting across where you
[1:45:10] are
[1:45:12] passing come on continue move the
[1:45:17] boat by the time they are reaching the
[1:45:19] shore the m is
[1:45:23] there but when Jesus comes
[1:45:26] closer that what was inside the mad man
[1:45:32] recognized that this guest now that is
[1:45:35] coming
[1:45:36] a is a different
[1:45:39] guest you know the story The Mad Man was
[1:45:46] delivered he who can keep you from
[1:45:49] falling am
[1:45:53] amen make sure that you have the Holy
[1:45:55] Ghost Inside you because sickness can
[1:45:58] come situations can come but remember
[1:46:02] this somebody is in control
[1:46:12] amen now Jesus loved the
[1:46:17] hars no wonder the bread of Jesus Christ
[1:46:22] is typed with lahab the
[1:46:26] harod lahab the harod types the Bride of
[1:46:29] Jesus
[1:46:31] Christ but I'm going to talk about these
[1:46:34] three other women of ill famed life and
[1:46:40] how Jesus went for
[1:46:47] them one
[1:46:49] day
[1:46:51] Pastor
[1:46:52] Jesus is conducting a service of
[1:46:57] healing as the church was in
[1:47:00] progress here comes the
[1:47:04] Pharisees the message Believers of the
[1:47:08] day they pull a poor old woman poor
[1:47:12] woman they don't even recognize the
[1:47:15] church
[1:47:16] order because the Bible says they
[1:47:19] brought the poor woman to the
[1:47:24] ppit and here they say uhuh we have got
[1:47:29] him you know how we message Believers
[1:47:33] make it complicated for
[1:47:36] women we are busy telling women don't do
[1:47:39] this don't do this don't do this don't
[1:47:41] do this the list is very
[1:47:45] wrong until if we are not careful we are
[1:47:48] Muslims already
[1:47:51] right the only thing that's remaining is
[1:47:53] putting a curtain in
[1:47:56] between but we never tell women what
[1:47:58] they can do what they can do what they
[1:48:01] can do because there is a lot they can
[1:48:04] do
[1:48:07] also so they bring the poor woman
[1:48:10] defenseless they never brought a
[1:48:13] man
[1:48:17] right so to beginning with there was no
[1:48:20] justice but that is the way of the
[1:48:24] Pharisees so now the woman is
[1:48:27] there whatever Jesus was writing down
[1:48:30] was making an impact on the
[1:48:33] Pharisees you know these are the group
[1:48:35] of people that never
[1:48:37] repent they never repent don't expect
[1:48:41] the Pharisee to repent because he is
[1:48:44] meant not to
[1:48:49] repent
[1:48:55] so
[1:48:56] now they go one by one and the woman is
[1:49:00] left there
[1:49:03] alone
[1:49:05] woman nobody has condemned you yes my
[1:49:11] Lord then Jesus
[1:49:13] says neither will I condemn you but he
[1:49:17] adds something go and do it no
[1:49:22] more you go to the
[1:49:25] original it says go and I give you
[1:49:29] ability not to do it
[1:49:34] anymore when God delivers you he
[1:49:38] delivers you
[1:49:44] completely total
[1:49:48] Deliverance that's what means total
[1:49:51] Deliverance yes only it depends on how
[1:49:54] you
[1:49:55] receive what you have is not what God
[1:49:58] intends for you it is only what you are
[1:50:01] able to
[1:50:03] receive what you are able to receive is
[1:50:06] what only works for you if you could
[1:50:10] could only realize that more is for
[1:50:17] you what God gave Israel they haven't
[1:50:20] even conquered even a million because
[1:50:24] their boundaries is in ifhr
[1:50:27] River they are
[1:50:32] still so the woman is saved he who can
[1:50:37] keep you from
[1:50:38] falling they they brought the woman to
[1:50:41] be stoned he left Jesus's feet
[1:50:48] delivered they were three of of
[1:50:51] them I'm going very
[1:50:54] slow now two are
[1:50:58] remaining then one day a Pharisee
[1:51:03] again invites
[1:51:06] Jesus Jesus I'm inviting
[1:51:10] you to my
[1:51:13] house when Jesus is invited he always
[1:51:17] keeps his appointment amen yes whether
[1:51:21] you want to abuse him whether you want
[1:51:25] to make fun of him
[1:51:28] he keeps his
[1:51:33] appointment see Jesus in Simon's
[1:51:39] house read between the
[1:51:42] lines he knew that there is another
[1:51:46] harot that is coming and needed
[1:51:49] Deliverance
[1:51:52] you may be here and you need Deliverance
[1:51:57] also he who can keep you from falling
[1:52:01] there is Deliverance for
[1:52:04] you you just reach out then that woman I
[1:52:09] don't know probably he she's attracted
[1:52:12] by the aroma of the food expensive food
[1:52:16] whatever but he comes by
[1:52:22] there he is she is on Jesus's
[1:52:25] feet look at Simon uhuh didn't I tell
[1:52:29] you to the fellow pastors if that man
[1:52:33] was a prophet he would know who that
[1:52:41] woman you
[1:52:43] know we know that we are taught that you
[1:52:46] don't receive an offering of har don't
[1:52:49] we
[1:52:51] but here Jesus is accepting everything
[1:52:54] the har is bringing think about
[1:53:04] that
[1:53:06] then Jesus says
[1:53:08] Simon I have a word for
[1:53:12] you you called
[1:53:14] me and I am
[1:53:18] here you made fun of
[1:53:20] me and there is no
[1:53:23] problem but look at this
[1:53:26] woman you cannot even accept her
[1:53:29] TI you cannot even accept her her her
[1:53:34] offering because that's how we are
[1:53:37] taught but since she reached
[1:53:41] here see what she has been
[1:53:44] doing
[1:53:46] woman your sins which are many
[1:53:50] are now
[1:53:53] forgiven he who can keep you from
[1:53:56] falling will forgive you whatever Hep of
[1:53:59] sins that is on
[1:54:02] you because that harot woman had
[1:54:06] representation in
[1:54:09] [Music]
[1:54:10] heaven probably she entered that
[1:54:13] business because of severe
[1:54:16] situations but when God looks at her
[1:54:20] it wasn't so from the
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:25] beginning you
[1:54:28] see you are a triun a tri a three a
[1:54:33] triun
[1:54:34] figure there is a way you know
[1:54:38] yourself really when you sin you don't
[1:54:42] sin in a
[1:54:44] vision when you sin you don't sin in a
[1:54:48] dream when you sin you
[1:54:52] sin and you know you have done
[1:55:00] it then there is a way people know
[1:55:03] you whether you want it or not you you
[1:55:06] don't invite them to know you that way
[1:55:09] they simply know you that
[1:55:12] way and then there is the way God knows
[1:55:17] you Paul one day say I
[1:55:26] blasphemed ananas go gets a vision you
[1:55:30] go into a street called this
[1:55:33] one there is a man called
[1:55:37] Saul what a type of vision is this Lord
[1:55:40] we know we have heard about that man
[1:55:42] that he's a
[1:55:44] killer and the mission why he has come
[1:55:47] into this town is to grab us and take us
[1:55:50] into prison and kill us he's a killer
[1:55:53] God says okay you know he's a killer but
[1:55:57] for me he is my
[1:56:04] vessel so the way God knows you is the
[1:56:08] most
[1:56:10] important not what you know about
[1:56:13] yourself not what others know about
[1:56:16] you I was saying elsewhere that look
[1:56:19] here
[1:56:22] never try to please
[1:56:25] everybody because you never please
[1:56:30] everybody you are not created to please
[1:56:35] everybody there are people you will
[1:56:37] never please no matter how much you try
[1:56:42] you are simply wasting your
[1:56:46] time not that they are bad people they
[1:56:49] are not
[1:56:50] it is simple they were not put into your
[1:56:54] life
[1:56:55] chain you are not assigned to
[1:57:00] them so while you are wasting time
[1:57:04] trying your L best to pleas
[1:57:06] X why is waiting for your
[1:57:11] arrival and when you arrive into wise
[1:57:16] life everything of his is
[1:57:29] activated so
[1:57:31] now another woman is delivered because
[1:57:35] that or
[1:57:37] so is represented in
[1:57:40] heaven then one
[1:57:47] remaining the sun FS
[1:57:50] he has to pass through a city called
[1:57:55] cyle because the Revelation is the son
[1:57:59] cannot do anything unless the father
[1:58:01] shows
[1:58:06] him he is surrounded by message
[1:58:09] Believers
[1:58:12] again do you know why I said
[1:58:17] that when he knows Jesus Pastor Jesus
[1:58:20] that is now approaching to a woman says
[1:58:24] come on
[1:58:25] guys go back into the
[1:58:28] city to buy the
[1:58:31] provisions remember when they came
[1:58:34] back you know what the Bible says they
[1:58:37] marveled because he was speaking to a
[1:58:41] woman but they never questioned him but
[1:58:45] the pastor is speaking to a
[1:58:48] woman
[1:58:57] you see women are are made in such a
[1:59:01] way that when a Revival is going to
[1:59:04] Break
[1:59:05] Forth they are the first to
[1:59:12] respond they are created in such a way
[1:59:14] that they respond to
[1:59:18] B
[1:59:19] and that's one of the
[1:59:24] qualities you see as the church
[1:59:28] here you have everything you need to
[1:59:30] start a
[1:59:39] Revival I know I know I know I know that
[1:59:43] the prophet said that the Revival is
[1:59:45] over in America and Canada I know that
[1:59:50] but don't create it into a mediocre
[1:59:54] something that God is not moving in
[1:59:56] America and
[1:59:58] Canada God is here you are a moving
[2:00:08] Revival God is here you are a moving
[2:00:11] seed inside you is everything that is
[2:00:15] needed to
[2:00:17] activate the move of the Holy Ghost
[2:00:20] Inside
[2:00:23] you oh the Revival is over you see we
[2:00:26] cannot we we cannot do this who told you
[2:00:30] you give it a chance and see give give
[2:00:34] it a chance and see if God cannot move
[2:00:38] [Applause]
[2:00:42] here give a chance a seed which is
[2:00:45] inside you and see if it cannot
[2:00:48] germinate you see you see we cannot
[2:00:51] testify you see you need wisdom who told
[2:00:54] you that testifying is about going on
[2:00:57] the street with loud speakers no there
[2:00:59] are many ways wisdom is the ability to
[2:01:04] know the
[2:01:06] difference you see Paul says to the
[2:01:09] Greeks I acted as
[2:01:13] Greek that means in every situation you
[2:01:15] have your way
[2:01:17] out you can testify die you can do
[2:01:20] everything there is a Revival here there
[2:01:23] is all the potentials of a Revival here
[2:01:33] am I hope I haven't hurt your
[2:01:37] feelings but I'm activating the seed
[2:01:39] inside
[2:01:41] you remember I told you the three
[2:01:44] things
[2:01:46] God then what type of seed are you
[2:01:52] but you have to put into use that seed
[2:01:55] ability that a seed
[2:01:58] capability because only when you
[2:02:00] activate the seed in you will you know
[2:02:03] your
[2:02:06] assignment so now they go to buy
[2:02:10] the the
[2:02:12] stuffs
[2:02:14] woman give me a drink you know the
[2:02:17] story
[2:02:19] go and call your
[2:02:22] husband you know the story finally the
[2:02:25] woman who would come at noon because she
[2:02:29] didn't want to involve herself with the
[2:02:31] community she's running to the community
[2:02:34] says come and see a
[2:02:36] man isn't he the
[2:02:42] Messiah he's the only one Jesus would
[2:02:45] say I am
[2:02:47] he
[2:02:49] he couldn't say it direct to to the
[2:02:52] governor no he couldn't say it to the
[2:02:55] Pharisees direct no but this is the
[2:02:58] human being whomes saying I am the
[2:03:04] Messiah you know when God loves you he
[2:03:08] reveals himself to
[2:03:11] [Applause]
[2:03:17] you
[2:03:21] look at Jesus hanging on the
[2:03:26] cross it is the sixth
[2:03:29] hour all the pain and
[2:03:33] anguish all the TOs and
[2:03:40] everything and now
[2:03:42] passes another
[2:03:45] pass have you ever
[2:03:47] recognized that Jesus was only waiting
[2:03:51] for one Thief there to recognize who he
[2:03:59] is condemned by the
[2:04:02] society he had already condemned
[2:04:06] himself because finally he says come on
[2:04:10] my fellow
[2:04:12] Thieves for us we are here hanging here
[2:04:16] because of what we did
[2:04:19] we deserve the
[2:04:24] punishment but the 3 hours I have been
[2:04:27] hanging
[2:04:28] here I
[2:04:31] recognize this
[2:04:33] man because I'm hearing from the crowd
[2:04:37] I'm hearing
[2:04:39] everywhere this man is
[2:04:42] different then he turns to him he says
[2:04:45] I'm hearing you talking about the
[2:04:47] kingdom
[2:04:49] when you reach there remember
[2:04:57] me then Jesus says it is
[2:05:05] finished he who will never lose any of
[2:05:12] his had to wait for this
[2:05:15] s to
[2:05:17] recognize who he
[2:05:24] is remember me says no no no no not only
[2:05:28] remembering you we are going
[2:05:32] together he gave up his ghost it is
[2:05:47] finished
[2:05:49] we can say many
[2:05:52] things I didn't ask you Pastor how how
[2:05:57] long I will be on the
[2:06:01] pit so I have to be very
[2:06:04] quick that's why I'm turning many
[2:06:11] pages now we come quickly to my life
[2:06:17] story this happened in brother brenham's
[2:06:24] life my life
[2:06:32] story listen you are message Believers
[2:06:35] you have listened to this many many
[2:06:42] times I started up the L
[2:06:46] again and I turned to look at this again
[2:06:49] and when it did a human voice just as
[2:06:53] audible as mine is
[2:06:57] said don't you never
[2:07:00] drink
[2:07:02] smoke or def fire your body in any
[2:07:06] way there will be a work for you to do
[2:07:09] when you get
[2:07:12] older every message believer knows where
[2:07:15] I'm
[2:07:17] reading why it liked to scare me to
[2:07:21] death you could imagine how a little
[2:07:24] pharoh felt I dropped those buckets and
[2:07:27] home I went just as hard as I could go
[2:07:30] screaming at the top of my
[2:07:34] voice now God was giving him a
[2:07:38] commission never
[2:07:40] drink Never
[2:07:43] Smoke we in the fivefold ministry we
[2:07:47] ever drunk we ever
[2:07:51] smoke we ever did many
[2:07:54] things but God who is rich in
[2:07:57] Mery is still using
[2:08:05] us but now look at brother
[2:08:09] Bram he heard that
[2:08:12] voice very clear Never Smoke never drink
[2:08:18] never do that because there is a
[2:08:21] commission do you know what he tried
[2:08:25] everything he tried to smoke he tried to
[2:08:29] drink

[2:09:04] into the digital
[2:09:06] system never try
[2:09:09] that because somebody is doing that does
[2:09:13] not necessarily mean that it is
[2:09:17] good

[2:09:22] society but which

[2:12:07] Bible I heard something
[2:12:13] going I tried it again I couldn't get it
[2:12:17] to my mouth

[2:12:24] down then they got to laughing at
[2:12:28] me and I walked home went up through the
[2:12:32] fields sat down there crying and it was
[2:12:35] a terrible
[2:12:36] life he who will keep you from
[2:12:40] falling was there could not allow your
[2:12:44] Prophet to
[2:12:46] smoke because
[2:12:48] the instruction was was never smoke
[2:12:52] never
[2:12:55] drink but he was going to
[2:12:59] smoke then it is not yet
[2:13:03] over like I'm telling you I told you
[2:13:06] earlier that God is training
[2:13:10] soldiers he's not training wimping
[2:13:13] crying
[2:13:16] babies
[2:13:19] you face a
[2:13:20] situation then you start
[2:13:23] crying when you cry and cry and cry then
[2:13:27] God comes and says Okay jump on my back
[2:13:30] I've have come for your
[2:13:32] too come on boy you have failed the
[2:13:37] test that situation is still there is
[2:13:42] waiting for you to overcome
[2:13:46] amen one
[2:13:49] day he's having a walk probably an
[2:13:53] evening walk with his dad and dadd is

[2:14:30] up I handed the bot back and took off
[2:14:35] down through the fields as hard as I can
[2:14:39] crying something wouldn't let me do
[2:14:44] it you see I could I could not say I was
[2:14:48] any good I was determined to do it but
[2:14:53] it is God's grace Amazing Grace that
[2:14:57] kept me from doing those things I wanted
[2:15:00] to do them myself but he just wouldn't
[2:15:03] let me do
[2:15:09] it that is what a favor
[2:15:14] is you see when the dev goes to ause you
[2:15:19] at least once upon a time he's telling
[2:15:21] the
[2:15:22] truth this time the devil is telling the
[2:15:26] truth because you are back home
[2:15:30] fighting and he goes to report brother
[2:15:33] son so is
[2:15:35] fighting and indeed you are
[2:15:38] fighting he's expecting a straight away
[2:15:43] judgment but here you are savior you are
[2:15:45] preder you are everything you are lawyer
[2:15:48] Jesus stands up yes he is
[2:15:50] fighting but you caused
[2:15:58] it remember when Joshua the high priest
[2:16:02] was
[2:16:03] accused look at him he's wearing
[2:16:07] rugs and his high
[2:16:12] priest then the voice says no no no no
[2:16:15] no no this is a fire brand
[2:16:18] somebody snatched out of fire then he
[2:16:21] says bring cross and cross
[2:16:34] him he who can keep you from
[2:16:45] falling
[2:16:46] listen
[2:16:48] Christ is the mystery of godhead
[2:16:51] revealed of God
[2:16:54] revealed 28th July
[2:17:00] 63 the anointed
[2:17:03] man now anointed
[2:17:08] people you see already you have those
[2:17:12] three
[2:17:15] anointings the David
[2:17:18] anointings you are a priest you are a
[2:17:22] king you are a prophet in order to
[2:17:25] qualify to be a
[2:17:33] bright to bring back the anointed
[2:17:37] bride and the
[2:17:40] bridegroom anointed by accepting what
[2:17:43] Eve turned
[2:17:45] down and Adam coming back with the
[2:17:48] anointing of the
[2:17:50] word because he
[2:17:52] said my word is
[2:17:55] spirit see Anointed with the
[2:18:01] word what a turned down he comes back
[2:18:05] and you
[2:18:10] accept paragraph 381 see how that hybrid
[2:18:15] condition again just exactly what he
[2:18:19] done paragraph 382 he told if don't you
[2:18:24] do this don't you do that and you can do
[2:18:28] this and that and Satan said oh you
[2:18:33] know but she turned around and listened
[2:18:37] to
[2:18:39] him then
[2:18:41] 384 but the a in the last day is not
[2:18:46] going to do it
[2:18:50] why because she's predestinated not to
[2:18:55] do
[2:19:00] it do you love that you already have
[2:19:04] that
[2:19:05] insurance you already have that
[2:19:08] assurance that you were predestinated
[2:19:11] not to do
[2:19:16] it
[2:19:18] you will you will be tempted as a for
[2:19:21] but you were predestinated not to do
[2:19:33] it you will be
[2:19:35] tempted like
[2:19:37] anything
[2:19:39] shaken trumped on
[2:19:43] everything but you were predestinated
[2:19:46] not to do it
[2:19:51] amen you see the Bible says that all the
[2:19:55] prophets who got what will happen in the
[2:19:58] end said my will anybody
[2:20:04] survive but is
[2:20:07] simple Sovereign Grace in Sovereign
[2:20:12] time he who can keep you because in
[2:20:16] every age they are
[2:20:24] Overcomers don't you think that Abraham
[2:20:27] was giving away
[2:20:30] Sarah you see your own security is in
[2:20:34] the
[2:20:36] Homeland as long as you are in the
[2:20:38] Homeland you are not going to be scared
[2:20:41] of the beauty of your
[2:20:43] wife because nobody is looking at her
[2:20:49] but outside you are home run come
[2:20:52] on come on come
[2:20:55] on Abraham was ready to give away Sarah
[2:21:00] to save his
[2:21:03] neor Sarah was already in the
[2:21:08] palace and the King was
[2:21:11] prepared to enter the
[2:21:16] room
[2:21:17] but Sarah had a specific
[2:21:22] assignment he who can keep you from
[2:21:25] falling hard to preserve
[2:21:29] Sarah King you are more than a dead
[2:21:33] man you are taking somebody else's wife
[2:21:37] God you know the Integrity of my heart
[2:21:39] it is that man who told me that it is a
[2:21:44] sister and Sarah also accepted that she
[2:21:48] is a
[2:21:49] sister they are liars I am
[2:21:54] not okay now what you're going to do you
[2:21:59] have to go to My Lying
[2:22:02] prophet and he will pray over
[2:22:05] you if not I will curse you
[2:22:09] huah see a rightous man going to a lying
[2:22:13] Prophet because the lying Prophet is the
[2:22:17] the only one that has
[2:22:26] blessings he who keeps you from
[2:22:31] falling
[2:22:33] gifts and callings are without
[2:22:40] repentance usually it is a stumbling
[2:22:43] block in the
[2:22:46] church that you find that a sister that
[2:22:49] is that God is
[2:22:54] using is again a
[2:22:58] gosper she
[2:23:03] gops the ter
[2:23:08] bear until we are
[2:23:10] told we know how we are
[2:23:13] told let me tell you God is above Church
[2:23:16] order
[2:23:18] did you hear that God is above Church
[2:23:21] order Church order is simply to those
[2:23:24] who are not led by the spirit of God so
[2:23:27] we have to have some organizational
[2:23:32] structure we we organize them
[2:23:35] somehow but when the Holy Spirit takes
[2:23:39] over you cannot organize the holy
[2:23:43] spirit so that assist in the corner God
[2:23:46] is using her
[2:23:48] but again he has side
[2:23:52] B so you have to use wisdom to know when
[2:23:57] God is doing his works and when the th
[2:24:03] is
[2:24:05] probably that ter bear needs your
[2:24:08] prayers also to overcome those
[2:24:14] demons but as sah was going
[2:24:19] but God had to
[2:24:24] protect the object he was going to
[2:24:28] use back at brother
[2:24:30] Bram in my life story as I'm winding
[2:24:39] up my life
[2:24:41] story are you picking
[2:24:45] something
[2:24:48] you
[2:24:52] see we are
[2:24:56] saved I remember that
[2:24:59] day when I was standing at a certain
[2:25:04] spot and I was holding a bottle of beer
[2:25:08] this is my testimony it was a Sunday
[2:25:15] morning that was 19
[2:25:20] 19880 then I Heard a Voice okay continue
[2:25:25] drinking as others are going to worship
[2:25:35] me since that
[2:25:38] time things
[2:25:43] changed you can go back and press your
[2:25:48] address how did you
[2:25:52] enter Did you enter by the
[2:25:55] door he who can keep you from falling he
[2:26:00] who started a good work in you
[2:26:05] amen remember the formula of Salvation
[2:26:08] is you accept Jesus when you accept
[2:26:15] Jesus you
[2:26:18] confess remember when you were drinking
[2:26:23] the day you said I accept Jesus don't
[2:26:26] think that that desire of drinking goes
[2:26:29] automatically
[2:26:32] no do you know why I said that I have G
[2:26:36] to see when a new believer comes in
[2:26:40] those old
[2:26:42] Fighters are always pointing at him or
[2:26:45] her they expect her to change
[2:26:49] instantly when them that have been
[2:26:52] decades in the message know that they
[2:26:54] are not completely
[2:26:58] changed you expect that to be an
[2:27:01] angel and you are
[2:27:03] criticizing oh he looks is not a seat
[2:27:08] come on she came in last
[2:27:11] year you were there 40 years right and
[2:27:16] you know there is something chonic
[2:27:18] inside
[2:27:28] you so he can keep you from
[2:27:35] falling he met me with a bottle of
[2:27:39] beer but today when I I even sense beer
[2:27:44] I I get headache so it is simple you
[2:27:48] confess you confess you
[2:27:51] confess finally after some time God will
[2:27:55] make your body obey your
[2:28:01] confession so it is a
[2:28:04] process look at your life is there
[2:28:08] something you have failed to
[2:28:10] overcome he who can keep you from
[2:28:14] falling will deal with it at certain
[2:28:18] point Hallelujah you keep
[2:28:21] walking knowing in mind that he never
[2:28:24] saved you to lose
[2:28:29] you some of the things he lets them
[2:28:33] there to keep you on
[2:28:38] check always remind you that you are a
[2:28:41] human being you'll never be an
[2:28:45] angel
[2:28:47] so God is not
[2:28:49] surprised because he knows he's in
[2:28:53] control oh come on this demon of
[2:28:56] lying you know you know that after 40
[2:29:01] years in the message every time you
[2:29:03] catch yourself
[2:29:06] lying even after the baptism of the Holy
[2:29:09] Spirit you are
[2:29:10] lying you you expected that after the
[2:29:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost you are free
[2:29:16] from lying no you are still lying
[2:29:19] Abraham lied after the change of the
[2:29:28] body
[2:29:30] because when you received the baptism of
[2:29:33] the Holy
[2:29:34] Ghost it is not this body that received
[2:29:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:29:40] amen because this body will never be
[2:29:43] baptized with the Holy
[2:29:45] Ghost
[2:30:00] your mind will ever always be the Battle
[2:30:04] Ground and the devil will always have
[2:30:07] access to your
[2:30:13] mind that a dog will always fight those
[2:30:18] two dogs will always
[2:30:27] fight so we
[2:30:34] go my life story I am winding up par
[2:30:38] ofra

[2:31:15] suicide
[2:31:18] you know brother Bram was filled with
[2:31:21] the Holy Ghost
[2:31:22] right but the Holy Ghost did not stop
[2:31:25] him from contemplating

[2:31:32] it I said God I hate to do this I'm a
[2:31:38] coward but sh dad is going to see you

[2:32:02] my hands up like this to my face crying
[2:32:06] it was God's grace oh I wouldn't be
[2:32:09] having healing service here I am sure of
[2:32:12] the of that it was him God pro
[2:32:16] protecting his
[2:32:17] gift not
[2:32:21] me he who can keep you from
[2:32:27] falling the devil will work on you as
[2:32:31] far as God will allow
[2:32:33] him and he won't go any
[2:32:40] further he was not yet
[2:32:44] finished you know we human
[2:32:48] beings the thing goes that we walk with
[2:32:51] hob Nails nailed shoes Where Angels Fear
[2:33:01] even I started around the
[2:33:04] house he picked the mail in the
[2:33:08] house I took the mail and looked in the
[2:33:10] mail and the first thing there was har
[2:33:13] Christmas savings 80 cents
[2:33:17] Miss Shon Lo
[2:33:19] Bram oh there it was
[2:33:25] again I had been game warden I reached
[2:33:29] in there and got my gun
[2:33:33] pistol he said Lord I can't go this
[2:33:38] anymore I'm dying so
[2:33:41] tormented I pulled the hammer back on
[2:33:44] the gun put it on my head
[2:33:48] KNE there that in that dark room then I
[2:33:53] said Our Father who is in
[2:33:56] heaven he was
[2:33:59] praying HED be thy name thy kingdom come
[2:34:04] thine will be done and as I tried I
[2:34:08] squeezed that triggers I had as I
[2:34:13] could it wouldn't go off
[2:34:19] and I thought oh God you are just
[2:34:20] tearing me to Pieces what have I done
[2:34:23] you won't even let me
[2:34:26] die he want you
[2:34:30] die there is a prophecy over
[2:34:34] you as long as you are a child of God
[2:34:38] there is a prophecy over
[2:34:41] you something was spoken over you before
[2:34:44] the foundation of the world
[2:34:48] over Jeremiah it was I ordain you as a
[2:34:52] prophet to the
[2:34:59] Nations you have to realize the
[2:35:02] realization there is a prophecy over you
[2:35:06] there is a blessing pronounced over you
[2:35:09] there is an assignment you have to
[2:35:12] do and who can keep you from falling
[2:35:17] unless you come to your assignment you
[2:35:20] are not yet
[2:35:22] finished now I cannot know what is
[2:35:25] loading in your
[2:35:27] mind probably it is a
[2:35:31] frustration because many gods have come
[2:35:34] in we let down the
[2:35:38] bars and the gods came in you see we are
[2:35:42] seeing many things happening in the
[2:35:44] message it used to be
[2:35:47] I mean I don't know about here but in
[2:35:50] Uganda in ' 80s and ' 90s it used to be
[2:35:55] when they would tell you that somebody
[2:35:57] received the message you wouldn't rest
[2:36:00] until you go and see
[2:36:03] him and when you would meet him it would
[2:36:06] be love love
[2:36:10] love but things
[2:36:12] changed today when you hear about
[2:36:15] message believer
[2:36:17] it is is there thunder
[2:36:19] group is Holy Ghost is there crowd
[2:36:28] something when you are seeking shelter
[2:36:30] and you look
[2:36:32] around then you know that is not your
[2:36:35] group you make sure you curate your
[2:36:39] words and you go it wasn't so from the
[2:36:44] beginning
[2:36:47] yes but remember this he who can keep us
[2:36:51] from
[2:36:52] falling will present to himself a bride
[2:36:57] without Sport and without
[2:37:00] wrinkle do you love him may God bless
[2:37:05] you as the pastor
[2:37:13] comes and this to be my last sermon in

[2:37:58] am just can't uh can't can't go away
[2:38:02] from your home your family and not miss
[2:38:04] them and we know that's the desire in
[2:38:07] the heart of every True Believer there's
[2:38:09] a longing for a place that we've never
[2:38:11] been
[2:38:13] to but we know what's home
[2:38:16] maybe just bow with me as we go to him
[2:38:18] in prayer this
[2:38:19] morning gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[2:38:22] know this morning that we've gathered
[2:38:24] together in your
[2:38:26] name We've Come To Worship You father
[2:38:29] we've come to hear from you Lord and
[2:38:32] father now it's up to us to determine
[2:38:34] those words that we heard today were
[2:38:36] they words of a
[2:38:37] man or were they your
[2:38:40] words and if they're your words then
[2:38:43] father we have the opportunity to leave
[2:38:46] this building changed
[2:38:48] people and we know that if we reject the
[2:38:51] word then we still will change because
[2:38:53] we don't ever remain the same and we
[2:38:56] know there's only one thing that does
[2:38:58] remain the same and that's you father
[2:38:59] that's your word and we know that your
[2:39:02] word you esteem it higher than your very
[2:39:05] name and father we're so thankful that
[2:39:07] you have given us the ability to
[2:39:09] recognize that while the entire world
[2:39:12] thinks they're having a Revival Lord the
[2:39:15] Revival they think they're having is
[2:39:18] gone but there is a Revival and that's
[2:39:21] the bride's Revival that's your very
[2:39:23] life living out through your bride your
[2:39:27] heart pumping inside of her expressing
[2:39:30] your very life Lord Jesus father this
[2:39:33] morning we we just ask that you would
[2:39:35] take the words that were spoken and and
[2:39:37] just water them Father as we leave this
[2:39:39] building that we wouldn't just dismiss
[2:39:41] it and say that you know that was a
[2:39:43] great service and just go on our way but
[2:39:45] Lord that we would take it and and and
[2:39:47] maybe even go back and watch it again
[2:39:49] and and realize that you were telling us
[2:39:51] something father that you have done it
[2:39:53] all from the very beginning Lord you
[2:39:55] chose us in you before the foundation of
[2:39:58] the world Lord to be expressed here
[2:40:00] today in this age oh Father not so we
[2:40:03] would be crushed so that we would be
[2:40:05] redeemed father Lord that we could
[2:40:07] overcome by the blood of the Lamb by
[2:40:10] your very blood that you bowed your head
[2:40:12] and died oh father while you waited for
[2:40:14] that last sinner to admit that he was a
[2:40:17] sinner father then you said it's time oh
