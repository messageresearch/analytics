the update of information about the retief family terrible to go through what they're going through but we're thankful that we have a promise we know that God saw fit to take brother Gideon home many times we don't understand but he didn't ask us to he asked us to believe I just want to pray for the retief family and sister Kathy for a speedy recovery and uh we just want to remember Sister Janet while she's traveling I believe brother Mervin he's in Texas tonight and next week he'll be in Finland for work the livesies will be traveling to South Africa very soon as well if you have a need maybe just make it known unto him with an uplift hand tonight gracious Heavenly Father what an honor and a privilege it is to come before you Lord Jesus as sons and daughters to present ourselves before you Lord knowing that there's only one way that we could ever do that Lord and that's not on our own accord it's because you've called us Lord Jesus and your word says that if we judge ourselves then we should not be judged and tonight father we step into the the presence of the king of kings and Lord of lords and we judge ourselves before you father according to your word and we just ask Lord Jesus if there's anything in our hearts Lord that would hinder you from having the full preeminence Lord from being the Lord Of Our Lives father we pray that you would just Purge it from us now that you would forgive us for it Lord that you would help us to recognize it Lord Jesus and fix it so that you could truly reign in our lives Lord father we want you to be Lord we don't want it to be something that we just say we want you to be the Lord Of Our Lives Lord the Lord of our businesses the Lord of our education the Lord of our families the Lord of our very hearts Lord Jesus father we want you to have dominion father tonight we just pray for the retief family we just ask that you would touch sister Kathy Lord and the entire family Lord Jesus who hearts are broken Lord father the family and the friends the congregation Lord we know what that feels like Lord Jesus and we don't understand why you would take a good pastor home father but we know we don't have to understand it we just have to trust you father that it's for your purpose Lord so father we just pray that as they take the next steps that you would just lead them and guide them Father that you would give them wisdom and discernment Lord she would help them to understand father what your direction is what your will is in the situation pray that you would touch sister Kathy father that you would take away the pain that you would lead her through this trial father Lord Jesus we just want to remember those who will be traveling Lord Sister Janet who is away traveling we pray that you would just keep your hand upon her Lord father bring her home safely at the appointed Time Lord we miss her and we know her family misses her Lord father we pray that you Beth brother Mervin while he's away Lord Jesus that you would just continue to anoint Him Father to be the Joseph for his company Lord father that you would just give him wisdom and discernment Lord that you would bring him back at the appointed time safely father oh Jesus we just asked that you would be with the livesies as they prepare to go father that you would give them traveling mercies Lord that you would just allow them to have smooth travels connections and everything would just happen father smoothly for them and Lord we pray that you would just bless their time away we just ask now father that you would do something special in this service tonight father Lord when I asked Lord I Saw many hands raised to you tonight father there's many needs in our midst Lord Jesus and father every one of us have a need Lord whether we raised our hands or we didn't father and Lord we just commit those needs into your hands and we pray that sovereignly that you would speak to us Lord to each and every need father that when we leave here tonight we would say we truly heard from heaven we truly heard from God we didn't just gather together as an assembly of people but we gathered together in the presence of the most high God oh Father we love you and we thank you we just ask all these things now in the name above every name the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you musicians tonight do you have your Bibles I would just like to go back to Ephesians chapter five Ephesians chapter 5. and uh I hope it's not getting to be old and boring some might say we've heard it and heard it and heard it but uh I don't think it'll ever get old and the more it becomes real to us it'll never get boring Ephesians chapter five just want to read two scriptures verse 21 and 22 tonight submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord it's amazing how I don't have a cough until I stand right here my let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness to us Lord thank you for your word Lord Jesus we know that it will never become old or boring to us Lord we pray that father every time we read it that you would just anoint our eyes father that you would anoint our hearts Lord Jesus father that you would just take those ears that have the ability to hear what the spirit saith unto the church father and just Lord Jesus speak to us once again through those years father we love you and we thank you we ask that you would break this bread of life to us fresh once again in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I think it's amazing I just want to talk tonight about submitting I want to talk about headship and how important it is to be able to do that and I really want to emphasize Ephesians 5 verse 21. because we can really um I've said it before but I'll say it again we can really emphasize and and stick on one thing and say that you know it's the wife's responsibility to fully submit and surrender her will to her husband which it is but we can make that the doctrine when that's not entirely it there's a balance in the word I remember a long time ago we talked about there being a way a highway but there's also a way and that way is of Holiness and the only way we're going to do that is to have the anointing of the word the anointing of the Lord the Holy Ghost in our lives and this world is not set up in such a way where we are supposed to submit ourselves submit our will surrender our will to a headship we are in fact encouraged to be independent from a very early age to be able to make the choice and in fact that choice is slowly being taken away from us in the public school systems all over North America and even in the world we can become criminals for telling our children that no you don't have a choice no you cannot choose God created you to be either a man or to be a woman and it's not a choice to decide whether you want to be one or the other other but you know what from a child young young ages now the world is setting things in order so that there's no choice there's no submission your choice is the choice it's so opposite to the word because this verse 21 says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of the Lord I pray for me maybe I should talk more at home or something I don't understand this it's bizarre we had conversation all day today and I wasn't coughing I love it devil doesn't like this supposed to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God first then wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands is unto the Lord and we're going to talk about that naturally tonight and how important it is for a wife to submit herself unto her husband that is truly the scripture and that is truly where the blessing lies for the wife and and being able to do that but also from the spiritual context if we call ourselves the Bride of Jesus Christ and really we ought to submit ourselves unto the Lord and and we'll get into that too there's scriptures after scripture that talks about submitting yourself unto the Lord but if wives are supposed to submit themselves unto their own husbands as unto the Lord what is the husband supposed to do as the Bride of Jesus Christ I just think we've been talking about it and I can't get away from the thought that all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church or into the bride and so what ought we to do as husbands we ought to pour all that we are into our families into our bride and then all of the wife ought to pour all that she is into her family as well into the position that she owns in in the role as well and then same with the children children have a role to play children ought to take that same example and pour all that they are into the family roles and and just see what God will do if we can actually push ourselves into the position of submitting ourselves one to another in the fear of God recognizing that God is the one that we're looking at we're not necessarily looking at our our family even though we are we're not necessarily looking at our husband or our wife we're looking to God because he is the author and the finisher of our faith he is the one that's watching us we we know the word says that he has set up Watchers in the world and I would say this way they're angels Angels amongst us people witnessing us I remember there was a time in my life where I think you know maybe I'm crazy but I I am in my own way I think we all are in our own way but maybe some like me more than others but there was a time in my life where somebody dropped some money in my store they dropped some money in my store I think it was a 20 bill and it was an accident I think I don't know maybe it was a test but they dropped the money and I I was a complete unbeliever at the time I believe I still had a little bit of faith maybe from when I was a kid that there was a god somewhere somehow but he dropped some money on the floor and I thought bonus he walked out of the store he was gone down the mall and and I thought there's lunch and coffee what a nice guy I was very nice of him so I went and I picked it up and I put it in my pocket and I went back to work an hour and a half later two hours later the same guy came back in and said you know did I drop anything in here and and what did I say to him I said no no he didn't I don't know did you I don't know I didn't see anything and he said you sure you sure I didn't you know was that was that a normal human was that a man sure it was but what was that that was a test for me and even now I can look at that and think you know by rights I'm condemned by that if I saw that man again today I'd give him 50 bucks I'd give him 100 bucks right and say truly I did that and I'm sorry but I don't know where he's at there's no way that I can fix that but what my point is is the word of God says that we entertain angels unawares we don't know when we entertain other beings so how does that tie in when we're not submitting ourselves it can be quite apparent can't it and you know there's so many different levels of submission that we can get into but um last week we talked about headship and I think it's such an important discussion that we really have to talk about there has to be willingness to submit ourselves to a headship and and every one of us in the fear of God submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God we all have got to be led we we cannot live in this world and not be led we come into the world being led and we go out of the world being led brother Branham talks about that but in between we're always led the word of God says to submit yourselves to governments to to rulers over you to to spiritual leadership to family members husbands wives submit yourselves to your husbands but you know this isn't something that's really new to us we're we're very familiar with this and I know maybe it can seem that way but tonight I just want to just do maybe a little bit of a refresher for kind of where we we were with it in the beginning it's such an important topic to remember we have to be willing to be led if we can't be led then how are we ever going to get to heaven because Christ is the one that actually came and gave his life for us he came and led us to the father he's the one that gave us that and then you know we can just fast forward to our our time we talked about it before I think it was on Sunday about how there's prophets that come into the world and how prophets they they utter the words of God and they have prophecy and it might take a day it might take a week it might take a century but that word will always come to pass that word will never ever fall short but how we have in our day had a visitation of an Angel messenger and that word has come through this man and people can choose to submit themselves to that leadership or they can say oh it's just a man it's just just some guy from Kentucky and you know he was a great man of God even if you look it up in Wikipedia or or online Google a great man of God he had a tremendous Healing Ministry but you know he went off the rails when he started to say I am my father are one right when when something happened on Sunset mountain when the seals were open nobody else had ever had the seals open nobody ever clearly declared that the seals were completely open until this man and when this man did it that's when the world stepped back and said oh no no no you know what we we love the fact that you heal people we love the fact that you're you're so kind and compassionate you can discern and you can help people you're good and kind to people the the the man of godness is tremendous in you but you know when you go and make yourself God that's that's when we have to draw the line that's where we're going to pick up stones and stone you it was the same thing with Jesus when he came it's just a man we know your parents Joseph and Joseph and Mary we know your aunts we know your uncles we we know who you were before this great ministry how could you be that guy we have got to be willing to understand the word of God and follow it but this goes back to Genesis chapter 3 talking about the feminine the church the feminine the wife tonight in Genesis chapter 3 verse 16 unto the woman after everything happened in the garden very familiar scripture onto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee those are searing words for today that that that that right there sums it up for the Christian Life but the world today would say that's terribly wrong that's terribly inappropriate that might even be hate speech to say that a husband should rule over his wife but you know just like there's been many false prophets that have gone out in the world there's been many false prophets that have gone out and manipulated the word of God for whatever purpose usually for gain usually for their own purpose we know it's the act of Satan that gets in just because there's false prophets doesn't mean there's not true just like there's husbands that have behaved misbehaved I'll say inappropriately and mistreated their wives it doesn't mean that there isn't husbands that recognize that she is part of him and his Queen and treats her with utmost respect according to the word of God doesn't mean that there isn't true husbands out there like that the word of God has never once said to mistreat a woman never never it's a false representation of a human being on Earth that does that and that's why it became such a fear for females and and that's why it is today even tonight but we know in Genesis 3 24 just going forwards here see so he drove the man and placed at the east of the Garden Eden cherubims and a flaming sword to turn every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life they were banished from the garden there because of their sin because of the Fall because Adam chose to follow the leadership of his wife instead of following the right leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ instead of submitting himself to the word of God for his day he chose another Avenue and it caused the fall we know that he wasn't deceived he chose that direction but the woman was deceived and if we take that and apply that to the church look at how easily we will be deceived we know we've said it so many times that it would be so close it would deceive the very elected if it were possible who was the very elected tonight the bride the female the feminine so close that she would be deceived if it were possible but it's not possible how is it not possible only by the Holy Ghost outside of the Holy Ghost in your life brothers and sisters you'll be deceived you'll follow some other leadership there will be some other thing that will take you and just be off just a little bit today it'll just be so close it'll just be a little bit today but 10 years down the road it's going to be 10 miles off the course right now as we walk we sow seeds and it might not seem like a big deal today to stay home from church with our kids we don't have to go to church on a Wednesday night you don't but your kids 10 years from now are going to say remember we didn't go to church on Wednesday night it wasn't important we could just press play and listen to a tape and then what we open doors that we can't close and we start to behave in ways that are outside of the leadership of the word for our day we have to follow the leadership of the word but I just think it's so beautiful that he drove them out of the garden he he gave them no more access to that tree of life but we have been given Total Access to that tree of life if we don't actually go back to that Garden of Eden experience ourselves through the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's death to us to them if they would have gone to it it would have been death to them at that time today to not do it is death brother Branham talks about headship in Christ The Mystery of God revealed in so many ways if you ever want to listen to it or or just look it up he says it over and over and over again in Christ is the mystery of God revealed I'm just going to read a few tonight for for time's sake and and just sort of weave in and out here but how important it is to understand headship that we have got to be willing to be led you know Cain was not willing to be led Cain was a Believer brother Branham said Cain worship just like Abel they both were trained by their parents they both probably went to a message Church they were raised up right but there was something enable and something not in Cain Cain was not able to follow the leadership of the Lord he wasn't able to submit to the word of God and we know that was the difference between the two of them they both were sincere they both were Believers brother Branham said can you believe it Cain was a believer my goodness but yet when God came and brought him correction God came and spoke to him personally like your brother it was that Pride that was in him and that's what holds people back today from being able to be led and you know even from having a pastor or even from having a headship in the home when there's something inside of a wife that just doesn't want to listen to their husband there's something in there that's not right and you know that's not to say that that person isn't saved or that person isn't truly a believer it's just that they haven't come to the place of maturity yet in their lives same thing with a husband if a husband isn't following the Lord all the way it's not necessarily because he's lost or because he's not saved maybe he just hasn't spent enough time in prayer recently maybe he just hasn't done the right things hasn't read the Bible enough maybe he is just on his journey and not fully mature yet that's why we say it and we'll say it and say it and say it especially for those people who might be looking to get married know that you have the Holy Ghost know that your spouse potential has the Holy Ghost don't wait don't guess don't think they're going to get it down the road because if they don't have it when you get buried my goodness they might drag you down I've heard it worded this way to actually get married to the wrong person on earth is Hell on Earth that is a terrible situation brothers and sisters because you can't undo it brother Branham says it when you marry a person it doesn't matter whether she leaves you or whether you leave her you're married till you die can't have any other head it's got to be one it's got to be the lord it's got to be the Holy Ghost that's the only way that we can be led in this life and it's absolutely contrary to all of this world's teaching all of it the critical thinking that's taught even from the from the youth you can choose how you want to behave you can choose how you want to identify that's fine well it's not it's not according to the word brother Adam in Christ the mystery he says now you see the seals when he was in his meditorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed I don't understand it excuse me and all that's in this book would be him I just was reading this and I was just stunned by that all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him in Ephesians 5 he says it the twain shall be won this is the mystery that I speak to you about Christ in the church that's the mystery Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says and and all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in it he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb and here he is today in his word I want to say it tonight here he is tonight in his word when we read these quotes we can look back and say well that was 1963 brother Barry yeah it was but he is the same yesterday today and forever he is here tonight when we say that today we mean tonight he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there she can't recognize another headship no sir there's no Bishop no nothing she recognizes one headship that's Christ and Christ is the word he says oh my woo I love that yes um yes sir he's enthused by that and and I just think it's so beautiful to take this and just sort of unpack it a little bit and think about it how she is him he is the word but she is him also the twain are one so she will only recognize one headship and that one headship is him his word and what does his word say about submitting and falling under the leadership it says submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God we read that scripture to start with tonight wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands that's what that's what the word of God says it's not conditional we talked about this we're having a conversation today about it Lisa myself you know what it's not conditional I just about fell off my chair when I heard brother Ken teach that it's not a conditional thing if the husband isn't in his position that doesn't give the rule the wife license to act out and say well my husband's not behaving right so I can just do what I want to do nope if this if the wife wants to see success if she wants to see her husband get corrected the best thing she can do is remain in her position and say Lord I'm in my position and I believe your word with all my heart and I expect fact that you'll come on the scene and deal with the situation and you know what God will if he is a Son of God he truly will and I personally believe this even if he's not a son of God will still come on the scene God will still come on the scene here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there we can look back and say well brother Barry we're not talking about signs wonders and miracles you know we can pray for this sick and they'll be healed and we'll have prayer lines and all these different things will happen and we'll see God answer our prayers the way that we want to see them answer that's all he's talking about here I know it's dangerous ground to say that that's not what the prophet's saying but I personally believe that that's my view that's not what he's saying what he's saying is you're able to stay with the word that is what he's saying here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there she can't recognize another headship no sure no sir there's no Bishop no nothing she recognizes one headship that's Christ and Christ is the word following the message of the hour the message of the hour is the magnifying glass over top of the word we've heard it said many times that is the explanation of the word and we know that Christ The Mystery of God revealed is such a tremendous message but to talk about headship and understanding that really the only success we're going to have brothers and sisters in our lives is to fall into our positions to be in our positions in our positions that's where God's going to use us that is where he's going to purge the branch and you know what when he purges the branch and we have fruit he he wants more fruit he doesn't want just one batch of fruit he wants to continually Purge the branch to bring more fruit and you know what he says in his word we read that in John 15 maybe we'll go back to it tonight but it's kind of what we're doing on Sundays but it just dovetails together because he is glorified in the fruit that you bear the only way that's going to happen is for us to be in our position though to be able to allow that life to flow through us when we're out of our position that life isn't going to flow through us it's going to be disjointed you can't take a branch and bend it off a tree and have one little tiny piece of it hanging onto the tree it's going to die it's going to wither up it's still attached to the tree but the majority of that life isn't coming through and that's what happens to a Believer when we peel ourselves away from the word of God it's not about being in an assembly it's about following the word of God in our lives and when we're in our positions that Branch remains intact it doesn't matter if it gets broken further down the branch many times in our lives our branches will get broken but that Branch will still bring forth fruit it will still bring forth life we know brother Branham talks about it that the branch that's grafted in has never going to be able we'll never be able to Bear the fruit of the original vine but if that original vine ever brings forth another Branch brother Branham said it very clearly then it will be that original Fruit mm-hmm we can't have any other headship brother Brown goes on to say this he says as the head was took up from the grave I just love this as the head was took up from the grave so must his body follow him into Eden therefore the body cannot recognize any other headship but the headship of the word this is such a beautiful thought isn't it in our lives in our homes I want to say this wives brother Bradham said it very clearly if you want to see if someone's on the word give them the word test give it the word test wives maybe I'm stepping on toes and I apologize maybe I shouldn't do this but I'm going to do it anyway I just feel led two wives test your husbands give them the word test see if he's in his position and husbands give your word wives the word test give your children the word test children give your parents the word test we should be able to do it as a family and not get offended and recognize that hey you know what we might have a weakness we might have a blind spot that we just don't see we just don't know about God will use our children to talk to us God will use our spouse to speak to us don't ever discount that for a second I think it's such an amazing thing we had a conversation one time and I'm sure whoever said it will know what I'm talking about but you know we've been given a spouse for a reason and that reason is so that we can actually have conversations in an intellectual way because we know that the woman we're going to get into that a little bit tonight if we have time the woman was taken from the man brother Branham calls her a byproduct and I don't mean that I don't think that he he means in such a way that she's just like the the piece of something that's left over that you know God just created just and had some leftovers that's not at all she came from the man he did not pull up dust brother Branham said and create the woman she took the woman he took the woman out of the man sometimes we need to give each other the word test our wives can speak to us the word of God we've been given the ability to know each other in a way that nobody else will ever know us and that is an example of the mystery that Paul talked about in Ephesians chapter 5. we need to have that relationship where we we can speak and and he will know what we're talking about uh our our wives can speak and the husbands can can finish the sentence when we're talking we know what the other one means you get to know one another that well sometimes you can actually know what the other one's thinking just by sitting there and and someone will say something and the other one will say well I was just thinking about that how did you know that get out of my head we've had that conversation how does that happen you get to know one another you get to know one another on a level that's different it's the same thing with the spirit of God in our lives but you know our wives have been given to us for a purpose and that purpose is is to complete us and and we know that the woman was taken out of the man the feminist was taken out of the masculine and and the twain were actually two were actually one originally they were created as one both male and female created him they is what it says in the in the Book of Genesis but talking about this we we have been given the ability to have a conversation with that person that knows us that well so that we can actually reason things out in our lives sometimes we need to be able to have those conversations with the other party and and it can be with children and parents I think it's one of the most important things as a parent to make sure that we have the relationships with our children so our children feel safe to come and talk to us about what these kids at school are doing because if they can't come and talk to the parents out of fear because there's no relationship there who are they going to talk to where are they going to get their education from who is going to be leading our children we've got to be willing to have those those relationships in our lives and that takes work you know what it takes it takes humility it takes the ability to say no I'm wrong no I've made a mistake I am in error and I'm sorry please forgive me we have to be willing to Humble ourselves in order to be able to submit in order to have a a headship in our lives brother banham says as the head was take up from the grave so must his body follow him into Eden therefore the body cannot recognize any other headship but the headship of the word no denomination can put anything to it for whosoever shall take one word away from it or add one word to it they've took away from it they're dead he says you're dead hybrid right there and so many times we can see that that's what the world has done that's what denominations have done they've added to or they've taken away and sometimes I think some of that can actually come over into the message to people who who maybe come out of being a Baptist maybe my parents were Baptists maybe my parents were Pentecostals maybe they were methodists maybe they had this family tradition maybe it was a certain way those things can just drag over into the message and after a while it can just seem to be a part of the message but if you can't find that behavior in the message then I would suggest that we just leave it alone we just put it off to the side and say no that that that might not be according to the word of God because I want the headship of the word is what brother Branham says they can only be one headship for the Bride of Jesus Christ so that's the headship of the word and the word for our day is really what we're after the word for our day it's not a new word it's not the Bible plus it's it's not brother Branham writing a book and saying that this is in addition to the Bible what it is and is an explanation of the Bible and pointing back to the Bible in so much that he recognized that he needed headship as well that he said if you can't take my word for it then take his word for it take the Bible for it how many other prophets out there in the world so-called have said that if you can't take my word for it take the Bible for it they don't do that that's what causes false prophets as they do their own addendum to it they add to it and they take away from it exactly what we've heard here and that's what causes people to get grossed out and so in our families if we add to or take away from it causes fusion in our homes that causes confusion in our relationships we cannot take tradition and say well it's just always the way we've done it we've just done it this way no as we near that that that that that that Capstone as we get to that place that's at the very top of the pyramid where it's Christ there's only going to be one Capstone and that Capstone is Christ himself the word that's what we're reading Christ is the mystery of God revealed look up headship in Christ The Mystery of God revealed and you'll see him he goes on to say he the word how do you know it's right he the word is Vindicated see how many of us here tonight have not seen the word Vindicated in any way in your life I wouldn't expect to see any hat but how many here have seen the word Vindicated in some way in your life everyone has so we can't say that God hasn't Vindicated his own word maybe we don't see the great prayer lines and the and the all the signs and wonders in our lives but we're not supposed to that was for another age brothers and sisters that was the bait on the hook to get the attention of the people to take a look at what God was doing through his prophet and what he was doing was sending his Prophet to call out a bride of his own choosing and he's done that but we're so thankful that he's still doing that tonight he's still calling he the word how do you know it's right he the word is Vindicated see and it has to be Vindicated personally it's got to be made personal to us we know that's what the new birth is Christ revealing himself making himself known personally to the individual and when that happens brothers and sisters when that truly happens then full humility full submission to the word of God is what follows there's no Cain Spirit where the person says oh I can only go this far you know I think it's all good but except for that that's not true new birth that's not a new birth that's maybe a conversion that's maybe someone who is conforming to a list of Standards that's what denominationalism is that's justification and sanctification but it's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it can even be an anointing of the Holy Ghost at times in our lives which makes it so treacherous but when we truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our lives that it's complete submission total humility unto the word of God that's when we can submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God and that is the beginning of it all I believe my myself I think that's the most critical part to it is being able to submit ourselves one to another in the fear of God maybe we bitterly disagree but we'll always come together and shake hands and say God bless you in the end and and not have something in our hearts you know John 10 37 if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though you believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him and we know this is the story where they picked up stones to Stone him and he said why wherefore are you trying to stole me why are you trying to take me out here why are you doing this to me and they say well we love you and we love your Mighty signs and and wonderful Miracles and works but you know what's it's that you just go and you call yourself God and we just can't deal with that we call that blasphemy and he says to him you know if you can't believe me just believe the works that I do how could any human being ever do this on his own if it weren't for God brother Branham goes on to say he the word properly Vindicated is the headship the properly Vindicated word is the headship that is the Capstone the properly Vindicated word in our lives is the headship and brothers and sisters I want to say tonight everybody knows this but being in your position and properly vindicating your position according to the word of God is headship that is according to the word of God he the word properly Vindicated is headship the head of the church he is the word the headship he's properly identified identified Vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person I love that because he doesn't say just the church itself just the great church the mystical body of Jesus Christ Somewhere Out There untangible the person the person showing forth himself in vindication is the direct proof to the entire body you know we can say it Satan wants to say no you don't got it you're not you're not there no you're not there maybe it's not real you haven't seen Mighty signs and wonders in your life maybe once upon a time the flame was lit and now it's gone out it's just he wants us to give up but you know what it's not about emotion and it's not about our feelings all of that has absolutely nothing to do with it brother Branham says it's the word it's the person himself showing forth the Vindication that you believe this word of God and it doesn't really matter what comes or goes who comes or goes what happens you still believe this word of God it is Vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person showing forth himself in Vindication is the direct proof to the entire body you believe the word of God you don't need Creeds then you don't need Creeds then denominations has perished but the headship itself recognized in the body by personal identifications not who I want to be but I sure ain't who I used to be I'm sure that every one of us can say that brothers and sisters we're maybe not exactly that Perfect Image that we have in our mind but you know I want to say this that probably in in our mind we're never going to attain that Perfect Image because of this hybrid flesh condition that we're in but that doesn't change what the word of God says our ability to receive this word demonstrates headship in our lives it demonstrates the authority of God being Lord Jesus Christ in our lives and we know many people in this world they'll declare Jesus Christ all day long they'll say the blood of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ they'll say it they'll say it they'll live it they have fantastic lives maybe many even signs and wonders in their lives in their churches but boy when you start saying Lord Lord Jesus Christ oh the Lord says don't cut your hair oh the Lord says don't wear a garment that pertains to a man the Lord says to go to church my when you start talking about that the Lord says I'll send you a prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord it gets to be a bit much for people but we're not talking about signs and wonders it's about the identification of the word to us personally in our own lives and when that happens nobody's ever going to take it away from us because nobody's ever talked us into it if someone could talk you into it they could talk you out of it you don't need Creeds then the nomination says perished but the headship itself recognized in the body by personal identifications see identifying himself in Brackets proves the headship to the body he identifies himself to us day by day and you know we just need to look around and give them the opportunity to to to express himself to us and through us we can look everywhere we look isn't it amazing in this world every single place you look you see God when you've had that experience you look at the sunrise in the morning and you think my that's from him and you look at the Sunset and you think another one from him you look at the trees and you look at the grass you look at the animals you look at the humans you look at the families you look at everything all of creation around us is is him everywhere we look he's identifying himself proves the headship to the body then we are united under one Vindicated headship that is Christ the word of God not under any church then our headship is a kingdom looking at the uh the message of the hour many times we could say well he Vindicated himself through the prophet but how does he vindicate himself through me how does this become me where do I see the Vindication of the word the Vindication of the word for us brothers and sisters isn't necessarily signs and wonders although they will follow if you believe for any period of time you will see signs and wonders if you believe this word you will it's inevitable you cannot separate the two but they follow they don't lead but you know our our our headship our submission is absolutely in the word of God Alone being able to submit ourselves to the word and that word is a kingdom talking about submission tonight I'm gonna have to speed up here you know the story of Esther I think it's such an amazing story when you look at it and uh you don't have to turn there tonight but we I'll just cover a couple quick things here I just wanted to take something from a little bit of a different angle from that story the story of Esther we know that you know there was a queen in the land and and the King he got what he wanted that's just the way it works in in that time in that place when the king said something it happened and that's all there was to it and if it didn't happen there was a problem there was a repercussion to pay and the queen that he had she got comfortable in her position and she thought she had Authority when really the only Authority she had was what the king gave her the only position she had was what that King gave her but she got puffed up inside herself and said hey I I deserve something because I'm the queen she got lifted up in her heart Pride looked look look looked up in her heart and you know what happened they said you know well just get rid of her we'll just find another one and we know it was all for a purpose and and that's not really what I want to preach on tonight but what I want to say is that Esther when when she came in to the situation she had to be strong in her position she recognized that if you approach the king unannounced it meant death that that was the law in in the time and she wasn't invited in to see the king but there was a decree that went forward it was a trap we know that they were uh more uh Heyman was looking to kill the Jews all of this was happening for the purpose of of of her coming to herself in her position as the queen but she had to be strong in this position and being strong in her position didn't mean that she actually rolled up her sleeves and and she she got her Posse with her and she went right into the presence of the king and she told him this has happened and someone has made a decree and and he's trying to kill all of our our people and and she had a very specific way of doing it there was only one way that she could do it in her heart and that was to be humble in her heart even though she was fully right in her in her in her behavior because she knew that it was her people that was gonna die but to think about the difference between the two queens one of them was puffed up with pride in her heart vashti would have stomped her way right into the presence of the king and probably wagged her finger in his nose and told him but something was in the heart of Esther that just couldn't do it she had something else there was something in her she was willing to submit herself unto the king's headship unto his leadership she had submission in her heart it's just an interesting thing to think about she knew that it meant certain death but she conducted herself as a queen in the position and I just think you know how often we can do that in our own lives as husbands we can say you know I'm right in my position and I know this situation is wrong and I can go to God with it and say I demand something or I can go to him with reverence and I can go to him with submission but you know I I think it's so important to recognize brothers and sisters many times I think we go to God many times without realizing that we're going to God and if you're wondering what I'm talking about I'm saying when we talk to one another if we've got the Holy Ghost in one another if we got the Holy Ghost In Our Lives when we talk to our brother when we talk to our sister who are we talking to we should have reverence in our hearts reverence in our our minds when we have the conversations within the Bible study we're talking about it how did those 42 kids die back in Elijah's day brother Branham says it was the conversation of the parents that destroyed those children it was parental delinquency and it was directly related to the conversation around the dinner tables the conversation in the cars while the people were traveling around they were talking bad about the prophet they were talking bad about the pastor they were talking bad about the the word of God they were saying that you know it's just a man it's just a man how could it be we know who he is you know what happened it didn't turn out right for them but what we're saying here tonight is there needs to be a reverence there needs to be a submission the word of God we read it in in verse 21 I believe of Ephesians chapter 5 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God recognizing that if we are Sons and Daughters of God this goes much deeper than recognizing thinking that we're just a body of Believers and it's just you know brother so and so on sister so and so it's it's God Almighty in flesh it's it's if they believe this word of God this is the word of God standing before us in flesh and and husbands and wives and children and parents we're in a place that's different than any other age has ever encountered this is a just like we've talked about the children of Israel crossing over Jordan you know you got to keep your eyes on that word when the Levites get up and march across keep a certain distance so you can see exactly the way that they go because if you miss what's going on nobody's ever gone this way before we need to make sure that we recognize it the only way we're going to do that is to have full submission to the headship of the lord we could close right now but we're not gonna full submission to the headship of the Lord that's it brothers and sisters and how do we do that get in your position husbands love your wives wives submit yourselves to your husbands children obey your parents that's how it happens understanding that the word of God takes precedence in our lives Colossians 3 17 and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him my wife has to pick up another glass that I've left laying around she can growl at me or she can do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus and I'm not saying that she growls at me I'm just just giving an example and I'm making it about me I'm not making it about anybody else many times we can do things and we can Grumble about it because the situation it's over and over and over and over and over and over and I thought that by now they would stop doing what they're doing but they just keep doing it and God just keeps letting them do it they just keep doing it over and over and over it's got nothing to do with you I mean it's got nothing to do with them it's got everything to do with you it's all about our heart we need to do it in the fear of God and whatsoever you do in word or tea do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks to God and the father by him wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it's fit in the Lord husbands love your wives be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the Lord fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged servants obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh I just love that one because I would say that servants today is employees obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh not with eye Service as men Pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God and and 23 it's like a sandwich of it it's just so beautiful and whatsoever ye do do it heartily as unto the Lord and not unto men children when you're doing school work do it heartily as unto the Lord and not unto men employees when you're working do it heartily as unto the Lord not unto men husbands when you love your wives do it heartily as unto the Lord not as unto men or your wives wives when you submit to your husbands sometimes it can be hard maybe but do it heartily as unto the Lord Hebrews 13 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch over your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you and I know some who know the scripture might say brother Barry that's talking about the the keepers of the house of the Lord that's talking about the ministry and indeed it is but who is the husband in the home he's the one that's going to give a full account for his family God's not going to go to the wife and say what did you do remember we talked about it he didn't come down and ask Eve Eve where are you he knew where she was but he came down and talked to Adam he didn't tell Eve don't you eat of that tree he told Adam don't you eat of that tree and Adam told his wife obey them that have the rule over you remember we talked about it back in the Garden of Eden he shall rule over you he shall rule over you but he's also going to give a full accounting for his behavior and how he led his family that's what's going to happen the husband will James 4 6 but he that he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore unto God resist the devil and he will flee from you many times we read that scripture we'll just say that yeah submit yourselves therefore unto God resist the devil and heal free from you but remember that verse before it he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble remember brother Bradham said it I just think it's one of the most beautiful statements is that is that true Revelation it doesn't puff you up true Revelation it brings to light it shines a magnifying glass with a light on it about how simple we really are how desperately we really need the Lord in our lives every one of us be said that our lives our souls are hanging over Hell by a chain with a weak Link in it every one of us and it's just his grace that holds us there that keeps us from going in because every one of us born in sin shaped and iniquity come into the world speaking Lies We all deserve death but he giveth more grace God who is rich in Mercy he resists the proud but give us Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God right submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee from you if you've got the devil in your family if he's mixing it up if he's trying to come against your marriage if he's trying to come against your relationships with your children brothers and sisters submit yourselves therefore to God but remember he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he has to flee you don't have to accept them in your family in your marriage in your relationships the next verse says draw an eye unto God and he'll draw an eye unto you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up talking about the uh my goodness I won't get into that tonight just talking about the study that I've been getting into um I won't get into it tonight but you know we need to recognize that we need to Humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord that's the only way that he'll Lift us up if we puff ourselves up and say no I'm the husband nope I'm the wife and and the husband's out of position or children can look at their parents and say nope you're not serving God you're you're a double-minded you're talking about people around the dinner table and I know that you're not actually serving God he's not going to say I'll give you a pass on that he's going to say what about you and your position you know the word of God you have to follow that headship you've got to be willing to follow that leadership first Peter 2 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake some people will say well no I'm a free agent on the land I don't have to pay taxes I don't have to buy property I can do whatever I want to do there's all kinds of theories and ideas that are out there but this just brings it right down to where we live doesn't it submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake and we know that Jesus when he was here he held up the coin to the disciples and he said whose inscription is on that coin right there whose is that I said well it's it's Caesars and he said Render unto Caesar what's Caesar's right you make sure you do that you pay your taxes you make sure that you follow the laws you you follow the speed limits you do everything according to the word I say Lord help me I try and do it all according to the law I'm not interested in trying to do anything outside of it but I make mistakes sometimes my foot gets a little heavy on the gas pedal and you know things happen but I usually get spanked pretty hard I'll give you an example one time I was a deacon at the door real life example we were trying to get to church on time and if anybody has ever experienced this I'm not sure if you have but in our house it's always a struggle on Sunday to get to church on time it's not sometimes it's always same thing with Wednesday nights but you know this time was the time of all times and this time I was angry I had righteous indignation and so we were doing 140. and I got pinched he got me with the laser and you know I got pulled over and I I went from being proud and puffed up to being humbled real humbled because of the speeding ticket but also because of the people that were coming through the doors now they were saying was that you back there pulled over with the police and the only thing I could do is grip my teeth and smile and say yeah yeah God bless you but you know what he knows how to Humble you he knows exactly how to Humble us we're not going to get away with nothing brother Branham says it very clearly that you can sin you can do things you can step outside of the word but he will always correct you we will always be corrected submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto the governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of God that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men you follow the word of God you follow the laws of the land that's why it's real easy to see these other preachers who are out there trying to stir up trouble and and trying to make themselves martyrs follow the ordinances of the law that's all that's what the word of God says you don't have to try and stand out you already stand out if you believe the word of God you don't have to try and be a fanatic brother Branham even says it just go on be a good Christian just live a good Christian Life don't try and stand out don't try and be be different you're going to be different enough as it is first Peter 5 likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the Elder you get the theme Here submit submit yourselves and ultimately submit yourselves to the word the headship of the of the word likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility why because God resisteth the proud and he giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time sometimes in our lives we can be cast down we can be trodden we can be mistreated but God's waiting to see what we're going to do about it are we going to follow his word are we going to actually just be subjected to his word to the headship of the word in our lives or are we going to say no I'm I'm righteous in my position I know that I've I've I've done everything right in my life everything's perfect here you know what I I just think there's one quote I'm going to read in in closing I'll call the musicians for real now I'll close but you know I I just think this is so good when we can get this Revelation in our lives and and it's in many different levels and I'll say it this way um it can be in gifts that the Lord's placed in our lives sometimes we don't even know that we have a gift this is brother branham's out of led by the spirit of God in 1956. talking about the disciples and how they had the experience with God but they were given the word for their day which was their headship and and all they had to do was follow the word and and and and the headship would manifest like brother Bradham talked about it would just be Vindicated in their lives if they were willing to follow the word and and brother Bradham he says this and they climbed up in the upper room and stayed there cowardly the door was locked the windows were locked praying real low to themselves and hiding out from the Jews until the Holy Ghost fell on them he says there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind filled all the house where they were sitting cloven tongue set upon them like fire and Outdoors and windows both they went into the street led by the Holy Ghost just amazing contrast one moment they're afraid hiding and the next minute they're spilling out of the house they don't care it's beautiful he says led by the Holy Ghost sorry cloven tongue set upon them like fire and out the doors and windows both they went into the street led by the Holy Ghost and that fire what was kindled on that on the day of Pentecost is still struck our hearts from that day till this men that wants to be led by the Holy Spirit and that truly is what we're talking about tonight brothers and sisters there was a quote that I came across I didn't bring it tonight but brother Branham talks about the word of God in our lives but it's not just the word of God in our lives there has to be the quickening power of that word of God there has to be that that energy he says the word of God energizes that word to us and through us and when that happens there's nothing that's going to change us but the RAM goes on to say here if you're ready to be led by the Holy Spirit mind him obey him do what you can for him I just think this applies so well to our positions as husbands as wives as children as brothers and sisters as a congregation if you're ready to be led by the Holy Spirit mind him obey him do what he can for him when you see a place that you could be used let God use you in that he says do you believe that I just think it's so beautiful just let God use you at position brothers and sisters many times we don't have to get on an airplane and travel to a different country and go to a foreign land we've got a mission field right here we've got many things in our lives that we can change and see a great manifestation of the Vindication of the word just by getting into our position and seeing a need and doing something about it and I say Lord help me he shows me all the time many times I don't follow because of habit because of this flesh because of this life because because because why because what if I just make a change in my own life and just see the the Lord move and I've made changes in my own life and seen him move I'm just saying this to encourage us brothers and sisters sometimes just the smallest thing just the littlest change can make a great impact in our lives spiritually speaking we know the word says it's the little foxes that spoil the vine it's not the great big things out there it's just a little foxes brothers and sisters stand with me tonight as we close in prayer foreign gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight I believe that we are all ready to be led by the Holy Spirit father I believe that we all desire to see more of you in our lives Lord and I pray father for each one Lord that we could just make that room for you in our lives Lord Jesus that we could just maybe do a little house cleaning father that we could just make some adjustments Lord maybe like a little spring clean real early in the season and just clean out the stuff that needs to be cleaned out Lord Jesus just tidy up things that are maybe left laying around in our lives and and just give you the full preeminence Lord so that you can vindicate that word to us and through US Lord we know that the signs and wonders will follow and we're not interested in trying to put those out front what we want is the headship of the word in our lives father thank you for that word tonight Lord thank you for the leadership of your Holy Spirit In Our Lives Lord father tonight I pray for all those Lord Jesus who have taken the steps over the past few years to to follow your word Lord and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father I pray for each one who is desired to get the Holy Ghost father that you would just vindicate that you have given them the Holy Ghost father that you would just make yourself so real to each one tonight Lord father that there would be no question in the hearts of the children whether they have the Holy Spirit or not father Lord Jesus we know that's one of the tactics of the devil and we just thank you Father that you will always come where you're invited we know that you're a gentleman and and Lord tonight I pray that as husbands we could be a gentleman just like you father that we could just have the patience just like you father that we could have the humility just like you father that we could just be just like you in the word where
