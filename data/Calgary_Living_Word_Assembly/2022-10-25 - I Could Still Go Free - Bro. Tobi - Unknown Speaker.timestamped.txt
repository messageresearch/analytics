[0:01] God bless you and uh good evening I just
[0:05] have this song in my heart that's it's
[0:07] been a blessing to me and wanted to
[0:09] share with you
[0:11] um title that I could still go free and
[0:14] you know one um one part of the song
[0:17] says that
[0:19] what kind of a man will reach down with
[0:21] his his hand and do this for me
[0:24] unworthy to leave and not fit to kill
[0:28] and just that part just registered to me
[0:30] what kind of a man
[0:32] will tell me to go free after all I've
[0:35] done against him
[0:38] um it's just a blessing and I hope it
[0:40] will be a blessing to you as well
[0:45] [Music]
[1:01] you can
[1:03] lock me up

[1:11] and throw
[1:14] away
[1:16] the king
[1:22] take
[1:24] away
[1:26] the vision
[1:31] from these eyes that now
[1:35] now can see
[1:41] then
[1:43] deprive me of
[1:46] the food I eat
[1:51] and even
[1:54] buying my head
[1:57] s and feet
[2:00] for as
[2:02] long as I know Jesus
[2:08] does and he said
[2:12] I could steal
[2:14] Go free
[2:18] he said
[2:20] I could steal
[2:23] go free
[2:28] what kind of a man
[2:33] break down his hand
[2:37] and do this for me
[2:45] so
[2:51] unworthy to leave
[2:55] and not free to kill
[3:00] the man on the cross he had my name is
[3:07] will he said
[3:13] go free
[3:17] foreign
[3:24] [Music]
[3:52] and feel the pain of flesh flesh and
[3:58] Bone

[4:06] the glory
[4:08] path

[4:14] Calvary
[4:18] for those blood red stains broke all

[4:44] what kind of a man
[4:48] will return on his hand
[4:52] and do this for me
[5:00] foreign
[5:02] [Music]
[5:21] [Music]
[5:36] I'm free from the fears
[5:40] of tomorrow

[5:46] free from the guilt of
[5:49] my past

[5:55] my shackles for
[5:59] Glorious song I am free praise the Lord
