========================================
[Music] man it's good to be here I'm just on a training course and leaving tomorrow and just good to be in the house of the Lord amen once I stood in the night with my head thou Lord in the darkness as black has could be and my heart fell too long and I cried oh Lord don't hide your [Music] me like a king I may live in a palace oh so tall with great riches to call my own but I don't know a thing in this whole wide world that's worse [Music] hold my hand all the way every hour of every day from here to the great on Lord [Music] take my pants [Music] alone [Music] oh take my hand let me stand where no one stands alone [Music] [Applause]
