[5:39] &gt;&gt; [music]
[5:48] [music]
[5:58] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[6:01] [music]
[6:16] I leave [singing] for you
[6:19] alone
[6:21] every breath [music]
[6:22] that I take.
[6:24] Every moment I wait.
[6:28] Lord have you.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; One more time. Just a chorus. Oh Lord, I
[6:36] give you my heart.
[6:39] I give [singing and music] you my soul.
[6:44] I live for [singing and music] you
[6:48] alone.
[6:50] Every breath that I take, [music]
[6:54] every moment,
[6:59] Lord, have [music] your way.
[7:04] be. Amen. Amen. Welcome to church this
[7:07] evening. Last service of the year 2025.
[7:13] Thank you, sir.
[7:15] Id like us to read Psalm 103. Psalm 103
[7:18] before we start. Um, if you can project
[7:21] it so we can all read together. Uh, it's
[7:24] a bit lengthy, but it's the last service
[7:26] of the year. We're going nowhere.
[7:30] Psalm 103. We can read together from
[7:33] verse one. You good?
[7:39] Just give them a minute.
[7:53] Guess we have our Bibles, right? All
[7:55] right, we'll start. Bless the Lord, oh
[7:58] my soul, and all that is within me,
[8:01] bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh
[8:04] my soul, and forget not all his
[8:06] benefits. Who forgiveth all thine
[8:08] iniquities, who health all thy diseases,
[8:12] who redeemth thy life from destruction,
[8:15] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[8:17] and tender mercies, who satisfyth thy
[8:20] mouth with good things, so that thy
[8:22] youth is renewed like the eagles. The
[8:25] Lord executed righteousness and judgment
[8:26] [music]
[8:27] for all that are oppressed. He made
[8:29] known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto
[8:32] the children of Israel. The Lord is
[8:35] merciful and gracious, slow to anger and
[8:37] pen us in mercy. He will not always
[8:40] chide, neither will he keep his anger
[8:41] forever. He hath not dealt with us after
[8:44] our sins, nor rewarded us according to
[8:46] our iniquities. For as the heaven is
[8:48] high above the earth, so great is his
[8:50] mercy toward them that fear him. As far
[8:53] as the east is from the west, so far as
[8:55] he removed our transgressions from us.
[8:57] Like as a father pityth his children, so
[8:59] the Lord pityth them that fear him. For
[9:02] he knoweth our frame. He rememberth that
[9:04] we are dust. As for man's days are as
[9:06] grass, as a flower of the field, so he
[9:08] flourisheth. For the wind passeth over
[9:10] it, and it is gone, and the place
[9:12] thereof shall know it no more. But the
[9:14] mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to
[9:16] everlasting upon them that fear him, and
[9:19] his righteousness unto children's
[9:21] children. to such as keep his covenant,
[9:23] and to those that remember his
[9:25] commandments, to do them. The Lord had
[9:27] prepared his throne in the heavens, and
[9:29] his kingdom ruleth over all. Bless the
[9:32] Lord, ye his angels that excel in
[9:33] strength, that do his commandments,
[9:35] hearkening unto the voice of his word.
[9:38] Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts, ye
[9:41] ministers of his that do his pleasure.
[9:43] Bless the Lord, all his works, in all
[9:46] places of his dominion. Bless the Lord,
[9:50] oh my soul. Amen. Amen. That's our
[9:53] prayer. It's become our song. Amen.

[11:00] and [singing] was wretched

[1:11:20] raging river
[1:11:23] trusting that [singing] I get across.
[1:11:29] I've made my way through [singing] some
[1:11:32] valleys and deserts, believing
[1:11:37] I'd never get lost. [singing]
[1:11:42] I've been at the foot of what felt like
[1:11:46] mountains ever, knowing [singing] I have
[1:11:49] the strength for the climb.
[1:11:54] Cuz through every trial, [singing]
[1:11:57] it's test and temptation.
[1:12:01] One thing is sure, every [singing]

[1:13:14] nothing [singing]

[1:13:21] Why should I dwell on the hardships
[1:13:24] [singing] and struggles when I look just

[1:14:16] [music] away.

[1:44:14] [music]
[1:44:19] [music]
[1:44:21] Heat. Heat.
[1:44:25] [music]
[1:44:29] [singing]
[1:44:35] [music and singing]
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:44:42] [singing]
[1:44:46] [music]
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; One more time we watching.
[1:44:54] [music]
[1:44:57] [singing]
[1:45:00] [music]
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; We're watching [singing]
[1:45:09] what Jesus
[1:45:12] [music]
[1:45:20] [music]
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; once again after sister Amber, sister
[1:45:25] Stella, brother Mario,
[1:45:28] myself.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Good evening saints and uh God bless and
[1:45:59] happy new year to everyone. Um, I'm
[1:46:02] going to sing the goodness of God and I
[1:46:03] wish I had all your sisters back up here
[1:46:05] to help me sing it out. Um, but I wanted
[1:46:08] to sing the song because it's meaningful
[1:46:10] to me. Um, one of the lines is all my
[1:46:13] days have been held in your hands. And,
[1:46:16] um, when I think back, even the days
[1:46:18] when I had turned away from God, he
[1:46:21] still held me in his hands. I know when
[1:46:23] I look at my career choice, my
[1:46:26] education, even my divorce through the
[1:46:28] positive things and maybe those negative
[1:46:31] things still, you know, he held he held
[1:46:33] my hand.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And now as a Christian, you know, I give
[1:46:36] him thanks for having healed me from my
[1:46:38] fish allergy and for providing a $20,000
[1:46:41] for a car. Um, he's been good to me.
[1:46:44] He's been so so good and I'm believing
[1:46:47] now as I move forward for the salvation
[1:46:49] of my my family. Right. So, um, another
[1:46:52] line here is, "With every breath that
[1:46:54] I'm able, I will sing of the goodness of
[1:46:56] God." And when it came on my heart to
[1:46:58] sing this song that night, I woke up
[1:47:00] with a sore throat. But I'm I'm going to
[1:47:02] sing the song anyways because I'm here
[1:47:04] to show Satan that he's not the boss.
[1:47:06] Right.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I'll give this a try.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord,
[1:47:12] for your mercy never ends. [singing]
[1:47:17] All my days [music]
[1:47:20] have been held [singing] in your hands.
[1:47:25] From the moment that I wake up
[1:47:29] till I
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; lay my head,
[1:47:34] I will [singing] sing
[1:47:37] of [music] the goodness
[1:47:39] of God.

[1:47:46] my life you have been faithful.

[1:48:26] fire

[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; I think I'm the only one alive in here.
[1:57:56] Say, hallelujah.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:01] So
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; I think not I think I believe
[1:58:06] that I am the spitten image of who he is
[1:58:08] this tonight. Right. So um I just want
[1:58:13] to read 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:58:16] 2
[1:58:19] chap chapter 10 sorry from verse 4
[1:58:22] through 5.
[1:58:24] And it says, "For the weapons of our
[1:58:28] warfare
[1:58:30] are not carnal,
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; but mighty through God
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; to the pulling down of strongholds,
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; casting down
[1:58:42] imaginations
[1:58:44] and every high things
[1:58:47] that exalted itself
[1:58:51] higher,
[1:58:54] or against the knowledge of God.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Here is the part that I love. Bringing
[1:59:02] down, bringing into captivity
[1:59:05] every thought
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; to the obedience of Christ.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; So I it is my routine every morning
[1:59:15] before I wake up just read a portion of
[1:59:18] the scripture before I do my devotion.
[1:59:21] And then this morning this is the
[1:59:24] chapter that came into my mind and then
[1:59:27] I read it
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; and then
[1:59:31] I said as a church
[1:59:35] I I said to me would it be like glorious
[1:59:38] to live in a church where everybody can
[1:59:41] be vulnerable to each other and that
[1:59:44] we'll have nobody will have a problem
[1:59:46] with that. So and then uh
[1:59:50] it comes to my mind that as the prophet
[1:59:53] said the
[1:59:55] toughest
[1:59:57] battleground is in our mind
[2:00:01] and then sometime just one line somebody
[2:00:03] says and then because we resonate to it
[2:00:07] and sometime we see that individual
[2:00:11] as not the person God say he is or she
[2:00:14] is but what you say he is
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; and then I say, "Wow." And then brother
[2:00:22] brother
[2:00:24] Paul said it last Sunday. When someone
[2:00:27] says something maybe it doesn't make
[2:00:29] sense, maybe you should take time to see
[2:00:33] that is my that is not my brother, that
[2:00:35] is not my sister.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit that is behind the
[2:00:40] statement. And then if you can cast down
[2:00:43] every bad imagination that you have,
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; then maybe you can merge with the Holy
[2:00:50] Spirit and pray for that individual.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; So it's a song that you you know it's a
[2:00:55] song that you know. And then brother Fer
[2:00:58] just uh in Christ alone I want to make a
[2:01:00] shout for the Lord today.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:01:13] In Christ alone
[2:01:16] will I glory.
[2:01:19] Though I could pride myself in battle's
[2:01:23] war.
[2:01:26] For I've been blessed
[2:01:28] beyond measure
[2:01:31] and by his strength alone I overcome.
[2:01:38] Oh, I could stop count successes
[2:01:43] like diamond in my hand.
[2:01:49] But those trophies could not equal
[2:01:53] to the grace
[2:01:55] by which I stand
[2:02:03] in Christ alone. [singing]
[2:02:07] I place my trust
[2:02:11] and find my glory
[2:02:14] through the power of the cross.
[2:02:20] In every victory
[2:02:24] let be said of me,
[2:02:29] my source of strength, [music]
[2:02:32] my source of hope
[2:02:35] is Christ alone.
[2:02:42] In Christ alone
[2:02:45] will I glory.
[2:02:47] For only by his grace [music] I am
[2:02:51] redeemed. [singing]
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Tender mercy
[2:02:58] could reach [music] beyond my weakness
[2:03:02] to my needs.
[2:03:07] And now
[2:03:09] I seek no greater honor than just to
[2:03:13] know you. [music and singing]
[2:03:16] Hallelujah.
[2:03:19] To count again but loses [music]
[2:03:23] to the glory
[2:03:25] of the Lord. Come on somebody say oh
[2:03:31] in Christ the Lord.
[2:03:39] [music]
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Not somebody [singing]
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; not to Mohamad
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; not to Buddha.
[2:03:46] not to anybody else. In every victory,
[2:03:51] [singing]
[2:03:52] let be

[2:18:26] [applause]
[2:18:31] Thank you, Lord. [applause]
[2:18:34] Isn't it wonderful to praise him?
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer.
[2:18:40] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[2:18:42] you for this opportunity, Lord.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; One more time to come and exalt your
[2:18:47] name.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Father, we know the world is busy
[2:18:51] running to and fro. So many different
[2:18:54] things happening and places [music] to
[2:18:56] go, but Lord, there's something on the
[2:18:59] inside of the inside that wants to be a
[2:19:01] part of worshiping you tonight.
[2:19:05] Father, we recognize what you've done
[2:19:07] for us. And we thank you, Lord. We can't
[2:19:10] even contain the praise and the worship
[2:19:12] that's inside of us, Lord, because of
[2:19:15] what you've done for us. [music] We're
[2:19:17] so thankful that you are God, that you
[2:19:19] are seated on the throne, that you have
[2:19:22] brought redemption to your bride. And
[2:19:25] Father, we just want to say thank you.
[2:19:28] Thank you, Lord, for all that you've
[2:19:30] done, all that you're going to do. But
[2:19:32] Lord Jesus, right now in this moment,
[2:19:34] what you're doing, Father, we give you
[2:19:37] praise and honor and glory.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Father, we just want to
[2:19:42] ask that you would continue to be
[2:19:43] glorified in our midst tonight, Lord, in
[2:19:46] all that's said and done as we change
[2:19:48] the order of the service, Father. Lord,
[2:19:50] we know we don't want to diminish the
[2:19:52] the the worship. We don't want to
[2:19:54] diminish the word. [music] It's all
[2:19:56] about you, Father. And we thank you for
[2:19:58] this time that we can have, Lord. We
[2:20:01] just pray that you would just continue
[2:20:03] [music] to be glorified now as we turn
[2:20:05] our eyes upon you in word form. We just
[2:20:09] ask all these things [music] in Jesus
[2:20:11] Christ's name we pray.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to keep on singing,
[2:20:17] [music] but we'll have a little bit of
[2:20:19] word and then we'll get into some
[2:20:21] testimony. So, thank you musicians,
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; each and everyone for taking the time to
[2:20:27] come and worship tonight, to come and
[2:20:29] bring a song special.
[2:20:32] It really does something. If you have
[2:20:33] your Bibles, I'd like to read a couple
[2:20:35] of scriptures. The first one in Psalm
[2:20:39] chapter 62.
[2:20:43] Psalm chapter 62.
[2:20:48] And then Isaiah chapter 60,
[2:21:02] Psalm chapter 62.
[2:21:07] Thank you, brother Faren, for taking the
[2:21:09] service tonight. The song service
[2:21:12] is tremendous.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:16] Psalm 62:1,
[2:21:19] truly my soul waiteth upon God.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; From him cometh my salvation.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; He only is my rock and my salvation.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; He is my defense.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; I shall not be greatly moved.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; How long will ye imagine mischief?
[2:21:45] mischief against a man.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Ye shall be slain all of you. As a
[2:21:52] boowing whale, ye as a boowing wall
[2:21:58] shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
[2:22:02] They only consult to cast him down from
[2:22:06] his excellency.
[2:22:08] They delight in lies. They bless with
[2:22:10] their mouth, but they curse inwardly.
[2:22:15] Sa
[2:22:17] my soul wait thou only upon God
[2:22:22] for my expectation is from him.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; He only is my rock
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; and my salvation.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; He is my defense.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; I shall not be moved.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; In God is my salvation and my glory. The
[2:22:42] rock of my strength and my refuge
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; is in God.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Trust in him at all times, ye people.
[2:22:53] Pour out your heart before him.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; God is a refuge for us.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Sa,
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; let's turn over to Isaiah chapter 60.
[2:23:04] Isn't that what we did tonight? Poured
[2:23:07] out our heart before him. My
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; what a blessing.
[2:23:12] Isaiah chapter 60
[2:23:18] verse 1. Arise, shine,
[2:23:23] for thy light is come,
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[2:23:29] thee.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; For behold, the darkness shall cover the
[2:23:34] earth, and gross darkness the people.
[2:23:39] But the Lord shall arise upon thee, and
[2:23:42] his glory shall be seen upon thee.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[2:23:51] Father, we thank you for this word.
[2:23:54] Thank you for this opportunity, Lord, to
[2:23:56] read it,
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; to hear it, and Father, for you to break
[2:24:00] it open fresh to us once again. We just
[2:24:03] invite you, Lord, to have the
[2:24:04] preeminence that you desire in our
[2:24:07] service, Lord. We pray that you would be
[2:24:09] glorified now in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:24:13] pray. Amen.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[2:24:16] seated. Welcome all of our visitors.
[2:24:18] Certainly good to have you here with us.
[2:24:21] It's been a while since we've seen some
[2:24:23] of you and I know there's folks probably
[2:24:25] tuned in online. We certainly welcome
[2:24:27] you as well. We wish everyone a happy
[2:24:31] new year.
[2:24:32] We're certainly excited at a time of uh
[2:24:36] time of reflection
[2:24:39] when we enter into a a new year. We can
[2:24:41] look back on the prior year and uh
[2:24:45] reflect upon the things [snorts] that
[2:24:47] have happened to us and we can also look
[2:24:50] forward to a time of anticipation for
[2:24:52] what might actually take place in the
[2:24:55] coming year. And uh you know many times
[2:24:58] people will look at it from a goal
[2:24:59] setting perspective. What goals did I
[2:25:03] accomplish from last year? And other
[2:25:05] folks will want to look at maybe the the
[2:25:09] goals that they want to set for the
[2:25:12] coming year. But tonight, I just want to
[2:25:15] encourage us to reflect upon the
[2:25:17] spiritual blessings that the Lord has
[2:25:20] done for us
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; and then look forwards to the
[2:25:23] anticipation of what the spiritual
[2:25:26] blessings will be. But most of all,
[2:25:30] encourage us to remember what the
[2:25:32] spiritual blessings that are even right
[2:25:35] now tonight while we're here. You know,
[2:25:37] brother Brandham talks about it many
[2:25:39] times in the message about how we can so
[2:25:41] be so busy focused on what has happened
[2:25:44] in the past looking backwards and
[2:25:46] anticipating the future looking forwards
[2:25:48] but ignoring or missing what's actually
[2:25:50] taking place right now. Amen.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; And uh you know I was I was just excited
[2:25:57] talking to a brother about the Lord and
[2:25:59] how the word can be manifesting even
[2:26:02] while we yet speak because of the desire
[2:26:06] of one's heart and how fantastic it is
[2:26:09] when we have a heart that changes
[2:26:11] towards the word. It is not something
[2:26:14] that man can do. And I guarantee you,
[2:26:17] it's nothing that the devil can do
[2:26:19] because the devil's never going to lead
[2:26:20] us to the word.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; The devil's going to take us away from
[2:26:23] the word.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; And we know that that can simply be by
[2:26:27] one word off.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to know the word. But
[2:26:31] I just want to bring you greetings
[2:26:32] tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:26:34] Christ. And uh certainly thankful to be
[2:26:37] able to gather together here at the end
[2:26:39] of the year, the end of 2025. The Lord
[2:26:42] has done so very very much for us and
[2:26:45] and I'm excited to get into testimonies.
[2:26:47] I I really am torn tonight because I
[2:26:50] want to preach. I really feel inspired
[2:26:52] after a song service like that. But I'm
[2:26:54] just going to bring a couple of quotes
[2:26:55] and a couple of thoughts and then we're
[2:26:57] just going to get right into testimonies
[2:26:59] talking about what the Lord has done for
[2:27:01] us. And uh I want to make sure that we
[2:27:04] have a little bit of time for that. And
[2:27:06] um then we'll just have communion and uh
[2:27:09] see what the Lord will do. It's so
[2:27:11] amazing when you can actually start
[2:27:13] preaching at just about 10:00 at night.
[2:27:15] So, I hope we're all okay. If anybody
[2:27:18] does feel uncomfortable and you feel
[2:27:19] like it's getting too late, you're more
[2:27:21] than welcome to leave. We'll still love
[2:27:22] you tomorrow. Um, but I think it's
[2:27:25] wonderful because many times in the
[2:27:27] world, we'll get together and party like
[2:27:30] it's 1999. Hey,
[2:27:33] if you know, you know what I'm saying?
[2:27:36] Now, I'm not saying that uh because I
[2:27:39] want to bring that into the church. So,
[2:27:40] forgive me for that. But what I am
[2:27:42] saying is that if you know what it's
[2:27:44] like to party worldly, it don't matter
[2:27:46] what time it is
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; and it don't matter where you're at.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; And it don't matter who is there. And I
[2:27:51] just couldn't help it earlier in the
[2:27:53] service. I had to stop being in the
[2:27:55] back. I had to come out and participate
[2:27:58] because I I said it even maybe a little
[2:28:00] bit loud. And I apologize if it was a
[2:28:03] little bit loud, but we ought to be just
[2:28:04] as exuberant as everyone else in the
[2:28:07] world.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; When we get into a situation like this,
[2:28:10] we're worshiping before the throne of
[2:28:12] the King of Kings.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; My, if there's a time or a place to get
[2:28:16] out of order, it's right here
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; and right now. And I think it's just so
[2:28:20] beautiful. So, God bless you all for
[2:28:23] entering in. It really makes a
[2:28:25] difference. Tonight, I just want to say
[2:28:26] one word. I could sum up the whole
[2:28:28] entire service in one word right now and
[2:28:31] and I will but I'm going to preach a
[2:28:33] little bit and and it's this shalom.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Shalom. If you know, you know.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; 19640119.
[2:28:44] Brother Brandham, he says, now my
[2:28:45] subject this afternoon is in one word.
[2:28:47] Shalom in Hebrew means peace. Peace or
[2:28:51] it's a greeting. It's a peace be unto
[2:28:53] you or welcome, good morning, any kind
[2:28:55] of a greeting. But the main word I found
[2:28:58] in the Hebrew here, there is many things
[2:29:01] it means, but all pertaining to the same
[2:29:05] thing,
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; peace.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; That's why I just I'm I'm so encouraged
[2:29:11] and I want to just remind us that is
[2:29:14] what the angel messengers always said,
[2:29:18] isn't it?
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Many different ways, but mostly fear
[2:29:23] not.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. What do we have to be
[2:29:27] afraid of?
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; We don't need to be afraid.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Christ brings peace.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; The devil brings turmoil.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; The devil brings controversy. The devil
[2:29:42] brings criticism. The devil brings
[2:29:46] particular problems. But Christ, he
[2:29:49] brings peace.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Because it's a message of grace.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in preaching
[2:29:57] legalism. Legalism is only going to hold
[2:30:00] us for a little while. And legalism will
[2:30:03] actually gobble up our children.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; But grace or peace is what will give us
[2:30:10] the staying power to believe this
[2:30:13] message. Not just believe it, but
[2:30:15] actually live it. And you know, if you
[2:30:17] listen to this message when brother
[2:30:18] Graham talks about it, I've got a few
[2:30:19] notable quotes that I'm going to bring
[2:30:21] about it. But basically in a nutshell,
[2:30:22] what he talks about in this message is
[2:30:24] living it. Not just living it through
[2:30:26] your own power, through a legalistic
[2:30:29] perspective. Because if we do it through
[2:30:30] our own power, that's all it is,
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; It's my dos and my don'ts. And and
[2:30:35] aren't I a good person, especially a
[2:30:38] Christian. We're all sinners saved by
[2:30:41] grace.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; And if there's any good thing in us, all
[2:30:44] that is is Christ.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Because unfortunately, we all suffer
[2:30:49] from the same condition. We're stuck in
[2:30:51] this pest house. And this pest house has
[2:30:54] Cain's DNA inside of it.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's why this flesh will never ever
[2:30:59] inherit incorruption.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "So we we face
[2:31:05] this year like we do all years."
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; There's a regret of our mistakes in the
[2:31:12] past. I I would hope that we have a
[2:31:14] regret for our mistakes in the past.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Some people will say, "Well, I don't
[2:31:18] have any regrets." Well,
[2:31:21] Okay, good for you. It's good to not
[2:31:24] have any regrets. I think that's a
[2:31:26] worldly statement though
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; because the prophet says that we look
[2:31:29] back on our regrets. We we we regret the
[2:31:33] mistakes of our past and looking forward
[2:31:36] for a future of the glorious light of
[2:31:39] Christ.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He goes on to say, "When we are
[2:31:43] willing to admit our mistakes
[2:31:46] that we have done wrong,
[2:31:49] then he forgives them.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; He is full of grace and mercy to forgive
[2:31:56] us
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; for those mistakes."
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; You know, as I read this and and I was
[2:32:02] listening and studying on this, I just
[2:32:03] thought, you know, where do we stand
[2:32:05] with one another?
[2:32:07] Do we have this level of grace for one
[2:32:10] another?
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Because remember, Brother Brandham talks
[2:32:13] about in this message, it's all about
[2:32:15] Christ living through us.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; Our words are cheap,
[2:32:21] but our actions, our lives preach the
[2:32:24] message.
[2:32:26] And you know, it's very easy to get
[2:32:29] caught up in this world, brothers and
[2:32:30] sisters, because there's a darkness in
[2:32:32] this world. Brother Random talks about
[2:32:34] in this message, there's a gross
[2:32:35] darkness upon the people. And you know,
[2:32:38] we we we read that verse two of of
[2:32:41] Isaiah chapter 60, it says, "For behold,
[2:32:44] the darkness shall cover the earth, and
[2:32:46] a gross darkness the people,
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; but the Lord shall arise upon thee."
[2:32:52] Isn't that beautiful?
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; The Lord shall arise upon thee, and his
[2:32:56] glory shall be seen where?
[2:33:00] Upon thee. Amen.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; That's where I think it's just so
[2:33:04] absolutely amazing. We can we can look
[2:33:06] at this message and see that his glory
[2:33:09] is going to be seen upon us.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; And this gross gross gross darkness,
[2:33:17] Brother Brandham talks about in this
[2:33:18] message and and you have to go and
[2:33:20] listen to it. I'm not going to spend a
[2:33:21] lot of time preaching tonight, but this
[2:33:23] gross darkness, the meaning of it is an
[2:33:26] intense or oppressive spiritual or moral
[2:33:30] darkness. That's what this means in this
[2:33:33] scripture out of the Amplified Bible. It
[2:33:35] says, "For behold, darkness shall cover
[2:33:37] the earth and dense darkness,
[2:33:41] all peoples,
[2:33:43] but the Lord shall arise upon you, oh
[2:33:46] Jerusalem, and his glory shall be seen
[2:33:49] on you."
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; It's a tremendous thing.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; You know, we can't stop prophetic
[2:33:55] utterance. And and I think that's why
[2:33:57] we're here tonight because we believe
[2:33:59] the message of the hour. We believe the
[2:34:02] word, the prophetic utterance that was
[2:34:04] brought by the seventh angel messenger.
[2:34:07] And that's what constrains us to attend
[2:34:08] a church like this and not the hundreds
[2:34:11] of other churches in the city. There's
[2:34:13] so many other churches that we could
[2:34:14] choose, but something constrains us to
[2:34:17] come and hear this word because there's
[2:34:19] a prophetic utterance that came through
[2:34:21] the seventh angel messenger. And you
[2:34:24] know, our words are great, but they
[2:34:26] don't mean anything unless they're
[2:34:28] saying what the prophet said. Amen.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; We have got to be saying what the
[2:34:32] prophet said. It was the same thing in
[2:34:34] the days of Jeremiah. If you look at the
[2:34:36] story of Jeremiah, there were people
[2:34:38] that were actually preaching while
[2:34:40] Jeremiah was locked up. And they were
[2:34:42] preaching the prophetic utterance that
[2:34:44] Jeremiah preached. And those people were
[2:34:47] saved.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; But everybody else perished.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; And it's tough, but it's true because
[2:34:55] the only word that he brought was get
[2:34:58] back to God. get back in line with the
[2:35:01] word. That's how we get back to God. We
[2:35:04] don't get back to God through a
[2:35:05] denomination. We get back to God through
[2:35:07] the word.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; But anything will do when you really
[2:35:12] don't want to. Any excuse will do when
[2:35:13] you really don't want to do something.
[2:35:14] You can say it's a cultural thing. I
[2:35:17] I've got my former or prior teaching.
[2:35:19] Whatever it is, I'm just going to stick
[2:35:21] with that and and we'll just try and see
[2:35:23] if it works out. But it won't work out.
[2:35:26] The only way it will work is to actually
[2:35:29] follow the word. In this message, I was
[2:35:31] going to bring it, but I I didn't bring
[2:35:32] the quote. Brother Brandham, he talks
[2:35:33] about how sometimes people feel like
[2:35:36] when they die that that somehow God is
[2:35:38] just going to turn a key in a lock. He's
[2:35:41] just going to twist that key and our
[2:35:43] spirit is going to actually change
[2:35:45] through that turning. And he says very
[2:35:47] clearly that's not going to happen. The
[2:35:49] only thing that's going to happen is
[2:35:50] we're going to change our location.
[2:35:54] Who we are here is who we will BE THERE.
[2:35:56] THAT'S WHY we need a body change,
[2:35:58] brothers and sisters. It's not just a
[2:36:00] body change. More than a body change.
[2:36:02] It's a character change.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the life of Christ living
[2:36:07] out through us. So, if you wonder where
[2:36:09] I'm going with all this tonight, I want
[2:36:10] to say, let's get in line with the word
[2:36:12] maybe more than we ever have in 2026 and
[2:36:15] see if God won't bless us in a way like
[2:36:17] maybe we never could have imagined.
[2:36:19] Amen.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; The wealth and and health is all good,
[2:36:23] but let's put the word first.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Let's put the word first and we can say
[2:36:28] shalom. Peace. God's peace be upon you.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; You know this uh this prophetic
[2:36:36] utterance doesn't matter how many years
[2:36:38] go by. Amos 8:11 says, "Behold, the days
[2:36:43] come, sayaeth the Lord God, that I will
[2:36:45] send a famine in the land, and not a
[2:36:49] famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,
[2:36:53] but for for for
[2:36:56] but of hearing the words of the Lord."
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; People won't want to hear the words of
[2:37:02] the Lord.
[2:37:05] But it it actually goes on to say in
[2:37:07] verse 12, "And they shall wander from
[2:37:09] sea to sea and from north, even to the
[2:37:11] east, they shall run to and fro and seek
[2:37:15] the word of the Lord and shall not find
[2:37:18] it."
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; That's incredible, isn't it? To think
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; many of us just have a Bible on our
[2:37:24] shelf. We could go and find the Bible,
[2:37:25] get the Bible out, and read the Bible.
[2:37:30] But unless we have the spiritual
[2:37:32] anointing for the age, it's just head
[2:37:34] knowledge. That's right.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; It's just knowledge. And anybody can go
[2:37:39] and get knowledge.
[2:37:41] But we don't want knowledge, do we?
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; We want life.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; We want the literal life of Jesus
[2:37:48] Christ. But the prophecy is that there
[2:37:51] will be a time where there will be a
[2:37:53] famine in the land and and so much of a
[2:37:56] famine, a spiritual famine that people
[2:37:59] will look for the word of the Lord and
[2:38:00] they won't be able to find it.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; And you know, it's terrible to say this,
[2:38:05] but there is a prophet that rose in the
[2:38:08] United States of America and called
[2:38:11] people back to the word.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; And as soon as he called them back to
[2:38:15] the word, what did they do do? They
[2:38:17] rejected him.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; So he had to preach the indictment
[2:38:23] and he said, "I indict this generation
[2:38:26] for the second crucifixion of the Lord
[2:38:28] Jesus Christ."
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; And how did they do it? How did they
[2:38:31] crucify him? By ignoring his word. Why?
[2:38:34] Because it wasn't coming the way they
[2:38:36] thought it should. Exactly the same way
[2:38:38] it came
[2:38:41] originally.
[2:38:42] That's right.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; Tonight we're talking about his life
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; being alive manifest in the flesh living
[2:38:49] out through each and every one of us.
[2:38:52] And I want to say we should see his life
[2:38:55] living out through us.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; Many times it can be many different
[2:39:00] ways. We've been talking on Wednesdays
[2:39:01] about gifts and the gifts, the fruits of
[2:39:04] the spirit. Sure enough, it should be
[2:39:06] that way. But really, first and
[2:39:08] foremost, it's got to be the word of
[2:39:09] God. We've got to have something in us
[2:39:12] that drives us, constrains us to be in
[2:39:16] the word of God.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; To take the book and eat it up.
[2:39:22] There's also a prophecy of light. Even
[2:39:24] though there's a prophecy of darkness,
[2:39:26] there's a prophecy of light. In Isaiah
[2:39:28] 60, verse one says, "Arise, shine.
[2:39:33] Don't sit down and be dull.
[2:39:37] Don't run and hide
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; because we believe the message of the
[2:39:40] hour. We don't want to interact with the
[2:39:42] world.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; We don't want to have friends that are
[2:39:45] in the world that we talk to because
[2:39:48] they don't believe the way that we do.
[2:39:49] So, we can't associate with that.
[2:39:52] Brother Brandham said, "Don't be
[2:39:53] strange.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; Just be a good Christian.
[2:39:57] &gt;&gt; Go be a good human being. Let the world
[2:39:59] around you see what it is you believe."
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; He even talked about it. I thought it
[2:40:04] was so good. and and we'll bring it,
[2:40:06] Lord willing, in the future. He talks
[2:40:07] about, you know, wanting to get out of
[2:40:09] the mission field and and go and travel
[2:40:11] to foreign lands to preach the gospel.
[2:40:13] And sure enough, sometimes we want to do
[2:40:15] that. But does the mailman know what we
[2:40:18] believe? Or does the milkman, I think he
[2:40:20] even says, does the neighbor know what
[2:40:23] we believe? If those people don't know
[2:40:25] what we believe, we really ought to be
[2:40:27] out trying to minister the gospel in a
[2:40:30] foreign land, should we?
[2:40:32] But this word says, "Arise and shine,
[2:40:35] for thy light is come,
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[2:40:41] me."
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; I I just think that's so beautiful. As I
[2:40:44] was reading this and listening to the
[2:40:46] the the specials and the song tonight
[2:40:48] being sung, the worship, that's exactly
[2:40:51] what was happening. A we arose and we're
[2:40:54] shining because the light has come into
[2:40:57] our lives. We've got reason to shout
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[2:41:03] thee.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; It's such an amazing thing.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; You know, out of the Amplified Bible, I
[2:41:08] just wanted to bring this out of the
[2:41:10] Amplified Bible just for the sake of
[2:41:12] discussion tonight. Arise from the
[2:41:14] Amplified Bible, the same verse. from
[2:41:16] depression,
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; from the depression and the prostration
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; in which circumstances have kept you.
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; Rise to a new life.
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; As I was thinking about this and
[2:41:31] meditating on this, I thought about
[2:41:33] David, the man who was after God's own
[2:41:36] heart and how he got with Ba Sheeba
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; and he he was an adulterer and he was a
[2:41:42] murderer. And that baby that they had,
[2:41:46] God required it of them, didn't he?
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; But David was on his face before the
[2:41:52] Lord. How many of us have ever gone on
[2:41:55] our face before the Lord with no food
[2:41:57] and no drink and having people saying,
[2:42:00] "Come on, just just relax. You know,
[2:42:02] it's going to get better."
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; I know I never have like that. And maybe
[2:42:07] I'm the only one. I don't know. But the
[2:42:09] fact is, I just think it's so beautiful
[2:42:11] thinking about this, how there came a
[2:42:14] time where the Lord said to David,
[2:42:16] "Arise from the depression and the
[2:42:18] prostration in which circumstances have
[2:42:21] kept you. Rise to a new life."
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; And we know that's what David did,
[2:42:26] didn't he?
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; He rose to a new life with a new wife.
[2:42:30] But we know that in the word, God never
[2:42:34] called Ba Sheeba David's wife.
[2:42:38] He always referred to her as the wife of
[2:42:42] Uriah.
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; But we have the ability to rise to a new
[2:42:47] life, too. And all we got to do is
[2:42:49] simply follow the word for our day,
[2:42:51] right? Take the book and eat it up.
[2:42:53] Revelations 10:1-7, the prophet has
[2:42:55] come. That's been fulfilled. What about
[2:42:57] 8 to11?
[2:42:59] Take the book and eat it up. Give
[2:43:02] ourselves something to share with this
[2:43:04] world. It says in here, I'll just read
[2:43:07] it again. I won't stop this time. Arise
[2:43:09] from the depression and frustration in
[2:43:11] which circumstances have kept you. Rise
[2:43:13] to a new life. Exclamation.
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; Shine. Be radiant with the glory of the
[2:43:19] Lord. For your light has come and the
[2:43:21] glory of the Lord has risen upon you.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; Such a beautiful thing. Unfortunately, I
[2:43:30] have a history. I've I've I've spent
[2:43:33] time in the world. New Year's Eve,
[2:43:35] there's so many different things
[2:43:37] happening and and so many different ways
[2:43:39] of participating in in what's going on
[2:43:42] around the world. But it's just such a
[2:43:43] wonderful thing to think that we have
[2:43:45] the desire to gather together in the
[2:43:47] name above every name, the name of the
[2:43:50] Lord Jesus Christ. Because we know when
[2:43:53] we do that, it's not only us just
[2:43:55] gathering and hoping. He is there in our
[2:43:58] midst
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:44:01] What a powerful thing that is. It is so
[2:44:04] amazing to think that so many people in
[2:44:07] this world tonight are groping in
[2:44:08] darkness, starving for the true word and
[2:44:12] not even knowing what they're starving
[2:44:13] for.
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; Sure, there's Christians maybe running
[2:44:17] to and fro looking for the word in
[2:44:18] different churches and never being able
[2:44:21] to fall under the leadership, the
[2:44:22] headship of of the five-fold ministry
[2:44:25] the way that God has designed it for the
[2:44:28] people to be perfected, for the saints
[2:44:31] to be perfected. Maybe there's people
[2:44:32] like that, but there's also other people
[2:44:34] that don't even know that there is a
[2:44:36] word of God, a word from the Lord. They
[2:44:40] don't even know there is a a a Lord,
[2:44:43] but there's a knowledge of the word in
[2:44:47] many cases. But then this is where it
[2:44:50] gets good for us, brothers and sisters,
[2:44:52] because we don't worship under just the
[2:44:53] knowledge of the word. And I know I'm
[2:44:55] preaching to the choir here now, but
[2:44:57] what do we do? We actually participate
[2:45:00] in the knowledge of the anointed
[2:45:03] spiritual word for our day. And we know
[2:45:06] that's the true evidence of the Holy
[2:45:08] Ghost for the believer because it is
[2:45:11] only a divinely revealed word.
[2:45:16] Now, some people will say, "Well,
[2:45:18] Brother Barry,
[2:45:20] every word of God is divinely revealed."
[2:45:24] Well, I would say that sure enough, it
[2:45:25] is, but it's not divinely
[2:45:28] received.
[2:45:30] And that's the critical factor.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; I would challenge anybody
[2:45:36] to go all the way to the true baptism of
[2:45:38] the Holy Ghost and tell me that the
[2:45:39] message of the hour is false.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; You won't be able to do it.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; That will be impossible.
[2:45:47] But I guarantee you, you will never be
[2:45:49] able to say that you accept and receive
[2:45:52] the message of the hour without the Holy
[2:45:54] Ghost.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; It's a paradox.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; You know, I I just want to read what
[2:46:00] Brother Bradom said. Now, I'm going to
[2:46:01] rattle off some quotes and and then
[2:46:03] we'll just change the order of the
[2:46:04] service if it's okay. I I don't want to
[2:46:06] be stealing the the whole entire thing
[2:46:08] tonight, but I just wanted to encourage
[2:46:10] us, brothers and sisters, to recognize
[2:46:12] that, you know what? If there ever was a
[2:46:14] time where we can stand up and say that
[2:46:16] our light shines, it is today because
[2:46:20] there is a darkness in the land. It's a
[2:46:21] gross, gross darkness in the land. It's
[2:46:24] so dark. Brother Brandham, in this
[2:46:26] message, I didn't bring the quote. Maybe
[2:46:27] I'll have to preach shalom. I'll have to
[2:46:30] do that in the future. I I just want to
[2:46:32] encourage you. Maybe go listen to it.
[2:46:33] 1964 0119 Shalom. Brother Random talks
[2:46:36] about it how how confusing time will be
[2:46:39] that it will be so dark in the land that
[2:46:41] men will want to behave like women
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; and women will want to behave like men.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't just throw one comment
[2:46:49] out there. It's a whole paragraph. He
[2:46:50] talks about it and and brings it right
[2:46:52] back around and says that this is just
[2:46:54] the anointing of the age that you know
[2:46:56] the more you preach it, you go from
[2:46:58] coast to coast preaching it, you come
[2:46:59] back and you think that maybe they would
[2:47:01] get something out of it. It would
[2:47:02] change. But it doesn't change.
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; It gets worse.
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; And I couldn't help but think about what
[2:47:08] would he say if he could see today.
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; How gross is the darkness in the land in
[2:47:13] which we live today? They're changing
[2:47:16] laws to support that behavior. Right.
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; For the Bammy, he says, "But to those
[2:47:23] who will turn on this New Year's
[2:47:27] to the light, then you'll get brighter
[2:47:30] and brighter until that perfect day that
[2:47:33] we look for is appearing where all
[2:47:36] darkness will fade faded away. I I
[2:47:41] personally believe this with all my
[2:47:42] heart. The more that we look towards the
[2:47:44] word of God, not just as a knowledge of
[2:47:47] the word of God, but the anointed,
[2:47:49] divinely revealed word of God, the word
[2:47:52] for our day through a vindicated
[2:47:54] prophet. The more that we do that, the
[2:47:56] more we don't see the darkness,
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; the more that we see the light.
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; Let's not give all the credit to Satan
[2:48:02] in Satan's Eden and say Satan's Eden is
[2:48:05] so dark and it's so terrible and so
[2:48:08] depressive. You know what? That's true.
[2:48:11] But think about the sons and daughters
[2:48:12] of God.
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; They are getting brighter and brighter,
[2:48:16] brighter than they've ever been. Do you
[2:48:18] do you do we realize that? This is
[2:48:20] coming fresh tonight. I think it's so
[2:48:22] good. The sons and daughters of God have
[2:48:24] never walked on the face of the earth
[2:48:26] and shone so bright as they do today.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:29] &gt;&gt; Because of this divinely revealed
[2:48:31] anointed word that we've been given.
[2:48:33] Isn't that a wonderful thing to think
[2:48:34] about?
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't take gross darkness to
[2:48:38] actually show it. Alls it takes is a
[2:48:40] complete submission to the word to be
[2:48:42] able to show it because we know that we
[2:48:44] are not ourselves when that happens.
[2:48:46] When we take the book and eat it up,
[2:48:48] which is the word for our day, the
[2:48:49] message for the Leodysian church age.
[2:48:51] When we're willing to repent when we're
[2:48:54] willing to be zealous and repent, then
[2:48:57] we know that his appearing is where all
[2:48:59] this darkness fades away. We don't see
[2:49:02] darkness anymore. We see light. We see
[2:49:04] word. I know. I'll tell you because when
[2:49:05] I was living in the world, I remember
[2:49:07] thinking I'm never going to get married
[2:49:08] and I'll never ever have children
[2:49:10] because this world is not fit to even
[2:49:12] rear children in.
[2:49:16] &gt;&gt; But not for the believer. That's
[2:49:17] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; Not for the true believers, the
[2:49:19] believers of this word. They recognize
[2:49:22] that there is a keeping power. There is
[2:49:24] a light. There is a life. Something that
[2:49:26] will sustain them and watch over their
[2:49:28] children.
[2:49:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:49:33] We're looking for that day, his
[2:49:35] appearing, where all this darkness will
[2:49:37] fade away. And the reason of that is why
[2:49:40] I say to the church of the living God
[2:49:42] today, shalom.
[2:49:47] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; Because we are
[2:49:51] his lights.
[2:49:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Jesus said, "Ye
[2:49:56] are the light of the world."
[2:49:58] Brother Brandham talks in his message
[2:50:00] about how how first there has to be a
[2:50:01] heavenly sign that takes place first and
[2:50:03] then the earth earthly vindicates that
[2:50:05] heavenly sign. I I want to say you know
[2:50:08] we we can say this we know it. Don't we
[2:50:10] know it
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; that there was a heavenly sign that
[2:50:13] happened right
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; now? Where is the earthly sign? Where is
[2:50:18] the earthly vindication of that heavenly
[2:50:20] sign? It's not just don't put it just
[2:50:22] put it off on brother Brandham and say
[2:50:24] well he had a tremendous ministry. The
[2:50:26] whole purpose of his ministry was so
[2:50:28] that we could be those lights shining in
[2:50:30] the day in which we live.
[2:50:34] &gt;&gt; I'll say this, there was a heavenly sign
[2:50:37] that manifested through William, Mary,
[2:50:39] and Brandham. But there was a purpose
[2:50:40] for that. And that purpose, brothers and
[2:50:42] sisters, is so that tonight we could be
[2:50:45] the earthly vindication of that heavenly
[2:50:48] sign.
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; And if that's not happening, we've
[2:50:52] missed the point of the message of the
[2:50:54] hour. We have missed it.
[2:50:59] You know, in the beginning, God
[2:51:00] separated the light from the darkness,
[2:51:02] didn't he?
[2:51:03] &gt;&gt; Naturally speaking, let's think about
[2:51:06] that spiritually. My goodness.
[2:51:09] Spiritually speaking, we are the
[2:51:12] separators
[2:51:14] &gt;&gt; of the darkness in this world.
[2:51:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that an amazing thought?
[2:51:20] You are the separator of the darkness in
[2:51:23] the world in which you live. That's why
[2:51:25] people, they apologize when they swear
[2:51:28] in your presence and they've never even
[2:51:30] met you.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; They recognize there's something
[2:51:33] different here.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's taking place. That's
[2:51:36] why people feel uncomfortable sometimes.
[2:51:39] That's why people sometimes have
[2:51:41] absolute rage for no reason in our
[2:51:44] presence
[2:51:45] &gt;&gt; because they don't recognize what's
[2:51:47] going on. But it's not flesh and blood
[2:51:49] that we're wrestling against, is it?
[2:51:52] &gt;&gt; But we are the spiritual separator.
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; And it's not us. It's God in us.
[2:51:59] &gt;&gt; Let's be clear. It's his life. It's his
[2:52:01] light living out, shining out through
[2:52:03] us.
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham Shalom. He says, "And
[2:52:06] so it is today that gross darkness is
[2:52:08] coming upon the people. And here we are.
[2:52:11] God has lauded his word to be manifested
[2:52:14] this day. And it's the only light we
[2:52:17] have. And God is going to let somebody
[2:52:21] manifest that word.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Who wants to manifest that word tonight?
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; Shalom, brothers and sisters.
[2:52:29] &gt;&gt; Shalom. God has loted his word to be
[2:52:32] manifest this day. And it's the only
[2:52:35] light we have. And God is going to let
[2:52:37] somebody manifest that word. Somebody is
[2:52:41] going to do it. Right.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; I think that song Hallelujah.
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; my
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; someone's going to do it. He promised it
[2:52:51] and he works just exactly like he always
[2:52:55] did by it.
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; He has never changed his pattern of
[2:52:59] work. If we could just take this into
[2:53:01] our lives and recognize that he doesn't
[2:53:03] change. He's never changed. He can never
[2:53:06] change.
[2:53:09] He prophesies what will happen.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; Then he sends somebody down and
[2:53:14] vindicates that.
[2:53:17] Like I said, don't don't don't take it
[2:53:19] as brother Brand Brother Barry is saying
[2:53:21] that God prophesied, brother Brandham,
[2:53:23] Malachi, and and and and
[2:53:26] Revelation. We're not doing that
[2:53:28] tonight. We're talking about us. This is
[2:53:30] about the church of the living God, not
[2:53:33] about a prophet. We're not going
[2:53:35] backwards. We're going forwards.
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; I want us to recognize what we are doing
[2:53:41] here. He has never changed his pattern.
[2:53:43] He prophesies what will happen. There's
[2:53:46] going to be someone that will manifest
[2:53:48] this word. That's what he said. He sends
[2:53:51] somebody down and vindicates that.
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; So, I want to say tonight, brothers and
[2:53:56] sisters, each and every one of you are a
[2:53:59] vindication of that.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:01] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here tonight, ain't
[2:54:02] it? Yes,
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; we came to manifest that word because we
[2:54:07] believe it
[2:54:09] &gt;&gt; and it goes over the head of millions
[2:54:11] &gt;&gt; because darkness covers the earth at
[2:54:13] that time. So, if you catch kind of
[2:54:16] where brother Barry is at tonight, I'm
[2:54:18] I'm just celebrating this word. Shalom,
[2:54:20] peace to the church of the living God.
[2:54:22] If we have this word, we are the living
[2:54:26] manifestation of his word.
[2:54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. It's so much more than books
[2:54:32] and tapes. It's so much more than
[2:54:33] quoting quotes. It's the literal living
[2:54:36] Jesus Christ on earth again manifesting
[2:54:39] in flesh.
[2:54:42] And it goes over the head of millions
[2:54:44] because darkness covers the earth at
[2:54:45] that time. And people love darkness
[2:54:49] better than they do light
[2:54:53] &gt;&gt; because darkness has a lot of pleasure.
[2:54:56] And you know, there's many people that
[2:54:58] understand that darkness has a lot of
[2:55:01] pleasure. The devil always tries to make
[2:55:03] it look appealing and attractive and and
[2:55:05] and and and and
[2:55:08] once you actually taste of this heavenly
[2:55:10] gift, brothers and sisters, it's
[2:55:12] impossible, impossible for you to turn
[2:55:15] away.
[2:55:17] &gt;&gt; We talked about that before. Brother
[2:55:19] Brandham doesn't say that it's
[2:55:20] impossible for you to ever be restored
[2:55:22] again. He says that it's impossible for
[2:55:25] you to ever turn away from it if you
[2:55:27] ever taste of this heavenly gift.
[2:55:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says your life proves
[2:55:33] whether Jesus is with you or not. Your
[2:55:37] words don't prove it. Our words don't
[2:55:40] prove whether Jesus is with us or not.
[2:55:43] Otherwise, he would have said that. He
[2:55:44] would have said your words prove whether
[2:55:47] Jesus is with you or not.
[2:55:51] Your life proves whether Jesus is with
[2:55:54] you or not. Your life shows whether he
[2:55:58] is occupied here or whether he's still
[2:56:01] in his heavens or not.
[2:56:05] I think that's powerful.
[2:56:08] &gt;&gt; I think it's encouraging because
[2:56:10] brothers and sisters, we don't want to
[2:56:12] just quote quotes.
[2:56:14] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just say we believe God
[2:56:15] sent a prophet. What good is that?
[2:56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil believes that,
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; But the devil can't contend when we say,
[2:56:23] "Be it unto me according to thy word."
[2:56:25] And it's literally the literal life of
[2:56:28] Jesus Christ via the Holy Spirit living
[2:56:31] out through us. The devil can't contend
[2:56:32] with that.
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; The devil has to flee. Your life proves
[2:56:37] whether Jesus is with you or not. Your
[2:56:41] life shows whether he is occupied here
[2:56:44] or whether he is still in his heavens or
[2:56:47] not.
[2:56:48] Whatever you are, the works that I do
[2:56:51] shall you do also.
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; How could you have Christ in you
[2:56:58] and then the very spirit in you deny his
[2:57:02] word?
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; Take up a creed instead.
[2:57:06] &gt;&gt; And I'll say take up a tradition instead
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; or take up a teaching instead or take up
[2:57:12] a substitute instead.
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; Say, well, I I'll just do this instead.
[2:57:16] I'll just do that instead. How could it
[2:57:19] literally be the same spirit? It can't
[2:57:21] be the same spirit. He's not going to
[2:57:23] deny his own word.
[2:57:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; He'll never deny his own word. And you
[2:57:28] know what's so good? I want to say this,
[2:57:30] brothers and sisters, just to be clear
[2:57:32] because I can feel it. Even though we
[2:57:34] fall, it doesn't mean that we don't
[2:57:37] believe.
[2:57:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; If you're not struggling,
[2:57:42] the devil's got you.
[2:57:46] If you're fighting, keep fighting.
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; If you're fighting, keep surrendering to
[2:57:51] the Lord. Keep surrendering to the word.
[2:57:53] Keep dying to yourself daily so that he
[2:57:55] can live. And I want to SAY IN 2026, DO
[2:57:58] IT MORE. I WANT TO DO IT MORE. I want to
[2:58:01] see more of God in my life.
[2:58:05] &gt;&gt; But some might say, well, oh my,
[2:58:09] it's so hard.
[2:58:12] I don't see Christ. Many times I see my
[2:58:14] flesh. I see problems. I see
[2:58:16] circumstances and situations.
[2:58:19] &gt;&gt; Just get back up.
[2:58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[2:58:21] &gt;&gt; Don't stay down.
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; Just get back up and get going.
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; Get back up and trust the Lord. If
[2:58:28] you're not fighting, if you're not
[2:58:29] tripping, if you're not falling, the
[2:58:31] devil's got you.
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; He's got you right where he wants you.
[2:58:35] Because you know what the devil will do?
[2:58:37] He'll put a religious spirit on you and
[2:58:39] make you feel like everything in my life
[2:58:40] is perfect.
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; I saw something recently and I thought,
[2:58:44] "Wow." You know, when you see someone
[2:58:47] that's perfect in their life, they work
[2:58:48] so hard to polish their image and have
[2:58:50] just a perfect image in their life.
[2:58:53] Watch that guy.
[2:58:55] &gt;&gt; Watch that guy
[2:58:56] &gt;&gt; because there's something wrong
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; somewhere. Every human has a fault.
[2:59:01] We've all got a punch coming is what the
[2:59:03] prophet said from the devil. But we've
[2:59:06] got to be willing to accept that and
[2:59:07] just trust the Lord with it.
[2:59:11] &gt;&gt; I just love how brother Bannam being the
[2:59:13] mouthpiece for the Lord, the the voice
[2:59:16] box to the age, if you will. But to the
[2:59:19] elected, precious and called saints of
[2:59:23] God, I say to you this coming year,
[2:59:27] shalom.
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; God's peace.
[2:59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; I I ain't trying to scold us tonight.
[2:59:34] I'm trying to encourage us to recognize
[2:59:36] our position. We are the slicers of the
[2:59:40] darkness. We're the separators of this
[2:59:42] gross darkness that's on the land that's
[2:59:45] upon the land. And it's so beautiful
[2:59:47] because brothers and sisters, even
[2:59:48] though we can't see it, I guarantee you
[2:59:51] the devils can see it.
[2:59:53] &gt;&gt; And every once in a while, we might be
[2:59:54] able to get a little glimpse of it. You
[2:59:56] might have seen it once in a while. We
[2:59:58] hear stories. Anybody ever heard a story
[2:59:59] about someone seeing the pillar of fire?
[3:00:02] someone seeing just a little bit of
[3:00:04] something that's just a little
[3:00:05] different, a little supernatural. Don't
[3:00:08] think that's crazy or superstitious.
[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; Believe it.
[3:00:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it in every one of
[3:00:14] his meetings. There it is. And it's over
[3:00:17] top of that person. And we know that
[3:00:19] that's exactly what it is. Let's not
[3:00:21] take and make that picture of William
[3:00:23] Mary and Brandham and and just hang it
[3:00:25] into our own hall of fame and say that
[3:00:27] picture is great. Let's put it on the
[3:00:29] wall and keep it there. Let's say that
[3:00:31] picture was an example for me. Even
[3:00:33] though I can't see it or necessarily
[3:00:36] feel it, that pillar of fire is resting
[3:00:38] above me. That pillar of fire is
[3:00:40] actually resting in me. But think about
[3:00:42] it, how amazing it is when we live in
[3:00:44] the city of Calgary, how we can just
[3:00:45] slice through all the darkness in this
[3:00:47] world that we're living in. But then
[3:00:49] when we bring all of those little
[3:00:51] pillars of fire together, what happens
[3:00:54] here is we have one ginormous pillar of
[3:00:57] fire,
[3:00:57] &gt;&gt; whether we can see it or not.
[3:01:00] There is a spirit of God here.
[3:01:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandaman says, he goes on to
[3:01:04] say, "And there is a light of the hour
[3:01:06] today." That's Jesus Christ in the power
[3:01:08] of his resurrection, his word that's
[3:01:11] promised for this day.
[3:01:14] And we are the literal vindication of
[3:01:16] that word. It's just so beautiful.
[3:01:20] Just so beautiful. My I just I just got
[3:01:23] into this and I was just like a kid in a
[3:01:25] candy shop. I apologize with so many
[3:01:27] quotes tonight. It's just so so
[3:01:29] beautiful. Brother Badami says, "And all
[3:01:32] all the New Testament speaks of this."
[3:01:34] I'm I'm going to wrap up here with this
[3:01:36] these these these last two quotes here.
[3:01:39] I'm going to end with this.
[3:01:42] Shalom 1964. All the New Testament
[3:01:45] speaks of this hour. Jesus Christ speaks
[3:01:48] of this hour.
[3:01:50] &gt;&gt; We know that John spoke of this hour and
[3:01:52] Daniel spoke of this hour.
[3:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:54] &gt;&gt; All the New Testament speaks of this
[3:01:56] hour. Jesus Christ speaks of this hour.
[3:01:58] Who is it then? Some man. It's Jesus
[3:02:02] Christ, the son of God, manifesting,
[3:02:05] reflecting the light on the word that he
[3:02:10] promised for this day.
[3:02:12] Isn't that beautiful?
[3:02:15] &gt;&gt; Again, let's not put it off on Brother
[3:02:17] Brandham and say, "Well, this was him,
[3:02:18] the prophetic office, 1964." No, no.
[3:02:22] Let's bring this right up here to today.
[3:02:24] This this was food stored up for a time
[3:02:27] when there would be a famine in the
[3:02:28] land.
[3:02:29] &gt;&gt; Don't think that God is any different.
[3:02:31] Just like he was manifesting in the days
[3:02:33] of Joseph when there was the the dirt
[3:02:36] upon the land, seven years of good and
[3:02:38] seven years of bad. Don't don't think
[3:02:41] that the spiritual famine we would have
[3:02:43] no no ability to actually feed upon this
[3:02:46] word. This is a feast spiritually
[3:02:49] speaking, brothers and sisters, for the
[3:02:51] day in which we live. When a man see you
[3:02:54] living like him, when he sees your
[3:02:58] your what?
[3:03:00] &gt;&gt; Character
[3:03:02] and your conduct with the word just
[3:03:06] exactly like he was the word being
[3:03:09] manifested.
[3:03:12] Then man will see Jesus Christ.
[3:03:14] &gt;&gt; Now we can go back to the discussion we
[3:03:16] had a couple minutes ago where I said,
[3:03:18] you know, what about when we fall? What
[3:03:20] about when we make mistakes? What about
[3:03:22] when we're human?
[3:03:24] He knew exactly who we would be, exactly
[3:03:26] where we would be at, and exactly all of
[3:03:29] the genetic predispositions that would
[3:03:31] be manifesting in our life that the
[3:03:33] devil is going to try and play on
[3:03:34] because he knows exactly where we came
[3:03:36] from, all of our parents and
[3:03:38] grandparents and great-grandparents and
[3:03:40] all of the history, all the darkness
[3:03:42] that's upon the land, especially in this
[3:03:44] flesh. That's why we need a new birth.
[3:03:47] We have to have a new birth. There's no
[3:03:49] no exemptions, no exceptions. There's no
[3:03:51] other way or truth or life. We have to
[3:03:54] be born again. But you know, when we do
[3:03:58] fall,
[3:03:59] when we do say those things, when we do
[3:04:01] spit that venom with our mouths, when we
[3:04:04] do actually make mistakes,
[3:04:08] what do we do? That's the difference
[3:04:10] maker. Because the believer is going to
[3:04:12] go make it right.
[3:04:14] &gt;&gt; The believer is going to look back and
[3:04:15] say, "Uhoh." because I hear the Holy
[3:04:18] Ghost telling me, "You did that wrong.
[3:04:22] You got to make that right.
[3:04:24] I'm going to go make that right." That's
[3:04:26] what the believer is going to do. And
[3:04:28] that's the difference maker. The ones
[3:04:30] that say, "No, no, no. I'm just going to
[3:04:32] sweep it under the blood. Lord, please
[3:04:33] forgive me for my sin and, you know,
[3:04:35] have a nice day and we'll just get on
[3:04:36] with life." Those are the ones that are
[3:04:39] dragging around condemnation. Those are
[3:04:41] the ones that are holding on to things
[3:04:42] that they don't even know they're
[3:04:43] holding on to.
[3:04:46] But sooner or later, it's all coming to
[3:04:48] the surface. It's all going to boil over
[3:04:50] one of these days. And God will not will
[3:04:54] not allow a son or daughter of God to
[3:04:58] continue on that path.
[3:05:00] &gt;&gt; He will always make sure that we make it
[3:05:03] right.
[3:05:05] But here we are talking about the word
[3:05:07] being manifested. This is such an
[3:05:09] extreme level, an extreme level of
[3:05:12] belief. We are the word made flesh
[3:05:15] today. That is what the scriptures say.
[3:05:18] We sing that song all the time. Do we
[3:05:19] believe that with all of our hearts?
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; We are the generation,
[3:05:27] the final voice to the final age. Not
[3:05:30] the ministry, not the five-fold
[3:05:32] ministry, but each and every one of us.
[3:05:33] Those those those separators of
[3:05:36] darkness. I think that's so beautiful.
[3:05:37] I'm going to continue with that. That's
[3:05:39] so amazing to think about. But it's
[3:05:42] about the word being manifested and then
[3:05:44] man will see Jesus Christ
[3:05:47] &gt;&gt; because they'll see a man that has
[3:05:49] faults and failures, that has trials and
[3:05:51] tribulations, that has shortcomings and
[3:05:54] failures,
[3:05:55] &gt;&gt; but is willing to admit them.
[3:05:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[3:05:58] &gt;&gt; To look themselves squarely in the
[3:05:59] mirror and admit them.
[3:06:02] &gt;&gt; Without that admitting, there's no hope.
[3:06:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right.
[3:06:06] &gt;&gt; But it first takes that surrender to
[3:06:08] oneself will to say, "Hey, I know I'm a
[3:06:10] skunk. I know I'm a scoundrel. I know
[3:06:13] that I did this and I did that
[3:06:16] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to make it right.
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; Even if it embarrasses me. Oh my. Even
[3:06:21] if it tarnishes my image,
[3:06:25] my self-image. Oh no."
[3:06:28] That's exactly what Christ wants
[3:06:31] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want us to have our
[3:06:33] image. Amen.
[3:06:35] &gt;&gt; If we are the word,
[3:06:37] &gt;&gt; he wants us to have his image
[3:06:40] &gt;&gt; ambassadors for him,
[3:06:43] &gt;&gt; the word being manifested, then then man
[3:06:47] will see Jesus Christ.
[3:06:49] &gt;&gt; They won't have to look around anywhere
[3:06:51] else and say, "What what does this creed
[3:06:53] teach? What does that creed teach?"
[3:06:55] They'll they'll know exactly what God is
[3:06:58] when they see
[3:06:59] &gt;&gt; you.
[3:07:01] Woo!
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; What a powerful message this is. Final
[3:07:05] quote here. Brother Brandham says,
[3:07:06] "Shalom, God's peace and light be upon
[3:07:09] you."
[3:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:11] &gt;&gt; And when God's word is vindicated in
[3:07:13] this age completely and you see it and
[3:07:17] believe it, shalom to you.
[3:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "Face the new year with this.
[3:07:27] put him as David said, I'll put him
[3:07:31] always before me.
[3:07:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Farah, for
[3:07:36] reading the Psalms. I think that's so
[3:07:39] beautiful.
[3:07:41] &gt;&gt; I'll put him always before me because he
[3:07:44] is on my right hand. I shall not be
[3:07:46] moved.
[3:07:48] &gt;&gt; If you meet death this year, what
[3:07:51] difference does it make? Yeah,
[3:07:55] &gt;&gt; that's such a heavy thing to say,
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; but really, what difference does it
[3:08:00] make?
[3:08:01] &gt;&gt; God promised he would raise you up.
[3:08:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:08:05] &gt;&gt; If an accident kills you, what
[3:08:07] difference does it make?
[3:08:09] &gt;&gt; You have eternal life.
[3:08:13] &gt;&gt; I'll raise him up at the last days.
[3:08:15] Amen.
[3:08:17] &gt;&gt; What if anything happens?
[3:08:19] No matter what it is,
[3:08:21] nothing can separate us from the love of
[3:08:24] God
[3:08:25] &gt;&gt; that's in Christ.
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hunger, peril, nakedness, no matter what
[3:08:30] it is, nothing can separate us from the
[3:08:32] love of God that's in Christ.
[3:08:35] &gt;&gt; And he is the word.
[3:08:38] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:40] &gt;&gt; I want to say tonight, brothers and
[3:08:41] sisters, shalom.
[3:08:43] &gt;&gt; God's peace.
[3:08:45] &gt;&gt; Let it be upon you in 2026.
[3:08:49] And I pray that when we do this next
[3:08:51] year, if the Lord should terry, that
[3:08:53] we'll just have way more testimonies
[3:08:56] &gt;&gt; than we'll even know what to do with.
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; I know the Lord has been so good to us
[3:09:01] in 2025.
[3:09:03] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm I'm excited to celebrate that
[3:09:06] tonight. We're going to we're going to
[3:09:08] change the order again. We'll just open
[3:09:10] it up to testimonies. I want to take a
[3:09:13] few minutes and just give us an
[3:09:14] opportunity to testify about what the
[3:09:16] Lord has done for us
[3:09:19] just so we have an idea for time. I'll
[3:09:21] give us I'll give us 40 minutes. We'll
[3:09:26] do 40 minutes and uh then we'll actually
[3:09:30] change the order and we'll go into a
[3:09:31] communion service at that point. So
[3:09:34] instead of saying a number of
[3:09:36] testimonies, we'll simply say we've got
[3:09:38] 40 minutes. So, if you have a testimony
[3:09:39] that you would like to bring about what
[3:09:41] the Lord has done for you in your life,
[3:09:43] I just would like to request that you do
[3:09:45] it timely. Please don't preach a sermon.
[3:09:48] Just simply say what the Lord has done
[3:09:50] for you and then give someone else an
[3:09:52] opportunity because there's many, many
[3:09:54] testimonies in our midst here. Somebody
[3:09:57] tonight have a testimony they'd like to
[3:09:59] share
[3:10:00] about what the Lord has done for them in
[3:10:02] 25.
[3:10:06] I I know. Brother Aiden, brother Joel,
[3:10:08] we got two. Sister Stella.
[3:10:12] Praise the Lord.
[3:10:18] &gt;&gt; Uh, God bless you all. I never take for
[3:10:21] granted the health of my family. So, I'm
[3:10:24] just extremely grateful that my children
[3:10:26] are doing well in school. Elias skipped
[3:10:30] a grade and he's doing excellent in the
[3:10:31] next grade, which I we were praying
[3:10:33] about for a long time.
[3:10:35] um many many many things God has done
[3:10:37] for us uh even with our our acreage and
[3:10:40] challenges we had there
[3:10:41] &gt;&gt; and he's always provided a way of escape
[3:10:43] and um also Uh,
