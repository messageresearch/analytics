family and I just yeah forgive me I trust you all feel right at home this morning it's wonderful to see your face faces 1 John CH 2 verse1 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever as we turn over to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 I just want to remind everyone that the will of God is his word and the will of God is not just the word in print form and and not just the study of the Bible and the memorization of the verses but it truly is the life of Jesus Christ Living out through the individual in this day we have uh 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 18 in every give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for this word that you've given us Lord Jesus we thank you for the print word because we know it's you in print form it's the love letter that you've given us father and we we we thank you for it we accept it the way that you've given it to us Lord we don't try and make excuses for it we don't try and make it some sort of a a time or a space thing or a cultural difference father we take it the way that you've given it to us father we know there's no accidents that if you could set this universe in motion you could you could give us a word that would be totally correct for our day we thank you for this word Lord Jesus now father we pray that your spirit would come and Quicken this word to us father that Lord Jesus we would truly hear from you that when we leave this building today that we would not be the same father that we would just Lord oh father that we would give you the glory that you desire we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated we just have a few announcements before we get going this morning we have uh uh we're leaving on Wednesday after service but I'm certainly excited to have Wednesday service here because we're going to get back into the exposition of the seven Church ages and you know we left at a real hot spot it's probably one of my favorites in that book and I think it's just going to be a real good service and certainly excited to be able to do that but we're going to uh going to go to Ohio we're going to go and visit some of Brother Paul's siblings we get to participate in a Fourth of July celebration with the family which is going to be a real treat um we don't get to see that part of the family very often so Lisa gets to see her aunts and uncle and uncles get to see some of the family there and we're going to take a service for brother Wayne at uh his church I think it's true word Tabernacle in bluon Ohio and uh I can tell you that I'm pretty nervous because we know brother Wayne that boy knows how to preach he knows how to shock the corn is what one of the other ministers said and uh you know he's just a real brother and a real friend he's been a real encouragement to me in in in this position and just as as a friend even before this when we would you know fellowship with brother Ken he's just been a real friend and and I'm certainly thankful to be able to go and and see him so pray for me and we'll certainly be praying for services here we have brother Toby Odin NOA will be taking the service on the 4th uh on the 7th I apologize we have a prayer meeting on the 4th brother Toby will take the service on the 7th and we have brother toonbo he's going to take the service on the 14th and uh we have the youth event at the clawen house on the 21st so we're certainly excited to see what will happen amen are you happy this morning I truly mean it when I say uh it's exciting to see everybody's face here it's uh it's very humbling to stand in this position it's not something that's taken lightly so God richly bless each one of you as uh we heard earlier I I do want to say uh just a real uh God bless you a heartfelt God bless you to the Sunday School teachers they're the ones that we're trusting with our children and trusting them to to train them up in the way they should go in in terms of the scripture and wasn't it wonderful to hear them reciting scripture just reciting scripture to have the desire to go to Sunday school to to want to be a part of the assembly and it's just a real wonderful thing and we're certainly thankful to have people that have a burden for the children so God God richly bless you Sister Shelly for your commitment to [Applause] that and brother Emanuel God bless you brother certainly wonderful to be a part of the assembly I I want to get back into our discussion about God's Will and uh have you enjoyed the ministry that's come through here hasn't it been wonderful we've been so wellfed I I just think it's amazing I I I felt almost guilty because we had so many ministers come through we had brother Mar o Chua we had brother Dela ad delodon brother Jack Duff and then brother Cadre Diggs all in the same month that that's unheard of here I think but you know I I think we've been really well fed it started by hearing about Resurrection by seed with brother marot Chua and isn't it wonderful to think that if we have been resurrected then that's because we have that seed Gene of God inside of us the only way that Resurrection can happen though is for a death to take place the original life the first man has to rot for that seed to actually take place for that seed to come to life brother Dela preaching on God's provided way so many so very many nuggets in that message that he preached God has a way and he's provided it for us and alls we have to do is accept it it's just tremendous brother Jack Duff chosen for royalty that's what we've been chosen for that's what the resurrection by the seed is that's what God's provided way is is to actually be royalty to understand that and and I just love how brother kadre brought it he topped it off fundamental people with a Pentecostal faith if you could ever get those two people together is everything okay brother okay I wasn't sure if you were motioning to me or not okay fundamental people with Pentecostal faith if you could ever get the fundamentalists together the ones that have all of the mechanics everything looks right everything sounds right they talk right everything is right they know the message oh my but they just don't have that Pentecostal faith to put together with that act that that life that they live but if you can get those two people together those two classes of people brother Bram talked about my goodness look out what we will see is the true manifestation of the word for our day and that's really probably where I'm stuck with you know coming out of the exposition of the church ages the manifestation of the word for our day that's who we are brothers and sisters we're not just churchgoing people we're not just message believers we don't just believe that God sent a prophet you are the literal manifestation of God in this age if you believe his word because if you believe his word you'll believe what the prophet said and you'll take that word and you'll apply it in your own life you'll be just like John as the type of the Bride you'll take that book and you'll eat it up and your flesh won't be able to stand it your flesh won't like it one bit oh my but your soul will talking about God's will God's will for our lives it's his word but it's more than just a print word and we know that it's more than just a print word it's it's it's the word of God through a Vindicated Prophet because outside of that where would we be today am we would be fundamental people without the baptism of the Holy Ghost because brothers and sisters if we've just been baptized in titles we haven't been baptized at all that's pretty sharp but that's true why was it that Paul said to the people unto what baptism have you been baptized and he corrected them he said hey unless you're willing to come and get baptized again you haven't been baptized but anyways I don't want to go too far into that I want to talk about God's Will and it's his word and it's not just a print word it's actually the word given to the age by a Vindicated prophet and isn't that a wonderful thing to think that we have the ability to receive that word because out of millions and billions of people almost nobody in this world can receive that word but it's so beautiful to think that uh he has a will and a way and he doesn't change he doesn't change in his ways or in his character God bless you brother Jo way and sister Becky it's good to see you again they've been away for a little while welcome back Isaiah chapter 54 maybe turn with me there as we as we get into this discussion I want to turn over to Daniel chapter 6 as well we're going to get into a very well-known story about brother Daniel the Prophet but first I want to just talk about Isaiah 54 verse1 17 it's important to remember that every single step of our way that we go through in life nothing not one thing will supersede the word of God in our lives the devil will come around and try and tell us nope God doesn't care NOP God's not listening nope God was never there no God's not real but that's just the devil amen because everything else we just heard about it is going to pass away but his word will remain so all of the trials and tribulations all of the the the lusts that we have in this life whether it's the the the lust of the flesh or the lust of the the eyes whatever it is we all suffer every one of us has one of those three maybe two of those three maybe three of those three all of us suffer with those three Giants in our lives brothers and sisters but there comes a time where we will absolutely overcome every one of them and not to say that we won't have those thoughts and those Temptations coming our way they're always going to come our way until we actually either go to the Grave or go in the sky one of those two things is going to happen to us but we're always going to have those temptation what's going to happen is they're going to have less and less impact on us less and less effect on our lives and that's where the devil's going to say I don't want to go and have to deal with those people because I can't get them to respond I don't want nothing to do with them because they're the literal manifestation of the word for their day they believe that God sent a prophet amen but Isaiah 54:17 when we're going through our trials when we're going through our Temptations Just remember this verse brothers and sisters no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Hallelujah Thou shalt condemn and you know what it might not even be here maybe it'll be before the white Throne of judgment but as the bride as as the redeemed as as the chosen of God we are going to offer Grace to everyone yes but that doesn't mean they're going to accept it many times we're going to get kicked right many times we're going to get spit in the face many times we're going to get rejected but that's not going to change the character of Christ Living out through US am every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord now I just can't help but think that you know maybe Daniel had this scripture written after him in his life because he actually the last where we left off was I believe it was chapter five yeah it was chapter five in in the Book of Daniel and and how there was the Feast of belshazzar wasn't there he was the son of Nebuchadnezzar he was brought up in the ways of Nebuchadnezzar we talked about this how he knew all about this Prophet that God had given as as the Captivity of Judah into into the the country of Babylon the the people of the Chaldeans they had this guy but Bel shazar grew up and became king when his dad Nebuchadnezzar passed away and what did he do he got caught up in all of the worldly things all the lust of the world he got caught up in to the point where all of those Devils that were around him and in him they said you know what it's time to actually just go a little step further the devil never just wants to let us stay put brothers and sisters today this morning the law of the universe is you are either growing or you are dying you are not neutral there is no neutral ground especially spiritually speaking brothers and sisters you are either spiritually growing or you are spiritually dying the devil is never going to let you have peace never unless you let Jesus Christ into your life unless the Lord Jesus Christ comes right inside and reveals himself to you personally and you have that baptism of the Holy Ghost experience where you have the new birth but the devil's not going to let anyone just stay put so of course in his fashion he took Bel shazar he he's the same as he was all along too he can't change his ways that's the way God created him so what did he do he pushed Bazar to just step too far because there was a prophecy that was written in Jeremiah saying that that Kingdom would come to an end and what happened was Darius came marched in we know we saw the handwriting was on the wall God came down and he wrote on the wall brother Bram had that happen in the Tabernacle in our generation the thing he's the same yesterday today and forever it sounds like it's kind of Hokey Pokey Supernatural but it's true he is the same he came in down in the Tabernacle Jeffersonville Indiana and he wrote the same thing not not the same thing Bel shazar but he wrote the church ages the the the stages of the moon and the complete Black outat the complete apostasy in the Leo Dean age but isn't it wonderful to think brothers and sisters we're no longer in the leoan age there's some people that are full on in the leodan church age but you know we had a prophet in our day come around and say this is not the leodan church age this is the bride age there is another age happening and the same Prophet said the ages are not hard start and hard stop they blend they always blend and that's where it tricks people because they miss the corner but blessed be the name of the Lord fundamental people with Pentecostal Faith they can't miss it because they're chosen for royalty they they didn't even choose themselves he chose them before the foundation of the world and that's God's provided way because there's a seed that has to be resurrected oh my it's so beautiful but there Ain ain't no weapon that's formed against you that shall prosper it's that way that's that's the Lord's word and it's just such a beautiful thing I I'm going to take uh a bit of a a a tour through Gabriel's instruction to Daniel today but first let's let's maybe turn over to Daniel chapter 6 if you haven't yet let's just read this this chapter here hopefully we can get through it remembering that God's will is his word Daniel is an example of a Believer who just trusted God every single step of his way he was taken put into captivity we talked about this early on in this study this is part 10 of of the series about God's will being his word and and Joseph was another example of someone that just simply put God's word first in his life and and God made a way for him through every scenario every situation he was not destroyed David was carried away into captivity with the children of of of Judah but in chapter 6 verse1 it says it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom and 120 princes which should be over the whole Kingdom and over these three presidents of whom Daniel was first that the princes might give accounts unto them and the King should have no damage now we know that Daniel was the one that that he God used him mightily he he he he was given the ability to see dreams and and to interpret them as well not just be able to interpret a dream and that was what Nebuchadnezzar wanted was someone to show him the dream first to prove to him that they actually knew the dream they knew what they were talking about this was a supernatural experience so when the interpretation came the king would be able to say that's truth because nobody would ever be able to know what the dream was unless the gods revealed it to him but we know that it was God one God the only God that gave him the interpretation of it the the revelation of that dream but here we have Daniel in this situation now where Bel shazar completely forgot about God forgot about this prophet and Bazar is taken right off the scene according to the prophecy now we have Darius stepping in and saying this kingdom is mine now everyone is going to fall under the jurisdiction of my kingdom and and we talked about this before how the people even in the Chaldeans must have been upset think about the people now in darius's Kingdom and how there was three presidents that he set up but Daniel was the first now he wasn't just a captive from Judah he was a captive from Judah that was taken by the Chaldeans and now he was taken by the Chaldeans to be over or under darius's Kingdom it's pretty amazing you can think about how the people must have been upset the other presidents the ones that thought they were in line for that promotion for that position in the kingdom and here we have this one that was a captive now suddenly he is actually right up there one of the three protecting the king and you can see that the word says it was so that the king should have no damage he didn't want nothing to do with the people they were the king's Shield everything that happened in the Kingdom came to these three presidents Daniel was one of them verse three then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and the princes because an excellent Spirit was in him brothers and sisters today I want to say to you if you want to see God's will in your life just have his word living out through you in your life and you will be just like Daniel because the people that encounter you whether it's at school whether it's at work whether it's in your family whether it's in church they will see that you have an excellent spirit in you but man if you're going around moping if you're going around saying you know you hear about the pastor he's got this new vehicle or you got this thing or there's that we sang that song again there's this problem there's that problem if that that's what we're doing brothers and sisters that's not the spirit of Christ let's call it out if you're going to be talking negative you are giving voice to the devil Satan is speaking through your lips but if you're going to have an excellent Spirit you're going to be encouraging you're going to be uplifting you're going to be speaking the word of God people around you are going to experience that and they're going to love that if you want a promotion at work have an excellent Spirit if you want to excel at school have an excellent spirit and I want to tell you brothers and sisters those are wonderful things aren't they if you want to have acceleration in your spiritual walk have an excellent Spirit when you come into the sanctuary of the Living God because you don't come here to hear from Brother Barry don't come here to worship with brother Paul come here to worship God as the redeemed you know this is the quietest place place we're ever going to be is what brother Bram said that's a direct quote the quietest place we're ever going to be cuz down low it's going to be really loud they're going to be screaming and saying I should have listened I should have taken that whole message of the hour I shouldn't have had a critical spirit on me but you know what they're not going to be as loud as the redeemed worshiping God because they're going to recognize that they could have been there but the redeemed are going to be given him the praise and the glory that he's desired because it's his seed because it's royalty they've been chosen to go God's provided way and just I just can't get away from this thought you know the people who are locals here you know you heard me say it many times just imagine how holy and how magnificent Heaven is all of that Heavenly Host all of those cherubims and seraphim those ones that cry holy holy holy art thou Lord God Almighty day and night they're so holy but they have to cover their feet and they have to cover their face but two of their wings are flapping and they're crying out to God continually before him all of those are going to be silent to listen to you worship they're going to step back and say whoa listen to this when we were praying this morning before service with the musicians I just said you know isn't it wonderful when you hear people have those testimonies I've heard at least a couple maybe even three where people say there's times where we're we're singing and and I just suddenly hear a sound it sounds like there's thousands of people in the room brothers and sisters you're breaking through that's the theophany body is coming that's Heaven and Earth meeting in that moment there's coming a time where the only thing we're going to do is worship and that might sound boring to some people but the truly redeemed they long for that day oh my imagine no more bills no more troubles no more sickness no more heartaches no more misunderstandings no more problem no more issues just worship just giving God the glory for what he's done for us the devil wants us to think well sitting around on a cloud if I look at it that way I'd think man yeah I'd rather go fishing I want to float around on a cloud but it ain't going to be like that it's not going to be like that at all we don't even have an understanding of what it's going to be like the closest that we can get is just like brother brandham said there was a time where he went beyond the curtain of time and he actually saw those millions of people right that's as close as we get to it we don't have to eat we don't have to sleep we don't have to worry about any any of the problems or situation I just think it's so beautiful my goodness but you know Daniel he had an excellent spirit that excellent Spirit was in him call it Part B of verse three and the King thought to set him over the whole realm am this isn't just for Daniel brothers and sisters this is for every single son and daughter of God on Earth you get that excellent spirit inside of you and watch out watch and see what will happen verse four then the presidents and the princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they couldn't find none occasion or fault there was nothing that they could find on him you know brothers and sisters there's things that we can find on everyone on each one of us isn't there if we really want to look we can get right into the hinder parts and say wow there's this about that brother and there's this about that sister and there's this about the other you know unfortunately we all do things we all are sinners and have fallen short of the glory of God but we don't look at one another after the flesh we don't know one another after the flesh it's only after the spirit but to think that Daniel I just love how brother Bram says going to get into it we got some quotes here you got the quotes brother right on Daniel he didn't even have a church he didn't even have a worship service he didn't have anything spiritually going for him in his day to encourage his walk did he but yet this is what the word of God says about this man so we don't talk about God's will being his word brothers and sisters if we have that new birth experience there's times in our life where we will say how did that happen how did I say that how did I react that way because there's no way on my own accord that I would ever do that and you can step back and say thank you Lord thank you Lord when you get into worship service you don't worry about anybody else you say Thank you Lord I know what you've done for me this week I know what you've done for me this last decade I know what you've done for me every step of the way in my life there's no reason that I would be here today were it not for you my then the presidents and princes verse four sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him why then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this Daniel except we find him except we find it against him concerning the law of his God and isn't that exactly the way of the devil brothers and sisters don't worry about your flesh in this world just don't let like brother brandham said don't don't let anything get between you and that word for your day don't ever let anything get between you and the word for your day that's a direct quote from Brother bradam it might be a little bit bized but it's very much exactly like that don't let anything get in the way don't let a song leader don't let a deacon don't let a neighbor don't let a brother don't let a sister don't let a Sunday school teacher don't let anybody get in the way between you and that word because it's not that person it's the devil trying to set an occasion so that you will stop following the word for your day and that's all it's going to take brothers and sisters is to be one word off Eve was one word off in her day she stepped back and didn't follow one word for her day and what happened we know what happened but these presidents and princes they sought to find Fulton Daniel they couldn't find any so what did they do they decided to get low they decided to try and find something about him spiritually we'll carry on here verse six then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him King Darius live forever all the presidents and Kingdom and governors and the princes and counselors and the captains have consulted together my they really worked hard to get something on down Daniel didn't they and you can count on it there's principalities brothers and sisters and Powers working real hard working over time to come against the bride but no weapon formed against them can Prevail then these presidents princes assembled together to the king and said unto him uh King Darius live forever all the presidents the kingdom the governors and the princes and the counselors and the captains have consulted together to establish a a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whomsoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for 30 days save of thee Oh King he shall be cast into the Den of Lions now oh King establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the laws of the mes and the Persians which alterthe written and it's put into law there's no changing it in the laws of the mes and the Persians wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree he was in a probably a happy State he probably wasn't thinking it all the way through because he was friends with Daniel he really appreciated Daniel Daniel was an asset to the kingdom you can imagine so we have this story I think it's just beautiful because it looks like there's a giant weapon formed against the the believer for his day right right now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and closed all the blinds and ran down into the basement and cried no no he was a Believer he never had a pastor he never had a church he never had tapes to listen to he never had a song service he never had any nobody there encouraging him just keep going just keep pressing on come on brother nobody texting him nobody calling him nobody emailing him nobody doing nice things or saying nice things it was just simply him there and what did he do anyone who actually disobeyed was going to be thrown into the L Den of Lions brothers and sisters 700 lb beasts 600 bound beasts that love to eat flesh and Crush bones why now when Daniel knew the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber towards Jerusalem he kneeled on his knees three times a day he just said you know amen blessed be the name of the Lord whether I live or I die I'm Christ ain't nobody going to get between me and that word for my day three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God thank you Lord that you've made a decree that Lord you could manifest your powers greatly again in my life before all the people of the land he already saw the Hebrew kids into the fire right he already witnessed that he already witnessed the identification of dream he knew that he served the Living God he recognized the prophet's word most of all the reason he was there was he recognized the prophet Jeremiah's word and he accepted it the way the prophet gave it to him and he went forwards believing that word and because of that God spared his life and it ain't no different today brothers and sisters if we want to try and interpret the prophet's word or say that there's something that gives us license to disobey the prophet's word which really isn't the prophet's word it's actually the word of God through a prophet if that prophet's Vindicated you're actually negotiating with the word of God but those people who say Amen to that word isn't it beautiful we don't have to hold up a sign right there's just something on the inside of the inside that recognizes that's actually a part of spiritual worship it's not just being fundamentalist it's actually saying God's speaking to me and I want more of it speak to me more God give me more because the bit that I've had already this week it's not enough I need a little bit more in my life Daniel went into his house and said amen thank you Lord gave thanks before his God as he did a four time he didn't change nothing he just said Thank You Lord I know you you are a living God and it doesn't matter what weapon gets formed against me it cannot Prosper verse 11 then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God I say Lord help me if if there's ever a time in this world where I have to do something not according to the law of the land let it be that I would be found three times a day on my knees just like Daniel praising the Lord just like I did before not because they're putting a squeeze on saying no you you believed William brandom you need to actually shut your doors you can't declare that and N hey you know what when that happens we're going to say it all that much more aren't we or is there some people that are going to go hide brothers and sisters this is going to come time for a showdown that's where we're headed and it's rapidly increasing in time there is going to be a showdown we can't help it I love it though was I was talking this week to someone you know we're going to have people they're going to come to you and one of the first greetings instead of just saying hello sir or hello ma'am how are you today in this world they're going to say how do you identify what's your pronouns I was telling a brother I'm going to say my pronouns are I am I am and you know those people they won't recognize what you're saying but the devil's inside of them they will they will understand full well and they will say wow look at this is this really the manifestation of the life of Jesus Christ that's where we're headed those guys came near and verse 12 then they came near and spake before the king saying oh my the king's decree concerning the king's decree hast thou not signed a decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within 30 days save of thee Oh King shall be cast into the Den of Lions the king answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the mes and the Persians which alterthe and said before the King that Daniel that Daniel I just want to say brothers and sisters take your name and pop it in there that brother that sister oh my that Daniel that Daniel which is of the children of the Captivity of Judah regardeth not thee O King nor the decree that thou Hast signed but maketh his petition three times a day just pouring it on they want to get him in trouble they were just jealous it's all getto they just couldn't stand the fact that the king had favor for Daniel but it was because he was of an excellent Spirit he had another spirit in him and you know I want to say it was the Holy Spirit even though some might say well brother Barry the Holy Spirit wasn't given yet you know what it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever who was it in the Fourth Man in the fire was it God was it Jesus or was it the Holy Spirit who was it verse 14 then the King when he heard these words was sore displeased with himself he wasn't upset with Daniel for disobeying him because he knew that Daniel worshiped God that's what made him an asset in his kingdom in his toolbox then the king heard these words he was sore displeased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him I just can't help but Wonder as I was studying this as we talk about this how many people ever had King Darius do that I would wager none not one other human being and I could be wrong about that but we know that God does things a certain way for a certain purpose then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king know oh King that the law of the mes and the Persians is that no Cree nor statute the king established may be changed don't bother trying to save him it's too late we're going to see him get crunched by a lions and we're excited to see it it's no different hey than the Roman spirit that happened where they threw Christians into the lions Same Spirit it's the devil then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him into the Den of Lions now the king spake and said unto Daniel his last words to him hey thy God whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee even this King recognized this was a living God God would not allow this King have any other way out other than recognizing him as the deliverer isn't that beautiful and we know that a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the dead and the King sealed it with his own signant and with the signant of his Lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel oh my then the king went to his Palace and passed the night fasting neither were their instruments of Music brought before him and his sleep went from him and we know this King he was pretty anxious then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to The Den of Lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel you can only imagine Daniel are you there Daniel oh Daniel and the King spake and said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living God is thy God whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the Lions oh my you can only imagine that moment hey then Daniel and then said Daniel unto the king oh King live forever my God hath sent his Angel and have shut the Lion's [Applause] mouths that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee O King I have done have I done no hurt isn't it wonderful to think that that truly is what happened to this man this was on Earth this was a manifestation on Earth but this was a manifestation of the word for his day because of that all of those Lions mouths were shut for Daniel's sake isn't that beautiful brothers and sisters it's no different today and I guarantee you there are lions roaming around seeking whom they may devour Devils Desiring to Chomp on the bones to Devour the young to get after the women and the children to take down the husbands in relationships to destroy Church assemblies that's what the devil is busy up to but you know what we have the ability to say my god he has sent his Angel and you know what I have believed his word just like Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word I might not understand it but I'm not going to challenge it I'm just going to say hey I can see there's an angel and he's got a message for someone and I'm going to say Amen that message is for me I'm going to take that message and I'm going to put it in my heart and you know what's going to happen is we're just going to actually become that message Mary actually became that message didn't she when she said Amen to that angel just be it unto me according to th Thy word what happened the Holy Spirit overshadowed her and she grew a life inside of her now we know that she delivered a baby and and you know what we will deliver a life also and it will be the life of Jesus Christ and that life will no longer be able to be contained in these fleshy Earth and vessels it will actually have to go to its theophany body in the clouds one day where we meet with those people who are in the graves out of Gabriel's instructions to Daniel in 1961 brother brandham says in paragraph 78 and I want you to notice how Daniel yet an alien he wasn't from this land he was an alien in this land yet an alien ousted from his people ousted from his church without one church service without any church to go to without any hyms to be saying but what he sang himself in the midst of all this he still held on to what that Prophet said amen are we able to do that today brothers and sisters doesn't matter who comes doesn't matter who goes doesn't matter what's up or what's down we have the ability to hold on to what that Prophet said to us in this day I just can't help but think that the people that do that they recognize this is not a prophet speaking it's not just a man if the man is a prophet he's actually God's voice box on Earth am hallah but my goodness many times we'll hear stories we'll see things situations will rise and people will just leave church oh my people will get upset with one another yes there'll be all these things you know what it is it's the devil it's Satan and he wants to upset the people of God but just go on praising him brothers and sisters go on thanking him giving him praise he says no church to go to nobody to fellowship with everybody went to Heathen temples and I can't help but Wonder was that even the the the children of Judah they just go to the Heathen temples and say hey everyone else is doing it we might as well we know that's what they were doing early on in Daniel's visit in the Kingdom where they were eating the king's meat and drinking the King's Wine but not Daniel not Daniel he wasn't going to defile himself with any of that but here we have this man with no church to go to nobody to fellowship with everybody went to Heathen temples everybody worshiped their Idols no Christian songs nobody believed the same thing he did and in 68 years from a young man of about 12 or 14 years old so for 50 years the Year of Jubilee half a century this man had no church no Fellowship no tapes to play probably no Bible to even read he just had him in his heart and you can imagine that there was probably some of the sweetest Fellowship that ever could take place on earth that could ever take place this side of Eternity because there's nothing in the way there's no man's ideas it's just simply Fellowship one-on-one with God and we know that God ministered to this man why did he minister to this man because he was of an excellent Spirit if you go later on into Daniel I don't know if I'm going to go into it or not Daniel 70 weeks he had Visions even while Bel shazar was on the scene and so before the story that we're talking about God came and dealt with him sovereignly he had Visions in his head while he laid upon his bed and it troubled him and we know it's about the RAM and the horns and the Bear all these different things that he started to see but you know God came and dealt with him like that when he was busy he was busy doing one of those three things that he did every day he was busy praying and you know what the word says as you go further you can go and read it later for time sake but what he was busy doing was he was busy praying for his sins and praying for the sins of the people praying for his brothers and his sisters interceding for them knowing that there was a God and the only way was to give all of that life all of that trouble and tribulation to God and let him sort it out some way somehow it was going to happen and you know it wasn't until he was 68 years old that he was reading in the books a prophecy there was a prophecy and when he read that brother I'm jumping way ahead brother bradam says when he read that he got excited and he really got to praying and he really got to fasting and really trusting that God was going to move on the scene for him amen he says and in 68 years from a young man of about 12 14 years old when he was taken down there he held true to God and isn't that beautiful brothers and sisters it's just exactly like Joseph he held true to God there's no making excuses for it and and just trusting in Him knowing that he knows everything he knows the beginning from the end the end from the beginning everything in between don't look at our flesh when we look at our lives brothers and sisters we're going to say that we're going to fail but you know when brother bradam says that he's only coming for a virgin the the Bride is a virgin you know that you know that the Bride of Jesus Christ is a virgin he's not talking about our flesh don't go there he's talking about his word she is a virgin to his word and that's all do you have the ability to say Amen to his word for the day if you do then you are a virgin to Jesus Christ amen I think it's just beautiful he held true to God and understood by Jeremiah's Prophet that the days were almost accomplished we know that Jeremiah was alive in 606 BC and he prophesied because of their sins and their ungodliness that they would be there for 70 years they would be led into captivity for 70 years but you know brothers and sisters not everyone was led into captivity we need to remember that there was a lot of people most of the people were not led into captivity most of the people were actually destroyed because the spirit of God prophesied through this Prophet Jeremiah to go through the land and not spare not spare the women not spare the children don't worry about the elderly you know what when they cry out to me I'm not going to have pity for them because I called unto them over and over and over again and they continually rejected me and they continually mocked me but they would say no no no we just simply mocked that man we just simply talk bad about that man we just simply talk behind that man's back we just simply talked about him and and disregarded him but what they didn't realize is that man was the voice of God for their day and the more they did it the more they disrespected God and God you know he eventually came to the place where the Prophet said to them you know even though your city is under siege Jerusalem was under siege with Nebuchadnezzar they were camped around it they were starving them out and we know the people just turned into Savages they were they were eating young the children boiling babies how Savage can you get those were Believers right the chosen ones in Jerusalem that's how bad it got while they were yet Under Siege God came to them in the prophet and said if you would just go and submit yourself to the king to King Nebuchadnezzar go surrender say I'm sorry you'll live right but if you got so much pride so much pride you'll say nope I won't hear one word of Correction no way I've gone so far out on this limb I'm not going to go back not one inch what's going to happen is you're going to die that's what the prophet told him you will die but at least you have the opportunity to live if you will Just Surrender yourself to the king you'll live as a slave the rest of the days of your life but at least you live and they never had the ability to get rid of that Pride one of those one of those lusts one of those things that we read about those things that will all pass away that thing had more power over them than the ability to surrender themselves to the word of God I want to encourage us today if you got the ability to surrender to the word of God don't let the devil tell you nothing if it's if you hear any thought or any idea come to you that's contrary to the word just dismiss it and say it's Satan it's Satan it's Satan you know when you get bad thoughts thoughts they're not your thoughts brothers and sisters it's the devil the devil has learned that you react to those thoughts and so because he knows you react to those thoughts he continually gives you those thoughts and you know maybe you don't react to those thoughts but maybe your dad did maybe your mother did maybe your grandfather your grandmother maybe your great great great great great person actually reacted in certain ways to those thoughts but you know as long as we entertain those thoughts and we actually act on those thoughts the devil is going to have victory in our lives he's going to have a toe hole he's going to have his fingernail in the crack of the door of our lives but as soon as we actually start slamming that door on him and saying no that's not my thought that's your thought that's that's you that's the devil anything contrary to the word of God brothers and sisters anything that would play into to those lusts is of the devil there comes a point in time where a son and daughter of God is no longer going to be subject to those thoughts where they're going to say hey you know what I understand now way different than when I did because the word of God says that when I was a child I thought as a child and I acted as a child but now that I'm a grown man I'm Sovereign in my life and I know that he is Lord over me and he is The Sovereign God I'm not going to allow myself to act like I used to as a child some of the biggest children are grown adults and I say Lord Lord help me because I've acted like a child but as we go forwards brothers and sisters there's no need to act like children there's no need to be afraid there's no need to worry there's no need to talk evil about other people there's no need to say mean things one to another all we need to do is just give him preeminence in our lives make sure that we're allowing him to live out through US recognizing that this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost right here and he's not going to allow his Temple to be defiled brothers and sisters when we want to go and defile these temples in whatever manner then he's not going to be there I say Lord help me I don't ever want to push him out but I know there's times where the Holy Ghost has just gone and flowing I'm so sorry to say this but I know in my life there's times where the Holy Ghost has done what the prophet said he'll just go and sit up in the tree there he'll just go and and be a little bit of ways away watching over me but still just saying you know what while you've got that walth nature you're not going to have my spirit and you need to get another spirit inside of you you need to calm yourself down you need to clean yourself out and when you do that then the Holy Ghost will come back the Holy Ghost will come back amen Gabriel's instructions to Daniel Daniel he made himself ready I think it's beautiful brother bradam says how that would warn the heart of any true prophet of God today that we look back and see what this true Prophet said said amen and know that we're at the end time he said I understood by books that Jeremiah my brother didn't make him a great one didn't make him someone that he wasn't didn't worship Him D Daniel saw Jeremiah as his brother he said I understood by books that Jeremiah my brother many many years ago prophesied that Israel would stay down here 70 years and that time is about fulfilled isn't that beautiful and that time is about fulfilled take a look at our day brothers and sisters I want to say and that time is about fulfilled as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man yes sir and you know we have seen we have witnessed we have beheld the coming of the son of man don't wait for a worldly event some sort of pride thing to trigger you to get into Christ because if it doesn't do it by the preaching of the word brothers and sisters ain't nothing going to do it what we're going to do if we're waiting for an Earthly event maybe California is going to sink into the ocean and then we're going to get right with God maybe we're going to see something happen like that you know what happens is we're going to find ourselves with the mark of the beast and not even know it is what the prophet said because everything that's supposed to happen has happened the only thing the prophet saw left for the church is for the Rapture he said I understood by books that Jeremiah my brother many many years ago prophesied that Israel would stay down here 70 years and that time is about fulfilled and he made himself ready I just think that's beautiful we have every single reason to Rejoice brothers and sisters when we get into a church service whether it's preaching or or whether it's worship to rejoice and be very very glad because the marriage of the Lamb has come and what not his bride we heard it this morning not the bride but his wife has made herself ready that one who he knew who he had the relationship in an intimate fashion with she was no longer the bride there was no longer a veil over her head he had already taken the veil lifted it up and and kissed her and told told her that he loved her and took her veil and put it on his shoulder to signify that all the responsibility for her is his now brothers and sisters that's what happens in marriage when you take that bride all of the responsibility for that woman now is yours all of the responsibility for those children is yours you will stand before almighty God and give an account for how you managed your position he called a fast and he Sanctified himself and when ashes and Sack cloth and put it upon his head and went to fasting and praying he didn't just say oh well it's how it is I don't know what to do in captivity been here this long I don't know what's going to happen maybe we'll go back I'm already an old man maybe I won't get to see it now he didn't do that he didn't start moping around he didn't look at the natural circumstances other than he started to get ready he started to say Deliverance is near it's just about time brothers and sisters it's not a time to get weary in well-doing it's not a time to get tired of marching to the beat of this gospel it's time to actually be looking to see when the notes are going to change so that when our time to play is that we're able to be in time in step with the great Symphony that brother bradam talks about in that message uh talking about Peter and the Wolf but in Gabriel's instruction to Daniel he goes on to say and if Daniel the Prophet of the Lord could consult Jeremiah's books oh my and bring him to such a place that even Israel coming out all of them alive was coming out of Babylon to go back to the Homeland would cause him to fast with sackcloth and Ashes how much more ought it to do the Church of the Living God to know that time is fading out and shall be no more it just makes me think brothers and sisters I I can't see why we wouldn't have a prayer meeting on Thursday night recognizing that this is the books this is the prophecy that's in the books when we would have a Thursday night prayer meeting that the house wouldn't be full here of Believers saying hey we know that Deliverance is near we know that the son of man Ministry is already happened in fact it's still happening and I feel it right now now don't get me wrong we don't we don't dwell on feelings and emotions and there's a whole push in the word in the world today in the message to get caught up in emotions and feelings don't worry about that brothers and sisters just keep that word keep the word of God first in your life and that will be what we need that's the only thing that we need to try and say that I've seen a sign or a Wonder I've seen a healing I've seen a miracle in my life sure enough you will see them if you put that word first in your life but here's the trick if you put experiences first if you put something Supernatural happening in your life first in front of that word the devil can impersonate it the devil can impersonate every gift and what will happen is we'll say oh that's Supernatural experience but you know what sometimes the super natural experiences aren't exactly according to the word of God we know the prophet said it very clearly away with experiences as the plum line put that word of God first in our lives my that even Israel coming out all of them alive was coming out of Babylon to go back to the Homeland would cause him to fast with sackcloth and Ashes how much more ought it to do the Church of the Living God to know that the time is fading out and shall be no more and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the great Millennium ready to set in how can we spend wasteless time gambling swimming hole on Sundays no time for the Lord just run down if the pastor speaks on something another that you don't like you get up and go out and if the church holds to long why you're dissatisfied my I had that roast in the oven and that guy just keeps going on my we had a guest speaker here and he went an hour longer oh my we're not used to that that's crazy talk how could we do that and then another Minister comes through and does it again oh my brothers and sisters where are we at don't want to get caught in ruts if you've ever driven on a road a 4x4 Road where there's ruts deep ruts or snow we've probably all experienced it where you get ruts that are deep so deep when you try to steer out of them when you're in mud or snow you can't get out of them you're stuck you can put your hands behind your head and you can actually just rest and just press on the gas and it'll just be like a train it'll just continue going you cannot get out of those ruts but blessed be the name of the Lord when we get in our spiritual ruts he is more than willing to just accept us and help us to get out of those ruts to shatter the Traditions I couldn't help but think it when when brother Cadre was was preaching on Wednesday isn't it interesting how they had all of their traditions and ideas in in the days of Jesus and when Jesus came what did he do he shattered all of their Traditions all of their reasoning all of their ways he shattered them and what happened a little bit later on in history 2,000 years later God sends a prophet hasn't been a prophet for thousands of years on the face of the Earth but here we have a prophet shattering the traditions of men all of the religious people shattering those Traditions it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever don't get stuck in Traditions brothers and sisters if you have traditions in your life make sure they line up with the word of God if they don't line up with the word of God throw them out just get rid of them but if the pastor speaks on something or other that you don't like you get up and go out if if the church holds too long while you're disatisfied look at your condition look what we're doing here we have him talking about this in 1961 back in Daniel's day they never even had a church isn't it interesting to think the one brother said that that job's problem job's problem originated in church we have to know where we stand brothers and sisters but don't let the church be your absolute and you know I think that's really why people get upset and leave that's why people get fussed is because they're putting their trust in man if you put your trust in God you know he's in complete control brothers and sisters don't you believe that you could actually pray to that God and have him change the heart of that preacher of that Pastor of that song leader of that Deacon of that brother the sister we've been given this encouragement to be a part of a body I just can't help but think why would we want to scorn that why would we want to spurn that first Thessalonians 5:18 and everything brothers and sisters give thanks everything and it's not everything as one word every everything that we do brothers and sisters everything that we think every experience that we go to Every Valley that we encounter every problem every really exceedingly hard trial that we encounter in our lives give thanks why why for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus because there ain't things that H we don't encounter things just by accident in our lives and the devil I think tries to get us to believe that well we caused this sometimes we do we'll step outside of the will of God in our lives but when you're genuine in your heart of hearts and you're really honest with yourself and you find yourself in a trial brothers and sisters God has allowed that trial to actually show everyone around to show all the spirits around all the principalities and powers that are trying to attack you who you are and most of all he's trying to show you who you are because when we go through these exceedingly hard trials it's showing us who we are how could we ever make it through some of the trials that we've gone through in our lives I I don't know Naturally Speaking there's no way that we should many times in a marriage there's things that happen where the world will just blow up in the marriage and that will be it for the marriage and the children grow up and they've got scars and now they're in a situation they don't know what it means to have a healthy marriage in their life and on and on and on it goes but something happens in the heart of a Believer we can go to the deepest darkest Realms on Earth in our marriages and God will still meet us there and he'll say to you just do this just do that and if we're willing to heed his call he will heal us and what happens is we lined up with a marriage that's way stronger than it ever could have been because we've gone right down to the foundation right down underneath the foundation right to the very core of who we are it's so beautiful I can't help but think Daniel went there many times in his life no church no Fellowship no friends no no joint assemblies maybe no no other message preachers anywhere he only had himself and maybe the couple other brothers that were there looking to him for instruction looking to him for encouragement he was the encouragement to the people out of Gabriel's instruction to Daniel brother Bram says compare our lives with that Prophet one man in a kingdom with no church to go to and nowhere else to go it was tore down and burned down his City his people was captive 68 years 69 70 he had two years left so when he began to read the book and see that the time was drawing night to be fulfilled be fulfilled he went to God In Prayer to find out about it brothers and sisters I just want to encourage us today you know we could leave this building and think my goodness the Rapture has taken place now we're already in glory but then maybe we had a little bit more worship that we could have gave we could look back and say you know what in that service there I I just had this thing in my heart this thing that happened that week and it just CAU caused me it just really has been bugging me and it just got in the way of My Worship my ability to worship God we don't want to look back from eternity and think there was a time where we just didn't give all that we've got brothers and sisters we might not have another service and would you want to look back and think that we could have gave more but we didn't it's a little bit like running a race if you've ever ran before when you get to the Finish Line you don't want to cross that Finish Line thinking you've got more energy you got you you could have gone faster you could have got a better time now nobody's going to get to heaven faster than anyone I'm not saying that what I am saying is God desires worship he is an object of worship and that's the only thing that he wants is our worship and Satan wants to be just like the most high and to keep us from worshiping him and get us to worship a god of our imagination but if we're willing to just strip the hide off ourselves and say I don't care about that problem this week I don't care about the problem next week I don't care about tomorrow or yesterday or anyone else around me I'm just going to give him the praise that he desires right now brothers and sisters he'll come down and he will minister to the very need in our lives Daniel recognized the time was short he recognized the time was near he knew that God's will was his word now I don't know if he ever had a prophet say it that way to him but something was on the inside of him that just took it that way and what did he do he put God first in every single situation of his life so I want to say today what are we doing it's not just me saying it the prophet I believe said it in this same message what a time what are we doing when nations are breaking the sea is roaring men's heart failing for fear perplexed of time all these things the handwriting on the wall the handwriting on the wall wasn't just belshazzar's Feast it was in Jeffersonville IND the handwriting was on the wall vindicating what this Prophet had said what this Prophet had drawn earlier in the day on a Blackboard God came down and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him listen to what this man is saying now don't get me wrong I'm not saying brother Brandon was Jesus Christ I'll say it about you if you have his spirit inside of you and you talk to people in this world I guarantee you that God will be saying the same thing this is my beloved Son here ye him we can't be anybody else but Jesus Christ if we've got his spirit inside of us brothers and sisters the devil wants to say no no no no no no no no no no you can be you yeah you just you just do you isn't that what's the common phrase you do you and I'll do me I'll just be myself and you just be yourself no that's the way of the world we just want to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever living out through our lives but but what are we doing what a time what are we doing when nations are breaking the sea is roaring men's heart failing for fear perplexed of time all these things we see the handwriting on the wall racial disintegration all kinds of evil going on in the world excuse me and fusses and fights and stews isn't it interesting fusses and fights and stews even in the message oh my fusses and fights and stews it's all the devil when you see that brothers and sisters that's the devil someone is giving place to the devil and the word of God says to not give place to the devil fusses fights and stews and weapons hanging in hangers that one little Nation by the size of Cuba down here can destroy the world in 10 minutes and them fussing with one another ungodly man who knows not God and knows not his power and the Holy Spirit in the church moving amongst the elected showing himself alive after 2,000 years that he is the same yesterday today and forever how can we set slothfully how can we just run over the top of it time we were checking up watching for that great hour approaching I just think it's so beautiful maybe stand with me as we begin to close here I'll say stand so it'll keep me kind of honest with the closing out of expectations you know brother brandham he said I've got a right and I just can't help but think that wasn't just for the prophet that was for Daniel that was for Ezekiel that was for Jeremiah that's for the Bride of Jesus Christ brother BR himself says and listen the devil put us in the pawn shop back there from Adam's sin but Jesus came down and paid the pond bill so it's not going to be our good works and it's not going to be our good looks and it's not going to be our our good actions and things that we do God's already paid it all he's already done it all he's already paid the pond bill wrote it on the word and I got to write for it amen I just believe brothers and sisters I want to encourage us this week as we go forwards to remember this quote I've got a right for it amen Satan get back I've got a right for it may Brothers told me you can't get well and maybe you've got a doctor that's told you you can't get well maybe you've got a doctor that said you need this medication this is is the only way that you'll ever be able to be semi functional in this world because of depression if you have that that's a devil that's Satan that's his agent tell him to get back in the name of Jesus Christ maybe it's an illness in our body it's the devil tell them you got a right to it you've got a right to Healing get back in the name of Jesus Christ he said well you inherit it from your father maybe you got a temper like a buz saww oh my I inherited it it's the devil don't say those words tell them I got a right to peace and joy and so do the people around me you inherited it from your father you inherited peace and love and joy and longsuffering and gentleness from your father that's what you inherited from your father I say but my heavenly father redeemed me amen I'm out of the shop now amen so just move over Satan he said I'll just pull symptoms all around you watch when that happens that's what brother Bram said when the healing comes on the scene everything's going to get worse when you're truly getting healed it gets worse but you can tell him just get back I said stand around can you imagine that the prophet wasn't even tell him to get back now he's saying come on come to church with me and listen because I'm going to work worship and ain't nobody going to stop me from giving praise I'm going to worship when I'm throwing up I'm going to worship when my head doesn't even think straight because of the headache that's in me when I feel depression whatever it is I'm going to praise God I'm not going to let Satan have any room in my life and I said Satan stand around listen at me testify I'd like for you to hear me I said I'll testify that much harder I'll make it much more testimony if you want to hear praise God stick around a while you'll hear me I just kept praising God and made it so hot for him he had to flee just heard him brother Brandon makes a noise hitting his hands together scoot off his old sleo foot right down the street as hard as he could had to couldn't stand the praise when you hear brother brandom say you know what there'll come a time where the devil just won't even know what to do with you it's not going to be because you're sitting down with your arms folded just pressing play and listening to a tape and doing nothing it's it's going to be because you praise God it's going to be because you're willing to defy this flesh and all the circumstances around you even Satan himself and say I'm going to praise God and it's not going to be stopped by anything on this Earth nothing will stand between me and that word oh my the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Ghost was burning him up amen and I just want to say today brother brothers and sisters if you're willing to actually just go beyond the pain you know there's a minister that has said it I don't know if I've ever said his name before in the past but he says it quite often don't waste the pain when we have pain recognize it brothers and sisters it's for a purpose it's not so that we just get slapped around it's so that we can learn a lesson we get pain for a purpose don't waste the pain take that pain and turn it into praise if anybody has ever exercised here you know what I mean yes you're not doing anything until you feel pain your muscles aren't going to grow you're not going to do anything different in your life until you start to feel pain but boy when you start to feel pain the next few days you feel that pain when you're stretching your muscles out you're like man yeah I worked out all right I had a workout yeah I feel that pain it's the same thing sis sisters and brothers when when we exercise our faith we're going to feel pain the devil doesn't like it he's going to send more and more and more Temptations but you can just tell them come to church with me come on come on you can tempt me all week long but I want you to come and hear me praise praise the Living God you'll never get the praise that I have for him he says the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Ghost was burning him up amen he had to God's word's right we've got to write for them Redemptive blessings let's expect them believe them God is going to bring them to pass don't you believe it brothers and sisters in every everything give
