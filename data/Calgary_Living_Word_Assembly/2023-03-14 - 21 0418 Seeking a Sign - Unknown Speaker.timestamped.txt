[42:10] go all over the place but I just believe
[42:12] I have to follow the leadership of the
[42:14] Lord and when he speaks I have to follow
[42:17] it
[42:18] and uh
[42:19] I think we'll just continually sort of
[42:21] go around and around it and over top of
[42:24] these things and we'll just trust that
[42:26] the Lord will bless it
[42:28] in uh
[42:30] Matthew chapter 12 I'd like to begin
[42:32] reading with verse 38.
[42:34] just read verse 38.
[42:37] then certain of the scribes and of the
[42:41] Pharisees answered saying master
[42:44] we would see a sign from the
[42:49] let's just bow in prayer
[42:51] our gracious Lord Jesus
[42:54] we're so thankful father for your word
[42:57] we're so thankful for your leadership
[42:58] and your guidance we're so thankful that
[43:01] you have a program
[43:03] Lord and that you never change
[43:05] and that you are as immutable in your
[43:08] ways as you are in your thoughts
[43:10] and father the thoughts that you have
[43:13] towards us are of love and of peace
[43:17] and Lord you are not the author of
[43:18] confusion
[43:20] but you have given us
[43:22] power and a sound mind
[43:25] and father we just want to take your
[43:27] word this morning and apply it to our
[43:29] lives father we don't want to put it off
[43:31] on some other day and some other other
[43:33] people and and and and other families
[43:37] and other churches and other situations
[43:39] but Lord what does this word mean to us
[43:42] individually today I pray father that
[43:45] you would just break this this bread of
[43:47] life open to us fresh once again Lord
[43:50] that you would just speak to us that you
[43:52] would bring us a little higher in your
[43:54] word father
[43:55] we just ask all these things now in
[43:57] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[44:01] this morning I would like to speak on
[44:04] exactly what we read there
[44:07] seeing a sign
[44:10] God bless you this morning you may be
[44:11] seated
[44:15] please remember that we have a communion
[44:16] service this evening it's the first time
[44:18] in over a year
[44:20] we won't be having a foot washing here
[44:23] unfortunately but we're going to do
[44:26] everything that we can within our power
[44:29] to remain
[44:31] obedient to the law rendering unto
[44:33] Caesar what's his
[44:35] but giving unto God what's his also
[44:39] it's interesting because we can see
[44:42] churches all around now
[44:44] willing to
[44:46] break the rules and just go forwards
[44:50] and I'll tell you it's a struggle for me
[44:52] it really is I would say pray for me if
[44:55] you don't mind
[44:56] because I really
[44:58] struggle with it
[45:00] is this the place that we take a stand
[45:03] and actually go forwards
[45:06] it could be
[45:08] it could very well be
[45:10] we don't know what will happen in the
[45:12] future I don't know
[45:14] I'm not saying that I'm interested in
[45:15] doing that I don't want to I don't want
[45:17] to bring reproach upon the gospel
[45:21] I believe that what some of these people
[45:23] are doing they're actually potentially
[45:25] bringing reproach upon the gospel
[45:28] because it's not really a spiritual
[45:30] persecution they're not restricting our
[45:33] words
[45:35] they're just restricting gathering
[45:37] together and it's not necessarily
[45:38] exclusive to a church
[45:41] it's about human beings and a virus
[45:44] that's potentially being spread
[45:46] and
[45:48] we'll just see what the Lord has in
[45:50] store that's all I'll say
[45:52] let's pray for one another pray for me
[45:54] that he'll give me the leadership that
[45:56] we need
[45:57] and we'll just see what he'll do
[46:01] you know this morning I want to talk
[46:02] about the message greater than Solomon
[46:04] is here and a lot of the inspiration is
[46:07] from that one in
[46:09] 1964-03 0-6
[46:12] if you want to know some of the thoughts
[46:15] that are coming but it all kind of goes
[46:17] together and winds up being
[46:19] uh
[46:22] a new thing
[46:23] I'll just read this quote here brother
[46:25] Branham says now we find that he told
[46:28] them
[46:30] that a wicked and adulterous generation
[46:32] seeks after signs
[46:36] let's just continue on actually we'll
[46:39] read verse 38 but we'll just go on and
[46:40] read write up to verse 45.
[46:44] then certain of the scribes and of the
[46:45] Pharisees answered saying Master we
[46:47] would see a sign from thee but he
[46:50] answered and said unto them an evil and
[46:51] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[46:54] sign
[46:55] and there shall be no sign given to it
[46:57] but the sign of the Prophet Jonas
[47:01] for as Jonas was three days and three
[47:03] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[47:06] son of man be three days and three
[47:09] nights in the heart of the Earth
[47:11] the men of Nineveh shall rise in
[47:13] judgment with this generation
[47:15] and shall condemn it
[47:18] because they repented at the
[47:20] repeat at the preaching of Jonas and
[47:23] behold a greater than Jonas is here
[47:26] the queen of the South shall rise up in
[47:29] the Judgment with this generation and
[47:31] shall condemn it for she came from the
[47:34] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[47:36] wisdom of Solomon
[47:37] and behold a greater than Solomon is
[47:40] here
[47:42] when the unclean Spirit has gone out of
[47:44] a man isn't it interesting that he just
[47:46] has these these words right after this a
[47:48] greater than Solomon is here but verse
[47:50] 43 goes on to say when an unclean Spirit
[47:53] has gone out of a man he walketh through
[47:55] Dry places seeking rest and findeth none
[47:57] then he saith I will return into my
[48:00] house from whence I came out and when he
[48:03] has come he findeth it empty swept and
[48:06] garnished
[48:07] then goeth he and taketh with himself
[48:10] seven other Spirits more wicked than
[48:13] himself
[48:14] and they enter in and dwell there
[48:16] and the last state of the man is worse
[48:19] than the first
[48:20] even so
[48:22] shall it be also unto this wicked
[48:24] generation
[48:27] brothers and sisters
[48:30] let's get right to it right now we could
[48:32] sing a couple songs and go home don't
[48:34] seek after a sign
[48:37] you know it's interesting it sounds
[48:39] simple and and Elementary that I'd be
[48:41] saying that but
[48:43] I think it's important and I just
[48:44] believe the Lord brought me here
[48:46] I saw something happen recently and it's
[48:49] just been on my heart it's grieved me
[48:52] and I mentioned it to a brother but I I
[48:55] I I didn't know what to do with it and
[48:57] and I've seen it and I know that
[48:58] everyone around us has seen it to one
[49:00] degree or another
[49:03] I heard
[49:04] I heard that there is a group of people
[49:07] who are praying to their Pastor they're
[49:11] praying in the name of their pastor
[49:13] in this world today to believe the
[49:15] message of the hour so-called
[49:19] and you know
[49:21] sometimes I don't think we need to pray
[49:22] in the name of our pastor to actually
[49:25] exalt him to Lord status
[49:28] there's other people that are exalted to
[49:30] that level
[49:31] and you know
[49:33] it's terrible
[49:35] but what does it what causes it what's
[49:38] the root cause of it
[49:39] and and I just I've had this on my heart
[49:42] and so I I just felt led to go this way
[49:44] I believe it's because people seek after
[49:46] a sign
[49:49] people want to see the power of God
[49:51] manifest in in their life
[49:54] and we could say this way they want to
[49:56] see god with skin on
[49:59] and you know it's dangerous
[50:01] because Satan can impersonate any gift
[50:03] of God
[50:05] we don't want to seek after a sign we
[50:07] heard what Jesus said here reading about
[50:09] this but we're going to go a little
[50:10] further and dig into what the prophet
[50:12] said about this
[50:14] this thing about people getting exalted
[50:16] in this world there is nobody to exalt
[50:19] in this world except for Christ
[50:22] if there is a man who is a preacher who
[50:25] is a minister who is a leader he is a
[50:29] servant
[50:31] and if he's not a servant then he's in
[50:33] the wrong position
[50:35] he's got it wrong
[50:37] but I I wonder this really bothered me
[50:39] about this brother to see that people
[50:41] would actually be praying in his name
[50:43] and claim to believe the message of the
[50:46] hour how could that be
[50:48] but then there's other people that exalt
[50:50] other Ministries other men who maybe
[50:52] don't even Minister but but they just
[50:54] exalt them to such a high level high
[50:57] degree how could it be all around the
[50:59] guise of the message
[51:01] and how could they continue on doing
[51:03] that
[51:05] and then there's other parts of the
[51:07] message that aren't afraid to just come
[51:08] to the pulpit and just slam Hammer those
[51:11] people just come right up to him and
[51:13] call them out by name and and slam them
[51:15] to the ground
[51:16] and we know that the I and I believe
[51:19] this with all my heart the intention
[51:21] isn't to slam the person it's to slam
[51:23] the spirit to call the spirit out and
[51:25] discern it
[51:27] happens is people's lives get slammed
[51:31] and so I here I am
[51:34] standing here looking at this observing
[51:36] it just grieved in my heart how on Earth
[51:39] can it be such extreme one-way and such
[51:42] extreme the other way
[51:45] what are we coming to
[51:47] what causes it I believe it's because
[51:49] people seek a sign
[51:51] people look at the message of the hour
[51:53] and they say well William Branham he had
[51:55] he had a Healing Ministry and and if we
[51:58] believe the message of the hour then we
[52:00] should be able to just see a lightning
[52:02] bolt Healing Ministry in our midst and
[52:04] if we don't see that then maybe we just
[52:06] don't have the message of the hour the
[52:07] way that brother Branham brought it
[52:09] but I'm here to tell you brothers and
[52:11] sisters
[52:12] you do have the message of the hour the
[52:14] way William Mary and Branham brought it
[52:17] and it's not to seek after a sign is to
[52:20] seek after the word that's what brother
[52:22] Branham taught
[52:24] the word we have the word in its
[52:26] fullness
[52:28] but if we're seeking after a sign then
[52:30] you know what we're an evil and
[52:31] adulterous generation and that's what
[52:33] drives people to go this way and to
[52:35] behave this way maybe somebody came up
[52:37] in a prayer line and had hands laid on
[52:39] them and and they got prayed for and
[52:41] they got healed instantly and then they
[52:43] started to jump around and praise God
[52:45] and don't doubt for a second that that's
[52:47] not possible because that's entirely
[52:48] possible in fact I would expect to see
[52:51] that happen right here in Calgary
[52:53] but that's not the Vindication of the
[52:56] word
[52:56] that's not what we're after
[52:59] we're after the ability to receive the
[53:01] word
[53:02] to say that we have the fullness of the
[53:04] word to say that yes indeed there is a
[53:07] shout yes indeed there is a voice and
[53:09] where is that voice today brothers and
[53:10] sisters bring it right on down home that
[53:13] voice had better be in the bride that
[53:16] voice had better be in each one of our
[53:18] lives and if it's not we need to check
[53:20] up our experience make sure that we're
[53:22] in line with the message of the hour
[53:25] we don't want to get caught up in
[53:27] following a man if we're doing that
[53:29] brothers and sisters we're going to lose
[53:30] we're not going to wind up in the right
[53:33] location our GPS is skewed if we are
[53:37] following a man
[53:39] because the man that we many people
[53:41] would say we claim to follow he pointed
[53:43] to Christ
[53:46] but you know what happens and I just
[53:48] love how brother Branham how he just
[53:50] makes it so clear you know one of his
[53:52] quotes here he says that evil and lazy
[53:55] generation
[53:57] the word says adulterous but the prophet
[53:59] said lazy
[54:01] why do you think he said that many
[54:03] people would say oh it's just a mistake
[54:04] no there's no mistake he said it for a
[54:07] purpose
[54:08] that was an anointed servant of God
[54:10] preaching a word
[54:12] for a season and you know what it is
[54:14] it's lazy because people don't want to
[54:16] do the work for themselves it's easier
[54:18] just to follow a man and say well well
[54:20] he said that and and you know I'm going
[54:22] to go and stand before God someday and
[54:23] and say that that man told me to just go
[54:25] and jump off the cliff God that's what
[54:27] he told me to do he was your servant he
[54:28] had great signs and wonders God's not
[54:30] going to say oh okay don't worry it's
[54:32] fine you followed the man you you did
[54:35] that and he had great signs and wonders
[54:37] it's not going to be acceptable he's
[54:39] going to say you didn't you didn't
[54:40] follow my word by word was through my
[54:41] Prophet not through any other man not
[54:43] through any other Ministry not through
[54:45] any other way and that Prophet pointed
[54:48] to my word that's all
[54:51] but I had such a a burden on my heart
[54:54] with this when I saw this the one
[54:56] extreme Slam in them the other one
[54:58] saying you know I I I I I I don't know I
[55:01] don't accept it they they pray in in
[55:03] that way and and and yeah I've got a
[55:05] great ministry and I don't have to
[55:06] accept being slammed that way and and
[55:08] God has elevated me and and I am in a
[55:11] certain status
[55:12] what what a what a bunch of nonsense
[55:16] we're all brothers and sisters
[55:18] we're all equal
[55:20] there's no great one amongst us except
[55:22] for Christ Jesus and he is amongst us
[55:25] and the people that behave that way will
[55:27] stand and account for their behavior
[55:30] but you know what brother Branham said I
[55:32] just got into this in our in our study
[55:33] our Revelation study in Revelations
[55:36] chapter 5 part one if you listen to that
[55:38] message
[55:39] I was just listening to it because I was
[55:41] directing my thoughts about Revelations
[55:44] chapter five I wanted to see what the
[55:45] prophet had to say about it I really
[55:47] wanted to dig into it while I had this
[55:48] burden in my heart and if anybody has
[55:49] listened to that message recently I read
[55:51] it you know exactly where I'm going with
[55:53] this but if you haven't I'll tell you
[55:55] brother Branham spends the first 20
[55:57] minutes of this message explaining why
[55:59] he has to take himself off of the field
[56:02] of ministry in his day do you know why
[56:05] because people were elevating him to
[56:07] Christ
[56:10] so it was an answer for me it was a very
[56:13] clear answer for me
[56:15] these Ministries
[56:17] that are greatly elevated these
[56:18] Ministries that would see people pray in
[56:20] their names these Ministries that would
[56:23] say oh the people do it I don't do it
[56:25] but I don't actually step away from it I
[56:28] don't distance myself from and I just
[56:30] say oh I don't do it and I don't I don't
[56:31] allow them to do it
[56:33] the prophet for our day said I have to
[56:35] close my field office and take myself
[56:37] off the ministry field because you make
[56:39] me an antichrist and I will not allow
[56:42] that to happen to this word because this
[56:44] word is the truth and I will die for
[56:47] this word but because you do that I have
[56:49] to take myself off the ministry and
[56:51] guess what he did we all know he did
[56:53] took himself off the ministry for over a
[56:55] year
[56:57] because people elevated him to that
[56:58] level
[56:59] so what are these other brothers doing I
[57:01] say in the name of Jesus Christ what are
[57:04] these other brothers doing they believe
[57:05] the message of the hour they believe the
[57:07] prophet for our day but why aren't they
[57:10] actually stopping it and the only way
[57:12] that you can stop it that I can see
[57:14] according to what the prophet said is to
[57:15] just separate yourself and I thought
[57:17] what about myself what if I had a great
[57:19] ministry like that and people started to
[57:20] say oh let's pray in the name of brother
[57:22] Barry and and go to that place and it
[57:24] would get that way you know what I would
[57:25] have to do brothers and sisters I'd have
[57:27] to say you know what God has someone
[57:28] else to fill this position here because
[57:31] this is actually distracting the people
[57:32] from Christ it would have to be that way
[57:35] how could I ever think that I could come
[57:38] outside of the pattern that was laid out
[57:40] by the prophet for our day
[57:43] for me it was astounding to look at and
[57:45] for me it was the answer and and I
[57:47] wasn't even searching for it but I had
[57:49] this burden on my heart and you know
[57:50] what that's stuff like that just makes
[57:52] me want to do cartwheels and say thank
[57:54] you Lord because he's that concerned
[57:56] about our lives when we have a problem
[57:58] in our lives brothers and sisters seek
[58:01] the word you might not even know that
[58:03] you're going to find the lightning bolt
[58:05] answer for the question that you have in
[58:07] your heart but if you never open the
[58:09] word if you never press play how will
[58:11] you ever get it
[58:15] we have to do the work ourselves we have
[58:17] to give him the opportunity to speak to
[58:19] us he will speak to us it's through his
[58:21] word he'll speak to us
[58:23] it could be through another Ministry I'm
[58:25] not going to deny that I'm not going to
[58:26] say that you can stream anyone you want
[58:28] to it's just fine
[58:31] but just give him the opportunity give
[58:33] him the license that he desires in your
[58:35] life so that he can speak to you and
[58:37] bring his word
[58:39] or me I just found that astounding I'm
[58:41] just so thankful do you ever get fresh
[58:43] Revelation from God that was for me just
[58:45] this week fresh Revelation from God I
[58:47] just I'm so thankful when he does that
[58:49] it's so incredible
[58:52] the Bradham says now we find that he
[58:55] told them a wicked and adulterous
[58:57] generation seeks after signs how many
[59:00] times the unbeliever has taken advantage
[59:02] of this about scriptural signs and don't
[59:05] believe it God always speaks with signs
[59:08] he forever has he forever will as long
[59:10] as there's a world he'll still speak by
[59:13] spiritual signs he's foretold they would
[59:16] come
[59:18] you know I've been talking about it the
[59:21] cloud
[59:21] was a sign the cloud was a spiritual
[59:24] sign
[59:26] and we know that that became a a whole
[59:28] thing about a a website and everything
[59:31] to believe the sign and and what a bunch
[59:34] of nonsense that is but we know
[59:36] that an evil and adulterous generation
[59:38] seeketh after a sign and that's why all
[59:41] of the rubbish that you would hear there
[59:43] is all about trying to denounce
[59:47] the sign that God gave us
[59:49] which was a prophet for our day someone
[59:52] that would actually bring the
[59:53] Vindication the Vindicated word that we
[59:56] need to get our our bodies changed to
[59:58] get us out of here
[1:00:00] he says now many of the unbelievers take
[1:00:04] that when he said a wicked and or a weak
[1:00:09] and adulterous generation seeks after
[1:00:11] signs watch he was speaking in a
[1:00:14] compound prophecy here
[1:00:16] he was also telling them that they were
[1:00:20] a weak and adulterous generation
[1:00:23] and also telling them that any weak and
[1:00:26] adulterous generation and one that would
[1:00:29] come
[1:00:30] would receive a sign
[1:00:33] we don't want to be a weak
[1:00:36] an adulterous generation
[1:00:39] notice he said a weak an adulterous
[1:00:42] generation seeketh after a sign and
[1:00:44] there shall be no sign given to it
[1:00:46] but the sign of Jonah for as Jonah was
[1:00:49] in the belly of the whale for three days
[1:00:51] and nights so must the son of man be in
[1:00:53] the heart of the Earth for three days
[1:00:56] and nights and we know that he was both
[1:00:58] of them were
[1:00:59] what was he saying here he was saying
[1:01:02] that a wicked and adulterous generation
[1:01:05] would receive
[1:01:06] the sign of the Resurrection
[1:01:10] but brothers and sisters when that
[1:01:12] happens
[1:01:12] it's too late
[1:01:15] don't seek a sign
[1:01:17] don't say that when I see an American
[1:01:20] Pope
[1:01:21] don't say when I see a a woman dressed
[1:01:25] in purple
[1:01:27] don't say when I when I see the mark of
[1:01:30] the beast
[1:01:31] don't say when I when I see two prophets
[1:01:34] in Israel
[1:01:36] don't seek a sign don't say when I see
[1:01:39] God move in my life in a certain way
[1:01:42] no
[1:01:43] first we have to act then we'll see God
[1:01:46] the word says to seek ye first the
[1:01:48] kingdom of God
[1:01:51] he said and what other age have we ever
[1:01:54] come to anymore than it is right now to
[1:01:58] a christ-rejecting wicked perverted
[1:02:01] adulterous generation
[1:02:04] and they will receive a sign the sign of
[1:02:07] the Resurrection that Jesus Christ is
[1:02:09] alive tonight just as much as he ever
[1:02:12] was he has raised from the dead making
[1:02:15] him the same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:18] a weak and an adulterous generation
[1:02:20] seeks after a sign and they'll get it
[1:02:24] and the sign will be the sign of the
[1:02:26] Resurrection
[1:02:28] now of course he was speaking to them
[1:02:30] that he would raise up from the dead
[1:02:37] we don't want to seek after a sign
[1:02:40] we're going to be sign Seekers
[1:02:42] we want to see the move of God in our
[1:02:44] lives
[1:02:45] but don't let the sign of God's wondrous
[1:02:48] grace and mercy be the sign that's going
[1:02:51] to move us
[1:02:52] because if that's what we're looking for
[1:02:54] we've missed it we've missed the entire
[1:02:56] point of it
[1:02:57] what we're looking for is our ability to
[1:02:59] receive the word for our day that's the
[1:03:01] true baptism of the Holy Spirit not
[1:03:04] being able to lay our hands on the sick
[1:03:05] and seeing them recover even though that
[1:03:07] happens not being able to drink any
[1:03:09] deadly thing and having it not harm us
[1:03:10] not being able to raise from the dead
[1:03:13] though we will
[1:03:15] it's none of that
[1:03:16] it's being able to receive the word for
[1:03:18] our day being able to receive the token
[1:03:20] being able to receive the baptism of the
[1:03:22] Holy Spirit and you know when we get to
[1:03:24] that place then it just becomes a place
[1:03:25] of rest
[1:03:26] not laboring not trying to promote or or
[1:03:30] do
[1:03:32] you know the only sign that this
[1:03:34] generation will see is a rapture
[1:03:36] and a resurrection
[1:03:38] and by then only the people who actually
[1:03:41] have the token we'll see it
[1:03:44] there might be some who actually observe
[1:03:47] it from a different perspective
[1:03:49] who wonder what happened to all the
[1:03:50] people that used to come to church here
[1:03:52] did they go and start their own church
[1:03:54] somewhere
[1:03:55] we know that in the Days of Elijah and
[1:03:57] Elisha the sons of the prophets they
[1:03:59] said let's send men and go and see where
[1:04:02] Elijah went because he must have gone
[1:04:03] somewhere he had to have gone somewhere
[1:04:06] and Elisha the prophet told them no no
[1:04:09] no he's gone
[1:04:11] but you see they couldn't actually
[1:04:13] understand The Changing of the Guard
[1:04:15] they couldn't understand the blending of
[1:04:17] the ages they couldn't understand the
[1:04:19] moving of the scepter they couldn't
[1:04:21] understand the moving of the voice going
[1:04:23] from one man to the other and that's
[1:04:25] where we're at today brothers and
[1:04:26] sisters is that the moving of the voices
[1:04:28] happen now the voice has gone from being
[1:04:31] in the prophet to being in the bride the
[1:04:33] many membered body the ones who actually
[1:04:35] have the Holy Ghost in their lives and
[1:04:37] speak the word
[1:04:38] and and these other people that we see
[1:04:40] it's it's it's troubling to look around
[1:04:43] and see people get elevated to any other
[1:04:46] level than brother or sister
[1:04:48] we have to be careful we don't want to
[1:04:50] elevate any Ministry
[1:04:52] any Ministry that is after Christ would
[1:04:54] say don't talk about me talk about
[1:04:56] Christ
[1:04:57] worship Him
[1:04:59] we know that twice in the Book of
[1:05:01] Revelations John fell down to worship
[1:05:05] that guide that he had in heaven and he
[1:05:07] said see thou do it not don't worship me
[1:05:10] I'm of thy fellow Brethren thy servants
[1:05:12] worship God
[1:05:15] so where do these other people actually
[1:05:18] find themselves today how on Earth could
[1:05:20] that possibly be
[1:05:23] it's terrible
[1:05:26] but the random goes on to say in this
[1:05:27] message that scripture has a compound
[1:05:29] meaning
[1:05:30] it's real important to understand that
[1:05:31] too I believe that scripture has a
[1:05:33] compound meaning so when we talk about
[1:05:35] this evil and adulterous generation in
[1:05:37] Jonah's day we can look forward and and
[1:05:39] see it in our day and know that there
[1:05:41] are people that seeks after a sign and
[1:05:43] you know maybe inside a message church
[1:05:45] people there isn't a great move for
[1:05:46] people to seek after a sign but maybe
[1:05:48] there is I believe there is in certain
[1:05:50] circumstances because people are
[1:05:52] actually elevating men to levels that
[1:05:55] they shouldn't be
[1:05:57] they really are
[1:05:58] and I think the further that we go down
[1:06:00] this road the more that we're going to
[1:06:01] see that
[1:06:02] and
[1:06:04] it's troubling
[1:06:06] I'm not trying to promote them I'm not
[1:06:08] saying go look at them I'm just saying
[1:06:10] that we don't want to seek after a sign
[1:06:13] don't look for a sign look for the
[1:06:16] Vindication of the word in your life
[1:06:17] look for God to give you fresh
[1:06:19] Revelation because he will if we give
[1:06:21] him the opportunity brother Branham in
[1:06:23] this message he says that scripture has
[1:06:25] a compound meaning many times scripture
[1:06:27] has its common or its compound meaning
[1:06:29] like in Matthew 3. it's said that it
[1:06:32] might be fulfilled which was spoken of
[1:06:35] the Lord
[1:06:36] by the prophet saying out of Egypt I
[1:06:39] called my son
[1:06:41] now if you refer that back it's to Hosea
[1:06:44] and he prophesied that out of Egypt he
[1:06:47] called God's son which was Israel
[1:06:50] Jacob was God's son and he called him
[1:06:52] out of Egypt that's where the reference
[1:06:55] runs you to
[1:06:57] but also Christ was his greater son and
[1:07:00] he called him out Israel being a type
[1:07:02] and so that being a type of rejecting
[1:07:05] Christ in that generation
[1:07:07] this is a greater type
[1:07:09] for that generation
[1:07:12] that rejected the resurrection
[1:07:15] had pardoned but this generation who
[1:07:18] makes fun of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:20] is impardonable
[1:07:23] to think about that
[1:07:27] just want to read that again for that
[1:07:29] generation that rejected the
[1:07:31] resurrection
[1:07:32] had pardoned but this generation who
[1:07:35] makes fun of the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:38] impardonable
[1:07:40] I'll say it a few times as we go this
[1:07:42] morning be very very very careful
[1:07:45] what we say about a brother or a sister
[1:07:48] because we don't know
[1:07:50] if that's God or if that's the devil
[1:07:53] working through them we don't want to
[1:07:55] say that the work of God the work of the
[1:07:57] Holy Ghost and a brother or sister's
[1:07:59] life is actually of the devil that
[1:08:02] they're wrong because it could easily be
[1:08:04] God moving in their lives
[1:08:07] and if we want to take an example of
[1:08:09] that
[1:08:10] let's look at that backslider
[1:08:12] Jonah
[1:08:16] I'll just throw it out there like that
[1:08:18] and I'll stop I just want to continue
[1:08:19] reading here there's just more in this
[1:08:21] quote I'll just read this again though
[1:08:23] for that generation that rejected the
[1:08:25] resurrection had pardoned but this
[1:08:27] generation who makes fun of the Holy
[1:08:29] Ghost is impardonable
[1:08:32] where greater is he that rejects the
[1:08:34] Holy Spirit than he that rejects Jesus
[1:08:37] Christ in the days of his flesh on Earth
[1:08:40] Jesus said so you speak the son of man
[1:08:42] when they said he was a fortune teller
[1:08:45] or some evil spirit said you speak
[1:08:47] against the son of man it shall be
[1:08:49] forgiven you but whoever speaks a word
[1:08:51] against the Holy Ghost shall never be
[1:08:54] forgiven them in this world that is
[1:08:57] called the working of the Holy Ghost an
[1:09:00] evil unclean thing when they see the
[1:09:02] work of God being done
[1:09:05] there's people that do that in our day
[1:09:08] now you might say well you just said
[1:09:10] that about brother so and so or whoever
[1:09:12] the other Ministries are that you're
[1:09:13] referring to and you know what I I'm not
[1:09:15] saying that I trust that they're on the
[1:09:17] move of God but the thing I am saying is
[1:09:19] it troubles me that they would allow
[1:09:21] people to magnify them to elevate them
[1:09:24] to a certain level where they're
[1:09:26] actually being worshiped
[1:09:28] and not separate themselves from it
[1:09:31] that's up to God to discern but brothers
[1:09:33] and sisters just I'm just saying beware
[1:09:37] it's around us we can see it it's alive
[1:09:40] and it's not the right way I'll say it
[1:09:43] that way
[1:09:45] but to look at a brother or sister and
[1:09:47] say they're wrong
[1:09:49] be careful
[1:09:52] be careful
[1:09:54] it could be the holy ghost moving in
[1:09:55] their lives
[1:09:57] we don't want to ever ever overstep we
[1:10:00] want to be cautious when we're speaking
[1:10:02] about our brothers or our sisters
[1:10:04] you know when Jonah he was sent
[1:10:07] to the people of Nineveh
[1:10:10] people say that that guy was a
[1:10:12] backslider
[1:10:14] that he was backslidden
[1:10:16] brother Branham said that he was in the
[1:10:18] will of God
[1:10:24] can you imagine that haven't God tell
[1:10:26] you to do something and you just go and
[1:10:28] do something totally different
[1:10:30] oh my
[1:10:32] imagine how he must have felt he must
[1:10:34] have felt like a backslider
[1:10:36] because he said in the midst of that
[1:10:37] storm just by my hands and my feet throw
[1:10:39] me overboard I'm done
[1:10:41] did he know that there was going to be a
[1:10:43] fish there
[1:10:44] to submarine him and take him away in
[1:10:47] the midst of the tumultuous storm just
[1:10:49] behind my hands and my feet because then
[1:10:50] I know that I won't be able to swim and
[1:10:52] I know that I'll sink like a rock I
[1:10:54] won't be able to save myself and I don't
[1:10:55] deserve to be saved that's probably what
[1:10:57] was in his heart I am I'm a horrible
[1:11:00] horrible man I know that God called me I
[1:11:03] know that I'm a minor Prophet I know
[1:11:05] that he sent me and I just I just deny
[1:11:07] it and and I just went this way and now
[1:11:09] I've brought this reproach upon this
[1:11:11] entire ship and everyone that's on it
[1:11:13] and everyone could potentially perish at
[1:11:16] my mistake so just bind me up and throw
[1:11:19] me overboard I am a filthy Sinner and
[1:11:22] you know what all the church around him
[1:11:24] would have said the same thing wouldn't
[1:11:26] they have
[1:11:27] they would have said he's just terrible
[1:11:29] look at that guy look what he's brought
[1:11:30] upon everyone how could he do that to
[1:11:32] the body of Christ throw him overboard
[1:11:35] let him perish
[1:11:37] but this is a man who is in the will of
[1:11:39] God is what the prophet said
[1:11:42] many people tried to condemn Jonah and
[1:11:44] say oh he everybody he was a Jonah
[1:11:49] how many times have we ever heard that
[1:11:50] he was a Jonah I've been a Jonah or or
[1:11:53] or they're a Jonah they're running from
[1:11:54] God
[1:11:56] oh everybody he was a Jonah Jonah was a
[1:11:59] prophet
[1:12:00] he was walking exactly in the will of
[1:12:03] God
[1:12:05] how can we look at something like this
[1:12:07] hear the prophet say that and not
[1:12:09] believe in predestination
[1:12:11] not believe in the foreknowledge of God
[1:12:13] God knew exactly what he would do when
[1:12:15] he asked him to go there
[1:12:17] and he knew exactly when he would do it
[1:12:19] so he created the exact circumstances
[1:12:22] that he would need he created a fish
[1:12:24] that would be there at the exact moment
[1:12:27] that he needed to be
[1:12:29] to catch his prophet
[1:12:31] and save him
[1:12:33] and get him to go and actually begin to
[1:12:36] to to write down the the message that he
[1:12:39] did which would which would create the
[1:12:41] the story that we heard even though
[1:12:43] while he had we've heard the story told
[1:12:45] many times where he was in the in the
[1:12:47] belly of the whale and probably dealing
[1:12:49] with all the stomach bile and all the
[1:12:50] nasty stuff down there and and and
[1:12:53] seaweed wrapped around his neck and his
[1:12:55] eyes and his face and the circumstances
[1:12:57] that was all around him remembering that
[1:12:59] he ran from God not understanding what
[1:13:01] was going on why he wasn't dead yet his
[1:13:04] hands were bound and his feet was bound
[1:13:06] inside this this fish in the ocean and
[1:13:09] he wasn't dead yet
[1:13:11] but what did he say
[1:13:13] that all of this is lying vanities
[1:13:15] if I can just look towards the temple
[1:13:18] once again and just worship
[1:13:21] then I know that God will save me
[1:13:25] he had that in his heart there was that
[1:13:28] one part of him that there was just no
[1:13:30] way that that could change his resolve
[1:13:32] nothing could change that from him it
[1:13:34] was his innermost core
[1:13:36] my
[1:13:38] but then look at it how the entire city
[1:13:42] the sign we're talking about the sign
[1:13:44] today signs
[1:13:46] how perfect God is in everything that he
[1:13:49] does so this man who is running from God
[1:13:51] who is maybe potentially a backslider
[1:13:54] though the prophet said he was perfectly
[1:13:56] in the will of God he was swallowed by a
[1:13:59] fish and then he was sent back to
[1:14:01] Nineveh the people of Nineveh where did
[1:14:03] the fish spit him up it was on the beach
[1:14:05] in front of Nineveh what did the people
[1:14:08] of Nineveh worship
[1:14:10] fish
[1:14:11] right and so had he not backslidden had
[1:14:14] he not ran away and been swallowed by a
[1:14:17] fish they never would have received him
[1:14:20] right we know this is what the prophet
[1:14:22] taught but I just wanted to bring it out
[1:14:25] here but they worshiped a fish it was
[1:14:27] their very Idol that brought them the
[1:14:30] word for their day
[1:14:32] it's amazing to think about how
[1:14:34] Sovereign God is and then if we just
[1:14:36] fast forward through it all I don't want
[1:14:38] to spend a lot of time there this
[1:14:39] morning but just to bring it out a
[1:14:40] little bit what happened
[1:14:42] the city received the profit they
[1:14:45] received the word of God and they'd
[1:14:46] followed the instruction they repented
[1:14:49] they received the word and they repented
[1:14:51] and they were saved and that's why Jesus
[1:14:54] was saying that you know an evil and
[1:14:56] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[1:14:58] sign we know that the the Pharisees and
[1:15:01] the Sadducees were coming at Jesus that
[1:15:03] day saying oh Master would you just
[1:15:05] please work a miracle for us just show
[1:15:07] us something that that that you are who
[1:15:10] you say you are or that at least who the
[1:15:12] people say you are and what did he say
[1:15:14] to them
[1:15:15] an evil and adulterous generation
[1:15:17] seeketh after a sign and what does the
[1:15:19] men of today who are actually becoming
[1:15:22] elevated to those places come to what do
[1:15:24] they do
[1:15:25] they might just do it
[1:15:27] they might just say well stick around a
[1:15:29] little while and and and you'll see
[1:15:32] do they say to the people that an evil
[1:15:35] and adulterous generation seeketh after
[1:15:37] a sign and if that's what you're looking
[1:15:38] for then I've got to take myself off the
[1:15:40] field I can't stand behind the pulp and
[1:15:43] administer this gospel anymore because
[1:15:45] what it's doing is leading people away
[1:15:47] from Christ and leading them to me I
[1:15:50] don't know
[1:15:51] I personally believe it should be
[1:15:56] but what was the message that he was
[1:15:58] given to give to the people of Nineveh
[1:16:00] repent
[1:16:01] just repent
[1:16:03] just get right with God throw away your
[1:16:06] Idols smash all of the things that you
[1:16:08] think you know your traditions and
[1:16:09] everything cut down the high places get
[1:16:12] rid of the Groves smash everything to
[1:16:14] bits and just get oil in your lamps
[1:16:16] follow the word of the Lord for your day
[1:16:20] and they did
[1:16:22] and it's interesting because this man
[1:16:24] that was in the will of God he actually
[1:16:26] was upset because they repented in the
[1:16:29] end it's so bizarre
[1:16:32] but it's God's way
[1:16:35] you know still today people would judge
[1:16:37] him and say that he was he was outside
[1:16:39] of God's will
[1:16:41] but thanks be to God for a prophet in
[1:16:43] our day that would just bring
[1:16:44] clarification for this stuff and make it
[1:16:46] understandable for us that we would see
[1:16:48] God has a plan for every one of our
[1:16:51] lives and many times Our Lives can seem
[1:16:53] like they're just twisting spiraling out
[1:16:55] of control and maybe somewhere along the
[1:16:58] way we're going to think back and say
[1:16:59] where did I backslide what did I do you
[1:17:02] know what God's doing he's just bringing
[1:17:03] us to a place where he can use us
[1:17:06] he wants to get all of the us out of us
[1:17:09] and once he does that then he's going to
[1:17:12] take us and use us in a mighty way and I
[1:17:15] believe it brothers and sisters we sang
[1:17:16] that song this morning but do we really
[1:17:18] believe that song I surely hope we do
[1:17:20] but I hope the Lord would just make it
[1:17:22] so clear to us that we are that
[1:17:24] generation we're the ones that he chose
[1:17:27] to take and share this word with
[1:17:30] how many people in this world haven't
[1:17:32] heard of the message of the hour
[1:17:36] it's probably seven point
[1:17:39] eight nine billion people
[1:17:42] I looked it up and there's 7.9 billion
[1:17:45] people in the world today I thought it
[1:17:47] was only 7.5 billion people
[1:17:50] 7.9 billion people probably by this time
[1:17:53] next year it'll be eight billion people
[1:17:55] it's growing at such an exponential rate
[1:18:00] it's amazing
[1:18:02] he's chosen us to be the voice the final
[1:18:05] voice to the final age some people would
[1:18:08] say oh no that was only William Mary and
[1:18:10] Branham but if that's the case then we
[1:18:12] have missed the entire point of the
[1:18:13] message of the our brothers and sisters
[1:18:14] he brought a message and that message
[1:18:17] was for Christ to take a bride of his
[1:18:18] own choosing and she has been given the
[1:18:22] word the entire word
[1:18:24] and she
[1:18:26] her the female
[1:18:28] the bride of Christ will simply say the
[1:18:31] same thing that Mary said just be it
[1:18:33] unto me according to Thy word let that
[1:18:36] seed come into my womb and actually
[1:18:38] manifest Let It Grow and when that
[1:18:41] happens in the life of a Believer then
[1:18:44] the old person dies it takes a while it
[1:18:47] doesn't happen right away but that life
[1:18:49] begins to grow when when when when the
[1:18:52] bride who has received that seed she
[1:18:54] begins to nourish that seed she feeds it
[1:18:57] with the word of God she presses play
[1:18:58] she comes to church she worships the
[1:19:01] Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit only feeds on
[1:19:04] the Holy Spirit when that Holy Spirit
[1:19:06] seed has been planted inside a human
[1:19:09] being when that seed gets watered by the
[1:19:11] things we've just described brothers and
[1:19:13] sisters there's a new life that comes
[1:19:15] forward inside that person and the old
[1:19:17] person dies out
[1:19:19] and if we don't feed that seed
[1:19:21] then the old person still might live
[1:19:24] and then you wind up with two heads
[1:19:27] we know that James said that a
[1:19:29] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[1:19:31] his ways and that's what he was
[1:19:32] referring to the old man's still alive
[1:19:35] that old man still keeps coming back and
[1:19:37] and still keeps coming back and still
[1:19:39] keeps coming back we've got to kill him
[1:19:42] how do we kill him
[1:19:43] how do we kill him brother Barry I'll
[1:19:45] tell you how you kill him feed on the
[1:19:47] word we talked about it on Wednesday
[1:19:49] just like a really lushly grown grass
[1:19:52] many times they don't even put weed
[1:19:54] treatment on that grass they just
[1:19:56] nourish the grass they fertilize the
[1:19:58] grass they water the grass they cut the
[1:20:00] grass and every once in a while there's
[1:20:02] a weed that pops up and they can just
[1:20:04] get rid of it but they don't have to go
[1:20:06] and combat weeds every day they're
[1:20:07] focusing on for feeding the grass
[1:20:09] nourishing the grass and what happens is
[1:20:12] it chokes out all the weeds the weeds
[1:20:13] have nowhere to grow it's the same thing
[1:20:15] in a life of a Believer if we just fill
[1:20:17] our lives with the word of God if we
[1:20:19] fill our lives with the message of the
[1:20:21] hour if we fill our lives with prayer
[1:20:23] and songs singing in our hearts
[1:20:26] continually making Melody unto the Lord
[1:20:29] then all of the stuff of the world just
[1:20:31] grows strangely dim
[1:20:33] it just starts to fade away and we just
[1:20:36] will think one day why didn't I like to
[1:20:38] used to watch that show all the time it
[1:20:40] just doesn't do it for me anymore didn't
[1:20:42] I like do you remember when I used to
[1:20:43] listen to that music my I'm just a
[1:20:45] little bit embarrassed by that I hope
[1:20:47] many people don't remember that you know
[1:20:49] these things happen in our lives they
[1:20:51] just Begin to Fall Away brothers and
[1:20:53] sisters it's not even something that we
[1:20:54] do and that's why it's so important to
[1:20:56] recognize it's not something that we do
[1:20:58] it's not a sign we can't go and do this
[1:21:02] on our own we have to allow the Lord to
[1:21:04] do it but when he does it he does it
[1:21:06] right he does it all the way there's no
[1:21:08] going back
[1:21:10] look at Abraham and his life just one
[1:21:13] one thing and I I I trust it's okay I'm
[1:21:15] not meaning to throw off on people
[1:21:17] characters in The Bible but Abraham
[1:21:19] remember he was a liar
[1:21:21] he lied twice to save his own hide
[1:21:24] but what did God say to that man who was
[1:21:27] backslidden down in Egypt right he lied
[1:21:30] while he was there to save his own hide
[1:21:32] but he said you know what God Said to
[1:21:34] the King give him back his wife and he
[1:21:37] said oh you know the Integrity of my
[1:21:38] heart I would never go and do that he
[1:21:39] said that's why I'm telling you give him
[1:21:41] back his wife and then when you do get
[1:21:43] my Prophet to pray for you get that liar
[1:21:45] to pray for you and I'll accept his
[1:21:47] prayer on your behalf God is sovereign
[1:21:51] we don't ever want to say that God
[1:21:53] should be or shouldn't be a certain way
[1:21:54] he's only obligated to be by his word
[1:21:56] and we have to judge the actions that we
[1:21:58] see in this life by his word that's our
[1:22:01] compass
[1:22:06] in Matthew 12
[1:22:08] 42-45 he talks about the queen of the
[1:22:10] South
[1:22:11] and how desirous she was
[1:22:15] to come and see the wisdom of Solomon
[1:22:19] how she was taught the message of the
[1:22:21] hour in her day in a foreign land how
[1:22:24] she was taught that there would be
[1:22:26] Messiah
[1:22:28] just like the woman at the well she was
[1:22:30] taught that there would be Messiah these
[1:22:33] these these ladies had had an
[1:22:35] understanding something had told them
[1:22:37] that there would be the great one would
[1:22:39] be in our midst and and she desired to
[1:22:43] come and hear more about the wisdom of
[1:22:45] Solomon how could he have such wisdom
[1:22:47] because he didn't speak of himself
[1:22:50] he spoke about someone greater
[1:22:53] he spoke about the God of Israel
[1:22:57] and he talked about him in many
[1:22:58] different ways
[1:23:00] but she knew about this and she desired
[1:23:02] you know brother Brown I mean really
[1:23:03] explains it in this message that I'm not
[1:23:05] going to get too far into it today but
[1:23:07] he he really takes the time to explain
[1:23:09] how dedicated she was to come and hear
[1:23:12] the Solomon wisdom the wisdom that God
[1:23:15] gave Solomon we know that was the only
[1:23:16] thing that Solomon asked God said what
[1:23:18] would you desire and he said I just want
[1:23:19] wisdom and God said okay you could have
[1:23:21] it and he gave him the greatest wisdom
[1:23:23] no man has ever been as wise as Solomon
[1:23:26] and ever will be I think is what the
[1:23:28] word says
[1:23:29] but this man Solomon had such great
[1:23:31] wisdom and she desired to hear it
[1:23:34] and so she went she put away all of her
[1:23:38] stuff and said I'm gonna go I'm going to
[1:23:40] go and learn about this man
[1:23:42] but you know what Jesus said she will
[1:23:45] rise up in judgment against this
[1:23:48] generation why
[1:23:49] because a greater than Solomon is
[1:23:52] standing right before you the greatest
[1:23:53] sign that you shall ever see is standing
[1:23:57] right before you right now right before
[1:23:58] your very eyes and you're missing it
[1:24:02] brothers and sisters just to fast
[1:24:04] forward today
[1:24:05] the greatest sign that we're ever going
[1:24:07] to see is the opening of the word
[1:24:10] that's the greatest sign that we're ever
[1:24:11] going to see
[1:24:13] don't think that we're going to see some
[1:24:14] great other healing campaign or great
[1:24:17] Revival or or great anything because
[1:24:19] we've seen the greatest the greatest
[1:24:21] sign is the opening of the word to our
[1:24:23] day and that's it not a healing campaign
[1:24:26] not not to see you know and it's
[1:24:28] fantastic to look back and see it all
[1:24:30] the stuff that we've heard about in
[1:24:32] South Africa someone was talking about
[1:24:33] it recently and and how many truckloads
[1:24:36] of of canes and crutches and stretchers
[1:24:38] and wheelchairs did they haul out in in
[1:24:41] South Africa when brother Bradham was
[1:24:43] there and and they had all those people
[1:24:45] marching down the street and I think
[1:24:47] they said to him brother Branham take a
[1:24:48] look out the window and see this here
[1:24:50] all the people who are lame and and
[1:24:52] withered and halt were now marching down
[1:24:54] the street saying and only believe
[1:24:57] that's a great sign
[1:24:59] but that's not the greatest sign
[1:25:02] the greatest sign is the opening of the
[1:25:04] word
[1:25:05] but what's what's just as great as that
[1:25:07] brothers and sisters
[1:25:09] this is really where it gets down to the
[1:25:11] rubber meets the road this is what we
[1:25:12] call the brass tax what's what's just as
[1:25:15] great as that greatest sign
[1:25:18] just as great is the ability to receive
[1:25:21] it
[1:25:22] understanding the greatest sign is the
[1:25:24] opening of the word is one thing
[1:25:27] but if we don't use it if we don't
[1:25:30] accept it if we don't take it as a
[1:25:33] pardon as a pardon is offered to us then
[1:25:35] what good is it it's a pretty good sign
[1:25:38] it's fantastic
[1:25:40] but it's got to be for a certain
[1:25:42] generation
[1:25:43] The Chosen generation there's got to be
[1:25:45] a people that say hey man I'll just
[1:25:47] accept that I'll take it just exactly
[1:25:49] the way it says it and I don't
[1:25:51] understand it but I'll take it
[1:25:54] you know brother Bradham he had the
[1:25:55] first two polls of his ministry and I
[1:25:57] think that in the message of the hour
[1:25:58] just what I've seen is almost like if we
[1:26:00] don't see the same exact manifestation
[1:26:03] that brother Branham saw in his healing
[1:26:06] campaigns in our own lives then somehow
[1:26:08] we've missed it but no you haven't
[1:26:10] missed it if you don't just lay your
[1:26:12] hands on someone and see them rise up
[1:26:14] and and get well and so on it doesn't
[1:26:17] mean that you haven't received the word
[1:26:19] for your day
[1:26:20] because the greatest sign that we have
[1:26:22] is the opening of the word for our day
[1:26:25] we know brother Branham had the first
[1:26:27] two polls and they were the bait
[1:26:30] that's what was said I believe it was
[1:26:32] brother Bosworth that said it to brother
[1:26:34] Branham someone said that it was the
[1:26:35] bait on the end of the hook
[1:26:37] and the reason for it was so that people
[1:26:40] could actually be listening now to this
[1:26:43] prophet's Ministry now they've actually
[1:26:44] got the attention the prophet has the
[1:26:46] attention the Lord has the attention of
[1:26:48] the people through the prophet through
[1:26:50] the sign
[1:26:52] but it wasn't that that wasn't the
[1:26:55] message the message was the voice behind
[1:26:58] the sign the message was come out of her
[1:27:01] my people and be ye not partakers
[1:27:04] of her sins
[1:27:06] come out of the church denominations and
[1:27:09] come up just a little higher come into
[1:27:11] Christ
[1:27:13] but you know it was when he sat down and
[1:27:15] started to declare that
[1:27:17] that they said oh no no no no this guy's
[1:27:21] just gone off he's gone off he's not
[1:27:24] following the traditional teachings of
[1:27:26] of of the denominations how could we
[1:27:28] ever do that he's not willing to be a
[1:27:30] part of The ecumenical council there's
[1:27:32] no way that it could actually be of God
[1:27:34] but that's the same exact thing going
[1:27:37] right back to our scripture this morning
[1:27:39] master
[1:27:41] show us a sign we would that that thou
[1:27:43] would just
[1:27:45] give unto us a sign
[1:27:47] you know the one brother said to brother
[1:27:48] batam this might be blind and he said
[1:27:51] how could I
[1:27:52] you already are
[1:27:54] remember we talked about spiritual
[1:27:56] blindness
[1:27:57] people can be blind we could completely
[1:27:59] miss the moving of God in our lives if
[1:28:02] we're not carefully in tune with the
[1:28:05] word for our day
[1:28:07] it was the third poll that brother
[1:28:08] Branham gave and that was simply this
[1:28:11] the opening of the word
[1:28:14] just the opening of the word to us not a
[1:28:17] great sign not a great Wonder not not
[1:28:19] the raising of the dead and the healing
[1:28:20] of the sick and and the casting out of
[1:28:23] devils all of those things happen all of
[1:28:26] those things we we will if God permits
[1:28:28] but you know what let's move on to
[1:28:30] perfection
[1:28:31] let's get into Christ
[1:28:33] let's get all the way into knowing the
[1:28:36] ABCs are in place the foundation is set
[1:28:39] so that we can move into algebra we can
[1:28:41] move into the the higher way of thinking
[1:28:43] the the greater Revelation and really
[1:28:45] what is that greater Revelation it's
[1:28:47] that I am my father are one and that's
[1:28:49] where they wanted to Stone Jesus and
[1:28:51] that's where the shuck will pull away
[1:28:53] from the seed in our day
[1:28:55] remember the seed doesn't fall away from
[1:28:56] the shock
[1:28:58] it's the opposite the shuck pulls away
[1:29:00] from the seed
[1:29:02] that sign was given just before Sodom
[1:29:07] was judged
[1:29:10] sorry
[1:29:13] there was a sign that was given just
[1:29:15] before Sodom was judged
[1:29:17] and we know what sign that was
[1:29:20] discernment of the heart
[1:29:22] and and that was clearly given in our
[1:29:24] day
[1:29:25] the first and the second pull and what
[1:29:27] was that
[1:29:28] to usher in the third pole Ministry it
[1:29:32] was to usher in the identification
[1:29:34] according to the word of the son of man
[1:29:37] Ministry to show the world the son of
[1:29:40] man
[1:29:41] is back
[1:29:43] it's not just a cloven lick of fire over
[1:29:46] top of the heads of people it's not just
[1:29:48] an Azusa Street Revival it literally is
[1:29:52] the coming of the son of man and now
[1:29:54] where is he brothers and sisters it's a
[1:29:57] many-membered body remember
[1:29:59] that's why we need to be very careful
[1:30:01] don't stumble at the flesh don't
[1:30:04] so and so and my sister so and so say
[1:30:07] it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:09] you know we say it many times when we
[1:30:12] come and we'll have a communion foot
[1:30:14] washing and we'll wash one another's
[1:30:16] feet remember that we're washing one
[1:30:17] another's feet do we remember that when
[1:30:19] we're having a conversation around the
[1:30:20] dinner table about our brother or sister
[1:30:23] is it the same way because it better be
[1:30:26] when we're driving with our family in a
[1:30:28] car and and brother so-and-so or sister
[1:30:30] so and so are we having that same
[1:30:32] conversation we need to make our yay and
[1:30:34] our nay nay we we don't want to be
[1:30:36] double-minded we want to have the exact
[1:30:38] same testimony we have in church at a
[1:30:40] foot washing that our communion table
[1:30:42] where we take such reverence for it that
[1:30:45] we would when we talk about a brother or
[1:30:47] a sister because we could potentially be
[1:30:49] talking about the Holy Ghost in their
[1:30:51] lives
[1:30:52] and what did we say earlier brother
[1:30:54] Bradham said careful careful we know the
[1:30:57] word says it that you know what in this
[1:30:59] day it's okay if you speak against the
[1:31:01] son of man when you talk about Jesus if
[1:31:02] they want to go off on him and say that
[1:31:04] he's a quack from wherever then they can
[1:31:06] they can just say that
[1:31:08] but don't ever talk one word against the
[1:31:10] Holy Ghost when he comes
[1:31:13] and here we are at the highest level the
[1:31:15] opening of the word the full word
[1:31:17] completely open to us brothers and
[1:31:19] sisters don't let traditional teaching
[1:31:21] don't let
[1:31:22] family tradition don't let Church
[1:31:24] tradition don't let anything get in the
[1:31:26] way and say because we've done it this
[1:31:28] way all along it's okay and and we still
[1:31:30] Prosper it's not going to be okay we
[1:31:32] need to see the exact representation of
[1:31:34] the word in our lives to get the results
[1:31:36] we're after if we want to see a body
[1:31:38] change we have to be fully committed
[1:31:40] fully persuaded all the way in
[1:31:44] before Sodom was judged there was there
[1:31:46] was there was a sign given and that sign
[1:31:48] was the discernment of the heart the
[1:31:50] sermon of the heart
[1:31:52] the the idea in in the heart of a man
[1:31:55] and we know that was that was manifested
[1:31:57] by Sarah Jesus in in in I say Jesus but
[1:32:03] but Elohim standing there in flesh which
[1:32:06] is Jesus
[1:32:07] saying why did Sarah laugh who was in
[1:32:10] the tent behind him
[1:32:12] and she said no I didn't laugh and he
[1:32:14] said oh but you did you did I heard you
[1:32:16] I was standing right in front of you
[1:32:18] when you did even though she was an
[1:32:20] attempt behind him because we know that
[1:32:23] he is God almighty
[1:32:25] and he is omnipotent he's everywhere all
[1:32:27] at the same time
[1:32:30] omnipresent he knows what's going on
[1:32:33] but the discernment of the heart and
[1:32:35] we've seen that in our day
[1:32:37] I mean maybe we haven't it's it's so far
[1:32:40] in the past for many of us
[1:32:42] some of us have seen it in our day
[1:32:45] I think brother meno and and some of the
[1:32:47] you know the the old-timers the elders
[1:32:50] in our our are calling our message
[1:32:52] Community they actually were in the
[1:32:54] services brother Pete Claussen he was
[1:32:57] there in Jeffersonville watching the
[1:33:00] discernment of the Lord in people's
[1:33:02] lives
[1:33:05] son of man Ministry is with us now
[1:33:07] brothers and sisters
[1:33:08] remember gifts and callings are without
[1:33:10] repentance and even though some men have
[1:33:12] great Ministries
[1:33:14] a great ministry isn't the sign that
[1:33:16] we're after
[1:33:18] we need to be careful and remember that
[1:33:20] a great ministry from a Pulpit isn't the
[1:33:23] sign necessarily that we're after
[1:33:25] does that person actually point to
[1:33:28] Christ or do they draw men unto
[1:33:30] themselves
[1:33:33] we have to point men to Christ
[1:33:35] just because we have great signs and
[1:33:37] wonders in our lives doesn't mean
[1:33:38] anything
[1:33:39] doesn't mean anything Satan can
[1:33:42] impersonate anything and and just to
[1:33:44] bring it so so close and make it so
[1:33:46] clear remember when Jesus was talking to
[1:33:48] his disciples he was talking to them
[1:33:50] about having to go to the cross and and
[1:33:52] his number one man one of his number one
[1:33:55] number two Guy Peter said to him no I'll
[1:33:57] never let that happen what did he say
[1:33:59] get thee behind me Satan
[1:34:03] because you don't even understand what
[1:34:05] you're saying
[1:34:07] we have to be careful what we say
[1:34:09] take every thought into captivity
[1:34:13] you know what brother Branham said
[1:34:14] because you do that to me
[1:34:16] you actually Elevate me to a place where
[1:34:20] you actually make me Jesus you make me
[1:34:23] Christ you make me the Messiah what
[1:34:25] you're doing is you're making me
[1:34:27] Antichrist
[1:34:29] just like that and the people mean well
[1:34:31] the people are sincere and genuine they
[1:34:36] really sincerely genuinely want to help
[1:34:39] and and and see things manifest in a
[1:34:42] great way they want to see the kingdom
[1:34:43] of God go further but if they're Askew
[1:34:45] in the foundational teaching of the word
[1:34:48] then they're going to be just a little
[1:34:49] bit off
[1:34:50] it's not going to end up right it's like
[1:34:53] shooting a gun if you're just a teeny
[1:34:55] little bit off or if you shake just a
[1:34:56] little bit if you breathe just a little
[1:34:58] bit if your heart beats just a little
[1:35:00] bit when you're squeezing the trigger of
[1:35:01] a gun that bullet can be off a long ways
[1:35:04] when you want it to hit the target that
[1:35:06] you're holding the crosshairs on
[1:35:08] people may have great intellect
[1:35:10] they might have great healings
[1:35:13] but if they exalt men in our day
[1:35:17] we're making those men Antichrist
[1:35:21] and you know the sad part is is that
[1:35:24] those men
[1:35:25] they're not actually doing it themselves
[1:35:28] it's people that are doing it to them
[1:35:30] but those men have a place of Reckoning
[1:35:32] where they can actually make a decision
[1:35:34] to say I need to make a change something
[1:35:36] has to change here people's souls are on
[1:35:38] the line
[1:35:40] personally my opinion here it's not
[1:35:43] worth much I know it but I believe this
[1:35:45] that those people need to recuse
[1:35:47] themselves from the position they're in
[1:35:49] because they're no longer able to do it
[1:35:52] with a clear conscience I believe
[1:35:54] how could we clearly believe the word
[1:35:56] for our day and have people Elevate
[1:35:59] ourselves to a different level other
[1:36:01] than what we are as a servant how could
[1:36:02] we possibly ever do that
[1:36:04] with a clear conscience it just doesn't
[1:36:06] make sense
[1:36:07] brother Branham set out the pattern he
[1:36:09] said when you do that to me you make me
[1:36:11] Antichrist
[1:36:15] don't want to look for a sign
[1:36:16] don't look for a sign
[1:36:19] s and wonders aren't the infallible
[1:36:21] proof of the word in our lives
[1:36:23] the infallible proof of the word in our
[1:36:25] lives are being able to receive the word
[1:36:27] for our day being able to receive the
[1:36:29] message of the hour being able to
[1:36:31] receive the formula that the message of
[1:36:33] the hour gave us and that's to go on to
[1:36:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:37] and you know harping on the Holy Ghost
[1:36:39] is important because without the Holy
[1:36:41] Ghost we're going to miss the Mark we're
[1:36:43] not going to have that token in our
[1:36:45] lives to get to where we want to
[1:36:47] I know some people have been upset oh
[1:36:49] he's talking about the Holy Ghost again
[1:36:52] my goodness there's nothing else but the
[1:36:54] Holy Ghost brothers and sisters there
[1:36:56] isn't and I would say this be careful
[1:36:59] because there's one thing you don't want
[1:37:01] to speak against
[1:37:02] one thing
[1:37:04] grown about any other topic that we talk
[1:37:06] about but don't groan about that one
[1:37:09] that's the only way of Escape that we
[1:37:11] have how could anybody groan about that
[1:37:13] topic it just blows my mind
[1:37:17] doesn't it when you think about it that
[1:37:19] way as a Believer we have one way to get
[1:37:21] out of here one thing that's going to
[1:37:23] get us in a Rapture or get us out of the
[1:37:25] graveyard one thing and that's the Holy
[1:37:27] Ghost in our lives but some people will
[1:37:29] complain about the preaching of the Holy
[1:37:31] Ghost
[1:37:34] why
[1:37:38] brother Bradham once he realized at
[1:37:40] first he thought this was a joke these
[1:37:42] people elevating them that way he
[1:37:43] thought that he says it in this message
[1:37:45] at first he thought this was a joke but
[1:37:48] then he heard that it was real and you
[1:37:50] know this is the one thing that really
[1:37:51] stood out to me from this whole entire
[1:37:53] topic brother Branham when he realized
[1:37:56] that it wasn't a joke it grieved him
[1:37:58] it grieved him really bad
[1:38:00] and why did it grief him he says it it
[1:38:03] grieved him because these are true
[1:38:05] believers
[1:38:06] these are genuine brothers and sisters
[1:38:10] these aren't fanatical
[1:38:11] Maniacs out there causing reproach for
[1:38:15] the gospel these are people that really
[1:38:16] believe
[1:38:18] and he said it Grieves my heart to think
[1:38:20] that they would do that because of that
[1:38:21] I have to excuse myself from it I cannot
[1:38:24] allow them to do that I have to just
[1:38:26] step back and say no not me Christ
[1:38:30] and you know I believe this with all my
[1:38:32] heart I just again here I go getting
[1:38:34] into Muddy Waters but what stops people
[1:38:36] from doing that what would stop someone
[1:38:38] from actually saying I'm just going to
[1:38:40] excuse myself because I don't believe
[1:38:42] that you're actually promoting me the
[1:38:44] right way we're not actually doing the
[1:38:46] right thing we're not getting the right
[1:38:47] results because you're talking about me
[1:38:48] and you're not talking about Christ
[1:38:51] what stops people from stepping back is
[1:38:53] pride
[1:38:54] why wouldn't somebody say I'll step back
[1:38:57] you know what I I and I'm sure every one
[1:38:59] of us would have the same idea in our
[1:39:01] minds that if someone truly was led by
[1:39:03] God and that started to happen God would
[1:39:06] make a way for them
[1:39:07] God wouldn't take them out and hang them
[1:39:09] to dry he would say no I'm going to pour
[1:39:12] out a blessing upon you that you can't
[1:39:14] even contain because you have defended
[1:39:16] the word you have stepped back and and
[1:39:19] humiliated yourself humbled yourself
[1:39:21] before me and before the people
[1:39:24] but it takes a lot of
[1:39:27] anti-pride to be able to do that
[1:39:30] to be able to step back and say wow
[1:39:32] maybe there's someone else that would be
[1:39:34] the person for this position
[1:39:38] brother Brown thought it was a joke at
[1:39:39] first but once he realized it it grieved
[1:39:42] him
[1:39:43] you know the other part about this is he
[1:39:45] said to people
[1:39:47] that actually do this
[1:39:50] they will be responsible for all the
[1:39:52] people that he can't reach because of it
[1:39:56] it's tragic to think about
[1:39:59] to think today the people that actually
[1:40:02] do that to those other brothers out
[1:40:04] there ever who they are I don't know I'm
[1:40:05] not going to say anybody I'm not going
[1:40:07] to throw off on anybody if you ever see
[1:40:09] it if you ever come across it you'll
[1:40:10] know what I'm talking about
[1:40:13] but those people that do that
[1:40:15] and the brothers that don't do something
[1:40:17] about it they're going to be responsible
[1:40:19] for who this message doesn't reach
[1:40:22] because it's the prophet speaking here I
[1:40:23] believe this is a prophecy here now
[1:40:25] maybe I'm crazy but this is a prophet
[1:40:27] speaking these words right here he also
[1:40:30] said that the people who do this will be
[1:40:32] responsible for the people that he fails
[1:40:35] to reach so the people who fail to
[1:40:37] actually hear true preaching of the
[1:40:39] message of the hour from a minister
[1:40:42] brothers and sisters who would say the
[1:40:44] truth instead of saying oh my pastor my
[1:40:48] pastor my pastor my pastor or this
[1:40:50] Minister this Minister this minister
[1:40:52] I remember hearing somebody say to me
[1:40:54] one time
[1:40:56] we were in Africa and and it kind of put
[1:40:59] me on the floor I didn't understand it
[1:41:01] at the time
[1:41:02] but I I did later on
[1:41:06] a couple of sisters came to me after
[1:41:08] some of the services the Easter meetings
[1:41:09] on the very first time we were there and
[1:41:11] they said oh brother we sure appreciated
[1:41:13] your preaching and it was so good and we
[1:41:15] were so inspired by it are you a
[1:41:18] follower of so and so are you a disciple
[1:41:20] of so and so
[1:41:21] and I was like what
[1:41:23] disciple of who
[1:41:25] I didn't even know who the brother was I
[1:41:27] had to go away and look them up online
[1:41:29] and see and I was like my goodness
[1:41:32] no I'm a disciple of Jesus Christ
[1:41:36] I'm a follower of the Lord
[1:41:39] I believe the message of the hour that
[1:41:40] William Miriam Branham Brent and and
[1:41:43] brought and what it did was it gave me
[1:41:45] the opportunity to have a real
[1:41:46] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:48] and that's who I follow
[1:41:51] I don't disciple any Ministry
[1:41:54] no
[1:41:55] and I think it's a real big trap for
[1:41:58] people to do that
[1:41:59] to get into the school of the prophets
[1:42:01] and and try and go down that road and
[1:42:04] think that if
[1:42:08] no no no no no no we've been given clear
[1:42:11] unreserved access to the throne of
[1:42:13] almighty God and if we go any other way
[1:42:16] we're going to miss the mark
[1:42:18] don't follow brother Branham don't don't
[1:42:20] talk about brother Bradham talk about
[1:42:22] Jesus Christ because brother Branham
[1:42:24] pointed to Jesus Christ
[1:42:26] we follow the lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:30] any other way is going to be wrong now
[1:42:32] don't get me wrong don't take it out of
[1:42:34] context and I said it that way I know I
[1:42:36] did I'll just go back and correct it a
[1:42:37] little bit here try and smooth it over
[1:42:39] Maybe cover my tracks a bit and just
[1:42:41] simply say this yeah I know I said don't
[1:42:43] follow brother Branham
[1:42:46] but if you follow just the man
[1:42:48] guess what's going to happen you're
[1:42:49] going to elevate him
[1:42:51] Antichrist in your life that's what I'm
[1:42:53] saying follow his instructions his
[1:42:56] instructions were follow Christ his
[1:42:59] instructions were go on all the way to
[1:43:02] the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[1:43:04] anything else is going to be false
[1:43:06] anything else won't be accepted in our
[1:43:08] day
[1:43:09] that's what I'm saying that's what I'm
[1:43:12] talking about right there
[1:43:13] nice throw away your Traditions don't
[1:43:15] follow traditional teachings of man
[1:43:19] he said that the people who actually do
[1:43:21] this that elevate him that way they will
[1:43:24] be responsible for the people that he
[1:43:25] can't reach to think about the ministers
[1:43:28] today if if they don't do something
[1:43:29] about it if they don't stop that thing
[1:43:32] however they can
[1:43:34] because of Pride or whatever it is maybe
[1:43:36] it's money maybe it's popularity
[1:43:37] whatever it is if they don't stop that
[1:43:39] thing in their own life in their own
[1:43:41] Ministry then they will be responsible
[1:43:43] for who this message doesn't reach in
[1:43:45] their day
[1:43:46] that is powerful my
[1:43:50] I'm just so thankful that the Lord
[1:43:51] showed me this
[1:43:54] Antichrist is what it is and you know
[1:43:56] that spirit is alive and well today
[1:44:03] I'm just going to stop harping on that
[1:44:05] now
[1:44:07] who seeketh after assigned brothers and
[1:44:08] sisters after what we've heard so far an
[1:44:10] evil and adulterous generation brother
[1:44:13] Branham our Prophet for today he said a
[1:44:15] lazy generation
[1:44:17] seeketh after a sign and a lazy
[1:44:20] adulterous generation they want someone
[1:44:22] else to do it for them they want that
[1:44:24] great minister to be in there and and to
[1:44:26] make a certain amount of money and and
[1:44:28] to do a certain amount of things and and
[1:44:30] to create a certain way for them to
[1:44:32] actually just be able to fellowship and
[1:44:34] you know what brother Branham said is
[1:44:35] that yeah God will actually allow his
[1:44:38] anointing to bless that Ministry
[1:44:41] maybe not in those words
[1:44:43] that's Barry's words for sure
[1:44:45] but you know brother Bradham said in the
[1:44:48] last days they'll actually trade power
[1:44:50] for programs
[1:44:51] and they'll get a great church together
[1:44:53] and and they'll have all of the great
[1:44:55] signs and wonders in the church and he
[1:44:58] even said brother Bradham did say this
[1:44:59] that they'll get results
[1:45:03] they'll get results
[1:45:05] so what could be wrong with it
[1:45:07] if it's not pointing to the right word
[1:45:09] the right sign if it's not pointing the
[1:45:11] right way if it's not pointing people to
[1:45:13] Christ then it's wrong
[1:45:15] then it's Antichrist and you know
[1:45:17] remember the word says that it will be
[1:45:18] so close that it would deceive the very
[1:45:20] elected if it were possible the two
[1:45:21] Vines grow together all the way together
[1:45:24] so close that it would deceive the very
[1:45:26] elected if it were possible so don't
[1:45:28] think that vine is somewhere out there
[1:45:29] in the world it's right there in the
[1:45:31] midst right in the midst of the truth we
[1:45:34] need to be very careful we have to have
[1:45:36] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives brothers and
[1:45:37] sisters that's the only way the Holy
[1:45:39] Ghost is the only way we're going to be
[1:45:41] able to discern it
[1:45:42] to be able to tell the difference
[1:45:44] between truth and false
[1:45:47] to think that that's the only way we're
[1:45:49] going to be able to tell the difference
[1:45:50] between the true and the false Vine
[1:45:51] that's the only way we're going to be
[1:45:53] able to get out of the Grave if we go
[1:45:54] there that's the only way we're going to
[1:45:55] be able to get in the Rapture if we're
[1:45:57] here when it happens is the only way
[1:46:00] we're spiritually going to be able to
[1:46:01] accept God in spirit and Truth is with
[1:46:05] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives how could we
[1:46:07] ever not want to talk about the Holy
[1:46:09] Ghost
[1:46:10] that just blows my mind to Smithereens I
[1:46:13] just I don't even understand that I
[1:46:15] don't even get it
[1:46:18] we've been given the greatest sign
[1:46:19] brothers and sisters if we believe if we
[1:46:21] are able to believe the word for our day
[1:46:23] out of 7.9 billion people
[1:46:27] only
[1:46:28] how many people are able to hear the
[1:46:30] word for our day even if it was a
[1:46:31] million people that's a really small
[1:46:34] small percentage but is it a million
[1:46:36] people I don't know I don't know how
[1:46:39] many people is it in the world nobody
[1:46:40] knows that's why we don't want to put
[1:46:42] anybody in
[1:46:44] we just want to try and get as many
[1:46:45] people to come with us as we can
[1:46:49] we just want to make sure that we preach
[1:46:50] what the prophet preached and never
[1:46:52] deviate from it and never allow
[1:46:55] something to come up where we say that
[1:46:57] no I've gone so far this way that I
[1:46:59] can't have enough humility in my spirit
[1:47:02] to come back and say forgive me because
[1:47:04] maybe I was wrong
[1:47:06] we have got to be willing to say that I
[1:47:08] was wrong
[1:47:10] we've got to be able to say it as as as
[1:47:12] parents to our children we have to be
[1:47:15] willing to say it children to our
[1:47:16] parents we have to be willing to say it
[1:47:19] husband to wife
[1:47:21] and wife to husband
[1:47:24] pastor
[1:47:25] to sheep
[1:47:27] sheep to Pastor brothers and sisters
[1:47:29] we're in this together it's a
[1:47:31] many-membered body
[1:47:32] it's not a great one amongst us except
[1:47:34] for Christ Jesus we've got to be willing
[1:47:37] to have humility in our lives
[1:47:39] if we're wrong we don't want to be wrong
[1:47:41] who wants to be wrong I'll tell you who
[1:47:43] wants to be wrong the person
[1:47:46] that never wants to be wrong the one
[1:47:48] who's always right right they're the one
[1:47:51] that wants to be wrong and they don't
[1:47:52] even realize it
[1:47:55] but nobody wants to be wrong I honestly
[1:47:56] believe that nobody really wants to be
[1:47:58] wrong
[1:47:59] but you know what happens is pride gets
[1:48:01] in the door pride gets in our lives and
[1:48:04] it causes us to always want to be right
[1:48:06] I always have to be right and I can have
[1:48:09] all the quotes and I could have all the
[1:48:11] scripture I could I could give my body
[1:48:13] to be burned I could spend all the money
[1:48:16] that I get I could stay up all night
[1:48:17] long praying I could use toothpicks to
[1:48:20] keep my eyes open for a week I could
[1:48:22] fast for 40 days I could do all of these
[1:48:25] things but if I don't have what
[1:48:29] the Holy Ghost
[1:48:31] it profareth me
[1:48:33] nothing
[1:48:37] it's not a workspace gospel
[1:48:39] it's having that true baptism of the
[1:48:41] Holy Ghost brothers and sisters you have
[1:48:43] to have it we have to
[1:48:46] obedience to the message of this hour is
[1:48:48] what entitles us to the Token that's
[1:48:50] what brother Branham said obedience to
[1:48:52] the word full obedience to the word
[1:48:54] entitles you to the token
[1:48:58] what else is there besides the token I I
[1:49:00] just don't understand it there's nothing
[1:49:02] it's divine love we only get Divine love
[1:49:05] with the token which is the Holy Spirit
[1:49:09] you know what the same anointing though
[1:49:11] that anoints the people with the Holy
[1:49:13] Spirit is anointing other people it's
[1:49:14] the exact same anointing
[1:49:18] God poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh
[1:49:21] is what the word says and that anointing
[1:49:23] is causing
[1:49:25] Christians to rise up and and become
[1:49:27] bride and accept the word and and become
[1:49:30] exactly who God created them to be and
[1:49:32] it's also causing the other seed to rise
[1:49:34] up and become exactly what God created
[1:49:37] it to be
[1:49:40] some vessels of honor and some vessels
[1:49:43] of Dishonor
[1:49:45] all of it was created by God
[1:49:48] we know that Eve said she got a man from
[1:49:51] the Lord and who was that
[1:49:54] Cain
[1:49:56] Cain who was of his father the devil
[1:50:00] but all life brothers and sisters comes
[1:50:02] from God any life that's created on this
[1:50:05] Earth is from God everything that was
[1:50:08] created here is what the word says but
[1:50:11] there's a lot of people who are anointed
[1:50:12] with the very same Holy Spirit today and
[1:50:14] it's causing them to display a different
[1:50:16] Revelation and and you know it's an
[1:50:19] antichrist Spirit we talked about it in
[1:50:21] the in the in the church ages in the
[1:50:24] seals dealing with all of those
[1:50:26] different things it's that same
[1:50:27] Antichrist spirit that gallops all the
[1:50:29] way through it
[1:50:30] it's the same Holy Ghost spirit in the
[1:50:33] seven Church ages even in the seals that
[1:50:35] actually displays the spirit of Christ
[1:50:37] it's the same spirit and they too
[1:50:40] they're just intertwined they're
[1:50:42] together so close that it would deceive
[1:50:44] the fairy elected and and who we give
[1:50:47] who you know remember the story brother
[1:50:49] Branham talked about the two dogs in in
[1:50:51] a man's life the Indian Chief's life the
[1:50:53] white dog and the black dog which one
[1:50:55] wins the one that he feeds the most
[1:50:57] right it's the same thing in our lives
[1:51:00] brothers and sisters those those two
[1:51:02] Spirits are striving for for a place in
[1:51:04] our lives they're striving for the
[1:51:06] throne room of our hearts and the one
[1:51:08] that we feed is the one that will
[1:51:10] actually reign in our heart and if we're
[1:51:12] Sons and Daughters of God there's
[1:51:13] nothing that can ever take that place
[1:51:15] nothing can ever ever satisfy that
[1:51:17] thirst in our lives so I'm not trying to
[1:51:20] scare anyone don't worry if we're a Son
[1:51:22] of God then we will be a Son of God and
[1:51:25] there's nothing that can stop us from
[1:51:26] being a son or a daughter of God nothing
[1:51:30] because when that anointing strikes us
[1:51:32] at the time appointed of the father we
[1:51:34] will take the necessary steps to get the
[1:51:36] baptism of the holy spirit in our lives
[1:51:38] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:51:39] save us
[1:51:40] you know when we look around the world
[1:51:42] it's frightening they're teaching it's
[1:51:44] okay to just teach students in school
[1:51:47] that you can just be whatever you want
[1:51:48] to be and if anybody like me stands
[1:51:50] behind a Pulpit and says you know what
[1:51:52] according to the word of God that's
[1:51:53] wrong
[1:51:55] Man was created man woman was created
[1:51:58] woman period
[1:52:00] to say that man was created as a man and
[1:52:03] a woman was created as a woman and they
[1:52:05] too shall become one is marriage and
[1:52:08] anything else is against the word of God
[1:52:12] those two things are called hate speech
[1:52:14] and it's written into law now and that's
[1:52:16] the thing that will shut us down
[1:52:18] that's what will get us in trouble
[1:52:21] with the law
[1:52:23] but it is the word of God
[1:52:26] and we're not going to deny it
[1:52:33] you know what happens is that anointing
[1:52:34] it hits that seed Gene that was placed
[1:52:37] there from before the
[1:52:38] Foundation
[1:52:40] and when it does it just activates that
[1:52:43] life that life comes to life and some
[1:52:46] people they have it in their in their
[1:52:48] mother's womb
[1:52:49] right some people come out and they're
[1:52:51] just good people and and they just they
[1:52:54] get the baptism of the Holy Spirit I
[1:52:55] know a brother was saying that he
[1:52:56] remembers clearly at age three he wanted
[1:52:59] to go up to the front of the church and
[1:53:00] get the baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[1:53:02] he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost at
[1:53:04] age three he can remember it and his
[1:53:06] parents validate it
[1:53:08] some people they go to age 33 like me
[1:53:13] some people go further
[1:53:15] everyone has the time appointed of the
[1:53:17] father
[1:53:18] and if we are that see Gene of God then
[1:53:20] we will come we will
[1:53:27] every age has been given a portion of
[1:53:30] this heavenly gift
[1:53:32] and you know what's interesting when we
[1:53:33] look at it that way every age has been
[1:53:36] given a portion right that's what I said
[1:53:38] every age has been given a portion but
[1:53:41] we have been given all of it
[1:53:44] what should that do for us we love the
[1:53:48] word for our day it's just astounding to
[1:53:51] look at and think about
[1:53:53] turn with me over into Matthew chapter
[1:53:55] 19.
[1:54:04] Matthew chapter 19.
[1:54:13] someone else was seeking after a sign
[1:54:18] start with verse 18.
[1:54:25] I was talking to this
[1:54:28] the Commandments
[1:54:31] Verse 18 He saith unto him which
[1:54:34] Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou
[1:54:38] shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[1:54:40] steal Thou shalt not bear false witness
[1:54:43] honor thy father and thy mother
[1:54:46] and thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:54:48] thyself
[1:54:51] verse 20.
[1:54:52] Matthew chapter 19.
[1:54:55] the young man saith unto him all these
[1:54:58] things have I kept from my youth up
[1:55:01] what luck I yet
[1:55:04] Jesus said unto him if thou Wilt be
[1:55:07] perfect
[1:55:08] remember the word let's move on to
[1:55:10] perfection
[1:55:12] when that which is perfect is come that
[1:55:14] which is in part shall be done away with
[1:55:16] here we have the sign for the day giving
[1:55:20] this Man instruction
[1:55:22] if thou Wilt be perfect go and sell that
[1:55:25] thou Hast and give to the poor and thou
[1:55:28] shalt have treasure in heaven and come
[1:55:31] and follow me
[1:55:32] but when the young man heard that saying
[1:55:34] he went away sorrowful
[1:55:37] for he had great possessions
[1:55:39] then said Jesus unto his disciples
[1:55:41] verily I say unto you that a rich man
[1:55:44] shall hardly enter into the kingdom of
[1:55:46] heaven
[1:55:47] and again I say unto you it is easier
[1:55:49] for a camel to go through the eye of a
[1:55:51] needle than for a rich man to enter into
[1:55:53] the kingdom of God
[1:55:56] and when his disciples heard it they
[1:55:58] were exceedingly amazed saying who can
[1:56:01] then be saved
[1:56:04] but Jesus says Jesus beheld them
[1:56:08] and said unto them with men
[1:56:10] this is impossible
[1:56:13] but With God all things are possible
[1:56:17] so the point that I want to make out
[1:56:19] with this here
[1:56:22] is this
[1:56:24] actually you know what let's just turn
[1:56:27] over to Luke 16 quickly we got 15
[1:56:29] minutes
[1:56:33] Luke chapter 16.
[1:56:36] continuing on with this story
[1:56:42] Luke chapter 16 verse 22.
[1:56:47] I'll just read the end of this here but
[1:56:49] Jesus beheld his disciples I'll read 25
[1:56:52] we'll return in there when his disciples
[1:56:54] heard it they were exceedingly amazed
[1:56:56] saying who then can be saved but Jesus
[1:56:59] beheld them and said unto them with men
[1:57:01] this is impossible but With God all
[1:57:04] things are possible in Luke 16 Verse 22
[1:57:09] and it came to pass
[1:57:11] actually verse 19 sorry
[1:57:13] there was a certain rich man
[1:57:16] which was clothed in purple and fine
[1:57:18] linen and fared sumptuously every day
[1:57:20] and there was a certain beggar named
[1:57:22] Lazarus which was laid at his gate full
[1:57:24] of sores and Desiring to be fed with the
[1:57:27] crumbs which fell from the rich man's
[1:57:29] table moreover the dogs came and licked
[1:57:32] his sores
[1:57:33] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[1:57:36] and was carried by the Angels into
[1:57:38] Abraham's bosom
[1:57:40] the rich man also died and was buried
[1:57:43] and in hell
[1:57:45] he lifted up his eyes being in torments
[1:57:47] and seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus
[1:57:51] was in his bosom
[1:57:53] and he cried and said Father Abraham
[1:57:55] have mercy on me and said Lazarus that
[1:57:58] he may dip the tip of his finger in
[1:57:59] water and cool my tongue for I am
[1:58:02] tormented in this Flame
[1:58:06] what
[1:58:08] son
[1:58:09] remember that thou in thy lifetime
[1:58:11] receiveth die good things and likewise
[1:58:14] Lazarus evil things but now he is
[1:58:17] comforted and thou art tormented
[1:58:20] and beside all this you there is a great
[1:58:23] Gulf fixed
[1:58:24] so that they which would pass from hence
[1:58:26] to you cannot neither can they pass to
[1:58:29] us that would come from thence
[1:58:32] then he said I pray thee therefore
[1:58:34] father that thou would Ascend him to my
[1:58:37] father's house for I have five Brethren
[1:58:39] that he may testify unto them lest they
[1:58:42] also come into this place of Torment
[1:58:45] Abraham saith unto him
[1:58:47] they have Moses and the prophets
[1:58:50] let them hear them
[1:58:53] and he said nay Father Abraham but if
[1:58:56] one went unto them from the dead they
[1:58:58] would repent
[1:59:00] and he said unto him
[1:59:02] if they hear not Moses and the prophets
[1:59:05] neither will they be persuaded by one
[1:59:07] that rose from the dead
[1:59:11] brothers and sisters just thinking about
[1:59:13] this whole story here
[1:59:16] how important it is
[1:59:18] even the sign of someone coming back
[1:59:20] from the dead
[1:59:22] if that seed Gene of God is in them
[1:59:25] then this word
[1:59:27] this word about the Holy Ghost is all
[1:59:30] that it takes
[1:59:31] this word of the message of the hour
[1:59:33] understanding how to get the Holy Ghost
[1:59:36] In Our Lives is all it will take it's
[1:59:39] not going to take William Miriam Branham
[1:59:41] coming back from the dead it's not going
[1:59:44] to take a dead loved one coming back
[1:59:45] from the dead to try and persuade us
[1:59:48] we either get persuaded by the word the
[1:59:51] true sign for our day or we don't
[1:59:55] is the point that I want to make with
[1:59:56] this
[1:59:57] one other little thing that I want to
[1:59:59] brush on here in Matthew 20. Jesus saith
[2:00:02] unto him in verse in in in Matthew 19
[2:00:05] sorry in verse 21 Jesus Jesus saith unto
[2:00:09] him if thou Wilt be perfect go and sell
[2:00:11] that thou Hast and give to the poor and
[2:00:13] thou shalt have
[2:00:15] come and follow me
[2:00:18] but when the young man heard that saying
[2:00:20] he went away sorrowful for he had great
[2:00:22] possessions
[2:00:24] Jesus gave him the instruction
[2:00:27] he asked for a sign
[2:00:29] and Jesus gave it to him
[2:00:32] but you know what it was the things of
[2:00:34] this Earth
[2:00:35] were too great for him
[2:00:37] and and I believe the Lord just revealed
[2:00:39] this to me myself while I was going
[2:00:41] through this and you know it wasn't all
[2:00:43] about the money
[2:00:45] and it wasn't all about the inheritance
[2:00:48] from his parents it wasn't all about
[2:00:50] whatever it was that was there in the
[2:00:52] background in riches even though he says
[2:00:55] that it was riches so forgive me I'm not
[2:00:57] trying to say the scripture is different
[2:00:58] but what I want to do is look at it from
[2:01:00] a little different angle I believe that
[2:01:02] he was telling him something way more
[2:01:03] important than that and that is that all
[2:01:06] that you think you know about the word
[2:01:09] is not what the word actually is of the
[2:01:13] traditional teaching that you're
[2:01:14] following you think that it's actually
[2:01:16] going to stay the same I'm here as a
[2:01:19] sign a super sign to show you that it's
[2:01:22] changed dispensations the scepter is
[2:01:25] moving the voice is gone from Heaven
[2:01:27] down to earth and it stands right before
[2:01:30] you now telling you the instruction that
[2:01:32] you need to do but I know for sure that
[2:01:34] you won't do it because you can't it's
[2:01:37] not in you to do it
[2:01:39] and when we hear the message of the hour
[2:01:41] brothers and sisters
[2:01:43] he's calling us out of tradition
[2:01:46] we have to be very very certain and I
[2:01:49] just say it and I'll keep saying it make
[2:01:51] absolutely certain that our tradition
[2:01:54] matches the word
[2:01:56] the tradition that we have holds to the
[2:01:59] message of the hour and if it doesn't
[2:02:01] then just leave it alone
[2:02:03] and ask the Lord to show us
[2:02:06] he will show us when we are sincere
[2:02:10] I heard someone mention it a little
[2:02:11] while ago and I I believe it you know
[2:02:13] what there's one thing that I can say
[2:02:14] with conviction myself as I wrap up I'll
[2:02:17] even call the musicians because we have
[2:02:19] service tonight I could just keep going
[2:02:20] here and and probably will pick up from
[2:02:22] where we leave off here but I believe
[2:02:24] this with all my heart I know it for
[2:02:26] sure
[2:02:27] there's one thing that the message of
[2:02:29] the hour takes if you want to see the
[2:02:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life
[2:02:32] there's one thing that will get it for
[2:02:34] you and you don't have to labor into it
[2:02:36] it's not a great work it's not something
[2:02:38] big that we have to strive to do it's
[2:02:40] easy
[2:02:41] just be sincere
[2:02:43] remember the prophet he was shown the
[2:02:46] snake and and God showed him in that
[2:02:49] Vision you need to be more sincere how
[2:02:52] much more sincere do we need to be
[2:02:54] as Sons and Daughters of God not in that
[2:02:57] prophet's status where maybe many of us
[2:03:00] have have lives that are marred with
[2:03:03] different things that that have happened
[2:03:07] for our day who didn't actually smoke or
[2:03:09] drink or defile his body in any way
[2:03:11] because there was a work for him to do
[2:03:13] later that man
[2:03:16] was told to be more sincere
[2:03:18] the person in that office was told to be
[2:03:21] more sincere
[2:03:23] but I know this
[2:03:25] if we're sincere if we truly are if we
[2:03:27] look up at me I don't even know what the
[2:03:29] meaning of the word means and forgive me
[2:03:30] maybe it sounds silly for me even to be
[2:03:33] talking this way maybe I'll bring it
[2:03:34] tonight I'll bring the the Webster's
[2:03:37] definition of the word sincere I Know It
[2:03:39] with all my heart if you're sincere if
[2:03:41] you have no reservations if you're
[2:03:43] willing to say to God just let me come
[2:03:45] and fall at your altar and and make me a
[2:03:48] new creation created me a clean heart
[2:03:52] and renew a right Spirit within me if
[2:03:54] we're willing to do that he will
[2:03:57] but if we have a reservation if we say
[2:04:00] no I still like all my old friends and I
[2:04:02] still like all their old phone numbers
[2:04:03] and I still like that movie and I still
[2:04:05] like that song and I still like to go
[2:04:07] there and I still like all these little
[2:04:09] things in my life you know what we're
[2:04:10] doing we're saying to God that you're
[2:04:12] not the pearl of great price not yet and
[2:04:15] he'll say okay
[2:04:16] it's cool it's just not the time
[2:04:19] appointed of the father there's a little
[2:04:21] bit more training to do and a little bit
[2:04:23] more hardship to go through a little bit
[2:04:24] more swamp to Wade through and as we
[2:04:26] Wade through it we will come to the
[2:04:28] other side and we have to come out of it
[2:04:30] brothers and sisters
[2:04:31] there comes a point in time where our
[2:04:33] enemy will be dead
[2:04:35] on the wings of a snow white dove the
[2:04:37] prophet for our day he lived his entire
[2:04:40] ministry right to the end fighting that
[2:04:42] thing in his life
[2:04:44] but he did come to the place where God
[2:04:46] told him your enemy is dead
[2:04:49] same thing for us brothers and sisters
[2:04:51] don't doubt it don't doubt it
[2:04:55] nothing can harm us if we're Sons and
[2:04:57] Daughters of God
[2:04:59] he has Us in his hand
[2:05:01] maybe stand with me this morning as we
[2:05:03] pray
[2:05:05] gracious Heavenly Father
[2:05:07] Lord Jesus we're just so thankful for
[2:05:10] your word we're thankful for your
[2:05:11] instruction we're thankful for your sign
[2:05:15] that you have given each one of us Lord
[2:05:17] you you have shown each one of us
[2:05:19] yourself in the way that each one of us
[2:05:23] needs to see it
[2:05:24] and father I pray that if there's anyone
[2:05:26] who hasn't actually seen your sign for
[2:05:30] themselves this morning Lord whether
[2:05:32] they're here in person or whether
[2:05:33] they're listening or whether they hear a
[2:05:36] recording father I pray that you would
[2:05:38] just show them their sign Lord that they
[2:05:41] could come to the place of recognition
[2:05:43] that there is a step for them to take
[2:05:45] there's one more step that we need to
[2:05:46] take and that is to get the baptism of
[2:05:48] the Holy Ghost and when that happens
[2:05:50] then we can just rest father I pray that
[2:05:53] you would just allow each and every one
[2:05:55] of us to just find that place of rest of
[2:05:58] perfect rest in you Lord Jesus because
[2:06:01] that's your desire
[2:06:03] your desire is to take us out of here
[2:06:06] your desire is to see your church seated
[2:06:08] at that heavenly
[2:06:10] table
[2:06:12] that place with each one of our place
[2:06:14] marks with our own name on it that seat
[2:06:17] that you have reserved for us in your
[2:06:19] throne Lord Jesus
[2:06:21] oh Father how we desire to be in that
[2:06:23] seat
[2:06:25] but while we're here father we pray that
[2:06:27] you would just continue giving us
[2:06:29] strength continue giving us Mercy
[2:06:31] continue giving us the ability to just
[2:06:34] press towards the mark for the prize of
[2:06:36] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[2:06:39] because Lord we know that's why you've
[2:06:41] positionally placed each one of us here
[2:06:43] it's not so that we can get caught up in
[2:06:45] this world and and and and and have a
[2:06:48] career and and have a great name and and
[2:06:50] try and establish a kingdom down here no
[2:06:53] no no no no father we're just so
[2:06:56] thankful that you have given us
[2:06:58] eyes to see and ears to hear and most
[2:07:02] importantly a heart to receive your holy
[2:07:04] spirit so father as we go our separate
[2:07:06] ways this morning I pray that you would
[2:07:08] just continue ministering this word
[2:07:10] continue breaking it open to us Lord
[2:07:12] continue encouraging us father help us
[2:07:14] to just have that desire Lord Jesus Take
[2:07:17] taken and change that thirst for the
[2:07:19] things that we have in this world for
[2:07:21] for for for one thing and one thing only
[2:07:24] and that's for you Lord Jesus
[2:07:27] I pray that you would bless our service
[2:07:29] tonight Lord Jesus bless each one father
[2:07:32] that makes the effort to come out Lord
[2:07:33] God that we could just remember you in
[2:07:36] your body and in your blood according to
