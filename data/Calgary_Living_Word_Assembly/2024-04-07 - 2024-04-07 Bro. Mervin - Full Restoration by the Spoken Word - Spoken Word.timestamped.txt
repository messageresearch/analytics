[1:07:22] this been in your days or even even in
[1:07:25] the days of your
[1:07:27] fathers tell ye your children of it and
[1:07:30] let your children tell their children
[1:07:34] and their children another generation
[1:07:37] you can see here it's a passing of
[1:07:39] generation amen
[1:07:41] amen that which the Palmer worm had left
[1:07:46] had the Locust eaten and that which the
[1:07:49] locus had had had left had the conquer
[1:07:53] conquer worm eaten and that which the
[1:07:55] Conqueror worm had left had the C
[1:07:59] caterpillar eaten you can see here it's
[1:08:00] a death they being eaten Joel
[1:08:06] 22526 and I will restore to

[1:08:13] eaten the conquer worm and the
[1:08:17] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[1:08:20] Army which I sent among you and ye shall
[1:08:23] eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[1:08:25] praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:08:28] that had dealt wondrously with you and
[1:08:30] my people shall never be ashamed amen
[1:08:33] may the Lord add blessing to the reading
[1:08:35] of his word you may be
[1:08:37] seated
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:40] so full restoration by the spoken word
[1:08:43] so just put uh let's uh put a foundation
[1:08:47] in it uh let's go with the next slide
[1:08:51] here amen uh paragraph 83-85 the
[1:08:55] restoration of the Bride tree amen now
[1:08:58] BR Bram is saying in in this message the
[1:09:01] restoration of the Bride tree that's
[1:09:04] what Webster says the word restore means
[1:09:07] to bring back to the former owner or to
[1:09:10] bring back to a former state of
[1:09:12] condition bringing back to the former
[1:09:15] owner it means it's like uh
[1:09:18] Redemption right when you pawn
[1:09:21] something it can only be redeemed by the
[1:09:26] owner and uh I preached last time here
[1:09:30] in uh last year during during the Easter
[1:09:34] justification you are made righteous but
[1:09:37] then the other meaning of it is you are
[1:09:40] fully
[1:09:41] owned amen so you cannot be made
[1:09:45] righteous if you're not own because all
[1:09:48] his will be called will be pulled
[1:09:50] towards him amen and if you are his amen
[1:09:54] that's right you will be called No
[1:09:56] Matter
[1:09:57] What amen you will be brought back to
[1:10:00] the to your former owner which is God
[1:10:03] himself amen and that is only by
[1:10:05] election brothers and sisters not by our
[1:10:08] own might not by our own works not by
[1:10:11] our own understanding it's by his
[1:10:13] election by his grace alone not by works
[1:10:16] of righteousness but by his grace alone
[1:10:19] amen and if I claim if and if a claim is
[1:10:22] made on something to make that
[1:10:25] restoration you can enforce
[1:10:28] it to make it come back to its right
[1:10:31] place amen this is beautiful brothers
[1:10:34] and sisters because we were restored by
[1:10:36] the message of the hour Amen to restore
[1:10:39] means to bring back or to restore a
[1:10:42] claim can be enforced now to bring
[1:10:44] anything back to its rightful owner
[1:10:46] where it belongs thank God the Lord we
[1:10:49] belong to him amen therefore some way it
[1:10:53] went away from its rightful owner
[1:10:56] amen we were Sinners all of us we were
[1:10:59] just we were just saved by his grace
[1:11:01] alone amen and when we did know that we
[1:11:05] are
[1:11:05] his when we accepted the message of the
[1:11:09] hour when we received the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:11] then the spiritual Amnesia was cured
[1:11:13] amen amen we know now who we are amen we
[1:11:17] are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:11:21] therefore some way it went away from its
[1:11:23] rightful owner and can wander around
[1:11:26] anywhere but to restore is to bring it
[1:11:29] back to who really owns it or to bring
[1:11:32] it back to its natural state amen where
[1:11:35] it was at the first time bring it back
[1:11:39] into its natural condition and in order
[1:11:42] to do this we have a right to
[1:11:45] enforce amen we can enforce our rights
[1:11:48] we can uh if if there's a squatter in
[1:11:51] the land it has been preached many times
[1:11:53] we can enforce the the law amen because
[1:11:57] that is our rightful possession amen
[1:12:00] amen if there is a law to enforce this
[1:12:02] rightful condition of restoration to
[1:12:05] restore like if somebody stole some
[1:12:07] property and they're holding the
[1:12:09] property captive then you can take the
[1:12:11] law and go to this person and the law
[1:12:14] forces and forces this person to restore
[1:12:17] this property back to its natural owner
[1:12:21] into its liable First Estate amen amen
[1:12:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:26] brothers and sisters I'm not preaching
[1:12:28] anything new it's just for us to be
[1:12:29] reminded amen we're so thankful unto him
[1:12:32] that uh uh we have a prophet God sent a
[1:12:36] prophet and it's important to hear that
[1:12:39] Prophet amen and I have a lot of
[1:12:42] scriptures here to
[1:12:44] show we will be teaching and preaching
[1:12:46] so that at least it can put a a great
[1:12:49] foundation in our faith do we what do we
[1:12:52] really believe okay God sent a prophet
[1:12:54] is is that the end right no God sent a
[1:12:57] prophet for a purpose amen is what to
[1:13:00] declare his word amen for us to be
[1:13:03] matured grow fully amen so bear with me
[1:13:07] if we will read a lot of scriptures and
[1:13:09] I think that's the purpose of our being
[1:13:11] here is to feed on scriptures and feed
[1:13:14] on the quotes for for the message of the
[1:13:17] hour amen just to prove it nothing new
[1:13:20] Isaiah 11:12 just to prove to you that
[1:13:23] the word comes through prophets
[1:13:25] you can see here Isaiah
[1:13:27] 1112 the vision of
[1:13:31] Isaiah amen the son of
[1:13:35] Amos which he saw concerning Judah and J
[1:13:38] Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah jotham
[1:13:41] ahas and ezekiah kings of Judah so you
[1:13:44] see vision of
[1:13:46] Isaiah Vision prophets have visions amen
[1:13:51] amen here o heavens and give here o
[1:13:54] Earth for the Lord hath spoken so it's
[1:13:58] just like th said the Lord amen I have
[1:14:00] nourished and brought up children and
[1:14:02] they have rebelled against me next slide
[1:14:05] Jeremiah 1112 I'm putting all the
[1:14:07] prophets here the book of prophets if
[1:14:09] you can see all their
[1:14:12] starting messages or scriptures it's
[1:14:15] about the words of the Lord through the
[1:14:17] prophet amen Jeremiah 11:12 the words of
[1:14:20] Jeremiah this is the words of Jeremiah
[1:14:23] saying right the son of Hil
[1:14:25] of the priest that were in an anath in
[1:14:28] the land of
[1:14:30] Benjamin to whom who is that whom to
[1:14:33] Jeremiah the word of the Lord came in
[1:14:36] the days of Josiah the son of Amon king
[1:14:39] of Judah in the 13th year of his Reign
[1:14:43] that's Jeremiah I'm just talking about
[1:14:44] the the Major Prophets here and we can
[1:14:47] go with the Minor Prophets as well
[1:14:49] Ezekiel he said at the end of verse one
[1:14:52] I saw visions of
[1:14:53] God and and then verse three the word of
[1:14:56] the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the
[1:14:59] priest we know he's a priest but at the
[1:15:02] same time he's also a prophet the son of
[1:15:04] buai in the land of Chalan by the river
[1:15:07] chibar and the Hand of the Lord was
[1:15:10] there upon Him
[1:15:12] amen Hosea 1 one the word of the Lord
[1:15:16] that came unto Hosea you can see here
[1:15:19] and then Joel 111 the word of the Lord
[1:15:21] that came to Joel the son of pel obadah
[1:15:24] the vision of obadia th said the Lord
[1:15:26] God concerning Edom you can see there's
[1:15:29] a pattern here brothers and sisters the
[1:15:31] word of the Lord comes through prophets
[1:15:34] am the word of God they are not God but
[1:15:37] the word of God comes through the
[1:15:40] prophets amen and we believe yes right
[1:15:44] the prophet for our AIDS that's why amen
[1:15:46] we reap the benefits amen of what he
[1:15:49] receive amen and if you're the
[1:15:52] bride the bride means there's a bride
[1:15:55] and the bridegroom is living in US amen
[1:15:58] so Amos
[1:15:59] 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:16:03] but he revealed his secret unto his
[1:16:05] servants the prophet so you see brothers
[1:16:07] and sisters I'm just putting a
[1:16:09] foundation here and then we will read
[1:16:11] lots of quotes hopefully you will not be
[1:16:13] bored with quotes we've been reading a
[1:16:15] lot of quotes which is good so that you
[1:16:17] know that where it came from right so at
[1:16:19] least we are safe no one can criticize
[1:16:22] us that we're preaching a different
[1:16:24] thing but you can see
[1:16:26] here he's very just brothers and sisters
[1:16:31] right the Lord is just he reveal it his
[1:16:33] secret unto his servants the prophets
[1:16:35] and he will not do nothing until he
[1:16:38] reveal it amen and we are given the
[1:16:40] chance brothers and sisters to hear the
[1:16:44] word to hear the message of the hour
[1:16:47] while still there's breath in our lungs
[1:16:48] we have the Hope amen and we are the
[1:16:51] hope of our brothers and sisters our
[1:16:53] relatives our colleagues everyone that
[1:16:55] we will meet amen amen so we will read
[1:16:58] some quotes here Christ is revealed in
[1:17:01] his own word it will be a little bit of
[1:17:03] a long read but uh bear with me just
[1:17:05] just to show that BR
[1:17:07] Branham although he said that I'm not a
[1:17:10] prophet but we know he's the prophet
[1:17:12] amen otherwise we will not be believing
[1:17:13] him but uh we see there is a change why
[1:17:17] do we believe a prophet because it
[1:17:18] change our lives and it brought us back
[1:17:21] to the word of God fully amen amen he's
[1:17:23] a word prophet amen and it's important
[1:17:26] to know which prophet we will believe so
[1:17:29] Christ is revealed in his own word
[1:17:31] paragraph 118
[1:17:33] amen now we realize then that God sent
[1:17:37] His prophets amen that was the way he
[1:17:40] had of bringing his word to the
[1:17:43] people and notice you know Moses this
[1:17:46] time is he's talking about
[1:17:48] Moses you know Moses said if you want to
[1:17:51] read it in Exodus the 4th chapter and
[1:17:53] the 10th and 12th verse MO Moses said
[1:17:55] God spoke to
[1:17:57] him amen God talked to a man lip to ear
[1:18:02] amen that's how prophets work amen they
[1:18:05] hear it lip to ear amen and he said I'm
[1:18:08] slow of speech Moses said I'm not
[1:18:11] sufficient I can't go he said who made
[1:18:13] man to talk or who made him dumb who
[1:18:16] made him to see or who made him to hear
[1:18:18] then I the Lord said I'll be with you
[1:18:21] with your mouth see next slide and
[1:18:24] Jeremiah this time is Jeremiah said and
[1:18:26] if you want to read that in Jeremiah 1:6
[1:18:29] Jeremiah said that God put words in my
[1:18:32] mouth so you see we cannot just say our
[1:18:34] own words amen because our words don't
[1:18:37] mean nothing if they are not according
[1:18:39] to the word of God Amen see he talked
[1:18:42] lip to ear with one prophet and spoke
[1:18:44] through the other prophet he had no
[1:18:46] control at
[1:18:48] all and spoke through his lips we're so
[1:18:50] thankful that bar branam just uh
[1:18:55] uh you know he he surrendered his life
[1:18:58] amen that's why God was able to use him
[1:19:02] because a fully surrendered man is
[1:19:04] omnipotent amen and he can use only a
[1:19:07] fully dead person amen this still I'm
[1:19:11] I'm putting a foundation here because
[1:19:13] these are very rich and uh I just hope
[1:19:15] you are okay to read them
[1:19:18] amen one to one he got he's got ways of
[1:19:22] getting his word out you know yes sir
[1:19:25] you see the Bible is God's word not
[1:19:28] man's word amen
[1:19:30] 121 Moses said God spoke to me with a
[1:19:34] voice and I heard him I wrote down what
[1:19:37] he said amen we're so thankful that he
[1:19:39] wrote down otherwise we won't have
[1:19:40] anything written now beautiful Jeremiah
[1:19:44] said I couldn't speak at all and the
[1:19:46] first thing you know my lips was talking
[1:19:49] amen and I was
[1:19:52] writing God spoke through his lips and
[1:19:54] it come to pass yes that's the
[1:19:57] Vindication of a prophetic message amen
[1:19:59] it will come to pass we've been yeah
[1:20:02] brother don't talk about it bra talk
[1:20:04] about it the the the written word the
[1:20:06] spoken word and the manifestation amen
[1:20:08] it's so important if it doesn't come to
[1:20:10] pass not yet maybe right but it will
[1:20:13] come to pass otherwise that word is not
[1:20:16] coming from a prophet and it's not the
[1:20:18] word itself amen it must come to pass
[1:20:21] amen and this message we know it Chang
[1:20:23] Our Lives amen no one can steal our
[1:20:26] testimony it's our personal amen did it
[1:20:28] change you did it it changed my life I
[1:20:30] know amen the old mvin was dead amen I
[1:20:33] hope your your old self was dead too
[1:20:36] amen we we talk about two Natures amen
[1:20:38] the old nature and the new nature the
[1:20:40] old nature we know is the flesh amen
[1:20:43] Romans 8 Romans 7 end of seven but then
[1:20:46] once you cross eternity it's Romans 8
[1:20:48] you see the seven and eight these are
[1:20:50] numerals in the Bible then they are very
[1:20:52] important imagine one verse away one one
[1:20:54] chapter away but you're Crossing
[1:20:57] eternity you might not be in eternity
[1:20:59] now but you're Eternal amen because
[1:21:01] whether you live or you die chist you're
[1:21:04] Christ you'll be Crossing eternity amen
[1:21:07] and it's just a vehicle death is just a
[1:21:09] vehicle so that we can cross over
[1:21:10] another dimension amen don't be afraid
[1:21:12] of death amen amen but physical death is
[1:21:15] important so that God can use us amen
[1:21:18] yes it is amen oh God is so good amen
[1:21:21] next uh quote sorry but these are so
[1:21:25] rich that I I wanted to to read them 123
[1:21:29] you know the Old Testament alone it's
[1:21:31] more than 2,000 times those prophets
[1:21:34] said th said the Lord amen now if a man
[1:21:37] said that's said the lord it's not the
[1:21:39] man talking right amen if he would he
[1:21:42] wouldn't be a prophet amen he'd be a
[1:21:45] hypocrite see cuz it wouldn't never come
[1:21:49] to pass one chance out of 10,000 times
[1:21:54] see they might guess but it's thus said
[1:21:57] the Lord the Lord God has said it amen
[1:22:01] if I would say thus said or man Neville
[1:22:03] my brother say that's said Mr man I'd
[1:22:05] say that's said brother Veil out here or
[1:22:07] some other other Brethren any of you I'm
[1:22:10] speaking what you said if I'm truthful
[1:22:14] I'm saying just what you said amen and
[1:22:17] this man being Prophet said it's not
[1:22:19] time I have nothing to do oh it's not me
[1:22:22] he said it's not me I have nothing to do
[1:22:24] with it but it is thus set the Lord so
[1:22:30] the Bible is thus set the Lord Brother s
[1:22:33] by whom by the prophets that's why we
[1:22:36] believe the prophets it's so important
[1:22:37] brothers and sisters I have a lot
[1:22:40] more bear with
[1:22:43] me notice they took Christ Spirit upon
[1:22:46] themselves and forast you see the events
[1:22:50] that would come to pass talk about
[1:22:52] forecasts so forecast right because they
[1:22:54] they can prophesy the the future amen
[1:22:57] the prophetic insights amen and we know
[1:23:00] and we're given that word amen
[1:23:04] and they said what would take place down
[1:23:07] Through the Ages as they set stood laid
[1:23:09] walked with the spirit of Christ upon
[1:23:12] them in so much that they acted like
[1:23:15] Christ and the readers would read it and
[1:23:17] think that the prophets was speaking of
[1:23:20] themselves that's not the the thing you
[1:23:22] remember the Uno when he was reading
[1:23:24] Isaiah 53:1 about how that he that he
[1:23:28] had wounded he had wounded for our
[1:23:31] transgressions Bruce for our iniquity
[1:23:34] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:23:36] him with his stripes we were healed the
[1:23:38] Uno said to Phillip who is the prophet
[1:23:40] speaking of himself or other men see the
[1:23:45] prophet spoke as it is it was himself
[1:23:49] amen but it's the word of the Lord amen
[1:23:51] amen yes look at David crying
[1:23:56] my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me
[1:24:00] my bones they stare at me at David they
[1:24:03] pierced my feet and my
[1:24:05] hands they pierc my feet and my hands
[1:24:08] but thou will not live my soul in Hell
[1:24:10] neither Willl thou suffer thy Holy One
[1:24:12] to see
[1:24:13] corruption as though David was speaking
[1:24:15] of himself being holy it was the son of
[1:24:19] David that gerti amen spiritual
[1:24:23] seed coming down through here though
[1:24:26] David himself was a cockle bir the flesh
[1:24:29] is a cockle bir right but on the inside
[1:24:33] Hallelujah of there was a wheat grain
[1:24:35] you get it it's not a cockle bir from
[1:24:38] the beginning but this flesh is like our
[1:24:40] our flesh that's why it needs to be born
[1:24:42] again right it needs to be changed
[1:24:44] because it's a cockal bur but the thank
[1:24:46] the Lord God planted the seed the wheat
[1:24:49] seed in US amen so the whole Bible is
[1:24:52] the the word of man neither was it wrot
[1:24:55] by man brought by man or neither can it
[1:24:59] be revealed by man it's God's word amen
[1:25:04] revealed by God himself Hallelujah his
[1:25:08] own
[1:25:09] interpreter Christ revealing himself in
[1:25:12] his own
[1:25:15] word oh brothers and sisters I still
[1:25:18] have more here so the last one here how
[1:25:22] the word of God so perfect
[1:25:26] trust in it folks it's the only thing
[1:25:29] that can save you amen it's not the word
[1:25:31] of man brothers and sisters it's the
[1:25:34] word of God Amen next slide God speaking
[1:25:38] himself through the
[1:25:41] prophets it's so good here because uh
[1:25:43] the topic is God spoke through prophets
[1:25:45] and uh that's how Christ is revealed
[1:25:49] amen amen it's by his own word in his
[1:25:52] own word amen God Speak himself through
[1:25:55] the prophets see they absolutely it it
[1:25:59] isn't the prophets it was God Amen
[1:26:03] because the prophet themselves they
[1:26:05] could they couldn't say those things who
[1:26:08] has believed believed our report Isaiah
[1:26:11] saying you see who has beli our report
[1:26:13] you see even the power of prayers the
[1:26:16] praise reports here amen it's it's the
[1:26:19] prayers of the Saints here and and and
[1:26:22] of course uh whoever is praying that God
[1:26:26] we we tapped on on God's laboratory and
[1:26:29] he heard and he heard our prayers amen
[1:26:32] there's a power there amen there's a
[1:26:34] power and and and when we are sick who
[1:26:37] who are we going to believe amen it's we
[1:26:39] believe the report of the Lord amen not
[1:26:41] not the doctor's report
[1:26:43] Amen to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:26:46] revealed he shall grow up before us as a
[1:26:48] cough in a stall and how that yet he was
[1:26:52] wounded for our transgressions
[1:26:54] amen bruis for our iniquity Chas
[1:26:58] chastisement of our peace upon him with
[1:27:00] his stripes we are healed amen so you
[1:27:02] see the cross of Calvary has two two Co
[1:27:06] covenants there for salvation and for
[1:27:08] healing amen amen it's so it's so good
[1:27:11] to to to know that uh he he gave his
[1:27:15] life for us amen for our salvation and
[1:27:17] for our healing we were healed way over
[1:27:20] here in this age here and Isaiah back y
[1:27:23] 800 years before Christ by stripes we
[1:27:26] were pastent amen already here amen oh
[1:27:30] my how the word of God so perfect trust
[1:27:33] in it folks it's the only thing that can
[1:27:36] save you amen so good so good
[1:27:40] amen and even in uh Galatians uh 1 1:8
[1:27:45] if an angel would come to you from
[1:27:47] Heaven we've been talking about it if
[1:27:50] it's already said if it's already spoken
[1:27:53] that's it amen
[1:27:55] amen and even an angel from heaven will
[1:27:58] come and and say different thing he will
[1:28:01] be a cursed amen so it's very important
[1:28:04] brothers and sisters to know where we
[1:28:05] stand and to know what word We Will We
[1:28:08] Will Follow amen and it's according to
[1:28:10] the word for for our day amen the last
[1:28:14] uh last quote here
[1:28:16] 129 page 18
[1:28:18] brother well now you know he's a good
[1:28:21] God he didn't say he wouldn't you know
[1:28:24] but surely oh me there he is and if he
[1:28:29] was deceitful like that and the Bible
[1:28:32] said in the last days he would deceive
[1:28:33] the elected if it was possible where
[1:28:36] ought we to be today friends now this
[1:28:39] little Sunday school lessons are should
[1:28:40] be carried pretty close you know to our
[1:28:42] hearts to see we ought to listen real
[1:28:45] close and see how deceiving that thing
[1:28:48] is we will be deceived I mean the
[1:28:52] elected will not be deceive amen if if
[1:28:55] it was possible but for us it will not
[1:28:58] be possible but how can we not be
[1:29:00] deceived because we have everything in
[1:29:03] front of us we have the message of the
[1:29:06] hour on our tablet I forgot my phone all
[1:29:09] my notes are there but God is good I
[1:29:11] know it will bring it to to my
[1:29:13] remembrance and then that's good it
[1:29:15] means I will not preach on my notes it
[1:29:17] will be preached according to his
[1:29:20] leadership amen notice we cannot we must
[1:29:24] must not this is a warning to us listen
[1:29:27] to any other man's word right we don't
[1:29:31] care how smart how
[1:29:34] educated the Bible in Proverbs says we
[1:29:36] must cast down reasonings we cannot
[1:29:38] reason on the word brothers and sisters
[1:29:40] amen we cannot isolate coat and then
[1:29:43] live with it and run with it we need to
[1:29:45] have the full message of the hour amen
[1:29:49] amen and sometimes we we we we are
[1:29:53] guilty in uh oh this will justify what
[1:29:56] I'm doing because BR Bram said this but
[1:29:58] how about the other things that he said
[1:30:01] but how about the word BR branam is
[1:30:04] always giving us the direction go back
[1:30:07] to the word amen go back to the full
[1:30:09] word amen don't don't think if if what I
[1:30:12] said is against the word leave it alone
[1:30:14] amen we were we were given that
[1:30:19] instruction so now we'll go to the topic
[1:30:21] that's a foundation so it means every
[1:30:24] everything comes through prophets the
[1:30:25] word comes through prophets amen amen
[1:30:28] and we're so thankful Ezekiel 37
[1:30:34] 1-14 this is uh basically my T because
[1:30:37] the the restoration by the spoken word
[1:30:39] you can see here that's a a this is a a
[1:30:44] very very strong uh or or you can say
[1:30:47] familiar scripture that we have uh read
[1:30:50] before but uh let's dissect it and uh it
[1:30:53] will be a
[1:30:55] like a Sunday school with preaching
[1:30:58] amen Ezekiel 37
[1:31:02] 1-4 oh 1 to4 the hand of the Lord was
[1:31:06] upon me and carried me out in the spirit
[1:31:10] of the Lord and set me down in the midst
[1:31:13] of the valley which was full of Bones
[1:31:15] and caused me to pass by them round
[1:31:18] about and behold there were very many in
[1:31:21] the open Valley and lo they were very
[1:31:23] dry so you see setting the the theme or
[1:31:27] the uh the setting of The of this eek
[1:31:30] Ezekiel
[1:31:32] 37 he
[1:31:33] was uh carried out in the spirit of the
[1:31:36] Lord amen and he was in the midst of the
[1:31:39] valley and they were full of Bones amen
[1:31:43] so it means many dead people right and
[1:31:47] then in the second verse and caus me to
[1:31:49] pass maybe if you can put the the thing
[1:31:51] here brother I mean my my slide in
[1:31:53] instead of the individual one so at
[1:31:55] least we can see the the highlights here
[1:31:58] if you can see the first two verses
[1:32:03] here he is in the midst of the
[1:32:06] valley amen and and an open Valley and
[1:32:11] there were bones they were very dry so
[1:32:14] it means they're dead amen very dry
[1:32:16] bones it means inanimate thing no life
[1:32:20] at all amen and he said unto me son of
[1:32:24] man son of man a prophet so we we're
[1:32:28] trying to to check the restoration by
[1:32:30] the spoken word through the prophet here
[1:32:32] amen and and he's a son of man this is
[1:32:35] Ezekiel it's the Lord talking to the son
[1:32:37] of man and he said unto me son of man
[1:32:41] can this bones
[1:32:43] live and I answered oh Lord God thou
[1:32:46] knowest that's a good answer brothers
[1:32:49] and sisters if we think that we know
[1:32:51] everything we are in trouble amen it
[1:32:54] means we cannot be taught amen amen it's
[1:32:57] better to say I don't know rather than
[1:32:59] saying something and then we we actually
[1:33:01] don't
[1:33:03] know and he said unto me can these bones
[1:33:05] live and I answered oh Lord God thou
[1:33:07] knowest amen it's only the Lord who
[1:33:09] knows everything again he said unto
[1:33:13] me prophesy unto these bones and say
[1:33:17] unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word
[1:33:19] of the Lord
[1:33:21] prophesy prophetic something being said
[1:33:25] amen something being uh uh you know
[1:33:29] forecast amen but then he's talking to
[1:33:33] dry
[1:33:34] bones prophesy unto these bones and say
[1:33:37] unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word
[1:33:39] of the Lord but you know where the pun
[1:33:42] line here is how can they hear if they
[1:33:44] don't have any ears they're bones amen
[1:33:48] amen they are bones nothing very dry
[1:33:51] very dry bones inanimate things
[1:33:54] but he was commanded to prophesy unto
[1:33:56] them amen talk to them and then verse
[1:33:59] five thus said the Lord God unto this
[1:34:02] bones behold I will cause breath to
[1:34:05] enter you and you shall live amen so let
[1:34:09] let's go deeper amen okay now it's
[1:34:12] working the hand of the Lord oh
[1:34:15] sorry verse
[1:34:19] 6 and I will lay Senus upon you and will
[1:34:24] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[1:34:27] with skin and put breath in you and ye
[1:34:30] shall live and ye shall know that I am
[1:34:33] the Lord hallah so you see here there's
[1:34:37] a
[1:34:38] process he will lay Senus I will lay
[1:34:41] Senus upon you and bring up flesh upon
[1:34:43] you and cover you with skin and put
[1:34:45] breath in you and you shall live and you
[1:34:47] shall know that I am the Lord there's a
[1:34:48] process there brothers and sisters we'll
[1:34:50] just continue so I prophesied as I was
[1:34:52] commanded
[1:34:55] as I prophesied there was a noise and
[1:34:58] behold a shaking and the bones came
[1:35:00] together bone to his bone first
[1:35:03] process bone to his bone you see the
[1:35:06] these are many bones these are many
[1:35:08] people brothers and sisters think of it
[1:35:10] as the bride of Christ with many bones
[1:35:13] but he said the bones came together bone
[1:35:15] to his bone with
[1:35:17] this uh
[1:35:20] word the proper bones came because bones
[1:35:23] came can be scattered right that's the
[1:35:25] setting right we have different
[1:35:28] locations but it came when he spoke the
[1:35:31] bones came to the proper bone so it
[1:35:34] means the bone of brother Paul will not
[1:35:36] go to brother Henry's bone right and
[1:35:39] each and everyone so we will have our
[1:35:41] own
[1:35:42] bones we will be set in order right
[1:35:46] because the flesh cannot come into a
[1:35:48] different bone you know you know what
[1:35:50] I'm saying what what I'm saying here is
[1:35:53] bone bone to his bones proper bone to
[1:35:56] his bone brother Henry's bone Brother
[1:35:58] Paul's bones will come together amen
[1:36:02] that's the first step but it can only
[1:36:05] come to pass as it has been prophesied
[1:36:08] as it's been spoken by the prophet amen
[1:36:11] amen and when I beh beheld L the Second
[1:36:15] Step the Senus and the flesh came up
[1:36:19] upon them so you see if if it's a
[1:36:22] different bone if it's a missing bone by
[1:36:25] itself it cannot be it it must be a full
[1:36:28] Bone full structure of a of a human
[1:36:30] being before the Senus and the flesh can
[1:36:33] come upon them amen proper order
[1:36:36] brothers and sisters but it's the word
[1:36:38] of the Lord that can only make that
[1:36:40] happen
[1:36:42] amen the third one is the skin covered
[1:36:45] them above so you see that's the third
[1:36:49] step but there was no breath in them so
[1:36:52] it means it's just a flesh
[1:36:54] bones of his bones flesh of his flesh
[1:36:57] but there's no breath in them so the
[1:37:00] fourth step then he said unto me
[1:37:02] prophesy unto the wind that's the fourth
[1:37:05] step brothers and sisters prophesy it's
[1:37:08] always prophesy because we the bride has
[1:37:10] a Ministry in this last age is to
[1:37:12] prophesy again in Revelations 10:8 to11
[1:37:16] amen prophesy means to teach and preach
[1:37:18] the Full Gospel the message of the hour
[1:37:21] prophesy unto the wind John 3 we know
[1:37:24] the wind bloweth if you want to be born
[1:37:27] again you you must have the Holy Spirit
[1:37:28] In You amen because uh uh New Birth is
[1:37:31] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:37:34] you
[1:37:35] amen prophesy unto the wind prophesy son
[1:37:38] of man and say to the wind thus said the
[1:37:40] Lord God come from the Four Winds oh
[1:37:43] breath and breath up and breathe upon
[1:37:46] this Lane that they may live
[1:37:49] amen so you see the the last verse here
[1:37:53] on on on the tent so I prophesied as he
[1:37:56] commanded me so you see the prophet
[1:37:58] Ezekiel is just following the
[1:38:00] instruction from the Lord he cannot say
[1:38:03] anything different he was commanded same
[1:38:06] for the message uh for the prophet of
[1:38:09] thisa he was commanded to to forerun the
[1:38:12] second coming Amen to bring back to the
[1:38:14] full word amen not partial word but to
[1:38:16] tithe the Loose Ends and everything amen
[1:38:19] so I prophesied as he commanded me and
[1:38:21] the breath came into them amen and they
[1:38:25] lived and stood up upon their feet an
[1:38:28] exceeding great Army oh amen look at
[1:38:31] that what uh because of his spoken word
[1:38:35] amen so you can see
[1:38:37] here if you if you think about it he was
[1:38:40] prophesying to the bones Dry Bones very
[1:38:43] dry they are dead inanimate so what can
[1:38:47] we conclude there that it's the one
[1:38:50] Speaking that can bring forth the Dead
[1:38:53] the inanimate
[1:38:55] objects it's the faith of God in this
[1:39:00] Prophet right that made them
[1:39:03] alive it's not the faith in God but the
[1:39:06] faith of God it was uh preached many
[1:39:08] times that the faith of God is important
[1:39:11] and how how faith comes by hearing and
[1:39:15] Ezekiel we can see here he heard the
[1:39:17] word of the Lord he understood the word
[1:39:20] of the Lord and for us when we hear the
[1:39:23] word of God then the faith of God will
[1:39:24] be in us a and we can prophesy amen and
[1:39:28] we can make things happen that's why the
[1:39:30] restoration by Spoken Word it's very
[1:39:32] powerful brothers and sisters I want to
[1:39:34] encourage each and every one of us
[1:39:36] because we have that power potentially
[1:39:38] brother Bram is sake it's already in US
[1:39:41] amen we we must we must and uh we we
[1:39:45] must heed to that uh word amen through
[1:39:48] the prophet
[1:39:50] amen so you can see here then he said to
[1:39:55] me verse 11 son of man these bones are
[1:40:00] the whole house of Israel behold they
[1:40:02] say our bones are
[1:40:04] dried and our hope is lost we are cut
[1:40:07] off for our parts you see brothers and
[1:40:09] sisters here our hope is lost that's the
[1:40:13] only
[1:40:13] thing God can work on our lives when our
[1:40:17] hope is already lost when we when we uh
[1:40:21] typically a human being will try to
[1:40:23] solve especially in North
[1:40:25] America we think that we have everything
[1:40:28] we have need of nothing because we are
[1:40:30] rich right but we are poor actually amen
[1:40:33] amen but then the thing is the Lord can
[1:40:36] only can only work on our lives when our
[1:40:39] loss is totally lost amen amen when we
[1:40:43] when we already surrendered ourselves
[1:40:44] unto him amen
[1:40:48] therefore prophesy and say unto them
[1:40:50] thus said the Lord God behold oh my
[1:40:52] people I will open your Graves and cause
[1:40:55] you to come up out of your Gades and
[1:40:58] bring you into the land of Israel we
[1:41:00] know this is physical Israel but
[1:41:02] spiritual Israel we are we are the
[1:41:04] spiritual seed amen and you can see out
[1:41:07] of our Graves out
[1:41:09] of for us this this is a grave actually
[1:41:13] this flesh because it needs to it needs
[1:41:16] to be changed that's the reason why it's
[1:41:18] a it's a flesh it's corruptable Amen it
[1:41:21] must be chained amen and shall know that
[1:41:23] I am the Lord when I have opened your
[1:41:26] Graves oh my people and brought you up
[1:41:28] out of your Graves and shall put my
[1:41:30] spirit in you which Spirit the holy
[1:41:32] spirit amen and ye shall live that's the
[1:41:35] only thing that can make us alive is is
[1:41:38] his spirit amen and I shall place you in
[1:41:41] your own land adoption amen then shall
[1:41:46] ye know that I the Lord have spoken it
[1:41:49] and performed it said the Lord so you
[1:41:51] see it's all about him amen not us we
[1:41:53] are just his tools we're just we know
[1:41:56] we're the bride he cannot uh he's
[1:41:58] perfect with us amen and we're perfect
[1:42:01] with him because there's Unity at that
[1:42:03] day you shall know that I in my father
[1:42:06] and the father in me and ye in me and I
[1:42:08] in you what's that
[1:42:10] Oneness right it means he's not perfect
[1:42:14] without us he's the head we are the body
[1:42:16] amen it's so good to understand that uh
[1:42:19] you can see here the pro the Ezekiel 37
[1:42:23] is about
[1:42:24] order right before the breath can come
[1:42:28] in everything must be in place even with
[1:42:30] our lives brothers and sisters before
[1:42:33] the Holy Ghost can come in our lives
[1:42:35] should be in order amen amen otherwise
[1:42:38] even small things we always talk about
[1:42:40] it little foxes spoil the the vine amen
[1:42:45] those little things brothers and sisters
[1:42:46] they they matter because even even the
[1:42:50] even the message of this hour he tied
[1:42:52] the Loose Ends not the big uh big
[1:42:54] doctrines of justification s
[1:42:56] sanctification or baptism of the Holy
[1:42:58] Ghost he tied the Loose Ends because
[1:43:00] they are important it's honing time
[1:43:03] right we need to be shaped In His Image
[1:43:06] amen we all those imperfections in our
[1:43:09] bodies in our in our character amen they
[1:43:12] need to be cut and and honed we need to
[1:43:17] be home to his image amen the image and
[1:43:20] likeness of His Image amen
[1:43:23] you see here just tie tying in this uh
[1:43:27] Ezekiel 37 with the the restoration of
[1:43:29] the brighter in the message it's so good
[1:43:31] when uh when you read the scripture and
[1:43:34] then the message of the hour will just
[1:43:36] du tail uh uh because the message of the
[1:43:39] hour is none other than the Bible itself
[1:43:41] it's just a tool for us so that we will
[1:43:43] understand the the Bible you cannot just
[1:43:45] say that oh it's already revealed the
[1:43:47] you don't need a prophet but how can you
[1:43:50] how can you understand the message
[1:43:51] without the prophet he is our magnifying
[1:43:54] glass he our compass pointing us to the
[1:43:56] North Star right right it's not and if
[1:44:00] it doesn't point to the North Star then
[1:44:02] it's a different message right so that's
[1:44:04] why we have to place this properly the
[1:44:06] absolute is the word amen the message
[1:44:09] was used so that we can go to the
[1:44:11] absolute amen you you can see here just

[1:46:45] Pentecost with the restoration of the
[1:46:47] gifts the gifts the holy the Holy Ghost

[1:47:10] processes are very required so that the
[1:47:13] Holy Ghost himself can can come upon us
[1:47:16] and live in us and we're the one
[1:47:18] representing him amen wherever we go
[1:47:21] isn't that beautiful the word the word

[1:47:35] to go
[1:47:39] again next slide yeah okay one of them
[1:47:44] Martin
[1:47:45] Luther he begin to shine a light there
[1:47:49] was a little light just a very small
[1:47:51] strength of justification
[1:47:54] Along come Wesley stronger
[1:47:57] sanctification after Wesley come the
[1:48:00] stronger than him Pentecostal the
[1:48:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost in another
[1:48:04] great in another great prophet see but
[1:48:08] in the last days amen of Malachi 4
[1:48:13] Elijah is to come with the very word
[1:48:16] amen because he's a word Prophet that's
[1:48:18] why we believe in BR Branham amen the
[1:48:20] word of the Lord came to the prophet so
[1:48:23] you see we're we're just trying to dub
[1:48:25] tail all these things together in the
[1:48:27] evening
[1:48:28] light is to come forth to restore and
[1:48:32] bring back what turn the hearts of the
[1:48:35] children back to the faith of God forth
[1:48:38] light amen that's very important four
[1:48:40] Killers took it four Messengers

[1:48:56] again prophesy son of man can this bones
[1:49:01] live wish we had time I got it right
[1:49:04] down here but I have to miss that
[1:49:06] prophesy can this bones live what's the
[1:49:09] fourth
[1:49:10] what what are the four stages of that
[1:49:13] coming forth of that church what's the
[1:49:15] four stages of ezekiel's dry bones
[1:49:18] coming forth but the life only come not
[1:49:21] when the S senor knew skin was on them
[1:49:25] but when the wind blowed upon them
[1:49:27] that's when come back that fourth
[1:49:30] message of life amen so you see it's a
[1:49:32] process when when we are in order then
[1:49:35] the message of life will come in amen I
[1:49:39] will restore said the Lord Allelujah
[1:49:41] Glory praise be to God the fourth light
[1:49:44] is to come that will bring forth the
[1:49:47] same signs watch justification brought
[1:49:50] back the p sanctification brought back
[1:49:54] the bark doctrine of Holiness what
[1:49:57] brought back the leaf Pentecostals what
[1:50:00] is it Pentecostal leaves clap their
[1:50:02] hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal amen
[1:50:04] we're not against the
[1:50:06] Pentecost the Pentecostal but they
[1:50:09] denominated right we're against the
[1:50:11] organization amen the way the way they
[1:50:14] denominated amen but uh we love the
[1:50:17] people amen amen but the the
[1:50:20] denomination of Pentecostal is is is the
[1:50:23] issue it's not the Pentecost Pentecost
[1:50:25] is uh you know uh having the spirit of
[1:50:28] God in us
[1:50:30] amen 513 what the fourth was the word
[1:50:34] itself it's just to to emphasize clearly
[1:50:37] that it's the word coming the bride
[1:50:39] coming amen the second coming of the
[1:50:41] Bride is is a timeline it doesn't happen
[1:50:43] in only in 1963 it's happening right now
[1:50:47] because we are in the Rapture amen and
[1:50:49] when you're in the Rapture you canot go
[1:50:51] out of the rapture
[1:50:53] but the culmination is the meeting in
[1:50:54] the air amen and that's what we are
[1:50:56] looking for amen the chains of bodies
[1:50:58] happening right now amen it didn't stop
[1:51:02] uh or it's not an event it's a timeline
[1:51:05] it's a it's a process amen amen what the
[1:51:09] fourth was the word itself the word made
[1:51:11] flesh fruits of the proof of the
[1:51:15] Resurrection Resurrection sign that
[1:51:17] Christ has finally after justification
[1:51:20] been planted amen sanctification been
[1:51:23] planted baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:27] organizations died out as Christ has
[1:51:30] again centered himself like the cup of
[1:51:34] the pyramid amen I have that uh in the
[1:51:37] next slide first line justification amen
[1:51:42] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:46] then what then coming of the cup amen
[1:51:48] it's a process am th perfection I I
[1:51:53] believe so and then the fourth one is
[1:51:55] you can see is a living the life
[1:51:57] itself what is it that God that the Holy
[1:52:02] Ghost 5 on4 what is it the that Holy
[1:52:04] Ghost Bunch being honed out so that it
[1:52:08] can be it can fit with the same kind of
[1:52:11] ministry fitting so you see the mortar
[1:52:13] there's no mortar between the the cap
[1:52:16] and the and the pyramid I'll show you
[1:52:18] after he had he had when he went away
[1:52:23] that when he comes back it will catch
[1:52:25] the whole thing in the Rapture where the
[1:52:28] Justified Sanctified and baptism of the
[1:52:30] Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again
[1:52:33] the house of God will live again yes the
[1:52:36] tree of life is growing again amen it's
[1:52:39] being restored
[1:52:41] so I added more here because we we read
[1:52:45] Ezekiel
[1:52:48] 37 so we know this is very important and
[1:52:52] we know as a hole it will be a hole
[1:52:55] that's the cap and this bottom here must
[1:52:57] be equal to this bottom here so that it
[1:52:59] can fit otherwise there will be uh there
[1:53:03] will be holes or licks right so I think
[1:53:05] it's brother meno who who preached that
[1:53:08] there's no mortar between this and here
[1:53:10] and Barberry expounded on that that this
[1:53:12] is a whole pyramid now amen this is the
[1:53:15] body but this is Jesus Christ the head
[1:53:17] amen but you can see here it's a process
[1:53:20] it's a maturing thing we need to
[1:53:23] so that we can we can bear fruit right
[1:53:26] it it has to go to the uh the the WID it
[1:53:30] has go through the stock tassel Shack
[1:53:33] and then the the wheat itself amen from
[1:53:35] rotten
[1:53:36] seed to matur seed which is a Rapture
[1:53:39] seed raptured seed amen but if I will
[1:53:43] connect it to to ezekiel's uh thir
[1:53:46] Ezekiel
[1:53:47] 37 very dry bones death we we know that
[1:53:51] uh through through Through the Ages
[1:53:53] until until tayra we call it dark ages
[1:53:56] because of doctrines bra Bram is saying
[1:53:58] even uh it's in the church seven Church
[1:54:01] ages it died out because of doctrines
[1:54:04] because of uh dogmas because of uh the
[1:54:08] nanism uh bism everything and then
[1:54:11] there's no T is Dark Ages amen so it
[1:54:15] means it's just like a very dry bones
[1:54:17] there's no life in it but then the
[1:54:19] message of Life comes through the bones
[1:54:22] sinu skin is through Luther Wesley and
[1:54:25] bar Branham here and then now we will
[1:54:28] have the great the Breath of Life
[1:54:29] restored great Army which is the bride
[1:54:31] age we have brother brother David just
[1:54:36] uh reemphasized uh the bride AIDS we're
[1:54:38] living in the bride AGS right now
[1:54:40] brothers and sisters though we see the
[1:54:41] loudy out there we're living up here on
[1:54:44] the bride AIDS and you can see here this
[1:54:47] is where we're living it's the bride
[1:54:49] coming of Jesus Christ in the of you and
[1:54:53] me amen it's very important to see all
[1:54:55] this uh uh process that uh when you
[1:54:59] think that uh something it hurts right
[1:55:02] when when God is correcting us
[1:55:04] correction is is good for us CH
[1:55:06] chastisement we need those even even the
[1:55:09] oysters we we I just checked uh it's
[1:55:12] just a simple thing is uh it came out of
[1:55:16] wounds in the Oyster that produces the
[1:55:18] pearls so it means uh yeah you can you
[1:55:21] can search that that it's good so all
[1:55:23] these wounds all these uh trials
[1:55:25] afflictions they're important to us so
[1:55:27] that we can produce pearls or pearl of
[1:55:30] great price amen amen so anyway so the
[1:55:33] proper the proper uh process is it has
[1:55:37] to go bones to his bones and then sinus
[1:55:40] of and flesh and then skin and then it
[1:55:43] will be
[1:55:45] restored the the life the the breath of
[1:55:47] life it will each and every one of us we
[1:55:50] are great armies not only
[1:55:52] it's on not one bride it's many member
[1:55:55] body
[1:55:56] amen I I have some
[1:55:59] uh uh science trivia here I I I just
[1:56:03] thought uh it's so nice to share uh
[1:56:08] so you know that uh we have a
[1:56:11] cardiovascular system in the body in our
[1:56:15] body right cardiovascular means uh it's
[1:56:18] it's a network it's a system so it's
[1:56:21] it's composed of members of the of the
[1:56:24] cardio or you can say organs and the
[1:56:27] main main organ there is the heart and
[1:56:31] the Heart con uh is connected through
[1:56:34] blood vessels arteries coming out of the
[1:56:38] heart to individual organs and veins to
[1:56:42] go back to the heart but in between in
[1:56:45] between the the connection of the
[1:56:47] arteries and and veins they are
[1:56:50] capillaries and science is saying I
[1:56:52] checked it in J gbt Google everywhere
[1:56:57] they are around 100,000 kilomet of blood
[1:57:00] vessels the length Okay the distance you
[1:57:03] think of 100,000 kilometers if you think
[1:57:06] about it when you're driving it's
[1:57:07] typically average of 20,000 kilometers
[1:57:10] per year so if you drive today you will
[1:57:13] be there in
[1:57:14] 2029 if if you will model the the the
[1:57:18] length of the the blood vessels right so
[1:57:21] what
[1:57:22] so but what are the per or or or the
[1:57:25] functions of these blood vessels is to
[1:57:28] bring and and uh I mean to to send blood
[1:57:32] to each organ right to each part of the
[1:57:35] body right so that they can have oxygen
[1:57:38] so that they live amen and uh long story
[1:57:42] short of this is uh we need to make our
[1:57:46] vessels blood vessels to be
[1:57:49] unclogged because most sicknesses
[1:57:52] are caused by not having the the blood
[1:57:55] flowing through that part of the body
[1:57:58] spiritually if we are disconnected we
[1:58:00] might not receive blood from the heart
[1:58:03] so it means we need to to be part of a
[1:58:07] body of the body so that we can function
[1:58:10] properly right amen so how can we make
[1:58:15] this vessels
[1:58:17] unclogged science is saying eat the
[1:58:19] right diet balanced diet I'm I'm guilty
[1:58:22] I love
[1:58:23] sweets amen I'm sure many are right not
[1:58:28] full of
[1:58:29] cholesterol
[1:58:31] exercise uh regularly which I'm
[1:58:35] struggling right but physically what's
[1:58:38] that feeding the word right amen right
[1:58:41] if you natural types the spiritual I I
[1:58:44] was just amazed by by this trivia here
[1:58:47] science trivia which is so important
[1:58:49] that if you disconnect or something is
[1:58:51] clogged then that portion or organ or
[1:58:55] part of that body will will
[1:58:57] suffer right so so how to unag that
[1:59:00] channel is to eat the right word not
[1:59:04] hybrid word amen right pure word amen
[1:59:08] amen if it is a hybrid with cholesterol
[1:59:10] High fats right all these things GMO
[1:59:14] right genetically modified we don't want
[1:59:16] those we want the full word that's
[1:59:18] coming from the mouth of God amen amen
[1:59:21] it's so important and exercise what
[1:59:23] exercise our faith amen through what
[1:59:25] through prayers we we we've seen a lot
[1:59:28] of uh praise reports brothers and
[1:59:30] sisters it's almost impossible to think
[1:59:33] that uh uh you know uh brother or sister
[1:59:38] uh Snow's brother he fell broken ribs
[1:59:41] and everything and now he's
[1:59:43] discharged there's power in that
[1:59:45] brothers and sisters but we need to be
[1:59:47] connected to the body amen it's very
[1:59:50] important that uh we need to be there
[1:59:53] amen we need to be connected amen and so
[1:59:55] that the blood can flow through US amen
[1:59:58] it's so important so you can
[2:00:01] see it's a process amen and what once
[2:00:05] everything is in Pro proper order then
[2:00:08] the life can come in amen that's why the
[2:00:11] bride AIDS is so important to to
[2:00:14] understand where we stand right now amen
[2:00:17] let so I know I I talk about this last
[2:00:21] time so you can see
[2:00:24] Ephesus 118 years but loud this is
[2:00:28] already 119 years but we know we're
[2:00:30] living in the bride age right now but
[2:00:32] laa as we can see out there is is still
[2:00:35] laa but we are seeing it because we have
[2:00:38] that prophetic Insight we have the
[2:00:40] Flying Eagle anointing that we can see
[2:00:42] what's going on that's why for us we
[2:00:44] already Eternal amen because we have
[2:00:47] Christ in us that's why whether we live
[2:00:49] or we die we will we will cross eternity
[2:00:52] so you can see here it already
[2:00:54] passed Ephesus brother Bram is saying L
[2:00:59] DEA will be a quick age you can see here
[2:01:01] the corn of wheat listen to the
[2:01:04] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[2:01:07] in this last age very important I will
[2:01:09] keep encouraging you and keep uh uh
[2:01:13] telling this that we need the prophet of
[2:01:15] this age amen what he says from God the
[2:01:19] bride will say so you see pting the
[2:01:22] prophet is not a problem it's not a it's
[2:01:24] not a it's not an issue we don't need to
[2:01:27] make it look good or sound good we just
[2:01:30] have to to to say what he says amen
[2:01:34] because you see Ezekiel he he just
[2:01:37] followed What the Lord said to him
[2:01:39] prophesy so did he say anything
[2:01:43] no so it's so important for us brothers
[2:01:46] and sisters we know we if you mix this
[2:01:49] with psychology there there will be a
[2:01:50] problem it's a hybrid
[2:01:52] amen same for our organs in the body
[2:01:55] they will be sick if it is a hybrid food
[2:01:57] that we eat amen it it will not be a
[2:01:59] good flowing Blood Bad circula uh
[2:02:02] circulation amen yes listen to the
[2:02:05] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[2:02:07] in this last age what he says from God
[2:02:11] the bride will
[2:02:13] say the spirit and the
[2:02:16] prophet and the
[2:02:18] bride amen will be saying the same thing
[2:02:21] am
[2:02:22] Hallelujah and what they will say will
[2:02:25] have already been said in the word we're
[2:02:28] just repeating what the word says
[2:02:29] brothers and sisters they are saying it
[2:02:32] now come out from among her now and be
[2:02:36] separate the shock is separating so that
[2:02:39] the full width can be uh in the Garner
[2:02:41] amen the cry has gone out the cry is
[2:02:45] going out how long will the voice cry we
[2:02:49] do not know but one thing we do know it
[2:02:52] won't be long for this is the last age
[2:02:54] so you see louia is the last age but
[2:02:56] then because we're Eternal amen praise
[2:02:59] the Lord so we are we are in the bride
[2:03:02] age amen the corn of wheat the bride
[2:03:11] wheat in order to understand
[2:03:14] sorry the wealth of of meaning involved
[2:03:17] in behold I have set before you an open
[2:03:20] door and no can shut it we must now
[2:03:23] recall what has been said about each age
[2:03:26] running over into another age Barberry
[2:03:28] already explained that that it's not a
[2:03:30] direct cut that after Philadelphia it
[2:03:32] will be loud there will be overlapping
[2:03:34] and same for the bride age right so
[2:03:37] before going to Bright AG there will be
[2:03:39] a a transition amen it's not a direct
[2:03:42] cut but then the thing is spiritually we
[2:03:45] are in the bright AIDS because God
[2:03:47] Spirit holy spirit is in us that's why
[2:03:50] it's very important to know that our
[2:03:53] election is sure amen we have to make
[2:03:55] our calling and election sure amen the
[2:03:57] seventh age a very short
[2:04:01] age gathers
[2:04:03] up into himself for one quick
[2:04:07] work all the evil of every age and yet
[2:04:10] all the reality of Pentecost Hallelujah
[2:04:13] once the Philadelphian age has about run
[2:04:16] its course the ludian AIDS quickly comes
[2:04:18] in bringing both the tears and the wheat
[2:04:20] to harvest first bind the tears to burn
[2:04:24] to burn them but gather the wheat into
[2:04:26] my barn that's Matthew 13:30
[2:04:31] amen you see here so that we know uh uh
[2:04:34] it's just a reminder for us always
[2:04:40] right in in in paragraph
[2:04:44] 64 Fe of the trumpets now if I come with
[2:04:48] the message of
[2:04:50] Pentecost I would be in the Lan Church
[2:04:53] age and it wouldn't be right so you see
[2:04:57] when when we're trying to study we
[2:04:59] should not isolate although they they
[2:05:02] need to Dove tail with what uh what the
[2:05:05] message of the hour is because he he
[2:05:07] progressed his Revelation progressed but
[2:05:09] we cannot go the bride beyond the
[2:05:12] revelation of the Prophet because we are
[2:05:13] under him amen the message that we
[2:05:15] preach the gospel that will be preached
[2:05:18] the five-fold ministry will be under the
[2:05:21] umbrella of this message of the hour we
[2:05:23] cannot put Beyond it amen and and people
[2:05:26] are saying some some who who went out or
[2:05:31] they were longtime Believers of the
[2:05:33] message they saying we don't need the
[2:05:35] message anymore because the full word is
[2:05:36] already revealed how did that word got
[2:05:40] revealed to you amen if you are honest
[2:05:43] in ourselves we didn't even know
[2:05:45] anything amen right we might know the
[2:05:49] Bible but then to dve tail scripture to
[2:05:52] scripture you need a prophet reading
[2:05:54] between the lines you need the
[2:05:56] prophet it's it's very important for us
[2:05:59] to understand that we need a prophet
[2:06:02] amen so that we understand he's not God
[2:06:05] but the word of God comes through him
[2:06:08] and for us being the bride we are not
[2:06:10] God but the word of God comes through us
[2:06:12] and then we yes sir we say it we we
[2:06:16] preach it we teach it
[2:06:18] amen you see that's the reason that West
[2:06:21] could not take Luther's
[2:06:23] message Luther was in one age Church age
[2:06:27] and Wesley was his was in another age if
[2:06:30] Jesus would come in with the message of
[2:06:33] Moses it would not have worked if Moses
[2:06:36] would have come with the message of Noah
[2:06:38] it would not have worked so you see
[2:06:40] important why it's called message of the
[2:06:42] hour what hour this hour yes sir amen
[2:06:45] it's so important for us to know because
[2:06:47] uh what's the evidence that we have the
[2:06:49] Holy Ghost we have the ability to
[2:06:51] receive the word for our day we know all
[2:06:54] this amen brothers and I'm just
[2:06:55] reminding you brothers and sisters
[2:06:57] because uh so to to show that we are
[2:07:01] really in the bright a brother Branham
[2:07:03] said there are six places in the b in
[2:07:05] the message if you if you will search it
[2:07:07] but I will only read two the word that
[2:07:11] fell on the day of
[2:07:12] Pentecost so you see that's Lan Church
[2:07:15] AIDS the message there of for laia is
[2:07:17] Pentecost but actually the bride AIDS is
[2:07:19] more than that it's beyond that the word
[2:07:22] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[2:07:23] not work this day that's no sir that was
[2:07:26] for Pentecost yes sir this is for the
[2:07:30] bride amen going home of the Bride we
[2:07:34] got something
[2:07:36] different the Pentecostals represented
[2:07:39] that again we are in the bride age amen
[2:07:43] no more than the word of law would work
[2:07:46] in the days of Moses right no more than
[2:07:48] Moses law would have worked in the time
[2:07:50] of Paul here he tried to tell them you
[2:07:52] are dead to that and you cannot have
[2:07:55] that amen oh Brothers again another one
[2:07:58] which is good
[2:08:02] too we're not
[2:08:04] living in a Pentecostal age we're living
[2:08:08] in another age see we're not living in
[2:08:11] the Methodist age we're living in
[2:08:14] another age we're living on up here to
[2:08:18] the bride age the calling out of the
[2:08:21] church
[2:08:22] and getting it together for the Rapture
[2:08:25] amen that's the age that we're now
[2:08:27] living to my honest opinion that's
[2:08:29] exactly the truth you see we are in the
[2:08:31] Rapture age right now brothers and
[2:08:33] sisters the second if if I will just do
[2:08:37] this quickly you can see the bride AIDS
[2:08:39] here is the second coming of the lord
[2:08:41] it's a it's a timeline when the seals
[2:08:44] were open 1963 until the Rapture the
[2:08:46] only thing that we don't know is when he
[2:08:49] will come exactly when we will meet him
[2:08:51] in in the air but we know we already
[2:08:53] came he appeared right so you can see
[2:08:56] here the shout the voice and the trumpet
[2:08:57] the trumpet is the meeting in the air
[2:09:00] and we don't know when exactly is that
[2:09:02] because no one knows even the scripture
[2:09:05] is saying but we know it will come amen
[2:09:07] right so you can see here I will not
[2:09:10] tackle this because this is a a sermon
[2:09:13] by itself so you can see so it's a
[2:09:17] process brothers and sisters you can see
[2:09:20] you can see you can see it's a process
[2:09:22] it's it's good for our living it's life
[2:09:27] amen amen if if this message of the hour
[2:09:29] will not produce life in you then
[2:09:31] something's wrong because the thing is
[2:09:33] we we are bound to you know we're human
[2:09:37] beings we need to
[2:09:39] work we need to live uh we we we we are
[2:09:45] created uh so that we can live amen and
[2:09:48] we live by dead sub substance and uh uh
[2:09:51] we need to work so that we can leave
[2:09:53] it's not the other way around we don't
[2:09:55] leave to work so it means uh we we were
[2:09:58] checking what will we we will do when we
[2:10:01] retire because uh most of my colleagues
[2:10:04] who retired they're kind of a little a
[2:10:06] little bit uh older but then they come
[2:10:09] back and then my first question is why
[2:10:12] did you come back I have nothing to do
[2:10:14] what but for us it's different right we
[2:10:18] have something to do because the thing
[2:10:19] is uh uh I've been in fellowship with
[2:10:23] with some of the brothers and uh about
[2:10:26] about the the programs in the church
[2:10:28] because
[2:10:29] uh the brother in the Philippines was a
[2:10:32] missionary and established around 200
[2:10:34] churches his life he's a missionary at
[2:10:36] the same time pastor and his message is
[2:10:39] uh uh missions for him is not just a
[2:10:43] program in the church he said it's the
[2:10:47] purpose of its existence because the
[2:10:49] thing is when I thought of it even Jesus
[2:10:52] Christ didn't have his own church
[2:10:54] because he's the church he's the one
[2:10:56] going he he built or I mean established
[2:10:58] church in Antioch in in in Ephesus
[2:11:01] wherever he he went right but then the
[2:11:04] thing is churches were established where
[2:11:07] he will go but for us we we are product
[2:11:09] of of something that uh uh you know uh
[2:11:13] this church as I can see is a is a
[2:11:15] product of someone that has the burden
[2:11:19] right to to have a church
[2:11:21] and it's it just evolved and and it's so
[2:11:24] good that but then the thing is what
[2:11:26] what I'm trying to say here is it's uh
[2:11:29] missions is are important missions are
[2:11:31] very important because they establish
[2:11:33] churches and missions means apostleship
[2:11:36] right that's
[2:11:37] why bra Bram is saying you might be the
[2:11:40] three of the people there you might be a
[2:11:41] prayer Warrior you might be a financial
[2:11:44] supporter or you must be a minister who
[2:11:46] goes to Mission so either way you will
[2:11:49] be used if if you cannot go send someone
[2:11:52] but it doesn't mean you have to go
[2:11:54] overseas or wherever because our our
[2:11:55] mission field is our home it start
[2:11:58] starts with our home I'm always guilty
[2:12:00] in that because the thing is we're we're
[2:12:02] busy in in this daily in our daily lives
[2:12:05] and we work we have to feed our families
[2:12:08] but we have to think of the focus as
[2:12:11] well we need to balance as well that we
[2:12:12] need to Fe our families too right we
[2:12:15] cannot just go and forget about our
[2:12:17] families because uh that's not how it is
[2:12:20] designed amen amen but uh yeah going
[2:12:23] back to that they they come
[2:12:25] without they're saying they have nothing
[2:12:27] to do but for us if we will retire we
[2:12:30] know we have a lot of things to do for
[2:12:31] the Lord amen and we can surrender
[2:12:33] ourselves amen five
[2:12:37] minutes so about this Romans 10:17 so
[2:12:40] then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[2:12:42] by the word of God but in Ezekiel it's
[2:12:44] the one Speaking that has the faith the
[2:12:47] the one that operates is the faith of
[2:12:49] the one speaking it's not the bones
[2:12:51] because they didn't have any ears right
[2:12:53] but then the thing is that faith of that
[2:12:55] Prophet was operated because he heard
[2:12:58] from the Lord amen the faith of God was
[2:13:01] in Ezekiel that's why he was able to
[2:13:04] prophesy and do it and and and it came
[2:13:07] to pass same for us when we hear the the
[2:13:12] faith of
[2:13:13] God when we hear it cometh by hearing
[2:13:16] hearing by the word of God when we read
[2:13:17] the when we read the Bible when when we
[2:13:20] feed when we pray we hear right the
[2:13:23] faith will come by hearing hearing by
[2:13:25] the word of God do you hear it do you
[2:13:27] understand it that's that's what it
[2:13:29] meant amen and it's very good to know
[2:13:31] that it's the faith of God in us that
[2:13:33] will operate it amen through the prophet
[2:13:36] of this age amen so
[2:13:39] important he that receiveth Matthew
[2:13:42] 10:41 so you see it's not only what
[2:13:45] brother Branham say it's also the word
[2:13:46] says amen he that receiveth a prophet in
[2:13:49] the name of a prophet
[2:13:51] shall receive a prophet's reward and he
[2:13:55] that receiveth a righteous man are you
[2:13:56] Righteous Brothers and sister we are
[2:13:58] Justified amen we are made righteous
[2:14:01] because he owns US fully amen he that
[2:14:04] receiveth a righteous man in the name of
[2:14:06] a righteous man shall receive a
[2:14:07] righteous man's reward what is the
[2:14:09] reward of a righteous man eternal life
[2:14:11] amen and if if if they will hear us and
[2:14:14] they will receive us they will have
[2:14:16] eternal life that's right even they will
[2:14:18] not be bride but they can be a amen they
[2:14:21] can have eternal life the cup of cold
[2:14:23] water Matthew 24 important that's why we
[2:14:27] must not provoke other people to
[2:14:29] blaspheme us or blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[2:14:32] in US amen it's so important be careful
[2:14:34] that if they don't understand they might
[2:14:36] not be redeemable but then if they give
[2:14:39] you a cup of cold water they can be
[2:14:41] Eternal they might not be in the city
[2:14:43] they might not be bride right am but
[2:14:46] they can be in eternity with us amen
[2:14:50] amen so important important though
[2:14:51] brothers and
[2:14:55] sisters oh that's good we are on
[2:14:58] time I have three more slides I think so
[2:15:02] God through a
[2:15:06] seed of his word and there's only one
[2:15:09] thing that can Quicken the
[2:15:11] word and that is the spirit for it is
[2:15:15] the lifegiver to the
[2:15:17] word and when the life in the word meets
[2:15:21] the life of the spirit it produces
[2:15:23] whatever the seed is amen there are two
[2:15:25] seeds right exactly right we are wheat
[2:15:27] and tears but I mean there are two seeds
[2:15:30] wheat and tears but we are the wheat
[2:15:31] amen and uh how did we become Wheat by
[2:15:34] his four knowledge he knew that we will
[2:15:37] accept the message of the hour that's
[2:15:38] why we be he he predestinated us amen
[2:15:43] it's not by works of righteousness but
[2:15:45] by his grace alone that's so important
[2:15:47] brothers and sisters oh that seed is so
[2:15:51] is it's very important to know what kind
[2:15:53] of seed we have right and and and by
[2:15:56] their fruits you shall know them amen
[2:15:59] and and and and actually uh I I just saw
[2:16:03] a a good uh reading here there because
[2:16:06] uh there are two types of Salvation that
[2:16:09] uh that's being said by by others the
[2:16:12] wrong non-biblical way is uh they're
[2:16:16] saying
[2:16:17] Faith plus Works equals salvation ation
[2:16:22] so those are Faith oh th those are Works
[2:16:24] based salvation you cannot you cannot
[2:16:27] work your salvation right uh by by doing
[2:16:30] good works but the right biblical way is
[2:16:33] salvation is equal to Faith plus Works
[2:16:38] our faith when we are saved it will
[2:16:40] produce the fruits fruits of the holy
[2:16:43] spirit amen that's that's the proper way
[2:16:45] to to check uh how Faith Works because
[2:16:49] for by grace
[2:16:51] Ephesians 28:9 we are saved through
[2:16:54] faith not by works less anount should
[2:16:57] boast because when we think that oh
[2:16:58] we're doing good oh we give all these
[2:17:01] things uh we we we we tight uh
[2:17:04] Faithfully yes that's good and and and
[2:17:07] and that will uh that that will benefit
[2:17:10] us I I I I just uh I just remember one
[2:17:14] thing here about paying tights and
[2:17:17] paying our offerings so
[2:17:19] basically if we do good things it is it
[2:17:23] is said you pay your tis it's not you
[2:17:25] give your
[2:17:26] tis I don't know why I went there I just
[2:17:29] remember that paying means you owe you
[2:17:32] owe it giving means you're freely giving
[2:17:36] it but uh you pay your tithes because it
[2:17:41] everything belongs to God even our
[2:17:43] time right so it means wow wow that's
[2:17:47] that's a good thing because that word
[2:17:49] will make a difference because we think
[2:17:50] oh I'm I'm giving all my tights no
[2:17:53] you're not giving you're paying because
[2:17:56] because you owe the Lord everything
[2:17:58] Belongs to the Lord and he's just giving
[2:18:01] 10% we cannot even uh Escape
[2:18:04] taxes right imposed by the government
[2:18:08] how about the Lords right but then the
[2:18:10] thing is I I I was just surmising here
[2:18:13] and and and thinking or not even
[2:18:15] presuming because it's in the word what
[2:18:17] you do
[2:18:19] today right because
[2:18:21] um uh Abraham paid tis to melkisedek I
[2:18:25] know it has been preached before then it
[2:18:28] was accounted for Levi but Abraham is
[2:18:30] not oh Levi is not Abraham's son it's
[2:18:33] even to the Next Generation what you're
[2:18:35] doing today and sorry I'm a Treasurer so
[2:18:40] I I was just I was just thinking oh
[2:18:44] those people I will not name names but
[2:18:46] if if he's okay I I would tell I would
[2:18:49] want to thank brother Paul for example
[2:18:51] what once I'm seeing he had that desire
[2:18:55] to have this church established he
[2:18:57] wanted baren to be a full-time Pastor
[2:19:00] sorry BR bar Paul I just I just thought
[2:19:03] I will tell this but look at the
[2:19:05] inheritance all the children
[2:19:07] grandchildren because he's
[2:19:10] so he's so honest faithful in it I just
[2:19:14] want to make it as an example just to
[2:19:16] give BR Paul and his family a bouquet of
[2:19:19] flower I I was just so amazed that uh a
[2:19:23] man can can have that desire so that
[2:19:25] this church will be built and you can
[2:19:27] see we are
[2:19:29] growing God
[2:19:31] is God is good I mean what I'm saying
[2:19:34] here is if you do something good today
[2:19:37] it might you might not be the one who
[2:19:38] will reap the
[2:19:40] consequences it could be your children
[2:19:42] and your grandchildren Grand
[2:19:43] grandchildren if the Lord ties am
[2:19:46] there's a good cause in it brothers and
[2:19:48] sisters amen oh it's just so important
[2:19:51] but then it's the same thing when you do
[2:19:54] evil things your descendants could also
[2:19:59] reap those
[2:20:00] consequences oh brothers and sisters
[2:20:02] sinning it's your choice it's our choice
[2:20:05] if we sin but the consequences is not
[2:20:07] our choice amen so we better choose the
[2:20:10] right thing brothers and sisters it's so
[2:20:12] important sorry bar Paul but uh I hope
[2:20:15] you are also blessed in it that giving
[2:20:19] is not giving tis it's paying TI it
[2:20:21] belongs to him anything beyond 10% can
[2:20:24] be an offering but you can you can give
[2:20:26] what you what everything uh all all all
[2:20:30] of what you have if if the denominations
[2:20:33] are are tapping on that principle of
[2:20:35] Malachi
[2:20:36] 3:10 give give give give they're all
[2:20:39] give give give right but they are being
[2:20:41] blessed because it's a principle it's a
[2:20:43] principle in the Bible right although
[2:20:46] they might not have the word the full
[2:20:48] word but they are reaping the
[2:20:50] consequence of what they they're tapping
[2:20:52] on right because it's the word of God
[2:20:54] the word of God
[2:20:56] will we will will not come void amen
[2:21:00] It's always important amen oh I don't
[2:21:03] know why I went there but then the thing
[2:21:05] is it's so good to encourage you
[2:21:07] brothers and sisters that uh amen when
[2:21:09] you pay your tis amen when you give your
[2:21:13] offerings amen there's a good uh
[2:21:17] consequence that will come out of it
[2:21:19] amen and it's it doesn't belong to us
[2:21:21] even that's why we pay that's right amen
[2:21:25] if we don't pay our our mortgage they
[2:21:27] will your house will be
[2:21:29] foreclosed and we cannot even uh do
[2:21:32] anything about it because the it's the
[2:21:35] law they will enforce because it's
[2:21:36] theirs from the beginning right so it's
[2:21:39] the same if if you cannot give your 10%
[2:21:43] then God will take it somehow in a
[2:21:46] different form so I'm just encouraging
[2:21:48] you it's it's a good way to uh to
[2:21:52] practice our faith amen and it's the law
[2:21:54] apply it brothers and sisters
[2:21:58] amen I don't know why I went there but
[2:22:00] uh I think uh that's good so you see
[2:22:04] here even Revelations
[2:22:06] 108-111 and he said unto me this is John
[2:22:09] he was asked to to take the open book
[2:22:11] we're feeding from an open book brothers
[2:22:13] and sisters amen because if it's still
[2:22:15] closed then who will open it right but
[2:22:18] yeah it's an open book it's not just
[2:22:21] revealed before but now it's revealed
[2:22:23] through the message of the hour amen and
[2:22:26] he said unto me thou must prophesy again
[2:22:28] before many peoples and Nations and
[2:22:30] tongues and Kings this is the bride
[2:22:32] ministry right now is to prophesy again
[2:22:36] amen amen so it's a we we must know who
[2:22:41] we are we are the bride so we must
[2:22:43] prophesy again prophesy again means we
[2:22:45] will make dead bones very dry bones live
[2:22:49] we can make all problem go away we can
[2:22:51] make sickness go away amen everything
[2:22:54] that is inanimate it's us speaking
[2:22:57] that's why we are being restored by the
[2:22:59] spoken word through the prophet of this
[2:23:02] hour amen
[2:23:05] amen
[2:23:06] now this is the last slide and then
[2:23:10] I'll I'll wrap up I'll call the
[2:23:16] musicians now he's called the
[2:23:18] church he has called the Church through
[2:23:21] what through
[2:23:23] justification called it through
[2:23:25] sanctification and then filled it with
[2:23:28] the Holy Ghost and Fire am and he took
[2:23:32] it what what did he take this it is the
[2:23:35] church through a process so you see it's
[2:23:38] always a process so don't don't worry if
[2:23:40] you're not yet perfect because you're in
[2:23:42] a process but once you're in a process
[2:23:44] you will mature you will grow Amen to
[2:23:47] the image and likeness of God Amen amen
[2:23:51] he took it through a process that he
[2:23:53] himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son
[2:23:57] of God could dwell in the human heart
[2:24:01] amen now it has it we're talking about
[2:24:05] the church Capital C here which is the
[2:24:07] bride the bride has to go through that
[2:24:10] before he can move into it hallelujah
[2:24:13] amen before he meaning the Holy Ghost
[2:24:15] himself can move into us so that's why
[2:24:18] our our life should be in order so that
[2:24:21] he can move into US am it's very
[2:24:24] important to put things in order even
[2:24:26] the Small Things brothers and sisters
[2:24:28] amen are very
[2:24:31] important right so you can see here we
[2:24:34] have some examples of the Bible God
[2:24:37] called Jacob but he's a deceiver that's
[2:24:42] right Rahab was a
[2:24:45] harlot but he but God called her David
[2:24:50] was an
[2:24:51] adulterer but he called
[2:24:54] him so you see mvin is a sinner but God
[2:24:59] called me amen it's the same you can put
[2:25:01] it in your name because we are all
[2:25:03] sinners but you can see here God did not
[2:25:07] call the qualified amen we were not
[2:25:10] qualified but he qualified the called
[2:25:13] amen because we are called according to
[2:25:15] his purpose and we have a purpose
[2:25:17] brothers and sisters we are so thankful
[2:25:19] that he had this uh in his mind his
[2:25:24] election before the foundation of the
[2:25:26] world we know we know we will be with
[2:25:30] him in eternity you can see the seventh
[2:25:33] and the eth is so important Romans 7 and
[2:25:35] Romans 8 because there's now therefore
[2:25:39] no condemnation Amen to them who are in
[2:25:43] Christ Jesus so you see we are all
[2:25:45] sinners don't worry that's already
[2:25:49] given right because that's the purpose
[2:25:52] of his coming to save us he didn't call
[2:25:54] for the righteous he didn't come for the
[2:25:57] righteous he came for us the Sinners and
[2:26:00] we're so thankful that we can submit
[2:26:02] ourselves to his word amen amen oh we
[2:26:05] are being restored brothers and sisters
[2:26:07] yes we are how by the spoken word amen
[2:26:12] through the prophet of this age brothers
[2:26:14] and sisters is
[2:26:16] important heed is call heed is me
[2:26:20] message he he his command amen it will
[2:26:23] not do you wrong it will better us off
[2:26:26] amen oh I hope your I didn't take much
[2:26:29] of your time I hope and uh I hope it's
[2:26:32] uh it encouraged you the original life
[2:26:35] sister if we can because this original
[2:26:38] life is so important even the verse of
[2:26:40] them by the spoken word amen

[2:26:49] this bride of last days we have brought

[2:29:53] life the original SE amen I just uh
[2:29:59] remembered something here because uh we
[2:30:01] are in Easter we have the
[2:30:04] resurrection at that day you shall know
[2:30:06] the Oneness of Christ in us I just
[2:30:09] thought uh I just put this as a as a
[2:30:12] little object
[2:30:13] illustration it was done before I think
[2:30:16] eight years ago by Brother David Nash
[2:30:18] but I will do it a little bit different
[2:30:21] so if you think God is in us how would
[2:30:25] we show it if you think God God is a
[2:30:28] fountain of spirit so he doesn't have a
[2:30:30] vessel so what he did is God poured
[2:30:34] himself into Christ right so think of
[2:30:37] this as the whole Fountain of spirit but
[2:30:40] you cannot you you need a container for
[2:30:43] for water so think of it that it will be
[2:30:45] poured into Christ and this is Christ
[2:30:49] and all the that Christ was he poured
[2:30:51] into his church individual so I'm one of
[2:30:54] them so I will take the spirit of him in
[2:30:59] me so where's God now where's the spirit
[2:31:02] of God now it's in me and it's in you he
[2:31:05] poured in the day of Pentecost to many
[2:31:09] 120 people and then it went it
[2:31:12] progressed until now we're in 2024 you
[2:31:16] can see the time is at hand amen we are
[2:31:20] here brothers and sisters and remember
[2:31:22] that Spirit the holy spirit of God is in
[2:31:25] you right now the bride coming of Christ
[2:31:28] am amen I hope everything is uh it's a
[2:31:31] blessing amen amen uh let's just bow in
[2:31:34] prayer and then I'll ask BR bar to come

[2:31:39] Lord for your word Lord that is living
[2:31:42] in US Lord we know we are in the process
[2:31:46] of being perfected of maturing oh Lord
[2:31:50] the only thing we can do as a start Lord
[2:31:53] is to die to ourselves Lord so that you
[2:31:55] can live in us oh God and we and when we
[2:31:59] surrender ourselves Lord we will be
[2:32:02] entitled to your token Lord token of

[2:32:08] Lord Jesus is important and it's living
[2:32:10] in us oh Lord Jesus you have to go Lord
[2:32:14] we know so that your Holy Spirit can
[2:32:16] dwell in us and as we are filled Lord
[2:32:19] fill our cups Lord every time oh Lord
[2:32:21] Jesus as we feed on your word you're
[2:32:23] feeling us every day daily oh Lord Jesus
[2:32:26] help us Lord that uh we we will continue
[2:32:30] Lord uh thinking of the Eternal rather
[2:32:32] than the the the physical oh Lord the
[2:32:36] natural the all this natural will pass
[2:32:39] away oh Lord but your word will never
[2:32:40] pass away oh Lord Jesus that uh oh Lord
[2:32:44] we are Eternal as Eternal we can be oh
[2:32:47] Lord because you you elected us
[2:32:50] destinated us before the foundation of
[2:32:51] the world oh Lord may may we be
[2:32:54] different people Lord when we come out
[2:32:57] of this uh Church oh Lord Jesus to to
[2:33:01] recharge us Lord for for the week for
[2:33:04] the week coming Lord we know we we have
[2:33:07] to work Lord so that we can earn
[2:33:09] something to feed our families oh Lord
[2:33:11] we know and and that's a curse that uh
[2:33:14] uh that's given Lord but uh we know Lord
[2:33:19] we have something that is uh uh of value
[2:33:22] the pearl of great price Lord the
[2:33:24] message of the hour which is the full
[2:33:26] word manifesting in US Lord we want to
[2:33:29] thank you Lord may you bless your people
[2:33:32] now
[2:33:33] Lord as we go our separate ways and I
[2:33:37] ask all these things in the mighty name
[2:33:39] of Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[2:33:48] amen
[2:33:54] [Music]
[2:33:59] me enjoy that
[2:34:08] today it's just nothing but the truth
[2:34:11] you know the
[2:34:13] spirit the prophet and the bride are all
[2:34:17] going to say the same thing amen he said
[2:34:20] it very clearly today and if they're
[2:34:21] saying something different there's
[2:34:23] something wrong either it's the wrong
[2:34:26] word coming to them or it's the wrong
[2:34:28] seat in them right but the beautiful
[2:34:30] thing is I love this I love this I love
[2:34:33] this alls we have to do our
[2:34:35] responsibility is just to reflect the
[2:34:37] word just to preach the word to speak
[2:34:39] the truth because that truth that word
[2:34:43] it will make every single seed come to
[2:34:45] life whether it wants to or not and it
[2:34:48] will bear fruit of the life that's
[2:34:51] inside of it whether it wants to or not
[2:34:54] and it's just the way it is it's just a
[2:34:56] beautiful thing and if we have the fruit
[2:34:59] of the spirit in our lives we've got
[2:35:01] every single reason to rejoice and my
[2:35:04] prayer for each and every one of us
[2:35:06] today moving forward is that we would be
[2:35:09] able to recognize the fruit of the
[2:35:11] spirit in our own lives Jesus Christ
[2:35:14] himself not some inanimate object not
[2:35:17] some dead bones that that have creeds
[2:35:19] and dogmas and traditions and ways but
[2:35:22] the literal life of Jesus Christ Living
[2:35:24] out through each and every one of us so
[2:35:27] many points that I got out of it I just
[2:35:29] think you know the word of God it comes
[2:35:31] through the prophets so well laid out
[2:35:35] sometimes I wish I could actually
[2:35:36] explain things the way I see it
[2:35:38] explained just a beautiful uh teaching
[2:35:40] today about that the word only comes the
[2:35:43] word of God only comes to the prophet
[2:35:46] only comes to the prophet and and that
[2:35:48] word that comes to the prophet is the
[2:35:50] same word that we believe and that word
[2:35:53] alone is what will change our bodies yes
[2:35:56] sir and we've said it before I'll keep
[2:35:58] saying it brothers and sisters the body
