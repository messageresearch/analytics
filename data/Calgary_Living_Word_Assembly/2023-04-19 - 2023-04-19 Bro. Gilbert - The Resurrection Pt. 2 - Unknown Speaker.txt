to stand before you I covet for your prayers let's turn to our bypass Colossians far Colossians 1 if you are there you can say Amen okay good past 24. who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the charge wherefore I have met a minister according to the dispensations of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hit from HS and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints scripture I'll read it again even the mystery which has been hit from HS and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory chapter 2 verse 9. for in him dwareth all the fullness of the godhead bodily let's also turn to Saint Luke chapter 17 verse 30. the scripture we know very well Saint Luke 17 30. even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed may God bless the reading of the what you can take your seats now this evening I want to change a little bit men have known me and they called me or they refer they refer to me as an evangelist but tonight I'm going to teach [Laughter] so I want to join my other colleagues what who teach and actually I have been teaching all along and what happens if you stay without if you live without with a teacher by osmosis you also become a teacher so now this evening I wonder how many of us knows that Saint Luke 17 30 and what it means don't raise your hand I don't want to how many of us knows exactly what that scripture means to us and I wonder how many are not sure they know exactly what that scripture means to us don't assume that you know it and I wonder how men are here and they have no idea even those ones who are on the internet they have no idea what that scripture means to us we always quote it oh Saint Luke 17 30 Saint Luke 17 30. but what is it so in continuation with what the pastor has been preaching and what we started what we were talking about during the the meetings um just going to take a little bit Step Ahead or further than where we left about the resurrection now two thousand years ago Jesus rose from the dead he had been a crucified and his body had been buried in the grave but on Sunday morning at the rising of the Sun that is s-u-n the quickening power came from Heaven rolled the stone away then United with the body and he resurrected the quickening power remember the scripture that the person read for us on Sunday Romans 8 11. if that Spirit dwareth In You then it will Quicken your mortal body now it is it was that quickening power that went into the grave rolled away the stone went into the grave United with the body and raised him up now what is that quickening power amen now the Easter seal was broken when he rose up what was the Easter serum nobody knew whether there was life after death why all the heroes of the Old Testament they had conquered everything you can talk of Moses how he conquered almost everything you can talk of Daniel you can talk of many of them but the thing that overcame them was death but now here comes Jesus Christ he dies and the quickening power comes and raises him up amen God help us now we are here to prove that we are beneficiaries of the Resurrection and we are here to prove that he's alive if you cannot prove that he is alive by your life then your experience has a question mark right sorry I didn't want to go that line I wanted to be a gentleman amen now May brother give me that the fastest light huh okay the body of Jesus Christ the prophet says a hundred percent Jesus Christ was human and a hundred percent he was God so now that's what we want to prove this evening so that the body that was born by Mary a hundred percent it was human being but now what made him God was when the scripture where we read in Colossians that the fullness of the Court had bodily dwelled in him when that fullness of the godhead came in him now it made him God so that the body was just like any other body he had their Temptations He had trials and everything in every way he was tempted but inside him that weakening power that God had that it dwelled in him that is what made the difference so now we can say the body plus the fullness of the godhead bodily makes him the son of man that is what made him the son of man the fullness of the godhead when it unites with the body hello just where we meet with me we'll get the direction we are going there we want to see how the ministry of the son of man is working today because when we say in Saint Luke 17 30 oh Saint Luke 17 30. even so thus when the son of man shall be revealed now we are living in the days of the ministry of the son of man so now how does that Ministry come about if I may go ahead of my someone that Ministry comes when the fullness of the godhead bodily comes and unites with the body then it deforms now the son of man may God help us so that if the stiffness of the Court head bodily is what we are calling now the quickening power outside that or without that quickening power or without that the court head bodily in the body of in your body or in my body you are just like in any other normal human being and there is no difference with the drunkards outside the only difference maybe you come to church the ministry of the son of man when the fullness of godhead bodily dwelled in him he was called the son of man now whether the body died and it was buried it was that fullness of the godhead bodily that went in the grave United with the body and make him now to rise up for the resurrection it is that fullness of the godhead bodily which we can call in another words the quickening power or the entire Holy Spirit in another quote the prophet says now in this day the entire Holy Spirit has come so which means in the seven Church ages they didn't have the entire Holy Spirit amen now Matthew 27 this one I I I I if I don't finish I will negotiate with the pastor so that I come and pursue this thought because we must know where we are Matthew 27 verse 50. Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the vein of the temple was reigned in Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quick and the Rocks reigned and the graves were opened and the many bodies of the Saints which slept a rose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now we say when he resurrected he was waived the other time we talked about being waved now when he was weaved as the son of man he died as the son of man let me try to refresh that one in The Cutting of kedesmani the fullness of the courthead bottle left him because you cannot kill God so when the fullness of the godhead left him he cried my father but now that the fullness of the godhead bodily left him for a while so that he couldn't so that he could fulfill the purpose he was sent for he was sent to die so that he can okay now when he rose up and he was waved many bodies of the Saints Resurrected but not everybody Resurrected those who are resurrected are only those who were buried in macapella where is macapella that is the place where Abraham bought for the burial place Sarah was buried in that place Abraham was buried in that place Isaac was buried in that place even Joseph when he was in Egypt he said when I die make sure you carry my bones and take them to philistine why the prophet says it is not written in the Bible you read between the lines why they had a revelation of where the resurrection will take place [Applause] so those who resurrected when Jesus Christ was waved to their to to them are only those who are buried in macapella and those who will resurrect from us are only those who are buried in Christ [Music] so you have to make sure you are buried in Christ any other place there is no Resurrection for you sorry for that for that so you have to make sure you are buried in Christ and the Paul tells us in Corinthians that by one Spirit we are baptized into one of these days we will talk about the mystical body there is the body the local body and there is the mystical body you can be in a local body but you are not in the mystical body so what is important is for you to find yourself in the mystical body that's the only thing that will help you my brother my sister to make sure you are in the mystical body and that's where Paul is saying by one spirit now if we are baptized into that body by one spirit can there be differences amongst us God help us oh my okay in the message it is the rising of the Sun it is not s-u-n anymore it is the s o n day the sun day s-o-n that that cone of wheat God's first one up from the dead is to be waved over the congregation that we are his seed and that is the first of the seed of those that slept weft upon the first day of the week on Sunday he raised up wept goodbye and and ascended up on high in the presence of the people okay so when he died let's try to say let's let's look at this one now when you take the fullness of godhead Botley inside that body we have the mayor and the female part okay let me allow that one to sink because I can see you are fighting with it in your in your minds in Genesis let's read it Genesis 1. this scripture was being quoted by the pastor the other day and nobody said amen so and I think I can now understand why you are doubting okay Genesis 1. 27 so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them there are two parts one part is the bridegroom and the other part is the bride hello please follow it up with me because if you miss this part then where we are going it will be very slippery for you [Laughter] I wonder of the Court head it had two parts the bright groom and the bride okay now The Pride was in him when Jesus Christ was here walking on two feet The Pride was in him we said last time that in the beginning it was through cesarean that the pride was extracted from Adam now Christ also had to undercoat the same Caesarean to get to release to release the pride so which means the pride was in him now if the pride was in him which means when he was being crucified the gripe the bride was in him you were in him now if you are in him then when he resurrected you are also in him okay let me go ahead of my salmon now when you when Jesus Christ was walking The Pride was in him now the prophet says the pride coming of Christ now if we have the pride today then that is where the mystery is huh so if we have the pride today then where is the project room The Pride groom is now in the pride but when you see you see the pride but inside the bride there is the bridegroom if we cannot see that then our believing of the message is nothing because we are going to see now how the bridegroom comes in you we are saying the fullness of the Court heck boatly it had two parts when that fullness which we are calling the quickening power or the entire spirit came in the body when it United with the body it made him the son of man are we together so far can you say that you can now see yourself being inside the bright groom and the pride in you because if you cannot reconcile that equation okay the mathematicians maybe they are here they will challenge me if you cannot reconcile that equation that I and my father are one in that day he shall know that I am in the father the father in me and you him that reconciliation if you cannot reconcile that that that that that statement then we are just doing at the service being here because we need now to know who we are how shall We Know Who We Are when if the scripture says in that day which day which day this day so you can stand and say this day this scripture is fulfilled how is it fulfilled you can say it is now fulfilled in me you now personalize it and those are the people those are the only people who have been there in the resurrection because why there is there is erection we say it there is a letter in words when the fullness of the Court head bodily came to unite with the body it raised him up now partly we can say that is that fullness of the godhead for body was waived when it was waved over the denominations you came out of the crebes of the denominations then what next is to come to a point where you can say this day this scripture is fulfilled in me we have to come to a point where you now personalize it you have to come to a point where saying we no it is not we you even don't know whether the person seated next to you is is is part of that body so it is time to say it is me it is a personal revelation this thing has been personally revealed to you and you hold it between life and death take away anything from me but give me Jesus oh if I correct that I will not reach to where I wanted to amen okay okay now Jesus was the first to resurrect and never to die again unlike Lazarus Lazarus died and he died again and that's why if you can allow me I'll repeat this statement please don't go for the gifts call for The Giver of the gifts you can have a gift of healing you can be prayed for you get healed and tomorrow you come here you come again here for prayers right but if you get The Giver of the gifts whether this body is drowned in the ocean it doesn't matter what matters is that weakening power if you have that quickening power wherever you will be you will be Resurrected may God help us okay hey amen okay now Jesus who died was called the son of man there is nowhere he referred to himself as the son of God he always referred to himself as the son of man Now who is the son of man it is the fullness of the godhead bodily United with the flesh I want us to get that one when the fullness of godhead bodily unites with your flesh then who do you become okay on the day of Pentecost he was not waved as the son of man let me read the quotes now okay the Mighty God unveiled before us Prophet says then we find after his death burial and Resurrection he came on the day of Pentecost as Son of God the spirit in the form Holocaust what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form like the Holy Spirit which is God he came to deal through the church edges as the son of God on the day of Pentecost he came down okay now let me explain that one he died as the son of man he rose as the son of man why he had the fullness of the godhead bodily in him he walked here for 40 days then he was resurrected he he he was raptured after he was ruptured then he came on the day of Pentecost now when he came back on the day of Pentecost he did not come with the whole fullness of the godhead portly the feminist Spirit left him come down now as the bride now when the feminist Spirit they came from him now he changed the form from the son of man to Son of God now he dwelled in the seven Church ages as the Son of God until in the lautition church age when they rejected him now after they rejected him they rejected who the son of God so after they rejected him as the Son of God now he had to change the form again why okay I have so many quotes but I don't have time to read everything on the day of Pentecost he came as the Son of God he did not come as the son of man why because he saw this day that you are living in what happened so he came now on Mount Sunset as the fullness of the godhead bodily why he came as the head and where was the body the body was here so now when that fullness of God God had bodily came on Mount the sunset for what so that the head now can Unite with the body now when the head unite when the head unites with the body what we say we now say the son of man so now he changed from the Son of God to Son of Man here as the son of man why the fullness of the coat head bodily came down on Mount sunset it did not remain on Mount sunset you don't have to go to mount Sunset to receive it he's here as the head for what purpose so that he can now Unite with the body and when he unites with the body now he changes the form to the son of man now we are in the ministry of the son of man that is not the mystery I have not even reached the minister Mister because the scripture we read it was talking about the mystery so I've not even come to the mystery I was just laying the foundation I'm a poor teacher I take so long to come to my point but at least now you can see where we are he's here in the ministry of the son of man why now you can see Luke 17 30 has now been fulfilled oh my now you can say I am the Fulfillment of Saint Luke 17 30. why you can now see yourself in the Fulfillment of Saint Luke 17 30. okay amen okay okay so far so good you can SN you can now see yourself now in that Ministry when he was waived after the resurrection he resurrected the Old Testament Saints now what happens if he is waved again today what will happen he will resurrect the New Testament Saints so now do you see the work that you have somebody somewhere is waiting on you somebody in the grave is waiting on you but we become so touchy we don't want to release ourselves so that he can use us we don't want to allow him to have preeminence okay that one now brings us to where I wanted to he came as the fullness of godhead bodily the head Revelation 10 1. when they rejected him as the Son of God now he came in Revelation 10 1 as the head as the Archangel the mighty angel for what purpose because the body is here so he came as the head now to unite with the body can we allow him to unite with us it is uniting time and sign but the good thing is it is an invisible Union you may not see somebody shouting crying or doing what but inside that person there is a change that is going on there is a change that is going on God help us okay oh my oh just skip so that uh okay in the message unveiling of God for for his ACT he changes his form then he came the form of a son of man for the reformers age Wesley Luda and down through them we find out that they got it so bundled up just like the Israelites did till when he does appear in the last days in the Pentecostal age as the Holy Spirit they rejected it they did the same thing as Israel did okay now can you give me the the other slide to the last one now because I want us to come to okay now in seven Church edges we have established that he was in the office of the son of God until the age of laautitia when they rejected him now he went outside to the church but he's no King for the last one that is still out there if he can hit to their voice that is calling thank you brother hope you sung for us that Jesus is Calling he's pleading with you yeah you are in the church but you are not sure you have United with him you are not sure but this quickening power can work in you you have a chance you have a chance that the body is still on the massive City For What in the sitting for you when you do something that is wrong that is worthy a punishment the fullness of the godhead reportedly the father he looks at he looks at the body on The Mercy Seat and that's what happened the the quickening power or the fullness of the godhead bodily left the body on the massive seat and he sneaked out I'm going to explain because that is now the mystery that we read in the book of Colossians and that is where we have in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed it is a sacred it is a mystery but this mystery has now been made known only to the bride let me explain that one you can be in the house we have visitors we have children and we have the father there he looks at the wife and the wife understands what he wants and she starts acting there was no communication [Laughter] but she understood what he meant it is only the pride who understands what the pride groom wants why when he up when the seven seal was opened there was silence in heaven but in the course of that silence the pride can understand what is the pride groom wants you can interpret what is the bridegroom wants so the practicum is communicating with the bride God help us okay now in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph one or five the prophet says now God had a purpose in the hidden Mystery remember in the book of Colossians we said the mystery is the Christ the hope of glory Christ the hope of glory in you that was the great mystery now here the prophet saying God in his mind the back part of his mind he had a purpose that was divided into three mysteries so that mystery but out of these three mysteries let's now try to expound on those Mysteries so that now we see where we are the first one the prophet says God wanted to reveal himself now how was he going to reveal himself the fullness of the Court head bodily comes in the body and the two unite now Jesus Christ was walking here representing God so he unveiled himself he revealed himself that was the first grateful purpose that God wanted to fulfill then the second grateful purpose that he wanted to have preeminence in the body of believers now how is he going to achieve that for him to achieve that the quickening power or the fullness of the godhead bodily now comes down as we have said it came down on Mount sunset for what we have preeminence in the body of believers can anyone can any one of us say that God has preeminence in me can you come to a point where you can say it is not I who liveth God help us that second fault purpose it's what is delaying the rapture we have never allowed him to have preeminence and he must achieve that God cannot fail he has to achieve that whether you fail or I fail somebody will fulfill it somebody will meet that requirement may God help me to be that one person may God help me to be that one person where God can have free eminence where I can say it is not I I cannot use my internet my anything no on everything I look at what the word says why because the word has preeminence in me may God help us so is the problem is this guy and that's why the prophet says the greatest enemy was pranham always standing between him and the god this flesh if we can die I I I wish I was able to sing that song he died to make men holy let us die to make men free if you can die you will save people free but in many times we are standing in the way God have mercy on us God have mercy on me I need to die I just need to die if I can die people will see Christ in me God help us so now from Seven Church ages he changed now to the ministry of the son of man and now we come to the bright age now we are in the bright age in the bright age he is operating in the office of the son of man now if he's operating in the office of the son of man what is remaining is to go to the Millennium where he will now change to the office of the son of David now in the son of man the bride was inside him in the sun in the seven Church ages the Holy Spirit he operated in the office of the Holy Spirit where he was dwelling in the hearts of men now in the Millennium it will be now the wife or the Queen Under The King both of them Seated on the throne the prophet says do we see how close we are how many beliefs were in the bright age still has a problem with us we are still looking back but the ministry has changed he has changed the form he has changed the office he is now operating in a different office let us move on let us move on let us recognize who we are now who are we the fullness of the godhead Pottery has come down to unite with the body for what purpose so that he can now fulfill the second faulty purpose that he had in the back part of his mind we are privileged people that we can go in the back part of the mind of God and see what he had before the foundation of the world may God help us may God have mercy on us it is later than we think so if there is anything you can do just lay aside every weight of sin any unbelief let us move on let us allow him to have preeminence because that second fold purpose until it is fulfilled we are going nowhere that may not be a hindrance if it means to die let me die so that Christ can be seen in me that is all that he's waiting for yes we can do all other things but until we allow him to have preeminence how so that in every situation it is him first can we can it happen do we see where the problem is that second for the purpose if we can allow it to be fulfilled but the prophet says it is later than we think do we see how late we are how late it is then if it is so late what we need to do let us surrender so that he can have preeminence let this word richly dwell in you allow him let's allow him oh my goodness God help us amen the prophet says in the same message he continues to say pipo has been in type and expressing what God's Great call is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and the Court's help we will see it right here this morning what the Lord had in his mind all along is to be fulfilled today so can we say this day this scripture is fulfilled in me I don't know about my neighbor I don't know it is now me if there will be one let me be that one let me just be that one may God help us it is later than we think it's time to shake ourselves tinge ourselves and see how we are standing God help us I'll stop there if I continue like that I will have no many friends in our meetings so for the sake of having more friends I will stop there blessing in the resurrection morning we shall rise how many are sure they will write our rights only if that fullness of godhead bodily you have allowed that fullness let us stand musicians you can come in the resurrection morning we shall rise faster you can come in the resurrection morning when the Trump of culture sound we shall rise Hallelujah been the Saints we come rejoicing on our notice we ever be found we shall rise Hallelujah [Music] foreign I don't know that song but I can learn it but probably not tonight did you enjoy that tonight some of the words that were spoken we could say that was pretty hard words from Brother Gilbert or we could say those were beautiful words from God and if we say those are words from Brother Gilbert then I do believe we need to check that quickening power but if we can say those words were from God maybe to shake us I feel I want to shake have a little bit of a inward look I just couldn't help but think about one scripture as brother Gilbert was preaching tonight you know it's interesting some of the timelines that he was speaking about how you know there was a change from the Son of God Ministry to the son of man Ministry and that time changed in our generation when he preached the indictment when brother Branham preached the indictment for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ that was a very significant change but it was only because they rejected the opening of the word which is what happened on Mount Sunset it wasn't a supernatural experience that we just have a picture of and and we call it something that's just just memorabilia about the message of the hour no no no that was the opening of the word that's what that was but you know out of Ephesians I just can't help but think about being positionally placed in our promised land in Christ Jesus in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 16 it says that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend he wants us to comprehend this he wants us to get this this isn't something that's mysterious and out there those people that have that quickening power able to say Amen we understand what happened on Sunset Mountain Verse 18 says may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge to be able to go beyond all that we think we know by faith being rooted and grounded in love in Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God that you might be filled with all the fullness of God it's not something mysterious brother Gilbert was talking about tonight that the Lord was bringing to us brothers and sisters this is scripture we can say it this day this scripture is fulfilled in me I might not feel like it I might not look like it but his word says it and I say Amen to that that's the only thing that needs to happen Satan wants to say no you don't you you don't look like it no you you don't feel like it I know when I came to church before I came to church there was a dark cloud that tried to settle down on me I was talking to my wife about that I was talking to another brother about that and you know what wasn't just me but it's for a reason Satan doesn't want us to get this Revelation because when we get this Revelation we're going up and when we go up he's cast down he knows his time is short brothers and sisters when we go forwards maybe the words were hard tonight to think that maybe we need to do something the only thing we need to do is look away to Jesus don't look at our faults and failures don't worry about all of the things in this life that we worry about worry about being right with the Lord worry about having that quickening power worry about having the token and when the Devil comes to try and tell us that we failed and there's no hope just remember God doesn't look at you he doesn't look at me God only looks at the sacrifice that's the only thing he sees as long as Jesus is interceding for us the only thing he sees is what Jesus did Satan wants us to think it's what we've done we couldn't do it we can't die for our sins he already paid them all of them anyways tonight I just feel inspired certainly thankful for that I feel shaken up I want to die out to myself more I want more of Christ in me so that we can potentially find that last predestinated seed let's just bow a prayer tonight gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for speaking to us Lord thank you for coming by here Lord for using our brother Lord to just shake us up a little bit Lord to help us to not be comfortable not to be in a laodiceem condition Lord Jesus we know that time is short we know that it's later than we thank Father and we know that you have given us all that we need you've equipped us with every single thing that we need to make it out of here father to be victorious Lord that if we go in the grave it's not going to stop that quickening power because nothing can stop that quickening power that quickening power is your very life Lord whether we go by the way of the sky or the by the way of the Grave nothing will stop that quickening power we thank you for your word tonight Lord thank you for for speaking to us for encouraging us Lord just ask that you would keep your hand upon each one of us now as we go our separate ways Lord watch over the families father be with those who are traveling Lord we pray that you would just give them traveling mercies and bring them home safely at the appointed time and Lord if it be a will for us to gather again on Sunday Lord Jesus we'll prepare ourselves Lord we'll die out to ourselves father we'll consecrate ourselves Lord that when we gather together once again we won't hear from a man Lord Jesus we'll come ready to hear from you Lord and we'll be careful to give you all the praise and all the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we sing that song the word is working mightily in me it's got to be brothers and sisters if it's not there's a problem like we heard tonight the word is working mightily in me [Music] no matter what the circumstance of what I feel [Music] alone [Applause] [Music] good morning [Music] [Applause] [Music] circumstances [Music] [Music] can we sing When the Saints Go Marching In as we go marching home one of these mornings brothers and sisters it's going to change

[Music] hearts age [Music] [Music] [Music] Mommy [Music] [Applause] [Music] no [Music] no no no when nothing [Music] and again [Music] [Music] thank you very much again [Music] [Applause] [Music] um
