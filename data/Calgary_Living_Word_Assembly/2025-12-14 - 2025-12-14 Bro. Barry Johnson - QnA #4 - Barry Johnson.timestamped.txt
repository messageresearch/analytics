[29:03] Thank you, Lord, for your invitation.
[29:04] [music]
[29:05] Thank you, Lord. [applause]
[29:10] We've been called up a little higher.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; I was reading Revelation, I think it's
[29:14] chapter 20 this morning. My goodness,
[29:16] the bride has made herself ready. Here
[29:18] we are following the word, just obeying
[29:20] the word as we heard from brother Don. I
[29:22] think brother Barry as well talking
[29:23] about just being being the word, being
[29:25] in church, just feeding and that soul
[29:27] knows exactly what to do with the word.
[29:29] We're thankful for that. Growing up to
[29:31] that place, we'll be caught up a little
[29:33] higher any moment.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; That rapture is upon us. And and you
[29:36] know, as we say these things and sing
[29:38] these things, it's so hard to explain it
[29:40] from our words. But Lord, would you
[29:42] listen to our hearts this morning? Just
[29:44] sing the song with me. How do you
[29:45] explain his love? How do you explain it?
[29:47] It's possible. But Lord, would you just
[29:49] listen to my heart? How much I love you
[29:51] from my heart? Oh, how do you explain?
[29:58] Oh, how do you describe?
[30:03] A love that [music and singing] flows
[30:04] from east to west,
[30:08] runs as deep as [singing] it is wide.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] you know all our
[30:18] Lord. You [singing] know all [music] our
[30:20] fears
[30:23] and words cannot express the love we
[30:27] feel. But we long for you to hear.
[30:30] [music]
[30:31] Oh, [singing]
[30:34] listen to our heart.
[30:38] [music]
[30:39] Hear our spirit sing.
[30:43] A song [music] of praise and glory.
[30:49] [music and singing]
[30:53] Oh, we will use the words we know to
[30:57] tell you what
[31:00] [music]
[31:01] God [singing]
[31:03] words are
[31:05] to tell you. [music]
[31:08] So listen to our hearts.
[31:12] Oh, if words could fall, I pray
[31:18] from these lips of mine. [music]
[31:23] I had a thousand years. Oh Lord, I would
[31:27] still run out [music] of time.
[31:31] But if you listen to our heart
[31:35] [music]
[31:37] every single
[31:41] [music]
[31:42] [singing]
[31:52] [music]
[31:53] [singing]
[32:01] Praise [music and singing]
[32:05] those who have
[32:10] [singing]
[32:11] words to [music] know to tell you what
[32:16] awesome [music] God you are. But words
[32:20] are not enough to [music] tell you
[32:22] [singing] of our love. So listen to us.
[32:27] Oh, if words could fall I [music] gra
[32:33] from these lips of mine.
[32:37] If I had [music] a thousand years long,
[32:42] I would still run out of time.
[32:46] Oh, if you listen to us, [music]
[32:52] every
[32:55] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[32:56] [music]
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you for
[32:58] Thank you for the truth. Thank [music]
[33:01] you for the [singing] way
[33:04] he comes. Oh, listen to [music] our
[33:06] hearts.
[33:10] Hear our spirit singing [music]
[33:19] from those you [music] have.
[33:24] We will use [singing] the words we know
[33:27] to tell you what [music] awesome God you
[33:32] are. But words [singing] are not enough
[33:36] to tell you of our love. [music] So
[33:38] listen to our words are not enough to
[33:43] tell you of our love. So listen [music]
[33:47] to our heart.
[33:54] Amen. Let's one more time bow our heads
[33:57] and hearts unto our Lord and Savior
[33:59] Jesus.
[34:05] Father, we're so thankful that thou
[34:07] knowest our heart, Lord.
[34:09] As the song says, Father Lord, our words
[34:12] fail us, Father Lord, but we're so
[34:15] thankful that thou knowest the desire of
[34:16] our heart, Father Lord.
[34:19] Our desire, Lord, is to always every
[34:23] opportunity, Father, to just slip into
[34:25] that secret place with you, to tell you
[34:28] how much we love you, Father.
[34:32] Father, we find in that secret place,
[34:33] Lord, where we can make love one to
[34:36] another, Father, we're giving you our
[34:38] prayers and supplications and telling
[34:40] you how needy and weak we are. Father,
[34:44] you take the opportunity to one more
[34:45] time to fill us aresh with thy spirit,
[34:47] thy goodness, and thy holiness.
[34:51] Father, we stand here today, Father, so
[34:53] thankful for
[34:56] the forgiveness of our past and to be
[34:58] able to stand justified.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; And Father, to be able to look forward
[35:03] by predestination and see our future is
[35:05] so bright.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; So bright.
[35:09] So, Father, we desire
[35:12] more of your spirit, Father, to be able
[35:13] to walk more in your word, Father. For
[35:16] your word is what leads us to that
[35:17] bright future. Father,
[35:20] receive our worship, receive our praise,
[35:22] [music] Father. Lord, we lift our cups
[35:24] up, Father, to be filled, aresh. Father,
[35:26] you told us if we hungered and thirst
[35:28] that we would be filled and satisfied.
[35:30] That is what led us here today, Father.
[35:33] The desire of our soul, Lord, to just
[35:36] Such a sweet atmosphere, Father. Such a
[35:39] sweet presence. That's you, Father.
[35:41] That's you. We recognize you, Lord. We
[35:44] greet you with a holy kiss. We open
[35:46] ourselves up fully to you, Father. We
[35:47] surrender all. Give us that which we
[35:50] have need of, and that's more of you.
[35:52] Father, we be sure to give you all the
[35:54] honor and praise, Lord. We lay our
[35:56] tithes and offerings, Lord, at your
[35:58] feet. We give it freely and willingly in
[36:01] reverence and respect to your word and
[36:03] to the gift that you've given us.
[36:04] Receive it, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name
[36:06] we pray. Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:14] And oh yes.
[36:16] Oh yes. I'm a child
[36:21] of the king.
[36:24] His [singing] royal

[42:16] [singing]
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning.
[42:21] Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, we're certainly
[42:24] thankful to be able to gather together
[42:27] in the name above every name. If you
[42:30] have a need this morning, maybe make it
[42:31] known unto him
[42:34] as we go to him in prayer. Gracious
[42:37] heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for
[42:39] this day and we thank you for another
[42:40] opportunity, Lord, that we can bring our
[42:43] licks of fire together, Lord.
[42:46] Lord Jesus, one more time manifest your
[42:49] pillar of fire [music] here as a body in
[42:52] one mind and one accord in unity.
[42:56] Father, we thank you that we can sing
[42:58] the songs of praise, the songs of Zion,
[43:01] Lord, that we can bring a sacrifice of
[43:04] praise unto you, Lord Jesus. And Father,
[43:07] we just ask this [music] morning that
[43:09] you would receive it. Father, we pray
[43:11] that you would just pour yourself out to
[43:13] us and through us this morning [music]
[43:15] in this service. Lord, we pray that we
[43:17] could push back all of the humanity,
[43:19] Father, all of the circumstances and
[43:22] situations and just give you the full
[43:25] preeminence that you desire in this
[43:27] service. We know that you had your mind
[43:29] on this service before the foundation of
[43:31] the world. And Father, we're excited to
[43:35] hear what you have to say.
[43:37] Lord Jesus, we pray that we could just
[43:39] get ourselves out of the way and give
[43:41] you, Father, all that you desire today
[43:43] from ourselves. Free will, Lord Jesus.
[43:47] Father, we pray that you would meet the
[43:49] needs that are expressed to you today by
[43:52] the way of an uplift hand, Father. Maybe
[43:54] not even by an uplift hand, just in our
[43:56] hearts.
[43:58] Father, we pray that you would just meet
[43:59] those needs. We pray for the unspoken
[44:02] requests, Lord, that you would meet them
[44:03] also. And father, we'll be careful to
[44:06] give you the praise.
[44:08] Lord, now as we turn to your word, we
[44:10] pray that you would just be glorified in
[44:12] all that's said and done.
[44:14] Just ask all these things in Jesus
[44:16] Christ's name we pray.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians
[44:22] one more time for giving of your gifts.
[44:27] Just want to turn over to the book of
[44:29] Genesis
[44:31] chapter 48
[44:34] this morning.
[44:38] Genesis chapter 48.
[44:43] Certainly want to welcome our friends
[44:45] from Sri Lanka. Trust you feel right at
[44:48] home.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 48.
[45:00] Start reading with verse 8
[45:05] of Genesis chapter 48.
[45:11] And Israel beheld Joseph's sons
[45:14] and said, "Who are these?"
[45:18] And Joseph said unto his father, "They
[45:21] are my sons whom God hath given me in
[45:25] this place."
[45:27] And he said, "Bring them, I pray thee,
[45:29] unto me, and I will bless them."
[45:33] Now the eyes of Israel
[45:36] were dim for age, so that he could not
[45:39] see.
[45:41] And he brought them near unto him, and
[45:42] he kissed them, and embraced them.
[45:47] And Israel said unto Joseph,
[45:50] I had not thought to see thy face.
[45:53] And lo, God hath showed me also thy
[45:58] seed.
[46:00] And Joseph brought them out from between
[46:02] his knees, and he bowed himself with his
[46:06] face to the earth.
[46:09] And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in
[46:12] his right hand toward Israel's left
[46:15] hand, and Manasseh in his left hand
[46:20] toward Israel's right hand, and brought
[46:23] them near unto him.
[46:27] And Israel stretched out his right hand,
[46:30] and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was
[46:33] the younger, and his left hand upon
[46:36] Manass's head. guiding his hands
[46:40] wittingly, for Manasseh was the
[46:43] firstborn.
[46:45] And he blessed Joseph and said, "God,
[46:48] before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac
[46:52] did walk, the God which fed me all my
[46:56] lifelong until this day.
[47:00] The angel which redeemed me from all
[47:04] evil.
[47:05] Bless the lads, and let my name be named
[47:09] on them, and the name of my fathers
[47:13] Abraham and Isaac, and let them grow
[47:16] into a multitude in the midst of the
[47:19] earth.
[47:21] And when Joseph saw his father laid his
[47:25] right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it
[47:28] displeased him. And he held up his
[47:31] father's hand to remove it from
[47:33] Ephraim's head unto Manass's head. And
[47:37] Joseph said unto his father, "Not so, my
[47:41] father, for this is the firstborn. Put
[47:45] thy right hand upon his head."
[47:48] And his father refused
[47:51] and said, "I know it, my son. I know
[47:54] it." See, he had already gone through a
[47:59] father giving the blessing. Not
[48:02] according to what we see, not according
[48:04] to what we think,
[48:07] &gt;&gt; but according to revelation.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; His father refused and said, "I know it,
[48:13] my son. I know it. He also shall become
[48:17] a people, and he also shall be great.
[48:21] But truly his younger brother shall be
[48:24] greater than he.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And his seed shall become a multitude of
[48:29] nations.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And he blessed them that day, saying, In
[48:34] thee shall Israel bless, saying, God
[48:39] make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.
[48:43] And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
[48:47] And Israel said unto Joseph, "Behold, I
[48:50] die, but God shall be with you and bring
[48:53] you again unto the land of your fathers.
[49:00] Moreover,
[49:02] I have given to thee one portion above
[49:06] thy brethren, which I took out of the
[49:09] hand of the Amorite
[49:11] with my sword and with my bow. Let's
[49:15] just bow one more time.
[49:20] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[49:22] your scripture. We thank you Lord Jesus
[49:26] for the word of prophecy
[49:28] because heavens and earth will pass
[49:30] away.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, thus saith the Lord will
[49:34] never fail.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And we thank you Lord Jesus that this
[49:38] word has just as much force, just as
[49:42] much power, just as much meaning today
[49:45] as the day that it was spoken. Father,
[49:48] we just commit the words that are spoken
[49:49] this morning into your hands now for
[49:51] your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we
[49:54] pray. Amen.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be
[49:57] seated.
[50:03] This morning I have another question I
[50:05] would like to get into. And uh I trust
[50:08] everyone is all right. Today I've come
[50:11] out of a little bit of a cold snap and
[50:12] got some warm weather. It's kind of
[50:14] nice.
[50:16] Today we have another question that I
[50:18] just thought was so good. And you know,
[50:20] many times we can look at these
[50:21] questions and think they're just they're
[50:23] so simple and obvious, but you know,
[50:27] sometimes we just don't understand them
[50:29] and that's why they're written down. And
[50:31] and other times, I think maybe someone
[50:34] might want the pastor to preach on this.
[50:36] So they might write down a question like
[50:38] this in such a way that it would
[50:41] potentially cause a little bit of
[50:42] preaching. And you know, either way, I'm
[50:44] happy to do it because there's really no
[50:46] question that I'm afraid of. If there's
[50:48] a spiritual question, there has to be a
[50:50] spiritual answer. And uh this one here
[50:53] is uh it's actually three questions in
[50:56] one.
[50:58] And the first one says, "Why are the
[51:00] eyes of Israel closed?"
[51:04] Why are the eyes of Israel closed? The
[51:07] next one, number two, and and it's I
[51:10] think written as one question with three
[51:13] points to it. The next one is, why are
[51:16] Jews still following Old Testament even
[51:20] though Jesus in brackets, the New
[51:23] Testament,
[51:24] was with them physically?
[51:27] Why are Jews still following the Old
[51:30] Testament even though Jesus, the New
[51:33] Testament, was with them physically?
[51:37] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[51:37] &gt;&gt; The third one is, why are they still
[51:41] waiting for Moses and Elijah?
[51:44] Now, I hope we'll get into that third
[51:46] one today, but I can't promise. We'll
[51:48] see what the Lord has in store. But I I
[51:51] think it's wonderful because it just
[51:53] gives us an opportunity to take a look
[51:55] where there's a scriptural question,
[51:56] there has to be a scriptural answer. And
[51:59] uh you know, we can take it for granted.
[52:01] Why are the eyes of children uh blinded?
[52:03] Why are they closed? I mean, they can
[52:06] all see, but I think it goes back to our
[52:09] lesson that we were talking about in
[52:10] Grand Prairie that we preached on
[52:12] Wednesday, you know, a little bit about
[52:14] the story of Elijah and Elisha and maybe
[52:18] the Syrians and Ghazi and the servant
[52:21] and and how, you know, God can open eyes
[52:24] and he can close eyes. And the eyes that
[52:26] are being opened and closed aren't
[52:28] necessarily the eyes that we're looking
[52:31] at this morning that we're blinking
[52:33] through. It's the spiritual eyes that
[52:35] we're talking about. Why are the eyes of
[52:38] Israel closed? There's definitely
[52:41] scripture that we're going to get into
[52:42] about that, but uh I can tell you that
[52:45] it goes back this far in the Bible. This
[52:48] is exactly why the eyes of Israel are
[52:51] closed because the elder shall serve the
[52:54] younger. That is what the prophecy was
[52:57] and still is today. It hasn't changed. I
[53:02] think it's it's interesting when we look
[53:04] at this scripture out of Genesis and you
[53:07] know specifically out of Genesis um
[53:11] 48:14
[53:13] and Israel stretched out his right hand
[53:15] and laid it upon Ephraim's head who was
[53:18] the younger and his left hand upon
[53:21] Manasseh's head guiding his hands
[53:25] wittingly
[53:27] for Manasseh was the firstborn. it was
[53:29] supposed to be the other way around
[53:31] [clears throat] according to the the way
[53:33] the scriptures were in that day, the the
[53:35] customs of the age. That was the way it
[53:38] was supposed to be. But this word
[53:39] wittingly, he did it. He he was guiding
[53:42] his hands wittingly. This is a Hebrew
[53:45] word 79:19
[53:47] out of the out of the concordance is
[53:50] wittingly. It's pronounced secal. Sakal
[53:54] and to be causitively make or act
[53:59] circumspect
[54:00] and hence intelligent.
[54:03] I think it's interesting because it's
[54:05] not just accidentally that he crossed
[54:07] his hands. He wittingly crossed his
[54:10] hands. He wittingly did this for the
[54:13] purpose that we could be here today. And
[54:16] uh we're just going to weave that in
[54:18] through the whole sermon. Um but it's
[54:20] intelligent. It's it's an intelligence
[54:22] behind it to consider. Expert, instruct,
[54:26] prosper, deal, prudent, prudently, give,
[54:29] skill, skillful, have good success,
[54:33] teach,
[54:35] have, make, to, understanding, wisdom,
[54:39] behave, self, consider, make, wise,
[54:42] wisely, guiding, wittingly.
[54:46] It was not accidental and it wasn't
[54:49] necessarily just because he desired to
[54:51] do it. It's because God crossed his
[54:54] hands.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; And we know that's where this goes. It's
[54:58] exactly where he goes. Let's turn over
[54:59] to Romans chapter 11 this morning
[55:03] as we get into this. Romans chap 11.
[55:12] Romans chap 11. Why are the eyes of
[55:16] Israel closed?
[55:19] I think it's just wonderful when we have
[55:21] these questions. It [snorts] tells us
[55:23] what's in the heart of the people and it
[55:27] gives us an opportunity to address them.
[55:30] Why are the eyes of Israel closed?
[55:32] Romans 11 verse one.
[55:36] We know this is Paul speaking to the
[55:38] Romans, the first church age messenger
[55:41] from the Ephesian church age. I say
[55:44] then, hath God cast away his people? God
[55:49] forbid?
[55:50] For I also am an Israelite of the seed
[55:53] of Abraham of the tribe of tribe of
[55:56] Benjamin.
[55:57] God hath not cast away his people which
[56:01] he forneew.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; What she not? What the scripture saith
[56:07] [snorts] of Elias,
[56:09] how he maketh intercession to God
[56:11] against Israel, saying, Lord, they have
[56:15] killed thy prophets, and dig down thine
[56:17] altars, and I am left alone, and they
[56:22] seek my life.
[56:25] But what saith the answer of God unto
[56:28] him?
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have reserved to myself 7,000
[56:33] men who have not bowed the knee to the
[56:37] image of Baal.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Even so then at this present time also
[56:45] there is a remnant according to the
[56:47] election of grace.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Now I didn't even get into the church
[56:53] age book with this. I might have to come
[56:55] back to it and talk about it from the
[56:57] church age book perspective because
[56:59] there's so much in there about election.
[57:02] The Jewish people, the Jews are our
[57:06] brothers and our sisters.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; They are elected.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; They are not castaways.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; There is a strong teaching in the world
[57:16] today that says they're the ones that
[57:18] hung Jesus on the cross. So, they're
[57:21] murderers.
[57:23] Why are the Jews blinded?
[57:26] We're going to keep asking that
[57:27] question. We're going to make sure that
[57:28] we get this loud and clear today. It's
[57:31] such a beautiful thing to think about.
[57:34] Even so, then at this present time also,
[57:39] there is a remnant according to the
[57:41] election of grace.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Not the election of the Old Testament
[57:47] law.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Election of grace. mind.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; And if by grace then it is no more of
[57:56] works.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Remember works is faith expressed.
[58:03] Otherwise grace is no more grace. But if
[58:06] it be of works then it is no more grace.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Otherwise work is no more work.
[58:13] What then? Israel hath not obtained that
[58:17] which he seeketh for,
[58:20] but the election hath obtained it.
[58:25] And the rest were blinded.
[58:29] You know, in our age, not very long
[58:31] away, not very long time from today, we
[58:35] can see the handwriting on the wall. If
[58:36] you talk to the old-timers in and around
[58:38] this word and the things that have
[58:41] happened, the changes that have come
[58:42] along, we are definitely living right
[58:45] between the days of Noah where it was
[58:47] evil continually in the hearts of man.
[58:50] Continually evil thoughts all about
[58:52] themselves and the imagery and and all
[58:55] of the content that we can post of
[58:57] ourselves online to try and make
[58:59] ourselves appear a certain way. um all
[59:02] of that nonsense,
[59:05] all of that evil in the heart of man
[59:07] continually and then the Sodom condition
[59:10] over here. No other age has lived in
[59:13] between those two conditions but this
[59:16] age and it was prophesied that this
[59:19] people would be in that condition.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; But isn't it wonderful to think that
[59:23] there is a remnant of grace and that
[59:26] grace is only through election.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:31] Verse 8 says, "According as it is
[59:33] written, God hath given them the spirit
[59:36] of slumber,
[59:38] eyes that they should not see, and ears
[59:41] that they should not hear unto this
[59:44] day."
[59:47] The children of Israel have been given
[59:49] this.
[59:51] Why are the eyes
[59:54] of Israel blinded? Why are the eyes of
[59:57] Israel closed?
[59:59] because of the scripture,
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; And and why is the scripture so that
[1:00:06] there could be a bride of his own
[1:00:08] choosing?
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; So that there could be a gentile church.
[1:00:13] That's why the children of Israel's eyes
[1:00:15] were blinded. I find it absolutely
[1:00:18] astounding, and I'm sure we all do, to
[1:00:21] think that people would turn and say
[1:00:23] that the Jews are murderers, and so we
[1:00:27] have to mistreat those people. You know,
[1:00:29] it was it was in within the 24 hours
[1:00:31] that we're existing right now, there was
[1:00:33] an attack in Australia specifically on
[1:00:36] Jews.
[1:00:38] Terrible to think about,
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; people murdered just because they're a
[1:00:42] Jew.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit that's in this world.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And you know, for a while, I thought
[1:00:49] that it was actually I don't know, maybe
[1:00:51] it's probably going to sound a little
[1:00:52] political today, but it's okay. We're
[1:00:55] going to talk the truth. That's all we
[1:00:56] can do. I thought that this was
[1:00:58] something that was done and gone and,
[1:01:00] you know, this this this anti-semitism
[1:01:03] behavior in people was kind of washed up
[1:01:07] and and not really so prevalent. But you
[1:01:09] can see it now. It's in every single
[1:01:11] university. It's in every single
[1:01:14] government. It's in every single country
[1:01:16] in this world.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit that wants to attack the
[1:01:20] Jews. And when you would see that in
[1:01:22] what we call the church to persecute our
[1:01:25] brothers,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Did we not just read that it was because
[1:01:30] of grace?
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; But somehow we can get ourselves in a
[1:01:37] suit and say that we believe that Jesus
[1:01:39] Christ died for our sins and the Jews,
[1:01:41] they're murderers.
[1:01:44] I think it's beautiful when we can look
[1:01:46] back through Revelation and really see
[1:01:48] the truth of the matter. And it's not
[1:01:50] brother Barry's truth. It's it's the
[1:01:52] gospel. This is the word of God. It's
[1:01:54] not even an interpretation of a prophet
[1:01:56] to the age in which we live in. This is
[1:01:59] very clear. Cut and dried.
[1:02:01] They were blinded. For whose sake?
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Our sake.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; So if we ever sing that song, I'm so
[1:02:08] glad that I can say I'm one of them.
[1:02:10] Can't you see it? Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Can you see that you're one of them
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; that was just given freely given grace
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; according
[1:02:20] according to Israel
[1:02:22] [snorts] when he should have blessed the
[1:02:24] elder he blessed the younger
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; the blessing went to the younger
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; it's just beautiful to think about
[1:02:32] according as it is written verse eight
[1:02:35] God hath given them who's them
[1:02:39] the elder that we just read about
[1:02:43] they were given the spirit of slumber,
[1:02:47] eyes that they should not see and ears
[1:02:50] that they should not hear unto this day.
[1:02:53] And you know, I I found it real
[1:02:54] interesting that when the feast of the
[1:02:57] Passover happens,
[1:02:59] um the Jews today even when they set up
[1:03:02] at the synagogues and and they celebrate
[1:03:04] the feast of the Passover and and they
[1:03:06] have their feast, they always have one
[1:03:09] extra chair at that table. And the
[1:03:12] reason for that is is they know that
[1:03:14] Messiah's coming
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; and they have that chair there in
[1:03:17] remembrance of him. And they are very
[1:03:20] diligent about that.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I I think it's so beautiful
[1:03:23] what you know to take a look at this
[1:03:25] this story that we were talking about
[1:03:27] today out of Genesis chapter 44.
[1:03:31] It goes back even a little bit further
[1:03:33] and and I just love this story. We
[1:03:36] preached on this a while ago. Remember
[1:03:38] we're talking about this question. Why
[1:03:41] are the eyes of Israel closed? Why are
[1:03:43] the Jews still following the Old
[1:03:45] Testament even though Jesus the New
[1:03:47] Testament was with them physically? Why
[1:03:50] are they still waiting for Moses and
[1:03:52] Elijah? I believe that we could pretty
[1:03:53] much wrap it up just with what we've
[1:03:55] read already. But I thought, you know,
[1:03:57] it will be good to just dig into this a
[1:03:59] little bit and just see what the Lord
[1:04:01] will do here. But it goes back even
[1:04:03] further to the story of Joseph and to
[1:04:05] think that Joseph was one of many
[1:04:08] brethren, wasn't he? He was born with
[1:04:11] his brother Benjamin from the same
[1:04:13] mother, the one that that his father
[1:04:16] loved. And he had a bunch of other
[1:04:19] wives.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And and the wives, remember, they had a
[1:04:22] bit of a contest because the one that he
[1:04:24] loved couldn't have children right away.
[1:04:26] Her womb was stopped up. A and so the
[1:04:28] other ones began to have children and
[1:04:30] and and began to name them. And before
[1:04:33] long, we find out that, you know, the
[1:04:35] children of Israel, the tribes of
[1:04:37] Israel, came from all of these brethren
[1:04:41] born in sort of a competitive nature.
[1:04:43] And and we know there was a time where
[1:04:46] where where where Joseph's daddy uh
[1:04:50] Jacob actually was so angry with the way
[1:04:53] things happened that he had hatred for
[1:04:55] one of the mothers and I believe it was
[1:04:58] Leia. He actually was so upset because
[1:05:01] of the way things were played out
[1:05:02] against him. We know that he tried
[1:05:04] really hard to be obedient but he did
[1:05:06] have a bit of an edge to his life. He
[1:05:09] did have a nature. Brother Brandham
[1:05:11] called him a shyer. He he he was pretty
[1:05:13] smart guy. He was pretty cunning. He was
[1:05:16] able to do things in in a way that was
[1:05:19] really different from everyone else. But
[1:05:21] you know in sorry I'm I'm talking about
[1:05:24] Joseph's dad there. But Joseph was born
[1:05:27] into this family through the wife that
[1:05:30] he loved
[1:05:32] that his daddy loved and we know that's
[1:05:35] Jacob or Israel.
[1:05:37] But through that story Joseph became a
[1:05:40] type of Christ.
[1:05:43] Joseph, he had a wife that he loved.
[1:05:48] Jacob had a wife that he loved. His
[1:05:52] father loved his mother is what I'm
[1:05:54] trying to say. But his brethren hated
[1:05:56] him for no cause.
[1:05:59] His He didn't do anything to his
[1:06:01] brethren. He was a dreamer. He had the
[1:06:03] ability, the gift to actually dream,
[1:06:07] dream dreams and actually be able to
[1:06:11] interpret dreams. He had the ability to
[1:06:13] encourage people through these dreams.
[1:06:16] But what his brethren hated was that his
[1:06:18] parents listened to him. They they
[1:06:20] thought it's interesting to hear the
[1:06:22] dreams. And and so in in those
[1:06:26] situations, it's funny because when you
[1:06:28] look at it and and you see how Joseph,
[1:06:32] even though he knew his brethren hated
[1:06:35] him, they did not like him. They
[1:06:38] detested him that his parents listened
[1:06:40] to him, he still had dreams and he still
[1:06:44] told about his dreams.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I could do that. I might
[1:06:49] want to just pull back and and maybe be
[1:06:52] a little bit reclusive and not tell
[1:06:54] because it would keep the peace.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; But he had to tell of his dreams.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; I I think it's amazing because we know
[1:07:02] that his dad celebrated him. His dad
[1:07:04] created him a coat of many colors,
[1:07:07] didn't he?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; None of the other brothers got that.
[1:07:12] [snorts] Anybody here have favorite
[1:07:13] children? Don't raise your hands.
[1:07:18] But this story, it talks about that.
[1:07:21] [snorts] And then we see that he
[1:07:23] actually would have a dream that would
[1:07:24] say, "You know what? I just had this
[1:07:26] dream, mommy and daddy." And and the
[1:07:27] brothers would be listening again. Oh,
[1:07:29] here we go. Another story, right? And
[1:07:31] and he would say, "You know, I dreamt
[1:07:32] that that I was out in the field and and
[1:07:34] and all of my brothers, they they
[1:07:37] actually bowed down before me in o obes
[1:07:41] o ob obedience obesessence to me. And
[1:07:45] and we know that they said, "Are you
[1:07:46] serious? You're actually gonna say that
[1:07:48] to us in front of everyone." But we know
[1:07:51] that daddy took note of it. He actually
[1:07:53] paid attention to it. And then he went
[1:07:55] further and said, "I had another dream.
[1:07:57] I dreamt that the sun, the moon, the
[1:07:59] stars, they all did the same thing. Now
[1:08:02] the they said, "Now you're crazy. Now we
[1:08:04] know you are a lunatic."
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; They went out and they were about their
[1:08:09] father's business. And we know that he
[1:08:10] didn't have to go to work because he was
[1:08:12] the favorite child, right?
[1:08:14] He got to stay home. He was younger. So
[1:08:17] all the older brothers were out dealing
[1:08:18] with the father's sheep and and dealing
[1:08:20] with the herds and the flocks. But he
[1:08:23] got sent out to see him. Go [snorts] and
[1:08:25] give a report, see how these brethren
[1:08:28] are doing. Because daddy was smart. He
[1:08:30] knew how they would fool around. He knew
[1:08:32] their their behavior. He knew what they
[1:08:35] were doing. And and he just sent out the
[1:08:37] youngest, the second youngest, just go
[1:08:40] out and check them out and and see
[1:08:42] what's going on.
[1:08:44] And we know in doing that they
[1:08:46] manifested that life that was in them.
[1:08:48] It was murder. It was hatred. It was all
[1:08:52] of the above.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Persecution.
[1:08:55] Joseph didn't do anything to them. He
[1:08:57] just did what his daddy told him.
[1:09:00] [snorts] But going out there, what
[1:09:01] happened?
[1:09:03] They said, "Oh boy, here comes that
[1:09:05] dreamer.
[1:09:07] Let's kill him. Let's do away with him
[1:09:09] once and for all. Daddy will never know.
[1:09:13] we'll just get rid of them and we won't
[1:09:15] have to contend with all of this
[1:09:16] nonsense, all of this favoritism that we
[1:09:20] have to put up with in our family.
[1:09:23] So, they devised and they were going to
[1:09:25] kill him. But, we know one of the
[1:09:26] brothers, he stepped up and he said,
[1:09:28] "No, don't do it. Let's do something
[1:09:31] else. Let's just throw them in a pit.
[1:09:33] And and and what we can do is take a
[1:09:35] lamb and and slay the lamb and and we'll
[1:09:37] bring it and put it all over the coat
[1:09:39] and we'll say that we just found this
[1:09:40] shredded coat of as many colors, this
[1:09:43] favoritism token. We'll bring it back to
[1:09:45] you with the shed blood of a lamb on it.
[1:09:48] Isn't that interesting that that would
[1:09:50] be what they would give back to dad? And
[1:09:53] they told him, and you could imagine,
[1:09:56] dad said, "Now I'm going to go down into
[1:09:57] my my grave with gray hair with this
[1:10:00] kind of sorrow. So, I've had all kinds
[1:10:02] of trials and tribulations in my life,
[1:10:04] and now this is what's come my way.
[1:10:09] It's amazing to think about. And and
[1:10:11] this guy, Joseph, he didn't do anything,
[1:10:13] did he? He just told the truth. I had a
[1:10:17] dream. This is my dream. Dad, he gave me
[1:10:20] a coat. I didn't ask him, "Can you get
[1:10:21] me a coat? Can I be your favorite?" He
[1:10:25] just did.
[1:10:28] So, what happened? They didn't kill him.
[1:10:30] We know they said, "Hey, maybe we could
[1:10:33] make a little bit of money here. Maybe
[1:10:36] we could actually do something better
[1:10:37] than killing him or just leaving him
[1:10:39] here because he could be found. What we
[1:10:41] should do is sell him. Let's sell him
[1:10:43] off. There's going to be some slave
[1:10:46] traders coming by here. Let's just sell
[1:10:47] him to them and and send him down into
[1:10:50] Egypt and and then he'll be gone. He'll
[1:10:52] just be gone. He'll be a slave and
[1:10:53] nobody will ever know him. His coat will
[1:10:55] be gone. It'll be the end of him." And
[1:10:57] that's what they did. They got some
[1:11:00] money for that transaction. They didn't
[1:11:01] just let him go. And it's interesting
[1:11:04] that they took the money. We're going to
[1:11:05] get into that a little bit later, but
[1:11:07] they took the money. They made the
[1:11:09] transaction. It was a contract. If you
[1:11:12] do, I will. Right? So, they did. They
[1:11:16] took the money, gave him their brother,
[1:11:18] and he went down into Egypt. And and we
[1:11:21] know the story. It's so terrible to
[1:11:23] think about how he did nothing wrong.
[1:11:25] And here he finds himself now probably
[1:11:28] in a chain gang with slaves being
[1:11:30] whipped, mistreated, terribly treated,
[1:11:33] taken down and thrown into the the
[1:11:35] masses of slaves and maybe go to a slave
[1:11:38] auction. And now this guy Pontifer finds
[1:11:42] him and says, "He looks good. He looks
[1:11:45] strong.
[1:11:47] I'll buy him and take him back to my
[1:11:50] house." And we know that he did that.
[1:11:52] And as he went back, he just lived the
[1:11:55] life that he was taught. The word of God
[1:11:57] says, "Train them up in the way they
[1:11:58] should go and it won't depart from
[1:12:00] them."
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; He never had parents there saying, you
[1:12:02] know, you got to remember to pray.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; You know, we should have family
[1:12:06] devotions. We got to go to church.
[1:12:09] Remember, you got to read your Bible.
[1:12:12] Remember, there was none of that going
[1:12:14] on with the parents physically, but you
[1:12:17] can imagine they had already instilled
[1:12:18] that in their child. And so everywhere
[1:12:21] that he went, he just was.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't act. He just was who God
[1:12:27] created him to be, who his parents
[1:12:30] helped shape and mold him to be. And
[1:12:32] because of that, God's blessing followed
[1:12:35] him every day of his life.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And can you imagine, was he thinking,
[1:12:41] "Oh my, this is God's blessing in my
[1:12:43] life." when his brothers were jostling
[1:12:45] around with him and about to throw him
[1:12:47] into a pit.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that?
[1:12:56] Is this God's blessing for my life as I
[1:13:00] hit the ground in the pit and maybe feel
[1:13:03] like I dislocated my shoulder and I
[1:13:06] didn't do anything wrong?
[1:13:08] But yet here I find myself at the bottom
[1:13:10] of the pit. Oh my Excuse [snorts]
[1:13:15] me.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; That doesn't happen very often here.
[1:13:22] God's blessing in our lives might not
[1:13:25] look pretty.
[1:13:29] It might not be appealing.
[1:13:32] It might not be the way that we think it
[1:13:34] should be.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; But does that change the promise?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Does that change God? Doesn't change his
[1:13:41] word?
[1:13:43] My
[1:13:45] his brethren hated him for no reason.
[1:13:49] He had a gift and he couldn't help it.
[1:13:52] [snorts] And I bet he couldn't even
[1:13:53] understand the gift, could he?
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Probably not.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; It just was. It just happened that way.
[1:14:00] [snorts]
[1:14:02] wrongly accused, thrown into the pit,
[1:14:05] sold into slavery, taken to Egypt,
[1:14:10] and now [snorts]
[1:14:13] as a slave finds himself in the house of
[1:14:15] Poniper. [snorts]
[1:14:18] But God's blessing is upon him because
[1:14:20] he just existed the way that he was.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; He wasn't a false pretender. I think
[1:14:26] that's so beautiful. I think [snorts]
[1:14:28] there's so much power just in that one
[1:14:30] thing. There was no desire to try and be
[1:14:34] anyone other than who he actually was.
[1:14:39] Somehow he was comfortable in his own
[1:14:40] skin.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; And I pray that we could be that way as
[1:14:44] well.
[1:14:45] But while he was there, God's blessing
[1:14:47] just followed him because of who he was.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to pretend. He wasn't
[1:14:52] acting. [snorts] And even in the midst
[1:14:55] of that, the devil still had to try and
[1:14:58] challenge him. God's blessing. Think
[1:15:01] about this. God's blessing was that
[1:15:04] Poniper's wife would come on to him and
[1:15:07] actually try and get him to fornicate or
[1:15:10] commit adultery. For him, it would have
[1:15:12] been fornication. For her, it would have
[1:15:13] been adultery. [snorts] But to try and
[1:15:15] get him to do that was God's blessing.
[1:15:18] Why? Because he found himself in prison.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have gone to prison if he
[1:15:24] didn't actually have that trial, that
[1:15:26] tribulation in his life. He wouldn't
[1:15:28] have actually been exalted to the right
[1:15:30] hand of Pharaoh if he didn't go to
[1:15:32] prison.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; That was God's blessing in his life.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Going to prison.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; But that gift that was in his life,
[1:15:43] gifts and callings are without
[1:15:44] repentance.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; There's no pretending about those. They
[1:15:48] just manifest. They just happen. You are
[1:15:49] who you are.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; While he was in prison, God's blessing
[1:15:54] followed him. Amen.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; We know that he was again, wasn't he?
[1:15:57] Again, wrongly accused. Thrown in prison
[1:16:00] for something he didn't do,
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; wrongly accused
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; while he was there. The butler and the
[1:16:07] baker, the mischievous one. Someone did
[1:16:10] something wrong. And Pharaoh said, "I've
[1:16:12] had enough of it. Someone's going to
[1:16:14] pay." And both of them were in prison.
[1:16:17] And we know that they both spoke to
[1:16:20] Joseph. He found out about why they were
[1:16:22] there. Joseph was actually in another
[1:16:24] position in the prison. He wasn't just a
[1:16:26] prisoner slave in the prison because of
[1:16:28] God's blessing. They recognized it and
[1:16:30] he was exalted
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; in the prison.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; The prisoner actually got exalted to
[1:16:37] leadership in the prison.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; It's amazing to think about
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; God's blessing. He knows exactly how to
[1:16:43] encourage us, right? Exactly when to do
[1:16:47] it as well. But while he's there and and
[1:16:50] he's in this position, what happens is
[1:16:52] these two characters get thrown in with
[1:16:54] him and and they have they have this
[1:16:56] concern and they bring it to him
[1:16:58] [snorts] and he says, "Hey, I'll ask the
[1:17:00] Lord about it.
[1:17:02] He has a dream and he gets the answer,
[1:17:05] doesn't he?"
[1:17:07] [snorts]
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; One of them is going to have their head
[1:17:09] hung high
[1:17:11] and the other one is actually going to
[1:17:13] bear the cup again to Pharaoh. And we
[1:17:16] know the baker is the one that was the
[1:17:18] guy that uh he was wrong in the
[1:17:20] situation. And he told him, your head's
[1:17:23] coming off in three days. Sorry about
[1:17:26] your luck. That's what's going to
[1:17:28] happen. And and the other one, the cup
[1:17:30] bearer, you're going to be back beside
[1:17:32] Pharaoh. And when you go there, don't
[1:17:34] forget about me.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Please remember me.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; And we know it came to pass exactly as
[1:17:42] he said. But it wasn't right away.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Years later,
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; God's blessing in his life.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Many times I think that we as believers
[1:17:55] in the day in which we live need to look
[1:17:57] back to these stories and recognize when
[1:17:59] God does something, it is not a simple
[1:18:02] text message and an immediate response.
[1:18:04] It's not just a voicemail. It's not just
[1:18:06] an email. It's not God's program. God's
[1:18:10] program is to wait upon the spirit of
[1:18:13] the Lord.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; To wait upon the Lord. He will renew our
[1:18:18] strength. He'll bring the answer. It
[1:18:20] will come exactly in his time. And when
[1:18:22] it does, brothers and sisters, it's
[1:18:25] perfect.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; It's exactly the way it needs to be,
[1:18:28] isn't it?
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; But for Joseph in his story here, he is
[1:18:34] in prison in God's blessing.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] interprets these dreams. The cup bearer
[1:18:40] goes back. The baker goes to the grave
[1:18:43] and there's Joseph
[1:18:45] still thinking, "My, am I in God's
[1:18:48] blessing?"
[1:18:52] But, you know, he probably still read
[1:18:53] his Bible and still praised the Lord.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Said, "Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:18:57] I still have strength. I still have
[1:18:58] health. I still believe.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; I know who my daddy is.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; I know whom I have believed."
[1:19:07] and that he is able.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; My [snorts]
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; he goes
[1:19:14] and he actually just continues on living
[1:19:16] his life in prison just doing the best
[1:19:18] he can doing everything as unto the
[1:19:22] Lord.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Not unto Pharaoh, not unto anyone else
[1:19:25] because he wasn't serving them. He was
[1:19:28] serving the living God
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; because that's how he was raised.
[1:19:33] And in doing so, there came a day where
[1:19:36] the cup bearer said, "Oh,
[1:19:39] Pharaoh had a dream. He dreamt about the
[1:19:42] kind cows,
[1:19:45] seven fat and seven lean. He couldn't
[1:19:48] understand the dream. Pharaoh was
[1:19:50] troubled. He was perplexed by it." And
[1:19:53] what did he do?
[1:19:55] He pondered it. But the cup bearer said,
[1:19:58] "Hey, I might have a solution. I might
[1:20:00] know someone. Something's come back to
[1:20:02] my remembrance.
[1:20:04] And we know it was years later this
[1:20:06] dream happened. This dream wasn't just
[1:20:08] an accident. There's no coincidence.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; This dream was God bringing to pass his
[1:20:14] plan.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; And then we know the story from there.
[1:20:19] We know
[1:20:21] Joseph was brought out. He was given the
[1:20:24] opportunity and he interpreted the dream
[1:20:27] and he told him you got seven good years
[1:20:29] and you got seven lean years coming and
[1:20:31] if we prepare properly for those seven
[1:20:33] lean years in the seven good years there
[1:20:36] will be life. There will be sustenance
[1:20:39] in the land. And we know that Pharaoh
[1:20:42] said, "Who can we get to do something
[1:20:44] like this? We're going to need someone
[1:20:45] who's really sharp in wisdom and able to
[1:20:48] discern the things that need to be
[1:20:50] discerned. someone who has maybe the
[1:20:52] spirit of God upon him. Oh, wait a
[1:20:54] second. How about you?
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Your big idea. How about you execute it?
[1:21:01] Because I believe that that is the
[1:21:02] interpretation of the dream.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; And we know that Joseph went right to
[1:21:06] the right hand of Pharaoh. And so much
[1:21:08] that nothing happened, nothing moved in
[1:21:11] the land of Egypt if Pharaoh went if if
[1:21:14] Joseph went by. I mean,
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; it's just such a beautiful story.
[1:21:21] Joseph,
[1:21:23] the one in our scripture today, saying,
[1:21:27] "Father,
[1:21:29] don't cross your hands."
[1:21:31] And the father wittingly said to him,
[1:21:33] "Hey, this is not my choice. This is
[1:21:36] God's choice.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; The elder is going to serve the
[1:21:40] younger."
[1:21:43] Now, we could stop right there and say,
[1:21:44] "The elder are the Jews and the younger
[1:21:47] are the Gentile." That's right.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; But there's so much more. There's so
[1:21:51] much more to talk about there. I think
[1:21:53] it's beautiful. We know that in this
[1:21:55] story that we're talking about in Joseph
[1:21:58] that it goes further. It's just such a
[1:22:00] magnificent story, isn't it?
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Because even once he rose to the right
[1:22:04] hand of Pharaoh and he got to the place
[1:22:07] where he was in his position, I can only
[1:22:10] imagine that he wondered if one day he
[1:22:13] could see his daddy again. if one day
[1:22:16] that his daddy potentially could see his
[1:22:18] children again, if his brothers still
[1:22:20] lived. And we know that when the seven
[1:22:23] years of of fatness in the land
[1:22:25] happened, they gathered the grain and
[1:22:27] and he executed everything, took the
[1:22:29] taxes and the tithes and everything and
[1:22:31] built up the storehouses. Everything was
[1:22:34] in order. The seven years of famine hit.
[1:22:37] And we know there was food in Egypt, but
[1:22:40] there wasn't food everywhere else,
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; right? It was it was a dark in the land.
[1:22:46] It was really really thin. And we know
[1:22:49] that the children of Israel were
[1:22:51] starting to starve. But they weren't
[1:22:52] just children. They were adults. And
[1:22:55] they were with their dad. And and
[1:22:57] they're like, "We're going to die. This
[1:22:58] isn't good. We need to do something
[1:23:00] about this." And someone says, "Hey, I
[1:23:02] think I heard that down in Egypt they've
[1:23:03] got food still. There's grain there.
[1:23:05] Maybe we could go and get some." Dad
[1:23:08] says, "Okay,
[1:23:10] go."
[1:23:12] They go there. We know the story so
[1:23:14] well. They come in. Joseph now, the one
[1:23:18] that they persecuted,
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; the one that they mistreated,
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; the one that they hated,
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; all of those terrible things, that
[1:23:28] person now is seated on the throne,
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; and they get to come in and start having
[1:23:36] conversations with him.
[1:23:39] And to think about how he could have
[1:23:41] executed judgment from the very first
[1:23:44] moment that he saw them. And to some
[1:23:46] extent he did. We know that he grabbed
[1:23:48] them, nabbed them, and said, "You're
[1:23:49] spies." I'm just going to gloss over.
[1:23:52] I'm not going to dig in too far because
[1:23:53] I want to talk about other stuff, but he
[1:23:55] did. He said, "You're spies. You're
[1:23:56] liars." And they were. They weren't
[1:23:59] necessarily spies, but they were liars.
[1:24:01] And he said, "You're going into prison,
[1:24:03] and you know what? I'm going to deal
[1:24:06] with you the way that I want to deal
[1:24:07] with you." They didn't know that he
[1:24:08] could actually understand their
[1:24:10] language.
[1:24:11] He was listening to him talk.
[1:24:14] But he was smart.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; He wasn't he wasn't a fool like they
[1:24:19] made him out to be. But in his situation
[1:24:21] where I want to get to, even though he
[1:24:23] was in that position where anything that
[1:24:25] he said would go. And we know the story
[1:24:28] shows that he fooled with them a little
[1:24:30] bit. He sent them on their way and and
[1:24:32] he sent them back home and said, "Don't
[1:24:34] worry about it." and put their gold back
[1:24:36] in their bags with some grain and and uh
[1:24:38] the proender and sent them back home
[1:24:40] with the grain. And we know that when
[1:24:42] they got back home, they they saw the
[1:24:44] the gold in their bags and their dad
[1:24:46] said, "What's this? What are you doing?
[1:24:48] How did you get this grain?"
[1:24:50] And they said, "We don't even know."
[1:24:53] And we know they went back for more.
[1:24:56] They They ran out of that grain. They
[1:24:57] went back for more. Joseph knew they'd
[1:24:59] come back. He only gave him enough for
[1:25:01] so long. He was pretty pretty wise in
[1:25:04] his ways. And when they came back, he
[1:25:06] said, "Listen,
[1:25:08] you can actually get some more grain,
[1:25:10] but I want my younger brother here." He
[1:25:13] didn't tell them that he knew he had a
[1:25:15] younger brother. He said, "Have you got
[1:25:17] another brother?" And and we know that
[1:25:19] they went home and told their dad that I
[1:25:21] was on the first visit and their dad
[1:25:23] said, "Why would you say that? I
[1:25:27] actually have lost one son from my wife
[1:25:29] that I loved. Now you're going to give
[1:25:32] away my other son. Are you crazy?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the turmoil in their
[1:25:36] house?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; But they said, "Hey, if we want to live,
[1:25:40] we have to do this. We've got to take
[1:25:42] Benjamin."
[1:25:44] So they take Benjamin. And I think it's
[1:25:46] just beautiful. The way the Lord does
[1:25:48] things is so magnificent. Hey,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; in the end, we know the story. They all
[1:25:54] go there and he reveals himself. He
[1:25:57] treats them well. He doesn't actually
[1:26:00] mistreat his brethren when he had
[1:26:02] humanly speaking every reason to
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; and maybe in some levels spiritually
[1:26:08] speaking every reason to.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; But we know that this guy was a type of
[1:26:13] Christ
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; because what did he do? He prepared a
[1:26:16] banquet feast for his brethren.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; And then he kicked everyone out and he
[1:26:25] revealed himself to his brethren.
[1:26:28] And we know the cry went forth that was
[1:26:30] loud. He wept aloud as he revealed
[1:26:33] himself to his brethren. I think it's
[1:26:36] just magnificent this story to think
[1:26:38] about. These people were blinded for the
[1:26:42] Gentiles sake.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Just by grace,
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; just by the grace of election as we read
[1:26:51] this morning.
[1:26:53] Yes.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; The only reason we hear the message of
[1:26:56] the hour, that we have the ability to
[1:26:57] hear the message of the hour, isn't
[1:26:59] because grandpa or grandma or mom or dad
[1:27:01] just gave us the tapes and said, "Here,
[1:27:03] listen. It's because we were elected in
[1:27:06] God before the foundation of the world
[1:27:08] to have an ear to hear what the spirit
[1:27:10] says to the church in the age in which
[1:27:12] we live."
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't puff us up and make us
[1:27:16] something. It makes us recognize how
[1:27:18] insignificant we truly are because it's
[1:27:21] only by the grace of God.
[1:27:26] [crying]
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Let's turn over to second Corinthians.
[1:27:34] Why?
[1:27:37] Why are they blind?
[1:27:42] What's our first question here? Why are
[1:27:44] the eyes of Israel closed?
[1:27:47] Why are the Jews still following the Old
[1:27:50] Testament?
[1:27:52] Sorry, we want more than just 2
[1:27:55] Corinthians. We want 2 Corinthians 3.
[1:28:03] 2 Corinthians
[1:28:09] three.
[1:28:16] My
[1:28:20] let's start reading with verse 11. For
[1:28:22] if that which is done away was glorious,
[1:28:26] much more that which remainth
[1:28:29] is glorious.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; I know we could say amen to that. That
[1:28:33] is
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; wonderful.
[1:28:36] Seeing then that we have such hope,
[1:28:40] we use great plainness of speech,
[1:28:44] and not as Moses,
[1:28:47] which put a veil over his face, that the
[1:28:50] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[1:28:52] look to the end of that which is
[1:28:56] abolished.
[1:28:58] But their minds were blinded.
[1:29:02] For until this day remainth the same
[1:29:06] veil untaken away in the reading of the
[1:29:10] Old Testament,
[1:29:13] which veil is done away in Christ.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; This scripture,
[1:29:22] I think it's so beautiful because we had
[1:29:24] a prophet say this. This day, this
[1:29:27] scripture is fulfilled.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Ever since this started, this day, this
[1:29:35] scripture has been fulfilled. But we can
[1:29:36] see this. They say they see Jesus as a
[1:29:40] prophet. And that's it. A prophet. We
[1:29:44] see Jesus as the prophet.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus as Messiah. Jesus as God.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse
[1:29:56] 14, but their minds were blinded. For
[1:29:59] until this day remainth the same veil
[1:30:02] untaken away in the reading of the Old
[1:30:04] Testament, which veil is done away in
[1:30:07] Christ. But even unto this day, when
[1:30:11] Moses is read, the veil is upon their
[1:30:14] heart.
[1:30:16] So we can try to convert Jews all we
[1:30:20] want.
[1:30:21] when they are elected Jews, the veil is
[1:30:24] upon their heart.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that we can say to
[1:30:27] change that.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; But you know, brothers and sisters, one
[1:30:31] of these days, soon and very, very soon,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; they are going to meet the king
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; because just as Joseph revealed himself
[1:30:43] to his brethren, we're just on the very
[1:30:45] edge of it, taking place in the land of
[1:30:48] Israel. Now, the spirit of God is
[1:30:50] lifting off of the gentile church. We
[1:30:52] know, brother Brandham says it in
[1:30:54] questions and answers. That's the reason
[1:30:56] why we can't pray the way that we would
[1:30:57] like to. The revival is over.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; The great revival is over. The calling
[1:31:03] of all of the gentile church. Now, it is
[1:31:06] the gleaning in the field.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Now, it is the the ripening of the
[1:31:11] grain. Brother Brandham said, "I can
[1:31:12] hear the combine coming. Let's get
[1:31:14] ready." But here we have the children of
[1:31:17] Israel. Their minds are thoroughly
[1:31:19] blinded. And the more you preach to them
[1:31:21] this word, the more they're blind.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; But at the time appointed of the father,
[1:31:28] which is very, very soon,
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; their eyes are going to be open.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Just like we've been talking about eyes
[1:31:35] being closed, eyes being open, being
[1:31:37] able to perceive, being able to have the
[1:31:39] perception. It's only by the grace of
[1:31:42] God that we're able to have the
[1:31:44] perception.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; But here we have the children of Israel,
[1:31:47] the Jews, their minds are blinded.
[1:31:51] Not their eyes, their minds.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And they believe the book of Moses.
[1:31:57] They believe, some of them are so very
[1:32:00] staunch, they might even put some
[1:32:02] message believers to shame by how
[1:32:05] incredibly devout they are to what they
[1:32:08] believe.
[1:32:11] I find it really fascinating to watch
[1:32:13] Israel. Brother Bradom said it. If you
[1:32:15] want to know what time it is, that's
[1:32:17] God's time piece.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Look at the children of Israel. And and
[1:32:22] you know, brothers and sisters, if we
[1:32:23] look at the children of Israel as a
[1:32:25] whole, if we just zoom out, maybe go out
[1:32:26] into outer space a long ways and just
[1:32:28] look at that little blue planet, you
[1:32:30] know, um if we just have that kind of a
[1:32:32] perspective and think about how come
[1:32:35] right now is there such a resurgence of
[1:32:38] persecution for the Jews.
[1:32:43] Brother Brandham talked about Israel
[1:32:45] being in her homeland,
[1:32:47] you know, on the wings of eagles, the
[1:32:49] return of the of the Jews back to their
[1:32:52] their homeland for the settlement. They
[1:32:54] recognize that the blessing is in the
[1:32:56] land. There's been call after call after
[1:32:58] call for the Jews to go back home. But
[1:33:00] why is there such a savage persecution
[1:33:04] to people who are Jews in this world?
[1:33:08] I think it's amazing because the devil
[1:33:10] knows his time is exceptionally
[1:33:12] exceedingly short.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Exceptionally short. Because when the
[1:33:16] bride goes home, he's got three and a
[1:33:18] half years to accomplish everything that
[1:33:19] he's ever going to do. Then he's going
[1:33:22] to be plucked up and thrown in the lake
[1:33:23] of fire. Can you imagine that? He's been
[1:33:27] around for how many years? How many
[1:33:30] years before human beings the devil has
[1:33:32] been around? And he's come to the place
[1:33:34] now where he when the bride goes home,
[1:33:37] three and one half years he has left to
[1:33:41] do any business that he's ever gonna do.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; And then he's going to be punished. And
[1:33:47] I know some are saying, well, there's
[1:33:48] the thousand years. He's going to have a
[1:33:50] thousand years and he will have a
[1:33:52] thousand years, but he's not going to be
[1:33:53] able to accomplish anything in those
[1:33:55] thousand of years because he's going to
[1:33:58] be bound by chains. And we know the
[1:34:00] prophet in our day said those chains are
[1:34:02] not logging chains. Anybody ever seen
[1:34:04] logging chains? Chains maybe like you
[1:34:07] would have on a ship for an anchor. Big
[1:34:09] humongous links. Something really strong
[1:34:12] and robust, heavy iron chains to bind
[1:34:15] that guy up and hold him on the side of
[1:34:17] the pit. No, it's not going to be that
[1:34:19] at all. It's going to be chains of
[1:34:20] circumstance because the bride is going
[1:34:23] to have a brand new body.
[1:34:25] She's not going to be subject to all of
[1:34:27] the pressures and and and sinful nature
[1:34:30] that she had to contend with in the
[1:34:32] past. He's going to be bound for a
[1:34:33] thousand years by chains of
[1:34:34] circumstance.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; He's not going to have any effect on
[1:34:37] her. Can you imagine what it will be
[1:34:39] like to live in this world, which we
[1:34:41] will for a thousand years without any
[1:34:43] effect of Satan?
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Zero. He won't have any pressure on our
[1:34:49] lives because we will be exactly who we
[1:34:53] are supposed to be.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Now, how does that thousand years fit
[1:34:56] into the three and a half years? I don't
[1:34:59] know.
[1:35:01] I don't think that we can actually
[1:35:02] explain that because we're talking about
[1:35:04] a supernatural time frame, an eternal
[1:35:06] time frame, and and a time, a space and
[1:35:09] time. And I believe they run
[1:35:11] consecutively myself. how you actually
[1:35:14] fit the two together as a puzzle, that's
[1:35:16] up to God. I don't think it's up to us
[1:35:18] to be able to explain it down to the
[1:35:20] minute. But, you know, if we were to
[1:35:23] take a look at it, I think it's an
[1:35:25] interesting study. If you look at a day
[1:35:28] in the sight of God is as a thousand
[1:35:30] years, and a thousand years is as a day.
[1:35:33] The space in heaven, the the scripture
[1:35:36] that we love, how there was silence in
[1:35:38] heaven for the space of half an hour.
[1:35:40] How many people know how long that is?
[1:35:42] If we're talking about years, human
[1:35:44] years on Earth here, it's 21 and a half
[1:35:47] years. Just about 22 years if you break
[1:35:51] it down and and just go with that
[1:35:53] formula. It's really interesting to
[1:35:54] think about. But we're not talking about
[1:35:56] time and space the way that we think
[1:35:58] about it. And and it's so important to
[1:35:59] remember that because our theophony
[1:36:01] bodies aren't coming back to this time
[1:36:03] and space, are they?
[1:36:06] We're never going to actually have
[1:36:08] incorruption inherit corruption.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; And corruption is never going to inherit
[1:36:14] incorruption. Those two are not going to
[1:36:16] mix.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; But somehow Satan's going to be in the
[1:36:19] midst of it. He's going to be bound. I
[1:36:20] think it's such a beautiful thing. He
[1:36:22] will have no power over us. And you
[1:36:25] know, I believe it with all my heart
[1:36:27] too, brothers and sisters, that even now
[1:36:29] as we go forwards, we're coming to the
[1:36:31] place where he has no power over us
[1:36:33] because we know that brother Bradam said
[1:36:35] it, God said it through his prophet,
[1:36:37] that when the bride recognizes what it
[1:36:39] is, when the church recognizes what it
[1:36:41] is, and and the bride I I would say when
[1:36:44] the church recognizes that it's the
[1:36:45] wife,
[1:36:47] then the rapture will go. When we
[1:36:49] recognize that we're the wife, the
[1:36:51] rapture will go.
[1:36:53] I'll say it that way and I'm not going
[1:36:54] to add to it or take away from it. I'm
[1:36:56] just trying to illustrate when we go
[1:36:58] from just maybe being in church and
[1:37:00] having a church experience to actually
[1:37:03] having that intimacy, the one-on-one
[1:37:05] where it's no longer me plus God where
[1:37:08] we are one. I think it changes
[1:37:11] everything.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; But these guys were blinded
[1:37:15] for until this day remainth the same
[1:37:17] veil untaken away.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the reading of the Old
[1:37:21] Testament, which veil is done away in
[1:37:22] Christ. But even unto this day, when
[1:37:24] Moses is read, we know that's the first
[1:37:26] few books of the Bible, the veil is upon
[1:37:28] their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall
[1:37:31] turn to the Lord, the veil shall be
[1:37:34] taken away.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; It's such a beautiful thing. We know
[1:37:39] there's coming a day where they're going
[1:37:41] to say to him,
[1:37:43] "We really appreciate you and and the
[1:37:46] way you speak and the way you you relate
[1:37:49] to scriptures and everything about you
[1:37:52] is just captivating us. What is it about
[1:37:55] you? And where did you get those scars?"
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; And he's going to say to them, "In the
[1:38:01] house of my friends."
[1:38:04] And we know that that veil is going to
[1:38:06] be pulled away and there's going to be a
[1:38:08] cry because a nation is going to be
[1:38:10] converted
[1:38:12] right now in a day. A whole nation.
[1:38:17] And it's amazing because we look at it.
[1:38:19] We're not seeing the the rapture of the
[1:38:21] church of the living God converted in a
[1:38:23] in a day.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; The gentile church is converted as
[1:38:27] individuals.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; He deals with the Jews as a nation.
[1:38:32] Verse 16. Nevertheless, when it shall
[1:38:33] turn to the Lord, the veil shall be
[1:38:35] taken away. Now, the Lord is that
[1:38:38] spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:38:40] is, there is liberty.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And my Bible, the footnote says freedom.
[1:38:46] freedom
[1:38:48] makes me think of the the time where
[1:38:50] brother Brandham talks about the
[1:38:52] declaration of emancipation
[1:38:55] in the United States of America and how
[1:38:58] terrible life was because slavery was an
[1:39:02] option.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; But we know the government actually
[1:39:06] changed it. And we know they didn't
[1:39:07] change it because they wanted to change
[1:39:09] it. They changed it because God wanted
[1:39:11] it changed. Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; There's no government that operates
[1:39:15] unless God says so.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; We know that every government is
[1:39:21] controlled by Satan.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; But Satan is only a tool in the hand of
[1:39:25] God.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; He's only going to do whatever God
[1:39:28] wants.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; It's such an amazing thing to think
[1:39:32] about. But when that day was declared,
[1:39:36] tomorrow there will be no more slavery
[1:39:38] in this country. Brother Brandham, he
[1:39:41] does the the description. He he he
[1:39:43] theatricizes it. I I don't know how you
[1:39:46] say that, but he he he he explains it in
[1:39:48] such a way that there would have been
[1:39:50] people climbing to the clamoring to the
[1:39:52] top of hills.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; When that sun rises tomorrow, slavery is
[1:39:58] abolished in this land.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; That is the sunshine of Jubilee.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. There would have been people
[1:40:06] scrambling to the tops of the highest
[1:40:09] point they could find, looking for that
[1:40:11] first ray of the sunrise to be able to
[1:40:14] say, "I'm free.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I'm free.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; My children are going to be free." We
[1:40:20] are no longer slaves.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; And we know that it's just like Brother
[1:40:24] Brandham talks about as well, the the
[1:40:26] story about being a slave. In the land
[1:40:29] of Israel, every 50 years was the year
[1:40:31] of Jubilee. They'd blow the trumpet and
[1:40:33] you could go free. any debts you owed,
[1:40:36] any any problems you had, any mortgages,
[1:40:39] anything that you had to deal with. If
[1:40:40] you were a slave, if you didn't pay your
[1:40:42] bills and your wife and your children
[1:40:44] got sold into slavery, everyone could go
[1:40:47] free at that 50th year. When the
[1:40:50] trumpets blew at whatever time it was,
[1:40:53] you could go free. You could lay down
[1:40:54] your shovel and your hoe. You could stop
[1:40:56] serving. You could take off your apron.
[1:40:58] You could walk out of the kitchen a free
[1:41:00] human. and you could walk right back
[1:41:02] into your land and everything that you
[1:41:04] once owned became yours again.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; The year of Jubilee. And brother Batam,
[1:41:09] he says it, it's out of the Bible. The
[1:41:11] people that didn't want to actually go
[1:41:12] free, they said they would take them to
[1:41:15] the temple and they would bore a hole in
[1:41:18] their ear
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; and they would remain a slave forever
[1:41:22] after that point. the jubilation, the
[1:41:26] Jubilee trumpet would never have power
[1:41:29] over them ever again because they chose
[1:41:33] slavery over freedom.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; And brother Bradom takes that and he
[1:41:38] actually spiritualizes it and says the
[1:41:41] same thing with the word of God in the
[1:41:43] day in which you live. If you choose to
[1:41:46] hold on to a tradition, if you choose to
[1:41:48] hold on to some other teaching and try
[1:41:50] and make a hybrid religion of this
[1:41:53] message,
[1:41:55] There'll come a time where your
[1:41:57] spiritual ear will get a whole bored in
[1:42:00] it
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; and you will no longer be able to hear
[1:42:05] about liberty.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; It will simply be religion.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; And I want to encourage each one of us,
[1:42:14] never let ourselves get to that point.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; We need to make sure that we're able to
[1:42:18] hear that there is liberty where the
[1:42:21] spirit of the Lord is. If we want to
[1:42:23] dance and shout, this is the place to do
[1:42:25] it.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; If we want to scream and yell, this is
[1:42:29] the place to do it. If we want to
[1:42:31] worship God, there's going to be no
[1:42:33] better venue on this side of eternity,
[1:42:35] brothers and sisters. And I know some
[1:42:37] people will say, "Well, you don't know
[1:42:38] what my church was like where I come
[1:42:40] from.
[1:42:42] Who cares?"
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; You're here now.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; So, what about now? What about today?
[1:42:49] Today is the Jubilee trumpet.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Now, the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:42:59] the spirit of the Lord is, there is
[1:43:00] liberty.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; And you know, either there is liberty or
[1:43:05] there isn't liberty.
[1:43:08] And I want to encourage us to look at it
[1:43:09] that way.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Because some might say, "Well, I've only
[1:43:12] got a little bit of liberty. I can only
[1:43:13] have this much liberty." And some people
[1:43:15] have other liberty. You know what?
[1:43:17] There's no culture in the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; And I think we do a real disservice
[1:43:22] to what we believe when we say that my
[1:43:25] culture has preeminence over the spirit
[1:43:27] of God in me.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; As soon as we do that, I believe we take
[1:43:31] away the power of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:43:34] lives.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; And you know what? In fact, I don't
[1:43:38] think we take away the power. I think we
[1:43:40] just push it aside.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And as long as we do that, then there
[1:43:44] isn't going to be liberty. there's going
[1:43:46] to be bondage because it either is or it
[1:43:49] isn't. The spirit of God either is that
[1:43:52] spirit where the spirit of the Lord is.
[1:43:54] There is liberty, there is freedom,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; or there isn't. And I know it's not for
[1:43:59] everyone.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; In every church, there's three types of
[1:44:03] believers, Brother Brandham said. And
[1:44:05] that's just the way it is.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; We can't make anyone anything.
[1:44:10] I would say this, the spirit of the Lord
[1:44:12] demonstrates
[1:44:16] The next verse 18 it says, "But we all
[1:44:19] with open face beholding as in a glass
[1:44:23] the glory of the Lord."
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; And I I would say this because my my
[1:44:29] Bible says it in a glass in a mirror.
[1:44:33] But we all with open face beholding as
[1:44:37] in a mirror
[1:44:39] the glory of the Lord. Wait a second.
[1:44:44] How does that work?
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; You mean to say that we can actually
[1:44:49] look in a mirror
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; and what do we see?
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; We see the glory of the Lord.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; But you know that's where there's
[1:44:59] liberty.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Where there's bondage, we don't see the
[1:45:03] glory of the Lord. We see this veil.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; We're stuck looking at the veil. But
[1:45:09] what we're trying to say today is the
[1:45:11] gentile church does not have that
[1:45:13] blindness.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; We have the glorious liberty of that
[1:45:17] veil being taken off of us.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; You know where this veil discussion
[1:45:22] started was with Moses when he went up
[1:45:24] on the mountain, isn't it?
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; He went up on the mountain the first
[1:45:27] time. Remember he did it twice.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; God called him up and he went up the
[1:45:32] first time and told everyone just wait
[1:45:34] here until I come back.
[1:45:38] just wait. I mean, no, there was no text
[1:45:40] messages. There was no emails, there was
[1:45:42] no fax machines, there was no none of
[1:45:45] that. Take my words.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Stay here and wait until I return.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; But we know that he went up on the
[1:45:53] mountain and and he said that he he
[1:45:56] truly feared
[1:45:58] and and he was afraid of it, but he went
[1:46:01] cuz God called him.
[1:46:04] But while he was up there, what
[1:46:05] happened? God tried talking to him and
[1:46:07] then he said, "You know what? Get back
[1:46:10] down there to those people. Those people
[1:46:13] are just out of it. The rebellious
[1:46:16] people and they're misbehaving."
[1:46:18] And we went we Moses, he went back down
[1:46:22] off the mountain and what did he find?
[1:46:25] Lentious party.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; They're going crazy. And and what did
[1:46:30] they say? Everyone quick. Moses must be
[1:46:34] lost. He's gone because he didn't come
[1:46:36] in the time that we thought he should
[1:46:38] come.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; So, we better take matters into our own
[1:46:42] hands then
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; because God, you know, he's just maybe
[1:46:45] not doing it the way that we think he
[1:46:47] should. It's not as fast as we think it
[1:46:49] should be. So, we better do something
[1:46:50] about it. What they say, everyone off
[1:46:52] with your golden earrings that we got
[1:46:54] from the the Egyptians. Let's make a
[1:46:57] pile of gold. And what we'll do is, hey,
[1:47:00] let's make some golden calves.
[1:47:03] That was a comfortable place to worship,
[1:47:05] wasn't it? Back in the land of Egypt, we
[1:47:08] love to worship those calves. We had
[1:47:10] such wonderful times, tremendous
[1:47:12] services.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; So, let's make some golden calves. Won't
[1:47:15] it be fun? Isn't that what they did?
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And you know what shocks me with that
[1:47:20] story is that it wasn't just the
[1:47:22] children of Israel on mass and maybe
[1:47:24] some random leaders. Aaron,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Aaron was right in there.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:31] saying, "Wow, I think that sounds good."
[1:47:34] You know, brothers and sisters, if we
[1:47:35] think that we can exist in this world
[1:47:37] according to the word of God for the day
[1:47:39] in which we live without the voice of a
[1:47:41] vindicated prophet, we are so sadly
[1:47:44] mistaken.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; We will be exactly like the children of
[1:47:48] Israel, thinking that we're worshiping
[1:47:50] God. And we're not going to be
[1:47:52] worshiping God.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; But we don't have that veil.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; My
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; I just love how the Lord does things.
[1:48:06] Don't you?
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; But we all with open face beholding as
[1:48:13] in a mirror the glory of the Lord.
[1:48:15] Because that's what we see when we
[1:48:17] recognize there's liberty in this word,
[1:48:20] in the word for our day, the message of
[1:48:21] the hour, the true baptism of the Holy
[1:48:24] Ghost. coming back to the center of the
[1:48:26] road. That's what the prophet was sent
[1:48:28] for. We know that. But when we do that,
[1:48:30] when we follow the instructions given to
[1:48:33] us in the day in which we live, we all
[1:48:36] with open face beholding as in a mirror
[1:48:40] the glory of the Lord.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Are changed into the same image from
[1:48:47] glory to glory. Amen.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Even as by the spirit of the Lord
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; because the Lord is that spirit. And
[1:48:55] where the spirit of the Lord is, there's
[1:48:56] liberty. Brothers and sisters, we don't
[1:48:57] have to look at this old flesh. Don't
[1:48:58] look at the old man. Don't look at the
[1:49:00] old woman. Don't look at the old
[1:49:03] brother. Don't look at the old sister.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the old man. The the old
[1:49:07] man has to die.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; The word says to know no man after the
[1:49:11] flesh, doesn't it? Amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; When we can look when we can look into
[1:49:16] the glass and see the glory of the Lord,
[1:49:20] I think that's just so tremendous. And
[1:49:22] we know we can say that that glass is
[1:49:24] actually the word of God.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; We ought to see ourselves reflecting
[1:49:27] back out of there. Better yet, see him
[1:49:31] reflecting back out of there.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; But to be able to recognize that's his
[1:49:34] program. That's what he wants. He wants
[1:49:36] us to be able to look open face
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; as in a glass. The glory of the Lord.
[1:49:44] Why?
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Remember, our character isn't going to
[1:49:48] be changed because of the rapture.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Our character is getting changed right
[1:49:52] now.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Right here and right now.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Death isn't going to change who we are.
[1:49:59] Death is only going to change our
[1:50:01] dwelling place.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Where we're living. That's all that's
[1:50:06] going to happen. And we know that rich
[1:50:07] young ruler found that out. Maybe he
[1:50:09] thought one day, well, I'll take my
[1:50:11] chances with all of my investments. Like
[1:50:12] we talked about in the young peoples.
[1:50:14] I'm just going to take my chance with
[1:50:16] all of my investments. Everything that
[1:50:17] I've got, I did it godly. Everything is
[1:50:19] going to be fine. I'm going to take my
[1:50:20] chances. We know that he lifted up his
[1:50:22] eyes in hell. And we talked about it on
[1:50:24] Friday. We just sort of built on what
[1:50:26] brother Emanuel was talking about. I
[1:50:27] think it's such a powerful powerful
[1:50:29] illustration. Even in that position, he
[1:50:32] said, "Just go do." He was trying to
[1:50:34] bark orders and and he said to Abraham,
[1:50:36] you know, if I can't go back and help
[1:50:38] them, if you're not going to go back and
[1:50:39] help them, can you just send someone
[1:50:42] send send someone to go and tell my
[1:50:44] brothers?
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; And he said, you know what? If they
[1:50:47] won't hear a prophet, they're not going
[1:50:48] to listen to a dead man.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; That's a stubborn human nature, ain't
[1:50:53] it?
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Humans are stubborn inherently.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:00] We know the word says that they're stiff
[1:51:01] necked and uncircumcised
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; of heart and mind.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Some people might say, "Well, I could
[1:51:09] fit that description." You know what?
[1:51:11] It's not about the natural body.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; It's about the heart and the mind.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Is our heart right? Are we willing to
[1:51:19] say, "Circumcise my heart, Lord.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Take out all of me and fill me with
[1:51:25] you." Amen.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Out of an exposition of the seven church
[1:51:30] ages,
[1:51:32] brother Brandham, he says this here.
[1:51:36] For it is written,
[1:51:38] and I don't know if I sent this. If I
[1:51:40] didn't, forgive me. For it is written,
[1:51:43] cursed is everyone that hangeth on a
[1:51:46] tree.
[1:51:48] It's out of the revelation of Jesus
[1:51:50] Christ. Cursed is everyone that hangeth
[1:51:54] on a tree.
[1:51:55] that the blessing of Abraham
[1:51:58] might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[1:52:01] Christ,
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; that we might receive the promise of the
[1:52:06] spirit through faith.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; The blessing of Abraham came through the
[1:52:15] cross to the Gentiles.
[1:52:19] The Jews rejected the cross.
[1:52:24] Therefore, Jesus got the gentile bride.
[1:52:29] The Jews full-on rejected the cross.
[1:52:32] Now, we're going to talk a little bit
[1:52:33] about that as we go forwards. Why were
[1:52:35] they blinded?
[1:52:37] Why were they blinded? We know we have
[1:52:39] to always go back to the original
[1:52:42] prophecy and we read that this morning
[1:52:44] out of Genesis chapter 48, I believe it
[1:52:47] was. There was a prophecy that went
[1:52:49] forward and that prophecy is still in
[1:52:51] force today until this gentile bride is
[1:52:54] taken out of the way. That prophecy is
[1:52:56] still in force until he goes back and
[1:52:59] reveals himself to the Jews, the 144
[1:53:02] Jews. That prophecy is still, we can't
[1:53:05] stop prophecy. It's going to happen.
[1:53:09] But why are the eyes of Israel closed?
[1:53:12] The easy answer is they chose a murderer
[1:53:16] instead of a messiah.
[1:53:18] Why did they do that? Here's the tricky
[1:53:21] part, brothers and sisters. Because he
[1:53:24] didn't come the way that he thought that
[1:53:28] they should. They thought he should.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; He came the way the word said he would.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:53:40] forever. Amen.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; The whole world has the pictures painted
[1:53:45] that there's going to be this great
[1:53:46] cataclysmic thing when the Lord comes
[1:53:49] the second time to take his bride home.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; He's no different.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; He's no different. He's going to come
[1:53:59] exactly according to the word. And I'll
[1:54:00] say this, he did.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; He did come exactly according to the
[1:54:06] word. Some people can see it and some
[1:54:08] people can't. Many people can't. That's
[1:54:10] not up to us.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Alls we can do is just press on and say,
[1:54:15] "Hey, something happened in 1963."
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; And it was a lot more than just the the
[1:54:21] cloud that we see in the picture that
[1:54:23] maybe we have pins about. It was way
[1:54:25] more than even just the opening of the
[1:54:28] seals according to the word, the
[1:54:30] revealing of the word.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; It was way more than that because it
[1:54:33] took way more than just those actions,
[1:54:36] those things that we can perceive
[1:54:37] naturally
[1:54:40] It took something way more
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; for all of that to happen
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; because a man couldn't open the seals.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; We know the story. We can go back there
[1:54:50] and talk about Revelations chapter 3 and
[1:54:53] two and three and the instruction to the
[1:54:55] churches and how they're told, you know,
[1:54:57] he that hath an ear, let him hear what
[1:54:58] the spirit saith unto the church. And I
[1:55:01] know every single church age was given a
[1:55:03] promise. They were given a a a
[1:55:06] correction. What I see wrong with you.
[1:55:08] and they were given the promise the the
[1:55:10] the the thing that they the promise for
[1:55:14] their age. But then when you get to
[1:55:16] Revelation chapter 4, John being a type
[1:55:18] of the bride, he saw a door open in
[1:55:20] heaven.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; We know that he was already in the
[1:55:22] spirit in the Lord's day when all this
[1:55:24] happened. But what happened? He heard a
[1:55:27] voice say, "Come higher, John."
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; And we know that's what happened. He
[1:55:32] went higher. Immediately I was in the
[1:55:35] spirit and and and I saw one,
[1:55:39] not two or three seated on the throne. I
[1:55:42] saw one. We know the story, right?
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; We got a glimpse into that in the age in
[1:55:48] which we live. We got a glimpse into
[1:55:50] that through this prophetic utterance in
[1:55:52] the day in which we live. This seventh
[1:55:55] angel messenger wasn't John, wasn't
[1:55:57] Jesus, wasn't God. It was a prophet of
[1:56:00] God that introduced us to the revealing
[1:56:02] of God. Because we know that while he
[1:56:05] stood there and went through the first
[1:56:07] and second pulls of his ministry, he was
[1:56:10] able to declare this is the appearing.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; This is the appearing. The appearing of
[1:56:16] what?
[1:56:18] I think it's an interesting discussion.
[1:56:21] What's it the appearing of? I'll say the
[1:56:24] the word coming of the Lord. Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Because we know that when Abraham and
[1:56:28] Sarah were on the plains of Mamry,
[1:56:32] they were there doing their thing,
[1:56:34] believing.
[1:56:35] And we know we talked about them on
[1:56:37] Wednesday and uh how there was a promise
[1:56:41] and they were holding fast to that
[1:56:43] promise. At least Abraham was.
[1:56:46] Sarah was kind of unsure about it, but
[1:56:49] there was three that came to their tent
[1:56:50] that day. And we know that Abraham
[1:56:52] recognized one,
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:56] And who was that one?
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; It was Elohim.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; That's who he recognized.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; And that promise came to him that day.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; God himself brought that promise. He
[1:57:11] didn't send a messenger. He sent the
[1:57:13] messengers down to Sodom, didn't he?
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; And we know that one who was the prophet
[1:57:18] in our day. He said, "There's messengers
[1:57:20] down to Sodom in our day. Two angelic
[1:57:23] messengers. powerful ministries. And
[1:57:27] what did those angels do in Sodom? They
[1:57:29] actually preached the word
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; and it preached them blind.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Same thing in our day.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Oral Roberts,
[1:57:41] Billy Graham,
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; both of them having tremendous
[1:57:44] ministries.
[1:57:46] And I had the the the luxury, the
[1:57:49] blessing of actually going to the the
[1:57:51] Billy Graham Museum Library it's called
[1:57:53] in in Charlotte, North Carolina. It's a
[1:57:55] tremendous monument to this I'll say
[1:57:58] angel minister
[1:58:01] down to Sodom. If you see the way that
[1:58:03] thing is set up and what the people have
[1:58:05] done through it, it's magnificent.
[1:58:09] And if you think about what they did
[1:58:11] with William Mary and Brham and so on
[1:58:14] and so forth, I I [clears throat] think
[1:58:16] it's magnificent
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; because they never exalted the man.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; They exalted the word.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; They did exactly what God wanted
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; to make sure that it was put in a
[1:58:29] position where nobody in this age will
[1:58:32] have an excuse.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Everybody has access to the message if
[1:58:37] they want it, if they hear about it.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Nobody. It's not exclusive to anybody.
[1:58:43] But yeah, why are the eyes of the
[1:58:45] children of Israel closed? Is because
[1:58:47] they chose a murderer instead.
[1:58:51] A murderer instead of a savior.
[1:58:54] My
[1:58:58] I believe it's out of Mark chapter 15.
[1:59:01] Let's turn over there. Mark chapter 15.
[1:59:04] We'll just read it today.
[1:59:16] I think it's really important to see the
[1:59:18] scriptural identification when there's a
[1:59:20] question like this. Why something is the
[1:59:23] way it is? Remember um our question is
[1:59:27] why
[1:59:29] are they blinded?
[1:59:31] Why are the eyes of Israel closed?
[1:59:36] Verse
[1:59:38] 15, actually chapter 15,
[1:59:47] sorry,
[1:59:49] chapter 15, verse one.
[1:59:53] And straightway in the morning, the
[1:59:55] chief priests held a consultation with
[1:59:58] the elders and scribes. And the whole
[2:00:00] council
[2:00:02] and bound Jesus and carried him away and
[2:00:05] delivered him to Pilate.
[2:00:08] Pilate asked him, "Art thou the king of
[2:00:12] the Jews?"
[2:00:15] And he answering said unto him,
[2:00:19] "Thou sayest it."
[2:00:22] You got it.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; And the chief priests accused him of
[2:00:28] many things, but he answered nothing.
[2:00:32] And Pilate asked him again, saying,
[2:00:34] Answerest thou nothing. Behold, how many
[2:00:38] things they witness against thee. Now I
[2:00:40] think when we read this we have to
[2:00:42] remember that Pilate was really really
[2:00:44] uneasy in this moment
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; because his wife the closest one to him
[2:00:49] came and told him don't do anything with
[2:00:51] this guy
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; he's an innocent man leave him alone
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Pilate is not going to have excuse on
[2:00:58] that day
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; verse five
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; but Jesus an yet answered nothing so
[2:01:07] that Pilate marveled
[2:01:10] Now at that feast he released unto them
[2:01:13] one prisoner whomsoever they desired.
[2:01:19] It's interesting to see how this whole
[2:01:21] story plays out because they desired
[2:01:23] someone. They they chose someone. Verse
[2:01:26] seven. And there was one named Barabus,
[2:01:30] which lay bound with them that had made
[2:01:33] insurrection with him, who had committed
[2:01:36] murder in the insurrection.
[2:01:41] And the multitude crying aloud, began to
[2:01:45] desire him to do as he had ever done
[2:01:49] unto them.
[2:01:51] But Pilate answered them, saying, "Will
[2:01:54] ye that I release unto you the king of
[2:01:58] the Jews?"
[2:02:00] For he knew that the chief priests had
[2:02:03] delivered him for envy.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; But the chief priests moved the people
[2:02:11] that if he should rather release Barabus
[2:02:14] unto them.
[2:02:16] And Pilate answered and said unto them
[2:02:18] again, "What will ye then that I shall
[2:02:21] do unto him who ye call the king of the
[2:02:25] Jews?"
[2:02:27] Now, he was really working them hard
[2:02:29] when he was saying this because they
[2:02:31] didn't call him the king of the Jews.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; But he called him the king of the Jews
[2:02:36] to them because he knew they didn't like
[2:02:38] it.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; But he recognized who he was.
[2:02:43] And they cried out again, "Crucify him!"
[2:02:48] Then Pilate said unto them, "What what
[2:02:51] evil hath he done?" And they cried out,
[2:02:54] "The more exceedingly, crucify him."
[2:03:01] And so Pilate willing to con contend
[2:03:04] with the people
[2:03:06] released Barabus unto them and delivered
[2:03:10] Jesus when he had scourged him to be
[2:03:13] crucified.
[2:03:15] And the soldiers led him away into the
[2:03:18] hall
[2:03:20] called Ptorium.
[2:03:22] And they called together the whole band.
[2:03:26] And they clothed with him purple and
[2:03:27] plated a crown of thorns and put it
[2:03:29] about his head.
[2:03:32] And we know the rest of the story.
[2:03:37] For time's sake, I'm not going to read
[2:03:40] it,
[2:03:43] but we know they took him and crucified
[2:03:45] him after they completely mistreated
[2:03:48] him.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:03:50] And the children of Israel, the Jews, in
[2:03:53] that moment while they were crying out,
[2:03:56] they said it in one of the other
[2:03:57] gospels, "Let his blood be upon us and
[2:04:02] our children."
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine that as a parent?
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; I can't imagine that as a parent to have
[2:04:10] anybody here that would say, "Let
[2:04:11] anybody's blood be upon me and my
[2:04:14] children.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; My children don't have anything to do
[2:04:17] with it. Help us.
[2:04:20] But yet that's the way they were.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; That's how blinded they were.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; These people weren't becoming blind.
[2:04:28] They already were blind.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; And remember that same spirit that found
[2:04:33] its way at the base of the cross and
[2:04:35] said, "You just come down off there and
[2:04:37] then we'll believe you that you're that
[2:04:38] prophet.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Do us a sign. Show us a work." Right?
[2:04:44] Those spirits are still alive. Brother
[2:04:46] Brandham, he talked about it. That man
[2:04:48] saying,
[2:04:49] wasn't it best might be blind.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Do work for me.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; And he said, "How can I do that when you
[2:04:57] already are?"
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about natural eyesight
[2:05:01] here.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; But that's the way the devil works. He
[2:05:04] likes to get us all caught up in the
[2:05:06] natural things, right?
[2:05:14] You know, there's a another scripture
[2:05:15] I'd like to read, and I can see that
[2:05:17] we're running out of time here, but
[2:05:18] that's okay. We'll just continue on with
[2:05:20] this. Let's turn over to Matthew 27.
[2:05:24] Why are they blinded? Why can't they
[2:05:27] see?
[2:05:33] You'll notice today that I'm not taking
[2:05:34] a lot of quotes. Brother Bradom has a
[2:05:36] lot to say about it, but I'm taking the
[2:05:38] Bible. I just want to bring it from the
[2:05:40] Bible first. Let's talk about what the
[2:05:42] word says about this. Matthew chapter
[2:05:45] 27.
[2:05:52] We can read it from there too. When the
[2:05:54] morning was come, all the chief priests
[2:05:56] and the elders and the people took
[2:05:57] counsel against Jesus to put him to
[2:05:59] death. When they had bound him, they led
[2:06:02] him away and delivered him under Pontius
[2:06:03] Pilate the governor. Then Judas which
[2:06:06] had betrayed him when he saw that he was
[2:06:10] condemned repented.
[2:06:14] Can you imagine that? The son of
[2:06:15] predition repented.
[2:06:18] He repented himself and brought again
[2:06:21] the 30 pieces of silver to the chief
[2:06:24] priests and the elders saying, "I have
[2:06:27] sinned and that I have betrayed the
[2:06:29] innocent blood." And they said, "What is
[2:06:32] that to us? See thou to that.
[2:06:36] And he cast down the pieces of silver in
[2:06:38] the temple and departed and went and
[2:06:41] hanged himself.
[2:06:44] The chief priest took the silver pieces
[2:06:47] and said, "It's not lawful for to put
[2:06:50] them in the treasury because it is the
[2:06:52] price of blood."
[2:06:56] And they took counsel
[2:06:59] and with them and bought with them the
[2:07:01] potter's field to bury strangers in.
[2:07:05] I can see we're going to wind up ending
[2:07:07] right here at this point. Verse 8 says,
[2:07:10] "Wherefore that field was called the
[2:07:14] field of blood unto this day." Verse 9
[2:07:19] says, "Then was fulfilled that which was
[2:07:21] spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
[2:07:24] and they took the 30 pieces of silver,
[2:07:27] the price of him that was valued,
[2:07:32] whom they of the children of Israel did
[2:07:34] value,
[2:07:35] and gave them for the potter's field as
[2:07:39] the Lord appointed me." And you know
[2:07:43] that potter's field for those people who
[2:07:45] have gone to the land of Israel they
[2:07:48] know that that's actually a place even
[2:07:50] today that potter's field is a place
[2:07:53] that you can visit. And every single
[2:07:55] place I believe I understand I've never
[2:07:57] been but one day Lord willing would love
[2:07:59] to go. I understand that every single
[2:08:02] place where there is reference in the
[2:08:04] Bible they have erected a a church and
[2:08:08] in this case it's a monastery
[2:08:11] and it's a keelma monastery in Jerusalem
[2:08:15] is the field of blood where he cast the
[2:08:19] silver where where they bought the
[2:08:21] actual land. This is actually where it
[2:08:24] took place and and I I just looked into
[2:08:26] this a little bit. I thought it was so
[2:08:28] interesting. I I just find this
[2:08:30] fascinating to think that someone can
[2:08:33] actually be blinded while the other one
[2:08:35] can actually see it.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; How we can actually see spiritual things
[2:08:41] and and some others they can't. They
[2:08:43] just can't see anything spiritual. It's
[2:08:45] all natural.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; And how it can become so confusing
[2:08:48] between one and the other as a believer
[2:08:51] in our lives. And that's why brothers
[2:08:53] and sisters, we're not waging, we're not
[2:08:55] in a war that's being waged against this
[2:08:57] flesh and blood. But that's how the
[2:08:58] devil does it. He likes to get us mixed
[2:09:00] up thinking, "Well, it's natural. Well,
[2:09:02] it's spiritual." Remember, the word says
[2:09:04] that we're not wrestling against flesh
[2:09:05] and blood. It's principalities and
[2:09:08] powers and rulers over darkness and
[2:09:11] spiritual wickedness and high places.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; I better call the musicians or I'm going
[2:09:18] to keep going. I'm about halfway through
[2:09:20] the notes that I have today. That's why
[2:09:22] I I just want to maybe be mindful.
[2:09:29] But in Jeremiah chapter 32,
[2:09:34] if you if you think about the story of
[2:09:37] Jeremiah
[2:09:38] and how in those days
[2:09:41] he was a prophet, when did he become a
[2:09:44] prophet?
[2:09:46] From his mother's womb.
[2:09:49] He didn't just become anointed one day
[2:09:51] to become a prophet. Prophets come from
[2:09:54] the mother's womb.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; And this man Jeremiah, he was told,
[2:09:59] "You're not going to have a family.
[2:10:01] You're not going to have a wife. You're
[2:10:03] not going to do anything that you think
[2:10:04] you're going to do in your life. You're
[2:10:06] going to follow me. And you're going to
[2:10:07] speak the words that I put in your
[2:10:09] mouth." And that's exactly what's going
[2:10:12] to happen with you, Jeremiah. Can you
[2:10:14] imagine that? That life would be just so
[2:10:16] difficult to get past. But I think if
[2:10:18] you are in that position, it's probably
[2:10:20] going to be easy, easier. Anyways, I
[2:10:24] would never say that the life of
[2:10:25] Jeremiah was easy. He was he he he was
[2:10:28] in a really rough spot. But in the midst
[2:10:31] of all of that he was doing, the the
[2:10:34] prophetic utterance that God brought
[2:10:36] through this man Jeremiah to the people
[2:10:38] of Israel, if you don't repent,
[2:10:42] God is not going to come and destroy
[2:10:43] you. The armies of the king of the north
[2:10:47] are coming down as a sething pot. And
[2:10:50] they will absolutely destroy you. They
[2:10:53] won't have pity on mama, on grandma, on
[2:10:56] grandpa, on babies, aunts, uncles,
[2:11:00] brothers, sisters. Nobody will be spared
[2:11:03] if you don't listen to this prophetic
[2:11:05] utterance. And what did they do? They
[2:11:06] said, "No, we like our religion better.
[2:11:09] We like our our behavior. We like that
[2:11:12] we just have a little bit of liberty and
[2:11:14] not much liberty. We just like it the
[2:11:15] way it is. We don't want to change
[2:11:17] things.
[2:11:19] They didn't want to listen to what
[2:11:20] Jeremiah had to say because they thought
[2:11:23] that it was just Jeremiah.
[2:11:25] They didn't realize that it was actually
[2:11:27] God through him.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; But even in the midst of all of that,
[2:11:33] while he was being mistreated, he was
[2:11:35] being led by God to bring the prophecy.
[2:11:37] And we know the king of of the north,
[2:11:40] Nebuchadnezzar, had already come down
[2:11:42] and had the city under siege.
[2:11:45] Those prophetic words were coming to
[2:11:47] pass and they still had so much pride in
[2:11:49] their lives. They couldn't let go. And
[2:11:53] he said to them, "If you would just just
[2:11:55] go and surrender yourself now, you would
[2:11:58] live. You'll be a slave for the rest of
[2:12:01] your life, but you'll at least live."
[2:12:03] Couldn't do it. No way. They had way too
[2:12:06] much pride. And I think about it because
[2:12:09] it wasn't necessarily the people of the
[2:12:11] city either. It was the leadership that
[2:12:13] did that. The leadership forced the
[2:12:16] people into those positions.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; The city being under siege where they
[2:12:20] would eat one another's children because
[2:12:22] there was no more food. What a terrible
[2:12:25] place to be if they would just have
[2:12:27] listened to the vindicated prophet in
[2:12:28] their day, the voice of the prophet, the
[2:12:31] prophetic utterance. But they couldn't
[2:12:32] do it. They were happy with the way
[2:12:34] things were. They chose that just like
[2:12:36] the children of Israel chose a murderer.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Remember, we choose.
[2:12:43] And we know the word of God says to
[2:12:45] choose ye this day whom ye will serve.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Every single day is a choice for us.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; We can choose to follow the word.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; We can choose to just repent from our
[2:12:57] ways and correct oursel and go. We're
[2:12:59] we're able to do it on our GPS when we
[2:13:02] just get a little bit off track. We can
[2:13:03] just hit recalibrate
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; reccalibrate
[2:13:08] a and it will say calculating and it
[2:13:10] might take a minute or so and then we'll
[2:13:12] actually have our route planned out
[2:13:13] again. That's all we need to do in the
[2:13:15] day in which we live with this word is
[2:13:17] come to church, close our eyes, open our
[2:13:20] hearts and our our our voice and just
[2:13:24] say Lord let me recalibrate unto you.
[2:13:26] Amen.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; But Jeremiah 32:14, maybe stand with me
[2:13:32] as we close. It says in even in the
[2:13:35] midst of all of his trial, while they're
[2:13:37] under siege, we have this taking place,
[2:13:40] brothers and sisters. This is a very
[2:13:42] significant transaction that I'm going
[2:13:44] to read here. Jeremiah 32, thus saith
[2:13:47] the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,
[2:13:49] take these evidences, this evidence of
[2:13:52] the purchase, both which is sealed, and
[2:13:57] this evidence which is opened, and put
[2:13:59] them in an put them in an earthn vessel,
[2:14:03] that they may continue many days.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. To think about the scriptural
[2:14:10] connotation of [music] these words. For
[2:14:13] thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of
[2:14:15] Israel, houses and fields and vineyards
[2:14:19] shall be possessed again in this land.
[2:14:24] In the midst of all of this,
[2:14:28] Jeremiah
[2:14:29] has a transaction conducted
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; where money is exchanged
[2:14:35] for a piece of land,
[2:14:38] a very specific piece of land.
[2:14:41] Zechariah 11 verse 12. And I said unto
[2:14:45] them, if you think good, give me my
[2:14:47] price, and if not, for bear. So they
[2:14:50] weighed for my price.
[2:14:53] What?
[2:14:55] 30 pieces of silver.
[2:14:58] Zachchariah.
[2:15:01] 30 pieces of silver. And the Lord said
[2:15:03] unto me, cast it into the potter.
[2:15:06] a goodly price that I was priced at of
[2:15:10] them. And I took the 30 pieces of silver
[2:15:13] and cast them to the potter in the house
[2:15:15] of the Lord.
[2:15:18] Why are the Jews blinded?
[2:15:23] They're blinded for our sake.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; They're blinded because of prophecy.
[2:15:29] Because of prophecy for our sake. so
[2:15:31] that we would have the spirit of the
[2:15:33] Lord turn from the Jews through the
[2:15:35] prophet age messenger, the Ephesian
[2:15:38] church age messenger, Paul, so that he
[2:15:40] could set the example for all future
[2:15:43] church ages in the Gentile church.
[2:15:45] Remember when we talk about the church
[2:15:46] ages, they're not to the Jews.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; They're all to the Gentiles.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Every single church age. But there will
[2:15:54] be a turning any day now back to the
[2:15:56] Jews. And it just behooves us to
[2:15:59] recognize that we have been given a
[2:16:01] liberty that's beyond even what we
[2:16:03] understand
[2:16:04] because it's prophecy.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. Let's just
[2:16:08] bow in prayer.
[2:16:10] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[2:16:12] your word. We thank you, Lord, that we
[2:16:14] could gather together in your name,
[2:16:16] Lord, that we could hear a question that
[2:16:19] was asked in the heart of one of your
[2:16:21] children, Lord, to to wonder why the
[2:16:25] Jews are blinded.
[2:16:28] Father, we know that we could say it's
[2:16:30] because they chose a murderer
[2:16:33] over the Messiah,
[2:16:35] over you, Lord.
[2:16:37] But they did that because there was a
[2:16:40] prophecy that was still in force.
[2:16:43] And Father, we know that that prophecy
[2:16:45] even today is still in force. And that
[2:16:48] prophecy was there so that we could be
[2:16:50] the one, the recipient, the younger one.
[2:16:52] Oh, Father, when the hands were crossed
[2:16:54] back in Egypt, it was for me.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Father, I thank you for your word. Thank
[2:16:59] you for the prophecy, Lord. Thank you
[2:17:01] for the revelation in the day in which
[2:17:03] we live.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you that the eyes of the Jews were
[2:17:06] blinded for our sake, Lord.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, they're not our enemies.
[2:17:11] They're our brothers.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to pray for
[2:17:14] those families who were hurting today,
[2:17:16] that were attacked in Australia. What a
[2:17:19] terrible thing, Father. For all those
[2:17:21] people in the land of Israel that
[2:17:23] wonder, is there a Messiah? Oh, Father,
[2:17:28] help us, Lord, not to misplace our trust
[2:17:32] in this message of the hour. Help us not
[2:17:35] to be careless and reckless, Father,
[2:17:37] with this great treasure that we've been
[2:17:39] given, oh Lord, to recognize that
[2:17:42] people's lives have seemingly been
[2:17:45] destroyed so that we can have this word.
[2:17:50] How great is salvation you've given us
[2:17:52] Lord. Father we love you today and we
[2:17:54] thank you for your grace. We thank you
[2:17:58] for your election, your predestination,
[2:18:00] your fornowledge. We thank you Lord
[2:18:02] Jesus that you have given us free will
[2:18:04] that we can surrender that to you every
[2:18:06] day of our lives that you could live
[2:18:08] through us Lord. Help us to recognize
[2:18:11] the the treasure the pearl of great
[2:18:13] price that you've given us Lord. And
[2:18:16] father, as we go forwards, we pray that
[2:18:18] you would keep your hand upon us. As we
[2:18:19] go our separate ways, be with those who
[2:18:22] couldn't come today, wherever they are.
[2:18:24] We pray that you would just bless them
[2:18:26] abundantly as well, Father. And Lord, we
[2:18:29] just ask that if our eyes are blinded to
[2:18:31] this word today, that you would open
[2:18:33] them in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Father, that there wouldn't be one
[2:18:37] person here that would miss that great
[2:18:39] day when you decide to take your bride
[2:18:41] home.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; That every single one of us would be
[2:18:44] there. Yes, Lord.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you. We
[2:18:47] just commit all that was spoken today
[2:18:49] into your hands for your glory. In Jesus
[2:18:52] Christ's name we pray.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:56] Amen. Can we sing 919? There's a
[2:19:00] fountain open.
