[0:00] Oh, let me walk. Blessed Lord, give the
[0:04] way thou hast gone. Leading straight to
[0:08] the land of love,
[0:12] giving cheer everywhere to the sand and
[0:18] fill my way every day with love.
[0:23] Oh, fill my way every day with love.
[0:29] As I walk with heaven,
[0:35] let me go all the while with a song and
[0:40] a smile. Fill my way in every day with
[0:45] love.
[0:47] Keep me close to the side of my savior
[0:52] guide. Let me never in darkness.
[0:58] Keep my path
[1:01] that my soul satisfied. Fill my way
[1:05] every day with love.

[1:16] with the heavenly.

[1:36] tell the Lord. What am I in my home?
[1:41] Hallelujah.
[1:43] Let me sing. Bless the King all the way
[1:48] to the shore. Feel my way every day.
[1:55] Feel my way every day.
