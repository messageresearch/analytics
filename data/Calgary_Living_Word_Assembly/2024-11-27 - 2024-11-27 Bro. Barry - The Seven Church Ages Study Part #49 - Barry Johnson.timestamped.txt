[58:11] chapter
[58:18] 3 Revelations chapter
[58:22] 3:1 and unto the angel of the church in
[58:25] Sardis is right these things saith he
[58:28] that hath the seven spirits of God and
[58:31] the Seven
[58:32] Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a
[58:37] name that thou livest and art
[58:40] dead Be watchful and strengthen the
[58:43] things which remain that are ready to
[58:45] die for I have not found thy works
[58:49] perfect before God remember therefore
[58:53] how thou Hast received and heard and
[58:56] hold fast and
[58:58] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[59:02] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[59:04] shalt not know what hour I will come
[59:07] upon thee thou Hast a few names even in
[59:10] Sardis which have not defiled their
[59:13] garments and they shall walk with me in
[59:15] white for they are worthy he that
[59:18] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[59:20] white rment and I will not blot out his
[59:24] name out of The Book of Life life but I
[59:27] will confess his name before my father

[1:01:03] in our our study of the exposition of
[1:01:05] the seven Church ages I'm just really
[1:01:07] enjoying this section on Election
[1:01:11] understanding that it pertains to us uh
[1:01:13] there's a lot of people that it pertains
[1:01:14] to but uh I believe when we understand
[1:01:17] that we're truly elect it really means
[1:01:20] something when we can hear it um spelled
[1:01:22] out this way I'll just get right into it
[1:01:26] we have uh 40 minutes is and that's just
[1:01:30] fine for the record I want you to know
[1:01:32] that I enjoy the specials and I don't
[1:01:34] get fussed I'm not excited I'm not
[1:01:37] rushed I'm I'm not worried if the Lord
[1:01:39] wants us here for 15 minutes then that's
[1:01:41] what we'll do God bless you brother Paul
[1:01:44] it's good to see your face again he's
[1:01:46] back from Nigeria visiting his wife
[1:01:50] hopefully she can come
[1:01:52] soon paragraph 150 out of the uh sardan
[1:01:57] Church age here now let us go another
[1:02:00] step he says but before we do let us
[1:02:02] review our case thus far first of all we
[1:02:06] know most assuredly that the purpose of
[1:02:09] God stands in
[1:02:11] election it was purposed in
[1:02:14] himself I just love that it was God's
[1:02:17] purpose to bring forth a people like
[1:02:19] unto himself that would be a word
[1:02:23] bride she was chosen before the the
[1:02:26] foundation of the world in him she was
[1:02:30] forn and beloved before she was ever
[1:02:33] brought forth during the ages upon the
[1:02:36] Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and
[1:02:40] can never come into
[1:02:42] condemnation she can never be in the
[1:02:45] Judgment because sin cannot be imputed
[1:02:50] unto
[1:02:51] her
[1:02:53] wow when I when I think about this and I
[1:02:55] I read these words and I hear myself say
[1:02:58] them I think who is she I would like to
[1:03:01] meet
[1:03:02] her can you imagine meeting that one
[1:03:05] that sin won't even be able to be
[1:03:07] imputed
[1:03:09] unto wow she's a special woman that
[1:03:14] one but I can't help but think tonight
[1:03:16] brothers and sisters go home and look in
[1:03:18] the mirror don't even go home just go to
[1:03:20] the washroom and look in the mirror go
[1:03:22] and stand in front of the window and
[1:03:23] look in the glass because that's
[1:03:27] her sin can't even be imputed you won't
[1:03:31] even come to the
[1:03:36] Judgment
[1:03:40] why can never come into condemnation she
[1:03:43] can never be in the Judgment because sin
[1:03:46] cannot be imputed unto her my my my my
[1:03:51] my just think about it it's kind of like
[1:03:53] Joseph's bride hey nobody could bring an
[1:03:56] accusation to Joseph's bride not one of
[1:03:59] his Brethren not not anybody in the land
[1:04:02] could actually bring a single accusation
[1:04:05] to Joseph's wife Romans 4:8 blessed is
[1:04:09] the man to whom the Lord will not impute
[1:04:14] sin so that's I just love the way the
[1:04:17] prophet does this he always takes it
[1:04:18] back to the scripture this is not just
[1:04:21] him bringing something up saying that
[1:04:22] she will never come into the Judgment
[1:04:24] hey if if if she is the bride then then
[1:04:27] she truly is a man my blessed is the man
[1:04:32] whom the Lord will not impute sin Romans
[1:04:35] 48 he goes on to say but indeed she
[1:04:38] shall be with him in his throne of
[1:04:41] judgment judging the world and even
[1:04:43] angels her name each of her members is
[1:04:47] written in a section of the Lamb's Book
[1:04:50] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:04:53] world secondly there is another class
[1:04:57] their names are also in the book of life
[1:04:59] and they will come up in the second
[1:05:02] Resurrection such are the foolish
[1:05:04] virgins and the righteous as are spoke
[1:05:08] of in Matthew 25 in this class also are
[1:05:12] those who do not worship the Beast or
[1:05:16] become involved in the Antichrist system
[1:05:19] but die for their faith even though they
[1:05:22] are not in the bride not having been
[1:05:24] born again
[1:05:26] but they will come up in the second
[1:05:28] resurrection and go into eternal life
[1:05:32] thirdly there are the borderline
[1:05:36] Christians such as we saw in Israel
[1:05:39] coming out of Egypt these had their
[1:05:41] names in The Book of Life and their
[1:05:44] Works written in the books these having
[1:05:46] failed to obey God and being void of the
[1:05:51] spirit though even the signs and wonders
[1:05:55] were amongst them will have their names
[1:05:58] removed from The Book of
[1:06:01] Life amongst this group will be the ones
[1:06:05] like
[1:06:06] Judas who though entirely void of the
[1:06:10] spirit but are
[1:06:12] religious will have a manifestation in
[1:06:15] their
[1:06:16] lives and though on the books were not
[1:06:20] the elected in him such also as balum
[1:06:25] will in that
[1:06:28] group fourth and finally are the ones
[1:06:32] whose names have never been or will ever
[1:06:35] be written on the
[1:06:37] books such are found in Revelations
[1:06:40] 138 and Revelation 17 verse
[1:06:44] 8 I I personally believe brothers and
[1:06:47] sisters when we look at this the
[1:06:50] bride doesn't doesn't elect herself by
[1:06:55] realizing ing that there's people that
[1:06:56] will never be able to see this I believe
[1:06:59] it causes a sigh and a
[1:07:01] cry for this to think that there's
[1:07:04] people we just freely get this gift of
[1:07:07] life we just freely get this opportunity
[1:07:09] to hear what the spirit says we get to
[1:07:11] go and you know even just to be in the
[1:07:14] city just to have eternal life however
[1:07:17] that looks however that happens but to
[1:07:19] think that we're truly elected bride of
[1:07:21] Jesus Christ and then to see these other
[1:07:23] people that's why I can't help but
[1:07:25] Marvel when you hear someone talk about
[1:07:28] people being Canon
[1:07:30] fodder I know that we've all heard about
[1:07:33] it we've all heard it foolish virgin at
[1:07:35] best that kind of discussion I don't
[1:07:38] believe that's truly the elected bride
[1:07:40] speaking when we hear that if it is
[1:07:42] maybe it's an immature version of that
[1:07:45] person and I say Lord help me because I
[1:07:47] know I thought
[1:07:50] it but these people they never had a
[1:07:53] chance they were created for for one
[1:07:55] purpose just like pharaoh to be a tool
[1:07:58] in the hand of God to be
[1:08:01] destroyed my Revelations 138 and
[1:08:06] 178 and all that dwell on the Earth
[1:08:08] shall worship Him whose names are not
[1:08:10] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[1:08:12] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:08:15] and the Beast that thou sawest was and
[1:08:17] is not and shall Ascend out of the
[1:08:19] bottomless pit and go into ption and
[1:08:23] they that dwell on the Earth shall
[1:08:25] wander
[1:08:26] whose names were not written in the Book
[1:08:28] of Life from the foundation of the world
[1:08:30] yet they beheld the Beast that was and
[1:08:32] is not and yet is Jesus said that a
[1:08:37] certain group would accept one who came
[1:08:40] in his own name that one is the
[1:08:44] Antichrist so he wasn't saying that they
[1:08:47] would accept the one that came in jesus'
[1:08:49] name there except the one that came in
[1:08:50] his very own name and said look at me
[1:08:53] and and that is exactly what it said
[1:08:55] says of them in Revelations 138 and 178
[1:08:59] these were
[1:09:00] ordained of God but not unto election
[1:09:05] and with this group is such that are as
[1:09:08] Pharaoh Romans 9:17 and 22 for the
[1:09:11] scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for
[1:09:14] this same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:09:18] vessels of Wrath fitted to
[1:09:22] destruction none of these would be
[1:09:24] placed on the records of life I'm not
[1:09:26] saying that there is no record of them
[1:09:28] no doubt there is some kind of a record
[1:09:31] of them but not in the records of Life
[1:09:34] their purpose of existence has been
[1:09:37] dealt with slightly in the rest of this
[1:09:40] book but we can add two more scriptures
[1:09:43] Proverbs
[1:09:44] 16:4 the Lord hath made the wicked for
[1:09:47] the day of evil job 21:30 the wicked is
[1:09:51] reserved to the day of Destruction they
[1:09:53] shall be brought forth to the day of
[1:09:57] Wrath since this portion of the word is
[1:10:00] hard for the human mind to grasp it must
[1:10:04] be accepted and believed by
[1:10:08] faith some will be offended but what I
[1:10:11] have set forth because they fail to
[1:10:14] understand the sovereignty of God which
[1:10:17] sets forth that God is God and because
[1:10:21] he is God one cannot defeat his counsels
[1:10:25] or thwart his will and
[1:10:28] purpose and I personally believe the
[1:10:30] ones that get offended by this are
[1:10:33] potentially the ones that maybe love the
[1:10:35] Lord but just don't have the ability to
[1:10:38] hear what we
[1:10:40] hear and that's nobody's
[1:10:43] fault because of
[1:10:45] election and we need to have Grace for
[1:10:47] those people because it certainly could
[1:10:49] be an elected bride of Jesus Christ who
[1:10:52] just hasn't come to maturity yet I love
[1:10:54] how brother depicts it a little later on
[1:10:57] in this discussion he talks about the
[1:10:59] wheat plant and how you can't have the
[1:11:02] grain you can't have the truly elected
[1:11:04] seed without the plant you have to have
[1:11:08] the plant the life comes through the
[1:11:10] plant but it always starts in the
[1:11:13] seed but this is God's purpose he goes
[1:11:16] on to say but he being omnipotent is
[1:11:20] ruling in all Affairs and is doing
[1:11:22] whatever he will with all his creation
[1:11:26] because all were created for his good
[1:11:28] pleasure
[1:11:30] period therefore as Paul says if God
[1:11:33] should take one lump of clay and make of
[1:11:37] that same lump one vessel unto honor and
[1:11:40] another vessel unto dishonor who can be
[1:11:43] offended and cry against
[1:11:46] him that he has the right to do this on
[1:11:49] the grounds of creation alone we cannot
[1:11:53] deny yet he went even further for
[1:11:57] according to Romans 14: 7-9 we have the
[1:12:01] irrefutable proof that Jesus Paid the
[1:12:05] purchase price of the whole world and
[1:12:08] therefore he can do as he Wills with his
[1:12:13] own I love what brother Bram says a
[1:12:16] little later here Romans 14: 7 to9 for
[1:12:20] none of us liveth to himself and no man
[1:12:22] dieth to himself for whether we live we
[1:12:26] live unto the Lord and whether we die we
[1:12:28] die unto the Lord whether we live
[1:12:31] therefore or die we are the
[1:12:36] Lords for to this end Christ both died
[1:12:39] and Rose and revived that he might be
[1:12:43] Lord both of the dead and the
[1:12:47] living now this is what I was talking
[1:12:50] about here brother Bram says
[1:12:52] ownership not relationship is
[1:12:55] here but because of the ownership
[1:12:58] because of the Revelation that comes
[1:13:01] through that ownership for the elected
[1:13:04] there becomes a relationship a very
[1:13:06] intimate relationship that only a
[1:13:08] husband and wife can have John 172 says
[1:13:12] as thou Hast given him Power Over All
[1:13:15] Flesh that he should give eternal life
[1:13:18] to as many as thou Hast given
[1:13:22] him now if we impute omniscience to to
[1:13:25] God we must also accept that he is
[1:13:28] perfect in wisdom and
[1:13:30] righteousness this plan of election and
[1:13:34] reprobation is the wisdom of God
[1:13:36] revealed in all ages even as it says in
[1:13:40] Ephesians 1 verses
[1:13:43] 3-1 and I I just can't help but think
[1:13:45] this has to be one of my all-time
[1:13:48] favorite scriptures here he says blessed
[1:13:51] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:13:53] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[1:13:55] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:13:58] in Christ according as he hath chosen Us
[1:14:01] in him before the foundation of the
[1:14:03] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:14:05] Blame before him in
[1:14:09] love having predestinated us nobody else
[1:14:15] having predestinated us and that doesn't
[1:14:17] mean just Calgary Living Word I want to
[1:14:19] say it this way having predestinated us
[1:14:21] he that hath an ear to hear what the
[1:14:23] spirit saith to the church today having
[1:14:26] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:14:30] children by Christ Jesus to himself
[1:14:33] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:14:34] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:14:37] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:14:40] in the
[1:14:42] Beloved just made me think about it how
[1:14:44] do we know that he loves
[1:14:46] us because he said so right he his love
[1:14:51] is divine and his love for us is only in
[1:14:54] the Bel
[1:14:55] loved he says in whom we have Redemption
[1:14:58] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:15:00] sins according to the riches of his
[1:15:02] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[1:15:05] in all wisdom and
[1:15:08] Prudence he hath abounded toward us in
[1:15:12] all wisdom and Prudence having made
[1:15:14] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:15:16] not looking for the discovery of the
[1:15:19] mystery we know what his will is it's
[1:15:22] been made very clear to us through the
[1:15:23] Vindicated prophet in the age his will
[1:15:26] is his word and if we're willing to
[1:15:28] apply his word to the letter then we
[1:15:31] know his will having made known unto us
[1:15:34] the mystery of his will according to his
[1:15:36] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:15:38] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:15:40] fullness of times he might gather
[1:15:43] together in one all things in Christ
[1:15:46] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:15:48] in Earth even in him in whom also we
[1:15:52] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:15:55] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:15:57] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:16:01] counsel of his own will brothers and
[1:16:03] sisters there's no accidents there's no
[1:16:06] no mishaps there's no things that happen
[1:16:09] just incidentally everything is after
[1:16:12] the counsel of his own
[1:16:16] will thus if God was so designed has so
[1:16:21] designed that there be those whose names
[1:16:24] are placed in a section of the Lamb's
[1:16:26] Book of Life and cannot be erased for
[1:16:31] they are the names of his
[1:16:33] bride then we must accept
[1:16:37] that if it also states that there are
[1:16:40] all are if it also states that there are
[1:16:44] those whose names were placed in the
[1:16:46] record of the book of life but in the
[1:16:49] forn knowledge of God they were to fall
[1:16:52] and have their names removed we must
[1:16:55] accept
[1:16:56] that and if there are those whose names
[1:16:59] were never placed upon a record of life
[1:17:03] we must accept that
[1:17:08] also reading through this it just makes
[1:17:10] it so real how we cannot look around we
[1:17:15] can't look at a brother we can't look at
[1:17:17] a sister and say well that brother does
[1:17:19] this and that sister does that and and
[1:17:21] it'll be okay for me if I just do it
[1:17:24] their way you can't do that you have to
[1:17:26] do it according to the word brothers and
[1:17:28] sisters you have to do it according to
[1:17:29] the spirit inside of you that leads you
[1:17:31] through the
[1:17:32] word this is how close it is today so
[1:17:37] close that it would deceive the very
[1:17:39] elected if it were possible but by that
[1:17:42] token Spirit of the life of Jesus Christ
[1:17:44] Living out through us we're going to
[1:17:46] follow this word and it's going to take
[1:17:48] us to this predestinated position in
[1:17:51] Christ
[1:17:53] Jesus I think it's just aming amazing
[1:17:55] when we look at this though we can't
[1:17:57] look around and and judge anyone let's
[1:17:59] just judge
[1:18:01] ourselves and if there are those who
[1:18:03] will enter into life eternal after the
[1:18:06] white Throne judgment solely on the
[1:18:09] grounds of being good and kind and just
[1:18:12] to the elect of God who are his Brethren
[1:18:16] then we cannot but accept that for who
[1:18:20] knoweth the mind of the Lord that he
[1:18:22] should instruct him rather let us be
[1:18:25] subject in in faith to him who is our
[1:18:29] father and
[1:18:31] live to understand this subject even
[1:18:34] more clearly it will now be wise to
[1:18:37] approach it from the standpoint of the
[1:18:39] church Through the
[1:18:41] Ages up until now we have been thinking
[1:18:44] in terms of the removal of the names of
[1:18:48] individuals now we want to consider not
[1:18:52] the individuals but the groups represent
[1:18:54] Ed in the church my excuse
[1:19:00] me there been a couple of Sundays I
[1:19:03] haven't preached I guess I feel like
[1:19:06] preaching certainly enjoyed what brother
[1:19:09] mvin had to say and I think there's so
[1:19:12] much there that uh I just appreciate
[1:19:16] appreciate brother mvin and his approach
[1:19:18] and all that he does for the body God
[1:19:20] bless you
[1:19:22] brother brother Ram goes on to say to do
[1:19:24] so so we will liken the church Through
[1:19:26] the Ages to the wheat plant a grain of
[1:19:30] wheat is planted to the end that a
[1:19:32] single grain of wheat will reproduce and
[1:19:34] multiply itself through a certain
[1:19:37] process during a certain period of
[1:19:40] time that Single Seed will die but in
[1:19:45] dying the life that was in it will come
[1:19:49] up into a plant which will turn in turn
[1:19:53] be the bearer or Carrier of that life
[1:19:56] which is to come back to originality in
[1:19:59] a multiplied
[1:20:02] form Jesus the great Royal seed died
[1:20:05] that matchless one who is the life of
[1:20:08] the church stands in the midst of the
[1:20:11] church for all seven Church ages giving
[1:20:14] his life to the church carrier or Bearer
[1:20:18] to the end I just love this his very
[1:20:23] life will be reproduced in bodies like
[1:20:27] unto his in the
[1:20:29] resurrection and I I just can't help but
[1:20:31] think about this brothers and sisters I
[1:20:33] I don't think that he's just talking
[1:20:36] about the resurrection and
[1:20:38] Rapture I think he's talking about the
[1:20:40] literal life of Jesus Christ Living out
[1:20:42] through his bride speaking the word and
[1:20:46] actually causing other people to hear
[1:20:49] what the spirit says to the
[1:20:52] church he goes on to say it is at the
[1:20:54] resurrection that the Royal seed will
[1:20:57] see many Royal seeds like unto himself
[1:21:00] and they will be even as he is for it
[1:21:03] says John we shall be like him this is
[1:21:07] what John the Baptist was referring to
[1:21:09] when he said Jesus would gather the
[1:21:11] wheed into the Garner that was the
[1:21:13] resurrection where the redeemed who had
[1:21:15] been elected unto eternal life came in
[1:21:19] now then the record of this wheat plant
[1:21:22] whose end is to reproduce The Original
[1:21:26] Seed in a multiplied form is The Book of
[1:21:30] Life I
[1:21:32] repeat this history or record of this
[1:21:36] wheat plant is The Book of Life of which
[1:21:40] a part of the book of life is the record
[1:21:45] of eternal life a section of the book of
[1:21:50] life this is convincingly seen by
[1:21:53] examining the wheat plant a bare seed is
[1:21:57] sown soon a blade is seen but that is
[1:22:01] not the wheat
[1:22:03] yet then it grows into a stock this is
[1:22:07] not yet wheat life is in there but not
[1:22:11] the wheat then at the end of the stock
[1:22:15] is a little Spike that sends out a
[1:22:18] tassel still a wheat
[1:22:21] plant but no wheat yet
[1:22:24] then the plant is
[1:22:26] polonized and we see the chaff grow this
[1:22:30] looks Mighty like the wheat but is not
[1:22:34] yet
[1:22:35] seed then forms the wheat in the husk it
[1:22:39] is now back to what it was originally
[1:22:43] now the ripened wheat is
[1:22:45] harvested Jesus Christ died he gave his
[1:22:49] life that life was to come back upon the
[1:22:53] church and bring many sons like unto
[1:22:56] himself unto glory in the resurrection
[1:23:00] but as the wheat seed had to have a
[1:23:02] carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat
[1:23:06] seed even so there had to be a church
[1:23:10] which would be the carrier of the Life
[1:23:13] of
[1:23:14] Christ and that's where I my last
[1:23:17] statement comes from there has to be a
[1:23:19] church who is going to be the carrier of
[1:23:21] the Life of Christ
[1:23:24] as the blade stock tassel and husks were
[1:23:28] the carriers for the seed but not the
[1:23:31] seed itself so the church corporate
[1:23:34] Through the
[1:23:36] Ages has been the carrier of the true
[1:23:39] seed though not the seed
[1:23:43] itself that is why we can say The Book
[1:23:46] of Life is the whole wheat
[1:23:50] plant let's go over that again here is
[1:23:54] the that Original Seed that was planted
[1:23:57] it produced a blade that wasn't it it
[1:24:00] produced a stock not it either here come
[1:24:04] husks in which the wheat is to form that
[1:24:09] isn't it the tassel appears then pollen
[1:24:14] falls on those pistols I just can't help
[1:24:16] but think brothers and sisters there's a
[1:24:18] time where that true plant gets
[1:24:21] pollinated by the words someone
[1:24:23] somewhere along away says something some
[1:24:25] words of life and it pollinates those
[1:24:28] pistols the spirit of Jesus Christ in
[1:24:31] that person imparts life pollinates that
[1:24:36] seed he goes on to say part of that
[1:24:38] plant is quickened something out of that
[1:24:40] Original Seed that came up through the
[1:24:42] rest of the plant turns into a seed why
[1:24:46] didn't the whole plant go into seed
[1:24:49] because it was created to that end just
[1:24:52] part of that plant
[1:24:54] can go back to being seed because just
[1:24:58] part of that wheat plant is eternal life
[1:25:03] wheat you have a perfect type of that in
[1:25:06] Israel leaving
[1:25:09] Egypt I just love how brother Bram does
[1:25:11] this because he's already said this in
[1:25:12] this in this chapter but just to hear
[1:25:15] him say it again he just
[1:25:17] continually um underpins it you have a
[1:25:20] perfect type of that in Israel leaving
[1:25:22] Egypt they came came out about 2 million
[1:25:26] strong all escaped through the
[1:25:28] sacrificial blood all were baptized in
[1:25:30] the Red Sea all came up out of the water
[1:25:33] enjoying Holy Spirit manifestation and
[1:25:37] blessings all ate angel food all drank
[1:25:41] of the rock that followed them yet
[1:25:44] except for a very few they were not but
[1:25:48] carriers for the children who should
[1:25:51] follow them and go into Canaan land all
[1:25:55] Israel is not
[1:25:57] Israel and all but a tiny minority had
[1:26:01] their names blotted out of the book of
[1:26:05] life so
[1:26:07] sad but it's God's choice why we have
[1:26:12] the same right today in the
[1:26:14] church names are going to be blotted out
[1:26:18] of the book of life no names will be
[1:26:22] blotted out of the book of eternal life
[1:26:25] for that is another
[1:26:27] record though contained in the Book of
[1:26:30] Life first John
[1:26:34] 51-12 and this is the record that God
[1:26:36] hath given to us eternal life and that
[1:26:40] life is in his
[1:26:42] son he that hath the son hath life he
[1:26:47] that hath not the Son of God hath not
[1:26:49] life how do we have the Son of God the
[1:26:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:55] brother Bram says it loud and clear
[1:26:57] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:59] you're
[1:27:00] lost
[1:27:02] am it's vital without the baptism of the
[1:27:05] Holy Ghost we are
[1:27:07] lost carrying on he says and those who
[1:27:10] have that life were in him before the
[1:27:14] foundation of the world they were chosen
[1:27:17] in him before the foundation of the
[1:27:20] world that great Royal seed Jesus Christ
[1:27:25] was planted he died and that life that
[1:27:28] was in him came up through the wheat
[1:27:30] plant and is reproducing itself in
[1:27:34] multitudes of wheat seeds having the
[1:27:37] same life in them and being like the
[1:27:40] original because by Spirit they are
[1:27:45] original I just can't help but think he
[1:27:47] makes that present tense the way that
[1:27:49] paragraph is written it's so good he
[1:27:52] goes on to say now we can see why the
[1:27:54] redeemed bought back by original owner
[1:27:59] bride she was in him as Eve was in
[1:28:03] Adam cannot ever have her member names
[1:28:08] taken off the Record She is a part of
[1:28:12] him she is in the throne she can never
[1:28:16] be
[1:28:17] judged everyone in the Bride is a member
[1:28:20] of him and he loses none John
[1:28:26] 639 but that is not so concerning the
[1:28:29] all in the Book of Life for amongst them
[1:28:33] are even those like Judas Etc who have a
[1:28:36] part in the record but their names are
[1:28:40] removed we can see those who come in the
[1:28:44] last days and after having done
[1:28:47] wonderful
[1:28:48] Works Jesus will say that he never knew
[1:28:52] them that's why brothers and sisters
[1:28:54] don't look at Works don't look for Works
[1:28:57] to be your manifestation of whether
[1:28:59] you've got the holy ghost or not don't
[1:29:02] don't be trying to to do things don't be
[1:29:05] working your way into heaven because
[1:29:06] it's not going to work the only thing
[1:29:08] you can do is get the baptism of the
[1:29:10] Holy Ghost the true seal of God
[1:29:12] according to the Vindicated prophet's
[1:29:14] message when you do that all of the rest
[1:29:16] of the works and manifestations will
[1:29:19] follow but if we try and make it a Works
[1:29:21] based gospel a Works based message we're
[1:29:24] gonna find ourselves exactly where he's
[1:29:26] talking about right
[1:29:28] now it is not that he was not aware of
[1:29:31] them his omniscience precludes that but
[1:29:36] they were not forn as in the bride and
[1:29:39] neither were they forn as amongst the
[1:29:41] righteous of the second
[1:29:44] Resurrection they bore no fruit because
[1:29:47] they were outside the word did not abide
[1:29:51] in it and they therefore were sentenced
[1:29:54] to death Lord have
[1:29:56] mercy then as we have previously shown
[1:30:00] there are those who stood for the bride
[1:30:03] and were an aid and comfort to her those
[1:30:07] had their names remaining on the book of
[1:30:09] life and go into life Everlasting
[1:30:13] finally there are those such as pharaoh
[1:30:16] who never had their names on the book of
[1:30:17] life and these are cast into the Lake of
[1:30:20] Fire
[1:30:22] also thus the grain of wheat that became
[1:30:25] a plant for the Harvest is the record of
[1:30:29] the
[1:30:30] church even as not all the wheat plant
[1:30:34] is wheat seed and is not all the plant
[1:30:37] used in the Harvest so with the church
[1:30:41] all the church is not the bride and
[1:30:45] neither is it all given eternal life but
[1:30:49] a part of it is gathered into the Garner
[1:30:52] and a part of it is kept that it might
[1:30:55] enter into eternal life in the second
[1:30:58] resurrection and a part of it is a
[1:31:02] counted chaff is burned in the Lake of
[1:31:06] Fire and that is exactly what John the
[1:31:08] Baptist and Jesus said for John said
[1:31:12] that the wheat would be the garnered and
[1:31:14] the chaff
[1:31:17] burned Jesus said bind the tears and
[1:31:20] then gather the wheat The ecumenical
[1:31:23] move will bind the tear churches
[1:31:26] together for the tears must be bound
[1:31:30] first and though their end is burning
[1:31:33] they are not burned at their binding but
[1:31:37] are reserved to a later date which is at
[1:31:40] the end of the Thousand
[1:31:42] Years or the second
[1:31:47] Resurrection I just love this next
[1:31:49] sentence here brothers and sisters this
[1:31:50] caught my attention and I'm probably
[1:31:52] going to study this out for a bit it but
[1:31:54] once the tears are bound the Rapture can
[1:31:58] take
[1:31:59] place and does so at some time between
[1:32:03] the binding and the revelation of the
[1:32:06] Antichrist it's an interesting sentence
[1:32:09] that
[1:32:10] one then will come the day when all will
[1:32:13] stand together as seen in Daniel
[1:32:17] 7:10 the king will be there with his
[1:32:19] bride and in front of them will be the
[1:32:23] multi udes who are to be judged yes all
[1:32:28] are there we talked about it last time
[1:32:31] what a scene that will be to see every
[1:32:33] single human being that was ever created
[1:32:37] before the foundation of the world all
[1:32:39] in one place at one time how many people
[1:32:41] will that
[1:32:42] be wow all the books are opened a final
[1:32:47] disposition of all is made the Harvest
[1:32:51] is indeed over the books once opened are
[1:32:53] closed closed in concluding this subject
[1:32:57] for this time let me refer to a
[1:33:00] statement made at its beginning wherein
[1:33:04] I said that not one scripture spoke of
[1:33:09] the Lord presently compiling a record of
[1:33:12] names that is indeed
[1:33:15] so however there is a scripture pointing
[1:33:19] to a future
[1:33:21] compilation it's in the 87th
[1:33:24] Psalm this Psalm speaks of the Lord
[1:33:27] writing up the names of all those born
[1:33:30] in
[1:33:31] Zion let's just turn over there we still
[1:33:34] have a few minutes this is working out
[1:33:36] perfectly we're going to wind up the
[1:33:38] sardan church age tonight and next time
[1:33:41] Lord willing will'll begin the
[1:33:42] Philadelphian Church age Psalms 87
[1:33:58] Psalms 87 it says his foundation is in
[1:34:02] the Holy
[1:34:03] mountains the Lord loveth the gates of
[1:34:06] Zion more than all the dwellings of
[1:34:11] Jacob glorious things are spoken of thee
[1:34:15] Oh city of
[1:34:16] God
[1:34:18] saah I will make mention of Rahab and
[1:34:21] Babylon to them that know me
[1:34:25] behold philistia and Ty with
[1:34:30] Ethiopia this man was born
[1:34:33] there and of Zion it shall be
[1:34:36] said this and that man was born in her
[1:34:41] and the highest himself shall establish
[1:34:44] her the Lord shall count when he writeth
[1:34:48] up the people that this man was born
[1:34:51] there saah and as well the singers as
[1:34:55] the players on instruments shall be
[1:34:58] there all my Springs are in
[1:35:03] thee I think that's just an amazing
[1:35:05] scripture there's so much we could get
[1:35:07] into but he just mentions it here and he
[1:35:09] doesn't really say it so I wanted to
[1:35:11] make sure that we read it we had a
[1:35:12] reference point for it Lord willing
[1:35:15] we'll get into it a little bit
[1:35:16] later um just picking up where we left
[1:35:19] off here that is indeed so however there
[1:35:22] is a scripture pointing to a future
[1:35:23] compilation it is in the 87th Psalm this
[1:35:28] Psalm speaks of the Lord writing up the
[1:35:30] names of all those born in
[1:35:35] Zion on no account can it be presumed
[1:35:39] that God has to wait until the end of
[1:35:40] the ages or that period of time dealing
[1:35:43] with Zion in order to know who all might
[1:35:46] be born in Zion again that would
[1:35:50] preclude omniscience surely he knows who
[1:35:55] all comprise that number but what is it
[1:35:59] is it not simply the revised rule
[1:36:02] wherein God simply places in a new
[1:36:05] record those names which remained after
[1:36:09] the second resurrection that pertained
[1:36:11] to
[1:36:12] Zion surely that is it and I will
[1:36:16] confess his name before my father and
[1:36:20] his angels roll call in heaven
[1:36:24] my is there going to be people born
[1:36:27] there that's what my mind says are there
[1:36:30] going to be people born there I don't
[1:36:34] know job for job 144 and 15 if a man die

[1:36:57] hands the great Shepherd is calling his
[1:37:00] Sheep by name I'll call the
[1:37:04] musicians the creative voice of God is
[1:37:07] calling them forth from the dust or
[1:37:11] changing their atoms even though they
[1:37:14] had not fallen
[1:37:16] asleep it is the
[1:37:19] rapture it is the great marriage supper
[1:37:22] of the Lamb and his
[1:37:25] bride and we know the prophet for our
[1:37:28] age the Vindicated prophet he said the
[1:37:30] Rapture is a process it is not a single
[1:37:33] event it culminates with a single event
[1:37:36] but it's been taking place for a long
[1:37:38] time
[1:37:40] am but the Rapture is not the only roll
[1:37:44] call there at the second
[1:37:47] Resurrection at the great white Throne
[1:37:50] judgment will be
[1:37:52] names will names be confessed before the
[1:37:55] father and his angels now I have been
[1:37:58] told by those who know that the sweetest
[1:38:01] sound to a human ear is the sound of
[1:38:04] that person's
[1:38:06] name how people love to have their names
[1:38:10] before the public how they love ACC
[1:38:13] claim but no earthly voice will ever
[1:38:17] sound your name as sweetly as will the
[1:38:21] voice of God if you your name is in the
[1:38:24] Book of Life and remains there to be
[1:38:27] revealed before the Holy
[1:38:30] Angels
[1:38:33] my what a day that will be when we hear
[1:38:37] Jesus say father they confessed my name
[1:38:40] before men in the days of their Earthly
[1:38:45] pilgrimage now I will confess their
[1:38:48] names before thee and all the Heavenly
[1:38:51] angels

[1:38:57] the spirit saith to the
[1:38:59] churches once more the spirit hath
[1:39:02] spoken once again we have reviewed the
[1:39:05] record of what the spirit said to
[1:39:07] another
[1:39:08] age and we have found the record
[1:39:12] correct another age has gone by and it
[1:39:16] was fulfilled exactly as he said it
[1:39:18] would be what a consolation that is to
[1:39:22] us who hope to be in the last day Bride
[1:39:26] for it causes our hearts to leap for joy
[1:39:30] that he is faithful and will perform his
[1:39:33] every
[1:39:35] promise if he was faithful and true to
[1:39:38] those of the sardan
[1:39:40] age then he is just as true to this our
[1:39:46] age if they by his grace and power will
[1:39:51] be received and commended by
