suggest we read our Bibles then we can thereafter take the comfort of our seat get acquainted and see what the Lord has for us God bless you you all are welcome tonight if you have your Bibles with you please turn with me to the Book of Psalms chapter 16 psalm 16 Proverbs 16 Isaiah 55 one verse from the book of Psalm chapter 16 verse1 one verse from The Book of Proverbs 16 verse 25 and some few verses in Isaiah chapter 55 16 verse 11 says okay some are still opening amen thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more amen amen Proverbs chapter 16 the 25th verse there is a way that seeth right unto a man but the hint thereof are the ways of death amen finally Isaiah chapter 55 I'll read from the sixth verse verse 6 seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man is thoughts and let return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon amen for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways say the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not either but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth in B that it may give seed to the S and bread to the heater so shall my word be that go f out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the Hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the th shall come up the fire three and instead of the Bride shall come up the Mattel tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his holy word amen God bless you you may please be seated I want to thank the Lord this evening for making it possible uh for us to be in the midst of the Believers uh in this part of the world at this time and uh I want to thank the pastor for his gracious warm welcome of Fellowship that he has given to us uh to come and be of service maybe somewhere along the line we can be of a blessing I thank him for his warm welcome before we came we've been chatting and he's been checking on us and uh we've had a good conversation on the phone God bless you sir thank you for your kind reception I appreciate other Servants of God in here and uh I appreciate every one of you for coming to church uh I like it when I see people to speak to the gospel is not meant for cheers and benches the gospel is meant for human beings I'm not one of the preachers who will say I don't care whether you come or you don't come I will preach anyhow I like for you to come and I'm Glad You Came amen I do not take that for granted so I pray that you B the Lord will bless your sacrifices for coming uh to the house of the Lord tonight I recognize the presence of one well in Africa we recognize frontliners we call them fathers in the Lord so I recognize the presence of apostle uh who is sitting quietly and hly at the back there yeah God bless you sir nice to have you yeah when we were a lot younger those were the teers who brought preachers who brought us up if there was anybody who went my appetite to like and study the seven Church ages that was him if he had a long time to

and glad to see all of you amen uh I'm not good with names and maybe also with uh Faces Sometimes but the last time I was here standing on this PO was 2015 and that was when our pastor who had gone to be with the Lord was here Pastor K booy and uh we certainly had a wonderful time both in the church and outside of the church because it gave us real good time of hting here and I pray that the Lord

nice to be here tonight we'll bring the greetings of the Saints from Nigeria as many as knew we were coming told us to pass their warm regards and uh I don't know you might chance upon any of them uh just let them know we give give their greetings amen BR K God bless you too amen and uh also we bring greetings from the Saints uh in Vancouver uh we arrived in Calgary yesterday and they knew we were coming this ways they told us greet all the Believers in Calgary for us amen if this is not the total number you will help me to greet the rest of the numbers so the Lord bless you we are happy to be here tonight amen and we appreciate brother Toby's family brother Justice family brother Justice family was has been our landlord since 2015 and they are so glad to retain the title amen but along the line you know last week we passed by here quietly because we had services in and mon but our flight was routed to KAG so we spend the night with brob and there it was such a wonderful time so God bless all of you amen tonight if the Lord will be our help which I trust he will I want to speak uh just to encourage you on a subject I called God's provided way God's provided way I took inspiration for this subject where the O is ah okay God bless you I bring greetings from brother and the Saints amen I had privilege to be in service not too long and they told me when you come here greet our people so I'm greeting their people all right so I took inspiration for this subject on and experience uh the prophet shared with us in the message you must be born again uh in this message he and the brother who then wasn't a message believer uh they call him brother Marion Lee uh they were good friends even though he wasn't a Believer but they have good attraction uh in the sense that anytime they have an opportunity to be together they want to talk about the things of God so the that is to say mind what you talk about when you have when you meet with people amen the prophet said if the love of God is in our heart we won't talk a whole day with people people without chipping in the love of God so brother Lee and brother Braham find good comfort in spending time together especially around the world and the prophet we always tell brother Lee that if you really want to be born again it goes with repentance and water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins then you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost brotherly believe that it should repent but he doesn't see anything much about water baptism so and the prophet will say it's essential to your Christian experience if you want your sins remitted and uh you shouldn't go into water just like that you must go by Divine prescription if he says do it in the name Jesus Christ you won't get any better until you do it like that amen so brother Lee we argue that and but some for some reason they still got along fine so on a particular day they were staying in the same house passing the night in the same room that day and because brother Lee was a seed of God yes at God's Own appointed time he will find a way to register the message if somebody is a seed of God you don't make too much trouble about him when God is ready for him he will bring him home so what God did was to give Lee a dream dream and in that dream God was dealing with Lee the way his mind runs Lee was a building contractor so he gave him a message of building contraction God is not really far from hor he can deal with us explain his will to us by the simple simple daily things that we do so he came to Lee by way of a dream and you know Lee saw himself having conversation with a man who who wanted to build a house so he gave him the building contract that you know help me build my house but you see this man when he came he had his own idea of what he want build so he came with his blueprint he wasn't going to rely on the sensus of Lee he had what he wanted in mind he knew what he wanted so he gave Lee the design and he said I'm going on vacation to Florida get my house ready before before I returned and they sealed the transaction so while Lee was building according to Lee he saw some structur some things maybe like window like doors or like pillars that ought not to be where he put them and by his own personal judgment he changed them he removed certain things he haded certain things he changed the position of certain things and in his own mindset he had the house ready so when the man came uh Lee have you finished my house very well but you see unfortunately for Lee the man wasn't going to judge the uh the blueprint by Le's achievement that is very critical he was going to judge Le's achievement by the blueprint so as as far as the man is concerned the wisdom the understanding the idea of lead does not matter right it is what he wanted that he wanted and uh he said please bring my blueprint and as he was looking at the blueprint and Le achievement he said where is this pillar that I put here he said according to the building Convention of albera no pillar is always puted there so I removed it how about my window here according to the new contemporary Design Technology no window gets there I removed it and the Lee told him you say you've built a house but you've not built my house if you care for me to pay and accept this transaction you must tear it down and build it all over again then before Lee had a chance to respond he came out of the dream and he became very frantic and anxious and straight away he ran to brother Braham and he said this is the dream I had what do you think I should do brother Braham said very simple is how you see there's a creek running down there let's just go settle it once and for all all God is telling you by that is that you must do things correctly God's provided [Music] way amen and God's uh God's position Remain the same even till now if you want a blessing if you want God's approval you must come his provided way from the scriptures that we read There are two ways that were presented to us he said one is the path of life that's according to Psalms chapter 16 it said but no man ever discovers this way by his or herself you have got to be shown thou will show me the path of life I want you to underline it amen all right then the other way we read in Proverbs chapter 16 it's a way that you don't need anybody to show you I will prove to you why you don't need anybody to show you very soon but you see it's a way that you are so convinced of how be it your conviction is presumptuous the Bible said it's a way that seeth right to the one who wants to walk in it but by the highest by the Judgment of the one who can see the end from the beginning that way will lead to death but the man who wanted the way does not know how he going to fall how he going to end but it looks attractive for him to embrace so we have before us tonight the path of life and we also have the way of death and choices must be made all of us one way or the other will walk in one of the ways there's no neutral ground and according to the scriptures in the book of Isaiah these two ways don't me can never meet and will never ever meet there are two parallel lines he said your ways are not my ways your thoughts are not my thoughts the scripture even offered an impression of the distance that they are apart as the heaven is so high above the Earth so are these ways wide apart so if you choose to walk in the two ways at the same time your legs aren't long enough that's right to be planted to plant one here and to plant one there amen so that means you've got to choose one amen and when you choose one you are forsaken the other when you choose the other you are forsaken this one one leads to death one leads to life but I have something to say here if the Lord leave you leave you to choices do you know you would rather choose the one that leads to death it is not in man to choose correctly ah all right now these two ways are in you and I it is not like albata highway or an Highway they are in Earth in horse they came into you both by your election and by your natural birth when an elect is born is born with the two ways inside of him but the two ways are not active at the same time the prophet said within the construction of your heart where you have the soul you have a dark PCH that envelopes your whole heart if you are a seed of God then you have a little light like the size of a button also in there but the first one that takes over your life is the one imposed upon you by your natural birth which is the darkness and that is why the prophet in the message thinking side thinking man's filter he said you and I we are born without a fighting chance and because we are born with a nature imposed on us by our natural birth because our natural birth formula was not God's Divine prescription are you with me church it was Satan's idea and that is why till tomorrow God will never accept it he permitted it but he never accepted it amen I hope I'm not confusing you amen and that is why when God came in flesh he made a demand he said you must underline that word you must be born again the use of the word again is to show to you that he recognizes that you have already been born but because he rejected that birth that is why he placed the compulsion on you to be born again amen amen are you with me now because that natural birth was God's way was Satan's way of injecting his nature into Mankind and that was why the first person born by that birth was called Cain amen can in the dispensation of Innocence without any influence that has gone before him committed murder so you will ask yourself who taught him right because he never saw an example to know how to kill he became angry he became envious and he also became a liar and he became defiant in lying all those things you will find in Genesis and also even when he was shown the way of right there was nothing in him to repent and make his way right everything was there in that chapter and all these things took place in the dispensation of Innocence meaning in the dispensation when there is not be an influence that went in advance to the contrary so that he could say I did what this fellow did so how then did can't come about it it was in him that way was in him and that is why the prophet said we were the Bible said we were shaped in iniquity we came to the world speaking lies nobody thought us their lies it was in nth in us and the way seems so right but before you can turn to the path of Life somebody needs to instruct you you see why the Bible said thou will show me the path of Life somebody preach to you amen somebody maybe give you a thr somebody maybe invited you to church and you heard the words of life and something connected with your heart and you begin to Hunger for More the Bible said it is the the prophet said it is the little button of life that is hungering to come to life are you following so these two ways are in you and high if God leaves you to make these choices like you did in the beginning you will choose the way of death and that was why after the fall of Genesis chapter 3 when God has achieved his aim by free moral agency he no longer wants you to exercise your right of Choosing by yourself again amen you didn't catch that in the Garden of Eden he gave men free moral agency meaning the ability to make your choices without being interfered with is that right so but the prophet in the in the message marriage and divorce told us that God had a reason to give man such a blanket ability you know why because this ability is not complementary with your makeup the Bible called you a sheep a sheep cannot lead isil herself it's meant to be led but here it's somebody giving you the ability to direct yourself then then that ability must be a suspect and God has a suspicious activity for it that is why in the message marriage and divorce the prophet said he gave man that right of choosing knowing that by that he will fall God needed the fall of mankind it is not a sacrilege listen to me the prophet you say when the world talk about Genesis 3 it is okay but when Believers talk about it you must must talk about it with a level of Grace and higher understanding because that's the essence of the open word that's the essence of the reveal word when the prophet was talking about Genesis 3 he said and when Satan has brought to pass that which was necessary to the purpose of God MH you people are English people you don't understand grammar better than I do so you can DEC you can analyze that he said Satan brought to pass what was necessary to the purpose of God so the fall was [Music] necessary amen God engineered the fall and you can coach me on that because he has a purpose by it to achieve the prophet said in eternity when God was was not even God in the sense of being object of worship he had a desire to be God but he doesn't just want to be God Alone he also want to be known Beyond being God and if you want to know him Beyond being God he wants you to enjoy his attributes he has an attribute to heal to redeem to save to deliver but you see there's a problem here amen healing will not be necessary if nobody ever get get sick Deliverance is not necessary if nobody's in bondage salvation is not necessary if nobody is lost amen and Redemption is not necessary if nothing is out of place but there was perfection in the Garden of Eden such that these attributes will never be necessary so you know what God did God upset his own program they say Satan upset God's program it's impossible POS Hallelujah did you hear me it is God giv him you see the devil is not in this picture at all and I hope you see that in your life also amen Satan can do nothing if the Lord does not give him permission you see brother said the Holiness of God the purity of God cannot make him do certain things so he created a being to fill that void for him he must do it so that God can advance his own program amen so you can see that Satan will find out at the end of this old business that God was only using him he will dump him like a trash so this was the reason he gave the man the right of choice he made the woman in a manner to bring the the four that's what the word taught I'm saying woman I'm not talking of you redeemed sisters all right but then he created a being called The Serpent now the reason he created that being to be a bridge between human an animal was because he has an assignment for him and in the message serent seed brother Braham said God did not just created that animal as animal he created him with the principles of the under with the understanding of the principles of life you see an hanimal understood the principles of life he knows how to bring life in a perverted way so when the devil came into the garden he saw a willing tool waiting for him that was why he never went into lion he came to the serpent amen and that is what made serpent a beast because he caned himself in fullness into serpent all right just as the full fullness of God came in the body called Christ the fullness of the devil came into the body called serpent there will be one more Beast again coming that is when this office of the Pope will have Satan fully incarnated in him that is what will make him a beast right now is a false prophet but when it becomes Satan incarnated he will become a beast that's what the word said amen all right so the devil cannot himself inside him in order to inject to reproduce himself vicariously that was why Cain was full blooded son of Serpent and the Bible called him the son of the wicked one and that was why he needed no toor to teach him everything about wickedness all right but this is where I'm going when he created serpent that way and he created woman that way don't forget Adam proceeded from God he was like a scoop out of the life of God himself amen that is why the first appearance of Adam in the garden was a spirit form then God made a flesh and put a spirit form in there all right so that makes Adam a complete Son of God because God took a portion out of himself in that formula in that shape he can never be deceived he can never be flooded it can never fall but the fall was necessary am so you know what God did God gave him the right ability to choose without Divine interference that is the meaning of free moral agency God said I will not interfere you choose you know why the prophet said God knew that by that by that Adam will fall that was where when the fall took place and Adam has not gotten involved you can see that nothing happened on the earth it's only the woman the had problem but when Adam had to make his own choice that was the reason God gave him knowing that he would rather choose the woman than anything else in order to also you know for you know be a prophecy to other types of the scripture in the front that was why God gave him that right of choosing so that he could join in the fall and the attributes of God will become necessary now this is where I'm now coming to since God achieved that it does not expect you and I to use our free moral agency ability by ourselves he expects you to hand that over to him amen that is why when the prophet was preaching does God change his mind about his word he said I recognize you he said you must submit yourself to the word and the will of God the word of God is the Bible the will of God is the message of the hour because the message is what declares the will of God in every dispensation such that when you follow that will of God you are automatically fulfilling the entire Bible ah Hallelujah he said we must submit ourself to it and he said I recognize you can say that but God said said he will give me the desire of my heart then he came back and he said and you let your desire be the word of God never your own will so the choice of a believer in any situation is what God [Applause] says this is the only way to walk in the will of God are you following me all right let me make it easy for you there are three exoduses in the Bible or at least that the prophet pointed our attention to from the scriptures he said the first one was when God was taking a nation out of the Nations Pastor do you mind me removing my jacket you must have poet maners all right thank you it said the first one was when it was taking a nation out of a nation that was Israel coming out of Egypt the second one was when it was taken a church out of religion and that was why when Christ came and never identifi with any religion denomination you have it then as you have it now what you call Pharisees sades send scribes theod and so forth they were all denominated SE of their day but you see when our Lord came he never identify with any but he called the church out of them all right and this last one he is calling the bride out of the church amen but you see the first Exodus is the plan in Exodus this last one is the Harvest of all Exodus and the last day is always vindicating the first day so such that when if you are not in the F you can have an idea of what to place in the F when you see what is going on now are you following me because the first is the planting season and if you plant a seed in the uh planting time you don't rip one seed in the Harvest amen they told us that if you plant corn or maze if you are familiar with that just one seed can give you two cups and on each cup you you can have about 612 seats so meaning that a seat can give you 1,224 seats in your harvest season you get much more than you plant at the time of harvest so whatever you saw you are seen in the first Exodus expect much more now so nothing is actually out of cater the clock is scking right the program is going as it should and the Bible remains perfect Hallelujah so if you have one Kora one Dayan one abam in the first Exodus you will have several hundreds of them in this last Exodus nothing has changed amen Kora is the make believing group who would follow the message who would even Escape some things they escape the death of the first born they escape the Red Sea they drank water from the rock they enjoyed manner but they were not designed to go true so at some point they must have problem with the message of that hour and they must attack the message of the hour and then they must be swallowed and consumed ahuh all right so those things you will say it in the last days so I want to point something out from the first Exodus to give you an understanding of this way when God was ready to take Israel out in the first Exodus I want the church to know that there are many ways that led out of Egypt and will take them to Canaan that's right yeah it's in your Bible I'm not preaching a saege even the Bible spoke of a particular Highway he call it the way of the Philistines and the Bible even said is a shorter route from Egypt to Canaan is in your Bible yes sir he said but God did not want them to be intimidated with Wars as if they never had Wars along their Journey amen so he didn't choose that way Moses had gone out of Egypt before and he went to the lands of Jetro the midianites it didn't have to cross through the Red Sea and I want to tell you even till today listen to me church you can travel from Israel to Egypt eypt I have done that before and you travel on the borderlines of the Red Sea and do not have to cross the Red Sea and yet you will get to Egypt till today uhuh but when God was ready to lead this people the first thing he did was to appoint a leader listen to me CH in ex Exodus chap 23 he said behold you see this Pillar of Fire had been walking with Moses All Along that's right you know he met him in the burning bush he commissioned him and he never left him everything Moses ever did he was gued by the pillar of fire but the Exodus people didn't know that fact so when the journey was ready to start God gave the Exodus people the Consciousness am that there is a leader for this journey I hope you are still having that Consciousness that the message of the hour is not the idea of a kentan it came from the Throne of God Apostle Paul said that which I receive from the Lord the same might deliver to the church and Paul was so bold of his receiving until he said if it is we or an angel that will speak contrary to these things that I have given unto you let him be a cur those were profound statements the Gentiles must know how to follow the prophet amen if you want to follow the revealed World brother Braham say you got no touch coming Hallelujah God doesn't need your idea he doesn't need your theory it doesn't need your suggestion it's a full C menuall that does not need a recooking there were seven dreams that became Vision because they were interpreted before the seals were opened sister Willard cins was among those who gave the dreams in her own dream he saw brother Brown serving a food amen and it looked awkward for the pastor to be serving when the sisters were there you get what I'm saying but that kind of food cannot be served by any other person than William Bram himself amen and sister will Collins said when everybody ate that food the testimony is that this is the sweetest the best food we have ever eaten if something is already in sweetest and the best it doesn't need a reconstitution uh-huh ites doesn't need a recooking you don't need to hard orate from the ingredient it means all you need to do is to warm it and save it we must never lose that Consciousness am you see the way you follow the message is the way the prophet himself followed the message do you realize that the message Revelation came to the prophet progressively and it said when this truth came out out they came out better than my personal understanding so he himself had to drop his own understanding in order to follow the light if you are not ready for that you become a broken sister and the broken sister is a water that does not flow a broken system can only retain Purity for a little while after while because there is no flowing effect it's going to become stagnated and undesirable things will start developing but if there's a good life in there it will die hallu so God told that church behold I send my angel before you that angel was not Moses H that angel was the pillar of fire Exodus 23 now from the instruction he gave him there he said Beware of him amen don't Chen him don't query him don't suggest to him he knows what he's doing he can carry you through if you are too sophisticated for him you better fall out because it's dangerous to be a rebel behind the pillar of fire now but there's a challenge here friends this Angel this Captain this leader is not visible amen so you are going to follow an invisible leader how would you know his direction are you catching it till till today even when brother brah was here pillow of fire was invisible until God in his Mercy in order to shut and humiliate the critic allow the picture to be taken all you will hear the prophet said is that for somebody came to the prayer line he said do you feel so sweet do you have such an unusual sweet feeling and the person will say yes it said is the effect of that angel he not 2 feet he not more than 2T away from you that's why you are feeling that way if that looks like an un story to the people amen that was why God one day by the uncute UN gentlemanly behavior of Reverend best God gave us the picture so that the people will realize that brother Braham wasn't making up stories it was a reality are you here Brethren so this angel will go before you he said Beware of him but the men to be careful of they don't know nobody could see him this is where Moses came into the picture Moses was so humanized the leadership of the pillar of fire amen if that was what took place in the first Exodus I'm happy to tell you it took place in the Third Exodus the prophet in the message Mighty God unveiled before us he said for 33 years I veiled the pillar of fire interpreting the word to you don't have problem with me there's a quotation I'm reading so if you have problem with that have problem with the quotation he said I veiled the pillar of fire interpreting the words to you because you cannot stand the effect of the pillar of fire even brother brah said I never get used to its presence and since man in the beginning and said God don't talk to us directly let Moses talk to us and we shall Leen so God is still using the principle amen he got a MOS for the toughest Exodus he got a William Brown for the third [Music] one so it's not William Brown's fault to tell you if you stay by these things to charge you to stay by it because he wasn't giving us the word of himself he said I was not the one that appeared at Ohio River I wasn't the pillar of fire but I was the person nearest somebody must be closer than any of us to the pillar of fire somebody must understand his words when God speaks he Thunders bow bow bow you can't make it out there must be somebody to decode the noise and the sound and give us what it says in 1964 it thundered three times all the bread and fr Suman and the rest of them had Thunder and they went to ask brother br dog and the rest of them they said what did he say he said I need to ask him if he wants me to tell you and God told him go tell them and he said it is Judgment striking the west coast and the next day Alaska almost sank beneath the ocean amen so you can't decode his language you can't see him and yet he's our captain for the journey so this is a reason he gave Moses this is is the reason he gave Paul this is the reason he gave William Braham Hallelujah so you must know why and who these people are to us so whatever the pillar of fire says Moses was to tell the people unadulterated so he not going to inject his thought or his ideas and that is the way they are to be guided into the promised land and the Bible said and the Lord LED them by way of the Red Sea doesn't that strike something to you of all the ways that are available it is the Red Sea it lets them by so when we get to the Red Sea what then so it is safe to say that this captain that we must not query or challenge but must follow him led us to a dead end you you see it's so easy to relax because you knew what happened you are reading in retrospect but picture it in yourself if you were there that day amen you that's the way to appreciate it he was leading them if it were Moses of old Moses would have been the first person to challenge it but the burning bush has made a difference because Moses before the burning Bush was so excited about serving the lord but he doesn't always care for God's timing if ISS that God was too slow or God was too callous and he took the matter up by himself and all his labor achieved one Egyptian when you take it upon yourself you will achieve only one Egyptian and you guess what you won't even be able to wait to defend your Victory you will run away when Moses ran away for 40 years who was taking care of the people he was so concerned much more than God about am you can't be ahead of [Music] God you can't be ahead of God just calm down with God nothing will ever get out of K Hall Glory H only believe all things are possible brother brah it is only said it is only impatience that we shall possess life so he was leading them he was leading them and they got to the rting there are two things you must understand if you choose to walk in your own way you must be ready to take care of your life you must be ready to offer yourself personal Security provide for your needs fight your B and do everything if you can handle it go your way but if you cannot you must go his provided way because it is only on in God's Own Way that God will be obligated to take you and your condition as his responsibility that is my encouragement to you tonight no matter how seemingly yeah the path you want to pursue is right don't ever take a step without consulting God the ways of God many times can look so hard but friends God has a purpose for everything and that is the only way you can ever come out right Hallelujah God's way God's mind God's original formula doesn't expire in God's economy Hallelujah are you with me the prophet said God has never had a new thought about anything it's original thought before it starts doing anything on the earth remains his only thought hallah so civilization and modernity will never sweep us away from God's Divine instruction the important thing I'm passing across to you tonight is that God has his own way for anything to be done am amen and this is why it took time hallelujah amen is it possible to put a scripture on the board I think Deuteronomy 30:1 19 can you please put it on the board for me please if they can put it on the board Deuteronomy 30: 19 all right now let's watch something here he said I call Heaven and Earth to record to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing stop leave it leave it that line before this Ione represent free moral agency God set it if it does not interfere with your choice he has given you your right of way to choose but do you know what God knew and still knows that you can never choose correctly you will choose curse you will choose death this is why he came to whisper with another life therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live when he began to guide and instruct you on what to do that is no more free agency that is God interfering you know why because relative to God he has his own way that he wants everything to be done amen if you want to get married he has his own way amen if you want to have a church he has his own way am you want to raise a family he has his own way even into your hner court your bedroom he has his own way way everything about our life the reason God spoke about it is because he wants to be personally obligated for your life he wants you to come to a point you can say Lord I followed your way then take care of the business are you with me wouldn't that be an easy way to push it to him amen so when they were following him they got to the Red Sea and it became a dead end K dayon and her must have had a long a field day so Moses are you sure you are seeing somebody if you really saw God say will God lead a man to dead end what's going on here nothing is going on that's the path that God chose we sing it in only believe he say your Shepherd selected the path that you must thread the path that is Select for you sometimes does not necessarily mean pleasantries it could come with challenges but guess what your anchor will be this Lord you led me here are you with me Bren I didn't come here by myself I was following your leadership you told me to do this am then you see your it so friends while they were there before you know it they saw a lot of dust Rising Hey by the time the dust set with them it was the Pharaoh and Egyptian Army so the Pharaoh's Army behind Red Sea in front on this side there were valleys and on this side there were Hills so none of these sides is an option we can safely say they came to a dead end or a close up but don't forget how they got there they got there following God's leadership Hallelujah God's part led to a close up God's part led to a dead end it LEDs to a situation that as a Believer you don't know what to do you say can God do that he still does that that is why he sent me to preach it to you are you in the dead end tonight are you in a suffocating experience youve seem to turn here you turn you turn there seem to be no way hey you have your replica in the word hallelujah Apostle Paul said the life of Abraham was an allegory or an allegory meaning a life been lived that is a forel of the life in the future amen so this dead end situation might be the forel of somebody tonight amen who seemingly is in a closeup you don't know where to turn amen stand still come now if your prophecy you know in the message identification the prophet said the challenge we do have sometimes about having faith is that we don't look into to the scripture well enough to see our character to see our experience to see our situation he said watch when that woman that we can call aunti Juma you understand we don't know her real name but the prophet say she's old enough to be called an auntie he said let us call her aunti Jima he said what gave her a miracle she was praying and at the point she started looking at the scripture to see if this my scenario had ever played out before knowing King Solomon said there is nothing new Under the Sun whatever is happening now has happened before and if there's a tomorrow it will recall again are you following and by the inspiration leadership grace of God she saw the shite woman said yes she too was Barren God gave her a baby I was Barren God give me a baby and This shamad Woman's son was some stroke or something and he died and my own son is social disease stroke and he's going to die anyway he said but then but then the sh woman got her son B then they said but wait a minute for this picture to be perfect there must be an [Applause] Elijah and tell you what this woman wasn't a message believer hallelujah look at her read your message see just unlock the principle of the scripture she said there must be an Elijah for this picture to be perfect so that the outcome could be certain then she just scamed on her seat without even prayer Lord where is your Elijah and the Lord who knew where Elijah was it's too late it's too late to tell me brother BR isn't the Elijah of this hour even the testimony of somebody who never saw the message said he was Elijah he said Lord where is your Elijah and the one who knew where Elijah Was Elijah was in a plane flying to somewhere in that plane a lot of important dignitaries might have been there some of them have been going for very important meetings that they cannot afford to miss some time of punctuality or anything but as far as God was concerned their matter did not matter are you with me Church their matter did not matter because somebody identify the in the scripture if you start identifying your character your situation in the scripture is going to elevate your faith to a level that you will just block it and it will happen and God unpluged the knot and the plane did p p p p alarm alarm alarm and the pilot said we have to do a falce landing and guess where the for landed right in Tennessee the city of that sister that wasn't a coincidence that was The Guiding of God even brother Brown didn't know why the plane landed he thought that since they have 4 hours to fix the plane he could go and post some letters and God said I didn't bring you here to do letter post keep moving the spirit told brother and he had to keep moving and the Lord went to tell that lady before day break Elijah you ask why he's coming and guess what he showed her the picture of Elijah to the dressing to the pouch he was going to carry so that the identity will not be mistaken and this woman was so convinced she went to stand outside our gate waiting for Elijah and here came Elijah walking back not knowing where he was going and Auntie Jama said good morning person said good morning huny he said you are supposed to be coming here hallelujah so you go read the rest of the story so I can save your time you knew that that woman got her son back anyway God bless you so what I'm saying is that all the situations that happen in the scripture they are forel of our whole life we to whom the end of the world has come we the completion of the entire story Paul said they without horse he was actually refering to horse we are the horse he was referring to all of them without horse is not complete in that number so whatever your situation is you might be in a close you might be in a suffocating experience life breath might be going out of you don't give up yet this is why God sent me to bring this message to give you hope that as it was then so shall it be now help will certainly come for you all you need to check is how did I get here if you got here by the leading of God stand still and you will see the salvation of the [Applause] Lord many times when we find ourself in closeups like this Satan plays on our mind even the people judge us incorrectly amen see he must have done something wrong and Satan will also be walking out at your heart pounding check yourself you see maybe it's this maybe it's that don't accept that lie it is not every closeup conditions that are occasioned by our actions Amen in the contrary they J they judged job incorrectly and for about 38 chapters of the Bible the friends we are preaching their ignorance because when the foundation of your gospel is wrong all the structure you built will be HS out and that was where when God came down after about 38 chapters of pounding when God came down he told those friends he said you have not represented me well amen your sermon was malicious you were preaching from the angle that job was a secret sinner tell you what that guy did not commit no sin Hallelujah his problem happened right from the church amen swallow it Brothers you say you say I came to church for solution and it was from Church Jo pked his problem amen amen you don't know that he got his problem from the church the Bible said when the sons of God presented them themselves what do you think that was Fellowship service God only counts male numbers there might have been sisters in the church that day oh yes and children if you see God's population counting it will say 10,000 men besides women and children that's right so it's possible in that service there were sisters there were children and everything amen and Satan also came to service is here tonight how can the devil be in the G of God's people you said Rise Up from little petty theologist the devil is here but you see you can put him in a in a state of inaction by your own attitude by the atmosphere you create it was in the church God saw the devil he was looking at his own people then he started quick he saw that he said where are you coming from where did the conversation take place it took place in the church that's why when you are sleeping and dozing away you must know that that's not the angel inspiration of the Lord somebody is responsible for that when you are in service you have your mind is somewhere else uhhuh somebody's remoting you but you can put him in a state of inaction Hallelujah in a chain of circumstance beginning from here by the right atmosphere but the right attitude what he will be here because it was in the church God and Satan had Conversation Over job so the problem of job started from the church MH is it so okay okay don't be scared because in the church that day God said have you considered my servant Jo I don't know who is going to tell who is who God is going to single have you consider my daughter or my son but you see when God chest out for you like that he is betting with his own life you know what he knows what he has placed in there amen your flesh May Fail but God in you can never will never [Applause] but the friends misunderstood it so people can misunderstand your condition but see you must have an anchor that is why you must know how you arrived at where you are if you arrive there following the leading of the Lord you ain't got nothing to fear stand still you will see the salvation of God even if if the situation presented itself GL Hallelujah like that of Lazarus sisters that it looks so obvious that it makes God indefensible do you know Mar and Mary God put them on the spot where they couldn't defend God because the facts the the exhibits the devil was presenting were clear and they look through how can a pastor forsook a church member in the hour of his need you will feel forsaken sometimes it will look as if sometimes God will turn away the attention of the brothers and the sisters they won't even ask of you and you have you are going through a terrible time and Pastor is not even checking on you raising a prayer request on you sometimes God allow those things Amen to prove you are you listening to me it might be God on The Proven block Lazarus was sick they called Pastor Jesus he was still just in Vancouver here one and a half hour slight before you know it the condition was getting was he in Toronto he got out of Toronto is in New York from New York is in the Caribbean he was so far away until when Lazarus died for him to travel down will take him for days journey coming back when barrier must have taken place and Corruption must have started so you could say Pastor Jesus was not there for that family and that family was important to him they housed him they clothed him they fed him all they could do for a Ministry they did for him but it didn't show any sign of reciprocation to even come for that man in the hour of his need he wasn't there for them but I tell you friends he came for this late and it wasn't [Music] late for you to know Jesus did it deliberately when they say he was there he said I am glad for your sakes I was not there because if when he was sick he was there and he healed him they would say he wasn't actually sick he pretended so that they can show up the reputation of Christ they can help you know repair His Image if he got there the day he died they would say he fainted he didn't actually die so he made sure he died they buried him they attended to him when he was sick the death certificate of Lazarus was in their custody and they had the photographs of the barrier so the case was clear yes even when he came he met an hostile audience but look at Mary and Mar all the tensions all the manipulations they were trying to place on them due to them never walked because they had an anle they had a Capstone Revelation that we might not be able to defend or explain the action of our pastor but as far as this Lord Jesus is concerned it can never be wrong you must come to that in your life that Christ can never be wrong that whatever he does is Right beyond all Revelation have that as a cstone revelation because there have been many things that will happen in your life that you can't explain and you can't defend Christ amen thank you Lord so if you in a suffocating experience tonight there is your picture but this is it as I wind down you know what happened because they followed God's provided way God took personal responsibility for their safety the Bible said the pillar of fire removed from the front so Moses take charge of the front and he came to stand between them and the evading hery in the message Redemption a Redemption uh in a Redemption by power the prophet said what was God doing he said this Exodus people had tasted Redemption by Blood which is the blood of the Passover for their soul salvation he said God wanted them to taste it also by power because if he can save your soul it can heal your body it can change your situation calv has it all complete those were the things God wanted to demonstrate so it stood there and it became their go between tonight is your go between it stands between you and every Death Angel there is no circumstance there's no challenge there's no problem the Lord allowed to come on your way that is designed to consume you they are only there to prove you to prove your sunship and your daughter of God they can never change you from a Believer to unbeliever they can never consume you but it has come so that you can have a greater testimony God is taking you to Higher Ground and you need character to manage achievements amen amen amen amen so it's your go between tonight am and brother Braham said you know what the devil was trying to do he was trying to cut short the life of the Exodus people prematurely he said but there can never be a premature death for God's believing children he said now you may run into it but God doesn't offer you that so it's to there and he said Moses stand there Moses when he saw these people under inspiration he said these Egyptians you saw today after today you see it noal but that wasn't Moses speaking that was what Moses yielded himself to because when Moses came back to himself he was crying the man Moses was crying but the one who was in Moses spoke you seeing the difference all right now they didn't go any other route than the path the angel LED this is why God will take personal responsibility how many ones got to be personally responsible for them aha we must go provided with a this is what I'm saying tonight so it's still there and while he still there you know what God was doing he was doing a calculation I ask this all the time how many understands physics very well how many people are good in physics here God bless you my brother is good in physics amen he's a good physic who else is good in physics I'm sure one of you here will be good in physics just raise your hand God bless you you see I'm LED I said one of them there and who else is good in physics okay at least we have our sister and we have our brother if others are shy it to hold off all right when God was there standing between the hary and his people he was doing a calculation and that calculation I want them to help us do tonight it was calculating I don't know maybe the distance the speed the velocity the time and what have you that it will take 2 million people without a constant step their pace is irregular don't forget that some are weak some were strong some were being dragged along some were being pushed some even feel they couldn't make it but Moses said we are not going to leave anybody they P everybody so we are dealing with people without regular Pace or steps so there's no constant Factor here to use you can appeal to Google tonight I give you the chance but what I want you to do for us is to give us the time it will take for this two million people to cross the Red Sea such that by the time they last person is coming out the host of Egypt entirely will be in the middle of the Red Sea for their water baptism can you please help us undo that okay sister say she can't do how about you brother you a man can you do that for us on the average no you just tell us the you don't know we we we don't understand the formula but just tell us find the aage and tell us I'm asking that for you to appreciate what God himself [Music] did are you catching it so when he was ready finishing his calculation he told Moses tell the people to go forward and they were going and they were going and they were going when it got them into a place that he knew that by the time the last person will be coming out this host don't forget the host were driving chariots they were not going to walk so their pace is going to be faster and probably uniform because if they all determined to do 100 kilm per hour it is 100 average for everybody you understand so when he finished his own calculation he told the Egyptian Army to come inside he made way for them so at some point in that walk they will have met themselves in the sea are you catching it but the Bible said at a point Pharaoh was trying to run faster with his army and God said you cannot forr my calculation the speed I allocated for you to help me achieve my him is 40 km/ hour so but they were trying to run 100 so God put speed limitter so however had the throttle is pressed 40 km you can run ahead of God and it so happened that when the last man was coming out the host of Egypt were already in the middle of the sea and sister mam and the rest pick tambourine and the Revival and the fellowship again and God said excuse me excuse me before you continue Moses close what you opened and Moses said did I not tell you people that this Egyptian you see today after now you see them [Applause] no why did God fight for Israel King David in the Book of Psalms said God fought for Israel why did God fight for Israel because they followed his provided if you want God to fight your battles if you want God to meet your needs if you want God to settle you go his provided way even when something becomes a snare God will come true for you God's will remains unchangeable and God will never repent of it do not be like David I close with this line David saw the Philistines put the Ark of God's covenant listen to me for those of us who are always looking at the world say if it works for them it could work for us there's nothing like that am I want the Believers to know that you are under a different Covenant you must know it as a revelation this is why what the word will do and get by with you won't get by with it Hallelujah there is no two ways about it God told Israel the Ark of Covenant must always be where on the shoulders of the levite but when the Philistines took it you remember in the Battle of uh uh they came against Eli and the hack of the Covenant was was taken and the two sons of Eli were killed according to prophecy amen when that Ark got to the land of Philistines they went to put it by the side of their God in the house of their hidol and God said light and darkness won't live together he made the dragon to be worshiping him they said it's a coincidence the other day he broke his scattered the dragon then they knew they had a break problem they went to consult the divers what is the reason for this they said is the hack causing your problem he said make golden M of this and that for you to know it's the one causing your problem put the AR on a new card it was by prophecy to the Philistines through their divers and God wasn't annoyed read your Bible put it on the new card and make a golden mice according to the five divisions of philistine make five and leave the ark to be going by itself if the cat goes this way is your problem if it goes this way then it's a coincidence and the ACT went the way to reveal it was their problem the Ark of the Covenant of God rode on a new cart and it landed safely back to Israel amen this was what David thought he could also do yes when he was to bring the Ark of God home he was appealing to the Pentecostal styles amen he didn't realize that he is under a different Covenant Believers you are under a different convenant God gave us the message and that is what we must follow the theme of our campaign is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Divine instructions of this message will never change the conduct the order the doctr will never change until we is our Lord Christ so don't get bored of this manner because this is what will take you into Rapture David put it on a new cat instead of the shoulders of the levite following the example of the Philistines what did it cost it caused death and it took another 20 years before they could bring the heart and David said we didn't do it according to the word of the Lord and when they now did it according to the word of the Lord it came safely God has revealed his way to us and that is by the message of the hour he sent to us a prophet with the pillar of fire with the blood of atonement we have the pillar of cloud by day we have the pillar of Fire by night we have his messenger so we will have his word am amen and we will have the blood cover Amen in our day that is the light Hallelujah walk in it don't be tired stay safe with the message and it will Le you a nice saely God bless you God bless you brother thank you brother enoy that did you enjoy that tonight God bless you tonight maybe stand with me as we close I was thinking boy he ended so soon felt like we could have gone for a while longer what a tremendous uh message tonight brothers and sisters so many thoughts so many notes out of it but I just think it's so beautiful we need to remember God has a Ed way and he's given us a manifestation of his way the way that he promised he would do it that he would send his word to a prophet and uh he just doesn't change his way and you know one of the biggest things I think I got tonight is that we need to be able to identify our character in the scripture isn't that beautiful there's nothing new Under the Sun we have problem problems we have situations but what we need to remember is that God is obligated to his people just as much as he's obligated to his word because if his people are called by his name if they call upon him and identify look you brought me here Lord he is obligated to his people what a tremendous thought and you know we could say that's brother Dall talking to us that way but that's God talking to us God wants us to remember that he is obligated to his people and if we're willing to Humble ourselves in his sight to his word then he will bless us what a tremendous message tonight you know I just uh I
