you each one who has traveling we're certainly thankful for the Lord's Tender Mercies in our lives sister Grace sister Grace has been traveling a lot recently certainly praying for her and just ask the Lord to give you a rest now have a couple of requests we'd like to bring before the church tonight one unspoken request you want to bring a request Carpenters had for a person they know I'm sorry I couldn't get a clear name but I said we would pray amen hallelujah we have another request tonight that we want to remember brother Frank kronite he needs a touch from the Lord request has been given and We Know that heaven is already aware you know the song that we just sang it just hit me when I was walking up that we could replace that word strength with faith and you know his faith starts when we can look and see how feeble we really are his faith starts when our faith ends so tonight let's just unite together in prayer for these requests as we go to the Lord in prayer if you have a need maybe just make it known with an uplift hand gracious Heavenly Father tonight we are so thankful that we can can gather together in Your Name Lord we know that there's so many places so many things that we could be doing but Lord there's something that is in the hearts of your children that constrains us to gather together in your name yes Lord because we know the scripture says where two or three are gathered together in your name you're there in the midst yes Lord so father whether you're here in this building or you're you're in a car somewhere or maybe in a living room father it doesn't matter because the building has no no no no preeminence but it's truly where we gather together in your name and father tonight we're so thankful that we can be here we just want to remember each and every request that was made known father tonight by The Uplift hand father we thank you for the needs in our lives and we know that you're more than able and father I pray that tonight the songs that we sing father wouldn't just be tradition but it would truly be an expression of the the faith in our hearts Lord towards you and father we pray that tonight we could just also remember these other requests Lord the Carpenters requests Lord thank you for saving them from a terrible accident hitting a deer Lord Jesus and helping them to find a solution for their car Lord we pray that you would touch the the person that they have a desire to to bring their their name forward Lord to bring their need we know that you're you're fully aware of it father and we just just commit that need into your hands now Lord we just want to Father we want to remember brother Frank kronite Lord and sister Pamela father the entire family tonight Lord Jesus we know that they're all watching father a man that believes you father and we know that sometimes we we find ourselves in positions that we can't even explain and we know that that's for a purpose that's for the purpose so that we will not try and have our faith our faith means nothing but Lord Jesus when your faith comes on the scene we know there's no devil in hell that can stand in our way and Lord we just pray that your will would be done in brother Frank KRON kite's life tonight Lord father that you would raise him up off that bed Lord that's our desire and father we just pray that that would be yours as well but we know that your Prophet said that we shouldn't pray to change your mind we should pray to change our mind and father we want our mind to be in line with your word because we know that your word is your will and father we don't want to try and make anything happen that you don't want and we want to see everything happen that you want to happen so tonight we just want to commit brother Frank kronite into your hands father sovereignly tonight Lord that your will would be done in his life father that it would come to pass exactly the way that you desire father we pray for each one of his children Lord that their Faith would increase Lord through this trial Lord that they would have the desire to cry out to you Lord in a greater way that they would Lord Jesus want to hear from Heaven father Lord we just pray for sister Pamela father that you would give her the strength Lord Jesus that a husband's wife needs that's going through a trial like this Lord and only the person going through a trial like this would ever know what kind of pressure what kind of pain what kind of fear what kind of anxiety would come over her but father we pray that you would just bear her up tonight on the wings of an eagle oh father that Lord as we heard your Prophet talk about that time that he needed to go and find a juniper tree Lord and how the prophet just painted that picture where you had all those angels but you said not just any Angel but the angel with the soft hands let that angel be the one to go and visit our sister tonight Lord hallelujah father that you would just comfort her amen and we pray that Lord that same Angel would comfort brother Frank Lord Lord Jesus we pray that Lord you would just be with them Father that you would Lord have your will and your way in that circumstance in that situation father tonight we just want to commit this service now into your hands father Lord For Your Glory we pray that Lord Jesus you would stop the words that you don't want spoken and father just have the preeminence to speak that which do want spoken and father give us Hearts to receive that word tonight Lord Jesus we love you and we thank you and we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you have your Bibles tonight just like to read from Revelation chapter 1 it's been a little while since we were here and uh yeah we just had two good Services I believe they're real good Services amen hallelujah brother ciz and uh had brother joose way on Sunday am I believe the Lord spoke in both of those Services Revelations 1 verse 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we're so thankful that this time is at hand and Lord that you did send and signify it by your angel to Brother John but we know that you've also done it in this age father to your bride we could say a group of people but we know that father it's not to a a a group of people it's not to a a an association or a membership father it's to your bride it's to a very elect group of people those people that have ears to hear here and tonight father we pray that you would just minister to those people with ears to hear we love you we thank you we just commit all these things now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just one announcement I wanted to make that uh brother Timothy ashong will not be here on December the 6 but he will be here on November the 29th which is next Wednesday and uh I apologize if that interferes with anybody's calendars um once again with the uh Brethren coming from Africa there's brothers that are involved in the scheduling and uh we're just one of the stops along the way and I I was asked if we could make the arrangements to change it to help the other churches the other Brethren and I just said sure we're we're flexible here I I truly want to make it easy for everyone so I hope it's all right with you that I did that but so brother Timothy asong will be here November the 29th which is next Wednesday night are you happy tonight amen um certainly excited about the word and uh I know I feel a little bit nervous and I know when that happens that something's happening there's uh there's something that doesn't want this to happen and we're just going to do it we're going to go for it we're going to trust the Lord amen we're carrying on our study with the uh the exposition of the seven Church ages and uh I just want to read from paragraph 24 kind of pick up where we left off last time brother Bram says the time is at hand and that's right out of verse verse three here I believe it is the time is at hand are you able to bring that up the exposition of the seven Church ages paragraph 24 the ending of verse three he says I'll just read verse three blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen and you know brothers and sisters the time is at hand time is here I'm not sure whether the paragraphs in this book they don't all right so if you just type in the time is at hand if you can search it it's right at the very beginning before the salutation I'll just start reading and the time is at hand he says the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom and economy of God this Mighty Revelation though fully known to God could not come forth hither to he says thus we immediately learn a principle the revelation of God for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time isn't it wonderful to think that we are at that specific time Amen to think that that Mighty Revelation is actually here and I know probably tonight I'm not I'm not saying anything we don't already know and uh I just think about what we heard last Wednesday and talking about the seals and the vials and the trumpets and the Thunders and you know there's a lot of depth to that but I believe that there's a lot of depth to this book here that we are reading and uh I personally I wonder how um how he's going to go with uh uh service number two on that because I felt like the end of that service was pretty good pretty Monumental last Wednesday so it's going to be interesting to see but you know brothers and sisters we're talking about the Revelation that we've heard about the last couple of services the revelation of Jesus Christ and that's exactly what the very first words are in the very first chapter and the very first verse of the Book of Revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ and that is the mighty Revelation that we're talking about in this age the revelation of Jesus Christ to the individual personally not a Jesus of another age not a Jesus of the future not a Jesus of the past but the Jesus of right now the Great I Am the I am not the I will be or the I was which many people tend to do and we certainly don't want to do that tonight but this is what we're talking about is the revelation of Jesus Christ paragraph 25 here or the next paragraph look at the history of Israel the the revelation of God to Moses came only at a specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people Cried unto God Jesus himself came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead and in this age leodan the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature he says think on this and heed it will for we are at the end time today just beautiful I think it's so wonderful we're going to get into the godhead tonight and uh I don't know if we'll get out of it tonight I don't know if we can ever get out of it but we're going to get into the godhead and I think that's why there's such a uh maybe a pressure or something but the salutation John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits Spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood than you and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen we know that's Revelations 1: 14-6 I didn't want to go into that too far tonight but it's just beautiful when we can read this because remember when we read scriptures like this he is the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't ever change he's is as immutable in his nature as he is in his ways he cannot change he cannot change he cannot change Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the next paragraph the word Asia is actually Asia Minor it's a small parcel of land about the size of Indiana the seven churches there were especially picked from all other churches for their characteristics which same characteristics would be found in the successive ages centuries later the seven spirits Before the Throne is the spirit that was in each of the seven Messengers giving them their Ministries for the age in which each lived now all these Expressions him which is and which was and which is to come and faithful witness and first born among the dead and Prince of the kings of the earth and the Alpha and Omega and the almighty are titles and descriptions of the one and the same person amen who is the Lord Jesus Christ am who washed us from our sins in his own blood now I'm just going to pause there for a second and just mention this and and maybe I don't know I hope nobody gets upset by it but I I watched a movie this week called Paul the Apostle and I think it's the one that came out in in 2000 it's a fairly late movie but you know if you watch that movie it's interesting in there because it depicts how they actually got away from talking about Yahweh talking about Jehovah the Mighty God and and Paul started to actually talk about Jesus and remember he was a Pharisee of Pharisees he had a lot of friends in really high places and how he actually came against them after his experience on the road to Damascus when he actually met Jesus Christ himself I don't want to preach Paul tonight but what I do want to say is it's interesting to think that he was able to start to talk about Jesus Christ as being God back there right at the very beginning of the church ages Paul started to bring the doctrine of Jesus Christ amen it was it was even before John was actually on the aisle of patmas John was was years later on the aisle of patmas Paul was preaching Jesus Christ as being God and boy did it ruffle feathers but you know it Ruffles feathers today too and you know I I I think it's interesting because how how does it ruffle feathers people get really upset when you start to talk about how the only way you're going to get the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost according to the message given to us by a Vindicated prophet in our day is to actually be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins according to acts 238 but if we are just going to say no I've only been baptized in titles and that's what I was taught and that's what my father was taught and that's what my grandmother was taught that's what our whole family was taught That's What We believe We believe that all the way along what is that I'll say it this way it's one of those Idols it's one of those Groves that we've planted nice trees around it's one of those high places where we've taken an idea and made it supersede what the word of God says because how can you actually how can you argue with the word of God to get baptized in the name of the father what's the name of the father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost titles aren't names we're going to get right into that but I just think it's beautiful Paul was bringing this before John went to the aisle of patmas the next paragraph the spirit of God in John Expresses thusly in order to set forth the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ amen ask someone if they've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and if they've been baptized in titles it's almost uh a bit of a dispute that that you'll have on your hands people don't like to be challenged on this stuff but what it what was it the spirit of God and John Expresses usly in order to set forth his Supreme deity of Jesus Christ and to reveal the godhead as one God now people who are theologians today are quick to just take and pigeon hole people that say you know the the three are one you're just Oneness but no we're not just Oneness amen we believe that God operates through three manifestations in three offices of the same person one person not three he says today there is a gross error it is that there are three Gods instead of one this Revelation as given to John by Jesus himself corrects that error amen how many times have we had errors in our life I I'm probably the king of Errors myself I have a lot of errors but you know what happens when we get an error according to the word of God all we have to do is just align ourselves with the word of God you know it's got nothing to do with a personality it's got nothing to do with a theological study or teaching it's got everything to do with the word of God but why can't people just align with the word of God some people weren't actually created to do that today there's a gross ER it's that there are three Gods instead of one this Revelation as given to John by Jesus himself corrects that error it's not that there are three Gods but one God with three offices there is one God with three titles Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm just going to go slow with this I just really want to let this sink in he said says this Mighty Revelation again we have another Mighty revelation we just read the mighty Revelation that that we immediately learned the principle that the revelation of God for each age can only come to that age and at a specific time and so now here we have a prophet of God writing this book preaching this message before he wrote this book but preaching this message that there's one God with three manifestations three different offices this Mighty Revelation is what the early church had and it must be restored in this last day amen along with the correct formula of water baptism why is that why would we have to actually be corrected why would we have to have the correct form of water baptism because if we're not baptizing correctly according to what the word of God has set out in Acts 238 if we're not doing that then we're truly not following the formula then we're not going to get the Holy Ghost and Satan knows that assuredly that we will not get the Holy Ghost we will have have an anointing we'll have an inspiration we'll have all the religious motion but if we don't get the Holy Ghost we don't have the token remember we talked about it we we know this story about the children of Israel and and and we even heard a testimony about how important it is for the father to make sure that that token's applied to the home the whole family's looking to daddy daddy have you put that token up if you don't put it up right then the death angel is at our door we're going to die think about the pressure the Daddy has we know we can't play we have to make sure that we got that token and that's what this Mighty Revelation is is entitling us to the Token because what is it full obedience to what the complete word of God entitles us to the token and anything else is going to be a derivative it's going to be something that's just a little bit different a little bit off we're not going to have the right thing and Satan knows that and Satan's going to play with that he's going to have a Heyday with that we're going to think that we've got the Holy Ghost and actually not that's no place to be we don't want to be there that that way but this Mighty Revelation is is what the early church had and it must be restored in this last day isn't it wonderful to know that we've been given the direction we've been given the instruction we've been given a Vindicated Prophet someone that would actually be showing mankind showing the world that God is with him and not just to get healed and not just to have a wonderful time and say he's a great man of God let's let's let's let's praise the Lord and have great meetings but let's get back to the right formula of water baptism let's get right back to the middle of the road with the word of God let's see the restoration of the word for our day amen two Mighty Revelations we've read now get that correct formula of water baptism then we get the token then we could apply that token brother bradam says it in the token that when we can take that token and we can actually hold it over over our prayers and we can say I know that my flesh I can't hold my flesh over my prayers my flesh this this is the Beast nature right here this is genetically flawed I can't hold that over my prayers but oh my I can take the token and know that I've got the Holy Ghost and say you know what I I don't know anything about anything and I just take this token and I actually make this what I put over my prayers if we want to see whether we've got the Holy Ghost are we willing to Humble oursel to the word of God that's one of the sure signs whether we've got the holy ghost or not if we're not willing to Humble ourselves to the word of God brothers and sisters then I would have to say I don't know whether we've got the Holy Ghost in our lives but if you've got the desire for the holy ghost in your life then simply humble yourself to the word of God follow the instructions of the word of God and you will get the token you'll get the Holy Ghost in your life pram goes on to say now modern theologians won't agree with me for here is what is written in a great Christian magazine that that teaching on the Trinity is at the very heart and core of the Old Testament it's every wit as much at the heart of the and core of the New Testament the New Testament is just as much opposed as the Old Testament is to the thought that there are more Gods than one yes yet the New Testament with equal clearness teaches that the father is God and the son is God and the Holy spirit is God and that these three are not three aspects of the same person but three persons standing in a truly personal relationship to one another there we have the great doctrine of the three persons but one God they also State God according to the Bible is not just one person but he is three persons in one God that is the great mystery of the Trinity I I I had never encountered this before in my life until just recently this year I actually met someone who is a theologian who who really really challenged me on this I love the way brother badam says this I got to stop getting in the middle of it here he says they also State God according to the Bible is not just one person but he's three persons in one God that is the great mystery of the Trinity he says it sure is how can three persons be in one God not only is there no Bible for it but it shows even a lack of intelligent reasoning yes sir that's pretty strong yes sir but I just think it's it's beautiful because we could say show us anywhere in the Bible show us anywhere in the Bible where they baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost there was a commission to go and do that but show us where that happened the unic wasn't baptized in the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost the Ethiopian unic he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ three distinct persons though identical substance make three gods or language has lost its meaning entirely just listen to these words again I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and ending saith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty this is deity this this is not simply a prophet a man this is God and it is not a revelation of three Gods but of one God the almighty Hallelujah you know I I heard something this last couple weeks I can't even remember where exactly when it was I heard it but you know the Alpha and Omega for those people that don't know that's the beginning and the ending of the Greek language Alpha is the beginning Omega is the ending the A and the Z there is actually a letter in there and it's Iota and I think it's just beautiful because you know we can't actually deviate one iota from the word of God right and you know it goes even further for the people who are truly the elected they can't deviate one iota from the word of God through a Vindicated Prophet because if we deviate one iota brothers and sisters we're going to be out yes sir we're not going to actually hit that Mark that we're looking to hit yes sir so he's the Alpha and the Omega and every single thing in between I haven't studied it but I just heard that one thing ioda one iota one little speck one little part boy we don't want to be off we want to make sure that we know exactly where we stand goes on to say they didn't believe in three gods in the beginning of the church you can't find that sort of belief amongst the apostles it was after the apostolic age that this Theory came in and really became an issue and a cardinal Doctrine at the nyine council the doctrine of godhead caused a two-way split at NAA and and we know that was in in 324 325 Ad nian Council actually I apologize yeah 325 ad I just got a little note about it the first Council of NAA 325 the first ecumenical council of the Christian church meeting in ancient NAA now is Nick turkey it was called by the emperor Constantine 1 an unbaptized cuman who presided over the opening session and took part in the discussions he hoped to General Council of the church would solve the problem created in the Eastern Church by arianism and her a heresy first proposed by Aras of Alexandria that affirmed that Christ is not Divine but a created being Pope Sylvester I did not attend the council but was represented by the gates so it's definitely there in the history we can look it up and and go a whole lot further with it I don't really intend to I I believe anyone who is interested can certainly do that but we know that it's actually uh a real thing it's out of the history books it's not just something that somebody brought we can't just say that maybe William Ari and brandham brought this idea that there was a a nine Council this is history that we're talking about here we know that it caused a two-way split at Nia and from that split there came two extreme extremes one actually went into polytheism that's three believing in three gods and the others went into Unitarianism one that's that's the one God Oneness of course that was a little while and coming about but it did and we have it right today but the Revelation through John by the spirit to the churches was I am the Lord Jesus Christ and I am all of it there isn't any other God and he put his seal on this re reation he sent his Angel and signified it unto his servant John it's so beautiful and we can say that's happened to us in our day it's just a wonderful thing you know I just can't help but think this is just an exact example of the horse riders we heard a bit about it last Wednesday the horse riders you know it starts out as a Doctrine as a discussion and then it turns into a manifestation naturally speaking it goes into government the church is State become one then they turn into the horse riders we could go into that I don't really want to go too far with that but you can see it happening here after the apostles had left the scene uh carrying on it says consider this who was the father of Jesus such a good discussion Matthew 1:18 says she was found with child of the Holy Ghost but Jesus himself claimed that God was his father God the the father and God the Holy Ghost as we often express these terms make the father and the spirit one indeed they are or else Jesus had two fathers but notice that Jesus said that he and his father were one not two that makes one God we've got to be able to read between the lines when you read the word of God we can't just take the word of God and read it literally and and feel like it's just going to actually make sense like we would read a book and and study our way into it it won't happen the next paragraph since this is historically and scripturally true people wonder where the three came from it became a foundational Doctrine at the nyine council 325 ad this Trinity an absolutely unscriptural word was based upon the many gods of Rome the Romans had many gods to whom they prayed they also prayed to ancestors as mediators it was just a step to give new names to old gods so we have saints to make it more biblical thus instead of Jupiter Venus Mars Etc we have Paul Peter Fatima Christopher etc etc they could not make up their Pagan religion work out with just one God so they split him up into three and they made intercessors of the Saints as they had made intercessors of their ancestors I had to pause there and just take a look at it and I know that there's intercession of the Saints it's in the Apostles Creed it's in the nian Creed there's Creeds for both of those and we know that intercession of the Saints is praying to the people who have already gone on thinking that they would actually be able to do something for us and uh it it's it's it's amazing actually that uh that they do it but it's it's it's prevalent I actually looked it up in uh I looked it up and it's quite prevalent amongst churches today and uh it's just in there it's just one of those things that's in there it's on their website and uh you can see what they believe about us you you just want to see if a church is trinitarian you can just click on that about us and you'll see the Apostles Creed in there you know they're trinitarian that's where they stand that's what they believe and you know we could go into a circumstance like that brother and sisters and we could sit in a church like that and we could hear preaching that would be anointed preaching in in a circumstance or a situation like that but you know what could happen in a circumstance or situation like that Spirits travel on Words and unless you're actually feeding at the right table unless you actually know right where you stand you're going to have spirits that are going to get on you and get in you and get around you and cause tremendous turmoil in your life amen we certainly don't want to put ourselves in a position like that I just think this uh this book is amazing we don't want to be having intercession of saints we don't want to be praying to the people who have gone on and who are dead we don't believe in spirit spirituality we don't believe in any of that stuff we believe in the Holy Ghost in one God manifesting in our lives the next paragraph says ever since then the people have failed to realize that there is just one God with three offices or manifestations they know there is one God according to the scripture but they try to make it the Fantastic theory that God is like a bunch of grapes three persons with the same Divinity shared equally by all but it plainly says here in Revelation that Jesus is that which is that which was and that which is to come he is the Alpha and Omega which means he is the A to Z or the all of it amen and I want to say everything in between he is everything the almighty he is the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the Bright Morning Star the righteous Branch the Father the Son the Holy Ghost he is God almighty God one God Amen one God goes on to say and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into Glory 1 Timothy 3:16 it's true without controversy great is the mystery of godliness isn't it wonderful to hear that to look at that amen without controversy great is the mystery of godliness so just pause there for a little bit without controversy brothers and sisters great is the mystery of godliness in your lives to this world around people look at us and think what's wrong with you you're you're crazy there's something different about you why do you behave the way that you do and and maybe even Fanatics for believing what you believe turn over with me to Colossians 2 still have a few minutes here Colossians chapter 2 that a scripture come on my heart as we were as I was studying this here great is the mystery of godliness amen Colossians chapter 2 verse 1 for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at leoda and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all Riches of the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ in whom are are HID all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words for though I be absent in the flesh yet I am with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ as ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily I don't understand how anybody could dispute the fact that Jesus Christ was God especially since it's right there in the word amen in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily in his body in his flesh brother Bram says this is what the Bible says it doesn't say a thing about first or second or third person here it said God it says God was manifest in flesh one God that one God was manifest in flesh that ought to settle it God came in human form that didn't make him another God he was God the same God it was a revelation then and it's a revelation now one God brothers and sisters if we can see this I just want to say this tonight if we can see this if we can understand this don't take this for granted this is this is a a tremendous Revelation th this is one of the greatest Revelations that we could ever get he goes on to say let's go back in the Bible and see what he was in the beginning according to the Revelation he gave of himself the great Jehovah appeared to Israel and Pillar of Fire as the angel of the Covenant he lived in that Pillar of Fire and led Israel daily isn't it wonderful how he talks like this yes sir how many people have seen that Pillar of Fire picture in our day as the angel of the Covenant Covenant he lived in that Pillar of Fire and led Israel daily and at the temple he announced his coming with what a great cloud and then one day he was manifest in a virgin born body that was prepared for him I just just can't help but think brothers and sisters I want to preach here now this is getting me fired up when you look at this here he's talking about how Israel was led by a pillar of Fire by night right in the evening time it shall be light you'll have a pillar of fire we can see that this is the evening time we've had a pillar of fire in our day we know that first there was a pillar of fire then there was a great Cloud that came in 1963 that great Cloud announced something it wasn't just something fantastic that happened on top of a mountain in Arizona that could create a bunch of of of of pyramid-shaped rocks that people could get as paper weights brothers and sisters that was something that he's talking about right here first a pillar of fire then he announced his coming with a great Cloud then one day he was manifest in a virgin born body don't take that and put that off on Mary somewhere in past he is the same yesterday today and forever brothers and sisters if you've taken this word of the message of the hour through a Vindicated Prophet into your womb you are that virgin for today he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and that thing that's born inside of you is of the Holy [Music] Ghost yes I then one day he was manifest in a virgin born body that was prepared for him have you been prepared for him the god that tabernacled above the tents of Israel now took on himself a tent of Flesh and tabernacled as a man amongst men but he was the same God Amen don't put them off somewhere else brothers and sisters bring them right home bring them home and say right here he's created that little space in this heart for himself and when I took that word into my womb into that little spot that made me a virgin because only a virgin can receive that word everyone else in the world is going to say it's crazy it's fanaticism it's a cult it's some other thing but there's only a few people that are going to be able to say amen that's my word that's coming into my word womb I'm going to take that word inside of me we know that animals they search out for the right genetics before they will actually reproduce they want healthy the Bride of Jesus Christ is the same nothing will satisfy her except for that word that pure word of God and when she gets that into her womb something happens brothers and sisters something happens it changes us we become a new creature in Christ Jesus amen the Bible teaches that God was in Christ the body was Jesus in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily period I love that nothing can be pler than that mystery yes but actual truth it can't be pler so if he wasn't three people then he can't be three now one God and this same God was made flesh Jesus said in John 16: 27-28 I came from God and I go back to God that is exactly what happened he disappeared from Earth by way of his death burial and resurrection and Ascension but then Paul met him on the road to Damascus oh my I just I'll throw this plug in there again brothers and sisters if you want to see the visual you got to watch that movie it's good it's really good when you look at it through the filter of the message it's really good it's a good show if you're going to watch something watch something that edifies us the word of God nothing can be plainer than that mystery yes but actual truth it can't be pler so if he wasn't three people then he can't be three now one God and the same God was made flesh sorry I went back too far Jesus said in in John 1627 and 28 I came from God I go back to God that's exactly what happened he disappeared from Earth by the way of his death burial resurrection and Ascension then Paul met him on the road to Damascus and he spoke to Paul and said Saul Saul why persecutest thou me Paul said who art thou Lord M and he said I'm Jesus why didn't he say I'm God he said I'm Jesus he was a pillar of fire yes a blinding light he had turned back exactly as he said he would back to the same form that he was before he took on a tabernacle of Flesh yes sir that's exactly how John saw it how do you see it tonight brothers and sisters don't tell me as we heard on Sunday don't tell me you look at brother bradam and you see God tabernacled in flesh that was elzer he came and he did his job and that was to introduce a bride to Jesus Christ that's why he was here not so that we could worship him not so that we could pilgrimage to his place and and say that we were followers of voice of God and all of that be followers of Christ I saw a clip and if anybody's interested you might have seen it already I don't know but it's a brother I I can't even remember his name he preaches and he says why it's titled why I left the message and he says basically in nutshell you never met the message you don't have the message if you left the message because you're the message when you've taken the message that William Bram brought it's Jesus Christ how could you leave Jesus Christ right that's what the message is oh my no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him amen hallelujah just talking about this godhead bodily I just want to pause there for a second in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same one today that was there then on the road to Damascus that was there when Jesus Christ went on the cross was there the same one when he was Elohim before he even was God before the world was ever into existence when he was the self-existing one the same one who is here tonight dealing with us amen all the fullness out of the message the Rapture brother Bram says I've always preached that he was deity not just a man he was God manifested In the Flesh God the attribute of god of love amen isn't it interesting because he didn't come and actually Scorn the people he came and straightened out the religious Pious ones the ones who felt like they were something because of something they've achieved but the ones that he came for were the ones that were adulterers or or or prostitutes or drunkards all of the people in the world that really needed someone to come and help them that's who he came for that was deity and what did he do he brought love to them he was the attribute of god of love the great attributes that come down display laid here on Earth of God Jesus was God's love which built a body that Jehovah himself lived in he was the fullness of the godhead bodily what God was he manifested through that body that body had to die so he could wash the bride with his blood amen hallelujah it couldn't be a separate person if it was a separate person there wasn't a perfect sacrifice that were lost as lost can be God's only provided place of worship 1965 God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age today his sons in the word age quickened by the Spirit light a spark that's lit off something to make it alive you become a new creature in Christ Jesus when that spark goes down into that womb and seated now in Heavenly places in present tense Satan's going going to say no you're not look at you're sitting right here in this church here and a few minutes you're going to go and jump in your vehicles and you're going to be seated there then you're going to go home and you're probably going to sit on your couch you're going to be seated there we're going to look at this flesh and we're going to say yeah I'm seated here look at this problem I'm seated in the middle of this problem yep but that's not what the word says brothers and sisters we got to look past all this flesh we got to look past all of this distraction we've got here on Earth and realize the word of God says that we're already seated in Heavenly places that means that you can't lose brothers and sisters what would you do if you couldn't fail because you can't and seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to every promise in the word then what does that do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men a part of God's word seated together manifest the entire body of Christ amen are we manifesting the entire Body of Christ tonight oh my you know I'll stand here and say I don't feel like it but that doesn't matter the Vindicated Prophet said that I am and I'm willing to take his word for it amen I had a brother say to me you know we were talking about this we're having some fellowship about the prophet and the Vindication of the prophet and how we have ideas and and theories and he said it like this to me one day if we were to look at this wall and say that it's a tan and maybe we just have the scientific code name for it and and we can look at it and everybody could agree that that wall there is 10 with that scientific number and the paint code that you could get paint matched everybody understands what I'm talking about right that wall is a specific color if the prophet of God said that was a purple wall even though every sense in my body could see that it's a tan colored wall I would call that wall purple because that's what the Vindicated Prophet said and you know we got to be willing to do that brothers and sisters we got to go beyond our senses our emotions our feelings our flesh we got to go Way Beyond all of that and just say Amen to the word of God because that's the only thing that's going to change our bodies other men AP part of God's word seated together manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you we all know what Lev is we'll preach on that one day it's a real good study see what he's talking about brother Brown no leaven among you just the word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he put his name Jes Jesus Christ no man will come unto the father except by who except by Me Jesus speaking there brother randam goes on to say no 11 among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you right so beautiful love that the revelation of Jesus Christ now remember this is the Revelation and whosoever heareth it and don't keep the sayings of this book his part will be taken from The Book of Life Jesus is not revealing himself as three Gods but one God and three offices oh it's going to get rich after a while when we get into those Church ages and see where they lost that caused a great split in I and Council both of them went off on two deep ends and this is where I want to get to tonight brothers and sisters and they done the same thing in this last days again just like the preying Council again CU there will be another one just as certain as I'm standing here the Catholic and Protestant churches will unite something together or agree with one another I I just want to say this I've said it in the past and maybe I'll I'll send it out I was going to try and play it tonight but I won't I'll send it out on on the what's happened if you want to watch it you can the the the Tony Palmer uh encounter and you can see the Vindication of the Prophet talking because that actually is already happened this isn't something that's going to be happening in the future maybe when the whole world is falling apart this world is going to blow up and and and then there's going to be a new nyine Council the prophet of God said there's going to be a new one and it's already happened it's already history we are so far down the road right now if anybody wonders about what's going on in in Palestine in Israel and and Gaza take a look at the book of of Amos read the very beginning of the Book of Amos and see what Amos had to say about Gaza maybe it was a few thousand years but boy it's the word of God we're not saying that this is something that we're saying and we don't want to see someone in a bad spot we're not saying anything we're just saying this is the word of God and we can recognize the day in which we live we live in perilous times brothers and sisters but isn't it good to know we've got the token there's a desire in our hearts when we have an issue when we have a problem we always want to just line up with the word of God our bodies Our flesh our minds are always going to take us contrary to the word of God but that token inside of us is going to say no realign re-calibrate that Compass just come back just get back on track again brother bam goes on to say and theyve done that same thing in this last days again just like a preene council again because there will be another one just as certain as I'm standing here the Catholic and Protestant churches will Unite something together or agree with one another look at the Archbishop Mur over there now all of its heaping right up together and there is not a Triune God teaching in the Bible there's one God one God I was going to get into uh I was going to get into a little bit in Colossians maybe we'll get there I'll just continue reading on in the church age book here brother bam says he was born the Christ and eight days later when he was circumcised he was named Jesus even as the angel had told them I just think this part is so significant this just this just clenches it doesn't it I was born of brandom he says when I was born they gave me the name of William he was Christ but he was given a name down here among men and what is Christ the scent one right we know that that's what that is Christ is a sent one he was sent but he had to be given a name among men that outward Tabernacle men could see was called Jesus he was The Lord Of Glory the almighty manifest in flesh he is God the Father Son and Holy Ghost he is all that Father Son and Holy Ghost are just titles they are not names that is why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for that is a name not a title it is the name of those titles so clear maybe it sounds confusing and it's just worth getting this and reading it maybe a couple times it's the name of those titles the name of the Lord Jesus Christ just like you take a newborn baby who is a son and you name him baby is what it is son is the title and you name him John Henry ba Brown you don't just baptize in jesus' name there are thousands of Jesus jesuses in the world and have been even before Jesus our savior but there is only one of them born the Christ Lord Jesus Christ amen let's turn over to oh we're already there yeah sorry I I wanted to get into this a little further amen in uh Colossians and we might have to pick this up later I don't want to keep us late brother Bram says people talk about Jesus being the Eternal Son of God now isn't that a contradiction who ever heard of a son being Eternal sons have Beginnings but that which is eternal never had a beginning he is the Eternal god Jehovah manifested in the flesh St John's gospel it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the word was was made flesh and dwelt among us and we know that that was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but out of Colossians 2:8 I just wanted to read this here beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ because for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhe head bodily isn't it interesting because we can look at verse 9 and say for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily but the verse right before it says something really really important beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and what and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ the reason he's saying that that is because people will do it men will come around and spoil you through philosophy and they will spoil you through vain deceit after the tradition of men and after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ that's why this warning is there right before that verse talking about the godhead I think it's amazing so I took a look at this here philosophy I'll try and go quickly here the word philosophy just looked it up a little bit is the study of fundamental nature of knowledge real ity and existence especially when considered as an academic discipline fine take the word of God and make it an academic discipline hey then we become the theologians then we might as well go to Seminary we might as well accept the doctrine that they're going to give us it's kind of like going to University you know there's a a great debate on whether you should send children to go to university or not and I would I've never gone to University so maybe I'm going to get jumped on when I leave the building here but I'm going to say it anyway cuz I feel led to there's something important that's taught in universities and it's called critical thinking right it's called being able to think and reason for yourself and when you go to university they teach you a way to think and to reason I know that much and when that happens you cannot take that and apply it to the word of God if you try and do that you're going to get the wrong results amen the only way this word is going to be revealed to us is by the spirit word of God says beware beware that people are going to try and spoil you not just going to not just going to lead you away or make you confused spoil you through philosophy the study of fundamental nature of knowledge and reality in existence especially when considered as an academic discipline a particular system of philosophical thought don't want to get into that there's another one that says it's the study of a theoretical basis of a particular branch of knowledge or experience the philosophy of science and you know I've seen it where people can take and make this particular branch of knowledge or experience and and apply it to the philosophy of the Bible the philosophy of the word and say well it's my opinion I I can philosophy philos I don't even know the word I can make it my own opinion and and we can go on and on and on about that vain deceit out of strongs it means empty delusion Bain deceit you're going to have empty delusions and it just made me think about Ephesians chapter 4 this I say therefore and testifying the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having their understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that's in them because of the blindness of their heart right who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness brothers and sisters but ye have not so learned of Christ if we've heard the message of the hour if we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we have not so learned of Christ we're not doing this as a vain philosophy or a tradition you know tradition just a simple description of it is the transmission of Customs or beliefs from generation to generation or the fact of being passed on in this way this is what we believe maybe it's a little bit outside of what the prophet of God said but you know what we still have everything good in our lives we're not sick God's not punishing us everything is good we got a great job all these things are happening in our lives don't look at the natural brothers and sisters look at where we're going are we seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because if we are we're going to follow the word of God and we're not going to deviate not one iota off of the message of the hour amen sometimes we can just take and and make a tradition and just pass it down to our children if we're not careful my goodness as parents we're going to answer for these things we're going to answer for these things it's important for us to make sure that we know where we stand oh my and you know what's it's really interesting is I've just really had this on my heart is um brother brandom said it what did the Catholic church say give us a child till when age five my goodness all my kids are past age five did I do it right I still have time I think I still have hope I want to make sure that they're not deviating not one iota off the word of God off the message of the hour amen right we're not careful we can get spoiled by these things brothers and sisters the rudiments of the world is is just simply it's the simplest and most basic facts about a subject or an activity we can say that we're just going to take the rudiments of the message we're going to take the rudiments of the word of God maybe I'm going to leave the message aside and just take the rudiments of the word and say Jesus only well you're not going to have Jesus if you don't come according to the word of God through a Vindicated Prophet amen I'm going to read this this this verse here I'll call the musicians as we close tonight I'm going to I'm going to read this verse out of the Amplified Bible it's it's verse 8 and N of Colossians chapter 2 see to it that no one carries you off as spoil can you imagine that and we know that it's Devils that will do it but see to it that no one carries you off as spoil or makes you yourselves captive by his so-called philosophy and intellectualism and vain deceit idle fantasies and plain nonsense following human tradition you know there's so much idle fancies and and plain nonsense in the world even around Christianity we can see it and and you know it's interesting to see how there's many many movements we know that it came after the prophet was in the land after thus sayeth the Lord the real thus sayith the Lord was in the Land There was all these Faith healing minist mines now there's tremendous Ministries even now today someone can just wave their coat and 25 people 50 people 100 people will just fall over and people will say wow that's a great move of God but do they actually line up with the word are they willing to take thus saith the Lord in their lives what's happened is they've actually been spoiled they've been Carried Away by some wind of Doctrine someone's come along and given them some kind of fantastic yeah see to it that no no one carries you off as spoil or makes you yourselves captive by his so-called philosophy and intellectualism and vain deceit idle fancies and plain nonsense following human tradition men's ideas of the material rather than the spiritual world just crude Notions following the rudimentary and El Elemental teachings of the universe and disregarding the teachings of Christ the Messiah I I just love reading this through the Amplified Bible because I know that just takes me right back to the message of the hour right back to the message of the hour and it doesn't take me off on some tangent and I know some folks say the the the Amplified is maybe a little funny because someone maybe who shouldn't be writing it did and I I I don't want to bring anything I I don't want to bring anything that's going to lead us astray brothers and sisters follow the word of God follow the message of the hour follow the thus sayith the Lord for today and we won't go wrong we we we just don't want to be disregarding the message and God only speaks to an age as we read earlier on he only speaks to an age through a prophet only that tremendous Revelation can come at a at a very specific time and if we have the ability to hear the message of the hour today brothers and sisters we have made it we have the greatest gift that we could ever get the only thing we need to do is just beli that's it and then we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus maybe stand with me tonight as we close we'll continue to speak on this as we carry on but I I just think it's so beautiful how we can study this book there's so much in there God bless you tonight let's pray gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the the mighty Revelations that you've given us Lord to recognize who we are and where we stand to know that father there's nothing good in us except for your spirit and father if there's anything that would Lord come against your word if there's anything in our lives that would father challenge your word father help us Lord to Humble ourselves yes Lord in your sight Lord Jesus father that you could lift us up father we know that there's only one way we're going to be lifted up and that's to Humble ourselves and father we just pray that we could Lord not deviate from your word not one iota not one one Speck Lord Jesus because we know a little bit of Leaven will leaven the whole lump and father we just pray that Lord your spirit would be what takes over our beings that it wouldn't be leaven father tonight I pray that you would just be with your children be with each one who's come out tonight be with those who couldn't be here tonight father maybe traveling or at home maybe ill father whatever the the need or the circumstance we pray that you would just touch them Father that you would lead them and encourage them Father we pray that you would just give us traveling mercies as we go home tonight father and if it Be Your Will
