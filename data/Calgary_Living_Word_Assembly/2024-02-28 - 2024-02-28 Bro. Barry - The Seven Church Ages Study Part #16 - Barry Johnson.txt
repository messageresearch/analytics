father Lord It's humbling it's not it's not puffing it's humbling Lord entirely because we recognize we had nothing to do with it at all from the beginning Lord Jesus tonight we just ask that you would just be glorified now in all that's said and done we just commit each need into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians God bless you if you have your Bibles tonight I'd like to read from Revelations chapter 2 as we carry on our journey in the exposition of the seven Church ages Revelation Chapter 2 is the beginning of the word through Revelation to John the Revelator from that one who was standing in the midst of the candlesticks with the Seven Stars in his hand with the Flames of of fire for his eyes and feet as brass and my what a depiction that one he's giving the uh he's given the word to the churches now in Revelations chapter 2 so Revelations chap 2 verse one says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou c not bear them which are evil and how thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and Hast found them liars and Hast borne and Hast patience and for my names sake has labored and Hast not fainted nevertheless I have some what against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nians which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we're so thankful for your word and we're so thankful that we can read this scripture Lord Jesus and and read it by Revelation Lord knowing that you have intended for us to to really understand what this means that you have not left it undone it was for many many years but we know now it's revealed to those who you've chosen and tonight father I just want to ask that Lord Jesus in this service you would just do something special for us Lord we have so many needs as we've already mentioned but Lord Jesus let us go beyond the needs in our lives and let us just have True Fellowship with you tonight Lord let us have true communion with you father just a real relationship Lord where we're not just coming to you and and asking for things Lord where we can just Lord know you as you are we just ask that we could commit the rest of the service into your hands For Your Glory now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated just some announcements before we go too far certainly um excited about March it's a busy month in many ways not just around the church and the activities but um just an overview we have here a skating party at bones Park on Friday night at 7 pm for those who can come and uh for those who aren't aware there is a a chat that's set up for activities in the church if you want to be a part of that um just let us know and we can make sure that you're a part of it so um yeah we have that set up it's uh going to be communicated anything that we are doing for activities like that will be communicated uh through that chat uh or in just simple conversation but we're not going to use the main Calgary Living Word chat group that we have I really would like to use that for uh pertinent Church matters uh pertaining to spiritual things specifically if somebody has a prayer request it's an easy way to mention it to the whole entire body that there is a need and it can get to people right away and I really don't want to see it get clogged up with uh too many quotes of scripture or what's resting on people's hearts that sort of thing we can chat individually but uh we just want to keep that line of communication open for uh matters that we need to communicate very quickly so that's why we have this uh this activities chat created so we have the the skate happening at bones Park this Friday at 7M um before that we have the men's meeting happening tomorrow evening at the church here so that will be at uh 7:30 downstairs in the basement um I just love looking over the the month of March the 10th of March is daylight savings time that's where we lose an hour we Spring Forward we set our clocks one hour ahead so that happens on uh the 10th and then the 19th which is not very far after that is the first day of spring we're actually going to be entering into the spring months now it's uh it's amazing it feels like we haven't even really experienced winter here yet because we haven't had that much snow usually we get a lot more but um so we're already entering into spring this month near the middle of the month it's pretty amazing so the 21st uh we've got a prayer meeting scheduled for 7:30 at the church on the 22nd we have an indoor arena skate half of the Arena will be uh for just skating around if you just want to skate and the other half will be for those people who like stick and pucks if you'd like to uh I don't know if there's such a thing as half court in hockey um maybe someone like Logan could help educate us but we're going to play hockey on one end of the rink and uh we're just going to skate around the other end of the rink so that will be on the 22nd the 24th at 6 PM we're going to have communion service here and uh that's actually Palm Sunday I think it's a a real good thing that we could just have a communion service then and uh maybe in preparation for the Easter services we have Brother David dehart I think I mentioned I have confirmed he's coming and that will be on the 29th the 30th and the 31st we're going to have uh service 7:30 p.m. Friday the 29th 6:00 p.m. on the 30th and uh 10:00 a.m. on the 31st and uh going into April we have a gym night booked on April the 6th um actually it's a gym day I'm going to have a gym night in the day I guess that will be uh April the 6th from 1: to 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon just to try something a little different to see if it's uh easier for folks or more difficult um we're certainly flexible to do things so that we can make it as convenient for everyone as possible but we just thought we'd try something different um we were able to participate in a a gym day in Saskatchewan when we went out there and it was really quite nice to do it during the day so we'll just see what happens there and then August we have have brother Andrew Glover coming August 16th 17th and 18th again it'll be a Friday evening a Saturday evening and a Sunday morning service so uh you'll be able to find those events all on the calendar and uh I trust that's going to be okay for everyone tonight are you happy tonight I just was uh thinking and I hadn't said anything I I I think that we are in what they call a leap year this year typically this is the end of the month today February 28th um the shortest month of the year but tomorrow we actually have one more day so um some folks are either lucky enough or unlucky enough to be born on the 29th of February and that means they get a birthday once every four years which is kind of difficult to imagine but I know there's other ways to celebrate it than waiting every four years but you have to imagine there'd be quite a gift if you had to wait every four years for a present but uh anyways picking up where we left off in the exposition of the seven Church ages um we left off on page 72 and I I just I don't know I just can't help but get excited every time I get into this it just seems to get good and good better and better um when you see what God was saying to his people through the prophet and uh how he wanted to express it in this book so that would understand it that there would be no questions if we really read this book and we really meditate upon the words that are said here how it always points back to scripture and how important it is if we're going to be a Christian why would we want to settle for some other Avenue to be a Christian other than the word of God but we know many times there's uh there's a lot of antichrist behavior and maybe that sounds really sharp but you know anything that it's not according to the word of God is Antichrist that's the way it is it's either yes or it's no it's one or it's zero it's not uh uh many different shades of Christianity which is what the devil has tried to do and you know here we're getting into the the the the Ephesian Church age and brother brandham really begins to lay out what really happened and and why we have all of these differing opinions and why we have all of the the many different versions of what we would potentially call Christianity but there really only is one Christianity and that word Christian means Christlike and the only people that are Christlike are the ones that take the full word of God without measure without watering it down or trying to take and and make it say something different maybe take a different version of the Bible and say well I know the prophet of God read from the King James version but I really like this one you know what we need to do is just push aside all of our own thinking and just allow the mind that was once in Christ Jesus Come into us because once his mind comes inside of us then we'll start to look at things the way that he's fully intended for us but you know where we left off um paragraph 26 on page 72 of the exposition of the seven Church ages brother brother Bram is talking about the the different different revivals that had happened and you know first paragraph 25 he talks about the Welsh Revival and and how what happened was every time that God moved so did Satan there's always twins brother Bram says not here in this paragraph but every time there was a great move of God the devil moves also and and this day and age is no different and that's what he's bringing out here but he says in the great Welsh Revival the insane asylums filled up quickly and there was a great display of devil power to take away the attention from God in paragraph 26 in Luther's day it said that the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he successfully protested the Roman Catholic church but the miracle lay in the fact he could and did stay sound and sane amidst the Fanatics who are often filled with and guided by wrong spirits and you know brothers and sisters those Spirits were not necessarily raging monster evil demon Spirits I'll say they're very highly polished religious Spirits Christian impersonating spirits that would get in amongst the Believers brother bam goes on to say and if you have been aware of this last day Ministry his ministry Christ's Ministry through him you will have noted the same invasion of false and wicked Spirits it has to be that way am it's amazing because I I I I myself don't know much about the message of the hour I would say I I I I came into the message I didn't even hear about the message of the hour until 2005 and so I mean that's a few years but there's other people here that have known about it way longer than I have and we know that there's no such thing as Apostolic succession or or or greater position in the Kingdom because we've known about the message longer we're not saying that but what I am saying is there has the stories that I've heard just since 2005 about people who have been given the opportunity to have a Ministry in this message of the hour and how they've taken it and perverted it and perverted it for their own sakes take it and twisted it and destroyed people's lives watch people go literally insane because of the way they mishandle this word of God brother brandom he talks about the three-sided club and how he had that Vision remember he saw that man that big strong man how he was taken this club and there was this woman and every time she would start to gather her strength while she was on the ground she would come to her feet tried to get on her feet again and every time she would get up and start to become strong again what did that man do he'd take that three-sided club and he called it a trinitarian club three-sided and he would clobber her with it knock her right back down you know that's a nickan spirit but that happens it's amazing because all of that is around the guise of this message of the hour that's why it's so important brothers and sisters if I was to maybe get hit by a bus and never be here again and you can't rely on brother Barry to lead you and guide you you've got to know where you stand you got to eat this book yourself you got to know the message of the hour yourself because if another Minister were to come into the church and begin to minister how would you know if he was preaching truth or not you got to know where you stand we might not live here maybe we move somewhere else maybe we have another Pastor another church how do you know if he's preaching the truth you have have to know there's a lot of invasion of false and wicked spirits and brother bradam says it has to be that way he says now I hope and trust you are spiritual minded enough to get that and capitalize on it that means get the Holy Ghost capitalize on it know that those Spirits are going to be so close they would deceive the very elected if people claim to know the message of the hour claim to be on fire for the Lord then they're going to live this word of God they're going to live the message of the hour they're not just going to hide behind it but starting with our our new new uh new page tonight page 73 of the exposition of the seven Church ages brother Bram he says to seal up this point on the true and false Vines mingling and demonstrating the two spirits that are at work let us look into these scriptures isn't that beautiful doesn't say Let us look into the encyclopedia let's look at Wikipedia let's look and see what Oral Roberts said or one of the other Ministries around let's look into the scriptures 1 John 41:4 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby ye know the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard it that it should come and even now already is it is in the world ye are of God little children and have overcome them Antichrist spirit because greater is he God's spirit that is in you than he that is in the world I just want to back up and talk about this a little bit here we can read this scripture and it might sound really plain and cut and dried in every spirit that that that every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and and that's very true but there's a lot of people that might profess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh but there's me there's there's spirits that get into people that would say Jesus Christ came in the flesh but he wasn't God have they confessed that Jesus Christ CHR Has Come In the Flesh and you know it's so subtle brothers and sisters so subtle so subtle one word off is Satan's kingdom Jude 3:4 Jude 34 and2 beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men not Saints I love how he says that I had to highlight that not Saints crept in unawares these have not come into the fold by means of the door and are therefore robbers and we know that Jesus tells the story about the wedding supper the wedding Feast doesn't he there's no back door brothers and sisters there's no basement entrance there's no side window or or fire escape that's going to get us in there and and you know what's interesting I I I I know I heard this preach once upon a time I believe brother Ken did once upon a time there was a man that made it into that wedding feast and he never had a garment on right so there's people that are going to get there the wrong way or it wouldn't be said that way in the Bible right and what happens to them they're grabbed they're bound at the instructions of the Lord and they're cast into outer Darkness Ness where there's wailing and nashing of teeth there's only one way and today we're talking about the way the truth and the life for the elected some people want to go before the white throne and and I don't know if I'd want to do that if I knew about this truth I think the word of God says it would be better for them to not have known but you know there's certain men that have crept in unawares they've not come into the fold by means of the door and are therefore robbers who were before old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ these are spots in your feasts of Charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear I just I just marveled at that when I was looking at this and I still do because we're not necessarily talking about coming to maybe someone's house or or a community center somewhere where we're having a a community Feast where we're having a potluck brothers and sisters we're talking about the table of the Lord we're talking about coming to the church where we worship where we enter in these ungodly men turn up but you know what they were ordained of that now I'm sorry it sounds awkward everyone's awfully quiet but you know what brother bradam says there's three typ of Believers in every group but it ain't up to us to try and determine who's who it's up to God alls we can do is try and encourage one another to the word brother Bram goes on to say it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together but of different seeds now we got into a topic earlier this week on the the the Bible study the morning Bible study and I just thought it was so good you know when you plant a garden some some of us here well versed at garden planting and uh you know when you plant a garden I don't know very much about it I know a little bit but I know this much when you get a garden and you got the plot of land and you know kind of lay it out the way you want to grow and do things you get your seeds and you got packages that identify what the seeds are you don't just take the seeds and dump them all into to a container and then start throwing seeds into the rows you do that with one type of seed per row and you might stop planting and then plant something new or different in that same row further down the line but you don't just mix all the seeds together because you won't be able to tell what's what you plant your seeds separately you keep your seeds organized you make sure that you know what seed is what because if you took the the wrappers away you wouldn't be able to pick out maybe the celery seeds or or maybe the pea seeds or or whatever the seeds are carrot seeds mustard seeds all the different seeds you wouldn't be able to individually pick them out of a a bowl full of seeds you need to keep them organized but my point with all of that is you can't tell what they are just by looking at the seeds they actually have to begin to grow and if you don't keep track of what they are when they begin to grow you might think one is a weed and pull that weed out but you're actually taking one that you want and and realistically if they're all seeds that you planted every one of them is one that you wanted but they all have to grow and usually when they grow they sprout they look the same and as they grow a little taller they still look pretty close to the same but once they get to a certain height you can start to discern and tell which ones are what you want which ones are planted in that row that you want but really some of them are so close together you won't be able to tell anything until they bear fruit until they actually show what their life is till it goes back into the seed form but brother Bram says it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together but of different seeds he says now now then I think there is something else you ought to know when I hear that I just I I perk up I'm like man the seven churches which are addressed by John are in Asia Minor and are all Gentile churches he does not speak to the church at Jerusalem which was mostly Jewish with perhaps just a few Gentiles in it the reason that God had turned from the Jews to the Gentiles thus the whole church age is God dealing with the sorry thus the whole of the church ages is God dealing with the Gentiles and calling out a gentile bride to himself that makes the church ages and the fullness of the Gentiles the one and the same thing acts 13:44 to 48 and the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God but when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed it's just such an amazing story that is but you know even today there's people that judge themselves Unworthy of everlasting life they do they literally do and and you know the word doesn't actually stop there it just continues on am because no amount of unbelief will stop the word of God isn't that beautiful brothers and sisters doesn't matter what we have around us it doesn't matter what we encounter doesn't matter what we hear or or feel even nothing will stop the word of God from coming to pass am Hallelujah we have Romans 11 1-8 Paul speaking I say then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid for I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of the tri of Tribe of Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his people which he fornew what ye not what the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal than you even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace and if by Grace then it is no more of Works otherwise Grace is no more grace amen but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work what then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded according as it is written God hath given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day and we know that if you start talking to a Jew someone who is a true Hebrew in Israel you start talking about Jesus they're going to say no way he is just a prophet there's no way you don't don't talk to us about that in fact brother bradam says it very clearly many times you can't cut God into three and give them to a Jew because they think that everyone else who is a Christian is a trinitarian not realizing that there's some truly elected which is really the difference you know Romans 11:25 to 29 brother bramy says I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in and you know I just made a note here I just thought it was so good because just on the other page brother bradam he says the calling out of the Gentile bride to himself that makes the church ages and the fullness of the Gentiles the one and the same thing the fullness of the Gentiles is coming in right now we are a part of the fullness of the Gentiles that is the culmination of all of the church ages brothers and sisters and we are are here in the midst of that he goes on to say and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake sakes but as for touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance paragraph 30 these seven churches located in Asia Minor contain certain characteristics within them that at that ancient date which became the mature fruit of later ages what were just seed plants back there came out later in a mature Harvest even as Jesus said for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry I was thinking about the state of the world now and I was trying to explain this to Isaac the other day while we were driving and you know I was I was telling him that the language has changed in in humanity basically all over the world and you know people in government people who are professionals doesn't matter where you go office meetings everywhere you go the the swears and the curses are are like a normal part of the language now and and it's almost like it's it's if you accept that then you're welcome into the club but if you don't accept that then there's something wrong with you and and it's just the way the world has gone now and I was explaining to Isaac that you know when when my parents were children I I don't know when that would have been maybe in the in the 40s or the 30s even 40s 50s sorry if you're listening mom and dad I don't want to date you to be uh too Elder but you know back when they were children what I'm getting at is there was no swearing you weren't swearing in the open public maybe some people would but you know typically the people boy this is a bit of a tangent the people who would swear a and cuss they were the ones that were typically of lower education and probably more on the criminal side the ones who have potentially been to jail but nowadays the professionals the white callers the ones who who are holding meetings at high levels it's okay to swear if you talk to the police they're not afraid to swear it doesn't matter where you go this is the world that we live in but what's happened is there's an anointing on this Earth brothers and sisters and all of the spirits are now culminating just like all of the spirit of the Lord Jesus is culminating in his bride body it's not just the devil Powers taking over and I think this is the direction that I really want to impress as we go forwards is that though this world is getting dark the bride is getting brighter there's no way this world darkness is going to Snuff out the light which is Jesus Christ Living out through his bride body it's only going to get brighter and brighter as we have this contrast anyways um carrying on page 76 the message to the Ephesian Church age unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou thou c not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and Hast found them liars and Hast borne and Hast patience and for my name's sake Hast labored and Hast not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the paradise of God now remember the nicians niik niik is the leadership ni is the ministry leans is the Ley the people of the church a nickol leitan spirit is going to be dominating the people who are of the leoty and Jesus God speaking but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of that ni leot in spirit which I also hate isn't it wonderful to look at every single Church age he identifies with them the good things that they've done the good things that they're doing he relates to them that he understands exactly who they are and the position that they're in but he says you know what there's a little bit of a correction that has to come you have to get back to your first love to this first church age and you know every single one of us can live out I would say different portions of church ages in our lives and and we can get to the place where we forget our first love we get saved and God starts to bless us and we have a tremendous time maybe we have a family we get bogged down with the cares of life and what happens is we forget our first love we heard it on Sunday sometimes we get married and what what happens the the cares of Life come around the kids happen in our lives and we forget our first love and our marriage starts to get prickly and we we scratch our head and we wonder why all you got to do is get back to your first love remember how wonderful it was Once Upon a Time same thing spiritually it's a beautiful thing when we can look at the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride it's no different than us with our wives but if we have the ability to repent that means that we are ordained for eternal life brothers and sisters because only the ones that he loves does he rebuke and chasen all the rest could just do whatever they want to do they could just carry on the messenger the messenger Angel to the Church of Ephesus was the Apostle Paul you know this was one of the things that really changed it for me to understand the message of the hour um May maybe many times for people we can just take it for granted or just know that the messengers are angels but they're not always something that is understood sometimes it's good just to dwell on it a little bit to remind us that you know there's Messengers that are in the Bible this isn't just something that William Mari and Bram says in the printed book that he's come up with as he explains this when you look at the Bible and and you hear the description you talk about Paul there was a man that came to him Daniel talks about a man that came to him you know when the three Hebrew children were in the fire what did the king say the king said there's a fourth man in the fire one that looks like the son of man and we know that men are created man is created in the image of God Amen but anyways Paul Paul the messenger Angel to the Church of Ephesus was the Apostle Paul that he was the messenger to the first age of the Gentile era cannot be denied though to Peter it was granted the authority to open the doors to the Gentiles it was given to Paul to be their Apostle and prophet he was the prophet Messenger to the Gentiles his prophetic office by which he received the full revelation of the word for the Gentiles authenticated him as their Apostolic Messenger to this agreed the other Apostles at Jerusalem once again we're going to go through and just lay it out by scripture just proving this is not something that's just made up this is right out of the scriptures out of the King James Bible Galatians 1:12 to19 for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own Nation before more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me amen that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither went I up into Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus then after 3 years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abod with him 15 days but other of the Apostles I saw none save James the Lord's brother and you know brothers and sisters if you look at this scripture if you study it out and and a great way to do that is in the Hebrews series The Hebrews book brother Bram he says it very clearly when Paul was actually being dealt with by the Lord when he was having his conversion when he was being transformed into a new creature that was no longer laying waste when he had his name changed from Saul of Tarsus to Paul the Apostle that was no surprise to God but it sure was to him but when that happened when the consciousness of that happened to him he didn't go back and confer with all of the old people that he used to hang out with he didn't go back and talk to the old kind old priest he didn't go and talk to anyone what he did was he went out into Arabia he got away from everyone he pushed back all of the things that he knew about and got into a position where he could compare the Revelation that he was getting with the word of God because remember we're going to go back to it every single time we get on this topic we're going to get a revelation it's going to come to us thoughts will come but it's got to be revealed not only by the spirit confirmed in the word and then it's going to make a manifestation in our lives and when it manifests in our lives brothers and sisters just having fruit on the vine isn't enough that fruit has to manifest according to the original vine it's got to manifest according ording to the word of God which will reflect that Revelation that we got at the very first it's just a big circle but here we have Paul talking about how when this was revealed to him he went out in Arabia he didn't go and check with anyone and ask people's opinions he went and saw for himself as a scholar of the word does it compare with scripture and when that happened he was able to say amen and went forward with great boldness to be the Apostle for the age oh what do we have here Galatians 22 he says and I went up by Revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which I preached among the Gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means I should run or had run in vain but of those who seem to be sorry this is another scripture here this is Galatians 26-9 but of those who seem to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me I love how he says this doesn't matter who it is whether they're important or not whether they're famous or not God accepteth no man's person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me but in contrary wise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same when was mighty in me toward the Gentiles and when James sephus and John who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of Fellowship that we should go unto the Heathen and they unto the circumcision and we know the the word heathen in the word of God it just doesn't mean unbeliever per se even though it is in some context but what it means is non-jew the Gentile we're heathens by Nature outside of being Christians Romans 11:13 for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office mine office he understood where he stood so he was able to magnify his office and like I said in the Hebrew series brother brandham talks about that it's so good even if you don't read it if you just listen to it it's really good it speaks very specifically on that and I thought about getting into that but you know what maybe sometime down the road we'll study the Hebrews series uh there's so many nuggets in there but for now we'll just carry on paragraph 32 Paul founded the church at Ephesus about the middle of the first century this enables us to set the date of the beginning of the Ephesian Church age at about 53 ad his manner of ministering set the pattern that all future Messengers were to Aspire to I just love this I think it's so important for us to remember this his manner Paul's manner of ministering set the pattern that all future Messengers were to Aspire to and actually sets the pattern for every true minister of God though he would not attain to such Heights in the prophetic realm as did Paul Paul's Ministry had a three-fold quality and was as follows we'll get into that I just think it's so good to to recognize this I just want to read a little quote here I think we still have time it's out of having conferences and it's uh 0608 brother bradam he he says I can't explain it if you were to search that I can't explain it there's no words that I can think of I can't explain it there's no words that I can think of if I'd say superb or or or supreme or or perfect that wouldn't touch it there was no tomorrow there was no yesterday they they were in eternity now many people know exactly where I'm at right now this is where he was beyond the curtain of time but what I'm saying is this is just something I felt led to read because it's talking about the messenger that we follow today how he followed the first church age messenger he wasn't interested in some sort of alternative or substitute he said there was no tomorrow there was no yesterday they were in eternity and they never got tired they never had to eat yet they had senses I could feel them they could speak they was looking at me they had senses and I said I don't understand this and that voice said this is perfect love said isn't that what you spoke the Holy Spirit was I said yes and this is perfect love and about that time a big bunch of men lifted me up and took me to a place and set me up kindly high like a stand or something and here was people I could see them by the tens of thousands coming from everywhere everyone young beautiful running hugging me I saidwell I don't get this and just then a beautiful woman run up and she said oh my darling brother she said we're so happy to see you welcome and she walked away and I said praise the Lord sister I looked around me and then I thought what is this what's going on what's happened just then a voice said in the Bible where it said that Jacob was gathered with his people and the other one this is like unto that where you'll gather with your where you will gather with your people I said all them Brams I said that I never believed that there was that many he said they're not Brams said they're your converts they're your converts said that woman that you're admiring said you know how old she was when you led her to Christ I said I have no idea said past 90 said she's young forever and she looked up at me she said brother brandom Jesus will come someday and then we'll go back to Earth and said then we'll receive our glorified body then we'll live together forever I said well well what what do you set me up here for and they said you was a leader you led us I said oh let me see Jesus if I've passed over I want to see him and that voice said you can't see him now said he will come but first he will come to you and said judge you by the gospel you preached and I said the gospel I preach yes and I said will St Paul have to stand before his converts said absolutely he will too I said I never varied one word I stayed just exactly the way the Bible said it it I don't care what anyone said or did not say I stayed right with it like that so if Paul's group is saved mine is too and a great scream from look like thousands and thousands said we know that I said praise God I never was so happy that I stayed true to the word see I never was so happy you know brothers and sisters we're not talking about a time in the future we're talking about eternity so every single one that has the ability in this room here tonight to say Amen to those words you were there your voice is what he heard saying amen I just think it's so beautiful my goodness where do we leave off here oh here we go um first of all paragraph 34 Paul was absolutely true to the word okay sorry I'm just going to back up a go uh back up a bit Paul's Ministry had a three-fold quality and was as follows the first of all Paul was absolutely true to the word he never deviated it deviated from it no matter what the cost Galatians 1:8-9 but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be ACC cursed and as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed and we have Galatians 2:1-4 but when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed but when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter before them all if thou being a Jew livest after the the manner of the Gentiles and not as do the Jews why compel us the Gentiles to live as do the Jews we know that he was living a double life and he just simply called him out on it according to the word 1 Corinthians 14: 36-37 what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only if any man think of himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord I just believe it says it right there we can't go any further than that scripture verse right there we have to be willing to acknowledge Paul's Ministry if we don't do that then we've got something wrong we're going off on a tangent you know all we have to do is repent we just have to remember our first love we just have to go back to where we got off is what brother brandham said paragraph 35 notice that Paul was unorganized but spirit-led as when God moved upon Moses to lead Israel out of Egypt Jerusalem's Council never sent Paul out nor did it have any power or jurisdiction over him God and God Alone did the sending and the leading Paul was not of men but of God isn't that beautiful when you think about that God took the one who is doing the greatest work for those evil leaders those S Pharisees and Sadducees hey in Jerusalem took the greatest man from them and converted him took him and used him for his good it's just a beautiful thing Galatians 1:1 Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead Galatians 2: 3-5 but neither Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false Brethren unawares brought in who came in privileged to spy out our Liberty which we have in Jesus Christ that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you he goes goes on to say in paragraph 36 secondly his ministry was in the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken and written word remember r faled by the spirit confirmed by the word made manifest by the fruits that it bears and this one is 1 Corinthians 2 veres 1 to5 and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power and that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God if there is one thing that I would like to say over and over and over to the church this is all so that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God acts 148 to10 and there sat a certain man at L lra lra lisra impotent in his feet and being a from his mother's womb who never had walked the same heard Paul speak who steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had Faith to be healed said with a loud voice stand up on thy feet and he leaped and walked acts 20: 9 to2 and remember this isn't the Acts of the Apostles even though many times Bibles say that we had the correction in our day in the church age in which we live this is the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles uh Acts 20 veres 9 to2 and this is the story about falling asleep in church brothers and sisters and there sat in a window a certain young man named uus being fallen into a deep sleep and as Paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third Loft and was taken up dead and Paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him when he therefore was come up again he had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted the acts of the Holy Ghost the holy spirit in the apostle OST Les acts 28: 7-9 in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was pablus who received us and lodged us three days courteously and it came to pass that the father of pablus lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed 2 Corinthians 2:12 truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty Deeds 2 Corinthians 2:12 oh sorry thirdly he had an evident he had the evident fruit of his god-given ministry it actually manifested it bore fruit 2 Corinthians 12:1 I am become a fo fool in glorying ye have compelled me for I ought to have been commanded of you for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest Apostles though I be nothing 1 Corinthians 9:2 if I be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless I am to you for the Seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ I think that's just beautiful I would want to follow someone that had a Ministry like that someone that had a desire in his heart like that that was jealous over his people with a Godly jealousy my goodness paragraph 38 on page 81 Paul had been the means of bringing in multitudes of the Gentile sheep he fed them and cared for them until they brought forth righteous fruit and were prepared to meet the Lord as part of the Gentile bride at the time of the giving of the Revelation according to tradition Paul had already died a martyr but John was carrying on in his stead exactly as Paul had done in the days of his ministry so he's talking specifically here about how John was being revelated John was on the aisle of patmas after Paul had already been martyred he had already died he'd been killed but it doesn't change the fact that it was true Revelation is what he's saying here he says the death of Paul before Revelation was given does not at all anull the fact that he was the messenger to the Ephesian Church age for the messenger to every age regardless of when he appears or goes is the one who influences that age for God by the means of a word manifested ministry you know why I'm pausing with that we're reading between the lines here I hope understanding that it doesn't matter that God decided to take the prophet off the scene before he took the bride off the scene it doesn't mean that something is wrong WR with that word with the word that he brought because all it was was a word manifested ministry I'm just going to read that again the messenger to every age regardless of when he go when he appears or goes is the one who influences that age for God by means of a word manifested ministry and in this particular case the Ephesian Church age Paul was that man the city of Ephesus page 82 the city of Ephesus was one of the three greatest cities of Asia it was often called the third city of Christian faith with Jerusalem first and Antioch second it was a very rich city the government was Roman but the language was Greek historians believed that John Mary Peter Andrew and Phillip were all buried in this beautiful city Paul who founded the true faith in this City pastured here only about 3 years but when he was absent from the flock he was continually prayerfully mindful of them Timothy was its First bishop and I would say or Pastor 1 Timothy 1: 1-3 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the Commandment of God Our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is Our Hope unto Timothy my own son in the faith Grace Merc Mercy peace and peace sorry from God our Father and Jesus Christ Our Lord as I besought Thee to abide still at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other Doctrine paragraph 41 the very name Ephesus has a strange compound meaning aimed at and relaxed the high aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of God whereby they were aiming at the High Calling of God began to give way to a less watchful attitude a less Ardent following of Jesus Christ began to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called The Church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of Satan it had become relaxed and was drifting already the age was backsliding it had left its first love the tiny seed planted in the Ephesian age would one day grow in the spirit of error until all foul birds of the air would Roost in its branches so inoffensive to human reasoning would that little plant appear to that new EVE the church that again she would be seed by Satan so brothers and sisters remember the devil even though he's going about as a roaring lion he's not going to be at our door roaring like a lion brother Bram talks about it in Africa and there's people here that could probably witness it when a lion roars brother bradam says that everything shuts up because of the sound of that creature it's so powerful the devil's not going to come around and Roar maybe sometimes but more times than not he's going to be very inoffensive he's going to be an angel of Light he's going to be a perfect gentleman he'll come on the scene and make it look like it's just perfect it's just great whatever we're doing is just fine it's not a problem right and all she wants to do is just get his fingernail in the door that's all and then tomorrow it'll be his finger and the next day it'll be his hand and the next day his arm and before you know it he'll be all the way in but here we have the prophet saying so inoffensive to human reasoning that's why you got to have the Holy Ghost so inoffensive to human reasoning would that little plant appear to the new EVE the new church that again she would be deceived by Satan the Ephesian age had presented to her the opportunity for God's best and for a while she prevailed then what happened brothers and sisters she relaxed let's not relax let's not become relaxed because we're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing we don't have need of nothing we have need of the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives we have need of the Holy Ghost in our homes and then relaxed and in that unguarded moment Satan planted the seed of complete ruination the very religion of Ephesus types out perfectly this first church age and sets the tenor of the ages to come in the first place the Magnificent Temple of Diana that was so many years in building housed in its sacred courts the most lusterless and unobtrusive image of Diana that one could imagine now I'm just going to pause there because I know full well and you do too later on in the exposition of the seven Church ages brother branam talks about snake worship and how there is a church age where they actually housed a live snake in the temple and to me that sounds very offensive and many times people would say that's awful sure but here we have Satan just creeping in oh it's just an unoffensive inoffensive little Idol you can't even see a figure you can hardly even tell that it's a woman but it's there and it's not God the most lusterless and unobtrusive image of Diana that one could imagine she was absolutely like any other of her images seated in the other temples dedicated to her she was simply an almost shapeless female figure that finally sunk into the block of wood from which she was carved and her two arms were formed out of two simple bars of iron how perfectly this depicts the spirit of antichrist loosed in the first age there he was loosed in the midst of the people and yet took no shape as to alarm the people yet the two arms of iron bars showed that it was his intent to crush the work of God as he made his inroads and no one seemed to notice him or what he was doing but one day they would notice when those arms of iron his deeds became Doctrine and his Doctrine became the law of an Empire I'll just finish this page if it's okay paragraph 44 the order of the temple service is also very revealing there were first of all priests who were unic this sterile priesthood presaged the sterility of the people who would Drift from the word for a people who claim to know God apart from the word are as Barren as the life is as sorry I'm going to read this again for a people who claim to know God apart from the word are as Barren of life as is a sterile unic secondly the temple had within its confines the Virgin priestesses who performed the religious acts of the temple this showed forth the day that ceremony and for form ritual and works would take the place of the Holy Spirit and no longer with charismatic manifestation fill the temple of God brothers and sisters don't ever we don't ever want ceremony form ritual and works to take the place of the holy spirit in our church we want to see the charismatic manifestation of God in our church he goes on to say over them all was the high priest a man of political power and public influence portraying what was already in progress though not too manifested that is the church would soon begin be given over to the leadership of man with man's plans man's Ambitions and thus saith the Holy Ghost would no longer be a living reality and underneath them I'll call the musicians as we finish here and underneath them were all the temple slaves who had no choice but obedience to the religious hierarchy what can this mean but that the day would come when the vested clergy by political maneuvering State help and the substitution of word and spirit for Creeds dogmas and human leadership would enslave the leoty while the the leaders luxuriated in ill-gotten wealth and enjoyed their filthy pleasures and the poor people who were to be served according to God now became the servants brothers and sisters maybe stand with me as we close how important is it for us to stay with that word tonight we need to stay with that word that was once delivered unto the Saints and you know we have no excuse we've had a complete tying up of all of the loose ends in our day it's just such a wonderful thing to be able to look at the beginning of that Antichrist Spirit how it crept into the framework of the Christian church and how did it happen I think it's so important to just remember to think about this to meditate on this how did it happen they relaxed they were comfortable they had Christ he was in the boat with them the storm calmed but then they relaxed let us not ever get relaxed Brothers and Sisters Let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord tonight we just thank you once again for this word that you have given to us Lord we know that there's no author that we're interested in listen to other than you father but we know that this word this book that we're reading tonight that we have been studying and reading it it's a book that was prepared Lord by your servant and father we appreciate it because we know that the only thing that he did in this book was reveal how that Antichrist Spirit crept into the framework of the Christian Church causing it to be lukewarm formal and Powerless and Lord Jesus we don't want to replace your spirit Lord the the charismatic manifestation of your spirit Lord in our church or in our lives or in our families Lord for Creeds and dogmas and works Lord Jesus if we've been guilty of those things forgive us for it Lord help us Lord to have the spirit to repent quickly to be a man after your own Heart Lord just like David was oh Father we know that you called him that because he had the ability he had the desire to quickly repent father help us to remember our first love Lord whether it's you father and service or whether it's our our wives Lord Jesus maybe it's our our parents as children or oh Father Lord there's so many different levels of that first love but we know that we only can call you Lord because you have first given us of your spirit and tonight we thank you for that Lord we thank you for the manifested Revelation in our day we thank you Lord Jesus that we can read this scripture that we can read this book by Revelation father Lord we just pray that it would manifest in our lives that it would bear fruit according to the message of this age father because we know that's the only fruit that will get us to the position that we want Lord we love you and we thank you for your goodness to us we just ask that you would go with us now as we go our separate ways be with those who couldn't come tonight father those maybe who are traveling who are sick or those who are maybe just father busy doing other things Lord we just love you we thank you we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
