TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of bring Jesus. [Music] You know, I uh my I just want to read a scripture here out of Mark chapter 10. And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. And we know that that's the traditional teaching. Don't don't mess with things. Don't get out of order here. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and he said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for such is the kingdom of God. Verily, I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein." And he took them up in his arms, and put his hands upon them, and blessed them. And that's what we are going to do today. Certainly wonderful to have this honor. Hey, buddy. Brother Jerry, can you see him? God bless you, buddy. Yeah, it's okay if you're yawning in church. You're allowed to. Let's just bow in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, one more time. What an honor and a privilege it is to hold one of your elect. Father, this morning, Lord Jesus, we want to thank you for this life of brother Jeriel, Lord Odono. Father, we thank you for the Odinoo family, Lord Jesus, brother Farah, Sister Merritt, Sister Zoe, and Brother Jason, Lord. And this morning, Father, we just want to take this life that you have given unto this family, Lord, and dedicate it back unto you, Father. Lord Jesus, we know that all life comes from you. And what greater honor and privilege is it as parents, Lord Jesus, to acknowledge you as the giver of all life. And Father, to be able to take that life that you have given us and dedicate it back unto you. So father this morning even as a body of believers here in Calgary we unite together around this family Lord around the Odonovos and we just ask Lord Jesus in the name of Jesus that you would watch over this boy for the duration of his life. Father as we've read about and heard about so many times Lord there's so many different things that we could ask for but Father this morning we unite together and we ask for the salvation of this boy. We just pray that Lord Jesus, you would guide his footsteps all the days of his life. That you would lead him and guide him into all righteousness, Lord. That his desire would be unto you first and foremost, Lord. And oh, Father, that all of the other gifts would follow, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray that you would allow him to be an inspiration of joy to his family, Lord Jesus. That he would be an inspiration of the foundation of your love and your gospel to all the people around him, Lord. because he knows what you've done for him. Father, we pray that you would just keep sickness away, Lord. And Father, let him just experience the joy of your salvation. Father, we love you and we thank you and we just want to commit this boy into your hands now for your glory. As we dedicate him in the name of Jesus Christ, we'd ask Lord also that you would watch over the family in every aspect. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you, buddy. You feel that presence, don't you? It's not brother Barry. Oh my. Hallelujah. God bless you, brother. Congratulations. Bless you, sister. Bless you, sister. Oh, bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the field. fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little to Jesus. [Music]
