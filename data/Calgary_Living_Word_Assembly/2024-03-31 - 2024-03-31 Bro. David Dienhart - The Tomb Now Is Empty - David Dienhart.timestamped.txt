[11:12] morning thought I'd start with a just a
[11:15] scripture reading brother brandom takes
[11:17] from the rising of the sun this is Mark
[11:21] 16 and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[11:24] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[11:26] and salom had brought sweet spices that
[11:28] they might come and anoint him and very
[11:31] early in the morning the first day of
[11:33] the week they came to the seler at the
[11:35] rising of the Sun and they said amongst
[11:38] themselves who shall roll away the Stone
[11:39] from this from that of the
[11:41] SRE and when they looked they saw the
[11:44] stone was rolled away for it was very
[11:48] great sorry I've lost my spot need to
[11:51] have my glasses
[11:52] on and entering into sorry this phone's

[12:02] white garment and they were afed he said

[12:22] scriptures this morning and and
[12:23] different gospels say it was just Mary
[12:25] Magdalene others say it was a group of

[12:29] went and told the disciples I was
[12:30] telling my wife they went and told the
[12:32] 12 apostles a group of women told the 12
[12:35] apostles all men and they didn't believe
[12:37] them and they Peter ran back to the tomb
[12:40] and and and he had to se for himself I

[1:31:15] or not amen I think he's thoroughly
[1:31:18] proved to you in the word who you are he
[1:31:21] showed you let's not just be a part
[1:31:24] partaker and then turn away but let it

[1:32:30] will amen why because he said so amen he
[1:32:34] promised it to
[1:32:38] you let's read again but if the spirit
[1:32:40] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[1:32:43] dead he was in the Tomb but if the
[1:32:46] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:32:48] the dead not another Resurrection is not
[1:32:51] replacement amen
[1:32:54] the one that laid in the grave will come
[1:32:56] out of the

[1:33:01] another but it won't come up with
[1:33:04] corruption your body will come you may

[1:33:27] young right it won't have corruption in
[1:33:29] it because sin once died that's all that
[1:33:32] can do it can only it's only a buggy to
[1:33:34] take this inside of the inside to a
[1:33:37] waiting body then that waiting body will
[1:33:39] come when the when the last one comes in
[1:33:42] it's going to come and pick up this body
[1:33:44] and becomes a glorified body amen amen
[1:33:48] is that right amen sin goes down sin
[1:33:51] cannot rise again I'm talking about Sin
[1:33:54] your body not sin in you sin in your

[1:34:02] failures won't
[1:34:04] rise it has one place to go yes that's
[1:34:09] death but you have conquered death
[1:34:12] through
[1:34:12] him death is
[1:34:17] conquered amen hallelujah all
[1:34:21] right so if that same spirit that raised
[1:34:24] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he
[1:34:26] that raised up
[1:34:30] Christ also that he that raised up
[1:34:33] Christ in
[1:34:36] you from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:34:39] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:34:44] dwelleth in you what a

[1:35:04] what he said he would
[1:35:06] do rest on
[1:35:08] it all
[1:35:19] right now
[1:35:21] then if it was Jesus if it was now then
[1:35:25] he said talking about it but let me just
[1:35:27] start here Jesus was the fullness of God
[1:35:31] manifested he was the fullness of the
[1:35:33] godhead bodily therefore when he came to
[1:35:36] the Earth and was manifest in flesh you
[1:35:40] were in him then
[1:35:45] amen because he was the word in the
[1:35:48] beginning was the word a thought
[1:35:51] expressed his thought expressed and the
[1:35:53] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:35:56] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:35:59] Among Us amen the word was made
[1:36:03] flesh watch the statement now the word
[1:36:06] was made flesh and if you were in him
[1:36:09] then you are that word
[1:36:13] amen that was made flesh then I always
[1:36:16] said if he was the fullness of the
[1:36:18] godhead bodily where were you then yes

[1:36:24] you identifying you were also with him
[1:36:27] in the beginning amen amen all right

[1:36:41] yes when he was on Earth you suffered
[1:36:44] with
[1:36:46] him praise the Lord
[1:36:50] amen when you suffered with him
[1:36:54] in the garden you suffered with
[1:36:59] him the decision he made in the garden

[1:37:16] that amen amen I pray God reveal it to
[1:37:20] us he you suffered with him and you died
[1:37:23] with him

[2:16:22] Revelation amen sanctification made way
[2:16:26] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost which

[2:16:57] way she's got to go further you think
[2:16:59] the bride's going to set there I don't
[2:17:01] know about that when God stands behind
[2:17:04] it and vindicates it I have to tell you
[2:17:06] this message is already told this

[2:17:10] aren't you not feeding on it

[2:17:15] life because you're too

[2:17:31] but where's the where's your absolute
[2:17:33] it's in the Things Not

[2:17:39] Eternal that's the
[2:17:41] real that's reality this outer feeling

[2:21:37] he
[2:21:38] does oh let's just I'll just just a
[2:21:49] moment
[2:21:52] okay that's the same thing he does when
[2:21:54] he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with
[2:21:56] fire he can come and dwell in you and we
[2:21:58] can set in Heavenly places in Christ
[2:22:00] Jesus because we are already in him not
[2:22:03] we will be we are now set setting in
[2:22:07] Heavenly places okay we follow that I
[2:22:09] want to get to this how do we get into
[2:22:11] it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one
[2:22:13] Spirit we're all baptized into Christ
[2:22:15] which we are now won't be if Christ in
[2:22:18] Christ we are he's the great spirit
[2:22:20] spiritual King over the spirit that's in
[2:22:23] us because we were in him at the
[2:22:25] beginning yes now Church age book he
[2:22:28] said he told us the evidence of what
[2:22:30] would happen after being baptized with
[2:22:32] the Holy Ghost was that you would have
[2:22:34] the teacher come and teach all
[2:22:38] truth but when the teacher was the
[2:22:41] teacher but that teacher is an inside
[2:22:43] teacher not an outside teacher all right
[2:22:47] if the spirit wasn't inside you right
[2:22:50] even at this moment you wouldn't hear
[2:22:52] the truth and receive it by Revelation
[2:22:54] if you heard it every moment of the day
[2:22:57] amen amen so that has to be there he's
[2:23:01] the hearer of the word he's the receiver
[2:23:03] of the
[2:23:06] word and he guides you teaches you leads
[2:23:09] you into all
[2:23:11] Truth All right but but that teacher now
[2:23:15] that was the sign of the indwelling
[2:23:17] spirit in the days of Paul those who
[2:23:19] were filled with the Holy ghost heard
[2:23:21] the word received it and lived it amen
[2:23:25] it's not you living it it's him living
[2:23:28] it amen but he lives it through you he
[2:23:31] quickens your mortal body to the word he
[2:23:34] acts through flesh he's made flesh in
[2:23:37] you but who's the one living
[2:23:41] it well he is I say he is then you are
[2:23:46] amen amen the inside is living it from
[2:23:50] the coming from the inside outside amen
[2:23:54] you've heard that statement before
[2:23:55] coming from the inside out exactly what
[2:23:58] it is all
[2:24:01] right those who did not have the spirit
[2:24:05] heard it only as carnal men put a wrong
[2:24:09] interpretation on it and went into sin
[2:24:12] sin is
[2:24:15] unbelief every age the evidence was the
[2:24:19] same those that had the spirit the
[2:24:21] teacher heard the word and that Spirit
[2:24:23] took the word and taught it or other
[2:24:26] words revealed it to
[2:24:30] them and they were of the group that
[2:24:32] heard the message and the messenger
[2:24:35] excuse me and his message and took it
[2:24:37] and lived it they were those individuals
[2:24:41] that make up that body
[2:24:47] amen all right okay let's move a little
[2:24:51] further then we'll maybe close on
[2:24:53] time all right
[2:25:12] now notice the harmony this is pick up
[2:25:15] your pen and write notice the harmony of
[2:25:17] the father and son Jesus never did
[2:25:19] anything now I've been through this so
[2:25:21] I'm just going to I'm just going to skip
[2:25:24] down she shows her he shows her his Word
[2:25:28] of Life she receives it she never doubts
[2:25:32] it therefore nothing can harm her not
[2:25:35] even
[2:25:37] death for if the seed be planted the
[2:25:39] water will raise it up again here's the
[2:25:41] secret of this yes the word is in the
[2:25:46] bride just as it was in Mary
[2:25:50] the
[2:25:53] shook are you with me but it had to come
[2:25:56] out of the shook is that right now I'm
[2:25:59] not saying Mary was an unbeliever but we
[2:26:01] this outside is like Mary
[2:26:04] y right this is the negative where's the
[2:26:08] positive there can't be a negative
[2:26:10] without a
[2:26:11] positive hello right you heard your
[2:26:14] pastor say that last night right you're
[2:26:16] hearing it said again there can't be a
[2:26:18] negative without a positive though I
[2:26:20] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[2:26:22] death I fear no evil because the
[2:26:24] positive is there amen though I walk
[2:26:27] through a shadow of
[2:26:29] negative and remember it's only a shadow
[2:26:32] so quit fearing the
[2:26:36] shadow Hallelujah this is only a
[2:26:40] shadow someday it won't be a shadow no
[2:26:42] more it'll be what I am on the
[2:26:47] inside praise the Lord praise the
[2:26:52] Lord all right the bride has the mind of
[2:26:55] Christ to know what he wants done with
[2:26:56] the word she performs the command of the
[2:26:59] word in his name she has thus saith the
[2:27:03] Lord amen hallelujah I'm not saying that
[2:27:06] as a cliche this is revelation this is
[2:27:09] becoming more all the time more
[2:27:11] Revelation all the time clearer all the
[2:27:13] time
[2:27:14] am amen because the bride and the groom
[2:27:19] are one more all the
[2:27:23] time thank you Lord all right until this
[2:27:26] flesh gets so filled up with that word
[2:27:29] it's got to let
[2:27:32] go did you hear Prophet say that it's
[2:27:34] going to get so filled up it can't stand
[2:27:36] it no
[2:27:37] more it can't stand the stimulation of
[2:27:40] Revelation because death is being
[2:27:42] swallowed up with the victory that is I
[2:27:45] am on the inside it's Eternal and time
[2:27:48] are blending which is going to win
[2:27:51] right amen which is becoming if you
[2:27:53] blend something you add a little more of
[2:27:56] of something in it it's blending but it
[2:27:58] comes more what you're adding until the
[2:28:00] other that you're adding into becomes no
[2:28:02] more and it becomes just Blends right in
[2:28:05] that's right you come out of Eternity
[2:28:08] you just go right back up you came out
[2:28:09] of that little hickey eternity continues
[2:28:12] on you came that little hickey and you
[2:28:14] go right back up into eternity again
[2:28:17] eternity never
[2:28:19] stopped time stops but it's at this age
[2:28:23] when the ending of time has come to us
[2:28:26] that this thing is now revealed and open
[2:28:27] to us now watch what he said
[2:28:39] here okay see you were made for an
[2:28:42] eternal
[2:28:45] purpose I think this is out of uh future
[2:28:48] home you were made for an eternal
[2:28:51] purpose because you was the
[2:28:52] manifestation of an attribute that was
[2:28:54] in God that thought of you and expressed
[2:28:56] you now Ephesians 1:10 said the
[2:28:59] Ephesians 1:10 was the fullness of time
[2:29:03] brother Braham said it was the fullness
[2:29:05] of time has come
[2:29:08] yes that's when time has been fulfilled
[2:29:12] when there's no more time then you go
[2:29:14] into eternity after the seventh Church
[2:29:16] age is finished is over and it is
[2:29:23] is then he comes to another place and
[2:29:25] said no brother sister you misunderstood
[2:29:27] the ages and over yet yeah then who is
[2:29:30] he talking about
[2:29:33] eternity who's
[2:29:36] eternity you
[2:29:38] are the real you are I'm Eternal he's
[2:29:41] Eternal that makes me and him one it's
[2:29:44] he in you that's Eternal that's not in
[2:29:47] Leo DEA anymore you raptured out of Leo
[2:29:49] DEA Revelations 4:1 said you raptured
[2:29:52] out of leoda because the door was opened
[2:29:55] the Seal's been opened
[2:29:57] amen that's right and the opening of the
[2:30:00] seal you were able to come out of leoda
[2:30:03] and into the bride time right the bride
[2:30:06] age which is the message of the seventh
[2:30:08] seal which was the opening of Seven
[2:30:11] Seals All the seventh seal did was
[2:30:13] finish it seal what was spoken in those
[2:30:16] seals amenallah
[2:30:21] without the seventh seal you wouldn't
[2:30:22] know what was said right that's right
[2:30:25] because the seventh seal is
[2:30:27] him opening himself up and when he
[2:30:29] opened himself up you saw yourself
[2:30:32] written in the book
[2:30:34] amen amen hallelujah all right now you
[2:30:38] say Brother David you're making
[2:30:40] everything so positive w we have
[2:30:41] anything I'm telling you what you have
[2:30:43] to have here to get there amen
[2:30:47] hallelujah
[2:30:49] amen we ought to have a positive
[2:30:51] message we ought to be dealing with who
[2:30:54] you really are I don't have to keep
[2:30:56] dealing with who you're not I just tell
[2:30:58] you who you are the other will take
[2:31:00] follow suit once you get a revelation of
[2:31:03] that you'll know the other twin that's
[2:31:06] so close it would deceive you if
[2:31:14] possible see I had I had a reviv my
[2:31:16] mother and father had a Revival and they
[2:31:18] brought
[2:31:19] twins
[2:31:21] so did Rebecca
[2:31:23] and and
[2:31:25] Isaac both godly
[2:31:29] people but they weren't dealing with the
[2:31:31] human part of it they were twin but what
[2:31:34] did it say The Elder will serve the
[2:31:36] younger I mean the yeah the younger what
[2:31:38] were that talking about Jacob I loved
[2:31:41] and Esau I
[2:31:42] hated because one had the seed and is
[2:31:45] the seed and the other despised it
[2:31:48] wouldn't have nothing to do with the
[2:31:49] both Birthright and just sold it out for
[2:31:51] a mess of podage I wonder how many
[2:31:53] people claiming to believe the message
[2:31:55] are going to sell it out for a mess of
[2:31:58] the world for a mess of churchianity for
[2:32:01] a mess of what people think about
[2:32:07] you I say help me Lord help us
[2:32:11] all that's exactly right amen but I got
[2:32:15] a staying power I have confidence not in
[2:32:18] this man but in the staying power
[2:32:22] am see Luther's AG is over he comes the
[2:32:26] Leo and it is Luther's age is over
[2:32:28] Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is
[2:32:32] over amen don't try to go pick that up
[2:32:36] it had its day it had its time but life
[2:32:39] has come out of that shook the same life
[2:32:41] that went through Luther came into
[2:32:42] Wesley coming up into Pentecost shuck
[2:32:45] now it's moved where
[2:32:49] amen the seed again who is the seed
[2:32:52] again Jesus Christ what day is this and
[2:32:56] there's to come on the scene a royal
[2:32:58] seed yes it would be a royal bride to
[2:33:00] the Royal promised son that's right all
[2:33:04] right now
[2:33:10] okay
[2:33:18] Hallelujah okay now we're just moving
[2:33:20] right along praise the Lord we're doing
[2:33:22] good nothing okay now I read that okay
[2:33:24] that's good I got that praise the
[2:33:27] Lord okay praise the Lord I got that one
[2:33:30] all
[2:33:32] right it's always nice to see you get
[2:33:35] through these things you
[2:33:39] know
[2:33:48] okay now
[2:33:50] I just read to you Colossians
[2:33:52] 3:3 which we already discussed that see
[2:33:56] the Holy Spirit itself is a
[2:33:59] seal let me just turn the corner a
[2:34:01] little bit excuse me I don't mean to
[2:34:03] Snuff all the time I know those people
[2:34:05] out here not only you the ones on the
[2:34:07] live sorry
[2:34:09] people don't worry about them forgive me
[2:34:13] ignore it thank you brother thank
[2:34:16] you doesn't bother you good praise the
[2:34:20] Lord
[2:34:24] okay I guess it's only bothered
[2:34:35] me all
[2:34:37] right praise the Lord
[2:34:40] now so I can read this
[2:34:43] properly Ephesians 4:30 said where
[2:34:46] grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[2:34:47] you're sealed to the day of redemption
[2:34:51] the Holy Spirit itself is the
[2:34:54] seal now brother brandom says hold that
[2:34:57] word
[2:34:58] Redemption sealed to the day of
[2:34:59] redemption now he says hold that word
[2:35:01] Redemption see until the day until the
[2:35:05] day that the book Redemption has been
[2:35:07] revealed hold that word Redemption
[2:35:10] you're sealed hold it until the day that
[2:35:12] the book of redemption is opened or
[2:35:15] revealed and the Redeemer comes to claim
[2:35:19] his Poss
[2:35:20] posession all right how many believe
[2:35:23] he's come to claim his possession and is
[2:35:26] claiming his possession and will fulfill
[2:35:30] that full claiming at the meeting in the
[2:35:33] air is that right amen but what the book
[2:35:36] open for to claim his possession claim
[2:35:38] what he has
[2:35:40] redeemed amen see nothing can keep you
[2:35:43] out of that claim right because you have
[2:35:46] the seal amen amen amen that's right
[2:35:49] amen now and the Holy Spirit itself is
[2:35:53] the seal the holy spirit is a seal and a
[2:35:55] seal signifies what a finished work
[2:36:01] amen my the seal signifies what a
[2:36:05] finished
[2:36:07] work well praise the Lord how many
[2:36:11] sealed well then it's finished yes sir a
[2:36:15] finished work thank you Lord Jesus said
[2:36:18] it is finished
[2:36:20] right is that right the Redemption is
[2:36:24] finished now he comes in on the scene in
[2:36:27] the end time this end day and and takes
[2:36:29] claim of what he finished amen and
[2:36:32] brings it to himself as we read last
[2:36:34] night he comes to claim he comes to take
[2:36:37] it to himself that where he is you may
[2:36:39] be also what's it going to take
[2:36:41] revelation of it will take you to the
[2:36:43] body change
[2:36:47] am don't don't let the devil misplace
[2:36:50] your the coming amen cuz that's exactly
[2:36:53] what he fights yes he wants you to get
[2:36:56] confused about it
[2:36:59] amen amen you just stay in the word you
[2:37:02] keep eating that open book amen give me
[2:37:05] the book he heard the voice again and he
[2:37:08] said give me the book The Voice said
[2:37:10] take the book and he said give me the
[2:37:12] book why did he was so adamant he didn't
[2:37:14] stop and stutter around it he give it to
[2:37:16] me why cuz I'm possession my possession
[2:37:20] is in that book my name is in there my
[2:37:22] right is in there everything I have is
[2:37:24] in there
[2:37:27] amen and the lamb opened the
[2:37:33] book who is he coming to claim those nam
[2:37:37] in that
[2:37:38] book and this is the record that he's
[2:37:40] given to us eternal life and this record
[2:37:44] is in his son and who he who hath the
[2:37:47] son hath life
[2:37:50] all right now so it's a finished work
[2:37:53] the holy spirit being a seal to the
[2:37:55] individual and that individual when he
[2:37:57] receives the Holy
[2:37:59] Spirit then his time of of groaning is
[2:38:04] over
[2:38:06] hello when he receives the Holy Spirit
[2:38:09] then his time of
[2:38:12] groaning oh was me I would quit
[2:38:15] confessing you don't have faith quit
[2:38:17] confessing the devil what you want you
[2:38:19] to confess
[2:38:20] every word has a spirit behind
[2:38:23] it is that right don't confess that
[2:38:27] confess what the word
[2:38:28] said your confession ought to say what
[2:38:31] he
[2:38:34] said amen is that right that's a
[2:38:37] confession that's a true profession amen
[2:38:41] all right now then your time of groaning
[2:38:43] is over because it is a finished
[2:38:48] work Hallelujah
[2:38:56] and I'll bypass some of this so he
[2:39:03] said then next what the seal signifies
[2:39:06] is a finished work now watch what he
[2:39:08] says about this finished work now this
[2:39:10] is the words that I got he picks up what
[2:39:13] the seal signifies from the dictionary
[2:39:15] he said SE seal is a finished work now
[2:39:17] watch what he says and when the s th
[2:39:20] seal is
[2:39:22] broken the mystery of God that's sealed
[2:39:26] in these mysterious seals is
[2:39:32] finished there's a message what are the
[2:39:36] seven Thunders it's the Revelation
[2:39:38] contained in the
[2:39:39] seals what is the Revelation contained
[2:39:42] in the seals I read it to you out of
[2:39:43] rising of the sun last night what is it
[2:39:46] about her the bride amen where she come
[2:39:50] from who she is how she was in Christ
[2:39:53] and how she would be manifest In the End
[2:39:56] Amen that's what he's preaching to you
[2:39:58] this morning
[2:40:01] amen amen all right then see when the
[2:40:05] seventh seal the mystery of God
[2:40:08] Revelations 10:7 the mystery of God
[2:40:10] would be
[2:40:12] finished
[2:40:16] amen all right because the message of
[2:40:19] the seventh angel was Revelations
[2:40:22] 10 which the prophet said is those seals
[2:40:25] amen is the seventh
[2:40:31] seal all
[2:40:34] right and you wonder what's in that box
[2:40:38] car you wonder what's sealed in there
[2:40:40] it's supposed to be such and such
[2:40:42] there're supposed to be he's
[2:40:45] presuming but when the that when the
[2:40:48] seal that seventh seal broken and the
[2:40:50] door is opened where do we find that
[2:40:53] Revelations 4 let's go over there just a
[2:40:56] moment Revelations CH 4 and after this
[2:41:00] verse one I looked and behold a door was
[2:41:03] opened in
[2:41:08] heaven amen what brother brandom
[2:41:10] identifi that to be
[2:41:12] Rapture is that right Rapture now and
[2:41:15] Rapture of our body but it had to be a
[2:41:18] Rapture now in you first
[2:41:22] Because unless that Rapture becomes a
[2:41:24] substance in you you'll never see it in
[2:41:26] the body
[2:41:28] amen and it'll take the Holy Ghost as we
[2:41:31] just read to reveal it to you
[2:41:34] yeah right all right so he said when the
[2:41:38] seal is broken the door is open we see
[2:41:41] into it then we see into it then watch
[2:41:44] what it said and the the door was opened
[2:41:46] in heaven and the first voice which was
[2:41:49] reev gelations
[2:41:50] 1:10 was as of a trumpet talking with me
[2:41:54] remember he turned to see the voice and
[2:41:56] when he turned to see The Voice he said
[2:41:58] seven saw seven
[2:42:02] candlesticks and one standing in the
[2:42:04] midst we went over that last
[2:42:09] night all right then he said when the
[2:42:11] seal is broken the door is open we see
[2:42:14] into it then and see exactly what's in
[2:42:17] there but you can't you see it how can

[2:43:16] Revelation contained those seals were
[2:43:18] for no nobody else but the bride amen
[2:43:24] amen okay than you now another thing a
[2:43:28] seal signifies is ownership and the seal
[2:43:31] has a mark on it shows ownership and
[2:43:33] when you are bought by the blood of
[2:43:36] Jesus Christ and sealed by the Holy
[2:43:39] Ghost you no longer belong to the world
[2:43:42] or anything pertaining to
[2:43:45] it and another thing is the seal is is a
[2:43:52] security the seal is security sealed
[2:43:55] means you are secured
[2:43:58] amen I don't care you say oh my mistakes
[2:44:02] oh that's not your security quit looking

[2:49:59] Jeremiah 29:11 said I know my thoughts

[2:50:07] expected end
[2:50:09] amen amen amen amen now praise the

[2:50:39] okay all right now let's just get this
[2:50:44] finished
[2:50:47] here
[2:51:09] this one that stands in the in the midst
[2:51:11] of the church revealing who he is in
[2:51:13] this last stage he calls himself the
[2:51:14] author of the creation of God this is
[2:51:17] another creation
[2:51:21] this has to do with the church this is a
[2:51:24] special designation of him
[2:51:30] amen he is the creator of that church
[2:51:33] the Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[2:51:35] Bride As the spirit of God he came down
[2:51:39] created in the Virgin Mary the cells
[2:51:40] from which his body was born I want to
[2:51:42] repeat that he created the very cells in
[2:51:45] the womb of Mary for that
[2:51:47] body what about these spiritual cells
[2:51:49] he's created in you for this
[2:51:53] change because when you get the change
[2:51:55] inside of you you've come to the end of
[2:51:57] your destination you've already got this
[2:51:59] change as substance so that makes this
[2:52:03] body potentially to be changed it's
[2:52:06] already got the
[2:52:09] potential do you understand all right
[2:52:13] now let's
[2:52:16] see okay now I'm not going to go any
[2:52:18] further with that so we'll just come to
[2:52:20] this the new
[2:52:22] creation it's not the old creation made
[2:52:25] over or it canot be called a new
[2:52:28] creation that is exactly what it says
[2:52:30] New Creation it's another creation
[2:52:33] distinct from the old one different from
[2:52:35] the old one now I'm just coming back and
[2:52:38] I'm going to bring out what I've been
[2:52:40] saying what he's what he's been saying
[2:52:42] through me bringing it right back into
[2:52:44] this what this Prophet said here
[2:52:46] listen he said no long longer is he
[2:52:49] dealing by ways of the
[2:52:53] flesh that was how he dealt with Israel
[2:52:56] he chose Abraham and Abraham's issue
[2:52:58] Through The Godly line Isaac line but
[2:53:00] now out out of every Kindred tribe and
[2:53:03] Nation he has proposed a new creation he
[2:53:06] is the first of that creation he was he
[2:53:08] was God created in the form of a man now
[2:53:11] by his Spirit he's creating many sons
[2:53:14] unto himself see the beginning means
[2:53:16] there's others to come just like him God
[2:53:20] the Creator creating himself a part of
[2:53:23] his creation amen this is the true
[2:53:26] revelation of God this was his purpose
[2:53:29] the purpose took through took form
[2:53:31] through election all right and and he
[2:53:35] does that by the decree he elected them
[2:53:37] he elected the members of his new
[2:53:39] creation he predestinated them to the
[2:53:41] adoption of children
[2:53:44] maturity adoption of
[2:53:46] children because you've already got the
[2:53:48] the spirit of adoption so you're heading
[2:53:50] right to the end of your destiny you're
[2:53:52] going to come exactly in character and
[2:53:54] everything exactly in that person
[2:53:58] himself and that's what's happening you
[2:54:00] talk to any bride member that's getting
[2:54:02] Revelation that's exactly what's
[2:54:03] happening I just see myself in him so
[2:54:06] one it just keeps opening opening the
[2:54:08] Oneness the Oneness the Oneness till
[2:54:09] there's no difference the only
[2:54:12] difference is
[2:54:16] this but
[2:54:19] Eve had a little different thing too
[2:54:22] than Adam but she was of the Adam's Body
[2:54:26] she was bone of his bone flesh of his
[2:54:28] flesh she' just come in a little
[2:54:30] different shape because God was in
[2:54:31] morphed amen are you with me in another
[2:54:34] mask but it wasn't a different person
[2:54:36] because Eve had Adam's spirit amen and
[2:54:40] had Adam's Body right
[2:54:42] [Music]
[2:54:44] amen what's he coming back to a full
[2:54:46] restoration of that family right that's
[2:54:50] why God allowed it he allowed Adam to
[2:54:52] step aside he allowed Adam to take and
[2:54:54] listen to his wife and die die for her
[2:54:59] is that right that's exactly was what
[2:55:01] God was doing showing Redemption right
[2:55:03] there because he took you and me to
[2:55:05] Calvary died to death and right
[2:55:08] there he died for you and released you
[2:55:12] out of that tomb of

[3:29:36] that you were the lamb slain before the
