[54:53] pergamus write these things saith he
[54:56] which hath a sharp sword with two
[54:58] edges I Know Thy works and where thou
[55:01] dwellest even where Satan's seat is and
[55:05] thou holdest fast my name and Hast not
[55:08] denied my faith even in those days where
[55:11] in Antipas was my faithful martyr who
[55:15] was slain among you where Satan dwelleth
[55:18] but I have a few things against thee
[55:21] because thou Hast there them that hold
[55:24] the doctrine of baalam who taught balac
[55:27] to cast a stumbling block before the
[55:30] children of Israel to eat things
[55:31] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[55:35] fornication so hast thou also them that
[55:40] hold the doctrine of the nicians which
[55:43] thing I hate repent or else I will come
[55:47] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[55:50] them with the sword of my mouth he that
[55:54] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[55:57] saith unto the churches to him that
[56:00] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[56:02] Hidden mana and will give him a white
[56:05] stone and in the stone a new name
[56:09] written which no man knoweth it saving
[56:12] he that receiveth it let's just bow one

[58:47] we're going to have on this Earth we can
[58:49] have great businesses and we could be
[58:52] politicians we could have all manner of
[58:55] things in this life and be known for a
[58:58] few different things but really the
[59:00] people that we raise will be what we're
[59:02] actually known for the most and uh we
[59:05] know that's our heritage in heaven so to
[59:07] be able to see our children and our
[59:09] children's children that is the promise
[59:11] of the word and what a blessing that is

[59:36] on the 22nd we will have a 6 PM
[59:38] communion service it's been a while
[59:40] since we've had communion we kind of
[59:42] took the summer off and it's going to be
[59:44] wonderful to get back in into the house
[59:46] of the Lord and just commit Our Lives to
[59:48] the Lord once again there's something
[59:50] special that happens at a communion foot
[59:52] washing and we know it's not about form
[59:55] and it's not about tradition it's about
[59:56] recognizing that we are Discerning the
[59:59] Lord's body not our own and that's what
[1:00:02] happens when we wash one another's feet
[1:00:04] that's what happens when we take the
[1:00:05] bread and the wine it's a wonderful time
[1:00:08] so um we'll have this all on the website
[1:00:11] calendar the 22nd of September on
[1:00:14] October 4th 5th and 6th we have
[1:00:16] something a little um out of the
[1:00:18] ordinary happening but we just felt led
[1:00:21] to pursue this and have had this on the
[1:00:24] heart for quite some time time we have
[1:00:26] an over 25
[1:00:28] singles in Brackets unmarried Fellowship
[1:00:32] weekend at our at our place we're we're
[1:00:35] creating a venue just for folks to come
[1:00:38] and and have some fellowship that they
[1:00:39] ordinarily wouldn't have the opportunity
[1:00:42] to have and uh so we've advertised it
[1:00:45] with many different churches and there's
[1:00:47] a bunch of people that seem to be
[1:00:49] interested so we're going to see what
[1:00:51] the Lord will do that weekend uh there's
[1:00:53] a few things that are going to take
[1:00:55] place but uh we can talk more about that
[1:00:57] in the future so we have that happening
[1:00:59] as well um we were away last weekend at
[1:01:02] the Moose Lake Camp and uh it was sure a
[1:01:05] nice time it was not a busy church
[1:01:08] service camp it was a family camp where
[1:01:11] we had a bit of church service we had a
[1:01:13] bit of learning and we had lots and lots
[1:01:15] of fellowship and it was just a
[1:01:17] wonderful time there was such a a nice
[1:01:19] mix of people that were there and uh you
[1:01:22] know Saturday night we didn't have a
[1:01:24] service they kept it open
[1:01:26] and all the the main event was
[1:01:29] fellowship and the young people they
[1:01:31] wanted to play volleyball so they had a
[1:01:33] really good volleyball net they had a
[1:01:34] really good place to do it and they
[1:01:36] played volleyball for hours and you know
[1:01:39] it was wonderful to just sit back and
[1:01:40] watch this happen as we were having
[1:01:42] Fellowship they played till they
[1:01:43] couldn't see the ball anymore and uh but
[1:01:46] to stand back and look at it and think
[1:01:49] this is the future of our children
[1:01:52] they're fellowshipping with other
[1:01:54] believers and unless we as parents
[1:01:56] create that opportunity for them they're
[1:01:59] going to find their own opportunities
[1:02:01] and I'm not saying that camp is the camp
[1:02:04] I'm saying any Camp any kind of
[1:02:06] Fellowship that you can put your
[1:02:07] children in for Fellowship is a
[1:02:08] wonderful thing and and I was thinking
[1:02:10] about it after I do apologize because I
[1:02:12] did not advertise this with our
[1:02:14] congregation but I am going to next year
[1:02:16] we will certainly make sure everyone is
[1:02:18] aware of it if you have children if
[1:02:20] they're even very young children they
[1:02:22] don't have to be old children you can go
[1:02:25] to camp you don't even have to have
[1:02:27] children and you can go to Camp there
[1:02:29] was folks there that were they they they
[1:02:31] have children but they're grown up and
[1:02:33] gone away and uh it was just a wonderful
[1:02:35] time really really interesting time and
[1:02:38] and the cross-section of people that
[1:02:39] were there uh you might wonder why I'm
[1:02:41] going on about this it's just important
[1:02:43] I believe it's a very important thing to
[1:02:45] recognize it's important for our
[1:02:47] children to meet other believing
[1:02:50] children and unless we create the
[1:02:52] atmosphere it's not going to happen the
[1:02:54] way that maybe we think so we uh we just
[1:02:57] want to encourage that and uh we had
[1:02:59] just a wonderful time with Brother Steve
[1:03:00] Brant from Quebec he took the uh the
[1:03:03] services and uh yeah it was just a great
[1:03:05] time so that's all for Talking Now Let's
[1:03:08] get into the word we're going to pick up
[1:03:09] with the exposition of the seven Church
[1:03:11] ages where we left off last
[1:03:14] time and uh that was paragraph 168 I
[1:03:17] thought this was real interesting we
[1:03:19] have reached um in one two actually four
[1:03:22] more pages when I get to 218 it's
[1:03:25] exactly the middle of this book I'm
[1:03:27] reading from from the red exposition of
[1:03:30] the seven Church ages but we're almost
[1:03:31] in the middle and this is number 37 uh
[1:03:35] service number 37 of this so and I I
[1:03:38] believe this is just skipping across the
[1:03:40] surface too there's so much in here that
[1:03:42] we could really dwell on but uh we'll
[1:03:45] just we'll just carry on here in
[1:03:47] paragraph 168 brother Bram actually I'm
[1:03:50] going to go back to
[1:03:52] 167 the brandom says people look at Rome
[1:03:56] they look at the nation of Italy and as
[1:03:58] they look they do not realize that Rome
[1:04:02] with her strict confines where the pope
[1:04:05] has an actual area as his
[1:04:08] domain is literally a nation within a
[1:04:11] nation and she has
[1:04:14] ambassadors and receives
[1:04:16] ambassadors papal false Christian Rome
[1:04:21] she is even called The Eternal City how
[1:04:24] blasphemous Now controls by religion
[1:04:28] even more ably than when Pagan Imperial
[1:04:31] R controlled by the pure iron of
[1:04:36] force so I just wanted to lay that out
[1:04:38] because we're going to really go into
[1:04:40] where they actually started to to force
[1:04:42] people to worship to force people to get
[1:04:44] on board with the religion of the day
[1:04:48] brother R goes on to say in 168 Rome
[1:04:50] took on a new lease of life when
[1:04:52] Constantine joined church and state and
[1:04:55] back the Union by force the spirit that
[1:04:58] motivated Pagan Rome is the same spirit
[1:05:01] that now motivates false Christian Rome
[1:05:05] you can see this is so because you now
[1:05:09] know that the fourth Empire never went
[1:05:12] out of existence it just changed in its
[1:05:15] outer
[1:05:16] texture once the Nan Council had swung
[1:05:19] the power of political Rome to the
[1:05:21] church it seemed that there were no
[1:05:24] limits to which this first Christian
[1:05:26] Church would go the name Christian which
[1:05:29] originally brought
[1:05:31] persecution now became the name of the
[1:05:36] persecutors what a flip that is what a
[1:05:40] change it was in this age he says that a
[1:05:43] agustine of Hippo 354 to 430 set forth
[1:05:49] the precept that the church ought and
[1:05:52] must use Force if necessary to bring her
[1:05:56] children back into the fold and that if
[1:05:59] necessary sorry if necessary to bring
[1:06:01] her children back into the fold and that
[1:06:03] it was in harmony with the word of God
[1:06:06] to kill the Heretics and the
[1:06:09] apostates where do they get that
[1:06:12] from John
[1:06:14] 16 John 16 says these things verse one
[1:06:18] of John 16 these things have I spoken
[1:06:20] unto you that you should not be offended
[1:06:23] that they shall put you out of the
[1:06:24] synagogues the time cometh that
[1:06:26] whosoever kth you will think that he
[1:06:30] doeth God of
[1:06:33] service how you can just take a
[1:06:35] scripture right the devil will use
[1:06:37] scripture we know that he goes on to say
[1:06:40] and these things will they do unto you
[1:06:41] because they have not known the father
[1:06:44] nor me now I want to just point that out
[1:06:47] remember the word known in the Bible
[1:06:49] typically is not the way that we would
[1:06:51] say the word known typically it denotes
[1:06:54] an intimate
[1:06:56] relation amen these people have not had
[1:06:59] an intimate relation with the father and
[1:07:01] you know neither can they have because
[1:07:04] we know that Jesus said to him you are
[1:07:05] of your father the devil oh my and his
[1:07:08] works you do and these things will they
[1:07:11] do unto you because they have not known
[1:07:13] the father nor me because if you knew
[1:07:17] the father you would know me is really
[1:07:19] what he said um I'm just paraphrasing
[1:07:22] throwing that out there verse four says
[1:07:24] but these things have I I told you that
[1:07:27] when the time shall come ye may remember
[1:07:30] that I told you of
[1:07:32] them here we have this guy Austine of
[1:07:36] Hippo saying You must use force and you
[1:07:39] know what if they won't listen then just
[1:07:40] kill them just knock them off just get
[1:07:42] him out of the way send them send them
[1:07:45] to God right
[1:07:48] terrible goes on to say in his
[1:07:51] controversy with the donatists
[1:07:55] he wrote it is indeed better that men
[1:07:58] should be led to worship by God by
[1:08:01] teaching than that they should be driven
[1:08:03] to it by fear of punishment or pain but
[1:08:07] it does not follow that because the
[1:08:09] former course produces the better men
[1:08:12] therefore those who do not yield to it
[1:08:16] should be neglected for many have found
[1:08:19] Advantage have we as we have proved and
[1:08:22] are daily proving by actual experience
[1:08:26] the works right in being first compelled
[1:08:29] by fear or pain so that they might
[1:08:32] afterwards be influen by teaching so
[1:08:35] that they might follow out in act what
[1:08:39] they have already learned in word whilst
[1:08:42] these are better who are
[1:08:45] guided a right by love love that
[1:08:49] corrects say those are certainly more
[1:08:52] numerous who are corrected by fear
[1:08:56] for who can possibly love us more than
[1:08:58] Christ who laid down his life for the
[1:09:01] Sheep yet after calling Peter and the
[1:09:04] other Apostles by his words alone when
[1:09:08] he came to summon Paul he not only
[1:09:10] constrained him with his voice but he
[1:09:13] even dashed him to the Earth with his
[1:09:15] power and that he might
[1:09:19] forcibly bring one who is Raging amidst
[1:09:22] the darkness of infidelity to to desire
[1:09:25] the light of the heart he first struck
[1:09:28] him with physical blindness of the
[1:09:30] eyes why therefore should not the church
[1:09:35] use force in compelling her lost Sons to
[1:09:40] return because if we don't actually
[1:09:43] follow the word of the day then we're
[1:09:46] considered to be a heretic and an
[1:09:49] apostate why therefore should not the
[1:09:52] church use force in compelling her lost
[1:09:54] Sons to turn the Lord himself said go
[1:09:58] out into the highways and the hedges and
[1:09:59] compel them to come in wherefore if the
[1:10:02] power which the church has received by
[1:10:04] Divine appointment and where did that
[1:10:06] Divine appointment come from
[1:10:09] Constantine right bringing the church
[1:10:11] and state
[1:10:12] together by Divine appointment in its
[1:10:14] due season though the religious
[1:10:16] character and Faith Of Kings be the
[1:10:19] instrument by which those who are found
[1:10:21] in the highways and hedges that is in
[1:10:24] heresies and schisms are compelled to
[1:10:27] come in then let them not find fault
[1:10:31] with being compelled just make it fine
[1:10:35] we can constrain them by force to come
[1:10:38] in my paragraph 171 The Thirst for blood
[1:10:42] was growing a pace the false Vine in
[1:10:44] Spain now played upon the emperor
[1:10:46] Maximus to join in the attack upon the
[1:10:49] true believers who had the word and and
[1:10:53] the signs and wonders with them
[1:10:55] thus the Pilan ists were brought to
[1:10:59] treves by Bishop ithacus in 358 he
[1:11:02] accused them of Witchcraft and
[1:11:05] immorality and many were executed Martin
[1:11:08] of Tours and Ambrose of Milan protested
[1:11:12] this and pleaded in vain for the
[1:11:14] persecution to cease when the
[1:11:16] persecution was prolonged these two
[1:11:19] Bishops refused to fellowship with
[1:11:22] bishop hius and others like him him
[1:11:25] strange to say the sinod in trees
[1:11:29] approved of the
[1:11:31] murders from this time on especially
[1:11:33] through the Dark Ages we will see the
[1:11:36] children of the flesh persecute and
[1:11:39] destroy the children of the spirit
[1:11:43] though they both claim one father even
[1:11:46] as was in the case of ishmail and
[1:11:49] Isaac the darkness of spiritual
[1:11:52] corruption will deepen and the True
[1:11:55] Light Of God will fade until number wise
[1:11:59] it glows ever so faintly yet the promise
[1:12:03] of God will hold true the light shineth
[1:12:06] in
[1:12:07] darkness and the Darkness can do nothing
[1:12:10] about
[1:12:11] it and I believe that's just an exact
[1:12:13] statement for our day today there's a
[1:12:16] very small light in the midst of the 8
[1:12:19] billion people in this world but it's so
[1:12:22] dark out there it doesn't matter that
[1:12:24] Darkness cannot stop that light there's
[1:12:27] nothing that that Darkness can do about
[1:12:29] it
[1:12:30] amen now up to this time I have not
[1:12:33] brought out that point in history that I
[1:12:35] promise to cover that is the
[1:12:38] intermingling of the religion of nimrod
[1:12:41] and the Christian
[1:12:42] religion you will recall that adelus
[1:12:45] fled from Babylon to pergamus and set up
[1:12:48] his kingdom outside the reaches of the
[1:12:50] Roman Empire it flourished over the
[1:12:53] years nurtured by the God of this world
[1:12:57] a succession of priest Kings followed
[1:13:01] adelus until the reign of adelus 3 when
[1:13:05] for reasons known only in the
[1:13:07] sovereignty of God he willed the kingdom
[1:13:09] to
[1:13:10] Rome Julius Caesar then took both the
[1:13:14] kingdom physical and spiritual for he
[1:13:17] became pontiff Maximus of the babylonish
[1:13:20] religion and was therefore priest king
[1:13:24] this title passed on to the following
[1:13:26] Emperors until the time of Maximus 3 who
[1:13:30] refused it according to Steven's history
[1:13:33] it was then that the pope took the
[1:13:37] headship it was then that the pope took
[1:13:39] the headship the emperor rejected and
[1:13:41] today there is still a pontiff in the
[1:13:43] world and he is truly pontiff
[1:13:47] Maximus he wears a triple crown and
[1:13:50] resides in Rome and in Revelation 17 God
[1:13:54] does not not any longer refer to
[1:13:57] pergamus as Satan's seat nor does he say
[1:14:01] that is where Satan dwells no the throne
[1:14:05] room is no longer pergamus but it is
[1:14:09] Mystery
[1:14:10] Babylon it is not in Babylon but in
[1:14:14] mystery Babylon and you know he said he
[1:14:17] go I'm just going to pause here because
[1:14:19] if you look at the pope you take a look
[1:14:20] at the pope and maybe some of his
[1:14:22] speeches I'm sure that all of us have
[1:14:23] seen them if you haven't I would
[1:14:25] recommend looking at them he's a kind
[1:14:27] old priest isn't he the way he moves the
[1:14:31] way he talks he's so kind his his his
[1:14:35] his grammar is probably just about
[1:14:37] perfect he can speak I don't know how
[1:14:38] many different languages multiple
[1:14:40] different languages he's looks like a
[1:14:42] kind old priest brother Bram talks about
[1:14:44] the kind old priest he looks like a very
[1:14:46] kind old man but here we have the
[1:14:48] Vindicated prophet of God in our age
[1:14:50] saying he is pontiff Maximus he has f
[1:14:55] control over the
[1:14:57] world but many people would say no
[1:14:59] there's no way we talked about it last
[1:15:00] time if you just take a look at most
[1:15:01] Christian websites for their churches
[1:15:03] you'll see the Apostles Creed where did
[1:15:05] that come
[1:15:07] from it's not in Babylon he says but in
[1:15:10] mystery Babylon it is a city on Seven
[1:15:12] Hills its head is Antichrist for he has
[1:15:16] usurped the position of Christ who alone
[1:15:19] is mediator and who alone can forgive
[1:15:22] sins yes pontiff Maximus is with us
[1:15:27] today it's not just way back there in
[1:15:29] history it's today am now brother bradam
[1:15:32] he goes into where I really want to get
[1:15:34] into is the doctrine of the n nicians
[1:15:36] and we know that this is out of where
[1:15:39] we've read the scripture that we've read
[1:15:40] and uh it's taking a little bit to get
[1:15:42] to this but uh it's verse 14 I have a
[1:15:46] few things against thee because thou
[1:15:47] Hast there them that hold the doctrine
[1:15:48] of balum who taught bailo to cast a
[1:15:51] stumbling block before the children of
[1:15:53] Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[1:15:55] idols and to commit fornication so Hast
[1:15:57] them also them that hold the doctrine of
[1:16:00] the nicotin which thing I hate now I
[1:16:03] read both those verses in order the way
[1:16:05] they are in the Bible but brother badam
[1:16:06] brings them out in the reverse order
[1:16:08] first he hits on the nicians and that's
[1:16:10] what we're going to dig into and
[1:16:11] hopefully we can get through that I
[1:16:13] would really love to get into balum and
[1:16:16] baac tonight but I don't think we will
[1:16:18] Revelations 2:15 he says so hast thou
[1:16:21] also them that hold the doctrine of the
[1:16:24] nickoles means which thing I hate
[1:16:27] paragraph 175 you will recall that I
[1:16:29] brought out in the Ephesian age that
[1:16:32] word nikotin comes from two Greek words
[1:16:36] Niko which means to conquer and Leo
[1:16:39] which means the leoty nikotin means to
[1:16:42] conquer the Ley now why is this such a
[1:16:45] terrible thing it's terrible because God
[1:16:47] has never placed his church in the hands
[1:16:50] of an elected leadership which moves
[1:16:53] with political mindedness
[1:16:56] I think that's so
[1:16:57] good he has never God has never placed
[1:17:01] his church in the hands of an elected
[1:17:04] leadership which moves with political
[1:17:08] mindedness as soon as politics creeps
[1:17:10] into the church brothers and sisters we
[1:17:12] have a nician
[1:17:14] spirit and we're going to call it
[1:17:16] straight you know what people will call
[1:17:18] themselves Bishops there's no room for a
[1:17:20] bishop in the message of the hour
[1:17:23] there's no room for elders in the
[1:17:25] message of the hour brother bradam talks
[1:17:26] about it we're going to get into it I'm
[1:17:28] I'm feeling like I'm going to preach a
[1:17:29] little bit but there's people that will
[1:17:30] say that they're an elder and they're
[1:17:32] over overl lording other churches it's
[1:17:36] against the message of the
[1:17:37] hour we're going to get into that
[1:17:40] getting excited here now why is this
[1:17:43] such a terrible thing why is it such a
[1:17:45] terrible thing to conquer the leoty
[1:17:48] sometimes we conquer the leoty not by
[1:17:50] force not by Blood we just heard the
[1:17:54] prophet say that there is a pontiff
[1:17:55] Maximus Once Upon a Time he conquered
[1:17:58] with with force with blood he brought
[1:18:01] people to
[1:18:02] church imagine that if you started
[1:18:04] falling asleep in church the Deacon
[1:18:06] would come up to you and draw some blood
[1:18:08] that would wake you up that was the way
[1:18:09] it was once upon a time it's not the way
[1:18:12] it is now it's a spiritual battle amen
[1:18:15] when we start feeling tired and going to
[1:18:17] sleep in church it's a spirit right but
[1:18:20] that spirit is a connection to pontiff
[1:18:23] Maximus this Pope in Rome because we
[1:18:26] know that that's the Antichrist Spirit
[1:18:28] we know that's where Satan's seat is we
[1:18:30] just heard it that's what the prophet
[1:18:31] said but it's to conquer the leoty
[1:18:34] sometimes like I said it's not it's not
[1:18:37] by huge monstrous acts of
[1:18:41] violence it's with flatteries amen it's
[1:18:44] with kind words it's with pure form it's
[1:18:49] with organization and we have the
[1:18:51] prophet saying here I would say God
[1:18:53] saying through the prophet it is with
[1:18:57] political mindedness in the church and
[1:19:00] he goes on to talk about it how how how
[1:19:02] Bishops were set up over the the pastors
[1:19:04] and then there was archbishops over them
[1:19:07] and then there was Cardinals over the
[1:19:08] archbishops that's not God's program
[1:19:10] brother Ram talks about it we'll we'll
[1:19:12] continue on
[1:19:13] here he says he's placed his church in
[1:19:16] the care of God ordained Spirit-filled
[1:19:20] word living men who lead the people
[1:19:24] through feeding them the
[1:19:28] word he has not separated the people
[1:19:30] into classes so that the masses are led
[1:19:34] by a holy
[1:19:36] priesthood now you can you can you don't
[1:19:38] have to look very far I know it and I
[1:19:41] don't really know a lot of history
[1:19:42] because I came into the the message in
[1:19:44] 2005 but you can you can see this spirit
[1:19:48] in the message now it'll never actually
[1:19:51] ever denominate this message amen but I
[1:19:55] know even in Calgary there's two people
[1:19:57] have claimed to be the bishop so I say
[1:20:00] which one is which one's the bishop I
[1:20:03] don't know is is it an Archbishop or
[1:20:05] another Bishop what is it and I'm not
[1:20:07] trying to be funny what I'm trying to
[1:20:09] say is it's an antichrist
[1:20:11] spirit because the prophet said that
[1:20:13] it's wrong
[1:20:15] right he placed his church in the care
[1:20:18] of God ordained Spirit-filled word
[1:20:20] living men who led the people lead the
[1:20:23] people through feeding them the word
[1:20:25] he's not separated the people into
[1:20:27] classes so that the masses are led by a
[1:20:29] holy priesthood it is true that
[1:20:32] leadership must be holy but then so must
[1:20:35] the whole
[1:20:38] congregation further there is no place
[1:20:40] in the word where the priests or
[1:20:42] ministers or such mediate between God
[1:20:46] and the
[1:20:47] people there's no lordship over God's
[1:20:50] children
[1:20:54] nor is there a place where they are
[1:20:56] separated in their worship of the
[1:21:00] Lord God wants all to love and serve him
[1:21:05] together nianis destroys those precepts
[1:21:10] and instead separates the ministers from
[1:21:13] the people and makes the leaders
[1:21:16] overlords instead of
[1:21:18] servants I think it's beautiful the way
[1:21:21] the prophet did this in this book the
[1:21:22] way that he switched those words veres
[1:21:24] around he's going for the nickan spirit
[1:21:27] first because what is it that usually
[1:21:29] causes the nickan spirit to thrive it's
[1:21:32] the spirit of balum and baac that one
[1:21:35] that taught the people to cast a
[1:21:36] stumbling block to say oh that brother
[1:21:39] he's he's do you know where he came from
[1:21:41] do you know do you know what he did
[1:21:42] don't you know his parents how could he
[1:21:44] ever pack this
[1:21:46] message it's it's a terrible thing
[1:21:49] nickan ISM destroys those precepts and
[1:21:51] instead separates the ministers from the
[1:21:54] people and makes the leaders overlords
[1:21:56] instead of servants now this Doctrine
[1:21:58] actually started as a deed in the first
[1:22:01] age and I believe when you look at the
[1:22:04] seals brother brandham talks about it
[1:22:05] being an actual discussion it starts
[1:22:08] with a discussion first it becomes a
[1:22:10] discussion then it becomes a deed and
[1:22:12] and here you have it now it appears that
[1:22:16] the problem lay in two words
[1:22:19] elders
[1:22:22] presbyter and overseer seers
[1:22:26] Bishops though scripture shows that
[1:22:29] there are several Elders in each Church
[1:22:33] some began Ignatius among them to teach
[1:22:38] that the idea of a bishop was one of
[1:22:42] preeminence or authority and control
[1:22:45] over the
[1:22:47] elders now the truth of the matter I
[1:22:50] just love how he says it so plainly the
[1:22:52] truth now the truth of the matter the
[1:22:54] truth of the matter is the word Elder
[1:22:57] signifies who the person is while the
[1:23:00] word Bishop signifies the office of the
[1:23:03] same
[1:23:04] man the Elder is the man Bishop is the
[1:23:08] office of the man Elder always has and
[1:23:12] always will refer simply to a man's
[1:23:15] chronological
[1:23:17] age in the
[1:23:20] Lord he is an elder not because he is
[1:23:23] elected or
[1:23:25] ordained Etc because he thinks he is but
[1:23:30] he is
[1:23:32] older he's more seasoned trained not a
[1:23:37] novice and I would say this he's got
[1:23:39] more grace than anyone because he's
[1:23:41] fought the battles and he knows it's
[1:23:43] only by his grace that he
[1:23:46] stands he's reliable because of
[1:23:49] experience and longstanding proof of his
[1:23:53] Christian
[1:23:55] experience but no the Bishops did not
[1:23:58] stick to the Epistles of Paul but rather
[1:24:00] they went to Paul's account of the time
[1:24:02] he called the elders from Ephesus to
[1:24:05] milus in Acts 20 in verse 17 the record
[1:24:09] States Elders were called and then in
[1:24:12] verse 28 they are called overseers
[1:24:14] Bishops and these Bishops no doubt
[1:24:16] political minded and anxious for power
[1:24:19] insisted that Paul had given the meaning
[1:24:22] that overseers were more than the local
[1:24:25] Elder with official capacity only in his
[1:24:28] own church to them a bishop was now one
[1:24:31] with extended authority over many local
[1:24:35] leaders you know brothers and sisters
[1:24:37] this is exactly the reason why I had
[1:24:39] said from the very beginning when we
[1:24:40] talk about the church in Lethbridge
[1:24:42] that's a sovereign work that is not a
[1:24:45] satellite church of Calgary Living Word
[1:24:47] we said to them pick a name make your
[1:24:49] church it's your church it's not our
[1:24:52] church every single Church is Sovereign
[1:24:55] is what the prophet of God
[1:24:57] said he goes on to say such a concept
[1:25:00] was neither scriptural nor historical
[1:25:03] yet even a man of the stature of
[1:25:05] polycarp leaned towards such
[1:25:07] organization and last time I think I was
[1:25:09] reading ahead and this is where I got
[1:25:11] mixed up last time we talked about this
[1:25:13] polycarp would have been the one for the
[1:25:15] age but because he leaned to
[1:25:17] organization he was not chosen of God to
[1:25:21] be the one who was actually the
[1:25:23] messenger to that age
[1:25:25] thus that which started as a deed in the
[1:25:27] first age was made a literal Doctrine
[1:25:30] and so it is today Bishops still claim
[1:25:35] power to control men and deal with them
[1:25:38] as they
[1:25:41] desire placing them where they so will
[1:25:45] in the ministry this denies the
[1:25:48] leadership of the Holy Ghost who said
[1:25:50] separate me Paul and Barnabas for the
[1:25:52] work where unto I have called them
[1:25:54] this is antiw word and anti chist many
[1:25:59] people I I've heard people say they're
[1:26:01] kind of looking for the Antichrist the
[1:26:03] Antichrist I love the way the prophet of
[1:26:05] God said if it's antiw word if it's one
[1:26:07] word off it's antiw word if it's anti-
[1:26:10] word it's Antichrist it's that simple
[1:26:13] it's either all the word or it's none of
[1:26:15] the
[1:26:16] word Jesus called on this is uh Matthew
[1:26:19] 20:
[1:26:20] 25-28 but Jesus called them unto him and
[1:26:24] said ye know that the prince of the
[1:26:26] Gentiles exercise dominion over them and
[1:26:29] they that are great exercise Authority
[1:26:31] upon them but it shall not be so among
[1:26:35] you but whosoever will be great among
[1:26:39] you let him be your minister and
[1:26:41] whosoever will be Chief among you let
[1:26:44] him be your servant even as the son of
[1:26:47] man came not to be ministered unto but
[1:26:50] to minister and to give his life a
[1:26:53] ransom for many Matthew 238
[1:26:56] to9 but ye be but ye but be not ye
[1:27:02] called Rabbi for one is your master even
[1:27:06] Christ and all ye are Brethren and call
[1:27:10] no man your father upon the Earth for
[1:27:13] one is your father which is in
[1:27:16] heaven he says in order to clarify this
[1:27:18] even more let me explain nanism in this
[1:27:22] way you recall that in Revelations 13:3
[1:27:25] it says and I saw one of his heads as it
[1:27:28] were wounded to death and his deadly
[1:27:31] wound was healed and all the world
[1:27:34] wandered after the
[1:27:37] Beast now we know the wounded head was
[1:27:41] the Pagan Roman
[1:27:43] Empire that great political world power
[1:27:46] this head rose again as the Roman
[1:27:49] Catholic spiritual Empire now watch this
[1:27:52] carefully What did the political Pagan
[1:27:55] Rome do that was the basis of her
[1:27:58] success she divided and
[1:28:01] conquered that was the seed of Rome
[1:28:04] divide and conquer her iron teeth tore
[1:28:07] and devoured whom she tore and devoured
[1:28:11] could not rise again as when she
[1:28:13] destroyed Carthage and sowed her to salt
[1:28:17] the same iron seed remained in her when
[1:28:19] she arose as the false church and her
[1:28:22] policy has remained the same same divide
[1:28:25] and conquer that is nicolan ISM and God
[1:28:29] hates it God dwells in unity brothers
[1:28:32] and sisters if we've got a division
[1:28:34] Spirit it is of the devil it is an
[1:28:38] antichrist Spirit if there's people
[1:28:40] trying to cast stumbling blocks getting
[1:28:43] people to look at the hinder parts of
[1:28:44] other people that's the
[1:28:48] devil now it's well-known historical
[1:28:50] fact that when this error crept into the
[1:28:52] church men began to to VI for the office
[1:28:55] of Bishop with the result that this
[1:28:58] position was being given to more
[1:29:01] educated and materially Progressive and
[1:29:04] politically minded men and I want to say
[1:29:08] this maybe even sometimes a little bit
[1:29:11] more of a tenure in the message a little
[1:29:14] bit more knowledge in the message maybe
[1:29:16] a little bit more experience in the
[1:29:19] message but that's not going to do it
[1:29:21] that's the same thing we're talking
[1:29:22] about here brother bradam says human
[1:29:24] knowledge and program began to take over
[1:29:27] Divine wisdom's place and the Holy
[1:29:29] Spirit no longer
[1:29:31] controlled this was indeed a tragic evil
[1:29:33] for the Bishops began to maintain that
[1:29:36] it no longer required a transparent
[1:29:39] Christian
[1:29:41] character a transparent Christian
[1:29:44] character to minister either the word or
[1:29:47] the rights of the church for it was the
[1:29:50] elements and the ceremony that counted I
[1:29:54] say Lord let never never let it be the
[1:29:57] rights or the elements or the ceremony
[1:29:59] that counts but let it be the the Holy
[1:30:02] Spirit L church amen he says this
[1:30:05] allowed evil men seducers to Ren the
[1:30:08] flock when you push aside the word
[1:30:11] anything is possible when we leave out
[1:30:14] one word that's all satan needs he'll
[1:30:17] creep into the church he will cause it
[1:30:19] to be lukewarm formal and Powerless amen
[1:30:24] and that's why I think it's so important
[1:30:26] to just call it straight say it's
[1:30:27] straight it's either right or it's wrong
[1:30:30] it's one or it's zero it's black or it's
[1:30:33] white There's No Gray there's no middle
[1:30:35] ground there's no partialities with it
[1:30:37] it's right or it's wrong paragraph 183
[1:30:40] with the man-made doctrine of the
[1:30:42] elevation of Bishops to a place not
[1:30:45] accorded them in scripture The Next Step
[1:30:49] was the handing out of graded titles
[1:30:53] that built up into religious hierarchy
[1:30:55] for soon there were archbishops over
[1:30:57] Bishops and Cardinals over the
[1:30:59] archbishops and by the time of bonapace
[1:31:02] 3 there was a pope over all a
[1:31:05] pontiff what with the nician doctrine
[1:31:08] and the amalgamation of Christianity
[1:31:10] with Babylonian ISM the net results had
[1:31:13] to be what Ezekiel Saw in chapter 8:1 so
[1:31:17] I went in and saw and behold every form
[1:31:19] of creeping things and abominable beasts
[1:31:23] and all all the idols of the House of
[1:31:25] Israel portrayed upon the wall around
[1:31:29] Revelations 18:2 and he cried mightily
[1:31:31] with a strong voice saying Babylon the
[1:31:33] greatest Fallen is fallen and has become
[1:31:36] the habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:31:39] every foul Spirit and the cage of every
[1:31:42] unclean and hateful bird for all nations
[1:31:45] have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
[1:31:48] her fornication how is that going to
[1:31:50] happen brothers and sisters just by
[1:31:52] signing up under Rome yes sir and you
[1:31:54] know many times churches have signed up
[1:31:56] under Rome and people don't even know it
[1:31:59] right people aren't even aware that the
[1:32:01] leadership the hierarchy of those
[1:32:04] churches have already kissed the ring
[1:32:07] they don't have to do it themselves
[1:32:08] their leadership has already done it and
[1:32:11] you know what it is to reject the true
[1:32:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's all it
[1:32:16] takes is to receive the mark of the
[1:32:18] beast amen and we're not talking about a
[1:32:19] physical Mark some people are afraid
[1:32:22] they're coming out with all this new
[1:32:23] tech technology you can go to Whole
[1:32:24] Foods in the states I hear and just use
[1:32:26] your palm to pay just swipe your palm
[1:32:29] and you can pay some people are getting
[1:32:31] RF IDs put it under their skin so they
[1:32:33] can unlock their doors some people are
[1:32:35] getting real nervous because this
[1:32:36] technology is on Earth it's already here
[1:32:39] some people are afraid that they're
[1:32:40] going to come around and say it's not a
[1:32:42] virus or or or an antivirus or a vaccine
[1:32:45] that you're going to have to get now
[1:32:46] they've proven they can really push this
[1:32:48] stuff on people and some people are
[1:32:49] getting real nervous and I think the
[1:32:51] ones that are getting real nervous they
[1:32:52] don't actually know that unless they
[1:32:55] take the Holy Ghost in their life that
[1:32:57] seal of God that's been promised unless
[1:33:00] they do that they've already got the
[1:33:01] mark of the beast it's a spiritual Mark
[1:33:04] it's not something that we're going to
[1:33:05] actually physically
[1:33:08] see some people will be on earth to see
[1:33:11] it there will be a time where you will
[1:33:13] not be able to buy or sell unless you
[1:33:15] actually show what you represent where
[1:33:16] you'll have to stand up and actually
[1:33:18] give your testimony and say no I can't
[1:33:21] do it because I really I missed it I I I
[1:33:24] went to a church and and heard one time
[1:33:26] that there was a prophet but I just
[1:33:27] couldn't Buy in all the way I just
[1:33:29] somehow wasn't able to live the life or
[1:33:32] some people maybe just didn't hear about
[1:33:34] it at
[1:33:35] all but the bride of Christ she'll be
[1:33:38] long gone she'll be in the palace when
[1:33:39] all that happens brothers and sisters
[1:33:41] don't be looking for natural events
[1:33:42] brother Bram the prophet for our day who
[1:33:45] was the voice box of God the one that
[1:33:47] God chose to speak to this generation he
[1:33:49] said I see nothing else that needs to
[1:33:51] happen for the church for the Rapture of
[1:33:53] the of the Church of God to go there's
[1:33:55] nothing left to happen except for the
[1:33:57] rapture we don't need to look for
[1:33:59] natural events brother Ram goes on to
[1:34:01] say in paragraph 185 now this nickan
[1:34:04] Doctrine this rule that was established
[1:34:07] in the church did not hit off hit it off
[1:34:10] too well with a lot of the people for
[1:34:11] they could read the odd epistle or essay
[1:34:14] on the word written by some Godly person
[1:34:17] so what did the church do it
[1:34:19] excommunicated the righteous teachers
[1:34:22] and burned the Scrolls
[1:34:24] my they said it takes a special
[1:34:26] education to read and understand the
[1:34:29] word why even Peter said that many
[1:34:32] things Paul wrote were hard to
[1:34:35] understand having taken away the word
[1:34:37] from the people it soon came to the
[1:34:39] people listening only to what the
[1:34:42] priests had to say this just really
[1:34:44] struck me you know we're looking way
[1:34:46] back in history and and here we have
[1:34:48] people just listening only to what the
[1:34:51] priest had to say and in doing what he
[1:34:53] told them they called that God they
[1:34:57] called that God and His holy
[1:35:00] word they took over the minds and lives
[1:35:03] of the people and made them the Servants
[1:35:08] of a
[1:35:09] despotic
[1:35:11] priesthood just hanging there for a
[1:35:13] minute because this is important this is
[1:35:14] something we don't want to glaze over
[1:35:17] this is alive and well today I'm just
[1:35:19] going to say that now if you want proof
[1:35:22] that the Catholic Church demands the
[1:35:23] lives and minds of men just listen to
[1:35:26] the Edict of
[1:35:28] theodosius 5 is that right X Theodosia
[1:35:32] first edict this edict was issued
[1:35:34] immediately after he was baptized by the
[1:35:37] First Church of Rome we three Emperors
[1:35:40] will that our subjects steadfastly
[1:35:43] adhere to the religion which was taught
[1:35:44] by St Peter to the Romans which has been
[1:35:47] Faithfully preserved by tradition and
[1:35:50] which now is professed by the pontiff to
[1:35:54] damasus of Rome and Peter Bishop of
[1:35:56] Alexandria a man of apostolic Holiness
[1:36:00] according to the
[1:36:01] institution of the Apostles and the
[1:36:04] doctrine of the Gospel let us believe in
[1:36:07] one godhead of the Father the Son and
[1:36:10] the Holy Spirit the equal Majesty in the
[1:36:14] Holy Trinity we order that the adherence
[1:36:18] of this Faith be called Catholic
[1:36:22] Christians we brand all the senseless
[1:36:25] followers of the other religions with
[1:36:29] the infamous name of Heretics and forbid
[1:36:33] their conventicles assuming the name of
[1:36:37] churches besides the condemnation of
[1:36:40] divine Justice they must expect the
[1:36:43] heavy penalty which our Authority Guided
[1:36:47] by Heavenly wisdom shall think proper to
[1:36:50] inflict can you imagine that
[1:36:54] doesn't it sound so flowery so precise
[1:36:58] so so beautifully said my the 15 penal
[1:37:03] laws that this Emperor issued in as many
[1:37:06] years deprived of the evangelicals of
[1:37:09] All rights to the exercise of their
[1:37:12] religion excluded them from all civil
[1:37:16] offices and threatened them with fines
[1:37:19] confiscation banishment and even in some
[1:37:23] cases
[1:37:24] death and and all the while thinking
[1:37:26] that they were doing something for God
[1:37:28] they were in service for God right do
[1:37:31] you know what he says we are headed
[1:37:33] right that way today the Roman Catholic
[1:37:38] Church calls herself the mother Church
[1:37:41] she calls herself the first or original
[1:37:44] church that is absolutely correct she
[1:37:47] was the original First Church of Rome
[1:37:50] that backslid and went into sin right
[1:37:54] she was the first that organized in her
[1:37:57] was found the deeds and then the
[1:38:00] doctrine of nicolan ism no one will deny
[1:38:04] that she is a mother she is a mother and
[1:38:07] has produced
[1:38:10] daughters now a daughter comes from
[1:38:12] comes out of a woman a woman robed in
[1:38:16] Scarlet sitting on Seven Hills of Rome
[1:38:19] she is a harlot and has born daughters
[1:38:24] those daughters are the Protestant
[1:38:25] churches that came out of her and then
[1:38:28] went right back into organization and
[1:38:32] nanism this mother of the daughter
[1:38:34] churches is called a that is a
[1:38:38] woman who was untrue to her marriage
[1:38:41] vows she was married to God she was
[1:38:44] married to God Amen and then went off
[1:38:49] fornicating with the devil and in her
[1:38:52] fornications
[1:38:53] she has brought forth daughters that are
[1:38:56] just like her this mother and daughter
[1:38:58] combination is anti- word anti-p and
[1:39:02] consequently Antichrist yes
[1:39:05] Antichrist
[1:39:08] amen now before I get too far along I
[1:39:12] want to mention that these early Bishops
[1:39:15] thought that they were above the word I
[1:39:18] say Lord help us amen they told people
[1:39:23] they could forgive their sins upon
[1:39:25] confession of those sins that never was
[1:39:29] the truth they began to baptize infants
[1:39:32] in the 2 Century they actually practiced
[1:39:35] regeneration of baptism no wonder people
[1:39:38] are mixed up today if they were so mixed
[1:39:41] up then so close to Pentecost now they
[1:39:45] are in a most desperate condition being
[1:39:48] 2,000 years away from original truth oh
[1:39:52] Church of God there is only one hope get
[1:39:55] back to the word and stay with it amen
[1:39:58] isn't that a prophet's word isn't that
[1:40:01] what the prophet said all the way
[1:40:02] through the Bible just get back to the
[1:40:06] word now we go back to the verse
[1:40:10] 14 Revelations 2:14 thou Hast them there
[1:40:14] that hold the doctrine of balum who
[1:40:16] taught baac to cast a stumbling block
[1:40:19] before the children of Israel to eat
[1:40:20] things sacrificed unto idols and to
[1:40:22] commit
[1:40:24] fornication the doctrine of balum now
[1:40:27] we'll just start this and go as far as
[1:40:29] we can Amen brother Adam says now you
[1:40:32] just can't have
[1:40:34] nickan setup in the church and not have
[1:40:38] this other Doctrine come in
[1:40:41] too this one really got me because I
[1:40:43] didn't realize they were linked until I
[1:40:46] started to read this and study this and
[1:40:48] and understand this in in the message
[1:40:50] here you can't you you just can't have a
[1:40:54] nickan set up in the church and not have
[1:40:57] this other Doctrine come
[1:41:00] [Laughter]
[1:41:02] into you see if you take away the word
[1:41:06] of God and the moving of the spirit as a
[1:41:09] means of
[1:41:10] worship they that worship me must
[1:41:14] worship me in spirit and in truth amen
[1:41:18] and when have people human beings ever
[1:41:20] been able to Worship in spirit and Truth
[1:41:22] like they can today right we know that
[1:41:24] where much is given much will be
[1:41:26] required and for us to say that things
[1:41:29] need to be a certain way or I can't
[1:41:30] worship I don't know I wouldn't want to
[1:41:33] go and tell them that then you will have
[1:41:35] to give the people another form of
[1:41:38] worship as a
[1:41:39] substitute and substitution spells
[1:41:43] bism and what's that substitution going
[1:41:46] to be I worship my way I go to church my
[1:41:50] way I I follow the message my way
[1:41:52] whatever it can be worship raising your
[1:41:54] hands maybe you just sing maybe you
[1:41:56] don't sing maybe you just sit maybe you
[1:41:58] don't stand maybe you don't come to
[1:42:00] church you just play tapes whatever it
[1:42:02] is we worship and we worship in spirit
[1:42:05] the Holy Ghost and in truth the message
[1:42:09] of the hour for our day the tying up of
[1:42:12] all the Loose Ends throughout all the
[1:42:13] ages that the prophets and the sages
[1:42:15] desired to look upon even angels wanted
[1:42:18] to see what we could see amen my how
[1:42:20] could we not worship I just love how he
[1:42:22] says this though you can't have Nicol
[1:42:24] nianis without having the doctrine of
[1:42:26] balum he goes on to say if we are going
[1:42:29] to understand what the doctrine of balum
[1:42:32] is in the New Testament Church we had
[1:42:34] better go back and see what it was in
[1:42:36] the Old Testament Church and apply it to
[1:42:39] that third age and then bring it up to
[1:42:42] the present this isn't just a historical
[1:42:44] talk this is about understanding the
[1:42:46] spirit is alive and well today both of
[1:42:49] these spirits nanism and the doctrine of
[1:42:52] balum they're
[1:42:55] friends now we know that Israel was the
[1:42:58] chosen people of God they were the
[1:43:00] Pentecostals of their day they had taken
[1:43:03] Refuge under the
[1:43:04] blood didn't they the Passover they had
[1:43:08] all been baptized in the Red Sea they
[1:43:11] all crossed over and they came up out of
[1:43:14] the waters singing in the
[1:43:18] spirit and what dancing under the energy
[1:43:22] of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:23] ghost but yet the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:43:25] given how could that
[1:43:28] be if the same spirit that raised up
[1:43:32] Jesus Christ from the dead dwells in you
[1:43:34] brothers and sisters you're going to
[1:43:36] want to beat a tambourine because you
[1:43:38] recognize what he's done for
[1:43:43] you my dancing under the energy of the
[1:43:48] Holy Ghost while Miriam the prophetess
[1:43:51] played her tambourine well after a
[1:43:54] certain time of journeying these
[1:43:56] children of Israel came to
[1:43:58] Moab I just love how he ties up the
[1:44:01] history how he brings things out and and
[1:44:03] shows sort of where these things come
[1:44:05] from and and how they tie together he
[1:44:07] says you remember who Moab was he was
[1:44:10] the son of lot by one of his own
[1:44:12] daughters it wasn't in a proper
[1:44:15] relationship and lot in turn was the
[1:44:18] nephew of Abraham so Israel and Moab
[1:44:21] they were related
[1:44:23] I want you to see that he says why does
[1:44:26] he want us to see that the moabites knew
[1:44:29] the truth whether they lived up to it or
[1:44:33] not so Israel came up to the borders of
[1:44:36] Moab and sent Messengers to the king
[1:44:38] saying we're brothers let us pass
[1:44:41] through your land if our people or our
[1:44:44] animals eat or drink
[1:44:46] anything we will gladly pay for it but
[1:44:50] King baac got very excited
[1:44:54] and you
[1:44:55] know I'll call the musicians so we'll
[1:44:57] end on time
[1:45:00] tonight he says that head of the nickan
[1:45:03] bunch was not about to let the church
[1:45:05] come through with its signs and wonders
[1:45:08] and diverse manifestations of the Holy
[1:45:11] Ghost isn't it interesting how he ties
[1:45:14] that
[1:45:15] together the children of Israel I don't
[1:45:18] think it says in the Old Testament
[1:45:20] anything about the Holy Ghost does it I
[1:45:22] could be wrong about that but I don't
[1:45:23] think it talks about the children of
[1:45:25] Israel Having the Holy Ghost but yet we
[1:45:27] have a prophet in our day the Vindicated
[1:45:29] Prophet saying that they had the signs
[1:45:31] and wonders they they had the pillar of
[1:45:33] fire and they had the cloud they had the
[1:45:36] leadership of God in their lives so they
[1:45:39] had the Holy Ghost because he is the
[1:45:41] same yesterday today and forever but by
[1:45:44] that leadership of the Holy Ghost here
[1:45:46] we have this King that doesn't want
[1:45:48] anything to do with it because they're
[1:45:50] just a little too
[1:45:51] excitable they they just play their
[1:45:53] music a little bit too loud maybe they
[1:45:55] sing some modern songs and not just the
[1:45:57] oldtime religion hymns but they had the
[1:46:01] Holy Ghost he says with their faces
[1:46:03] shining with the glory of God it was too
[1:46:06] risky as he might lose some of his crowd
[1:46:09] so bailo refused to let Israel pass
[1:46:12] through no we don't want any of those
[1:46:13] Holy Rollers coming here don't be
[1:46:14] getting too excited in our midst in our
[1:46:16] gates don't do that you're going to be
[1:46:18] out of order we know that brother bradam
[1:46:20] came and he set the church in order
[1:46:22] Christ came through brother Bram and set
[1:46:24] the church in order if there's going to
[1:46:25] be a speaking in tongues it's going to
[1:46:27] be done according to the word of God and
[1:46:30] that's part of the word of God speaking
[1:46:31] in tongues there's many different gifts
[1:46:34] of the Spirit a and we're not going to
[1:46:36] put a a stopper on any one of them but
[1:46:38] they're going to be according to the
[1:46:39] word yes sir because if they're not
[1:46:41] according to the word the devil can
[1:46:43] impersonate any one of those gifts and
[1:46:45] he will yes sir and if we allow him to
[1:46:49] then we're going to be responsible for
[1:46:51] it yes sir but if gifts manifest and
[1:46:53] they're not according to the word then
[1:46:55] you know what the prophet said he said
[1:46:56] you got a devil in your
[1:46:58] midst we got to know where we stand
[1:47:00] brothers and sisters this is spiritual
[1:47:02] warfare this is not
[1:47:04] playtime brother bradam goes on to say
[1:47:06] in fact so great was his fear of them
[1:47:09] isn't it interesting the fear of of
[1:47:12] unbelievers so great was his fear of
[1:47:15] them that he went to a hirling prophet
[1:47:18] called balum and asked him to mediate
[1:47:21] between him and God and petition the
[1:47:24] almighty to curse Israel and render them
[1:47:27] impotent to try and take that down and
[1:47:30] you know brothers and sisters if we're
[1:47:32] not careful we can get that Spirit upon
[1:47:34] us and that Spirit isn't going to
[1:47:36] manifest as a monster that spirit's
[1:47:38] going to manifest in
[1:47:40] words Spirits travel in words the
[1:47:44] doctrine of the nicians and and the
[1:47:46] doctrine of balum is going to travel in
[1:47:49] words do you know that brother do you
[1:47:51] know what he does do do you know that
[1:47:53] sister do you know how she dresses do
[1:47:55] you know that that other person that
[1:47:57] Pastor do you know that deacon do you
[1:47:59] know that song leader let's talk about
[1:48:02] their hinder Parts I want to say it
[1:48:04] again tonight the spirit of the Living
[1:48:06] God in in the True Believer is going to
[1:48:09] say shut your mouth Ministry I don't
[1:48:11] want to hear one word of it because I
[1:48:13] know it's the devil amen because the
[1:48:17] word of God says if you've got an
[1:48:18] accusation against someone what should
[1:48:19] you
[1:48:20] do go to someone else and tell them
[1:48:22] about it and say oh I don't like what
[1:48:23] that brother did did you see what he did
[1:48:25] we need we need to maybe do something
[1:48:27] about that maybe we need to form a
[1:48:28] committee and and and and take a
[1:48:31] vote what we need to do is go to that
[1:48:33] brother and go to that sister and tell
[1:48:36] them what's happened and allow God to
[1:48:39] come on the scene and move amen but if
[1:48:42] we're not careful this spirit is Alive
[1:48:44] and Well brothers and sisters I'm I'm
[1:48:46] saying it this way because I know I'm
[1:48:48] guilty I've talked about people in the
[1:48:50] past and I've had to go say hey
[1:48:53] I've said stuff and I'm sorry because I
[1:48:56] know it's not right and maybe even if it
[1:48:59] is right it's out of turn it's not up to
[1:49:01] me to go and talk about maybe stand with
[1:49:04] me as we close this this this is super
[1:49:08] powerful this can either tie people down
[1:49:11] or set people free by the way I see it
[1:49:14] if we're able to understand the doctrine
[1:49:17] of the nicians the lordship over man in
[1:49:20] the church and and and the doctrine of
[1:49:23] balum trying to cast a stumbling block
[1:49:27] my what is it say in the words here he
[1:49:30] says but I have a few things against
[1:49:32] thee in verse 14 because thou Hast them
[1:49:34] there that hold the doctrine of balam
[1:49:36] who taught baac to cast a stumbling
[1:49:39] block before the children of Israel
[1:49:41] could you imagine standing on that day
[1:49:44] and being told by the video that's
[1:49:47] played back on the Jumbotron of Our
[1:49:49] Lives that we taught someone to cast a
[1:49:53] stumbling block before another believer
[1:49:56] and changed their
[1:49:58] walk took away their ability to have the
[1:50:01] victory of the Holy Ghost in their
[1:50:04] life we've got to guard
[1:50:07] ourselves to eat things sacrificed on I
[1:50:10] it's okay we can just do it it's it's
[1:50:12] fine we can we can have idolatry and
[1:50:14] still serve God in the message of the
[1:50:16] hour we we can commit fornication and
[1:50:19] it's okay we'll we'll still be okay
[1:50:21] it'll just work out we don't have to
[1:50:23] worry about it you know what the prophet
[1:50:25] says is the natural types the
[1:50:29] spiritual the natural types the
[1:50:32] spiritual God bless you tonight let's
[1:50:33] just pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[1:50:37] Jesus we certainly love you and we thank
[1:50:40] you for your word we thank you for the
[1:50:43] the words that you gave to your
[1:50:44] Vindicated Prophet Lord we know that
[1:50:47] those words were for whosoever has an
[1:50:50] ear and Lord we're so thankful that we
[1:50:52] have ears to hear what your spirit says
[1:50:54] to the
[1:50:55] church and even as I read these things
[1:50:57] Lord and I I can see things around and
[1:51:01] father I just pray that Lord I I don't
[1:51:03] want to point the finger at anyone I
[1:51:05] want to point the finger at me I want to
[1:51:07] say Lord forgive me if I have ever gone
[1:51:10] down the road of entertaining either one
[1:51:13] of these Spirits Lord oh Father we know
[1:51:15] that this is exactly what the devil
[1:51:17] wants he wants to get in the church he
[1:51:19] wants to cause it to be lukewarm formal
[1:51:22] and powerless but we know that you said
[1:51:24] there will come a time and now is where
[1:51:28] men will worship you in spirit and in
[1:51:31] truth and father I know full well that I
[1:51:34] was just like that woman at the well
[1:51:37] father I I I had my life as a wreck but
[1:51:40] you came along and you spoke to me you
[1:51:42] went out of your way Lord Jesus to come
[1:51:44] and speak to me father I pray that we
[1:51:46] would all be able to recognize that if
[1:51:48] we have ears to hear that you have given
[1:51:50] us the ability to talk with with you
