[0:00] God bless you church.
[0:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:02] &gt;&gt; Uh so church, uh the choir has a song of
[0:04] testimony that they want to give to you
[0:05] today. Um we know that the Bible says
[0:09] that the devil goes around like a
[0:11] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.
[0:13] But that same Bible tells us that God
[0:15] has not given us a spirit of fear,
[0:18] &gt;&gt; but a spirit of love, power, and of a
[0:21] sound mind. Amen.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; And so the choir here wants to give you
[0:25] their testimony of how with God we
[0:29] should have no fear. So if that is your
[0:32] testimony and you know the song, please
[0:33] feel free to sing along, clap along.
[0:35] Let's give God all the glory today.
[0:37] Okay?
[0:38] &gt;&gt; And let's show the devil that he has no
[0:40] control over us. No matter what
[0:42] situation he brings to us, be it
[0:44] financial, be it health, be it family,
[0:48] be it whatever it is, in everything that
[0:51] the devil brings our way with God, we
[0:54] will have no fear. Amen.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21] Come on. Quiet.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; I got enemies every
[1:31] time. You might think that I'd be
[1:34] afraid. Running scared with the shake of
[1:36] faith. But the God I know says it ain't
[1:39] over. The God I know is going to make a
[1:41] way.
[1:44] Though I walk
[1:47] through the valley,
[1:50] I will have no fear,
[1:54] no fear, no fear. The mighty power Jesus
[1:59] is fighting for me. No fear,
[2:02] &gt;&gt; no fear,
[2:03] &gt;&gt; no fear,
[2:05] &gt;&gt; no fear.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; The light of the world makes the
[2:09] darkness disappear. No fear,
[2:13] my
[2:15] life. No fear, my
[2:18] life, my life.
[2:30] No fear when I'm walking through the
[2:32] fire cuz I know what me
[2:47] is.
[2:49] Come on.
[2:55] Heat. Heat.
[3:12] Hallelujah.
[3:20] Future not
[3:27] bad
[3:29] in the struggles.
[3:33] Heat. Heat.
[3:43] Heat.
[3:52] Heat.
[4:02] Heat. Heat.
[4:17] Heat. Heat.
[4:28] My
[4:30] life
[4:33] in my life.
[4:36] No fear. Not my life. Not my life. My
[4:40] life. No fear.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Not over my life. My life. Not over my
[4:44] life. No fear.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Not over my life. Not my life. You have
[4:49] no fear.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
