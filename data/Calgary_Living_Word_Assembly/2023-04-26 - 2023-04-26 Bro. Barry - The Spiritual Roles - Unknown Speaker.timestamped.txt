[43:57] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[44:00] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[44:03] good and sendeth Reign on the just and
[44:06] on the unjust
[44:08] for if you love them
[44:10] which love you
[44:12] what reward have ye
[44:14] do not even the publicans the same
[44:18] and if ye salute your brethren only
[44:21] what do ye more than others
[44:24] do not even the publicans so
[44:28] be therefore perfect even as your father
[44:31] which is in heaven is perfect
[44:34] let's just turn over to Hebrews chapter
[44:36] 6.
[45:03] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 says therefore
[45:07] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[45:09] of Christ let us go on to perfection
[45:13] not laying again the foundation of
[45:15] repentance from dead works
[45:17] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[45:21] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[45:24] and of the resurrection of the Dead
[45:27] and of Eternal judgment
[45:29] and this will we do if God permit let's
[45:33] just bow in prayer one more time
[45:36] Heavenly Father we know that your word
[45:38] is true and all heavens and earth will
[45:40] pass away but only your word will remain
[45:43] father tonight we pray that you would
[45:45] just magnify this word to us Lord that
[45:48] you would amplify it to our souls Lord
[45:50] Jesus father that that's what we would
[45:52] be dwelling on as we
[45:54] endure this service tonight father and
[45:57] as we go forwards this week father that
[46:00] you would just be speaking to us through
[46:02] this word that we read tonight we just
[46:04] ask all these things now in Jesus
[46:06] Christ's name we pray amen
[46:08] amen God bless you tonight you may be
[46:10] seated
[46:13] I just uh sometimes have a real struggle
[46:16] coming
[46:17] to church and
[46:19] thinking about how we could ever have as
[46:22] good a service as we did on Sunday on
[46:25] Wednesday and sometimes a Wednesday
[46:26] service I think about it how could we
[46:28] ever how as good a service on Sunday as
[46:31] we had last Wednesday
[46:33] and uh you know I know for sure on my
[46:36] own there's no way that would ever
[46:37] happen I'm certainly thankful
[46:39] that he's faithful
[46:42] tonight I want to talk about our roles
[46:44] and uh you know we've read extensively
[46:48] um out of the book of Ephesians we could
[46:51] potentially turn there might as well
[46:52] still have a few minutes
[46:54] Ephesians chapter 5 just as a reminder
[46:59] talking about the roles of the family
[47:01] roles of the husband roles of the wife
[47:04] or the role of the husband the role of
[47:07] the wife the role of the children in
[47:10] Hebrews chapter 6.
[47:14] but really
[47:16] um
[47:17] I'll just read verse 31.
[47:20] for verse 30. 31 and 32 of Ephesians
[47:24] chapter 5.
[47:26] for we are members of his body of his
[47:29] flesh and of his bones
[47:32] I just want to say how are we members of
[47:34] his body and of his flesh and of his
[47:36] bones
[47:38] anybody see Jesus body or his flesh or
[47:41] his bones
[47:42] we don't see it verse 31 for this cause
[47:45] shall a man leave his father and mother
[47:47] and shall be joined unto his wife
[47:49] and they too shall be one flesh
[47:54] this is a great mystery but I speak
[47:56] concerning Christ in the church
[47:59] nevertheless let every one of you in
[48:01] particular so love his wife even as
[48:03] himself
[48:04] and the wife see that she reverends her
[48:06] husband
[48:07] and we know that chapter 6 goes right
[48:10] into children obeying their parents
[48:11] because this is right honor thy father
[48:14] and thy mother which is the first
[48:15] commandment with promise that it may be
[48:17] well with thee that thou mayest live
[48:19] long on the Earth
[48:20] new fathers provoke not your children to
[48:22] wrath but bring them up in the nurture
[48:24] and admonition of the Lord
[48:27] what we're talking about here is being
[48:29] the children of the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:32] but I would say it's even
[48:35] more beautiful we can look at it and say
[48:37] yeah we are Sons and Daughters of the
[48:38] most high God but there's some that are
[48:42] the Bride of Jesus Christ there's some
[48:45] that are the wife
[48:46] and you know it's a difficult thing but
[48:49] it's true
[48:51] the husband and wife relationship is a
[48:53] lot more intimate than the parents to
[48:54] the children
[48:56] and there's a lot of children but
[48:58] there's only one bride
[48:59] you can have many children but there's
[49:01] only going to be one wife if you're
[49:03] living your life according to the word
[49:06] you know tonight talking about our
[49:08] scripture and Perfection I just want to
[49:10] read this quote and uh brother says it
[49:13] and I don't know if you want to bring it
[49:15] up brother it's out of uh 54 1203 the
[49:19] law having a shadow
[49:23] it's paragraph 23 and so is every man
[49:26] and woman that's born of the spirit of
[49:29] God
[49:30] it isn't you become changed
[49:33] there's something about you that
[49:35] something has moved in made you a
[49:38] different person
[49:40] you look on life different
[49:42] you look at things different
[49:45] it isn't you that's bubbling
[49:49] it's something within you pushing it out
[49:53] it's Christ pushing out the testimony
[49:56] and the life
[49:58] and it all comes back to Christ
[50:02] the law having a shadow of things to
[50:04] come could not make the comer perfect
[50:08] what's the subject Paul speaking of here
[50:10] perfection
[50:11] God requires perfection
[50:15] and there's no way that we're ever going
[50:17] to be perfect the only way that we're
[50:19] ever going to try and make ourselves
[50:21] perfect let me say it this way I don't
[50:22] say it right if we try and make
[50:25] ourselves perfect brothers and sisters
[50:27] then we're doing it Cain's way
[50:30] Cain tried to make himself perfect but
[50:33] if he would have just done like his
[50:35] brother which is what God gave him
[50:37] he didn't have the Revelation Abel was
[50:40] given the Revelation but Cain was
[50:42] corrected but that thing inside of him
[50:44] Pride just wouldn't accept that
[50:46] correction
[50:47] it just couldn't receive it there was
[50:49] nothing inside of him to be able to
[50:51] receive that correction but boy isn't it
[50:54] wonderful we can go to a service and we
[50:56] know that God speaks to us through the
[50:58] the pulpit whoever it is that's
[51:01] preaching sometimes we hear I hear it
[51:04] and it just it blows me away I'm so
[51:06] thankful for it because there's times
[51:08] where as a minister you can get down
[51:10] thinking how can I possibly be bringing
[51:13] things week after week and and it's
[51:16] going to help the people but then you
[51:18] have somebody say you were talking about
[51:20] our conversation last night till
[51:22] midnight you weren't there with us but
[51:25] we know who was and it's at that point I
[51:27] think Lord thank you because there's no
[51:30] way I could ever do it
[51:31] not myself
[51:33] but what we're talking about is Christ
[51:36] Living out through the believer having
[51:38] his life bubbling out through us he says
[51:42] what's the subject Paul's speaking of
[51:44] here Perfection God requires perfection
[51:48] no one could ever come to Heaven outside
[51:51] of being perfect
[51:53] now let's talk about our roles brothers
[51:55] and sisters we've got to be perfect in
[51:58] our roles in our positions how are we
[52:02] ever going to be perfect husbands how
[52:05] are we going to be perfect wives how are
[52:08] we going to be perfect children
[52:10] it's a mystery
[52:12] but you know brother Branham says the
[52:14] mystery is history
[52:15] because that book became a new book when
[52:17] them seals were opened when all of them
[52:20] were opened and what it did was it
[52:21] allowed us to see that we are no longer
[52:24] children tossed to and fro with every
[52:27] slide of men in the cunning craftiness
[52:29] of the devil but what we are is rooted
[52:33] and grounded in love we have the Holy
[52:35] Ghost living out through us quickening
[52:37] this word to us that's fully open and we
[52:39] can say wow I recognize the only way I'm
[52:42] going to be perfect is to align myself
[52:43] completely with God's word
[52:46] and that's that's that's the only way
[52:49] that I'm going to be perfect but there's
[52:50] no way that I'm ever going to be able to
[52:52] do it myself
[52:53] I can't go to church enough I can't pay
[52:57] enough tithes I can't sing enough I
[53:00] can't play enough I can't do enough for
[53:02] the people in the community I can't do
[53:04] enough the only thing I can do is
[53:06] surrender but boy brothers and sisters
[53:09] when we can surrender ourselves one to
[53:11] another in the fear of God submitting
[53:13] ourselves one to another in the fear of
[53:15] God boy then we're getting somewhere
[53:19] then we're willing to say there's
[53:20] nothing inside of me that won't mix with
[53:23] that word when it comes I don't have
[53:25] pride getting in the way of that word
[53:27] when it comes to me but but here we have
[53:30] brother Brad I'm saying what's the
[53:31] subject Paul speaking of here Perfection
[53:32] God requires Perfection no one could
[53:35] ever come to Heaven outside of being
[53:37] perfect now sit still just a minute look
[53:41] perfect you must be perfect and yet the
[53:44] scripture says not as perfect
[53:46] so if you must be perfect to come to
[53:48] heaven then and the scripture says None
[53:50] is perfect and we've all sinned and come
[53:52] short of the glory of God how are we
[53:54] ever going to enter God's living place
[53:57] and Dwelling Place when he requires
[53:59] perfection
[54:02] I think he just he says it so clearly
[54:04] how are we ever going to do it
[54:08] Jesus said
[54:10] I Believe In The Sermon on the Mount he
[54:13] said be therefore perfect
[54:15] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[54:17] think of the Perfection that God
[54:20] requires of the person
[54:22] a Perfection this is in 1954 the law
[54:26] having a shadow but if we go back a
[54:29] little bit in this in in this scripture
[54:31] that we read the first one we read
[54:33] tonight out of Matthew chapter 5.
[54:36] you know brother uh Jesus here given The
[54:40] Sermon on the Mount what he's talking to
[54:42] the people saying to to love your
[54:44] enemies bless them that curse you do
[54:46] good to them that hate you and pray for
[54:49] them which despitefully use you and
[54:50] persecute you that you may be the
[54:52] children of your father which is in
[54:54] heaven
[54:55] and he just the way he explains it here
[54:57] he doesn't leave any room for doubt
[54:59] there's no room for any negotiation
[55:03] about it we need to love our enemies
[55:05] brothers and sisters how much more our
[55:08] husbands how much more are wives
[55:10] how much more ought we as children to
[55:13] obey our parents
[55:15] but the only way we're going to have
[55:16] perfection in our lives is Christ to
[55:18] himself being perfect in us we can have
[55:21] perfect hair we can have perfect clothes
[55:23] we can have a perfect house we can have
[55:25] a perfect career we can have a perfect
[55:27] Investment Portfolio and all of it is
[55:30] going to burn all of it is for naught
[55:31] the only thing that's going to last is
[55:34] the spirit of Jesus Christ Living out
[55:36] through us that's the Perfection that
[55:38] he's looking for brothers and sisters
[55:41] came he had a works-based religion
[55:44] if we're we're dealing with Works
[55:46] brothers and sisters who are missing it
[55:48] but you know some people will say it
[55:50] fake it till you make it that's a
[55:52] business World thing just get up and go
[55:54] and and do and keep going and eventually
[55:57] it might happen and you know what it
[55:58] might happen if you do that but really
[56:00] the only thing that's going to happen is
[56:02] to surrender it's complete and total
[56:05] surrender and tonight how does that
[56:06] apply brother Berry to the roles in the
[56:08] family is it's surrendering to the to
[56:11] the roles in the family according to the
[56:12] word of God and understanding that the
[56:15] only way we're going to be perfect is to
[56:17] align ourselves with God's word 100
[56:19] percent
[56:22] we can't say I've got a we said it on
[56:25] Sunday I think we did anyways we can't
[56:26] say that we've got a cultural thing or
[56:28] something from my culture there's
[56:30] something from my family I've got a
[56:31] tradition that just keeps me you know
[56:33] gives me Liberties so to speak in in the
[56:37] message it allows me to have a temper it
[56:39] allows me to have bitterness or
[56:41] unforgiveness I can't say that that's
[56:43] acceptable I would never say that and
[56:45] and neither can anyone according to the
[56:47] word of God we've got to forgive we've
[56:49] got to forgive our enemies how much more
[56:50] our husbands and our wives
[56:53] and sometimes things actually can just
[56:55] get swept under the rug I don't even
[56:57] know I'm talking like this tonight but I
[56:59] I guess it's just the will of the Lord
[57:00] and we'll just go with it but our
[57:02] position sometimes we we can read it we
[57:05] can see our position sometimes in the
[57:07] word of God and I just can't help but
[57:09] think about like a a job sometimes we
[57:11] get a job we get offered a position in a
[57:13] company and we go to that company and we
[57:15] work in that company and we can have a a
[57:17] really well-defined laid out job
[57:20] description and sometimes it doesn't
[57:22] make sense to us really we can read it
[57:24] and say well I understand it but until
[57:27] we actually see how that fits inside the
[57:29] company it can seem a little bit
[57:31] nebulous a little bit unsure but once we
[57:34] get going then it can become clear and
[57:36] sometimes that's what we need to do is
[57:38] get into a position and be able to see
[57:40] what it actually is and I know this for
[57:43] sure
[57:44] when people will describe getting
[57:47] married it seems to be such a tremendous
[57:50] thing for those people who have never
[57:52] been married it's still a tremendous
[57:54] thing for those who have been married
[57:56] don't don't don't don't don't don't
[57:57] don't don't think I'm going wrong with
[57:59] that I'm not but you know when we're
[58:02] when we're looking at getting married
[58:03] and we're maybe uh engaged and we're
[58:06] going down that road we we think about
[58:09] all the different ways that we will
[58:11] explore marriage and and where we will
[58:13] live and and the dreams start to grow
[58:16] and and our lives we we can see the the
[58:19] life maybe forming on the horizons and
[58:22] you know sometimes when we get into our
[58:23] positions as a husband and a wife it
[58:25] doesn't always line up the way that we
[58:28] think that it will when we have those
[58:30] Visions before we actually get married
[58:32] sometimes we think that we're gonna have
[58:34] like a perfect night's sleep every
[58:36] single night but you know it doesn't
[58:38] work that way when you have children
[58:40] when you have children that sleep cycle
[58:42] completely flips upside down for the
[58:45] husband and the wife probably more so
[58:46] for the wives but that's how it is
[58:49] there's different things that happen in
[58:51] our lives they they change but sometimes
[58:54] we don't see those things in our
[58:56] position in the job descriptions that
[58:58] were given
[59:00] sometimes the job description is is just
[59:02] is just difficult to understand until
[59:04] you actually get on the job
[59:06] but it doesn't mean that we're wrong
[59:08] doesn't mean that we're doing things out
[59:10] of order we just need to go back to that
[59:12] job description and say am I doing
[59:14] things according to what I agreed to do
[59:16] to the for the company for the boss if I
[59:19] am then that's great but if I'm not then
[59:22] why aren't I we need to kind of go back
[59:24] and recalibrate and say what's going on
[59:26] sometimes in a marriage we need to do
[59:28] that according to the word of God we
[59:30] need to step back and say you know the
[59:33] cares of Life have maybe gotten in the
[59:35] way and I might have had so many other
[59:37] things going on I just got a little bit
[59:38] cloudy with what my job description was
[59:41] according to the role in in my family
[59:45] but you know sometimes we can get so
[59:48] many things going on we can just forget
[59:49] what the original job description is
[59:52] sometimes when we work for a company we
[59:54] could be doing way more than what our
[59:56] original position called for because we
[59:59] just know these things need to happen
[1:00:00] and instead of trying to go and ask
[1:00:03] someone can you get someone to do this
[1:00:05] and get someone to do that it's easier
[1:00:07] just to get it and do it and have it
[1:00:09] done and then know that you can get on
[1:00:10] with what your task is sometimes that's
[1:00:13] just how it is and you know that's the
[1:00:15] same thing in a marriage the same thing
[1:00:17] in a relationship we just sometimes need
[1:00:19] to just do things that way I I had it
[1:00:22] said one time that you know what happens
[1:00:24] is the employees in a company what they
[1:00:27] will do is actually pick up the slack so
[1:00:30] that the whole team goes together and
[1:00:32] you know we can do that in our lives as
[1:00:34] brothers and sisters in the church we
[1:00:36] can do it as a family as husbands and
[1:00:38] wives as parents with children as
[1:00:40] children even for parents we can pick up
[1:00:42] the slack for one another instead of
[1:00:44] trying to point out that someone isn't
[1:00:46] doing something we can just go and do it
[1:00:48] for them and try and encourage them and
[1:00:50] let them know hey you know what that's
[1:00:52] done you don't have to worry about it
[1:00:54] that's what happens when you're on a
[1:00:56] team
[1:00:59] sometimes the original job description
[1:01:01] can just get a little bit
[1:01:02] muddy or or maybe forgotten maybe just a
[1:01:06] little bit cloudy a little bit foggy
[1:01:08] maybe we just forget a little bit about
[1:01:10] the original description of our jobs
[1:01:13] but that's why I think it's so beautiful
[1:01:15] when we can say you know we have an
[1:01:16] absolute and that absolute is the word
[1:01:19] of God and what excuse me when we have
[1:01:22] that boy we have the ability to
[1:01:24] recalibrate ourselves and and you know
[1:01:27] when we have that ability to see
[1:01:29] something that maybe isn't right maybe
[1:01:32] something is wrong then we can just
[1:01:34] humble ourselves to the word of God ask
[1:01:36] him to forgive us and you know he'll say
[1:01:38] don't worry about it just go make it
[1:01:40] right with that other person though go
[1:01:41] and make it right with that other
[1:01:42] situation though and when we do that
[1:01:44] then we can just go on in our positions
[1:01:48] I think it's so beautiful
[1:01:49] but you know he has given us a position
[1:01:52] in his word and and tonight we're not
[1:01:55] just talking about families I I know the
[1:01:57] roles of families are are wonderful the
[1:02:01] topic is beautiful but the hour and the
[1:02:04] season in which we're in brothers and
[1:02:05] sisters is our role in Jesus Christ that
[1:02:09] is really where we're at and and if we
[1:02:11] can just continually hold that before
[1:02:14] the people before the church before our
[1:02:16] eyes even myself just continually remind
[1:02:19] ourselves that's really what our
[1:02:21] position is and and our position is in
[1:02:24] him and and his will for us for each one
[1:02:27] of us is his word remember that his will
[1:02:31] is his word if we ever have a doubt
[1:02:34] about what our uh we should be doing
[1:02:36] what our our position is where we're at
[1:02:39] it's his word
[1:02:41] we were talking about this in in the
[1:02:43] back on Sunday and I think it's such a
[1:02:45] beautiful topic it's something I know
[1:02:47] the Lord made so magnified and real to
[1:02:49] me in my life our our lives are are a
[1:02:53] combination of things Journeys that we
[1:02:55] go on but our our our careers and and
[1:02:59] our church and and our families
[1:03:01] everything that we do is not his will
[1:03:05] per se it's not a destination I'm sorry
[1:03:09] I'm wording it wrong our our his will is
[1:03:12] not a destination that's what I'm trying
[1:03:14] to say it's not something we're going to
[1:03:15] achieve we're not going to say God God
[1:03:17] wants me to be a doctor so it's his will
[1:03:20] for me to be a doctor maybe it is and
[1:03:23] maybe it isn't but what his will is
[1:03:25] brothers and sisters is as we go along
[1:03:27] the way to be a doctor is for us to
[1:03:30] practice his will in our lives
[1:03:32] I hope I didn't make that completely
[1:03:34] confusing I almost confused myself there
[1:03:35] I apologize but you know I I had that
[1:03:38] that struggle for a long time I heard
[1:03:40] brother Ken say it and and it's exactly
[1:03:42] according to the message of the hour and
[1:03:44] I think it's so beautiful because God
[1:03:46] made it so tremendously real to me his
[1:03:50] will is his word and we do want to pray
[1:03:53] for his will in our lives do you want me
[1:03:55] to go to university Lord because I want
[1:03:57] to be in your will do you want me to go
[1:04:00] to a trade school do you want me to move
[1:04:03] to another location do you want me to do
[1:04:05] this or that and and everything that we
[1:04:08] do we want to do it unto the Lord is
[1:04:10] what the word says but you know the
[1:04:12] Final Destination isn't his will his
[1:04:14] will is that we apply his word every
[1:04:17] step of the way that's his will
[1:04:21] and I I had asked the Lord for that when
[1:04:24] I struggled with it I just didn't
[1:04:25] understand it
[1:04:27] um I didn't reject it but he showed me
[1:04:30] take a look at Joseph in his life and
[1:04:32] take a look at Daniel in his life Joseph
[1:04:34] he just applied the word he just was he
[1:04:37] was completely brutalized taken
[1:04:40] advantage of mistreated but it was all
[1:04:43] for a purpose but all the way along he
[1:04:46] never mistreated the word in his life he
[1:04:48] applied the word in his life and what
[1:04:50] happened to him he was a type of Christ
[1:04:52] we know brother Branham said that very
[1:04:53] clearly in the Bible same thing with
[1:04:55] Daniel when Daniel was there he he was
[1:04:58] carried away into captivity he and the
[1:05:00] others were in the king's chamber and
[1:05:03] they could have eaten the meat from the
[1:05:05] king's table they could have drank the
[1:05:06] King's Wine they had the finest of of
[1:05:08] everyone in the land
[1:05:10] they had the king's Fair
[1:05:12] but they knew that that was against
[1:05:14] their law because that meat was
[1:05:16] sacrificed unto Idols before they ate it
[1:05:19] they knew that wine was not good wine
[1:05:21] according to their tradition they could
[1:05:23] have had it though it was the best
[1:05:24] everyone in the country probably would
[1:05:26] have had it I think I remember here
[1:05:27] hearing it preach once upon a time that
[1:05:29] you know the others who were held killed
[1:05:32] carried away in captivity they probably
[1:05:34] would have taken it but not these guys
[1:05:37] because they believed Daniel was a
[1:05:39] Believer he was being perfect according
[1:05:43] to God's word he was applying the word
[1:05:44] of God and it wasn't something that he
[1:05:46] was trying to do he wasn't living a
[1:05:48] Cain's religion he was just living his
[1:05:51] life because that's who he was and we
[1:05:53] know that he did not get to see the
[1:05:55] restoration
[1:05:56] though he prayed for it though he was
[1:05:59] there contending for it the restoration
[1:06:01] of the temple he did not get to see it
[1:06:03] he lived his entire life there in in in
[1:06:07] captivity anyways I'm going off on a
[1:06:10] complete tangent about it I apologize
[1:06:12] his will is his word every step of the
[1:06:14] way brothers and sisters it's not just a
[1:06:16] destination our destination is heaven
[1:06:18] it's not a place on Earth
[1:06:20] but our position all along the way is in
[1:06:23] his word and and you know concerning our
[1:06:25] positions our positions are in the word
[1:06:28] but I just think it's so beautiful how
[1:06:30] you know in the book of Ephesians how
[1:06:32] Paul speaks about it to the to the
[1:06:35] church and you know how brother Branham
[1:06:38] he talks about it very clearly that the
[1:06:40] book of Ephesians parallels Joshua
[1:06:42] Joshua parallels Ephesians and we can
[1:06:45] look at all of the different things in
[1:06:47] the book of Ephesians and you know
[1:06:49] before we can become Mighty Warriors in
[1:06:51] the word of God in the book of Ephesians
[1:06:54] we've got to get on our positions
[1:06:56] many people want to put on the whole
[1:06:57] armor of God we've talked about this in
[1:06:59] the past but first we need to get in our
[1:07:01] positions how can we put on the whole
[1:07:02] armor of God if we're not being a good
[1:07:04] husband if we're not being a good wife
[1:07:06] if we're disobeying our parents we're
[1:07:09] not going to be able to put on the whole
[1:07:11] armor of God the way that we would want
[1:07:13] to the way that God would want us to but
[1:07:16] boy when we get into our position then
[1:07:18] the devil knows that we are in our
[1:07:20] position and that's when he's going to
[1:07:21] back up that's when he's going to flee
[1:07:23] that's when he's going to know that we
[1:07:25] mean business
[1:07:26] I think it's a beautiful thing because
[1:07:28] when we get to that place brothers and
[1:07:30] sisters that's where we can start to
[1:07:32] declare that I and my father are one
[1:07:34] where we recognize that his word is our
[1:07:36] absolute it's our Anchor Point nothing
[1:07:38] can shake us from it there's nobody that
[1:07:40] can come around and say there's this
[1:07:42] great mystery in the message and someone
[1:07:45] has an angle on it or somewhere someone
[1:07:47] is doing something different we know
[1:07:49] that the word of God says you know when
[1:07:51] they say he's out in the desert don't go
[1:07:53] out after him no no no don't be moved by
[1:07:55] the the cunningness of men teaching for
[1:07:58] doctrines the Commandments of men don't
[1:08:00] do that you know we we've heard about it
[1:08:02] I'm sure that everyone has and if you
[1:08:04] haven't I'll mention it it's a it's it's
[1:08:06] a it's a sick thing that the the message
[1:08:09] of the hour has been infiltrated in
[1:08:11] Kenya and and many places in the world
[1:08:14] but now there there's people it's so
[1:08:17] terrible people saying that it's the
[1:08:19] message of the hour and you know what
[1:08:21] the message of the hour will never ever
[1:08:23] be infiltrated but it's the people who
[1:08:26] are claiming to propagate behind the
[1:08:29] message of their hour they're using it
[1:08:30] for a front so that they could actually
[1:08:32] achieve their own goals and we know it's
[1:08:34] it's doctrine of devils but they had a
[1:08:36] starvation thing and they put it on the
[1:08:38] news and a guy got arrested and I don't
[1:08:40] know how many people died they starved
[1:08:42] themselves to death according to this
[1:08:45] message of the hour is what they're
[1:08:46] calling and some of these people who are
[1:08:48] ex-message believers they've got a table
[1:08:50] and and they're showing all of the
[1:08:52] different message books that that were
[1:08:55] William Miriam bradham's material and
[1:08:57] they're saying that this is his fault
[1:08:58] and this is what he did it's a lie of
[1:09:00] the devil
[1:09:02] and I know I'm I'm I'm I'm talking to
[1:09:05] Believers here I'm not trying to justify
[1:09:07] it we don't have to justify it God will
[1:09:09] justify his own word God will vindicate
[1:09:12] his own word but the people who are uh
[1:09:15] talking about this I I was more
[1:09:17] surprised actually about the people who
[1:09:19] are talking about it than than what was
[1:09:21] actually happening there because we know
[1:09:24] that many people when they get too close
[1:09:26] if they don't get the baptism of the
[1:09:28] Holy Ghost what will happen is they will
[1:09:29] just burn up they'll just turn into a
[1:09:31] fanatic and they'll act funny about it
[1:09:33] you know and when we get the true
[1:09:35] baptism of the Holy Spirit what it does
[1:09:37] when anybody gets the true baptism Holy
[1:09:39] Spirit you just line up with the word of
[1:09:40] God you don't go funny you don't say
[1:09:43] that William Mary and Bradham gives you
[1:09:44] Liberties to do things that's outside of
[1:09:46] the word that's a devil that says that
[1:09:52] but there are a group of people that
[1:09:54] have the ability to say I am my father
[1:09:55] are one
[1:09:57] and how does that happen it's not great
[1:09:59] Fantastics it's not great Fanatics it's
[1:10:02] just simply taking him at his word and
[1:10:04] saying be it unto me according to your
[1:10:06] word and and if we have to take
[1:10:08] correction according to the word we
[1:10:10] gladly receive it because we know that
[1:10:12] if we can't receive it the word of God
[1:10:14] says that we're a bastard child we don't
[1:10:16] have a father if we can't receive
[1:10:18] correction by the word but boy when we
[1:10:21] can receive correction by the word it
[1:10:22] brings such a peace it brings such a
[1:10:24] rest it shows us that there's an anchor
[1:10:26] to our soul
[1:10:28] you know brother Brown and we I brought
[1:10:31] this quote last time I think
[1:10:33] um I'll just read it quickly and then
[1:10:34] I'll get in I'll push a little further
[1:10:36] ahead here brother Brad I'm out of
[1:10:37] questions and answers he says please
[1:10:38] explain people are saying brother
[1:10:39] Branham is more than a man he can create
[1:10:42] Jesus can look just like brother Branham
[1:10:46] now let me the person said this whoever
[1:10:48] it might be I don't know but I am your
[1:10:50] brother see Jesus is your savior I
[1:10:53] cannot be your savior for he has already
[1:10:56] saved you
[1:11:03] Christ
[1:11:04] if anybody were to ever just not go to
[1:11:06] Google and just listen to what William
[1:11:09] Marion Branham said and then just
[1:11:11] cross-reference it with the Bible
[1:11:13] they would have to say the same thing
[1:11:15] wow he just points to Jesus Christ
[1:11:19] he's not a fanatic
[1:11:22] but it takes a bit of effort
[1:11:24] he says now you're so close to being the
[1:11:26] truth there and yet so far from the
[1:11:29] truth
[1:11:30] the person
[1:11:32] that told this person this now it's just
[1:11:35] looks to me it's a woman's Hound rate
[1:11:37] very very beautiful handwriting and I'd
[1:11:39] say that's a woman's hand right wouldn't
[1:11:40] you brother Capps wouldn't you think
[1:11:41] that was a woman's handwrite pretty hand
[1:11:43] right and I know who who it is see
[1:11:45] brother Branham could Jesus look like
[1:11:48] you or you be Jesus or something like
[1:11:53] that
[1:11:55] here we have the prophet of God saying
[1:11:57] this one sense of the word that's
[1:11:59] exactly truth
[1:12:01] another sense of the word is an
[1:12:03] antichrist
[1:12:05] that's the difference between right and
[1:12:07] wrong
[1:12:08] to make me the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:11] Christ would be an antichrist
[1:12:16] and isn't it so true brothers and
[1:12:18] sisters that it is
[1:12:19] Razor Edge thing
[1:12:21] it gets that close so close that it
[1:12:24] would deceive the very elected if it
[1:12:27] were possible
[1:12:29] and and it takes
[1:12:31] it takes a level of Faith that's kind of
[1:12:35] beyond our comfort zone to really
[1:12:36] understand what he's saying here
[1:12:39] if we just Rely Upon Our traditional
[1:12:42] teachings and and theories that we've
[1:12:44] been given
[1:12:46] um I've seen it
[1:12:48] said this way and and I'll just say it
[1:12:51] this way you know when a child is born
[1:12:53] and he comes into a Catholic Family
[1:12:56] parents will say this is your religion
[1:12:59] this is it right here take it it's good
[1:13:03] if someone's born into a Pentecostal
[1:13:05] family
[1:13:06] it's no different if it's a Baptist
[1:13:08] Family it's no different if it's an
[1:13:11] Anglican or or a Methodist or a
[1:13:13] presbyterian it's still the same here's
[1:13:16] your religion this is what we believe
[1:13:18] right and and the children will take it
[1:13:20] and you know what that's the way
[1:13:22] families work
[1:13:23] and that's why the church has so much
[1:13:25] hold in people's lives and you know
[1:13:27] brothers and sisters
[1:13:29] friends and neighbors anyone who's
[1:13:31] listening I'll say it loud and clear
[1:13:32] it's the same thing with the message of
[1:13:34] the hour
[1:13:36] we hand it to our children and we say
[1:13:37] here this is what we believe this is the
[1:13:40] religion that we believe
[1:13:41] but we don't stop there we say the only
[1:13:44] way that that's going to actually come
[1:13:46] to life and have any value for you in
[1:13:48] your life is for you to receive the
[1:13:51] baptism of the Holy Spirit yourself it
[1:13:54] has got to be your religion your way
[1:13:57] with God it's got to be your own
[1:13:58] personal relationship and if the other
[1:14:00] religions would do that would say that
[1:14:02] you truly need to receive the word of
[1:14:05] God you need to receive the baptism of
[1:14:07] the Holy Spirit according to the word
[1:14:10] for your day you would get the Holy
[1:14:12] Ghost also
[1:14:15] but it's got to be the word for your day
[1:14:18] it can't be the word for another day
[1:14:20] I don't want to try and live under the
[1:14:22] Revival of Azusa Street that's a
[1:14:24] wonderful thing but it's like trying to
[1:14:26] say I want to live under the Revival of
[1:14:28] the upper Upper Room experience which
[1:14:30] one is more powerful one that's a
[1:14:32] hundred years or one that's two thousand
[1:14:34] years
[1:14:36] it's the quickening power brothers and
[1:14:37] sisters it's it's no less diluted or or
[1:14:40] weak today it's just as strong as it was
[1:14:43] in both of those occurrences
[1:14:45] but you know brother Brad I mean says
[1:14:47] this here for the person of the Lord
[1:14:48] Jesus Christ for me to be the person of
[1:14:50] the Lord Jesus Christ would be an
[1:14:51] antichrist see for that person of the
[1:14:53] Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand
[1:14:55] of the Majesty on high and will come
[1:14:57] again in great power and Glory but for
[1:14:59] his life that was in him being upon me
[1:15:02] and upon you who have him it's exactly
[1:15:05] the truth and you become Christ
[1:15:09] and that's very simple formula brothers
[1:15:12] and sisters when we eat the book we
[1:15:13] become the book and we know we've said
[1:15:15] it extensively Revelations 10. not one
[1:15:18] to seven but eight to eleven one to
[1:15:20] seven has happened and we said amen to
[1:15:22] one to seven but now what we need to say
[1:15:25] hey eight to eleven applies to someone
[1:15:27] someone needs to eat that book and go
[1:15:29] and prophesy again before many nations
[1:15:31] people's tongues and kings
[1:15:35] you know for years and years it was to
[1:15:37] be like Jesus wasn't it we sing that
[1:15:40] song to be like Jesus
[1:15:42] to be like Jesus I don't know the whole
[1:15:43] song but we know we sing that song we we
[1:15:45] had that for many years many people want
[1:15:48] to be like Jesus some people will try
[1:15:50] and dress like Jesus some people will
[1:15:52] try and Live Like Jesus but you know
[1:15:55] what we want to do is just be who we are
[1:15:57] and allow him like we've already read in
[1:16:00] that quote to be perfect is just to let
[1:16:01] his life live out through us
[1:16:03] but the only way that can happen is to
[1:16:05] receive the word for our day
[1:16:08] but for years and years it was to be
[1:16:09] like Jesus and now it is to be Jesus
[1:16:13] but we're not going to say we're going
[1:16:15] to worship any man there's no man on
[1:16:17] Earth that's ever going to get worshiped
[1:16:19] brothers and sisters the Believers I
[1:16:21] know we all believe this that we worship
[1:16:23] Jesus Christ and that's the only one
[1:16:25] that we worship we worship him because
[1:16:28] the word of God even says no man comes
[1:16:30] unto the father but by me
[1:16:32] but by Jesus Christ
[1:16:35] but today
[1:16:37] with the message of the hour today
[1:16:39] when we receive the word for our day
[1:16:41] when we take the book and eat it just
[1:16:43] like John was commanded to do when we do
[1:16:45] that how do we do that we take the
[1:16:47] message of the hour and we say Amen to
[1:16:49] it we say yeah but I believe it and you
[1:16:51] know you can't say you believe it until
[1:16:53] you believe it I wouldn't want anyone to
[1:16:55] say they believe it if they don't
[1:16:57] believe it
[1:16:58] that's where we become hypocrites
[1:17:01] we need to be able to believe it but we
[1:17:04] have to look at it that's the only way
[1:17:05] we can see whether we'll be able to
[1:17:07] believe it but when we do actually
[1:17:08] receive the message when we do actually
[1:17:10] believe the message then our position
[1:17:14] isn't by Christ it's not like Christ
[1:17:18] it's in Christ we become a new creature
[1:17:21] in Christ Jesus and how does that happen
[1:17:25] if we don't have Christ Jesus living out
[1:17:27] through us
[1:17:29] I so appreciated how we heard it on
[1:17:31] Wednesday night last week I feel like
[1:17:33] I'm doing it even a disservice you know
[1:17:35] the son of man Ministry is on the Earth
[1:17:38] right now and that son of man Ministry
[1:17:40] is Jesus Christ himself living out
[1:17:42] through men and women who believe this
[1:17:45] word for their day
[1:17:47] it's a uniting Time brothers and sisters
[1:17:51] and so I'm sure you can tell I'm going
[1:17:53] to get into 1963 the uniting time and
[1:17:56] sign
[1:17:57] brother Branham in paragraph 90 he says
[1:18:00] also
[1:18:01] while all this uniting of the nation
[1:18:05] these signs National signs we see out
[1:18:09] here in the world earthquakes and
[1:18:11] diverse places different things uniting
[1:18:14] bringing the world together bringing the
[1:18:16] people together all the churches
[1:18:19] together all these things
[1:18:21] and while all this uniting
[1:18:25] unitings going on there's another
[1:18:27] uniting that's going on Amen
[1:18:30] and that's what I want to point to you
[1:18:32] now
[1:18:33] in this message he gets right into it
[1:18:36] and uh we can't really do it justice
[1:18:38] tonight but it is a uniting time and and
[1:18:42] there's so many uniting signs going on I
[1:18:45] I just
[1:18:46] I was grieved and I know I've talked
[1:18:49] about it you know how the Abominations
[1:18:50] in the land There's the Man clothed in
[1:18:54] linen that's instructed to walk through
[1:18:56] the city with the acorn and put a mark
[1:18:59] on those set a mark on those who are
[1:19:01] sighing and crying for the Abominations
[1:19:03] in the land you know the uh just looking
[1:19:06] at the world today I
[1:19:08] I just couldn't help but have that
[1:19:11] burden to to to sigh and to cry within
[1:19:14] myself thinking look at how it is there
[1:19:17] there's so many different things I could
[1:19:20] list off things but there's no point but
[1:19:22] just to recognize really the uniting and
[1:19:26] and and and the signs of it all around
[1:19:28] us brothers and sisters
[1:19:30] but I can't help but think I just have
[1:19:33] this comparison you know I had talked
[1:19:34] about how the the light is compressing
[1:19:37] the darkness
[1:19:39] has anybody ever seen a fire piston
[1:19:42] you know what I'm talking about
[1:19:44] nobody
[1:19:46] I had just learned about it myself in uh
[1:19:49] it's a survival tool
[1:19:51] and it's a cylinder just a little thing
[1:19:53] it's about that big and it's usually
[1:19:55] made out of wood
[1:19:57] and what it is it's a it's a cylinder
[1:19:59] with a cap on the end of it and it's got
[1:20:01] a hole it's a tube and then there's
[1:20:03] another piece that is like a stick with
[1:20:06] an end on it and and it fits perfectly
[1:20:08] inside that cylinder and and what
[1:20:11] happens is you you take a little bit of
[1:20:13] a uh something like sawdust or something
[1:20:15] and you put it in there and you fit it
[1:20:17] inside there and it's really tight
[1:20:20] you can't really just slide it in there
[1:20:22] because it's airtight
[1:20:24] but if you go pop what happens is the
[1:20:27] air inside there squishes it compresses
[1:20:30] so tightly it will actually ignite that
[1:20:33] little piece of sawdust or whatever you
[1:20:36] put inside there the fire piston I just
[1:20:38] can't help but think that's what's going
[1:20:40] on now spiritually brothers and sisters
[1:20:42] there's so much pressure going on in
[1:20:44] this world and the light that we have
[1:20:46] inside of us the life of Jesus Christ
[1:20:48] Living out through us is just
[1:20:50] compressing all of this causing it to
[1:20:53] happen and it sounds crazy but you know
[1:20:55] just as crazy as what was the magnetic
[1:20:58] recording device created for
[1:21:01] the whole world and Hollywood would say
[1:21:03] that was created so that we could have
[1:21:05] Hollywood movies so that we could do
[1:21:07] Blockbuster films we could have all of
[1:21:10] the albums and everything recorded and
[1:21:12] artists and all this stuff but is that
[1:21:14] what it was created for or was that all
[1:21:16] of that a perversion of the purpose it
[1:21:19] was created for
[1:21:21] I know it's it's a bit crazy to say it
[1:21:23] but
[1:21:26] I am a little crazy
[1:21:28] uniting time and sign brother Branham
[1:21:30] says also well all this uniting of the
[1:21:32] nation these signs National signs we see
[1:21:34] out here in the world earthquakes and
[1:21:36] diverse places different things uniting
[1:21:39] bringing the world together bringing the
[1:21:40] people together all the churches
[1:21:42] together all these things and while all
[1:21:44] this uniting has been going on there's
[1:21:46] another uniting going on amen that's
[1:21:48] what I want to point out to you now God
[1:21:50] is uniting his bride
[1:21:54] I had looked at this and looked at this
[1:21:56] and looked at this but just tonight in
[1:21:57] the office before I came up here it just
[1:22:00] struck me like a brick you know what it
[1:22:03] is he's saying here I'm not interpreting
[1:22:05] what he's saying but I'm just reading it
[1:22:07] verbatim and I think it just clicked for
[1:22:09] me God is uniting his bride it's not
[1:22:12] that God is uniting with his bride even
[1:22:14] though he is uniting with his bride
[1:22:16] because remember in our scripture here
[1:22:18] love your enemies
[1:22:21] pray for those who despitefully use you
[1:22:23] God is uniting his bride she is coming
[1:22:27] together she's not dividing and
[1:22:30] separating she's coming together from
[1:22:33] East and the west and the North and the
[1:22:36] South there is a uniting time and that's
[1:22:39] what's on right now what is she uniting
[1:22:42] for the Rapture amen God's getting her
[1:22:45] ready
[1:22:46] what hit me brothers and sisters is that
[1:22:49] the bride is uniting together it's not
[1:22:51] so much that God is uniting with his
[1:22:54] bride how is God going to unite with his
[1:22:57] bride brothers and sisters there's this
[1:22:58] is the punch line the thing that I found
[1:23:00] so astounding so beautiful God is
[1:23:02] uniting through his to his bride through
[1:23:05] the uniting of his bride getting
[1:23:06] together
[1:23:08] when we say you know what it doesn't
[1:23:10] matter if you step on my toes because I
[1:23:12] know who you are you wouldn't try and
[1:23:14] hurt me you made a mistake and I forgive
[1:23:16] you and if you come and ask for
[1:23:18] forgiveness of course I'm going to give
[1:23:19] it to you quicker than than you would
[1:23:21] maybe believe I'm not gonna drag a ball
[1:23:24] and chain around about it but here we
[1:23:27] have brother Branham saying that God's
[1:23:29] getting her ready
[1:23:31] yes sir uniting
[1:23:34] and I love how he says this because he's
[1:23:36] not saying he's getting her together
[1:23:37] with persecution brother Bradham says
[1:23:40] extensively
[1:23:41] extensively in the message that if she's
[1:23:44] already been judged if we have judged
[1:23:46] ourselves then why would we go through
[1:23:48] the tribulation to be judged again
[1:23:51] we're not going to be judged in the
[1:23:53] tribulation
[1:23:55] people want to know whether it's
[1:23:56] pre-trib or post-trib or mid-trib you
[1:23:59] know what we had a prophet a Vindicated
[1:24:01] prophet of God said that we're pre-trib
[1:24:03] bride of Jesus Christ doesn't go through
[1:24:05] the the tribulation to be purified to be
[1:24:09] judged she's already judged herself
[1:24:11] according to his word that's the
[1:24:13] standard that she judges herself by by
[1:24:15] the word but you know it's a uniting
[1:24:18] time and that's on right now he says
[1:24:20] what is she uniting for the Rapture amen
[1:24:23] God's getting her ready yes sir uniting
[1:24:26] what is she uniting with
[1:24:29] with the word
[1:24:31] she's uniting with the word
[1:24:33] isn't that wonderful when we look at
[1:24:35] that that's our absolute all we need to
[1:24:37] do is Unite with the word that's what
[1:24:39] gives us the ability to go forwards in
[1:24:41] the Rapture that's what's going to save
[1:24:43] us
[1:24:44] that's what's going to bring us together
[1:24:45] is the word of God when we know that
[1:24:47] it's our absolute
[1:24:50] I think I was having a conversation with
[1:24:52] uh brother Joe's way on the weekend and
[1:24:54] you know imagine if everyone could just
[1:24:57] say well I've got my opinion
[1:24:58] I've got my opinion on what the prophet
[1:25:00] said I've got my opinion on what the
[1:25:02] prophet said I've got my opinion on what
[1:25:04] the prophet said and you know we have
[1:25:05] that in our our midst in the world today
[1:25:07] but you know how many different sects of
[1:25:10] the message do we get we get people who
[1:25:12] will you know just make it a uh so
[1:25:14] legalistic that you can't even say Amen
[1:25:16] in church to people who will go and
[1:25:18] starve to death all in the name of the
[1:25:20] message of the hour
[1:25:22] but then there's a group of people
[1:25:23] that's uniting together around the word
[1:25:25] of God saying that that's the absolute
[1:25:30] and I think it's beautiful because she's
[1:25:32] uniting together according to what the
[1:25:33] prophet said she's not dividing she's
[1:25:36] not separating she's uniting together so
[1:25:38] close that the world wouldn't know who
[1:25:40] her friend or her enemy is
[1:25:42] because she loves everyone
[1:25:48] and yeah she believes
[1:25:51] Matthew Chapter 5 and and how does she
[1:25:55] believe it it's one thing to say that I
[1:25:57] believe yes I believe but it's a totally
[1:26:00] different thing it's the next level
[1:26:01] brothers and sisters and we know this
[1:26:02] but I believe it has to be preached and
[1:26:05] that is to Simply live it
[1:26:08] just to Simply live it to say that you
[1:26:10] know
[1:26:12] if we just love them which love us what
[1:26:14] reward have we
[1:26:16] but Jesus said to him does doesn't the
[1:26:19] publicans have the same and if you
[1:26:21] salute your brethren only
[1:26:23] what do ye more than the others
[1:26:26] do not even the publicans so
[1:26:29] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:26:31] in Heaven
[1:26:32] is perfect
[1:26:34] and I just want to try and encourage us
[1:26:35] brothers and sisters the only way we're
[1:26:37] going to be perfect is to just take the
[1:26:38] word and apply it entirely in our lives
[1:26:41] according to the word for our day which
[1:26:43] is the message of the hour
[1:26:47] what's he uniting for the Rapture amen
[1:26:50] God's getting her ready yes sir uniting
[1:26:52] what is she uniting with with the word
[1:26:55] for all heavens and earth will pass away
[1:26:57] but my word shall never pass away she's
[1:27:00] uniting herself
[1:27:02] with thus saith the Lord
[1:27:05] this one just about put me off my chair
[1:27:08] the other day when I was I was reading
[1:27:10] this she's uniting herself with us saith
[1:27:13] the Lord
[1:27:14] regardless of what any denomination or
[1:27:17] anybody else says she's uniting herself
[1:27:21] and and you know it's wonderful because
[1:27:23] we can look at the message of the hour
[1:27:25] and we can try and explain it to people
[1:27:26] and encourage people and you know it's
[1:27:28] one of those things where you kind of
[1:27:30] either get it or you don't you kind of
[1:27:32] have the ability to receive it or you
[1:27:34] don't have the ability to receive it and
[1:27:36] we can't put people in and we certainly
[1:27:38] don't want to put people out but the
[1:27:41] people who really believe it they live
[1:27:42] it
[1:27:44] and that's I believe what brother
[1:27:46] Branham is saying here and I know that
[1:27:48] that's kind of Dangerous Waters just
[1:27:50] hear me out here I'm not trying to to to
[1:27:52] interpret what the prophet's saying but
[1:27:54] she's uniting herself with us saith the
[1:27:56] Lord what's thus saith the Lord in the
[1:27:58] day in which we live brothers and
[1:27:59] sisters there was only one man that I've
[1:28:01] ever heard about that would be saying
[1:28:03] thus saith the Lord in this Century in
[1:28:05] this generation and that was the prophet
[1:28:07] of God the the prophet for this age he's
[1:28:10] the only one that would dare say thus
[1:28:12] saith the Lord and watch it come to pass
[1:28:16] regardless of what any denomination or
[1:28:19] anybody else says she's uniting herself
[1:28:21] she is getting ready why she is the
[1:28:24] bride that's right
[1:28:26] remember that story I just can't help
[1:28:29] but think about it the the the woman who
[1:28:32] is the the the flunky of the cousins
[1:28:35] living out on the ranch and they were
[1:28:38] all looking for a husband and there was
[1:28:41] the the wealthy Sons the wealthy man
[1:28:44] businessman's son came out and and he
[1:28:47] saw all the women all of the cousins
[1:28:49] were mocking the the one sister maybe
[1:28:52] she was the runt of the bunch and and
[1:28:54] she never did anything with herself
[1:28:56] never tried to pretty herself up she
[1:28:58] just was
[1:29:00] pretty she just was beautiful but he
[1:29:03] came out and he was looking for a bride
[1:29:05] and he caught he she caught his eye and
[1:29:07] he went and talked to her and and asked
[1:29:09] her what is it about you something about
[1:29:11] you that's got my attention I just I
[1:29:13] just looking for a wife and every one of
[1:29:15] these out here they just don't do it
[1:29:17] there's nothing in them that attracts me
[1:29:19] they're trying too hard they're not just
[1:29:21] who they say they are I can tell they're
[1:29:23] fake
[1:29:24] but that one caught his attention
[1:29:27] and and what did he tell her I'll come
[1:29:30] back for you I'll be back and I'm coming
[1:29:33] back for you
[1:29:34] and she told all of their cousins and
[1:29:36] all of the girls there all those ones
[1:29:38] who were busy living their Works gospel
[1:29:41] and what what did they say oh not for
[1:29:44] you
[1:29:45] not for you you're a scrub look at you
[1:29:47] look at the things you've done in your
[1:29:48] life you never accounted to nothing in
[1:29:50] your life you think that he's coming
[1:29:52] back for you but she knew in her heart
[1:29:54] and that's all that counted right she
[1:29:56] was the one she just kept going she just
[1:29:58] kept singing she just kept doing the
[1:30:00] work knowing that she truly would be
[1:30:04] going with him
[1:30:06] but the Branham says she's uniting
[1:30:08] herself she's getting ready why she's
[1:30:10] the bride that's right and she's uniting
[1:30:12] herself with her bridegroom
[1:30:14] I thought he said she's uniting herself
[1:30:16] with the word I thought he said she's
[1:30:18] uniting herself with us saith the Lord
[1:30:21] now he says he's uniting him herself
[1:30:23] with the bridegroom
[1:30:25] I think it's a beautiful thing because
[1:30:26] if you take all those and you put them
[1:30:28] together what is it it's Jesus Christ
[1:30:30] because who is going to say thus saith
[1:30:33] the Lord on Earth
[1:30:34] there's only one that could ever do that
[1:30:39] she's uniting herself she's getting
[1:30:41] ready why she's the bride that's right
[1:30:43] she's uniting herself with her
[1:30:44] bridegroom see the bridegroom is the
[1:30:48] word in the beginning was the word the
[1:30:50] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:30:51] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:30:53] Among Us
[1:30:55] that's why I just think it's such a
[1:30:57] dangerous thing to do anything else with
[1:30:59] Jesus Christ to say that he's a brother
[1:31:03] a third person or a second person any
[1:31:05] person he's God
[1:31:08] he's God
[1:31:10] just to continue on with this quote here
[1:31:13] the uniting time and sign paragraph 92
[1:31:17] and the church and the bride and the
[1:31:20] word is becoming one
[1:31:24] I and my father are one
[1:31:28] that's that's my summary of that I'm
[1:31:30] putting that in there I and my father
[1:31:32] are one but here we have brother Brad
[1:31:33] I'm saying it in a different way and the
[1:31:35] church and the bride and the word is
[1:31:37] becoming so one until the very word
[1:31:41] itself is working out the works of the
[1:31:45] bridegroom amen
[1:31:47] you see it a uniting
[1:31:51] I love how he says this it's just so
[1:31:53] clear no more join the church
[1:31:56] not more of this but flee from
[1:31:59] everything and tied to Jesus Christ see
[1:32:02] it's the uniting time God uniting his
[1:32:06] bride together bringing it back just
[1:32:09] exactly uniting the words of his promise
[1:32:14] just like that one that rich
[1:32:16] businessman's son uniting the words of
[1:32:18] his promise brother Bradham says second
[1:32:20] Thessalonians second chapter it says the
[1:32:22] fifth chapter says the saints that are
[1:32:24] asleep and the dust of the earth will
[1:32:26] awaken then will Unite with them the
[1:32:28] living ones the ones that's been dead
[1:32:30] will unite before we can even get up
[1:32:32] there because the bride will be complete
[1:32:35] when she gets there
[1:32:37] isn't that beautiful we're not going
[1:32:40] there to get complete brothers and
[1:32:41] sisters it's happening now that's why we
[1:32:43] Fellowship this way that's why we come
[1:32:45] to church on Wednesday nights when we're
[1:32:46] tired in our busy lives that's why we
[1:32:49] bring our kids to church that's why we
[1:32:51] tell them this is what we believe now
[1:32:53] you have to have your own experience too
[1:32:55] son and daughter you have to go forwards
[1:32:58] you can't just accept what I have in my
[1:33:00] life it's not going to be enough for you
[1:33:03] father Bradham says the ones that's
[1:33:05] living that's uniting themselves with
[1:33:07] the word and those that are gone already
[1:33:09] did that and it all comes together make
[1:33:12] one great Union of the uniting before
[1:33:15] going up there amen I just think it's
[1:33:18] such a wonderful thought we have the
[1:33:20] ability brothers and sisters to just put
[1:33:23] it all away put aside all of the
[1:33:25] problems in our lives and recognize the
[1:33:27] uniting time is going on to think about
[1:33:30] how this world all of the the
[1:33:33] Blasphemous things that are going on and
[1:33:35] and and how people might even mock this
[1:33:37] message of the hour but but to see how
[1:33:40] this other
[1:33:42] terrible stuff is going on and seemingly
[1:33:45] succeeding and it will it will continue
[1:33:47] to grow darker and darker as we go
[1:33:51] but that's not going to stop us
[1:33:53] we're not going to get darker and darker
[1:33:55] don't let it get you darker and darker
[1:33:56] if you've got Christ Living in you
[1:33:58] you're going to get brighter and
[1:33:59] brighter it's going to be the law of the
[1:34:00] contrast and you're not going to have to
[1:34:02] say anything and I'm sure that every one
[1:34:04] of us gives us experience it already you
[1:34:05] go into a a place maybe a waiting room
[1:34:08] and a in a restaurant and people are
[1:34:10] jostling and swearing and you step in
[1:34:13] quietly and you don't even say a word
[1:34:15] and and they suddenly they see you and
[1:34:17] and they all look at each other and they
[1:34:19] get white in the face and they say oh
[1:34:21] sorry and and you say nothing I never
[1:34:24] said anything why would you say sorry
[1:34:26] but it's the presence it's the spirits
[1:34:29] that are in those people they're
[1:34:30] recognizing the spirit that is inside of
[1:34:33] us when we walk into the room of people
[1:34:35] like that
[1:34:42] Brother Brad I'm out of another message
[1:34:43] he says now with the penny now what the
[1:34:45] what the church the Pentecostal church
[1:34:47] needs tonight along with the other
[1:34:48] churches is a good old-fashioned
[1:34:51] baptizing of the Holy Ghost and love
[1:34:53] that will make you straighten up and get
[1:34:55] together and come together like brothers
[1:34:57] and sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:35:00] break down these walls of partition amen
[1:35:03] where there's love God is love
[1:35:06] love suffers long love is not provoked
[1:35:10] love is not puffed up
[1:35:13] when you get puffed up Love's gone
[1:35:17] when we say to our wives you need to get
[1:35:19] in your position I'm the husband you
[1:35:22] need to submit yourself unto me Love's
[1:35:24] gone
[1:35:25] and we know that's God and thankfully
[1:35:28] brother Branham said you know he's just
[1:35:30] like a dove and he's just gonna fly away
[1:35:32] and he'll just sit in that tree and wait
[1:35:33] till that wolf nature gets out of us
[1:35:36] until we let some air out of our tires
[1:35:38] and we come back down to our normal size
[1:35:40] and then he'll come back but he brother
[1:35:43] Bradham here he says where there is love
[1:35:45] God is love love suffers long love is
[1:35:48] not provoked love is not puffed up when
[1:35:51] you get puffed up Love's gone and where
[1:35:54] there's all this malice and strife and
[1:35:56] wars and envy and Malice against one
[1:35:59] another brother
[1:36:00] God just moves out that's all and it's a
[1:36:03] fact you can see it amen that's out of
[1:36:07] the Seal of the Antichrist 1955.
[1:36:11] so tonight brothers and sisters I just
[1:36:13] want to encourage every one of us to
[1:36:14] just go on to perfection in Christ not
[1:36:17] worry about trying to live in a in a
[1:36:21] gospel where it's a bunch of works that
[1:36:23] we do but but read the book of Hebrews
[1:36:26] as we've read Hebrews chapter 6. let's
[1:36:30] move on to Perfection we we don't need
[1:36:32] to worry about all of the the mechanics
[1:36:35] we've got the mechanics we've had the
[1:36:37] Mechanics for decades even even hundreds
[1:36:40] of years I would say but you know what
[1:36:44] we haven't had the Dynamics like we've
[1:36:46] got them
[1:36:47] the Dynamics is a relatively new thing
[1:36:49] the Dynamics is the thing that came
[1:36:51] around here in the last few decades like
[1:36:54] the last 60 years the dynamic power of
[1:36:57] the Holy Ghost is what's going to take
[1:36:59] us into perfection
[1:37:01] so I'm just going to close with this one
[1:37:03] quote and I'll call the musicians now
[1:37:04] but we read it at the beginning and
[1:37:07] talking about this perfection
[1:37:10] brother Branham says and so is every man
[1:37:12] and woman that's born of the spirit of
[1:37:14] God it isn't you become changed there's
[1:37:17] something about you that something has
[1:37:20] moved in
[1:37:21] made you a different person
[1:37:26] I just want to say this tonight maybe
[1:37:28] stand with me as we
[1:37:30] begin to close here
[1:37:32] brothers and sisters if we have not
[1:37:35] become a different person in Christ
[1:37:36] Jesus
[1:37:38] but we agree with this word
[1:37:42] or maybe
[1:37:44] we have at one time in our life become a
[1:37:47] new person in Christ Jesus
[1:37:52] well we're not sure where that person is
[1:37:56] or maybe we know that we're a new person
[1:37:59] in Christ Jesus
[1:38:01] but sometimes in our life we just don't
[1:38:03] feel like it
[1:38:06] it's not too late
[1:38:07] he's still calling
[1:38:10] all we need to do is raise our hands
[1:38:12] unto him and say Lord be it unto me
[1:38:14] according to Thy Word
[1:38:16] just take the bitterness the Wrath the
[1:38:19] malice out of me
[1:38:21] if I've gotten puffed up let me pull
[1:38:23] that cork and just let that hot air out
[1:38:25] and let me come back to myself let me
[1:38:28] get beside myself and just Lord here's
[1:38:31] my cup just just fill it up Lord Jesus
[1:38:33] and I guarantee you brothers and sisters
[1:38:36] if we can have that genuine
[1:38:38] testimony he will fill it up
[1:38:45] he said something has moved in made you
[1:38:46] a different person
[1:38:48] you look on life different
[1:38:50] you look at things different
[1:38:53] it isn't you that's bubbling it's
[1:38:55] something within you pushing it out
[1:38:58] it's Christ
[1:38:59] pushing out the testimony and the life
[1:39:04] and it all comes back to Christ
[1:39:07] and I just want to throw this in
[1:39:10] if there's something in you tonight
[1:39:11] brothers and sisters that's crying out
[1:39:15] that any of this is true
[1:39:18] that's the Holy Ghost speaking to you
[1:39:20] tonight
[1:39:21] that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:39:24] today and forever that is God in heaven
[1:39:28] sending a revelation to your heart to
[1:39:32] say Amen to the word and I would just
[1:39:34] say you know we have every single reason
[1:39:37] to rejoice
[1:39:38] we have every right to Rejoice we don't
[1:39:42] need to remain silent knowing what he's
[1:39:44] done for us if he has made us a new
[1:39:47] creature
[1:39:49] he says the law having a shadow of
[1:39:51] things to come could not make the comer
[1:39:53] perfect
[1:39:55] what's the subject Paul speaking of here
[1:39:57] Perfection God requires Perfection no
[1:40:01] one could ever come to Heaven outside of
[1:40:03] being perfect now just set Stella minute
[1:40:05] look perfect you must be perfect and yet
[1:40:08] the scripture says not as perfect so if
[1:40:09] you must be perfect and come to heaven
[1:40:11] then and the scripture says None is
[1:40:13] perfect and we've all sinned and come
[1:40:15] short of the glory of God how are we
[1:40:16] ever going to enter God's living place
[1:40:18] and Dwelling Place when he requires
[1:40:21] Perfection Jesus said I Believe In The
[1:40:24] Sermon on the Mount he said be therefore
[1:40:25] perfect
[1:40:27] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:40:30] think of the Perfection that God
[1:40:32] requires of the person a perfection
[1:40:35] I want to say tonight brothers and
[1:40:37] sisters if he said be ye therefore
[1:40:39] perfect even as my Father in Heaven is
[1:40:43] perfect
[1:40:44] you can be perfect
[1:40:47] and you know why
[1:40:48] because the bride is uniting herself
[1:40:50] with thus saith the Lord for her day
[1:40:53] and thus saith the Lord for her day
[1:40:55] wasn't a man that said you're perfect
[1:40:57] you never even did it in the first place
[1:41:00] that was God himself saying that through
[1:41:03] the prophet and he was saying it to his
[1:41:05] bride to the elect lady so brothers and
[1:41:08] sisters that's the only Perfection we're
[1:41:09] ever going to see in this world
[1:41:11] everything else is imperfect everything
[1:41:14] only Christ Jesus living out through us
[1:41:16] is perfect
[1:41:18] let's just bow in prayer tonight
[1:41:20] gracious Heavenly Father Lord I Thank
[1:41:22] you for your word I thank you for the
[1:41:24] freshness of it Lord how you just Lord
[1:41:27] you bring it in such a way that father
[1:41:30] sometimes we need it
[1:41:32] thank you for showing me things Lord for
[1:41:35] continually Lord leading me and guiding
[1:41:37] me giving me the ability father to have
[1:41:40] something father to feed your sheep Lord
[1:41:43] there's no way that I could ever do it
[1:41:45] and I thank you Father for doing it Lord
[1:41:48] you are so wonderful father Lord Jesus
[1:41:51] we thank you for this direction that
[1:41:53] you've taken us tonight Lord to tell us
[1:41:55] that we can forgive those who who
[1:41:58] despitefully use us Lord that that we
[1:42:00] can forgive our enemies we can love them
[1:42:02] Father Lord Jesus but then Lord by doing
[1:42:06] all of that that makes us perfect
[1:42:08] because the only way we'll ever do that
[1:42:10] is to have your life living out through
[1:42:12] us and the only way we're ever going to
[1:42:14] have your life living out through us is
[1:42:15] if we humble ourselves in the sight of
[1:42:17] the Lord so that you can lift us up
[1:42:19] father Lord if we can align with your
[1:42:22] word then you will manifest your word in
[1:42:25] our lives
[1:42:26] father I just want to pray tonight for
[1:42:29] each one father if there's a desire in
[1:42:31] the hearts of your children for more of
[1:42:33] you that's because there's more of you
[1:42:35] to be had Lord and we're so thankful
[1:42:37] that even in this dark hour in this late
[1:42:39] day in in this Midnight Hour father that
[1:42:42] there is still a cry in the heart of
[1:42:44] your children father for you Lord Jesus
[1:42:47] we just lift our cups unto you tonight
[1:42:49] and we ask father that you would just
[1:42:51] fill it up one more time that you would
[1:42:53] just top us up father that we would have
[1:42:55] enough oil in our Labs father should you
[1:42:58] call us between now and the next time
[1:43:00] we'll get together in your name that
[1:43:02] we'd be ready to go father that we could
[1:43:04] just trim our lamps Lord and just get
[1:43:06] rid of all that carbon and just be ready
[1:43:08] to go in to the marriage supper of the
[1:43:11] Lamb
[1:43:12] father we love you and we thank you we
[1:43:14] pray that you would just go with us now
[1:43:16] as we go our separate ways father
[1:43:17] whether we just sign off on the computer
[1:43:19] or whether we just drive home father we
[1:43:22] we know that you're not bound by time or
[1:43:24] space and I pray that you would just
[1:43:25] father go with each one of your children
[1:43:27] as we go our separate ways tonight and
[1:43:30] if it Be Your Will for us to gather
[1:43:31] again on Sunday father we certainly will
[1:43:33] and will be thankful to do it we just
[1:43:36] ask all these things now in Jesus
[1:43:38] Christ's name we pray
[1:43:40] amen
