Description:
How do you explain?
How do you describe?
A Love that flows from East to West
And runs as deep as it is wide
You know all our hopes
You know all our fears
And words could not express 
The Love we feel
But we long for You to hear

CHORUS
Listen to our hearts 
Hear our spirit sing
A song of praise that flows
From those You have redeemed
We will use the words we know
To tell You what an awesome God You are
But words are not enough 
To tell You of our Love
So listen to our hearts

If words could fall like rain
From these lips of mine
And If I had a thousand years
I would still run out of time
So if You listen to our hearts
Every beat will say
Thank You for the life
Thank You for the truth 
Thank You for the way
