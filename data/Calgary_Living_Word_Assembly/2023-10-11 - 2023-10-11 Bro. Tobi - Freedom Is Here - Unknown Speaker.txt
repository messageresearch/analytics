quickly before you take your seat Paul has given me an extra 10 minutes there about so thank you make the best use of it let's go to Exodus chapter 12 you love the Lord tonight amen just going to take two portions of scripture I'll read the first one and then you might take your seats okay sorry is it better now okay thank you all right Exodus chapter 12 30-36 yeah I'm happy to that I'm going to read from verse 30 to 36 Exodus chapter 12 and Pharaoh rose up in the night he and all the servants and all the Egyptians and there was a great cry in Egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead we know this was the story of God bringing Deliverance to the people of Israel verse 31 and he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said rise up up and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of Israel and go serve the Lord as ye have said also take your flocks and your herds as ye have said and beg gone and bless me also the Egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste for they said we be all dead men and the people took their door before it was leavened their needing troughs being bound up in their clothes and upon their shoulders and the children of Israel did according to the word of the Lord and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and rainment and the lord gave the people favor in the side of the Egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as they required and they spoiled the Egyptians you may have your seat I'll turn quickly to Leviticus chapter 25 five I'll just take four verses there will be verse 10 to verse 13 Leviticus 25 and ye shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you ye shall return every man unto his family a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto you ye shall not sold neither reap that which growth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of the vine undressed for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat in the increase thereof out of the field 13 says in the year of this Jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession amen the Lord bless the reading of his word tonight in Jesus Christ's name for a title tonight I want to bring a declaration to you that freedom is here so that's my title tonight freedom is here we know this is the story of the children of Israel but way before this time God had made a covenant to Abraham the father of the Jews and many other nations the father of many Nation Nations and when God made this Covenant to Abraham God told him that his people were going to sourn in a Strange Land for 400 years and he said after 400 years he was going to bring them out and the lord gave enough detail to make Abraham know that the people that will oppress God's people the Seed of Abraham God was going to punish them and brother br will say to us in the message at Kadesh B here he said now this Covenant People Israel down in Egypt on account of Disobedience and of selling their brother Joseph and was taken down into Egypt and there was 400 years under bondage he said I want you to notice they never lost their Covenant amen they lost their freedom not their Covenant Hallelujah I'll just PA a little bit and speak to you for a moment here brothers and sisters that regardless of what is happening in your life remember you have not lost the Covenant amen you might have lost your freedom but you've not lost your Covenant you might have lost the joy of your salvation David once said Lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation but it could only say that because he realized that he had a covenant and he had not lost that Covenant amen amen Jesus Christ said all that the father has given unto me he said they shall come unto me and he that cometh I will in no wise cast out he said no man can pluck them out of my hands he said because the father that gave them to me he is greater than all amen have you lost your Victory remember you have not lost the Covenant you know the almighty God decided to show John a revelation of Jesus Christ himself really grateful that our pastor is taken that teaching sorry to interrupt it tonight but I believe that's how the Lord ordained it amen that's right but he said in Revelation 12 he said and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our brethren and is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him not will overcome him but they already overcame him by what by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony you are already an overcomer amen said they love not their lives even unto death she've lost your health remember you've not lost the Covenant he said I am the Lord your God that health all your diseases amen he also told you that he was wounded for your transgression he was bruised for your iniquity the chastisement of your peace was upon him and by his tribes you were healed brother brah told of a story of someone who was sick and a little boy was admonishing him like when you read the scripture just read it the way my mother used to read it put your name in there why because you are part of that coven now let me tell you something about this Covenant number one it is unconditional amen what does that mean it has nothing to do with what you did what you could do or what you will ever do it has nothing to do with you this Covenant is a sworn Covenant the Bible said that because God could swear by no no greater God looked around he wanted to confirm this Covenant unto Abraham he wanted to seal that Covenant he wanted to make that Covenant be a type of Covenant that cannot be broken he wanted to take it a step higher from the level of a promise to an oath and because there was no other person that God could swear by God swore by himself self so you've got a swan Covenant that is signed by God himself this Covenant was before the foundation of the world he said the lamb was slain before the world began and as we heard that brother Paul preached the other time this Covenant is a covenant by Blood it was a covenant by Blood something had to die in this case God himself had to die that's right so we're saying the people of Israel they might have lost their freedom but they never lost their Covenant Abraham went ahead to say when God made the Covenant with Abraham Isaac and Jacob that he swore by himself that he will save Abraham and he seed after him God is Duty bound to keep that promise and as his just Duty bound to you and sorry and he is just as Duty bound to you on that promise as it was to Abraham on the promise that's right if you are Abraham's seed how many of us are Abraham seed tonight if you are Abraham's seed says the Bible and hears according to the promise then God is just as Duty bound to you as he what to Abraham amen said that will take all the scare out of it God don't want you to be scared of nothing he doesn't want you to be scared of nothing what does he want you to do he wants you to rest solemnly upon what he said because God cannot fail so it took 500 years from the time that God made that promise to Abraham until the time that Moses was born 500 years God didn't even do anything about it was just laying there oh my goodness God is said I am the Lord that watched over my word to perform it sometimes there might be a huge gap in between s but God is watching is acting it looks like he's not doing anything but God is doing something don't look at what you see know that when God makes a promise God is able to fulfill it you believe that tonight say Amen so Moses was called by God at the age of 80 and it was at the time that he had run away from God it was a time that it was aware of his calling but he tried to do it by himself and he failed miserably but God knew that the time was not yet and God also knew that he wanted to work on that man to take the man to a place where the man becomes dependent on God himself and not him and not not himself as a man we never heard about Moses's flaws the first 80 years of his life we heard he was a prince where he was so bold he understood what he was supposed to be a deliverer and he was bold enough to kill an Egyptians for the sake of an Israelite but by the time God started to deal with him by the time God appeared to him when he was 80 years and God gave him the commission to go deliver the children of of Israel we started to see Moses had gone to a stage where he had already become broken and he said Lord I'm just a stammer I'm not even and and we know that Moses was educated Moses had the best that was available at that time because it was a prince of the most powerful nation in the world and God told him go tell Pharaoh my people have got to be freed and Moses was wondering because Moses also knew that when he goes to the children of Israel number one maybe most of the people that knew him would have died because he was an 80y old man maybe many of them would not remember him anymore there's so many people and it was not even that popular no one really wanted him when he was in Egypt so Moses also then asked God because wherever deity is there has to be the supernatural he said the people are not going to believe me and then God said I'll give you two signs I'll give you a supernatural sign two Supernatural signs that will confirm to the people that I am the one that sent you so let's imagine Moses traveled finally God told him you will be God unto un unto pharaoh and Aaron will be your prophet and then Moses traveled and then he got there now the people were a bad State you know none of us has an experience of knowing what it means to be a slave a slave is owned by the master is it's it's worse than you owning your pets because many times you give your pets you know good treatments you allow your pets to to to have food when they are supposed to have food you take them to the doctor for for for for to the veterinary doctor for treatment you take good care of them slaves were not taking care of like that the slaves had no will of themselves the slaves they they they didn't they couldn't wake up in the morning and say this is what my day was going to be like because they had to do what the master willed and we know that that is in the natural but today in the spiritual there are also slaves I think about people who are addicted to certain habits like smoking is getting into winter now it's going to get cold whilst you're in inside the house inside your office trying to keep warm you're going to see that smoker man or smoker lady come out in the cold to smoke why they're under a bondage they are slaves to that demon and regardless of how much they tell that demon no it's it's cold I can't go outside the Demon's going to tell them it's not your will you have to do my will so the people of Israel were in that state and I could imagine more Moses arriving there and telling them you know what I have a commission from God remember Moses said to them sorry Moses said to God that if they don't believe me what will happen so imagine that the manifestation of the supernatural was first done to the children of Israel to convince them that God had sent Moses and the word on the streets will have been freedom is here hallelujah but we know it was going to take a lot it was going to take 10 different plagues before Pharaoh we finally get to that point of saying okay I'm done with you guys you can go but where we first read in Exodus was the night where that freedom was about to be declared brother Brown will give us an illustration he did that in the few messages where it will say that the first born will come to the father because this meant a lot to them remember that a death angel was going to go through the land and kill all the first bores whether it be of humans or of animals and the first one will go to the dad and say Daddy I just heard them crying in the other house they're Egyptians the firstborn has just died they lost the firstborn of their pets as well Daddy what about me you know I'm your firstborn and the father will say don't worry son I have applied the blood I have done what I am meant to do Jehovah made us a promise that if we will apply the blood then the that angel is going to pass over us and finally that happened all the Egyptians and those that failed to apply the blood they lost their first bones in their houses whether I be animals or I was humans and then Pharaoh said now you can go and that was a declaration of Freedom now we read in Leviticus 25 as well the Lord J the Lord God told them he said that they should count seven Sabbath years so Sabbath is seven um the Sabbath is seven days normally like the land of Israel they will have what they call the Shabbat which is the seventh day but God was telling them given that law to Moses that they should have seven Sabbath years so 7 * 7 is 49 there you go nice to have the young little ones right in front here they can answer our questions for us brother the Paul put them to work got them to read the Bible it was Elias you did a good job Elias God bless you say it's 49 years and on the 50th year there was supposed to be a declaration of Jubilee now in the land of Israel this is way after they had gone into the promised land they also had slaves so what could happen a situation could arise where someone will borrow something from a family will borrow from another family and then they are not able to pay back and because they cannot pay back they have to give their daughter or their son to be a slave to this other family but God made a provision and we can go into the details of why God did that because if you look at this as well this had to also do with the inheritance God wanting to keep the inheritance God gave all the tribes their inheritance and God wanted to keep that inheritance God wanted to keep the people with the way they were but this was also god making them understand that a time of Freedom was supposed to come for everyone that was being enslaved now God told him every man that is a slave from the land of Israel on that 50th year you have to proclaim a jubilee and then there has to be a trumpet that has to sound and regardless of what that slave was doing at that time it might have been on the plantation of the master with the hole and farming and doing all of that as soon as he hears the trumpet the Jubilee trumpet he has the right to drop it and say I am now a free man amenallah and we see in the book of jorges as well most of the time the people will sin against God God will deliver them over to their enemies but God always brought a freedom now what am I saying tonight there is also a situation that God gave in in the book of Deuteronomy we a master could obey the instruction that God gave at the sound of the trumpet the Jubilee trumpet and then the slave could say I have had so much fun with my master I Don't Want to Be Free Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 1516 to17 said and it shall be if he shall say unto thee I will not go away from thee because he loveth thee and thine house because he is well with thee then shall thou take an all and thrust it through his ha onto the door and it shall be thy servant forever and also unto thy mid Heaven Thou shalt do likewise why because God knows that a pardon is not a pardon until it is accepted as a pardon but the Braham was the one that said this to us but Braham told a story that he read and you can see several times you know brother Braham narrated that story in different ways and and because it was something that he read he would have you know at that moment brought out as much as he retained in his memory but brother Braham the one I want to talk about was brother Braham actually explained that this story was about um was he read it in in the book that had to do with the life of Abraham Lincoln so he said there was a man who was in the Army and at that time if you're enlisted said into the army as long as you you know voluntarily said you're going to do it you're not allowed to run away you're not allowed to flee so this man was in the Army the went to war started to hear you know the sound of the ammunation and the GS and all of that and then he fled and the penalty for that was that he was supposed to die by the firing Court he was supposed to be killed and then his friend knowing that this man had been arrested had been tried and was going to be killed found an audience with Abraham Lincoln and said Abraham Lincoln I know you are a Christian Mr President this boy is a good boy he didn't mean to do it he was just afraid when he started to hear all the noise the the the the the the the sound of of of the guns and and and the bombs and all of that and he and he ran away please just just have mercy upon him at the least let him be in prison but don't let him be killed K and Abraham Lincoln being being a Christian he felt pity for the man but Abraham Lincoln was just in his courage about to go into a hotel so he did not have his his presidential um letter head and and and the seal and all of those things so he just took a simple piece of paper simple piece of paper and wrote this man is pardoned and signed Abraham Lincoln and this man's friend was so excited and he got this piece of paper and he ran to the prison and went to his friend and said hey I've got the pardon from the president you can now go free and his friend looked at the package his friend looked at the piece of paper his friend failed to look at the signature of the president he looked at the packet that was carrying his pardon and because it did not look like what he expected he said you're just here to mock me go away and his friend pleaded with him this is real this is a orinal this is from the president look at the signature and he kept saying no you're here to mock me go away I know I'm going to be killed by the next morning and by the next morning he was killed at the firing court so the case came to the Supreme Court and the questions were asked will the president give the pardon yes did the president sign the pardon yes so why was the man killed and they said the pardon is not a pardon until it is accepted as a pardon brother Braham told us about a dream that he had he said he doesn't dream that often was a prophet he saw many Vision hundreds of thousands of them but not so much of a dreamer but in this dream I remember a pastor was referring to this recently he said um I'll just kind of read it quickly how we doing with time very good he said he had a dream the other morning he said I don't dream very often but I'm not a dreamer but I dream I sent a man a young fellow in shackles and he was trying to get out somebody told me those are horrible people don't have nothing to do with them and I see this young fellow getting out of his shackles so I just let him alone I thought I just see what he does so when he got out he was a nice fellow and I seen the others trying to get out now this is only a dream and I walked over this way and I seen a brother Roy borders a very good friend of mine lives in California look like there's something wrong his eyes was half closed maybe cancer or something over his eyes and someone was trying to pull me away from him I screamed brother borders in the name of Jesus snap out of that and he just be will speak saying brother Braham it'll have to take something more than this I just can't grasp it brother Braham I just can't grasp it I said brother borders oh I love him and someone pulled me away I looked and it was a lady standing over here that when I was a little boy I used to haul Gres groceries from the grocery store to to the people and the name was Mrs Fenton she lived in Jeffersonville yet a personal friend to the wife and I and she said brother Bram the Del us from this said this is a house of hell and said you've been misunderstood I said you misunderstood these people remember somebody told brah this this this this horrible people don't have nothing to do with them and so this is this woman who was telling brother Braham you have been misunderstood brother Braham and then you have also misunderstood those people these are fine people he said I looked over there a BRI a great big sell or big walls down beneath a great big cave and great iron bars eight or 10 inches thick and people out of their mind Twisted arms and legs beating their head like that and she was crying saying deliver the people brother Braham help us we're in trouble she herself I know brother brah said she belonged to the Church of Christ um the Christian church called The Church of the Brethren said I looked around and I said I wish I could and go on looking around my little be body them great big iron bars and those poor people in there and you couldn't get to them them iron bars were sitting close together and I looked and they were beating their head like they were out of their mind and I seen some lights flickering around in there and I looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus with the light of rainbow around him he was looking right straight to me he said deliver those people and it went away and I thought well how can I deliver them I haven't G got strength enough in my arms to break those BS so I said House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ said and all the creaking and popping and rocks rolling and the bars falling and people running screaming delivered and screamed at the top of their voice and was all delivered now brother God gave him the ability to deliver the people that were held out but remember he told us he had a friend the B said and I was screaming then brother borders brother Roy borders where are you where are you God is delivering his people where are you brother borders said I've wondered about that we are in a time that God is delivering his people amen we're in a time where we know that things are wrapping up I know a lot of us probably will be following what is happening in Israel and and in the Gaza street but but that has been unpre unprecedented over the past you know 40 50 years that the the amount of Israelis that have been killed by the Palestinians that has never happened in since 1970s I'm not here to tell you what it means I'm not speculating but we know that this a part of the promises and if Israel is getting to the point where there is a squeeze going on to bring them to the realization that they need the mesiah then you know that God is wrapping up his Gentile bride as well so we're in a time where God is delivering his people young people we're in a time where God is setting young people free we all grew up as young people is when you were young that the devil actually tries to focus a lot on you because he knows the Bible said Remember the Lord your God in the days of of your youth before the evil days come so he tries to get you at that time tries to get you with a spirit of stubbornness he tries to get you with a spirit of self-righteousness he tries to put some habits in your life he tries to put you in a place where you find it difficult to live a true Christian life but this is a time of Freedom so brother Braham remembered his friend now Freedom when we talk about about freedom in terms of Salvation is freedom from sin we all born in sin we're all shaped in iniquity we come to the world speaking lies there Comes A Time as you continue to hear the word of God there's something in you tells you that I need to give my life to Christ the moment you give your life to Christ you are taking a step to move away from bondage into Freedom that's why brother Brown will explain to us that you know when when he had his own experience of giving his life to Christ he he felt a joy of Salvation it was a joy of Salvation there was something my dad always told us the story that um of of when he gave his life to Christ when he was in high school and um his friend had invited him to come listen to an Apostolic Faith um um concert where they were going to sing my dad will always tell us like when he's telling the story said I was a boy as a boy so it was just a sinner boy but his friend told him you know come with me to this Apostolic Faith concert you know it's music it's Christmas time it's going to be music just come listen and my dad said well if you will give me you buy me the banana to eat with my rice during lunch then I'll come with you so we did that because of food but that was his day of salvation and he said he went to the concert and of course it did the music but there were there was someone that came a minister came to to speak to them just just give a word of exaltation and this Minister just literally just told his own life story of how he came to Christ and my dad said as he was sitting in the audience listening to this man he said this man was was telling him exactly what is going on in his life the man was narrating my dad's own life when he was describing his own life and there was an altar call and he said as he approached the altar he felt as if he saw a cross before him and then he felt as if there was a burden that he was carrying like a backpack that just got cut away and rolled away and he said when after the service he saw his friend he was still a few feet away he jumped into the arms of his friend why he had a feeling of Freedom my sins are gone we sing that song you ask me why I'm happy so I just tell you why because my sins are gone it's a freedom you realize you're no more a slave to sin so the first time I actually had this message put together and and and before I preached it I already preached this for um last year some um in in mober I was actually wondering like just coming closer to our own time so the africanamerican slaves when the Proclamation was going to be given how were they feeling these are people that have been taken away from where they had called home for years and brought into a place um where where they they were they were made slaves and they had no Freedom they didn't know what Freedom was some of them were born as slaves but then President Abraham Lincoln was going to give a declaration that they were going to be free by the next morning so I did a bit of research and I'll read a few things to you so one of the writers said when Lincoln did signed the proclamation on January 1 1863 freeing slaves across the Confederate territ widespread Joy developed through the africanamerican community as Frederick Douglas described it the scene was wild and Grand joy and gladness exhausted all forms of expression from shouts of praise to Joys and tears said then in 1876 reflecting back on the momentous moments he said can any colored man or for any white man friendly to the freedom of all men ever forget the night which followed the first day of January 1863 when the world was to see if Abraham Lincoln will prove to be as good as he word as his word said I shall never forget that memorable night when in a distant City I waited and watched at a public meeting with 3,000 others not less anxious than myself for the Word of Deliverance amen which we have heard read today nor shall I ever forget the Outburst of joy and Thanksgiving that rent the Earth when the lightning brought to us the Emancipation Proclamation in that happy hour we forgot all the lay and forgot all tidiness forgot that the president had bribed the rebel to lay down their arms by a promise to withold the bolt which will Smite the slavery system with destruction and we were then forth willing to allow the president of all the latitude of time phology and every honorable device that statesmanship might require for the achievement of a great and beneficient measure of Liberty and progress so these people were in a where regardless of what they had gone through regardless of all the politics that might happen that might have delayed this Proclamation amen they knew that it was just one more night and they were going to be free someone else talked about how this brought mixed emotions because the question is the freedom has been offered the freedom has been given but what does freedom mean to to you what does he mean to you Christ has died he has given you Freedom he said now you can go free but what does it mean to you they said interviews with historians hired during the Depression to record the experiences of former slaves show the Garment of emotions they felt after surrender someone said I can remember the Negroes were so happy recalled amenti who had been enslaved in Mississippi they just rang Bells blowed horns and shouted like they were crazy then they brought a brand new rope and cut it up into little pieces and gave everyone a little piece and whenever they look at the Rope they should remember that they were free from bondage amen so Lei Prince of Morgan County Alaska the Jubilation of emancipation meant that I am free as a frog because a frog had freedom to jump and where it pleases yet many newly freed realized that this was a time of great uncertainty and danger to WL boost Freedom meant being just like a turtle cautiously picking out of the shell to understand the lay of the land it is that sense of caution that sense of the unknown that shaped the experiences of most African-Americans when Freedom came while many defined Freedom as a chance to reunite with King to ensure the education of their children and themselves never again to experience the violence and sexual exploitation that was much so much part of the institution of Slavery to have the economic where will without to provide for their families the family's well-being they also realize the limit of freedom and the vulnerability that accompanied emancipation as the daughter of a Freed Man explained she said Daddy was so proud of freedom but afraid to own it so this people were free but there was no provision made for their freedom so they knew that they were free but something else was lacking brother Braham told us in the message Paradox he said Joshua here is a book it's a book of redemption of the Old Testament Joshua we will have we have to consider it to be that the book of redemption because it is redemption has two parts Redemption anywhere has two parts that it it's out of and into amen it takes two parts to make Redemption and we see that this people though they got their freedom they didn't know what to do with it they came out of slavery but they didn't know where to go to the children of Israel 2 million people came out of Egypt only two of them went in brother Braham said Redemption has got what two parts there is a coming out of it's good to come out of but are you going into the promised land it's good to say I've given my life to Christ it's good to say I'm in the message church it's good to say that I'm in the message Mage and better than those in the denomination but brother Brown will still tell us that very simple question that was asked in the book of Acts have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed cuz Redemption is in two parts amen Paul told us in Romans 6 verse 16 he said know ye not that to whom ye yield yourself servants to obey is servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God be thank that ye were the Servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered you being made free from sin ye became Servants of righteousness said I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants unto uncleanliness and to iniquity unto iniquity each so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto Holiness we came out of slavery of sin but is making us Servants of Christ where once we lived Our Lives to please the enemy to please Satan to do that thing that he wanted you to do but when you come out of it there is a going into that is what Redemption is Redemption is taking it back to his rightful position coming back to the African-American slaves some of them brother did give a description of one of them who was a prince in his homeland and being a prince in Africa he had all that he desired to have everything that he wanted to have he could have it at fingertips he probably had servants but then he was made a slave now to redeem him Freedom was not enough Redemption is not just Freedom that is the coming out there has to be going in he has to be restored back to his wealth amen and that's exactly what God did God did not just bring us what I'm trying to say brothers and sisters tonight is God did not just bring us out of sin he made a provision for our freedom so that we can go in brother raham said in total Deliverance he said when God sends a man to to do anything he completely equips him with everything that he has need of if he calls a man to be a preacher it puts something in him to preach with if he calls him to be a teacher it puts something in him to teach with if he calls him to be a prophet he puts something in him to see visions and to be a prophet God always completely equips his men said just like if you were a Christian God Don't Make Halfway Christian God makes complete Christians God Don't Make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway Lord help me not to be halfway I was thinking about it if I know there's something that can help the people why should I hold it back because I think of how people will feel Paul said then I should not be a servant of Christ but Abraham said God Don't Make halfway preach preachers preachers can be halfway and God makes his children Christians but sometimes they are Halfway Christian but it's not God's intention for them to be that way it's their own ways got mixed up with a plan of God for their life and that's what makes them the way they are God don't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on either side he wants them to completely stand in the bridge and brothers and sisters if there's anyone of us that is in that state I don't know if anyone is here but I've seen many people in in my journey over you know the years I've been growing up in the message that actually has the question of whether they have the Holy Ghost or not it's not something to put in the back burner right right we've got to make sure we've got to make certain that we have received the Holy Ghost since we believed because you have said you've accepted the message does not mean you've received the Holy Ghost I know there's a quote that sounds like that and I have it here I may not have the time to read it I want us to finish very quickly I know there's a quote that sounds like that but let me explain what brother Braham was saying brother Braham initially talked about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and he said the evidence of the Holy Ghost he literarily just said is the fruits of the spirit and then as God took him on he got to a point where God showed him the dream to realize that the rain falls on the just and the unjust and that's when brother Braham said that you can have the Holy Spirit all the days of your life and still go to hell brother Braham was not talking about the conversion of the Soul Brother Braham was talking about the anointing of the Hool holy spirit that can come upon a man and make that man to live a good life it will have more patience than most of us will have oh you said that's not true go look at the Muslims some of them when it comes to righteousness they will beat us black and [Laughter] blue they qualify more than we do so brother BR realized I I don't have the time to read all the quotes but if you want it I can give them to you it realized that it's not just about the fruit because the anointing can come on someone and then brother Braham got to the point where the Lord made him realize that receiving the holy ghost means that you accept the word for your age now when you say accept the word for your age is not coming to sit in a message church we should not get comfortable by the fact that we are sitting in the message church and our life does not reflect the spirit of Christ do you understand understand that so what brother brah is saying is you will accept the word but in addition to that your life will also tell the story that something has happened Paul said but said he preached what Paul said Paul said the life that I now live it is no more I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me you might ask me the question so if I have the Holy Ghost will I do anything wrong the problem the the the answer is probably and many times you will because you're still struggling with this flesh but let me give a good example that might explain it for us how many people know that all liars will go to hell the Bible said that okay all liars will go to hell right if they don't repent okay how many people believe that brother AB Braham told a lie you've heard the story did he have the Holy Ghost when he told the LIE he did have the Holy Ghost but brother was brother Braham a liar was he always telling lies did he tell a lie yesterday and told it again no but Abraham was pushed to a corner where this flesh was broken down brother Braham was emotionally at a point where he just couldn't take it anymore and because of the weakness of the flesh brother Braham told a lie but guess what happened right after I did what he repented of it that is the real sign that you've got the Holy Ghost is the holy ghost that makes you to say that this that I've done wrong I can't Ste till tomorrow I must make it right right now brothers and sisters it's personal experience that's why I'm able to tell you I I not tell the story but I know that there's been a time in my life I can tell you the story of one time in my life when I knew I received the Holy Ghost right after few months after that I did something that was wrong and I felt like I wanted to die right I couldn't wait to make it right so it's not just about saying I'm a message believer brother the Bram preached and told us that there are three kinds of believer in the local assembly amen that is still part of the message I'm not saying we have make Believers and unbelievers my prayer is is someone who in here as a nonbeliever God gives them the grace to realize that they have to be a believer if someone has been sitting here as a make believer living a double life I was once like that oh yes I was once like that but God's grace came down and made me a Believer but let's remember that it's not just coming to church let's not get comfortable with that right you've come out of the world yes you wear your skirts you know brothers are well groomed they look good we know the language it doesn't take time to learn the message language how many people know that it doesn't take time you know growing up we had cousins that came to live with us they were they were not even Christians they they they were coming from a church that worshiped the man and he didn't take it didn't take long before they they learned the message the message uh vocabulary and then they know how to say God bless you and how to dress fine and be really good one of them my cousin lady I'll say she probably got her Freedom she probably gave her life to Christ she actually did confess of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I felt that was just an anointing and did I see a change in our life I saw some changes in our life but a few years down the line she went back to where her mom was where she wasn't going to The Message Church it didn't take long toci to wear pants today she is a Muslim and sadly living with HIV so it's not just about coming to a message church this part of the service I wasn't supposed to bring it like this but I know the Lord impress it in my heart if you have a question about the Holy Ghost if you are not sure if your life is not telling with the word of God don't get comfortable by being in the message Church don't say I've received the message that is the evidence I've got the Holy Ghost no that is not what he meant by that I know brother Barry quotes that but brother Barry has also made us realize that your life has got to tally with the word amen young people if you have question about the Holy Ghost God has got answers amen find someone who you know that they living a good life they're living a Christian Life and ask them questions we talk about about that in career how do you become successful in your career you need to have a role model you go to someone how did you do it what was it like for you 15 years ago I want to be where you are today and I know it's going to take me 15 years to be there but what was it like for you 15 years ago what was it like for you 10 years ago what was it like for you 5 years ago what steps did you take and by learning from those people you can do the same thing and you find yourself in the same place where they are it is the same thing with a Christian walk amen we've got to encourage one another there are people that add that question in the time of Abram so that you don't feel alone I won't read the answer but I'll just read the question in the message question and and answer is number two preed to 1964 this was one of the questions that brother Braham got the person said dear brother Braham I have been baptized in Jesus name the word says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost does this mean the baptism the Holy Spirit or does it mean I should receive the gift definite I shall receive a definite experience with the baptism am manious to be filled with the spirits please excuse the long note as I've been wanting to ask this question for a long time and the person said thank you the brah said and the person had their name sign and they are one of the out of Town people so people had questions it's not it's not there's nothing wrong with having the question I'll even say it's better to have the question now when you are alive and you can make things right and you can be double sure before that moment when it's between life and death am let's be on our feet tonight I'll just read a prayer that brother Ram fre in the message the impersonation of Christianity yes musicians can come thank you he said and friends in closing just one moment longer and I want you to be thinking deeply and sincerely we're going to leave one day why please tell me why will you try to accept any counterfeit any church theology any intellectuals any emotions anything contrary when the Pentecostal skies are full of genuine blessings the real spirit of God that controls you and makes you a real Christian so you don't have to impersonate a thing you just be a child of the Living God why tell me why will you try to accept anything different when God is willing and waiting and has brought you this far and then trying to make love to you through the Holy Spirit would you accept a declaration of Creeds and so forth and try to get you to heaven or some fantastic mental emotion which not even recognized in the Bible would't you receive it all people of God to your knees and to your God may God have mercy is my prayer while we pray and with our heads bowed let's bow our heads just in this solemn moment when maybe at this very moment there may rest upon you upon this church do not let it be shallow thinking are you making love to the holy spirit that Spirit that's in your life taking out your emotions exactly with the Bible have you longsuffering gentleness goodness the material is not tested listen as you pray material is not tested by its quantity how big it is how big a church and meaning here see it's not tested by its quantity by but by its quality metal is tested by its strength and the church is not tested on how big a church or how many members it is tested by its strength by the Bible how can it say Amen to every promise that God has given how does your life move with kindness meekness gentleness patience that is when it what is it when something RS you there's a little wheel in there th ticking right away keeps you under control his love moves right down through your heart are you only trying to put that on are you just trying to be a Christian oh think now and while you're thinking serious and the Holy Spirit dealing with you broing over you saying child of mine I'm talking to you now in Christ's name with heads bowed before God not me will you raise your hand say God put your spirit in me this is my hand God bless you many many hands and father God the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thy son the ever brooding wooing Queen Holy Spirit I ask that you today will take your place in the heart of every person that raised their hand they've signified to you that they need thee oh how they need thee and if they'll recognize it now what about the hour when the heart is refusing to beat how about the hour that they feel the cold Vapors of death floating in how much more are they going to recognize it then and what are we whence did we come from and where are we going and father we are tired of impersonations of Christian Life create in US Lord today a new heart a new spirit and put your spirit according to your prophet's word in the middle of our new spirit and control Us by love joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience and faith and all the fruits of the spirit may be found in us as we humbly yield ourselves as Souls the in opposed part the life that brings all this Earthly potach and calcium and petroleum together and holds it thus when it leaves we go back to the dust and we yield our spirit we yield them to you and create in us the right kind of spirit and let the Holy Spirit thy Spirit control us and lead us and guide us as we journey on bless this their people heal the sick in the midst of us Lord also and may we say as it left this building this evening it was good for us to have been there the Holy Spirit did a work in us that will change our emotions it will make us a different person than what we were when we come in renew the hope that is in the Saints strengthen them Lord against the day that's coming the corn is fully mature Jesus shall come for the Harvest soon and I pray this blessing in Jesus name amen the Lord has spoken to us tonight his plan is a Plan of Redemption not just a plan of Freedom Redemption has two parts there are coming out and there's are going in if you've not come out the question is when will you come out when will you come out of sin and unrighteousness when will you come out of just being a message child a message girl or message boy to truly giving your life to Christ knowing that you did it if you've come out there's another part of going in receiving the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that will change your life and that will take you like Paul said from Faith to Faith from glory to glory as Peter Will Tell Us in second Peter chapter 1 add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and knowledge Temperance and temp Temperance patience and patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity that will be conformed to the image of the Son of God that's the plan of redemption that's where want to get us back to Freedom is here but what does it mean to you dear father we thank you for the privilege to hear the undiluted word of God

this Lord Jesus is more than anything in life that we could aspire to this has got to do with our Eternal destination Lord may you help us young and old to take it more seriously than before Lord even if we have come Lord Jesus to to that point where we can say that the life that we once lived is no more the life we live and the life that we live is Christ that liveth in us may we know that we need to be totally conformed to the image of the Son of God may we look at our lives if we find anything that is unlike you there Lord Jesus may we take it away Lord there was a man that that you told us a parable of Lord Jesus that found Lord Jesus a field and in that field was a pearl of great price and he went and sold everything to buy that field not just to own the field but to own the pearl of
