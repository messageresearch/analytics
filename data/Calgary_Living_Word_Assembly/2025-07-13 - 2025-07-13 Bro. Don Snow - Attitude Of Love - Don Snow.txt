Let's stand this morning if you would as we start with this ser this song this morning giving praise to the Lord. It's wonderful to tell him he's wonderful.

Oh, you are you [Music] know [Music] You [Music] know like you know [Music] All right. Pray for us this morning. Let's bow our head for a word of prayer. Precious heavenly father, you are indeed deserving all the glory and all the honor, Father God, for there is no one else like you. We can look everywhere, Father God, not one thing. Even creation itself cannot compared to you &gt;&gt; because you are the master of creation. &gt;&gt; Father Lord, this morning we've come to you today, Lord. As I was in my way coming to the church, I said, Lord, I'm coming today. I need a word. &gt;&gt; That is my expectation. I don't know what word you are going to send to me, but I I request it, Lord. &gt;&gt; I need a word. Maybe somebody here needs a word. Even the one that is coming for the God without expectation, you are the God that can meet the expectation. &gt;&gt; Lord, Father, sometime Lord, we do not understand Why we are coming? Because as the trials in this life coming our way, we ask so many questions and sometime your silence can be frustrating. Father, Lord, despise our s your silence, Father God, I believe you can still lead us, Lord. Despis in of our confusions, Father God, I believe, Lord, you can still teach us, Lord Jesus Christ. Father, thank you so much for the opportunity once again to see the day. &gt;&gt; It's a blessing to make a difference in your kingdom, Father God. As we are still breathing, Father God, we still have an opportunity regardless of what is happening over our lives Lord Jesus Christ to prove ourself that we love you beyond everything that this world can offer Lord. Father, there are so many things that the world offering to us Lord Jesus Christ, but we choose to love you &gt;&gt; beyond our knowledge, beyond certificate, beyond wealth, beyond goal because those cannot compare to what you have for us when we cross on the other side, Lord. Father, there is somebody here, Father God, that is expecting something from you. I don't know. Father God, may you meet that needs, Father God. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ, I believe we are coming here, Father God, because we want to offer our ourselves to you because that's all we have. We cannot offer something that is greater than ourselves, Lord Jesus Christ. Our soul must be rendered to you back, Lord Jesus Christ. Father I pray father God that you meet and touch somebody that is need healing to his body or her body lord Jesus Christ. Lord bless the service, Father God. The message that is going to preach, Father God, may it be a message that we've never heard before, Father God, that can transform and change the life that needs to be transformed. There are somebody that is about to backsliding, Father God, because of the trial, tribulations, and persecutions. Father God, may we say like Paul Jesus this morning. Father God, we take pleasure in tribulation, pleasure in pain, pleasure in suffering, pleasure in hardship because when we are weak, that's when we are strong. &gt;&gt; Because your power is made perfect in the time of weaknesses, Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, bless the service. Bless the musician. Bless every single thing, every single aspect of this service. Father God, even those that are not here this morning, Father God, I believe you are not bound by time or space. Father God, go wherever they are and meet them and touch them because to your name belong all the glory, all the praises. Please forgive me, Father God, for anything that I should have said that I don't remember. and forgive everything Father God that I said that I should not have said Father God and may this prayer reach your throne and you answer it powerfully for in Jesus muchless name we pray somebody say &gt;&gt; thank you my brother maybe shake someone's hand as you're seated this morning might not be somebody you know but brother or sister of my precious faith nonetheless good to see all of you this Morning. [Music] I love the confession of this song. I know whom I have believed. Aren't you glad for that? Well, I know not why God's wonderous grace to me he has made known. For why worthy Christ in love redeemed before his own. I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I'm committed unto him against that. [Music] I know not how he say to me. He gave him [Music] his peace within my heart. Oh my god, [Music] and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed. Oh, unto him against that day. I know not how the spirit goes [Music] in Jesus. [Music] Oh, I know. I have and I am that [Music] which I unto him again. [Music] I know what baby [Music] for me or golden days before his face I see all I And I am that he is able to keep that which I committed to him against. [Music] I know not when my Lord may come at night or no day, nor I'll [Music] go. I have believe it. I am persuading all that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that and blessed assurance Jesus is mine. And aren't you happy for that this morning?

Just ask the deacons if they come at this time. Faithful one so unchanging [Music] one. You're my God of peace. Lord of all I depend on you. I call out to you again. Again, I call out to you. Again, again. Oh, everyone. Oh, you [Music] me [Music] your Theor [Applause] I hope you [Music] God bless you saints. Uh before we take the offering we have few announcements here. I think we have two of them here. There was supposed to be a padlock 27th of July, but it's been moved to 31st August. So the next pock is happening, but the next one has been moved to uh Boness Park. And then we have also the youth gathering in the Clawson's house, brother uh brother Joe and sister uh Crystal's house on the 20th of July. Let's bow our heart for prayer. Our precious heavenly father, Lord, once again your children have gathered here together in your name. Father, we've come with our sacrifices. We've come with our praises this morning. Father coming here defying gravity raising our voices raising our hands to worship you. Father we've known what you have done. &gt;&gt; You are the best architect that we know when we did not know who we were. But here you are. This is what you have done. You call us from all walks of life. You call us all when we were doing our own thing and you have put us together in one room this morning. In all over the world, people have gathered in your name. &gt;&gt; Father, we want to praise you this morning. We want to leave whatever we're going to do this afternoon aside and worship you this morning. Father, not everybody have this opportunity to come before you this morning. Here we are with the liberty to worship you this morning. People have traveled from many distances. They could have been at the Stampede Park. They would have been at any places that they chose. But this morning, they know the king is going to be here. &gt;&gt; And they have come to meet him. Lord, may you bless your children. Father, as we've come, we never meet without a problem. We never meet without a need. And this morning, may you move from person to person, from peel to pew and meet the needs that are not known. As our brother said, when he was coming, said, "Lord, speak to me." That should be our prayer this morning. Father, we don't want to come and have a church experience, but we want to come and meet our needs, Lord. We will be careful to come back and give you thanks, Lord. Once again, Father, our pastor has traveled. We pray for brother Barry that you be with him, Lord. Use him wherever he has he is at this moment, Lord. And the brother that is going to stand behind here, Lord, brother Dawn, would you help our brother as he prepares to bring your word? Father, this morning we are bringing our tithes and offering and we ask you to bless it for in Jesus name that we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just the first verse this morning. Great is thy faithfulness, oh God, my father. There is no shadow, no one turning with thee. Oh, thou changeest not thy compassions they fail not. As thou hast been, thou forever will be. Oh yes, great is thy faithfulness. Oh, great is thy faithfulness. Morning by morning, new mercies I see. All I have needed thy hand and proided. Great is thy faithfulness, Lord.

I'll praise when I'm sure, praise when I'm doubted. [Music] I'll praise when outnumbered. Praise when surrounded. Cuz praise is the waters my enemies drowning.

Thank you for both those specials this morning. Stand with me if you would. This wonderful reminders. It's wonderful to praise the Lord this morning. I'm just going to ask brother Don if he'd come at this time. Some of you may not know brother Don's testimony. It's a very wonderful testimony and just thank you the Lord for his life this this week is thinking about him coming and bringing a word of exhortation this morning. I don't know if he calls himself a preacher but he certainly has a gift of poetry. We've been blessed in this assembly by countless poems. I don't know how many that he's written and they're just all mini sermonets in themselves. So looking forward to what God has in store through our brother, but just want to invite him as we sing this this morning. Pass me not. I think that's our prayer this morning. Isn't it? We don't want the Lord to pass us by. As our brother prayed, what Mario prayed, each of us can get one little one little cell, one little word cell that that builds this holy this this this holy faith, just one more notch this morning. That's what we're after this morning. Let's sing it. Pass me not prayerfully to the Lord as brother Don comes. Oh pass we must. Oh gentle. Oh he my cry. [Music] Oh my. [Music] Oh, [Music] to do not pass. [Music] Oh, [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh [Music] my god. [Music] One more time. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Oh my god. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you all. &gt;&gt; Preach in the name of the Lord. Let's just go to a word of prayer. If you have any needs in your life, your heart, whether they're personal or for someone else that you know, let's just lift them up before the Lord. And once again, God will prove himself. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, &gt;&gt; we've gathered, Father, in your name, &gt;&gt; as you told us and taught us, Father, through your Bible, through the revealed word of this day, through the prophet, Father, Lord, and we believe, Father, we believe your way of doing things, Father. Father, sometimes it seems strange and Lord, why you would choose man and the foolishness of preaching, Father. Lord, but it's your chosen way, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, as we stand here as a unified body, Father, we've sung the songs, Lord. We've tilled our hearts, Father. Lord, we've given you worship and open ourselves up, Father. And we just want to lay before you our needs, Father. Lord, not that you would just do them because we ask, but Father, we do lay them at your feet as an opportunity for you to manifest and prove your word in our lives and those around us. Father, &gt;&gt; truly that is why we're here. Father, so the world might know that you are not dead, that you're still alive and you're in the earth in bride form. &gt;&gt; Lord, I have need of you, Father. &gt;&gt; Settle my nerves, Father. Lord, this is not common for me, Lord. I do have a family and I even struggle in that ministry, Lord. But we do know we're standing here today, Father, in your perfect will. &gt;&gt; We have nothing in ourselves that we want to add or bring, Father. Lord, let as the word goes forth, Lord, minister each need. I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I guess let's just read a word of from the Bible first and then we'll take our seats and get settled in and get comfortable. Let's turn to uh Joshua 24. Thank you, musicians. Thank you for the specials today and your worship. Definitely makes it easier to walk out into this presence. Joshua 24 verses 14 down to 16. When you get there, just say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now therefore, fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell. But as for me and my house, &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the people answered and said, "God forbid that we should forsake the Lord &gt;&gt; to serve other gods." &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessing to his reading. You may take your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. Appreciate Brother Mario's prayer. Amen. I know that what's on my heart, it's common, but it come together in a different way than I've ever heard. And I just pray that we could be edified together in it. Amen. I'm not here to put on a show. This is not common for me. I'm a deacon of the assembly here, but this is a part of the office and I've had some tremendous victories in my life since five years ago joining this assembly. And I'm proud to say that I'm a member of this assembly. For a long time, I didn't truly understand what it meant to be a part of assembly and what church actually meant to be a part of a body and a family and the offices of different things in our lives and in our midst. But we'll look at some of them today. But the one in my life that stands out the most is the office of a husband. And we will look through that. with husband and wife and what's on my heart today and the way God put it is if I was to title it it's the attitude of love and we know that this is the capstone age and the capstone is love and we proclaim that you know the the marriage has happened and we can say that in a minute but there has to be a physical manifestation just like when Jonah said &gt;&gt; yes sir &gt;&gt; there's going to be a flood he had to build a boat there's always a physical manifestation that we do in reverence to prove God's word. &gt;&gt; We can't just stand here and say, "I believe God's word," and not apply it to our lives. &gt;&gt; Like I said, I'm nothing special, but then again, I am special because I'm a son of God. So I do believe we need to start stop looking at ourselves through the eyes of what Satan wants us to do and looking at our faults and our failures. Start recognizing that seed gene of God in you. Apply the word and allow it to manifest. But also look for that same seed gene in your wife and your children and your and in your parents and everyone. And then we just have to reverence that word. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to my main context or my main text here Joshua and it's interesting because he's standing there and everyone seemed to be even though they were the chosen of God they were message believers they were mixing the word for the hour with old traditions that they learned from their parents and then they were also now making their own rituals and mixing it with the new understanding. And Joshua, I'm sure he represented many others, but he had to stand up and say, "Listen, this is not what we're here for." You have to drive down a stake and say, "Choose you this day and we're going to look at these things. There's many things that I was taught in the message and many things have been added and it's not necessarily the message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it's not conducive to the message and a lot of times it holds us back and gives us an excuse. We have to take the word that he gave it to us and apply it and then we'll see the the life come forth out of that. It's not even going to be us, but we have to lift up and be sincere and honor and reverence the truth, the word given to us today. Amen. So, I'm going to turn to first John 4. And this is where I've got my title from, and we'll go through it here together. 1 John 4 verses 1 starting there. And I just want you to know when we read this just to kind of help shake us from maybe hearing the same thing over and over again, the Lord can open our ears. But maybe just so that you pause and think a little bit when we read this here. When it says every spirit, the word there in the Greek, there's eight different applications. But in this application here from one down to seven it actually means way of thinking. So I'm going to read it that way and forgive me if that offends you but it is one of the I guess you can say angles of this word here and maybe it'll help you understand it now more than you ever have. But it also means attitude or disposition or reflecting the way in which a person thinks about or deals with some matter. its disposition, its attitude, its point of view, its frame of mind, its way of thinking. And brother Brandham taught us a lot about attitudes and also he taught us about the right frame of mind and how to approach God. Even though we want to talk about the spirit, this mind and that here that we're going to talk about, it's not your gray matter. That's just a muscle. It's actually the thinking in the spirit in you and how it will actually manifest and approach certain situations. So it says beloved, are you his beloved? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love how John speaks. Believe not every way of thinking, but try and that means test and prove the way of thinking whether they are of God because many false prophets have gone out into the world. So many winds of doctrine. People have taken the word and maybe added to it or manipulated it and maybe it was sincere. Could have been their own imagination. Hereby ye know the way of thinking of God. Would you like to know the way of thinking of God? &gt;&gt; You even think back in Genesis, Adam, you know, for a long time I've read that wrong when God said he was going to, you know, it's not good for a man to dwell alone and he was going to make him a wife and then he brought him all the animals. It's like, why did he get sidetracked? We called it in our family squirreling. It's almost like he squirreled away. And I'm just going to be real with you today. Okay? &gt;&gt; But he it was a word test. &gt;&gt; He needed to test the man's thinking. Does he this man think like I think so. So he brought all the animals to him and he named them. But it's not that he named them and go he named them exactly the way God thought they would be named before he even created them in the earth. That was the test. &gt;&gt; And this is what he's looking for in his sons and daughters today. Do we approach life &gt;&gt; through his thinking and he gave us his mind? He sent us this message and we have to reverence it above all else. Even our own thoughts, we have to take it in subjection and put it through this message and then it becomes actually easier and easier. It becomes second nature. It's called the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hereby ye know the way of thinking of God. Every way of thinking that confessth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. And here now John is talking about Jesus. But the prophet taught us that it's every time he comes in every church age. It's when he comes in flesh. He always comes in flesh. He always has a person or a people on the earth &gt;&gt; that he manifests himself through. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he always seemed like the worst bunch of people. And it's a stumbling block for Satan. He's like, "Really? Those people? I know their grandparents. They're who knows how many generations." And he's like, and God's like, "Yep, those people." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And every way of thinking that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that way of thinking of Antichrist. Whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world. And we know that. But there's a lot of many people that are nominal Christians. They're still looking for that to come. They don't even realize they're worshiping Satan right in their churches. And I'm not knocking on them. God has an economy. I leave that in his hands. &gt;&gt; But thank God for a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is also around the message following. There's been many isms and false doctrines pop up and uh we just have to be able to identify them and and walk forward. God will protect us because he given us his mind and his thinking. Amen. Says, "Now ye are of God, little children." Are you puffed up today or do you still look at yourself as a little child? That's how he wants us to see ourselves &gt;&gt; because then he can deal with us &gt;&gt; and have overcome them. Because greater is he that is in you than he is that is in the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now John is teaching us that you have the Holy Spirit and then you also you could have the Holy Spirit and still not be discerning things correctly. So you need to be able to take everything by his way of thinking. So Lord help me. Lord help me understand your thinking. Please allow me to think your way. They are of the world. Therefore speak they of the world and the world hearth them. We are of God. He that knoweth God heareth us. He that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby we know the way of thinking of the truth and the way of thinking of error. Now he says approaches us again. Beloved, let us. Now every time you read let us in the Bible there has to be a willingness. He's not he's a gentleman. He's not going to force anything on you. This is where being a wife as a a surrendered wife comes is you have to choose and it's free moral agency. No one else can choose it for you. Whenever you read let us or let this mind or know that there's a there's that is a I guess you can say a showdown whether or not you're willing to accept it. Love one another for love is of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. So an identifier here of being filled with the Holy Ghost is that the way you love is actually an identifier. How you love your wife, how you love your brother and your sister, and even how you love your enemies. Amen. &gt;&gt; Also, the way you think, the way you move through this world, how you approach situations, whether it's sickness or circumstances in your life, how you approach it is an identifier of who you are. &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, that goes both ways, could be good or bad. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son in the world that we might live through him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Herein is love that we that sorry here is love. Not that we loved God, but that he loved us &gt;&gt; and sent his son to be the prop propation of our sins, which is the appeasement or dissolver. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he's asking this of us, he has to show us and teach us in his word, how am I supposed to love? and we'll we'll get into that. But as I said earlier, we're actually called to love our spouses, our brothers, and our sisters, &gt;&gt; and our enemies. And if you're able to do this in a certain way is an identifier whether or not you have the Holy Ghost. Is that fair to say based on what we've said? We're talking about the mind, the government. The mind is what makes contacts with all thoughts and influences. And we have to take that mind and discern, hold these certain things into cap, whether they're even our own thoughts or not. And they seem grand and they seem great. But do they line up with the word of God? And then a true son and daughter, a bride of God will say, "No, I can't find it in the word. Not interested." Whether we receive it from outside or inside. Amen. If we have the Holy Spirit, we will have discernment by his way of thinking and we will be able to love correctly and all. This is our victory and how we defeat pride. So the greatest enemy or the greatest tool that Satan has is pride. Many different forms of pride, but there's got to be a way to overcome pride. And a lot of times it's putting others before yourself, living for others. Amen. I know many of us know about the cloud and I just want to read a quote and it kind of goes along with what we're saying here. This is from 1965 0718 in the evening spiritual food and due season. Then when that went up the big OB observatories from way down in California plumbed down in Mexico over Tucson everywhere taking the picture of it. It was a mysterious sight. Brother Fred Sauman there sitting right back there and I, brother uh Gene Norman standing right there present when it went up. They took the picture still they don't know what it's about here. Some time ago everybody saying lookie here that looks like them this and them angels and wings and they're folded there. see right away. It's our our nature to try and poke and prod at things and try and give an interpretation. Even a simple thing like this picture, but this picture was a very significant thing, a very significant event. And even there, I wasn't alive or around back then. But I know human nature don't change much. And there's many times things come out and we're like, oh, this and that. We we should be careful on things that we give life to, whether it's a thought or a comment. Our words mean a lot. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we start to see here that even though God does something great, our imagination can run a little while. &gt;&gt; And we knew it was something specific and something tremendous. He said, "One day, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; turning it to the right, looking, there was Jesus Christ just as perfect as Hosman ever did ever draw him." He was standing there with a white wig on, looking back down towards the earth, showing that he is supreme authority. The heavens declare it. The Bible declares it. The message declares it. All the same supreme authority with the white wig on. You see his black beard under. Many of you seen the picture. We got it back there and we got it back here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just turn it to the right. Even the prophet didn't truly understand this picture. The the angel of the Lord had to tell him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just turn it right sideways. Look at it. There he is. is just as perfect as it was if it had been photographed of him. They're looking at it from the wrong angle. Remember, we're talking about a way of thinking. You got to look at it in the right angle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And only the Lord can reveal which is the right angle. &gt;&gt; Turn it to your right &gt;&gt; and look at it. There he is. Just as perfect if it had been photographed up there. I know this seems like a simple thing, but this turn it to the right means a lot to me because there's a lot of things in my life that I in this message I wasn't looking at correctly and God in his grace turned it to the right for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And my question for you today, brother, husband, father, sister, wife, mother, children, teens, young adults. What do you want or need to be turned to the right in your life &gt;&gt; today? What do you need? What do you desire? What do you lack? He is here. &gt;&gt; And he can and will turn it to the right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And everybody will see Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I said, there was certain things in my life and I talk openly about our life and many people here know, but we backslid for 15 years and I don't want to dwell on that. The biggest issue that I understand now was my lack of understanding and revelation of marriage and what it meant to be a husband. Most of my adult Christian walk was full of frustrations because I had a desire to serve the Lord. I had a desire to see the fruits of the word in my life, but I lacked the ability. And that's a big part of our walk. &gt;&gt; We see the word of God and we know it's true. and we want to jump through all the process and get to the end and try and enjoy the the fruit and the blessing of it. But the word is a circumciser. &gt;&gt; It has to cut away the flesh side &gt;&gt; because God can't allow Satan to say, "I've done this because it was done through the flesh." It and I know we have a lot of young people here. Even when I was young, I'm like, "What's the point of life? What is the purpose of marriage or serving God? You might even be middle-aged or older and still asking those questions. I want to approach them today. We have to start with what is the enemy's flood today. Every age has its challenges, but it also has its standard. And the question is is water who is the standard that God has promised to raise up. How's it going to happen? and what's it going to look like? We have to ask these questions to be able to answer them. And when you do, I know in my own life, the question always, it always lays it at your feet. It's never pointing at anyone else because you're the master of your own experience. I can't control even me speaking today. Even though I have a certain intention in my heart, you could totally be missing it and be on a different page. I can't control that. I'm responsible for me and my house and my life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I do know when a son of or daughter of God sees the word made manifest or spoken in truth, they gravitate it to. I've been fed time and time again while I was sitting here in this assembly. God is good because I have an expectation and I reverence the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's talk about marriage. Is that okay? It's the you fix marriages, you fix homes, you fix the church, you fix the city, you fix the world. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Seems rather pointless today in society. Almost everyone you talk to has a failed marriage or has no interest. And maybe even some of our young men and women here today, it's like, why would I ever get married? It seems pretty risky. And that is true. And I want you to think of it this way. Remember when Moses was supposed to come forth? What did Satan try and do? Kill all of the people that it could possibly happen. When Jesus come, what did Satan do? He tried to he tried again to destroy all the young children, the flesh that could possibly make it live. So maybe that's why he's attacking the family and the marriages today is because there's something that's supposed to come forth and manifest out of it. &gt;&gt; We got to stop making everything so super spiritual. &gt;&gt; The word requires flesh. It requires a lived out life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the more we look at it, we understand that in this flesh man, we can't do it. &gt;&gt; And then we get desperate and we struggle and we try. But comes a time when God proves his word and he proves it through human beings, brothers and sisters like you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's way. And that was always Satan's problem is that he could never ever get over. Even Jesus like really that little man, he he can't get past that the flesh side of things that he corrupted it so much. But God left one little space. And once he steps into that, It throws all the rest subject. &gt;&gt; It's not immediate. It's a process. &gt;&gt; And it's because we desire to be changed. We desire to be molded and shaped. Why do you have that desire? It's not because your parents taught it to you. It's a genuine desire in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if Satan ever tries to tell you you're lost or you're done or you're not worthy, Brother Brandham taught us that as long as you have a desire in your heart to serve the Lord in whatever capacity that is, then you're still able. Satan is a liar. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was just fellowshipping with brother Joel yesterday and we got to talking about certain things. And even when Satan comes against you and says you're lost, why would your enemy ever tell you where you sit? The very fact he's telling he if you were lost and he had you, he would just leave you alone &gt;&gt; and just let you carry on in darkness. &gt;&gt; But the very fact that he's trying to tell you that you're lost, &gt;&gt; if you just have the right mind, the right way of looking at things &gt;&gt; and discern things, life will become a lot simpler. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So marriage What is the true revelation and purpose of marriage and family? Why has Satan attacked and tried to destroy the institution of marriage? Amen. It's almost like all over again. He's trying to kill the very avenue on what something great that God wants to do. So, I'm just going to read this quote here. This is from uh proving his word 6408:16. There will be a resurrection of the dead. He'll confirm it. That's right. He'll prove it. There will be a rapture of the church. How's it going to be? I don't know. But he'll prove it. His word's true. There will be a millennium. He'll prove it. It's his word. There will be a new heavens and a new earth. He'll prove it because his word said so. And only the righteous will be there. He'll prove it, too. That's right. Only the ones that's been made part of this word. See, see where see we will be their part and their position in this word for their age. Will be the only one will be there because that's just what he is. He is the word. Now what is a woman? The image of a man. We have to take this wholeheartedly. You have to understand that you as a husband, your wife is a reflection of your ministry. &gt;&gt; Whether you like that or not, if there's issue, please understand that if there's issue in your marriage, if you look at it the right way and apply the word, God will be seen in it. We have many circumstances in that, but that's not that is actually there for us to apply the word. So God can be proved in the earth. It's not about, oh, I want to do this and I want to do that. A woman is the image of a man. And what is it? What is the church? The image of the word. See, that's exactly. See, so it'll be there just exactly. Only the true believers in his word know this and can believe it. And God helps them to prove it. That's right. That is true. So there's an amazing re relationship between God and his children. And yes, God proves his word by bringing it to pass. &gt;&gt; But he brings it to pass through flesh bodies, &gt;&gt; yielded flesh bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we have to ask, well, what is the promise of today? The word of today says that Christ and his bride are married and are one. Our marriages should reflect the revelation and understanding that we receive through being a bride of Christ. No other age has got to live and experience the relationship that we have and it has to have a physical manifestation. Marriage is one of the greatest blessings available to the believer. We have a lot of married people here today. Do you still believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can also be one of the hardest, most difficult experiences, too. Is that true? &gt;&gt; I say amen. &gt;&gt; But God has a purpose in it if it's not handled correctly and entered properly and in accordance with God's word. And even then, it can be hard. But God taught us that there's a process and there is a reason for it. And God wants glory from it. &gt;&gt; But we always have to remember we're triune human beings. And God wanted to reproduce himself. And Satan always also wanted to reproduce himself. When you enter marriage, you can either enterly enter it through the flesh by natural carnal desires. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can enter it by religious spirit and just, you know, it's the right thing to do and it's what believers do and what Christians do. Or you can do it based on a on your soul understanding of the word what it truly means to be married. Amen. &gt;&gt; When entered upon and performed daily in the right attitude intentions, it reflects perfectly the relationship between Christ and his wife. Also, the prophet taught that the believer and his church requires the same level of precision and effort. I think you'll come to understand that marriage is a pride killer. &gt;&gt; One of Satan's greatest tools. If you truly enter marriage correctly and you live for the other person like you ought to. &gt;&gt; Where can pride stand? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is the life that our children need to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just dos and don'ts and do what I tell you. The relationship between my wife and I, the joy in our home, the love and the peace and the safety, the comfort, the blessings, that has to be stronger than the influence and pull of the world. That hit me hard. You can shake your head at it or you can now all of a sudden get desperate and say, "Lord, help me." &gt;&gt; Amen. choosing of a bride. That's where it all starts, right? &gt;&gt; Choosing of a bride. But in there, he mixed in choosing of a church. So, don't take it lightly. When you choose a church, you put the same effort into it as choosing a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I first started coming here, my attitude was, I'll go for fellowship and for a place for my wife and my family, but I was still going to sit underneath another ministry and pay tithes and offerings. God fixed that real quick because it's not proper. &gt;&gt; It's actually adultery. &gt;&gt; You can only have one headship. &gt;&gt; And whether you like it or not, the local assembly and the pastor is above your family. And you as husbands need to submit to that ministry. &gt;&gt; And if you do, God will give you everything you need in your office &gt;&gt; to feed your family and to lead them. I hope nobody's still guilty of that. Maybe our wives and our children aren't submissive to us because maybe we aren't submissive to God in all avenues. total obedience to the whole word of God. Anyway, I'll leave that alone. Now, if the spiritual or the natural, sorry, this is uh paragraph 46. Yep. The choosing the natural is a type of the spiritual, then the choosing of a bride in the natural is a type of choosing a bride, the bride in the spiritual. Amen. Now, it's a serious thing when we go to choose and I'm not attacking anyone. This is just what the Lord laid on my heart. I'm not trying to be if this word hurts you or that is not my my intention is to help people and lift them up and elevate them in their walk. &gt;&gt; This word circumcised me so hard. But the blessings that my family get to enjoy now are far beyond that I ever thought that I would receive as a believer in this word. This word is true. &gt;&gt; Don't just quote it with your mouth. Apply it to your life. &gt;&gt; Every avenue. You're here to manifest the word of God. We're here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to dillydally around and go get a paycheck. Every aspect of your life. Whenever something happens, you're here to prove the word of God. You apply the word to that situation and watch God prove his word through you. Does your boss have a different opinion and testimony of you than yourself? &gt;&gt; Does your wife, does your children, does your pastor, do your brother and sister? Are you willing to take their testimony of your own? Because we can dilute ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That is the worst lies we tell are the ones to ourselves. &gt;&gt; Right? If you have a spouse that is crying out something in their marriage, can you be big enough to humble yourself and listen and then inflect inside and say, "Lord, is that truly how the world sees me?" That's why you have a wife, for her to help you see you and you her. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't just walk through life and just say, "I believe God sent a prophet and the word is &gt;&gt; the word is here to mold us and shape us." &gt;&gt; Even when it comes through from your spouse or even your children, I can't wait for the day when my child comes to me and corrects me with the word. That'll be one of the happiest days of my life. Do you understand what I'm saying now? It's a serious thing. When we go to choose a wife, a man, for the vows here is until death do we part. That's how we should keep it. And you take that bow before God that only death will separate you. And I think we should a man in his right mind, right way of thinking, turn it to the right. I know it might not, but I can't. That's just the train of thought that the Lord led me down. that's planning a future that he should choose that wife very carefully. Be careful what you're doing. And a woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband should be real careful what she's choosing, what she's doing. And especially in these days, how far are we down the road? What he saw being birthed in the earth, it's a thousandfold now. It's very risky for more financial reasons, spiritual reasons. A man should think and pray before he chooses a wife. Not just, oh, I want her feels right. I think today what's got so many divorce cases now that we lead the world in America in divorce cases, we lead the rest of the world. There's more divorces here than anywhere else than this nation and supposed to be and thought of a Christian nation. What a reproach are divorce courts. I think the reason is because that men has got away from God and women has got away from God. But you see, they're still claiming to be Christians. &gt;&gt; It's very easy now. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we find that if a man prayed and a woman prayed over the matter, this is God's way of thinking. Not just look at a pretty set of eyes or a big strong shoulders or such as that or some other worldly affection, but would just look first to God and say, "God, is this your plan?" If that's the grounds on a relationship and a marriage starts, how do you think it's supposed to progress all the way through? It doesn't just stop there. As we know, there's many stages to marriage and life paragraph. I'm going to skip down to 51. And if we would study what we're doing when we're going to get married, and I'm going to pause right here. We're amateur gods. Correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to hit it right here. Now, what true marriage and that is. You're an amateur god. We know. And we went through election. And we know that the segene of God is election. Brother Brandham also taught us that the dirt, the soil that it's placed in is elected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught us that God even created the earth just so he had the materials to make you. &gt;&gt; God's royal seed isn't just placed anywhere. &gt;&gt; It's placed in a very specific place. &gt;&gt; Good soil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know there's a parable about the sewer went forth. That's actually a different parable than a a royal seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; So if God was very specific and he created the earth, he even knew all the way coming down years and years and years and all of a sudden here's brother Paul, here's sister Amber, he knew exactly the mess that you would come from and that you would go through. But he knows his seed gene. It was his choice. &gt;&gt; His choice. So, we're amateur gods. Marriage is how we prove that we understand the message and revelation of election. You, as an amateur god, get to choose the soil that you're willing to plant your seed, but the word of the hour. This is why it's so important. Ultimately, you get to choose the one person in the entire earth to love and respect and honor as if it was Jesus himself in flesh. &gt;&gt; That is what it means. &gt;&gt; You have to choose good soil. And if you're the woman, you have to choose a man that's worthy, &gt;&gt; that's willing to honor the word of God. That is what true marriage is about. When we choose our wife, our husband, if we study it over, a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life. Remember the vows is until death do us part. Or he could ruin his life by making the wrong choice. But if he knows what he making the wrong choice and he's marrying a woman that isn't fit to be his wife and he does it anyhow, then it's his fault. That's right. &gt;&gt; If the woman takes a husband and knows that it's not fit to be a husband to you, that's your own fault. Choices have consequences. After you know what's right and wrong, a husband knows that he's not fit for to be a husband to you. Sorry. And that's your own fault. After you know what's right and wrong, so you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly pray through. The same applies by choosing a church. Now, you must pray over the church that you are fellowshipping in. Remember, churches have spirits. Amen. It's the most So, we never choose God, but we get to choose who we marry. And it's of the same importance. And you do it not because they can serve you. &gt;&gt; It's so that you can serve them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's very hard when you choose to love someone and they don't reciprocate it back. But here, even when you get married, there'll be times when it's 50/50, where it's 100, 100. Sometimes it's 500 to one. &gt;&gt; My wife actually had to live that way for a long time to my own shame. But here we are. I find it odd, but I guess it's according to the word of God that I'm the one who has gets to stand here and minister this because I made all the wrong choices &gt;&gt; once I got married, but I married the right woman. &gt;&gt; It's probably one of the main reasons why I'm standing here today, because at least I got that right. Amen. I brag on my wife a lot because for a long time I did the opposite. When I went through the hardest trial of my faith just recently when I wanted to just curl up and die and fall off the face of the earth. God gave me a true testimony in my heart, a testimony in my heart that I was the most blessed man in the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the truth &gt;&gt; because I understood if this is that great of a trial. What's waiting on the other side is far greater. &gt;&gt; When you feel that way, understand with God's way of thinking, God doesn't hate you. &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring something forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You get to choose the one person in the world to love like they are Jesus in flesh. Reflect his word for the age, husband and wife. Okay, let's kind of dig that down into that a little bit. You don't have to go there, brothers, but or you can bring it up. I'm going to you don't have to go there. I'm going to go to Ephesians 5:21-33 because he we're supposed to love and if we're called to love then God needs to teach us and show us the proper way of loving. Ephesians 5:21-33 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. I heard this so many times but only recently did I truly understand this is a very powerful scripture. It's actually Philippians 2 2:3. If this is actually seed and soil. When you ever think of husband, think of seed. And whenever you hear wife, think of soil. Elected seed and elected soil. Submitting yourselves. I can't make someone else submit. I can only control myself. I can't beat my wife into she can't beat me in the she can't manipulate me because it's you know a man convinced against his will is still of the same opinion still it'll go for a little while right submitting what does that mean Philippians 2 1-15 but I'm just going to read the first as I love this portion of script it's become so real to Fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded, same attitude, having the same love, being of one accord, which is united in spirit, harmonious, of one mind, which is holding one view. You have to marry someone that understands marriage like you do. If you don't, you can still you can till that ground. It'll be harder and longer, but you can still till that ground. And but you're probably going to live in some frustration for a while. But even if you do right, there's still that you're not used to living and serving someone else. So even that becomes difficult, but you'll get through it. But it says, "Let nothing be done through strife, which is selfish ambition, or vain glory, which is cheap pride, but in loneliness, which is humility of mind, let each esteem the other better than themselves, which is more valuable." See, if you understand that you have the Cene of God, you need the soil to be able to manifest what's in you. And you're going to lift it up higher than you because you need it. you desire it. And when you're the soil, you understand you can't fulfill your true purpose unless you receive a seed. That's why the other is more valuable because you can't come to your full maturity or your full purpose unless you have the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, these are really hard here. It's it says submitting. So what it means is don't be going into it with selfish motivation or ambition or cheap pride. I know all about cheap pride. But it's a it's a humbling once you truly understand that true authority comes through humility. It'll totally change how you walk through this world. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And we'll get into the most powerful force in the world today. And you have complete access to it. It's actually your inheritance. It's your right. It's actually your job, your purpose to bring it forth in the earth. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, and he is the savior of the body. Therefore, as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. Now, we can make that easy or hard, but it does say everything, and there's no way around that. But if you pick the right husband and he's lifting you up above himself, and you're lifting him up above yourself, that becomes very easy. What I'm trying to get through here is this is a standard and this is the standard of the age because it's the age of the capstone of husband and wife. Husbands love your wives. So it's not just one way. We got something to do too. As Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it. And I know we all know that. &gt;&gt; But do we do it daily? that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish. So it's actually your sacrifice that's going to allow her to present yourself that bride that you always wanted. &gt;&gt; It's symbiotic. It's not just one way. If you chose correctly, this is the fruit that you will get. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourish it and cherish it, even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they too shall be one flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of times that I didn't feel like one flesh. &gt;&gt; I can honestly say today I can say I do. And I know my wife would amen that. You come to understand that as a spouse, as a husband or as a wife, your testimony of yourself is nowhere near as important as the testimony your spouse has of you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And then when you have children, their testimony, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When I overcome certain things in my life, it was by fleeing from it and running into the word. And when I tried to fix my marriage, I tried the same tactic. Thought, hey, it worked before, it should work again. So whenever my wife would try and express certain things about me, I would run and put on a tape and think that was going to solve. Different circumstances require different actions, but it's all still the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have sometimes marriage is a fiery furnace, but you have to be willing and big enough to sit and listen to your spouse and talk about your letdowns. Times we hurt each other because the only way we're going to grow from it, it's hard. It's difficult because you're a son and daughter of God and you want to be perfect. But sometimes, and we'll get into it, what it actually looks like is we can become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol. It's a stumbling block. But we have to endure and listen to each other and apply the word that will actually bring you closer together. &gt;&gt; We have to be able to communicate. Don't you just love it when you talk to your father and he listens? This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. And it says nevertheless. And that always kind of it seems weird like I don't understand why nevertheless. But the word also means however or but or yet or except. So you can say but let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as his himself. And the wife see that she reverence her husband. So now we have love and respect. And this actually means a lot. It's a very foundational point. And I find it interesting that we're supposed to love, but it doesn't say they have to love us. They have to respect us. But once you dig into it, respect is a type of love. It's a it's a manifestation of love. And I noticed, and I don't know how many people would be honest here, but in my 15 years of backsliding, if my wife and I would get in an argument, she would say, "You don't love me like you used to." or you don't love me. And my retort was always, you don't respect me. I don't feel respected. Now, isn't it amazing that that's what's sitting right in scripture? &gt;&gt; You even talk to most men, they just want to be respected. &gt;&gt; That's our love language. &gt;&gt; But they're all they're supposed to respect the word in us. &gt;&gt; And yes, a part of that is the flesh side. Unfortunately, you married a triune being. So, that comes with it. Amen. So, we're going to look at this love and respect uh because it's going to be important. Brother Brandham preached the message called respects. And in it, when he first talks, he he talks about whenever the word comes in flesh and when a man is standing in his position and the Holy Ghost is using him, if you don't respect it, death lies at the door. &gt;&gt; And he lists it. Countless people that disrespected him as a prophet. And he even told them before you die you'll cry out my name countless c. But then he goes and he talks about the people that did respect. Respect means that you honor and understand and you reverence that word. A lot part of that goes back to husband and wife. The relationship there. So you could be a son of God or a daughter of God and claim the message and not loving your wife or her respecting you and you're totally wrong and you have to fix it. God can't bless it. You'll get some blessings, but not the blessing that you're meant to have. Respect means obey, pay attention, observe. Respects. I spent a lot of time in the message respects. I would encourage you to listen to it because I can't preach that whole thing even though I'd love to. But respects, what respect truly means. Amen. Okay. Okay, I'm going to go to uh first Corinthians because we're told to love and okay, Lord, you I'm supposed to love. How do I How am I supposed to love? Lord, teach me. Okay, 1 Corinthians 13 1-8. Though I speak with tongues of men and angels, and have not charity or love, and love is supposed to be our headship. That's the capstone, right? I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity, which is love, proper headship, I have nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, proper headship, it profitth me nothing. I accomplish nothing. I'm not useful. Although if we were to look at things according to our flesh, be like, "Wow, this this is amazing." In God's eyes, God's way of thinking, &gt;&gt; pointless because it wasn't done in the right avenue or on the right inspiration, motive, and objective. Gifts and callings are without repentance. I was going to come back to this part later, but we're running out of time. I just want people to understand that this is very dangerous. When a wife becomes a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol or a husband to them, it means you're just echoing. There's no life there. You're just talking quotes and message, but there's no no life behind it. You're not loving me like you ought to. or when parents when the kids see that the parents are sounding brass and a tinkling symbol. It's very dangerous because people are like, "Well, why why why did I get married? What a terrible mistake I made." But it's not the end. You can't be saved from this. I was in my relationship. I was that to my wife. But yet here we stand today. So I just want to give you hope. And the question is, are you brave enough to ask your spouse what side of that coin you sit on or ask your children, do I live the life before you? What is your testimony? Please tell me because we're going to get to and he said, "All that you ever loved and all that ever loved you will be there." Are we giving them something to reverence and love and respect to hunger after? Okay. Husbands and wives, we're told to love. Here it is. Love, charity, suffereth long, which means it's patient. It is kind. In other words, it acts kind. This is how husbands are to love their wives and wives love their husbands or respect. Love envithth not. It doesn't get jealous. Love vaunteth not itself. It means that it doesn't brag or boast about itself. &gt;&gt; It's not puffed up, &gt;&gt; which means it's not proud. &gt;&gt; Does not behave itself unseemingly, which is indecently or disgracefully. Seekth not her own, which is means it's unselfish. Is not easily provoked, which means you're upset. Now, this was in my DNA that I inherited. I had a temper like a budsaw. I can honestly say it's gone. &gt;&gt; If my wife doesn't amen that, then I'm a liar. But I'll tell you right now, I and I'd get upset that I would put so much effort in being a good husband and I wouldn't get the fruit that I thought I deserved and then I would every I'd blow up not wanting to and hate myself for it. Thinkketh not thinkketh no evil, which means it doesn't keep count of transgressions. Right? &gt;&gt; I know that's a lot of times &gt;&gt; tit for tat. Well, you did this to me. Even in a marriage, even in a holy ghost filled marriage, rejoices not in iniquity. It means in unjust deeds, but rejoices in the truth, which is the word of the hour. Beareth all things, which which put which means puts up with annoyances or difficulties. This is love. True love, God's love. believeth all things which is Christian faith hopeeth all things which means you look for the good and the beneficial the positive endureth all things which mean you persevere but at the end of all these it says all things so that means in all circumstances whatever comes your way sickness health do we remember our vows now this is a big Love never faileth. &gt;&gt; It means become inadequate for some function. It means to fail or fall out of form. When we read this, I think at least the first thing that comes to mind, Lord, I'm not capable of this, but it's required of me. So then we're like, how We have to die to ourselves. &gt;&gt; This is why marriage is one of the greatest tools because it'll drive you into desperation especially if you know you married on the right circum and then these things come up. It's like, okay, Lord, remember you're planting a seed and it has to grow and it has a different different stages of it, but this is supposed to be the end result. And if we go and we talk to a coworker, God sent a prophet and that, but we don't have the fruits of this. Why would they ever believe or want what we have? Why would our children ever want what we have and serve the God we serve? We don't have this. What benefit is it? &gt;&gt; This is what marriage is supposed to produce. This is what we should hunger and thirst after. This is what should we should strive for. This is what we should seek the Lord for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The circumstances that come around our marriage are meant to drive us closer together and into God as a one unit, &gt;&gt; not drive us apart. So we if it's driving us apart, we're using the wrong way of thinking. It's an opportunity to apply and manifest the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we say we believe &gt;&gt; in John 3:16 and that he says, you know, God sent his son, whoever believeth on him should ever have everlasting life. When you get down to the end, it says, "He that doeth the truth." There's an evolution. There's a growth. Belief is not just claiming it with your lips. It's living it out, applying it to your life. so God can honor and bless it. The blessing is already there. It's just we have to put ourselves in the position to receive it. It's to get us to call out to God together, call him on the scene, to apply the word and prove his promises. Not to beat each other with quotes and &gt;&gt; manipulation. &gt;&gt; Has to be free will. So, and I know we're since we just talked about this, but the question comes, what is the greatest most powerful force in the world? Does anyone know what our prophet taught us? Love. The attitude of love. My attitude towards you is my attitude towards Christ. I'm going to read a few quotes here, kind of bring this all together. This is from what was the Holy Ghost given for 1959 12:15. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to hurt anyone. I'm only preaching things that I've experienced and gone through myself and I know the value and I know the blessing that comes with it. &gt;&gt; It hurts, but it's meant to hurt because it's not hurting your soul or your spirit. It's hurting your flesh. &gt;&gt; We die daily and we know that we're taught by the Bible and the prophet that when a person dies, their soul, their spirit, and their flesh separates. So if we're to die daily to ourselves, would it not stand a reason that our soul, our spirit, and our flesh begins to separate and becomes easier and easier to discern between them so that we can actually give preeminence to the one that's meant to be? Is that a fair thought? That's how you're rapturing. And it's a daily dying to yourself, killing this flesh. I'm sick of this pesto house. I truly am. It's not just something I say. I hate it. I hate everything about it. But I know it's there so that God can get glory. &gt;&gt; So, I endure it. But I know it gets easier and easier to kill it the more and more I serve others. There's a blessing in serving others. I'm so thankful to be able to stand in the office of a deacon &gt;&gt; because it helps me kill this flesh, but also bring a blessing to people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Same Holy Spirit that saved the Lutheran and the sanctified the Methodists that baptized the Pentecostals is now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful that that body will come into this group, a church that'll draw the rest of them from the grave that'll there will be a resurrection. That's what the Holy Ghost is for. This is what what is the Holy Ghost? Without us they cannot be made perfect. They lived in one day under that we live in another day. When the enemy comes in like a flood. So we know today he comes in to destroy homes and marriages. The spirit of God will raise a standard against it. &gt;&gt; And it's a life. It's actually a family masterpiece. Right there he said, "Husbands, if you love your wives, wives, if you respect your husbands, and the next one is children, if they're on the scene, obey and honor your parents." That is God's masterpiece today in flesh. &gt;&gt; And it's a nuclear I studied nuclear families and nuclear bombs. The amazing thing is today nuclear. So this is a nuclear family. It used to be years ago that I studied the the different types of families. I wasn't going to say this, but I feel led to go there. Nuclear family is a husband and a wife and kids. It's funny that they use the word nuclear. We know today the world's full, this is just a thought, take it or leave it, full of nuclear bombs. But God has a nuclear bomb and it's a fusion bomb. When nuclear bombs started first started becoming made, they were atom bombs which separated it. And we know the word of God does that. And then they developed into uh a fision bomb which is it separates and brings together. But the most powerful bombs today are fusion bombs. They bring things together. I don't understand all that, but I just like amen Lord. Thank you. Like all things speak of it. When the enemy comes in as a flood, the spirit of God will raise a standard against it. See, we're in that day now. I just got here. Broken homes versus the family masterpiece. Back there, they wasn't half as smart as today. They couldn't make an atomic bomb or in an automobile. They didn't have science and things that we have now, but in things and things of mysterious things to try to say man blowed together. some what he's talking about is the great, you know, uh, when the earth was created, the great, uh, what's it called again? Sorry. &gt;&gt; Big. &gt;&gt; Big bang. Yeah. The big bang theory. And take some analysis and prove it to make infidels out of people. Now they're trying to tell boys can be girls and girls can be boys and all this woke nonsense. It's it's the same spirit, but it's just coming out in a different way to attack God's promise and word for the day. &gt;&gt; So, why is he trying to do that? Why is he trying to break down what it means to be a man and a woman and a wife and a husband and But now when we need it, the spirit of God raises a standard. What is it? He is pouring in his spirit. Pouring in his spirit. Then those who are resting out yonder in the grave or under the altar of God as the scripture says are crying, "How long, Lord? How long? How much longer? God is waiting on me and you." Amen. &gt;&gt; So many times I'm waiting on the Lord. I'm waiting on the Lord. And here's the Lord waiting on me and you. &gt;&gt; The church is waiting on me and you. &gt;&gt; Adoption time. &gt;&gt; When God can pour into his into us his fullness, his power, his resurrection. And when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible among us, I'm going to ask you, what is your interpretation or understanding of what it looks like for him to be visible amongst us? Is it just signs and wonders and powers or is it marriages built upon the word of God manifesting Christ that way? It's we all we know the age is about marriage and capstone and husband and wife. What would the physical manifestation of that look like if we're the flesh of it? That's just my question. Church in Christ, wife and husband. Here's the next one just to carry on the thought. From that time, 19610415b. This is from that time. There's so many you can punch in. We must love divinely. Love one another. &gt;&gt; Then you don't see your brother's mistakes. I'm going to say your your spouses. If he does not if he does make a mistake, you never you never look at the top of it. You look over the top of it and you love him anyhow. See, that's it. Love those that love you. Then does not the sinner the same thing but love those who were does not sorry but love those who doesn't love you we have no way of escaping it we have no excuses all we can do is get desperate and Lord bring this forth in me what is it that I got to lose of myself that's what shows the spirit of God is in you loving my enemies shows the spirit There's many different ways of showing it, but the prophet said that it'll make you love your enemy as you do your friend. It's an identification. Total obedience to the complete word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a simple one from conferences 1982. The musicians will come. I'll start closing. I have a few minutes left. Love, God's love. Love is the most powerful thing that there is in the world. &gt;&gt; This is agapo love. It conquers anything is love. By this you shall conquer by love divine, loving one another, loving the cause of God, loving Christ, loving suffering humanity. That's how you conquer. Another one from uh the rejected king. And this is the one that I really want to get to. And I'll just read one more scripture and then we'll close. Thank you for bearing with me. I hope it's been a blessing. &gt;&gt; This is a And I looked and I could see the people just as far as I could see still coming, wanting to hug me, screaming, "Our precious brother." Just then a voice said, "All that you ever loved and all that ever love you, God has given you here." And I looked. You know, there's other places where he said, "Are they all Brandoms?" He's like, "No, they're your converts." You have to know we all have a ministry. &gt;&gt; Every one of us. As insignificant as you might feel, you have a ministry. The world is caught on to that. They call them influencers. When are we going to rise up with our ministry? Not going out and it's just living this life. Your neighbors seeing the love of Christ. Just then a voice said, "All that you ever loved and all that ever loved you, God has given you here." And I looked and here come my old dog come walking up. Here is my come my horse and laid his head upon my shoulder and knickered said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given them into your hand through your ministry through your influence people that respected the word. Now I want to ask where is that in scripture? It's got to be found somewhere in the scripture. Have you ever had questions like that Lord? Where is it? Because I want to know if it applies to me or you. God can't do something outside of the word. It's actually John 3. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that anyone that would believe. We're talking about whenever God comes in flesh. If anyone's able to reverence that word in whatever capacity, that's a type of love back and they can get eternal life for it. Jesus, if people even went into his shadow, could get healed. Today we're taught that even if someone is kind to you and gives you a glass of water, they can receive eternal life. [Music] And I'm felt myself move from that beautiful place. And I looked around and I said, "Are you awake, honey?" She was still asleep. And I thought, "Oh God, oh help me, oh God, never let me compromise with one word. Let me stay right straight on that word and preach it. Preach it isn't just standing here doing this. It's living your life. Brother Brandham said it's the most important. He said live it. Live the message. I don't care what comes or goes, what anybody else does, how many Sauls or sons of Kish rise, how many this that and the other. Let me Lord press to that place. all fear of death. I say this with my Bible before me this morning. I've got a little boy there, four years old, to be raised. I got a nine-year-old girl and a teenager and I'm thankful for that's turned the way of the Lord. God let me live to bring them up in the admonition of the Lord of God. &gt;&gt; And above that, above that, my own flesh and blood. The whole world seems to scream to me. 90 year old woman and men of all kinds. If you hadn't have went, we wouldn't have been here. And God, let me press the battle. But if it comes to dying, I'm no more morose, which means gloomy. A gloomy disposition. A disposition of love is what's required. It will be a joy. It would be a pleasure to enter from this corruption and disgrace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my precious friends. 168. My beloved, John was calling us his beloved. My darlings of the gospel, my begotten children unto God. Listen to me, your pastor. You, I wish there was some way I could explain it to you. There's no words. I couldn't find it. It is not found anywhere. But just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing you ever. There is no way to explain it. There's no way I can't just do it. But whatever you do, friend, lay aside everything else till you get perfect love. &gt;&gt; It starts at home. Marriage, I guess you can say, is your practice ground if you want to say. He allowed you to choose one person in the entire world to love and it becomes difficult but he allowed you to choose because then from there you can love your brother and your sister and you can love your enemies &gt;&gt; because you can go home to a place where you know perfect love resides and you once you receive it you want to give it to anyone that you can. He said when so you know divine love is projected sovereign grace takes over. I'm going to press that battle. So he made uh he talks about the experience. He says that one visit there to me has made me a different man. I can never never never be the same brother Brandham that I was. Whether the planes are rocking, whether the lightning is flashing, whether the spy has a gun on me, whatever it is, it doesn't matter. I'm going to press the battle by the grace of God. For I preach the gospel to every creature and every person that I can persuading them to that beautiful land yonder. &gt;&gt; It may seem hard. It may take a lot of strength. I don't know how much longer. We don't know. Physically speaking, he just got a doctor's exam and he said, "You got 25 more years." He go, "That helped me." But oh, that wasn't it. That isn't it. It's something within here. This corruption has got to put on corruption. The mortal has to put on immortality. Amen. I just want to read one more scripture. You don't have to turn there. Maybe you were like me and you weren't able to love this way. Maybe you still can. And maybe your marriage is seems completely broken. My family is proof and it's right here in scripture. So don't get dismayed. &gt;&gt; There's a final word here. If you feel this word has kind of hurt you and you feel like all is lost and done, that's not the God we serve. Ezekiel 36:33-36. [Music] Now this was to the natural and royal seed of Abraham. Thank God a prophet taught us this. Thus saith the Lord God, in the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities. &gt;&gt; I've had iniquities. I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the waste shall be builded, &gt;&gt; and the desolate land shall be tilled. Whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. This is how God works. I'm thinking on this scripture about marriages, relationships, and they shall say, "This land that was desolate has become like the Garden of Eden." &gt;&gt; And the waste and the desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord God Lord build the ruined places and plant that was desolate. I the Lord have spoken it and I will do it. &gt;&gt; What a promise. &gt;&gt; Do you believe? &gt;&gt; You willing to accept it? You willing to take the tilling process, the breaking of the soil, the flesh, allow God to bring his word to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the scripture we read first, choose you this day. Whom will you serve? As for me and my house, &gt;&gt; we shall serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Amen. Just gonna let's just close in a word of prayer and I'll get brother Emanuel to come and close us with a few songs if that's okay. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you, Father, for your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank you for prophet that brought us the word, the truths, Father, of this hour. Thank you for spouses, Father, that want the standard of the word in their homes. When one is weak, the other is strong. Father, for our children's sake in the future, Father, Lord, may we be able to just surrender all to you. May those around us, our neighbors, co-workers, our brothers and our sisters, especially our children, Lord, see the word made manifest, Father. Not just talked about, but reverenced in a lived life, applying it daily, dying to ourselves. Father, that is our desire. Lord, forgive us of our shortcomings and our failures. Father, Lord, take this word, Lord. [Music] May it bring fruit, Father, in this assembly. May it bring fruit in this city. May it bring fruit, Father, in the country. We can't do it, Lord, but we're relying on you and we're willing to surrender, Father. We accept your word of life and we walk forward in it. Thank you, Father, for this day and this opportunity, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. I don't see it. Jesus, make me more. Amen. Bless you, brother. [Applause] Give me a heart still. &gt;&gt; Make me more like you. Make Make people more like you, Jesus. Make me more like you. [Music] Give me a heart as great with love and make me more like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you come under expectation this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you love Brother Don's testimony? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shall we put our hands together for you know I believe that everybody who went through that situation if you go through the lows you wouldn't be happy you wouldn't enjoy it but God was using that to talk to us today &gt;&gt; praise the name of the Lord Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember brother Abraham speaks of Moses and his temper and he says God gave him a wife. Hallelujah. He gave him a wife that will help him. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I thank you, brother Don. I think that there have been so many nuggets in this that I &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I sat there listening and thinking, wow, if we could just not miss this. It's simple, &gt;&gt; but it's the truth. &gt;&gt; If we could just not miss it. It says, "As for me and my house, &gt;&gt; as for me, it starts with me. &gt;&gt; It's me first &gt;&gt; because I cannot give what I don't have. &gt;&gt; So, I have to stand somewhere &gt;&gt; and then get there before my house." But you see that Joshua doesn't say, "Well, if my wife agrees, if my children agree, &gt;&gt; yes, sir." &gt;&gt; As much as he cannot save them, he still make the determination &gt;&gt; counting on the strength of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have to spend time on our knees, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't think, sister, that you are not part of it. You are part of it. &gt;&gt; If your husband is not in his position, stay on your knees. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe in that. Ask for you and your house. Children, if your father and mother are not here, you have to believe and stay on your knees. Ask for you and your house. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; It's as for me and oh man, I &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just see that I'm going on and on, but I just can't go without saying this, brothers. I'm not repeating what he said, but just don't forget this. He said it &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; If I am lost, if I'm the devil's camp, why would he need to come and tell me? &gt;&gt; So every time he comes to tell you that, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When he comes to tell you that, just get up and jubilate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's what he used to distract us. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Thank you very much, Father. I think one of my favorite sites was if you hadn't went, we wouldn't be here. &gt;&gt; It's something we read it and we just cross over it. It's important. It's necessary. When somebody comes and tells, "Oh yeah, the pro prophet said this, but let's put it aside and take the Bible." You know what he's denying you? Life. The only thing to meet the conditions of today is what God prepared for the conditions of today. &gt;&gt; And that's the message. &gt;&gt; There's absolutely nothing else. &gt;&gt; If somebody, oh yeah, okay, where is that? But let's put it aside. Be careful out there. They doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Go through all the denominations, they'll tell you, we believe the Bible, not any man. Actually, they will accuse you of believing a man. So if that precious thing that you have that sets you apart, you take it out, we are a denomination then &gt;&gt; and a poor excuse at that. &gt;&gt; I just wanted to say this. &gt;&gt; Let's be on our feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Um shall we say uh love lifted me if [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; I was singing deep in sin far from the mion very deeply within singing to Christ. I am master of the sea and might be the one.

You are the precious one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the reason for our gathering. &gt;&gt; You are the one we desire to please. &gt;&gt; We love you. Father, thank you again, oh Lord, for gathering us here this morning. We know like everything else that you do, you had a purpose. &gt;&gt; You called us to talk to us. You called us to reveal yourself to us like a husband to a wife. Father, we love you for that, oh Lord, for father not holding anything back, oh Lord, for declaring you the entirety of your purpose for this life to us. Oh Lord, we pray that you will help us, that will not take it lightly, oh Lord, that we'll go forward knowing what are your desires, what you love, but and what you have empowered us to do to please you, oh Lord, and just hold on to it, Father. Be completely sealed out of the world, oh God. Completely focused on you, Father. Because we have come this far believing in your precious promises, Lord. And father, you've always vindicated your word. And that is why we are who we are. We know you spoke from the foundation of the earth, oh Lord, and brought us to be, Father, to serve your purpose, oh God. Help us to please you every step of the way in everything that we do. Father, let our desire be to please you, Lord, because that is how you made us. That is how you called us, Father. And as we venture and consider the sacred institution of marriage, oh Lord, may we seek to uphold your word above our &gt;&gt; desires. It's just frightening the way things are going, Father. But we know with your strength, we have already made it. &gt;&gt; And so we say glory be to your name. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray for my brother Dawn. May you continue to strengthen him. May you continue to make him an example of why you intended to the relationship between yourself and your bride to be &gt;&gt; bless his family. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father, he's he's put himself out there. The devil will not leave him alone. &gt;&gt; But he knows already that victory is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, Father, have your way. Not just in the life of my brother, but every single soul in this congregation. Lord, help us all to be completely focused on you. not be distracted by the selfless selfishness that is going on in the world. Oh Lord, but to understand that every aspect of this institution is a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; The father's sacrifice, the mother's sacrifice, that children's sacrifice. Help us, Lord, oh Lord, to be pleasing to you. We love and appreciate your precious savior. Even as we go out, Father, may you lead us. May you bless us throughout the week. Help us to reflect once more on why you've called us &gt;&gt; and what the purpose for which you were called. Oh Lord, be with our pastor and those brethren in that bridge. Oh Lord, bless them, oh God. And at your appointed time, bring us all together again. In Jesus Christ's name do we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The brother said two songs, blessed I have decided to follow Jesus. [Music] I have to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus.
