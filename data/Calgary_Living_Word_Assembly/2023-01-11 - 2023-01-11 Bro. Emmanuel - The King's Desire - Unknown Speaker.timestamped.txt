[58:42] all right and so
[58:44] um
[58:45] from the scripture we read yes I chose
[58:48] to read this from Chronicles
[58:51] because
[58:52] um it makes a special distinction now
[58:55] this story it's it's it's related almost
[58:58] word to word and second Samuel in fact a
[59:01] little more detail in second Samuel but
[59:03] it makes a very important distinction
[59:05] with which I I think I I
[59:08] I want to draw attention right off the
[59:10] bat and that is that it refers to these
[59:14] three captains as the mightiest
[59:18] and I think that in all of the scripture
[59:21] that is the only place where they are
[59:23] referred to as the mightiest in fact in
[59:25] all of the King James Bible the only
[59:26] time the word mightiest is used in the
[59:29] superlative is in this sport so I just
[59:32] wanted to read that there's to sort of
[59:34] uh bring out what I want to speak about
[59:36] now
[59:38] um my topic this evening will be
[59:40] the king's desire the king's desire
[59:45] now it's true most of us will see this
[59:48] as uh maybe a story of Conquest a story
[59:51] of uh fighting and it's it's all of that
[59:55] but it's more than that it's a story of
[59:58] love
[59:59] hallelujah it's a great story of love
[1:00:02] that is expressed by these people
[1:00:03] towards the Akin now we have to know
[1:00:07] that David at this point was not a king
[1:00:09] yet
[1:00:11] but they knew that he was the coming
[1:00:12] King Hallelujah they knew that he was a
[1:00:16] communication so they sought every
[1:00:18] opportunity that they could get
[1:00:20] to please him
[1:00:21] and Brian says the least of his desire
[1:00:24] was their command Hallelujah
[1:00:27] even at the risk of their lives now I
[1:00:30] want to start off quickly by reading
[1:00:32] this uh quote
[1:00:34] from why little Bethlehem now it's a
[1:00:37] long quote I'll read parts of it um
[1:00:40] hopefully I can end this and not drag it
[1:00:44] too long
[1:00:45] so why little Bethlehem that's uh
[1:00:47] December 1963 brother Abraham says
[1:00:51] if I only had a drink inside of him
[1:00:54] cried out if I could only drink once
[1:00:57] more from that bowl at Bethlehem
[1:00:59] his desire was a commandment to those
[1:01:02] who loved him
[1:01:04] he said remember his soul was crying for
[1:01:07] a drink of that water and those who
[1:01:10] loved him
[1:01:12] his least desire was a command
[1:01:15] Hallelujah now the desire was a command
[1:01:18] not to everybody but to those who love
[1:01:21] him praise the name of the Living God
[1:01:23] now the fact is what I want to bring
[1:01:26] across is why talk about David
[1:01:28] yes these are military men these are
[1:01:31] Fighters or Warriors and they are loyal
[1:01:33] to their King and so what now further
[1:01:36] down the line Abraham says David here is
[1:01:39] a type of Christ
[1:01:42] because Christ is David's son
[1:01:45] here he was standing there crying for a
[1:01:48] drink
[1:01:48] of that water and his desire was a
[1:01:52] command
[1:01:53] and then he says I say to those who love
[1:01:56] him
[1:01:57] Hallelujah three of those men pulled
[1:02:00] their swords and forth 50 miles of men
[1:02:03] down to that City While others fought
[1:02:05] keeping
[1:02:07] them were Gallant Fighting men those
[1:02:10] Philistines twice their size some of
[1:02:12] them
[1:02:13] they were great men they trusted God
[1:02:16] they had faith in their leader and they
[1:02:19] cut
[1:02:20] his way down true until while some of
[1:02:25] them cut and the other one got a bucket
[1:02:27] of water and they cut their way back
[1:02:30] through another 15 miles of them and
[1:02:33] brought that up to David so he could
[1:02:35] drink
[1:02:36] praise the name of the Living God
[1:02:39] now so brother Abraham tells us that
[1:02:41] here David is the type of Christ and so
[1:02:44] for those who loved him the least of his
[1:02:47] desire was a command now for most of
[1:02:50] these people David actually represented
[1:02:53] the will of God for Israel
[1:02:55] because it's a time that Israel has
[1:02:57] started backsliding because the
[1:02:59] leadership was backslidden
[1:03:01] praise the name of the Living God and so
[1:03:03] these people were very attracted to
[1:03:05] David
[1:03:06] and because they were attracted to David
[1:03:08] they were also committed to the cause of
[1:03:11] David and so they were living even to
[1:03:14] die for it
[1:03:15] but in all of this their life with him
[1:03:18] was that they were doing everything they
[1:03:20] can seeking every opportunity just to
[1:03:23] please him so they were not thinking of
[1:03:25] how far they can go before sin no
[1:03:28] instead they were looking for the
[1:03:30] opportunity
[1:03:31] praise the name of the Living God
[1:03:35] so their question always was
[1:03:38] will this be pleasing to my Lord
[1:03:41] in everything that they did what they
[1:03:43] sought to do was will this be pleasing
[1:03:45] to my Lord when they are talking they
[1:03:48] are thinking as what I'm saying is going
[1:03:50] to be pleasing to my Lord when they are
[1:03:52] dressing is what I'm the way I'm
[1:03:54] dressing going to be pleasing to my Lord
[1:03:56] when they are driving is the way I'm
[1:03:59] driving going to be pleasing to my Lord
[1:04:00] praise the name of the Living God and
[1:04:03] wherever they are they sought to please
[1:04:06] the Lord praise the name of the Lord
[1:04:11] now when the people are seeking to
[1:04:14] please the Lord like that what are they
[1:04:16] doing they're seeking to represent him
[1:04:19] they are seeking to portray him to the
[1:04:21] rest of the world they are seeking to
[1:04:24] say this is what it is when the spirit
[1:04:26] of God lives in a man Hallelujah
[1:04:30] and so brother Brian tells us that
[1:04:31] they're for 15 miles
[1:04:33] to Bethlehem and 15 miles back other
[1:04:36] places he gives a different numbers
[1:04:40] but you see when you are doing that
[1:04:42] fighting through
[1:04:44] people now it's like this your King has
[1:04:47] expressed a desire
[1:04:49] the desire is Behind Enemy Lines and now
[1:04:52] we're talking about Bethlehem but at
[1:04:54] this point is Enemy Lines and so you
[1:04:57] have to fight through this now you don't
[1:05:00] know how many people are there
[1:05:02] you don't know anything about it but
[1:05:05] because the King has a spirit and that
[1:05:07] is all their motivation their King has
[1:05:09] expressed a desire and so they have an
[1:05:12] opportunity to fulfill it and so I
[1:05:14] wonder sometimes is that Earth attitude
[1:05:17] towards God is that our Behavior towards
[1:05:20] God hallelujah you have to do that this
[1:05:23] is I I would say is that it's it's a
[1:05:26] love an expression of love and it goes
[1:05:29] beyond love of Duty this is like
[1:05:31] devotion out of love
[1:05:34] praise the name of the Lord and so we
[1:05:37] will understand as we go ahead and what
[1:05:39] spirit will make a people behave like
[1:05:41] that
[1:05:42] because at this point
[1:05:45] they've heard they Akin
[1:05:47] and without telling him that's the other
[1:05:49] part of it they never said a word to him
[1:05:51] and so they are behaving like like
[1:05:55] a lover
[1:05:56] who has got a hint of their beloved
[1:05:59] and they are seeking and putting their
[1:06:01] lives on the line just to please it
[1:06:04] Hallelujah
[1:06:06] now because of what all this entails and
[1:06:10] the extent of the sacrifice and the
[1:06:13] display of bravery and all that God kept
[1:06:17] a record of all this Hallelujah he gave
[1:06:20] the record of all this which I I would
[1:06:23] say the exploits for their King
[1:06:26] and they are also exploits for Israel
[1:06:28] but even more than that they are experts
[1:06:32] for God's program for that day
[1:06:34] because while God's program for that day
[1:06:37] was what he was doing with David
[1:06:39] and these people caught the Revelation
[1:06:42] and so they put their lives to it
[1:06:44] Hallelujah on behalf of the revealed
[1:06:46] word
[1:06:47] he even kept a record of their names for
[1:06:50] posterity and so the First Corinthians
[1:06:53] 10 tells us that all of these are
[1:06:55] written for the benefit of those of us
[1:06:58] Hallelujah those of us who are in the
[1:07:02] For Whom the ends of this world have
[1:07:04] come trying to speak like the Bible
[1:07:05] Hallelujah
[1:07:07] and so my question is how burdened are
[1:07:10] you for the things of God
[1:07:12] how burdened are we all for the things
[1:07:14] of God when we read the scripture when
[1:07:17] we hear the message
[1:07:19] and we see all the all the sin around us
[1:07:23] how burdened are we do we just take it
[1:07:26] that oh yeah they're unbelievers does it
[1:07:28] or are we burdened do we want to do
[1:07:30] something about it because these people
[1:07:32] saw what is going on and they took the
[1:07:35] steps to do something about it but what
[1:07:37] I'm saying is
[1:07:38] we are all witnessing the spirit of
[1:07:41] Sodom and God Finance
[1:07:43] how do you feel about it within you
[1:07:46] we see that complete adulteration of
[1:07:49] Christianity just being watered down to
[1:07:51] to a club it's like a lodge that you can
[1:07:54] just join to meet nice people and have
[1:07:57] fun the world has been taken out of some
[1:08:00] way and the focus and emphasis the
[1:08:02] science are somewhere else
[1:08:03] and when you see that how do you feel
[1:08:06] and how do you want to react because for
[1:08:09] these people the least of the desires of
[1:08:11] the King was a commandment
[1:08:14] Hallelujah even in the message we see
[1:08:17] that happening but you see when you love
[1:08:20] somebody and this is why I'm asking
[1:08:22] these questions then you care for the
[1:08:24] things that are important to the Beloved
[1:08:27] praise the name of the Lord and so this
[1:08:29] is where we have been called to that
[1:08:32] these people fall their way
[1:08:35] 15 miles in
[1:08:37] then they got the water now they are
[1:08:40] coming back
[1:08:41] and they are fighting people not just
[1:08:44] any people trained people people who
[1:08:47] would be happy to kill them they have to
[1:08:50] fight them without knowing their number
[1:08:52] but as they're fighting them to they are
[1:08:55] keeping their bucket of water
[1:08:57] praise the name of the Lord and so think
[1:08:59] of the extent extent of it why they were
[1:09:05] they went and they brought this power
[1:09:06] David
[1:09:08] no wonder he did not drink it because he
[1:09:10] did not even feel worthy to drink it
[1:09:13] he did not feel worthy to drink it at
[1:09:16] all
[1:09:16] he you see yes then the first was there
[1:09:19] the initial first was there
[1:09:21] but once they came and he realized what
[1:09:25] had happened it changed into all it
[1:09:28] changed into admiration it it dawned on
[1:09:31] him the extent of the sacrifice that
[1:09:34] these people are willing to go for his
[1:09:36] sake Hallelujah
[1:09:40] now why would these people raise their
[1:09:43] life so much for a bucket of water
[1:09:46] couldn't they get any bucket of water
[1:09:48] from anywhere
[1:09:50] and especially this pocket it's not as
[1:09:52] if if if David doesn't drink he's going
[1:09:55] to die on heaven in the end he didn't
[1:09:57] even drink it
[1:09:59] and so why would they rake their life
[1:10:01] that much
[1:10:03] and this is the key they caught the
[1:10:05] revelation of what God was doing in that
[1:10:08] day
[1:10:09] Hallelujah they received a revelation
[1:10:12] for their day and and and that is what
[1:10:16] happens when people cut the Revelation
[1:10:18] for the idea they behave strangely they
[1:10:22] don't anymore belong to the crowd
[1:10:26] and even as they stand apart and they
[1:10:28] are different they are still proud to be
[1:10:29] different
[1:10:31] now I could talk so much about that but
[1:10:34] I just want to draw attention to
[1:10:36] something like
[1:10:37] um
[1:10:38] Moses for instance
[1:10:40] or the appearance of Moses amram
[1:10:43] Djokovic they call it revelation
[1:10:47] and so there was an order from a king
[1:10:49] but what they had received from was from
[1:10:51] a higher authority and so they had their
[1:10:55] baby but they wouldn't kill him
[1:10:58] right they defy the king's orders
[1:11:01] when when Joseph and Mary had to run to
[1:11:04] Egypt it was in defiance of an order
[1:11:07] from from Herod
[1:11:09] now I could go on and talk of all so
[1:11:12] many other things that people do but all
[1:11:15] I'm drawing attention to is the fact
[1:11:17] that when you catch the Revelation for
[1:11:19] your day
[1:11:21] it sets you on a course of action that
[1:11:24] is not like anybody else
[1:11:27] of course the devil will fight you
[1:11:30] and that is why we find this happening
[1:11:32] like Bethlehem is now a Garrison of the
[1:11:36] Philistines that's what the Bible says
[1:11:38] and so for it to be a Garrison
[1:11:41] it means that
[1:11:42] they've captured the city
[1:11:44] they control the city they fortified the
[1:11:48] city they are stationed at the city and
[1:11:51] they operating from the city
[1:11:53] it's practically theirs
[1:11:55] and that is David's hometown
[1:11:58] he can mention his his grandfathers who
[1:12:02] formed that City
[1:12:03] but now here they are under enemy
[1:12:06] territory and so that is what happened
[1:12:08] the devil fights all the time but you
[1:12:11] see program tells us that these three
[1:12:13] people trusted God
[1:12:16] Hallelujah and so when he said they
[1:12:19] trusted God it's like this God had
[1:12:22] already spoken by the lips of Samuel
[1:12:24] and he had already stated that David was
[1:12:27] going to begin
[1:12:28] there was no power in heaven that was
[1:12:31] going to stop that
[1:12:32] when God already declares his plan when
[1:12:35] God already declares intention nothing
[1:12:38] can stop it
[1:12:40] and because of what they had received
[1:12:43] because of what they had believed it
[1:12:46] started dictating their behavior it
[1:12:48] started dictating their actions
[1:12:51] praise the name of the Living God and
[1:12:53] this is where I'm saying that you have
[1:12:55] received God's program for this day you
[1:12:58] know what God is doing today
[1:13:01] how has that affected you
[1:13:03] how many of the things that we do is
[1:13:06] influenced by what we see surrounding us
[1:13:08] now remember a Christian is supposed to
[1:13:10] act not react you act based on your
[1:13:14] convictions of the word you have
[1:13:15] received
[1:13:16] and not all what goes around around you
[1:13:19] and so here we are these are three
[1:13:22] people who permitted the weather they
[1:13:24] have received to dictate their actions
[1:13:27] they had a revelation that David was a
[1:13:30] coming hand
[1:13:31] and they were not afraid to stand by him
[1:13:33] they were not afraid to take his time
[1:13:36] knowing that this is ordained of God
[1:13:38] hallelujah
[1:13:40] now
[1:13:42] I'm reading uh from why little Bethlehem
[1:13:47] a little further down it says remember
[1:13:50] when David come to his throne these men
[1:13:54] stood by him because he knowed they
[1:13:57] knowed he was coming to the throne they
[1:14:00] note that David was going to be on the
[1:14:02] throne no matter how much he was
[1:14:04] rejected he was the worst fugitive in
[1:14:07] their land and so is the true word of
[1:14:11] God
[1:14:14] this is a very sad situation but I like
[1:14:17] the fact that first it says David
[1:14:19] represents Christ now he says David
[1:14:22] represents the true word of God and
[1:14:25] Christ is the word and it says it's
[1:14:28] foreign to organizations
[1:14:31] and that's precisely where we are that
[1:14:33] the true word of God the revealed word
[1:14:35] of God is foreign to organizations
[1:14:39] but it's been revealed to you
[1:14:41] and God if there's one thing you can say
[1:14:43] about God is that he does not waste one
[1:14:45] word
[1:14:46] everything he said he meant it and it's
[1:14:50] supposed to produce something in us
[1:14:51] hallelujah
[1:14:57] now we know Jesus is the word of God
[1:14:59] made flesh
[1:15:01] and the Bible says that
[1:15:03] he comes to destroy the West
[1:15:07] of the evil one
[1:15:09] Hallelujah and so wherever Jesus is made
[1:15:12] manifests
[1:15:14] in whatever whatever life in whatever
[1:15:17] situation what happens is that because
[1:15:20] Jesus is made manifest the west of the
[1:15:22] evil one are destroyed
[1:15:25] Hallelujah now when you receive this
[1:15:28] message of the hour this revealed word
[1:15:31] of the hour which by the way is a
[1:15:33] program of God for this season
[1:15:36] any action that you take based on this
[1:15:40] word is a distraction of the work of the
[1:15:42] evil one
[1:15:44] but more than that any action that you
[1:15:47] take is also a testimony of the Lord's
[1:15:50] victory
[1:15:51] praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:15:54] whether you are at work
[1:15:55] what do you do as long as it is part of
[1:15:58] the word that you have believed as long
[1:16:00] as it's out of your conviction you are
[1:16:02] destroying the works of the evil one
[1:16:03] Hallelujah and you're manifesting the
[1:16:06] victory of the Lord in your life
[1:16:09] when you do that at home your actions
[1:16:12] based on the word this message that we
[1:16:14] have received you are destroying the
[1:16:15] works of the evil one and you are
[1:16:17] witnessing Hallelujah the Lord's Victory
[1:16:20] praise the name of the Living God
[1:16:22] and so we when we are called and when we
[1:16:26] are giving this message what we are
[1:16:28] coming to do here
[1:16:30] is to witness the complete fulfillment
[1:16:33] of God's word for today
[1:16:36] by accepting that word by believing that
[1:16:39] word by acting on that word we become
[1:16:42] Witnesses of his Vindication because God
[1:16:46] will not fail never not with vindicate
[1:16:49] his word no if the word is made manifest
[1:16:51] in your life he is there to confirm it
[1:16:55] praise the name of the Lord
[1:16:58] I'm reading from influence
[1:17:05] 1963 brother Raph says and whatever God
[1:17:08] has called you to let it be
[1:17:12] because he wants you to be a real
[1:17:14] housewife
[1:17:16] to reflect your influence upon another
[1:17:19] person that would want to be a good
[1:17:21] white housewife
[1:17:23] if you're a good businessman let your
[1:17:26] life so be that will reflect Jesus
[1:17:29] Christ in your business with honesty and
[1:17:31] integrity and with things that really
[1:17:34] mean something because somebody is
[1:17:36] watching your life you are influencing
[1:17:39] somebody
[1:17:40] God has to have a real housewife God has
[1:17:44] to have a real Teenage in school young
[1:17:47] people
[1:17:49] God has to have a real minister
[1:17:54] a real businessman somebody that will
[1:17:57] reflect him
[1:17:59] because there they see in you Christ
[1:18:04] no matter what the rest of the world has
[1:18:06] got to do that has not one thing to do
[1:18:09] with you or I we are responsible to God
[1:18:12] for our lives and for our experience in
[1:18:15] Christ
[1:18:16] praise the name of the Living God
[1:18:20] now we understand that David
[1:18:23] he was a Shepherd boy
[1:18:25] a few years before now
[1:18:27] he was taking care of his father's
[1:18:29] business
[1:18:31] which is in the countryside
[1:18:34] the Throne of Israel was the farthest
[1:18:36] thing from his mind
[1:18:38] it was God himself who went to him it
[1:18:42] was God who sent a prophet to David
[1:18:45] to go and tell him what he wants for him
[1:18:49] God declared his plan to David the only
[1:18:52] thing David did was believe it
[1:18:56] Hallelujah but it was God who went to
[1:18:59] declare his plan to David and what I
[1:19:02] want to say is that most of us were not
[1:19:04] looking for God
[1:19:05] no it was God himself who came our way
[1:19:08] it was God himself who spoke to us
[1:19:10] praise the name of the Lord and so once
[1:19:13] he has spoken he cannot take it back
[1:19:15] and so let's take him at his word
[1:19:19] we are not called to prove that word it
[1:19:21] is his responsibility
[1:19:23] Hallelujah
[1:19:29] so God took care of everything in spite
[1:19:32] of all the obstacles and difficulties
[1:19:35] and that's what he does for us too
[1:19:38] but as he protects us
[1:19:40] our duty is to love him
[1:19:44] and also completely commit ourselves to
[1:19:47] his purpose for our lives
[1:19:49] Hallelujah
[1:19:51] it was God himself who called David a
[1:19:54] man after his own heart
[1:19:56] Hallelujah it was God himself who even
[1:19:59] named The Throne of Israel his chosen
[1:20:02] people he named it the Throne of David
[1:20:05] Hallelujah and so sometimes you say oh
[1:20:08] if God did that then he chose him for a
[1:20:11] special purpose maybe things were smooth
[1:20:13] for David maybe things were easy for
[1:20:16] David no not David
[1:20:19] Hallelujah from the time he was anointed
[1:20:22] he went from one obstacle to other until
[1:20:24] he was crowned
[1:20:28] against him were so high
[1:20:31] that quite frankly it's difficult for
[1:20:33] any person to assume how even David
[1:20:36] survived
[1:20:38] because you see while the king of Israel
[1:20:41] at that time who just saw was looking
[1:20:43] for him
[1:20:44] to destroy him
[1:20:47] David had nowhere to go
[1:20:49] because the neighboring Nations he had a
[1:20:52] bad reputation there
[1:20:53] they all knew he had killed their
[1:20:55] champion
[1:20:56] they all knew he killed Goliath
[1:20:58] and so and he didn't even knew about the
[1:21:01] song about David
[1:21:02] that yes Saul had killed a thousand
[1:21:04] David had killed his ten thousands I
[1:21:07] believe personally that maybe they would
[1:21:08] even rather see David dead that's all
[1:21:11] because David was the one who was
[1:21:13] leading them out and in until he fell
[1:21:15] out with Saul
[1:21:17] and so this is the situation
[1:21:19] that he felt one obstacle after the
[1:21:22] other
[1:21:25] and I believe that a lot of times when
[1:21:27] God calls us
[1:21:28] sometimes he plays us into such a
[1:21:30] situation
[1:21:32] where you become a fugitive
[1:21:35] where you don't fit in quite well
[1:21:37] and then you are forced to look up
[1:21:40] Hallelujah you are forced to look up to
[1:21:43] him and him alone
[1:21:45] praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:47] now you see in all these things and they
[1:21:50] ought against him God still protected
[1:21:53] him
[1:21:53] why because he has spoken about him and
[1:21:56] this is part of where I wanted to get to
[1:21:58] that God has spoken about you
[1:22:02] Hallelujah
[1:22:03] it was God's responsibility to bring him
[1:22:06] the throne to bring him to the throne
[1:22:08] it is God's responsibility to bring you
[1:22:10] to that same throne
[1:22:14] praise the name of the Living God is the
[1:22:16] Queen of Heaven here
[1:22:18] God has spoken to you
[1:22:19] God has spoken about you it was God who
[1:22:23] called you his bride it was God who
[1:22:26] called you his elect it was God who said
[1:22:28] you were perfect without blemish it was
[1:22:31] God who said you are the apple of his
[1:22:33] eye if God speaks like that about you
[1:22:35] who are you to oppose it who are you to
[1:22:38] resist it what I'm saying is let's yield
[1:22:41] to his desire
[1:22:43] Hallelujah
[1:22:48] I'm reading from revelation
[1:22:51] chapter 4.
[1:22:52] that is 1961.
[1:22:57] look at David portraying Christ
[1:23:02] see when David was coming into power
[1:23:05] the first thing he had an awful time
[1:23:07] before he got into power
[1:23:10] yet he had anointing on him
[1:23:12] Hallelujah
[1:23:16] yeah the anointing was on him
[1:23:19] and a lot of people thought he was just
[1:23:21] a little Renegade a little guy that was
[1:23:24] different trying to tear up something
[1:23:27] but there is some men know that he was
[1:23:30] the coming King
[1:23:31] they stayed right with him brother I
[1:23:35] mean you couldn't even get them away
[1:23:37] from him
[1:23:38] as they walked on
[1:23:41] Hallelujah
[1:23:43] so this were people who caught the
[1:23:46] revelation
[1:23:48] and they lived by it
[1:23:51] Hallelujah
[1:23:53] anyway
[1:23:54] so the Lord protected him by placing
[1:23:56] many people in the life of David
[1:23:59] and those people were there to protect
[1:24:01] him
[1:24:02] those people were there to bring him to
[1:24:04] the throne so that all that God has
[1:24:07] spoken concerning Israel and concerning
[1:24:09] David will come to pass
[1:24:11] and so because they caught the
[1:24:14] Revelation they knew that in spite of
[1:24:16] the fact that he's a fugitive noun
[1:24:19] his ordained and in fact anointed for
[1:24:22] the throne
[1:24:24] and there's a blessing for everyone who
[1:24:27] placed a role in bringing to pass the
[1:24:30] word of God
[1:24:31] Hallelujah
[1:24:33] these were people who found their
[1:24:35] identity in the revealed word of the day
[1:24:39] have you found your identity here
[1:24:42] Hallelujah listen
[1:24:44] everybody reads the Bible all these
[1:24:47] churches are reading
[1:24:49] And when they see bright they know yes
[1:24:51] it's the Church of God and those that is
[1:24:53] going to save and but you read it I know
[1:24:56] it's about you and it's for now
[1:24:59] Hallelujah you know he is here to take
[1:25:01] you home
[1:25:03] praise the name of the Living God so
[1:25:05] when you find your identity you yield to
[1:25:08] the cause
[1:25:14] they were true to the Revelation their
[1:25:16] God about what they were created for
[1:25:19] they do their purpose also protect the
[1:25:21] king
[1:25:23] they knew they were to bring him to the
[1:25:25] throne
[1:25:26] because it was the king's desire now
[1:25:29] watch this it was Kevin's desire but it
[1:25:32] was they deserve the King of Kings as
[1:25:33] well
[1:25:34] because David his desire and that of God
[1:25:38] have become one at that point Hallelujah
[1:25:42] so they were willing to do whatever they
[1:25:44] can to fulfill
[1:25:47] the word of God even at the Peril of
[1:25:49] their own lives
[1:25:50] and that's why God handed him Hallelujah
[1:25:54] God honored them in his word
[1:25:57] God knows you as an individual Soldier
[1:26:00] God knows that he calls you alone
[1:26:03] especially as a gentile
[1:26:04] and God will always honor your
[1:26:06] faithfulness to his word
[1:26:08] and so when you receive that word there
[1:26:11] is nothing more than to be faithful
[1:26:14] praise the name of the Living God he
[1:26:16] brings his own word to pass
[1:26:24] now
[1:26:25] if a person can find his identity in the
[1:26:29] revealed word of the hour
[1:26:32] What Spirit do you think it's an
[1:26:34] operation at that point
[1:26:37] because
[1:26:39] no other spirit
[1:26:41] outside the Holy Spirit and I know you
[1:26:44] say oh we're talking about the Old
[1:26:45] Testament no Spirit Will Reveal your
[1:26:48] identity to you in the word of God
[1:26:50] outside the Holy Spirit
[1:26:53] praise the name of the Living God so if
[1:26:55] you know yourself now understand it it
[1:26:58] didn't just happen it's not because you
[1:27:00] are smart it's not because I'm preachers
[1:27:02] stayed here and repeated it no God
[1:27:05] revealed it to you
[1:27:08] and when he speaks to you personally
[1:27:10] like that then he'll reward your
[1:27:12] faithfulness to that word that he has
[1:27:14] spoken to you
[1:27:15] Hallelujah
[1:27:18] I want to read from ah the church ages
[1:27:22] this is lovely yes
[1:27:25] in the programian church age
[1:27:29] brother Rhymes says now see that the
[1:27:31] proof of the indwelling spirit was to
[1:27:33] acknowledge and follow what God's
[1:27:36] Prophet gave for his age as he said the
[1:27:39] church in order
[1:27:43] Paul had to say to those who claim
[1:27:46] another Revelation all having people
[1:27:48] claimed other Revelations oh yeah the
[1:27:51] message is good but it's not only the
[1:27:53] message
[1:27:55] now what did God say if you believe the
[1:27:58] Bible go to the Bible read it and
[1:28:00] understand that God himself said the
[1:28:03] Lord himself shall descend with a shout
[1:28:07] so if God promises that he is bringing a
[1:28:09] message and he brings it you think it's
[1:28:11] foreign it's not for a purpose and he
[1:28:14] declared it and so we know what it's for
[1:28:18] but still
[1:28:20] people who use logic and claim other
[1:28:22] revelation
[1:28:23] I thank God that we can stand on this
[1:28:26] revealed word
[1:28:29] Paul had to say to those who claim
[1:28:31] another Revelation what came the word of
[1:28:34] God out from you or came it unto you
[1:28:37] only the evidence of a spiritual
[1:28:39] Christian believer is not to produce the
[1:28:42] truth but to receive the truth and to
[1:28:46] believe and Obey it
[1:28:49] praise the name of the Lord and so when
[1:28:51] you find these people
[1:28:53] they are soldiers they have caught the
[1:28:56] revelation of their age
[1:28:58] that word is not for us today but it was
[1:29:00] for them then
[1:29:02] to receive the Revelation for their day
[1:29:04] believe and obeyed and put their lives
[1:29:07] through it
[1:29:08] their lives were on the line every step
[1:29:10] of the way all that they did
[1:29:13] you understand that there is a spirit in
[1:29:15] operation and that is the spirit of God
[1:29:20] um I want us to read a couple of verses
[1:29:21] from first Samuel 22 so that will get a
[1:29:25] little feel of who who were these people
[1:29:28] who followed
[1:29:29] David
[1:29:42] first Samuel 22
[1:29:46] um
[1:29:48] I'll just reach the first two verses
[1:29:57] the first two verses of first Samuel 22.
[1:30:01] David
[1:30:06] therefore departed them and escaped to
[1:30:09] the cave Adam
[1:30:11] and when his Brethren and all his
[1:30:14] father's house heard it they went down
[1:30:17] theater to him
[1:30:18] and everyone that was in distress
[1:30:21] and everyone that was in debt and
[1:30:24] everyone that was discontented guided
[1:30:27] themselves together unto him and he
[1:30:29] became a captain over them and they were
[1:30:33] with him about 400 men
[1:30:38] everyone that was discontented everyone
[1:30:41] that was in debt brother there is a man
[1:30:44] here who will not hold your background
[1:30:46] against you
[1:30:48] you'll not hold your history against you
[1:30:50] in fact he'll pay your debts and he will
[1:30:53] send you free to make a choice
[1:30:56] and that's what sometimes
[1:30:58] baffles people because if the Lord has
[1:31:01] done all of this for me then maybe I'm
[1:31:04] I'm bound I'm obliged no
[1:31:06] it's not an obligation he's a gentleman
[1:31:10] he shows you what he can do for you and
[1:31:13] he leaves you to make the choice
[1:31:15] praise the name of the Living God
[1:31:18] now if we read I think second second uh
[1:31:21] someone 15 I'm not going to read it
[1:31:23] because I I really want to finish quick
[1:31:27] it talks about some other people who
[1:31:29] joined him
[1:31:30] and and I mentioned it because in this
[1:31:33] case they were gentiles
[1:31:36] and and I'll confess right now that What
[1:31:38] attracted me the most
[1:31:40] or the name of the Ali that's why I I
[1:31:42] looked him up he tied the guitar I
[1:31:45] thought it rhymed
[1:31:46] he tied the guitars
[1:31:49] but this is a man who is well when he's
[1:31:52] here guitar this means he's from gas
[1:31:54] he's from the place where Goliath was
[1:31:58] but he followed David and not just him
[1:32:01] 600 other men with him he was Captain of
[1:32:04] these 600 men and not only that their
[1:32:07] wives and their children were with him
[1:32:09] and even when David gave him the
[1:32:11] opportunity now this was David had
[1:32:13] ascended the throne and had been
[1:32:15] betrayed by his son Absalom and he was
[1:32:17] leaving
[1:32:19] and David said go back said no way I'm
[1:32:22] going with you now you know what
[1:32:24] happened
[1:32:25] after David came back when the Army was
[1:32:28] organized into three separate divisions
[1:32:32] One Division was led by a job
[1:32:35] there won't be enough time to talk about
[1:32:37] him here but if you read the Bible you
[1:32:39] know about job
[1:32:42] the other one was abhishai
[1:32:45] and then the third one was itai
[1:32:47] so it's like even in the camp of David
[1:32:49] there was no difference between Jew and
[1:32:51] Gentile
[1:32:52] Hallelujah I hope you're looking at it
[1:32:55] because I've already stated that
[1:32:57] according to brother I'm David
[1:32:58] represented Christ
[1:33:00] the name of the Living God
[1:33:04] and so from the scripture that we we
[1:33:06] just read in in in
[1:33:08] 1st Samuel 22
[1:33:11] we find out that King David had hundreds
[1:33:15] of Fighters and especially mostly from
[1:33:17] Israel and they came to him ready to
[1:33:20] fight
[1:33:21] they knew who was the coming King
[1:33:24] they knew he was coming to the throne
[1:33:26] and I believe there are people here
[1:33:28] today
[1:33:29] who know that there is a coming King
[1:33:33] there are people here who know that he's
[1:33:35] going to sit up on the throne of his
[1:33:37] father David
[1:33:39] praise the name of the Lord now what I I
[1:33:42] I I asked at the beginning I'm still
[1:33:44] asking this is it just mere knowledge
[1:33:48] or are you willing to do something about
[1:33:50] it
[1:33:51] especially when you know he's not a very
[1:33:53] popular person
[1:33:54] no he's not easily accepted he's not
[1:33:58] recognized in places
[1:34:00] that was the situation of David that is
[1:34:03] the distillation of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:04] Christ now like program says the pure
[1:34:07] word is not accepted among the
[1:34:09] organizations right and so that's the
[1:34:11] situation now if you want to know what
[1:34:14] it was like for David
[1:34:17] everybody knows the story of Abigail I
[1:34:19] think you'll find it in first Samuel 25
[1:34:21] I hope it is
[1:34:23] and everybody knows the story of Abigail
[1:34:25] when David the husband rather the
[1:34:28] husband neighbor when David sent and
[1:34:30] these people went to ask for and that
[1:34:32] was the time David was a fugitive they
[1:34:35] went to ask for help they wanted to ask
[1:34:37] for food
[1:34:39] what did Nebo say who is David
[1:34:43] who is the son of Jesse so there there
[1:34:45] are slaves these days who don't who
[1:34:47] break away from their masters should I
[1:34:49] take my food and water and give it to
[1:34:51] them
[1:34:52] right that is how much it was hated in
[1:34:54] some circles
[1:34:56] because this man was prospering and that
[1:34:58] the regime of Saul
[1:35:00] but those who were indebted those who
[1:35:03] are discontent they went with David
[1:35:05] Hallelujah
[1:35:09] and the soul and the establishment
[1:35:11] rejected everything David
[1:35:13] not just a man but all the people who
[1:35:16] sort of associate with him and that is
[1:35:19] key and that is very special for us
[1:35:21] today to understand that
[1:35:24] for us
[1:35:25] to be with our King
[1:35:27] it means life as normal won't actually
[1:35:30] be
[1:35:31] because most of these people they left
[1:35:33] their towns they left their Villages
[1:35:35] they went into the Wilderness they went
[1:35:37] into a cave they were not at one place
[1:35:39] at the time they were roaming they were
[1:35:42] vagabonds
[1:35:43] that is what it meant to take a stand
[1:35:45] for David then
[1:35:47] rather if we have taken a decision it
[1:35:50] means we will bear his reproach
[1:35:54] it means we'll share in his rejection
[1:35:56] but it also means ultimately that when
[1:35:59] he comes to the throne Hallelujah will
[1:36:01] be there with him
[1:36:03] and that is the cause that is the
[1:36:04] motivation and that is why we are
[1:36:06] supposed to focus on praise the name of
[1:36:08] the Lord because even Jesus himself had
[1:36:11] to focus on what lies ahead to pass
[1:36:13] through a time of difficulty
[1:36:15] Hallelujah
[1:36:18] so this is a beautiful picture of the
[1:36:20] selfless commitment and dedication that
[1:36:22] is required of us
[1:36:25] we are commanded to do it it's an act of
[1:36:28] love
[1:36:29] and for us most of these things it goes
[1:36:33] beyond desire
[1:36:35] it's a commandment of the king
[1:36:38] so we are not called to check and see
[1:36:40] and pick and choose oh did he say this
[1:36:42] did he really mean it was it no
[1:36:46] halleluia if you hear it
[1:36:49] he meant it
[1:36:51] praise the name of the Living God
[1:36:55] now
[1:36:57] David was not called to generate
[1:36:59] anything
[1:37:01] he was called to be himself
[1:37:03] only faithful to what God has called him
[1:37:06] for
[1:37:09] because when God calls you
[1:37:12] he doesn't call you to do
[1:37:15] he called you to yield
[1:37:17] so that he will do through you
[1:37:20] praise the name of the Lord and when you
[1:37:23] catch that Revelation you rest
[1:37:26] praise the name of the Living God
[1:37:29] because you see from the beginning of
[1:37:30] time God has never ceased from his
[1:37:32] desire to dwell in a man's heart
[1:37:35] he has never ceased to lead from the
[1:37:38] heart Hallelujah but you see when you
[1:37:41] yield to him it also pleases you in the
[1:37:44] line of fire of the devil
[1:37:47] right
[1:37:48] and then he starts all the alarms go off
[1:37:51] and all the distractions come in
[1:37:54] but it doesn't matter if you are yielded
[1:37:57] to him
[1:37:58] he'll protect you
[1:37:59] Hallelujah
[1:38:03] now second Samuel 8 says that the Lord
[1:38:06] preserved David
[1:38:08] with a server he went
[1:38:12] and as we read and we read a lot about
[1:38:15] David he was not busy thinking about his
[1:38:17] defense
[1:38:18] he was not busy thinking if there are
[1:38:21] some Traders among him the his group
[1:38:24] no
[1:38:25] he was just moving forward
[1:38:29] according to the word of God he was
[1:38:31] conscious that God has already declared
[1:38:33] it it'll come to pass and all of the
[1:38:36] people who were with him they knew it
[1:38:38] and so they kept marching forward
[1:38:41] because it was God's responsibility and
[1:38:43] it's no different from today
[1:38:45] and so this is all what I keep saying
[1:38:48] it's no different from today God has
[1:38:50] spoken about us we can't figure out how
[1:38:53] he's going to do it but he'll bring it
[1:38:54] to pass
[1:38:55] and so let's just focus on the things he
[1:38:58] said about us let's read it let's love
[1:39:01] it
[1:39:02] let it be the things that we meditate on
[1:39:04] Let It Be the things that we think about
[1:39:09] even when there are distractions
[1:39:11] sometimes they are there to bring the
[1:39:13] best out of you
[1:39:14] sometimes God permits these distractions
[1:39:16] to bring some correction some
[1:39:19] encouragement some strength sometimes
[1:39:21] just an opportunity for him to reveal
[1:39:23] himself a little more to you just for
[1:39:25] you to realize oh I'm still with you
[1:39:28] praise the name of the Living God and so
[1:39:30] this happens over and over so that the
[1:39:33] will of the Lord will be done
[1:39:35] so don't focus on oh
[1:39:38] he saw me and he pretended he hasn't
[1:39:40] seen me
[1:39:41] he looked at me and he whispered to that
[1:39:44] brother
[1:39:45] oh he looked at me from top down
[1:39:47] so what
[1:39:49] if you understand who is with you why do
[1:39:52] you like about why do you care about who
[1:39:53] is against you
[1:39:56] praise the name of the Lord
[1:39:58] Hallelujah
[1:40:01] anyway
[1:40:02] I'm just getting to where I wanted to be
[1:40:05] and then I'll I'll
[1:40:07] get to closing
[1:40:09] now beside the hundreds of committed
[1:40:12] Warriors whose sole purpose was to bring
[1:40:14] David to the throne
[1:40:16] there was an elite group of 30. who were
[1:40:20] part of his inner circle
[1:40:22] and these people were utterly completely
[1:40:25] devoted to David with a French and
[1:40:28] loyalty like like nothing could dissued
[1:40:31] up or change them they were there
[1:40:33] and they didn't care about their lives
[1:40:36] as long as David was safe and
[1:40:38] flourishing it doesn't matter what
[1:40:40] happened to them
[1:40:41] that is the extent of the of the
[1:40:43] commitment
[1:40:45] and then after this Elite group of 30.
[1:40:48] now if we read the Bible sometimes you
[1:40:50] want to count you'll count about 36 37
[1:40:52] part of it with some some Diet some
[1:40:55] replace them and all that but
[1:40:57] they were always called the 30 of David
[1:41:00] now beside this Elite group of 30 there
[1:41:02] was what he calls the three mighties
[1:41:07] now these were over the top
[1:41:10] so much so that the Bible recalls their
[1:41:13] experts and please let's just read a
[1:41:15] little bit from second Samuel and and I
[1:41:18] think it's better read from the Bible
[1:41:20] than All That I Can Say
[1:41:24] so I would go to second Samuel
[1:41:28] 23.
[1:41:39] the second Samuel 23 I'll read from 18
[1:41:50] second Samuel 23 yes I'm reading from
[1:41:53] 18.
[1:41:58] and abhishai the brother of joab the son
[1:42:01] of zeruya
[1:42:03] was Chief among three
[1:42:06] and he lifted up his peer against 300.
[1:42:10] and slew them
[1:42:12] and had a name among three
[1:42:15] was he not most honorable of three
[1:42:18] therefore he was their captain
[1:42:21] how be it he attend not onto the first
[1:42:24] three
[1:42:25] now I'll pause here
[1:42:27] because they have mentioned where I'm
[1:42:29] going to and that is the first three
[1:42:32] now we've mentioned these three matches
[1:42:35] ferocious Warriors nothing could stand
[1:42:39] in their way and by the Bible is
[1:42:41] describing one of them
[1:42:43] and and and the things that he did
[1:42:46] now abhisha was very specific in the
[1:42:48] fact that yes he was the nephew of David
[1:42:50] and he was always by David but look at a
[1:42:54] man who could stand at one time and
[1:42:57] literally do the impossible
[1:42:59] and I say that I'm not afraid to say
[1:43:01] that the Bible doesn't say that but
[1:43:04] how do you kill 300 fighters in a day
[1:43:08] how do you kill 300 Fighters at a stand
[1:43:11] they are not babies or animals they are
[1:43:15] warriors and they are powerful ones like
[1:43:17] that because they've captured part of
[1:43:19] your country
[1:43:20] and then one man you take a stand and
[1:43:23] you kill 300. that is abhishai IBC I was
[1:43:27] the kind of man that one point
[1:43:30] when David wanted to go to to to to to
[1:43:32] to to to to
[1:43:33] saw when Saul was hunting for David and
[1:43:37] everything and David wanted to go to
[1:43:38] where Saul was flying I sleep fast
[1:43:40] asleep and cut something and show to him
[1:43:42] that yes I could have killed you he said
[1:43:44] who will go for me Abisha was the only
[1:43:46] one who said I'll go with you Abisha was
[1:43:49] the man when David was cornered at one
[1:43:51] point that even the the giant was going
[1:43:54] to kill him I believe that was the one
[1:43:55] who killed the giant first
[1:43:57] and after all of these things the Bible
[1:44:00] says he did not attend to the first
[1:44:02] three
[1:44:04] just note that
[1:44:06] let's keep reading
[1:44:11] 20 he says and benaya the son of jeruida
[1:44:15] the son of a valiant man of capsuil even
[1:44:19] his father was Valiant
[1:44:20] who had done many acts
[1:44:23] he sleeps two lion-like men of Moab he
[1:44:27] went down also and slipped a lion in the
[1:44:29] midst of a pit in time of snow
[1:44:33] and he's still an Egyptian a goodly man
[1:44:36] and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand
[1:44:40] for he went down to him with the staff
[1:44:43] and plugged the spear out of the
[1:44:45] Egyptian's hand and steal him with his
[1:44:48] own spear
[1:44:51] these things did benaya the son of
[1:44:53] jehoiah and had a name
[1:44:56] had the name among three Mighty Men
[1:44:59] he was more honorable than the 30 but he
[1:45:03] attended not to the first three
[1:45:07] one would ask what else is left of this
[1:45:12] killed lion like men two of them killed
[1:45:16] it now the Egyptian it doesn't say but
[1:45:17] in Chronicles it actually says that the
[1:45:19] Egyptian was a giant
[1:45:21] and benaya killed him
[1:45:24] and after all of that he says he
[1:45:26] attained not to the first three
[1:45:30] who are the first three
[1:45:33] but Abraham talks about them over and
[1:45:35] over and talks about their exploits uh
[1:45:38] to to David because they were the top of
[1:45:41] the land that there was none above them
[1:45:43] in David's Army
[1:45:45] and because we are at second Samuel 23
[1:45:49] maybe we'll just read about them
[1:45:51] because the record of their data also
[1:45:53] recorded
[1:45:55] but what what is drawing my attention so
[1:45:58] much and why I want us to see it is the
[1:46:02] fact that they were gentiles now I
[1:46:05] wouldn't read that or know that from
[1:46:07] this Bible
[1:46:08] but program told us they were gentiles
[1:46:11] Hallelujah so just like you and I they
[1:46:15] call the revelation of the hour now
[1:46:17] understand that as Gentiles at that time
[1:46:20] they were not even entitled to know or
[1:46:22] hear
[1:46:23] about David or know about God's plan
[1:46:27] for that time
[1:46:28] but as long as they committed themselves
[1:46:30] to read God honored them
[1:46:33] and this is very important I don't want
[1:46:36] anybody ever listening to somebody
[1:46:38] saying oh yeah it's a fancy they know
[1:46:41] you've done this and you cannot stand
[1:46:43] and
[1:46:43] all it takes is the commitment
[1:46:48] nobody said even God did not say you are
[1:46:50] able but commit first and he'll take
[1:46:53] over from there
[1:46:55] praise the name of the Lord
[1:46:57] let's read second Samuel 23
[1:47:00] let's read I will read from eight
[1:47:05] and then maybe I'll
[1:47:06] I'll just about
[1:47:08] closing
[1:47:11] seconds that's where we are
[1:47:14] from eight it says these be the names of
[1:47:17] the Mighty Men whom David had
[1:47:19] the technology that sat in the seats
[1:47:22] Chief among the captions the same was
[1:47:25] adino the S9
[1:47:27] he lift up his spear against 800 whom he
[1:47:31] is still at one time
[1:47:36] he did what was impossible to do without
[1:47:39] the hand of God
[1:47:42] so for him when he held the sword
[1:47:45] there was no compromise
[1:47:47] when he held the sword there was no
[1:47:50] retreat when he held the sword
[1:47:52] he never gave up
[1:47:55] praise the name of the Lord now remember
[1:47:56] we are not sent to go and go out there
[1:47:59] and kill people
[1:48:00] the thought of the spirit is the word of
[1:48:02] God
[1:48:04] Hallelujah
[1:48:05] and so a sword has been handed to you in
[1:48:08] this end time
[1:48:12] it has been funded to you and it's Sharp
[1:48:15] the question is what is it for are we
[1:48:19] just supposed to just display so that
[1:48:21] everybody will know what the sharp sword
[1:48:22] we have
[1:48:24] or are we supposed to go forward with it
[1:48:31] I'm reading from nine
[1:48:34] and after him was a laser the son of
[1:48:37] daughter the our height one of the three
[1:48:39] mighty men with David when they defied
[1:48:43] the Philistines
[1:48:44] that way they gathered together to
[1:48:46] battle and the men of Israel were gone
[1:48:49] away
[1:48:50] he arose and smooth the Philistines
[1:48:53] until his hand was weary and his hand
[1:48:56] cleaved onto the sword
[1:48:58] and the Lord wrote a great victory that
[1:49:00] day and the people returned after him
[1:49:03] only to spoil
[1:49:09] Eliza defied popularity
[1:49:13] he was left alone
[1:49:15] but he stood his ground
[1:49:17] now it doesn't say it here but I think
[1:49:18] in in chronicle says that that was a
[1:49:20] barley field
[1:49:22] and I've seen I've heard commentaries
[1:49:24] that oh it wasn't important and
[1:49:25] everything at that time food was very
[1:49:28] important and there were a lot of food
[1:49:30] battles fought at the time of harvest
[1:49:35] and so they're in a battlefield the
[1:49:38] Philistines are coming
[1:49:40] people didn't think it was important
[1:49:42] enough to fight for it
[1:49:44] but for him it was his heritage
[1:49:48] he believed in it and he stood his
[1:49:50] ground
[1:49:51] and because it was that determined he
[1:49:54] fought and for me what I love the best
[1:49:57] is that his hands stuck to the sword
[1:50:01] that is what happened when you go on the
[1:50:04] offense with the word of God
[1:50:07] you get addicted to the word of God he
[1:50:10] sounds stuck to the sword and for me
[1:50:13] this is what I'm saying that the only
[1:50:14] addiction that I approve of is this
[1:50:16] addiction he's so addicted to the word
[1:50:19] that's the only thing that he knows
[1:50:21] and this is our call
[1:50:24] this is our call we have it it's in our
[1:50:26] hand
[1:50:28] yes we saw that the symbolism of it it
[1:50:31] was handed to the prophet it was handed
[1:50:32] to us everything that happened there was
[1:50:35] for our sake
[1:50:36] we are not here because of the Prophet
[1:50:38] The Prophet came because of us
[1:50:43] praise the name of the Lord
[1:50:46] and so this is how it went that he
[1:50:48] fought he went on the offense
[1:50:51] and he got addicted to the word praise
[1:50:53] the name of the Living God
[1:51:00] 11.
[1:51:02] this is the third one of the first three
[1:51:04] now the first three are those that are
[1:51:07] called referred to in Chronicles as the
[1:51:10] mightiest
[1:51:12] and after him was Sharma the son of Iggy
[1:51:16] AJ
[1:51:18] the haral rights and the Philistines
[1:51:20] were gathered together into a troop
[1:51:23] where was a piece of ground full of
[1:51:25] lentils and the people fled from the
[1:51:27] Philistines but he stood in the midst of
[1:51:30] the ground and defended it and still the
[1:51:33] Philistines and the Lord wrote a great
[1:51:35] victory
[1:51:38] so another food battle
[1:51:40] this time's lentils but it's still very
[1:51:43] important and they were going to fight
[1:51:45] over it but the people retreated
[1:51:48] but he stood alone
[1:51:50] he stood against that discouragement
[1:51:52] that comes when you are found alone
[1:51:55] he took a stand for the Lord
[1:51:57] Hallelujah
[1:51:58] now time is for I spent I'll read about
[1:52:01] two or three quotes and we are done but
[1:52:03] I just want to say this the Lord brought
[1:52:06] about a great victories it's repeated
[1:52:09] over and over and this is where I'm
[1:52:11] saying that the people are Avail
[1:52:13] themselves they committed themselves to
[1:52:16] the cause and the Lord brought about the
[1:52:19] victory
[1:52:20] it's not because they were smart they
[1:52:22] were healed they could fight they were
[1:52:23] they had some magical powers no
[1:52:26] it was God in them
[1:52:29] and that is what it is when you commit
[1:52:31] yourself to the cause of the Lord
[1:52:32] Hallelujah
[1:52:34] and so anyway I'll read this
[1:52:38] this is there is a man here that can
[1:52:40] turn on the library says and the list of
[1:52:42] David's thoughts was a command to those
[1:52:44] Gentiles for they a type of the gentle
[1:52:48] Church
[1:52:51] Hallelujah you see where the interest is
[1:52:54] he doesn't just say that a type of the
[1:52:56] gentle church today
[1:53:00] and so brother if God has called you
[1:53:04] he's left these things in the scripture
[1:53:06] for us to go by to know what is expected
[1:53:10] of us and I'm not saying we can do it
[1:53:12] but he has already done it before he can
[1:53:15] do it again in US
[1:53:17] all it takes is for us to yield to this
[1:53:19] word and understand the exclusivity of
[1:53:22] this word
[1:53:27] a type of the general shirt today
[1:53:29] Gallant men see those men who stood by
[1:53:32] David were gentiles
[1:53:34] but Gallant men they were Fearless they
[1:53:37] didn't even know what fear was one man
[1:53:40] took a sword and killed 800 men
[1:53:42] he was a gallant man a gentile looking
[1:53:45] upon anointed one that he knowed was
[1:53:47] coming into Power did you notice them
[1:53:50] being so Gallant to David when David
[1:53:53] finally came in power he made them ruler
[1:53:56] over cities
[1:53:58] didn't Jesus promise the same thing
[1:54:04] Hallelujah
[1:54:07] I'll just read two more quotes and then
[1:54:09] we are done
[1:54:10] oh God the coming of that great King
[1:54:13] Jesus and we realized God had we
[1:54:17] realized God that every one of those men
[1:54:19] that pulled that sword and fought for
[1:54:21] David when he was a fugitive when he
[1:54:23] came into Power he made them rulers
[1:54:25] overseas
[1:54:26] every one of them has cities and you
[1:54:29] promise that in the Bible that we would
[1:54:31] have cities oh God as Gentiles fell air
[1:54:35] through the Gentiles that we might be
[1:54:37] partakers of his Holiness and
[1:54:40] righteousness
[1:54:41] that is not
[1:54:44] it says let us today Lord as men
[1:54:47] Warriors take that word knowing that
[1:54:50] those who stand for him in this hour
[1:54:52] there will be rulers over cities not as
[1:54:54] we want to be rulers but we want to be
[1:54:58] servants to you Lord
[1:55:01] praise the name of the Lord I will
[1:55:03] invite the musicians as I read the last
[1:55:05] quote
[1:55:06] and this is Brother Abraham making a
[1:55:09] call
