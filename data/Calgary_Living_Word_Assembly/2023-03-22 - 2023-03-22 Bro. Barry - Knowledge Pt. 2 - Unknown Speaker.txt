maybe just make it known for an uplift hand as we go to him just have a couple of requests we'd like to remember baby Zoe the Lord would just continue the work in her life heal that hole in the heart just like to remember the risler family the Lyme disease don't you ever need just make it known tonight gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness to each one of us Lord thank you Father that we can approach you tonight according to the word for our day we know that's your only provided place of worship father and we know that that's not a location it's not an association it's not a badge that we can wear a card that we can carry father but that's only in you it's only in you Lord Jesus and we thank you for that position Lord that that place that you've called us to Father each and every one of us tonight we just want to remember the request Lord as we mention them Father baby Zoe we know that she needs a touch from you father the family is depending on you and we just want to unite together according to Sister Marcy's request Lord for the family Lord that you would touch that baby that you would continue Lord healing her in the name of Jesus Christ father we pray tonight for the risler family for the two sons Lord with the Lyme disease we know that you said in your word that you have healed all of our diseases father and we just take you at your word tonight father we don't want to try and do anything ahead of it or or look too far behind it but Lord just take you as the present tense I Am Lord our present tense God in our midst right now father we just want to recognize you tonight we don't want to Lord just invite you here and then Lord not accept you father we want to invite you here Lord we want to wash your feet tonight Lord we want to anoint you tonight father we want to greet you with a kiss Lord we want to make sure that you feel fully welcome here tonight in our midst Lord we don't want to just come to you as a vending machine Lord Jesus with our time of needs Lord and just a bullet point list of needs that we have and we've come and accomplished our duty once again for the week Lord but we want to know you father in an intimate relationship tonight father and we pray that we could just appreciate you Lord Jesus tonight the way that you desire to be appreciated and father if we have ever come here into your midst Lord gather together this way any other way we pray that you would forgive us for it Lord if we've ever stumbled at the flesh if we've ever had ill will if there's ever been grudges Lord forgive us Lord Jesus let us push aside all of the carnality Lord and just welcome you the way that you desire to be father because that way we know that you will speak to us Lord Jesus I can just imagine the way that your disciples were when they knew that you were Jesus when they knew that you were the Lord and the master when they knew that you were the Messiah and the whole world around didn't recognize it how they wanted to protect you Lord how they wanted to lay their lives down how they wanted to be with you every single day every single night Lord Jesus help us father to have that desire in our hearts Lord to recognize that you have come amongst your people again though the world would say it's not the way they expected it father there's a few people that you've ordained to be able to recognize it Lord and it's only by Your Word father we thank you for your goodness to us Lord we thank you for meeting these requests Lord now we ask for each hand that was made known unto you

wherever they are wherever we are father we just want to welcome you tonight we love you and we thank you we ask all these things now in the name above every name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you musicians thank you tonight certainly thankful for the work that the Lord has done in Sister Faye's life as well we uh look forward to seeing her here how she's here God bless you sister Faye as I was talking I didn't even see you it's wonderful how are you feeling wonderful wonderful praise the Lord that's tremendous I guess I should look around when I come up here I apologize um if you have your Bibles tonight sorry to keep you standing I'd like to read from First Peter chapter 3. just one verse tonight I think I've been into this before but I just felt led to go here today for First Peter chapter 3 verse 7. speaking about husbands tonight First Peter chapter 3 verse 7 likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word thank you for the Revelation that you've given us of your word Lord we pray that you would just break the bread of life to us fresh once again Lord that tonight when we leave this building we would say that Lord we're not the same people that we were when we came in that you just took us by the hand father and you spoke to us that you taught taught us tonight father we just ask that we could sit at your feet tonight as our master and that you would just minister to us Lord we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I bless you tonight you may be seated certainly thankful to see you sister Faye my goodness certainly thankful for the good news about Baby John baby Jeremy John or jera Bessa something that we can never take lightly when you see Life come into the world you know brother Branham talks about that how that baby is ordained from God that's a little piece of God that actually is ordained to be put into a body bypassing its theophany and it's that light and and that life that comes into that body where the random talks about the the Angels standing by standing guard for that life to actually pass from the throne into that baby into that flesh it's never ever something that we take lightly when we see a baby come into this world and you know I think that's just a beautiful thing that I I didn't really realize it when when sort of I was I guess a young adult the importance of celebrating a birthday because that's what it is it's the expression of God's own life Zoe God's own life on earth when you have a birth when you you have a birthday it's something to be celebrated so certainly a tremendous thing to see it happen once again we look forward to seeing the ojirabesses in due course you happy tonight I was looking at uh at my notes and it's been a while since I was here on a Wednesday and uh certainly thankful to be back on a Wednesday and hopefully maybe just a bit of a teaching a learning as we go I think that that's kind of what happens for me I I learn lots as I do this and you know I just can't help but talk a little bit about last Wednesday though last Wednesday was certainly a tremendous blessing thank you brother Emanuel that was uh so good it was spiritual food in due season and you know the the idea of there being a famine in the land I don't know if there's ever been a time where there's been such a famine in the land and you know it's not a famine for food because we can go and just head to Costco and buy the choices cuts of Alberta beef AAA Alberta beef if we don't want to do that likely we can just go and maybe stretch our budget a little bit and go to a real fine restaurant and treat ourselves we can go and eat just whatever we want to in this world and uh that's not what the famine is for the feminists for the desire to hear the word of God to hear the person of Jesus Christ because if we can accept the fullness of the word in our day that's truly what we're doing is accepting and welcoming Jesus Christ as we heard about on on Sunday and we certainly wouldn't want to welcome Jesus to invite Jesus to our lives and to our homes and to our service but then have something said where we would have to just full stop hit the brakes and say no I just can't take that if it's according to the word then we're not just rejecting the minister if we do that brothers and sisters I just think it's such a beautiful thing though in the midst of a famine a famine for the hearing of the word of God that we can still have a feast we can still be feasting on that word and you know all of the inspiration that I have will come from the message of the hour and I mean the word of God is the message of the hour so when we look at the Bible the the the prophet the man the only thing that he did was amplify the Bible he tied up the Loose Ends that were in the Bible according to tradition but that's that's the feast that we have in the midst of this famine it's such a beautiful thing and what it's going to do for us is give us rapturing Faith because the Rapture is Faith it takes Faith to have the Rapture it takes Faith to have salvation we can't just go to the store and buy salvation some people would say well you can pay you can pay the church if you pay your tithes enough the right way at the right times you can actually get your salvation but we know that that's the Beast system and it started as a simple discussion and and then it crept into the church unawares and it became a Doctrine and and then it turned into the the horse riders that wound up Galloping through the church throughout the ages and we're not going to go too far into that tonight but you can in some some religions some circles you can certainly buy religion but you can't do that according to the Bible it takes Faith to have salvation and salvation truly is the only covering that we want and that covering is the blood of Jesus Christ according to his word for our day but you know there is a tremendous feast in the midst of this famine for the word of God and we're here just feasting on it tonight I trust that's why we've come so we can feast tonight and you know brother Emanuel said it last week I just have to just amplify these notes because they're so powerful they're so important that God always provides for his own he will always provide a way for his own we heard this story example after example last week about how God always provides for his own the woman with the oil we know Elijah with the birds in even in the midst of the famine he called for I won't go too far into all of that we know the woman that that she came out of her house and and in Samaria and she was just going to go and create the last meal she had two sticks representing the cross brother random said she was just gonna put those sticks together and and cook the last little bit of food they had and that was it they were gonna die because of this famine but she was willing to take the word of God over the natural circumstances in her life and that saved her life if she would have said no I'm not interested in what this man's gonna tell me because to her it was a man right it was a man speaking it wasn't an angel with wings and a halo over his head he didn't even have a pillar of fire for her to see what she saw was a man and you know God always uses men and I think that's what we want to get into tonight to talk about but she took the words of God through the man and saved her life saved her son and we know that the famine ended for her at that moment and it does for everyone spiritually when we're willing to put the word of God ahead of our own thoughts our own thinking even sometimes our own desires one one other thought that brother Emmanuel said this one's kind of for I would say anyone you know you're going to be here if you're going to come here you might as well have a good time otherwise why do you come why would you come to church if you're not going to have a good time I I just thought that was so good you know there's things that we need to be conscious of we need to know we need to be aware of and I just think it Blends so good with what we want to talk about tonight you know but we need to be teaching sound Doctrine and and you know people were given to fables that's what the word of God says if we're not careful we will be given over to fables we'll we'll take the word of God and make it something we could even take the message of the hour and make it a fable and how would we do that brother Barry I would say this we could make the stories about the prophet more important than the message that the prophet brought brought we could say that you know the the the storm mountain or or any of the different stories that happens if that becomes our focus and we don't actually follow what the message is that he taught then we're gonna miss the truth and we can actually be given over to a fable we can be given over to something that's not sound Doctrine and we need to be very careful because the devil doesn't care how religious we get in fact the devil would like us if we got real religious if we got way more religious than we need to be but I've heard it said probably said it before that we can become so Heavenly minded that we become no earthly good well I could sit at home and read the Bible all day and come up with all kinds of different quotes and not go out and provide a living for my family I'm worse than an infidel we've got to be able to provide for our family and we know brother Barry you've got to be able to provide for your family spiritually you surely do but your children don't understand no milk in the fridge the children don't understand when you don't have bread in the cupboard the children have got to eat and there's only one person that's responsible for that it's not Mama's responsibility it's Daddy's responsibility he's the one responsible for the natural food and the spiritual food to prove that there isn't a famine in the land naturally or spiritually because we heard it said last week and I said it already that God always provides a way for his own always sometimes it's not exactly the way we would want sometimes we can't go out and just get that big fat steak the way we would like it sometimes we have to eat little peanut butter and jam on bread or brown beans by the canful sometimes that's the way life is and it's important to never take it for granted if God has truly blessed us the last note from last week that I want to say there's one truth in the midst of a million Fables so many fables in this life and and Satan loves it when we get all caught up in all the different things but anyways I just really enjoyed that last week I've really been enjoying hearing the ministry um sort of taking every other week and just being able to see what the Lord has on each other's Hearts you know it really does something for the body I believe so God bless you brethren for bringing of your sacred portion I know it's not easy when you're working when you're employed and uh still bringing of your your time and your energy it's a wonderful thing so the last time that we got together I just I just talked about a little bit about knowledge and I'm just gonna do a quick recap and then sort of push forwards a little bit um we talked about knowledge uh out of the church age book of of the word coming from Smyrna meaning bitter it didn't come from Smyrna but the church age Smyrna was was all about knowledge being derived from the word myrrh myrrh was used in embalming the Dead Brother Adam says thus we have a two-folded significance found in the name of this age it was a bitter age filled with death the two Vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine on the part of the false death was not only the seed of the false Vine but even in the True Vine there was a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after Pentecost this is the kind of the key that I wanted to to get to speaking about knowledge brother Branham says and no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God and what is the pure word of God in our day it's the word of the message of the hour the seventh angel message it's not the seventh angel messenger it's the seventh angel message and the seventh angel message pointed to Christ that's what the seventh angel message is it is Christ for the problem goes on to see as seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament organization was growing a pace confirming and augmenting the death of the membership for the Holy Ghost leadership was deposed and the Word was replaced by Creeds dogmas and man-made ritual in the message of the hour in the church age book brother Branham talks about I think it's an Ephesian Church age he says you know what they did where they got wrong was they actually said quick now that we've got this tremendous work of the of God Mighty wonders and works we need to quickly get around it and Surround it and protect it we need to protect this word and and doing so what you do is you put a period at the end of the sentence and you stop the Holy Ghost right there there's no protection needed for the word of God he will protect his own word just like we don't need to bring it to pass he vindicates his own word by bringing it to pass himself the only thing we need to do is follow his word and we know that Paul said even if an angel come and preach any other gospel any other gospel let him be accursed just wait a second let me say it again he says if any Angel even an angel from heaven comes and preaches any other gospel than what we've already preached let him be accursed how important it is for us to remain with the pure word for our day last week or last time we talked about a scripture in Jeremiah and I think it's it's wonderful for me it was astounding actually because we talked about all the times in Jeremiah that he talks about pastors and every single time except for one he talks about pastors they're not good people they're bad people and the reason for that is they've strayed from the pure word they would not listen to the word of God and where was the word of God in the days of Jeremiah it was in the mouth of the prophets he's the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change he's as immutable in his nature as he is in his ways but we know that time time passes by and Satan gets in through Creeds and dogmas and traditions and gets people to start to hear another idea and think another thought and then another tradition gets handed down and it's ever slight and and so so subtle if you've ever studied erosion sometimes it's really significant and fantastic but most of the time erosion is very very slow so slow I'm certainly not an expert in it but just to bring the points this is totally off off the main road here but have you ever look at stalactites and stalagmites I think I said those right they're they're calcium and and mineral deposits deposited from drips of water sometimes we'll see icicles where we live here and the ice the water starts to run and it freezes and it runs it melts it drips and it freezes and it creates an icicle but it you know when that happens over a period of time maybe a few days you'll see an icicle here with the temperature and water but when you look at minerals and how they will actually create a mineral deposit that's a rock it's a stone how does that happen it's so subtle it's so slow the process is very very little almost microscopic and it will just grow and grow and grow and it can happen that way so subtle you won't hear a sound you might hear a little tiny drip maybe but maybe not maybe the water will just evaporate at the end of it just like water will freeze on an icicle but yet that deposit is still there and the same thing happens with the word of God if we don't keep it exactly true if we just allow something to get in just a little deviation before long we have a deposit and it starts to grow and grow and grow I remember we talked about it before if you don't weed your garden and get them when they're small they grow into big nasty things we did it last year and we had a garden Full Of Weeds and our food but we had to go in and do the harder work and pull out the big bushes and save the food but if we would have just got after it when they were tiny and small if I would have it probably would have been real easy this year we get a redo it's going to be different this year is going to be different but talking about Jeremiah and that one scripture in Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15 and I will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding I think it's astounding because he doesn't say revelation it's not Revelation the pastor is not going to give you Revelation just like we read in First Peter chapter chapter 3 verse 7 likewise he husbands dwell with them according to knowledge not revelation so there has to be instructions somewhere along the way there has to be teaching there has to be learning there has to be understanding and I would say the understanding comes through Revelation according to the word otherwise how else could a woman in this age submit to her husband how else could a husband not get bitter towards his wife we have to follow the word and when we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we have the ability to do that but Jeremiah is talking about a pastor and I will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding and we know that brother Branham says every scripture has a compound meaning and Revelation so this scripture it applies to the children of Israel that there will be truth among the false I know that was the actual snapshot that was the the moment that the scripture was written under inspiration but it also applies to another people it also applies to a different time and age because the word of God is Everlasting I will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding moving on brother Branham says in the in the church age book to never let anything get between you and that word never let anything get between you and that word I think that's so important those words are vital because we could easily let something get between us and that word I know I've had times in my life where I get really upset with someone who is a Believer really upset with someone who is a Believer I feel like they stepped right on my toes they they kicked me they spit on me I've been done wrong and I know I've been done wrong and this the devil's right there say and see look what they did to you are they really Believers is there any truth to it might as well forget it you know you know where your friends are you could just come and and dine you could just come and do everything that you used you know you just start down that road no I don't think so but Satan's always there trying to get us to let something get between us and that word and that's why I think it's so important if we have the the teaching according to knowledge and understanding about the word and our position according to the word and the message of the hour it can help us it can give us something to actually think about when these times come up in our lives maybe in our marriages maybe in our relationships with friends maybe with our relationships at school or at work with employers it can actually help us and don't get me wrong I'm not trying to go down a psychological Road psychology isn't going to help us the word of God will help us the spirit of Jesus Christ will help us but you know I've heard it said and I I think it's true there's a lot of times in our lives that we do have natural problems that will spiritualize and and by spiritualizing it it's a trick of the devil to get us to miss what the actual treatment for our problem is it can be a whole lot simpler than maybe what we think it is and sometimes when we have a problem in our lives the devil will come around and say oh it's this great big thing over here look at this great big thing over here when it's actually nothing maybe you just pulled a muscle or something but Satan's gonna say oh no you've got cancer you've got something tremendous we heard brother Cadre say it he had a sweet tea and went in to have his eyes checked at one time and the doctor said no you've got you you've got diabetes I mean no what he said it was a trap right if he would have said oh do I then perhaps he could have opened the door to get it didn't mean he would get it the doctor can't put nothing on you but what's our mental attitude anyways brother Bradham says never let anything get between you and the word in the church age book he says I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that I think it's so beautiful the way he's wrote this because some people would say well this is Brother Branham now he's making himself God no no this is the Holy Ghost speaking to you brother Branham this is Anointed words to The Bride of Jesus Christ to he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church then he goes on to say I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst he says let me give you a thought here and this is where I left off last week and so this is where I'm going to pick up this week let me give you a thought here brother Branham says to me I think that's just beautiful but before we get there we'll just talk about a couple other things you know this this the scripture we read in First Peter chapter 3 verse 7 dwell with them according to knowledge it's not talking about Revelation it's knowledge so it's something that we've learned somewhere along the way someone had to instruct us or teach us this we needed to understand this otherwise why would it even be written why would we see it in the scripture in First Peter chapter three why would it say verse one likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands there has to be an instruction there has to be a teaching there has to be an understanding and a learning and then we can thereby live it but if we don't hear it if we don't get taught then how will we ever understand it I think it's just a wonderful thing but I said it earlier sometimes we can over spiritualize things and and make it maybe different than what it actually is and and I think it's beautiful I was thinking about it today just meditating on it and some might call it super spiritual and you know what it it might be or maybe it's just over spiritualized but you know um either way we need to remember that Jesus is the word we just need to remember also that we don't want to be so Heavenly minded that we're not worthy good we have to find that balance and through the Holy Ghost In Our Lives he's going to give us the ability to do that we're going to be able to be a husband to our wives and and a mother to our children and a wife to our husband and a brother to our sister and and and husbands will be able to dwell with our wives without getting a root of bitterness in our lives because that's what the word says I keep saying that I know but it's just what the word says and I I don't know why I keep saying it but maybe someone has a root of bitterness I don't know if you do the word says that you could it's not abnormal to get it but you got to get it out you can't have a root of bitterness if you do that it's going to go deep and it's going to go far we were talking about different kinds of roots Isaac is studying trees plants in school and we're helping them study and to talk about the different types of roots sometimes they'll just go underneath the surface just a little bit below the surface but they'll travel a long ways man and other ones will just go straight down and real deep but they won't grow they won't see the tree or plant grow it'll just have a tremendous root underneath the surface and to try and get it out it can stay there man you won't be able to get it out of there we got to be careful there is a root of bitterness we can have it towards a wife we can have it towards a brother or sister we can have a root of bitterness towards our parents we don't want to have a root of bitterness if it gets in there you got to get rid of it you got to get it out and the word gives us the ability to do that and I so appreciate that and I just want to say this brothers and sisters if I ever say anything to you from the pulpit and it it it feels like I'm stepping on your toes or maybe I upset you there's a way to deal with that don't let it turn into a root of bitterness I'm a human and I know that I will make mistakes I'll fall down flat on my face and and you know what I'm sorry I'll say that I apologize I don't want to make excuses I just want to say I'm sorry and you know what the word of God gives us an Avenue for that if it happens come and talk to me I will not dismiss you and say I'm better than you I hold an office that's that's that's totally opposite if if there's a root of bitterness developing between anyone the word of God gives us the solution for that and that's to go to your brother go to your sister nip it in the bud so to speak get that root before it actually takes root because if it takes root you might never be able to get rid of it brothers and sisters it might be with you your whole life that might turn into the thorn in your flesh and sometimes that can be really terrible but sometimes we can be super spiritual or over spiritualized things either way we need to remember that Jesus is the word for our day that's the word that we're talking about is Jesus Christ says don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word he says remember that he also says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray how do we pray he says and I just can't help but think you know this just it goes so good with what we talked about on Sunday how do we pray brothers and sisters do we just pray we had a brother share that quote from from that message that we talked about Pride the brother Branham talked about he said you know how are we praying do we get in the spirit when we pray talks about it in the church age book do we get in the spirit we can get in the spirit for a ball game and we can get in the spirit for all these other things but do we truly get in the spirit if we don't get in the spirit God's not even going to be hearing us we're just going to be hearing ourselves talk we're going to be saying a prayer and brother Brad I'm in that message he says I wish that we would just let loose that we would just stop trying to pray and just pray and actually just speak to God let him speak through us to him that's the only way we're going to reach him is to allow him to speak to him and you know I'm getting ahead of myself but in the it is the rising of the sun it's the word to the word brothers and sisters that's what we're talking about today that's the message of the hour today it's the word to the word it's not us to the word it's not us and the word it's the word Jesus Christ himself in our lives and boy when he starts to pray I guarantee you brothers and sisters if you've never broken through you've never seen that experience it will be Earth shattering for you if you have never prayed to the point where you have been able to break through it's like breaking through the sound barrier with a jet and it makes no sound but what will happen is you'll find that maybe you're almost feeling like you're not even in your body and someone else is speaking if you've never experienced it I highly recommend it and I trust that everyone here has heard it and experienced it and we can just move on but I just feel we had to get here tonight brother around him he says it let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer it's only in the name of Jesus Christ we remember this story brother Bonham told not making it a fable going back on what I said but just to demonstrate the power how they were one time levitating a table and brother Branham said you want to challenge me in the name of Jesus and in the doctrine of water baptism okay let's talk about it then let's throw that table down in the name of the father let's throw that table down in the name of the son they were levitating a table this was demonic let's let's let's smash that table down in the name of the Holy Ghost and nothing happened but then what did he do he said in the name of Jesus Christ and that table smashed to the floor there's only one thing that has the power in this universe and that is the name of Jesus Christ because we know Jesus Christ is not a second person or a third person in the Trinity of God he is the person he is God himself how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer he says yet in first John 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him now we ask what is the will of God I think I talked about this a while ago it's such an important thing for us to understand according to knowledge what is the will of God as a husband what is the will of God as a wife what is the will of God as a son or a daughter the will of God is his word brother Branham says now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God so there has to be a teaching there's got to be instruction and how can they instruct if someone doesn't actually speak that word of God you know brothers and sisters we're living not in the first pull age we're not living in a second full age we're living in a third pole age and that's a a different word a different way to say it but we're living in the age of the third poll we're living in the dispensation of all of the ages the bride age we're we're moving into a different place into a different cycle and it is truly the word of God and what makes this word of God live brothers and sisters is when it's on our lips we can think it all we want we can think the name of Jesus Christ all we want but if we don't speak the name of Jesus is there power does he hear our prayers Lamentations 3 37 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not brother Branham says there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it I think it's so easy it's so simple it's so beautiful if it ain't in the word of God you can't have it it makes it real clear makes it real easy it's cut and dried right it's right or wrong it's one or zero it's either or there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name but I want to say brothers and sisters boy oh boy if we actually understand according to knowledge if we have been instructed if we have been taught according to the word for our day the message of the hour then when we do ask if it's in Jesus name then we have full Authority and power because we're not doing it at that point we say Lord according to your word just like a child would say but Daddy remember you said remember you said you would do this I remember brother Ken teaching it there's nothing sweeter for the Lord to hear than his word on our lips repeating his word back to him when we can do that brothers and sisters in prayer boy that's where it becomes omnipotent because when we're speaking his word back to him we're not even speaking it's him speaking it's the word to the word again it's so beautiful brother Bradham says there it is if it if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word will you can't separate God in the word they are one I hope this is helping somehow tonight I just think it's so beautiful the way brother Branham says it you cannot separate Jesus and the word Jesus the name is the word will you can't separate God in the word they are one that's out of the exposition of the seven Church ages the pergamian church age turn over with me to John Saint John chapter 1. just for a little further discussion about the word I think it's such a an amazing thought here we'll just read from verse 1. of Saint John chapter 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the word sorry the word was with God and the Word was God we know many times people will take that scripture verse 1 and and put it together with verse 14 the first half of verse 14. we're just going to read it all tonight there's a lot in between there verse 2 says the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name I just think these next couple verses are so beautiful verse 13 which were not born which were born sorry not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God born again verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and Truth I just think that it's a an amazing thing here just to look at a couple of scriptures in here but just to give the the whole sort of spectrum of this thought that that God came in a man so that he could actually Bear witness of himself God came in word form exactly according to what the prophecy in Isaiah was the people were looking for something different to happen sure they believed that the diversion was going to see conceive but it would have to be a different virgin it couldn't be that one it would have to be some way but it would be a different way they they couldn't understand how anything could come out of Nazareth that that it was supposed to be out of Bethlehem they they wouldn't believe that he came in a stable they wouldn't believe that he he would be born the way that he was born at all they said that he was actually fathered by a Roman soldier some ridiculous thing like that but here we have John saying that you know what in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God just explains it so clearly here that this was not just a man this was God but how was he revealed to the world nobody knew who he was his mom knew that he had a fantastic life and his aunt and and uncle they knew something was special about him because they knew that their baby left to life their baby was a stillborn baby according to what the prophet of God said but at the salutation of the word Jesus he left in the womb and we know the word of God says he was given the holy ghost at that moment he had the Holy Ghost in his womb that's what gave him the life he was no longer a stillborn baby but here we have a man that was sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe now we're talking about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he chooses men to reveal the word for their day he doesn't send an angel with a a trumpet and a and a big Heavenly Host to reveal the the word for the age he uses a man verse 7 says the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe I think it's so important so beautiful to look at verse 8. he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light he was not that light and we could say the same thing about William Mary and Branham he was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of that light and what was John bearing witness of he was bearing witness of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever today the whole world is looking for a manifestation of Jesus but we know the word of God says that we're going to meet him in the air we're not going to meet him on the ground he's come on the ground but what they're looking for is not what they're going to find if they see Jesus the way they want to they're actually going to see him in Revelations chapter 19. but anyways what we're talking about is a man was sent to Bear witness of the light but he was not that light and we know they came and they grilled him and said who are you what what are you doing you know are you a prophet are you the Messiah are you the one what are you doing and he said I'm just simply bearing witness of that light I am a voice crying in the wilderness I'm just one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord and we know that he was forerunning the first coming of the Lord and we have a John bearing witness in our day not John the Baptist an anointing an anointing of a man that was sent to Bear witness of the light even though he wasn't the light verse 9 says that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him this is where it gets real good this is where it turns into I believe scripture for us brothers and sisters as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were not born they were born but not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God something happened to them when they heard that name Jesus something left in their womb something changed the way they saw everything where I'm getting with all of this tonight brothers and sisters the only thing that's going to do us any good is the pure word and whether we want to exercise it in our homes as a husband or or live by it as a wife the only thing that's going to do it is the word of God and we need to speak the word of God we need to be willing to teach the word of God we need to be willing to be taught the word of God if we can't do all of that together then somehow some way we're not going to get the word of God people have to bear witness of this word and the only way we can bear witness of it is to speak it sure our lives bear witness of it we'll do business transactions that are good they're beneficial for everyone we won't take the upper hand and say I'm I'm going to score big on this business transaction nobody will know about it the believer is going to say no I can't just win big every time I can't just actually see someone lose and I win the the believer is going to say no no everyone's going to win we're not going to do any dirty deals we're going to make sure that everything is above board and everybody wins we're going to treat people right our lives are going to Bear witness but then there's coming a time where we'll have to speak the word of God God uses men to bring light into this world and we talked about this a while ago about how this light we talked about in the Gospel of John in the beginning God said let there be light out of Genesis that light it wasn't light from the sun it wasn't the light that we would consciously think about like somebody turn on a light switch and there was light the darkness scattered because there was light what he was saying was let there be life that's where he poured himself out from being Elohim into being from the self-existing one into actually being God where he could be worshiped that's what happened with that light and that's the light we're talking about here in John God uses man to bring the light and it's no different for us today when we take this word and put it on our lips when we take this word and put it into our hearts we bear record we bear witness of this light too and and as we bear witness of this light and this life what we do is we actually instruct by knowledge we actually teach because we're not living a life according to our own will according to our own means according given to our own Traditions what we do is we always when we're talking about this pure light this Pure Life this pure word if we're not letting anything get between us in this word like brother Bradham said what happens is we always humble ourselves to this word always always otherwise it's another Spirit brothers and sisters I don't mean to say it that sharply but we need to it's true only the Holy Ghost will humble oneself to the word of God any other thing any other action is another spirit brother Adam says it many times you know you might have a spirit he says I don't doubt that but it might not be the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit Bears record of itself he speaks of himself he lives out through himself he Bears record according to this word that John talked about here he he he he he lives according to this word doesn't give us Liberty to live above this word nobody lives above the ministry of the Prophet for their day and we certainly don't want to live below that because it's a privilege to understand who we are John was sent to Bear witness of that light but he was not that light I just couldn't help but think about this how the name Christopher it means light bearer you're not sleeping Christopher it means light bearer Christ Bearer it's a beautiful thing brother getting into our scripture tonight I apologize for the I guess the long way home but verse 7 of First Peter chapter 3 likewise he husbands dwelling with them according to knowledge knowledge strongs g5029 T May actually I got this wrong I apologize bear with me I just mixed them up [Music] pause there we go G 1108 knowledge out of Strong's gnosis is knowing the ACT that is by implication knowledge knowledge science learning my words learning understanding being taught being willing to be taught understanding that there has to be an understanding knowledge is the act that is by implication knowledge you know the Amplified Bible this this verse here in the same way you married men should live considerately with your wives with an intelligent recognition of the marriage relation honoring the woman as physically the weaker but realizing that you are joint Heirs of the grace God's unmerited favor of life in order that your prayers may not be hindered and cut off otherwise you cannot pray effectively this is out of the Amplified Bible but getting back to what I wanted to talk about here likewise he husbands dwell with them according to knowledge understanding that we need to be taught there needs to be an instruction about this it's not just something that we're making up here and I'll tell you why I'm going this way with it the reason I'm going this way you probably wondering brother Barry why are you talking about this so much simply because I feel challenged about it I feel like maybe I'm going a long ways the wrong way but I I don't think so I truly believe that we need to be instructed we need to have instruction the word of God here says not here but in in Titus Chapter 2 that the Elder women need to instruct the younger women and we know that that's actually happening and it's such a a wonderful thing because it's a scriptural thing it's not a berry thing it's not a Calgary Living Word thing it's it's according to the word of God it's instructing we need to do it with our children parents need to instruct our children parents if we don't instruct our children someone will someone will if we don't teach our children about drugs someone's going to teach them about drugs is it going to be the right person we need to make sure that we're giving them the instruction the same thing can be said for alcohol same thing could be said for many different things but as parents it's our responsibility it's our duty to make sure that we teach that we instruct the word of God says train them up in the way they would go how do you do that you have to teach them train them up in the way they would go I'm sorry I'm not trying to get on a soapbox here and say that I think I'm doing something right even though I feel challenged I just I know that Satan doesn't like it I know that Satan doesn't want families to be healthy Satan doesn't want parents instructing Satan doesn't want husbands living according to the word of God he doesn't want wives obeying their husbands he doesn't want husbands loving their wives Satan doesn't want no part of that he wants children to disobey their parents that's the age that we live in but you know this verse here likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel I looked up that word honor g5092 that's what I I read earlier teammate is what that word is out of Strong's Concordance a value that is Money Paid or concretely and and collectively valuables maybe some folks pay a dowry for their wives so that would apply right there I believe but it goes on to say by analogy esteem especially of the highest degree brother Branham says that if God could give you anything better outside of Salvation than he would but he gives you your wife your wife is the greatest thing outside of your salvation even above healing Brothers even above healing the greatest thing that we could be given is a wife outside of our salvation by God an analogy by analogy esteem especially of the highest degree or the dignity itself honor precious price some I don't understand some of the words but I just think it kind of gets the point across there that the the wife is the most valuable thing the esteemed to be the highest outside of the word of God in our homes and we know that Satan has taken it and completely flipped it upside down the the order of operations the way that things should go what Satan has done in this world is he has taken the father and made him to look like a fool and and put him at the bottom of the totem pole and below the father is Christ to look even more foolish like a fable there's children that have no idea today who Jesus is no different than the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus it's just some other Fable some other thing that's happening in the world they don't even understand what Easter truly means what we're heading into but you know brothers and sisters there's a group of people that do understand it they recognize it it's become more Vivid now than it ever has been what that bumper of blood truly means to the believer that those people who are willing not just willing but able to believe on his name to believe on the word of Jesus Christ to them they have been given the ability to become the sons of God that is unbelievable it's incredible because now we can take this brothers and sisters like we always do when we get into these discussions and look at it from the perspective of the Lord likewise ye husband the Lord well with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife the Bride As the weaker vessel giving honor unto her to recognize that according to this instruction to this knowledge you are The Virtuous sinless spotless Bride of the Jesus Christ that that that you never did it in the first place it's not as though you never did it you actually never did it when you have the ability to receive the word of God for your day because when you receive the word of God for your day you're not just receiving a a book that says voice of God Recordings you're not just getting an app on your phone and saying I believe that God sent a prophet what you're doing is actually getting the holy ghost in your life that's what it is when you're receiving the word of God you could pick up the Bible and say well I received the word of God but remember the eunuch he received the word of God in his day he was reading it and trying to understand it how could I understand this word of God but remember God sent a prophet he picked him up and time traveled him and said you need to go over here and he left what he was doing going to go and Minister the word of God and we know that he said hey I receive this in its fullness what forbids us hey there's some water right over there why don't we just go and get baptized why don't we just get her done according to the word of God the outward expression of the inward work and what happened we know that he received the word for his day and that's when he was translated our brother he went right back to work again to the other side of the country but you know when we look at this scripture here likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel giving honor unto her recognizing that you she's esteemed above everything else think about the way our lord Jesus thinks about us brothers and sisters your esteemed tonight above everything else there's all kinds of different things that he's got on his mind right now at this very moment even but you know what brothers and sisters he's right here in our midst and he's thinking about you he's thinking about your need and he knows what's on your heart he knows what's in your thoughts he knows what's in your mind and if you have a need you can make it known unto him you can speak it in your heart to him I just think it's so beautiful when we recognize it because it is exactly the way he wants it to be he wants to be a husband he wants to be a father he wants to have a bride of his own choosing that's one of the threefold purpose of of the whole entire Plan of Redemption I'll call the musicians tonight so I don't keep us here but you know we're looking at ourselves tonight as the Bride of Jesus Christ shifting from bride position to wife position with our husband and as we do that brothers and sisters when you speak it's not you speaking when we speak it's not us speaking it's truly the Lord Jesus Christ speaking himself his word through us I just think this Amplified Bible I'm going to read it again here as we stand tonight and uh and we'll close but out of the Amplified Bible this verse 7 out of First Peter chapter 3 in the same way you married men should live considerately with your wives with an intelligent recognition of the marriage relation an intelligent recognition and understanding a comprehension of the magnitude of the position that we're in as husbands and I would say of the magnitude of position that he is in as our husband it's a beautiful thing brothers and sisters with an intelligent recognition of the marriage relation honoring the woman as physically the weaker but realizing that you are joint Heirs of the grace of God's unmerited favor and we know that brother Branham taught it very clearly that his unmerited favor is Grace his grace unmerited favor are our wedding band of unmerited Grace that truly you are the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ and we will never ever be able to give ourselves over to fables we'll never be able to give ourselves over to anything other than the pure unadulterated word of God let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus tonight we thank you for your goodness thank you for your word thank you that Lord Jesus as the sands of time would change and erode and Satan would get in and try and mix things up and muddy the waters father you will never leave your bride you'll never leave your anointed father unattended father you always have a provision for your people even in the midst of a Great Famine in the land father for the hearing of the word of God they're still people that have a desire to hear the word and we know that lord they're not left without a word you sent a word father you gave us a word in the day in which we live and we thank you for it Lord we accept it the way that you've given it to us we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst Lord Jesus father tonight we thank you for speaking to us along the way Lord I pray that the words that were spoken father would just encourage us a little more that we would recognize that truly we do need to be instructed according to your word though not according to man's ideas but according to your word and we thank you for that Lord father we pray that you would just be with those who are traveling Lord that you would be with Andrew and and Grace brother Andrew and sister Grace father that you would just give them traveling mercies Lord that you would restore their strength father while they're in Japan Lord we pray that they would be able to

be traveling to BC and we pray that you would just keep your hand upon her Lord Jesus we thank you for watching over her all along the way Lord Jesus we pray that you would just strengthen her and encourage her father as she goes and Lord that you would just bring her home safely again at the appointed time as well father if there's anyone else who is traveling tonight we pray that you would just be with them that you would bring them home safely again at the appointed time as well father Lord we ask that you would just keep your hand upon us now as we go our separate ways that father you would help us in our families Lord in our marriages and our relationships father in our lives Lord Jesus that we would be able to Bear witness also that life that light Lord Jesus that you sent unto
