[11:13] Amen. Brother Paul, if I could ask you
[11:16] to open the church in prayer.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; I believe our God loves to hear songs
[11:22] like this.
[11:25] Declaration songs. Amen.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:30] [Music]
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, once again, we're
[11:36] so thankful, Lord, to come into your
[11:38] presence. Lord, Father, we're always
[11:40] reminded of your word that says where
[11:42] two or three would gather in your name,
[11:44] there you'd be in the midst. Father, as
[11:46] we think about all of these licks of
[11:48] fire here tonight, Lord, all of us have
[11:51] one desire, Lord, just to serve you, to
[11:53] please you, to worship you, Lord. May
[11:55] you as our husband just receive the
[11:57] worship that we are bringing here
[11:58] tonight. You know, every heart, Lord,
[12:01] every need, every situation, Father, all
[12:03] of us going through something of some
[12:05] sort, Lord, the enemy certainly is
[12:07] raging. But oh God, greater is he that
[12:10] is in me than he that is in the world.
[12:12] Lord, we are more than conquerors
[12:13] through him that loved us. Lord, these
[12:15] are our promises that we hold on to
[12:17] tonight. Lord, we just ask you, God,
[12:19] that you would take this service into
[12:21] your hands. Every aspect, Lord, we're
[12:23] here to become more like Christ. Oh God,
[12:25] from the hearing of your word, that soul
[12:28] in us knows exactly what to do with that
[12:30] word. It feeds on it. It pushes out more
[12:33] life of Christ in us. Lord, help us to
[12:35] surrender just that much more tonight
[12:37] that we might receive your portion.
[12:39] Grant these mercies. Bless every person,
[12:41] Lord. The effort they made to come out,
[12:43] you know, the difficulties on a
[12:44] Wednesday night, but Lord, there's
[12:46] always such a blessing, and we thank you
[12:48] for that, Lord. Bless our pastors. He
[12:49] brings the word. He's labored, Lord. We
[12:52] we've we've held him in our hearts
[12:53] through the day, Lord, in prayer. Lord,
[12:56] what could happen on a simple Wednesday
[12:58] night, Lord?
[13:00] &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes on the scene,
[13:02] &gt;&gt; he keeps all of his appointments, Lord,
[13:04] you keep every single one. And we invite
[13:06] you. We invite you. We invite you with a
[13:09] kiss. We wash your feet with our tears.
[13:12] Lord, we embrace you. We hug you to our
[13:14] chest. We ask you to hug us, Lord, up
[13:16] against you tonight, Lord. May as a as a
[13:18] bride, we just we just rest in the hands
[13:22] and arms of our bridegroom tonight.
[13:23] Receive our worship now. We pray in
[13:25] everything that we do. May you be
[13:26] pleased and honored. In Jesus precious
[13:28] name we ask these mercies. Amen.
[13:36] You may have your seats.
[13:39] You know, I was thinking on the way
[13:40] here, what a privilege it is for us to
[13:43] worship the one who created all. Amen.
[13:45] And our God desires worship so much that
[13:48] he would create us to worship him. He
[13:50] desires worship so much that he said if
[13:52] we don't worship the rocks will cry out.
[13:54] And I thought a thought where it's
[13:57] impossible not to be in the will of God
[13:58] if you don't worship. Amen. When you
[14:00] worship him, you have to be in the will
[14:02] of God. Amen. Such a wonderful thought.
[14:04] What a privilege we have as people.
[14:06] Amen.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:09] I must tell Jesus
[14:15] all of my trials.

[31:15] &gt;&gt; If you have a need tonight, maybe just
[31:17] make it known unto him by way of an
[31:19] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer
[31:20] once again.
[31:23] Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[31:25] what an honor and a privilege it is to
[31:27] be able to praise you, Father.
[31:30] Lord Jesus, to gather together in your
[31:32] name, just give you praise and honor and
[31:35] glory.
[31:36] Father, we know that's the reason you
[31:38] created us, Lord Jesus, is to give you
[31:41] worship and to give you praise. You are
[31:43] God. You are you are desirous of
[31:46] worship. That's the reason that we're
[31:48] here, Father, is to give you praise and
[31:50] honor and glory. And tonight, Father, we
[31:52] just desire that we could do that with
[31:54] all of our hearts, Lord. And if we've
[31:56] ever made it anything other than that,
[31:59] we pray that you would forgive us for
[32:00] it, Lord. Lord Jesus, that we could just
[32:03] have pure hearts before you tonight,
[32:05] Lord. That we could come before your
[32:07] throne one more time with confidence,
[32:09] Lord, knowing that you hear our prayers.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to thank you for
[32:15] all that you do for us, Lord. As we come
[32:18] out of the Thanksgiving season, Lord
[32:20] Jesus, Father, we're so thankful for all
[32:23] of the goodness that you have provided
[32:25] for us in our lives, Lord. Father, we
[32:27] know there's many financial blessings,
[32:29] but that's the that's the smallest part,
[32:31] Lord, of what you've done for us. Oh,
[32:34] Father, to have health in our bodies,
[32:36] Lord Jesus, to have the desire to
[32:38] worship you,
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, to know that we have gifts in our
[32:42] midst, in our lives. But, oh, Father, we
[32:45] have the giver. And we thank you for
[32:47] that, Lord Jesus. Tonight, Father, we
[32:50] just want to commit each need that was
[32:52] made known unto you by the wave and
[32:53] uplift hand, Father, that you would meet
[32:56] the need sovereignly, Father, in each
[32:58] life. Lord,
[33:00] &gt;&gt; and we'll be careful to give you the
[33:01] praise, Lord. And Father, one more time,
[33:04] we just want to unite together as a
[33:06] body, Father, for those people that are
[33:08] held hostages, Lord, taken against their
[33:10] will, Father, we know that you're
[33:13] watching over them, and we thank you for
[33:15] that, Lord. And we just ask that you
[33:17] would continue watching over them until
[33:19] the day they can be freed once again.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; And again, we'll give you the praise.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Now, Father, as we turn to the word, we
[33:26] pray that you would just lead us and
[33:28] guide us, Father. Lord, we don't want to
[33:30] do this on our own. It has to be the
[33:33] moving of your spirit in our midst,
[33:35] Lord. And as our brother already prayed,
[33:37] we know you're here. So, we thank you
[33:39] for that, Lord. And help us, Lord Jesus,
[33:41] to warmly welcome you in your word
[33:44] tonight, Father. that we would receive
[33:46] it with open hearts, Lord.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Father, we just love you and we thank
[33:50] you. We commit this service into your
[33:52] hands now and all the prayers that we've
[33:55] prayed, Father. In Jesus Christ's name
[33:57] we pray. Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:01] Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[34:04] Certainly good to be back in the house
[34:05] of the Lord again on Wednesday.
[34:10] As our uh brother Paul mentioned,
[34:12] there's so many Wednesday blessings that
[34:15] happen.
[34:17] If you have your Bibles tonight, I would
[34:19] like to read from 1 Corinthians chapter
[34:21] 12. Continue on in our discussion about
[34:25] spiritual gifts.
[34:28] As you turn there tonight, just a few
[34:29] announcements. We've got the youth event
[34:31] this Sunday after service at our house.
[34:35] And we have a communion service on the
[34:36] 26th.
[34:38] And we have the youth service on the
[34:41] 31st, which is uh just a wonderful time.
[34:46] We have brother Cadre Diggs coming in on
[34:48] November the 22nd. Uh he'll begin on the
[34:51] 21st, but we'll have a service on the
[34:53] 22nd at 6 PM and then a regular Sunday
[34:56] service on uh the 23rd at 10:00 a.m.
[35:02] 1 Corinthians chapter 12,
[35:07] start with verse 1. Now concerning
[35:10] spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not
[35:12] have you ignorant.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Such a beautiful thing.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul the Apostle saying this to
[35:18] the Corinthian church, but we know for
[35:21] sure that it was truly the Lord, the
[35:23] spirit behind that penmanship. This is
[35:26] the spirit of the Lord saying, "I would
[35:29] not have you ignorant about spiritual
[35:32] gifts."
[35:33] &gt;&gt; That's why I think it's so beautiful and
[35:35] we can study him. He goes on to say in
[35:37] verse two, "Ye know that ye were
[35:39] Gentiles carried away unto these dumb
[35:42] idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I
[35:46] give you to understand that no man
[35:48] speaking by the spirit of God calleth
[35:51] Jesus a cursed
[35:54] and that no man can say that Jesus is
[35:56] the Lord but by the Holy Ghost.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Now there are diversities of gifts but
[36:03] the same spirit and there are
[36:05] differences of administrations
[36:08] &gt;&gt; but the same Lord.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there are diversities of
[36:12] operations,
[36:14] but it is the same God which workketh
[36:17] all in all.
[36:19] But the manifestation of the Spirit is
[36:21] given to every man to profit with all.
[36:25] For to one is given by the Spirit the
[36:28] word of wisdom, to another the word of
[36:31] knowledge
[36:32] &gt;&gt; by the same Spirit,
[36:34] to another faith by the same Spirit, to
[36:38] another the gifts of healing by the same
[36:41] Spirit,
[36:43] to another the working of miracles.
[36:46] to another prophecy, to another
[36:49] discerning of spirits, to another
[36:51] diverse kinds of tongues, to another the
[36:54] interpretation
[36:56] of tongues.
[36:58] But all these workketh that one, and the
[37:02] self-same spirit, dividing to every man
[37:05] severally as he will. For as the body is
[37:08] one and hath many members, and all the
[37:12] members of that one body being many, are
[37:16] one body, so also is Christ.
[37:21] For by one spirit are we all baptized
[37:25] into one body.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether
[37:30] we be bond or free, and have been all
[37:34] made to drink into one spirit. Let's
[37:38] just bow in prayer one more time.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for that
[37:42] spirit, Lord. Thank you for
[37:44] &gt;&gt; your spirit. We know that they're one
[37:47] and the same, Lord. That one that we
[37:49] read about is truly your life. And
[37:52] Father, tonight we just invite your
[37:54] spirit to manifest in our midst.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, that you would help us all
[37:58] to get out of the way and just give you
[38:00] the preeminence, Father, that you could
[38:02] take this word and you could break it
[38:04] open to us fresh once again. Yes, Lord.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just ask all these things
[38:09] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[38:13] seated.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Certainly wonderful to see so many
[38:17] people out on a Wednesday evening.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; I was doing a little reminiscing this
[38:23] week and certainly thankful for the
[38:27] leadership of the Lord in in the church
[38:29] and in our lives. And uh you know I I
[38:34] I'll just I'll just be transparent with
[38:37] it. I uh
[38:40] back in the day when brother Ken was
[38:42] still here, I questioned what uh what
[38:45] did brother Ken preach the first service
[38:47] that I came because I couldn't even
[38:49] remember. And uh so I got into the I was
[38:53] working in the sound booth a little bit
[38:55] when I was a deacon and brother Ken was
[38:57] pastor here. And I looked up that
[38:59] service July 27th, 2005, and we had it
[39:03] on the computer. And uh so I I I
[39:07] stumbled my way through and found a way
[39:09] to actually burn it to a CD. And uh so I
[39:13] had this CD and I put it away. I wanted
[39:17] to keep it safe and I was going to
[39:18] listen to it one day. And uh through the
[39:22] process of time, I didn't listen to it.
[39:24] You know, after brother Ken passed away,
[39:26] I I just found it difficult really, to
[39:29] be honest, to listen to him. But I got
[39:32] into listening to some of the sermons
[39:34] from Brother Ken and uh was able to
[39:38] begin to really just just celebrate the
[39:42] leadership of a a God-led pastor, a Holy
[39:46] Ghost filled man. And you know, I I was
[39:49] going through some stuff this last week
[39:50] and I came across this this CD that I
[39:53] mentioned and and I thought, man, I'm so
[39:56] thrilled to find this CD and I I've been
[39:59] listening to it and it just made me so
[40:02] uh I guess just miss Brother Ken.
[40:07] But, you know, it's wonderful to see
[40:11] what the Lord has done. And what I was
[40:13] really thrilled about was just stepping
[40:15] back and looking at what the Lord has
[40:17] done for the body in Calgary.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; And you know, offices aside, just to
[40:23] look at the group of individuals in this
[40:26] city that want to celebrate this message
[40:29] of the hour, the leadership of Jesus
[40:31] Christ as a body. And I was just
[40:34] thanking the Lord for that. and and even
[40:36] tonight looking at everyone here, it
[40:38] it's it's no accident that we're here as
[40:41] a body, but it's just uh just a
[40:43] beautiful thing to to really think
[40:46] about. Now, some might just think
[40:48] Brother Barry's crazy and I have no idea
[40:50] what you're talking about, and I
[40:51] apologize if I'm rambling on about this,
[40:54] but you know, uh there's usually always
[40:56] a little bit of a a preamble before a
[40:59] service actually happens. So, that's
[41:01] just the way it is. we need to get in
[41:02] and get settled in the pulpit and then
[41:04] just allow the spirit to move. And you
[41:06] know, just being honest and transparent,
[41:08] that's really where my heart's been this
[41:10] week. And I've I've really been uh just
[41:12] a little bit melancholy and a little bit
[41:15] a little bit uh well, not a little bit,
[41:17] but a lot thankful for a Holy Ghostled
[41:20] pastor and uh certainly thankful for
[41:23] brother Ken and all that he did for the
[41:25] body in Calgary here.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh we just want to keep our
[41:28] shoulder tight to the wheel and make
[41:31] sure that we're doing everything we can.
[41:32] And you know, for those who are
[41:34] wondering, I can share that service. I'd
[41:36] be thrilled to do it. Maybe what we
[41:38] could do is even put it on uh on the
[41:40] computer here and you could just have
[41:42] thumb drives. But brother Kenny preached
[41:44] on the seven sons of one SA and uh you
[41:48] know how we can try and do things on our
[41:50] own and uh how we can make a mess of it
[41:54] and you know the people that tried to do
[41:55] it in that day in that church what they
[41:57] did was wanted to to perform the way
[42:00] that they wanted to. They wanted to take
[42:02] the gift and operate it the way they
[42:04] wanted to. They didn't want to fall
[42:05] under the leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[42:08] They did not want to have a pastor in
[42:10] their day. They wanted to actually just
[42:12] do it their way and get gained from it.
[42:14] And what happened was they wound up
[42:16] leaving the church wounded and naked.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; And that devil leapt on them. They left
[42:22] with that devil on them. It it's amazing
[42:24] to look at the the magnitude of that
[42:26] scripture. I just was was was kind of
[42:29] beside myself as I was listening to it.
[42:31] But just hearing Brother Ken's voice
[42:34] preach it, it just did something for me.
[42:36] And yeah, there's there's a whole lot
[42:38] that I could say about that. And tonight
[42:40] I don't want to do that. I want to get
[42:41] into the the spiritual gifts. And uh
[42:44] we're certainly thankful for the gifts
[42:45] in the church in the body. It's it's the
[42:49] you know the the the global body, the
[42:52] the body of the Lord. It's uh a many
[42:56] membered body. And we're not interested
[42:58] in chasing gifts. We're not interested
[43:01] I'll tell you, I was thinking about it,
[43:03] you know, uh we're not going to go into
[43:04] a study of the individual gifts and talk
[43:07] about personality types. I'm not doing
[43:09] that. I'm not passing out worksheets as
[43:12] we go through this study so that we can
[43:14] try and discover what our gifts are. I'm
[43:16] not going to do that. It's up to us to
[43:19] actually go to the Lord and just trust
[43:21] him that he would manifest his spirit
[43:23] through our lives and he will activate
[43:25] that gift in our lives.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; We will see the manifestation of the
[43:30] spirit in our lives the way that he
[43:31] wants it to be done. But I know there's
[43:33] ministries that have done that. And and
[43:35] I just it came across my my heart, you
[43:37] know, should I be doing that? Can we
[43:39] come up with worksheets so that we could
[43:40] discover what our We're not doing that.
[43:43] No.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; I would say that's maybe vacation Bible
[43:45] school stuff. We want to see the spirit
[43:47] of the living God live out through our
[43:49] lives. That's what we want to do here.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I apologize if somebody didn't like
[43:53] my statement there with that, but I I
[43:56] think it's very important. We're not
[43:57] getting into a psychological aspect of
[43:59] this. This is all about the operation of
[44:02] the spirit in the body.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham, he says this
[44:06] and uh I did send an email with the
[44:08] quotes, but not this one. So, don't
[44:10] worry. Don't get nervous. You're not
[44:11] going to find it there in the email.
[44:13] Brother Bradom, he says that this is his
[44:15] words. And all nine spiritual gifts
[44:19] should be in every local body and not
[44:23] just be in the body, but they should be
[44:25] operating and manifest the church. I
[44:29] think it's beautiful the way he said
[44:30] that. Was it an accident that they
[44:32] should manifest the church or that they
[44:34] should be manifesting in the church? I
[44:37] don't think it's any accident at all
[44:38] that he said it that way. And manifest
[44:41] the church. They should be what
[44:44] demonstrates what's going on in the
[44:46] church. Now, once again, just for the
[44:49] record as we go, I'm going to keep
[44:50] saying this. We're not chasing gifts,
[44:52] but we shouldn't be afraid of them
[44:54] either.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; There's a real delicate balance there.
[44:56] And I think it's such a beautiful thing.
[44:58] said it. My heart's desire is to say,
[45:00] brothers and sisters, let's not be
[45:02] afraid of the spirit of God because
[45:04] where the spirit of God is, there is
[45:06] liberty. And where there's liberty of
[45:07] the spirit of God, we're going to see
[45:09] gifts in our midst.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; But there's many scarecrows that have
[45:14] been raised up around this because
[45:18] that's where the devil loves to get in,
[45:19] isn't it? He loves to get in and and get
[45:22] people doing things and acting ways. And
[45:24] you're never going to get out of
[45:25] control. You're never going to get out
[45:26] of order if you have the spirit of God
[45:28] and he operates a gift in your life.
[45:31] We're never going to do that. And and
[45:33] you know, let's just say for example,
[45:35] maybe we do maybe we do get a little bit
[45:38] out of order. A and something happens.
[45:41] The thing that will happen after that,
[45:42] if somebody says it, you know what,
[45:44] according to the word of God, it was out
[45:45] of order. If they're truly of the spirit
[45:48] of God, they'll say, "Oh, forgive me."
[45:52] Right? It will be that simple. will be
[45:54] able to actually be corrected by the
[45:55] word of God. We won't be so puffed up
[45:58] that we can't be corrected by the word
[45:59] of God. There is truly a balance with
[46:02] this. But all nine spiritual gifts
[46:04] should be in every local body operating
[46:07] and manifest the church. It's so
[46:10] beautiful. I think it's wonderful the
[46:12] way that we can see this. you know,
[46:13] talking about the scripture tonight out
[46:15] of 1 Corinthians chapter 12, brother uh
[46:19] brother Paul here, he talks about this
[46:21] and he says in verse three, "Wherefore I
[46:23] give you to understand that no man
[46:26] speaking by the spirit of God calleth
[46:28] Jesus a cursed and no man can say that
[46:31] Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy
[46:35] Ghost." So that is what I believe the
[46:39] baseline for all of this.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; There's no talk. we might as well just
[46:43] stay home if we're not going to come to
[46:45] church and talk about getting the Holy
[46:47] Ghost in our lives. We're not going to
[46:49] see gifts manifest in our body the way
[46:52] that they should according to scripture
[46:54] unless we do have the Holy Ghost in our
[46:56] lives. Because remember, Brother
[46:58] Brandham said it that Satan can
[46:59] impersonate any gift. This is why it's
[47:02] so treacherous. The devil loves to
[47:04] impersonate gifts. He loves to speak in
[47:06] tongues. He loves to speak in tongues
[47:08] out of order. I heard a brother fairly
[47:10] recently in Canada talking about the
[47:13] congregation in his church how he would
[47:15] preach and preach and preach and it was
[47:18] such a wonderful service and at the end
[47:20] of the service while they're actually
[47:22] having the first or second song right
[47:23] after the preaching what would happen a
[47:25] sister would jump up and just speak in
[47:27] tonesues she would speak in tongues so
[47:30] fervently and loud and and convicted
[47:33] right in Canada recently and and then
[47:35] she would sit down and there would be no
[47:37] interpretation. of it and it happened
[47:40] two or three times and he had to say
[47:42] listen there's something wrong here
[47:46] because I I I said wow that's an
[47:48] interesting thing and he said yeah
[47:49] what's going on is that spirit is
[47:51] manifesting in that sister and trying to
[47:54] actually undermine all of the word
[47:56] that's gone forward the whole entire
[47:58] service
[47:59] &gt;&gt; at the end of the service everyone's
[48:01] attracted now to this gift of speaking
[48:04] in tongues
[48:06] &gt;&gt; but yet there's no interpretation and
[48:07] brother Brandham He said very clearly
[48:09] that if there's going to be a speaking
[48:10] in tongues, there has to be an
[48:11] interpretation and it has to be judged
[48:12] in the church and it has to be relevant.
[48:16] Not just, you know, thus sayaith the
[48:18] Lord and and quoting a scripture.
[48:20] There's there's a very specific way that
[48:22] this is supposed to happen. And we know
[48:24] the word gives us a direction for it,
[48:25] but you know, it's not going to happen
[48:27] correctly, but by the Holy Ghost.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; That's the way it has to be. But it goes
[48:33] on in verse four to say, "Now there are
[48:35] diversities of gifts, but the same
[48:38] spirit. It's not different spirits." As
[48:42] soon as different spirits get in there,
[48:44] then it's something other than the Holy
[48:46] Spirit.
[48:47] And there are differences of
[48:49] administrations,
[48:50] but the same Lord. And you know, the the
[48:53] the word administrations, I'm not going
[48:55] to get too far into the the meanings
[48:57] according to the lexicon tonight, but
[48:59] I'm just going to say it this way for
[49:01] simplicity's sake. It's offices. There's
[49:04] differences of offices, administrations,
[49:08] but it's still the same Lord. And there
[49:10] are diversities of operations which are
[49:13] Acts. And we know that this is exactly
[49:15] what brother Brandham talked about in
[49:17] the book of Acts. The book of Acts was
[49:19] not the acts of the apostles. According
[49:21] to the way the the majority of
[49:23] Christians in the world speak about it,
[49:25] it's actually the acts of the Holy Ghost
[49:28] operating through those men.
[49:32] But there are diversities of operations,
[49:35] acts of the Holy Ghost. But it's the
[49:38] self, it's the same God which workketh
[49:42] all and all. But the manifestation of
[49:44] the spirit is given to every man to
[49:46] profit with all. There's no man that is
[49:49] not supposed to have the the Holy Spirit
[49:52] in their lives. Every single one of us
[49:55] should see some form of a gift in our
[49:57] lives.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; This is not exclusive. the the scripture
[50:00] of God is of no private interpretation.
[50:03] And and I remember a brother telling me,
[50:05] there's no such thing as as uh
[50:06] discernment. It's only for the prophet.
[50:09] And I thought, my goodness, I I don't
[50:11] see I don't see it, but I guess if
[50:13] that's how you see it. Maybe that's the
[50:16] way it should be. But uh you know, it
[50:17] says it right here that there are gifts
[50:19] of discernment. But anyways, in 1958,
[50:23] Jesus Christ is saying yesterday, today,
[50:25] and forever. Brother Brham
[50:27] talking about spiritual gifts. Now, as a
[50:31] preacher, I'm not very much of a
[50:33] preacher, but the Lord has given a gift,
[50:36] a divine gift, which in the scriptures,
[50:39] we are taught that gifts and callings
[50:42] are without repentance.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; And that's church gifts. Not the gifts
[50:47] to the local church which we are to pray
[50:50] for like in 1 Corinthians 12. But
[50:53] there's five ministering gifts which are
[50:56] the fornowledge of God.
[50:59] And the first of those are apostles,
[51:01] prophets, teachers, evangelists, and
[51:03] pastors.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Those are God sent gifts to the church.
[51:09] Now I I love how brother Bradom he
[51:11] preaches this. He doesn't change his
[51:12] perspective on this in his entire
[51:14] ministry. And I'm not going to try and
[51:16] prove that by the quotes tonight, but
[51:18] I'm just going to say it. And if anybody
[51:20] really wants to see it, you can look it
[51:22] up and and go over it. But he doesn't
[51:24] change that. And even though today there
[51:27] are those that believe Ephesians 4 is
[51:29] not enough, that's a lying spirit.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Because Ephesians 4 is for the
[51:35] perfecting of the saints. Without
[51:37] Ephesians 4, this group of gifts for the
[51:40] church that we just read about, there is
[51:42] no perfecting of the saints. There's no
[51:45] eighth messenger. There's no ninth
[51:47] messenger. There's only seven church age
[51:49] messengers. And the seventh church age
[51:51] messenger has come and done what he is
[51:54] supposed to do.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here tonight. It's
[51:57] pretty amazing when we just zoom out and
[51:58] look at it that way. That's why we're
[52:00] here because he did what he was supposed
[52:01] to do.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; He was obedient and and honest with the
[52:04] word.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; And that that alone, I think it just
[52:08] behooves us to be obedient and honest
[52:10] with the word ourselves.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; It's not always pleasant. It doesn't
[52:14] always feel good, but we know that it
[52:17] will actually garner eternal salvation
[52:19] for us.
[52:21] But brother Brandham, he says here the
[52:23] the there's five ministering gifts which
[52:25] are the fornowledge of God. And the
[52:26] first of those are apostles, prophets,
[52:29] teachers, evangelists, and pastors.
[52:31] Those are God-cent gifts to the church.
[52:34] And I love how brother Brandom breaks
[52:35] this down here. Apostles or
[52:39] missionaries. We call them missionaries
[52:41] today. But some people want to be called
[52:43] apostles today. We call them
[52:46] missionaries today. In the early day,
[52:49] they called them apostle. Now, anyone
[52:52] knows knows that the word apostle means
[52:55] one sent. And the word missionary means
[52:59] one scent. So, it's both the same thing.
[53:02] Missionaries, prophets, teachers,
[53:05] evangelists, pastors.
[53:08] So tonight, I I I just felt like before
[53:11] we get too far into even talking about
[53:14] the individual gifts here that are all
[53:16] by the same spirit, it it's interesting
[53:18] to talk about the offices or the
[53:21] operation that we can see in here as a
[53:24] manifestation of the spirit. And and
[53:26] that is what we read about, you know,
[53:28] the the the apostles and the prophets,
[53:32] teachers,
[53:34] evangelists, and pastors. Carrying on,
[53:37] he says here, then in every local church
[53:40] there's nine spiritual gifts that should
[53:43] operate. The nine spiritual gifts should
[53:45] operate and they should be all inside
[53:47] the local church. So there's there's the
[53:50] gifts of the ministry, but there's also
[53:53] the gifts of the spirit that should
[53:55] actually be operating in the body. And I
[53:58] think it's so good the way that he
[53:59] brings this out. It's important to
[54:01] recognize that those gifts are not just
[54:03] for the ministry. And I think sometimes
[54:06] in the day in which we live, it's almost
[54:09] not even spoken necessarily, but an
[54:12] undercurrent. It's almost maybe not
[54:14] spoken like I said, but assumed that
[54:17] those gifts, they lie strongly in the
[54:20] ministry, but not in the body. And I
[54:23] personally believe, brothers and
[54:24] sisters, it's the other way around.
[54:26] Because the gift of actually being an
[54:28] apostle or a missionary is something
[54:30] totally different than being uh someone
[54:33] who is maybe in a congregation that just
[54:36] has the desire to pray. They just pray
[54:38] and pray and pray. They're prayer
[54:40] warriors. There are people like that in
[54:42] the body and we thank the Lord for those
[54:45] people.
[54:47] But there's different positions for the
[54:49] gifts, different offices,
[54:51] administrations, as we read already in
[54:53] the scripture, administrations,
[54:55] different administrations, the pastor,
[54:57] the prophet, the the evangelist, the
[54:59] teacher, the the missionary. And then
[55:02] the nine spiritual gifts that are in the
[55:05] body, operating in the body, through the
[55:08] body, not necessarily through the
[55:10] ministry. I think it's really important
[55:12] to to nail that down. He says, "Then in
[55:15] every local church, there's nine
[55:16] spiritual gifts which should be
[55:17] operating in that church if they're a
[55:20] good praying congregation."
[55:24] You know, I I remember saying this a
[55:26] while ago, and it's funny where I heard
[55:28] it, the place that I heard it from, but
[55:29] it really really resounded with me.
[55:32] Imagine the church only going forward on
[55:37] its knees,
[55:39] &gt;&gt; meaning by prayer.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; That's the only way that the body will
[55:42] advance. And I believe that with all my
[55:44] heart. It really is the only way the
[55:46] body will advance. But imagine now if we
[55:49] take it and make it on our knees. How
[55:51] far will the church go forwards?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; With our prayer.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; For me, that's humbling.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so incredible because
[55:59] really it takes that. It's got to be a
[56:01] church if they're a good praying
[56:03] congregation.
[56:05] And then the pastor who should be the
[56:08] head of the church with the wisdom of
[56:09] God. I say, "Oh Lord have mercy. Help me
[56:12] cuz I I'm just me here. But the head of
[56:16] the church with the wisdom of God to
[56:18] have that church set in order so no
[56:21] fanaticism or nothing takes place wrong.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Just everything proven purely the spirit
[56:29] of the Holy Ghost working among the
[56:33] people. Then you've got a real church
[56:36] that's an example church to all the
[56:39] regions around about. And you know, I
[56:42] think that's real good that we want to
[56:44] be an example to the regions all around
[56:47] about. But honestly, my heart's desire
[56:50] is to just be like that voice that
[56:52] brother Brandham talked about when he
[56:53] saw the preview of the bride is to just
[56:55] stay in line. Just every single service,
[56:57] throw it in there. Stay in line. Make
[57:00] sure that we've got that token applied.
[57:02] Stay in line. Don't start looking at
[57:04] Hollywood. Stay in line. Don't be all
[57:06] fussed about trying to lay up treasures
[57:09] of finances here. Just stay in line.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; There's so many things that are
[57:14] distractions here for us.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; And we all have them. I'm guilty.
[57:19] But you know, we we we are an example to
[57:21] the regions about even when we just go
[57:23] about our lives in our our businesses
[57:25] and school and even if we just go out
[57:28] shopping. If you just go to the mall
[57:30] with a sister, with your wife, people
[57:33] look. If they have their hair down,
[57:35] people look. It is strange to have
[57:38] really long hair and to be we stand out.
[57:42] It's wonderful.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; But we want to be an example.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; To the people around us so they can say,
[57:49] "What is it? What is it in you that
[57:51] causes you
[57:53] &gt;&gt; to stand out the way that you do? What
[57:55] is that atmosphere about you?" Yes.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; I
[57:57] &gt;&gt; like how brother Bradam he says this.
[57:59] It's it's a hive where the bees come. A
[58:02] lovely church
[58:04] &gt;&gt; and you know it's it's sweet
[58:07] &gt;&gt; and you get more bees with honey, don't
[58:09] you?
[58:10] &gt;&gt; If you go out there and you say, "Look
[58:11] at that person." A person comes in the
[58:14] congregation and and they're wearing
[58:15] high heels and a a tight minikrt. No,
[58:18] you can't come in.
[58:20] They come in with tattoos and maybe
[58:23] smelling of cigarettes or weed and maybe
[58:25] booze. No, you can't come in. Where do
[58:28] we stand when we act like that?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; We're just like the heathens.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; We're not making ourselves any better if
[58:36] we're not actually helping people.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; We're here to get people to Jesus
[58:40] Christ.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:42] And it's a beautiful thing because the
[58:44] only way we're going to do it truly is
[58:45] through this message of the hour.
[58:47] Because there's a lot of people like we
[58:49] talked about last service that are
[58:50] talking about Jesus Christ and I can
[58:52] type in my spiritual GPS and find
[58:56] whatever scripture I want and and I can
[58:58] find a way home. I can still get to
[59:00] Jesus Christ. But you can't get to the
[59:03] rapture outside of this message.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; That ain't going to happen. Right?
[59:07] &gt;&gt; There's going to be people that think
[59:09] that they're actually okay and they're
[59:11] going to be deceived. They're going to
[59:13] find out that they're deceived. They
[59:14] probably already are. And and you know,
[59:16] sadly, I think that there's people even
[59:18] in the message of the hour that are
[59:20] going to find themselves in that
[59:21] position. And I say, "Lord, don't don't
[59:24] leave me out. Help me. Search me and try
[59:26] me. I I don't want to be deceived. I
[59:28] don't want to think that I'm all right
[59:29] and actually not be all right."
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:33] &gt;&gt; You know, we're all human. We all suffer
[59:36] from the same condition. Just getting a
[59:39] little bit melancholy, you know. I I
[59:41] remember looking at brother Ken and
[59:43] Sister Shelly, and I hope it's okay,
[59:44] Sister Shelly. But I remember looking at
[59:47] them thinking, you know, they they
[59:49] probably haven't seen some of the stuff
[59:51] that's gone on in this world. I mean,
[59:53] they're in the church. They're in the
[59:55] message. Look at them. Their lives are
[59:58] pretty exemplary. And uh you know they
[1:00:01] probably don't have any idea about some
[1:00:03] of the things that go on. And uh you
[1:00:05] know come to find out they probably knew
[1:00:08] a whole lot more than I thought. They
[1:00:11] probably knew a whole lot more than
[1:00:12] maybe I even knew. And uh it's just a
[1:00:16] wonderful thing. You know that's the
[1:00:17] world that we live in. But when when we
[1:00:19] do come to the place of realizing who we
[1:00:22] are and what we're raised up for, we
[1:00:24] actually have a different character to
[1:00:27] this entire world. And and people might
[1:00:30] look at us as though we are maybe
[1:00:33] uninformed. Maybe we don't know what's
[1:00:35] going on, but we know what's going on.
[1:00:38] We're well aware of what's going on in
[1:00:40] this world.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think it's even amazing to
[1:00:44] look at the scripture here now
[1:00:46] concerning the spiritual gifts.
[1:00:47] Brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
[1:00:50] And you know, he says that many
[1:00:52] different times in the Bible of the
[1:00:54] times and the seasons. He would not have
[1:00:56] us to be ignorant. But no man knows the
[1:00:59] day or the hour, right? He doesn't leave
[1:01:02] us in the dark. He gives us what we need
[1:01:05] so that we can go forward
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; in uh faith.
[1:01:12] Faith without works is dead.
[1:01:16] Brother Branam, he says this. Now I'm
[1:01:18] not excited. We're talking about gifts
[1:01:19] here as we go through this. Now I'm not
[1:01:22] excited,
[1:01:23] but I know what I'm speaking of.
[1:01:27] The right mental attitude towards any
[1:01:29] promise of God will bring it to pass.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:01:36] How many of us here in the congregation
[1:01:39] have ever prayed for healing and not
[1:01:42] been healed?
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; And I I and not been healed.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:01:50] We uh
[1:01:52] we have the opportunity to be healed.
[1:01:55] Healing is the children's bread.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; That's what he took those stripes for.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know many times in my body I've
[1:02:04] I've been very sick and uh you know just
[1:02:09] violently sick and I think one of the
[1:02:11] last times that I was I I started to
[1:02:13] think about the word and thinking about
[1:02:16] different conversations that I've had
[1:02:18] with people and how the devil likes to
[1:02:20] come around and make us feel like we're
[1:02:22] not going to get better at all. But then
[1:02:25] something happens and and the Lord, I
[1:02:27] believe, comes on the scene and reminds
[1:02:29] us, you know, he took those stripes for
[1:02:32] us. And and I remember vividly one time
[1:02:34] just being violently ill, but I started
[1:02:37] laughing in the midst of it when I
[1:02:39] really wanted to be crying cuz I really
[1:02:41] don't like getting sick. But in the
[1:02:43] midst of it, I started laughing,
[1:02:45] thinking, "This is just this flesh. It's
[1:02:47] just this body. It's a pest house.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; I have to get better according to the
[1:02:52] word of God."
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. One way or another, I will
[1:02:55] be 100% healed.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; But I love how brother Brandham says
[1:03:00] this. I think about four or five times
[1:03:02] in the message of the hour. He says
[1:03:04] this, "The right mental attitude towards
[1:03:07] any promise of God will bring it to
[1:03:09] pass." There it is. We have to have the
[1:03:11] right mental attitude towards that
[1:03:13] promise. If we have the wrong mental
[1:03:16] attitude towards his promise, then it
[1:03:19] might not come to pass the way that we
[1:03:21] think that we would like to see it. And
[1:03:23] you know, brother Brandham in different
[1:03:24] places in the message, he says, if you
[1:03:26] want healing in your body, why do you
[1:03:27] want it?
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; What's it for?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; So you can actually go forwards and do
[1:03:33] something on your own. Is it going to be
[1:03:34] about you or like what's your reason for
[1:03:37] it? If you want to have money, what's
[1:03:39] your reason for it? Is it to provide for
[1:03:40] your family or so that you can actually
[1:03:42] go bigger and better? If you want
[1:03:45] anything and you're asking God about it,
[1:03:47] what is the purpose for it? If we have
[1:03:49] the right mental attitude, then that
[1:03:51] will bring it to pass.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say here, say, what are
[1:03:56] you talking about gifts for?
[1:04:00] Gifts are to edify.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; They're additions.
[1:04:06] Here is the first and only foundation
[1:04:08] for divine healing or anything from God
[1:04:11] is the Bible.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; If you get off of that, you're out of
[1:04:15] God's will.
[1:04:18] And divine healing isn't a hocus pocus
[1:04:21] affair.
[1:04:22] It isn't saying a few mystery words over
[1:04:26] somebody and hypnotizing.
[1:04:30] It's the truth revealed through Jesus
[1:04:33] Christ is divine healing.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:38] Gifts of the spirit are brought down to
[1:04:41] edify.
[1:04:43] In other words, it's the flag flying
[1:04:47] over top of the building.
[1:04:50] It's the appearance of the outside to
[1:04:54] attract people in out of the rain. See
[1:04:57] what I mean? Now, gifts come from God.
[1:05:02] If they are from God, they'll testify of
[1:05:07] God, and God will testify of them. Is
[1:05:12] that true?
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; I just can't help but refer back to that
[1:05:16] that message that brother Ken preached
[1:05:18] in 2005.
[1:05:20] The gifts will testify of God.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; The seven sons of Ca did not want to
[1:05:27] testify of God. They just wanted to see
[1:05:31] the operation of the gift and they
[1:05:35] wanted to be the ones that were actually
[1:05:36] doing it, bringing it on the scene. They
[1:05:38] were not actually testifying of God
[1:05:40] because if they were, they would have
[1:05:42] said, "Go see Paul.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; They would not have actually tried to do
[1:05:47] it on their own."
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "If you're sick,
[1:05:51] pray until you believe with all your
[1:05:54] heart."
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Did you ever just pray for something you
[1:05:58] just knowed you was going to get?
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; That's faith. See,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; and I I I just don't want to read over
[1:06:06] this tonight and and and go quickly
[1:06:08] through it and and just gloss over it. I
[1:06:12] want to dwell here. I want to hover here
[1:06:13] for a few minutes if it's okay. If we
[1:06:15] could just just just just dwell on this
[1:06:17] for a little bit. If you are sick, pray
[1:06:21] until you believe with all your heart.
[1:06:24] And you know, if we are sick and we have
[1:06:27] something that we need from God, are
[1:06:30] what are we doing to pray? Are we just
[1:06:34] doing the same thing that we've always
[1:06:36] done? Because if that's the case, we're
[1:06:37] only going to get what we've ever got.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; If we want something from God and we
[1:06:43] really want it from God, we need to show
[1:06:45] him that we really want it from God.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; We need to make a change in our life and
[1:06:50] demonstrate to him that we really want
[1:06:52] this.
[1:06:54] If you're sick, pray until you believe
[1:06:57] with all your heart.
[1:07:00] Did you ever pray for something you just
[1:07:01] know you was going to get? He says,
[1:07:04] "That's faith." See, and I wonder
[1:07:06] tonight, I'm not looking for a raise of
[1:07:08] hands because this gets quite personal,
[1:07:10] but how many of us have ever prayed for
[1:07:13] something that you just know you're
[1:07:15] going to get?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; That's an interesting statement. It's an
[1:07:20] interesting question. I I personally, as
[1:07:23] I was studying this and reading it, I
[1:07:25] don't know if I could say that I really
[1:07:27] just knew that I was going to get
[1:07:29] something other than healing in my life.
[1:07:31] Maybe salvation in my life and and
[1:07:34] healing in my life. But I I don't think
[1:07:36] that I could just put my finger on it
[1:07:37] and say that I prayed for something else
[1:07:38] and I just knew that I was going to get
[1:07:40] that. But I know people that have done
[1:07:42] that. I I remember hearing a testimony
[1:07:44] of a man that walked into a dealership
[1:07:46] uh uh a car dealership and said that I'm
[1:07:49] I'm I God told me that you're going to
[1:07:51] sell me that van right there for x
[1:07:53] number of dollars. And the guy said,
[1:07:56] "Yep, that's exactly right." And he sold
[1:07:58] it to him for that. And it was just an
[1:07:59] absurd number. It should have been
[1:08:01] double or triple what he offered him.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; But sometimes if we just if we pray for
[1:08:07] something and and God just reveals it to
[1:08:09] us, nothing's going to stand in the way.
[1:08:11] Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Just like knowing that we're going to be
[1:08:14] healed.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Healing is the children's bread. He took
[1:08:18] 39 stripes with the catine tails.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; For healing.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; In fact, the very first blood that was
[1:08:25] shed was from him being whipped almost
[1:08:28] to death
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; for healing. He didn't have to be
[1:08:33] whipped. He could have just been
[1:08:34] crucified.
[1:08:36] But he chose
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; that specific thing, that specific way.
[1:08:41] all of that pain and suffering just so
[1:08:43] that we could get better.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I know that I've gone over
[1:08:47] that and over that in my mind when I'm
[1:08:49] really sick and I I just thank him for
[1:08:51] that. And sometimes I think it's really
[1:08:53] important to just remind the devil, you
[1:08:56] know, the salvation and everything is
[1:08:57] all looked after. Calvary looked after
[1:08:59] it all. But let's not forget this very
[1:09:01] important detail about the cat of nine
[1:09:03] tales. Them almost taking Jesus' life
[1:09:07] with the stripes for my healing.
[1:09:10] Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; If you're sick, pray until you believe
[1:09:15] with all your heart.
[1:09:17] If we're sick tonight and we have
[1:09:19] something that we need from the Lord,
[1:09:21] then are we praying with all of our
[1:09:23] heart?
[1:09:24] Or is it some of our heart or is it just
[1:09:26] the only the bit that we can give them
[1:09:28] because we've got everything else going
[1:09:30] on? Maybe what we need to do is just
[1:09:32] reallocate some time for him so that we
[1:09:35] can actually pray a little bit more.
[1:09:37] Don't think for a second that if we do
[1:09:39] that that he'll allow us to go out and
[1:09:41] suffer. In fact, he'll actually honor
[1:09:43] it. If we're willing to give him more,
[1:09:45] he'll be willing to give us more. That's
[1:09:47] how it works. He says, "Now, if you
[1:09:50] believe that with all your heart, accept
[1:09:52] it and act on it. Don't just speak it.
[1:09:57] We have to act." I love how Brother
[1:09:59] Random says it many times. You know, you
[1:10:01] can hear some folks say that I'm, "Well,
[1:10:03] I'm just praying for this and I'm just
[1:10:05] praying for that." But sometimes we need
[1:10:07] to be acting,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; not just praying.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; We have to be moving. We've got to be
[1:10:12] going forwards. Now, if you believe that
[1:10:15] with all your heart, accept it and act
[1:10:16] on it. We know that brother John Ryan
[1:10:18] was blind as blind could be.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; But something triggered inside of him
[1:10:23] when he went back up to the prophet and
[1:10:24] said, "Hey, I thought you said I was
[1:10:26] healed." And he said, "Hey, I thought
[1:10:27] you said you believed."
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Something clicked for him. Something
[1:10:31] triggered and it became a revelation.
[1:10:33] And it wasn't from the prophet to him.
[1:10:35] It was God. the angel of the Lord that
[1:10:36] was with the prophet that told him that
[1:10:39] and that's what triggered that faith in
[1:10:40] his life and at that point he became
[1:10:42] what they called a nuisance in the
[1:10:44] services because he knew that praising
[1:10:47] God was going to bring the promise on
[1:10:49] the scene it was going to bring the
[1:10:50] blessing down in his life even in the
[1:10:53] midst of people mocking him saying
[1:10:55] you're not going to get it look at you
[1:10:56] the natural circumstances look at the
[1:10:58] natural circumstances study the veil
[1:11:00] look at the natural circumstances long
[1:11:02] as we do that that's where we're going
[1:11:03] to be
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; we got to go beyond that. We got to look
[1:11:06] beyond the camp. We got to be willing to
[1:11:08] say this is the promise of God. He says,
[1:11:11] "Now, if you believe that with all your
[1:11:12] heart, accept it and act on it." Now,
[1:11:13] you can believe it just as much as you
[1:11:16] wanted to. If you didn't act on it,
[1:11:18] you'll sit right there like a sinner
[1:11:21] would lay at the altar. If you got down
[1:11:24] there and prayed and prayed, you said,
[1:11:26] "Lord, I know you saved me." But that's
[1:11:30] just I know you said he'll never get
[1:11:33] through until he rises, confesses it,
[1:11:37] and stays with it.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And shows works with it.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; You know, we we can get into the whole
[1:11:46] discussion is works is faith expressed.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Show me your faith
[1:11:56] and I'll show you my works. Amen.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Is what the word says.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; I believe it's in the book of James.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; But I'll show you my faith by the works
[1:12:06] that you see demonstrated in my life.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Because talk is cheap, man.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; We can say it all we want, but what do
[1:12:15] we live?
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; What is the life that we're living?
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me."
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; We've talked about this in the past. You
[1:12:25] know, we talk about prayer meeting.
[1:12:27] Prayer meeting is a wonderful thing,
[1:12:28] brothers and sisters. I'm not gonna I'm
[1:12:31] not going to back up from it. I'm just
[1:12:32] gonna I'm just going to go for it. It's
[1:12:34] important. Prayer meetings are
[1:12:36] important. And you know, I think they're
[1:12:38] probably even more important than a
[1:12:40] regular Wednesday night service. Don't
[1:12:42] you?
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Don't you think so?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that's the most
[1:12:46] powerful weapon that we have is prayer.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we come to church just to be
[1:12:52] fed a little bit and we can go home? We
[1:12:54] done our service. But what about when
[1:12:56] when we come together and we pray
[1:12:58] together?
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; We get in the spirit. We sing some
[1:13:01] songs, some hymns. We we we welcome the
[1:13:04] Lord in our midst and then we begin to
[1:13:06] pray for the needs that we have in our
[1:13:08] lives.
[1:13:10] I think it's incredible. But you know,
[1:13:12] when we have a prayer meeting, there's
[1:13:13] like 10 people here out of a church of a
[1:13:16] hundred. Why is it? We read it the other
[1:13:20] night or the other uh Yeah, it was the
[1:13:22] other night, the other prayer meeting in
[1:13:24] in the conduct, order, and doctrine
[1:13:26] book. It's because the revival's over in
[1:13:28] this world. The spirit revival is over.
[1:13:31] There's a bride revival going on, but
[1:13:33] there's actually something else taking
[1:13:35] place in this world that's causing
[1:13:37] everyone to just be busy, busy, busy,
[1:13:39] busy with everything. And you know, I I
[1:13:41] know myself. I know myself what it means
[1:13:45] to actually be busy. But I also know
[1:13:48] that when you actually take and you
[1:13:50] alter things, you turn that dial a
[1:13:52] little bit in your life and you force
[1:13:54] everything else to become second and you
[1:13:57] put God first, there's a blessing that
[1:13:59] comes.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; he says, "Now, you can believe it just
[1:14:05] as much as you wanted to. If if you
[1:14:08] didn't act on it, you'll sit right there
[1:14:10] like a sinner would lay at the altar. If
[1:14:13] you got down there and prayed and
[1:14:14] prayed, you said, "Lord, I know you just
[1:14:16] saved me, but that just I I know you
[1:14:19] said he'll never get through until he
[1:14:21] rises and confesses and stays with it
[1:14:23] and shows works with it." James said,
[1:14:25] "Just as a body is dead without the
[1:14:27] spirit, so as faith without works is
[1:14:29] dead." No matter how much you believe,
[1:14:33] no matter how much we believe. And
[1:14:35] that's why I'm telling you friends,
[1:14:37] these gifts are brought in to make the
[1:14:40] presence of God real to you.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; I guess I'm nearly deafening talking.
[1:14:49] The gifts are brought to make the
[1:14:51] presence of God real to you.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Then your faith looks up to God and
[1:14:56] accepts divine healing or salvation or
[1:15:00] whatever you have need of from God.
[1:15:04] You know, brothers and sisters, I can
[1:15:05] tell you just simple little testimonies
[1:15:08] just because I think it's important for
[1:15:09] us to never ever under undervalue the
[1:15:13] power of God. When I first came into the
[1:15:16] church, I first started serving the
[1:15:17] Lord. I I was a ranked sinner, came
[1:15:20] right in out of the world. I I was
[1:15:22] working on one house in the service
[1:15:24] department for the the builder. We had
[1:15:26] one customer that had this issue with
[1:15:29] their house and and I don't know if it
[1:15:30] was just they didn't like the house or
[1:15:32] or something. Usually the the sales
[1:15:34] center from the very start would rub the
[1:15:36] p customer wrong and then it would just
[1:15:38] be the whole entire process all the way
[1:15:40] through a whole year worth of agony with
[1:15:42] a customer that just didn't like their
[1:15:44] house. But I got I got invited to take
[1:15:47] over one of these projects after they
[1:15:49] had taken possession of their house and
[1:15:51] and I had to do something a particular
[1:15:53] thing in their house. And there was just
[1:15:54] really no way that I could ever do it.
[1:15:57] It had happened four times. Four other
[1:16:00] service techs tried attempted to do it.
[1:16:02] And every single time there was an issue
[1:16:04] with it. And you know, sometimes it's
[1:16:07] just the simplest little tiniest little
[1:16:09] speck that you could just barely see.
[1:16:11] But the person when they're in that
[1:16:12] state, man, they look at it with a
[1:16:14] magnifying glass and a flashlight and
[1:16:16] they'll go over it and over it and and
[1:16:18] they just went they did that. And so I
[1:16:21] got tasked with this right after I was
[1:16:23] saved. And I I was starting to worry. I
[1:16:25] was like, I don't even know how I'm
[1:16:26] going to do this. And it might sound
[1:16:28] silly. But you know what? I I actually
[1:16:31] said, "No, I I'm I'm not going to go to
[1:16:33] church on I'm not going to go and deal
[1:16:35] with this on a Sunday." I had to go and
[1:16:36] deal with painters and stuff and and and
[1:16:38] just do all this different stuff. And
[1:16:41] you know, I they wanted me to do on the
[1:16:42] weekend. And I said, "No, I'm actually
[1:16:44] not going to be a weekend warrior now.
[1:16:46] I'm going to church on Sunday. I'm going
[1:16:48] to do that and I'll do it Monday when
[1:16:50] I'm supposed to on my job." And and then
[1:16:53] it was like, "Oh, you're gonna be like
[1:16:55] that." Okay. And uh but nobody was able
[1:16:58] to satisfy these customers. And you
[1:17:00] know, I just gave it to the Lord. I
[1:17:01] said, "Lord, I don't know how on earth
[1:17:03] I'm ever going to be able to satisfy
[1:17:04] this customer. How is it ever going to
[1:17:06] go away? They're already with new home
[1:17:08] warranty. It was just this big blown up
[1:17:10] thing. I gave it to the Lord and I was
[1:17:13] able to deliver that thing that I needed
[1:17:16] to in a way that it needed to happen and
[1:17:18] it was flawless." Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; But that was totally the Lord.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; It sounds like a very simple little
[1:17:27] thing. But I can tell you through that
[1:17:29] little simple little thing, it gave me
[1:17:31] just enough courage in that moment to
[1:17:34] say, "If he could do it there,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; couldn't he do it here?
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; And if he could do it here, can't he do
[1:17:41] it there? And if he could do it there,
[1:17:44] it's exactly the way the Lord does it in
[1:17:46] our lives, brothers and sisters. He
[1:17:48] wants us to trust him,
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; but we've got to be willing to take that
[1:17:53] step to do something different,
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful the way that he does it.
[1:18:00] I love how he says this though, you
[1:18:02] know, then lift then then your faith
[1:18:04] looks up to God and accepts divine
[1:18:05] healing or salvation or whatever you
[1:18:07] have need of from God. It isn't only do
[1:18:12] one thing or another. Anything that you
[1:18:15] have need of in this earth's journey,
[1:18:18] God will supply it if you have need of
[1:18:21] it.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; If you've got a boss that you just can't
[1:18:25] stand or that just can't stand you and
[1:18:27] you need a job, he'll either change that
[1:18:30] boss or you'll find another job.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; If we've got a problem client, he'll
[1:18:36] find a solution for it. If if if we have
[1:18:39] any issue in this earth,
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; he promises to supply our needs.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; But you know what this world has done?
[1:18:47] This world has caused a circumstance
[1:18:50] where we get ourselves into a position
[1:18:52] of wants.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And those wants transpire into needs.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; And because we're in the midst of our
[1:19:02] needs,
[1:19:04] now we have wants. And the wants
[1:19:07] actually become needs. And before long,
[1:19:09] we cannot see. You know the saying, you
[1:19:11] can't see the forest through the trees,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Because you got all these trees in front
[1:19:15] of you. Or or sometimes we paint
[1:19:17] ourselves into a corner. I've done both,
[1:19:19] by the way, with our business. I've done
[1:19:22] both. I got myself so busy, so
[1:19:24] incredibly busy that I can't come to
[1:19:25] church. Ah, you know what? Wednesday
[1:19:27] night, it'll be okay. I'll just pick it
[1:19:29] up later. And, you know, God will still
[1:19:31] bless me. I know I'm saved. It doesn't
[1:19:32] matter. It does matter. It matters a
[1:19:34] whole lot more than we might think. And
[1:19:37] and you know when we start to let those
[1:19:38] little bars down, what happens is the
[1:19:40] goats get in.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; But he says anything that you have need
[1:19:45] of in this earth's journey, God will
[1:19:48] supply it if you have need of it.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; He promises to supply your needs, not
[1:19:53] your wants, your needs. So many times
[1:19:56] when we ask for things in prayer
[1:19:59] fervently and we don't get them, I think
[1:20:02] it's worthwhile stepping back and
[1:20:04] saying, "Is this a want
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; or is this a need?"
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Because he's only going to be
[1:20:10] accountable to his word.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And he's God, he says, and and he can
[1:20:16] only he can only get it to you as you
[1:20:20] believe him.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; And gifts are to make you see that he's
[1:20:23] here.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his attitude towards one is
[1:20:28] towards all. Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; I think it's just so wonderful.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You know what else is wonderful? From
[1:20:35] the beginning, that clock has been
[1:20:37] quarter to 9.
[1:20:40] I don't even know what time it is right
[1:20:41] now. So, I'm I'm going to It is actually
[1:20:44] quarter to 9. Hilarious.
[1:20:48] Proverbs 15
[1:20:50] verse 27.
[1:20:53] He that is greedy of gain
[1:20:56] troubleeth his own house.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; But he that hateth gifts shall live.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; I think it's interesting this little
[1:21:08] study of spiritual gifts that we're into
[1:21:11] as we go forwards. It's really important
[1:21:13] for us to understand that he wants to
[1:21:16] supply all of our needs.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's his word according to his riches
[1:21:20] in glory.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he's not going to supply our
[1:21:24] needs. Even when we paint ourselves into
[1:21:26] a corner, if we paint ourselves into a
[1:21:28] corner with our wants, which transpire
[1:21:32] into our needs, he's going to allow us
[1:21:34] to get really, really needy in that
[1:21:36] corner before he actually supplies our
[1:21:39] need. And it might not be exactly the
[1:21:41] way that we want it or think that it
[1:21:43] should be actually answered or supplied,
[1:21:45] but he'll do it.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; He always does. He's always accountable
[1:21:49] to his word.
[1:21:52] It's wonderful how he never changes.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; You know, in Genesis chapter 25, the
[1:21:57] very first occurrence of the word gifts,
[1:22:01] Genesis 25:6, but unto the sons of the
[1:22:04] concubines
[1:22:05] which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts,
[1:22:11] and sent them away from Isaac his son.
[1:22:16] Interesting scripture here. while he yet
[1:22:19] lived eastward unto the east country. I
[1:22:22] I can't help but think when you read a
[1:22:23] scripture like this talking about gifts,
[1:22:25] this is a a perfect example of the
[1:22:28] people that are going to chase gifts.
[1:22:30] But you know, the royal seed of Abraham,
[1:22:33] they're not interested in chasing the
[1:22:35] gifts because they're the ones that were
[1:22:37] sent away. They were given gifts and
[1:22:39] pushed aside. Why would the son of
[1:22:42] Abraham want the gifts? He didn't need
[1:22:45] gifts because he had Abraham. He had his
[1:22:47] father and and it's the same way for us
[1:22:50] as the spiritual royal seed of Abraham.
[1:22:53] We're not chasing gifts. The gifts they
[1:22:56] go with the people who go and live in
[1:22:58] the east country. Yeah. They're not the
[1:23:00] ones who are actually seeking the Lord
[1:23:02] with all of their hearts. Isaac had the
[1:23:05] giver. He didn't need a gift.
[1:23:08] You know, out of what it takes to
[1:23:10] overcome
[1:23:12] what it takes to overcome all unbelief.
[1:23:14] In 1960, brother Brandham says here,
[1:23:17] "Then God has gifts that he has fornown
[1:23:20] for each age and has placed them into
[1:23:23] the church."
[1:23:25] Now, we find out there's five of those
[1:23:28] gifts. The first of them is missionaries
[1:23:30] or apostles. The word apostle means one
[1:23:32] sent. The word missionary means one
[1:23:33] sent. The missionary is sent. An apostle
[1:23:36] is sent. God sends his missionary. God
[1:23:39] sends his apostle
[1:23:42] first as apostles, prophets, teachers,
[1:23:44] evangelists, pastors. Those five
[1:23:47] God-given gifts in the church. So each
[1:23:50] of you people who has a godly pastor has
[1:23:53] a gift from God in your church. A
[1:23:56] shepherd pastor means a shepherd to
[1:23:58] watch over the flock to teach them the
[1:24:01] word of God.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then these other nine spiritual
[1:24:04] gifts should be operating in the church
[1:24:08] to keep the church clean.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Like the Ananas and Safirus and so
[1:24:16] forth.
[1:24:18] That's pretty strong.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Ananas and Safirus.
[1:24:23] You know the story.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; What was it? They they they all had all
[1:24:29] things in common, but yet they they just
[1:24:32] wanted to keep a little pinch of the
[1:24:34] money back. It was all about money. Can
[1:24:37] you imagine? And you know, when they
[1:24:40] came in, Paul said, just paraphrasing,
[1:24:43] why do you try and deceive the Holy
[1:24:45] Ghost? Why are you lying to the Holy
[1:24:46] Ghost? But they came in and actually
[1:24:48] lied to Paul, right? They came in and
[1:24:51] lied to the brethren about what they had
[1:24:53] done just because they wanted to hold
[1:24:55] back a little bit of money. Maybe they
[1:24:56] wanted to have a bit of an investment
[1:24:58] and look after their family a little bit
[1:25:00] or or whatever. They wanted a vacation
[1:25:02] property. They wanted something just a
[1:25:04] little bit to their themselves. And and
[1:25:07] you know, you can't fool God. We're
[1:25:08] we're not going to fool. We're not going
[1:25:10] to bluff the Holy Ghost. And that's why
[1:25:12] I think it's so wonderful to have a a
[1:25:14] spiritfilled church, like a true
[1:25:16] spiritfilled church, a baptism of the
[1:25:19] Holy Ghost experience in the name of
[1:25:21] Jesus Christ. because we are in an
[1:25:23] Ananas and Safh time. There's no pulling
[1:25:27] the wool over the Holy Ghost in this
[1:25:29] congregation, brothers and sisters. And
[1:25:31] I know it's wonderful because some
[1:25:33] people get excited when you start to
[1:25:34] talk like that and other people start to
[1:25:36] squirm. And you know, myself, I'll tell
[1:25:39] you when my pastor used to preach like
[1:25:41] that, I used to squirm because I know
[1:25:43] that I'm just a human being and I still
[1:25:45] have desires. I still have problems and
[1:25:47] issues in my life. But you know what
[1:25:49] happens is I bring them to the Lord and
[1:25:51] say, "Lord, forgive me. I don't want to
[1:25:53] hold nothing back from you.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; I come to service early so that I can
[1:25:58] get myself out of the way and just allow
[1:26:00] his spirit to wash me." But that's all
[1:26:02] it takes, brothers and sisters, is just
[1:26:04] to surrender our lives unto him.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to be afraid. But when
[1:26:10] we're not actually fully surrendered, I
[1:26:13] will say this. If you're going to come
[1:26:16] and be in the congregation of the church
[1:26:19] of the living God, be afraid. Be very
[1:26:22] afraid.
[1:26:24] Because the spirit of God will not be
[1:26:26] mocked.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; This ain't fooling.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; This is the real deal.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And I I can only tell you that I know
[1:26:36] what it did for me.
[1:26:38] And I truly hope that it will do the
[1:26:40] same for everyone.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; But there's a big difference just just
[1:26:46] to be clear. There's a big difference
[1:26:47] between
[1:26:49] just making it a mockery and just coming
[1:26:52] around and having an attitude a chip on
[1:26:54] your shoulder or whatever because
[1:26:56] whatever happened in life and you don't
[1:26:59] preach about the deep things or
[1:27:00] whatever, whatever. We we can have many
[1:27:02] different perspectives and I get that.
[1:27:07] But just trust the Lord.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Just trust that the Lord will minister
[1:27:11] to the need. And if we can do that, I
[1:27:14] believe that we will see these gifts
[1:27:16] manifest in the body. And and it's not
[1:27:19] about seeing the gifts manifest in the
[1:27:21] body as much as keeping the body clean.
[1:27:24] This is the point that I want to make.
[1:27:25] This is what he said here. Then these
[1:27:27] other nine spiritual gifts should be
[1:27:30] operating in the church to keep the
[1:27:32] church clean like Ananas and Safirus.
[1:27:35] And you know that reference is a very
[1:27:37] powerful one because both Ananas and
[1:27:40] Safirus they died. They died because
[1:27:43] they lied. They died because they were
[1:27:46] greedy. They died because they had lust
[1:27:49] for money. They died because they were
[1:27:51] not willing to be completely
[1:27:53] surrendered. But yet they were coming
[1:27:54] around and hanging out with the
[1:27:55] believers. They loved the atmosphere.
[1:27:57] They probably loved the food. They loved
[1:27:59] everything that was going on. But yet
[1:28:01] they just couldn't totally surrender.
[1:28:05] like Ananas and Safirus and so forth,
[1:28:07] the spirit of God rise up and call
[1:28:12] somebody out and tell them they're
[1:28:15] living wrong
[1:28:17] and rebuke that sin openly. And that's
[1:28:20] what the Holy Spirit is in the church
[1:28:22] for,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; to keep the church clean and ready for
[1:28:26] the coming of the Lord. We believe that.
[1:28:29] We believe that, don't we believe that?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; We believe that.
[1:28:34] Now then there are these other gifts
[1:28:37] that comes into the church. Now after
[1:28:40] the pastor then there's the evangelist
[1:28:42] comes in and then there's teachers comes
[1:28:44] in and then there's prophets come in.
[1:28:46] Then there are apostles come in. All
[1:28:49] these together working together with the
[1:28:52] gifts keep the church perfected and
[1:28:55] clean and ready for the coming of the
[1:28:58] Lord.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] I think it's so beautiful to think that
[1:29:02] this this is his way of keeping the
[1:29:05] church clean. This is the actual house
[1:29:08] cleaning. And you know, brothers and
[1:29:09] sisters, I'll say it this way. It's not
[1:29:11] always going to be somebody standing up
[1:29:13] in church and speaking in tongues who
[1:29:15] has been tested and then they're going
[1:29:16] to interpret and we're going to hear as
[1:29:18] a prophecy that comes for the church and
[1:29:21] someone's going to be called out because
[1:29:22] they're living in sin. We could have a
[1:29:24] brother actually just simply call
[1:29:26] another brother and just be having a
[1:29:28] conversation and not even fully realize
[1:29:31] the the conversation, the direction that
[1:29:33] it's going and suddenly they start
[1:29:35] hitting on something that's going on
[1:29:37] clearly directly exactly in that other
[1:29:39] brother's life. It could be exactly like
[1:29:41] that in a sister's life. A sister calls
[1:29:43] a sister and suddenly they start talking
[1:29:46] and then suddenly the one sister is
[1:29:48] like, "How did you know that? Why did
[1:29:49] you know that? How could you possibly
[1:29:51] know that thing in my life? Somebody
[1:29:52] must have told you. Somebody must have
[1:29:54] been talking. Guess what? The Holy
[1:29:56] Spirit is actually acting through the
[1:29:59] body.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It's not always a big show. Many times
[1:30:03] it's a private affair. In fact, that's
[1:30:04] what the prophet said the third pull
[1:30:06] would be is a total private affair. It's
[1:30:09] not going to be a public show.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; But I think the the most effective and
[1:30:14] and and we can see it when it happens
[1:30:17] from the pulpit when there's a minister
[1:30:18] ministering. Sometimes it feels like
[1:30:21] someone's talking about us. Someone's
[1:30:23] telling all of our stuff. And you know
[1:30:25] what? That's not happening. It's the
[1:30:27] same thing as the king of Syria. He was
[1:30:29] like, "Who's who's telling what's going
[1:30:31] on? I've got a spy in my camp. Someone
[1:30:34] is telling this prophet of Israel what's
[1:30:37] going on in my bed chamber." But someone
[1:30:40] had to say to him, "No, he's actually
[1:30:42] he's actually a prophet of the living
[1:30:44] God of Israel." And God tells him these
[1:30:47] things. It's the same thing. The same
[1:30:49] spirit, brothers and sisters, that's
[1:30:51] here tonight with us
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; in Matthew 7:8. For everyone that
[1:30:56] askketh receiveth, and he that seeketh
[1:30:59] findeth, and to him that knockketh it
[1:31:02] shall be opened,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; or what man is there of you whom,
[1:31:09] if his son ask bread, will he give him a
[1:31:13] stone?
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to pause there. I'll
[1:31:17] I'll invite the musicians as we close
[1:31:19] tonight.
[1:31:21] What man is there of you? How many of us
[1:31:24] here tonight, if our son asked us for
[1:31:28] bread, he would ask because he's hungry?
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Daddy, I'm hungry.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And and we would just give him a stone.
[1:31:35] Would we do that? I don't think we would
[1:31:37] ever do that. We would never give him a
[1:31:39] stone. Or if he asked for a fish, I
[1:31:41] don't want carbs tonight. I want some
[1:31:43] protein, daddy. some of that some of
[1:31:45] that really good fish that you do the
[1:31:47] way you do it. If he asked for a fish,
[1:31:49] would he give him a serpent?
[1:31:52] If ye then being evil know how to give
[1:31:55] good gifts to your children, imagine
[1:31:57] that.
[1:31:59] If if we being evil know how to give
[1:32:01] good gifts to our children, remember the
[1:32:03] word evil isn't necessarily being out in
[1:32:06] a in a in a pentagram and witchcraft and
[1:32:09] and candles. It's not that. It's one
[1:32:12] word off. One word off. And I want to
[1:32:16] say this tonight. Maybe having one
[1:32:18] attitude off. One attitude in our heart
[1:32:22] off is going to be evil. If ye then
[1:32:26] being evil know how to give good gifts
[1:32:28] to our children, how much more shall
[1:32:32] your father which is in heaven give good
[1:32:34] things to them that ask him?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:38] I just want to encourage us tonight,
[1:32:39] brothers and sisters, don't be afraid of
[1:32:41] the gifts and don't be afraid of asking
[1:32:43] the giver if you need a gift
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; because he'll give it.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; But we don't want to put gifts out there
[1:32:50] front and center. We don't want to be a
[1:32:53] gift machine. This isn't about making
[1:32:55] God show for anything for anyone. It's
[1:32:58] about providing our needs when we have
[1:33:00] them.
[1:33:02] Verse 12 says, "Therefore, all things
[1:33:04] whatsoever ye would that men should do
[1:33:07] to you,
[1:33:09] do ye even so to them.
[1:33:13] For this is the law and the prophets."
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Don't think that we're going to actually
[1:33:18] go out and behave one way for ourselves
[1:33:20] and the rest of the world is going to
[1:33:22] get something different. Everyone should
[1:33:24] actually pander to me and give me the
[1:33:26] best deals and everything should flow my
[1:33:28] way, my way, my way. But when somebody
[1:33:30] else actually has the opportunity, no,
[1:33:33] no, no, no. The way that we want to see
[1:33:36] this happen is for everyone to be
[1:33:38] beneficiaries of this blessing. Right?
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Maybe stand with me as we close tonight.
[1:33:43] In Ephesians 4:8 says, "Wherefore he
[1:33:45] saith, when he ascended up on high, he
[1:33:48] led captivity captive, and he gave gifts
[1:33:51] unto men. The captivity part is gone and
[1:33:55] he has freely given unto us all of
[1:33:59] himself. We're not going to limit
[1:34:01] ourselves to just gifts in the body.
[1:34:04] Brothers and sisters, I'm not saying
[1:34:05] that at all. But what I am saying is
[1:34:08] when we do see these gifts manifest,
[1:34:10] let's not be afraid of them and
[1:34:11] understand that they're actually
[1:34:12] supposed to be there. It's God
[1:34:15] identifying himself in the body. That's
[1:34:17] what the prophet said. God richly bless
[1:34:20] you all tonight. Let's just bow in
[1:34:22] prayer.
[1:34:24] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:34:26] you tonight for your word.
[1:34:29] Thank you, Lord Jesus, for your
[1:34:31] leadership and your guidance in our
[1:34:32] lives, Lord. And
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Father, so many times we get busy in
[1:34:37] this world. And Father, we let the
[1:34:40] things of this world
[1:34:42] sometimes even get out of hand in our
[1:34:44] lives. Yes, Lord. And father, when that
[1:34:47] happens, it causes so much pressure in
[1:34:50] our minds. It causes so much pressure in
[1:34:53] our hearts.
[1:34:54] It causes so much pressure in our homes
[1:34:57] that we just don't even know what way to
[1:34:59] turn. But we know that, Father, you are
[1:35:02] always right where we left you.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And if we could just
[1:35:08] Oh, Lord Jesus. Just like that
[1:35:10] backsliden prophet that time in the in
[1:35:12] the belly of that fish, Lord. And every
[1:35:15] single direction that he looked, he saw
[1:35:17] belly. And every single time he smelled,
[1:35:20] he smelled the inards of that belly. And
[1:35:23] he just simply saw seaweed and all of
[1:35:26] the natural circumstance. But father, he
[1:35:28] remembered that if he could just look
[1:35:30] towards Jerusalem, if he could look
[1:35:32] towards that holy temple, oh father,
[1:35:35] that you would deliver him no matter
[1:35:37] where he was. Father, tonight I pray
[1:35:39] that Lord, us having the true open word,
[1:35:43] you yourself, the giver. Help us, Lord,
[1:35:46] in the midst of our battles, in the
[1:35:48] midst of our trials, in the midst of our
[1:35:50] tribulations, Lord, Father, to look to
[1:35:53] you directly for our sovereign help in
[1:35:56] our time of trouble. Because we know
[1:35:58] that you will give us that help.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; But, Father, we know that you wait for
[1:36:02] us to come to a place where we're beyond
[1:36:05] our pride.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Help us to get beyond ourselves, Lord
[1:36:09] Jesus. Help us to go beyond our own
[1:36:12] camps and our minds and our hearts,
[1:36:14] Lord, to the place where we trust you
[1:36:16] with all of our heart, Lord. And we
[1:36:18] don't lean onto our own understanding,
[1:36:20] thinking that it has to be a certain
[1:36:22] way, but trusting you in all that we do,
[1:36:25] Father, because then we know that you
[1:36:27] will direct our paths. You will show us
[1:36:29] the right way to go. You will lead us to
[1:36:32] deliverance from whatever the problem is
[1:36:34] in our lives. Father, tonight we thank
[1:36:37] you for your deliverance.
[1:36:39] Thank you for those 39 stripes that you
[1:36:42] took for us, Lord. Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; For our healing, Lord Jesus, not just in
[1:36:46] our body, but in our minds. And not just
[1:36:48] in our body and our minds, but in our
[1:36:50] very souls. Father, we're so thankful
[1:36:53] for your goodness to us. We pray now,
[1:36:55] Lord, that you would just keep your hand
[1:36:57] upon us as we go our separate ways.
[1:36:59] Lord, if it be your will for us to
[1:37:01] gather again on Sunday, we'll be careful
[1:37:03] to give you the praise. Father, tonight
[1:37:05] we just also pray for those who are
[1:37:07] traveling that you would keep your hands
[1:37:09] upon them, Lord. Father, those who are
[1:37:13] maybe working or sick in their bodies or
[1:37:16] maybe just in their minds, Lord, so they
[1:37:18] can't come to service, whatever it is,
[1:37:20] Father. Lord, we pray that you would
[1:37:22] just be with them tonight, too, Father.
[1:37:24] Lord, that you would sovereignly bring
[1:37:26] peace and and encouragement to them,
[1:37:29] Lord Jesus. that Father, if it's your
[1:37:32] will for us to gather again on Sunday,
[1:37:33] that Lord, we'll just have that courage
[1:37:35] and strength to to get back up, Lord,
[1:37:38] and come and worship you with all that
[1:37:40] you have placed in us.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you. We
[1:37:44] just ask all these things now in Jesus
[1:37:47] Christ's name we pray.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:53] Amen.
[1:37:56] I stand in awe of you. You are beautiful
[1:38:01] beyond
[1:38:03] description,
[1:38:06] Lord. Too marvelous
[1:38:10] for words.
[1:38:14] You're too wonderful
[1:38:16] for comprehension
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:22] like nothing ever seen or heard?
[1:38:29] Who can grasp your infinite wisdom?
[1:38:37] Who can fathom the depths of your heart?

[1:38:49] description
