[51:19] traveling mercies the Lord was gracious
[51:21] to us we had no issues or problems and
[51:24] we went directly from service on
[51:27] Wednesday a week ago and found ourselves
[51:30] in Ohio and it's really meant a lot to
[51:33] me personally I've heard so much about
[51:36] Ohio over the
[51:38] years through our former Pastor brother
[51:42] Ken and his
[51:44] family and his in-laws just so the area
[51:49] is so rich with family Brother Paul's
[51:51] family lives there and it's just amazing
[51:55] it was amazing to be there and
[51:56] fellowship with the Believers but I'll
[51:58] tell you something there's nothing
[52:00] better than coming home and being with
[52:01] our family and I call you my family
[52:04] today this is where it's at and I'm so
[52:08] thankful for each and every one of you
[52:10] God bless you
[52:11] today I just want to bring greetings
[52:13] from the Saints at True Word Tabernacle
[52:16] in bluon Ohio that's the church we were
[52:18] at last Sunday we took the service at
[52:21] brother Wayne's request his invitation
[52:23] and uh you know thank you once again for
[52:25] your prayers the Lord certainly came on
[52:28] the
[52:29] scene but Brother Ray Ericson and
[52:31] brother Wayne Lawson both the pastors of
[52:33] that church send their greetings to each
[52:35] and every one of you here and uh brother
[52:38] Wayne said he'll come and see us he'll
[52:40] come and visit and uh just take a couple
[52:43] services with us we're certainly
[52:45] thankful for each and every uh
[52:48] opportunity we had for Fellowship there
[52:49] I could go on and on I'm not going to do
[52:51] that we just had a couple things we have
[52:53] a a prayer request we wanted to bring
[52:55] before the church here for sister
[52:57] Bethany Hatfield that is brother Wayne
[53:00] Lawson's youngest daughter she's having
[53:02] spells and uh they don't know what it is
[53:05] she's in the hospital this morning and
[53:08] they've asked for prayer so we want to
[53:10] remember her sister Bethany Hatfield in
[53:12] Ohio and Sister Mary Carpenter as well
[53:15] as a request for prayer for her
[53:17] body and uh you know before we go to the
[53:22] throne with these
[53:24] requests just like we like to do here we
[53:27] want to bring a praise report this is
[53:30] from Brother
[53:31] Jos and his wife sister Becky and uh he
[53:35] wanted me to read this this morning and
[53:36] I'm thrilled to do it he said we're
[53:38] praising our Lord Jesus Christ for his
[53:40] Mercy in our family on Sunday June the
[53:44] 30th 24 we had an unspoken request for
[53:48] our brother who was elected as the
[53:50] premier of The Province in DRC on May
[53:54] 29th 2024 on June 28th his competitor
[53:59] who lost the election formed some false
[54:02] accusations against our brother now it's
[54:06] interesting because this parallels with
[54:09] what we were preaching here as
[54:11] Christians and Believers of this end
[54:13] time message we brought the case to our
[54:16] God on Sunday June 30th as pastor Barry
[54:20] was preaching it was an answer to our
[54:22] prayer on Monday July 8th the court
[54:25] delivered its verdict and confirmed the
[54:27] election of our brother as a premier of
[54:29] The Province for that reason we are
[54:32] praising our Lord Jesus Christ who
[54:34] delivered our brother and gave him
[54:36] Victory like he did for Daniel Shadrach
[54:39] mesach and
[54:40] Abednego praise be the name of our God
[54:44] forever ni Samu

[1:03:35] me I've gained three Kil three three 3
[1:03:38] Kg since I
[1:03:40] came and uh I don't work I sit study
[1:03:44] walk come back home and I'm putting on
[1:03:49] and I my as as as my profession DET TT
[1:03:52] to me I should not put on
[1:03:56] wait so I'm trying to cut down on my
[1:03:59] feeling and they don't like
[1:04:03] it as I said we want
[1:04:10] to hear from our God the things
[1:04:15] that he has done over the years am to
[1:04:19] bring us to the hour that we are in and
[1:04:24] to be the presence
[1:04:26] that we are in in our part of the world
[1:04:28] Amen to encourage you that Jesus Christ
[1:04:32] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:34] amen and that as he walks in Canada amen
[1:04:38] that's the same way he walks in Africa
[1:04:41] yes and we want
[1:04:44] to encourage
[1:04:46] ourselves to know that God has more for
[1:04:51] us to manifest in US
[1:04:56] as the young man and the young sister
[1:05:01] sang we want to see that everything that
[1:05:05] we are called to do in the gospel work
[1:05:09] yes God lays it down for us as if we are
[1:05:13] to do them
[1:05:15] ourselves but he laid them them down for
[1:05:18] us to show to us that what he had been
[1:05:21] in the past he is today and he will be
[1:05:24] tomorrow amen
[1:05:26] and if it was he who did it in the past
[1:05:29] he's getting us to
[1:05:31] know and be relaxed and be assured that
[1:05:35] he himself will do it in our lives
[1:05:39] today the other way to look at it which
[1:05:43] are human wisdom and the things that we
[1:05:46] see around us make us to think is that
[1:05:49] God employed us asra Paul will employ
[1:05:52] somebody in his office and then give him
[1:05:57] the schedule of Duty and make that
[1:05:59] person to do
[1:06:01] it it is not
[1:06:04] that amen it is he that's right who
[1:06:09] employs us as partners in the
[1:06:13] business who tells us what to do it is
[1:06:17] he that will incline our hearts to do it
[1:06:21] is he that will Empower us to do
[1:06:24] it and then
[1:06:26] is he that will get the glory because he
[1:06:28] will share his glory with no
[1:06:31] man that's the testimony I want to give
[1:06:34] I'm talking about the missionary talk
[1:06:37] the testimony of the word of God the
[1:06:41] subject is the attitude of people to
[1:06:46] revivals and the driving thoughts is
[1:06:50] that God wants a ready Church a church
[1:06:53] that is ready right
[1:06:56] a church that God can by the
[1:07:00] N call to
[1:07:03] duty which he has taught them how to do
[1:07:06] and would do it in
[1:07:09] them but it requires one
[1:07:12] thing and that's just one
[1:07:15] thing that is our
[1:07:17] surrender our surrender is the strength
[1:07:20] of our
[1:07:21] obedience obedience is the first law in
[1:07:24] heaven
[1:07:27] and when we can get to
[1:07:30] that we get to that by our
[1:07:33] consecration our consecration comes from
[1:07:37] the intimacy that we have with
[1:07:40] him how often we are before him how
[1:07:44] often we can
[1:07:47] obey
[1:07:49] the appointed
[1:07:51] times the
[1:07:54] solemnities the times of meeting that he
[1:07:57] has proposed in his heart and he has
[1:08:00] shown to us in the books to engage
[1:08:03] ourselves with
[1:08:05] him the reason why we don't have the
[1:08:09] result that we must have I believe is
[1:08:13] because we don't get engaged enough with
[1:08:18] our husbands
[1:08:20] amen as brother Brown would say uh
[1:08:23] sisters please permit me to say this
[1:08:26] when we
[1:08:28] marry if
[1:08:31] we have the husband in
[1:08:34] Nigeria I'm sure I want to see if
[1:08:36] somebody is here it's not here if you
[1:08:39] have somebody if you have the husband in
[1:08:42] Canada and the wife is in
[1:08:44] Nigeria it's not
[1:08:46] possible for a child to come right as
[1:08:51] long as they St
[1:08:53] apart right that's right
[1:08:56] as long as we stay apart from the
[1:08:59] [Applause]
[1:09:01] designated appointed times of fellowship
[1:09:04] with
[1:09:06] him we will have perhaps just one child
[1:09:09] and then we are
[1:09:11] married the other children that must
[1:09:14] come cannot
[1:09:16] come because there's a law of
[1:09:18] God that law talks of a
[1:09:24] meting you must receive something from
[1:09:27] God to empower
[1:09:29] us to do the works of
[1:09:34] God let me read
[1:09:38] this there's going to be a ready
[1:09:41] church as radon has so wonderfully
[1:09:46] talked to us it takes a poet to
[1:09:50] understand the fullness of what another
[1:09:53] poet is saying amen you saw him that he
[1:09:56] was almost
[1:09:58] weeping it's not brother da it is the
[1:10:01] move it is the anointing of the wordss
[1:10:05] that were put together that is what is
[1:10:07] working in him as it did in
[1:10:10] Michelangelo mangalo used his
[1:10:14] hands to do some
[1:10:16] work and
[1:10:19] then he came to a point that he saw what
[1:10:22] was in his heart now
[1:10:25] in a non-living material it was so real
[1:10:29] to him that this one and this one are
[1:10:32] the same thing and in him this one was
[1:10:34] moving was talking was directing the
[1:10:37] children of Israel and he wanted this
[1:10:39] one of his own hands also to
[1:10:43] talk and he said speak Moses his Moses
[1:10:48] could not
[1:10:49] speak because his Moses was
[1:10:52] made by the hands of
[1:10:56] amen but when we become the masterpieces
[1:10:59] of
[1:11:00] God and God wants us to
[1:11:03] speak he doesn't strike us he just Nots
[1:11:07] us amen we understand because it is he
[1:11:11] within us willing and he will do his
[1:11:14] good pleasure
[1:11:16] amen the church is
[1:11:20] ready she's sealed
[1:11:23] in ready to come
[1:11:27] there will be a big outpouring of the
[1:11:30] spirit yes sir to grab that church and
[1:11:35] take her into the skies exactly because
[1:11:39] the
[1:11:40] church the word the
[1:11:44] bride
[1:11:46] Christ his ministry in his
[1:11:49] Brides the ministry of Christ in his
[1:11:53] Brides amen
[1:11:55] which is his
[1:11:57] body the supernatural
[1:12:00] body of his here on the face of the
[1:12:03] Earth spiritual body on Earth his
[1:12:07] spirit is there living in his life right
[1:12:12] out until the church and him becomes one
[1:12:18] yes in the
[1:12:21] wedding that
[1:12:23] wedding is taking place
[1:12:27] right now on
[1:12:28] Earth it will be a
[1:12:32] minority right in it is the rising of
[1:12:35] the Sun the prophet said the bride be
[1:12:37] very very very
[1:12:41] few that will come out in this
[1:12:44] generation she will be Millions when we
[1:12:47] count all the generations of the seven
[1:12:50] Church ages but in this very age she
[1:12:53] will be very very very little and what's
[1:12:56] her
[1:12:58] power now I thank each one of you a few
[1:13:02] moments ago when you are
[1:13:05] singing for you I'm
[1:13:08] praying that's what I want you to
[1:13:10] do is prayer that I depend
[1:13:15] on that's the secret of all the
[1:13:18] mysteries of God
[1:13:21] am that's the key that opens the door to
[1:13:24] everything of
[1:13:26] God is prayer amen if it is then we must
[1:13:31] have
[1:13:31] prayers in every
[1:13:35] situation I want to give a missionary
[1:13:38] talk how we discover the power of
[1:13:41] God
[1:13:43] in the Divine Fellowship that it calls
[1:13:47] us to that brought us to a point to know
[1:13:52] that those things that the prophet said
[1:13:56] they are the absolute truth and when we

[1:14:10] pass Against All Odds if he says we
[1:14:13] should pray every
[1:14:16] moment Against All Odds all the thing
[1:14:19] that he wants me to do is to believe
[1:14:22] that section of the word that portion of
[1:14:25] the word believe it in me allow it to go
[1:14:29] into my heart he himself will see to eat

[1:14:54] him with without us he cannot do

[1:15:18] enjoy in
[1:15:20] the
[1:15:22] gospel that you and I cherish
[1:15:26] so much that will call the message of
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:31] hour it is not

[1:15:37] religion is not a
[1:15:40] history it's a living fact right it's a
[1:15:44] living

[1:15:48] experience as it was in the days of
[1:15:51] Judah amen shall We rise up to read from
[1:15:55] First

[1:16:16] verse to the 61st verse
[1:16:26] blessed be the Lord that has given rest
[1:16:28] unto His People
[1:16:30] Israel according to all that he
[1:16:33] promised there has not filed one one
[1:16:37] word of all his good promise which he

[1:17:12] seated and may the Lord Jesus Christ add
[1:17:15] his Blessing to the reading of that
[1:17:17] portion of his
[1:17:18] word as a background to my testimony the
[1:17:22] testimony of the word of God I will also
[1:17:25] from Exodus 1ter 7 verse1 Exodus
[1:17:34] 71 I hope I'm not I will not be nervous
[1:17:37] because I want to talk of 40 50 years
[1:17:41] and I don't know how I will put that in
[1:17:43] 45 minutes but I trust that God will
[1:17:46] help
[1:17:50] me this is God's testimony to Moses and
[1:17:55] the Lord said unto Moses see I've made
[1:17:59] thee a God to
[1:18:01] pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be
[1:18:05] thy
[1:18:07] prophets if we connect that to
[1:18:09] Revelation
[1:18:12] 10 verse 8 to verse
[1:18:17] 11 I'll make you
[1:18:20] God in the beginning was the word and
[1:18:22] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:18:25] God and the word became flesh and it
[1:18:28] dwelt amongst
[1:18:30] us and it came
[1:18:34] down with a book in his hand a closed
[1:18:37] book in his
[1:18:39] hand and when it open when it was closed
[1:18:42] in Revelation 5 it opened Revelation 10
[1:18:45] he brought it on Earth brother bramham
[1:18:48] was there and when he delivered to his
[1:18:50] servants he gave a commandment from
[1:18:53] Heaven to you and to me
[1:18:56] that we should take the book from the
[1:18:58] hand of he who has it amen and then we
[1:19:04] should take it and eat it
[1:19:08] all and when we eat it all that same God
[1:19:12] that was once in flesh will dwell in us
[1:19:15] and when he dwells in us at the end we
[1:19:18] will
[1:19:18] prophesy Moses and Aaron in one man
[1:19:25] the seed in that man in that woman and
[1:19:29] then when
[1:19:30] it goes through its process it will
[1:19:33] bring forth Amen in that man the word
[1:19:37] will come out in
[1:19:40] life in
[1:19:42] living and what will be will be God
[1:19:49] Amen as brother I think it was brother
[1:19:53] FF Bosworth
[1:19:55] illustrating it to the prophet said it
[1:19:58] will
[1:19:59] be if you take God all Mighty to be the
[1:20:03] mighty
[1:20:05] ocean the god that will be in brother
[1:20:08] Paul or in brother Dan will be a
[1:20:11] teaspoon yes or even a desert spoon or
[1:20:14] even a seven spoon or even a whole pale
[1:20:17] out of the mighty ocean but it will be
[1:20:22] the same not in qu quantity
[1:20:25] but be the same in
[1:20:29] equality and whatever he does in his
[1:20:33] majesty in the glory of his Beauty he
[1:20:36] can come again and do it in that little
[1:20:39] measure according to the measure of
[1:20:41] Faith given to that person
[1:20:45] amen that is what we want to speak about
[1:20:52] amen the journey
[1:20:58] of
[1:20:59] life in our part of the world the part
[1:21:02] that I know very
[1:21:04] well is the southwest of Nigeria or let
[1:21:08] me say Nigeria Because by the grace of
[1:21:11] God I travel around the
[1:21:13] country
[1:21:14] and in a little measure the
[1:21:19] southwest of Africa including from
[1:21:24] Cameroon
[1:21:25] to
[1:21:27] Gambia that would be about the size
[1:21:31] of maybe half of United
[1:21:36] States to see how God helped
[1:21:40] us in Nigeria in about
[1:21:44] 1933 there was a Pentecostal
[1:21:47] Revival brother abrah told one of the
[1:21:50] Brethren whose father had a small gift
[1:21:55] that in 1933 when the angel met him
[1:21:59] God gave a
[1:22:03] measure of the gift that was upon him
[1:22:07] around the world we had a man in Nigeria
[1:22:10] Joseph babala was his name he was a
[1:22:13] Methodist who when he was about his
[1:22:16] duty the Lord met
[1:22:19] him and then lifted him up and he
[1:22:23] brought the
[1:22:25] Pentecostal Revival of the return of the
[1:22:30] gifts of the Holy Ghost back to our
[1:22:33] nation and it spread like wildfire God
[1:22:37] was on the
[1:22:38] Move 40 years after that 73 we were in
[1:22:43] college and another wave came as we know
[1:22:48] in the pattern of God another wave came
[1:22:51] and then it went around the SE students
[1:22:54] in University and
[1:22:57] uh schools of Higher Learning and that
[1:23:01] was where our generation
[1:23:04] was uh sister fi's
[1:23:08] generation and such
[1:23:12] like amen we give our lives to
[1:23:17] Christ he gave us the assurance that we
[1:23:19] have given our lives to him
[1:23:24] and so young men young women who were
[1:23:29] caught in the
[1:23:31] fire of that
[1:23:34] Revival and God inclined our hearts as
[1:23:38] we read
[1:23:39] in first king God inclined our hearts to
[1:23:44] know that his will must be done in our
[1:23:49] lives and he gave us the grace to follow
[1:23:53] lime by
[1:23:56] line at that
[1:23:58] time we had Revival also in
[1:24:03] America so we had a lot of American
[1:24:06] evangelists TL
[1:24:09] Osborne Tommy
[1:24:11] Hicks V grants
[1:24:15] mauriceo uh
[1:24:17] non uh White a whole lot of
[1:24:20] them coming to
[1:24:23] Nigeria and because at some point in our
[1:24:26] own
[1:24:27] lives I was 17 when I gave my life to
[1:24:32] Christ more were less in age than
[1:24:36] myself but at that time the influence of
[1:24:40] the move of
[1:24:42] God overtook us amen and we were at
[1:24:47] those young ages to be able to stand
[1:24:50] alone our parents refused us they were
[1:24:53] not going to pay our goofies they were
[1:24:55] not going to take care of us but
[1:24:59] something in us which was the spirit of
[1:25:01] God made us to know that Jesus will do
[1:25:05] it even though we didn't know where it
[1:25:09] would come from but what would come from
[1:25:12] our mouth variously was that Jesus would
[1:25:14] do it Jesus would do it we did not have
[1:25:17] any work we did not have any means of
[1:25:19] doing
[1:25:21] it the unfailing god
[1:25:25] did not fail
[1:25:27] us their parents knew that these
[1:25:30] children have come to stay with their
[1:25:37] belief the gospel that were believed
[1:25:40] changed our manners of
[1:25:43] dressing our manner of talking it was
[1:25:46] just the
[1:25:48] wave of gifts that came it didn't come
[1:25:53] with the perfect word
[1:25:56] but the move that it was the move of God
[1:26:00] had an impact a positive impact on our
[1:26:08] living from there we were wi to what is
[1:26:13] very popular in our nation and across
[1:26:16] the Southwest coast of Africa as the Su
[1:26:21] the scripture Union
[1:26:24] the scriptural Union was and is still a
[1:26:29] Christian and Inter
[1:26:31] denominational Evangelical Christian
[1:26:34] group that mastered at our time mastered
[1:26:37] only John
[1:26:40] 3:16 and perhaps the
[1:26:45] gospels when were taught Romans or from
[1:26:49] Ephesians it was just KY they mastered
[1:26:54] the
[1:26:56] gospels and one of the common words was
[1:27:02] that read your Bible every day read your
[1:27:05] Bible and pray every day read your Bible
[1:27:08] and pray every day so we were taught
[1:27:12] that we must read our
[1:27:15] Bibles which we now today know as Clos
[1:27:19] book but we were reading the Clos books
[1:27:22] and God was speaking to us amen in our
[1:27:25] little little
[1:27:29] functions
[1:27:32] then by
[1:27:34] 76 the message came to the message of
[1:27:38] brother Braham came to Nigeria this is
[1:27:41] the manner in which it
[1:27:43] came brother Tommy Lee
[1:27:46] Osborne came to
[1:27:50] Nigeria a wonderful man of God
[1:27:55] he brought to
[1:27:57] Nigeria let me
[1:28:00] say
[1:28:02] hundreds of
[1:28:06] motorcycle hundreds of electric power
[1:28:10] generating
[1:28:13] sets T
[1:28:16] of uh Jeep SUVs which was then a Land
[1:28:22] Rover
[1:28:25] and then hundreds of
[1:28:29] uh projectors and it brought hundreds
[1:28:33] also of his eight
[1:28:37] films we had the meeting
[1:28:41] in a
[1:28:44] Stadium University students poly Technic
[1:28:47] students were there who were Christians
[1:28:51] and obviously those who are not
[1:28:53] Christians also be
[1:28:55] there and so he gave out at the end he
[1:28:58] gave out to some people the the the the
[1:29:02] the the the the Land
[1:29:05] Rovers distributed all these things for
[1:29:08] evangelism in
[1:29:10] Nigeria and in the countries around us
[1:29:14] incidentally we had we have French
[1:29:16] countries surrounding our
[1:29:20] nation except in the South where we have
[1:29:23] the sea
[1:29:24] so he advised us to learn French because
[1:29:28] he believed that Nigeria is going to
[1:29:30] evangelize West Africa and
[1:29:33] Africa so the race
[1:29:36] began it was a very very healthy
[1:29:39] race a race that had no competition in
[1:29:43] it but to serve the Lord amen so in our
[1:29:46] young age we were detailed to serve God
[1:29:53] we were challenged alleng to serve God
[1:29:55] we are challenged to spend everything
[1:29:57] that we have to serve God am still in
[1:30:01] the University at that time it fell our
[1:30:04] part to go to the
[1:30:07] prisons our parents are not
[1:30:10] supportive we didn't have any church to
[1:30:12] support us the only where we can only
[1:30:15] portion that we can get money from for
[1:30:18] transport from our school to the prisons
[1:30:21] and back is to a portion our feed
[1:30:25] money so some of us decided that we will
[1:30:27] not take breakfast all through the weeks
[1:30:31] we'll save the money to go and minister
[1:30:33] to we have the privilege and honor to
[1:30:36] minister to those who are little little
[1:30:39] criminals young young criminals and
[1:30:42] those who had uh life
[1:30:45] prisoners to minister to those who have
[1:30:48] life life imprisonment in our nation or
[1:30:51] they condemned to death it takes a
[1:30:54] special
[1:30:56] favor somehow they allowed Us
[1:30:59] in and we're able
[1:31:02] to at least tell them
[1:31:05] knowing nothing about the message at
[1:31:08] that time but what we knew served the
[1:31:12] purpose you were able to leave
[1:31:15] school and go for evangelism in The
[1:31:19] Villages and in the towns and the
[1:31:22] testimony of some of us
[1:31:25] was that when they come back and there
[1:31:28] will be exams next week they will
[1:31:31] sleep and God will download the
[1:31:35] questions for them so they will study
[1:31:38] the questions we have amongst them
[1:31:41] making first class in the
[1:31:46] University God began to let us know that
[1:31:50] we must evangelize
[1:31:54] we must tell what we know to others and
[1:31:58] it doesn't take big
[1:32:00] programs it just takes a few of you to
[1:32:03] go and
[1:32:05] uh stand somewhere we didn't have
[1:32:09] guitars and keyboards at that time but
[1:32:12] we have God's
[1:32:13] Own 10 string
[1:32:19] instrument I will make joyfulness to God
[1:32:22] I can remember now
[1:32:24] one time went to a village and it's we
[1:32:29] lighted in front of a house a small
[1:32:33] piece of ground front of the house and
[1:32:36] we singing and talking about Jesus we
[1:32:39] didn't know that the house behind us was
[1:32:42] the house of a witch
[1:32:48] Master the name of Jesus Christ does not
[1:32:51] match does not doil with what he's doing
[1:32:56] and he thought that now I can become
[1:32:58] bigger in this Village by killing these
[1:33:02] children getting something to happen to
[1:33:04] them and then people will know that yes
[1:33:08] I have
[1:33:10] power we didn't know anything was
[1:33:12] happening in his
[1:33:17] house we
[1:33:19] contined singing and preaching the man
[1:33:22] came out and came penitently out and he
[1:33:27] called a few of us and said
[1:33:29] please I beg you I you please leave my
[1:33:34] my front front
[1:33:36] Court we didn't know what was happening
[1:33:39] he told us the story that he had been
[1:33:41] trying to charm
[1:33:44] us but he had been
[1:33:46] failing his Devils have told you that
[1:33:48] these ones you can't touch
[1:33:50] them am by the grace of God we all also
[1:33:54] now knew that we shouldn't be too
[1:33:57] obstinate we shouldn't be obstinate we
[1:34:01] assed to his disband we left his court
[1:34:04] to another
[1:34:05] place it left a mark in that Village
[1:34:09] that there's a
[1:34:11] power greater than the power that they
[1:34:15] rever in that
[1:34:17] Village and that by itself encouraged
[1:34:21] us to know that we are not just going
[1:34:25] out to preach the gospel that the Su
[1:34:31] have given to us which was just live
[1:34:34] right you must don't fornicate don't
[1:34:37] commit adultery which you didn't have
[1:34:39] power to not to
[1:34:40] do but they told us the word came but we
[1:34:45] knew ourselves that we didn't have power
[1:34:47] to stop those things that's right but
[1:34:51] with all that we have we are trying to
[1:34:53] serve him
[1:34:55] when brother Tio
[1:34:57] came in giving his testimony of his own
[1:35:01] Ministry that evening he mentioned a
[1:35:06] name he told us what I Now understand we
[1:35:10] now understood where we now enter the
[1:35:13] message the story of the the the Poland
[1:35:19] Oregon
[1:35:22] madman right
[1:35:24] he said he saw a small American
[1:35:28] man that that man came he just
[1:35:31] spoke that was the first time we in our
[1:35:35] little group had the name William Miriam
[1:35:38] Branham that was in
[1:35:40] 1974 and after that
[1:35:44] meeting of brother Tiel
[1:35:47] Osborne it was gone that was we had it
[1:35:50] once and then it was gone
[1:35:54] but later on in
[1:35:58] 76 a brother came to our
[1:36:02] school and he brought two
[1:36:05] books he brought the scroll of brother
[1:36:10] Neil frisbee I don't know if anybody has
[1:36:13] heard about him he's also an American
[1:36:16] he's also a believer of the message I
[1:36:19] believe one of the FKS that derailed
[1:36:20] from the message who believe that he
[1:36:24] brother Braham was Malachi 45 and 6 but
[1:36:29] being that brother Bram died he was now
[1:36:32] to be Revelation
[1:36:35] 10:7 and in his
[1:36:38] books he will qu the prophet profusely
[1:36:41] he will say let the prophet himself
[1:36:43] speak and then he quote paragraphs of
[1:36:46] brother Abraham in his
[1:36:50] Cru at that time
[1:36:53] we were getting
[1:36:56] tired
[1:36:58] of the Pentecostal
[1:37:01] move because the Pentecostal move was
[1:37:04] not satisfying what God placed in our
[1:37:08] hearts the desire that is started in our
[1:37:12] justification in in in in we met him or
[1:37:16] let me say he met us in fullness that
[1:37:19] our sins were gone and that we must live
[1:37:22] right and I was taking us somewhere we
[1:37:25] didn't know the way like Philip said
[1:37:27] Lord show us the
[1:37:29] way we didn't know the way but we knew
[1:37:32] that it was taking us
[1:37:34] somewhere we were told that it was just
[1:37:36] live right and things but we knew
[1:37:38] innately that something greater was must
[1:37:41] be
[1:37:45] there so when at that time getting tired
[1:37:51] of Pentecostalism
[1:37:54] because in the church we were attending
[1:37:56] at that
[1:37:58] time on the stage the musicians will be
[1:38:01] there and
[1:38:04] then may I say like a
[1:38:06] routine from the corner there we'll be
[1:38:10] singing the song the usual song was uh I
[1:38:14] forgotten the song but it's one of these
[1:38:16] Hallelujah songs
[1:38:18] hallelujah
[1:38:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:26] hallelujah
[1:38:28] hallelujah somebody
[1:38:32] say then somebody would interpret at
[1:38:34] this side but in
[1:38:38] Monday this Pap Papa man will be seen
[1:38:43] doing what is
[1:38:45] ungodly with with with with the with the
[1:38:49] members of the
[1:38:51] choir chister
[1:38:53] will live
[1:38:55] wrong so our hearts knew that the god
[1:38:59] that met
[1:39:02] us at our
[1:39:04] gilgal our time of decision cannot be
[1:39:08] this he cannot call out of call us out
[1:39:11] of that error that nonsense that sin and
[1:39:16] then in
[1:39:17] church we me the same thing so there was
[1:39:21] a
[1:39:22] yearning and we have said we have read
[1:39:24] that it is he who inclines our hearts to
[1:39:31] that what happened when we came back
[1:39:34] from the T meeting we formed a little
[1:39:38] group in my
[1:39:40] school that we want to engage ourselves
[1:39:44] more in what we
[1:39:47] had in the
[1:39:49] meeting and that was that we should pray
[1:39:51] more we should be more Evangelical in
[1:39:55] our thoughts so we
[1:39:57] started a night
[1:40:01] vigil we will leave
[1:40:04] hostel about less than 10 of us or at
[1:40:07] most 12 I can't remember the
[1:40:11] number we were praying and as we were
[1:40:14] praying God was drawing us closer to
[1:40:18] himself things that we thought were
[1:40:21] manageable
[1:40:24] we now saw that they were not manageable
[1:40:26] in the
[1:40:27] Kingdom he began to divide for us what
[1:40:30] is right as he said in Philippians 1 we
[1:40:34] were able
[1:40:35] to try things that
[1:40:38] differ were able to choose things that
[1:40:41] were excellent in our journey to the
[1:40:46] kingdom that was what how the book Seven
[1:40:51] Church ages and the scroll of
[1:40:53] brother n frisbe met
[1:40:57] us somebody cling to the
[1:41:03] scroll when I had what he inclined my
[1:41:06] heart to cling to was the seven Church
[1:41:08] ages
[1:41:10] book when I got the book I was in my
[1:41:14] final years University I didn't go to
[1:41:17] classes for one
[1:41:19] week morning and I finished it I can't
[1:41:22] remember what I read but I believe all
[1:41:24] that are
[1:41:26] [Applause]
[1:41:28] read it made a turning
[1:41:33] point now we see where we are
[1:41:36] going now we know where we are going but
[1:41:40] at the same time bra frisbe books also
[1:41:43] will come bra frisby's book will come in
[1:41:47] big
[1:41:48] numbers the voice of God at that time
[1:41:51] spoken words will release only if you
[1:41:54] get one Salon book in 6
[1:41:58] weeks if you get two in your mail you're
[1:42:02] a
[1:42:03] king because everybody will come to you
[1:42:05] and say as soon as you finish it please
[1:42:07] give it to
[1:42:09] me and so we started
[1:42:12] feeding all be it little by little on
[1:42:16] the message of the
[1:42:18] hour what difference did we
[1:42:21] see you could read other great
[1:42:25] evangelist books you could read two
[1:42:27] three in a day and you are still the
[1:42:30] same
[1:42:32] boy but if you read one of William
[1:42:34] Brown's books you must be on your knees
[1:42:38] you must weep am then we began to see
[1:42:41] the difference how is this one like we
[1:42:44] didn't know what he was we were just
[1:42:46] reading
[1:42:48] books the ones that will come from
[1:42:49] spoken word will be free we spend our
[1:42:52] money to buy
[1:42:53] the ones that came from
[1:42:56] others icept a few of
[1:42:59] them not because of the economic
[1:43:02] economical difference but because of the
[1:43:05] substance that we saw in brother Brown's
[1:43:08] books brother br's books would draw you
[1:43:11] Heavenly it was consistent we began to
[1:43:15] see a pattern of the Bible that was
[1:43:18] unfolding to us
[1:43:21] right and when when the time came we
[1:43:24] decided to do our with others to
[1:43:29] concentrate on what this man amen is
[1:43:35] saying
[1:43:39] hallelujah we married July 1st
[1:43:45] 1978 uh our friends came a year
[1:43:50] after was our wedding anniversary
[1:43:53] for our wedding anniversary our friends
[1:43:55] came to celebrate with us the fellowship
[1:43:58] that we attended at that time we have a
[1:44:00] brother who was a year two years my
[1:44:03] senior in secondary school in high
[1:44:04] school as you call it here and uh he was
[1:44:08] holding that
[1:44:09] church he was called as an
[1:44:13] evangelist in that time in our part of
[1:44:16] the world the ministry in the
[1:44:19] christom that was R highest was was the
[1:44:23] ministry of the Evangelist not because
[1:44:26] of scriptural setting but because of the
[1:44:30] work that they were
[1:44:32] doing it was the Evangelist that would
[1:44:35] go there go here go here so they were
[1:44:38] they were always on the move so that was
[1:44:40] the ministry of that brother but this
[1:44:41] for about 3 weeks before he has been
[1:44:43] telling us that he wants to preach a
[1:44:46] great
[1:44:47] message so on our first wedding
[1:44:50] anniversary we came people came because
[1:44:52] of us so the church was as the church we
[1:44:55] had was full here on last Sunday Fuller
[1:44:59] than this I
[1:45:01] guess so the the the the the the the the
[1:45:04] place that we use for the of for the
[1:45:07] church was filled up and he brought a
[1:45:11] message Elijah the
[1:45:15] prophets he was the if there was anybody
[1:45:19] among the ministers that
[1:45:23] preached and propagated the ministry of
[1:45:27] Neil frisbee that was the
[1:45:30] brother but now after the message began
[1:45:33] to come and he studied he saw that Neil
[1:45:37] frisbee was
[1:45:40] fake to this
[1:45:42] language fake
[1:45:46] news so he
[1:45:48] came and he dropped the
[1:45:51] bombshell what
[1:45:54] how can David say that this and this and
[1:45:56] this and this and
[1:45:57] that but he has said it he went to his
[1:46:00] room and he
[1:46:02] prayed usually like you do here don't
[1:46:06] let me say like you do here much less
[1:46:08] like you do here much less when service
[1:46:12] ends we just
[1:46:14] greet a little social station and then
[1:46:18] you go back
[1:46:19] home but that day nobody greeted
[1:46:23] the other person you took your wife if
[1:46:26] you have you are married go into your
[1:46:28] car go to your
[1:46:30] house because for three and a half years
[1:46:33] of Our Lives we were in
[1:46:36] frisbee we began to see that frisbee was
[1:46:39] not right because partly of the
[1:46:42] doctrines but partly of the life that it
[1:46:45] was bringing
[1:46:47] right young men in the in the because
[1:46:50] were expecting the coming of the Lord
[1:46:52] young men that were University age they
[1:46:56] will leave
[1:46:57] school and then they will take a sister
[1:47:00] and they will start living together as
[1:47:03] husband and wife common
[1:47:04] law
[1:47:07] living
[1:47:09] anointing they will go to the bank at
[1:47:12] that time the briefcase will call it
[1:47:15] portfolio at that time in Nigeria they
[1:47:17] take a briefcase and go to the bank and
[1:47:20] tell the teller fill this with money
[1:47:24] no medicine no Juju
[1:47:27] nothing the power of the words under
[1:47:31] that
[1:47:31] anointing fill it with money he will
[1:47:33] fill it with money and they take it and
[1:47:35] then they comfortably go and then they
[1:47:37] say they have done exploits Daniel 11:32
[1:47:40] those that know their God they shall be
[1:47:42] strong and they will do
[1:47:50] exploits but we knew that that was wrong
[1:47:54] right because it took us from
[1:47:57] sin the foundation was that it took us
[1:48:00] from
[1:48:01] sin by his blood it was taking us
[1:48:04] somewhere we didn't know but we followed
[1:48:07] in the
[1:48:13] journey
[1:48:18] now
[1:48:21] we had a
[1:48:23] separation which was a separation that
[1:48:26] was due right those who wants to serve
[1:48:29] God and those who don't want to serve
[1:48:32] God I made an illustration
[1:48:34] here the attitude of people to
[1:48:38] revivals all that I've been talking
[1:48:41] about is a period of a Revival or
[1:48:44] several revivals within a
[1:48:47] Revival there are two parallel
[1:48:51] lines mathematic tell tells us that two
[1:48:55] parallel lines cannot
[1:48:58] meet if they are parallel
[1:49:01] lines they will never be
[1:49:04] together but in this spiritual paralel
[1:49:08] parallelogram one is going down one is
[1:49:12] going
[1:49:13] up the one going
[1:49:18] down will always be more like the world
[1:49:22] something in their in the Christian
[1:49:26] something in what they believe something
[1:49:28] in what we all believe together they
[1:49:31] will find something there that will be
[1:49:33] adding more weight to them and the
[1:49:36] weight will be lowering them
[1:49:41] down to their AB
[1:49:46] base on the other
[1:49:49] side there will be people there
[1:49:52] that their hearts will be in tuned to
[1:49:55] the things of
[1:49:56] God God will incline their hearts to
[1:50:02] follow him and when they follow him in
[1:50:04] all sincerity he will bring them up and
[1:50:08] they will be joined
[1:50:10] up to the coming of the Lord because
[1:50:14] he's the one that's preparing his
[1:50:17] people so when we came to the
[1:50:20] message now we know that
[1:50:24] frisbe is wrong all other ones they have
[1:50:27] served their purpose they were right
[1:50:28] they were good at their level they
[1:50:32] helped us at their level we couldn't
[1:50:34] have been where we were when we got to
[1:50:36] brother Braham if we didn't pass through
[1:50:40] them but they've their work stopped
[1:50:44] that's why brother brah says that in
[1:50:46] chrisom there are three spheres the
[1:50:49] sublime that's closer to heaven the
[1:50:52] Pentecostal Go full gospel Pentecostals
[1:50:55] and then the
[1:50:56] nominal God took us from the nominal we
[1:51:00] were been nominal by birth by placement
[1:51:04] by Desire by
[1:51:09] love we delighted to go I delighted to
[1:51:14] go with my parents to their church
[1:51:16] because I know there's no power in their
[1:51:18] church when I sin
[1:51:23] and they say we are going to church my
[1:51:25] parents had a church where they told us
[1:51:27] that there was power that God was moving
[1:51:30] there one day I did what was very bad I
[1:51:33] won't mention
[1:51:34] it so I was afraid to go with them to
[1:51:36] church I did all that I could to do not
[1:51:39] to go to church but my father was a
[1:51:41] school principal he was a disciplinarian
[1:51:43] to the
[1:51:44] core he said we must I must come to the
[1:51:47] car I went to the car I was shivering
[1:51:49] literally shivering that thinking that
[1:51:52] when I get to church the gifts will pick
[1:51:55] me when we came back nothing there's
[1:51:57] nothing in the church there's in the
[1:51:59] church you look those things when we
[1:52:04] when we say we are what we are not it
[1:52:07] empowers sin in us that's amen it
[1:52:11] embolden us to
[1:52:13] sin but God right who is reach in
[1:52:19] mercies to reveal his son in me he made
[1:52:23] me to meet the truth we knew from
[1:52:26] Brother Brown's message that there was
[1:52:28] power in the church but where was the
[1:52:31] power
[1:52:33] amen when we were
[1:52:36] now Avid readers of the message as they
[1:52:39] come we will read them we saw the
[1:52:44] principles of
[1:52:46] God which he laid down in his words for
[1:52:50] us to draw closer to him and for the
[1:52:52] power to come the first one we
[1:52:55] discovered was the principle of the
[1:52:57] unchangeability of
[1:53:01] God from our reading of the seven
[1:53:04] books we knew that God does not change
[1:53:09] amen hallelujah and that you cannot
[1:53:12] change him Amen brother Abraham says you
[1:53:15] cannot improve on the message amen amen
[1:53:19] amen it's God's perfect will amen
[1:53:23] Amen in his way in his words and in his
[1:53:28] Essence he cannot be changed and it
[1:53:30] cannot even
[1:53:32] change we took that we put it in our
[1:53:36] breast pocket underneath our fet you
[1:53:39] know what is there it was kept in our
[1:53:42] hearts that's right we also found out
[1:53:45] the inferability of God and his word
[1:53:51] am you can't fault him right he's always
[1:53:55] right he's omnipotent so whatever in our
[1:53:59] growing
[1:54:00] times whatever we had that it was
[1:54:04] God we know it can never change and we
[1:54:07] know it can never be wrong amen no
[1:54:09] matter how it was we know it was his
[1:54:11] will for us no matter how it was
[1:54:14] difficult for us to obey we know it was
[1:54:17] his will for
[1:54:18] us we found out the
[1:54:21] Dy and the Oneness of Christ in the
[1:54:26] godheads amen some of us were to go to
[1:54:30] baptism when we saw baptism in water but
[1:54:34] they told us that it would be in the
[1:54:36] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost we
[1:54:39] have read this man that told us that God
[1:54:42] is one and that will also go
[1:54:45] for baptisma
[1:54:48] lesson because we have at that time we
[1:54:52] didn't have any message church so we
[1:54:54] were attending any any Full Gospel
[1:54:58] Church at that time we didn't see it in
[1:55:01] the Bible because brah has established
[1:55:03] for us that whatever you do must be in
[1:55:06] the Bible we refuse to have baptism in
[1:55:08] their
[1:55:10] midst and
[1:55:13] then we were told that you cannot have
[1:55:18] church if you die who will bury you if
[1:55:20] you if you give bir to children who will
[1:55:22] name your children if you want to
[1:55:24] baptize who will do this we find that
[1:55:26] those were
[1:55:28] just
[1:55:30] obstacles right
[1:55:33] mountains that the SAT the enemy put
[1:55:37] before us we began to think that if this
[1:55:41] is the
[1:55:42] gospel and we are God's children then we
[1:55:46] should not stop only at Fellowship we
[1:55:49] should have our own churches amen amen
[1:55:55] amen amen we did not stop at those he
[1:55:59] showed us the principle of God's being a
[1:56:03] god of
[1:56:05] details when God says put off your shoe
[1:56:10] your sandals from your feet he meant
[1:56:14] sandals God will not see sandals and
[1:56:16] call it
[1:56:17] shoe Moses was wearing sandals that's
[1:56:21] right right Moses knew enough of God to
[1:56:24] know that when God said Sanders it did
[1:56:26] not mean
[1:56:28] Hearts we cut all this from the
[1:56:33] prophet we knew he was a god of details
[1:56:37] so whatever he says is what it means and
[1:56:40] in its
[1:56:43] detail you remember brother brah at the
[1:56:46] beginning of the ministry the first pool
[1:56:49] God gave him a vision he went to that
[1:56:52] house house he prayed for that baby but
[1:56:54] there was to be a Mama Grandmother that
[1:56:56] must pray her glasses here another
[1:56:58] person must be at the door that person
[1:57:00] must be here but in his the youthfulness
[1:57:05] the infancy of the ministry not knowing
[1:57:08] this details of God he brought that
[1:57:10] child and then he prayed thinking that
[1:57:13] the boy will be fine the boy got worse
[1:57:15] that's right then he remembered that you
[1:57:18] are to do what I told you to do exactly
[1:57:23] amen God means what he says he says what
[1:57:28] he means that's what one of the things
[1:57:30] he told us in the seven Church his book
[1:57:32] he says what it means he means what he
[1:57:35] says that's right we began to apply that
[1:57:38] to our
[1:57:39] lives to know that when God says this is
[1:57:43] why you're here should be that is
[1:57:45] exactly what God means am this is how
[1:57:47] your church should be we knew that that
[1:57:50] was exactly what it means our lives
[1:57:54] began to take another turn of
[1:57:57] changes our languages began to change
[1:58:00] our Outlook to life began to change
[1:58:02] because we now learn that that's the
[1:58:04] exactness of God I'm telling you the
[1:58:08] history of what God did in our part of
[1:58:11] the
[1:58:12] world to those who believe that believe
[1:58:17] amen
[1:58:20] amen then
[1:58:23] we learned that every
[1:58:25] seed must bring forth of his
[1:58:29] kind we learn the principle of the
[1:58:31] continuity of
[1:58:33] God that when God starts something doing
[1:58:36] something
[1:58:39] here he would continue it until it comes
[1:58:44] back to
[1:58:45] that start when he plants a
[1:58:49] seed the seed will go through process
[1:58:52] that's right and then come back to se am
[1:58:59] amen it taught
[1:59:01] us patience with
[1:59:04] God it taught us perseverance with God
[1:59:07] it taught us to walk with God whatever
[1:59:10] we see as long as is coming according to
[1:59:13] the pattern of God Amen we should just
[1:59:17] follow
[1:59:17] it we began to see in details how God
[1:59:22] Lives amongst his
[1:59:28] people we also
[1:59:30] Le the
[1:59:33] principle
[1:59:36] of
[1:59:37] God's hiding in
[1:59:41] Simplicity and revealing himself in
[1:59:46] Simplicity we learned that
[1:59:49] humility is a very first sign of the
[1:59:52] baptism of the Holy
[1:59:56] Ghost amen he put us in our position
[2:00:01] amen and to be anything of for God you
[2:00:05] must be humble it's not self-giving
[2:00:08] humility but God given humility the more
[2:00:12] we learn that the more that God was in
[2:00:16] you the more humble you will
[2:00:20] become the more you are accumulating of
[2:00:23] the virtues and the attributes of God
[2:00:26] the more humble you will
[2:00:30] become condescending to Men of lower
[2:00:33] States as brother Paul said
[2:00:36] it then he made us to learn the secret
[2:00:39] of
[2:00:41] prayer
[2:00:43] the first move of the Revival of the
[2:00:48] Holy Ghost to our nation
[2:00:53] the 1933 Revival came with prayer that
[2:00:57] church is a Praying was a Praying
[2:01:02] church that church I have a testimony of
[2:01:05] a brother in our
[2:01:08] church the father in their
[2:01:12] Village you know we have a lot
[2:01:15] of child
[2:01:18] mortality because of diseases poverty
[2:01:22] and
[2:01:24] ignorance which served his purpose in
[2:01:27] our nation but when a child
[2:01:29] dies the people
[2:01:31] learn
[2:01:34] to take the baby the dead baby and put
[2:01:39] it in in the front coat of the church
[2:01:41] and said the God of this church raised
[2:01:44] this
[2:01:45] child do you understand what I mean yeah
[2:01:48] that somebody's child dies
[2:01:52] a few minutes ago and then they have
[2:01:56] seen so much of
[2:01:58] God so much of answered prayers in that
[2:02:02] little village church yes that they will
[2:02:06] pack the
[2:02:07] child and put her down or him down and
[2:02:12] say the god of these people should raise
[2:02:14] the child I want the brother come around
[2:02:17] they know that they have
[2:02:20] as challeng
[2:02:22] them and God in his mercies will raise
[2:02:26] the
[2:02:29] childrenall I said that church was a
[2:02:32] Praying
[2:02:34] church when that Revival fire died down
[2:02:37] because they didn't follow the word of
[2:02:40] God for the season and the time they let
[2:02:45] down in their prayer life and
[2:02:49] so nothing was happening
[2:02:52] they
[2:02:53] became like Samson yes when the power
[2:02:59] was taken
[2:03:00] away though they still have prayer
[2:03:03] meetings but there was no power the god
[2:03:06] of the prayer had gone from
[2:03:09] them we learned that
[2:03:11] God loves secret prayers and learning
[2:03:15] from the mistake of our forefathers in
[2:03:20] that church
[2:03:23] we knew that we must keep him before us
[2:03:26] every time so we knew that there was
[2:03:30] power in prayer amen
[2:03:35] amen
[2:03:38] then having all this together we could
[2:03:41] no more
[2:03:42] operate in the established
[2:03:45] churches so it came to our hearts that
[2:03:48] we could also have our own assembly
[2:03:52] where we will now bring all these things
[2:03:55] that we have learned and we continue to
[2:03:58] learn from the prophet into
[2:04:03] reality so we
[2:04:05] started a local
[2:04:10] assembly we brought in so
[2:04:16] many
[2:04:18] carryovers from our local assembly from
[2:04:20] our old place
[2:04:25] so many carryovers when we get to church
[2:04:28] in the
[2:04:31] morning we sing a few
[2:04:34] songs uh a brother would just say have
[2:04:37] an
[2:04:39] exhortation he would speak another
[2:04:42] person will say have an
[2:04:43] exhortation we knew that in the
[2:04:46] parallelogram or in the body that is
[2:04:48] called The Church some of us by the
[2:04:50] grace of God knew that we it's it's not
[2:04:53] it's not the ecclesial church it's not
[2:04:55] the pure church it's still a gathering
[2:04:58] of
[2:04:59] people and we began to see signs even
[2:05:03] amongst us or people that just took
[2:05:06] church for another social
[2:05:10] Gathering some took church
[2:05:13] for that's just a routine that we are
[2:05:16] from Christian homes and we will follow
[2:05:18] what our parents have been doing
[2:05:23] then God sent the apostolic Ministry in
[2:05:26] our
[2:05:27] midst by the word the Apostolic
[2:05:31] Ministries set us in order Hallelujah
[2:05:36] conduct
[2:05:38] order and Doctrine amen brought us to
[2:05:43] know that the first message of Jesus
[2:05:45] Christ to the church was baptism of the
[2:05:48] Holy Ghost and then they began to preach
[2:05:52] we began to know what the fivefold
[2:05:54] ministry
[2:05:57] was and they were taking their turn
[2:05:59] Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after W
[2:06:02] Wednesday Fridays After Fridays all the
[2:06:04] meeting days which we have
[2:06:07] learned that were
[2:06:10] inseparable from our worship of
[2:06:13] God
[2:06:14] those as the prophet said those meeting
[2:06:18] days were appointed days of the Jehovah
[2:06:22] to meet his people as it
[2:06:25] was composing for the Jews to have the
[2:06:29] seven feasts of the Lord it was together
[2:06:34] with the with the with with with the
[2:06:35] Sabbath it was composing for us also to
[2:06:38] follow those step by step as we saw in
[2:06:41] the prophets
[2:06:44] amen Sunday morning
[2:06:47] service Sunday evening
[2:06:50] service made we prayer meting this vils
[2:06:54] on Friday and all and all like
[2:06:58] that when we saw that there was no more
[2:07:02] any brother saying I
[2:07:03] have exhortation everybody came under
[2:07:07] the word of God a Time came when some
[2:07:10] people could not bear it amen they said
[2:07:13] no and they left the
[2:07:16] church they went out of us because they
[2:07:19] were not part of us hallelujah if they
[2:07:21] have been part of of
[2:07:22] us they would have stayed with
[2:07:26] us not to glory in
[2:07:30] them they started Living
[2:07:33] wrong because they left the protection
[2:07:36] of the word of God of a true complete
[2:07:39] word of God revealed by God's mouthpiece
[2:07:42] for us
[2:07:48] today God did not stop there amen as we
[2:07:53] dig more into the message we began to
[2:07:56] see other things
[2:08:04] other other positions that will must be
[2:08:08] to be always with our
[2:08:15] God we found out that or I found out
[2:08:19] that comparing now and then our times of
[2:08:25] meeting with God has
[2:08:30] increased to what the message says the
[2:08:33] fullness of what the message
[2:08:37] says we started to
[2:08:40] have uh Sunday schools adult Sunday
[2:08:44] schools children Sunday
[2:08:46] schools
[2:08:48] uh adolescent suay schools
[2:08:53] we began to have cuted
[2:08:55] pyrami God inclined our hearts to do the
[2:08:58] things that we saw brother Mar mentioned
[2:09:02] in the books amen this morning we had
[2:09:05] the musician had a meeting we had people
[2:09:08] in our time in our in our place
[2:09:12] surrendering themselves to come to the
[2:09:15] church much earlier than the meeting
[2:09:18] time to find somewhere to pray for the
[2:09:21] meeting
[2:09:25] hours to pray for the meeting why
[2:09:27] because you saw it
[2:09:30] there amen we saw it there and we want
[2:09:34] to be eat it

[2:09:40] angel that has the book has his hands up
[2:09:44] in heaven and eat it all amen amen in
[2:09:48] other words everything there eat it
[2:09:51] because you are going to
[2:09:53] prophesy now this is prophesying time
[2:09:56] this is the time of manifestation of the
[2:09:59] word what you eat is what you can
[2:10:03] manifest and when the hour of
[2:10:05] manifestation comes remember that the
[2:10:08] enemy will still be
[2:10:10] there amen the enemy will be there to
[2:10:12] tell you that it's not done there it's
[2:10:14] not done here it's not done here we
[2:10:16] don't want to see what is done here on
[2:10:18] Earth our prayer has it taught us that
[2:10:21] Lord let thy will be done on Earth as
[2:10:24] it's done in heaven and this is heaven
[2:10:27] to
[2:10:27] us shall we bow our
[2:10:41] heads that's a short cut of 50 years in
[2:10:47] 45 minutes
[2:10:52] there's more that will be
[2:10:55] said we have seen God raise the
[2:10:59] dead have seen God done miracles signs
[2:11:03] and
[2:11:04] wonders we still see
[2:11:10] God
[2:11:12] in the manifestation of his power
[2:11:19] amen it is not
[2:11:23] a strength
[2:11:25] thing and it's not
[2:11:27] seldom that we see

[2:11:54] God I'm telling you what our God does
[2:11:58] and I believe we still do amen when we
[2:12:02] are completely intimate with
[2:12:04] him when we are completely surrendered
[2:12:07] unto him when our
[2:12:10] time you Lord belongs to him amen the
[2:12:15] spending of our time when prayer becomes
[2:12:18] the very breath of Our Lives
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:24] in every
[2:12:26] sphere in every
[2:12:28] condition that they told
[2:12:33] us when people come to our
[2:12:36] homes they we sanctify them by word of
[2:12:40] prayer as it is in the as it was in the
[2:12:45] scriptures why we want to leave our
[2:12:48] homes do we do it as the prophet did
[2:12:54] when we have
[2:12:55] Gatherings do we do it what's the place
[2:12:59] of the word of

[2:13:22] can glorify himself when we ourselves
[2:13:25] are in tune with all his words which we
[2:13:28] are to manifest in this time and season

[2:23:03] people are looking back in the past but
[2:23:06] you know those people who have taken the
[2:23:08] book they've been given the ability to
[2:23:10] recognize what he's doing right now and

[2:23:16] testimony this morning it's just so
[2:23:18] beautiful for him to continually
[2:23:21] understand to continually identify what
