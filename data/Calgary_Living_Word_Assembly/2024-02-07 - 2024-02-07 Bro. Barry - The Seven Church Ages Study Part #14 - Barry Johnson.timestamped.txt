[45:25] just to pick up and do a a little quick
[45:27] overview review of uh the Sevenfold
[45:31] Glory of his person in uh I believe it's
[45:35] part 14 of the exposition of the seven
[45:38] Church
[45:39] ages we'll start reading with
[45:41] Revelations chapter 1
[45:43] verse2 this is John and what he sees
[45:46] when he's in the spirit on the Lord's
[45:48] day and I turned to see the voice that
[45:51] spake with me and being turned I saw
[45:54] seven golden C candlesticks and in the
[45:57] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[46:00] unto the son of man clothed with a
[46:03] garment down to the foot and gird about
[46:06] the paps with a golden
[46:08] girdle his head and his hairs were white
[46:11] like wool as white as snow and his eyes
[46:15] were as a flame of fire and his feet
[46:19] like unto fine brass as if they burned
[46:22] in a furnace and his voice as the sound
[46:25] of many
[46:26] Waters and he had in his right hand
[46:29] Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a
[46:33] sharp two-edged sword and his
[46:36] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[46:39] his strength and when I saw him I fell
[46:43] at his feet as dead and he laid his
[46:45] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[46:49] not I am the first and the last I am he
[46:53] that liveth and was dead
[46:56] and behold I am alive forever more amen
[47:01] and have the keys of hell and death
[47:05] let's just bow one more time Heavenly
[47:08] Father Lord we think about this vision
[47:12] and your majesty as John saw you and
[47:16] father it it takes our breath away when
[47:19] we really think about these images the
[47:22] words that we just heard and father Lord
[47:26] Jesus if any one of us were ever to come
[47:28] that close to you I know that we would
[47:29] fall to our feet as dead fall to the
[47:32] ground Lord but we know that you would
[47:35] have the same words for us to fear not
[47:38] because you are the first and the last
[47:41] you have done it all you have paid it
[47:43] all and father you've done it for us and
[47:47] so tonight we just want to commit the
[47:48] words that are spoken tonight into your
[47:50] hands For Your Glory father help me to
[47:53] get out of the way as we take another
[47:55] step in your word we love you and we
[47:58] thank you we just commit the rest of
[47:59] this service into your hands in Jesus
[48:01] Christ's name we pray amen God bless you

[48:43] Sunday the 18th brother John perzo is
[48:46] going to take the service here brother
[48:48] John perzo is the son of the song leader
[48:50] uh one of the song leaders up at Ed time
[48:53] message Tabernacle and so he has agreed
[48:56] to take the service here and uh
[48:58] Wednesday the 21st brother Toby will
[49:00] take the service so I trust that will be
[49:03] a real blessing to each one um I'm
[49:06] actually going to be a little bit
[49:07] disappointed that I'm not going to be
[49:08] here to hear Brother John but I'll pick
[49:10] up the uh recording afterwards and uh as
[49:13] I said to him when we talked about this
[49:15] this is not the only time that I want to
[49:17] see him come here uh we have a
[49:20] tremendous uh arsenal of ministry in
[49:23] Edmonton and uh I have a couple more
[49:26] ministers up there lined up that I would
[49:28] like to see come down here and I know it
[49:30] will be a blessing to the body so after
[49:33] that we have a Youth Event happening on
[49:35] the 25th at our house after service and
[49:37] we'll have lunch um and then we have the
[49:39] annual gen General men's meeting at the
[49:42] church which is February 29th that will
[49:44] be at 7:30 p.m. so uh are you happy
[49:49] tonight good to be in the house of the
[49:51] Lord you can see the weather is boy it's
[49:55] starting to change slightly and you can
[49:57] see the days are even starting to get a
[49:58] little bit longer and as the days get
[50:01] longer the cold will drag on and uh
[50:04] it'll be a sure sign of spring around
[50:05] here but uh we're certainly thankful
[50:08] that we'll be coming out of winter here
[50:11] soon um I spoke to brother Dwayne fair
[50:13] today and uh had a great conversation we
[50:16] hadn't talked for some time and so he
[50:19] heard that I was coming to town and has
[50:21] teed me up for the service in uh in SAS
[50:25] J on the 18th and I think it's just a
[50:28] wonderful opportunity to be in service
[50:30] for the king and you know brother Dwayne
[50:32] is uh he's been a real part of this
[50:35] assembly here he's uh directly related
[50:38] to Sister Shelley her brother-in-law he
[50:40] married her sister and he's just been a
[50:43] real encouragement to all of us I'm sure
[50:45] and he said to send a very personal
[50:48] greeting to each one tonight make sure
[50:50] you say hello to the church from from me
[50:54] and uh he'll be in Calgary but he's
[50:57] actually going away and he's going to
[50:59] Guatemala he's going to catch up with
[51:01] brother Tito from the end time message
[51:03] Tabernacle in uh Edmonton and they're
[51:05] going to go to Guatemala together so um
[51:08] there may be an opportunity to meet with
[51:10] him when they come back but we'll see so
[51:13] that's it for the announcements um God
[51:15] richly bless you tonight I just would
[51:16] like to do a little bit of a recap and
[51:18] and talk a little bit about where we
[51:20] left off last week I think it's a real
[51:23] important part of what we are talking
[51:25] about when we get into the exposition of
[51:27] the seven Church ages we haven't really
[51:29] done that yet it's more of an
[51:31] introduction as to who is actually
[51:33] speaking about the church ages and I
[51:36] just love the way brother brandham
[51:37] brings that out in this book he takes
[51:40] the time to express so many different
[51:42] things um you know from who who who this
[51:46] really is standing there to getting in
[51:49] the spirit uh we could do a recap and we
[51:52] probably will before we go too much
[51:53] further just about all the high points
[51:56] but uh tonight I just really want to
[51:58] drill down on the Sevenfold Glory of his
[52:00] person and just before that brother
[52:03] bradam says that he is no longer the
[52:05] priest he's been a priest for a long
[52:08] long time but when he sees them in this
[52:11] Vision here and he begins to describe
[52:13] the one that's standing there in the
[52:15] midst of the candlesticks which is the
[52:17] church and how he has the Seven Stars in
[52:20] his right hand and how they are The
[52:21] Messengers to the church how this one
[52:24] that's standing is no longer the
[52:27] intercessor he's no longer the priest
[52:30] he's the judge isn't it beautiful I
[52:32] believe we talked about it I can't even
[52:34] remember now but just recently how our
[52:36] judge is our attorney our attorney is
[52:39] our judge and the judgment's already
[52:41] passed that you have you're you're not
[52:43] guilty you're completely uh free we are
[52:47] free tonight and uh it's just such a
[52:50] beautiful thing but you know brother bam
[52:52] he says here that he is no longer the
[52:53] priest and this is out of the exposition
[52:55] of the seven Church ages it's
[52:56] Revelations 1:3 and in the midst of the
[52:59] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[53:02] of man clothed with a garment down to
[53:04] the foot and Girt about the paps with a
[53:07] golden girdle brother Bram he says there
[53:10] he stands one like unto the son of man
[53:15] Kinfolk one like unto the son of man as
[53:19] the jewel is beautified by the mounting
[53:21] of the ring so he is glorified in the
[53:24] mid of the
[53:26] churches it's at the Lord's day it is
[53:29] the Lord's day for John sees him
[53:31] standing not as a priest but as the
[53:34] coming judge the golden girdle is no
[53:37] longer G around the waist where the
[53:40] priest must wear it as he ministers to
[53:42] God in the holiest place but it is now
[53:46] around his shoulders for he is now for
[53:50] it's around his shoulders for he is not
[53:53] not now the priest but the
[53:56] judge now has John 5:22 come to pass for
[54:00] the father judgeth no man but hath
[54:03] committed all judgment unto the
[54:05] son his service has been rendered the
[54:09] priesthood is over the days of the
[54:12] prophecy are finished he stands girded
[54:15] as the
[54:17] judge I just wanted to lay that down as
[54:20] sort of the foundation for tonight's
[54:22] discussion in the discussion about the
[54:25] Sevenfold Glory of his
[54:28] person and you know I I just it got me
[54:30] thinking about it tonight and and I
[54:32] can't help but think how when we talk
[54:35] about this somehow this has to be real
[54:38] somehow this has to intertwine with our
[54:40] lives there has to be something about it
[54:43] that's going to make us actually learn
[54:45] and grow and and not just come to church
[54:47] and read a scripture and say amen and
[54:50] and leave somehow this has to be
[54:52] applicable to us in our lives and I just
[54:55] can't help but think that you know while
[54:57] we look at this we recognize that he
[55:00] stands there like one unto the son of
[55:02] man for a reason that's so he could be a
[55:04] kinsman redeemer if he was in his own
[55:07] Spirit then we wouldn't recognize him
[55:09] maybe we wouldn't understand who this is
[55:12] but John as he saw them him there I'm
[55:14] sure that he could see the face of Jesus
[55:17] Christ only he had some different
[55:19] attributes around him and and the
[55:21] Sevenfold Glory of his person we're
[55:23] going to talk about that tonight but in
[55:25] Revelations
[55:27] 1:5 says and from Jesus Christ who is
[55:30] the faithful witness and the first
[55:32] begotten of the
[55:33] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[55:36] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[55:38] us from our sins in his own blood he's
[55:44] done it all and hath made us Kings and
[55:48] Priests unto God and his father to him
[55:51] be glory and Dominion forever and ever
[55:54] amen
[55:56] I heard this said recently and I thought
[55:57] it was so good I just had to get into
[55:59] this a little bit tonight we are Kings
[56:02] and Priests we already are seated in
[56:05] Heavenly places in Christ
[56:07] Jesus our kingship is directly related
[56:12] to directly Tethered to our
[56:16] priesthood and if we are not doing our
[56:18] Priestly
[56:19] duties then we're not in our position
[56:22] our kingship is maybe a little bit te
[56:25] ing maybe it's not as solid as we would
[56:28] like to see it or maybe as we would
[56:29] claim it to be our kingship is linked
[56:33] directly to our priesthood our
[56:35] willingness to do the sacrifice the
[56:38] sacrifice of praise the sacrifice of
[56:41] worship the sacrifice of laying down our
[56:44] lives as husbands for our entire
[56:46] families the sacrifice as wives for our
[56:49] husbands we're all Kings and Priests
[56:51] it's not just the husbands so if a
[56:54] husband is saying I'm the King serve me
[56:56] where's my servants where's my gestures
[56:59] my court gestures you know if that's
[57:01] going on there's something wrong it's
[57:02] not actually the way it's supposed to be
[57:05] because we're all Kings and Priests
[57:07] before the
[57:08] Lord as husbands we bring peace or we
[57:12] bring upset to our
[57:15] families we're the priests we intercede
[57:18] for our family
[57:20] situation or at least we
[57:22] should if we're not
[57:25] then it's time we do I want to encourage
[57:28] us brothers and sisters get in our
[57:29] Priestly offices wear that Priestly hat
[57:33] put that golden girdle on and and
[57:35] intercede for our families our children
[57:38] depend on it our marriages depend on it
[57:42] and I'll tell you all of that leads to
[57:44] our church depends on it
[57:48] am if we've got family problems
[57:51] scattered families about marriages on
[57:53] the Rocks brothers and and sisters it's
[57:55] going to be pretty hard to come to
[57:56] church and
[57:58] worship but boy when we can intercede
[58:01] for our families we know that the the
[58:03] husband can intercede for his wife and
[58:05] the wife can intercede for her husband
[58:07] that's according to the word I'm not
[58:08] going to quote the scripture all this is
[58:09] just a free let's set the foundation for
[58:11] the Sevenfold Glory of his
[58:14] person but I believe he wants to see
[58:16] that Glory not just in heaven not just
[58:18] in the vision with John he wants to see
[58:20] that glory in his sons and daughters he
[58:23] wants to see that glory in his family
[58:26] our willingness to
[58:27] surrender isn't this good do B
[58:30] benevolence does that sound familiar the
[58:34] wife should offer due benevolence to her
[58:36] husband many times guys will say oh yeah
[58:38] that's right that's the way it is Amen
[58:40] brother but what about us offering our
[58:42] due benevolence to our King to our
[58:45] husband if we're the bride if we're the
[58:48] bride then we're offering that due
[58:50] benevolence and that means the total
[58:51] sacrifice of our Lives laying down our
[58:53] will saying I don't need to do that I
[58:55] want to do that but I know that I need
[58:57] to do this because it's for the
[58:58] betterment of my
[59:01] family our willingness to surrender due
[59:04] benevolence to our husband brothers and
[59:05] sisters is vital you know what it does
[59:07] it demonstrates our kingship we don't
[59:10] even have to say a word because he says
[59:13] it he will magnify himself in our lives
[59:16] if we're willing to to show him that due
[59:19] benevolence we don't have to demand
[59:22] nothing you know what if we've got a
[59:24] wife that's maybe a little bit prickly
[59:26] husbands get in the way of of that of
[59:29] that priesthood get in that sacrificial
[59:31] office and see if God won't come on the
[59:33] scene and change that wife the same
[59:35] thing for the wife she can save her
[59:39] husband that's the word but you know the
[59:41] Way Up Is
[59:42] Down it's not puffing ourselves up and
[59:45] saying this is the word get in line that
[59:48] does nothing does
[59:50] nothing my goodness the Sevenfold Glory
[59:53] of his person
[59:55] there's coming a time though how does
[59:57] this apply there's coming a time where
[59:59] he will no longer be the priest right
[1:00:01] now he's the priest interceding for
[1:00:03] every one of our sins we know that as an
[1:00:06] accuser of the Brethren is there saying
[1:00:09] do you know what this brother did do you
[1:00:10] know what this sister did do you know
[1:00:11] what they're thinking do you know what
[1:00:12] they're doing remember brother bam said
[1:00:13] our thoughts in heaven are louder than
[1:00:15] our voice here on Earth and he knows
[1:00:17] what we're thinking right now this
[1:00:19] moment focus on the Sevenfold Glory of
[1:00:21] his person not brother Barry there's
[1:00:23] coming a time though where he will no
[1:00:24] longer be the priest interceding where
[1:00:26] he will be the judge and it's so
[1:00:28] beautiful because the world will say
[1:00:31] that we can look at him and see the
[1:00:32] judge and and the world wants to run and
[1:00:34] hide from it just like Adam wanted to
[1:00:36] run and hide because he knew that he
[1:00:38] transgressed and that's why people will
[1:00:40] say oh this religion stuff is just
[1:00:41] rubbish but is it the believer has the
[1:00:44] ability to look judgment right in the
[1:00:46] face and say lord judge me take my life
[1:00:49] and break me and bless those broken
[1:00:51] pieces and you'll never be able to bless
[1:00:52] the broken pieces unless you break them
[1:00:56] but we know that he will if we're fully
[1:00:58] willing to surrender to him but it's all
[1:01:01] about
[1:01:02] surrender now let's get into the
[1:01:05] Sevenfold Glory of his
[1:01:06] person Revelations 1:14 to16 it says his
[1:01:11] head and his hair were white like wool
[1:01:13] as white as snow and his eyes were as a
[1:01:17] flame of
[1:01:18] fire and his feet like unto fine brass
[1:01:22] as if they burned in a furnace and his
[1:01:24] voice as the sound of many Waters and he
[1:01:27] had in his right hand Seven Stars and
[1:01:29] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[1:01:31] sword and his countenance was as the sun
[1:01:33] shineth in its
[1:01:36] strength brother bradam he says in the
[1:01:38] church H book and I'm not going to go
[1:01:39] through and read every one of these just
[1:01:40] for the record we'll just do a little
[1:01:42] fly over and then we'll pick up where we
[1:01:43] left off last week I think it's at
[1:01:45] number
[1:01:46] six um we'll just pick up though but
[1:01:48] brother brother bradam he says in the
[1:01:50] very next paragraph he says How Deeply
[1:01:52] moving and inspiring was was the
[1:01:54] appearing of Jesus to
[1:01:57] John isn't it interesting because we
[1:02:01] know we have this picture painted of God
[1:02:05] the one with a white wig the the the one
[1:02:08] whose hair was white like wool is white
[1:02:10] as snow and his eyes as a flame of fire
[1:02:12] but here we have the prophet saying How
[1:02:14] Deeply moving and inspiring was the
[1:02:15] appearing of Jesus to John who is in
[1:02:19] exile for the cause of the word and
[1:02:21] behold the Living Word now stands before
[1:02:24] him John recognized who this was but he
[1:02:28] also recognized that this wasn't the
[1:02:30] shepherd this wasn't the the priest this
[1:02:32] wasn't the interceder the one making
[1:02:35] intercession for the Brethren now he had
[1:02:37] moved from the throne and he was
[1:02:39] standing up and he was coming to claim
[1:02:41] what was his as the
[1:02:43] judge what an Illuminating Vision
[1:02:46] brother bradam says for every
[1:02:48] descriptive attribute has a
[1:02:51] significance I just think this is so
[1:02:53] rich what a revelation of his glorious
[1:02:56] being he says and we know the first one
[1:02:58] is that he had hair white as snow and
[1:03:01] and that signifies absolute uh Authority
[1:03:05] we know that that's recognized in the
[1:03:07] world um judges they dress in the robe
[1:03:11] the the robe to the floor and they wear
[1:03:14] the white wig and and it signifies
[1:03:17] absolute Authority and the ability to
[1:03:20] judge it signifies wisdom and power and
[1:03:23] strength brother Bram goes on about that
[1:03:24] in there but we know there's more to it
[1:03:28] than that um in our day we have seen uh
[1:03:32] more of that and we would just simply
[1:03:34] say look at the cloud Vision that
[1:03:36] happened that cloud over sunset Mountain
[1:03:38] that's a complete description of what
[1:03:41] brother Bram said that John saw here and
[1:03:43] if you look it up in the message you'll
[1:03:45] see brother brandham talk about the
[1:03:46] white wigged one and we know that he
[1:03:48] asked his his friend I think it was
[1:03:50] Junior Jackson uh can't remember yeah
[1:03:53] Jack Moore that's who it was thank you
[1:03:55] brother asked Jack Moore what about that
[1:03:57] how could it be How could a 33-year-old
[1:03:59] man have a white hair like that
[1:04:01] signifying age and wisdom and we know
[1:04:04] that it was actually not that he got the
[1:04:05] revelation God spoke to him and said it
[1:04:07] wasn't the 33y old man this was the
[1:04:10] supernatural being of God himself
[1:04:13] manifesting as judge now and you know
[1:04:16] what age do we live in if that's what
[1:04:17] actually took place brothers and sisters
[1:04:19] I I just think it's amazing this is the
[1:04:21] one that we're talking about now the one
[1:04:23] whose hair as white as well with
[1:04:25] absolute Authority and his eyes as a
[1:04:27] flame of fire that's number
[1:04:29] two his eyes as a flame of fire brother
[1:04:32] bham says now those eyes are a flame of
[1:04:34] fire the eyes of the judge who will
[1:04:37] recompense those who rejected him my
[1:04:41] goodness and you know there's going to
[1:04:42] be no tempering of that judgment I'm
[1:04:45] jumping ahead when we get to the feet of
[1:04:47] brass there's nothing you can temper
[1:04:48] with brass brass is hard when brass is
[1:04:51] created it's it's the way it is and
[1:04:53] that's all it's got the molecular
[1:04:55] composition and you can't change it the
[1:04:56] only thing you could do is Polish it or
[1:04:58] melt it but you can't temper it you
[1:05:00] can't change the hardness of that metal
[1:05:02] and we will not be able to change the
[1:05:03] hardness of the Judgment of God when he
[1:05:05] pours out his wrath without without
[1:05:08] measure oh my it's incredible but number
[1:05:11] two his eyes are as a flame of fire and
[1:05:13] you know brother Bram he talks about
[1:05:15] this how you know all of all the human
[1:05:17] emotions that Jesus manifested the most
[1:05:19] when he appeared as the son of man was
[1:05:21] this one was that he wept often and the
[1:05:24] intercessor as the priest he he wept
[1:05:28] often for all of the people all the
[1:05:30] human beings on the Earth all of his
[1:05:32] Brethren who would betray him he wept
[1:05:34] often because he knew that that so many
[1:05:36] people would reject of him it's just
[1:05:39] incredible number two was eyes as flame
[1:05:42] of fire number three the feet of brass
[1:05:44] and we've already covered it there's
[1:05:46] nothing that is known that you can put
[1:05:48] with it to temper it but it's this brass
[1:05:51] that describes his feet is more
[1:05:53] remarkable yet in that it has stood the
[1:05:56] test of the fiery
[1:05:58] furnace and that fiery furnace brothers
[1:06:00] and sisters is to go and actually take
[1:06:03] all of the sin For All Mankind and put
[1:06:06] it upon
[1:06:07] himself he was wounded for our
[1:06:11] transgressions and he was bruised for
[1:06:13] our iniquity the chastisement of our
[1:06:17] peace was placed upon Him amen and by
[1:06:20] his stripes we are healed he went
[1:06:22] through that fiery furnace you know
[1:06:24] brother Brandon brings it out so good he
[1:06:26] he went from the cross to the temple
[1:06:28] down to hell isn't that what happened
[1:06:31] and he knocked on the door and Satan
[1:06:34] said oh I got you now I've been waiting
[1:06:35] for you and he grabbed him by the throat
[1:06:37] and said you don't understand man it's
[1:06:40] over I'm taking those keys of death and
[1:06:43] hell right off your side and you're
[1:06:45] going to wait now until you see me with
[1:06:48] that white wig and with the eyes of the
[1:06:50] flame of fire it's
[1:06:52] coming but we know that's what happened
[1:06:54] there's a feet of brass there's nothing
[1:06:57] you can temper with it we know brother
[1:06:58] Brandon goes on to talk about the Brazen
[1:07:00] serpent when the children of Israel were
[1:07:02] misbehaving in the wilderness they were
[1:07:04] delivered from all their years of hard
[1:07:06] bondage and their task Masters according
[1:07:08] to the promise of their forefathers we
[1:07:10] know that they were finally free and
[1:07:11] even in the wilderness they had
[1:07:13] misbehavior they just had their own
[1:07:15] ideas they just weren't able to be
[1:07:16] converted and we know brother Brandon
[1:07:17] brings it out and the word of God says
[1:07:19] it too that they didn't have faith in
[1:07:21] their hearts there was nothing in their
[1:07:23] hearts to mix with that word when it
[1:07:25] came to them from the prophet and that's
[1:07:27] why they perished everyone that was 21
[1:07:29] years of age and older or 20 years and
[1:07:31] older all those people God said you know
[1:07:33] what I'm done with you your carcasses
[1:07:35] are going to rot in the wilderness and
[1:07:37] unless we're careful we could find
[1:07:39] ourselves in that
[1:07:40] scenario we're talking about the other
[1:07:42] day I think it's so good I'm probably
[1:07:44] going to get into this really into this
[1:07:47] you know there was children that were
[1:07:48] born in the wilderness weren't
[1:07:50] they and they never had a problem for
[1:07:52] food and they they never had a problem
[1:07:54] for shoes on their feet and they never
[1:07:57] had a problem with their
[1:07:58] clothes they never had a problem the
[1:08:02] only problem they really had was
[1:08:03] listening to the chatter chatter chatter
[1:08:05] of their parents chiding against the
[1:08:07] prophet of
[1:08:10] God but some of them were able to
[1:08:12] overcome but other ones you can only
[1:08:15] imagine they became babies that were
[1:08:17] actually in the wilderness needing to be
[1:08:19] bottle fed they couldn't stand on their
[1:08:21] own they had everything they needed they
[1:08:24] didn't have any problems in their lives
[1:08:26] and I I just got wondering we were
[1:08:27] talking about this is this maybe the way
[1:08:29] it is when we're raised in the message
[1:08:30] and we never really have that that close
[1:08:33] connection with God ourselves when we
[1:08:35] just live potentially off of Mom and
[1:08:37] Dad's experience don't get comfortable
[1:08:40] brothers and sisters get get into Christ
[1:08:44] that's the only way we're going to get
[1:08:45] out of here just because we've got
[1:08:47] Financial blessings natural blessings
[1:08:49] Health blessings in our lives it doesn't
[1:08:51] mean that we have God's blessing
[1:08:57] three the feet of brass but anyways when
[1:09:00] the children of Israel were in in the
[1:09:02] wilderness because of their misbehavior
[1:09:05] we know there was a plague and that
[1:09:07] plague came from serpents God sent fiery
[1:09:09] serpents through the camp you want to be
[1:09:11] that way you want to chide the prophet
[1:09:13] that's fine you can take some snake
[1:09:15] bites and everyone who was bit by the
[1:09:17] snake was killed weren't they they died
[1:09:19] unless they had a remedy for that
[1:09:22] bite but God did something he took some
[1:09:26] a piece I can only imagine of that
[1:09:28] Brazen feet that Brazen judgment and
[1:09:30] said to Moses you take that brass and
[1:09:32] you make a serpent and you put it on a
[1:09:34] pole and you raise it up in front of the
[1:09:36] congregation and any time one of them
[1:09:38] gets looked follow the word of the
[1:09:41] Prophet follow the instructions that the
[1:09:44] prophet gives and if you do that you'll
[1:09:46] live am many people would say well
[1:09:49] brother Barry that was God's word but
[1:09:51] where does God's word go how does it
[1:09:53] come to the to people it's only through
[1:09:54] the prophet brothers and sisters follow
[1:09:57] the word of the prophet and take a look
[1:09:59] at that Brazen Serpent and we know that
[1:10:01] was a type brother brandom says it of
[1:10:03] Christ being raised up and those people
[1:10:05] who are willing to look away from their
[1:10:06] afflictions to look away from their
[1:10:07] faults and failures and Look Away to
[1:10:10] Jesus those are the ones that are going
[1:10:12] to be saved because I guarantee you that
[1:10:14] serpent is roaming through the Earth
[1:10:16] right now and he's just looking like a
[1:10:17] lion to see whom he can devour and he's
[1:10:20] going to fite us and unless we're
[1:10:21] careful those snake bites will kill us
[1:10:25] spiritually speaking of
[1:10:27] course that Brazen serpent on the pole
[1:10:31] symbolized Sin from the Garden of Eden
[1:10:33] brass it speaks of judgment the Brazen
[1:10:35] altar had a foundation that was made of
[1:10:38] brass and we know that that's where the
[1:10:41] altar was for sin the sin sacrifice was
[1:10:45] offered upon the Brazen Altar and that
[1:10:46] was on the outside of the court before
[1:10:48] you even got into the inner Court of the
[1:10:50] temple before you even got in there you
[1:10:52] had to take and make make your sacrifice
[1:10:54] upon that Brazen Altar and I can't help
[1:10:56] but think it's a type for us brothers
[1:10:57] and sisters we've got to make sure that
[1:10:59] we're doing our part before we even come
[1:11:01] into to the church before we even get
[1:11:03] into service we've got to be making sure
[1:11:05] that we are covering our sin that we're
[1:11:07] coming to the Lord and surrendering
[1:11:09] ourselves unto
[1:11:10] him we know that right now he's still
[1:11:14] interceding for us but that day is
[1:11:15] coming brother bam says the day is
[1:11:17] coming it's coming number four his voice
[1:11:21] was as the sound of many Waters and what
[1:11:23] does the waters represent the waters
[1:11:25] which thou sawest are peoples multitudes
[1:11:27] Nations and tongues that's Revelations
[1:11:30] 17:15 it's the voice of the people it's
[1:11:34] the voice of the ages of all the
[1:11:37] Believers and brother Bram talks about
[1:11:39] this in such an amazing way he says all
[1:11:42] of them were the voice of Jesus Christ
[1:11:45] by the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages
[1:11:49] the voice of many
[1:11:51] Waters this just opened up up so wide to
[1:11:54] me I just it's so beautiful brother Bram
[1:11:56] he goes on to say take heed this very
[1:11:58] hour for at this moment your thoughts
[1:11:59] are being recorded in Heaven There your
[1:12:01] thoughts speak louder than your words
[1:12:04] even now this could be your last call to
[1:12:06] hear the word and receive it unto
[1:12:08] eternal
[1:12:09] life and how could that be brothers and
[1:12:11] sisters we don't know what's going to
[1:12:12] happen to us when we leave this building
[1:12:14] tonight any one of us could be called to
[1:12:17] glory the lord could just decide it's
[1:12:19] time to pick that flower and take it out
[1:12:22] are we able to hear that voice tonight
[1:12:25] amen if we are then all we need to do is
[1:12:26] surrender to it that's all Just
[1:12:29] Surrender to
[1:12:32] it but you know brother Bram he says and
[1:12:36] someday we will hear that same sweet
[1:12:40] voice speak not in judgment but in
[1:12:43] welcome to us whose sins have been
[1:12:46] remitted by his blood whose lives have
[1:12:49] been spirit filled and whose walk was in
[1:12:53] the world word amen he says what could
[1:12:55] be more precious than to hear the
[1:12:57] multitudes of welcoming voices and be
[1:13:00] surrounded by those multitudes who have
[1:13:03] believed unto eternal life oh there is
[1:13:07] nothing like it I pray that you will
[1:13:10] hear his voice and Harden not your heart
[1:13:13] but receive him as your
[1:13:18] King number five in his right hand were
[1:13:21] the Seven Stars brother Bram he says it
[1:13:25] his faithful
[1:13:26] messenger each age pulled away from God
[1:13:31] his faithful messenger turned that age
[1:13:33] back to the
[1:13:35] word each one of those seven stars were
[1:13:38] the seven Church Messengers The Seven
[1:13:40] Church age Messengers as we go we'll
[1:13:42] probably get some more video or more
[1:13:45] pictures uh tonight it's just going to
[1:13:47] be words but we know that they're the
[1:13:50] faithful
[1:13:50] messengers of all the church ages
[1:13:53] brother Bram he says and in thankfulness
[1:13:55] for his salvation they burned with the
[1:13:58] light of his life and reflected his
[1:14:01] love patience meekness Temperance
[1:14:05] gentleness and
[1:14:07] faithfulness and God backed them up with
[1:14:10] wonders signs and
[1:14:13] miracles they were accused of being
[1:14:15] Fanatics and holy rollers they were
[1:14:17] denounced by organizations and held in
[1:14:20] mockery but they kept true to the word
[1:14:24] amen I love how brother bradam he says
[1:14:27] this now it's not hard to stand up and
[1:14:30] keep true to a Creed it's easy for the
[1:14:33] Devil is right behind that all that but
[1:14:37] it is something else to be true to God's
[1:14:39] word and go back to what the word
[1:14:41] originally produced at
[1:14:45] Pentecost I'm just skipping along here
[1:14:48] so I just want to get to the next one
[1:14:50] we're almost there but two more
[1:14:51] paragraphs he says but when you think of
[1:14:54] that little group whose members were saw
[1:14:57] asunder fed to Lions persecuted and
[1:15:01] driven from Pillar To Post and yet
[1:15:04] stayed true to the word now definitely
[1:15:07] that would have to be God how they
[1:15:11] survived their Battle of faith and
[1:15:14] carried on still that is a
[1:15:17] miracle and I believe it's the same
[1:15:19] thing tonight brothers and sisters how
[1:15:21] are we able to carry on with this word
[1:15:26] how are we able to continue on believing
[1:15:29] the the words of a Vindicated Prophet
[1:15:32] it's not because we joined a cult and we
[1:15:34] we all just got brainwashed even though
[1:15:36] we did get brainwashed we got washed of
[1:15:38] all the trash that's in our lives and in
[1:15:40] our heads all of our traditional
[1:15:42] teaching we did get brainwashed but by
[1:15:44] the word of
[1:15:46] God
[1:15:48] yes and that's a
[1:15:51] miracle brother bradam says that's the
[1:15:53] greatest
[1:15:54] Miracle don't be thinking we're going to
[1:15:56] see someone raised from the dead and
[1:15:58] we're going to see uh uh cancer healed
[1:16:00] and we're going to see just Cold's gone
[1:16:03] and we're going to see food in the
[1:16:04] pantry and we're going to see money in
[1:16:06] the bank account and we're going to see
[1:16:08] all these different great and wonderful
[1:16:09] things which we all see anyways they all
[1:16:11] happen all of those things
[1:16:14] happen there's even more tremendous
[1:16:16] Miracles that happened I mean we're not
[1:16:19] going to get into that tonight but the
[1:16:20] greatest Miracle brothers and sisters is
[1:16:22] that we have the ability to be converted
[1:16:24] into a son a daughter of God that we can
[1:16:26] recognize our position in Christ Jesus
[1:16:29] that's the miracle but that we have the
[1:16:32] ability to just continue our Battle of
[1:16:34] faith and carry on still that is a
[1:16:36] miracle in the face of all the
[1:16:38] opposition in this world this world is
[1:16:40] not set up to be a message believer is
[1:16:42] it not in any way there's nothing in
[1:16:46] this
[1:16:47] world that's a
[1:16:50] miracle he goes on to say and this
[1:16:52] comfort Fort is not for the seven Church
[1:16:54] age Messengers
[1:16:56] only every True Believer is in the hand
[1:16:59] of God and can draw from his love and
[1:17:01] power and receive the full benefit of
[1:17:05] all that God is to the believer what God
[1:17:08] gives the messenger and How He blesses
[1:17:10] and uses the messenger is an example to
[1:17:14] all believers of his goodness and care
[1:17:17] to all members of his body amen amen
[1:17:20] don't put it off onto the prophet and
[1:17:22] say it's only for him that's a lie
[1:17:25] that's not true according to what he
[1:17:28] said I've heard some people say it it's
[1:17:30] not true brothers and sisters why would
[1:17:33] we want to dissect that why would we
[1:17:34] want to try and take that apart when
[1:17:37] brother bradam said he heard that voice
[1:17:38] that said to him all that you ever loved
[1:17:42] and all that ever loved you will be
[1:17:45] there on the other side I've heard
[1:17:47] people want to argue that and say well
[1:17:48] that's just for a prophet but what does
[1:17:50] the word say if you receive a prophet in
[1:17:53] the name of a prophet then you receive
[1:17:56] what the prophet's reward why would we
[1:17:59] think that we shouldn't see all of that
[1:18:02] especially since he says it's an example
[1:18:04] to all believers of his goodness and
[1:18:06] care to all members of his
[1:18:09] body I just can't help but think maybe
[1:18:11] someone somewhere along the way just
[1:18:13] didn't really fully realize the impact
[1:18:15] of of receiving this messenger of
[1:18:18] receiving this word for our day it's way
[1:18:20] more than we can even comprehend with
[1:18:23] our
[1:18:24] minds number six now we're picking up
[1:18:28] where we left off that was the last
[1:18:29] paragraph last week number six The
[1:18:31] two-edged
[1:18:32] Sword and boy I feel like we could
[1:18:34] preach on this and out of his mouth went
[1:18:36] a sharp two-edged sword Revelations
[1:18:40] 1:16 Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is
[1:18:43] quick and that means it has life quick
[1:18:47] means life it's live the word of God is
[1:18:51] quick and powerful and sharp sharper
[1:18:53] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[1:18:55] to the dividing aunder of Soul and
[1:18:58] Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and
[1:19:01] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:19:03] intents of the heart and you know
[1:19:06] brothers and sisters we've talked about
[1:19:07] this many many times this word of God
[1:19:10] when we hearing the word of God and God
[1:19:11] is speaking to you you know someone
[1:19:14] isn't having a conversation about you
[1:19:16] and trying to slag you and try and
[1:19:18] influence the minister and trying to
[1:19:20] twist it and manipulate it to make it
[1:19:21] this Supernatural thing it's not like
[1:19:23] that at all brothers and sisters when
[1:19:25] you hear something that speaks to your
[1:19:26] soul that's the Holy Spirit we asked him
[1:19:29] to rain down and when he's doing that in
[1:19:31] our lives just say Amen to that word and
[1:19:34] he will change
[1:19:35] you he's changing us from glory to glory
[1:19:38] but the word of God is quick and
[1:19:39] Powerful it's sharper than any two-edged
[1:19:41] sword and I would say it's sharper than
[1:19:43] any Minister it's sharper than any
[1:19:45] Minister that could get behind the
[1:19:46] pulpit here it's sharper than any
[1:19:48] Ministry it's sharper than anything we
[1:19:50] could imagine it's piercing even to the
[1:19:52] dividing aund of Soul and Spirit it can
[1:19:54] take apart all that God has created
[1:19:56] there's only one thing that can do that
[1:19:58] and that's the word of
[1:20:00] God but it goes beyond the joints in the
[1:20:02] marrow it goes beyond the flesh it goes
[1:20:04] right down into the soul because it's a
[1:20:06] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:20:08] intents of the
[1:20:10] heart brother Bram says out of his mouth
[1:20:13] went a sharp two-edged sword which is
[1:20:17] the word of
[1:20:18] God you know in Revelation it says
[1:20:21] blessed are they which read and hear the
[1:20:27] words of this
[1:20:28] testimony we don't even have to read it
[1:20:30] so long as we listen to it I was talking
[1:20:33] to a brother the other day and he said
[1:20:34] he's listening to the word of God he's
[1:20:36] just listening to the Bible and I said
[1:20:38] Amen to that just listen just allow that
[1:20:41] word to get down inside you just eat the
[1:20:43] book and see if God doesn't come on the
[1:20:46] scene out of his mouth when a sharp
[1:20:48] two-edged sword which is the word of God
[1:20:51] now this is Revelations 19 11-16 brother
[1:20:56] Bram says and I saw heaven open and
[1:20:58] behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:21:00] upon him was called faithful and true in
[1:21:03] and in righteousness he doth judge and
[1:21:06] make war his eyes were as a flame of
[1:21:10] fire same
[1:21:12] guy his head were many crowns and he had
[1:21:16] a name written that no man knew but he
[1:21:19] himself and he was clothed with a
[1:21:22] vesture ripped in Blood and his name is
[1:21:24] called the word of God who's the word of
[1:21:28] God brothers and sisters we know that's
[1:21:30] Jesus Christ and the armies which were
[1:21:34] in heaven followed him upon white horses
[1:21:37] that's
[1:21:38] you the armies which were in heaven
[1:21:41] followed him upon white horses clothed
[1:21:44] in fine linen white and clean
[1:21:48] am anybody here know how to ride a
[1:21:51] horse doesn't matter you're going to
[1:21:53] know
[1:21:55] how we're going to have writing lessons
[1:21:57] brothers and sisters I can't help but
[1:22:00] think we're just going to know it we
[1:22:01] won't even need a lesson not one lesson
[1:22:04] and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword
[1:22:07] that with it he should Smite the Nations
[1:22:10] and he shall rule them with the rod of
[1:22:12] iron and he treadeth The Wine Press of
[1:22:15] the fierceness and Wrath of almighty God
[1:22:18] and he hath on his vesture and on his
[1:22:21] thigh a name written king of kings and
[1:22:25] Lord of lords
[1:22:27] am and at that point he's gone from
[1:22:29] being the intercessor hasn't he now he's
[1:22:33] the judge he's got the same eyes as the
[1:22:36] one John turned to see when he was in
[1:22:38] the spirit on the Lord's
[1:22:43] Day John 1:48 Nathaniel saith unto him
[1:22:47] whence knowest whence knowest thou me
[1:22:51] Jesus answered and said unto him before
[1:22:52] Philip calth thee called thee when thou
[1:22:55] was under the Fig Tree I saw thee now
[1:22:57] brother bradam he uses that scripture
[1:22:59] and he says there it is when he comes
[1:23:01] that word will come against all nations
[1:23:04] and all men and none will be able to
[1:23:06] stand against it it will reveal what was
[1:23:11] in every heart as he did with
[1:23:15] Nathaniel the word of God is a discerner
[1:23:18] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:23:21] heart I think it's so beautiful if we
[1:23:24] just talk about that for a minute it
[1:23:25] shows the word of God is in our very
[1:23:29] innermost being because nobody else can
[1:23:31] do that nobody else can know the intent
[1:23:33] of our heart nobody else can know what
[1:23:35] our thoughts are and we know the word of
[1:23:37] God says as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:23:40] so is he how does a heart think A heart
[1:23:43] doesn't think right it it's the
[1:23:46] innermost being it's the very soul of a
[1:23:48] person of the human
[1:23:50] being but just like it was with
[1:23:52] Nathaniel that same one the word of God
[1:23:56] will show who did the will of God and
[1:23:59] who didn't it will make known the secret
[1:24:02] works of every man why he did them it
[1:24:06] will defy the Sunder amen it's such an
[1:24:10] amazing time I I'm I'm wondering I i'
[1:24:13] I'd like to see that specific part
[1:24:15] sometime maybe in brother mervin's
[1:24:17] timeline where Revelations 19 comes into
[1:24:21] the into the scen there's so much in
[1:24:24] there that that takes place where all of
[1:24:26] the armies come with him I think it's
[1:24:29] just beautiful just magnificent
[1:24:31] visualizing the word of God isn't it and
[1:24:34] just allowing the Lord to reveal it to
[1:24:36] us as we read it just reading it and
[1:24:38] just pondering it just thinking about it
[1:24:40] those thoughts that come to us when
[1:24:42] they're according to the word they're
[1:24:43] from God and anything else is of the
[1:24:46] devil we've only got two thoughts coming
[1:24:48] brothers and sisters the influence that
[1:24:50] comes to us it's of God or it's of Satan
[1:24:52] that's right and if it's of God it's
[1:24:54] always going to point to the word and if
[1:24:55] it's not pointing to the word check
[1:24:59] it we know that brother Bram goes on to
[1:25:01] say in Romans 2:3 and thinkest thou this
[1:25:03] oh man that judges them which do such
[1:25:07] things and doest the same that thou
[1:25:11] shalt escape the Judgment of God Amen
[1:25:14] then we know he's talking to the Romans
[1:25:16] there and they're they're they're doing
[1:25:17] stuff and you know some of them are
[1:25:19] pretty Pious people and we know the
[1:25:21] prophet in the had to say to them look
[1:25:24] what are you judging people for you're
[1:25:26] doing the same thing how can you judge
[1:25:29] people when you're doing the same thing
[1:25:30] judging people as wrong as incorrect as
[1:25:33] bad but you're doing the same thing you
[1:25:35] can't do that but we know the word of
[1:25:38] God is coming and the word of God even
[1:25:40] now is here and it's Discerning the
[1:25:42] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:25:44] and it's judging every single man and
[1:25:46] every single woman and every single
[1:25:48] child there's nothing hid from God he
[1:25:50] knows exactly who we are he knows EX
[1:25:52] exactly what we're thinking he knows
[1:25:53] exactly what we're planning to do he
[1:25:55] knows all of it brother bam goes on to
[1:25:58] say then it goes on to say how God is
[1:26:01] going to judge men here it is in verse 5
[1:26:04] to1 17 the heart
[1:26:08] in pentant heart will be judged The
[1:26:12] Works will be judged the motives will be
[1:26:16] judged there won't be any respect before
[1:26:19] God but all will be judged by that word
[1:26:24] no one escaping it isn't it beautiful to
[1:26:28] to know that to know that's our Anchor
[1:26:30] Point to know that's our our guide post
[1:26:33] to know that's our North Star to know
[1:26:35] that's our Compass to know that that
[1:26:37] word is our
[1:26:39] absolute even the prophet said if you
[1:26:42] can't take my word if you have any
[1:26:44] questions about what I've told you take
[1:26:46] the word of
[1:26:48] God which prophet in this world has said
[1:26:51] those words
[1:26:53] because we know there's a lot of people
[1:26:54] that have gone out there's a lot of
[1:26:55] false prophets that have gone out in
[1:26:56] this world we know that when the Bible
[1:26:58] was being written we know that John was
[1:27:00] told that beware there's many false
[1:27:03] prophets already in the world the
[1:27:04] Antichrist spirit is already in the
[1:27:06] world creeping in the church causing it
[1:27:09] to be lukewarm formal and
[1:27:13] Powerless but there won't be any respect
[1:27:15] before God but all will be judged by
[1:27:18] that word amen no one escaping it I just
[1:27:21] can't help but think how brother Bram he
[1:27:22] said you know people say that God is
[1:27:26] going to judge the World by the
[1:27:29] church some people say that and brother
[1:27:32] bradam says what
[1:27:34] church what church is he going to judge
[1:27:36] it by because if he judges it by one the
[1:27:39] other's wrong if he judges it by the
[1:27:42] other ones then the other one's wrong
[1:27:44] and that's why we say as ministers as
[1:27:45] pastors don't look at the church
[1:27:47] brothers and sisters look to Christ this
[1:27:50] church will take you to hell yes now
[1:27:53] that's powerful I don't mean it to sound
[1:27:55] terrible but it is you've got to get to
[1:27:57] Christ this church is here to get people
[1:28:00] to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:28:03] and forever amen God's only going to
[1:28:05] judge the World by his word and Jesus
[1:28:08] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:28:10] forever he is that
[1:28:13] word those who heard and wouldn't listen
[1:28:17] will be judged by what they
[1:28:20] heard those that rested in it saying
[1:28:23] they believed it but didn't live it will
[1:28:27] be
[1:28:28] judged every secret will come out in the
[1:28:31] open and be shouted from the
[1:28:34] housetops he says oh we will really
[1:28:36] understand history then there's some
[1:28:39] questions about history isn't there some
[1:28:42] real Mysteries but they're all going to
[1:28:44] be histories when we get there he says
[1:28:47] there won't be a mystery left from all
[1:28:49] the ages but do you know that he is
[1:28:52] revealing the heart secrets of men and
[1:28:54] women in this age in which we are
[1:28:57] living it's not just the prophet
[1:28:59] brothers and sisters we already read
[1:29:01] that right it's not just for the prophet
[1:29:02] it's for all the
[1:29:04] Believers this is
[1:29:07] real but do you know that he's revealing
[1:29:09] the heart secrets of men and women in
[1:29:10] this age in which we are living who else
[1:29:12] could reveal the secrets of the heart
[1:29:14] but the word himself Hebrews 4:12 for
[1:29:17] the word of God is quick and powerful
[1:29:19] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:29:20] piercing even to the dividing a suer of
[1:29:22] Soul and Spirit and joints and Marrow
[1:29:24] and a discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:29:26] intents of the heart he says it is the
[1:29:29] word it is performing where unto it was
[1:29:31] sent for it the word is full of power it
[1:29:34] is the same spirit that was in Jesus the
[1:29:37] word that is present again in the church
[1:29:40] in this last age don't think that it was
[1:29:43] just for the prophet in his time
[1:29:46] brothers and sisters if anything it's
[1:29:47] Amplified
[1:29:50] today
[1:29:52] otherwise why would God take the prophet
[1:29:53] off the
[1:29:54] scene why would he steal the prophet
[1:29:57] away why would he take
[1:29:59] him because he wants the many membered
[1:30:01] body to rise up and recognize its
[1:30:09] position it's the same spirit that was
[1:30:11] in
[1:30:12] Jesus it is the same spirit that was in
[1:30:14] Jesus the word that is present again in
[1:30:16] the church in this last age as a last
[1:30:19] sign trying to head the people off from
[1:30:22] judgement for they that reject him the
[1:30:25] word are now already come into judgment
[1:30:28] crucifying him aesh amen and
[1:30:32] remember I can't remember what year it
[1:30:34] was someone here would probably be able
[1:30:35] to put it out there prophet of God the
[1:30:38] spirit of God in the prophet he said I
[1:30:41] indict this generation for the second
[1:30:43] crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ why
[1:30:46] because you pierce him with your Creeds
[1:30:48] and your dogmas you take him and make
[1:30:51] him to be an open shame you put them to
[1:30:53] be an open
[1:30:56] shame my Hebrews 66 says if they shall
[1:30:59] fall away to renew them again unto
[1:31:01] repentance seeing they crucify
[1:31:03] themselves the Son of God aresh and put
[1:31:05] him to an open shame goes on to say now
[1:31:08] Paul said that the word came in power as
[1:31:11] well as voice the word preached actually
[1:31:15] demonstrated itself amen and I'll say it
[1:31:19] this way the word preached actually
[1:31:23] demonstrates
[1:31:25] itself because it's a very present help
[1:31:29] in our time of trouble this is a Living
[1:31:31] Word brothers and sisters this is not
[1:31:33] historical accounting he goes on to say
[1:31:36] like a flame cutting sword it went to
[1:31:38] the consciences of men and like a
[1:31:41] surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases
[1:31:43] and set captives free everywhere those
[1:31:46] early Believers went they were preaching
[1:31:48] the gospel word and God confirmed Med
[1:31:52] that word with signs following the sick
[1:31:55] were healed Devils were cast out and
[1:31:58] they spoke in new tongues that was the
[1:32:01] word in action that word has never
[1:32:03] failed in the mouths of believing
[1:32:05] Christians
[1:32:07] amen that word has never failed in the
[1:32:10] mouths of believing Christians and in
[1:32:13] this last age it is here stronger and
[1:32:16] greater than ever in the true word bride
[1:32:21] amen he doesn't say in the true word
[1:32:24] prophet he says it and in the last AG
[1:32:27] it's here stronger and greater than ever
[1:32:30] in the true word
[1:32:33] bride oh little flock you little
[1:32:35] minority hold on to your the word fill
[1:32:39] your mouth and heart with it and someday
[1:32:41] God will give you the
[1:32:45] kingdom there ain't nothing wrong with
[1:32:47] just playing the word of God just
[1:32:49] listening to the Book of Revelation just
[1:32:51] listen listening to the Book of Daniel
[1:32:52] just listening to the Book of Genesis
[1:32:54] just listening to the book of Acts any
[1:32:57] any word of God brothers and sisters
[1:32:58] there's a blessing lay in
[1:33:01] there hold to
[1:33:04] it number
[1:33:07] seven let me see here my
[1:33:11] goodness oh we might have to just pick
[1:33:14] up where we leave off I don't know we'll
[1:33:15] see part seven his face like the sun
[1:33:18] Revelations 1:16 and his countenance was
[1:33:22] as the sun shineth in its
[1:33:24] strength and after 6 days Jesus taketh
[1:33:28] Peter James and John his brother sorry I
[1:33:30] want to I want to get this here it's
[1:33:33] Matthew 17 verse
[1:33:36] 1-13 and after six days Jesus taketh
[1:33:39] Peter James and John his brother and
[1:33:40] bringeth them up into a high mountain
[1:33:42] apart and was transfigured before them
[1:33:46] and his face did shine as the sun and
[1:33:49] his reignment was as white as as the
[1:33:52] light and behold there appeared unto
[1:33:55] them Moses and Elias talking with him
[1:34:00] then answered Peter and said unto Jesus
[1:34:02] Lord it is good for us to be here if
[1:34:06] thou Wilt let us make here three
[1:34:09] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[1:34:13] and one for
[1:34:14] Elijah while he yet spake Behold a
[1:34:17] bright Cloud overshadowed them oh that
[1:34:20] just gets me excited when I hear that
[1:34:22] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:34:25] which said this is my beloved Son in
[1:34:28] whom I am well pleased hear ye him and
[1:34:32] when the disciples heard it they fell on
[1:34:34] their face and were sore afraid and
[1:34:36] Jesus came and touched them and said
[1:34:38] arise and be not afraid and when they
[1:34:41] had lifted up their eyes they say saw no
[1:34:44] man save Jesus only and as they came
[1:34:48] down from the mountain Jesus charged
[1:34:50] them saying tell the vision to no man
[1:34:52] until the son of man be risen from the
[1:34:55] dead and his disciples asked him saying
[1:34:59] why then say the scribes that Elijah
[1:35:02] must first come and Jesus answered and
[1:35:04] said unto them Elijah truly shall first
[1:35:08] come and restore all things but I say
[1:35:10] unto you that Elijah is come already and
[1:35:13] they knew him not but have done unto
[1:35:15] them whatsoever they listed likewise
[1:35:19] shall also the son of man suffer of
[1:35:22] them then the disciples understood that
[1:35:25] he spake unto them of John the Baptist
[1:35:29] but it's interesting because he said
[1:35:31] Elijah isn't it now we know as message
[1:35:33] Believers but there might be some that
[1:35:35] don't know it there is a five comings of
[1:35:37] the spirit of Elijah and we know that
[1:35:40] this was a third coming right here right
[1:35:43] there was Elijah then that Spirit went
[1:35:46] to Elisha when he picked up the mantle
[1:35:48] and tried to operate the the gift of the
[1:35:50] Holy Ghost in his life and then it went
[1:35:52] to John the Baptist and then it went to
[1:35:54] William Mary and branam and then it will
[1:35:56] go to Elijah again himself along with
[1:36:00] Moses back in Israel and that's going to
[1:36:01] happen any day now just any day now that
[1:36:03] will be over there in Israel those
[1:36:05] people are crying out for
[1:36:08] messiah they're crying out for
[1:36:10] messiah brother Bram he says now Matthew
[1:36:13] 16:28 pref prefacing Matthew 17
[1:36:16] 1-13 Jesus had said there be some
[1:36:20] standing here which shall not taste of
[1:36:22] death till they see the son of man
[1:36:25] coming in his kingdom amen and the three
[1:36:27] Apostles did see just that the order of
[1:36:31] his second coming Mount Transfiguration
[1:36:34] brothers and sisters was something very
[1:36:36] very significant and I want to say this
[1:36:39] we have a dispensational prophet in our
[1:36:41] day saying that the order of his second
[1:36:46] coming those three Apostles they saw the
[1:36:49] order of his second coming so I want to
[1:36:52] say tonight based on that what happened
[1:36:54] on Mount sunset in
[1:36:56] 1963 what was it that came what what
[1:36:58] happened brothers and sisters we know
[1:37:00] what it was it was the word coming of
[1:37:02] the Lord Jesus Christ himself the white
[1:37:04] wigged one but the three Apostles did
[1:37:07] see just that the order of his second
[1:37:09] coming they saw him transfigured there
[1:37:12] on the Mountaintop his rment was Blazing
[1:37:15] white and his face Shone like the sun in
[1:37:18] its Zenith and there as he appeared
[1:37:21] stood Moses and Elijah on either side
[1:37:23] that is exactly how he is coming again
[1:37:28] now I just can't help but imagine many
[1:37:30] people will say the bride goes way
[1:37:32] before the bride is gone they don't see
[1:37:34] Moses and Elijah some people say well
[1:37:36] the message of the hour kind of says
[1:37:37] they might see Moses and Elijah and then
[1:37:39] they'll go I wonder about this quote
[1:37:41] here that is exactly how he is coming
[1:37:44] again truly Elijah will first come and
[1:37:46] restore the hearts of the children bride
[1:37:48] back to the father's Apostolic word
[1:37:50] Doctrine we know know that's already
[1:37:51] taken place we don't need to see Moses
[1:37:54] and Elijah in Israel to actually
[1:37:56] understand that this scripture is
[1:37:57] fulfilled it's already fulfilled It's
[1:38:00] Already Done Malachi 45 and 6 says
[1:38:03] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:38:05] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:38:06] and Dreadful day of the Lord and we know
[1:38:08] that's happened and he said and it says
[1:38:11] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[1:38:12] to the children and the Heart of the
[1:38:14] children to their fathers and that's
[1:38:16] already happened both of those lest I
[1:38:18] come and smite the Earth with a
[1:38:20] curse
[1:38:21] Israel is already a nation she is
[1:38:24] established now with her armies Navy
[1:38:26] Postal System flag and all that pertains
[1:38:29] to nationhood but there is still to be
[1:38:31] fulfilled the scripture that says or
[1:38:34] shall a nation be born all at once
[1:38:37] Isaiah 668 that day is coming soon the
[1:38:40] fig tree has put forth her buds the
[1:38:43] Israelites are waiting for the
[1:38:47] Messiah I got connected with a guy who
[1:38:49] is a lawyer in Israel if anybody's
[1:38:52] interested I could pass it on to you the
[1:38:53] link it's a WhatsApp connection and you
[1:38:56] can see the weekly just about daily
[1:38:58] updates of what's taking place in Israel
[1:39:00] right now and and they're crying for
[1:39:02] messiah this is this is this is a real
[1:39:05] thing they are really crying for messiah
[1:39:07] you see them worship they they celebrate
[1:39:10] Shabbat every single week they are
[1:39:12] really serious about seeing Messiah come
[1:39:14] on the
[1:39:15] scene I think it's just
[1:39:17] amazing brother bradam he says it the
[1:39:20] day is coming soon the fig tree has put
[1:39:22] forth her buds the Israelites are
[1:39:23] waiting for their Messiah they are
[1:39:25] expecting him and their expectations are
[1:39:28] about to be fulfilled Israel will be
[1:39:30] reborn spiritually for her light and her
[1:39:33] life are about to be revealed to her
[1:39:36] Revelations 21:23 and the city had no
[1:39:39] need of the sun neither of the moon to
[1:39:42] shine in it for the glory of God did
[1:39:45] lighten it and the lamb is the light
[1:39:47] thereof amen he says this is the New
[1:39:50] Jerusalem the lamb will be in that City
[1:39:53] and because of his presence there will
[1:39:55] be no light needed the Sun Won't rise
[1:39:58] and shine there for he is the Sun and
[1:40:01] light thereof himself the Nations that
[1:40:04] come into it will walk in his light
[1:40:07] aren't you happy that day is upon us
[1:40:09] John saw that day coming even so Lord
[1:40:12] Jesus come quickly Malachi 4 1 to3 for
[1:40:16] behold that day cometh that shall burn
[1:40:18] as an oven and all the proud yay and all
[1:40:21] that do wickedly shall be stubble and
[1:40:24] the day that cometh shall burn them up
[1:40:26] saith the Lord of hosts that it shall
[1:40:29] leave them neither root nor Branch but
[1:40:31] unto you that fear my name shall the son
[1:40:35] of righteousness arise with healing in
[1:40:37] his wings and ye shall go forth and grow
[1:40:40] up as calves of the stall and you shall
[1:40:42] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[1:40:44] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[1:40:47] that day that I shall do this saith the
[1:40:49] Lord of hosts
[1:40:53] my now I'm getting to where I wanted to
[1:40:55] get this is where the service is going
[1:40:56] to start brother bramy says there it is
[1:40:59] again the sun shining out in all its
[1:41:02] strength all the strength of the Son of
[1:41:04] God shining in the midst of the seven
[1:41:06] golden candlesticks there he stands the
[1:41:10] judge the one who suffered and died for
[1:41:13] us he took the wrath of divine judgment
[1:41:16] upon
[1:41:17] himself he tread The Wine Press of the
[1:41:20] fierceness of the wrath of God alone as
[1:41:23] we have already stated to The Sinner his
[1:41:26] voice is as the sound of the Cataract or
[1:41:29] the surf pounding in waves of death upon
[1:41:32] the rocky
[1:41:35] shores but to the
[1:41:37] Saint his voice is as the sound of the
[1:41:40] sweetly singing brooken as you lie at
[1:41:44] rest satisfied in
[1:41:47] Christ I just couldn't help but think
[1:41:50] while I was studying studying this
[1:41:51] brothers and sisters if you've ever been
[1:41:53] in the ocean and you've ever been around
[1:41:56] Coral or around
[1:41:58] rocks sometimes those waves will take
[1:42:00] you and they'll push you up against the
[1:42:02] rocks and if you can't get your footing
[1:42:05] if you can't get a grasp on those rocks
[1:42:07] and get away from it that surf is just
[1:42:09] going to pound you and the sound of it
[1:42:11] just Roars and it just continues to push
[1:42:14] you and pound you and Turn you and flip
[1:42:16] you and pound you and just scrape you up
[1:42:18] on those rocks it's terrible sometimes
[1:42:21] as people we can find ourselves up
[1:42:23] against the
[1:42:24] Rocks but there's a delivering power for
[1:42:27] us we don't have to continually be beat
[1:42:30] up against the Rocks washed up against
[1:42:32] the Rocks wind up Shipwrecked smashed to
[1:42:36] bits there is a cry we just need to
[1:42:39] listen and hear

[1:42:50] last sentence there but to the Saint his
[1:42:52] voice as the sound of a sweetly singing
[1:42:55] Brook as you lie at rest satisfied in
[1:42:58] Christ shining upon us with his warming
[1:43:01] rays of love he says fear not I am he
[1:43:06] which was which is which is to
[1:43:10] come this isn't just for John when we
[1:43:13] read this brothers and sisters we need
[1:43:16] to put ourselves in John's shoes and we
[1:43:18] could preach this I I feel like we could
[1:43:20] really get started man John in the
[1:43:22] spirit on the Lord's day he saw that
[1:43:24] door open in heaven he was called up to
[1:43:25] a higher Revelation he was called up to
[1:43:27] a greater calling and when he actually
[1:43:30] realized that boom he was gone wasn't he
[1:43:33] it's the same thing for the believer
[1:43:34] today brothers and sisters I I just need
[1:43:36] to keep reading and stop preaching I'm
[1:43:38] sorry it just gets me excited shining
[1:43:41] upon us with his warming rays of love he
[1:43:43] says fear not I am he which was which is
[1:43:48] which is to come I am the all Almighty
[1:43:51] beside me there is no other I am the
[1:43:55] Alpha and Omega the all of it he's done
[1:43:58] it all brothers and sisters he he's he's
[1:44:02] provided it all and he's done it all he
[1:44:04] is it all he's the lily of the valley

[1:44:09] fairest of 10,000 to my soul yes that
[1:44:12] great day is ready to break and the son
[1:44:15] of righteousness will arise with healing
[1:44:17] in his wings are we okay if we go over
[1:44:20] just a little bit tonight we're two
[1:44:22] pages away from clearing up chapter 2
[1:44:26] and we'll start with chapter 3 next
[1:44:30] week you know uh he goes on to say the
[1:44:32] Victorious
[1:44:35] Christ and when I saw him I fell at his
[1:44:37] feet is dead this is Revelations 1:17
[1:44:39] to8 I fell at his feet is dead and he
[1:44:41] laid his right hand upon me saying unto
[1:44:43] me fear not I am the first and the last
[1:44:47] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:44:49] behold I am alive for ever more amen and
[1:44:52] have the keys of hell and death brother
[1:44:55] Bram says no human could stand the full
[1:44:58] effect of that Vision his strength
[1:45:00] utterly Gone John fell at his feet as
[1:45:02] though
[1:45:03] dead but the hand of the Lord in love
[1:45:07] touched him and the voice of blessing
[1:45:09] said fear not don't be afraid I we know
[1:45:13] it was the same thing that happened to
[1:45:14] Daniel he saw that angel on the other
[1:45:17] side of the river and and he sha like
[1:45:20] lightning his face sha like lightning
[1:45:22] and all the strength fell out of Daniel
[1:45:24] and he was down on his on his face and
[1:45:26] then he was able to get up on his hands
[1:45:28] and knees and the angel told him just be
[1:45:30] strong Daniel be very strong be very
[1:45:32] courageous don't be weak just just be
[1:45:35] strong don't be afraid and isn't it
[1:45:37] wonderful that that's what the Lord
[1:45:39] tells us continually fear not don't be
[1:45:42] afraid I am the first and the last I am
[1:45:45] he that liveth and was dead and behold I
[1:45:47] am alive forever more I I think it's
[1:45:49] just so beautiful when we hear hear that
[1:45:50] it says fear not don't be afraid I am
[1:45:53] the first and the last it's not just
[1:45:54] because he gave a great tremendous
[1:45:56] Revelation The Book of Revelation it's
[1:45:57] not because he just called John fear not
[1:46:00] because I am the first and the last I I
[1:46:02] I brought you into this world I called
[1:46:04] you before the foundation of the of the
[1:46:06] world I spoke your name I put your name
[1:46:08] in the Lamb's Book of Life you don't
[1:46:11] have anything to worry about amen you
[1:46:13] can't sin amen you're Justified amen and
[1:46:18] we had God say to this generation and
[1:46:20] the invisible Union of the Bride you are
[1:46:22] the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of
[1:46:24] Jesus Christ you never did it in the
[1:46:27] beginning Satan did it brothers and
[1:46:31] sisters so don't don't be afraid fear
[1:46:33] not don't be afraid I am the first and
[1:46:36] the last I am he that liveth and was
[1:46:38] dead and behold I'm alive forever more
[1:46:40] he brother bradam he says what is there
[1:46:42] to fear the Judgment that fell upon him
[1:46:44] at the cross at the grave and when he
[1:46:47] descended was for
[1:46:48] us he's done at all we don't have to go
[1:46:52] into judgment brothers and sisters it's
[1:46:54] already been passed the judgment's
[1:46:56] already happened the judge the
[1:47:00] jury the litigation all of it is done he
[1:47:03] says he absorbed the full brunt of the
[1:47:05] wound of sin and there is therefore now
[1:47:07] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:47:10] Christ Jesus amen that's why we keep
[1:47:12] saying get in the spirit get in Christ
[1:47:15] Jesus if you can do that brothers and
[1:47:18] sisters there's rest there 's a Sabbath
[1:47:21] for
[1:47:22] youall he goes on to say see for
[1:47:26] assurity our attorney is our judge amen
[1:47:29] he is both attorney and
[1:47:32] judge as judge the case is
[1:47:36] settled it is
[1:47:38] finished isn't that beautiful Satan
[1:47:41] wants to come around and say no no no no
[1:47:42] no no no there is something there is
[1:47:44] something there is something no no no no
[1:47:45] no we need to remember that we're
[1:47:46] talking about an eternal God we're
[1:47:48] talking about an eternal word and we
[1:47:50] need to take it and bring it back to its
[1:47:52] rightful self don't get caught up in
[1:47:53] time and space in this Dimension take
[1:47:56] Satan right back to this Dimension right
[1:47:58] back to the spirit that John was in on
[1:48:00] the Lord's day and say Satan remember
[1:48:02] that day that's a type of
[1:48:06] me it's not even fair for Satan when we
[1:48:09] can do that because we can tell them you
[1:48:10] know what our judge is our attorney our
[1:48:12] attorney is our judge man and it's over
[1:48:14] it's already been pronounced there is
[1:48:15] therefore now no condemnation to me
[1:48:18] because I don't walk after the flesh I
[1:48:19] walk after the spirit I want to be in
[1:48:21] the spirit every single moment of every
[1:48:23] single day why should the church fear he
[1:48:27] says what promise has he ever failed to
[1:48:29] manifest before us what promise has he
[1:48:33] ever failed to manifest before us have
[1:48:37] we ever seen him fail us one time
[1:48:39] brothers and sister I'm not talking
[1:48:40] about brother Bram not because he did or
[1:48:43] didn't I'm not talking about a man here
[1:48:44] we're talking about Jesus Christ the
[1:48:46] same yesterday today forever the one
[1:48:48] that John saw standing in the midst of
[1:48:50] the golden candlesticks with the Seven
[1:48:52] Stars in his hand with the flame of fire
[1:48:55] as eyes and the hair as white as wolf
[1:48:57] that one how many times has he failed
[1:49:00] us never what do we have to
[1:49:08] fear why should it fear punishment or
[1:49:13] death it has all been
[1:49:16] overcome here is the mighty conqueror
[1:49:19] here is the one who conquered Both
[1:49:20] Worlds of the seen and the Unseen and
[1:49:23] you know that really is the biggest fear
[1:49:24] in human beings many people would say
[1:49:26] it's the fear of public speaking but
[1:49:27] really when you come right down to it
[1:49:28] it's the fear of
[1:49:30] death because you're going to leave this
[1:49:32] world and you're going to go to the next
[1:49:34] you're not going to actually change your
[1:49:36] character you're not going to be a
[1:49:38] different person there you're going to
[1:49:39] be exactly who you are here over there
[1:49:42] that's that's what the prophet said
[1:49:44] that's what God said to us through the
[1:49:45] prophet the person that we are here is
[1:49:47] going to be the person over there the
[1:49:50] only thing we're going to take with us
[1:49:51] is our character either for good or for
[1:49:54] bad that's what's going to go over there
[1:49:56] and there's been many times where I've
[1:49:57] said Lord I can't even look at my
[1:49:59] character I can't even look at this
[1:50:00] character in the mirror and think for a
[1:50:02] second that this character would stand
[1:50:04] before you because I know it won't it
[1:50:06] will never be able to stand before you
[1:50:07] but I need to take it another level I
[1:50:09] need to go back back back back I need to
[1:50:12] go back and find that abstract title
[1:50:14] deed and know that my name is written in
[1:50:15] that Lamb's Book of Life and that's the
[1:50:17] only thing I can identify with I can't
[1:50:19] identify with this flesh if I try and do
[1:50:21] that I'm always going to be up and down
[1:50:23] in and out looking at people talking
[1:50:25] about people going through all these
[1:50:26] different things no that's not a true
[1:50:29] Christian a true Christian someone who
[1:50:31] is truly saved filled with the Holy
[1:50:34] Ghost is only going to be looking at
[1:50:35] that Abstract title deed not just for
[1:50:37] themselves but for their brothers and
[1:50:43] sisters why should it fear punishment or
[1:50:46] death why should we be afraid of death
[1:50:48] brothers and sisters it's only going to
[1:50:50] going to change our dwelling place and
[1:50:51] we're going to go to that place where
[1:50:52] it's just
[1:50:54] beautiful where we don't even have
[1:50:56] comprehension of how good it
[1:50:58] is we got nothing to
[1:51:01] fear but we know we deal with this
[1:51:03] hybrid
[1:51:05] condition what promise has he ever
[1:51:07] failed to manifest before us why should
[1:51:10] it fear punishment or death it has all
[1:51:12] been overcome here is the mighty
[1:51:15] conqueror here is the one who conquered
[1:51:18] Both Worlds of the the seen and the
[1:51:21] Unseen now I just have something I got
[1:51:23] to put in here it just got me thinking
[1:51:24] about it and it just made me want to run
[1:51:26] around the tree and scream and shout and
[1:51:28] just have a little Revival today when I
[1:51:30] was listening to it you know he is the
[1:51:32] Victorious Christ he is the one who is
[1:51:35] the mighty conqueror and it just made me
[1:51:37] think of this scripture Colossians 2:2
[1:51:40] we are buried with him in baptism
[1:51:42] wherein also ye are risen with him
[1:51:44] through the faith of the operation of
[1:51:46] God who hath raised him from the dead
[1:51:49] and you being dead in your sins and of
[1:51:51] the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[1:51:54] quickened together with him having
[1:51:56] forgiven you all
[1:51:58] trespasses he's already done it you're
[1:52:01] already forgiven we've got nothing to be
[1:52:03] accusing anybody of goes on to say
[1:52:06] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:52:08] ordinances that was against
[1:52:11] us which was contrary to us and took it
[1:52:15] out of the way nailing it to his
[1:52:18] cross and hath
[1:52:20] spoiled principalities and powers and
[1:52:24] made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:52:28] over them in it it's already finished
[1:52:31] brothers and sisters I just can't help
[1:52:33] but think when the Devil comes around to
[1:52:35] tempt us let's quote this scripture to
[1:52:37] him let's remind him of this it's
[1:52:39] already done he has made an open display
[1:52:42] of the victory that he has over all of
[1:52:44] those principalities and Powers Satan
[1:52:46] has no power over our marriage Satan has
[1:52:49] no power over our children Satan has no
[1:52:51] power over us those ordinances that were
[1:52:54] written against us they've all been
[1:52:56] blotted
[1:52:58] out and I would even go so far as to say
[1:53:00] this if your name is in the Lamb's Book
[1:53:02] of Life those ordinances were never
[1:53:03] written about
[1:53:04] you maybe it's going a little bit far
[1:53:07] but I believe it that way brothers and
[1:53:08] sisters if your name was in the Lamb's
[1:53:10] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:53:12] the world there ain't no ordinance was
[1:53:14] ever written against you because you're
[1:53:16] not you if you're in that book that you
[1:53:18] that we're talking about is a of God
[1:53:20] himself
[1:53:23] am I this is just so rich here is the
[1:53:27] one who conquered Both Worlds of the
[1:53:29] seen and the Unseen not like Alexander
[1:53:31] who conquered the world at age 33 and
[1:53:33] knew no other way to turn for further
[1:53:35] Conquest so he died a victim of sin and
[1:53:38] riotous living you know I I I I I was
[1:53:41] wondering why would the prophet put this
[1:53:43] in here why would this even be in here I
[1:53:44] just can't help but think this is
[1:53:46] potentially the life of someone that
[1:53:48] doesn't remain consecrated to the world
[1:53:49] word we can have Conquest after Conquest
[1:53:52] after conquest and eventually just get
[1:53:54] tired and comfortable and say you know
[1:53:55] what we're on on top of the world we're
[1:53:57] saved man we've got the message of the
[1:54:00] hour we got the prophet I've got
[1:54:01] everything in my life I've had so many
[1:54:03] victories in my life and you know what
[1:54:05] can happen we can wind up dying with
[1:54:07] Riot is living in our lives spiritually
[1:54:09] speaking if we don't keep the conquest
[1:54:11] keep the conquest don't be like him he
[1:54:14] says not like Napoleon who conquered all
[1:54:16] Europe but finally Was Defeated at
[1:54:18] waterl and banished to El
[1:54:20] only to find himself he himself
[1:54:23] conquered but nothing could conquer
[1:54:25] Christ he that descended has now
[1:54:27] ascended above all and unto him has been
[1:54:29] given a name that is above every name
[1:54:32] yes he conquered death hell and the
[1:54:34] grave and has the keys thereof what he
[1:54:37] looses is loosed and what he binds is
[1:54:41] bound there is no changing of it there
[1:54:45] was no conquering before him and there
[1:54:47] was none beside him he alone is the
[1:54:51] savior Redeemer he is the only God and
[1:54:54] Lord Jesus Christ is his name amen don't
[1:54:58] fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all
[1:55:02] that I am you are air to all my power is
[1:55:07] yours Hallelujah my omnipotence is yours
[1:55:11] as I stand in your midst thank you
[1:55:16] Lorden I don't know man I just think
[1:55:18] this makes me want to jump and
[1:55:21] Shout I have not come to bring fear and
[1:55:24] failure but love and courage and
[1:55:30] ability all power is given unto
[1:55:35] me and it's yours to
[1:55:39] use it's yours to
[1:55:42] use now some folks would want to say
[1:55:44] well this was just a Prophet this was
[1:55:45] just the prophet of God he was putting
[1:55:47] this together and maybe he had someone
[1:55:49] helping him put all the words grammar
[1:55:51] tizing all this together but then
[1:55:52] there's others that are going to say
[1:55:53] this is God speaking to us tonight
[1:55:55] through a prophet through a Vindicated
[1:55:57] dispensational Prophet these words made
[1:55:59] it to print for a reason so that the
[1:56:01] church in the last day could be
[1:56:03] encouraged to recognize she doesn't have
[1:56:05] to be tossed from Pillar To Post she can
[1:56:07] recognize her
[1:56:09] position my you speak the word and I'll
[1:56:12] perform
[1:56:15] it amen that's my Covenant and it can
[1:56:19] never f fail my goodness Seven Stars and
[1:56:22] candlesticks we're just about done one
[1:56:23] more page Revelations 1:20 The Mystery
[1:56:27] of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in
[1:56:29] my right hand and the Seven golden
[1:56:31] candlesticks the Seven Stars are the
[1:56:32] Angels messengers of the seven churches
[1:56:35] and the Seven candlesticks which thou
[1:56:37] sawest are the seven
[1:56:40] churches we have already discovered the
[1:56:42] truth of these two Mysteries oh we
[1:56:44] haven't revealed who these seven
[1:56:46] Messengers were but by the help of God
[1:56:48] we will and that mystery will be
[1:56:51] accomplished The Seven Ages we know they
[1:56:53] are listed in the word and we will deal
[1:56:56] with each so as to come up to this last
[1:56:59] age in which we live but one last
[1:57:03] closing glimpse of this chapter see him
[1:57:06] as he stands there in the midst of the
[1:57:08] golden lampstands with the Seven Stars
[1:57:10] in his right hand oh it is breathtaking
[1:57:13] to see him standing there in his Supreme
[1:57:16] deity amen do you ever just read that
[1:57:19] script

[1:57:24] close I don't want to keep us late here
[1:57:26] you ever you ever do that though you
[1:57:27] ever read this scripture Revelations 1
[1:57:30] where it describes Jesus Christ standing
[1:57:32] there in the midst of his church it's
[1:57:34] breathtaking he is the judge the priest
[1:57:37] the king the eagle the lamb the lion the
[1:57:40] alpha the Omega the beginning and the
[1:57:42] end the father and the Son and the Holy
[1:57:44] Ghost he which was which is which is to
[1:57:47] come the almighty the all and all
[1:57:50] there he is the author and
[1:57:53] finisher Worthy is the Lamb my maybe
[1:57:56] stand with me tonight as we close he
[1:57:58] proved his worth as he brought our
[1:58:01] salvation by himself now he stands in
[1:58:04] all his power and All His glory with all
[1:58:07] things committed to him as judge
[1:58:12] my I feel like we could just Rapture he
[1:58:15] says yes there he stands amidst the
[1:58:18] lampstands with the star stars in his
[1:58:20] hand it's night for that is when we use
[1:58:23] lamps for light and that is when the
[1:58:25] stars are seen shining and reflecting
[1:58:27] the light of the sun and it is dark the
[1:58:30] church is walking by faith in its
[1:58:32] Darkness her Lord departed this Earth
[1:58:36] but the Holy Spirit still shines out
[1:58:38] through the church giving light to this
[1:58:40] old sin cursed world my and those stars
[1:58:44] reflect his light also the only light
[1:58:46] they have is his light how dark it is
[1:58:49] how spiritually Cold Yet when he comes
[1:58:51] into the
[1:58:53] midst and is light and
[1:58:56] warm then the church is empowered and
[1:58:58] through him does the works that he
[1:59:02] did brother bradam says this here oh
[1:59:04] that we might get a glimpse of him as
[1:59:06] John did my what manner of people we
[1:59:10] ought to be standing before him at that
[1:59:13] day if you have not already given your
[1:59:16] life to him may you turn your heart to
[1:59:19] God at this moment amen and kneel down
[1:59:22] right where you are and ask his
[1:59:25] forgiveness for your sins and surrender
[1:59:28] your life to
[1:59:29] him he says then we will attempt to
[1:59:32] approach the seven Church ages together
[1:59:35] and as we do I pray that God will help
[1:59:38] this unworthy servant to reveal his word
[1:59:40] to you God bless you tonight let's just
[1:59:43] bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father
[1:59:47] Lord
[1:59:48] Jesus
[1:59:50] if we could truly see you as John saw
[1:59:53] you how marvelous Lord to recognize that
[1:59:57] you've already judged
[1:59:59] us and you have found us Lord that we
[2:00:03] are
[2:00:04] redeemed you have already pronounced us
