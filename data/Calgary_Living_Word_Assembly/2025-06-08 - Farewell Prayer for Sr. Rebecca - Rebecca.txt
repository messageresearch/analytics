TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, this morning we are truly honored and privileged, Lord, to stand in your presence, Lord, with your daughter. Father, we're so thankful for her testimony, Lord Jesus, of her life here in this assembly, Lord. I remember back to when she was here with her parents, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, and you've seen fit since then to take both of her parents home, Lord. Father, now you've granted her the desire of her heart, Lord Jesus, to go on and become a wife, Father. Lord Jesus, what an honor, Father, we pray that you would just bless her abundantly, Father, that you would grant her, continue granting her the desires of her heart, Lord Jesus. Father, that she would just be a good wife to her husband and that her husband would be a strong leader, oh Father, not naturally, but spiritually and naturally, Lord. Father, we're so thankful for the pattern that you've given us in your word, Lord Jesus. We have a direction. We have leadership, Lord. Oh, Father. And we pray that Sister Rebecca and Brother Victor would just keep you first in their life every day of their lives, Lord. That their marriage would be centered around you, Father. And Lord, if it be your will for them to have children, Father, that you would grant it to them in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh, Father, and that they would raise them in the fear and the admonition of you, Lord, if you should terry, Father, we're so thankful for Sister Rebecca's life and her testimony and the gifts you've placed in there. We pray that you would just keep your hand upon her as she travels, Lord, every single day of her life. And Father, we'll be careful to give you the praise when we hear the testimony after the wedding. Bless their wedding. Bless their ceremony. Bless the church they will attend, Father. And Lord, we pray for their sisters, Lord. Her sisters here in Calgary. They'll miss her, Lord. Oh, Father, the body here will miss her, Father. But we're so thankful for your goodness to us, Lord. We just pray, Lord. We ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. And as a body here, we just like to present you with this as a wedding gift, a token of our appreciation to you, sister. [Applause] [Music]
