TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uplift hand father and maybe there's some Lord secret requests that are deep in the heart of of the people here today Lord that they haven't acknowledged even father Lord we pray that you would just meet those requests father sovereignly in the name of Jesus Christ and now father as we go forwards we just want to commit this service into your hands for your glory Lord that we would not be the same Lord when we leave this building today where we would be changed from Glory unto Glory father we love you and we thank you we just commit all of these needs into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you musicians thank you everyone for the specials today what a tremendous blessing it is to hear the voice I'll say voice of all the little children God bless you Sister Shelly for doing that for having that on your heart every single year to hear the voice of the youth the voice of the children God bless you Aunt Ruth my seeing faces all over the place here but just to uh hear the voice of worship coming from the children going back to my thought you know how uh we don't know how long the Lord's going to T we we we've heard it said many times from some of the old folks that they expected to see the Rapture happen yeah who knows when maybe the the time that brother brandham fell off the scene that that he was promoted into heaven that the Rapture was supposed to take place that was 50 60 years ago and you know who knows brothers and sisters there could be 50 60 more years we don't want to try and put a time stamp on what God's doing this is his work we're just going to be soldiers laboring in the field for him and if we don't train up these children in the way they should go who's going to be the next church it's very important for us to do and uh I just think it's a tremendous tremendous thing that's happening to see all these young people you know brothers and sisters I just want to say this I'm just going to preach today I hope it's okay I just want to say this when when we renovated this building we had a discussion wondering is there going to be people that will come into this building and I look out here today and we can see it that it's full oh it's a tremendous blessing brothers and sisters we maybe for those people that don't know this used to be a community center and where that Nursery is the back window there that used to be a whole kitchen and up here there used to be a bathroom on this side I think it was the men's on that side and the ladies was on this side and the stage was probably another two feet higher and there was a big big bulkhead that went across here and when when we renovated this when we took it all apart and put it all back together again we framed it all and we had so many conversations will there be Sunday school that will come and sing the Praises of the Lord here on this stage and we can say that that that that scripture that uh that prophecy those words have been fulfilled maybe it's not a scripture but you know it's just a tremendous thing it goes more goes much further than just saying you know isn't it nice to see all the little kids gathered on the stage brothers and sisters we had prayed about this we had labored for this and here we are what a tremendous thing if you have your Bibles this morning I would just like to uh read a scripture out of Matthew Chapter 2 we're going to talk about the Christmas story today maybe from a little bit of a different perspective we'll just see what the Lord has in store and then uh I I just want to follow along what brother bradam preached on here out of a message that he preached in 1963 after this seals were preach God's gifts always find their places and brother Ram talks about this message in here we'll just start reading with verse one of Matthew Chapter 2 now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land land of Judea art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when he have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasure measures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh yes and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed on their own departed into their own country another way if you'll turn with me over to St John John chapter 3 very familiar scripture John 3: 16 it's the same God today brothers and sisters for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son amen that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting lasting life let's just bow one more time gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful that you are the same yesterday today and forever and Lord we're so thankful that we're not looking for a child in a Manger we're not looking for a baby we're not looking for a a a young child we're looking for the literal person of Jesus Christ Living out through us and father we pray that Lord as these wise men they were wise how they searched diligently to find that child we pray that Lord Jesus we would SE search diligently to find your very life living out through US Lord and father I pray that each and every one of us would not stop until we see your very life living out through US Lord as we go forwards we just Commit This service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning you may be seated just a couple of announcements we have brother Emanuel sarpong taking the service this Wednesday certainly excited to hear what the Lord has put on his heart amen we have uh regular service next Sunday at 10:00 a.m. there won't be a a communion service this year we're just going to have I I just want to encourage Fellowship between uh brothers and sisters and families just get together have people over and just Worship the Lord together pour from vessel to vessel have real Fellowship around the things of the Lord um are you happy this morning amen Christmas Eve we know the whole world is running to and fro up and down in the earth looking to see what they can buy scrolling up and down in the phone apps and tablets and computers and spending spending spending we know Christmas has become something completely commercialized and uh uh it's it's amazing when you see the way the world is gone but we're certainly thankful because we've been given the ability to desire the sincere milk of the word to desire the word for our day and that is something uh Beyond Compare we could never go out and buy the desire to find the Lord Jesus Christ we could never just order up a little bit of Faith it's the Lord himself that has descended with a shout amen and you know uh this morning we we're going to have a real special service today I was just ecstatic when I heard that we actually are going to have a baptism after service so I apologize for anyone that has a turkey in the oven today if anybody's got a ham or whatever um you're more than welcome to go early if you need to go because of that or we can uh we can just put it on hold you know there's no no reason why if there is something going on like that we can't just whisper a prayer and ask the Lord to save our meal can pretty much guarantee you he will because this is for the right purpose brothers and sisters right it is yeah we're excited to see what the Lord wants to do anytime somebody wants to get baptized it's such a tremendous blessing yes it so we're excited to uh have a baptism after service and then uh and then we'll be able to get on with our our Christmases excuse me a little bit as I adjust um certainly thankful for the uh the concert that we saw on the weekend it was uh it was an amazing show and God bless you brother Toby for having the desire to put that together uh hopefully next year we can find a way to accommodate everyone it just wasn't possible uh this year to accommodate everyone and uh I think there's a recording going to be available I don't think it is yet but uh they're going to edit it and I'm sure that it would be shared with anyone who is interested so um in time I'm sure we'll hear about it um talking about the story today I think it's just a a wonderful story and we heard a little bit about it at the concert and I just was trying to find the mind of the Lord and you know many times I not really interested in trying to preach a Christmas message and I think maybe that's the Lord correcting me a little bit about it but maybe I should be a little bit more on Trend maybe I should want to preach uh Christmas Story and I just got thinking about it today you know how important it is to to recognize that God sends gifts and and they always find their place always they don't sometimes or or most of the time God's gifts always always always find their place am and uh you know brother Brandon preaches this message God's gifts always find their places I'll I'll probably preach the majority from that message and and I just think it's it's a wonderful thing looking at this uh this idea of Christmas and you know how we have Christmas celebrated in the world many different ways but it it's become a big commercialized deal and you know I I think I heard it said before and you probably have as well how you could do a survey now and and ask what the meaning of Christmas is we were once again we were just driving in the car and you know we we didn't have the message going I apologize it was the Billy Graham Station again and you know when you listen to that man preach if you have the understanding and the Insight that he was one of the two angels sent down to Sodom to preach to Blind them when you hear that man Minister if you haven't heard him I would strongly recommend just listen under the the light of of the message of the hour and hear what he has to say and he was talking and and under his anointing that man could preach and and he really spelled it out how talking about Christmas how you could do a survey and and there's children everywhere that that were given what what what what does Christmas mean to you and I think they asked maybe 50 kids and out of 50 children not one of them said Jesus Christ this was back in 1990 I think it was that he he ministered I could be wrong maybe it was in 80 I I can't remember the date specifically but it was quite a while ago but still to think about it you know even if it was 20 years ago 30 years ago back then not one child out of 50 could say the name Jesus it was gifts it was cards it was music it was carols it was Santa it was all these different things I wonder how much farther down the road are we brothers and sisters we were having a conversation a at at a dinner table speaking about the word of God you know and it's an invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ today that's what's going on with the message of the hour the further we go down the road having the ability to believe this word the more united we become with with our our bridegroom and you know at the same time the rest of the world isn't just sitting by Idol what's happening is they're becoming United with their bridegroom also both things are happening at the exact same time and that's why we say it again and again brothers and sisters outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will be United with the wrong head the wrong headship the wrong bridegroom but when you get baptized with the Holy Ghost in your life by Jesus Christ himself then you're sealed till the day of your Redemption you will not have to go unto the mark of the beast because we know full well to reject the baptism of the holy spirit is to receive the mark of the beast don't look for a day where you're going to see something in the back of your hand or something in your forehead because we know that brother bradam said it very clearly the back of the hand spiritually speaking is your action and in the forehead is the thought so the mark of the beast is to resist the Holy Ghost and to actually have a thought to resist and to move your hand to act upon that resistance thought that's the mark of the beast it's a spiritual Mark brothers and sisters it's not covid it's not a vaccine it doesn't matter what Bill Gates tries to do it's irrelevant God's going to do what God wants done and he sent a prophet to say what the mark of the beast is and you know we're already in that hybrid condition we talked about this a little while ago hear people say oh they're serpent seed you know what brothers and sisters outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so are you because you're still hybrid just like them there's one difference one can actually receive the word of God for their day and the other one can't that's the only difference but for the grace of God there go I that's why it's so incredibly important and I'll never stop preaching it until the day that I I die or I go in the sky whichever it is you got to get the Holy Ghost and I think it's so tremendous that Brother Andy sarpong not Brother Andy brother Benny sarpong today brother Andy has been baptized brother Benny sarpong has asked to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we know that he knows why sorry Brothers it's not about conforming to a church standard it's understanding that there's more to this than just a Church standard than saying that I've got a a message believing household and that's where I live that's where I come from I know the seals I know all the messages and the Mysteries it's not about that at all it's about getting the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know those people that have it they're the ones that are saying amen and I just pray that everyone else would get to that place where we would all say Amen truly that's what we need that's the Christmas message brothers and sisters that's the reason why he came so that he could be raised up and be tempted in like manner in all points just like the rest of us but then lay his life down for all of his friends than but before he did that what did he do in the garden he asked the father can I just have them for Fellowship can can we just have Fellowship that's what we want we really want to be together in the end and and you know then he laid his life down and and and he was risen again and we know that he gave gifts unto men he came back and he L himself upon the church in clothing tongues of fire and we know that we got a prophet in our age that said that was actually the pillar of fire came down and divided himself amongst the church so that every single one of the people that could call upon the name of Jesus Christ could have their own pillar of fire experience sorry I'm getting a little excited about this but I just think it's beautiful I just want to I just want to go into uh you know brother bradam talking about this and you know a little bit about Christmas we we live live in a a world that's very commercialized and we can we can get caught up in it one way or the other we can go extremely far in one side and extremely far on the other side and brothers and sisters we just need to go right down the middle of the road trusting that the Lord will give us the way of Holiness we preached it a while ago you know there's a highway but there is also a way that is a way of Holiness and get the Holy Ghost and he'll show you that way don't ask someone to tell you what that way is because I guarantee you if you rely upon a man or you rely upon your own instincts those senses remember we said that last Sunday we preached before brother codre was here those five senses will lie because they'll never all the time go in line with the word of God there will be times where they will actually deviate from the word of God and that's where we've got to Reign it in and say nope be it unto me according to Thy word brother brandom out of God's Gift always find their places he says see and I know them I know the but I'm looking back on my life and I wonder where it happened from them first little Christmases when we hang up our stockings and and Mama would get we'd probably get an orange and two or three little pieces of striped candy and that was a great Christmas to us amen but you know kids they look forward to them gifts we find out that Christmas is mainly to the children they look forward to it nowadays it's it's turned off to the children but it really should be adults it should be teaching children what real Christmas is amen and I totally do not believe that that Christ could be born on the 25th day of December in Judea cuz it's colder than it is right now here see oh and how could the the Shepherds be keeping their flocks by night then the Taxation and everything and Mary having to come that far from excuse me way down in Bethlehem up into Judea excuse me up into Jerusalem rather for the taxation I could could I hardly could believe that come up believe she come to Nazareth and so when how that would could be done it could not be done but I believe that Christ was born in in spring because in every way he was a lamb see you notice he was born in a barn and not in the house and when they took him to the cross the others as far as we know that he never said about him leading them but they led him did you know a lamb or a sheep has to be led to the slaughter it will not go to the slaughter you have to lead it there and usually it's a goat that lead leads the Sheep In The Killing pens they have a goat and the Goat will walk up this Runway till he gets up to the Sheep started down the runway to be killed and then the goat will jump out but when they come a time they're going to kill a goat he really kicks up a fuss he has to go in but of course you couldn't blame him amen but it's a thing how a sheep has to be led and he was led to the slaughter they led him he was a lamb and we know I'm going to throw this in there that the word says that he was dumb as a lamb before his shears it didn't say a word he had tremendous opportunity to say a word and the only thing he did say when he was before Pilate when he said are you a king don't you know who I am I've got the power to take your life and lay it down he said you don't have any power at all except for my father gives it to you but hey you said it brother bradam he goes on to say and I believe in that way being altogether nature and Lambs are born in March April and somewhere along in there not later than May and I don't believe it was anything before March and anything after May sometime along in there but when the church Christianity was married into romanism was at the NAA Council when they accepted the Roman Nation accepted Christianity and made what they called the universal religion was Christianity they made made the universal religion and they worshiped idols and they had a sun god and right now from the 21st to the 25th the sun almost stands in its same track as it's passing what is it you call that I bean I thought I knew it but I can't think of it the sun it gains so much and loses so much it's the solstice I'm throwing it in there until the 20 being the 21st and the 25th of December oh I forget what they call it what someone says Eclipse no eclipse is when it passes the Sun and Moon passes together it's something in there I can almost say it but I can't now however it's that standstill of the sun which is called by the Romans that's when the circus went on it's called the son God's birthday they celebrated it from the 21st to the 25th of December so then being that this was converted Rome into Christianity was accepted in their way in Rome then they said we'll make the same celebration and make the son of God's birthday see the son God Jupiter's birthday then son of God's birthday 25th of December but what difference does it make I love how he brings it back to Center what difference does it make brothers and sisters see today when we are even if it's if it's uh if they was doing it in July or August or whenever it might be it's still the sacredness of remembering that God gave us the hope that we have in US amen so I just want to say this brothers and sisters I know I've heard it in varying degrees that oh if you say Merry Christmas whoa you shouldn't say that because we believe the message of the hour you know what brother Bram said it many times even after the seals were open he said Merry Christmas I'm not here to try and tell you what you should or you shouldn't do except for one thing that you should do get the Holy Ghost let the Holy Ghost Lead You In what you should do and what you should say and see what he says about it and you know if you ask him is this appropriate Lord he'll tell you exactly he'll let you know whether it's appropriate or not but Christmas happened yes Christmas actually happened Jesus was actually born in flesh Jesus was God in flesh the Creator in flesh because outside of God's blood where would we be we would be lost but what difference does it make he said see today even if they was doing it in July or August or whatever it might be it's still the sacredness of remembering that God gave us the hope that we have in us and now you say well the rest of them's all Santa Claus and going on like they do why we just might as well do it he says it no sir no this is not a pagan celebration to us this is a sacred hour if there had been no Christmas there would be no Resurrection if there had been no Christmas there'd be no love if there'd be no peace there'd be no Hereafter for the believer if there had been no Christmas am and now you say well the rest of the world they just well see the fork lightning and the black Cloudy Skies show that there can be light in a time of Darkness I just love the way that he says this brothers and sisters it's so important for us I believe to just maybe listen to it and and take it in and just hear what he says the whole context of it these lights tonight prove that there can be light in a time of darkness and when does light shine best in darkness you turn these lights on in daytime and the sun is shining you'll hardly notice they're on but just once just one little we light will shine real bright in a time of darkness and right now is the darkest when every Christian should give a testimony of the hope that's in him of Jesus Christ the son of God shines light shines the brightest when it's the most dark brothers and sisters we can see this world is commercialized all around us many people would say Christmas is a real dark time and you know I've said it from the pulpit which which is worse Halloween or Christmas and and I think it's maybe a shocker to say it but what's the spirit behind each one brothers and sisters right are we actually celebrating Christ Jesus the birth of Christ Jesus in our hearts as our brother prayed earlier today is it truly a personal relationship with Jesus Christ in our lives or is it just a celebration it's a good turkey my goodness we're going to have a real good turkey it's an organically grown turkey and we're going to have the best of the vegetables and you know we've got some gifts and I just can't wait to give these special gifts that I bought for everyone and you know is that what Christmas is or is it actually a time to reflect that none of this would be happening had we not had a birth of Jesus Christ Hallelujah am right there has to be a testimony of the hope hope that's in him life of a believer of Jesus Christ the son of God brother Bram says not some Chris kingle that was born back Yonder you know and some kind of a lit tree up and went down through the forest one night some fiction story that there's no bottom to it but we believe solid L on the promised word of a coming Messiah and he was born on Christmas day 20 pretty near 2,000 years ago we believe brother Bram talks about it in in the message of the hour how important it is to not lie to our children we don't want to lie to our children brothers and sisters and tell them that there's a criss cringle or that there's a Santa Claus we want to tell our children that there's Jesus Christ am and tell our children that there is a Santa it's a fable sure there's a Santa everybody talks about Santa you see pictures of Santa everywhere but he's not real he doesn't come down the chimney with a bunch of presents and give them to the children that's not what happens we give gifts to one another in remembrance of the gift that was actually given to us that's the purpose of giving gifts some people take it to the extreme and it's tremendous amounts of gifts and other people won't recogn ize it at all and not give their children even a piece of candy for Christmas brothers and sisters there's got to be a balance somewhere there's got to be a middle of the road for it amen I think it's beautiful how we've been given a prophet he's he's given us a real perspective that that's that's I want to say down home it's not Pious High in the sky and and and making the families feel so uncomfortable that they really wonder the children Wonder do I want to serve this God because it's so weird and and and and uncomfortable but then it's not the other side where we just we just put a Christmas tree on the stage of our church right we recognize it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Holy Ghost himself you know the last time we preached we talked about faith and I just want to put this in there I'm not done with it I I really deviated I was going to go this way but felt led to go this way with the Christmas story today but uh you know we want to talk about faith brothers and sisters Faith needs to be preached and and it's not just a first or second pole faith that I'm talking about brothers and sisters we're talking about third pole faith and that third pole Faith isn't just to create things and to have an existence and and to satisfy the the lust of our flesh I've got a hungry stomach so I need to speak some food into existence maybe there'll come a time where that will just manifest but what we're talking about today brothers and sisters is to have rapturing faith in our lives because without faith in our lives it's impossible to please God I do not want to deviate from that thought we're going to go that direction in the future it is impossible to please him we know that Enoch had that testimony before he was translated and that was that he pleased God how do we please God brothers and sisters how do we please God I want to just put that in there in our hearts in our Minds that maybe we can just ponder it while we have time in fellowship with our family and our friends over the Christmas holidays how do we please God is it just coming to church is it knowing the message of the hour is it saying that God sent a prophet or is it actually demonstrating through the very lives that we live [Music] Hallelujah without faith it's impossible to please him right and I just believe that everyone that believes has the ability to have that Tes testimony and then every once in a while we'll actually have to give a word or two to actually go along with that testimony we talked about the senses last time as well to go along with that faith and our senses can only get in the way we know that we've been given our senses to contact this world and it's important to recognize that we can we can we can be so Heavenly minded brothers and sisters that we're not any Earthly good that's amen we live in this world we've got to pay our taxes we've got to go to work we got to provide for our families or we're worse than an Infidel is what the word of God says we have to be willing to just follow the basic things in this life we've got to be willing to do that but you know what when when we do all of that something Supernatural happens God blesses us because we're marching forward by faith we can't just say that God's going to bless me and I'm going to do nothing for it that's not the way it works every single day Israel when they went into the promised land they had to get out of bed get out of their tents March and get inform formed and stand still and watch the glory of the Lord he didn't say just stay in your just stay in your tent don't worry about it just relax just take the day off and I'll go fight the battles for you that's not the way it worked everyone had to March everyone had to do their part amen everyone was a part of it getting into our story today I really didn't want to be too long I'm so sorry I'll try and just get going here you know talking about our story I think it's beautiful um if you look at the the the story and and how the three kings they they came to to Jerusalem they were looking for this baby these these three kings the wise men the the Magi these these men the Bible says that there were three and and we heard it at the concert that it it's it's so good I believe brother John said it really well that you know the Bible doesn't say there was three there was three gifts that were given that's what the Bible says a and tradition has taken and made it three kings we know there's songs written about it and it's not necessarily three it's three gifts that were given to the baby and and I'll back up on that one too because we know that by this time it wasn't a baby the prophet for our day said you can read the word of God and I I went and call it fact checked it I had to dig it up and and look it up in in the scripture a little further ahead and we know that the Bible refers to the baby as the baby but here we have a young child the word of God says in the scripture that we read that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod they they they came looking for the king of the Jews a and and you know it's verse 11 and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worship him they didn't come to a stable with a Manger of hay they came to a house that's what the word said they came to the house and they found the child and we know that Herod he caught wind that this was happening and what did he do Herod was a lunatic he was he was a puppet that was set up by Rome to say that you need a king you better have a king you can be the king but you better do exactly what we tell you a and so here he was this mad man and what did he say he decreed that somebody else was going to be the king the Jews how could that be Mr insecurity what did he do he made a decree that everyone two years old and younger will just Slaughter him just get rid of them do away with them perfect plan right we know the angel of the Lord came to them in a dream and said you know what Joseph it's time to get up and get your wife and that child out of here you get them and you protect them get them out of the land because we know that herod's going to do this terrible deed but but we we just look at this and and I just want to try and hit the highlights right right there and and I'm just going to read a bunch of quotes today out of this message and and why Jesus had to come to Bethlehem you know continuing on with this uh paragraph 29 I don't know if it comes up that way and Christ is our Bethlehem and could prove that every man that's born of God is born in Bethlehem have you been born in Bethlehem how can that be brothers and sisters we look at that and say here we have the prophet of God saying everyone that's been born of God has been born in Bethlehem I was born in cla's home Alberta how could that be he goes on to say it and that's what he was the bread of life and Beth Beth means house and L is God and elhem is elhem which means bread and House of God's bread and Jesus Christ was the house of God's bread bread of eternal life and we know that that's what Jesus declared isn't it I am the bread that's come down from heaven and every man that's borned into Christ you're borned into Bethlehem God's house of bread and how that the leagues of these churches today is Garrison like the Philistines to keep the people from it and we know that the the Philistines were garrisoned out around Bethlehem and the Shepherds they kept their watch they the the whole story is in there brother bradam he talks about it why why it it had to be Bethlehem there's a few different messages and uh the story is really good I don't want to go too far that way with it I want to talk about the wise men and and their gifts and and how God's gifts they always find their places and you know I just think this is such a wonderful thing this this quote just jumped out at me as I was studying this and brother brandham he says that God God can use every single faculty of our being Hallelujah every single faculty of our being we can try and use every single faculty of our being and we can be misled I can have an emotion I can have a memory I can have my own reasoning I I could have my own fear I could have my own doubt I could have all these different things happening inside of me and and if I try and do it brothers and sisters it won't turn out right as human beings it won't turn out right brother bradam he says what does it teach us right here before we hit our text here's what it teaches us that God can use every faculty or being if it's committed surrendered unto him hallelujah amen he can use our mind he can use our dreams and just I'll throw this in there for time sake I know I've got a lot of quotes today from this message but brother Bram is talking specifically here about the dreams you can go back and listen to it or or read it if you'd like to but how the angel came and said Joseph take your wife and get out of the land in a dream and brother Bram says that dreams are secondary and we need to make sure that we just hit that point to dreams are secondary God will speak to us through a dream but it will always be in line with the word of God and it will always come to pass and if it doesn't come to pass and it's not in line with the word of God then just leave it alone brothers and sisters we have a lot of Dreams in our lives but this is what brother bam is talking about God will use any single faculty of Our Lives don't ever doubt it for a second that God can use every faculty of our being if it's committed surrendered unto him he can use your mind our dreams our subconscious our first conscious our tongue our songs our eyes our everything that we have can be used of God if it's committed to God see I think that's so beautiful that that means let's just just talk about the one thing he said we can see if we commit it to God we can actually have God use that faculty in our lives we can look at someone and say oh I see they're not living right for God you know what brothers and sisters the maturity of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives is going to give us the ability to say that's not what I see though because I'm not looking through my eyes I'm looking through the faculty of the Holy Ghost at that person and you know what maybe their children aren't living for the Lord today but what is that to me that's not the seed Gene of God God put a seed in their life and it's such a beautiful thing because that's what I see I see the life of Jesus Christ Living out through that child living out through that wife living out through that husband living out through that mother that father that brother that sister God Amen we have the ability to do that am I want to actually back up on that God has the ability to do that on our own we'll never be able to to do that but boy oh boy when we become a spiritual giant with the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we get a lot of Grace for people right amen because we recognize that if we didn't have his grace Amen in our lives where would we be how could we ever be who we are without having his grace law that's not going to do a thing for us especially for our children children are pretty smart I've said it for years they're smart they can see when someone's a legalist when they live with my dos and don'ts that's what it is children get fed up with that and they say why would we be different people at church than we are at home why wouldn't we just live our lives eat and drink today for tomorrow we just die there's no life to the message of the hour but boy oh boy when children see their parents have true humility the humility of Jesus Christ in their lives when their parents can come to them and say hey I was wrong will you forgive me when children see that kind of a life it's not a normal human life the normal human life says no way I'm dead I've got the pride of life and I know exactly all about it all and what I say goes and nobody can deviate from that okay that's not the way that we want God to deal with us though is it and boy you know I I just have to hit on this I'm sorry but I I I'm going to talk about it in the future we're not going to get away from it when brother Cadre was talking about it can you believe that there's wives afraid of their husbands in the message of the hour is that even possible brothers and sisters I don't know I believe that was a spirit of God Discerning something here and I want to say this if we as a husband have created fear in the lives of our wives That's not the spirit of Jesus Christ Living out through you brother that's not the spirit of Christ because the spirit of Christ doesn't rule by fear amen he Rules by love and which one of us as the Bride of Jesus Christ would want to live in fear of our husband my for me I I I just about hit the floor when I heard that I thought goodness sakes wives afraid of their husbands Lord have mercy if we can submit ourselves everything that we have can be used of God if it's committed to God see everything that you are commit it to God young people today I want to say it everything that you are commit it to God he'll use every outlet and every part of you he'll use it no matter what it is he'll use it if it's Sanctified to his purpose and calling amen and you old people too give it to the Lord amen let the Lord have the gift let let let let the gift find its place amen and God will use it tremendously and you know brother bam he says it he goes on to say it here in paragraph 44 here there's only one gift that you can give and that is yourself give yourself to God because God's already give you his gift now there's only one thing you owe back to God that's yourself to him Hallelujah I think it's so beautiful you know talking about this story The the Christmas Story the birth of Jesus we know that the Holy Ghost came and and and overpowered shouldn't say overpowered overshadowed Mary amen and and she was found with child of the Holy Ghost and and what was it that happened in in that that meeting that happened between her and Gabriel the Angel messenger for her day he he brought a message to her and said thou highly favored amongst women and the only thing that she did was give herself back to that angel and said you know what I don't understand this but hey I know that someone's supposed to fulfill the scripture so be it unto me according to Thy word amen behold the handmade of the Lord and what happened we know in that moment the Holy Ghost overshadowed her and conception happened and we talked about it in the past and I just want to say it today brothers and sisters let that spiritual conception happen in our lives just commit ourselves to him maybe we don't understand some of the stuff we hear about the message of the hour but just surrender yourself unto him commit yourself unto him and just see if he won't use that gift amen we know that the word of God says to uh humble ourselves in in in what in the sight of the Lord amen and he will lift you up amen so I want to say this today brothers and sisters where's God's eyes today are they just off in heaven somewhere in another dimension are they in a church somewhere I'll say it they're in your brother and they're in your sister they're in your mother and your father they're in your husband they're in your wife those are the eyes of God humble yourself in the sight of the Lord brothers and sisters and see if he won't lift you up guarantee you he will you know we talked about this uh earlier they didn't find a baby in the manger in paragraph 48 I need to keep going here brother Bram he says now watch God what a strange thing it is tonight to see that these men Magis learned men Great Men coming down from the East that was Babylon which was India and they never come in any all night and and started one night and just got there the next they were about two years getting there this was something that was happening and as I was studying this I just many times we hear it and and and I know it can just sometimes be common to us but I I don't ever want it to just get common to me brothers and sisters and I pray that it won't for you either but I just was thinking about it how brother Bram talked about them seeing that light and nobody else could see that light and you know we've been given the ability to see a light we talked about it before you know that that Supernatural picture that was taken that you know JC Lacy I think it is he's the one that that verified that it was actually the first photograph Supernatural photo and and it even hangs in the Hall of Fame in Washington DC today it's an actual picture it's not just a story but there are Supernatural lights that people can see when God wants you to amen and just to throw it out there we know that Billy Paul he got the chance to see the angel but after the angel left there was a supernatural light in the color of a rainbow in the corner of the room we can see Supernatural lights but anyways these Magi and and they never come in any all night and started one night and got in there the next two they were about two years getting there they never come to a little baby in a Manger they come to a young child a young child and Herod killed the children from 2 years old see to know that wasn't a little infant lying in a cradle he'd just kill all the infants but he killed the young children so that he'd be sure to get them I just think it's beautiful when you think about this sometimes it can just become common like I said you know the baby the manger the wise men all this but here we have the prophet of God setting it straight saying this is what happened and and he killed the young children so that he'd be sure to get them anywhere from two years old and back he set the time up because knowing he didn't want to kill too many all of them just because they were more like slaves to him remember I said he was a lunatic he was he wanted to get to be sure to get him so he said the kid would be about 2 years old so everything from 2 years old down kill it see and that's brought to pass what the prophet said in Rama they'll they'll be heard a screaming or crying a weeping that Rachel weeping for her children and they were not they were not comforted and you just can't imagine what that would have been like to have that order and to have policemen if we can imagine it today Calgary City police going door too or even the military an occupied military going door too kicking in doors if you don't open the door if you've got children registered in your home they're kicking the door in and they're going to take your child and they're going to kill it if it's two years or younger any boy just can't imagine that what that would have sounded like right but God's gifts always find their places amen God watches out for his own and we know that they were given the direction to be free they didn't have to succumb come to this but that's just the devil's way just try and do a blanket statement and and hope that it sticks somehow right somehow we can just overcome God's will he'll never be able to overcome God's will he's just a very very good tool in the hand of God that's all satan is he has no power except for what God decides to give him I just think it's beautiful here we'll carry on in this story brother bam says now did you notice that these wise men Great Men was up in Babylon and they saw his star we said we have saw his star in the east and are come to worship him they came from the East where they saw the star going west because India is west north of of Palestine and they come right down by the tig Tigris River and crossed over the plains right on in come down into Bethlehem where they found the baby and remember Joseph and them never left there they went right down to Nazareth and brought the child up right there looking at the story Herod he figured that he could just use the Magi for his own purpose God was actually doing something through these men God had given these men a gift to be able to discern the time and the season a and to go and actually acknowledge that this boy had been born who wasn't just an ordinary boy that it was actually truly Jesus in flesh and we know this story here brothers and sisters when when we talk about this the Catholic church is not ignorant to the fact that this was a child and if you wonder how could that be if you ever take a look at a picture of Mary with her baby the baby isn't just a little tiny freshly born infant many times it's depicted as as like a 2-year-old child and it's such a strange thing the way the Catholic church has it but they know they know full well what the story is but Mary being the mother of the baby she wanted to see the best for him and and just followed the instruction of the Lord I I say as parents just let us follow the instruction of the Lord for us let us follow the word for our day in our lives a as as as mothers and fathers but but this man Herod he was just a lunatic who was so insecure he was just a puppet in the land and and he was afraid that someone was going to come and take his position that was given to him and so he just did the blanket statement just kill them all and and and we'll see what happens in the end and hopefully he'll be able to maintain his position but God he was always a step ahead he wasn't at all interested in seeing that that that go down the way that he wanted it to but uh we know that these these Magi when they came they were they were appointed to come they were given the ability they had a gift to see that light and that was for a purpose because Jesus wasn't an ordinary baby we know we' talked about at the very beginning this was this was God who was given to the Earth this was God's gift to the Earth and we've heard that said many times that people think that they're God's gift and what a a slang term that truly is because there really only is one gift from God and that is it eternal life that we've been given and that is through the life of Jesus Christ but these wise men were given a a a gift to know that there is actually something significant something Supernatural happened and and maybe they found some prophecy maybe someone had prophesied in their in their in their native land and and said that there was going to be the Messiah was coming to Earth and and they knew they had to go and see this can you imagine the desire that must have been in their heart for two years following this light following this sign chasing this star it's called many times by people but when they went they went with a purpose and and their purpose was to bring gifts unto this baby boy and we know the gifts the gifts are are gold frankincense and myrrh and each one of them has a very specific purpose brother Bram in this message now he says now gold in the Bible how fitting it fits to Christ because gold speaks of deity gold is deity we'll get get to it just in a moment frankincense speaks of service and myrr is death God deity and service to die and that's what he was the very thing that they brought identified what they thought he was and I say that to us today the things that we bring to him identifies what our thoughts is about him the things that we bring to him identifies what our thoughts is about him he says you understand what I mean see if you believe it with all your heart every word of that you'll identify it by giving all that you have to it see but if you believe it's a good place to associate with better people around the church and things like that that's just about what you give just a few social hours with some of the congregation or something but if you really believe with all your heart then you give everything that's in you to it see and it identifies you that you truly believe the message that you believe it to be the truth truth I think some of these things can just be spoken and it just happens so quickly and it just goes by and it can you know go proverbially in one ear and out the other ear brothers and sisters don't let these words fall don't let them fall on on Barren ground let them fall into our heart to recognize that our lives represent the degree of belief we have about this message of the houren when we really believe then we give it with all of our heart heart it identifies you that you truly believe the message brother bam says so many people say I can believe this much I can believe so the disciples I believe the last time here I spoke on that Believers make Believers and unbelievers wasn't that it I I didn't speak on it here see and each person watch their category and that's why I say brothers and sisters we have been given the eyes to see but we don't want our own eyes because if we start looking around with our own eyes we're going to say look at that brother the way he's behaving and I'm not in any way encouraging us to start looking around and judging people what I want to do is have us look around and say we can identify things then let's go on our knees and pray for them let's do what Jesus did In The Garden of Gethsemane let's go on our knees and pray for one another and encourage one another and you know if you want to take it a step further the word of God says to confess your faults one to another oh my but that takes a lot of courage that takes a lot of trust because as soon as you do that you make yourself vulnerable you talk about something the devil's working you over on but you know the word of God says that's where power lies when you do that when you confess your faults one to another then you can pray for one another you know where you need to bolster in your brother your sister's life brother brandom says in each person watch their category see it'll come to a place to where they can take so much of it can't take the rest we want to see everyone be able to take it all amen yes so brother bamy talks about these gifts now that the wise men bring that they were appointed to bring there's no accident that they actually came from the East and they had the desire to come and find this baby they had gifts they had a service to do God's Gift always find their place could you imagine that though they didn't have GPS there was no handwritten road maps I can imagine there wasn't maybe there was how did they get around there was something guiding them talking about gold brother bradam says now notice now his works created him or identified him to be the Creator his works that he did crowned his life's testimony we know that what he's talking about Jesus said you know if you can't believe me the words that I speak then believe the actions that you see because they testify of who I am the the the ability to create the ability to raise from the dead the ability to heal who can do that except for God his works that he did crowned his life's testimony that he was the creator no way of getting away from it therefore when they offered the gift of gold they were perfectly at Harmony with god with their gift they gave him gold which identified him as deity I think this is so powerful brothers and sisters many times we can look at the Christmas story and say gold frankincense and myrr and you know it's in his songs and different things but to hear what the prophet of God says about this this was identifying as a gift to the baby child this was identifying deity was born on Earth for the first time ever this was God in Flesh manifested on Earth just tremendous brother Bram he says him as deity always the crown the Golden Crown the golden head the king of Nebuchadnezzar all you see it always deity is represented by gold frankincense now frankincense we want to get these quickly Lankin sense is the offering of service to Jehovah now if you want to put these scriptures down Leviticus 2:2 and Leviticus 166 to 15 we find out that's the order of the priesthood to make an offering to Jehovah when he made the offering it had to be made with and mixed with frankincense for a sin offering and they took different things and mixed it for the meal offering for the wave offering the frankincense was at added because it was acceptable to Jehovah if it was anointed with frankincense which means it is a service to Jehovah God and now we find out he's deity and they brought him frankincense was a type that he was service to Jehovah Jesus is Jehovah's servant no accident that these gifts were brought the way they were brought it wasn't just their custom from the East to bring these three gifts and and give them to them this was very specifically ordained by God for these men to bring these gifts it was identifying who he was now in s St Matthew 12:15 to 21 we find out that he was Jehovah's servant behold my servant in whom I am well pleased and he was and I put my strength upon him so his life was anointed with frankincense to Jehovah's service what what a gift them wise men gave see it was something to give the gift they give was something to identify Jesus as Jehovah's servant amen now if we could only do that yes to identify Our Lives see our lives to be identified as Jehovah's servant it's one reason why I like talking to Jehovah's Witnesses it's the first thing they'll do is introduce themselves and say I'm I'm a Jehovah's Witness and I love to say you are well I am too and they don't know what to say because they say well what what what Association are you and and then you get to get into the discussion right but you know if we're Believers then brothers and sisters we're in Jehovah's service also I don't think personally that there's a greater Jehovah's Witness on the Earth today than someone who has been baptized AP ized by the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and I'm not going to say that that that someone who just believes the message of the hour because I could say it this way and I I'll believe it with all my heart brothers and sisters there could be somebody who is in another sort of group somewhere else that's been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins and you can't tell me for a second that they won't get the Holy Ghost in their life we're talking about God this is the creator he has everything ordained for his way for his purpose and we can try and fit it all into our mental conception into our box something that we can recognize and acknowledge that fits the way we believe and God's going to take it one day and smash that box wide open and say hey you know what I'm God you're the man just follow me and I'll show you I just want to say an example of that you know how could how could that thief on the cross the thief on the cross how could he make it to heaven when he got to Heaven they would say to him you know when were you baptized right how did you get here what church did you go to what were your good works who were your parents how long did you believe about 30 seconds can you believe that the only thing you would have to say is I just talked to a man that said I get to come where he saidj that's all and it's no different for every one of us we just been been told by a man that you you are the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ and with that baptism of the Holy Ghost we become deity living out through us and we get ourselves in service something causes us it constrains us to act and I believe that's why we're all here today something constrained us to be in Jehovah's service cuz this is not Barry's service this is Jehovah's service am brother bam says now if we could only do that to identify Our Lives see our lives to be identified as Jehovah's servant that's what frankincense was for that made him Jehovah's servant and I just want to throw this in there brothers and sisters Romans 12:1 says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service I just love this and be not conformed to this world if we're caught up in this world brothers and sisters forget it forget about it don't be caught up in this world be be be be Heavenly minded be thinking about this rapturing Faith be thinking about all this stuff we still have commitments and lives to live down here but don't allow these things down here to hold us back from actually being able to go on be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may be able to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and that word besee you parm oh it's uh it's the word it says to call near that is to invite invoke by imploration or horation or consolation beseech call for be of good Comfort desire give exhort entreat pray all of those words I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice frankincense mixed with deity frankincense mixed with that Holy Ghost every single day of our lives like Paul said I die out daily so that he might live through me and this world will see it around you brothers and sisters as we close the service let's talk about myrr myrr myrr was the anointing of the death we find in St John the 19th Chapter the 39th verse that going to the funeral service of Jesus when Mary and them went they take in this myrr to anoint him with because he must be the servant of death for Jehovah see am somebody had to die that was a service that had to be done for God and nobody was worthy to do it but God himself so bringing the myrr myrr showing that with the deity and with the service the deity of Jesus Christ being God himself in flesh and the service of his life laying it down that he was also Anointed with myrrh that this deity had to be put to death in order to save the imperfect one oh what a great thing can you believe that the deity had to be put to death in order to save the imperfect one I'm not going to try and interpret that and I don't think that we need to try and interpret that some might want to I just want to say you know what I I know it was the blood of Jesus that actually atoned for my sins and the only blood that could do that would have to be God's own blood that that can't be another man's blood there can be no Vicor to Christ there can be no Vicor to God I just think it's beautiful brothers and sisters and brother bam he says it you know now now look how beautiful these gifts fit into Jesus Christ see gold speaking of his deity now they wasn't heathens they were inspired by God they wasn't imagining something that proves right there even the Magi that they did see the supernatural because their own gift that they offered identified and spoke well of their testimony that they did see the supernatural light traveled for two years put their jobs on hold they must have taken leaves told everyone flipped the sign in the window of their office or their shop and said you know we're going to be back we're seeing you later we don't know when but we're going to go we're going to follow this store and we're going to see what happens and we know two years down the road here they are they finally achieved their goal but brother bradam saying here they weren't just men deciding to go and do something fantastic they were appointed they were anointed of God right that proves right there even the Magi that they did see the supernatural because their own gift that they offered identified and spoke well of their testimony that they did see the supernatural light because why it speaks perfectly they brought gold deity they brought frankincense service and they brought myrrh for his death when he was a baby amen showing that deity would be put to Death In the Flesh amen that it might redeem Fallen men how can people turn that down my how can people turn that down I I I'll call the musicians as we close this portion of the service because we've got the baptismal uh I still have a little bit more I want to say I just want to prove to you that I'm closing I'm not going for the creatures 20 minutes but brother Ram he says when you realize what what are we doing here amen where did we come from or what business have we got being here we wasn't put here just by a chance we were put here for a purpose and we must serve that purpose and I just want want to say brothers and sisters what's your purpose today amen you know when I was young my dad said to me many times he said if I could give you any suggestions or any advice he said this to me while I was young he said find the will of God for your life and I thought what does that mean even how do I find the will of God for my life I can look at it now and say you know perhaps maybe it was to be preacher maybe it was to be a dad maybe it was to have a business maybe it was to do some of the things in my life that I've done but more than anything brothers and sisters I I personally believe more than anything for myself and I trust you're included in that is to find the will of God for your life is to find out that that salvation is yours as well you know I was talking to a young person who sent sent me an email saying that they have a a terrible problem and and they don't know what to do and and they feel like they made a deal with the devil they sold their soul to the devil and you know something came over me I was like what could I ever say to a person like that what could you give for advice and it's it just came to me the the Lord said it to me how could you ever ever do something with with with a soul that's not even your own how how could you ever make a deal with someone over your soul when you don't even own it and I just my goodness isn't that tremendous brothers and sisters what he's done for us he's given us the ability to recognize we never had nothing to do with it we just recognized it one day ain't nobody going to go and make a deal with the devil you can't do that that's a lie of the devil because all life comes from God and he would that all would come unto him where did we come from or what business have we got being here brothers and sisters we wasn't put here just by chance we were put here for a purpose and we must serve that purpose but still we are back on the basis of free moral agency where can we serve it where we can serve it or reject it just like Adam did in the beginning I just want to say today brothers and sisters boy I've got lots more maybe stand with me this morning I just want to say we have the opportunity to actually give our lives in service for the king I want to say that when we come to that knowledge that recognition of truly surrendering Our Lives to God then we too are just like those wise men and I believe brother Bram says it in the message somewhere I don't have it this morning but when we can give our lives understand in if we have the ability to have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives that's truly deity brothers and sisters it's not any less God don't ever think for a second the Holy Ghost is a second or a third person or or another entity it's God himself in flesh once again that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's deity and that causes an action to happen in your life when you truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that action can be many different Avenues of things but there's one thing that's more important than anything and that is to line up with that word the baptism of the Holy Ghost will always always line up with the word of God always and I just want to say you know we read it brother brandham says it that that that that order dedicate ourselves we have a purpose and and find out what that purpose is it all starts with the recognizing that there's actually a gift for us if we're willing to Humble ourselves before the Lord if we're willing to follow the word for our day and get truly baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins what will happen that's the start of the journey brothers and sisters and we can say you know it doesn't get any easier from there our trials are coming anyways we're going to get our trials they're already coming but what a what a Blessed Assurance it is to know that we've got the Holy Ghost In Our Lives as we go through our trials boy oh boy oh boy it's a tremendous thing what a mighty God we serve let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father we know that you have given us free moral agency Lord and we know that you have placed a soul in each one of our Lives Lord Jesus and we know that those souls are your very own and Satan is contending to try and get his hands on them but we know that he can afflict our our bodies he can afflict our minds he can he can affect our emotions he can try and do all that he wants but he can never touch your soul that you have placed within us Lord and father we thank you for your goodness and your mercy to us Lord to know that Lord Jesus you have given us children that you have said to raise them up train them up in
