[9:42] gracious Heavenly Father
[9:45] Lord Jesus we know that there is no
[9:48] greater privilege
[9:50] on Earth than for a man a mortal man to
[9:55] be able to speak directly unto you
[9:58] father
[9:59] to be able to speak directly to you from
[10:02] our heart Lord Jesus from our hearts to
[10:06] Your Heart Lord Jesus
[10:08] father we just pray this morning that
[10:11] you would just be glorified in our
[10:13] little service here Lord
[10:15] there's not one of us that could bring
[10:17] anything unto you father that would be
[10:19] worthy except for you Lord Jesus so Lord
[10:23] Jesus we pray that as we gather together
[10:25] this morning in your name knowing that
[10:29] we come according to your word that you
[10:31] are there wherever two or three are
[10:33] gathered Lord Jesus father I pray that

[10:38] every single one that just sang that
[10:41] song unto you Lord Jesus come by here
[10:43] father we don't want to see you come by
[10:45] Calgary Living Word Assembly Building
[10:47] here on on Beulah Vista Road Lord Jesus
[10:50] we want to see you come into the temple
[10:52] that's created not by hands father
[10:55] wherever we are gathered together Lord
[10:57] Jesus come by here now
[11:00] father we pray that you would just
[11:02] anoint our service this morning that you
[11:03] would just bless us with your presence
[11:05] Lord that you would speak to us
[11:07] sovereignly father as we go forward that
[11:09] we wouldn't try and take one more step
[11:11] in this service Lord God Without You
[11:14] leading us father I pray that I could
[11:16] just step aside Lord Jesus and just
[11:18] allow you the full preeminence that you
[11:21] desire that you would just have your
[11:23] will in your way
[11:24] you would speak to us father that you
[11:26] would bless us that you would take us
[11:28] just a little higher in your word father
[11:30] that you would reveal yourself to us
[11:32] just a little more today father that we
[11:34] would love you just that much more when
[11:37] we leave this building when we turn off
[11:39] our computers when we turn off our
[11:40] televisions when we turn off our phones
[11:42] whatever it is Lord Jesus that there
[11:44] would just be a greater longing for you
[11:47] father or greater realization a greater
[11:50] consciousness of your your life in ours
[11:54] Lord we just love you and we thank you
[11:56] we ask all these things in Jesus
[11:58] Christ's name amen
[12:01] God bless you this morning welcome to
[12:03] the house of the Lord
[12:06] truly an honor and a privilege to be
[12:07] here
[12:09] thank you musicians
[12:11] if you have your Bibles this morning
[12:14] I would like to continue on
[12:16] and the discussion of the Book of John
[12:20] The Gospel according to John St John
[12:23] chapter 1.
[12:27] I just can't get out of it and uh
[12:30] I just believe there's so much there
[12:33] and and to be honest with you
[12:36] the whole entire book we know is
[12:38] inspired but what's really inspiring me
[12:40] is the first 37 verses of this chapter
[12:44] if you want to go ahead and read them
[12:45] I'm sure that you'll probably see the
[12:48] direction that I'm getting out of it but
[12:51] talking John
[12:54] the Apostle is talking about John the
[12:57] Baptist
[12:58] and that's what this is about and today
[13:01] we're just going to talk about John the
[13:02] Baptist and and the John anointings the
[13:05] Elijah anointings and just see what the
[13:09] Lord has in store how they're all tied
[13:10] together it's not a separate thing even
[13:13] though it is a separate thing it's
[13:15] interesting that every single anointing
[13:17] comes exactly according to the word
[13:19] there's no deviation from it and if you
[13:21] really look at it you can see so many
[13:23] parallels uh it's just
[13:26] undeniable when you believe the word of
[13:29] God to be the infallible truth
[13:32] it's wonderful
[13:34] let's just start reading with verse 1.
[13:38] Gospel according to John chapter 1.
[13:41] in the beginning was the word and the
[13:43] Word was with God and the Word was God
[13:47] and the same was in the beginning with
[13:48] God
[13:49] all things were made by him and without
[13:52] him was not anything made that was made
[13:55] in him was life and the life
[13:59] was the light of men
[14:02] and the light shineth in darkness and
[14:05] the Darkness
[14:06] comprehended it not
[14:09] there was a man sent from God whose name
[14:11] was John
[14:13] the same came for a witness to Bear
[14:15] witness of the light
[14:18] that all men through him
[14:20] might believe
[14:22] he was not that light
[14:24] but was sent to Bear Witness
[14:27] of that light
[14:29] that was the True Light
[14:31] which lighteth every man that cometh
[14:34] into the world
[14:36] he was in the world and the world was
[14:38] made by him and the world knew him not
[14:41] he came unto his own and his own
[14:44] received him not
[14:45] but as many as received him
[14:48] to them gave he power to become the sons
[14:53] of God
[14:54] even to them that believe on his name
[14:58] which were born not of blood
[15:00] nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will
[15:04] of man
[15:05] but of God
[15:07] they were born again
[15:10] let's just bow in prayer
[15:14] gracious Heavenly Father we have
[15:16] ridden this
[15:18] red sorry this sacred text and father we
[15:22] pray that you would just speak to us out
[15:24] of it Lord that you would just break it
[15:26] open to us once again
[15:28] Lord that we could just be seated
[15:30] together in Heavenly places Lord we know
[15:32] that we are but father that we could see
[15:34] that we are Lord Jesus that father you
[15:38] would just open our eyes of
[15:39] understanding today that we would just
[15:41] be able to come a little higher in you
[15:45] open this word to us we pray in Jesus
[15:48] Christ's name amen
[15:51] God bless you this morning you may be
[15:52] seated
[15:56] we have
[15:59] couple of announcements
[16:02] we just wanted to make sure that
[16:04] everyone's aware I sent an email and a
[16:07] text and I announced it before and I'll
[16:10] say it again we'll probably continue to
[16:12] say it just so everybody's on the same
[16:13] page we have canceled the services and
[16:15] Left Bridge
[16:16] due to the new covet restrictions the
[16:19] amount of people that takes to actually
[16:21] make the service happen on an ongoing
[16:24] basis it just isn't feasible to be able
[16:27] to provide an opportunity for the folks
[16:29] in Lethbridge to come and fellowship as
[16:31] well it would just turn into a service
[16:33] of uh us going to Lethbridge and having
[16:36] Church which probably isn't all a bad
[16:39] thing but uh just for the sake of the
[16:41] folks in Lethbridge we wouldn't want to
[16:43] go down there and then tell them they
[16:45] can't come
[16:46] that would just be not nice so until uh
[16:50] June more further notice we will
[16:53] definitely be postponing the services
[16:56] um
[16:57] I just want to say this I've
[16:59] fellowshipped a little bit recently with
[17:01] some folks around and
[17:03] I'm certainly thankful
[17:05] for the position that we've taken I know
[17:07] that I've struggled with it it's been
[17:09] very difficult
[17:11] because some people even around the
[17:13] message have decided to just go forwards
[17:16] and have church and continue on and just
[17:19] do
[17:20] whatsoever they feel and some have said
[17:24] that it's an infringement in their in
[17:26] their Christian rights and uh
[17:29] I'm not here to dispute it one second
[17:31] with anyone what your stand is on the
[17:34] word is between you and God that's not
[17:36] mine I'm not here to dispute that for a
[17:38] second but one thing I am thankful for
[17:42] I'm not proud of I'm thankful for is
[17:45] that in this church we have not had a
[17:48] ravaging of this disease of this virus
[17:51] it has been stable
[17:53] we have had a few people infected it has
[17:55] been managed and it has not been spread
[17:59] through the church
[18:01] and what a tremendous blessing that is
[18:03] we'll give all the glory to God
[18:06] just talking to other people there's
[18:08] there's been some people really affected
[18:10] by covet and it's actually
[18:13] uh almost saddening to see that people
[18:16] have put themselves in the line of fire
[18:18] that way and uh like I said I'm not here
[18:20] to to judge anyone we all have to live
[18:23] according to the Revelation that God
[18:24] gives us if he says you know drink
[18:26] something poisonous and you have that
[18:29] Revelation then you should do it and and
[18:31] he'll protect you right
[18:34] Mark 16 in action
[18:36] but uh
[18:38] we also know the story
[18:40] I'll just tell this little story here uh
[18:42] about the person who was enduring a
[18:45] hurricane
[18:46] and and and they went through the
[18:48] hurricane and they died and they went to
[18:50] heaven
[18:51] and and and they they drowned in this
[18:54] hurricane as the waters came up over top
[18:56] of their house and and and and they said
[18:59] to God well you know why why didn't you
[19:02] save me
[19:04] and I'm probably getting the story wrong
[19:05] I'll just do my version of it this
[19:07] morning but
[19:08] and God said to the man he said well you
[19:11] know I did send help your way
[19:13] and he said when I never saw any angels
[19:15] I never saw anything spectacular and he
[19:17] said well when I sent that man to knock
[19:19] on your door and tell you there's a
[19:21] hurricane coming flee leave your house
[19:24] you're going to die if you stay it's a
[19:27] bad one
[19:28] and you didn't stay you didn't listen
[19:32] and then you had a helicopter come
[19:35] and shine his light on you when you were
[19:37] on top of the roof of your house
[19:39] to get on the helicopter and you said no
[19:41] God's Gonna Save Me I don't have to get
[19:43] on a helicopter I'm not looking for a
[19:45] man to save me I want God to save me
[19:50] and he said to the man
[19:51] that helicopter was from me as well but
[19:54] you refused it
[19:56] brothers and sisters God uses men
[20:00] he uses doctors and he uses medicine
[20:05] and I think it's very important for us
[20:07] to not get caught up in in in all of the
[20:10] different mindsets in this world I think
[20:12] maybe it's it's worthwhile to take one
[20:15] step backwards and just say what has
[20:18] happened in the past
[20:20] in the past there's been illnesses
[20:24] and God has actually allowed
[20:27] the cure to be given to man so that man
[20:30] could administer it to man to save men
[20:37] I just want to say could it be all of
[20:39] the connection
[20:41] to social media and the connection to
[20:43] news media and the connection to all of
[20:46] the different people out there and all
[20:47] of the videos and all of the ideas and
[20:50] theories
[20:51] has put doubt in our minds
[20:55] I would say be very careful what we
[20:57] watch
[20:59] we have to be very careful what we watch
[21:01] I heard them something astounding this
[21:03] morning for me it was astounding for me
[21:05] but we know that in the Garden of Eden
[21:07] that Satan he injected himself into
[21:10] Mankind through the serpent we know that
[21:12] right
[21:13] that's not up for debate or discussion
[21:16] but you know this is Satan's Eden and
[21:19] and really what I heard today that was
[21:20] astounding for me is that Satan is doing
[21:23] that again to Mankind and how is he
[21:25] doing that brothers and sisters what's
[21:27] the gateway to the soul
[21:29] the gateway to the soul is the eyes what
[21:33] we see remember that lot he vexed his
[21:36] righteous Soul daily with the things
[21:38] that he saw and the things that he heard
[21:41] the things that he took into his body
[21:43] through the eye gate and through the
[21:45] ears we need to be very careful that
[21:48] we're not listening to things that are
[21:49] contrary to the word for our day
[21:53] the mark of the beast is not a vaccine
[21:56] if somebody believes that I want to say
[21:59] it right now loud and clear that is an
[22:01] antichrist spirit because the prophet
[22:03] for our day said that it's actually
[22:06] refusing to accept the Holy Ghost that's
[22:09] the mark of the beast
[22:12] is powerful it's strong
[22:14] it's a clothesline religion
[22:17] don't get caught up in what man wants to
[22:19] say and think and do follow the prophet
[22:23] follow the one who has given us the
[22:26] ability to be saved in our day
[22:29] don't try and make our own version of it
[22:31] don't say I I believe the prophet said
[22:33] it this way but we can do it that way
[22:35] that won't save you
[22:37] God will say to you that day why didn't
[22:39] you accept my provided way
[22:42] it might not have been the way that you
[22:44] wanted it to be but it was the way that
[22:46] I provided for you
[22:48] we don't want to get sidetracked
[22:52] I want to say happy Mother's Day to all
[22:54] the mothers
[22:56] it takes a real special person to be a
[22:59] mother
[22:59] in this world
[23:02] a real special person to be a mother
[23:05] and you know I'll say this
[23:09] we we take the opportunity to say thank
[23:12] you to our mothers on on one day of the
[23:14] year it's acknowledged but children
[23:17] acknowledge your mother's every day amen
[23:21] acknowledge your mother's every chance
[23:23] you get
[23:25] mothers are human beings and sometimes
[23:28] they make mistakes too
[23:30] just like the rest of us
[23:32] some might argue that
[23:35] my wife's gonna
[23:37] have a discussion with me afterwards
[23:40] but it's true
[23:42] sometimes people make mistakes and it
[23:44] doesn't mean anything
[23:46] a mother's love for their children can't
[23:49] be broken
[23:51] God bless you mothers today
[23:54] certainly thankful for every single one
[23:56] of you
[24:01] what a special opportunity
[24:03] it is as a child to say to your mom
[24:06] thank you for loving me
[24:09] because if we have a mother that loves
[24:11] us it is just
[24:13] amazing it is absolutely amazing to see
[24:18] a mother's love
[24:20] God bless you moms
[24:22] today I just want to talk a little bit
[24:25] of John the Baptist
[24:28] and uh just sort of see a comparison
[24:30] between John the Baptist and William
[24:33] Miriam Branham and sort of the
[24:35] scriptural identity of William Mary and
[24:37] Branham in the scripture alongside of
[24:40] John the Baptist we know that they're
[24:42] Elijah anointings and uh there's five of
[24:46] them that come into the world
[24:48] five Elijah anointings there's Elijah
[24:51] Elisha John the Baptist
[24:53] brother Branham
[24:56] and then Elijah again as one of the two
[24:58] witnesses Elijah and Moses
[25:02] back to Israel once again
[25:05] but uh
[25:08] today we just want to talk about
[25:11] Elijah in our day
[25:13] so you know a lot of the inspiration I'm
[25:15] going to talk about today is out of the
[25:16] the message birth birth pains in 1965
[25:19] but the Branham talks about how the
[25:21] world is going through cycles and it's
[25:23] going through birth pains and you know
[25:25] one of the first things when a mother is
[25:28] actually due
[25:29] when she's pregnant and and it's time
[25:31] for her her delivery of the child and
[25:34] and she feels like it's time to go to
[25:35] the hospital brother Branham spells this
[25:38] out really good in this message and he
[25:39] says one of the very first things that a
[25:41] doctor will do when when a mom comes to
[25:43] the hospital and says it's time they'll
[25:46] say okay is it time and and what they'll
[25:48] do is begin to measure the contractions
[25:51] and anyone who has had children
[25:52] understands that that is sort of the
[25:55] Keystone to it there's a thing called
[25:57] Braxton Hicks and it's false alarm but
[26:00] it's still the body reacting sometimes
[26:03] it will actually start to contract early
[26:05] and that's what they call it but then
[26:07] there's a time where it's real and and
[26:09] the body has contractions and when when
[26:11] it's time to deliver the baby the
[26:13] contractions get closer and closer and
[26:15] closer together and and what it is it's
[26:17] the the stomach muscles everything in
[26:19] the core of the woman's body is
[26:21] squishing together because it's time to
[26:23] actually deliver the child
[26:25] and brother Bradham says the first thing
[26:27] the doctor does is measure measure the
[26:30] time the space of time between the
[26:32] contractions and then he begins to
[26:34] relate it to the World the natural world
[26:37] in which we live in and and and the
[26:39] different contractions that have
[26:40] happened and he talks about the world
[26:42] wars and and World War one and how that
[26:44] was one major contraction and and to
[26:47] look at it and see that the whole entire
[26:49] world contracted there and and we know
[26:52] that the world is is going to give birth
[26:55] we're talking about the world actually
[26:57] going forward to give birth to deliver
[27:00] the children
[27:01] of the of the most high the Sons and
[27:04] Daughters of God all creation is
[27:06] groaning for the manifestation of the
[27:07] sons of God
[27:09] and here we are
[27:11] but brother Branham says that world war
[27:13] one was one of the first contractions
[27:15] really big contractions World War II was
[27:18] another one of those contractions and
[27:20] and he goes on to say that you know the
[27:22] world really can't stand any more
[27:24] contractions because the next step is a
[27:26] nuclear step and if that happens it's
[27:28] like a room full of mouse traps you set
[27:31] one off and it'll just be a chain
[27:32] reaction all over the place and then you
[27:34] know the world is off its kilter and
[27:37] completely burned by fire and we know
[27:39] that the the word prophesies that there
[27:41] will be a day where the elements melt
[27:43] with a fervent heat and you know brother
[27:46] Branham talks about how mankind is going
[27:49] to destroy itself it's not going to be
[27:51] God that destroys Mankind and I think
[27:54] that's a common sort of uh misconception
[27:57] that's put out there is that God is
[27:59] putting judgment on the world and
[28:01] although he is putting judgment on the
[28:03] world he's not taking a nuclear bomb and
[28:06] dropping it on the Earth
[28:08] it's man that does that
[28:11] man breaking into
[28:15] breaking into the laboratory of God
[28:18] learning how to split atoms where did
[28:20] that come from
[28:21] how could that possibly be
[28:24] it's a direct line back to the tree of
[28:26] knowledge of Good and Evil the ability
[28:28] to learn things that man really doesn't
[28:30] need to know man there's no need for man
[28:32] to split atoms
[28:35] maybe I guess if we were to look at it
[28:37] in a carnal sense some people might
[28:39] argue and say well we need to be able to
[28:40] to split water to create hydrogen so
[28:43] that we can have a clean burning fuel so
[28:46] that we can stop the fossil fuels but
[28:49] what good is that going to be for us in
[28:52] our lives we're not looking for a a
[28:55] lengthening of days and a and an
[28:57] enduring ability to stay here on Earth
[29:00] we're looking for the Rapture of the
[29:01] church when brother Bradham was here he
[29:03] preached I believe it was an invisible
[29:05] Union at the very beginning of that
[29:07] message he said I'm not looking for a
[29:10] Revival in this generation because we
[29:12] know he said it very clearly in 1956
[29:14] 1957 that was the call to actually
[29:17] repent and if they chose not to repent
[29:19] in the USA that was it the he he
[29:22] indicted them for the second crucifixion
[29:25] of the Lord Jesus Christ the prophet of
[29:27] God can you imagine that the prophet of
[29:30] God indicting this generation for the
[29:33] second crucifixion of of the Lord Jesus
[29:36] Christ
[29:37] and we know that it's not a physical
[29:38] thing but it's a spiritual thing and
[29:40] that's the age that we live in and
[29:42] that's why it's so deceptive for Satan
[29:44] so deceptive for us not for Satan but he
[29:47] just he just floats around under the
[29:49] surface through everything and and it's
[29:51] just his Eden and if we're not careful
[29:53] if we're not Discerning by the word we
[29:55] will get Swept Away by his ideologies
[29:57] and it doesn't matter what it is that's
[29:59] why brothers and sisters I've said it in
[30:01] the past if we don't go on to the true
[30:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost in our own
[30:05] lives if we don't get that token as
[30:07] brother brother Peter prayed if we don't
[30:10] get that token in our lives in our homes
[30:12] then something will sweep us away
[30:16] there are so many movements out there
[30:17] now
[30:18] so many different cultures and and
[30:21] ideologies and and things that people
[30:24] can just get mixed up in and you know
[30:25] what they are brothers and sisters
[30:27] they're demons they're demon Spirits
[30:29] it's going walking around like a roaring
[30:31] lion seeking whom they may devour and if
[30:34] we don't have the Holy Ghost In Our
[30:35] Lives we're going to get caught up in
[30:36] one of them something's going to grab us
[30:38] and we're just going to jump on board
[30:39] with it why because the human body the
[30:43] human being has been created to worship
[30:45] it's been created to be the Tabernacle
[30:47] of the most high God that's why when we
[30:49] sing that song come by here my Lord what
[30:51] are we saying we're not saying come by
[30:53] here to this church building don't come
[30:55] by here to this house that we're
[30:56] gathered in don't come by here to this
[30:58] car come by here to this heart to this
[31:00] Soul anoint my soul with thy blood give
[31:04] it give me the holy spirit it's got to
[31:06] be that way it's got to be personal
[31:07] brother Paul said that make it personal
[31:09] today that's what it has to be if it's
[31:11] not that personal then we're missing the
[31:13] point
[31:14] we're missing the point entirely we
[31:16] don't want to just come to a service and
[31:18] have a have a holy ghost anointing on my
[31:20] spirit and have a holy ghost anointing
[31:22] on my flesh and and maybe see a good
[31:24] Financial blessing in my bank account
[31:26] and and see that God provides all of my
[31:29] garments I've got great clothes and a
[31:31] great house and a great car and
[31:33] everything in my life is great but what
[31:35] great is it if you don't have the Holy
[31:37] Ghost if the token isn't applied in your
[31:39] life
[31:41] brother Branham says that causes a
[31:43] reaction in our lives we become new
[31:45] creatures in Christ Jesus but it can
[31:48] become very easy brothers and sisters to
[31:51] make a traditional ideology out of the
[31:54] message of the hour out of the Gospel
[31:57] don't do it don't get caught up in that
[31:59] Satan wants that Satan wants us to feel
[32:02] like we're saved
[32:03] it's not about feelings brothers and
[32:05] sisters and don't go the other way
[32:07] either and and have Satan make us feel
[32:09] like we're not saved because really
[32:12] Satan's got nothing to do with it
[32:14] our feelings are irrelevant
[32:16] if we've met the requirements then God
[32:19] is obligated to his word brothers and
[32:22] sisters
[32:23] all we have to do is meet the
[32:24] requirements and when Satan comes
[32:26] buzzing around to try and tell us oh
[32:28] look what you did or didn't do look at
[32:29] what you thought or didn't think you you
[32:32] you should have or you shouldn't have
[32:33] all of the garbage that Satan tries to
[32:35] lie to us about you know how we know if
[32:37] it's Satan if if if he just opens his
[32:40] mouth and we hear this lie anything
[32:42] that's contrary to the word brothers and
[32:44] sisters is Satan talking to us trying to
[32:46] mix us up and get us confused remember
[32:48] God is not the author of confusion he
[32:51] has not come to confuse us he has come
[32:53] to deliver us to give us the pure Word
[32:56] of Deliverance in our day
[32:58] and that is through the message of the
[33:00] hour I'm just going off here a bit and
[33:04] uh I guess it's just the inspiration and
[33:06] you know what I would say it's the pull
[33:07] the people
[33:09] activating this pulling it out of me
[33:11] this is wild
[33:13] you know out of birth pains in 1965 I'll
[33:15] just start here brother Branham says
[33:17] this and this is just notable this is
[33:20] the message encapsiled
[33:23] the message encapsled to the True
[33:25] Believers it's just beautiful I love
[33:27] this
[33:28] because remember I'll just explain it
[33:31] I'll give a little uh preface to it
[33:33] sorry I'm making it confusing but I just
[33:36] get excited about it this is Brother
[33:38] Branham uh just about to actually preach
[33:41] and someone actually actually I think he
[33:44] did preach sorry but he gives a a
[33:46] speaking in tongues there's a there's a
[33:48] tongues speaking in tongues and there's
[33:50] an interpretation in tongues and there's
[33:51] actually three Witnesses for the
[33:54] speaking in tongues and and this is what
[33:55] the interpretation of it is here he says
[33:57] because thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[34:00] the harder way
[34:01] thou Hast walked of your own choosing
[34:05] your own choosing thou has picked the
[34:08] correct and precise decision
[34:11] and it is my way
[34:13] because of this momentous decision a
[34:16] huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what
[34:19] a glorious decision thou has made
[34:21] this in itself is that which will give
[34:25] and make come to pass
[34:28] their tremendous victory in love divine
[34:32] I love how he says it here their victory
[34:35] in love divine not the victory in love
[34:38] divine and and he says like in French
[34:40] here it's the verb before the adverb and
[34:43] I'm not a gram a scholar with grammar
[34:46] I'm not going to pretend that but what I
[34:48] am going to say is that in the other
[34:50] interpretations that you pull out of the
[34:52] message of the hour he says the
[34:55] here he says there this in itself is
[34:59] that which will give and make to come
[35:00] path to pass there t-h-e-i-r
[35:06] victory
[35:08] their tremendous victory in love divine
[35:11] brothers and sisters I'm reading that
[35:13] because I believe he's speaking about a
[35:15] group of people
[35:16] I don't believe that that was just
[35:18] something for the prophet just to say
[35:20] God is just anointing his prophet and
[35:23] it's just for his man he who receives a
[35:25] prophet receives the prophet in the name
[35:28] of a prophet receives the prophet's
[35:30] reward right
[35:31] so brothers and sisters I believe we can
[35:33] take that and apply it to our own lives
[35:35] it's of your own choosing if you decide
[35:37] to accept the message of the hour and
[35:39] say maybe God God I I I don't understand
[35:42] it at all
[35:43] it sounds like fanaticism
[35:46] but I'm gonna take you at your word and
[35:48] say if if you be God then be God reveal
[35:52] yourself to me according to the way that
[35:54] these fanatical people are talking about
[35:57] that God speaks to people through a
[35:59] prophet remember the word always comes
[36:02] to a prophet that's scriptural
[36:05] that is a scriptural thing
[36:07] John the Baptist
[36:09] is the representation in Malachi 3
[36:12] there's some people that would say that
[36:14] that well Malachi 4 was the
[36:16] representation of John the Baptist and
[36:17] that's not true that's not true at all
[36:19] according to what brother Branham said
[36:21] if we could turn over to Malachi we can
[36:23] just read that quickly here
[36:26] for a second Malachi chapter 3 verse 1.
[36:35] it's amazing how God will take and use a
[36:39] man and just reveal the word through him
[36:42] and I'm speaking about brother Branham
[36:44] here
[36:45] how he would just show us things show
[36:48] his children things that the whole world
[36:51] has no idea about is is caught up in a
[36:54] theological traditional teaching kind of
[36:57] thing
[37:01] I believe there's so much in here we we
[37:03] might wind up taking a little bit of
[37:05] time studying this here but in Malachi
[37:07] chapter 3 verse 1 behold I will send my
[37:11] messenger
[37:12] and he shall prepare the way before me
[37:16] and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly
[37:19] come to his Temple even the messenger of
[37:22] the Covenant
[37:23] whom ye Delight in
[37:25] behold he shall come saith the Lord of
[37:29] hosts
[37:30] Malachi 3 brother Branham talks about
[37:33] this in the message
[37:35] birth pains
[37:36] there's a Malachi 3 messenger and
[37:39] there's a Malachi 4 messenger and
[37:41] they're two separate Messengers both
[37:44] representing the very same thing
[37:47] very important to understand let's just
[37:50] flip the page and turn over to Malachi
[37:52] 4.
[37:55] Malachi 4 verse 1. we'll just read the
[37:58] whole chapter because it's only six
[37:59] verses for behold the day cometh that
[38:02] shall burn as an oven and all the proud
[38:05] yea and all that do wickedly shall be
[38:07] stubble
[38:09] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[38:11] up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall
[38:14] leave them neither root nor branch
[38:17] I just I just love this next part
[38:20] because the first part sounds so
[38:22] frightening it sounds so alarming to
[38:24] think that there's going to be no place
[38:26] to hide on that day and there won't be
[38:29] but verse 2 but unto you that fear my
[38:33] name I think we could just stop right
[38:35] there and have like a little Revival in
[38:38] our lives in our service here but unto
[38:41] you that fear my name shall the son of
[38:44] righteousness arise with healing in his
[38:46] wings and ye shall go forth and grow up
[38:49] as calves of the stall and ye shall
[38:51] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[38:53] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[38:56] the day that I shall do this saith the
[38:58] Lord of hosts
[39:00] brothers and sisters there's so much
[39:02] there in in verse 2 and verse 3. I just
[39:05] believe that it behooves us if we
[39:08] believe that God sent a prophet if we
[39:10] believe that we have received the true
[39:12] token the true
[39:14] absolute
[39:16] the message of the hour Christ
[39:19] the Holy Ghost In Our Lives then you
[39:22] know what brothers and sisters I would
[39:24] say this go forwards in your lives and
[39:26] say that ye shall tread down the wicked
[39:29] for they shall be ashes Under The Souls
[39:32] of your feet in the day that I shall do
[39:35] this saith the Lord of hosts we know
[39:38] that the Rapture is a cycle it's not
[39:41] just an event and that's where a lot of
[39:43] the theological studies the traditional
[39:46] denominational teachings they make it
[39:48] just one event and that's it
[39:50] we had a prophet of God say no no no no
[39:53] it's an it's a it's it's a cycle it
[39:56] started a long time ago where did it
[39:58] start brothers and sisters way back
[39:59] before the foundation of the world
[40:02] when God created the very first
[40:04] sacrifice for Adam and Eve when Eve
[40:06] decided to eat of the fruit of the tree
[40:09] we know it wasn't that it was an act
[40:12] it was way back there
[40:14] all the way down through all of the
[40:16] scripture we could see the Rapture
[40:18] happening
[40:20] but you know where did it start
[40:22] I don't know I I don't know where it
[40:24] started in our day I would say with
[40:27] William Marion Branham
[40:30] there's so many examples in the Bible I
[40:32] think it can be easy to just say that
[40:34] it's well it's an event and it's just
[40:36] the same thing as saying that the
[40:37] Pentecostals are are a denomination
[40:39] brother Branham says that's putting a
[40:41] period behind it and that's not right it
[40:43] won't work that's where God says Ichabod
[40:45] and leaves he doesn't have anything to
[40:48] do with it anymore
[40:49] because you put a period you try and put
[40:51] God in a box it doesn't work that way
[40:52] brother Bradham said that Pentecost is
[40:55] an experience and it's very much a part
[40:58] of a message believer's life that's why
[41:00] to just be like a dried up old stick
[41:03] when you hear the word of God preached
[41:05] and to not have it move you and change
[41:07] you and and and and form you and and
[41:09] encourage you there's something wrong
[41:12] brothers and sisters brother Branham
[41:14] says it that religion without emotion is
[41:16] dead
[41:17] there should be something in us that
[41:19] cries out amen when we hear the word of
[41:21] God
[41:25] but sometimes we'll struggle at the Veil
[41:29] sometimes we'll struggle at the veil and
[41:30] brothers and sisters it's so important
[41:32] to not do that because God chooses his
[41:34] own way
[41:36] we we can't pick his own way he chooses
[41:40] his own way
[41:41] but you know just going back to our
[41:44] scripture here in in verse 3 verse 2
[41:46] even but unto you that fear my name
[41:51] shall the son of righteousness arise
[41:53] with healing in his wings
[41:56] and ye shall go forth and grow up as
[41:58] calves of the star I talked about this
[41:59] before and I'll just say it again that
[42:01] if you wonder if God has his hand in
[42:04] your life
[42:05] if he didn't have his hand in your life
[42:08] you'd be just like a bug on a windshield
[42:10] of a car to Satan
[42:13] if Satan could have his opportunity to
[42:15] steal your soul and take you to hell he
[42:18] would do that that quickly don't doubt
[42:21] that brothers and sisters if we are able
[42:24] to live our lives and have a little bit
[42:26] of success in our lives and be able to
[42:29] go to work and and go home one of the
[42:32] things that's just struck me so hard
[42:33] recently is the ability to just sit down
[42:36] with my family at dinner time at supper
[42:38] time and just have supper and hold
[42:41] everyone's hand and say thank you Lord
[42:43] for bringing us home safely again
[42:45] together so that we can be together as a
[42:48] family so that my boys can have their
[42:51] daddy and their mommy everyone together
[42:54] one of our most important times I think
[42:56] and there was a time where it wasn't
[42:58] like that
[43:00] you know why
[43:01] because it wasn't a revelation to me
[43:04] it wasn't important to me
[43:07] making money was important to me
[43:10] but you know what happens when we start
[43:12] to actually get the ABCs correct in our
[43:14] lives
[43:15] God pours out a blessing on our house
[43:17] that we can't even contain
[43:20] it's got nothing to do with tithing it's
[43:22] got everything to do with our heart
[43:25] absolutely everything to do with our
[43:27] heart
[43:28] what do we do with our time how much how
[43:31] many hours do we have in a day
[43:34] do we give them 10 percent of our time
[43:37] it's fine to give them 10 percent of our
[43:39] money and maybe a little bit if we feel
[43:41] led
[43:43] but what do we do with our time brothers
[43:45] and sisters
[43:47] 10 percent of the first fruits that we
[43:49] have if we have breath in our lungs
[43:50] that's a fruit that's something he's
[43:52] given us
[43:53] we need to give unto him
[43:55] all that we have not part of it but you
[43:58] know when we do that in our lives He
[44:00] blesses us in ways that maybe we didn't
[44:02] even realize
[44:04] it's amazing to how he looks after us
[44:07] but if we look at these scriptures here
[44:09] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[44:11] son of righteousness arise with healing
[44:13] in his wings he'll he'll arise and and
[44:16] heal our souls he'll arise in our lives
[44:19] the day star arises in our lives in such
[44:22] a way that people say who are you and
[44:24] what have you done with with with my
[44:26] brother or my sister who what what's
[44:28] going on you know what that is that's
[44:30] him rising in our lives and our souls
[44:33] with healing in our wings taking us back
[44:35] to the original word that was that was
[44:37] delivered unto us
[44:39] by our fathers
[44:41] but we've been given the ability to go
[44:44] forth
[44:45] and grow up as calves of the stall
[44:47] totally protected
[44:49] totally looked after
[44:51] Satan can't harm us
[44:53] and you know what we when we look at our
[44:55] lives and we'll say Satan can't harm us
[44:57] sometimes God will allow something to
[45:00] come our way and why
[45:03] so that he can prove us he can prove his
[45:05] child he can prove his seed through the
[45:08] situation in our lives if God allows
[45:10] something to come our way it's not so he
[45:12] can destroy us it's not so that the
[45:15] Devourer can destroy us because his word
[45:17] says that I'll rebuke the Devourer go
[45:20] ahead and try me see if it won't work
[45:23] see if I'm not true to my word for you
[45:27] gives us the ability to grow up as
[45:29] calves of the stall that's why I I don't
[45:32] know I just think about it so often you
[45:34] know any success that we have in our
[45:35] lives I mean any success that we have in
[45:38] our lives is not because of us it's
[45:41] because of God Almighty it's because he
[45:44] has created a stall that if we fear his
[45:46] name that he will allow us to grow up
[45:49] and and and and let us grow up as a calf
[45:51] in a stall where there's no wolves
[45:53] there's no no enemies there's no
[45:55] problems there's no things that are
[45:56] going to have their way in our lives
[45:58] unless he first allows it and if he
[46:01] allows it it's for our Perfection but
[46:03] it's amazing to look at it and think
[46:05] down that you know we can actually tread
[46:09] down the wicked
[46:11] in this cycle of the rapture this is
[46:14] what I wanted to get to here with this
[46:15] this couple of verses here you know
[46:17] brothers and sisters don't think that
[46:19] that's out there somewhere in the future
[46:21] it's it's potentially right now today as
[46:23] we go forwards you know what the
[46:25] Serpent's head has been bruised and the
[46:28] man's heel has been bruised those two
[46:30] scriptures have been fulfilled but
[46:32] there's another one here that someone
[46:33] has to go forward and tread down the
[46:35] wicked
[46:37] we can go forwards and know that Satan
[46:40] can't touch us and you know what if
[46:42] Satan touches us it's because God
[46:44] allowed it and when that happens we can
[46:47] say blessed be the name of the Lord
[46:48] because I know you're trying to work
[46:50] something out of my life here and when I
[46:52] come out the other side not if I come
[46:54] out the other side when I come out the
[46:55] other side it's going to be glorious
[46:57] because you're working out your will in
[46:59] my life
[47:00] not complain and say oh Lord lament cry
[47:05] sackcloth and Ash OH I'm down on the
[47:08] dumps with the wicked is just encamped
[47:11] about me
[47:12] no
[47:14] no no no we've been given way more than
[47:16] that we've been given the complete open
[47:18] Word
[47:19] in our day we've been called unto
[47:22] adoption
[47:24] and given full Authority and Power
[47:27] and the only thing we have to do is
[47:29] believe it
[47:30] how do we believe it brothers and
[47:32] sisters
[47:33] here's here's brother Barry's key for
[47:35] the day how do we believe it brothers
[47:37] and sisters
[47:39] speak
[47:42] it
[47:43] you know the the the the work world and
[47:46] and all of the self-help world all of
[47:49] that world in this world the tree of
[47:51] knowledge of Good and Evil is totally
[47:54] tapping into that the spoken word the
[47:56] power of the spoken word when we speak
[48:00] God speaks if you have the Holy Ghost in
[48:02] your life brothers and sisters which you
[48:04] do I believe it
[48:07] when you speak God speaks that's what
[48:09] the prophet taught I'm not going to
[48:11] bring a quote for that I'm going to say
[48:12] look it up
[48:14] get out the message app and look it up
[48:16] the prophet says that
[48:18] when two omnipotents meet
[48:21] look out
[48:23] the sea Gene of God and his Spirit Come
[48:26] Together
[48:27] it's omnipotence brothers and sisters
[48:30] when we speak he speaks
[48:33] that's why brother Branham brought that
[48:36] message why Christ speak
[48:38] Moses you've been given that staff in
[48:41] your hand and you've been shown what
[48:43] will happen if you throw it down you've
[48:45] been shown what will happen if you wave
[48:46] it over top of the river you've been
[48:49] shown what will happen if you point it
[48:50] to the North you've been shown what will
[48:52] happen if you point it to the east
[48:54] you've been shown what will happen over
[48:56] and over and over again and here you are
[48:59] at the Red Sea With the Enemy coming up
[49:01] behind you and you've got nowhere to go
[49:03] don't cry speak the word
[49:07] and as soon as he did that what happened
[49:10] we know what happened
[49:12] Pillar of Fire came down
[49:14] and actually blinded the enemy
[49:17] and kept them nice and warm at night
[49:20] the same thing that destroyed the enemy
[49:22] kept them safe
[49:25] kept them as a calf of the stall
[49:29] but God didn't come down and say now I'm
[49:31] I'm going to step forwards and I'm going
[49:34] to part the waters he said no why cry
[49:36] speak the word and go forwards enough
[49:39] already let's move on from the
[49:41] principles of the doctrines of Christ of
[49:43] laying on of hands and water baptism
[49:45] let's move into Perfection let's come to
[49:47] the place where we recognize that we're
[49:49] fully mature Sons and Daughters of God
[49:52] by the message of the hour that we've
[49:54] been delivered brothers and sisters when
[49:56] we speak God speaks
[49:59] if we have the Holy Ghost In Our Lives
[50:00] when you speak the word you're speaking
[50:03] for God
[50:04] he's not coming down to speak the word
[50:06] he's using you to speak the word he's
[50:08] using me to speak the word when we speak
[50:10] the word it's God speaking the word
[50:13] that's why we have to be so careful to
[50:15] not allow Satan to speak the word
[50:16] through us because either God's going to
[50:19] speak the word through us or Satan's
[50:20] going to speak the word through us and
[50:22] we know that Peter encountered that and
[50:24] there was a very very graphic
[50:25] description of it
[50:27] Jesus was explained to the disciples I
[50:29] have to be delivered up to be to be to
[50:31] be crucified so that I could save the
[50:34] the people of this world that I could be
[50:36] the the atonement for all of the sin of
[50:38] the world
[50:39] and Peter the fervent one the the action
[50:41] man stood up and said no not so not on
[50:44] my watch Lord I'll pull out my sword and
[50:47] I'll protect you you'll never be killed
[50:49] as long as I'm around and what did Jesus
[50:51] say he stood up and he said to him get
[50:53] thee behind me Satan not Peter Satan
[50:57] remember
[50:59] he was the one that was chosen the
[51:02] chosen one that he would build his
[51:04] church upon and we know the
[51:05] denominational world has taken that
[51:06] round with it and that's not what I'm
[51:08] saying he didn't build his church upon
[51:09] Peter a man so unstable that he would
[51:11] curse the Lord three times while lying
[51:15] no
[51:17] no it was the Revelation that God gave
[51:18] him Flesh and Blood hath not revealed
[51:20] this unto you but my Father which is in
[51:22] heaven so all I'm saying is we need to
[51:25] be careful when we speak the word whose
[51:27] word are we speaking brothers and
[51:28] sisters are we speaking the Lord's word
[51:30] or are we speaking Satan's word
[51:34] because we're going to speak one of them
[51:37] you know what I'll tell you this if it's
[51:39] negative it's Satan's word because there
[51:42] ain't one part of the word that's God's
[51:44] that's negative is there
[51:46] if there is I would like to hear it
[51:48] someone should tell me
[51:50] we should talk about it
[51:52] because everything that the Lord says is
[51:54] Holy and true every part of the word is
[51:58] positive towards his children
[52:00] all of his thoughts
[52:03] are positive towards us
[52:05] you know there's these are both
[52:07] anointings Malachi 3 Malachi 4 both
[52:10] anointings of
[52:12] John the Baptist we know that John the
[52:14] Baptist he came
[52:16] in Malachi 3 in Jesus day
[52:19] but they're actually anointings of
[52:21] Elijah
[52:22] they're the Elijah anointings
[52:25] and uh so I just thought I would take a
[52:28] few moments and and just sort of go back
[52:30] I know there's so much here there's so
[52:33] much here with this and I'm just grazing
[52:35] the surface of it today I believe that
[52:37] we'll probably stick around here for a
[52:38] little while Lord willing but you know
[52:40] these are both Elijah's anointings and
[52:42] if we just look back at second Kings
[52:43] chapter two I'll just read it for time's
[52:47] sake verse 14. I mean turn there if you
[52:49] want to go ahead turn there second Kings
[52:52] chapter 2.
[52:54] maybe it would be good to read it second
[52:56] Kings chapter two if you haven't read
[52:59] this in a while I think it might be
[53:00] worthwhile to just read maybe Second
[53:03] Kings
[53:05] um chapter two maybe even chapter one
[53:07] and two and three and four the whole the
[53:10] whole story in here is just fascinating
[53:12] about the Elijah anointing
[53:17] in second Kings chapter two and
[53:20] we know this is the story of Elijah
[53:22] being taken up in the Chariot of fire
[53:25] and and he told Elisha that's why I say
[53:27] go back and read this if you haven't
[53:28] read in a while
[53:30] um he told Elisha that if you see me
[53:33] when I go
[53:34] then whatever you ask you can have
[53:38] so he actually prophesied of of the
[53:40] Rapture that happened here for Elijah
[53:44] but now here we are Elijah has already
[53:46] been raptured he's gone up in the
[53:48] Chariot of fire Elisha wouldn't be uh
[53:51] tricked he wouldn't be distracted Elijah
[53:54] said to Elisha many times you know why
[53:56] don't you just pray here Terry here I
[53:58] pray thee and and I'll go my way and he
[54:00] said no you know I'm not letting you out
[54:01] of my sight man I know that there is a
[54:03] promise coming to me if I see you when
[54:06] you go so I'm not letting you go
[54:08] anywhere you're not getting away from me
[54:09] man I'm getting exactly what is Promised
[54:12] for me and I believe it has to be that
[54:14] way for the True Believer today brothers
[54:16] and sisters but in second Kings chapter
[54:18] 2 verse 14
[54:22] and he took the mantle of Elijah that
[54:25] fell from him and smote the waters and
[54:28] said where is the Lord God of Elijah and
[54:31] when he had also when he had also when
[54:35] he also had Smit in the waters they
[54:38] parted hither and tither and Elisha went
[54:41] over
[54:42] s and sisters I think it's just one of
[54:46] my favorite scriptures because I believe
[54:48] it's the same thing and I know there's
[54:50] people that would say now you're getting
[54:51] crazy you're going out on a limb and
[54:53] saying the the whole mantle Doctrine I'm
[54:55] not saying a mental Doctrine but yet I
[54:57] am saying a mental Doctrine and I am
[54:59] saying that the mantle is the message of
[55:01] the hour and that mantle has been
[55:03] dropped and it's been put in someone's
[55:06] hand who has the mantle today
[55:09] we're not saying that we have some
[55:10] mantle and I know that's a demonic
[55:13] Doctrine out there and I'm not saying
[55:14] that but I am saying the message of the
[55:16] hour brothers and sisters there's a
[55:18] point where we have got to come to in
[55:19] our own lives where we can smoke the
[55:21] waters ourselves and say where is the
[55:23] god of Elijah when we have a problem in
[55:25] our life take the message of the hour
[55:27] and smoke those Waters with it don't
[55:30] just tolerate it and say well I guess
[55:32] it's what God's will is for me God's
[55:33] will is for me to just go through this
[55:35] and I have to endure it God is waiting
[55:37] for us to stand up and say no
[55:40] where is the god of Elijah where's the
[55:43] god of William Miriam Branham
[55:45] Mark 16 in action is the true church
[55:48] that Christ will claim as his own and
[55:50] all else is false that's what the word
[55:53] says that's what the message of the hour
[55:55] says
[55:56] and you know I'll say it this way
[55:57] there's denominational teachers out
[56:00] there who have this Doctrine and they're
[56:03] actually broadening it their own but
[56:05] people are buying into it hook line and
[56:08] sinker
[56:09] they're bypassing the prophet and
[56:11] they're totally getting into this
[56:13] believing it that if I can stand up and
[56:15] say I have authority in Jesus name oh I
[56:18] have it and you know what they do
[56:21] because it's gone that way
[56:24] but to go outside of the prophet of the
[56:26] hour
[56:27] they're going to find that they'll be in
[56:29] the wedding supper and he'll say to them
[56:31] friend how did you get in here why don't
[56:35] you have a wedding garment on we know
[56:37] the whole story I'm not going to go too
[56:39] far with that but unless we come
[56:41] according to the word for our day we're
[56:42] not going to get the right results but
[56:44] there's people is my point they're
[56:46] they're buying into this they understand
[56:48] this principle that when they speak God
[56:50] speaks if they apply the word correctly
[56:55] and when the sons of the prophets
[56:57] verse 15 and when the sons of the
[56:59] prophets which were to view it Jericho
[57:01] saw him they said the spirit of Elijah
[57:04] doth rest on Elisha
[57:07] and they came to meet him and they bowed
[57:09] themselves to the ground before him
[57:11] and you know
[57:12] after this they said well Elijah you
[57:15] know he just must have been translated
[57:17] by God he must have just been teleported
[57:19] somewhere and you know these are the the
[57:21] prophets from the school of the prophets
[57:23] and and they said they bugged him so
[57:25] much to go and look for Elijah because
[57:27] they just didn't listen to what the word
[57:29] of the day was they bugged him so much
[57:31] till he was ashamed is what the word
[57:33] says
[57:34] they made him ashamed at at his
[57:37] understanding of the word that they
[57:39] would say it so much over and over and
[57:41] over you call yourselves prophets and
[57:43] yet you're going to disbelieve the word
[57:45] that was spoken to you
[57:48] okay go ahead go look for him three days
[57:51] they went searching and they couldn't
[57:52] find him and they came back and said oh
[57:54] my truly something must have been there
[57:56] about that saying that you said well
[57:59] yeah the prophet of God said thus saith
[58:01] the Lord there's coming a Time
[58:05] out of birth pains in 1965 brother
[58:08] Bradham says so someday the great
[58:10] Trumpet Of God shall sound the dead in
[58:12] Christ shall rise every knee shall bow
[58:15] every tongue shall confess to this word
[58:19] well what's he coming after what's he
[58:22] coming here for
[58:24] notice
[58:25] she brought forth this complete word
[58:28] which was made flesh under birth Pains
[58:31] of the prophets
[58:32] that blasted out
[58:34] he's a coming
[58:36] he's a coming
[58:37] he's a coming
[58:41] he says but she was without a prophet
[58:43] for 400 years according to history and
[58:46] to scripture
[58:47] from Malachi unto John
[58:51] they only had theologians priests
[58:53] pastors now here we can imagine without
[58:56] that without that what kind of a rotten
[58:59] condition her system must have been in
[59:02] 400 years without a message direct of
[59:07] thus saith the Lord from God
[59:10] so the priest prophets and so forth had
[59:13] got it into an awful mess
[59:15] she was a rotten
[59:18] it's amazing I just had to read this
[59:21] just as we sort of set the background
[59:23] and maybe build a bit of a foundation
[59:25] for all of this discussion but to think
[59:28] 400 years is what brother Bradham was
[59:30] talking about how many years was it
[59:32] since Christ
[59:33] since the initial Church
[59:35] the last major prophet that was on Earth
[59:38] how many years has it been he's saying
[59:40] 400 years here how rotten a condition it
[59:42] must have been in today we're talking
[59:44] thousands of years before the prophet of
[59:47] God would be on the scene again to say
[59:49] thus saith the Lord
[59:51] how rotten of a condition must it be in
[59:54] now oh my I mean we know this I get it
[59:57] in Matthew 17 and his disciples verse 10
[1:00:00] and his disciples asked him saying what
[1:00:03] then say the scribes that Elias must
[1:00:05] first come and Jesus answered and said
[1:00:08] unto them Elias truly shall first come
[1:00:10] and restore all things he shall come and
[1:00:14] restore all things
[1:00:16] but he goes on to say but I say unto you
[1:00:18] that Elias is come already
[1:00:21] and they knew him not
[1:00:24] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:00:26] listed likewise so also the son of man
[1:00:30] suffer of them
[1:00:32] then the disciples understood that he
[1:00:34] spake unto them of John the Baptist
[1:00:38] I believe that that's applicable for our
[1:00:40] day too brothers and sisters
[1:00:43] won't they say the same thing wasn't
[1:00:45] Elias supposed to come wasn't there
[1:00:47] supposed to be a third anointing a
[1:00:50] fourth anointing story of of Elias in
[1:00:52] our day
[1:00:54] was it wasn't something supposed to
[1:00:56] happen
[1:00:57] and and Jesus said I tell you that he's
[1:00:59] already come and they did unto him
[1:01:01] whatsoever they listed and it's happened
[1:01:03] in our day they put out brother Branham
[1:01:05] in the end he talks about it in this
[1:01:07] message birth Pains being in in Arizona
[1:01:10] and not one of the ministers wants to
[1:01:13] actually have any fellowship with him
[1:01:15] because he's off on his Doctrine because
[1:01:18] of a cloud
[1:01:20] because of the opening of the seals it
[1:01:22] was beyond their comprehension but the
[1:01:24] crazy part about it is it was exactly
[1:01:26] according to the word
[1:01:28] it wasn't outside of the word for their
[1:01:30] day but they were willing to take their
[1:01:33] Theology and their Traditions over top
[1:01:36] of actually looking at the word and
[1:01:38] saying well let me just compare this
[1:01:40] with the word does it actually compare
[1:01:44] but I say unto you that Elias has come
[1:01:46] already
[1:01:47] and they knew him not
[1:01:49] but they have done unto him whatsoever
[1:01:51] they listed likewise
[1:01:54] shall also the son of man suffer of them
[1:01:57] what happened in the day
[1:01:59] when William Mary and Branham was here
[1:02:03] it was the coming of the son of man
[1:02:05] it wasn't William Marion Branham
[1:02:08] nope
[1:02:09] he was here just like John the Baptist
[1:02:11] to introduce the coming of the son of
[1:02:14] man
[1:02:15] because remember the word always comes
[1:02:18] to the prophet amen it doesn't come to
[1:02:20] the Theologian it doesn't come to the
[1:02:22] universities it doesn't come to the
[1:02:25] pastors
[1:02:26] doesn't come to the teachers
[1:02:28] doesn't come to the evangelists
[1:02:30] and it doesn't come to the the hireling
[1:02:33] preachers
[1:02:35] it comes to the prophet
[1:02:37] and that profit has come
[1:02:40] in birth pains brother Branham says then
[1:02:43] John
[1:02:44] the promise of Elijah of Malachi 3 not
[1:02:48] Malachi 4 Malachi 3
[1:02:51] because Jesus said the same thing in
[1:02:53] Matthew in the 11th chapter when John's
[1:02:56] Eagle Eye got filmed over
[1:02:58] as I believe pember's early ages
[1:03:01] expresses and he said go ask him if he's
[1:03:04] the one or should we look for another
[1:03:06] see
[1:03:08] and he said Jesus after sending his
[1:03:10] disciples back after telling them to
[1:03:12] stay at the meeting and watch what
[1:03:14] happens and go show John these things
[1:03:18] and blessed is he not offended
[1:03:22] he turned and looked his disciples
[1:03:26] and the people that he was speaking to
[1:03:28] and said what did she go out to see when
[1:03:30] you went to see John
[1:03:33] I just found this so striking as I was
[1:03:35] going through this because I believe it
[1:03:37] could be the same thing today brothers
[1:03:38] and sisters
[1:03:39] what did you see
[1:03:41] when you went out to see William Mary
[1:03:43] and Branham
[1:03:45] what did you see what do you see when
[1:03:47] you press play
[1:03:49] what what are you looking for when when
[1:03:51] you think about the message of the hour
[1:03:54] what what is it that we're doing here
[1:03:57] what's it all about
[1:03:59] Jesus said to his disciples
[1:04:02] what did you go out to see when you went
[1:04:03] to see John
[1:04:05] did you go out to see a man in soft
[1:04:07] Raymond
[1:04:09] and he said I say unto you that's the
[1:04:12] kind that stays in King's palaces now
[1:04:14] this is Brother Branham speaking here
[1:04:15] he's he's paraphrasing the scripture
[1:04:18] um he said did you go out to see a reed
[1:04:20] that was shaken by the wind
[1:04:22] I just love this part
[1:04:24] it's so important for us to maybe just
[1:04:26] stop and dwell on some of these little
[1:04:28] points I believe with all my heart
[1:04:30] because it can be so easy to just hear
[1:04:32] them and just gloss over them and just
[1:04:34] miss them and maybe not pick them up but
[1:04:36] there's some really strong nuggets right
[1:04:38] here
[1:04:39] he said did you go out to see a reed
[1:04:40] that was shaken by the wind in other
[1:04:42] words every little sting come along
[1:04:46] he shook by it
[1:04:49] it's interesting to think about hey a
[1:04:51] reed shaking in the wind I always
[1:04:54] thought about a reed shaking in the wind
[1:04:55] just a rattling noise and you know maybe
[1:04:57] just something there that's looks nice
[1:04:59] or whatever maybe when you see all of
[1:05:01] them it looks like a natural setting but
[1:05:03] here we have the prophet of God saying
[1:05:04] every little sting that came along
[1:05:07] how easy it can be for us to be upset if
[1:05:10] we don't have the token in our lives you
[1:05:12] can have someone quote the message of
[1:05:14] the hour to you and become offended by
[1:05:16] it
[1:05:18] if we don't have the the token in our
[1:05:20] lives
[1:05:21] someone can come along and and be used
[1:05:24] by Satan to beguile us to think that
[1:05:28] maybe the pastor doesn't love you he
[1:05:30] hasn't phoned you
[1:05:32] he doesn't care for you at all or the
[1:05:35] Deacons
[1:05:36] they're just rude
[1:05:38] the deacons have no care concern for
[1:05:40] what our spiritual health is
[1:05:43] you can have all of these different
[1:05:45] thoughts that can come into your mind
[1:05:46] but brothers and sisters without the
[1:05:47] Holy Ghost In Our Lives there's nothing
[1:05:49] taking them into subjection according to
[1:05:52] the word
[1:05:53] it's something that will come along and
[1:05:55] and take us far away and that's what
[1:05:57] he's saying here did you go out to see a
[1:05:59] reed that was shaken in the wind did you
[1:06:00] go to see something that was good the
[1:06:02] the latest and the greatest did you go
[1:06:04] out to see the the most fascinating
[1:06:06] thing that came along since sliced bread
[1:06:09] in other words did every little sting
[1:06:11] come along Shook You by it I'll tell you
[1:06:13] if you just come over to join our group
[1:06:15] we can give you a better salary
[1:06:18] he just takes it right out of Jesus time
[1:06:21] and brings it right into current time
[1:06:23] and say that you know what if you don't
[1:06:25] like what's going on over there come on
[1:06:26] over here let's just do something a
[1:06:28] little we could just do whatever we want
[1:06:29] over here and sure enough we can
[1:06:32] God will allow it
[1:06:34] but is it according to his will I don't
[1:06:36] know we we just want to be careful to
[1:06:38] make sure it is
[1:06:41] he says I'll tell you if you just come
[1:06:43] over and join our group we'll give you a
[1:06:45] better salary not John
[1:06:47] if you just won't preach against this
[1:06:48] and that well you can join our group
[1:06:52] not John
[1:06:53] said then what did you go out to see
[1:06:56] a prophet
[1:06:58] and I say unto you more than a prophet
[1:07:01] for if ye can receive it this is he who
[1:07:05] was spoken by the prophet saying I'll
[1:07:08] send my messenger before my face
[1:07:11] to prepare the way he says that's
[1:07:13] Malachi 3 1 not Malachi 4 at all
[1:07:18] that's a different
[1:07:20] because that Elijah come
[1:07:22] to the worlds to be burnt immediately
[1:07:25] and the righteous walk out on the ashes
[1:07:28] of the wicked
[1:07:30] and brothers and sisters going back to
[1:07:32] our scripture here in in Malachi chapter
[1:07:34] 4 verse 3 and ye shall tread down the
[1:07:37] wicked for they shall be ashes Under The
[1:07:40] Souls of your feet in that day that I
[1:07:42] shall do this saith the Lord of hosts
[1:07:44] just think about it
[1:07:46] here we are however many days after this
[1:07:49] Prophet was here on Earth
[1:07:52] with a prophetic utterance
[1:07:54] saying these words
[1:07:56] because that Elijah come
[1:07:58] he's speaking about himself
[1:08:00] not insane when I come
[1:08:03] he's saying when that Elijah comes when
[1:08:05] that anointing comes
[1:08:06] that the world's going to be burnt over
[1:08:09] right after he says
[1:08:11] immediately
[1:08:13] and then the righteous walk out on the
[1:08:15] ashes of the wicked
[1:08:17] so we're talking about God's timetable
[1:08:19] here
[1:08:21] how many days do we have left here on
[1:08:23] this Earth
[1:08:25] to preach this message
[1:08:27] to hear this message how many more
[1:08:30] mother's days do we have to celebrate
[1:08:32] brothers and sisters
[1:08:33] we don't know
[1:08:35] I'm not going to put a time stamp on it
[1:08:37] but I will say that we are allowed to
[1:08:40] know the season
[1:08:42] and if you want to know God has a
[1:08:44] timepiece just look at Israel
[1:08:46] they're building houses over there at a
[1:08:48] fervent pace
[1:08:50] they're settlers settling all over
[1:08:52] Israel because they know that where the
[1:08:55] settlers are scattered over Israel that
[1:08:58] they have to get protection from the
[1:09:00] police from the military and the more
[1:09:02] land they take the more land they get if
[1:09:05] they just sit back and say no we're just
[1:09:07] not going to do anything and you know
[1:09:08] we'll just follow the international
[1:09:09] rules they know that they're in their
[1:09:12] promised land and they know that's their
[1:09:14] land and they're going forward because
[1:09:16] of what's in their hearts what's
[1:09:18] genetically coded in their souls they're
[1:09:20] going forward because that hundred and
[1:09:22] forty four thousand is actually rising
[1:09:24] up today
[1:09:26] one of these days those two witnesses
[1:09:28] will appear on all of the media Outlets
[1:09:30] all over the world we know that's coming
[1:09:33] brother Branham says that immediately
[1:09:35] after
[1:09:37] the righteous walk out on the ashes of
[1:09:39] the wicked that's why I said earlier
[1:09:41] brothers and sisters as we go forward as
[1:09:44] calves of the stall knowing that we're
[1:09:47] completely looked after that we really
[1:09:48] are completely looked after in our lives
[1:09:51] sometimes it can feel so terrible maybe
[1:09:54] lonely maybe frustrating maybe scary all
[1:09:58] of these things we just walk in through
[1:10:00] the valley of the shadow of death but
[1:10:02] brothers and sisters don't fear any evil
[1:10:04] because his rod and his staff it
[1:10:06] Comforts us he checks us out he makes
[1:10:09] sure that we're healthy he doesn't leave
[1:10:10] us abandoned or on our own he is with us
[1:10:13] everywhere that we go he knows our every
[1:10:16] single care
[1:10:18] we have the ability to walk
[1:10:21] with the souls of our feet today
[1:10:25] on the ashes of the wicked
[1:10:27] because all that we see today as we walk
[1:10:30] forward today brothers and sisters just
[1:10:32] just think about this as you go forwards
[1:10:34] today while we walk around today
[1:10:37] all of this
[1:10:38] all of it man is potentially ashes
[1:10:41] already
[1:10:43] all of it it's all going to burn all of
[1:10:47] it has to be purified all of the things
[1:10:49] that we keep sacred and and we want to
[1:10:52] hold dear and near to our hearts it's
[1:10:54] all going to burn
[1:10:55] all of it our flesh our bodies Our
[1:10:58] temples that sometimes will worship all
[1:11:02] of it is going to burn none of it is
[1:11:04] going to make it over there
[1:11:06] all of it has to burn
[1:11:08] so as we go forwards I just wanted to
[1:11:11] throw this out there let's think about
[1:11:12] this potentially if it's all going to
[1:11:14] burn then it's potentially already ashes
[1:11:17] remember that Abraham he called the
[1:11:20] things that weren't as though they were
[1:11:22] right
[1:11:23] and the things that were as though they
[1:11:25] weren't
[1:11:27] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:11:29] righteousness
[1:11:30] don't think it's any different for us
[1:11:32] brothers and sisters don't say that's a
[1:11:34] special blessing just for Abraham and
[1:11:36] not for me
[1:11:38] we have the exact same thing we've got
[1:11:40] more
[1:11:41] you know it goes right back to that
[1:11:42] saying that you know when we get over
[1:11:44] there
[1:11:45] we're going to say Moses how did you do
[1:11:47] it
[1:11:48] Daniel how did you endure the Lion's Den
[1:11:51] overnight how did you make it all these
[1:11:53] people are going to say no no no no no
[1:11:54] no no there's lots of time there's as
[1:11:57] many years as we have desire for to talk
[1:12:00] about all that we want to know how you
[1:12:02] survived laodicea how did you survive
[1:12:05] with a lid of Hell taken off and all of
[1:12:08] the Devils of all of the ages that never
[1:12:11] die all those spirits that had their
[1:12:13] guns trained on you how did you have the
[1:12:17] ability to just continually keep getting
[1:12:19] up Satan would knock you down and you
[1:12:21] just get back up again
[1:12:23] Satan would come around and try and
[1:12:25] steal one of your children and you would
[1:12:27] just get back up again and and and Satan
[1:12:29] would come around and try and do
[1:12:30] something to your wife and you just get
[1:12:32] back up again Satan would come around
[1:12:33] and try and do something to your
[1:12:34] business and you just get back up again
[1:12:36] Satan would come around and try and do
[1:12:37] something to your church and you would
[1:12:39] just get back up again it doesn't matter
[1:12:41] what came your way you just kept kept
[1:12:42] getting back up how could you possibly
[1:12:44] have the strength to do that it's gonna
[1:12:46] happen brothers and sisters they're
[1:12:48] going to say how did you survive Leo
[1:12:50] decia and we're gonna say oh it wasn't
[1:12:52] us Oh Glory to God it was the spirit of
[1:12:55] the Lord Jesus Christ Living out through
[1:12:57] me because his light his life Came Upon
[1:13:00] that genetic seed that was put in me
[1:13:02] before the foundation of the world just
[1:13:03] like everyone else and when that light
[1:13:05] hit that seed omnipotence happened
[1:13:09] two omnipotence came together and it
[1:13:12] became the Lord Jesus Christ manifest in
[1:13:14] flesh again on Earth it wasn't me at all
[1:13:17] there's no way that I ever could have
[1:13:18] done that I'm sure that every one of us
[1:13:20] can look back in our lives even right
[1:13:22] now today and say how did I do that
[1:13:25] how did that ever happen in my life how
[1:13:27] is that even possible but you know we
[1:13:29] know how it's possible
[1:13:32] it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:35] and you know when those things happen in
[1:13:36] our lives isn't it amazing if you look
[1:13:38] at this too I don't think I'm exclusive
[1:13:40] to this but when we have things like
[1:13:42] that that happen in our lives Satan will
[1:13:44] come around and try and get us to just
[1:13:46] like bury it in our memory as quickly as
[1:13:48] possible
[1:13:49] and then we forget about it
[1:13:51] and then time goes by and and we haven't
[1:13:53] even thought about it for so long we
[1:13:55] didn't don't even think about it like
[1:13:56] it's just you know normal that that
[1:13:58] thing happened but you know when we
[1:13:59] stand back and look at it and think wow
[1:14:01] look at that thing that happened there
[1:14:03] that was incredible how could that ever
[1:14:05] have happened
[1:14:06] it's Satan's goal to just get us so busy
[1:14:08] and so bogged down and so balled up that
[1:14:10] we just forget about the blessings in
[1:14:12] our lives brothers and sisters that song
[1:14:14] says count your blessings and name them
[1:14:16] one by one for a purpose so that we have
[1:14:19] that come to our remembrance about how
[1:14:21] Mighty a God that we serve and as much
[1:14:24] as Satan wants to try and and and and
[1:14:27] squash all of the the the the
[1:14:29] understanding and the and the present
[1:14:31] tense I am the ability to recognize
[1:14:34] God's presence in our lives
[1:14:37] we remember it and it causes something
[1:14:39] to happen in us we rejoice
[1:14:41] why
[1:14:43] in birth pains he goes on to say now
[1:14:45] notice his message never stirred them
[1:14:47] very much from their ecclesiastical
[1:14:49] sleep
[1:14:51] they just said there's a crazy man down
[1:14:53] there pass him by
[1:14:55] calls himself crazy
[1:14:57] trying to drown the people in water
[1:14:59] there
[1:15:00] you know there's people today that would
[1:15:02] say that about brother Branham about the
[1:15:04] people that try and believe the message
[1:15:06] of the hour
[1:15:08] and they would say that because we don't
[1:15:10] do it according to the mainstream
[1:15:12] theology that we baptize in the name of
[1:15:14] the father and of the son and of the
[1:15:16] Holy Ghost even though we do
[1:15:18] because whose name is that
[1:15:21] they're all titles they're all titles
[1:15:24] they're all titles of some position that
[1:15:26] someone would hold in their life
[1:15:28] potentially but they're not in a name
[1:15:31] but we know that he has come to confound
[1:15:33] the wise
[1:15:34] the wise and The Prudent the ones who
[1:15:36] are the most eloquent eloquent studied
[1:15:38] individuals that have everything figured
[1:15:41] out he's come to confound the wise
[1:15:44] and to reveal himself unto babes even
[1:15:47] those the ones that would be willing to
[1:15:49] just learn and say you know I don't know
[1:15:51] if I understand that but you know Lord I
[1:15:53] believe that you are God that you are
[1:15:55] The Great I Am present tense I am which
[1:16:00] means that right now even in this moment
[1:16:02] you could reveal yourself to me in such
[1:16:04] a way that I might be able to understand
[1:16:05] what that Doctrine means
[1:16:08] why is it such a big deal brothers and
[1:16:11] sisters
[1:16:12] the water baptism
[1:16:14] remember brother Bradham he had that
[1:16:16] trap set for him the angel of the Lord
[1:16:18] came and showed him the Chicago
[1:16:20] Ministerial Association we talked about
[1:16:22] it recently they set a trap forum and
[1:16:24] they were going to challenge him on
[1:16:25] water baptism but the angel of the Lord
[1:16:28] came and gave him the ability to go
[1:16:30] there in the moment and not be afraid
[1:16:32] and say see I told you that you were
[1:16:34] going to not have this room the way that
[1:16:36] you thought you were going to have it
[1:16:37] you didn't get that room now you've got
[1:16:39] this room and you're here to challenge
[1:16:41] me on water baptism so bring it on get
[1:16:43] your Bibles out come and stand on the
[1:16:45] stage right beside me here and let's
[1:16:46] actually duke it out according to the
[1:16:48] word show me in the Bible where it says
[1:16:51] not to baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:16:52] Jesus Christ show me in the Bible where
[1:16:55] it says to baptize in the name of the
[1:16:57] father and the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:16:59] and where they did baptize in the name
[1:17:01] of the father and of the son of the Holy
[1:17:03] Ghost because they never have ever
[1:17:05] baptized anyone in the Bible in the name
[1:17:07] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:17:09] Holy Ghost it's never happened you can't
[1:17:12] find it in the Bible in the scriptures
[1:17:14] and that's such a good one ask a
[1:17:16] theologian show me in the Bible where
[1:17:18] you can find that
[1:17:20] it's not there
[1:17:23] but just like John the Baptist there's a
[1:17:25] crazy man down there that's what they
[1:17:27] say about brother Branham
[1:17:29] the same thing the Elijah anointing not
[1:17:32] an eloquent man not a studied man not a
[1:17:34] learned man
[1:17:36] he talks in this message too about how
[1:17:38] you don't get into pulpits anymore back
[1:17:41] in 1965 unless you have some lld behind
[1:17:45] your name some some Bachelor of whatever
[1:17:47] you have to have a degree in theology to
[1:17:51] be able to preach behind a Pulpit and
[1:17:52] and talking about what a rotten place
[1:17:54] that it's gotten
[1:17:55] it's terrible to think that that's
[1:17:57] really the way it is today where did you
[1:17:59] learn where did you study I've had
[1:18:01] people say that to me where did you
[1:18:02] learn where did you study I say you know
[1:18:05] what Calgary Living Word assembly I got
[1:18:07] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:08] Christ for the remission of my sins and
[1:18:10] I received the Holy Ghost and you know
[1:18:13] what he just revealed himself to me
[1:18:14] through the word I just kept going to
[1:18:16] church I just let my pastor preach I
[1:18:19] just kept saying amen and the more I
[1:18:21] said amen the more that he preached the
[1:18:23] more that I learned the more studied I
[1:18:25] became
[1:18:27] it wasn't a school
[1:18:29] it wasn't a theology
[1:18:31] no it was the Holy Ghost himself the
[1:18:34] Lord Jesus Christ the spirit of Truth
[1:18:36] coming into me leading me into all truth
[1:18:40] but you know they'll say that we're
[1:18:42] heretic for it
[1:18:43] that that we're following a crazy man
[1:18:46] just like they said about John the
[1:18:47] Baptist he said there there's a crazy
[1:18:49] man down there just pass him by he calls
[1:18:52] himself crazy trying to drown people in
[1:18:54] the water see why why because he's
[1:18:56] baptizing unto repentance
[1:18:59] right
[1:19:00] setting forth the direction for the
[1:19:03] church preparing the way of the Lord
[1:19:06] according to Malachi 3 verse 1. why
[1:19:10] there's nothing to that old man why he
[1:19:12] he don't even have on the right kind of
[1:19:14] clothes
[1:19:15] he's got a sheepskin wrapped around him
[1:19:18] brothers and sisters just don't ever get
[1:19:20] caught up in the Veil
[1:19:22] goodness sakes even today we can do that
[1:19:24] maybe brother Barry doesn't wear his tie
[1:19:26] just right
[1:19:27] maybe maybe his clothes are a little
[1:19:30] tight
[1:19:31] maybe his wife cooks too good for him
[1:19:33] and and his clothes are a little bit
[1:19:35] tight and you know how could he be you
[1:19:37] know whatever don't don't don't worry
[1:19:39] about the veil don't stumble at the veil
[1:19:41] brothers and sisters see if the word
[1:19:43] that's being spoken is true
[1:19:45] when we look at a Ministry don't judge
[1:19:48] it remember what we talked about
[1:19:49] murmuring
[1:19:52] murmuring we're not murmuring against
[1:19:53] the man even though carnally will say
[1:19:56] well yes I am I'm talking about brother
[1:19:58] Paul I don't like the way he leads songs
[1:20:00] I'm gonna talk about brother Paul you
[1:20:02] know when we're doing that in a low
[1:20:04] guttural voice behind his back we're
[1:20:06] murmuring and you know what's happening
[1:20:08] is if if God has anointed him to lead
[1:20:11] songs in a congregation and we're
[1:20:13] murmuring about him guess who's who are
[1:20:16] murmuring about brothers and sisters
[1:20:17] we're we've said this before but it
[1:20:19] could be about anyone a deacon a sound
[1:20:21] technician a pastor a musician anyone
[1:20:24] our brother our sister if we're talking
[1:20:26] about them in a low guttural Town we're
[1:20:28] murmuring and if God is moving in their
[1:20:31] life then you're not murmuring about
[1:20:32] that brother or sister you're murmuring
[1:20:34] about God
[1:20:36] and what happened to the people
[1:20:39] that murmured about God
[1:20:42] it took a prophet to stand in the breach
[1:20:45] it took a profit to stay the plague
[1:20:48] and as quickly as God said you know what
[1:20:51] the day after they saw the ground open
[1:20:54] up and swallow Cora and dathan for
[1:20:56] murmuring for murmuring the day after
[1:20:58] now they're murmuring again how quickly
[1:21:02] we forget
[1:21:04] the very next day
[1:21:06] I just it blows my mind to think that in
[1:21:09] the moment God told them step aside I'm
[1:21:11] done
[1:21:12] what did the prophet do on his face
[1:21:16] him and his priest him and Aaron on
[1:21:18] their faces and while they're on their
[1:21:20] face now the prophet is speaking the
[1:21:22] word he's not actually saying why why I
[1:21:25] gotta cry out to God he's actually got
[1:21:27] the fear of God and he's able to
[1:21:28] actually speak he's able to prophesy
[1:21:31] Aaron go and get the sensors fill them
[1:21:33] with fire take the NSAIDs get in the
[1:21:35] middle of the people because the plague
[1:21:36] is on its way
[1:21:37] and how many people died in the midst
[1:21:39] there
[1:21:40] and the word says that he went and stood
[1:21:42] between the living and the dead and you
[1:21:44] know it's the same thing with a prophet
[1:21:45] for our day brothers and sisters he came
[1:21:47] and he stood between the living and the
[1:21:49] dead and he made a sacrifice for us so
[1:21:52] that we could actually have the word put
[1:21:54] in our hands we don't know the things
[1:21:56] that he went through in his life we're
[1:21:58] not here to worship him we're not
[1:22:00] elevating the man but you know what God
[1:22:02] uses a prophet to speak to his people
[1:22:04] and that's the way he does it period
[1:22:06] period And if we want to try and say
[1:22:09] that something else there's another way
[1:22:10] there's another Avenue where did it come
[1:22:12] from
[1:22:14] is it in Scripture
[1:22:16] I don't think so
[1:22:17] I think it'd be in a theological study
[1:22:19] perhaps maybe a University degree
[1:22:23] that would say there's something else
[1:22:25] but it's not according to the word
[1:22:26] because the word says the word only
[1:22:29] comes to a prophet
[1:22:32] but where the the devil will get in and
[1:22:34] say well the days of Miracles has passed
[1:22:36] the days of prophets has passed there's
[1:22:38] no more Prophets
[1:22:39] and you know there isn't really
[1:22:42] except for to Israel
[1:22:44] because there was a prophet for this age
[1:22:46] and and that Prophet rose up and and
[1:22:49] served his purpose and God took him home
[1:22:53] he didn't take him home so that he could
[1:22:54] come back and actually finish something
[1:22:56] he actually did exactly what he was
[1:22:58] supposed to do
[1:23:00] he stored up food for a season
[1:23:03] for a group of people that would have
[1:23:04] the ability to say be it unto me
[1:23:06] according to thy will according to Thy
[1:23:09] Word
[1:23:10] brother Branham says here in this
[1:23:11] message why there's nothing to that old
[1:23:13] man why he he don't even have on the
[1:23:15] right kind of clothes he's got a
[1:23:16] sheepskin wrapped around him why he's
[1:23:19] he's as poor as job's turkey why why
[1:23:22] what Seminary did he ever come out of
[1:23:24] what Fellowship card will not even
[1:23:26] cooperate in his meetings
[1:23:28] we'll just let them stay down there and
[1:23:30] starve it out
[1:23:31] can you imagine these are Christians
[1:23:34] these are the Christian Elders in the
[1:23:36] community
[1:23:38] you know someone might say well that's
[1:23:39] Brother Brad I'm saying that but I would
[1:23:41] say and I'm sure everyone else would say
[1:23:43] this is a prophet who had the ability to
[1:23:45] discern the hearts of men
[1:23:48] he was probably speaking exactly the
[1:23:50] thoughts of people remember in the
[1:23:52] message there's many messages that you
[1:23:54] can listen to where he'll say oh don't
[1:23:55] don't think that I I can tell you're
[1:23:57] thinking that
[1:23:58] I heard that I felt that many different
[1:24:02] ways he says it
[1:24:05] the world hasn't changed very much
[1:24:06] neither has it systems but we'll just
[1:24:08] let them stay down there
[1:24:10] he don't have any you you you don't you
[1:24:13] you know why he didn't remember his
[1:24:15] father was a priest he's talking about
[1:24:16] John the Baptist here remember why he
[1:24:18] was a Madman he was a a strange fella
[1:24:21] his father was a priest but why didn't
[1:24:23] he follow the line of his father which
[1:24:25] was accustomed for the children to do in
[1:24:26] those days because he had something too
[1:24:29] great a message he was to introduce the
[1:24:32] Messiah for the Holy Spirit had said so
[1:24:34] that little Remnant had been brought
[1:24:36] back by the message of Gabriel down
[1:24:38] there knew that he would be so
[1:24:42] the people knew it they knew that he
[1:24:44] would be so hey this is what the
[1:24:47] prophet's saying here so we're told
[1:24:48] about nine years old he went out to the
[1:24:50] Wilderness after losing his father and
[1:24:52] his mother that he went into the
[1:24:53] Wilderness because he had to hear
[1:24:55] exactly he had to get away from all of
[1:24:58] the all of the theological studies and
[1:25:00] all the traditional teaching and ways he
[1:25:02] had to get away from all of that because
[1:25:04] of that great big theological building
[1:25:06] there they said now I know that you're
[1:25:08] supposed to be the one to announce the
[1:25:09] Messiah Isaiah said you was coming so
[1:25:13] you are going to be that voice
[1:25:16] now don't you think that brother Jones
[1:25:17] here just meets
[1:25:20] exactly
[1:25:22] and he'd be easily persuaded
[1:25:25] but he never learned any of their
[1:25:26] systems
[1:25:27] his message was too important he went
[1:25:29] out into the Wilderness to stay
[1:25:32] I love how brother Branham just Compares
[1:25:34] it to a natural uh tense
[1:25:37] a a natural time
[1:25:41] from the past to a current Place how it
[1:25:44] could be you know
[1:25:46] wouldn't brother so and so or or or
[1:25:48] brother Sachin such wouldn't he be the
[1:25:50] perfect person for that job
[1:25:55] but he went out in the wilderness so
[1:25:57] that he could actually get rid of all of
[1:25:58] that
[1:25:59] and and and lose all of that traditional
[1:26:01] teaching
[1:26:03] remember his dad was a priest
[1:26:05] he knew the word he was raised with it
[1:26:08] and and it's interesting because the
[1:26:11] word came to him while he was still in
[1:26:12] his mama's womb
[1:26:14] the word always comes to the prophet
[1:26:17] you know in Revelations chapter 12 just
[1:26:19] speaking about the Wilderness briefly
[1:26:21] there's an interesting thought I wanted
[1:26:22] to mention here and the woman fled Into
[1:26:24] the Wilderness Revelation 12 6 the woman
[1:26:27] fled Into the Wilderness where she hath
[1:26:29] a place prepared of God that they should
[1:26:31] feed her a thousand two hundred and
[1:26:33] three score days
[1:26:36] it's interesting there's a discussion
[1:26:38] going around now that Revelations
[1:26:39] chapter 12 this discussion about the
[1:26:42] woman that fled Into the Wilderness we
[1:26:44] know that the woman is a representation
[1:26:46] of the church and we know the Wilderness
[1:26:49] is actually potentially the United
[1:26:53] States of America because when this
[1:26:56] prophecy was going forward when this was
[1:26:58] written when John was on the Isle of
[1:27:00] Patmos what was the United States it
[1:27:03] wasn't settled by anyone
[1:27:05] it was completely Wild
[1:27:07] but the woman being a type of the church
[1:27:09] had fled Into the Wilderness where she
[1:27:12] hath a place prepared of God
[1:27:15] that they should be able to just feed
[1:27:17] her for that space of time and you know
[1:27:19] if we stand back and look at it I'm not
[1:27:22] saying it is or it isn't I'm just saying
[1:27:23] it's interesting if we think about it
[1:27:24] because the very next chapters
[1:27:26] Revelations chapter 13 and the prophet
[1:27:28] clearly declares that is the USA
[1:27:32] but this whole entire nation was there
[1:27:35] raised up for a purpose so they could
[1:27:37] have freedom of religion right freedom
[1:27:39] of religion but what was the purpose of
[1:27:41] it it wasn't so they could have freedom
[1:27:42] of religion it was so that God could
[1:27:44] actually raise up a prophet
[1:27:46] in the land
[1:27:48] for the Gentile church that was the
[1:27:50] purpose of it but it's interesting to
[1:27:52] look at this scripture and think could
[1:27:54] that actually be the woman being the
[1:27:56] church fleeing Into the Wilderness North
[1:27:58] America where she hath a place prepared
[1:28:00] of God that they should feed her there a
[1:28:03] thousand two hundred and three score
[1:28:05] days
[1:28:07] it's interesting in 1933 we know it was
[1:28:10] the 17th person was being baptized on
[1:28:13] the Ohio River that Supernatural light
[1:28:15] it came down over top of God's Prophet
[1:28:18] it came down over him and it said there
[1:28:20] was a voice that spoke as John the
[1:28:22] Baptist was sent to forerun the first
[1:28:24] coming of the Lord so your ministry will
[1:28:26] forerun the second coming of the Lord
[1:28:30] we're talking about uh the same thing
[1:28:33] the same anointing just the same thing
[1:28:35] that we had in in Malachi chapter three
[1:28:38] behold I will send my messenger and he
[1:28:40] shall prepare the way before me and the
[1:28:43] Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to
[1:28:46] his Temple
[1:28:49] excuse me
[1:28:50] even the Covenant whom ye delight and
[1:28:52] behold he shall come saith the Lord of
[1:28:54] hosts
[1:28:56] behold
[1:28:58] I said unto you Elijah the prophet
[1:29:01] he shall prepare the second coming of
[1:29:05] the Lord
[1:29:07] exactly the same thing
[1:29:09] and we know that that's happened
[1:29:10] brothers and sisters when's the Lord
[1:29:12] coming he's here
[1:29:14] don't look for a 60-foot Jesus
[1:29:17] he's tabernacled in flesh again here on
[1:29:20] Earth
[1:29:20] and and and it's in every one of us it's
[1:29:23] in the many membered body in in the
[1:29:25] bride body brother Branham came and he
[1:29:28] said in that message I can't remember
[1:29:29] which one it is now maybe the statue of
[1:29:31] the perfect man I didn't come to start
[1:29:32] an organization or an association I came
[1:29:35] to show to instruct children of God that
[1:29:38] they are the PowerHouse of the Holy
[1:29:40] Ghost
[1:29:41] the individual to raise up the
[1:29:43] individual to the place where they
[1:29:44] recognize what they are because when
[1:29:47] they recognize what they are then the
[1:29:48] Rapture will go we read that quote on
[1:29:50] Wednesday I believe
[1:29:52] man's interpretation of the word
[1:29:53] brothers and sisters what man calls
[1:29:55] great God calls foolish what God calls
[1:29:57] great man calls foolish
[1:30:00] excuse me remember the story of David
[1:30:02] Jesse he had many sons when Samuel came
[1:30:04] to anoint the the next king of Israel
[1:30:08] God gave him Direction he didn't say go
[1:30:10] anoint David he said go anoint the son
[1:30:12] of Jesse right
[1:30:14] he went there and said where's your sons
[1:30:17] Jesse because I know one of them is
[1:30:19] going to be king of Israel and I'm sure
[1:30:21] Jesse was was was excited he was so
[1:30:24] proud that one of his great boys was
[1:30:25] going to be that one and there was some
[1:30:27] with great stature he had many sons
[1:30:29] right but when David came he he was the
[1:30:32] smallest of the bunch but he was the one
[1:30:34] that God chose we know the story really
[1:30:36] well
[1:30:37] don't look at the man brothers and
[1:30:38] sisters if we look at John the Baptist
[1:30:41] he looked like a fanatic he didn't
[1:30:43] follow a theological pattern but the
[1:30:45] reason for it is because there was a
[1:30:46] change in the ministry and if we take a
[1:30:49] look at William Mary and bradham's life
[1:30:50] if if we can stand back and just do a
[1:30:53] parallel examination of his life
[1:30:55] compared to John the Baptist which is
[1:30:57] another Elijah anointing there was a
[1:30:59] change in the ministry and what it was
[1:31:02] Was preparing the way of the Lord in
[1:31:04] both cases okay
[1:31:06] and you know the interesting part when
[1:31:08] John the Baptist was actually going to
[1:31:11] prepare the way of the Lord was
[1:31:12] baptizing Jesus was alive and walking on
[1:31:16] Earth
[1:31:18] what happened with what brother Bradham
[1:31:21] you know I know that we we all know
[1:31:23] everybody knows
[1:31:26] there's a Doctrine out there right now
[1:31:27] that says that yeah there's there's
[1:31:29] Jesus has come and and the people that
[1:31:32] don't actually have this revelation of
[1:31:35] the doctrine they are lost as lost can
[1:31:38] be
[1:31:38] and you know what that's not the
[1:31:40] doctrine of Jesus Christ
[1:31:42] that's not what he's after he's calling
[1:31:44] to whomsoever Will and and he's still
[1:31:47] calling thanks be to God that he's still
[1:31:49] calling like we talked about earlier
[1:31:51] it's just his grace that keeps us going
[1:31:53] gives us the ability to live
[1:31:57] excuse me
[1:31:59] but John the Baptist was declaring the
[1:32:01] coming of the Lord so was brother
[1:32:02] Branham
[1:32:03] John was anointed to be in his position
[1:32:05] from his mother's womb so was William
[1:32:08] Branham
[1:32:10] but it was in his mother that he first
[1:32:12] met the word and that's out of Luke Luke
[1:32:15] 1 chapter 39 and Mary arose in those
[1:32:17] days and went into the Hill Country with
[1:32:18] hasten to a city of Judah and entered
[1:32:21] into the house of Zacharias
[1:32:24] Mary did and saluted Elizabeth
[1:32:28] and it came to pass that when Elizabeth
[1:32:30] heard the salutation of Mary The Babe
[1:32:33] leapt in her womb
[1:32:35] and this is beautiful
[1:32:37] because Elizabeth was filled with the
[1:32:40] Holy Ghost
[1:32:41] even though the Holy Ghost wasn't yet
[1:32:43] given
[1:32:45] excuse me
[1:32:46] that's why brothers and sisters we don't
[1:32:48] want to put God in a box and say that I
[1:32:50] think it should be a certain way because
[1:32:52] the scripture says something a certain
[1:32:53] way and and indeed we do have to say it
[1:32:56] that way but again we need to be very
[1:32:58] careful we put God inside a box because
[1:33:01] he's Sovereign he'll do exactly what he
[1:33:03] wants to do but he'll never be contrary
[1:33:05] to his word
[1:33:08] and she spake out with a loud voice and
[1:33:10] said blessed art thou among women and
[1:33:11] blessed is the fruit of thy womb and
[1:33:13] whence is this to me that the mother of
[1:33:16] my Lord should come unto me for lo as
[1:33:19] soon as the voice of thy salutation
[1:33:21] sounded in my ears The Babe leapt in my
[1:33:26] womb for joy
[1:33:28] brothers and sisters that was the very
[1:33:30] first
[1:33:31] word coming to this prophet
[1:33:35] in the womb it wasn't when he was
[1:33:38] standing in the water even though it was
[1:33:41] but it was a furthering of the word
[1:33:44] when he came to him in the water he said
[1:33:45] it behooves us to fulfill all
[1:33:47] righteousness now baptize me John said
[1:33:50] no way I can't do that how could I do
[1:33:51] that it's up to you to baptize me
[1:33:54] I'm not worthy to latch your shoes
[1:33:57] I said come on John we have to fulfill
[1:33:58] scripture now just let's get her done
[1:34:00] let's wash the sacrifice here
[1:34:02] right
[1:34:04] Malachi chapter 3.
[1:34:07] I'll call the musicians as we uh as we
[1:34:09] wrap this up here just just for today
[1:34:12] just as a comparison of of William
[1:34:15] Branham and John the Baptist to look at
[1:34:17] it and think that both of them were sent
[1:34:19] to forerun the coming of the Lord
[1:34:22] that's that's the reason they came
[1:34:25] John the Baptist was a bit of a fanatic
[1:34:27] and people would say William Miriam
[1:34:28] Branham was a bit of a fanatic and the
[1:34:30] only reason they would say that is maybe
[1:34:31] because he was poor maybe he didn't have
[1:34:33] good grammar maybe he didn't have a
[1:34:35] university education but you know where
[1:34:37] he really became a fanatic is when he
[1:34:40] actually
[1:34:41] just like Jesus
[1:34:43] said you know what I was just standing
[1:34:45] there when he came
[1:34:47] and and
[1:34:49] yeah it's amazing to look at it and
[1:34:51] think that we have seen the coming of
[1:34:54] the Lord in our day
[1:34:56] and many people might not agree to that
[1:34:58] many people might not understand that
[1:35:00] but I just think it's so important for
[1:35:02] us to just harp on that just talk about
[1:35:04] that because as soon as we recognize
[1:35:07] what we are then the Rapture will go
[1:35:09] that's the only promise to the Gentile
[1:35:11] Church
[1:35:13] we need to make sure that we actually
[1:35:15] live up to the scripture
[1:35:18] that there is about us in Malachi
[1:35:21] chapter 3 stand with me this morning as
[1:35:22] we as we close behold I will send my
[1:35:25] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[1:35:27] of the Lord before me
[1:35:29] and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly
[1:35:32] come to his Temple even the messenger of
[1:35:36] the Covenant whom ye Delight in behold
[1:35:38] he shall come saith the Lord of hosts
[1:35:42] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[1:35:44] the first coming of the Lord
[1:35:46] so you have been sent to Forum the
[1:35:49] second coming of the Lord
[1:35:50] is what that voice told him as he was
[1:35:53] baptizing that day on the Ohio River
[1:35:56] and you know brothers and sisters
[1:35:58] if we go forwards isn't it interesting
[1:36:01] if you just look at that just like John
[1:36:03] the Baptist was baptizing so was the
[1:36:05] prophet today baptizing
[1:36:07] there's no difference right
[1:36:09] the same anointing here he is baptizing
[1:36:12] on the river and he gets that Commission
[1:36:15] so you will forerun the second coming of
[1:36:17] the Lord and in this scripture it says
[1:36:20] the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly
[1:36:22] come to his Temple where's his Temple
[1:36:25] brothers and sisters
[1:36:27] there's a lot of people looking for a
[1:36:28] temple in Israel out east and they have
[1:36:32] all the Fixins to make that Temple
[1:36:35] he's not coming to that Temple
[1:36:37] he's coming to the temple not made by
[1:36:39] hands
[1:36:41] to the soul
[1:36:43] of the believer the children of God that
[1:36:45] Temple
[1:36:46] that one that we sing about come by here
[1:36:49] my lord it's just incredible the way all
[1:36:52] this stuff comes together the Lord just
[1:36:54] vindicates his word by bringing it to
[1:36:55] pass come by here my Lord come by this
[1:36:58] Temple right here Lord not this building
[1:37:01] this building is going to burn
[1:37:03] the soul ain't
[1:37:06] and I trust yours isn't either as
[1:37:08] Believers our soul can't die it can't
[1:37:10] burn
[1:37:12] we have to lay down this flesh though
[1:37:15] every one of our flesh it's got to be
[1:37:18] laid down
[1:37:20] it will not go on
[1:37:22] I wanted to get into uh
[1:37:24] seeing God no man can see God and live
[1:37:29] there's a whole thing that we're going
[1:37:31] to talk about with that too in the
[1:37:32] future but it's just amazing how the
[1:37:34] Lord takes us and and directs our path
[1:37:36] so thankful for his leadership
[1:37:40] trust that something was said today that
[1:37:42] blesses the hearts of the Believers
[1:37:44] maybe we can just bow in prayer
[1:37:47] gracious Heavenly Father
[1:37:49] Lord I pray that
[1:37:52] father if I've said anything on my own
[1:37:54] that you would just forgive me for it
[1:37:55] Lord I don't want to speak on my own I
[1:37:58] just want to speak your word I want to
[1:37:59] speak for you I just want to see your
[1:38:01] word
[1:38:02] grow in the hearts of every one of your
[1:38:05] children father
[1:38:06] I want to see your token displayed in
[1:38:09] everybody's life Lord Jesus father I
[1:38:12] want to see your token displayed in my
[1:38:13] own life
[1:38:15] I want to see the results of your token
[1:38:17] displayed in my life
[1:38:19] I don't want to just be a pretender I
[1:38:21] don't want to be a false Pretender Lord
[1:38:23] I want to see you alive in me
[1:38:27] and I'm so thankful for the instruction
[1:38:29] that we received from the prophet and
[1:38:31] and the true evidence of you alive in me
[1:38:33] is my ability to receive the word my
[1:38:36] ability to be corrected by the word my
[1:38:38] ability to be directed by the word so
[1:38:41] father as we go forwards I pray that we
[1:38:43] could just speak your word Lord we have
[1:38:46] opinions and they're irrelevant the only
[1:38:48] thing that counts is your word you have
[1:38:51] given us a messenger to forerun your
[1:38:54] second coming and Lord Jesus we
[1:38:55] acknowledge that and we accept that and
[1:38:58] we recognize it father what a tremendous
[1:39:00] blessing it is to understand where we
[1:39:03] stand when Prof your Prophet told us
[1:39:05] Lord that immediately after the coming
[1:39:07] of that prophet of that coming of Elijah
[1:39:11] that the world would be burnt over oh
[1:39:13] Father just any minute now Anything
[1:39:15] Could Happen father I pray that you
[1:39:17] would just forgive me for any sin in my
[1:39:19] life Lord let me go forwards from this
[1:39:21] meeting today myself with a Clean Heart
[1:39:24] Lord Jesus Oh father I pray that if
[1:39:26] anybody needs a a blessing from you that
[1:39:29] way if they could just reach out to you
[1:39:31] now with an uplifted hand and say Lord
[1:39:33] be it unto me according to your word
[1:39:35] maybe I haven't been able to live it the
[1:39:37] way that I want to but father I know I'm
[1:39:39] sure not what I used to be but Lord just
[1:39:42] help me to be that which you have
[1:39:43] created me to be
[1:39:45] father I just pray that you would just
[1:39:48] watch over each and every one of us Lord
[1:39:49] we don't know what time Anything Could
[1:39:52] Happen father it could be before this
[1:39:54] service is over it could be before we
[1:39:56] get home it could be before tomorrow it
[1:39:58] could be 10 years from now or a hundred
[1:40:01] years from now we don't know we just
[1:40:03] Trust You Lord and we're so thankful
[1:40:05] that you have your hand upon us that
[1:40:07] Lord we can tread on the ashes of the
[1:40:09] wicked Lord that you have us as as a
[1:40:12] calf in the stall being raised watching
[1:40:14] over our every single need in our lives
[1:40:16] Lord Jesus let us never ever ever take
[1:40:19] you for granted not for a second Lord

[1:40:24] watched over us every single step of the
[1:40:26] way how we love you and we thank you we
[1:40:30] pray that you would just bless the moms
[1:40:31] in a real special way Lord Jesus father
[1:40:34] that you would just be with those who
[1:40:35] are maybe alone those people who maybe
[1:40:39] are confused father we know that there's
[1:40:41] so many different situations in this
