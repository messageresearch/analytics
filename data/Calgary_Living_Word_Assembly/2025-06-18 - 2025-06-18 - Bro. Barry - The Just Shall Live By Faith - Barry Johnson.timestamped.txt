[23:33] Lord Jesus, I believe that is our motive
[23:36] tonight. Lord, we want to leave this
[23:38] building more in love with you than when
[23:40] we came. Oh God, Lord, we know that
[23:42] faith comes by hearing and hearing your
[23:44] word. Lord, it's the only way that the
[23:47] faith of God that resides in us can
[23:49] respond to your word, Lord, and we can
[23:51] leave this building more in love with
[23:53] you, Lord. Father, it's it's the closing
[23:55] days of time. We know that, Lord.
[23:58] Father, we long to be caught up in your
[24:01] arms, our glorious husband, our
[24:03] redeemer, our savior. Lord, as we join
[24:06] you in the clouds and then we crown you
[24:08] king of kings, Lord, it's such a
[24:10] wonderful thing to to anticipate, Lord.
[24:13] We look forward to that with great
[24:15] anticipation. Lord, we we just want to
[24:18] become the bride that you want to us to
[24:21] be. Lord, we you're easy to adore. Lord,
[24:24] help us to serve you in a way that that
[24:26] that you shower your love on us even
[24:28] more. Lord, we desire these things,
[24:31] Lord. We just want to be in love with
[24:33] you. We want to love your word. We want
[24:35] to love each other, oh God. It's so
[24:37] wonderful when brothers and sisters
[24:38] dwell in unity. And here we are tonight,
[24:40] Lord, gathered in a little building,
[24:42] little indescript building, Lord, in a
[24:44] city of a almost two million people. But
[24:46] Lord, nonetheless, through your elective
[24:49] love, here we are tonight to receive the
[24:51] vindicated word, Lord, that you call
[24:53] important in this day. May it change us
[24:56] from glory to glory. May we be so
[24:58] recipient, such so uh open to you, Lord,
[25:02] and receive from you, Lord, that we'd
[25:04] receive what you have in mind for us.
[25:06] Bless our pastor, Lord, as he brings a
[25:08] word. He's labored. Lord, each of us, I
[25:10] believe, have prepared our hearts to
[25:12] come and we come hungering and thirsting
[25:14] tonight. Lord, may you just deliver the
[25:17] word through our brother's lips. And
[25:18] Lord, may it anchor in our souls.
[25:20] Father, may it have an effect that that
[25:22] is exactly what you want from each of us
[25:24] tonight. We just ask you, Lord, to take
[25:27] these these songs of worship, Lord. May
[25:29] you receive them from our hearts. We
[25:31] love you so much, Lord. And we can only
[25:33] say that, Father, because you loved us
[25:35] first. You gave yourself for us. How
[25:37] could we not love you? You gave us the
[25:39] ultimate sacrifice, Lord. You gave
[25:42] yourself. We We are sinless, virtuous,
[25:45] righteous before you tonight because of
[25:47] that sacrifice. Thank you for these
[25:49] things, Lord. Receive our worship now.

[42:00] tonight? Amen.
[42:03] To know that in this world of shifting
[42:06] sands.
[42:08] He is our peace.
[42:11] If you have a need tonight, maybe just
[42:12] make it known unto him by the way an
[42:15] uplift hand as we go to him in prayer.
[42:18] Just have two requests tonight. Just
[42:20] want to remember Sister Beth Vanderlass
[42:24] and also a woman named Ellen Ebing.
[42:27] They both need a touch from the Lord.
[42:30] Heavenly Father, Lord, tonight we're so
[42:33] thankful that we can gather together in
[42:34] your name.
[42:36] Lord, we know that you're here and not
[42:39] just here, Father, for fellowship, but
[42:41] you're here to minister to our needs,
[42:43] Lord.
[42:44] We know that you've provided all of our
[42:46] needs, Lord, for this side of eternity.
[42:48] Because that's what your word says, that
[42:51] you will supply all of our needs
[42:53] according to your riches in Christ
[42:56] Jesus. Not the way that we would think
[42:58] about riches. And we're so thankful,
[43:00] Lord, that you know all things and that
[43:03] you have everything in your control.
[43:06] Tonight, Father, we just want to lift
[43:08] the needs that were made known unto you
[43:10] tonight by the wave and uplift hand.
[43:11] Father, oh Lord, I have my hand lifted
[43:15] as well, Lord Jesus. We all have needs.
[43:18] Father, tonight we just pray that you
[43:19] would meet those needs sovereignly.
[43:21] We're so thankful for your tender hand,
[43:24] Lord, leading us and guiding us all
[43:27] along the way, Father. And Lord Jesus,
[43:30] tonight we just want to remember the two
[43:32] names that were mentioned. Ellen Ebing,
[43:34] Lord, lady that needs a touch from you,
[43:36] Father, that has never come to know you
[43:38] and the power of your resurrection the
[43:40] way that we have, but Father, we just
[43:43] ask that somehow someway she could. And
[43:46] Father, we want to remember Sister Beth
[43:48] Vanderlass before your throne tonight as
[43:50] well, Lord, that you would just continue
[43:52] touching her. Father, we love you and we
[43:55] thank you. We just ask all these things
[43:57] now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[44:00] Amen. Amen. Thank you musicians once
[44:04] again. Thank you for the special sister
[44:07] Epha.
[44:08] Certainly wonderful to be in his
[44:10] presence. If you have your Bibles
[44:12] tonight, I'd like to read two
[44:13] scriptures. One from the book of Titus
[44:17] and another one,
[44:20] the book of Romans, chapter 1. Titus
[44:23] chapter 1 and Romans chapter 1. Pretty
[44:26] easy numbers to remember.
[44:35] Titus chapter 1,
[44:43] Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of
[44:48] Jesus Christ according to the faith of
[44:51] God's elect.
[44:53] Isn't that wonderful? the faith of God's
[44:56] elect and the acknowledging of the truth
[45:00] which is after godliness
[45:03] in hope of eternal life which God that
[45:07] cannot lie promised before the world
[45:10] began
[45:13] over in the book of Romans chapter 1
[45:18] verse 17
[45:23] Romans chapter 1 verse 17.
[45:27] For therein is the righteousness of God
[45:30] revealed from faith to faith,
[45:34] as it is written,
[45:37] the just shall live by faith. Amen.
[45:40] Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[45:42] Father, we're so thankful that we can,
[45:44] Lord Jesus, read your scripture, your
[45:46] word, your will by revelation tonight.
[45:49] Lord, not by knowledge revelation, but
[45:52] by your spirit revelation, Father. And
[45:55] tonight, we just ask humbly, Lord, that
[45:57] you would quicken this word to our souls
[45:59] one more time, Father, that you would
[46:02] break this bread of life to us. That you
[46:04] would teach us and lead us as we walk
[46:07] with you along the way. We love you and
[46:09] we thank you, Father. We just ask all
[46:11] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[46:13] pray. Amen. God bless you tonight. You
[46:16] may be seated.
[46:19] Just want to remember the communion
[46:21] service coming up this Sunday at 5:30
[46:23] p.m. I think we had it listed for six
[46:25] o'clock, but we've agreed to do them a
[46:28] little bit earlier so that we can get
[46:30] everyone in and get it finished and have
[46:33] some time for testimonies and then uh
[46:35] get on our ways. With the children still
[46:37] in school, it's uh certainly a little
[46:40] more convenient and Sunday's a pretty
[46:42] good day to just gather around the the
[46:45] word. So, Sunday, we want to remember
[46:48] the communion service. Did you enjoy the
[46:50] service last Wednesday with brother
[46:52] Joel?
[46:54] Um, they got home today, this afternoon,
[46:57] basically just before service. And uh I
[47:00] texted brother Joel early this morning.
[47:02] I thought maybe they had gone sooner,
[47:04] but uh they were just getting up and uh
[47:07] it was about 6:30 when I texted him.
[47:09] They were going to the airport. They
[47:11] stayed at the Best Western in Calgary
[47:13] here. So they drove from Calgary after
[47:15] they left us. They went out to B Lake
[47:18] Louise and then they went north through
[47:19] Jasper and then back around through
[47:21] Edmonton again and then drove back down
[47:24] the QE2 to Calgary and stayed the night
[47:26] last night. And uh they came out to
[47:29] their minivan in the parking lot to find
[47:31] that all of their luggage was stolen.
[47:34] They smashed the window and everything
[47:36] they had everything packed and ready to
[47:38] go. They just took the stuff they needed
[47:41] for last night into the hotel with them.
[47:44] And uh so yeah, it's a bit of a
[47:47] difficult thing. I said to him, "You
[47:50] must have uh you must have really
[47:52] annoyed the enemy
[47:54] being here talking the way you were." We
[47:57] had a wonderful time of fellowship and
[47:59] uh yeah certainly difficult with these
[48:03] things in life but uh the enemy is going
[48:07] about as a roaring lion and we know that
[48:09] the Lord has it all under control but
[48:11] certainly frustrating nonetheless when
[48:13] you feel violated that way and you lose
[48:16] all of your stuff. I hope there was
[48:18] nothing really um sentimental there but
[48:22] God knows what we need. We're certainly
[48:24] thankful for the the message last week.
[48:27] I really enjoyed it. And uh you know, we
[48:29] had some further conversation about it.
[48:32] And uh if anybody is interested, brother
[48:34] Joel, he uh w was very very connected
[48:38] with Voice of God Recordings and Brother
[48:41] Ferguson in Montreal and uh I think it's
[48:44] in Montreal. Is that right? And uh he's
[48:47] the voice of Voice of God in Canada for
[48:51] brother Joseph. uh brother Ferguson is
[48:53] and uh anyways that's kind of where
[48:55] brother Joel uh came from and he uh he's
[48:59] got a lot of stories and a lot to talk
[49:01] about when it comes to uh you know the
[49:03] things of the Lord in and around the
[49:05] message of the hour and uh we just had a
[49:08] wonderful time of fellowship. So if
[49:10] anybody's interested I could certainly
[49:12] connect you with him and uh I know he
[49:14] would love to have visitors come and see
[49:16] him. He has a fairly new church and the
[49:20] Lord has been very good to him as I
[49:22] think he mentioned. I wanted to mention
[49:24] something tonight that I have been
[49:26] working on and uh I'm sure that many
[49:28] here tonight are familiar with this
[49:30] book. Um if you're not, I would hope
[49:33] that we could get familiar with this
[49:35] book. Um going into the fall, I would
[49:39] like to begin a study of this book and
[49:41] uh the stuff that's inside it. And I
[49:43] know some people get shaky when you a
[49:47] book and uh it's just a collection of
[49:50] message quotes. It's not uh man's
[49:53] thoughts. It's not an interpretation of
[49:55] the message. It is just a collection of
[49:58] quotes about marriage, courtship, and
[50:00] dating. Brother Paul um Dirkson put this
[50:05] book together. It was on his heart. He
[50:06] had another brother help him, I think,
[50:08] in Arizona
[50:10] um put it together and it's a collection
[50:12] of quotes based on on that topic.
[50:14] marriage, courtship and dating. And uh I
[50:18] had always thought that it should be
[50:19] courtship, um marriage, courtship,
[50:22] dating and then marriage or courtship
[50:24] and uh uh I don't know what you'd call
[50:27] it, but I guess dating is a part of it.
[50:29] And uh anyways, he he indicated to me I
[50:32] had a real good conversation with him
[50:34] about this and where the inspiration for
[50:35] it came, etc., etc. I'll get into all of
[50:38] that later. Um but I have ordered two
[50:41] cases of these books. So we have a
[50:43] digital copy as well, but I think it's
[50:46] kind of good to have a book that you can
[50:48] actually touch. You don't have to have
[50:50] screen time to get into it. And uh I
[50:52] think it's a very important thing for us
[50:55] to understand um what the biblical
[50:57] principles are and what the message
[51:00] talks about. You know, brother Brandham
[51:01] taught in in the message about this. And
[51:04] you know, for those that don't know, I'm
[51:06] sure we all do know it, but um I'm just
[51:08] going to say it. Brother Brandham, he
[51:10] actually says in the message that he
[51:12] took the girls, the sisters on a Sunday
[51:15] and taught them about sex and he took
[51:18] the boys on another Sunday separately
[51:20] and did the very same thing. So this is
[51:22] not foreign to the message of the hour.
[51:24] All of the questions, all of the answers
[51:26] are in here if we're willing to take a
[51:28] look at it. And I think this will help
[51:30] us as we raise our children, as we live
[51:33] our lives. Even for adults, sometimes we
[51:36] can get into marriage and not have been
[51:38] taught certain things, certain
[51:40] principles, and we continually find
[51:43] ourselves coming up against a wall in
[51:45] our marriage and wonder why. And
[51:47] typically what happens is we start to
[51:49] think it's the other person, it's the
[51:51] other person, it's the other person. And
[51:53] what happens is we have this thing that
[51:55] we just don't seem to get past. And the
[51:58] Lord will continue to allow us to go
[52:00] through this trial, this little struggle
[52:03] in our marriage. And we could find the
[52:06] answer for it potentially in something
[52:08] like this in a study. And so I'm not
[52:11] going to say we're going to follow the
[52:12] teachings of brother Paul Dirkson. I
[52:14] would say never follow the teachings of
[52:15] any man. Right? And I would say even
[52:18] this never follow the teachings even now
[52:21] I'm going to say it of of brother Brham
[52:24] because he's going to say follow the
[52:26] teachings of Christ right he's going to
[52:28] say get into Christ. It's all about
[52:31] Jesus Christ. It is not about following
[52:33] a man. And for anyone to say that we
[52:35] need to follow specifically a man we're
[52:38] actually going to get out on a limb. Now
[52:40] we do follow a vindicated prophet. Don't
[52:42] get me wrong. Absolutely we do. But it's
[52:45] not about the vindicated prophet. And he
[52:47] would say so himself. He would say it's
[52:49] all about Jesus Christ. There's a way to
[52:51] do things. You know, we've talked about
[52:52] in the past, we've preached on it that
[52:54] there's a a way. There's a highway, but
[52:57] then there is a way in the middle of
[52:59] that highway. And it's a way of
[53:00] holiness. And that's what we want to
[53:02] teach on. That's what we want to
[53:03] actually bring the people towards. We
[53:06] want to encourage it. We want to hold it
[53:08] before our children's eyes continually
[53:11] when they go to bed at night, when they
[53:13] get up in the morning. That's what the
[53:15] word of God says, not just send Sundays
[53:17] and and Wednesdays. I say, "Lord, help
[53:19] me. We get busy, too. Maybe we don't
[53:21] have devotions enough, but maybe we
[53:24] could do it a little bit more." And as
[53:25] you begin to get into a study like this,
[53:27] as we know, like we did with the Church
[53:29] Hbook, it can actually really help us um
[53:32] have a direction and to continue down
[53:34] that road. So, there's a couple things
[53:36] that are going to happen in the fall and
[53:37] uh I'll just throw this out there as one
[53:39] of them. We want to really dig into this
[53:41] court uh marriage courtship and dating
[53:43] and get into that. And I also want to
[53:46] begin having youth services at the
[53:49] church. Now, this is brand new for
[53:51] everyone. I have talked to maybe one or
[53:54] two people who are going to be key
[53:55] individuals that help with this. And uh
[53:58] we're not going to diminish the youth um
[54:00] events that Brother Joel and Sister
[54:01] Crystal have. that's going to carry on
[54:03] exactly the way that they feel led to do
[54:05] it and have been doing it. Um, just
[54:07] excellent. We're certainly thankful for
[54:10] that. But we do want to actually create
[54:12] an opportunity for the youth to be able
[54:16] to get into a service atmosphere and
[54:19] actually engage the word in the church.
[54:24] And so, in every single aspect, I want
[54:26] to see this happen. So, we're going to
[54:28] create an environment for that to
[54:29] happen. And it's not just going to be um
[54:31] the children. The youth come in here and
[54:33] we get into a teaching and and brother
[54:35] Barry's going to come and address them.
[54:36] Really what I want to do is see a youth
[54:39] service. So someone playing the piano,
[54:43] someone maybe playing the coahhone,
[54:44] maybe someone on the bass guitar, maybe
[54:46] someone on the the other guitar, maybe
[54:48] someone on the organ, a song leader,
[54:51] youth, and then if someone feels I know
[54:53] someone already does, this is why I'm
[54:55] saying this. I know someone already does
[54:57] feel inspired to take a microphone and
[54:59] exhort the youth. So there's all these
[55:02] little gifts, call them little gifts
[55:04] because they're young now in our midst.
[55:07] They have to be here if the Lord should
[55:09] terry. We need to make an opportunity
[55:11] for them. Give them a space to actually
[55:14] express those gifts and not wait until
[55:17] someday maybe brother Barry moves on and
[55:21] now we're looking for someone else. we
[55:23] we we might only have might actually
[55:26] have the opportunity to have someone in
[55:28] our midst with that gift. So, um it can
[55:30] be musicians. If you feel led to play an
[55:33] instrument, please, I would like it if
[55:35] we could just reach out to me, let me
[55:37] know directly, speak to me, and uh I'll
[55:40] make sure that we make provision for
[55:42] this. So, we're going to do it on a
[55:43] Friday night. And I know it's a bit of
[55:45] an effort on a Friday night for uh
[55:48] parents with children, but uh we'll try
[55:50] and make a way. We'll try and carpool.
[55:53] We'll do everything we can to help make
[55:56] this work. And uh we'll just see what
[55:58] the Lord will do. Maybe it will start
[56:00] really small. Maybe we'll just come and
[56:01] sing a few songs and uh say a couple
[56:03] words and it'll be over. But the thing
[56:05] about this is I just want to
[56:07] overemphasize is this is for the youth.
[56:10] This is by the youth for the youth. It's
[56:13] not going to be um someone coming in
[56:16] here, one of the other ministers in the
[56:17] congregation. and God gave them a a
[56:20] something on their heart that they just
[56:21] need to give to the youth. It's not
[56:22] going to be like that. It's going to be
[56:24] for the youth, what the Lord puts on the
[56:26] youth's heart to bring to the other
[56:28] youth. So, um it's all brand new. So, if
[56:32] you think that I feel like I have it all
[56:34] figured out, I don't have it all figured
[56:36] out. I just know that I want to make an
[56:38] opportunity, create an opportunity for
[56:40] the the youth to actually express it.
[56:43] Now, I know there's probably one
[56:44] question on everyone's heart, uh
[56:46] especially the youth. uh what are the
[56:48] age limits? What are the age
[56:51] requirements or restrictions? Now,
[56:53] here's where it gets fun
[56:56] because I'm not going to say to anyone
[56:58] that you're too young.
[57:01] I'm going to say it this way. If you're
[57:03] old enough to sit mature
[57:06] and not need to be parented, then you're
[57:08] welcome to come. But if you're going to
[57:11] come and make a ruckus, then
[57:13] unfortunately, you're not ready yet. So
[57:16] if you feel mature enough to come, if
[57:18] you're young and you want to sit and you
[57:21] want to actually participate and take it
[57:23] seriously, then by all means, you are
[57:26] absolutely welcome to come. And that can
[57:27] be 3 years old, whatever it is. I'm not
[57:30] going to say what age.
[57:32] So I think it'll be a a tremendous
[57:35] opportunity for the youth to begin to
[57:38] express. And I I'm I'm really thrilled
[57:40] because I know there's gifts that I
[57:42] didn't even know about that I've been
[57:44] discovering. Some of the youth in here
[57:46] can play really play the music really
[57:49] well and it's just sitting there and
[57:51] it's they're not getting the
[57:53] opportunities to play during the main
[57:55] services. So, we want to give give them
[57:57] an opportunity to express the gift to
[57:59] let the Lord purge that branch, you
[58:01] know, and in whatever capacity it is.
[58:03] Maybe maybe one of the youth just wants
[58:05] to stand at the door and guard all the
[58:07] parents from coming in. You're certainly
[58:09] welcome to do that, whoever that is, if
[58:11] you have that that leadership on your
[58:13] heart. So, um, and if anybody has any
[58:15] suggestions for it, I'm certainly open
[58:17] to it. Like I said, this is all brand
[58:19] new, but we, uh, as a body just want to,
[58:22] like I said, create an atmosphere,
[58:24] create an environment to, to come
[58:26] together and and see the Lord manifest
[58:28] through the gifts in the body. Are you
[58:30] happy tonight?
[58:31] Um, please with uh both of the items
[58:34] that I've mentioned, if you have
[58:35] questions or or you'd like to have a
[58:38] conversation, I could say concerns, but
[58:40] I'm sure that there's always concerns.
[58:42] But if you want to have a conversation,
[58:43] please just reach out to me and we can
[58:45] uh certainly talk about it. I uh was
[58:48] really interested about the service last
[58:50] week and uh thought it was it was just
[58:53] just amazing to look at how uh
[58:57] how Luther was so sincere and and how
[59:01] deeds just don't work. We can have many
[59:05] wonderful works in our lives, many deeds
[59:07] that we do, many things that we bring
[59:09] and and and you know, they don't really
[59:12] matter at the end of the day if we don't
[59:13] have a completely consecrated heart to
[59:16] the Lord. And uh you know, we heard
[59:19] about it and and I'll say it this way,
[59:21] it's just been on my heart. Um, we heard
[59:24] about it at the marriage banquet that we
[59:26] had and I had never heard this before,
[59:29] but there was the story was a couple had
[59:32] come to marriage counseling and here
[59:34] they were in marriage counseling and and
[59:36] they're kind of bickering back and forth
[59:38] and and she says the guy's all upset and
[59:42] he says to the counselor and to his
[59:44] wife, "I never did nothing. I don't even
[59:45] know why we're here." And the girl says,
[59:47] "That's exactly right. You never do. You
[59:49] never do anything." and you wonder why
[59:52] we're here. That's exactly why we're
[59:54] here. Another example was uh he got
[59:58] upset, I think, or I don't know if it
[59:59] was the same guy or not, but he spent 75
[1:00:01] bucks on a bouquet of flowers and she
[1:00:03] doesn't even care. And that's exactly
[1:00:06] right. Sometimes deeds like that just
[1:00:09] don't matter. Sometimes people just
[1:00:12] maybe sisters don't really like flowers,
[1:00:14] but if we are are are continually going
[1:00:16] down that track, I just buy flowers all
[1:00:18] the time. I've got these deeds. I just
[1:00:19] show up with flowers all the time and
[1:00:21] it's flowers, showers with flowers all
[1:00:24] the time. What difference does it make
[1:00:26] if it doesn't do anything for her? She
[1:00:28] might do all kinds of different things
[1:00:30] for him and and he might not appreciate
[1:00:33] it. Maybe it's whatever it is. I don't
[1:00:36] really want to go too far down that road
[1:00:38] because I could get myself in trouble.
[1:00:40] But what I'm getting at is we can do a
[1:00:43] lot of different things and think we're
[1:00:45] actually making a difference when it's
[1:00:46] not making a difference at all. And
[1:00:49] that's in the natural in our
[1:00:51] relationships. How much more spiritually
[1:00:53] can that play out? How much more
[1:00:55] spiritually can that happen? And you
[1:00:57] know, we heard that I'd never heard that
[1:00:59] before that Martin Luther he he he tried
[1:01:01] sleeping a year a winter I think it was
[1:01:04] without a blanket just to prove a point
[1:01:07] just to suffer suffer hard a little bit
[1:01:09] just for the Lord just to prove that he
[1:01:11] really loves the Lord. But you know the
[1:01:14] one point that I had really highlighted
[1:01:16] from from last week is uh you know in
[1:01:18] talking about the the evolution of re
[1:01:20] revelation and and a divine exchange is
[1:01:23] what brother Joel had brought was the he
[1:01:27] had thought that religion talking about
[1:01:30] Adam he had thought that religion would
[1:01:33] save his relationship
[1:01:35] and you know just because we are in the
[1:01:38] message just because this is a message
[1:01:40] church just because we might tag
[1:01:42] ourselves to have a message religion per
[1:01:45] se. That ain't going to save our
[1:01:47] relationship.
[1:01:49] That ain't going to save our
[1:01:50] relationship. The only thing that will
[1:01:51] save our relationship is relationship.
[1:01:54] We have got to have a genuine, sincere,
[1:01:57] wholehearted conversion to Jesus Christ.
[1:02:01] A and that's the only way we're going to
[1:02:03] have any success. If we just come into
[1:02:05] say a marriage with a perception, hey,
[1:02:08] I'm in the message. I I know well God
[1:02:10] sent a prophet and I I've always
[1:02:12] believed that and it's going to be just
[1:02:13] fine and that's going to save my
[1:02:15] relationship. It ain't going to work. We
[1:02:17] could be heading for a real problem and
[1:02:20] that's why we have to know that we know
[1:02:22] that we have a real relationship with
[1:02:24] the Lord. But you know just deeds alone
[1:02:26] they won't cut it. They will not work.
[1:02:28] And and I love how he he mentioned that
[1:02:30] Martin Luther how sincere he was. And it
[1:02:33] became a little bit confusing, I think,
[1:02:35] the way that brother Joel mentioned this
[1:02:37] and and it really caused me to write a
[1:02:39] note right after this. He said, "The
[1:02:41] more sincere we become, the more likely
[1:02:43] we are to fall for a religion."
[1:02:48] And you know, I I think it's really
[1:02:49] good. It's really important. I'm going
[1:02:51] to dwell on this for a little bit
[1:02:52] because if it caused any confusion, I
[1:02:54] really want to try and fill in the
[1:02:56] potholes. maybe mill the road a little
[1:02:58] bit and and just get things leveled out
[1:03:00] and nice and smooth because how many of
[1:03:03] us want a religion tonight?
[1:03:06] Not one hand. Exactly. Right. I think
[1:03:09] this will be easier than I thought.
[1:03:11] Nobody wants a fig leaf, do we? We want
[1:03:14] a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[1:03:17] Sometimes we can be so sincere, but you
[1:03:20] know what brother Brandham said? We can
[1:03:21] be sincerely wrong.
[1:03:24] Sincerity is not what does it. It is all
[1:03:28] about relationship.
[1:03:29] And just because we're sincere,
[1:03:32] it doesn't mean almost anything.
[1:03:34] Sometimes we can be so sincere in the
[1:03:36] way we apologize, but if we don't change
[1:03:39] our behavior in our life, are we
[1:03:41] sincere? And have we really apologized?
[1:03:45] Have we really tried to make it better
[1:03:47] if we just keep acting the same way?
[1:03:51] I'm sorry, honey, that I did that. I'm
[1:03:54] so sincere the way I say it and and I'm
[1:03:56] I'm maybe I say it sincerely with tears,
[1:03:58] but then tomorrow I just do the same
[1:04:00] thing. Next week I do the same thing.
[1:04:02] Six months I do the same thing. Am I
[1:04:05] really sincere?
[1:04:07] We can be sincerely wrong.
[1:04:10] And you know, all of this discussion
[1:04:12] from last week, it really got me
[1:04:14] thinking right when he was preaching it.
[1:04:15] It it just really made me think about
[1:04:17] it. So, I I just brought up a quote in
[1:04:19] my mind and so I had to pull it up in
[1:04:21] the message and uh if you don't mind
[1:04:23] bringing it up. Did you get the email? I
[1:04:25] did get it out tonight. All right. I
[1:04:29] didn't leave my friends in the sound
[1:04:30] booth high and dry.
[1:04:33] It's out of the church age book and it's
[1:04:35] in the Sriian church age and it's
[1:04:37] talking about Polycarp.
[1:04:39] Remember Polycarp from that study and
[1:04:42] how sincere he was. Brother Brandham,
[1:04:43] he's talking about the the choosing of
[1:04:45] the actual messenger. how he was able to
[1:04:47] land on on on the choice of of the
[1:04:50] messengers for the age. He says in the
[1:04:53] messenger for this uh paragraph, using
[1:04:55] our God-given rule of choosing the
[1:04:57] messenger for each age, we
[1:05:00] unhesitatingly
[1:05:01] declare that Iranius was exalted by the
[1:05:05] Lord to that position. He was the
[1:05:07] disciple of that great saint and warrior
[1:05:10] of faith, Polycarp,
[1:05:13] excuse me. And it is no doubt,
[1:05:16] sorry, it's no doubt as he sat at the
[1:05:19] feet of that great man, he learned the
[1:05:21] Christian graces that flowed from his
[1:05:25] consecrated life. For Polycarp was one
[1:05:28] of the truly illustrious saints of all
[1:05:32] ages when viewed in the light of a
[1:05:34] blameless life.
[1:05:36] You will remember from your own reading
[1:05:39] that Polycarp was martyed. If you have
[1:05:42] the Fox's book of martyrs, you would see
[1:05:44] that. You'd be able to read all about
[1:05:46] him in that book. So that's where your
[1:05:49] own reading would come in, I'm sure. Too
[1:05:51] old to flee and too sincere a man to
[1:05:55] allow another to hide him and then
[1:05:58] suffer a penalty for doing so, he gave
[1:06:01] himself up to death. But before he did,
[1:06:04] he asked for and was granted permission
[1:06:07] to pray two hours for his brethren in
[1:06:10] the Lord, for the governor,
[1:06:14] for his enemies and his capttors.
[1:06:17] How many of us would do that?
[1:06:20] Like the great saints of all ages, and
[1:06:22] desiring a better resurrection, he stood
[1:06:25] firm, refusing to deny the Lord, and
[1:06:28] died with a free conscience. My, what a
[1:06:31] way to go.
[1:06:32] He was placed at the stake, untied at
[1:06:36] his own request, and the fire was lit.
[1:06:40] The fire bent away from his body,
[1:06:43] refusing to touch him.
[1:06:46] Imagine that. He was then pierced
[1:06:48] through with a sword. Sounds familiar,
[1:06:51] sort of, doesn't it? He was pierced
[1:06:53] through with a sword. As this was done,
[1:06:57] water gushed from his side,
[1:07:00] drowning the flames.
[1:07:02] Can you imagine what those people must
[1:07:04] have thought as they experienced this?
[1:07:08] Water gushed from his side, drowning the
[1:07:11] flames. His spirit was actually seen to
[1:07:14] depart in the form of a white dove
[1:07:17] released from his bosom. Yet for all
[1:07:20] this great testimony,
[1:07:22] this student of John the Revelator
[1:07:26] was not militant
[1:07:29] against the Nickelan system,
[1:07:32] for he himself leaned toward
[1:07:36] organization,
[1:07:38] not realizing that the desire for
[1:07:41] fellowship and what appeared like a good
[1:07:45] plan to foster the work of God was
[1:07:48] really a trick of the enemy.
[1:07:52] Remember brothers and sisters, the enemy
[1:07:54] is going to come and he is going to
[1:07:57] creep into the framework of the
[1:07:59] Christian church
[1:08:01] causing it to become lukewarm, formal
[1:08:04] and powerless. And how is that going to
[1:08:07] happen? Right here, right?
[1:08:11] Not being militant against the nickelan
[1:08:14] system. And what is the nickelan system?
[1:08:17] I'll say it in in layman's terms, kind
[1:08:20] of my way of talking. What that is is
[1:08:23] the leadership of man and not the
[1:08:25] leadership of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And
[1:08:28] it can be as simple as having a little
[1:08:31] church group and having voices in the
[1:08:34] background telling the pastor that it
[1:08:37] ought to be done this way or it ought to
[1:08:39] be done that way or we should do it the
[1:08:42] other way.
[1:08:44] Instead of saying we need the leadership
[1:08:46] of the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:47] getting together on the nights of the
[1:08:49] prayer meetings and saying, "These are
[1:08:50] the topics that we would like to pray
[1:08:52] about. Let's pray about these together
[1:08:54] for the leadership of the church." You
[1:08:56] know, brothers and sisters, it really
[1:08:57] struck me, like I said, at that little
[1:08:59] Baptist kids camp for a brother to get
[1:09:01] up there as a Baptist and say, "The only
[1:09:03] way forward for a church is on its
[1:09:06] knees. What if that whole entire
[1:09:09] church's success depended on you?"
[1:09:14] Woo.
[1:09:15] It really got my attention. It made me
[1:09:17] think, my
[1:09:19] Lord, help me. But I know we could say
[1:09:23] that's it's a Baptist church. It's a
[1:09:25] Baptist camp. It doesn't apply. Prayer
[1:09:29] applies. Prayer applies more than
[1:09:31] anything does. And you know what? this
[1:09:34] this antichrist spirit that will creep
[1:09:37] into the framework of the Christian
[1:09:38] church and cause it to become lukewarm
[1:09:39] and formal and powerless. Brother
[1:09:40] Brandham says it over and over and over
[1:09:42] again in this exposition of the seven
[1:09:44] church ages. This nickelan spirit that
[1:09:46] wants to get into the church and try and
[1:09:48] tell it how to run things. You know
[1:09:50] what? It can be as simple as a
[1:09:51] supernatural experience. We had a
[1:09:53] supernatural experience. We played that
[1:09:55] music before service. We actually had
[1:09:57] that song leader sing the song. He sang
[1:10:00] these songs and and so and so was on the
[1:10:02] piano. so and so was on the guitar and
[1:10:04] we had such and such deacon and and all
[1:10:06] these different things and you know what
[1:10:08] we need to do? We need to do that again
[1:10:09] next week because it was such a good
[1:10:10] service last week. As soon as we start
[1:10:13] to do that and say this is the way we
[1:10:15] make it happen, it's gone because we're
[1:10:18] putting a period behind the spirit of
[1:10:20] God. We need to allow him to move. It's
[1:10:23] got to be the freedom of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:25] moving in our service, in our in our in
[1:10:28] what we do here. every single time is
[1:10:32] going to be different and it will be
[1:10:34] different the way that he wants it to be
[1:10:35] which is so beautiful. We need to give
[1:10:37] him the opportunity to do that. But as
[1:10:39] soon as we actually say we've got this
[1:10:43] now we can actually do it our way and
[1:10:45] we're going to make it great.
[1:10:48] That's not the way it's going to work.
[1:10:49] It's a nickelan system. And you know as
[1:10:51] long as I'm here I'm going to preach
[1:10:53] against that because that nickelan
[1:10:54] system I can see it loud and clear now
[1:10:57] that we've studied that church age book
[1:10:58] the way that we did. That is what killed
[1:11:01] every single church age. That's where
[1:11:03] the the messenger had the message. But
[1:11:06] the spirit moved on. It went from one
[1:11:08] age to the next age to the next age. And
[1:11:10] here we are at the culmination of all
[1:11:12] the ages. Don't think for a second that
[1:11:14] that same exact nickelan spirit is not
[1:11:17] sitting here in this church tonight
[1:11:19] thinking that he's going to get a
[1:11:20] foothold. He ain't going to get a
[1:11:21] foothold. There's no room for that
[1:11:23] nickelan spirit here. Uh-uh. ain't going
[1:11:26] to happen because that nicicoatan spirit
[1:11:28] is an antichrist spirit. And you know
[1:11:30] what? Anything contrary to the word of
[1:11:32] God is antichrist.
[1:11:35] So let's just be clear about that. It's
[1:11:37] not a big raging monster. Alls it is is
[1:11:40] having our will and saying I will not
[1:11:42] succumb to the will of the word of God.
[1:11:45] I want to do it my way. And if we say
[1:11:47] that, that's Antichrist.
[1:11:51] That's how treacher it is. It
[1:11:52] treacherous it is. But anyways, this guy
[1:11:56] um Polycarp who was so sincere,
[1:11:59] he was not militant against this
[1:12:01] nickelan spirit. That was the downfall
[1:12:05] is what brother Brandham said in this
[1:12:07] book. It was the nicicoatan system. For
[1:12:09] he himself leaned towards organization,
[1:12:12] not realizing that the desire for
[1:12:14] fellowship and what appeared like a good
[1:12:16] plan to foster the work of God was
[1:12:18] really a trick of the enemy. outside of
[1:12:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, this will
[1:12:23] happen to us. We'll think we're doing
[1:12:25] things just right and we'll find out too
[1:12:27] late that it's just wrong.
[1:12:30] With Iranius, this was not so. He was
[1:12:34] militant against any form of
[1:12:36] organization.
[1:12:38] And that's where I say amen, brother,
[1:12:41] because I want to see it free in the
[1:12:43] spirit in here. Don't you? You want to
[1:12:45] see a worship service free in the
[1:12:47] spirit? Somebody gets inspired to play
[1:12:50] by the spirit. Would we want to say,
[1:12:52] "Uhoh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We've
[1:12:55] got an exact way that we like to do it
[1:12:57] here. Somebody wants to sing in the
[1:13:00] spirit in a special." No, no, no, no,
[1:13:03] no, no, no. You've got to be quiet. Make
[1:13:05] sure at the sound booth you turn them
[1:13:06] down. Keep them down. Don't get it too
[1:13:10] excitable in here. We can't do
[1:13:12] tambourine. Forget about it. Uh-uh. Not
[1:13:16] here. Not as not as long as I'm here.
[1:13:18] We're going to do all of the opposites
[1:13:20] to that. All of it. Because if it's a
[1:13:22] cultural barrier that's going to say
[1:13:24] that we can't do that, we can't sing and
[1:13:26] shout to the Lord, then we got something
[1:13:28] wrong. Why couldn't we sing and shout to
[1:13:29] the Lord in the spirit? Amen.
[1:13:33] We have to.
[1:13:35] So that's why I feel inspired tonight to
[1:13:37] just go down this road, brothers and
[1:13:38] sisters. It's important. Works ain't
[1:13:41] going to save us. Works ain't going to
[1:13:42] save our our church. works are not going
[1:13:45] to actually do anything for us except
[1:13:47] for give us a fig leaf. We're going to
[1:13:50] have a covering.
[1:13:52] Ianius was not with Iranius. This was
[1:13:55] not so. He was militant against any form
[1:13:57] of organization. Also, his life history
[1:14:02] wherein he served the Lord was one of
[1:14:04] much manifestation
[1:14:06] in the Holy Spirit. And the word was
[1:14:10] taught with unusual clarity and
[1:14:12] conformity to its original precepts. As
[1:14:15] I'm reading this, brothers and sisters,
[1:14:17] studying this, I'm thinking, Lord, have
[1:14:19] mercy. Help me to have something that
[1:14:21] would maybe be clear enough to encourage
[1:14:24] someone somewhere along the way that it
[1:14:26] would become a manifestation of the Holy
[1:14:28] Spirit where maybe, just maybe, it would
[1:14:30] be as simple as leaving a service and
[1:14:32] have someone say, "Brother Barry, do you
[1:14:34] know that we were just talking about
[1:14:36] that exact scripture?" And and you know,
[1:14:38] I'm seeing that happen and I'm I'm
[1:14:40] certainly thankful. I had a conversation
[1:14:42] with Sister Shelley when we preached
[1:14:43] about take up your cross. People might
[1:14:45] think, you know, Brother Barry and
[1:14:46] Sister Shelley had a a briefing before
[1:14:49] service that Sunday. We never talked.
[1:14:51] There's no discussion about that. But
[1:14:53] afterwards, I find out that's the
[1:14:55] scripture that the the Sunday school
[1:14:57] class took. You know, when I was in the
[1:14:59] world, I I I had a a man that worked
[1:15:01] with me and and he was a Jehovah's
[1:15:03] Witness. And uh I'm sure that the Lord
[1:15:06] has grace for me for my uh misbehavior
[1:15:10] towards him. I didn't treat him very
[1:15:11] well. And uh I know that I didn't and I
[1:15:16] don't know where he's at now. So I don't
[1:15:17] know if I'd even be able to apologize to
[1:15:19] him, but I know it's not him that I was
[1:15:21] foolish about. It was towards the Lord.
[1:15:24] And uh by his grace, I I think he knows
[1:15:27] my heart. Um, but anyways, this fellow,
[1:15:30] he told me the uh the Jehovah's
[1:15:33] Witnesses, they study and and present
[1:15:35] the exact same material all around the
[1:15:38] world within the same 24 hours.
[1:15:40] Everybody hears the exact same word. And
[1:15:42] and I remember being so fascinated by
[1:15:44] that, thinking how organized they are,
[1:15:46] how tremendously organized they must be
[1:15:49] to be able to do that because they're in
[1:15:50] every single country all around the
[1:15:52] world as far as I know.
[1:15:56] But how could they do that? How could
[1:15:57] they have these exact same sermon um
[1:16:00] titles and everything that they preach,
[1:16:02] the same material? And and you know, I I
[1:16:05] came in around the message and uh got
[1:16:07] around the dynamics of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:09] and come to realize it's the exact same
[1:16:11] thing for real without the communication
[1:16:14] of man. There's no technology involved.
[1:16:17] The only thing that's happening is it's
[1:16:18] the same spirit here as over here and
[1:16:21] over there and and over yonder. the
[1:16:23] exact same spirit that's just bringing
[1:16:25] forth the same word. So, it's
[1:16:27] interesting because you can see man's
[1:16:29] work uh trying to make it happen and and
[1:16:34] deposing the Holy Ghost in his ability
[1:16:37] to be able to make it happen on himself.
[1:16:39] It's it's such a strange thing. It's
[1:16:41] amazing to look at though. But this man
[1:16:44] here, he he
[1:16:46] was one of manifestation of the Holy
[1:16:49] Spirit. And I just can't help but think
[1:16:50] that would be what the the testimony
[1:16:52] would desire to be of every single
[1:16:55] believer, one with much manifestation of
[1:16:57] the Holy Spirit. And it's not all about
[1:16:59] speaking in tongues and laying on of
[1:17:01] hands and being able to speak to storms
[1:17:03] and speaking things into existence.
[1:17:05] Brothers and sisters, living a life with
[1:17:07] the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is
[1:17:09] just living according to the word of
[1:17:10] God. That is the hardest thing to do to
[1:17:13] stay in line with this word. I I think
[1:17:16] that is the most tremendous difficult
[1:17:18] thing there is for a human life to do is
[1:17:21] to conform. No, be transformed into a
[1:17:24] new creature that would be able to live
[1:17:26] this gospel.
[1:17:28] It's probably easier to speak a storm to
[1:17:31] go back to where it came from than to
[1:17:33] see a human being get completely
[1:17:36] transformed into a new creature. my and
[1:17:40] the word was taught with unusual clarity
[1:17:42] and conformity to its original precepts.
[1:17:46] That's where I just love the message of
[1:17:47] the hour because he just preached what
[1:17:49] Paul preached. Brother Brandham, you
[1:17:50] just said we just preach what Paul
[1:17:52] preached. That's it. We just want to
[1:17:53] keep it simple. We don't want to try and
[1:17:55] make it um too too technical. And a lot
[1:17:59] of people like it that way and and deep,
[1:18:02] but you know, uh I think if we get the
[1:18:04] Holy Ghost, we've pretty much got all
[1:18:06] the depth we need. We'll understand what
[1:18:07] the seals are. We'll understand what the
[1:18:09] horse riders are. We'll understand the
[1:18:11] history of the church. We'll understand
[1:18:13] the exposition of the seven church ages
[1:18:15] when we read it. But he taught it with
[1:18:18] unusual clarity and conformity to its
[1:18:20] original precepts. His churches in
[1:18:22] France were known to have the gifts of
[1:18:24] the spirit among them. For the saints
[1:18:27] spoke in tongues, prophesied, raised the
[1:18:29] dead, and healed the sick by the prayer
[1:18:31] of faith. He saw the danger of any kind
[1:18:35] of organized brotherhood among the
[1:18:37] elders, pastors,
[1:18:40] etc.
[1:18:42] So, Brother Barry is not just making
[1:18:44] this up. This is someone that actually I
[1:18:46] think this is in here for a purpose for
[1:18:47] us to understand that it's not just in
[1:18:50] the pastoral office. It's it's in the
[1:18:53] organization of the brotherhood amongst
[1:18:54] the elders. And you know, there's a
[1:18:56] balance to it, too, because we could say
[1:18:57] if there's any such thing as a program,
[1:18:59] we're just not going to have it because
[1:19:00] that's what Brother Brandham said. But,
[1:19:02] you know, there's there's there's
[1:19:03] different things that we have to have
[1:19:05] that are maybe a type of program. But
[1:19:07] here's the thing. This is where I will
[1:19:09] say this for sure that you know what,
[1:19:11] we're not interested in trading power
[1:19:12] for programs because that's what brother
[1:19:14] Brandham said. The church would do is
[1:19:16] trade their power for programs. But the
[1:19:19] programs that we be trading the power
[1:19:21] for is to let this take place where the
[1:19:24] the the program of the behindthe-scenes
[1:19:27] leadership is going to manipulate the
[1:19:29] way this church goes.
[1:19:31] That's the program that's going to take
[1:19:33] away the power because it no longer
[1:19:35] becomes a spiritledd church. It becomes
[1:19:38] a church led by men.
[1:19:42] And I just love it because brother
[1:19:44] Brandham, he said it, you know, you'll
[1:19:45] never denominate this
[1:19:50] Even though we talked about I don't know
[1:19:51] if we if brother Joel mentioned it last
[1:19:53] last uh Wednesday, but even though
[1:19:56] there's people that have tried and and
[1:20:00] are attempting to denominate the message
[1:20:02] of the hour and say that it's got to be
[1:20:04] done this way at this time and everyone
[1:20:06] does it, so it must be right and and
[1:20:09] it's not right just because everyone
[1:20:10] does it. We know that. We've talked
[1:20:12] about it many times. He stood solidly
[1:20:15] for a unified, spiritfilled, gift
[1:20:18] manifesting local church. And God
[1:20:21] honored him for the power of God
[1:20:24] manifested among the saints. And I just
[1:20:27] can't say enough, brothers and sisters,
[1:20:29] that's my desire. I'd like to see the
[1:20:30] power of God manifest in my life, and he
[1:20:32] does in in the way that I think he sees
[1:20:35] fit for it to happen. But my goal is to
[1:20:37] see the power of God manifest in your
[1:20:39] lives. That is my truest desire is just
[1:20:42] to see the the power of the resurrection
[1:20:45] of Jesus Christ come from the testimony
[1:20:48] services that we hold where where
[1:20:50] co-workers talk about it and neighbors
[1:20:52] talk about it and and you talk about all
[1:20:54] these different things that happen in
[1:20:56] your life. Not so much the supernatural
[1:20:58] but maybe the supernatural. It's up to
[1:21:00] the Lord for that to happen. He goes on
[1:21:03] to say he was also clear on his
[1:21:06] understanding of the Godhead. This I
[1:21:09] love because many times the Godhead
[1:21:12] doctrine can become so technical and so
[1:21:17] difficult to understand. We can we can
[1:21:19] take people and send them on a roundtrip
[1:21:21] journey talking about the godhead. And
[1:21:23] sometimes I feel like people like to do
[1:21:25] it in such a way that it makes them feel
[1:21:27] scholarly. It makes them sound
[1:21:29] scholarly. But I love the way he
[1:21:31] actually makes this explained here. And
[1:21:33] he he goes on and says, "And since he
[1:21:35] was the disciple of Polycarp, who in
[1:21:37] turn was the disciple of St. John, we
[1:21:39] can know for sure he had as perfect
[1:21:42] teaching as is possible on this
[1:21:44] subject." In volume 1, page 412 of the
[1:21:48] Anti Nyian Fathers, we have this
[1:21:51] statement by him on the Godhead. All
[1:21:54] other expressions likewise bring out the
[1:21:58] title of one. And the same being the
[1:22:02] Lord of power, the Lord, the Father of
[1:22:06] all, God almighty, most high, Creator,
[1:22:12] Maker, and such like. These are not the
[1:22:16] names and the titles of a succession of
[1:22:20] different beings,
[1:22:22] persons,
[1:22:24] but of one and the same. He pointed out
[1:22:28] clearly that these are but titles as is
[1:22:32] rose of Sharon, bright and morning star,
[1:22:35] fairest of 10,000, etc. Neither is there
[1:22:39] but one God. His name is Lord Jesus
[1:22:45] Christ.
[1:22:49] The Godhead. Amen.
[1:22:52] But sometimes it's just made so
[1:22:55] technical.
[1:22:57] I don't believe that he wants to be
[1:23:00] technical.
[1:23:02] Nobody can compare. Nobody's going to be
[1:23:04] able to match wits with with God. He
[1:23:07] holds the offices. It's his spirit in
[1:23:10] every one of them. He goes on to say,
[1:23:13] "Thus with his strict adherence to the
[1:23:15] word, his wonderful understanding of
[1:23:17] scripture, and the attendance of the
[1:23:19] power of God upon that ministry, he's
[1:23:23] the right choice for the age." It is
[1:23:26] altogether unfortunate that the other
[1:23:28] ages did not have in their messengers
[1:23:33] such a balance of fruit, power, and
[1:23:37] leadership in the Holy Spirit and the
[1:23:40] word. Can you imagine?
[1:23:44] I I just it just astounds me to think
[1:23:47] about that. Brother Brandham saying that
[1:23:50] that it's too bad that the rest of them
[1:23:52] just didn't have what he had, right?
[1:23:56] Going on with our discussion tonight,
[1:23:59] the just shall live by faith about what
[1:24:02] brother Joel was talking about last week
[1:24:04] and how Luther he he had the the 95
[1:24:09] thesis that he put up on uh on Halloween
[1:24:12] night, tacked it to the door and total
[1:24:15] defiance of what the church was doing. I
[1:24:18] I just think it's a wonderful thing. Who
[1:24:20] Who are the just? The just shall live by
[1:24:24] faith. This is where I wanted to get
[1:24:26] into, brothers and sisters. And you know
[1:24:28] the the concordance, it's uh G1342.
[1:24:33] It's equitable in character or act by
[1:24:36] implication, innocent, holy, absolutely,
[1:24:40] or relatively just, meat, righteous. The
[1:24:44] just
[1:24:46] shall live by faith. And that's G4102.
[1:24:51] It's persuasion in credence, moral
[1:24:54] conviction of religious truth or the
[1:24:58] truthfulness of God or a religious
[1:25:01] teacher especially reliance upon Christ
[1:25:04] for salvation
[1:25:06] abstractly
[1:25:08] consistency in such profession by
[1:25:12] extension the system of religious gospel
[1:25:16] truth itself assurance belief belief
[1:25:20] faith faith fidelity,
[1:25:22] the just, those ones, they're the ones
[1:25:26] that will live by faith. And sometimes I
[1:25:29] think this is taken and and and it's
[1:25:31] kind of mixed up. We can mix it up in
[1:25:33] our life and and we can we can start to
[1:25:36] say this in such a way that indeed it's
[1:25:38] true. The just, those ones who actually
[1:25:41] believe, who really, really give all
[1:25:44] that they have and not their money, not
[1:25:46] their time, all that they have, their
[1:25:48] heart wholly and completely to the Lord
[1:25:51] Jesus Christ. They have that kind of
[1:25:53] experience. Those are the just ones and
[1:25:55] they're going to live by faith. But you
[1:25:57] know what they're not going to do is not
[1:25:59] provide for their families. Sometimes
[1:26:02] the just will live by faith. The just
[1:26:04] shall live by faith. We can just say,
[1:26:06] you know, God's just going to give me a
[1:26:08] job and I know it's going to happen in
[1:26:10] my life and I don't have to do anything
[1:26:11] about it. Or I know that I'm going to do
[1:26:14] this and God's just going to make it
[1:26:16] happen in my life and and I don't have
[1:26:17] to do anything about it. We still have
[1:26:19] to get out of bed in the morning. We
[1:26:20] still have to live our lives. We still
[1:26:22] have to interact in this world. We can't
[1:26:24] just expect God to do it all for us. The
[1:26:27] children of Israel didn't just get
[1:26:29] picked up and set down in the promised
[1:26:31] land, right? They had to actually fight
[1:26:34] for every single inch. And brother
[1:26:35] Brandham says that we have to fight for
[1:26:37] every single inch of our promised land
[1:26:39] too. And that is getting into Christ,
[1:26:41] getting into the Holy Ghost, the true
[1:26:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I believe
[1:26:45] this with all my heart. When we get
[1:26:47] truly into the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:48] Ghost, then maybe we'll just move on and
[1:26:51] start talking about all kinds of
[1:26:52] different things. I I don't know. The
[1:26:55] Lord just keeps taking me back here with
[1:26:56] this. And uh you know, as we go, when we
[1:27:00] truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:27:02] it's going to be Mark 16 in action.
[1:27:04] Brothers and sisters, that's the word of
[1:27:06] God. It has to be that way. That's the
[1:27:08] pattern that's set out. And and that's
[1:27:10] what the word of God says. That's what
[1:27:11] the church age book says. It is Mark 16
[1:27:14] in action. He even says it in the church
[1:27:16] age book that all else is what?
[1:27:19] False. So we have to see Mark 16 in
[1:27:23] action in our church, in our lives. And
[1:27:25] I'm not saying that we're s searching
[1:27:28] seeking signs and wonders. I'm just
[1:27:30] saying that's the pattern. Where are we
[1:27:32] tonight?
[1:27:33] Where am I tonight? Am I dedicated
[1:27:36] enough to actually see the manifestation
[1:27:38] as we read about in in brother
[1:27:40] Ireanius's life? I say, 'Lord, help me.
[1:27:44] My in Romans 1:1 17, for therein is the
[1:27:49] righteousness of God revealed from faith
[1:27:53] to faith, as it is written, the just
[1:27:57] shall live by faith. I love it how when
[1:28:00] a prophet Paul speaking to the Romans
[1:28:03] will bring a word. He's not going to
[1:28:05] bring a new word.
[1:28:07] He's not going to bring something
[1:28:08] different. He's going to actually point
[1:28:09] back to what's already been said. That's
[1:28:11] the the the keystone. That's the
[1:28:13] hallmark for prophets in this world in
[1:28:16] which we live in. They're not bringing
[1:28:18] new words. They're pointing back to the
[1:28:20] word. Amen.
[1:28:24] And so, you know, I just can't help but
[1:28:26] think he he may have been talking about
[1:28:29] Habac in chapter 2, verse four. Behold,
[1:28:32] his soul which is lifted up is not
[1:28:34] upright in him, but the just shall live
[1:28:38] by his faith. Now, this is where it gets
[1:28:42] beautiful, brothers and sisters, because
[1:28:43] we're not looking, this is why we talk
[1:28:45] about the Holy Ghost. We're not talking
[1:28:46] about having faith in God. The Catholic
[1:28:49] Church has faith in God. The Pentecostal
[1:28:51] Church has faith in God. They all
[1:28:53] believe in God. But what we need is not
[1:28:56] faith in God. We need the faith of God
[1:28:59] in us. It's got to be God's faith living
[1:29:02] out through us. When it's God's faith
[1:29:04] living out through us, that's next
[1:29:05] level. That's when we get up and start
[1:29:08] walking down the road and saying, "Lord,
[1:29:10] what will you have me do today?" Not
[1:29:13] sitting on the couch at home saying,
[1:29:14] "Lord, I've put out a few e
[1:29:17] applications. will you please send me a
[1:29:19] job? No, we'll go and knock on doors.
[1:29:22] We'll get out of bed and we'll be going
[1:29:24] up and down the street saying, "Send me
[1:29:26] a job, Lord." And you know what? We'll
[1:29:28] bump into people and we'll talk to
[1:29:30] people and at the least expected moment,
[1:29:33] something will happen because we're
[1:29:35] marching forward. And and you know,
[1:29:37] that's in the natural. How much more in
[1:29:39] the spiritual? That's why we gather
[1:29:41] together on a Wednesday night. That's
[1:29:43] why we make the effort to go across the
[1:29:45] city or into the city. We do it because
[1:29:48] it's not our faith. It's his faith
[1:29:51] inside of us. In Galatians 3:1, but that
[1:29:55] no man is justified by the law in the
[1:29:58] sight of God. Nobody has perfect works.
[1:30:01] So just forget about it. All of the
[1:30:04] churchianity that we can muster up, it
[1:30:06] ain't enough, right? But that no man is
[1:30:09] justified by the law in the sight of
[1:30:11] God, it is evident, for the just shall
[1:30:14] live by faith.
[1:30:16] the just, those ones who are the
[1:30:19] upright, the ones that are already
[1:30:21] justified.
[1:30:23] But, you know, we're not looking for the
[1:30:24] faith of God. We're looking or the faith
[1:30:27] in God. We're looking for the faith of
[1:30:29] God. That is exactly what we're after,
[1:30:31] brothers and sisters. In in Hebrews
[1:30:33] chapter 10:35,
[1:30:36] "Cast not away therefore your
[1:30:38] confidence, which hath great recompense
[1:30:41] of reward.
[1:30:44] For ye have need of patience, that after
[1:30:47] ye have done the will of God, ye might
[1:30:50] receive the promise." Isn't that
[1:30:52] beautiful? That scripture there just
[1:30:53] just gives it to us. It spells it out.
[1:30:56] after ye have done the will of God, not
[1:30:58] the will of man, not not not God's will
[1:31:02] and my will intermingled together, a
[1:31:04] hybrid condition. It's after we have
[1:31:07] done the will of God, you might receive
[1:31:10] the promise. So, if we're outside of the
[1:31:12] word of God in any way of our lives, in
[1:31:15] anything that we're doing, how can we
[1:31:18] expect to see the promise come to pass
[1:31:19] in our life? If we want to see the
[1:31:22] things happen according to Mark 16 in
[1:31:25] action, we've got to put that word
[1:31:27] first. Absolutely unequivocally first.
[1:31:31] And unfortunately, even to the place
[1:31:33] where we've had the conversations, even
[1:31:35] if it takes our hide off of us, put that
[1:31:37] word first.
[1:31:39] Everything else becomes second.
[1:31:42] For ye have need of patience, that after
[1:31:45] ye have done the will of God, you might
[1:31:46] receive the promise. for yet a little
[1:31:49] while, and he that shall come will come
[1:31:52] and will not tarry. Now the just shall
[1:31:54] live by faith. But if any man draw back,
[1:31:57] my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
[1:32:00] And you know, this isn't just Paul
[1:32:02] talking to the Hebrews and Paul saying
[1:32:04] that my soul won't won't have any
[1:32:07] pleasure in him. We know that this is
[1:32:09] the word of God here being spoken in
[1:32:12] verse 39. But we are not of them who
[1:32:15] draw back unto pition, but of them that
[1:32:19] believe to the saving of the soul. And I
[1:32:22] think it's just so beautiful, brothers
[1:32:23] and sisters. What I'm talking about
[1:32:25] tonight is is not just the faith in God
[1:32:28] that when, you know, should something
[1:32:30] come our way, a calamity happen in our
[1:32:32] life where we have to actually expire in
[1:32:35] this flesh that we're just going to go
[1:32:37] on into glory and be saved. Sure enough,
[1:32:40] salvation is part of the dual covenant.
[1:32:45] But there's things that we need in our
[1:32:46] lives, and we we we prayed it earlier
[1:32:49] tonight. He will supply all of our needs
[1:32:51] according to his riches
[1:32:54] in Christ Jesus. But unless we're
[1:32:57] willing to put his word first, we can't
[1:33:00] hardly expect to see all of that
[1:33:02] manifest, the other part of that dual
[1:33:04] covenant in our life. And if we have
[1:33:06] anything missing,
[1:33:08] then we just need to go back and find
[1:33:11] it. We just need to put the pieces
[1:33:12] together and allow the Lord to be able
[1:33:14] to do it. Now, just just just for the
[1:33:16] record, I'm going to say it. I'm not
[1:33:18] saying I'm not trying to preach that we
[1:33:19] should be sign seekers. But at the same
[1:33:22] time, oughtn't we to be more surprised
[1:33:24] when our prayers aren't answered
[1:33:27] according to his word than when they are
[1:33:29] when we have a great tremendous miracle
[1:33:30] in our life. It gets us excited to see
[1:33:32] it. But, you know, we're believers here.
[1:33:34] Amen. That's why we have the testimony
[1:33:36] services. And you know, don't take it
[1:33:38] lightly for a second. When we have a
[1:33:40] testimony service, it's an opportunity,
[1:33:43] I would say it, I have in the past, I'll
[1:33:44] say it again, to give the devil a black
[1:33:46] eye to tell them, "No, it's not a God of
[1:33:49] William Brandham in prayer lines back in
[1:33:52] the 60s." And it's not going to be in
[1:33:53] the millennium. It's right here and now.
[1:33:55] Mark 16 in action is his church. And I'm
[1:33:58] so glad that I can say I'm one of them.
[1:34:01] Amen.
[1:34:02] not looking for it in the future. Not
[1:34:05] not not looking back to the past and
[1:34:07] just ignoring what's going on. No, I'm
[1:34:11] actually a partaker of it. He He's
[1:34:13] actually living out through me. It it's
[1:34:16] his life living out through me. We'll
[1:34:19] probably get into a bit of that on
[1:34:20] Sunday. He talks about it. The word
[1:34:23] becoming flesh and flesh becoming the
[1:34:27] word. So, who who are we really? You
[1:34:31] know, when uh we call ourselves the
[1:34:32] bride of Jesus Christ, I I can say
[1:34:35] there's Mrs. Johnson right there. And
[1:34:38] and you know, if she were to take the
[1:34:40] official title, it wouldn't be Mrs. Lisa
[1:34:43] Johnson. It would be Mrs. Barry Johnson.
[1:34:47] It's interesting how that works. I
[1:34:48] remember I was fascinated as a child
[1:34:50] when I saw that the first time.
[1:34:54] Why is it that way? It's the way that
[1:34:56] God intended it for it to be or it
[1:34:58] wouldn't be that way. But it's what he
[1:35:00] intends for his bride. Amen. Mrs. Jesus
[1:35:04] Christ
[1:35:06] and the invisible union of the bride of
[1:35:08] Jesus Christ.
[1:35:10] You brother Bradomy talks about it.
[1:35:13] We've got a few minutes, so I'm just
[1:35:14] going to go back a little bit. I've said
[1:35:16] this many times in the past, been a long
[1:35:18] time, so I figured I would probably be
[1:35:19] safe to say it again tonight. You know,
[1:35:21] in in paragraph 263 of the invisible
[1:35:24] union, if you were to just go back
[1:35:25] further from where I actually sent you
[1:35:27] that quote, if you're going into the
[1:35:28] message, if not, it's okay. Brother
[1:35:30] Brandam, he says, "You're standing
[1:35:31] completely justified." Remember, the
[1:35:33] just shall live by faith. You are
[1:35:36] standing completely justified as though
[1:35:38] you never did it. This message is the
[1:35:41] invisible union of the bride of Jesus
[1:35:43] Christ. And I say this, I'll say at the
[1:35:45] beginning of this, the invisible union
[1:35:47] of the bride of Jesus Christ. It's not a
[1:35:50] fig leaf.
[1:35:51] It's not an opportunity for us to say,
[1:35:53] you know what, the the relationship that
[1:35:54] I've got with Jesus Christ, it's just
[1:35:56] invisible.
[1:35:58] You can't see it. No, you can't see it.
[1:36:01] But you bear fruit that shows it. Our
[1:36:04] lives bear record. It is very visible
[1:36:08] when we've had this invisible union
[1:36:11] because we don't have two fleshes coming
[1:36:14] together to be one like we do in this
[1:36:16] world where husband and wife come
[1:36:18] together, right? But yet something
[1:36:21] happens supernaturally. There is an
[1:36:24] invisible union. But it bears record in
[1:36:26] our flesh because we're no longer the
[1:36:28] same person. We're no longer the same
[1:36:31] creature. All of the things that used to
[1:36:33] control us have no power over us
[1:36:35] anymore. You are standing completely
[1:36:38] justified. The just shall live by faith
[1:36:42] as though you never did it at the
[1:36:45] beginning. This is my message to the
[1:36:47] church. Now, as you know, as we go off
[1:36:49] the air just in a minute, you are
[1:36:52] standing. If you're standing on God's
[1:36:54] word and with God's word, every amen,
[1:36:59] every jot, every tit,
[1:37:02] where are you standing? I'm trying to
[1:37:04] tell you, pull away from them shucks.
[1:37:07] And you know, he's talking about
[1:37:08] denominations, denominational thinking.
[1:37:11] Pull away from them things. Pull away
[1:37:13] from all those things. You know, I grew
[1:37:14] up in a Pentecostal church and when I
[1:37:16] came around the message of the hour, I
[1:37:18] thought that I had a little bit of an
[1:37:19] understanding and I did have a little
[1:37:21] bit of an understanding. A little bit,
[1:37:23] tiny bit, teeny weeny. But, you know,
[1:37:26] there was times where I would hear
[1:37:27] brother Brandham come contrary to the
[1:37:29] teaching that I had as a kid. And you
[1:37:31] know, when he did that, I had the choice
[1:37:33] to say, I'm just going to take that with
[1:37:35] a grain of salt and I'm just going to
[1:37:38] put it off to the side and not really
[1:37:40] know what to do with it. I'm just going
[1:37:41] to push it over here and, you know, just
[1:37:43] not really look at it. I I did that a
[1:37:45] time or two, but then I came to the
[1:37:47] place where I realized, listen, man, if
[1:37:49] if you're going to actually do this, you
[1:37:51] better do it all. You better set
[1:37:53] everything that you think you know off
[1:37:55] to the side instead of setting the stuff
[1:37:58] that's coming to you as a teaching as
[1:38:00] the fruit of the spirit and actually
[1:38:03] just set it all aside and just allow God
[1:38:05] to wash you by the water of the word and
[1:38:08] see if it doesn't add up according to
[1:38:10] his word. And you know what brothers and
[1:38:11] sisters, as soon as I did that, things
[1:38:13] changed for me spiritually dramatically,
[1:38:16] exponentially changed for me. And I can
[1:38:18] say the same thing. If you want to see
[1:38:20] that happen in your life, just be
[1:38:21] willing to say, even though I grew up in
[1:38:23] a message church and I've got an idea
[1:38:25] that it should be this way, just maybe
[1:38:27] say for a second, let me step back. Let
[1:38:29] me take brother Barry's challenge for a
[1:38:31] second and just see if God won't
[1:38:32] actually reveal himself to me just a
[1:38:34] little bit differently than he did to
[1:38:36] mama or dada. Because it's not for them,
[1:38:39] it's for you.
[1:38:42] We've got to be willing to set aside all
[1:38:44] that we think we know. But if we're not
[1:38:46] willing to do that, we're just going to
[1:38:48] be stuck. We're gonna actually find
[1:38:50] ourselves in a position where we've got
[1:38:52] a religion.
[1:38:55] Brother Brandham says, "I'm trying to
[1:38:56] tell you, pull away from them shucks.
[1:38:58] Pull away from all of that
[1:39:00] denominational thinking, all of that
[1:39:02] traditional stuff. Push it away and let
[1:39:04] God reign in our lives." And he says,
[1:39:07] "And get out here in the wheat where you
[1:39:09] can get right before the sun. I hear the
[1:39:12] comment of the combine. You're standing
[1:39:14] complete, justified, like you never did
[1:39:18] it in the first place. Hallelujah. And
[1:39:20] if you listen to this, I highly
[1:39:21] recommend it. He gets a real excited
[1:39:23] here. He says, "Talk about a
[1:39:24] thanksgiving." This is his Thanksgiving
[1:39:26] message. I feel real good. I'm more
[1:39:28] thankful for that than anything I know
[1:39:30] of. You are the pure, virtuous, sinless
[1:39:34] bride of the son of the living God.
[1:39:37] Every man and woman that's born of the
[1:39:40] spirit of God and washed in the blood of
[1:39:42] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[1:39:46] God stands as though you never sin at
[1:39:50] the first place. You are perfect. Amen.
[1:39:55] Amen. Now, I wasn't sure whether this is
[1:39:57] the direction to go, but I hear brother
[1:39:58] Paul pray that prayer tonight.
[1:40:03] I'm like, "Amen." in the office tonight.
[1:40:06] This is the quote that I wanted to get
[1:40:08] into. I better I better hyper down here.
[1:40:10] Sorry. Just gets me so excited to think
[1:40:12] about this. The just shall live by
[1:40:14] faith. Not the faith in God, but the
[1:40:17] faith of God literally living out
[1:40:19] through them. My he goes on to say, "Oh,
[1:40:23] that spiritual union of Christ and his
[1:40:25] church." Now, now when we read this,
[1:40:28] remember the prophet said he was told to
[1:40:30] go and store up food for a season,
[1:40:32] right? He was putting grain in the
[1:40:35] granary
[1:40:36] so that David could come and take it,
[1:40:40] you know. Anyways, here we have brother
[1:40:42] Brandham. He's saying this. Don't go
[1:40:43] back and say, "Well, that was Christ in
[1:40:46] his church now in 1965." Don't do that.
[1:40:49] Make it real tonight. 2025 Calgary
[1:40:52] Living Word Assembly, Brother So and So,
[1:40:54] Sister So and So, us right here and now.
[1:40:58] and his church now when the flesh is
[1:41:01] becoming word and the word is becoming
[1:41:03] flesh manifested
[1:41:06] vindicated
[1:41:08] not just me saying oh man I I know that
[1:41:10] I can say that I'm one of them it's the
[1:41:12] word becoming flesh in my flesh can't
[1:41:14] you see it look at this beautiful shirt
[1:41:16] that I think I got you know can't you
[1:41:18] see it it's the word becoming flesh you
[1:41:21] know talk is cheap yes how do we live
[1:41:25] what will what will I think we've heard
[1:41:27] brother Gilbert say What will our
[1:41:28] enemies say about us? What will our
[1:41:31] spouses say about us? What will our
[1:41:33] children say about us? Who are you
[1:41:36] behind closed doors? Because that's who
[1:41:38] you really are. And you know, if you
[1:41:39] you're not sure, just add a little bit
[1:41:41] of pressure to that person behind closed
[1:41:44] doors. And then the truth comes out.
[1:41:46] Now, I say that Lord, help me. My family
[1:41:49] will look at me and say, "Yeah, brother
[1:41:51] Barry, remember two weeks ago? Yeah, I
[1:41:53] remember it better than you."
[1:41:55] Unfortunately, you don't forget those
[1:41:57] things and you feel like an idiot. But
[1:42:00] you know what? We can learn from them
[1:42:02] and we can change from them. And if
[1:42:03] we're willing to do that, then we're
[1:42:05] willing to grow. But if we just keep
[1:42:08] doing the same thing over and over
[1:42:09] again, we know that's the definition of
[1:42:10] insanity. But here, I want to encourage
[1:42:12] us tonight, brothers and sisters, don't
[1:42:14] look at this flesh. Look at the word.
[1:42:16] Just be willing to submit ourselves to
[1:42:18] the word of God and and realize that
[1:42:20] he's talking about us here, his church.
[1:42:23] Now, when the flesh is becoming word,
[1:42:24] and the word is becoming flesh,
[1:42:26] manifested, vindicated, just what the
[1:42:29] Bible said would happen in this day,
[1:42:32] it's happening day by day.
[1:42:35] Not just in brother Brandham's day,
[1:42:36] right here, today. Why? It's culminating
[1:42:41] so fast out there in those deserts and
[1:42:43] things taking place that I couldn't keep
[1:42:45] even keep up with it. We're near the
[1:42:47] coming of Jesus to be united with his
[1:42:50] church where the word becomes the what?
[1:42:56] Brothers and sisters, we might not even
[1:42:59] make it till morning.
[1:43:02] You know what's going on in the world.
[1:43:04] We all know what's going on in the
[1:43:06] world. This world is not our home. It
[1:43:09] has never been as far down the road as
[1:43:12] it is right now. Amen. There's many
[1:43:15] people that have said there's there's
[1:43:16] World War II, it's already underway and
[1:43:18] it's got to do with the Pope and
[1:43:19] everything and everything, but here we
[1:43:21] have literally just about boots on the
[1:43:23] ground, planes in the air.
[1:43:27] We all know where we are.
[1:43:30] We're near the coming of Jesus to be
[1:43:32] united with his church where the word
[1:43:35] becomes the word.
[1:43:38] Call of the Holy Spirit searching the
[1:43:41] hearts.
[1:43:42] This is the part I wanted to get to
[1:43:44] tonight, brothers and sisters. I'll call
[1:43:45] them musicians as I as I close here. He
[1:43:48] says, "You're standing completely. You
[1:43:50] never sinned at the first place. It's
[1:43:52] not even like you never did it. You
[1:43:54] never did it." He says here, "You're
[1:43:57] standing completely. You never sinned at
[1:43:59] the first place. God, don't even know
[1:44:03] nothing." It's in the sea of
[1:44:04] forgetfulness. You never did it. You
[1:44:07] were accused of it by the accuser. And
[1:44:09] we know the accuser is still standing
[1:44:11] there right now trying to accuse us.
[1:44:16] But any one of these days we're going to
[1:44:18] go right up where he is and he's going
[1:44:21] to come down. Just like lightning.
[1:44:24] But really from the beginning you were
[1:44:26] predestinated to be a son or daughter of
[1:44:29] God.
[1:44:31] You were predestinated to be a son or
[1:44:33] daughter of God. are standing there
[1:44:34] washed and your old book of divorcement
[1:44:38] is put away and it's dead absolutely out
[1:44:42] of existence even in the mind of God. He
[1:44:45] says, "You're the virtuous bride of
[1:44:48] Christ, washed in the blood of Christ.
[1:44:50] Precious, virtuous, sinless son of God,
[1:44:53] standing with the pure, unadulterated
[1:44:56] bride word." Hallelujah. Bride word that
[1:45:01] he washed by the water of his own blood.
[1:45:06] That's why just take Jesus being God out
[1:45:09] of the equation and all of this. It's
[1:45:11] just like a a tire. You pop and and it
[1:45:13] just
[1:45:15] It just goes flat because if Jesus
[1:45:18] wasn't God, it's over. We're wasting our
[1:45:22] time. Maybe stand with me as we close.
[1:45:26] That became flesh and manifested that he
[1:45:29] might take you which were predestinated
[1:45:32] in the bosom of the father before the
[1:45:34] beginning.
[1:45:35] The same as he was. He was that great
[1:45:39] attribute of God called love. Whatever
[1:45:42] you are,
[1:45:44] whatever you are, you are servants of
[1:45:48] God. Whatever God wants you to do, where
[1:45:52] your place is,
[1:45:54] God placed in the church some apostles,
[1:45:57] prophets, teachers, pastors, he placed
[1:46:00] that by virtue of his own
[1:46:03] predestination.
[1:46:07] And you were that to begin with.
[1:46:10] Every one of us has a role to play.
[1:46:12] Brothers and sisters,
[1:46:15] just accept that word, that word as the
[1:46:19] absolute and it will change everything.
[1:46:22] God bless you tonight. Let's just bow.
[1:46:25] Heavenly Father, Lord, we love you
[1:46:27] tonight. We thank you for your word.
[1:46:29] Thank you, Father, for sending us a
[1:46:32] dedicated prophet, Lord.
[1:46:34] Thank you, Lord Jesus, that we can
[1:46:36] recognize that there is a dual covenant.
[1:46:40] It's for the healing of our bodies and
[1:46:41] the saving of our souls, Lord.
[1:46:45] Father, help us as we go forwards
[1:46:47] tonight and through the rest of this
[1:46:49] week, Lord, as we consider what we're
[1:46:52] doing with our lives and where we're
[1:46:54] going and what we do on a day-to-day
[1:46:57] basis. Lord, help us to consider that
[1:47:00] word
[1:47:01] becoming in our flesh. A and and help us
[1:47:05] recognize that in our flesh,
[1:47:08] we can see that word becoming manifest
[1:47:11] as well. Lord, help us to consider
[1:47:15] discerning the Lord's body on Sunday.
[1:47:17] Lord, as we come to the communion table,
[1:47:21] Father, help us, Lord Jesus, to come
[1:47:24] with sincere hearts, Lord. Oh, Father,
[1:47:26] tonight I just want to pray that Lord,
[1:47:29] perhaps there would be some sincere
[1:47:30] hearts that would actually come to the
[1:47:33] communion table, Lord, that don't
[1:47:36] normally. Help us, Lord, to draw close
[1:47:39] to you. Father, your word says that if
[1:47:41] we draw nigh unto you, that you will
[1:47:43] draw nigh unto us. Help us, Lord Jesus.
[1:47:47] Tonight, we just love you and we thank
[1:47:49] you. We just commit all the words that
[1:47:50] were spoken into your hands now, Father,
[1:47:52] into your children's hearts, Lord. Help
[1:47:55] us, Father, to go forwards with your
[1:47:57] leadership in this church. Let it be
[1:47:59] your spirit and your spirit alone,
[1:48:01] Father, that leads us. We love you and
[1:48:04] we thank you. We ask all these things
[1:48:06] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:48:09] Amen. Amen. Can we sing 11:32?
[1:48:12] We cry out your name.
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:20] Father of life, seated on your throne of
[1:48:26] grace.

[1:48:37] You have said if we call upon your name,
[1:48:45] Amen.
[1:48:48] could be saved.
[1:48:52] So we can cry
[1:48:56] out your name.
