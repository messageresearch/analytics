[8:52] in our our our [music] own lives.
[8:55] Father, we've come here this evening to
[8:57] be washed by the water of your word,
[8:59] Lord. Not come to stir up an emotion
[9:02] that's that's outside of your word, but
[9:04] Lord, we know that stimulation comes
[9:06] with revelation. Father, if there's
[9:08] something that stimulates us, we can't
[9:10] help but say yes, Lord. That's nothing
[9:12] but the truth. Amen to that word. Lord,
[9:15] help us, Lord, just to have the freedom
[9:16] here tonight. Lord, if there's any place
[9:19] a believer should be able to feel
[9:21] relaxed and at home and free as amongst
[9:23] brothers and sisters in a in a in a
[9:25] church assembly like this, help us,
[9:27] Lord. Forgive us, Lord, of [music] of
[9:30] lukewarmness that might creep in, Lord,
[9:32] or s spirit of this world that may be
[9:34] attached itself to us. Lord, we just
[9:36] come against every unclean spirit
[9:38] tonight and cast it away in the name of
[9:40] the Lord Jesus Christ that you may have
[9:42] liberty that you may have freedom here
[9:44] tonight. Lord, we've come to be changed
[9:47] from glory to glory. May your word have
[9:49] that effect on us. Lord, we've come here
[9:51] for correction. We've come for here for
[9:54] encouragement. [music]
[9:54] Lord, whatever it is, Lord, that you
[9:56] would have for each individual, Lord. We
[9:58] say it often, Lord. It's like a one room
[10:01] schoolhouse, but Lord, you're the great
[10:03] God of the universe. You know what every
[10:05] need is and you can take one man, one
[10:07] ministry, one pastor and and meet the
[10:10] needs of every single sheep here just
[10:12] with a nugget here, a thought there, a
[10:15] quote here, Lord, that would just
[10:16] encourage every one of us wherever we
[10:19] are in our journey, Lord. We know that.
[10:21] We we love you for that, Lord. We love
[10:23] you, Lord, for how you talk to us
[10:25] individually like that. And we ask you,
[10:27] Lord, tonight, would you come by our
[10:29] way, Lord? Would you walk every aisle,
[10:31] Lord? Would you sit beside us in our
[10:33] seats, Lord? Would you put your arm
[10:35] around us, Lord, and commune and
[10:37] fellowship with us? We desire to serve
[10:39] you, [music] Lord, more than in 2026
[10:42] than we did this year, Lord. As we we we
[10:45] come to the end of this year, Lord, we
[10:47] just want to love you more, Lord. We
[10:49] want you to open the eyes of our hearts
[10:51] to understanding, Lord. Father, to be
[10:53] more mature, adopted sons and daughters
[10:56] of God. Lord, we know that when that
[10:58] bride finally realizes who she is and
[11:01] what it is, we'll be we'll be taken from
[11:03] this earth. We'll we'll be caught up
[11:05] together with those that have come forth
[11:07] from the grave, we'll we'll we'll meet
[11:08] you in the clouds, Lord. We'll crown you
[11:10] the King of Kings. Lord, what a glorious
[11:13] day awaits us. But Lord, as we gather
[11:15] here tonight, may we just remind one
[11:18] another [music] of how great you are
[11:19] through our singing. May we just raise
[11:21] the worship before you, May, and may we
[11:24] receive the word as it comes forth. We
[11:26] pray tonight. Grant these mercies we ask
[11:28] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus.
[11:30] We ask these mercies. Amen. Amen. We
[11:33] ever cease tonight.
[11:38] Marvelous, marvelous grace. We were
[11:41] talking around the dinner table about
[11:43] the grace of God. Our pastor brought
[11:44] that that question and the answer about
[11:47] why the Jews are blinded. And we said
[11:49] it's grace. That's what [music] he
[11:50] brought to us. And we know it's grace
[11:51] this evening. This song kind of sums it
[11:54] up. first, third, and fourth verse of

[31:49] You're worthy of [music] it all.
[31:57] Lord, from you are all [singing] things
[32:00] [music]
[32:01] and to you are all things.
[32:05] You deserve the glory.
[32:09] One more time. [singing]
[32:11] [music] You are worthy of it.
[32:19] You are worthy of [singing] it all.
[32:22] [music]
[32:26] Lord, from [singing and music] you are
[32:29] all things
[32:30] and to you are all things.
[32:34] You deserve [music]
[32:36] the glory.

[32:49] thee.
[32:52] [music] Oh, we
[32:54] exalt
[32:56] thee.
[32:58] [music]
[32:59] Oh, we [singing]
[33:01] exalt
[33:03] thee.
[33:07] [music and singing] Oh Lord,
[33:13] [singing] is we [music] exalt.
[33:19] [music]
[33:20] Glory,
[33:24] [singing]
[33:28] glory, [music and singing]

[33:36] Oh [music]

[33:40] tonight. Percussion only. Oh yes, we
[33:43] [singing and music]
[33:44] exalt
[33:47] thee.
[33:50] We exalt [music]
[33:53] [singing]
[33:54] thee.
[33:57] We [singing]
[33:59] exalt
[34:01] thee. [music]
[34:05] Oh, [singing]
[34:08] I capell. Oh yes.
[34:12] [singing]
[34:13] [music]
[34:19] We [music] exalt [singing]
[34:23] thee.
[34:26] Oh, we [singing]
[34:27] [music] exalt
[34:30] thee.
[34:33] Oh
[34:35] Lord, everyone now as our pastor comes.
[34:38] Oh [singing] yes,
[34:40] we [music]
[34:42] exalt
[34:44] thee. [music] Oh,
[34:48] we exalt.
[34:52] [music]
[34:54] Oh, [singing]
[34:55] we
[34:57] exalt.
[35:02] [music]
[35:07] Oh yes, [singing] we [music]
[35:10] are exe.
[35:16] [singing]
[35:17] [music]
[35:26] [music]
[35:32] [singing and music]
[35:39] I [music] exalt. [singing]
[35:47] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music]
[35:54] [music and singing]
[35:57] Heat.
[36:00] [music]
[36:02] Heat.
[36:06] [music]
[36:12] [singing] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[36:17] [music and singing]
[36:23] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:24] &gt;&gt; I
[36:32] [music]
[36:33] [singing]
[36:36] amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to
[36:38] the house of the Lord. If you have a
[36:41] need tonight, maybe just make it [music]
[36:43] known unto him by way of an uplift hand
[36:46] as we go to him in prayer. Just like to
[36:49] remember Sister Tina. She's requested
[36:53] prayer. [music] She has the flu. She
[36:55] didn't actually request prayer, but she
[36:58] told me that she has the flu. And I told
[36:59] her we'd pray for her. I also like to
[37:02] remember my nephew Zach Natarak. He's
[37:04] got pneumonia in the hospital and his
[37:07] [music] family also. Let's just bow.
[37:10] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, there's no
[37:12] greater privilege on this side of
[37:15] eternity than to exalt you, [music]
[37:17] Lord.
[37:19] And Father, what an honor and a
[37:21] privilege it is to [music] be able to
[37:22] gather together in your name to do so.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that we could just strip
[37:28] off all of our humanity, Lord.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, that we could get beside
[37:33] ourselves tonight, Lord,
[37:36] &gt;&gt; and just invite you, Father, to minister
[37:38] to us in a way maybe like you never have
[37:40] before.
[37:43] Father, we have many needs in our
[37:45] [music] lives, many situations, Lord,
[37:47] that we cannot even understand.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; But Father, we know that you're in
[37:52] control or you're not God.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that you are. You
[37:58] are seated on your throne.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; And nothing can move that.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that you are the
[38:04] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Father, we just invite you to
[38:09] meet each and every need that was made
[38:10] known unto you tonight, Lord, by the way
[38:12] of an uplift hand.
[38:15] Father, whether it's someone present
[38:16] with us here in this building with you,
[38:19] or Father, someone tuning in somewhere
[38:22] [music] else, we pray that you would
[38:23] minister to that need, Father.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Sovereignly, Lord, and we'll be careful
[38:27] to give you the praise, Lord. We will
[38:30] not be like the other nine lepers
[38:32] running away with our healing. we will
[38:34] come back and thank you, Father,
[38:36] specifically for that request. Oh,
[38:39] heavenly father, tonight we want to
[38:40] remember Sister [music] Tina, Lord,
[38:42] who's down with the flu. We pray that
[38:44] you would touch her, that you would
[38:46] raise her up in the name of Jesus.
[38:47] [music] Father, one more time, we ask
[38:49] that you would come on the scene for
[38:51] Zach Natarak, Lord, in the hospital, the
[38:55] Foothills Hospital, Lord, with
[38:56] pneumonia.
[38:58] Father, we know that you're more than
[38:59] able. We pray that you would be with my
[39:01] sister Kelly [music] and her husband
[39:03] Brad. Oh, and his mom Betty. Oh, father
[39:07] and my mom. Lord, all these people
[39:10] affected by this devil called
[39:12] musculardrophe.
[39:15] Father, we just rebuke [music] it in
[39:16] Jesus name.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; I pray that you would just bring peace
[39:21] and comfort to each one. Lord, we just
[39:24] ask Lord now that you would be glorified
[39:26] in the rest of this service, Father. and
[39:29] every word that's spoken, Father, and
[39:31] every heart that's receives it, Lord.
[39:33] Father, that you would just be glorified
[39:35] now. We love you and we thank you. We
[39:38] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[39:40] name we pray.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:44] [snorts] Thank you, musicians.
[39:47] If you have your Bibles tonight, I'd
[39:48] like to read from a few places, but I'll
[39:51] start with Luke chapter 2.
[39:55] Luke chapter 2.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[39:59] &gt;&gt; like to thank each and everyone for
[40:01] coming out on a wintry Christmas Eve.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; I think it's a kind of a neat thing that
[40:08] we're actually able to gather together
[40:10] this way
[40:12] &gt;&gt; on Christmas Eve because we don't gather
[40:15] like a [snorts] lot of Christians do
[40:19] around this time
[40:21] where it's only Christmas or Easter.
[40:26] Tonight, I just would like to read the
[40:28] story of the birth of Jesus because
[40:31] &gt;&gt; it is Christmas and we're [snorts]
[40:34] certainly thankful for Christmas.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; In the book of Luke, chapter 2 verse 1.
[40:42] And it came to pass in those days that
[40:44] there went out a decree from Caesar
[40:46] Augustus
[40:49] that all the world should be taxed.
[40:52] And this taxing was f first made when
[40:56] Sirenius was governor of Syria.
[40:59] And all went to be taxed, everyone into
[41:02] his own city.
[41:04] And Joseph also went up from Galilee out
[41:08] of the city of Nazareth into Judea
[41:12] into the city of David, which is called
[41:15] Bethlehem,
[41:16] because he was of the house
[41:20] and lineage of David, to be taxed with
[41:23] Mary, his espoused wife, being great
[41:27] with child.
[41:29] We were talking about this earlier today
[41:31] and how they weren't yet married. They
[41:35] were engaged.
[41:38] His espoused wife being great with
[41:41] child.
[41:43] And so it was that while they were
[41:45] there, the days were accomplished that
[41:48] she should be delivered.
[41:51] And she brought forth her firstborn son,
[41:55] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes,
[41:58] and laid him in a manger, because there
[42:00] was no room for them in the inn.
[42:04] And there were in the same country
[42:07] shepherds abiding in their field,
[42:10] keeping watch over their flock by night.
[42:13] And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon
[42:16] them, and the glory of the Lord shone
[42:19] round about them, and they were sore
[42:22] afraid.
[42:24] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[42:28] for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[42:31] great joy, which shall be to all people.
[42:36] For unto you is born this day in the
[42:39] city of David a Savior, which is Christ
[42:43] the Lord.
[42:45] And this shall be a sign unto you.
[42:50] Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
[42:52] swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
[42:56] And suddenly there was with the angel a
[42:59] multitude of the heavenly host praising
[43:02] God and saying, "Glory to God in the
[43:06] highest and on earth peace and good will
[43:10] toward men."
[43:12] And it came to pass as the angels were
[43:14] gone away from them into heaven, the
[43:17] shepherds said one to another, "Let us
[43:20] now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this
[43:25] thing which has come to pass, which the
[43:28] Lord hath made known unto us."
[43:31] And they came with haste, and found
[43:33] Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in
[43:37] a manger. And when they had seen it,
[43:40] they made known abroad the saying which
[43:44] was told them concerning this child. And
[43:47] all they that heard it wondered at those
[43:52] things which were told them by the
[43:55] shepherds.
[43:56] But Mary kept all these things and
[44:00] pondered them in her heart.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the shepherds returned
[44:04] glorifying and praising God for all the
[44:08] things that they had heard and seen as
[44:12] it was told unto them.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[44:17] Father, we thank you, Lord, that you are
[44:19] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; That you're not a babe lying in a
[44:24] manger.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Father, we're not making a nativity
[44:27] scene that we can try and replicate that
[44:29] time. We know that that time came for a
[44:32] purpose, Lord. And many people want to
[44:35] look at it and think that it was simply
[44:38] the purpose of having Christmas and
[44:40] having gifts. But we know that purpose,
[44:43] Father, was to save mankind from
[44:46] himself. And we thank you for that gift
[44:49] that you sent, Lord.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that's the greatest
[44:52] gift. And that's the reason that there
[44:54] is a Christmas season. We thank you for
[44:56] it, Lord. Now we just ask that you would
[44:59] take the words that were spoken that you
[45:01] would break them open to us fresh once
[45:03] again. Lord, as we turn to your word, we
[45:05] give you all the praise and glory. In
[45:08] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be
[45:12] seated.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Certainly appreciate that scripture.
[45:25] love the reading of the birth of Jesus
[45:28] and the story of it
[45:31] and [snorts] really enjoy Christmas in
[45:34] general. The Christmas season is such a
[45:36] wonderful time. It's people tend to get
[45:39] nice nicer around the Christmas season
[45:41] and it's uh it's just a neat thing to
[45:44] see, you know, and I believe Brother
[45:46] Brandham even talks about it. If if the
[45:48] world would just stay that way, it would
[45:50] be such a a wonderful place to live in.
[45:52] But we know this world is not our home.
[45:56] Just like to welcome all of our visitors
[45:59] tonight. God bless you. Certainly
[46:00] appreciate having you here. And uh
[46:04] certainly miss those that couldn't come
[46:06] today. We know it's not always easy. And
[46:08] even with the Christmas season, there's
[46:11] commitments. There's things that we have
[46:12] going and we certainly love and
[46:14] appreciate each one.
[46:17] you know, uh, merry Christmas, I think,
[46:20] is such a wonderful thing and, uh, even
[46:22] the saying, Merry Christmas, I think
[46:25] it's, uh, a beautiful thing. We could
[46:27] say that and, uh, unabashedly mean it.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Whereas many people can say it in this
[46:33] world and they only say it because
[46:34] they're actually under the anointing of
[46:36] the spirit of Christmas. But as
[46:39] believers, I think to say Merry
[46:41] Christmas, it shouldn't make us nervous.
[46:44] It shouldn't scare us. But I know some
[46:46] people get upset if you say merry
[46:48] Christmas. And I wonder where that comes
[46:50] from. I really do. I know in the
[46:53] message, brother Brandham, he says in
[46:55] one place that we should say, you know,
[46:58] God bless you. God be with you instead
[47:01] of Merry Christmas.
[47:03] But I know he didn't say don't say Merry
[47:05] Christmas. That's a bad thing to do. He
[47:08] never said that. So where did it come in
[47:10] and around the message that we should be
[47:11] nervous about saying Merry Christmas? I
[47:15] don't think it's something that we
[47:16] should be afraid of because we know who
[47:18] we are, don't we?
[47:19] &gt;&gt; We realize who we are and and what we're
[47:22] raised up for. We're not raised up to
[47:24] fall under the spirit of every single
[47:26] season that comes around. We don't fall
[47:28] under the same spirit of of Christmas
[47:31] that we fall under for Halloween, that
[47:33] we fall under for Easter. We fall under
[47:36] one spirit, and that's the Holy Spirit.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; But we don't fall under it. We're raised
[47:42] up to it. Right.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And I think it's such a wonderful thing.
[47:45] But you know, the spirit of Christmas is
[47:47] one thing, but to say Merry Christmas is
[47:50] kindness. It's human kindness. If we
[47:53] could say Merry Christmas as a believer
[47:55] to people in this world that aren't even
[47:58] Christian, we can say something to them
[48:01] that they don't even understand.
[48:04] Because what we're talking about, Merry
[48:06] Christmas, is the gift that God gave to
[48:09] this world of eternal life that we read
[48:12] about in this in this chapter here. I
[48:14] think it's so beautiful. But we're not
[48:16] caught up in the Christmas spirit just
[48:17] because we say, "Merry Christmas." Maybe
[48:19] we have a Christmas card and we give it
[48:21] to someone and it says, "Merry
[48:22] Christmas." It shouldn't be offensive to
[48:24] us as a believer, should it? Why would
[48:26] it be? It doesn't make any sense to me
[48:28] at all. Right.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; The only thing that it would do to me if
[48:32] someone would get upset by that, it
[48:34] would show me that there's something a
[48:35] little bit pious going on.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Why would we get upset by the words
[48:40] Merry Christmas? Especially because if
[48:42] you search it out in the message,
[48:43] Brother Brham said it 16 times. He said
[48:46] those words, "Merry Christmas." And he
[48:48] said it in a way that was just like
[48:50] this. Merry Christmas.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; I want to wish you a merry Christmas.
[48:55] Yes.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Shocking that we would even talk that
[48:59] way, isn't it?
[49:00] &gt;&gt; But I know people that have been upset
[49:02] because they've heard Merry Christmas.
[49:04] What a strange thing. I'll tell you what
[49:05] it is. It's teaching for doctrines the
[49:07] commandments of men.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; That's what that is.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense,
[49:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; But tonight, I don't want to go that
[49:15] way. I want to bring you greetings from
[49:16] brother Ed Hammermeister and the saints
[49:18] at End Time Message Tabernacle. I want
[49:20] to bring you greetings from uh from the
[49:24] uh brother Jonah Mi in Colona [snorts]
[49:27] and the saints there as well. Certainly
[49:29] wonderful to talk to the brothers and
[49:31] just stay in contact with them. And
[49:34] we're uh just want to remember that we
[49:36] have a a service coming up on the 31st
[49:38] and I'm hoping that we don't have a lot
[49:39] of preaching that we just have a lot of
[49:41] rejoicing and uh testimonies and
[49:44] specials and we'll have a communion
[49:45] service as well. We're not aiming for it
[49:47] to be a watch night service where we
[49:49] wait till 12 midnight to have communion.
[49:52] We just don't do that necessarily and
[49:54] some people do, but I I just don't
[49:56] really think it's necessary. Um I know
[49:59] my pastor didn't either. And so I kind
[50:02] of I like that. We'll just get together
[50:04] and have a good time for those people
[50:06] that can.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking about it. This
[50:09] this service tonight is the first
[50:11] service that I can remember um that
[50:14] we've had actually on Christmas Eve and
[50:17] I was looking back in the calendar and
[50:19] the last one that happened was in 2019
[50:22] and I can't remember if we had a service
[50:24] on Wednesday night. Does anybody
[50:26] remember whether we did? I don't think
[50:28] so. I think we uh we shut it down. I
[50:32] know a lot of churches did shut it down
[50:33] tonight and I do apologize if anybody is
[50:36] upset or or uncomfortable because we
[50:39] came to church on Wednesday, which is
[50:41] actually Christmas Eve. But like we said
[50:43] before, what else are we going to do on
[50:45] Christmas Eve? We'd be coming to church
[50:47] anyways. It's Wednesday night. I I don't
[50:49] know. I just thought, let's go for it.
[50:51] Let's have a a time of celebration, a
[50:54] celebration about the season. We can
[50:56] look at it through different lenses,
[50:58] through a totally different eye when we
[51:00] know exactly who we are according to the
[51:02] message of the hour. Tonight, I'm going
[51:04] to minister out of the message God's
[51:06] gifts always find their places, but I've
[51:09] got a few scriptures that I want to talk
[51:10] about as well, but I didn't send it to
[51:13] the brothers. Uh, so don't get nervous.
[51:15] It's it's out of 1963 12 uh 22. God's
[51:19] gifts always find their places. just
[51:22] talking about brother Brandham and and
[51:24] how he was involved with Christmas in
[51:26] his life and some might say well he came
[51:29] from the unbelievers and you know sure
[51:31] enough but Christmas was around in his
[51:34] world as well and you know in this one
[51:36] little quote he says see and I I know
[51:38] but looking back on my life and I wonder
[51:40] where it happened from them first little
[51:42] Christmases when we hang up our
[51:44] stockings and and mama would get we'd
[51:47] probably get an orange and two or three
[51:50] little pieces of striped candy and that
[51:53] was a great Christmas to us.
[51:55] But [clears throat] you know, kids, they
[51:57] look forward to them gifts and they do.
[52:01] That's the world that we live in. The
[52:02] kids do look forward to the gifts. And I
[52:05] know some parents probably flatly refuse
[52:07] to give their children gifts because
[52:08] that's a a pagan tradition or whatever.
[52:12] But you know, Brother Brandham did say
[52:14] it as as a believer. He said, "Don't
[52:17] don't don't be weird. Don't be strange
[52:20] in this world, right?
[52:22] &gt;&gt; We don't want to make our children feel
[52:23] uncomfortable in this world, do we?
[52:26] &gt;&gt; I don't think that's that's myself, my
[52:28] own opinion, but you know, even brother
[52:31] Brandham, he had gifts as a child, and
[52:33] brother Brandham gave his children
[52:35] gifts. Now, we'll go a little further
[52:37] and and say it this way. Brother
[52:39] Brandham even had a Christmas tree,
[52:42] but he had it for the kiddos. That's
[52:44] what he said. It's for the kids. Now,
[52:46] I'm not saying you should or you
[52:48] shouldn't, but what I am saying is who
[52:50] are you worshiping?
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Who's who who who's the God that you
[52:54] serve? Are we are we conforming to the
[52:56] image of this world? Or are we actually
[52:59] living according to the light that we've
[53:01] been shown in the day in which we live?
[53:04] But it can be very easy to set standards
[53:06] and say that unless we do it this way,
[53:09] we're actually doing it wrong. And that
[53:11] is what my pastor used to call a
[53:14] denomination of one.
[53:16] We can set a standard and say that it
[53:18] has to be this way. And if it's not this
[53:20] way, then it's wrong. That's such a
[53:22] terrible thing to do. Just simply trust
[53:24] the Lord. And if somebody's doing
[53:26] something that makes you feel
[53:27] uncomfortable, maybe just go to praying
[53:29] for them.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Just ask the Lord to either open your
[53:32] eyes or to open their eyes.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you something will
[53:36] happen.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham, he says, you know,
[53:40] kids, they look forward to them gifts.
[53:42] we find out that Christmas is mainly to
[53:45] the children and and they look forward
[53:47] to that nowadays.
[53:49] He says it's turned off to the children,
[53:51] but it really should be adults
[53:54] should be teaching their children what
[53:56] real Christmas is.
[53:59] And I do not believe that Christ could
[54:01] be born on the 25th day of de December
[54:04] in Judea
[54:06] because it's colder than it is here now.
[54:09] See, you know, I when I first came into
[54:11] the message, I started to hear this and
[54:13] I thought, "This is weird
[54:15] just hearing it carnally,
[54:18] &gt;&gt; but then I started to think about it.
[54:20] Think about the words that he's saying
[54:22] and and really take a look at it." And I
[54:24] started to say, "Wow,
[54:27] there could be something to this.
[54:30] I think it's interesting."
[54:33] He says, "Oh, and and how could the
[54:35] shepherds be keeping their flocks by
[54:37] night? How many sheep herders do you
[54:40] know around here that are out with their
[54:41] shepherds at night in this weather?
[54:45] I know guys that raise sheep. I don't
[54:47] know them, but I know where they are
[54:49] west of Claire's home where we would go
[54:50] and hunt. And they have sheep. And I'm
[54:53] pretty sure they're not out there with a
[54:55] staff and a and a a hoodie and a a parka
[54:59] and their gloves hurting their sheep in
[55:02] this weather. Nobody's doing that.
[55:05] But how could they shepherds be keeping
[55:07] their flocks by night? And then the
[55:09] taxation and everything and Mary having
[55:11] to come that far from way down in
[55:14] Bethlehem up into Judea up into
[55:17] Jerusalem rather for the taxation. I
[55:20] could hardly believe that come up I
[55:22] believe she come to Nazareth and so and
[55:26] how that could be done. It could not be
[55:29] done. But I believe that Christ was born
[55:32] in a spring because every way he was a
[55:35] lamb.
[55:37] He says, you notice he was born in a
[55:41] barn and not in a house.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; He was a lamb and born in the
[55:47] springtime. It's interesting to think
[55:48] about this. You know, I'm just going to
[55:50] digress a little bit. I went and did a a
[55:52] little uh little 10-minute study at the
[55:57] Trinity Lodge here right at the
[55:59] beginning of December. They invited me
[56:01] to come and so I did and I just felt led
[56:03] to bring this scripture here.
[56:06] And uh you know the what verse is it
[56:09] here? How the shepherds were there and
[56:12] the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for
[56:14] behold, this is verse 10 of Luke 2. I
[56:17] bring you good tidings of great joy
[56:19] which shall be to all people. And we
[56:22] talked a little bit further about the
[56:24] scripture here, but I just thought it
[56:26] was wonderful because you know the angel
[56:28] messenger always says the same thing,
[56:30] doesn't he?
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Fear not
[56:35] &gt;&gt; because I bring you good tidings of
[56:37] great joy. And and you know, I I brought
[56:40] it from this context that it was it was
[56:42] just that it shall be to all people. And
[56:44] you know what that all people means? Us
[56:48] today even because we still fit in that
[56:50] category of all people. But you know I I
[56:53] started to talk about the birth of Jesus
[56:54] and how he would be wrapped in swaddling
[56:56] cloth and lying in a manger. And you
[56:58] know who talks like this now? We had a
[57:01] bunch of elderly people really elderly
[57:03] people. And there would happen to be a a
[57:06] a Catholic priest who was a bishop at
[57:08] one time and he isn't any longer. he's
[57:11] and uh you know the the other chaplain
[57:14] for the church was there and so I'm
[57:17] talking and of course I'm starting to
[57:18] feel a little bit nervous as I'm talking
[57:20] because I realize people are really
[57:22] wondering what I'm saying because I
[57:23] started to talk about what we know about
[57:26] the swaddling cloth. What is that? It's
[57:28] not the the fluffy kind soft nativity
[57:32] picture that you get painted so many
[57:34] times when people reenact it. The way
[57:36] our prophet said was that swaddling
[57:38] cloth was that nasty piece of material
[57:41] that went between the ox's yolk and the
[57:43] hide of the ox as he plowed the field or
[57:46] pulled the wagon and the sweat got
[57:48] absorbed into that cloth. And that was
[57:51] all they had in that barn to wrap that
[57:54] lamb. And then they took him and put him
[57:57] in in in the manger. The manger sounds
[58:00] so nice and so sweet, doesn't it? Many
[58:03] times you see the nativity scene and
[58:05] it's all so beautiful. Everyone's
[58:06] standing around and sure enough there's
[58:08] baby Jesus. He's in a soft soft manger.
[58:11] It was a feed trough.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; A trough that you would put feed in for
[58:16] animals. Stinking animals with flies and
[58:19] slobber coming off them and who knows
[58:22] what other bugs would be falling in
[58:23] there. That's what they had to put baby
[58:25] Jesus in.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; But that was our king. Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And no wonder Satan couldn't believe the
[58:35] king of glory
[58:37] &gt;&gt; would come down and manifest himself in
[58:40] a human body in a stable in a manger of
[58:45] hay wrapped in a swaddling cloth.
[58:48] But he he decided, you know what we need
[58:50] to do is we need to try and paint the
[58:52] picture in such a way that it was so
[58:54] beautiful. It was so soft and so kind
[58:58] just like the kind old priest.
[59:01] The picture that we're talking about
[59:02] tonight is the birth of Jesus. Um the
[59:06] shepherds, how wonderful it is to know
[59:08] that that everything that happens, it
[59:11] doesn't happen by accident. Everything
[59:13] happens according to God's plan. It's
[59:15] his business. It's his way of doing
[59:17] things. And uh you know another another
[59:19] quote out of this message, God's gifts
[59:21] always find their places. He says, "Now
[59:23] watch the gift that the wise men brought
[59:26] that these wise men brought or brought
[59:29] him." Today we find that we're swapping
[59:34] gifts.
[59:36] Everybody has to get a gift and try to
[59:38] figure out what the next fellow's going
[59:40] to give him so he can give him something
[59:43] comparing that much.
[59:46] And if it isn't, well, on the New Year's
[59:49] he feels he has to make it up. and
[59:51] everyone studying and worrying and
[59:53] walking the floor, the millionaires, how
[59:55] they're going to get by. They give so
[59:58] much to this one and that when it's all
[1:00:00] together wrong.
[1:00:03] It's altogether Christmas
[1:00:05] here. There's only one gift that you can
[1:00:09] give. And you know, if I had nothing
[1:00:12] else to say tonight, this would be it.
[1:00:14] There's only one gift you have to give
[1:00:17] that you can give. Excuse me. And that's
[1:00:19] yourself.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to God because God's
[1:00:25] already give to you his gift.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; That one lying in a manger.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; And we know for sure that we're all
[1:00:34] pretty much there. I'm sure we've we've
[1:00:36] all given ourselves to God. It's a
[1:00:38] wonderful thing to know that we've done
[1:00:40] that. But I think that sometimes we can
[1:00:43] do it even just a little more. Just a
[1:00:44] little more dedication. You know, I was
[1:00:47] thinking about the the last year, 2025,
[1:00:50] and if you look back at maybe what
[1:00:53] happened in the year and and what we've
[1:00:55] done with our life, have we have we
[1:00:57] grown or have we shrank?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Have we increased or decreased? And I'm
[1:01:02] not talking about money. Don't think
[1:01:04] about money. That's got nothing to do
[1:01:06] with it.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; This is all about the word. We're in
[1:01:09] church now. We're talking spirit. Yeah.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Have we got a better relationship with
[1:01:13] God now than when we started in 2025?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Because if we don't, something's wrong.
[1:01:21] [clears throat]
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; We're either growing or we're dying.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Growing or shrinking. That's the the
[1:01:25] universal law here. But there's only one
[1:01:28] gift that you can give and that is
[1:01:30] yourself.
[1:01:32] Give yourself to God because God's
[1:01:35] already given to you his gift. Just like
[1:01:37] we could say, "Lord, heal me." And he'll
[1:01:40] say, "I've already done it.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; I've already healed you when I took
[1:01:45] those 39 stripes.
[1:01:48] You already are healed. You just need to
[1:01:50] accept it."
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; We just need to accept the gift the way
[1:01:53] that he's given it.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; God's already give to you his gift. Now,
[1:01:59] there's only one thing you owe back to
[1:02:01] him. That's yourself to him. And you
[1:02:03] know, in the day in which we live, we're
[1:02:04] not just talking about saying that I
[1:02:06] believe in Jesus Christ. We cannot
[1:02:09] negate the word of a vindicated prophet
[1:02:11] and think that we're going to get the
[1:02:13] right results.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; We have got to come God's provided way.
[1:02:16] And if we're willing to do that, then we
[1:02:18] will get that result. And we know the
[1:02:21] the the scripture says that if you
[1:02:23] receive a prophet in the name of a
[1:02:24] prophet, you will receive the prophet's
[1:02:26] reward. And what's that reward? It is to
[1:02:28] be the prophet's friend. That's what he
[1:02:30] said. And to be his friend means that
[1:02:32] we're going to be actually accounted
[1:02:34] with him as his converts when he's over
[1:02:37] there because he's going to be judged
[1:02:38] just like Paul's going to be judged and
[1:02:40] we're going to be there with him. But
[1:02:42] you know what we're talking about is
[1:02:43] this gift. The greatest gift that could
[1:02:45] ever happen was God giving himself as a
[1:02:48] human being to be sacrificed for all of
[1:02:51] our transgressions. God's greatest gift
[1:02:55] to man. What a tremendous thing it is.
[1:02:58] Let's turn over to Matthew. Matthew
[1:03:01] chapter 1.
[1:03:03] Matthew chapter 1. God's greatest gift.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 1.
[1:03:12] Start with verse 18. We're talking about
[1:03:14] the the greatest gift, the the reason
[1:03:17] for Christmas, the purpose of us being
[1:03:21] here even tonight. Verse 18 says, "Now
[1:03:25] the birth of Jesus Christ was on this
[1:03:28] wise,
[1:03:31] when as his mother Mary was espoused to
[1:03:33] Joseph, before they came together, she
[1:03:37] was found with child
[1:03:40] of the Holy Ghost."
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; I think that's so beautiful. As I was
[1:03:45] studying this, I was just having a
[1:03:46] little jubilee. Then Joseph, her
[1:03:49] husband, being a just man and not
[1:03:50] willing to make her a public example,
[1:03:52] was minded to put her away privy.
[1:03:56] But while he thought on these things,
[1:03:59] behold, the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:04:02] unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph,
[1:04:05] thou son of David, fear not to take unto
[1:04:08] thee Mary thy wife, for that which is
[1:04:12] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost,
[1:04:16] and she shall bring forth a son, and
[1:04:20] thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
[1:04:24] shall save his people from their sins.
[1:04:28] Now, all this was done that it might be
[1:04:31] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; by the prophet. See, I just love that it
[1:04:38] was spoken of the Lord, was it?
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; By the prophet.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:04:46] forever.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, a virgin shall be with
[1:04:50] child, and shall bring forth a son, and
[1:04:52] they shall call his name Emmanuel, which
[1:04:55] being interpreted is God with us."
[1:05:00] Then Joseph being raised from sleep, did
[1:05:04] as the angel of the Lord had bidden him,
[1:05:06] and took unto him his wife, and knew her
[1:05:10] not till she had brought forth her
[1:05:12] firstborn son. And they called his name
[1:05:16] Jesus.
[1:05:18] I think it's just such a beautiful thing
[1:05:20] this this whole story. I I just wanted
[1:05:23] to go through it tonight just for the
[1:05:24] sake of, you know, discussion and and
[1:05:27] celebration really.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; I think it's just such a a wonderful
[1:05:31] thing, you know, over in the uh in the
[1:05:34] book of Luke.
[1:05:37] Luke chapter 1,
[1:05:41] all about Jesus tonight. All about the
[1:05:43] story, that nativity scene. Let's paint
[1:05:46] that picture tonight. Let's let's
[1:05:48] remember what gift we've been given.
[1:05:50] Luke ver 1 verse 26.
[1:05:56] I think it's so beautiful. Why did Mary
[1:06:00] actually have Jesus?
[1:06:03] There's a reason for it. There's a
[1:06:05] reason for it. Verse 26 of Luke 1. and
[1:06:10] the sixth month. And in the sixth month,
[1:06:12] the angel Gabriel was sent from God
[1:06:16] unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth. I
[1:06:20] I just think it's so beautiful when you
[1:06:21] think about this. When you just stop and
[1:06:23] and think about this this there was a
[1:06:25] specific time. There was a month, a day,
[1:06:29] and a year where an angel messenger was
[1:06:33] sent from God into a city on earth.
[1:06:38] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:06:40] forever.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; It's entirely possible that he could
[1:06:44] choose to do the exact same thing again.
[1:06:47] Isn't it?
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; He's God.
[1:06:51] 27. To a virgin espoused to a man, whose
[1:06:55] name was Joseph of the house of David,
[1:06:58] and the virgin's name was Mary. And the
[1:07:01] angel came in unto her, and said, Hail,
[1:07:04] thou that are highly favored, the Lord
[1:07:08] is with thee. Blessed art thou among
[1:07:11] women.
[1:07:12] And when she saw him, she was troubled
[1:07:14] at his saying, and cast in her mind,
[1:07:16] what manner of salutation this should
[1:07:19] be. And the angel said unto her, Fear
[1:07:23] not, Mary.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. For thou hast found favor with
[1:07:26] God,
[1:07:28] and behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:07:31] womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt
[1:07:33] call his name Jesus.
[1:07:36] And we know we've preached on this many,
[1:07:37] many times. That's right.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; And it's just as powerful tonight. I
[1:07:41] just want to have a fit when I start
[1:07:42] talking about this, when I start
[1:07:44] thinking about this because this is
[1:07:46] exactly the same thing for every single
[1:07:48] believer of the word of God for the day
[1:07:51] in which they live. Doesn't matter what
[1:07:52] day. When we can realize that an angel
[1:07:55] messenger brings a message saying you
[1:07:58] are highly favored among women. Remember
[1:08:01] women is the feminine. The feminine is
[1:08:04] the church. If you are a part of the
[1:08:07] church, you fit that feminine. He's the
[1:08:09] same yesterday, today, and forever. This
[1:08:11] is the exact same formula that happens
[1:08:13] in the life of a believer. You hear the
[1:08:15] word of an angel messenger and something
[1:08:18] happens. You can choose to say, "Be it
[1:08:21] unto me according to thy word." Or you
[1:08:24] can say, "I think I'm hearing things. I
[1:08:27] think I'm thinking things." Things are
[1:08:28] just a little bit weird. We'll carry on
[1:08:31] here. Verse 32. He shall be great, and
[1:08:33] he shall be called the son of the
[1:08:35] highest. And the Lord God shall give
[1:08:37] unto him the throne of his father David.
[1:08:41] And he shall reign over the house of
[1:08:43] Jacob forever. And of his kingdom there
[1:08:46] shall be no end.
[1:08:49] Can you imagine that?
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Having an angel messenger telling you
[1:08:53] that that is who your son is going to
[1:08:55] be.
[1:08:57] Then said Mary unto the angel, "How
[1:09:00] shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
[1:09:04] There's no natural connection. How can
[1:09:06] this possibly happen?" And the angel
[1:09:09] answered and said unto her, "The Holy
[1:09:11] Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
[1:09:14] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:09:17] thee. Therefore also that holy thing
[1:09:20] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:09:22] called the son of God.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Didn't we just say that it was the Holy
[1:09:29] Ghost that was going to overshadow her?
[1:09:33] How could it be the son of God?
[1:09:36] Wouldn't Wouldn't God be the father
[1:09:38] then?
[1:09:41] We all know this. I think it's so
[1:09:42] beautiful.
[1:09:44] And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she
[1:09:46] hath also conceived a son in her old
[1:09:48] age, and this is the sixth month with
[1:09:50] her who was called barren. For with God
[1:09:54] nothing shall be impossible.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; And you know, this is the key to it all
[1:09:59] right here, brothers and sisters, even
[1:10:00] in the day in which we live. Verse 38.
[1:10:03] And Mary said, and we could just take
[1:10:04] Mary's name out without adding to or
[1:10:06] taking away. I don't want to do that.
[1:10:08] But for the sake of illustration tonight
[1:10:10] about this baby in a manger, let's talk
[1:10:12] about it and maybe just try and put your
[1:10:14] name in there when you can read this.
[1:10:16] And I like to say, "And Barry said,
[1:10:18] behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it
[1:10:20] unto me according to thy what?"
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Not church, right? Not denomination,
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; thy word.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; And the angel departed from her. And we
[1:10:31] know in the day in which we live, it's
[1:10:33] no different.
[1:10:35] It was the word of a prophet.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; God spoke through the prophet and he
[1:10:42] still does.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; But look at this scripture here. It's
[1:10:45] just so beautiful because we can look
[1:10:47] over go a little bit further. Uh 41 and
[1:10:51] 44. Jump down to 41. And it came to pass
[1:10:54] that when Elizabeth heard the salutation
[1:10:56] of Mary, what? The babe leapt in her
[1:10:59] womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the
[1:11:02] Holy Ghost and spake out with a loud
[1:11:04] voice and said, "Blessed art thou among
[1:11:06] women, and blessed is the fruit of thy
[1:11:08] womb. And whence is this to me that the
[1:11:11] mother of my Lord should come unto me.
[1:11:13] For lo, as soon as the voice of thy
[1:11:16] salutation sounded in my ears, the babe
[1:11:19] leapt in my womb for joy."
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Speak the name of Jesus.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And see what happens.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:29] say the name Jesus and devils flee.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; They have got to go.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; And you know, I I I'm just going to jump
[1:11:37] around a little bit tonight. I hope it's
[1:11:38] okay. I don't want to keep us late, but
[1:11:40] I just wanted to try and illustrate the
[1:11:42] picture of Jesus coming to this earth,
[1:11:45] knowing that Jesus coming to this earth
[1:11:47] was nothing other than the word of a
[1:11:50] vindicated prophet. because it was the
[1:11:53] word of a prophet. A human being heard
[1:11:55] that word and knew somewhere somehow
[1:11:58] there had to be a fulfillment of that
[1:12:00] word. And there was a time that came by
[1:12:03] an angel messenger that said, "You're
[1:12:04] the one." And it's no different to every
[1:12:07] single human being that lives on earth.
[1:12:09] There comes a time where we reach that
[1:12:11] crossroad like we've talked about where
[1:12:13] we've got to say that's either going to
[1:12:15] be me or it's not going to be me. But
[1:12:16] when it is me, I give myself wholly over
[1:12:19] to it just like Mary did. And then
[1:12:21] there's something holy that comes to
[1:12:23] life inside of me.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; There's a babe that comes to life that
[1:12:27] leaps in the womb of my heart in my
[1:12:29] soul.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; At the name of Jesus.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; You know, the scripture is always based
[1:12:37] on something already spoken by a
[1:12:39] prophet. And we could turn over to
[1:12:42] Isaiah 7, but we don't need to. For the
[1:12:44] sake of discussion tonight, I'll just
[1:12:46] read it. Isaiah 7. Isaiah was around
[1:12:49] about 700 years prior to this. Sometimes
[1:12:53] in our lives, we can think about the
[1:12:56] scriptures and the and the prophecies
[1:12:58] and how things can be spoken by a
[1:13:00] vindicated prophet and maybe they just
[1:13:02] haven't happened in a timely fashion.
[1:13:04] Well, what's a timely fashion?
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; We're talking about God's timetable
[1:13:09] here.
[1:13:11] 700 years it took for Isaiah's words. We
[1:13:14] heard I don't know who it was that said
[1:13:15] it. The words keep going around and
[1:13:17] around and around and around the earth,
[1:13:20] right? Keep traveling around the earth.
[1:13:22] The words don't stop. They keep going
[1:13:24] around and around and around looking for
[1:13:26] that one person, for that one womb to
[1:13:29] land on. And boy, when that womb comes
[1:13:31] up in the age in which they live,
[1:13:34] something takes place. And we know
[1:13:36] that's what happened in the case of
[1:13:38] Mary. She was the one that was to catch
[1:13:40] that word in her day. 700 years later
[1:13:44] after the prophet Isaiah in chapter
[1:13:47] 7:14, therefore the Lord himself shall
[1:13:51] give you a sign, behold, a virgin shall
[1:13:54] conceive and bear a son and call his
[1:13:57] name Emmanuel,
[1:13:59] being interpreted, God with us,
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; as we just heard.
[1:14:06] So, you know, brothers and sisters, what
[1:14:08] I want to get to today is just jump
[1:14:10] right into the punchline and just maybe
[1:14:12] punch at it a few times if that's okay.
[1:14:15] The manger today,
[1:14:17] it's not at the Catholic church down on
[1:14:19] the corner. It's not on the little
[1:14:21] display that we might set up in the
[1:14:23] corner of our house. It's not somewhere
[1:14:26] out there that we can possibly put
[1:14:28] together. That manger is right here.
[1:14:30] It's that little tiny spot that God made
[1:14:33] in the heart of every single human being
[1:14:35] that no other creature on earth has.
[1:14:38] That little spot that he created for
[1:14:40] himself.
[1:14:42] And you know, many times I can't I can't
[1:14:44] I can't I can't dispute it. Looking at
[1:14:47] it the way it was in my life, I'll just
[1:14:48] use my life for an example. It was no
[1:14:50] different than that stinky barn. It was
[1:14:52] no different than that that swaddling
[1:14:54] cloth or that that manger. It was
[1:14:57] absolutely no different than all that
[1:14:59] dung manure that was all over the floor.
[1:15:01] The smells that must have been in that
[1:15:03] barn. That was what this was right here.
[1:15:05] But it doesn't matter. He knows exactly
[1:15:08] where he wants to go. And he's going to
[1:15:10] go where he wants to go. All he's going
[1:15:13] to do is invite. He's going to give the
[1:15:16] invitation. And if we're like Mary and
[1:15:18] say, "Behold,
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; the handmade of the Lord, just be it
[1:15:22] unto me according to thy word."
[1:15:25] And that's the critical factor I
[1:15:27] believe. I'm sure we all do. It's got to
[1:15:29] be according to the word, right? And if
[1:15:31] we can accept that gift today, then we
[1:15:33] have a nativity scene in our life every
[1:15:36] day we live
[1:15:38] because it's not actually looking back.
[1:15:41] It's looking right here.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; We're not looking back. We're not
[1:15:46] looking forward. Even though we like to
[1:15:48] do both, we're not ignoring what's
[1:15:50] taking place right now.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that's why all of us
[1:15:53] have the desire to gather together in
[1:15:55] the name of Jesus.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; But you know, his gift today is wrapped
[1:16:00] in his word.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; And if we want to see where it's at, we
[1:16:04] just got to open it up. We've got to
[1:16:06] pull back the pages. We've got to pull
[1:16:08] back the wrapping of the word and see if
[1:16:11] he won't reveal himself to us.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And I want to encourage us tonight,
[1:16:16] brothers and sisters. Maybe let's unwrap
[1:16:19] that present. Let's unwrap that gift
[1:16:21] just a little more than we ever have.
[1:16:24] You know how kids get excited about
[1:16:27] presents. Even adults do sometimes. If
[1:16:30] you've ever had a present for your
[1:16:32] birthday or or for Christmas or for
[1:16:34] whatever, we get excited about tearing
[1:16:36] that paper off so we can get in there,
[1:16:38] dig in there, and see what's there. It's
[1:16:41] the same thing for the word in the day
[1:16:43] in which we live. If we can do that, you
[1:16:45] know, I can testify that when we do
[1:16:47] that, there's so much in there that that
[1:16:49] will change our life forever.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; You know, many times we can think if I
[1:16:53] could just open up a box and and have a
[1:16:56] million dollars inside of it, it would
[1:16:57] change my life forever. It would just
[1:16:59] change my life. And you know, maybe it
[1:17:01] would, but likely what it would do is
[1:17:03] change our life for the worse,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; not the better. Sometimes you can
[1:17:08] actually take money and think you're
[1:17:10] going to help people
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; and it doesn't help them. It hurts them.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; It's shocking, but it's true.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Money is not always a blessing. It's not
[1:17:21] a way to measure. It's not the measuring
[1:17:23] stick of God's blessing in our lives.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Because the love of money is the root of
[1:17:28] all evil.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; And it's weird because there's no other
[1:17:32] love of anything else that has to do
[1:17:35] with evil. It's the love of money.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; But if we got a box with a million
[1:17:41] dollars in it, I'll tell you what, if I
[1:17:43] knew that's what was in there and
[1:17:44] somebody gave it to me, I would tear
[1:17:46] that paper off. I would rip it off and I
[1:17:50] would dig in and I would get that
[1:17:51] million dollars out.
[1:17:54] And I would take some time and think
[1:17:55] about what I was going to do with it.
[1:17:57] But you know, that million dollars would
[1:17:58] just in this world would just be gone.
[1:18:02] Some people would invest it. You could
[1:18:03] invest it and maybe make 2 million. But
[1:18:05] then what what happens with money is
[1:18:08] it's never enough.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; You always want more.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; But I think it's beautiful because the
[1:18:15] same the same I'll say curse the
[1:18:19] opposite to it is the blessing of the
[1:18:21] desire of the word of God. When we dig
[1:18:24] into the word of God, we can't get
[1:18:26] enough. We desire more and more. And
[1:18:30] that's the gift that he's given to us in
[1:18:32] the day in which we live. It's not just
[1:18:34] a book. And you know, when we look at
[1:18:36] the message, it's not just books and
[1:18:38] tapes. It's not just an MP3 player. It's
[1:18:40] not just an app on our phone. It's
[1:18:42] literally the life of Jesus Christ
[1:18:44] revealing himself to us in the age in
[1:18:47] which we live.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And the more we listen, the more we
[1:18:51] become just like him.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage us, brothers
[1:18:56] and sisters, to unwrap this present
[1:18:58] tonight. Amen.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Just unwrap it maybe in a little a
[1:19:02] little different way than maybe we ever
[1:19:03] have. Maybe just look at it from a
[1:19:05] little bit of a different perspective.
[1:19:06] Remember we were talking about
[1:19:07] perspective. My there's so much that we
[1:19:10] could get into about perspective.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Another quote out of this message, God's
[1:19:14] gifts always find their places. He says,
[1:19:18] "Now how fitting
[1:19:20] these gifts was to Christ's journey on
[1:19:23] earth, a baby born here on earth." And
[1:19:27] you know, we talked briefly. I
[1:19:28] apologize. I jump around sometimes about
[1:19:30] the the the wise men coming in and I
[1:19:33] think it's such an amazing thing. I
[1:19:35] remember brother Ken said this and I had
[1:19:36] never heard it before and I thought,
[1:19:38] "Are you sure?" I had to go back and
[1:19:40] fact check. Go f Go fact check. I
[1:19:43] promise you, you won't be disappointed.
[1:19:45] Fact check by the word. By the word.
[1:19:49] Don't fact check by Google, Chat GPT, or
[1:19:52] Grock. They're liars.
[1:19:55] How are they liars?
[1:19:57] They're not from God, are they?
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; They're from the tree of knowledge of
[1:20:02] what?
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Good and evil. They're not from the tree
[1:20:05] of life. There's only one tree of life,
[1:20:07] and this is it right here. Fact check it
[1:20:09] right here. But, Brother Ken, he said it
[1:20:11] the first time I heard it. I know,
[1:20:12] brother says it, too. There wasn't three
[1:20:14] wise men. Was there three wise men? The
[1:20:17] Bible doesn't say there was three wise
[1:20:18] men.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Bible doesn't say that. The Bible says
[1:20:22] that there was three gifts,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; but not that there was three wise men.
[1:20:27] But when you talk about all of the
[1:20:28] stuff, Brother Brandham, in this
[1:20:30] message, he really nails it. They say
[1:20:32] that the the wise men came and found
[1:20:34] them with the baby in the manger and
[1:20:36] they found him wrapped in swaddling
[1:20:37] clothes just after he was born. But if
[1:20:40] you look at the scripture, if you really
[1:20:42] look at the scripture and fact check
[1:20:43] that, you'll see that that baby was 2
[1:20:46] years and under because Herod found out
[1:20:49] that there was a promise according to
[1:20:51] prophecy that was going to happen in
[1:20:53] this land. there was going to be a
[1:20:54] Messiah, a deliverer, a king. And Herod
[1:20:57] in all of his insecurities couldn't
[1:21:00] stand that. So what did he do? He did
[1:21:01] the same thing. The same spirit anointed
[1:21:03] him that anointed Pharaoh back in Egypt
[1:21:06] and said, "All the children, boys two
[1:21:08] years and under, slaughter them."
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And we know, brother Bradom, he says it
[1:21:14] in this message, too, that uh that was
[1:21:16] the scripture that was fulfilled about
[1:21:18] how the children were taken and and
[1:21:20] Rachel just couldn't be comforted.
[1:21:23] She couldn't be comforted from the the
[1:21:25] weeping. But you know the wise men,
[1:21:28] there was wise men. They came, but it
[1:21:30] wasn't exactly the way the world
[1:21:31] portrays it. They weren't there standing
[1:21:34] there in the manger in the manure. They
[1:21:36] came two years later. And we know that
[1:21:38] story talks about the wise men coming to
[1:21:40] Herod saying, "Where's this king?" Can
[1:21:43] you imagine how Herod must have been
[1:21:44] upset? He was so insecure. What? You're
[1:21:47] the magi? You came and now you're
[1:21:48] saying, "Where's the king? I'm the
[1:21:50] king." Right.
[1:21:53] Yeah.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And [clears throat] they realized, man,
[1:21:55] this is weird. So then he said, "You
[1:21:57] know what? Just relax. If you go find
[1:21:59] him, come back and tell me. I'd like to
[1:22:01] come worship him, too." And they were
[1:22:03] like, "Yeah, okay. You're weird. See
[1:22:05] you." And they left, right? And they
[1:22:08] never went back to him. They went and
[1:22:10] found him.
[1:22:11] They presented their gifts, three gifts.
[1:22:14] And boy, we could talk about those and
[1:22:16] and maybe we will a little bit, but you
[1:22:18] know, the the way the story is construed
[1:22:20] by the world today, and we know it's the
[1:22:23] devil that does it, but the way it's
[1:22:24] done isn't necessarily according to the
[1:22:27] word. And that's why we have got to be
[1:22:29] willing to fact check ourselves in the
[1:22:31] word. And even myself, if I'm wrong, I'm
[1:22:34] going to say, "Amen. I'm wrong." It's
[1:22:37] got to be according to the word of God.
[1:22:39] That's our absolute. That's our
[1:22:40] benchmark.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says here how fitting these
[1:22:45] gifts was to Christ's journey on earth.
[1:22:46] A baby born here on earth. And these
[1:22:49] gifts that the wise men brought him
[1:22:51] fitted just exactly his commission from
[1:22:54] God and his journey on earth. Now the
[1:22:58] first thing, God. This was God. Isn't
[1:23:01] that beautiful?
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; This was God. This isn't the second or
[1:23:06] third person in some Godhead.
[1:23:10] This was God. Jesus was God in the form
[1:23:14] of man.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; That's hard for people to swallow that
[1:23:18] even today. How can you get around the
[1:23:21] word of a vindicated prophet saying that
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; is beyond me. Then he was God. He says
[1:23:28] and that's what he was. He wasn't
[1:23:30] nothing less than God. He was God
[1:23:33] manifested in the flesh. And we could
[1:23:36] jump over for the sake of time. We won't
[1:23:38] tonight. But if we read John, St. John
[1:23:41] chapter 1, he explains who this was.
[1:23:45] He was the creator in his own creation.
[1:23:49] I love this. This is why I'm saying it
[1:23:50] because this is where I I live. I love
[1:23:52] to preach. This is what I believe for
[1:23:54] all of us brothers and sisters. He was
[1:23:56] God manifested in the flesh. The more we
[1:23:58] take this word of the vindicated prophet
[1:24:00] and we eat it, the more we eat it, the
[1:24:02] more we learn it, the more we study it,
[1:24:04] the more we become it. Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; The more we become God manifested in the
[1:24:10] flesh.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; But it takes a sacrifice. It takes a
[1:24:14] commitment. It takes a willingness to
[1:24:15] die out to ourselves.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; He was the creator in his own creation.
[1:24:26] He was the creator in his creation. By
[1:24:29] the creation for the creation. He was
[1:24:33] the creator in his creation by his
[1:24:36] creation for his creation.
[1:24:40] I just think it sounds so simple and
[1:24:43] sometimes it is. It's God. He hides
[1:24:46] himself in simplicity
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; and he reveals himself in what?
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; In the same.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; It's exactly the way he is. Exactly how
[1:24:56] he does it.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; There were so many places I wanted to
[1:25:00] get into tonight. jumping around all
[1:25:02] over the place. I'm just going to stick
[1:25:03] with the quotes here and we'll just see
[1:25:04] what the Lord will do. The next one is
[1:25:07] notice when Jesus created bread,
[1:25:10] he took a piece of bread and he created
[1:25:13] bread that had already been bred.
[1:25:17] When he created fish, he took a fish
[1:25:20] that was first created a fish and put
[1:25:23] another fish out of it.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:25:28] What I want to do tonight, brothers and
[1:25:29] sisters, is take Jesus Christ, who was
[1:25:32] born in a manger 2,000 years ago, and
[1:25:35] let's bring him right up out of all of
[1:25:37] the history and make him Jesus Christ
[1:25:40] born in 2025 in the hearts of his
[1:25:43] children.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; He took a fish that was created a fish
[1:25:48] and put another fish out of it. Is that
[1:25:50] right? He took water, which potentially
[1:25:51] would have become wine, and made wine
[1:25:54] out of it. Is that right? It's
[1:25:57] interesting how he says that which
[1:25:58] potentially would have become wine.
[1:26:02] How would that have happened? That would
[1:26:04] have been a long process, wouldn't it?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; That water would have to go maybe into
[1:26:10] the clouds, maybe from the clouds in
[1:26:14] rain into the dirt to hit a seed to
[1:26:17] actually cause the seed to come to life.
[1:26:19] and and then that water would get inside
[1:26:21] that seed and the life would start to
[1:26:23] absorb the water every time it came and
[1:26:25] then it would go into grapes and those
[1:26:27] grapes would have to be matured and
[1:26:29] picked. It would take a long time. I
[1:26:32] love how he says this. He took water
[1:26:34] which potentially would have become wine
[1:26:37] and made wine out of it. Is that right?
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; The creator
[1:26:43] creating himself in his own creation.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just magnificent when you
[1:26:48] think about it. He goes on to say, "But
[1:26:50] we've seen him in our midst in this last
[1:26:52] days create things right out without
[1:26:55] anything standing there."
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Now, some people will say, "Well, it
[1:27:01] gets a bit crazy when you start talking
[1:27:03] like this." And I'll tell you what, I I
[1:27:05] bet you every single person that left
[1:27:06] that wedding that night that talked
[1:27:10] about how the governor saved the best
[1:27:12] wine for the last and then they find
[1:27:15] out, wait a second, he ran out of wine.
[1:27:17] They didn't even have wine.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; They were out of wine. But this one man,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; somehow he actually was able to change
[1:27:25] these water buckets into wine. The best
[1:27:28] wine they've ever tasted.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; They'll probably say, "Yeah, right.
[1:27:32] You're crazy. Sure. And what
[1:27:35] significance would that have anyways?
[1:27:37] They just needed more wine. Somebody
[1:27:39] probably paid somebody to come in and
[1:27:41] they did a some sort of a thing, right?
[1:27:43] You know, people will talk that way when
[1:27:45] you start talking squirrels.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Why would God create a squirrel?
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want nothing to do
[1:27:51] with that. WHY WOULD WHY WOULD GOD
[1:27:53] create a squirrel? What significance
[1:27:54] does it have? Just just enough
[1:27:56] significance so that it would happen.
[1:27:58] And then we would say, "Wow, I have an
[1:28:01] opportunity to either say I believe that
[1:28:03] or I don't."
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; because you know the third pull isn't
[1:28:09] going to be a public show.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; It's only going to be for a very select
[1:28:13] group of people which is going to be the
[1:28:15] greatest gift that we could ever see in
[1:28:17] the day in which we live.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; But I love how he says this. He created
[1:28:21] the the bread and he created the fish
[1:28:24] and he created the wine. He says, "Is
[1:28:27] that right to create a squirrel where
[1:28:29] there is no squirrels?" Right? Oh, he
[1:28:33] remains God. And you know, brothers and
[1:28:35] sisters, I want to say this. I've been
[1:28:36] pondering this for a long time. And I
[1:28:38] think it was exactly for this one
[1:28:39] purpose. And and just to start the
[1:28:42] purpose, not for that individual
[1:28:44] purpose, but to actually start the
[1:28:46] purpose and show how real it actually is
[1:28:49] for those people that can believe. That
[1:28:51] is the squirrels. God maybe took the
[1:28:53] squirrels and used the squirrels for the
[1:28:55] purpose of this one conversation sitting
[1:28:58] around eating cherry cobbler drinking
[1:29:00] coffee acting like human beings maybe
[1:29:02] after a group of services just some poor
[1:29:05] regular folks right talking about
[1:29:08] squirrels being created AND ONE PERSON
[1:29:11] ONE PERSON HAD the audacity to say
[1:29:13] brother Brandham I think that's exactly
[1:29:15] right
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; then what happened
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said you never pleased
[1:29:20] me
[1:29:22] He said, "You pleased the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; YOU SAID THE RIGHT THING."
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; I want to say this. In the day in which
[1:29:30] we live, brothers and sisters, what do
[1:29:31] we say?
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; What do we say when we think squirrels?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; We don't have to understand it. We don't
[1:29:37] have to explain it. We just either HAVE
[1:29:39] TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT believe it. And we
[1:29:42] have that choice.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; But if it worked for Hadtie, right?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; What ought it to do for us?
[1:29:50] Where are we with that tonight?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; If we want to see if God is God, ask
[1:29:55] him.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; If you're God, make yourself God to me.
[1:29:59] Let me see you in this day in which we
[1:30:01] live. Oh, I don't want to hear about my
[1:30:04] dad. I don't want to hear about my mom.
[1:30:05] I don't want to hear about all the other
[1:30:06] people's experiences. Make it real to
[1:30:09] me. Come and be alive. Take up your boat
[1:30:11] in the manger in my heart and show me
[1:30:14] that you're God. Hallelujah.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Is that right to create a
[1:30:18] squirrel where there is no squirrels?"
[1:30:20] Oh my. He remains God. He's just as much
[1:30:23] deity today as he was then and ever was
[1:30:26] or ever will be. Do you believe that
[1:30:29] tonight?
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Either he is or he isn't.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; He's still God.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; And challenging hearts to believe it.
[1:30:40] greater things than this.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Without anything to hold and break off,
[1:30:47] speak it and it'll be so.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, we're living in a
[1:30:52] different age than any other age. We're
[1:30:55] living in the culmination of all the
[1:30:56] ages. Just like the children of Israel
[1:30:59] coming to that promised land, camped on
[1:31:01] this side Jordan, they knew that one of
[1:31:04] these days we're going to have to cross
[1:31:06] over and we're going to be in our
[1:31:08] promised land. Now, some are saying,
[1:31:10] "Well, Brother Barry, we're already in
[1:31:12] our promised land. We got the Holy
[1:31:13] Ghost."
[1:31:15] That Holy Ghost is going to take you to
[1:31:17] another land. And without that Holy
[1:31:19] Ghost, you ain't going. You got to make
[1:31:21] sure that you're ready to go. And that's
[1:31:24] the day in which we live. Say the right
[1:31:26] thing, brothers and sisters. Even if you
[1:31:28] don't understand it, say the right
[1:31:29] thing, brothers and sisters. Even if
[1:31:31] your brother or sister upsets you, say
[1:31:34] the right things, brothers and sisters,
[1:31:36] and please the Holy Ghost. Don't worry
[1:31:38] about pleasing anybody else.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Carrying on in this message, he says,
[1:31:42] notice now we find that he identified
[1:31:45] the works that he did. Identified that
[1:31:48] he was deity.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you that he will identify
[1:31:52] himself as deity in your life, in your
[1:31:55] home if you ask him.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; He was deity. Showed that he was. For he
[1:32:01] said, "If I do not the works of my
[1:32:03] father, then don't believe me."
[1:32:05] But goodness sakes, how many people in
[1:32:08] this building here tonight and and you
[1:32:09] can show with hands or not or whether
[1:32:11] you're watching or not, but how many
[1:32:13] people have asked God to express himself
[1:32:16] as deity to to show yourself that you're
[1:32:19] God in our life because of whatever our
[1:32:22] need is and he hasn't come on the scene.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Anybody can say God has not been deity.
[1:32:29] He hasn't actually shown himself to be
[1:32:31] deity.
[1:32:35] My
[1:32:36] but the problem is I think many people
[1:32:38] just don't ask them.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; I think it's a little bit like this.
[1:32:47] You know, we've heard it said in the
[1:32:48] past and I I I believe it myself. I
[1:32:51] wouldn't mess with it.
[1:32:53] You got two people kind of like the
[1:32:56] women. One woman lost her baby. The
[1:32:59] other one had her baby. the one who lost
[1:33:02] her baby stole the other woman's baby.
[1:33:04] Remember, they went to Solomon and said,
[1:33:06] "You know, she stole my baby." And he
[1:33:09] said, "Don't worry about it. Just bring
[1:33:10] me a sword. We'll just cut the two cut
[1:33:12] the baby in half and we'll just give
[1:33:14] each a half." And you know that wisdom,
[1:33:17] I I think it's on the same wise. You get
[1:33:19] two people that are at odds and one
[1:33:22] person's lying and you know, one
[1:33:23] person's lying. Let's come and stand
[1:33:26] before God. No, better yet. Let's kneel
[1:33:27] before God right before the altar and
[1:33:30] ask him as deity, as God,
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; strike the liar dead,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; If I'm lying before you, God, then
[1:33:38] strike me dead.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; If he's God, I I wouldn't fool with
[1:33:43] that.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Just like the brothers that wanted to
[1:33:46] challenge Brother Brandham, on the on
[1:33:48] the doctrine of water baptism in the
[1:33:50] name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:33:51] city of Chicago,
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:54] nobody would COME AND GET BESIDE HIM. We
[1:33:56] heard this said recently. The reason for
[1:33:58] it is because the spirits that were
[1:34:00] anointing those boys knew that they were
[1:34:02] coming in the spirit. They were coming
[1:34:05] in the atmosphere in the presence of
[1:34:07] deity. Not just with William Brham. But
[1:34:10] the angel, the presence of the Lord
[1:34:12] meant death. And some people would say,
[1:34:15] well, how can you prove it? Nope, I
[1:34:16] can't.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; I just believe it, that's all.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; He was deity.
[1:34:23] showed that he was for he said if I do
[1:34:25] not the works of my father then don't
[1:34:27] believe me and and could not the
[1:34:29] Christian say today if I do not the
[1:34:32] works of my savior believe me not see
[1:34:36] I'll call the musicians
[1:34:39] saying this for a reason brothers and
[1:34:40] sisters I believe he's calling us to the
[1:34:43] highest level a Christian has ever been
[1:34:45] called to on this earth
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; if we've been given the entire open book
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; all of the seals open the fullness of
[1:34:54] the word in the day in which we live.
[1:34:58] Could not the Christian say today, if I
[1:35:01] do not the works of my savior,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Believe me not.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; I believe this with all my heart,
[1:35:10] brothers and sisters. If we can't say
[1:35:12] that, then we're just we're just acting
[1:35:14] Christian.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying that in a way that I
[1:35:17] want to try and and scare us or scold us
[1:35:19] and make us feel like we're not doing
[1:35:21] anything right. I want to say just keep
[1:35:23] going, just keep pressing on, but
[1:35:25] remember there's something greater in
[1:35:27] store for you if you're willing to
[1:35:29] surrender fully to the word of God. He
[1:35:31] goes on to say, as the father sent me,
[1:35:32] so send I you. And if you do the works,
[1:35:35] creation works of the father that sent
[1:35:38] him, then it's a creation. The Christ,
[1:35:41] the creator that sends us does the works
[1:35:45] of Christ the creator. See,
[1:35:48] now I'm not saying let's go out and
[1:35:50] create. Let's go out and and do some
[1:35:53] funny business. Let's go and show.
[1:35:54] Remember, there's there's accounts of it
[1:35:57] in in the New Testament.
[1:35:59] People wanting to make a show of the of
[1:36:01] the spirit of Christ, of of the living
[1:36:04] God. People wanting to actually do that.
[1:36:06] I'm not saying that at all. But what I
[1:36:08] am saying is get yourself into a
[1:36:10] position where you know that you know
[1:36:12] where you can actually take the mantle
[1:36:14] of this word when you need it and you
[1:36:16] can strike the waters that are in your
[1:36:18] way and say, "Where is the God of Elijah
[1:36:21] for me?"
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; We need to know where we're at.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Then the Christian today has got to do
[1:36:31] the life that Christ did or we have the
[1:36:35] right to say it's not so.
[1:36:39] I'll tell you, when you have the hour of
[1:36:41] need, put it to the test and see if he's
[1:36:45] not God.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; We could go on and on. If you want to
[1:36:50] stand with me, we'll close tonight. I
[1:36:52] just want to say, brothers and sisters,
[1:36:53] God bless you. Merry Christmas. I think
[1:36:56] it's a wonderful thing. I had someone
[1:36:59] send me this quote today. And and in
[1:37:01] closing, [music] I I just thought it was
[1:37:03] so beautiful. She had no idea that I was
[1:37:05] studying from this message. This is from
[1:37:07] this message 63 12:22. God's gifts
[1:37:11] always find their places. [music] This
[1:37:13] is brother Brandham here and and I just
[1:37:15] want to say it exactly the same way that
[1:37:17] he said it. I'm not going to change one
[1:37:19] word. He says, "Now, if you'll bow your
[1:37:20] heads again,
[1:37:22] I want to wish each one of you a very
[1:37:26] merry Christmas.
[1:37:29] May the great Christmas present, the
[1:37:32] first one and the only and the original
[1:37:37] and the only one there is, Jesus Christ,
[1:37:41] be areshed in your heart tonight.
[1:37:45] May the Holy Spirit come to you and
[1:37:48] bring you ministering gifts and things
[1:37:51] from God
[1:37:54] that you a gift that you might live a
[1:37:57] better life.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I can testify brothers and sisters just
[1:38:03] by accepting this word in its fullness
[1:38:08] and saying I don't understand it. I
[1:38:09] can't I can't explain it. I don't
[1:38:12] understand why people behave the way
[1:38:13] they behave, but there's something about
[1:38:15] it that just attracts me.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; It will change your life. You live a
[1:38:20] better life. May the Holy Spirit come to
[1:38:24] you and bring you ministering gifts and
[1:38:26] things from God. A gift that you might
[1:38:29] live a better life. He says, "That's
[1:38:32] what I want. I would rather have the
[1:38:34] life of Christ in me to live sweet and
[1:38:39] victorious.
[1:38:41] Remember, we've been talking about gifts
[1:38:43] on Wednesdays.
[1:38:45] Sweet [snorts] and victorious than I
[1:38:46] would all the gifts of healing, the
[1:38:49] gifts of prophecies, all them other
[1:38:52] gifts. Just give me Jesus.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Let me live the life. The life is what I
[1:39:00] want to live. I want to live so others
[1:39:04] will know. [music]
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; And you know, brothers and sisters,
[1:39:09] that is the testimony of Jesus Christ,
[1:39:12] isn't it?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; The life that we live every single day
[1:39:17] that we interact in this world. That is
[1:39:19] the spirit of prophecy. That's that's
[1:39:22] prophetic utterance coming from our
[1:39:24] lives, not even our words. He says, "I
[1:39:27] want to live so others will know."
[1:39:29] That's my desire at Christmas. And I
[1:39:31] pray that's your desire. And I pray that
[1:39:34] God will give us his desire.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow. [music] Heavenly
[1:39:41] Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[1:39:43] your word. We thank you, Lord, that you
[1:39:45] chose to express yourself the way you
[1:39:48] did to this world. Father, we thank you
[1:39:51] that Lord 2,000 years ago,
[1:39:54] the manifestation
[1:39:56] of the prophetic utterance that came 700
[1:39:59] years earlier
[1:40:02] manifested.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you're the same
[1:40:05] yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:40:07] there's still a prophecy that's coming
[1:40:09] to this world that in a moment, in the
[1:40:11] twinkling of an eye, oh Father, there's
[1:40:14] going to be a rapture. There's going to
[1:40:17] be a change of our bodies. There's going
[1:40:20] to be those that come out of the grave.
[1:40:22] Oh, Father, we're going to meet with
[1:40:24] them as we meet with you in the clouds.
[1:40:27] We know that prophecy is imminent. That
[1:40:30] has to come to pass. And we are that
[1:40:32] generation that you've chosen, Lord.
[1:40:35] Father, if we can't be in it, we can see
[1:40:37] that it is so close. Either way, we
[1:40:41] thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you
[1:40:42] for the gift wrapped word that you've
[1:40:45] given us in the day in which we live.
[1:40:46] Help us, Lord, to unwrap it and to take
[1:40:48] [music] it into our lives, into our
[1:40:50] hearts, Father, that it would be the
[1:40:52] greatest gift that we could ever have,
[1:40:54] but Lord, not just keep for ourselves,
[1:40:55] but that we could share it with others,
[1:40:57] Lord.
