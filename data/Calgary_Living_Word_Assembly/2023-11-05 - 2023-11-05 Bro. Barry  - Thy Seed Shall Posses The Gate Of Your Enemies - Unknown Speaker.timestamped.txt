[51:54] scripture
[51:58] it's John
[52:02] 14 verse
[52:04] 20 at that
[52:06] day you shall
[52:10] know I am in my
[52:13] father and ye in
[52:16] me and I in you thank you
[52:19] thank it's a very powerful statement
[52:24] yes and when you've received the true
[52:26] revelation of that the knowing the
[52:29] Blessed Assurance it's perfect
[52:33] faith brother brandham preached acting
[52:35] recognizing or
[52:38] receiving and then acting that's in the
[52:41] acting of it I'm acting here today the
[52:46] Bible talks about all the great Saints
[52:47] by Faith by Faith by faith that is
[52:50] because they acted upon that knowing
[52:52] their position in Christ amen
[52:55] I wrote this poem about two months ago
[52:58] and in the last month been going
[53:01] through a trial but now I see it was
[53:05] would fully helped me
[53:08] understand we have to stop relying on
[53:10] our flesh to try and solve our
[53:13] problems and rely on that knowing that
[53:17] control
[53:19] tower when you receive that knowing all
[53:23] Hell Comes against you every little
[53:26] position and place he can maybe you
[53:28] might think it's through your wife or
[53:29] your kids actually through this
[53:32] flesh
[53:33] 99.99% of all my problems is this flesh
[53:37] yes the other 0 one% it's only because I
[53:42] allow him to have that through someone
[53:44] else but it's always this anyway the
[53:47] Lord wants us to understand who we are
[53:51] and this poem is called the full
[53:53] adoption process and it's a process yes
[53:57] so many times we forget that that it's a
[54:02] process in the depths of my soul I cried
[54:06] out to
[54:08] God seeking relief from my
[54:11] flaws a Divine
[54:13] nod but his response was
[54:17] unexpected a gentle
[54:20] refrain for he whispered to my heart
[54:23] it's for you to abstain
[54:26] I yearn for patience in a world of
[54:30] haste surprisingly God's
[54:33] response silence my desperate
[54:37] Chase patience cannot be
[54:40] granted my dear
[54:42] child it's
[54:44] obtained through your
[54:46] tribulations where you're
[54:49] beguiled I plead it for an end to my
[54:52] sorrows and pain hoping God would spare
[54:56] me my Strife that
[54:59] drains he answered softly suffering
[55:03] always draws you near to me your anchor
[55:08] removing all worldly
[55:10] fear in seeking spiritual
[55:13] growth my spirit to
[55:16] ignite I implored God to elevate me to
[55:20] Greater
[55:21] Heights Lord excuse me thankfully he
[55:25] replied with wisdom you must learn to
[55:29] submit to grow by my pruning and
[55:33] refining you'll surely flourish and
[55:37] glow with a heavy
[55:39] heart I ask God to make me
[55:42] whole to fill the empty spaces and mend
[55:46] my unfulfilled
[55:48] Soul again he acknowledged Me
[55:53] Gently please remember this your spirit
[55:56] is already complete your body a
[55:59] temporary vessel constantly in
[56:03] Retreat longing for Earthly
[56:06] Pleasures I made my
[56:08] plea to indulge in all things that would
[56:12] make me feel
[56:14] free God responded like only a father
[56:17] could I've given you my eternal
[56:21] breath in that
[56:23] realization find joy in all moments tell
[56:27] death as I thought sought true happiness
[56:31] a lasting
[56:32] sensation God's report brought Clarity
[56:36] erasing my
[56:39] frustrations happiness resides within
[56:42] it's an Outlook of Grace Choose Love
[56:46] count your blessings in all things wear
[56:50] Joy on your face it's a tough one
[56:53] sometimes amen but it's a true son and
[56:56] daughter stance yes it's what he wants
[56:59] us to learn and
[57:00] know recently I asked God to help me to
[57:03] love like

[1:15:52] scripture
[1:15:55] to look back through the sands of time

[1:16:09] kind of obedience today amen Lord Jesus
[1:16:12] we thank you for the many blessings
[1:16:14] associated with this scripture that
[1:16:15] we've read this morning Father that
[1:16:17] apply to our lives and we pray that you
[1:16:19] would just take this scripture and open
[1:16:21] it fresh to us Lord that you would just
[1:16:23] feed us of yourself that bread of life
[1:16:26] once again that comes down from heaven

[1:16:37] pray amen amen God bless you this
[1:16:40] morning you may be
[1:16:52] seated
[1:16:56] it's just wonderful to be in his
[1:16:58] presence does
[1:17:01] something you know brother bradam says
[1:17:03] if you've got a religion that's
[1:17:06] dead you better go bury
[1:17:09] it and get one that's
[1:17:12] alive you know in our scripture this
[1:17:15] morning I just uh I want to talk about
[1:17:18] thy seed shall possess the Gate of his
[1:17:22] enemies once again I want to continue on
[1:17:25] with what we were talking about last
[1:17:27] Sunday and I think it's just so
[1:17:28] beautiful how there is a seed that will
[1:17:31] possess the Gate of his enemy we know
[1:17:34] this is an Old Testament Prophecy from
[1:17:37] nearly the beginning of the entire Bible
[1:17:40] but we know that it's just as effective
[1:17:42] as the very last part of the Bible in
[1:17:45] Revelation we know that all of it
[1:17:48] applies to our lives even today yes
[1:17:52] before before we get too far I just want
[1:17:54] to announce that we've got the ladies
[1:17:55] brunch coming up this Saturday the 11th
[1:17:58] from 10:30 to 1:30 at our house um I'm
[1:18:01] sure all the details are worked out with
[1:18:03] the sisters um we have a communion
[1:18:05] service Sunday uh the next day next
[1:18:08] weekend it's going to be at 6:00 pm and
[1:18:11] we have a youth meeting Sunday the 19th
[1:18:15] I believe it's from 1: till 5:00 pm at
[1:18:17] the clant and we have the uh the very
[1:18:21] special privilege of having brother
[1:18:23] Jerry Fox coming to present uh his
[1:18:26] testimony and some encouragement to the
[1:18:28] youth Hallelujah and I believe that the
[1:18:31] uh parents of the children uh whoever
[1:18:34] would be interested are invited to come
[1:18:35] as well which I think is such an
[1:18:37] important thing for the parents to be
[1:18:40] involved uh you know that every single
[1:18:42] parent here has a testimony and uh has
[1:18:47] the ability to encourage but also to be
[1:18:50] encouraged and it's just so important
[1:18:52] for the parents to see what's actually
[1:18:54] happening in the lives of the youth when
[1:18:56] they get together so God bless you
[1:18:58] brother Joel and Sister Crystal for
[1:19:00] putting that together and uh we
[1:19:03] certainly are excited to see what the
[1:19:04] Lord will
[1:19:05] do I have uh couple of places that I'm
[1:19:09] going to read from the message
[1:19:11] today and uh as mentioned I I just got
[1:19:15] so inspired talking about the the Gates
[1:19:18] of Hell shall not Prevail against that
[1:19:20] revelation we talked about um just
[1:19:24] talking about the gates of hell and we
[1:19:26] know that there's a there's a seed we
[1:19:28] read it in the scripture this morning
[1:19:29] out of Genesis CH 22 that there is a
[1:19:32] seed that shall possess the Gate of his
[1:19:34] enemy the enemy isn't going to come and
[1:19:36] possess our gates not the seed of the
[1:19:39] True Believer and we're not just talking
[1:19:40] about any seed we're talking about the
[1:19:42] Royal Seed of Abraham it it's a
[1:19:44] spiritual seed and we'll get into that
[1:19:47] but you know out of the message
[1:19:48] possessing the enemy's gates in 1959
[1:19:52] it's it's uh 59
[1:19:55] 1108 brother bradam he says he shall
[1:19:58] possess the seed of his
[1:20:02] enemy and I think it's just beautiful
[1:20:04] I'm going to pause there for a second
[1:20:06] while they bring it up
[1:20:07] because they he shall possess the seed
[1:20:11] of his
[1:20:12] enemy and and that to me is uh is that a
[1:20:15] mistake maybe some people would say well
[1:20:17] it's a mistake because he didn't say he
[1:20:19] shall possess his seed shall possess the
[1:20:22] Gate of his enemy he says he shall
[1:20:25] possess the seed of his enemy and I
[1:20:28] personally believe that that's saying
[1:20:30] that he's going to Prevail he's going to
[1:20:33] overcome and and you know we can look at
[1:20:36] it naturally we know the natural types
[1:20:38] the spiritual and the Old Testament is
[1:20:40] the shadow of the New Testament and both
[1:20:43] of those are the shadow of our spiritual
[1:20:45] walk as Believers we we can see that
[1:20:48] there's shadows and types all through
[1:20:49] the Bible but you know when we talk
[1:20:51] about possessing the gat GES of the
[1:20:53] enemy today we're not talking about
[1:20:55] possessing the gates of Gaza we're not
[1:20:57] talking about possessing the gates of
[1:20:58] Israel we're not talking about
[1:20:59] possessing the gates of Calgary or
[1:21:01] Alberta or BC or Saskatchewan we're
[1:21:04] talking about possessing the gates of
[1:21:05] the Devils that want to come against our
[1:21:07] marriage they want to come against our
[1:21:09] children that want to come against our
[1:21:11] brothers and our sisters about their own
[1:21:13] Revelation about what it means to be a
[1:21:15] part of the body of Christ we want to
[1:21:17] come against those Gates those gates are
[1:21:20] the ones that are after us and those
[1:21:21] gates are de
[1:21:23] the Devils want to destroy us and we
[1:21:25] talked about this last week how those
[1:21:27] gates are flapping and slamming and
[1:21:29] making lots of noise in this world and
[1:21:31] we can't look anywhere in this world
[1:21:32] without seeing a Gate of Hell right
[1:21:35] because that's what's happening here
[1:21:36] this is a spiritual battle Satan is
[1:21:39] going to take as many people to hell
[1:21:40] with him as he can we know that Satan
[1:21:43] that that that hell was created for the
[1:21:45] devil and his angels but we know the
[1:21:47] mouth of Hell had to be enlarged for all
[1:21:49] those people that choose to reject the
[1:21:52] word for their their
[1:21:56] day but he shall possess the seed of his
[1:21:59] enemy we got it there beautiful thank
[1:22:03] you brother Logan he shall posed he
[1:22:05] shall possess the seed of his enemy he
[1:22:10] shall possess he'll he'll have it he'll
[1:22:13] control it it will become his property
[1:22:16] it won't be something that owns him but
[1:22:18] he rather will own it he shall possess
[1:22:23] his seed shall possess the Gate of his
[1:22:27] enemy and and I love how brother
[1:22:29] brandham goes into this now and and I
[1:22:31] just want to do this other background
[1:22:32] here I think it's really important
[1:22:34] brothers and sisters for us to recognize
[1:22:35] that as we as parents we have the
[1:22:38] ability to affect a many generation down
[1:22:41] the road from our lives we can look at
[1:22:44] our life and say well I can have
[1:22:46] pitfalls and stumbles and and I can have
[1:22:48] hard times in my life in my day but our
[1:22:50] actions today are very much affecting
[1:22:53] the actions the livelihood the abilities
[1:22:56] of the seed that's coming after us many
[1:22:59] generations after us not just the here
[1:23:01] and now but but our sons and our
[1:23:03] daughters and and their children and our
[1:23:05] grandchildren and our
[1:23:06] great-grandchildren he says he shall
[1:23:09] possess his seed shall possess the Gate
[1:23:12] of his Enemy No matter what the gate is
[1:23:16] if it's
[1:23:16] sickness he's going to possess that gate
[1:23:20] if it's
[1:23:21] Temptations that seed is going to
[1:23:24] possess that
[1:23:27] gate if it's
[1:23:30] sin that seed is going to possess that
[1:23:32] gate he says whatever gate it is it's
[1:23:36] conquered amen there's not something
[1:23:39] that we have to conquer we just have to
[1:23:40] accept that he's conquered it already
[1:23:46] amen says it's conquered and the Seed of
[1:23:50] Abraham possesses
[1:23:53] it so I just got thinking about this
[1:23:56] Abraham seed and it's just beautiful the
[1:23:59] story's beautiful and I know we can go a
[1:24:01] long long ways with it we've got a
[1:24:03] limited amount of time actually no we
[1:24:05] don't I think we still have another
[1:24:08] additional hour amen praise the Lord
[1:24:11] bring it on it's beautiful bring it on
[1:24:14] it's a
[1:24:17] miracle Abraham SE there's a natural
[1:24:19] lineage and we know there's a spiritual
[1:24:21] lineage I'm going to go on in this
[1:24:23] message here and uh I'm just going to
[1:24:25] say this one one part here that brother
[1:24:27] Bram he says but the promise of God is
[1:24:30] good at every gate so brothers and
[1:24:34] sisters when we come to Gates in our
[1:24:35] lives when we come to problems in our
[1:24:37] lives when we're alone and we find that
[1:24:39] Temptation becomes overwhelming what
[1:24:42] we're doing is walking along our journey
[1:24:44] and we're coming to a gate and when we
[1:24:46] get to that gate what we need to do is
[1:24:48] pull out the token the token is like the
[1:24:51] key fob that we see to today the key fob
[1:24:53] to the gate that token is going to open
[1:24:56] that gate and what's going to happen
[1:24:58] when that gate opens it's going to show
[1:24:59] that we possess that gate because the
[1:25:02] one who has the controller for that gate
[1:25:04] possesses that gate and we have the
[1:25:07] controller for every single devil that
[1:25:09] wants to try and come against us every
[1:25:12] single time we come against the devil we
[1:25:15] have the ability to possess that devil
[1:25:17] not that we want to take that devil and
[1:25:19] actually do anything with it other than
[1:25:21] rebuke it but it means control to
[1:25:23] possess we have the ability to control
[1:25:26] that devil now now we're not looking to
[1:25:28] control Devils we don't want to have pet
[1:25:30] Devils I'm not saying that what I'm
[1:25:32] saying is we're going to have them get
[1:25:33] in our way and they're going to start to
[1:25:35] boast just like David encountered that
[1:25:38] giant the Giants are going to boast in
[1:25:40] in our land and we know there's three
[1:25:42] Giants there's the lust of the flesh
[1:25:44] there's the lust of the eyes and there's
[1:25:46] the worst one of all brothers and
[1:25:48] sisters pride of life the one that's got
[1:25:50] the pride of life he'll say oh I don't
[1:25:53] suffer from either one of those two but
[1:25:55] he's the one that suffers the worst
[1:25:56] because he thinks he's
[1:25:59] okay yes but you know we've got a
[1:26:02] scripture we'll get into that a little
[1:26:03] bit later but we're looking at
[1:26:05] possessing the enemy's Gates the brandom
[1:26:07] says but the promise of God is good at
[1:26:09] every gate no matter what gate it is
[1:26:12] God's promise is good he shall possess
[1:26:15] the gates of his enemy that settles
[1:26:18] it love that when he come down to the
[1:26:21] Jordan
[1:26:22] morning talking about Joshua and how
[1:26:26] they went across into the promised land
[1:26:28] they were raised up in bondage all they
[1:26:31] knew was bondage these people they
[1:26:33] weren't born in Freedom they were born
[1:26:36] in bondage 430 years in bondage so they
[1:26:40] didn't know anything but a slave
[1:26:42] master's Whip and brother bradam talks
[1:26:44] about we know the story so well that the
[1:26:46] Egyptians could just do whatever they
[1:26:48] wanted to do with anyone at any time and
[1:26:50] there was nothing the children of Israel
[1:26:52] could do they were in full-on bondage
[1:26:54] and we know it's a type of us today
[1:26:56] mentally speaking outside of the baptism
[1:26:59] of the Holy Ghost which brother Bram
[1:27:00] calls the new birth outside of that
[1:27:02] happening in our lives we are very much
[1:27:05] under the bondage of the task Master's
[1:27:07] whip in our lives mentally speaking we
[1:27:10] will never overcome but boy oh boy if we
[1:27:13] could ever surrender to that place where
[1:27:15] we recognize what he's done for us when
[1:27:18] we realize the baptism of the holy
[1:27:20] spirit for ourselves in our lives which
[1:27:22] is the New Birth when that happens
[1:27:24] something happens we begin to possess
[1:27:26] the gates of our enemies but brother
[1:27:29] Bram in this message he's talking about
[1:27:31] Joshua now going down to the Jordan
[1:27:32] River knowing that God came to him and
[1:27:35] told him be really strong and courageous
[1:27:37] and don't worry because just like I was
[1:27:39] with Moses I'm going to be with you and
[1:27:41] I'm going to mag magnify myself in you
[1:27:43] today before all the people I want them
[1:27:45] to see that I am calling you and so what
[1:27:48] did he do he called them down to cross
[1:27:50] the Jordan River when it was the most
[1:27:54] flooded but here we have the children of
[1:27:57] Israel now called out of bondage and now
[1:27:59] we've got Moses is dead the guy that
[1:28:01] called us out is dead now we're out here
[1:28:03] as good as dead and now this next guy
[1:28:06] he's raised up and says that he's got a
[1:28:08] revelation from God and now he wants to
[1:28:10] take us into a flood are you serious
[1:28:13] imagine how people started to reason
[1:28:15] looking at the natural
[1:28:17] circumstances brother Bram he says now
[1:28:19] when he come down to that Jordan that
[1:28:21] morning perhaps I'm going to believe
[1:28:23] that the devil had storm clouds hanging
[1:28:26] everywhere natural
[1:28:29] circumstances oh my we can see the
[1:28:32] natural all around us and if we're not
[1:28:35] careful we'll actually let the natural
[1:28:37] consume us the natural will start to
[1:28:40] drive our spiritual walk if we're not
[1:28:43] careful
[1:28:45] amen I'm going to believe the devil had
[1:28:47] storm clouds hanging everywhere the big
[1:28:49] old muddy waters I roll falling down the
[1:28:52] fields were swept across by a flood oh
[1:28:56] what a tempting time but Joshua said get
[1:28:59] ready you're going to see the glory of
[1:29:03] God and they Sanctified themselves and
[1:29:06] got ready making everything when
[1:29:10] everything seemed to be
[1:29:12] contrary but that was the seat of
[1:29:15] Abraham those ones that just had an
[1:29:18] ability not of their own to call the
[1:29:21] things that were as though they weren't
[1:29:24] and to call the things that weren't as
[1:29:25] though they were they recognize that
[1:29:28] there's a promised land for us there's
[1:29:30] an ability to go forwards because God's
[1:29:32] called us and and we can't explain it
[1:29:35] how can you explain it when God's called
[1:29:37] you you
[1:29:38] can't the only thing you can do is March
[1:29:40] forward by
[1:29:43] faith but that was the Seed of Abraham
[1:29:46] who God swore I'll give him the gate
[1:29:50] when he come to the Jordan that was his
[1:29:52] gate and he possessed it now imagine if
[1:29:56] we just take that story a little bit
[1:29:57] further when they did go across and they
[1:30:00] went across on dry land and there was 12
[1:30:02] Stones that were picked up one for every
[1:30:04] tribe and and they created that that
[1:30:06] altar there they they showed that God
[1:30:09] did something for them so that their
[1:30:10] children and their children's children
[1:30:12] could go back to that place and say
[1:30:14] remember that time that we were called
[1:30:15] to go across into the promised land we
[1:30:18] we were given the ability to get the
[1:30:19] Holy Ghost now we can go back to that
[1:30:21] place and look at that pile of rocks now
[1:30:23] I say it this way those rocks of
[1:30:25] Revelation that there is a holy ghost
[1:30:27] for us to have sometimes in our lives
[1:30:29] we've got to do that we've got to pile
[1:30:31] up those those those rocks of Revelation
[1:30:33] that God gives us so that we've got a
[1:30:35] place to go back to to say I remember
[1:30:37] that time God spoke to me brother bradam
[1:30:40] says it clearly that God might only
[1:30:41] speak to us one time in our lives amen
[1:30:43] and that's all and are we willing to act
[1:30:46] on that one time that he spoke to us but
[1:30:49] you know I believe it myself as the
[1:30:51] royal Seed of Abraham not that I'm
[1:30:53] making myself anything I just can't help
[1:30:55] but think that every single one of us
[1:30:57] would be the same description that we're
[1:30:59] all the Royal Seed of Abraham and that
[1:31:01] every time God speaks to us we want to
[1:31:03] hear his voice more amen so we walk
[1:31:06] towards him and we know that he says if
[1:31:08] you draw nigh unto me I will draw nigh
[1:31:11] unto you he doesn't just keep stepping
[1:31:13] backwards every time we step forwards he
[1:31:15] steps forward also he wants to have that
[1:31:18] relationship with
[1:31:20] us but there is a people that Sanctified
[1:31:23] themselves here and and they made ready
[1:31:25] they made everything ready when it
[1:31:26] seemed to be contrary and brother bam
[1:31:28] says they went and and they possessed
[1:31:30] the gate they went across the river but
[1:31:31] now they come to a place that's just a
[1:31:34] fortifi fortified Fortress brother
[1:31:36] bradam said the walls around Jericho was
[1:31:38] the very next place we know that Joshua
[1:31:40] was out and he was probably just having
[1:31:42] a little bit of meditation time he was
[1:31:45] away from everyone and suddenly he sees
[1:31:47] a man standing there and what did he do
[1:31:49] he he did exactly what he was instructed
[1:31:51] to to do right he was strong and
[1:31:53] courageous and he ran towards the man
[1:31:55] and he said to him are you for us or are
[1:31:57] you against us and we know that he said
[1:32:00] nay but I'm I'm captain of the Lord's
[1:32:02] host oh my and the ground that you're
[1:32:05] standing on buddy is Holy Ground so just
[1:32:07] take off those shoes and demonstrate to
[1:32:09] me just like Moses did that you
[1:32:11] understand who you're talking to and we
[1:32:13] know that he did that and he was given
[1:32:15] the instructions through that meeting to
[1:32:16] go and take
[1:32:18] Jericho Jericho being heavily fortified
[1:32:21] another gate a giant gate big iron gates
[1:32:24] on it you can imagine wooden iron gates
[1:32:27] while so big they raised chariots on top
[1:32:29] brother bram's said can you imagine that
[1:32:33] but they were given the key to it they
[1:32:35] were given the key fob to that gate
[1:32:37] weren't they and all they had to do was
[1:32:39] March forwards and follow the
[1:32:41] instructions and it's interesting
[1:32:42] because the instructions were shut your
[1:32:44] mouths and March around don't say a word
[1:32:48] until I tell you to say a word just
[1:32:51] March around and blow the horns once
[1:32:54] March around blow the horns once just
[1:32:56] keep doing that until the time is right
[1:32:59] and on the seventh day March around and
[1:33:01] then lift up your voice because your
[1:33:03] salvation is here you know what they
[1:33:05] weren't told to be quiet to see the
[1:33:07] victory in that instance right to take
[1:33:09] that gate they were told to Rejoice to
[1:33:12] shout with a loud voice make a loud
[1:33:14] noise I can't help but think brothers
[1:33:17] and sisters how much more Sons and
[1:33:18] Daughters of the most high God who have
[1:33:20] been given the ability to recognize all
[1:33:22] these Mysteries have just been given to
[1:33:24] us freely in the book and alls we've got
[1:33:26] to do is just say Amen to the word how
[1:33:28] much more should we raise our voice to
[1:33:31] the Lord hallelujah I just can't help
[1:33:34] but think because they followed it they
[1:33:36] followed the instruction the letter of
[1:33:37] the instruction they followed it they
[1:33:40] had the possession of that gate they
[1:33:42] took Jericho and they did nothing for it
[1:33:44] the only thing they did was follow the
[1:33:46] instruction because they followed that
[1:33:48] instruction all those walls just fell
[1:33:50] down and they marched right in and they
[1:33:52] completely took over and spoiled that
[1:33:54] City and you know what it's the same way
[1:33:56] for the devils in our lives brothers and
[1:33:58] sisters there's no devil that can
[1:33:59] actually hold have a stronghold in our
[1:34:02] lives We are tearing down strongholds
[1:34:06] that's what we're doing in our day and I
[1:34:09] think it's beautiful because we have so
[1:34:11] much Revelation it's like brother Larry
[1:34:13] said this morning oh in his prayer to
[1:34:15] know really where we
[1:34:17] are look at the rest of the world it's
[1:34:21] Fallen
[1:34:22] apart we were talking about having maybe
[1:34:25] a bit of a renovation here in this
[1:34:26] building and to have an elevator to take
[1:34:29] us up and wouldn't it be nice but what
[1:34:32] about a a light speed elevator brothers
[1:34:34] and sisters that's just going to take us
[1:34:35] to another dimension and that's going to
[1:34:37] happen in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:34:39] eye we've never been closer to it amen
[1:34:43] so I want to say this today if we have
[1:34:45] the ability to hear the word for our day
[1:34:47] brothers and sisters don't give up don't
[1:34:49] don't get tired don't get weary now this
[1:34:51] is is the time to get excited because
[1:34:53] instead of actually going down we're
[1:34:56] going
[1:34:57] up and and it's a blending of the
[1:34:59] dimensions it's not something that's
[1:35:01] just suddenly an event is going to
[1:35:03] cataclysmically happen in the airplanes
[1:35:05] and Trains and Automobiles and
[1:35:07] everything is just going to fall apart
[1:35:09] like that we know the world is falling
[1:35:11] apart but what we're doing is we're
[1:35:12] blending the dimensions we're hearing
[1:35:14] from our theophanies we're getting the
[1:35:15] ability to say Amen because we know that
[1:35:18] we have another representation we look
[1:35:20] at this flesh and we say this
[1:35:22] seed this seed is a natural seed oh my
[1:35:25] this seed has nothing this seed has no
[1:35:28] there's no way this seed could inherit
[1:35:30] incorruption and that's what the word of
[1:35:32] God says
[1:35:34] incorruption corruption cannot inherit
[1:35:36] incorruption we know that's the
[1:35:39] case we're talking today about the the
[1:35:42] seed shall possess the Gate of his
[1:35:45] enemies amen if we can follow the word
[1:35:47] of God for our day then then the seed
[1:35:50] will possess the Gate of his
[1:35:56] enemies brother bradam in the exposition
[1:35:59] of the seven Church ages the saman
[1:36:01] church
[1:36:03] age says did not Jesus
[1:36:06] say in John
[1:36:09] 6:49 your fathers did eat Mana in the
[1:36:12] wilderness and are
[1:36:14] dead those parents that died were
[1:36:18] necessary as the forefathers of the
[1:36:21] people to whom Jesus was
[1:36:24] speaking they
[1:36:25] perished yet they were in the election
[1:36:28] of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb
[1:36:31] were
[1:36:33] spiritually isn't it wonderful to think
[1:36:35] that we can we can read this and
[1:36:38] understand that we have in our day a a
[1:36:42] prophet that would give prophetic
[1:36:44] insight and and preach a message called
[1:36:47] the seed shall not be air with the shu
[1:36:51] but remember in that message he also
[1:36:54] says without the Shu there can't be a
[1:36:57] seed I don't think he says it exactly
[1:36:59] like that but that's one thing that I
[1:37:01] took away from it so don't get me wrong
[1:37:03] I'm not trying to misquote the prophet
[1:37:05] because he might not say that exactly
[1:37:06] word for word but what I am saying
[1:37:08] brothers and sisters is without a shock
[1:37:10] there's no seed but the seed will create
[1:37:13] a shock because that's part of the
[1:37:15] genetic code in the seed it has to have
[1:37:17] something that will actually protect it
[1:37:20] and we know by election there's people
[1:37:23] in this world that just don't have the
[1:37:25] ability or never did have the ability to
[1:37:27] see the things that we see but blessed
[1:37:29] are your eyes brothers and sisters
[1:37:31] blessed are our eyes for they see the
[1:37:33] things of God we know that the disciples
[1:37:35] asked Jesus why do you speak in Parables
[1:37:37] all the time why do you keep doing that
[1:37:39] and he said because it's not given to
[1:37:40] everyone to understand because if it was
[1:37:43] then they would be able to see and they
[1:37:44] would be able to hear and then they
[1:37:46] would be healed but it's not according
[1:37:48] to election amen God has a an an
[1:37:51] election he has a course he has a a
[1:37:53] direction that he wants to do things and
[1:37:55] it's not for everyone that's why I think
[1:37:57] we should be the happiest people on
[1:37:59] Earth to recognize what God's done for
[1:38:02] us it's not just a matter of saying I
[1:38:05] believe the message of the hour oh my
[1:38:07] I'm saved it's great I I I associate
[1:38:10] with Calgary Living Word or I associate
[1:38:12] with another group of people those are
[1:38:14] the things that are going to put you
[1:38:15] into tribulation but when you can say I
[1:38:17] found the pearl of great price through
[1:38:19] the message of the hour the Lord Jesus
[1:38:21] Christ himself has revealed himself to
[1:38:23] me my goodness brothers and sisters then
[1:38:26] it's different then you are actually
[1:38:29] catching the awareness of what it means
[1:38:31] to see the election of God naturally as
[1:38:34] Joshua and Caleb were spiritually am
[1:38:37] brother Bram goes on to say but to go on
[1:38:40] these elect were not only the Eternal
[1:38:43] thoughts of God which were to be
[1:38:47] expressed in flesh in their due season
[1:38:50] but these same same elect are called by
[1:38:53] another name in Romans 4:16 therefore it
[1:38:57] is of faith that it might be by grace to
[1:39:02] the end the promise might be sure to all
[1:39:06] the
[1:39:07] seed understanding that it is what God
[1:39:11] did by The Obedience of One Way Way Back
[1:39:14] which is giving those children who are
[1:39:16] the promised seed further ahead the
[1:39:19] ability to inherit the blessing they
[1:39:21] never did anything for
[1:39:23] it so if we can recognize that we are
[1:39:26] royal Seed of Abraham brothers and
[1:39:28] sisters it's only by grace that we're
[1:39:30] saved through faith because we believe
[1:39:32] in this word but how do we believe it's
[1:39:36] only by God it's only by Revelation that
[1:39:38] we heard we know that Peter he said to
[1:39:41] Jesus when he asked him that question he
[1:39:43] said he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:39:45] of the Living God Jesus said Flesh and
[1:39:47] Blood never revealed that to you that
[1:39:48] was a revelation that was something that
[1:39:50] came from God directly to you Peter but
[1:39:53] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[1:39:57] the gates of hell they won't Prevail
[1:39:59] against that it wasn't that the gates of
[1:40:00] hell wouldn't Prevail against Peter and
[1:40:02] that they wouldn't Prevail against him
[1:40:04] being a disciple and that they wouldn't
[1:40:06] Prevail against the church that those
[1:40:08] Gates of Hell wouldn't Prevail against
[1:40:10] the Revelation about who Jesus Christ is
[1:40:12] to the individual once that Revelation
[1:40:15] strikes the heart the gates of hell
[1:40:17] can't Prevail brothers and
[1:40:18] sisters going back to the scripture here
[1:40:21] Romans 4:16 therefore it is of faith
[1:40:24] that it might be grace to the end the
[1:40:27] promise might be sure to all the seed
[1:40:30] that word sure just jumped out at me and
[1:40:32] I thought why why is that sure it's be
[1:40:35] be be bias be bias and it's it's from
[1:40:40] the base of G3 J from the base of G 939
[1:40:45] through Strong's Concordance it says
[1:40:47] through the idea of
[1:40:49] basal the foundation I'm
[1:40:53] saying
[1:40:54] stable literally or figuratively firm of
[1:40:59] force steadfast
[1:41:02] sure that word sure it's made sure why
[1:41:06] is it made sure it's made sure so that
[1:41:09] it is to all of the seed now many times
[1:41:13] people will get caught up in looking at
[1:41:15] the natural seed and say the natural
[1:41:19] seed I I'm of the natural seed of so and
[1:41:22] so we know there was a group of people
[1:41:23] that said well we're the natural lineage
[1:41:26] of Abraham yeah he was our father we
[1:41:30] know exactly who he was but who are you
[1:41:32] you claimed to be someone and you're
[1:41:34] acting all spiritual and Pious before us
[1:41:37] but who are you we know who Abraham
[1:41:40] was isn't that interesting brother
[1:41:43] brandham goes on to say here I'm getting
[1:41:45] ahead of myself he goes on to say not to
[1:41:47] that only which is of the law but to
[1:41:50] that also which is of the faith of
[1:41:52] Abraham it's the same scripture he's
[1:41:54] continuing on with it who is the father
[1:41:56] of us all how can he be the father of us
[1:42:00] all when we're way down through time and
[1:42:02] and history though there's a group of
[1:42:04] people that claim he was the father of
[1:42:06] them Romans
[1:42:08] 97-113 says neither because they are the
[1:42:11] Seed of Abraham are they all
[1:42:16] children but in Isaac shall thy seed be
[1:42:20] called
[1:42:21] and we know that that was the one
[1:42:23] promised son that was the one where the
[1:42:25] promise lied we know that that Abraham
[1:42:29] and Sarah they tried to make it work on
[1:42:31] their own God gave the promise but they
[1:42:33] said you know maybe it's just not
[1:42:34] working Sarah came and said you know
[1:42:37] honey maybe God's just tired and maybe
[1:42:39] it's just not going to happen the way
[1:42:41] that that you interpreted that he said
[1:42:43] it to you maybe he said it and you just
[1:42:45] thought it a different way maybe you had
[1:42:47] a dream and it was just a little bit
[1:42:48] funny and you know we could just make it
[1:42:50] happen I could see how we could connect
[1:42:51] the dots here and make this happen
[1:42:53] you'll have a son don't worry right here
[1:42:56] we have the natural solution for the
[1:42:58] spiritual problem the spiritual equation
[1:43:01] God saying that there will be a sun and
[1:43:04] it will be of your loins it won't come
[1:43:07] from the outside there won't be a
[1:43:09] natural solution to it and so many times
[1:43:12] I just can't help but think brothers and
[1:43:13] sisters in our lives we're looking for a
[1:43:15] natural solution to a spiritual problem
[1:43:18] and God will keep us wandering in the
[1:43:20] Wilderness as we do that looking for
[1:43:23] those spiritual Solutions through
[1:43:25] natural places we won't find it that way
[1:43:29] neither because they are the Seed of
[1:43:31] Abraham are they all children but in
[1:43:33] Isaac shall thy seed be called that is
[1:43:36] they which are the children of the flesh
[1:43:39] these are not the children of God but
[1:43:41] the children of the promise are counted
[1:43:44] for the seed now when I was studying
[1:43:46] this I just couldn't help but think
[1:43:48] about Romans chapter 8 there is
[1:43:50] therefore now no condemnation to who to
[1:43:54] those who are not walking after the
[1:43:56] flesh but they're walking after the
[1:43:58] spirit right those who are in Christ
[1:44:02] Jesus who who walk not after the flesh
[1:44:04] but are walking in the spirit and you
[1:44:07] know there is a royal Seed of Abraham
[1:44:09] that is walking after the Lord Jesus
[1:44:12] that's not walking according to the
[1:44:14] flesh many times in our lives we can see
[1:44:16] the natural circumstances around us but
[1:44:19] are we willing to just press pause and
[1:44:21] ask the Lord to reveal to us how should
[1:44:23] we go about this how should we move
[1:44:26] forwards or are we trying to find the
[1:44:28] solution on our own are we just groping
[1:44:30] and and stumbling in darkness and
[1:44:32] finding that we're you we're up today
[1:44:35] and we're down tomorrow and we're up
[1:44:36] today and we're down tomorrow brothers
[1:44:39] and sisters that's no way for a Believer
[1:44:40] to live spiritually speaking we should
[1:44:44] have buoyancy we should have ballast in
[1:44:48] our lives we should be able to take on
[1:44:50] enough weight of the word in our lives
[1:44:52] to keep us stable when we hit those
[1:44:54] stormy waters in our boat of life but
[1:44:58] the only way we can do that is to stay
[1:45:00] in the
[1:45:01] word we talked about it I think it was
[1:45:03] on Wednesday if we start trying to feed
[1:45:06] the holy spirit in our life with the
[1:45:08] garbage of this world it ain't going to
[1:45:11] work right we're actually going to get
[1:45:13] spiritually sick and then we're going to
[1:45:14] see trials and then we're going to go in
[1:45:16] circles and we'll wander in the
[1:45:18] wilderness until we're willing to
[1:45:20] actually say okay Lord I'll take you at
[1:45:21] your word because we know that he speaks
[1:45:24] to us and we know that all we have to do
[1:45:26] is go back to where we got off so long
[1:45:28] as we're willing to do that he's right
[1:45:30] there waiting for
[1:45:32] us going on here brother bradam says for
[1:45:35] This Is The Word of Promise at this time
[1:45:37] will I come and Sarah shall have a son
[1:45:41] and not only this but when Rebecca had
[1:45:44] also conceived by one even by Our Father
[1:45:47] Isaac for the children being not yet
[1:45:50] born born neither having done any good
[1:45:53] or evil that the purpose of God
[1:45:55] according to election might
[1:45:58] stand not of works but of him that
[1:46:02] calleth am Hallelujah it was said unto
[1:46:06] her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as
[1:46:10] it was written Jacob have I loved but
[1:46:13] Esau have I
[1:46:15] hated can you imagine
[1:46:18] that I just think when I read that it
[1:46:21] makes me so humbled makes me think so so
[1:46:26] thankful so
[1:46:28] grateful so much gratitude for the Lord
[1:46:31] because I have the ability to hear this
[1:46:33] word it's not making me anything it's
[1:46:35] making me nothing it's making me realize
[1:46:38] outside of election I would be a sinner
[1:46:41] out there in the world just just lost as
[1:46:43] lost can be
[1:46:46] am but somehow he saw fit for me to be
[1:46:50] part of of another seed amen and and I
[1:46:53] believe the same thing for you brothers
[1:46:55] and sisters because you want to sit here
[1:46:57] and listen to these words talking about
[1:46:59] another seed and I think it's so
[1:47:01] beautiful because something has happened
[1:47:03] in our lives we've been given the rock
[1:47:06] of Revelation and the gates of hell
[1:47:08] can't Prevail against that and when the
[1:47:10] Devil comes around to try and tell us no
[1:47:13] I'm prevailing I'm prevailing you've got
[1:47:15] this or you're encountering that or
[1:47:17] whatever the other is we can say no I've
[1:47:20] got the token I've got the token in my
[1:47:22] life you can have this flesh take this
[1:47:24] flesh put me in the grave but you'll
[1:47:26] never kill me you'll never ever touch my
[1:47:29] soul and you could even go further with
[1:47:31] it and say you know what I'm going to
[1:47:33] actually go and be seated in that Throne
[1:47:36] right where you want to be Satan but
[1:47:37] you'll never be there because you chose
[1:47:40] to actually try and exalt yourself above
[1:47:43] that throne but now you're going to be
[1:47:45] brought down to Hell you'll be on the
[1:47:46] sides of the pit and and the people will
[1:47:48] walk by and wag their heads at you and
[1:47:50] say you're the one that troubled us all
[1:47:52] of our Lives you're the
[1:47:55] one that's scripture it's going to
[1:47:57] happen he knows it he knows it better
[1:47:59] than most theologians
[1:48:01] do Galatians 3:16 Says now to Abraham
[1:48:05] and his seed were made were the promises
[1:48:08] made he saith not unto seeds as of many
[1:48:12] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[1:48:16] Christ Galatians 3:29 and if ye be
[1:48:21] then ye are Abraham's seed and HS
[1:48:24] according to the promise for the longest
[1:48:27] time I wondered how how what's the
[1:48:28] connection there how could I be
[1:48:30] Abraham's seed how how is there but it's
[1:48:33] just right there brothers and sisters if
[1:48:35] you're in Christ then you are Abraham's
[1:48:37] seed because Christ is actually through
[1:48:39] the lineage of Abraham and and we know
[1:48:42] there's there's Brothers uh maybe
[1:48:44] brother mvin has that on the timeline I
[1:48:45] don't know but he is definitely in the
[1:48:47] lineage of Abraham Christ is
[1:48:50] is but here we have it in Galatians 3:29
[1:48:53] and if you be Christ if you're Christ
[1:48:55] this morning brothers and sisters then
[1:48:57] ye are Abraham's seed and HS according
[1:48:59] to the promise and HS that means
[1:49:02] according to the promise that's been
[1:49:03] given to this age to the Overcomers of
[1:49:06] the leodan age you're not going to go
[1:49:08] and stand around the throne you're going
[1:49:09] to be seated with him in his
[1:49:12] throne you're going to have full
[1:49:14] Authority and and and I want to say this
[1:49:17] I'm jumping ahead again but I believe it
[1:49:18] right now we have full Authority
[1:49:20] how many people have ever spoken words
[1:49:23] and then seen it come to pass many
[1:49:26] people in the world might say well it's
[1:49:27] just coincidence and we've done that too
[1:49:29] and you know how can you say that it's
[1:49:30] Hocus Pocus no it ain't no we're living
[1:49:33] under an anointing under this age and I
[1:49:35] believe that a lot of the world knows
[1:49:38] there's something going on but they
[1:49:39] don't understand it that's why they come
[1:49:41] out with with shows that are called
[1:49:43] Supernatural but isn't it interesting
[1:49:45] that there was none of that before there
[1:49:47] was a Vindicated prophet in the Land
[1:49:49] There was actually demonstrating
[1:49:51] Supernatural to this world
[1:49:53] Amen there's a purpose for it there's an
[1:49:56] anointing to this age and as we've said
[1:49:58] we'll say it again there's a blending of
[1:50:00] the ages we're blending ourselves to the
[1:50:03] place where we're realizing there's no
[1:50:04] Perfection that we're going to put on
[1:50:05] there's no Perfection that we're going
[1:50:07] to learn we're not going to go to
[1:50:08] obedience school and actually get this
[1:50:10] flesh into a place of perfection this
[1:50:12] flesh cannot ever be perfect this flesh
[1:50:15] is hybrid this flesh has to perish
[1:50:18] that's why we have to become a new
[1:50:20] creature in Christ Jesus first so that
[1:50:22] we can go and step into that new body
[1:50:24] when it comes down
[1:50:26] amen but we know brothers and sisters as
[1:50:29] we read in our scripture this morning
[1:50:30] over in in in Genesis chapter 22 that
[1:50:33] Abraham had lived his life he had been a
[1:50:37] faithful servant unto God God manifest
[1:50:40] in his life in such a tremendous fashion
[1:50:43] spoke to him as a friend we know that
[1:50:45] there's many different
[1:50:46] examples but God came and spoke to him
[1:50:50] and came and spoke to him and came and
[1:50:51] spoke to him and even introduced himself
[1:50:54] in the plains of mammory we know that
[1:50:56] happened and he had the ability through
[1:50:57] Revelation to recognize that that was
[1:50:59] God Elohim there with him and we know
[1:51:03] that he had the ability to say my Lord
[1:51:05] not Lords but there was others in Sodom
[1:51:08] and Gomorrah they didn't have the
[1:51:10] ability to recognize it and they said my
[1:51:12] lords we know that there's a lot of
[1:51:14] backstory to this story where we're at
[1:51:16] right now 25 years later after believing
[1:51:20] in the promise after being faithful
[1:51:22] after staggering not at the promise of
[1:51:25] God through unbelief but being strong
[1:51:28] and having good courage that the one who
[1:51:30] promised was able to deliver amen here
[1:51:33] he gets the
[1:51:34] promise and then God says to him now I
[1:51:37] want you to take that promise take your
[1:51:39] son that promised one and and kill him
[1:51:42] for
[1:51:43] me take him up to the top of the
[1:51:44] mountain that place that I'll show you
[1:51:46] and and kill him sacrifice him and we
[1:51:49] know we've talked about this in the past
[1:51:51] but I think it's just such an important
[1:51:53] thing I I want to make sure that we
[1:51:54] remember
[1:51:56] this how important it is that Abraham
[1:52:00] was given the instruction to go and kill
[1:52:03] his
[1:52:04] son and we started with the verse 10
[1:52:06] that said Abraham stretched forth his
[1:52:08] hand and took the knife to slay his son
[1:52:11] and we know that even his son said to
[1:52:12] him part of the conversation was his son
[1:52:15] recognized father here's the wood and
[1:52:18] and here's the flame but where's the
[1:52:21] sacrifice it doesn't add
[1:52:24] up and what did Abraham
[1:52:27] say he said my son don't worry that God
[1:52:31] God will provide himself a
[1:52:34] sacrifice it's not something that that
[1:52:37] we need to try and worry about don't
[1:52:39] trouble yourself with that son the son
[1:52:42] wouldn't have the ability to have the
[1:52:44] Revelation yet am even though the sun
[1:52:47] was reasoning according to the
[1:52:48] circumstances and imagine how heavy that
[1:52:51] must have weighed on Abraham in that
[1:52:53] moment oh my but we know the word says
[1:52:56] in that moment that he staggered not at
[1:52:58] the at the promise of God through
[1:53:00] unbelief he didn't say oh no what are we
[1:53:03] doing maybe we should just go and
[1:53:04] quickly grab something and bring it with
[1:53:05] us just in
[1:53:07] case no he followed the word of God to
[1:53:09] the letter he took his son up there and
[1:53:12] where we picked up is that he had gone
[1:53:14] 25 years now believing that God was able
[1:53:17] to give that promise that he told him
[1:53:19] about
[1:53:20] and now this promise is right here on
[1:53:22] the stone and he's just about to chop
[1:53:24] his throat comes back with a knife and
[1:53:26] he hears the angel of the Lord Abraham
[1:53:27] Abraham stop stop stop oh my now I know
[1:53:31] that you love
[1:53:32] me and we know we've talked about it it
[1:53:35] was actually Abraham learning that he
[1:53:38] loved him because God was God God knew
[1:53:40] all about it from the beginning of the
[1:53:41] world the foundation of the world he
[1:53:43] knew that Abraham was going to be that
[1:53:44] he knew that he was going to do that he
[1:53:45] knew he was going to follow him he knew
[1:53:47] all of that he's God right but Abraham
[1:53:50] needed to know that he loved God that
[1:53:53] much that he was willing to follow him
[1:53:54] to the letter of the word and because of
[1:53:57] that his seed shall possess the gates of
[1:54:01] his enemy what a tremendous blessing
[1:54:05] that is to think and then thy seed shall
[1:54:08] all the nations of the earth be blessed
[1:54:11] because thou Hast obeyed my voice isn't
[1:54:15] that wonderful to think about brothers
[1:54:16] and sisters we know what's going to
[1:54:18] happen when Grace is removed from this
[1:54:20] world we know that right now the Lord is
[1:54:22] actually pulling his anointing from the
[1:54:24] Gentile church that's lifting off of the
[1:54:27] Gentile church when you look all around
[1:54:29] and you see what's going on it's not
[1:54:31] good we can see it happening and that
[1:54:33] spirit is going to go right over to
[1:54:35] Israel while the world is surrounding
[1:54:37] Israel now they're pulling all their
[1:54:39] backing from Israel they're saying
[1:54:40] they're going too strong and and whatnot
[1:54:42] I'm not going political here but what I
[1:54:44] am saying is watch the demonstration of
[1:54:46] the Lord Jesus Christ when he gets over
[1:54:49] there and I trust we'll all be doing it
[1:54:51] from that other side from our theophany
[1:54:53] bodies we won't be here on Earth
[1:54:55] witnessing it through news feeds but
[1:54:57] we'll actually be witnessing it from
[1:54:59] heaven but I think we'll just be too
[1:55:01] busy worshiping because we'll know what
[1:55:03] the Lord has done for us we won't even
[1:55:05] be worried about the Earthly things
[1:55:06] we'll just be waiting for our our
[1:55:08] brothers to come and and just worship
[1:55:11] with us there right but you know
[1:55:13] brothers and sisters to think about this
[1:55:16] there is a spiritual blessing on the
[1:55:17] Earth today Hallelujah and this
[1:55:19] scripture here it says and in thy seed
[1:55:22] shall all the nations of the earth be
[1:55:25] blessed why would it be all of the
[1:55:27] nations of the
[1:55:29] earth goodness it's because there's a
[1:55:32] spiritual seed that's going to be in
[1:55:33] every single nation all around the world
[1:55:36] it's not just talking about the Jews
[1:55:37] here it's talking about the Royal Seed
[1:55:39] of Abraham those ones who are in Christ
[1:55:41] that we've already read about because
[1:55:43] those who are in Christ they are that
[1:55:45] Royal Seed of Abraham they're the ones
[1:55:49] who are counted worthy of the promise
[1:55:52] and not because of anything they done
[1:55:53] it's just because that God said hey
[1:55:55] before the foundation of the world I've
[1:55:56] chosen to love them and I've chosen to
[1:55:59] hate the other one now how can we
[1:56:01] explain that we can't explain it we just
[1:56:03] have to say Amen thank you Lord thank
[1:56:05] you Lord for calling me by my name thank
[1:56:08] you Lord for giving me salvation but you
[1:56:10] know in our lives brothers and sisters
[1:56:12] were no different than Abraham the only
[1:56:14] way we're going to see the blessing is
[1:56:15] to First go through the
[1:56:18] trial there ain't no free lunch in this
[1:56:20] world is there amen that's that's that's
[1:56:23] one thing that's said worldly but you
[1:56:25] know there's got to be a trial in our
[1:56:27] lives there's got to be a trial to prove
[1:56:30] God will allow the trials to come our
[1:56:32] way to prove his word in our lives he
[1:56:35] will allow the trials to come our way
[1:56:37] and I said it before I'll say it this
[1:56:39] time again I think it's so good so that
[1:56:40] he can squeeze Us in the trial and show
[1:56:44] who's on the inside because whoever's
[1:56:46] inside is going to come out in that
[1:56:47] squeeze brothers and sisters don't look
[1:56:50] for a a a a spiritual squeeze on the
[1:56:52] church look for the spiritual squeeze in
[1:56:54] our lives look for the spiritual squeeze
[1:56:57] in our lives and when it happens because
[1:56:59] it's not if it will when it will we want
[1:57:01] to make sure that the right one comes
[1:57:03] out that the Lord Jesus Christ on the
[1:57:05] inside comes out and says be it unto me
[1:57:07] according to thy will Lord if you want
[1:57:09] me to go through this Valley that I know
[1:57:11] you'll take my hand and you'll lead me
[1:57:13] right through this Valley and one of
[1:57:14] these days we'll find ourselves on the
[1:57:16] mountain top but we can't stay on the
[1:57:17] mountain top because nothing grows on
[1:57:19] the Mountaintop the only life is down in
[1:57:22] the valley but Lord lead me beside Still
[1:57:26] Waters oh Father take thy rod and thy
[1:57:29] staff and comfort me take me and and and
[1:57:31] prepare me a table before my
[1:57:34] enemies Lord just have your will and
[1:57:36] your way in my life don't leave me
[1:57:38] wandering around in the wilderness and
[1:57:41] he won't we know that he won't but
[1:57:42] that's the spiritual Seed of Abraham
[1:57:45] they're going to say the word of God
[1:57:47] they're going to live by that they going
[1:57:48] to prove through the trial who they are
[1:57:51] amen and he will show who is who
[1:57:55] amen it just got me thinking about it
[1:57:57] you know what we're doing we're just
[1:57:59] living in a proving ground right now
[1:58:00] that's all this is yes it is we're
[1:58:02] living in a Proving Ground and he's just
[1:58:03] proving his word amen we had a prophet
[1:58:06] preach that message proving his word and
[1:58:09] you know what that's what he's doing in
[1:58:10] our lives every single day every single
[1:58:12] day in our lives he's proving his word
[1:58:14] and it's not something that we can do
[1:58:16] it's not something that we even really
[1:58:18] desire to do is something that he does
[1:58:20] and it constrains us as prisoners of
[1:58:24] Christ just like Paul to actually
[1:58:26] surrender Our Lives surrender our Wills
[1:58:29] surrender every part of us unto him amen
[1:58:33] and it just makes me think you know we
[1:58:34] need to stop trying ourselves and just
[1:58:37] start
[1:58:39] speaking we need to start speaking the
[1:58:41] word brothers and sisters we're not
[1:58:43] we're not living under the the natural
[1:58:45] lineage of Abraham we're not living
[1:58:48] under the the the even the first and
[1:58:51] second polls according to William Mary
[1:58:52] and bram's message but we're living
[1:58:54] under the third pole we're third pole
[1:58:56] recipients here today the Royal Seed of
[1:59:00] Abraham we got to stop trying to do
[1:59:03] things on our own and start speaking and
[1:59:05] I'm not saying go out and and climb up
[1:59:08] on a fence or a an overpass and and and
[1:59:11] put our shoulders back and chin up and
[1:59:13] speak to the wind and speak the storm to
[1:59:15] go back God's not going to clown for
[1:59:17] nobody I'm not talking about that
[1:59:19] what I'm talking about brothers and
[1:59:21] sisters is start speaking the word
[1:59:22] through the Oracles of God let him
[1:59:25] manifest his voice through our voice box
[1:59:29] surrender Our Lives to the point where
[1:59:31] he can speak through US spend the time
[1:59:33] in prayer where we see him manifest so
[1:59:36] much in our lives it's not even us
[1:59:38] speaking anymore it's just him speaking
[1:59:41] thank you Lord stop trying to make it
[1:59:43] happen trying to reason it through
[1:59:46] trying to think it through trying to
[1:59:48] feel like it should happen a certain way
[1:59:49] you know in this message possessing the
[1:59:51] enemy Gates brother bradam he says God
[1:59:52] will allow trials to come around just to
[1:59:54] prove who we are he'll actually let
[1:59:57] something come into the church because
[1:59:58] we see something happen that we think
[2:00:00] shouldn't happen the way that it's
[2:00:01] happening and and he'll allow it amen
[2:00:04] yes he says if we Elevate men in this
[2:00:06] message if we'll take a Ministry and
[2:00:09] we'll Elevate them and put them up there
[2:00:10] he said God will allow that man to fall
[2:00:13] so that you'll take your eyes off the
[2:00:14] man and you'll put them right back on
[2:00:17] God don't elevate anybody but Jesus
[2:00:20] Christ brothers and sisters make sure
[2:00:22] that he's the one that's exalted in your
[2:00:24] life make sure he's the one that your
[2:00:26] children see you talking about not
[2:00:29] talking about your brother or your
[2:00:30] sister but talking about the goodness of
[2:00:32] God in your life talking about the
[2:00:34] goodness of God and your brothers and
[2:00:36] your sisters talk about God talk about
[2:00:38] the Lord Jesus Christ speak the word and
[2:00:41] go forwards because when we do that
[2:00:43] brothers and sisters we can have
[2:00:45] automatic courage we don't have to have
[2:00:48] fear fear is bondage bondage of a spirit
[2:00:51] that's come back into our life to make
[2:00:53] us afraid to think oh my something's out
[2:00:55] of control God's not dealing with a
[2:00:56] situation the way I think you should so
[2:00:58] now I've got to do something I got to
[2:00:59] act if we're doing that the devil's got
[2:01:02] you you're stopped right there that
[2:01:04] Gates's closed and you will not take
[2:01:06] that gate but if you can say hey I've
[2:01:08] got the holy ghost in my life and I
[2:01:10] don't understand it and maybe even it
[2:01:12] frustrates me because we're looking at
[2:01:13] the human nature I know God's in control
[2:01:17] he's going to move this gate he's the
[2:01:18] one that's got to open it he's the one
[2:01:20] that's got to close it when we can do
[2:01:22] that brothers and sisters we'll see him
[2:01:24] do it and you will possess the Gate of
[2:01:26] your enemy it won't be it won't be
[2:01:28] something that fences Us in that stops
[2:01:30] us from going forwards it will just move
[2:01:32] out of the
[2:01:34] way possessing the enemy's Gates
[2:01:38] paragraph
[2:01:40] 52 thank you brother Bram says on the
[2:01:43] day of Pentecost he sent down the Holy
[2:01:46] Ghost sorry I'll go slow so so you can
[2:01:49] get there on the day of Pentecost he
[2:01:52] sent down the Holy Ghost to
[2:01:56] continue get there to continue through
[2:01:58] the Gentiles yes sir I love that just
[2:02:01] even that paragraph that sentence he
[2:02:03] sent down the Holy Ghost to continue
[2:02:05] through the Gentiles it wasn't for the
[2:02:08] Jews interesting hey he sent the Holy
[2:02:11] Ghost to continue down through the
[2:02:12] Gentiles to take out a seed of promise
[2:02:15] to give to the Gentiles the offcast to
[2:02:19] give to them the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:21] Ghost to bring them into the
[2:02:24] promise now we have a right to conquer
[2:02:28] all sickness Hallelujah yes that's right
[2:02:31] isn't that beautiful amen you know in
[2:02:34] this message brother Bram says it
[2:02:35] doesn't matter what we've seen happen in
[2:02:37] someone's life we have a right to
[2:02:40] conquer sickness because he paid for it
[2:02:43] at
[2:02:44] Calvary he paid for it before Calvary
[2:02:46] with those 39 Stripes didn't he yes by
[2:02:49] my stripes you are healed by my stripes
[2:02:52] you were healed present present tense
[2:02:54] and past tense so here we have I would
[2:02:56] say God speaking through the prophet we
[2:02:58] have a right we have a right to conquer
[2:03:02] all sickness we don't have to conquer it
[2:03:05] and here's the key we don't have to
[2:03:06] conquer it brothers and sisters I live
[2:03:08] for a long time thinking we have to
[2:03:09] conquer it somehow I have to change my
[2:03:11] prayer life maybe I need to change my
[2:03:13] spiritual diet maybe I need to go to
[2:03:15] church more maybe we need to have more
[2:03:16] prayer meetings maybe I need to study
[2:03:19] more maybe I have to preach louder or
[2:03:20] harder or something we've got to maybe
[2:03:22] do something I'm just being honest we
[2:03:24] got to do something with the oil that we
[2:03:26] anoint people with is it special oil
[2:03:28] that we get from a special Ministry
[2:03:30] somewhere is there somehow some way
[2:03:32] something we can do but you know what we
[2:03:34] need to do is just allow him to do it we
[2:03:37] need to speak the word and trust that
[2:03:39] he's going to back it up but when we're
[2:03:41] busy trying to do it he's just going to
[2:03:44] say I can't do it because you're getting
[2:03:45] in my way amen h now we have the right
[2:03:49] to conquer all sickness we don't have to
[2:03:51] conquer it it's already conquered oh my
[2:03:55] we just have to claim it and and claim
[2:03:57] the promise and go take it it's already
[2:04:01] conquered amen so just take a look at
[2:04:03] the sickness brother we could say we've
[2:04:05] got sickness in our bodies we do we get
[2:04:07] sickness in our bodies and every one of
[2:04:09] us here I know can raise your hand and
[2:04:10] say he's healed me every one of us have
[2:04:13] been sick and we've all been healed we
[2:04:15] have the right to conquer sickness but
[2:04:18] there's also spiritual sickness brothers
[2:04:20] and sisters it creates a blindness in
[2:04:22] our eyes where we don't even see it
[2:04:24] where we talked about the three Giants
[2:04:26] earlier sometimes we have pride of life
[2:04:28] in our life and we just think that
[2:04:30] everything is perfect God has given me
[2:04:32] all my needs everything that I need is
[2:04:34] just looked after and isn't he so good
[2:04:36] he's a mighty God but you know what if
[2:04:38] we're not careful that in itself can
[2:04:41] take us
[2:04:42] astray because there's nothing that
[2:04:44] we've done it's all
[2:04:46] him amen
[2:04:49] sometimes we can have a spiritual
[2:04:51] sickness sometimes we can have a
[2:04:52] spiritual illness a and it will cause
[2:04:55] something else to happen we can have a
[2:04:57] relationship break down through it we
[2:04:59] can have a illness in our marriage we
[2:05:03] can have an illness in the relationships
[2:05:06] with our children yes we can have an
[2:05:08] illness in a relationship with our
[2:05:10] brothers or our sisters maybe we can
[2:05:13] have an illness between a a brother and
[2:05:15] a pastor or someone and a deacon or song
[2:05:19] leader and and maybe even another song
[2:05:21] leader in a church you can have all
[2:05:23] kinds of illness so don't just put it in
[2:05:26] a box and say it's just a a germ that
[2:05:28] we're talking about that gets inside a
[2:05:29] body no we're talking about all sickness
[2:05:32] brothers and sisters we have the right
[2:05:34] to conquer it
[2:05:36] all when we see Satan come in we don't
[2:05:39] have to tolerate him we just have to
[2:05:42] surrender it's already conquered he goes
[2:05:45] on to say we just have to claim it claim
[2:05:48] the promise and go take it yes it's
[2:05:50] already conquered amen he says death is
[2:05:52] conquered hell is conquered sickness is
[2:05:55] conquered temptation is conquered all
[2:05:58] Devils is conquered hell is conquered
[2:06:00] death is conquered the grave is
[2:06:02] conquered we stand in the gate taking it
[2:06:06] and don't have to fire a shot it's
[2:06:08] already been paid
[2:06:12] for yes we say it once in a while and I
[2:06:14] just will say it now maybe if anybody's
[2:06:17] interested I would say this is the
[2:06:18] fridge sticker right here amen when we
[2:06:21] need just a little reminder it's all
[2:06:22] conquered he's conquered all of it
[2:06:25] there's nothing that can stand in your
[2:06:27] way there's nothing that can stand in
[2:06:29] our way Satan will say oh yes there is
[2:06:33] but the word of God says no there ain't
[2:06:36] he said it through a Vindicated Prophet
[2:06:37] right here all Devils is conquered amen
[2:06:40] so what devil what gate can swing and
[2:06:42] flap and try and cause havoc in our
[2:06:45] lives what what what can really hold us
[2:06:47] back brothers and sisters there's
[2:06:48] nothing Can Am there's nothing
[2:06:51] Hallelujah you know talking about this
[2:06:53] seed I I just got thinking about it and
[2:06:55] and and just really started to meditate
[2:06:58] on this and I thought it was so
[2:06:59] beautiful and in Genesis chapter 4 if
[2:07:02] you if you turn with me over there to
[2:07:04] Genesis chapter 4 we still got a few
[2:07:06] minutes
[2:07:07] here you happy this
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:17] morning talking about the seed and and
[2:07:21] how it
[2:07:22] was given to
[2:07:25] us you know first there's a natural seed
[2:07:28] that
[2:07:29] happens and and that's the way it is we
[2:07:31] we we have a birth in our in our family
[2:07:34] and and we have the natural seed but
[2:07:36] that that baby doesn't just
[2:07:40] automatically flow into the Royal Seed
[2:07:43] of Abraham that baby has got to go
[2:07:45] through a process even though it's our
[2:07:47] seed it has to mature it has to learn it
[2:07:51] has to hear about the word of God and if
[2:07:53] it is truly a seed of God it's going to
[2:07:55] have the ability to receive the word and
[2:07:57] say Amen to that word and and have a
[2:08:00] desire in it to to Fellowship around the
[2:08:03] word but if it doesn't have the desire
[2:08:05] at all then is it truly a seed I don't
[2:08:08] know I don't want to put anybody in or
[2:08:10] take anybody out but I just want to take
[2:08:11] a scriptural example here and and just
[2:08:14] talk about this for a minute there's
[2:08:16] there's always first a natural seed and
[2:08:18] we the beginning of Genesis CH 4 and
[2:08:21] Adam knew his wife Eve and she conceived
[2:08:23] and bear Cain and said I have gotten a
[2:08:25] man from the Lord and she again bear his
[2:08:28] brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of
[2:08:30] the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the
[2:08:33] ground now I'm not going to go too far
[2:08:35] into that I just want to fast forward
[2:08:37] and jump down to the last of this
[2:08:40] chapter because we all know that story
[2:08:43] and maybe we'll talk a little bit about
[2:08:44] it but verse 25 of Genesis 4 and Adam
[2:08:49] knew his wife again and she bare a son
[2:08:52] and called his name Seth for God said
[2:08:55] she hath appointed me another seed
[2:08:59] instead of Abel whom Cain
[2:09:02] slew and just to show an example here if
[2:09:06] we read the next verse verse 26 says and
[2:09:09] to Seth to him also there was born a son
[2:09:14] and he called his name
[2:09:16] Enos and then began men to call upon the
[2:09:21] name of the Lord that Royal seed was
[2:09:25] identified right there brothers and
[2:09:27] sisters and how was it identified I
[2:09:30] would say by his
[2:09:32] nature we can take a look at the
[2:09:34] beginning of Genesis chter 4 and look at
[2:09:37] the first one that was born the first
[2:09:39] born should have had the birthright
[2:09:40] right but he didn't have the nature of
[2:09:42] his of the daddy that we want to see the
[2:09:45] the Royal Seed of Abraham coming from
[2:09:48] right he didn't have that that Daddy he
[2:09:50] had another Daddy and the genetic code
[2:09:52] that was in that boy that seed was
[2:09:55] actually of the evil one is what the
[2:09:56] word of God says Cain was of his father
[2:10:00] the devil amen I think it's beautiful
[2:10:04] because we know that Jesus he identified
[2:10:06] some other people when he was here on
[2:10:08] Earth as having the same nature and they
[2:10:11] were the ones that were the most
[2:10:12] polished Pious religious folks of the
[2:10:15] day my
[2:10:16] goodness but I think it's beautiful here
[2:10:18] we can see the identification of that
[2:10:20] Royal seed starting now in in full
[2:10:24] manifestation and we know that it took a
[2:10:26] couple generations for that to happen
[2:10:28] didn't it it wasn't just Adam's son that
[2:10:31] actually began to call upon the name of
[2:10:33] the Lord it was Adam's grandson that
[2:10:35] started to call upon the name of the
[2:10:37] Lord and isn't it interesting that that
[2:10:40] life had to manifest he couldn't contain
[2:10:43] it he couldn't hold it back he couldn't
[2:10:45] hide it it just had to happen he began
[2:10:47] to call upon the name of the Lord first
[2:10:52] there's a natural seat and I think it's
[2:10:54] beautiful how Genesis 4 starts with a
[2:10:57] birth and it ends in a birth isn't it
[2:10:59] and in the middle there's the murder and
[2:11:01] we can know all the stuff Insider but
[2:11:03] but to look at the the identification of
[2:11:06] of Cain Cain he was a murderer and a
[2:11:09] liar the identification of his father
[2:11:13] Yes how could he be the son of Adam amen
[2:11:18] the
[2:11:19] other had the desire of his late brother
[2:11:22] to call upon the name of the Lord No
[2:11:25] Doubt with a blood
[2:11:27] sacrifice and with that blood sacrifice
[2:11:29] he knew that God was
[2:11:31] pleased and what was that that was a
[2:11:33] revelation that was given to him he was
[2:11:35] taught he went to church he learned but
[2:11:39] something on the inside spoke to him and
[2:11:41] he's the one that went and acted he's
[2:11:44] the one that went after it he's the one
[2:11:46] that did it and you know what it's just
[2:11:47] too tight
[2:11:48] uh that's all we we can see there's one
[2:11:51] type that that glorifies God and there's
[2:11:53] another type that glorifies Satan and
[2:11:55] it's that simple it's cut and dried it's
[2:11:57] black and white and and and there's lots
[2:11:59] of gray in the middle if you want to
[2:12:00] make it that way but through revelation
[2:12:02] we don't do that we have the ability to
[2:12:04] recognize who we are and where we stand
[2:12:07] you know in Genesis
[2:12:09] 3:14 it says and the Lord God said unto
[2:12:11] the serpent because thou Hast done this
[2:12:14] Thou Art cursed above all cattle and
[2:12:16] above every beast of the field upon thy
[2:12:19] belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou
[2:12:22] eat all the days of thy life and we know
[2:12:24] that this is when they had actually done
[2:12:27] the thing in the garden which God told
[2:12:28] them not to do you shouldn't eat of that
[2:12:31] one tree of the knowledge of Good and
[2:12:33] Evil but what I want to say here is why
[2:12:35] was the serpent cursed to do what it
[2:12:38] does today if God's handing out the
[2:12:40] curses there why was the serpent cursed
[2:12:43] to be a serpent why was he just the same
[2:12:45] how could that be it doesn't make sense
[2:12:48] does it but we know through revelation
[2:12:51] we know through the ability to see the
[2:12:52] word of God we know that the serpent
[2:12:54] wasn't just a snake wasn't just on the
[2:12:57] ground eating dust crawling around and
[2:12:59] slithering up through trees like the
[2:13:01] pictures would depict the serpent was a
[2:13:04] beast he was the most subtle of all the
[2:13:06] beasts of the field he had the ability
[2:13:08] to come and present himself you know
[2:13:11] what we've heard is that this Beast was
[2:13:13] actually more masculine than man more
[2:13:16] strong more a able more more more
[2:13:20] willing to actually do stuff to be a
[2:13:22] tiller of the ground to help manage you
[2:13:24] know God didn't create man to go and
[2:13:27] sweat with his brow to go and till the
[2:13:29] field in the garden to pull out all the
[2:13:31] weeds did he because that didn't come
[2:13:33] until the curse once the curse came then
[2:13:37] God said only then will you eat bread by
[2:13:39] the sweat of your
[2:13:43] brow excuse me so something happened we
[2:13:47] know
[2:13:48] I don't really want to go too far into
[2:13:50] it I just think it's amazing because we
[2:13:51] can see that you know there was a curse
[2:13:54] that was put on this one in verse 15 and
[2:13:58] I will put enemity between thee and the
[2:14:02] woman why would he do that if they just
[2:14:05] ate
[2:14:06] fruit why would he put emnity between
[2:14:09] thee and the woman why would that be
[2:14:11] there and between thy seed and her seed
[2:14:14] why would there be enemity between them
[2:14:17] and the seed if they just ate fruit it
[2:14:19] just doesn't make sense it just you
[2:14:21] can't even really understand it thy seed
[2:14:23] and her seed it shall bruise thy head
[2:14:25] and thou shalt bruise his heel and we
[2:14:27] know that this scripture right here
[2:14:29] brothers and sisters talking about the
[2:14:31] Royal seed talking about the seed it
[2:14:33] actually speaks about another seed and
[2:14:35] we know that that seed was Jesus Christ
[2:14:39] amen Jesus Christ came and you know that
[2:14:43] that that seed of Jesus Christ he came
[2:14:47] and and and he did what he needed to do
[2:14:50] he was able to come and I just love it
[2:14:53] because brother Bram says that he was
[2:14:54] the fullness the word of God says it too
[2:14:56] he was the fullness of the godhead
[2:14:59] bodily so how can you say that Jesus
[2:15:02] isn't God we could go on a on a big
[2:15:05] discussion about that but we know that
[2:15:07] some people want to do that we're not
[2:15:09] here to do that today I just uh I think
[2:15:12] about this other seed and I think about
[2:15:15] the seed for the people today and and I
[2:15:17] can't help but think that you know there
[2:15:19] is a stature of a perfect man someone
[2:15:23] that's filled with the Holy Ghost and
[2:15:26] someone that's filled with the Holy
[2:15:27] Ghost that matches that description of
[2:15:30] of having the stature of a perfect man
[2:15:32] we need to make sure that we're clear
[2:15:34] it's not having a statue of a perfect
[2:15:36] man in this flesh right this flesh will
[2:15:39] never be perfect never we're not making
[2:15:43] Grace a disgrace we're not making any
[2:15:44] room for sin what we want to do is talk
[2:15:47] about how Having the Holy Ghost In Our
[2:15:48] Lives when we have the Holy Ghost in our
[2:15:51] lives this flesh will automatically
[2:15:53] become subject to our spirit and our
[2:15:55] spirit won't even be our spirit it will
[2:15:57] be his spirit that will actually be
[2:15:59] causing the direction in our lives
[2:16:00] because we will say Lord if thou wi then
[2:16:04] I will we won't just be running out and
[2:16:06] doing and we would save ourselves a
[2:16:08] whole lot of trouble if we would do that
[2:16:09] more often Lord willing I'll do that am
[2:16:13] but when we're filled with the Holy
[2:16:15] Ghost it's not it's not that someone is
[2:16:18] better than anyone there's no
[2:16:21] elitism if we see somebody puffed up we
[2:16:24] know the word of God says that you know
[2:16:27] real Revelation doesn't puff you up we
[2:16:28] know the prophet for our day he said
[2:16:30] true Revelation doesn't puff people up
[2:16:33] when we see puffed up people we know
[2:16:34] there's something
[2:16:36] wrong they're just they're just not
[2:16:39] right there yet they haven't quite made
[2:16:41] that place of of the Statue of the
[2:16:43] perfect man and what I'm saying is
[2:16:45] they're not climbing a ladder they're
[2:16:47] not building a house God's building the
[2:16:49] house amen what they haven't done yet is
[2:16:51] fully surrendered to the word in their
[2:16:53] day we haven't fully surrendered to the
[2:16:56] life of Jesus Christ true Revelation
[2:16:58] humbles a believer in second Peter verse
[2:17:01] one second Peter chapter 1 sorry verse
[2:17:04] 9 maybe if you have that brother I'll
[2:17:07] just pause and we'll we'll bring that up
[2:17:09] as
[2:17:10] we bring it in for a close here
[2:17:16] soon
[2:17:18] there we
[2:17:20] are you know we talk about the Statue of
[2:17:22] the perfect man and we know that that's
[2:17:25] the the scriptures prior to this but
[2:17:28] verse 9 says but he that lath these
[2:17:30] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[2:17:35] and hath forgotten that he was purged of
[2:17:37] his old
[2:17:40] sins verse 10 says wherefore the rather
[2:17:43] Brethren give diligence to make your
[2:17:46] calling and election sure
[2:17:48] for if you do these things you shall
[2:17:50] never
[2:17:51] fall for so an entrance shall be
[2:17:54] ministered unto you abundantly amen into
[2:17:58] the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[2:18:00] Savior Jesus Christ Hallelujah isn't
[2:18:04] that wonderful to think that we've been
[2:18:06] given the instruction right there
[2:18:07] brothers and sisters we know that it's
[2:18:09] not anything that we've done in our
[2:18:12] lives and never could be anything that
[2:18:14] we've done or will do in our lives it's
[2:18:16] because he's chosen us just like he
[2:18:19] chose Jacob the Shyer amen over his
[2:18:23] brother who had the birthright who came
[2:18:25] out
[2:18:26] first but Esau have I hated and Jacob
[2:18:30] have I loved so that election might
[2:18:32] stand so that he could demonstrate that
[2:18:34] there's people that he's Chosen and
[2:18:36] there's people that he hasn't Chosen and
[2:18:39] that's the way it works we can't put
[2:18:40] anybody in or put anybody out we want to
[2:18:43] actually pray that everyone would be in
[2:18:45] we would that all would come unto
[2:18:49] salvation but I just think verse 10 is
[2:18:51] like a critical key maybe like a little
[2:18:53] bit of a keystone we talked about maybe
[2:18:55] just a little one not the Keystone but a
[2:18:57] little one wherefore the rather Brethren
[2:18:59] give diligence to make your calling and
[2:19:01] election sure don't be looking at other
[2:19:03] people's calling in elections don't
[2:19:05] worry about them just get your own right
[2:19:08] because we preach this gospel we are
[2:19:11] written Epistles read of all men and
[2:19:15] when we're saying one thing and not con
[2:19:17] rently living another what happens we've
[2:19:20] got that mixed signal that mixed message
[2:19:22] and it causes confusion that's where
[2:19:24] people stumble at the word many people
[2:19:27] think stumbling at the word is the
[2:19:28] preaching of the word and sometimes it
[2:19:30] is sometimes it isn't but many times
[2:19:33] it's the life that's lived people hear
[2:19:35] this word they hear the message of the
[2:19:37] hour but then they see people act a
[2:19:39] certain way that doesn't line up with
[2:19:41] this
[2:19:42] message and it causes confusion causes
[2:19:46] questions but you know what if we would
[2:19:48] just take our time and make sure that we
[2:19:50] we diligently work out our own salvation
[2:19:53] work out our own calling and election
[2:19:56] diligently you know what the world would
[2:19:58] be a better
[2:19:59] place and when we do that so an entrance
[2:20:02] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[2:20:06] not just a little bit but abundantly an
[2:20:09] entrance will be ministered unto you
[2:20:11] abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom
[2:20:14] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and
[2:20:16] that's where I think true rest comes
[2:20:18] from isn't it when we come to that place
[2:20:20] when that entrance has been made to us
[2:20:21] when we've worked out our own salvation
[2:20:23] with fear and trembling when we know
[2:20:25] that we know that we know there's
[2:20:27] nothing ever good going to be inside of
[2:20:28] us except for him that that blood cell
[2:20:30] that he's broken for us that he's caused
[2:20:32] in in that heart that special place that
[2:20:34] we've been given by God for him to live
[2:20:38] in when he comes and lives in
[2:20:40] us we've been given that Everlasting
[2:20:42] Kingdom it's just a peace amen peace
[2:20:45] that passes all understanding peace like
[2:20:47] a river peace where we know that we
[2:20:50] don't have to fight the battles hallah
[2:20:53] he's fought the Battle all we need to do
[2:20:55] is make sure that we've got the token
[2:20:57] amen working it out with fear and
[2:20:59] trembling working out that salvation
[2:21:01] with fear and trembling and that's what
[2:21:03] that is brothers and sisters don't think
[2:21:04] that salvation for us as the Bride of
[2:21:06] Jesus Christ is just simply making it to
[2:21:08] the other side even though it is we are
[2:21:10] actually working on our salvation with
[2:21:12] fear and trembling to get the token
[2:21:14] because without the token you're not
[2:21:15] going to the other side that's right we
[2:21:18] know the word of God says that it would
[2:21:19] be better for those who have not even
[2:21:20] heard this message of the hour than to
[2:21:22] actually just partially accept it and
[2:21:24] then reject the parts they don't like
[2:21:26] because we're going to see people leave
[2:21:28] here and wonder wow I missed
[2:21:31] it we had the ability we were right
[2:21:35] there people that I knew people that I
[2:21:37] loved what are they doing now they're on
[2:21:39] the other side and I'm still here
[2:21:42] brother Bram says what will they preach
[2:21:44] in questions and answers the questions
[2:21:46] asked to him what will they preach after
[2:21:47] the Rapture and he says they'll preach
[2:21:49] the same
[2:21:51] thing what is it that they're
[2:21:53] preaching I don't know I could only
[2:21:56] imagine that as a prophet he had insight
[2:21:58] into
[2:21:59] that maybe it's some kind of a
[2:22:01] psychological spin maybe it's some kind
[2:22:03] of a self-help Guru mixed in with the
[2:22:06] message anything hybrid with the message
[2:22:09] I believe would do that that's why
[2:22:12] brothers and sisters don't look at one
[2:22:13] another don't look at me don't look at
[2:22:15] anybody don't even look too closely at
[2:22:17] the prophet look to Jesus look to Jesus
[2:22:20] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:22:22] forever amen but we know for sure the
[2:22:25] prophet pointed to Jesus Christ
[2:22:28] right he gave us the best example that
[2:22:31] we probably ever will see since Jesus
[2:22:33] Christ amen hallelujah we know that his
[2:22:37] late son said that you couldn't tell who
[2:22:39] his friends were or his enemies were I
[2:22:42] say Lord help me be that way help me be
[2:22:45] like that and and we know that he was
[2:22:48] the wave sheath right waved over top of
[2:22:51] the congregation to show this is what
[2:22:54] maturity looks like hallelu when the
[2:22:57] crop is mature this is what we're going
[2:22:59] to look like we're not going to be
[2:23:02] having healing campaigns but brothers
[2:23:03] and sisters as the Royal Seed of Abraham
[2:23:06] with the revelation of the word we can
[2:23:08] go forward and speak the word and know
[2:23:11] that it's already been conquered and
[2:23:12] know that he's already willing to back
[2:23:14] it up we don't have to heal anybody
[2:23:17] neither can we but he's already done
[2:23:20] it we know that Satan from the very
[2:23:23] beginning when we talked about this seed
[2:23:24] here he tried to interrupt God's program
[2:23:26] God allowed him to do it and why did he
[2:23:28] do it so he could express himself in
[2:23:30] Genesis 4:25 and Adam knew his wife
[2:23:32] again and she bear a son called his name
[2:23:34] Seth for God said she hath appointed me
[2:23:37] another seed instead of Abel who came
[2:23:39] slooh and to Seth to him also there was
[2:23:42] born a son and called his name Enos then
[2:23:45] began men to call upon the name name of
[2:23:47] the Lord then began men to call upon the
[2:23:50] name of the Lord that scriptural
[2:23:52] identification of the spiritual Royal
[2:23:55] Seed of Abraham the spiritual seed
[2:23:59] Isaiah 7 therefore the Lord himself
[2:24:01] shall give you a sign Behold a virgin
[2:24:04] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[2:24:06] call his name Emmanuel another seed the
[2:24:09] Royal seed that we've been talking about
[2:24:11] spoken of by a prophetic utterance we
[2:24:13] know Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you
[2:24:16] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[2:24:18] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[2:24:20] and he shall turn the heart of the
[2:24:21] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[2:24:23] the children to their fathers lest I
[2:24:24] come Smite the Earth with a curse amen
[2:24:27] that prophetic utterance went forth
[2:24:30] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[2:24:32] years ago thousands of years ago today
[2:24:35] and here we are brothers and sisters as
[2:24:38] the the manifested attributes of that
[2:24:41] prophecy 1 Peter 2 verse 9 but ye are
[2:24:45] Cho chosen generation a royal priesthood
[2:24:49] a holy nation A peculiar people that ye
[2:24:52] should show forth the Praises of him who
[2:24:54] hath called you out of Darkness Into His
[2:24:57] Marvelous Light which in times past were
[2:24:59] not a people we weren't a people but
[2:25:02] that Royal Seed of Abraham amen was
[2:25:06] created so that we could be a people so
[2:25:08] that we could be called from darkness
[2:25:11] which in time past were not a people but
[2:25:13] now are the people of God which hath not
[2:25:16] obtained Mercy Mercy but now hath
[2:25:19] obtained Mercy today brothers and
[2:25:22] sisters there's another
[2:25:24] seed and this is our seed this is our
[2:25:27] identification and now I feel like I'm
[2:25:29] just getting started and uh here we are
[2:25:32] I realize that clock is not actually
[2:25:34] slow today my
[2:25:36] goodness cuz I could I feel like we
[2:25:39] could go for another hour we okay for
[2:25:40] another
[2:25:43] hour I won't do it to us but I do have a
[2:25:46] couple more minutes if it's okay are we
[2:25:48] okay for a few more
[2:25:50] minutes the exposition of the seven
[2:25:52] Church ages I just want to talk about
[2:25:54] who you
[2:25:56] are we laid a bit of a background and I
[2:25:58] know I feel like I've bounced around a
[2:25:59] little bit I hope it's made a little bit
[2:26:01] of of encouraging sense but you know out
[2:26:03] of the exposition of the seven Church
[2:26:05] ages out of the saman church
[2:26:07] age according to Romans
[2:26:11] 4:16 we find that God has given a sure
[2:26:15] promise to all of Abraham's
[2:26:19] seed I think it's just beautiful we're
[2:26:21] talking about this in the back study
[2:26:23] without knowing that this is what we're
[2:26:25] coming to talk about God has given a
[2:26:28] sure promise to all of Abraham's seed
[2:26:31] remember the word
[2:26:33] sure Bas
[2:26:35] ality
[2:26:38] steadfast
[2:26:40] strong a sure promise to Abraham's seed
[2:26:44] and Paul puts himself and and all
[2:26:47] believers under that designation because
[2:26:50] he says Abraham who is the father of us
[2:26:53] all then he goes on not to only narrow
[2:26:57] down his definition but to rather to
[2:27:00] finalize it for in Galatians 3 he
[2:27:03] identified the seed singular with Jesus
[2:27:07] and counted the seed children as
[2:27:10] children of promise and promise as
[2:27:13] having to do with election or the
[2:27:16] choosing of of God Amen and that is
[2:27:18] exactly what we have been
[2:27:21] saying these who are of the royal seed
[2:27:25] are the elect of God are the
[2:27:29] predestinated forn of God and were in
[2:27:33] the mind of God and His
[2:27:36] Thoughts is that you this morning amen
[2:27:39] yes it in very plain language the true
[2:27:42] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[2:27:45] eternally
[2:27:47] though not expressed until each came
[2:27:49] forth in the designated decreed
[2:27:55] season I just want to say this Satan's
[2:27:57] going to say no you
[2:27:58] didn't but he's a liar right if you have
[2:28:02] the ability to hear the message of the
[2:28:04] hour and something keeps pulling us
[2:28:06] something keeps holding me amen every
[2:28:08] day I see amen when that happens
[2:28:11] brothers and sisters you were in the
[2:28:13] forn knowledge of God this is you that
[2:28:16] he's talking about this is the Bride of
[2:28:18] Jesus Christ right here the true bride
[2:28:21] of Christ was in the mind of God
[2:28:22] eternally though not expressed until
[2:28:25] each came forth in the designated
[2:28:27] decreed season we could say well my
[2:28:29] mother my father my grandma my grandpa
[2:28:31] God knew all about that from before the
[2:28:34] foundation of the world don't look at
[2:28:35] the natural look at the spiritual you're
[2:28:38] the Royal Seed of Abraham you were in
[2:28:40] the mind of God eternally though not
[2:28:43] expressed until each came forth in the
[2:28:45] designated decreed season as each member
[2:28:47] came forth it became expressed and took
[2:28:51] place in the body thus this bride is the
[2:28:56] literal spoken word seed
[2:29:00] bride and though she is feminine in
[2:29:02] designation she is also called the body
[2:29:05] of Christ it is very apparent that she
[2:29:08] ought to be called that for she was
[2:29:10] predestinated in him came from the same
[2:29:12] Source was eternal with him and is now
[2:29:15] manifesting
[2:29:17] God in a many membered body are you
[2:29:20] manifesting God in your life brothers
[2:29:21] and
[2:29:23] sisters oh my that's such a heavy
[2:29:25] statement it's so sobering to think if
[2:29:29] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ then we
[2:29:31] are manifesting God and there's no two
[2:29:34] ways about that we're not going to be us
[2:29:37] today and God tomorrow be God today
[2:29:41] brothers and sisters amen get that word
[2:29:44] inside of you today so that you can be
[2:29:46] mad manifesting God tomorrow cuz if you
[2:29:48] don't have it today it's not going to
[2:29:50] happen tomorrow who knows what tomorrow
[2:29:54] holds now it could happen tomorrow don't
[2:29:56] get me wrong but I want to say this if
[2:29:59] you have God in you you have God in you
[2:30:03] you're not just going to go out and get
[2:30:05] God you're not just going to go and get
[2:30:07] saved one day you always were saved you
[2:30:09] just realized it amen so I'm saying try
[2:30:12] and realize it today brothers and
[2:30:13] sisters I'm hoping that we can realize
[2:30:15] it sooner than later because the sooner
[2:30:17] that we recognize this the sooner that
[2:30:19] we go amen
[2:30:22] yes my now manifesting in a member me
[2:30:25] many membered body whereas once God was
[2:30:28] manifested in one member even our Lord
[2:30:32] Jesus
[2:30:33] Christ goodness I'll call the
[2:30:39] musicians continuing on in the
[2:30:42] exposition of the seven Church ages the
[2:30:43] four the saman church age brother bam
[2:30:47] says now then here we are coming to a
[2:30:50] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[2:30:55] manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt
[2:30:59] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:31:02] and that Eternal one was the father
[2:31:05] manifest in
[2:31:06] flesh and thereby gained the title of
[2:31:11] son even so we Eternal in his thoughts
[2:31:17] in our turn become the many membered
[2:31:21] spoken word seed manifest in
[2:31:25] flesh and the those Eternal thoughts now
[2:31:29] manifest in flesh are the sons of
[2:31:32] God even as we are
[2:31:37] soall he just sums it up right here we
[2:31:41] did not become seed by the rebirth we
[2:31:44] were seed and therefore therefore we
[2:31:47] reborn for only the elect can be
[2:31:51] reborn because we were seed is the only
[2:31:55] reason we could be quickened right in
[2:31:59] nonseed there's nothing to
[2:32:02] Quicken Cain's
[2:32:04] race because when Cain brought the
[2:32:08] Magnificent sacrifice onto god of the
[2:32:11] fruits of the land it would have been
[2:32:15] magnificent God Saidi not into it it's
[2:32:18] not what I desire it's not what I want
[2:32:21] right I want what your brother brought
[2:32:23] if you would just do like him but
[2:32:26] remember Cain had nothing in his heart
[2:32:28] to receive that right there was nothing
[2:32:30] in him to receive it just like the
[2:32:32] children of Israel there was nothing in
[2:32:33] their hearts to mix with the faith there
[2:32:36] was no faith in their hearts to mix with
[2:32:38] that word that came from the prophet in
[2:32:40] their day and that's why every one of
[2:32:42] them remained in the wilderness we know
[2:32:44] that when Jesus stood before them and he
[2:32:46] said you know what if you knew Abraham
[2:32:49] you claim him as your father as that
[2:32:52] seed but if you knew Abraham then you
[2:32:54] would believe the words that he spoke
[2:32:56] about me because I am the one that he
[2:32:58] spoke about and if you were that seed
[2:33:00] then you would believe in me but you
[2:33:02] know what every single one of those
[2:33:04] fathers are dead and we know that the
[2:33:07] prophet of God in our day said that that
[2:33:09] meant eternally separated it wasn't just
[2:33:12] that they hit the grave and and they're
[2:33:13] asleep and one day they're just going to
[2:33:15] come out of the grave and everything
[2:33:16] will be fine because they're of Israel
[2:33:18] no they're actually eternally separated
[2:33:21] and we know that that's the Final Act of
[2:33:23] the final play is to be eternally
[2:33:25] separated am we don't have to do that
[2:33:28] brothers and sisters we've been given
[2:33:29] the ability to be called because we were
[2:33:33] seed is the reason we could be quickened
[2:33:35] there's something in us that responds to
[2:33:38] that word and that's what we were
[2:33:39] talking about in the back this morning
[2:33:41] maybe stand with me as we close there is
[2:33:43] something inside of us that responds to
[2:33:45] the word you know in in in in the
[2:33:49] scripture that we had talked about
[2:33:50] earlier on maybe last week Flesh and
[2:33:52] Blood have not revealed these things
[2:33:54] there's not flesh and blood inside of us
[2:33:56] that says Amen to that word to the world
[2:33:59] we sound crazy we sound like Fanatics
[2:34:02] like lunatics people would say there's
[2:34:04] something wrong with you
[2:34:06] severely but the inside of the inside
[2:34:08] says it doesn't matter what anybody says
[2:34:11] cuz I've met him and I know that this
[2:34:13] word is
[2:34:14] true and when we can he that it's this
[2:34:16] rock of Revelation brothers and sisters
[2:34:18] that he builds his church on and that's
[2:34:20] why we can say it's not this Church
[2:34:22] Calgary Living Word that gives us the
[2:34:24] Revelation it it's not it's not saying
[2:34:27] that I accepted the message of the hour
[2:34:28] at a certain time at a certain place in
[2:34:30] a certain area and and that gives me the
[2:34:32] Salvation it's this rock of Revelation
[2:34:35] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:34:37] today and forever that's the Keystone of
[2:34:38] the Bible that he is my ever PR in tense
[2:34:41] I am in my life and when that happens
[2:34:44] thy seed you shall possess the Gate of
[2:34:48] your enemy your enemy will not Prevail
[2:34:50] over top of you brothers and sisters so
[2:34:52] I want to say it this morning this is my
