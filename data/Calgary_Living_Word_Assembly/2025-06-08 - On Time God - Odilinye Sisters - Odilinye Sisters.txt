Description:
On Time God

Chorus:
He's an on time God, yes He is (oh oh oh)
On time God, yes He is
He may not come when you want Hm
But He'll be there right on time
He's an on time God, yes He is

Verse 1:
You can ask
The children of Israel
Trapped at the Red Sea
But that mean old Pharaoh
And his army
They had water all around them
And Pharaoh on their track
From out of nowhere
God stepped in
And made a highway just like that

He's an on time God, yes He is (oh oh oh)
On time God, yes He is
He may not come when you want Hm
But He'll be there right on time
He's an on time God, yes He is

Verse 2:
You can ask the five thousand
Hungry souls and fed
On the banks of the river
With two fish and five loaves of bread
What a miracle
He performed for the multitude
What He did way back then
He'll do today for me and you


Chorus:
He's an on time God, yes He is (oh oh oh)
On time God, yes He is
He may not come when you want Hm
But He'll be there right on time
He's an on time God, yes He is

Repeat (X4)
He's on time
(On time)
He's on time
(On time)
He's on time
(On time, oh yes he's on time)

Chorus:
He's an on time God, yes he is (oh oh oh)
On time God, yes He is
He may not come when you want Him
But He’ll be there right on time
I'll tell you
He's an on time God
He's an on time God
He’s an on time God
He’s an on time God
Yes He is!
