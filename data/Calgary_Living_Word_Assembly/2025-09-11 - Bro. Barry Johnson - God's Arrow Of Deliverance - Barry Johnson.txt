========================================
[Music] Amen. God bless each one of you once again this this evening. Welcome to you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus. Good to have each one out tonight. Good to be back in another Wednesday night service. Always a blessing. Probably repeat that many times, but it is a blessing to me. I'm sure it is to you as well. Let's sing this this evening.

If you have a need tonight, maybe just defy gravity and make it known unto him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we go to him in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord Jesus, tonight we're so thankful that we can gather together in your name. Lord, we know that this world is full of hatred. This world is full of sin. This world is not our home. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful that you have shown us our origin. Lord, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Because of that, we know that it doesn't matter what happens here. It doesn't matter how it happens here because you created us in you before the foundation of the world, Lord, &gt;&gt; to be that seed planted in the proper place that at the proper time appointed of the father that that light of the sen would shine upon it and cause it to come to life. And father, we stand here tonight as witnesses of that life. Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; That very life, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Tonight, we just want to glorify you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord Jesus, for all that you've done for us in our lives. And Lord, all that you're going to do, but Lord, &gt;&gt; we want to turn our attention to what you're doing right now. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you gave us a direction, a clear directive through your vindicated prophet to pay attention to what you're doing right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; And help us, Lord Jesus, to observe this service. Help us to observe your spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord Jesus, to have hearts to receive from you tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, as we step into the highest order of the service, Lord, where you speak to us, we just invite you, Lord, &gt;&gt; to minister to our hearts, Lord. The speaker and hearer alike, Father, we all need you. If there's anything in our lives that would hinder that, Father, we just ask you would forgive it for from us, Lord. That you would forgive us for it, Lord. That you would purge it from us, Lord. Father, that your word would have its preeminence tonight in our midst. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we just want to remember the requests that were made known unto you tonight by the way of an uplift hand. Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. We know that you're more than able, Lord, to discern the need and to be able to meet the need, Father. And we thank you for that. Tonight, Lord, also we just want to remember the Kirk family in the United States. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we know that happened when your prophet was in the land and he said, "It's not right for a man to have to die that way." And Father, we just want to pray that you would be with them tonight, Lord. Lord, we love you and we thank you. We just ask now that you would bless the reading of your word, Father, that you would break it open to us fresh once again. Lord, we thank you for all that you're doing for us even now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, musicians, one more time for your dedicated service to the house of the Lord. And thank you, Sister Epha and brother Toby for that special. &gt;&gt; My God is real. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, I'd like to read out of 2 Kings chapter 13. And uh tonight I'm going to talk about what we did in the States for the the purpose I went there. Second Kings chapter 13. We'll start with verse 14. I think it's just just such a powerful scripture here and to know that it's the prophet speaking to the king and he's given an instruction but he just he just doesn't have a revelation about that instruction. 2 Kings 13:14 the prophet Elisha. Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said,"Oh my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." We know that's exactly what the prophet said as his prophet was taken off the scene. Verse 15 says, "And Elisha said unto him, take the bow and arrows." And he took unto him the bow and arrows. And he said unto the king of Israel, "Put thine hand upon the bow." And he put his hand upon it. And Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands. Wouldn't it be nice to just have a vindicated prophet put his hands on yours? Oh my. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Open the window eastward." And he opened it. Then Elisha Elisha said, "Shoot." And he shot. And he said, "The arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of the deliverance from Syria, for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphic till they have consumed them." Right? &gt;&gt; Till thou have consumed them. &gt;&gt; Verse 18 says, "And he said, take the arrows, and he took them, and he said unto the king of Israel, smite upon the ground." And he smoked thrice and stayed. And the man of God was wroth with him and said, "Thou should have shouldest have smitten five or six times. Then hast thou smitten Syria till thou hast consumed it. Whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice." And Elisha died, and they buried him. and the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, thank you for your word. Thank you for your prophet. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the anointing, Lord, on your prophet, knowing that it's the same anointing on different humans, Lord, to bring the same word. You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we thank you for that anointing, Lord. It's just it's just as anointed tonight as it was there. &gt;&gt; And Father, we just want to commit the reading of your word into your hands now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. I'm sure that uh everyone is aware, but we'll just mention it quick here before we get going. And uh it's such a wonderful thing. We're going to have a tremendous weekend. This weekend we have brother Andrew Glover here. He comes in tomorrow and uh we have him here Friday at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at 6 pm and Sunday at 10:00 a.m. Last year we had two services and it just wasn't enough. So we uh we're going to try three this year. And uh I'm certainly excited as well because it's later in the year. It's not during the summer when everyone has their trips planned and are away. So, we've tried to accommodate that as well as best we can. And uh we have a breakfast planned for Saturday at 10:00 a.m. We have the note out on the chat. If you desire to come, please just uh let us know. Potlook on Sunday. Again, there's a note on the chat. And uh I think that's about it. I just wanted to uh bring greetings from brother Ray Ericson at True Word Tabernacle. He is the pastor of that church and uh he's the senior pastor of that church I should say and brother Wayne Lawson is the pastor of that church and it's a real interesting thing they work together they together equal the pastor of the church and uh what a tremendous thing it would be to have that uh that person to be able to lean upon for uh wisdom and knowledge experience in dealing with matters Um, but they all send their greetings to Calgary Living Word. &gt;&gt; And my parting words with Brother Wayne were, "When are you coming to Calgary?" And so, we're talking about it and we'll see when it will happen. It looks like it'll be in the springtime potentially and uh it'll be a wonderful time of fellowship, I'm sure. For those who don't know why I went, I I went I was invited by him to come down and uh and speak at a men's meeting. They had a a bow shoot on Saturday and they put on uh a supper. One of the brothers does this in the church. It's not even the church that does it. I think the church probably helps them a bit, but um one of the brothers just had the desire in his heart to get the men together and just potentially bring in some ministry. And so he uh he was telling me that the Lord put it on his heart to do this. And uh he said, "You know what? Better way to do it than to bait them in with some food." So he put together a good meal. And 19 years ago, he started it. And he's been doing it every year for 19 years. And uh so they invited me to come. I don't know why, but they did. And uh you know, I think the Lord was good. I guess that's the reason why I just don't feel worthy. I know there's so many other ministries ministers that can really preach this gospel better than I can. But you know uh that evening uh Friday evening there was one one man came to the Lord in that meeting &gt;&gt; and there was five others that rededicated their lives to the Lord in that meeting &gt;&gt; and uh so I guess that's why and then the the following Sunday that was Friday night Sunday morning the one guy that gave his life to the Lord he said I want to be baptized right away and so he got baptized as well. There was two actual baptisms and both of those brothers were there. One of them gave his life back to the Lord and the other one actually uh found the Lord there. So just tremendous to to be a part of it. Um yeah, the Lord is good. It was just a real blessing to go and spend time with brother Wayne. I guess if I had to say it, he would probably be the the hory head for me in the ministry. He's just been a real good friend to me and you know I couldn't think of a better person that's based in the word to actually lean on for you know situations questions and uh you know to be able to learn this word. So uh they send their greetings and uh it just was a wonderful time of fellowship down there and refreshing to get away with my wife without the kids. We love the kids, but sometimes the marriage needs a break. And it's important to actually get away and just remember one another that you're married. Are you happy tonight? &gt;&gt; Certainly happy to be back home again. It's nice to get away, but it's even nicer to come home. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be together with the the saints in the in the church and uh just to get into the word. You know, I talked about this on uh on the Friday evening. I had a different direction for the Sunday service and it just I I believe when I got asked a question uh a message came to my heart and I had never listened to it before but I was sure that there was a message uh because of just how profound it came to me and it was called the arrow of God's deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. the arrow of God's deliverance. And uh the arrow of God's deliverance shot from a bow actually to be specific in 1956. And uh you know I can see that I did it again. Just bear with me for a second here. I've got some quotes that I want to bring. And uh I think it's important to make sure that we are on the same page. Um I apologize. I just sent them just so we're together tonight. I uh want to talk about this scripture here in 2 Kings chapter 14. I have read it in the past and uh always kind of wondered about it. You know, how how the the prophet, you know, one of the things I think is interesting how the prophet got sick and he died and uh how the king came around and said the same thing that uh you know, the prophet had said. He was able to repeat the prophet, but he wasn't able to live the prophet. And I'm not saying pattern himself to be the prophet and get a belt buckle and a suitcase and all of the memorabilia around what the prophet did to try and buy a mantle to look like the prophet. I'm not saying that at all. What I am saying is he had the desire to actually say the same words that the prophet said, but he didn't want to live it. This was a backsliden king, this Joash. And uh he wasn't actually in the will of the Lord for his life because he came in to be the king and he still kept some of the high places. He wasn't willing to tear them all down. And for whatever the reason, maybe he needed a little bit of notoriety or maybe he just didn't want to upset people. Whatever the reason, he actually kept some of the high places and that wasn't good enough to actually measure up to the message for his day. But you know, the prophet, he he was dying. He knew he was going and he did the best he could to try and give deliverance to the children of Israel in the moment that he had before he did cross over. And and we know the story. He told them to open the window, to take the bow, to draw the bow, and actually shoot eastward. And we know there's a a significance to the direction. I'm not really going to get too far into that tonight, but the fact is he was given the instruction. And you know in in verse 17 he said open the window eastward and he opened it. Then Elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the Lord's deliverance and the arrow of the deliverance from Syria for thou shalt smite the Syrians and Aph till they have till thou hath consumed them. And we know verse 18 and 19 is really what I want to get into tonight in this message. um God's arrow of deliverance shot from a bow. Brother Brham, he really tends to dwell on these next two verses, verse 18 and verse 19. And uh you know, verse 18 says, "And he said, take the arrows." And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, smite upon the ground. And he smoked thrice and stayed. And we know this is the instruction of the prophet. Take the arrows and smite. Do it. And he did it. &gt;&gt; He did it. But the thing about it is he didn't do it by revelation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It wasn't quickened to him by revelation, by the spirit. Now, some might say while the spirit was gone, but he was dealing with the prophet of God, and there was an anointing on that man, which there wasn't on any other man. There was only one man that had that anointing. And this anointing was instructing him to do something, but he didn't do it by revelation. And the man of God, verse 19, was wroth with him. And he said, "Thou should have smitten five or six times. Then thou had smitten Syria till thou hast consumed it. Whereas now, thou shalt smite Syria but thrice." And when we were studying this, I was studying this. I was having a conversation about it and it came up. How would he know to smite the ground more than three times? &gt;&gt; He told them to smite until your enemy is consumed. So when is that? I think it's a lot like the day of Pentecost. They were given the instruction to go into the upper room until not 3 days, not six days, &gt;&gt; not six weeks. Just go in and and tar together in one mind and one accord. Go and get all the humanity out of your life until you receive power from on high. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham gets into this and we'll just uh I'm going to read a bunch of quotes tonight. Right? I hope it's okay. I think there's nothing better that we could do really. We could come up with our own words, but uh it's just beautiful the way the prophet says it. You know, he talks about this and says that God always keeps his word. He says, "Now, you know, no matter how mysterious it seems, God always keeps his word. And no matter how unreasonable it may seem to the people, God keeps his word." &gt;&gt; And I think that that's such a beautiful thing. It's so amazing when we look at it that way because we can look at circumstances and situations and say, "Well, you know, God could do this for me and and maybe he should do that for me." But he always keeps his word. &gt;&gt; He's bound to his word. Not our thoughts and not our ideas, not our desires, not our wants. &gt;&gt; Sometimes maybe what we even would consider to be our needs are not what he would consider our needs to be because we live in a leodyian condition. And sometimes being caught up in this leodysian condition, our needs are not actually our needs. &gt;&gt; They become wants. And if God makes a promise of anything, God will keep that promise. And I I just think it's so beautiful. You can see where I'm going with this. And it's not the way that I preached it there. I I waited and sort of built to a crescendo. But tonight, I just want to do it this way. I want to say it as we talk about this. We need to know that we have been given the liberty through the revelation in the day in which we live through the same anointing to smite our enemies. &gt;&gt; Not just smite them thrice. Not just say, "Bang, bang, bang, I've done it. Now I can go home." No, no, no, no. Until our enemies are consumed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take the arrow of God's deliverance, which is this message of the hour, and smite until the enemy is done. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when is that going to happen? &gt;&gt; I don't think that there is a day or an hour that any man can say, is there? &gt;&gt; Because really, what's going to happen is the enemy won't know what to do with us, but we're still going to be fighting. &gt;&gt; We're still going to be battling. &gt;&gt; You know, we can either be in a situation where we're like that crow. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells that story about that farmer that caught the crow and he put the string around him and all of his mates would come and they would talk and fellowship and they would fly away and he'd be stuck. He couldn't go. He'd jump and come back down. And one day that crow got loose, right? The string was cut and he didn't recognize that he was cut and his friends would come and they'd fly away and he wouldn't even bother trying anymore. He gave up because he was bound at one point. We can either live in that condition or we can live in the condition where we continually smite the enemy. Even if the enemy is done with us, we still need to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we will until we actually have a body change. &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Brandham says, "You and I will make a promise and we'll break it because we don't mean to have to do it that way. But sometimes circumstances causes us to do it. We will break our promises." You know, he says sometimes it's it's ridiculous the way that he would go around about to keep his promise, but God always does it. I think if we can just remember that God always keeps his word. He always keeps his promise. Even though we actually will not, we cannot because we're humans, &gt;&gt; we will always break our promise. And the worst thing is, the worst thing is, this is what the devil will try and hang on us is we'll break our promise to God. We'll say, "Oh Lord, I'll never do that again if you'll just help me and if I could just never do that again." And guess what? We find ourselves doing it again. You want to find a rock and crawl under it and try and hide because what? How could we ever? That's where we actually become disgusted with ourselves. How could we ever do that? But you know, the Lord knew. He's never been surprised about us. Not one time in our life has he ever been surprised about anything we've ever done &gt;&gt; because he's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly who we would be and how we would act. &gt;&gt; But he still put his seed inside of us. &gt;&gt; And that is the mystery. The greatest mystery on this earth today is that Christ would actually be inside of human beings again. Are you serious? The devil can't believe that. That's why he continually comes after us. But you know Moses, brother Brandham in this message, he talks about Moses. Moses, he says, I think of Moses and how that Moses standing up there on the mount by the side of this burning bush. He had lost all hopes of freedom. He'd lost all hope of freedom in that in that spot he was in. He was at the top. He was with Pharaoh. He he was in control. He was educated. He had money. He didn't have any needs or wants in his life. Although he probably did, but he he he anything he wanted, he could have. And then he found out that he was actually not cut from the same cloth. And what did he do? He went and murdered someone because he saw his brothers and sisters being mistreated. And what did he do from there? He ran away. He was on the back side of the desert having that backside of the desert experience. Brother Brandham says he had 40 years in Egypt getting all polished up and scholarly king-like ready to take over the Pharaoh's throne. And then he went to the backside of the desert for 40 years to get all of that learning out of him. &gt;&gt; And it was there in his 80s that he met this burning bush. &gt;&gt; He met this burning bush. And he says, "I think that Moses standing up there on the the mount on the side of this burning bush, he'd lost all hopes of freedom. But yet something inside of him was attracted to that burning bush. In some places, brother Brad Brownham says, many people probably saw that bush and thought, "Whatever. It's a bush on fire. Got sheep to deal with. We got problems. We've got situations. Let's carry on." But something inside of Moses said, "No, no, no. I'm going to turn aside and see what this is all about." It's the same thing for a believer today. If you've turned and looked at this message, there's something inside of you that's caused that. It's not just something maybe that we would think is an ordinary circumstance or situation. Brother Bam says, and I think it's the same today. Uh that many of us, we lose sight of our freedom. Have you ever lost sight of your freedom? I know I feel like I have in times. It it's it's situations that come around. something happens in our life and it feels like we'll never be able to see it. Like we said earlier, we make the worst thing is to make a promise to God and then actually break it. I don't want to look for a show of hands, but I'm I'm thinking probably I'm not the only one who has broken a promise to God, but isn't it wonderful that we have a God who is rich in mercy? &gt;&gt; He'll never leave us or forsake us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know to Moses this situation it was revolutionary. It revolutionized his life and all of his thinking. Brother Brandham says but he says you you lose all thought of freedom as soon as the doctor says that it's incurable. Talking about the human condition how we can get caught up in circumstances and situations. It can be hopeless. Maybe a counselor will tell us it's hopeless. Maybe a doctor will tell us it's incurable. Maybe someone will say, "I'll never forgive you." Doesn't matter what happens on this side of eternity. We're dealing with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that he can't do. &gt;&gt; But as human beings, we can lose all thought of freedom. Sometimes it's addiction, smoking, drinking, and and I said this down there in the States, even pornography. We can give up hope and think that there's no way that we could ever be delivered from this temptation or this devil. Whatever it is in our life, I'm here to tell you he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Don't lose sight of your freedom. Don't lose hope of your freedom. That's what the devil wants you to do. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says, "Why, brother, if we'd ever come in the presence of God like Moses did, why it was a revolutionary to him. why it would revolutionize. And I just wonder tonight when I read this, I think how many people would not want to be revolutionized. &gt;&gt; I know I would want to be revolutionized. I I want to be revolutionized more than I am even now. &gt;&gt; But you know, I just want to say this and people might say, "Brother Barry, you're getting carnal." And I don't care. I'm going to do it. &gt;&gt; Happy birthday, Sister Crystal. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a sister whose life was revolutionized. &gt;&gt; We first met, we first met in a church fellowship. And when I met her, she was bald. That is a revolutionized person. &gt;&gt; She came in contact with that same pillar of fire &gt;&gt; that Moses did. &gt;&gt; Happy birthday, sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I literally thought when brother Joel turned up, I didn't know who he was. She was this guy turned up and I thought this other guy turned up. These two guys turned up. She had no hair. Come to find out that she's a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Just amazing. We all have to be revolutionized by this pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; In the light of that angel of God standing there on that mountain that day. I love how he does that. It wasn't a pillar. It wasn't a burning bush. It wasn't a pillar of fire. It was a light of that angel standing there on the mount that day. The angel of God standing there on that mountain that day. Everything that he once had or thought never would happen come to be a reality. And I can tell you this guy's been revolutionized exactly that way. Because right around that time that was happening in my life, I had never thought that I would have a family. I never thought that I would ever dare go to church. I never thought that I would ever ever have a life worth living. That I would just be a single bachelor bum kind of guy. But look at what happens when you get in the presence of that light. Now, I want to say this, brothers and sisters. Where's the presence of that light? It's not necessarily in a bunch of special meetings. Sometimes it's in a Wednesday evening service. Sometimes it's just in someone's living room where you're talking about the pillar of fire. The angel of the Lord will come in &gt;&gt; and quicken that seed that's in that life. Brother Bradom says that I think if men and women today would ever step into the light of the Holy Spirit under the uncction of God's spirit and the light of God's word, everything that God has promised will illuminate to you &gt;&gt; and be real again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that he's promised &gt;&gt; will illuminate and become real. These are all quotes out of the the arrow of God's deliverance shot from a bow in 1956. He says, "The reason Moses failed in the first place, and it's the reason why everyone fails, the reason why he failed in the first place, here's what was the matter. It was the lack of having what the burning bush had, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That anointing." He says, "That's right. And what's our failure today is lack of having what the Holy Spirit has. Now, some people might be saying even right now tonight in this church, Brother Barry, that was 1956. It's 2025. The book is open. Da da da. There's no more mysteries. You know, we're all learning at different rates. There's children that don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that need the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They need exactly that light, that life that was in that burning bush, just like we received as elders now in this word. &gt;&gt; But the same thing today is failure of the lack of what the Holy Spirit has. Outside of that, brothers and sisters, this is just religion. &gt;&gt; We have to say it. It's a one room schoolhouse. And I know we have people who understand it more and and have experienced more, but there's some that haven't. &gt;&gt; And I really hope and pray that some of the elders have and that they haven't neglected to actually experience it that way. &gt;&gt; But you know, this promise is to us. This is where brother Brandham starts to to change a little bit and where I start to get a little bit excited. He says, "If we receive the Holy Spirit, then all things are possible." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. not only possible but promised to us. &gt;&gt; I think it's an amazing thing to hear those words to to realize they're promised to us. They're not promised to everyone. We know his disciples said to Jesus when he was here, why do you speak in parables all the time? And he said to them, "If I do, then they should actually they'll be able to hear it and then they'll understand it. They'll be converted in their hearts and then they'll be saved. But it's not given to them. Blessed are your ears, for they have been given the ability to hear these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are the only ones that have been chosen to receive this word. But he says, if we receive the Holy Spirit, then all things are possible. Not only possible, but promised to us. Jesus said, "Ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it. If ye abide in me and my words in you, ask what you will, it shall be given to you." You see, when we step into the light of God's word with the uncction of the Holy Spirit to shine the light on it, brother, the impossible becomes little things. Then &gt;&gt; the doctor says you're going to die. I can never die. How could How can I die? I had a vindicated prophet tell me that I could never die. &gt;&gt; And you're a doctor here on earth telling me that I'm going to die. &gt;&gt; What's the vindication of your ministry? I can show you the vindication of his ministry. I ain't going to die. I can never die. &gt;&gt; I'll just fly away. &gt;&gt; But you know the critical factor to it is it's not how many years we've been in it. It's not how good people we are. It's not how we act or even think, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's got nothing to do with any of that. It's only about having faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's all about not having fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can look at the world today and and there's a lot of people living in fear tonight &gt;&gt; with what's going on in the US today. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people going around living in fear now. They've been living in fear for a while. But you know what's even more fearful to think is over in Poland now they're saying that Russia launched drones and all of the NATO alliance now all of Europe sprang to action last night. The closest they've ever been since World War II &gt;&gt; to open conflict is the words that are actually bouncing around. How close is it? How far down the road are we brothers and sisters? But we don't have to be afraid at all. &gt;&gt; I ain't saying that to make fear. I am saying that to create faith, to remind us about what the vindicated prophet said. Before any of that nonsense goes on, we go home. &gt;&gt; But you know, the key to it is we've only been asked to believe it. &gt;&gt; We've only been asked to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can't help but think that's what that promise was given to that that king who was was a backslider there. He was given a promise and all he had to do was believe it. But brother Brandham talks about how he just did his church duty. He did a civic duty. He took the arrows. The prophet gave them to him. He went down and made a show and said, "Oh, oh my father, my father, the chariots of Israel, the horsemen thereof." He said, "Oh, there's more more importance to you than the whole entire armies of of Israel." He made a show of it. And he did what? He did his his religious duties, but he didn't have revelation. He had the arrow of God's deliverance in his hand as the king. All he had to do was go by revelation. Now it's in my hand. It's not in the prophet's hand. It's in my hand. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "You have the mind of Christ. You have thus sayaith the Lord." &gt;&gt; And you have the mind of Christ to know what to do with those arrows. So smite the ground. smite your enemy. &gt;&gt; More specifically, &gt;&gt; Adam says God asks us to believe his word. He sends the Holy Spirit to energize that word when he falls into it. when we fall into his word, when his word falls into us, if we're willing to take the steps that he's given according to his word, Acts 2:38, to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins, then he sends the gift of the Holy Ghost when until but he sends it. That's the promise. It's ours. He's promised it. And when he does that, he energizes the word that we hear and it becomes a brand new Bible. This message becomes a brand new message. All the ways that we thought before in the past, we can recognize they might not have actually lined up with the word of God for our day and we just want to recalibrate, you know, in our GPS. Sometimes we just need to hit recenter. We could be driving down the road and notice, wait a second, I know that it should show further down the road. I know that I should see a little bit of a different action on that GPS. So, I just need to hit that button, reenter. Sometimes I think that's what we need to do as a church of the living God, as human beings. Just hit that button, reenter, just come to church and say, "Lord, be it unto me according to your word." Sometimes I don't understand why I am the way I am. I don't understand what's going on the way it is. I feel like maybe my experience has gone just a little bit cold. We heard it on Thursday night. It was so good. We flew in Thursday during the day and we were able to find out they had a Thursday evening service. That's their midweek service. But brother Wayne, he preached a little bit and he talked about how sometimes we'll never see our salvation slip. &gt;&gt; Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption. We get the Holy Ghost. We know that's what the prophet taught us. We get the Holy Ghost forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't get it one day and then lose it the next and and and and and it doesn't happen that way. But what he said was sometimes things can slip in our lives. Sometimes we just don't have enough time for prayer. Sometimes we don't have enough time for reading the Bible. Sometimes we just don't have enough time for fellowship. Sometimes we let relationships slip. Sometimes we'll actually let work or pressures of life get in the way from being in church. Sometimes we have to travel. That's right. But when we come to the place where we say, "Ah, I'm just tired. I'm going to stay home and I'll just stream it or I'll pick it up tomorrow or whatever." When that starts to happen, that becomes problematic. That's what we're talking about. Life takes place. We travel. We live our lives. God knows. Brother Brandham says it's okay to go fishing and miss church. He says that. I say I'm so thankful for a prophet that loved to fish. &gt;&gt; But he says you don't plan your trip so that you're not in church. You plan your trips so that you can be in church. But once in a while it happens where you just can't be in church. But we know that God is with his people everywhere they go. &gt;&gt; And he knows our heart desire. If we're running away to go and get away from church, that's what we're talking about. There's a problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God asks us only to believe his word. He sends his Holy Spirit to energize that word. When he falls into it, when the word's being preached and the Holy Spirit brings the word, he energizes and flashes the same light of God's blessed promise. And you know, brothers and sisters, I just can't help but think that's exactly what happened in 2 Kings 13:21. They didn't recognize what was going on. Let's just jump down to 21 of 2 Kings chapter 13. I think we read this last Sunday. And it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band of men. Now the men were coming through the land. They were actually getting invaded. That king could have actually smoked till the enemy was gone. But he here's the enemy coming through the land. So behold, they spied a band of men and and they cast the man into the suppler of Elisha. It was convenient where they could just throw him in there and and he would be safe and they could quickly hide. And when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood up upon his feet. Let's not keep that back there. Some people want to do that and that's fine. But I think the church of the living God who understands the seventh angel messenger, Revelations 10:7, Luke 17:30, all of the key scriptures, Malachi 45:5 and 6, we have seen Elijah. And this Elijah anointing is just as powerful tonight as it was back there. And if we could just ever get ourselves down into that septa, I'm not saying run to Jeffersonville, Indiana. Don't buy a plane ticket and run there. I'm I although there is an anointing there, but there's just the same anointing here. Brothers and sisters, his word says where two or three are gathered together in his name that he's there and he's greater than the prophet. &gt;&gt; We know that greater than a Solomon is even here even tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this anointing, this anointing is what I want to talk about tonight. This anointing is our anointing. This is the anointing that we get through this vindicated prophet. It's the same prophet. It's a matching time, brother Brandham says. You know that's true. It's a matching time. Amen. They must have went home. That's right. Listen, it's true. Now, now I'm going to tell you, my brother, I don't care whether my shoes matches my trousers or my trousers matches my coat. He says this, I want my experience to match God's Bible. &gt;&gt; That's the matching time. He says, "If you want to match something, match your experience against Paul's." &gt;&gt; Many people will say, "Well, we match our experience to our church, to our theological institution, to the mothership, our association. Does any of that match Paul's experience? Because if it doesn't, why do you do it?" &gt;&gt; He was the first church age messenger. I know why. Because we want a meal ticket. Because we're afraid. We preach this real hard down south. You know what? Just just try God at his word. His word in Malachi says, "Prove me in this and see if I won't pour out a blessing from heaven that you can't even contain." &gt;&gt; But he says, "If you want to match something, match your experience against Paul's." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, we we talked about it down there. It's more than just tithing. It's more than just tithing. Just getting obedient to God's word brings such a blessing, such an incredible blessing to our lives where we would attract other people. They would say, "What is it about you? Why are you the way you are?" And you can say, "Come see a man who told me the things that I've done. Come and see what it's all about. Just come one time and get in that anointing that we're talking about and see if it does anything for you." &gt;&gt; But it's got to match Paul's experience. Amen. That's what we need today is a matching time with Paul's faith in the Bible. That's our example, right? And now, if you know, if you've studied the Hebrews series, you know, brother Brandham, he talks about it. How Paul, he actually was knocked off the horse when he was on his road to Damascus to lay waste the church of the living God. He was going to do his thing. And what happened? He was knocked off his high horse. He got a revelation from God and and he went into the city and and we know the story. He lost his vision. He got his vision. But what happened? He was a scholar. He was the Hebrew of Hebrews of the tribe of Benjamin circumcised on the eighth. We know the whole story about Paul. But what did he do? He didn't just take and say, "Well, I had a tremendous experience. Now hear me." &gt;&gt; He went into the backside of the desert just like Moses did. And he found that pillar of fire for himself. But where did he find it? Was in the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; He needed to see if all of this stuff being talked about, all of his experience now lined up with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this tonight, if we have any questions about this message of the hour, take it back to the word of God. &gt;&gt; See if it doesn't line up. See, if it's not exactly according to Paul's experience, &gt;&gt; and you'll see it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it's a separating time. this borderline believing this halfway lukewarm. Do you know the Bible said this day would come? The Leodysian church age. He said you would just be a lukewarm and make God sick at his stomach. He said he would spew you from his mouth. The Leodysian just enough religion to make you sick. I hope no none of us are that way in our hearts. &gt;&gt; I say Lord help me. I don't want a religion. I don't excuse me. I don't want a tradition. I don't want to be that way, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I want to be on fire. &gt;&gt; I want to be on fire for the Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, "We're still longing for the things of the world. Say, I'd better not do that." Oh, brother, if I wanted to do it, I'd do it. But I know tonight that there's a good old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It makes you love God so well, you don't care to do it anymore. Amen. And you know, brother Bammy talked about it. I I drink as much as I want to drink. I smoke as much as I want to smoke. And and I do all the things that I want to do. I'm going to say it this way tonight. I I look at as much pornography as I want to. Not because I do, but I'm saying it that way because I don't have the desire to do it, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you, I would be a liar if I said I've never been tempted to. Let's just call it straight. It's an evil devil that's attacking the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you know what? An exposed devil is a dead devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And as long as we keep him undercover and pretend like nothing's happening, he's just going to keep right on going. But let's call it as it is. &gt;&gt; It's just a temptation. But if that temptation is given into, it can become an addiction. And if that addiction gets a hold, then it's going to make us feel like we've lost all hope for freedom. &gt;&gt; All of that freedom is still completely available tonight. &gt;&gt; He's still calling tonight. He's still offering an abundance of deliverance tonight. &gt;&gt; And all we've got to do is raise our hands and say, "Forgive me, Lord." Even right now where we're sitting, we can just say, "Forgive me, Lord." He knows your heart. We don't have to carry around these burdens. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's a devil. &gt;&gt; But you know, his word said, "Come out from among her. &gt;&gt; Come out from among them, my people. Be ye separate." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants us to know the truth. God loves the truth, and the truth shall set you free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God wants you to know the truth. Christ is the truth, the Holy Ghost. This is why I harp about it, brothers and sisters. We have been given the arrow of God's deliverance. &gt;&gt; And as as I talk about this, I just can't help but think, you know, the children of Israel were given the deliverance in their time in Gan. &gt;&gt; They had seen all of the promises come to pass. They'd seen the signs and the wonders, but now the death angel was coming through the land. I can only imagine that they struck those doorposts and they struck the lentil. They wanted to make sure that that blood token was going to stick. &gt;&gt; We have the ability to do that with the arrow of God's deliverance. &gt;&gt; The anointing that we've been given by the prophet in our day is an arrow shot from a bow. &gt;&gt; And you know it's an arrow of deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we've been given the arrows to take in our hands and smite the enemy &gt;&gt; until he's done. &gt;&gt; Don't stop smiting, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham, he talks about this king. This old king Joash heard that the prophet was sick and he went down to visit him. And when he went to visit him, he didn't come irreverent. He would come with respect. He walked up. He had enough God about him to know that he must visit this prophet with respect. So he walked up and wept over him and said, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel, horsemen thereof." And when he did, God had respect for him. &gt;&gt; God gave him respect. You know, even Ahab, he was a bad dude. &gt;&gt; He didn't listen to the anointing of God. But if you read in the word, you'll see it. I I don't know where it is in Kings, maybe, but where Ahab was such a bad guy, he finally got enough. God had enough of him, and he said, "You know what? The prophet told him this thing about you letting the neck turn your head. The woman's ruling your house. This evil woman is taking control of everything. And now you've let her go and kill Neabboth who was supposed to get his father's inheritance. Now we're done. &gt;&gt; The dogs are going to lick your blood and the dogs are going to eat her. We know that was given to him. And when he heard that, what did he do? The Bible says that he walked softly. Oh no. Woo! I done it this time. He wasn't walking around with his chest out. Oh, I'm the king and I've got this woman and you know, he walked softly. And the word says that God honored it and said, "You know what? I won't do it in your day. Your eyes won't see it, but your kids are going to get it." &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom says, "See, that's the way you want to get something from God. Don't come around a meeting. I love how he says this because it's the same today. Don't come around a meeting like this to make fun. Don't come around to pack some kind of a tail from one place to another. If you do that, you'll never get nowhere with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never. We won't. But if we come with the right attitude, &gt;&gt; but if we come with the wrong attitude, what's going to happen is we're going to mess up the service for everyone else and we're going to lose the blessing ourselves. He says, if you do that, you'll never get nowhere with God. Don't read the Bible to fuss about it. And I say this tonight, don't read the message to fuss about it. &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Just believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But some people would say, "Well, then you're just following a cult." And maybe for some people that's as far as it'll ever go. Maybe there just isn't the seed chain of God inside to actually be quickened when this word comes. We know that there was millions of people in the in in in the days of Israel when they were coming out of bondage. They just never had faith in their heart to mix with that word. That's what brother Brandham said the difference was. There was nothing in them to mix with that word. Even though the generations down the road down the road down the road, they had the word standing in front of them. the word made flesh standing in front of them. And they said, "Oh, we have Abraham to father." And he said, "Don't you think that I could raise up stones? Oh my. Don't you think that you your father is going to save you because if you believed him, you would actually believe me." &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't read the Bible to fuss about it. Read the Bible to live it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Read the Bible to live it. And then he just goes into, "You know what we need?" He says, "So then when he went down there and he seen him and respected him, he said, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel, there are other horses." In other words, my father, you're worth more than all the chariots of Israel and all the horsemen thereof. How true that is. I say tonight, though Elijah was considered a holy roller, it's interesting that he says it this way because it was Elisha. But Elijah was considered a holy roller, a fanatic by the modern world. Yet he his presence in the nation was worth more than all the horses and chariots they had. And I'll say tonight, a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost tent meeting is more to protect us than all the atomic bombs that we could create in a million years. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful to think? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it just it just reinforces to me there's really only one thing and that is the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; in our lives. then all of this message when it's preached will just become alive to us. We'll understand it and and and it will become a new the Bible will become a new book. But he goes on to say he said God had respect and because he come and approached it reverently God had respect to him. And I I want to say tonight brothers and sisters if we have a need in our lives even if we don't understand it even if it feels like maybe we've sinned away our day of grace I want to tell you tonight he's still calling. The windows of heaven are open and and his blessings are still falling. And alls we have to do is approach him correctly. And if we're willing to do that, he's there waiting and ready to forgive our transgressions. You know what? I would say this. He's already forgiven our transgressions. We just need to recognize it &gt;&gt; because it was all paid for once and for all at Calvary, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; One time. Amen. one sacrifice and that one went and sat down on the right hand of the father on high to be the intercessor for our saints. But because he came the right way, God app God had respect for him. He respected Elijah. He says he said, "Oh my father, how we need you." God respected it and he respected Elijah and God respected him. And I want to say this tonight, whether we understand it or not, let's not have disrespect for the prophet in our day, for Elijah in our day. &gt;&gt; Boy oh boy, when we start doing that, God's not going to have respect for us. &gt;&gt; He says, if you'll respect God's Bible and God's Holy Spirit, he will respect you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't try to contradict it or say it isn't so. Just believe it. That's all. &gt;&gt; And I know that's where the intellectuals will say, well, we need to understand it. We need to explain it. You know, the word says that we need to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. And if we're not careful, we can be the message believers and all the rest of the people or maybe serpent seed and maybe cannon fodder at best. And you know, we want to try and convert people. So, we're going to live a life that's going to be a message believer and we're going to have the the pompous attitude in this world. We're smarter than that, aren't we? &gt;&gt; Aren't we smarter than that? &gt;&gt; We understand that we're not going to attract people by behaving that way. &gt;&gt; Legalism is going to detract people. &gt;&gt; Love is going to attract people. &gt;&gt; Love is what's going to get people's attention. They're going to say, "What is it about you? Everyone else is a backstabber. Everyone else has negative thoughts and negative words. But there's something different about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't contradict it. Just just just believe it. And I think that we have the opportunity. I you know, we've talked about it in the church age book. Brother Brandham really drills down on it. You know, there's going to be people that don't have their name on the book of life right now tonight &gt;&gt; that will get their name put on it. &gt;&gt; That's right. just for one reason &gt;&gt; and that's for doing good to the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just for doing good to the bride of Jesus Christ, just for a cup of cold water won't be forgotten. We have the opportunity to set the atmosphere in our lives for people. And brother Bradam said, "I want to take as many people with me as I can." Amen. &gt;&gt; I just don't think it's the right attitude if we think that people are just scum and you know they they deserve it, you know, whatever they get. No, no, no, no. We want to see every single soul go that could go. We want to see the Lord's people redeemed. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on to say, he that's just about the same that's happened tonight in the Christian church. We've struck the arrow of God's deliverance. And he said it was. God sent the arrow of deliverance to us. The arrow of deliverance is the Holy Spirit that's been sent. &gt;&gt; Shot from the bow of God's love. Right. &gt;&gt; When the eternity to eternity was pulled together by the cord of love, God shot the arrow of deliverance into the church on the day of Pentecost. And the church was given in her hands. Hallelujah. The church was given in her hand the arrow of God's deliverance. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what is the arrow of God's deliverance? He says it, but he talks about how the church is striking short with it. And I I just think it's so beautiful because this king was given instruction. And if he only had revelation to mix with that word to with that instruction that came that he had those arrows &gt;&gt; and there was no limit to the amount of times that he could have struck but he limited himself for some reason. He brother Ratomy he says in the church tonight hear me the church tonight is still striking short. In other places he says that we live miles below our privilege. Help us Lord not to live below our privilege. &gt;&gt; And the church tonight, hear me, the church tonight is still striking short. The church has struck short of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It struck short of deliverance from sin. &gt;&gt; It struck short. I want to say tonight, brothers and sisters, have we struck short in our lives in any areas? And I'll tell you, I know I've struck short. And I've struck short even as a pastor here. I'm not afraid to admit it, &gt;&gt; but that don't mean that I've struck out. &gt;&gt; And it don't mean that you've struck out. We have the ability to strike hard our enemy and not stop &gt;&gt; until he's done. &gt;&gt; And I think it's a literal thing. He says, "Oh, you say I belong to church, brother. When you got that baptism of the old Holy Ghost, when you got that baptism of the Holy Ghost, it takes that old temper out of you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We don't make excuses for this and say, "Well, it's just this and well, it's just that." Brother Brandham, he says it takes that old temper out of you. That's what the Holy Ghost does. It puts you on a dress and makes you act like a lady. And I said this in the States. I said, "Now, I ain't saying go put on a dress to the men. Don't do it. That's not what he's saying here. He's talking to the sisters that believe wearing pants is okay. And I'm sure we all understand that tonight, but we are maybe live or being recorded and people need to know that. Unfortunately, it's the world that we live in. &gt;&gt; It causes the women to put on a dress. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To not wear a garment that pertains to a man according to what Paul taught the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I would say this, it causes the women to recognize that it's inappropriate to try and be the leaders. &gt;&gt; It's inappropriate to try and preach in a church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because that's what Paul taught. &gt;&gt; But that's what the Holy Ghost says. It puts on a dress and makes you act like a lady. It'll make you quit your smoking, your drinking, your lying, your stealing, and everything. And I'll say it loud and clear. You don't have to be a member of a 12step program for the rest of your life claiming that you are an alcoholic. &gt;&gt; There comes a point in time where you recognize that you're no longer an alcoholic. In fact, you never were an alcoholic. You just were a crow that was tied by the ankle by a demon. You always were a son of the living God. And you can live in a free life, a totally free existence. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. It'll make you quit your smoking and drinking and lying and stealing and everything. You know, one of the worst ones in there is lying because you don't smoke and you don't stink like smoke and you're not drinking and you're not burping and swearing and acting like a drunk. But boy, those little white lies and and what's worse, a little white lie or a big lie? I'll tell you. I got an opinion. I'm strongly opinionated with this. those little white lies are worse. &gt;&gt; And the word says that it's the little foxes that spoil the viide. It's not the big things. It's just those little tiny foxes, those little white lies. Because those little lies turn into other lies and other lies and other lies and other lies. And we know the word of God says that unfortunately there will be no room for liars in that city. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it'll make you quit your smoking. It'll make you quit your drinking. It'll make you quit your lying, your stealing. And and I love what he says here. Everything. &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; Brother, when you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it separates you. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mix you with the world. &gt;&gt; It separates you from the world. &gt;&gt; And I love it. We had a conversation one time in a young people's and one of the brothers he said you know sometimes your own testimony of being a believer living as a believer even if you try and blend in with those other people in the youth they'll say no you can't do that because that's not you won't even let you do that &gt;&gt; your own testimony precedes your life which is amazing brother Brandham goes on to say it delivers you from all the things of the world amen it makes you love God makes you go go to church. It makes you worship him. &gt;&gt; It makes you tell your neighbor about it. &gt;&gt; It makes you live above sin. &gt;&gt; Brown. I mean, in this message, he says, "Why we ain't a modern denomination, but the modern church has struck short of it." That's why I'm so thankful that we're not a modern church. The first time I came into the church in the upper room, it reminded me of my grandmother's church. Not even my church that I grew up in downtown Calgary, Emanuel Assembly of God. It was just a little Pentecostal church in Claire's home, Alberta. And I this summer went to a funeral there. My aunt passed away and that was her church where she went to. And I was able to go in there and just relive some memories. But the church, when I first came to the upper room when brother Ken was a pastor and there's just a few families here, it was it just reminded me so much of being a little kid and going to church with my grandmother and there was reverence in the building there. It was reverent. People came in and sat down and there was someone softly playing and it was just it was just amazing. It was just exactly what I needed at the right time. But brother Brown, I mean, he talks about why we're not a modern church. The modern church has struck short of it. And if you ever see the way modern churches behave, you understand they have struck short of it. Oh, they say we got a church. We got a good teacher. We got theology. Sometimes they've got 30 teachers. &gt;&gt; He says that's about as much as you know about it. Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line. Hallelujah. God sent the baptism of the Holy Ghost to put it into the hands of the church. the arrow of God's deliverance to deliver from sickness, from sin, from worry, from trouble, from worldliness, from everything else, &gt;&gt; but we've struck short of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I trust tonight, brothers and sisters, that if we've struck short of it sometimes in our life, we do. &gt;&gt; I've done it. &gt;&gt; Don't stay short of it. &gt;&gt; Pick up the arrows and strike hard. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "God shot his arrow of deliverance. The baptism of the Holy Ghost in the last days has come to the Gentiles in the Western countries." I'll call them musicians. And God shot the arrow of deliverance to us. So, not just to the Gentiles on mass on the Isuza Street revival, which he did. Those people that were there, whoever was there, just fell under that anointing and and got to see it. But he's sent his arrow of deliverance to us. &gt;&gt; And he says, we have just about struck it long enough to make oursel, oh, I'm assembly. Hallelujah. I belong to the church of God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. That don't do you a bit of good, right? &gt;&gt; And you know where brother Barry would go here with this. I belong to the message of the hour. Nope. It's not enough, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet. The devils believe that and they tremble too because they know it's true. They recognize what happened. Just being a part of it ain't enough. We have got to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, brothers and sisters. And if we've got it, we need to teach our children that. He says, "Brother, it's not an organization." Maybe stand with me as we read these last couple. Brother, it's not an organization that God said strike with. It's not being a member. It's not because we're here that we strike with it. &gt;&gt; God never said strike with an organization. He said it's given to each individual to strike against the powers of the devil. &gt;&gt; For sickness, it's sickness, sin, filthiness, backbiting, cussing. Oh my worldiness. Amen. You know, I've heard about it recently and and and in the past, you know, sometimes people will cuss. There's something wrong there. Believers don't cuss. &gt;&gt; Believers don't lie. &gt;&gt; Believers don't smoke or drink. But there's deliverance from this filthiness and backbiting. Brother Brandham's saying this. The Elisha for our day. I just can't help but think, brothers and sisters, he's gone off the scene just like this prophet went off the scene. Before he did, he gave the bow to the king and and he said, "Open the window." And when he did, he put his hands on that king's hands. I can't help but think that prophets put his hands on our hands tonight. &gt;&gt; He says, "We strike short." Oh, we we go over to church and we join church and we think that's all right. That's not all right, brother. Don't strike short of nothing of God's blessings. The Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Strike it. Amen. Don't be afraid. We don't have to be afraid. Strike it. If we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, then we have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To know what to do with it. God said so. I'm the Lord that heal thee. Strike it. God said so. It's the arrow of deliverance. It's brought into the church tonight. And you know, even though that was 1956, Hebrews 13:8, do you agree? &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; The exact same anointing that was on those bones of Elisha is the exact same anointing that comes from reading this prophet's message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's not this prophet's message. It's God's message through this prophet. When we do that, brothers and sisters, the same anointing is is here right now amongst us. If anybody has any troubles with anything in your life tonight, there is that deliverance right here, right now. You don't have to leave this building with that with you. &gt;&gt; Don't take it with you. Leave it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leave it here. Give it to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Drive down a stake and say, "From this time forwards, I'm not going to do that anymore. And Lord, give me strength. Help me to strike those arrows &gt;&gt; because he's given them to us. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for this message. Thank you for your arrow of deliverance that's been given to the Gentile church. And Lord, even further than to the G gentile church, Lord, to your bride, to your believers. We know that Lord, you're still calling. And we thank you for that. Lord, we can see the the oncoming storm is becoming so prevalent in this world. But Lord, you have given us deliverance. You have given us a way of escape, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we know that's in you. Father, tonight I pray that if anyone has struck short, Lord, in their life, Father, we know it's not a group experience. It's all about the individual experience. Help us, Lord Jesus, to grab a hold of those arrows and strike, Lord, until we see a change in our lives. &gt;&gt; Let us not let up, not one bit, even if we do see a change. Help us, Lord Jesus, to not get weary. Help us to not get complacent, Lord, but help us to be fervent on fire for you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Knowing that you will deliver us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you will deliver our children. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That you will deliver our spouse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll deliver our marriage. &gt;&gt; You'll deliver our church, Father. You'll deliver our young people. Every one of us needs deliverance, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help us to not strike short. Father, we ask. &gt;&gt; And if anybody has any needs, Father, tonight, Lord, we pray together, united in one mind and one accord, that you would meet those needs, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we need deliverance from any one of those things that were mentioned tonight, Father, Lord Jesus, we just ask Lord humbly that you would deliver us from it now in the name of Jesus Christ. Help us, Lord, to have the right approach to you to be sincere, oh Lord, and to give you the preeminence that you desire in our lives. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you. We just ask Lord now that as we go our separate ways that we would see the arrow of your deliverance in our lives individually Lord Jesus. Father we pray for brother Andrew as he travels Lord as he wraps up service tonight in Vancouver that Lord you would just bring him here safely Lord and Father help us Lord to push aside all of our carnality and allow you to wash us by the water of your word this weekend father. Lord, we love you and we thank you. We just ask now that you would be glorified in a couple songs. Lord, we ask that you would be with those who are away tonight, wherever they are, that you would just minister to them sovereignly, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if it be your will for us to meet again Friday night, Lord, we'll bring a song in our hearts and we will worship you, Father. &gt;&gt; We'll give you praise. &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. We ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Keep me true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. There's a race that I must run. &gt;&gt; True, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. &gt;&gt; There's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour. Keep me true. Keep me true, Lord. Keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me true. [Music] Keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me true. There's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour. Keep me true. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that song. I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your mercy never fails me. I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me all my day even dead in sins and trespasses from the moment that I wake up until I lay my head. I will sing of the goodness of God.
