[12:20] Yes, Lord.
[12:24] There's nothing in this world that
[12:25] satisfies, Lord. It's only you, Lord.
[12:28] It's only your word. Lord, thank you for
[12:32] this atmosphere you've already given to
[12:34] us, Lord, this morning. I pray that
[12:36] you'll just continue to grow it, Lord.
[12:38] Open our hearts to receive your word.
[12:41] Lord, help the speaker just get in that
[12:44] channel, Lord, as we're all united with
[12:47] him, Lord, bringing out what we need in
[12:49] our hearts, in our lives, Lord. And
[12:51] you're willing and able to speak to what
[12:53] our needs are, Lord. Any needs that are
[12:56] represented, Lord, [music] you are more
[12:58] than willing to to meet them, Lord. Help
[13:00] us to ask abundantly, Lord. Not just
[13:03] &gt;&gt; not just what we think you're able to
[13:05] do, Lord, but just beyond that, Lord.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, God. Lord, if you need healing,
[13:11] Lord, if you need a touch from you,
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; If you need relationship healed,
[13:18] &gt;&gt; if you need a job, something, Lord,
[13:20] anything material, Lord,
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, you are able.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, pray that you would be with the
[13:27] all the children, Lord, that are in
[13:29] school these days. Lord, it's it's a
[13:31] dark world out there.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, pray that you would strengthen
[13:35] them and encourage them, Lord.
[13:39] Lord, all the people working in jobs as
[13:42] well. Lord, rubbing shoulders with
[13:44] people. The world is getting darker. The
[13:45] enemy's showing their face more and
[13:48] more.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, help our lights to shine. Not just
[13:52] &gt;&gt; not be just ashamed of anything. Lord,
[13:55] help us to
[13:57] just not to walk away from any any
[14:01] hindrance from you. Lord, that we would
[14:03] just not be ashamed just to say, "Yes,
[14:06] yes, that's what I believe." Yes. Lord,
[14:09] &gt;&gt; give us that courage. Pray that you
[14:11] would just be with us now in all that we
[14:13] do in service in Jesus name. Amen.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shake someone's hand as you seated
[14:22] this morning.
[14:24] Brother, sister in the Lord.
[14:28] Amen.
[14:31] Hear
[14:34] the prophet this week talk about Fanny
[14:37] Crosby. I [music] don't know if she
[14:38] wrote this song specifically, but
[14:41] was talking [music] about her testimony.
[14:43] I just love the songs of Fanny Crosby.
[14:46] But the Lord the Lord just I put this on
[14:48] my heart. What can wash away our sin?
[14:50] [music] Aren't you glad for the blood of
[14:51] Jesus this morning?
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing nothing stands in the way of
[14:55] that blood.
[14:56] I plead the blood [music] every single
[14:58] day when I'm down on my knees just
[15:00] before going to bed.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, would you cover me once
[15:04] more?
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Would you cover my family?"
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Like to Job, cover my family with that
[15:07] precious blood. The prophet talked about
[15:09] that bumper of blood. Remember when he
[15:10] was criticizing [music] that lady and
[15:12] God showed him that bumper blood and
[15:14] said, "That's your sin."
[15:15] &gt;&gt; There's a prophet of God that needed the
[15:17] [music] bumper blood. How much for us?
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it this morning with
[15:20] Revelation. Well, what can wash [music]
[15:25] away my sin?
[15:28] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

[18:44] sing. Well, I'm one of [singing] them.
[18:49] I'm one of them.
[18:53] I'm [music] so glad I can say I'm one of
[18:56] them. 532.
[18:58] Oh, [music] I'm one of them.
[19:02] I'm one of them. [music]
[19:05] I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them.
[19:10] [music]
[19:11] They were gathering
[19:15] or breaking [music]
[19:16] his name. They were baptized with the
[19:20] Holy Ghost and power. [music]

[21:35] shed [singing and music]
[21:36] for me.

[24:38] Thank you so much.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; To an outside listener, that might sound
[24:42] weird. How could the blood do that?
[24:44] Well, it's not the physical blood. It's
[24:46] the life in the blood. How does it give
[24:48] me strength? Well, not the blood. It's
[24:50] not a physical sample of it, but the
[24:52] spirit that was in it. It's called the
[24:53] Holy Ghost. It's called the Holy Ghost.
[24:56] That's what gives us strength. Blessed
[24:57] be his name this morning. Stand with me
[24:59] if you would. Going to sing that once
[25:01] more as the deacons come this morning.
[25:05] Well, it reaches [singing]
[25:08] to the highest [music]
[25:11] mountain
[25:18] [singing and music]
[25:21] when you come. Oh, that same blood that
[25:26] gives me strength
[25:28] from day [music]
[25:29] [singing]
[25:30] to day.
[25:33] [music]
[25:39] God bless you saints. We have a promise.
[25:42] We have a blood.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; It doesn't lose its power. Let's pray.
[25:47] Our dear heavenly father, what a
[25:50] privilege. What an honor
[25:53] this morning to know that you came to
[25:56] die for us, Lord.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; And the same blood
[26:01] doesn't lose its power.
[26:03] This morning, Father, we are here once
[26:05] again in your name
[26:07] &gt;&gt; to worship you, Lord,
[26:09] &gt;&gt; to transform our lives, Lord Jesus, by
[26:13] the hearing of the word, Lord. Father,
[26:15] we don't want to have any mixed signals
[26:20] that we are believers and sometimes we
[26:22] are doing otherwise. So, we ask you to
[26:25] help us, Lord,
[26:26] &gt;&gt; God,
[26:27] &gt;&gt; to leave the word that we believe this
[26:30] morning, Father. That is why we have
[26:32] come here Lord that you help us to
[26:35] perfect our lives Lord to reflect you.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[26:40] &gt;&gt; we want to thank you once again for this
[26:42] great opportunity given to us to
[26:44] assemble in your name. Lord, we've come
[26:46] with individual needs. Lord, we've come
[26:49] with our praises and our worship. Lord,
[26:52] we've come as we are. Lord,
[26:55] &gt;&gt; some are sick, but they made it here
[26:57] because they know that you are going to
[26:58] be here this morning because you
[27:00] promised to be here.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Some have come to bring their
[27:04] thanksgiving because they traveled and
[27:07] they are home and they want to come and
[27:09] say, "Lord, thank you for your travel
[27:11] mercy."
[27:13] Father, this morning once again,
[27:16] &gt;&gt; as your word is coming to us, Lord, may
[27:19] we have a place in our hearts to receive
[27:22] the word, Lord.
[27:24] If we have done anything wrong, Father,
[27:26] this morning, which we are,
[27:29] we ask you to forgive us this morning as
[27:32] we approach you once again. Bless each
[27:34] and everyone that made the effort to
[27:36] come here this morning. Those that could
[27:39] not make it for whatever reason, may you
[27:42] bless them as well.
[27:44] Father, we have many here and you have a
[27:47] servant that is going to come here and
[27:49] speak to us, Lord.
[27:53] I pray that Lord you help him Lord that
[27:55] we can have something from what he has
[27:58] for us this morning. Lord
[28:01] we know that Lord you can provide for
[28:03] each and everyone here.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; How do we know that even the birds in
[28:08] the air before you created them before
[28:11] you formed them they are going to stand
[28:12] on the electric line and not be
[28:14] electrocuted? You know it before the
[28:17] foundation of the world. That is why you
[28:19] provided something for them to hold the
[28:21] electric lines and not be electrocuted.
[28:23] And the same God that we serve this
[28:25] morning, you are able to provide for
[28:27] each and everyone that is meeting here
[28:29] this morning.
[28:31] We serve that God this morning. Only if
[28:34] we can believe you. Help us to believe
[28:36] you this morning. Once again, Father, we
[28:39] are bringing our tithes and offering. We
[28:42] pray that Lord, you receive it.
[28:45] Pray for brother Paul and the song the
[28:47] musicians behind me. They are doing
[28:50] their best. May we tap into that gift
[28:54] &gt;&gt; for in Jesus name that we pray over this
[28:56] offering. Amen.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you brother Peter.

[32:18] Let my heart [music]
[32:25] praise [music]
[32:26] you.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful.
[32:34] After Friday night's service, I was just
[32:36] so inspired and so encouraged that on my
[32:39] way home, I messaged Brother Paul. I'm
[32:40] like, "Brother Paul, I have to do a
[32:42] special on Sunday." Okay. So, this is a
[32:44] word of encouragement for you.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; This poem is called Born to Overcome.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; I think this is something that we always
[32:53] need to remember and focus on.
[32:56] Before the dawn had kissed the world,
[32:59] before the stars took flame, he knew
[33:02] your heart. He called your soul. He
[33:05] spoke and wrote your name.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; His word was planted deep within
[33:11] his life. You're a living son. You
[33:14] always was. You always are a child born
[33:18] to overcome.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose. It's to
[33:22] overcome all of the struggles and trials
[33:24] of this life.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; And you can do it.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Just surrender to him.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; When you first breathe that newborn air
[33:33] and learn to walk and fall, his hand was
[33:36] near.
[33:38] Though you knew not the one who guided
[33:41] all through childhood dreams and
[33:44] wandering steps, his light would softly
[33:46] come. For deep within, the seed
[33:49] declared,
[33:50] "You're born to overcome."
[33:54] &gt;&gt; You chased the world. You played its
[33:57] games. You sought its fleeting prize.
[34:00] But mercy found you
[34:03] &gt;&gt; where you fell and opened up your eyes.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[34:08] Though you were lost in shadows hold,
[34:10] his purpose still would run. For what
[34:13] was sown before all time, must rise to
[34:16] overcome.
[34:18] Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; In youth you stumbled, failed, and wept.
[34:22] Your pride would rise and fade.
[34:25] Yet every fall just proved again the
[34:28] work his hand has made. For even when
[34:31] you turned away and doubted what he
[34:33] done, the seed of God within your soul
[34:37] was growing to overcome.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Then grace revealed the cross to you,
[34:42] our Savior's crimson plan. The word made
[34:45] flesh, the spotless lamb, the sun became
[34:49] your stand. And when you saw his victory
[34:52] through blood and spirit won,
[34:55] &gt;&gt; you knew
[34:56] &gt;&gt; that you're chosen by him
[34:58] &gt;&gt; and born to overcome.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Now daily life becomes our ground where
[35:04] faith and patience grow and quiet work
[35:07] in simple ways. This kingdom starts to
[35:10] show. Each choice we make, each word we
[35:13] speak, each battle faced and won reveals
[35:17] the life that's in the seed.
[35:20] The life that overcomes.
[35:23] No storm can shake what God has swn. No
[35:27] trial turns us back. For every test just
[35:30] proves his strength and keeps us on the
[35:34] tracks. The spirit leads through calm
[35:36] and flame till all his will be done. And
[35:40] we reflect our father's life. His nature
[35:44] overcomes.
[35:45] So we will praise him all our days
[35:48] &gt;&gt; through fire, joy, and rain.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; For we were his before the world,
[35:53] &gt;&gt; and ever shall remain.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; The seed he spoke before all time
[35:59] [snorts]
[36:00] will shine like morning sun. For we are
[36:03] born of God himself
[36:05] and here to overcome.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Lord bless you all. [applause]
[36:14] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. Brother Farah,
[36:21] would you come? I was thinking of the of
[36:23] the two gifts. Here's brother Don with
[36:25] an amazing gift of poetry. Those of you
[36:27] who've been around for a long time know
[36:29] how many poems he's recited. I don't
[36:31] know if we have a collection of them,
[36:32] but they're incredible and they're
[36:33] they're they're inspired, very uniquely
[36:34] [music] inspired. And then we have a
[36:36] brother Faren that can sing like an
[36:39] angel. So somehow it's amazing what God
[36:41] does. He brings that gift and then this
[36:43] gift. So brother Faren, God bless you.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you everyone.
[37:19] Why should [singing and music] I feel
[37:23] discoura?
[37:29] [singing]
[37:38] Should my heart [singing]
[37:41] feel [music] on me
[37:45] and
[37:47] for heaven
[37:50] and
[37:54] then [singing and music] Jesus
[37:57] is
[37:59] my
[38:03] [singing]
[38:05] Grand is [music]
[38:11] his [singing]
[38:12] eyes
[38:14] on the sparrow
[38:20] and I know [singing and music]
[38:22] he watches
[38:25] me.
[38:29] I sing [music]
[38:30] [singing]
[38:31] because

[38:51] [music] the spell. [singing]
[38:55] And [music] I know he watches
[39:00] me. [singing]

[39:21] and [singing]
[39:23] resting on
[39:25] his goodness
[39:29] I begin to [singing and music] lose all
[39:32] my doubts
[39:34] and fears.
[39:38] go by
[39:41] the path
[39:43] you [singing] lead.
[39:47] But one
[39:49] step by [singing]
[39:52] mercy, [music]

[40:55] Oh, yes.
[40:57] And I know
[41:00] he [music and singing] watches
[41:02] me.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this last one together.
[41:06] Whenever
[41:08] I
[41:10] am tempted, [music and singing]
[41:15] whenever [music]
[41:17] the [singing] clouds
[41:19] arise,
[41:21] [music]
[41:24] when [singing] songs give place
[41:28] to sign, [music]
[41:32] when [singing] hope
[41:34] within
[41:36] me [music] die.
[41:40] I draw [singing]
[41:42] closer
[41:45] to him [music and singing]
[41:48] from care.
[41:51] He set
[41:53] his free. [music and singing]

[42:00] on
[42:01] the spiral. [singing]
[42:05] And I know [singing and music]
[42:08] he watches
[42:10] me.
[42:14] His eyes [singing]
[42:17] on
[42:19] the sparrow
[42:23] and know [music and singing]
[42:25] he watches
[42:27] me. All together let's sing. I sing
[42:29] because of I [singing] sing. [music]
[42:34] Because
[42:35] I'm happy.

[43:10] the [singing] spir.
[43:13] [music]
[43:14] And I know [singing]
[43:17] he watches [music]
[43:20] over me. [singing]
[43:23] Just one more song today.
[43:26] Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a
[43:28] hand. [applause]
[43:30] Thank you.
[43:33] Josh.
[43:36] [applause]
[43:37] Amen. Amen. Just one more part.
[43:42] I have the song in mind.
[43:45] I'm just going to use a backing track
[43:47] here.
[43:52] If you've been asking God for something,
[43:54] this song is an encouragement for you to
[43:56] pray on.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Pray on. The end is near, nearer than
[44:00] you think. Amen.
[44:04] Go ahead.
[44:27] The army [singing]
[44:29] of Judah
[44:31] was paralyzed by fear
[44:35] when they heard a [singing] mighty
[44:37] multitude
[44:39] was quickly drawing near.
[44:43] But [music] as they prayed [singing] for
[44:44] deliverance,
[44:46] the victory would begin.
[44:49] For when we call [singing and music]
[44:51] upon the Lord, we summon all of heaven.
[44:58] Pray on
[45:00] for you [singing and music] are who the
[45:02] Lord is looking for. Pray on
[45:08] for this will Jesus mighty strongholds
[45:12] down. Stay on [singing] your knees for
[45:16] this is where the battle is won.
[45:21] Very soon you [music and singing] win
[45:22] the victory. Pray on.
[45:32] When Daniel faced the lions
[45:36] for worshiping [music and singing] the
[45:37] Lord,
[45:39] it seemed there was no hope at all for
[45:43] what will be [singing] in store. [music]
[45:46] But when we stand on holy ground, our
[45:51] smallest praise is [singing] heard.
[45:54] Instead of forest circumstances,
[45:58] our eyes on the Lord. [singing]
[46:03] Pray on
[46:05] for you are who the Lord is looking
[46:08] [music] for. Ray on.
[46:13] See, tear them mighty strongholds down.
[46:17] Stay on your knees for this is where the
[46:23] battle is won.
[46:25] Very soon you'll win the victory. Pray
[46:30] on
[46:32] now. When your questions go unanswered
[46:34] [music and singing]
[46:36] and your prayers may seem in vain, they
[46:40] don't seem to make a difference. They
[46:44] don't seem to make a change.
[46:48] Just rest assured. God knows your needs
[46:52] and he is each time you pray.
[46:55] Your prayers are reaching heaven
[46:59] and the answers [singing] on the way.
[47:04] Pray on
[47:07] [music] for you are who the Lord is
[47:10] looking for.
[47:12] Pray on
[47:16] tear the mighty [singing] struggles
[47:18] down. Stay on your knees for this is
[47:24] where the battle is won.
[47:27] There's no better place for you [music]
[47:30] to be than seeking the father
[47:33] prayerfully.
[47:35] Very soon you'll win the victory.
[47:38] Oh, [singing]
[47:41] pray on.
[47:43] [music]
[47:49] Oh,
[47:52] pray.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Farah, brother
[48:09] Dylan. Just wonderful encouragements to
[48:11] us this morning. Wonderful to have the
[48:14] gifts that we have in the body this
[48:15] morning and just just how faithful the
[48:17] Lord is. I'm just thinking as you were
[48:19] singing, Brother Pharah, the scripture
[48:20] says when you don't have an all to
[48:22] stand, just stand.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; The prayer seems to go unanswered. It's
[48:26] not being unanswered. It's being
[48:28] answered.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Maybe a little different than we want it
[48:30] to be. But just stand. Just stand with
[48:32] the word. God bless you. Stand as if you
[48:34] would if with me if you would.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song. Lord, I want to
[48:39] love you more as our pastor comes.
[48:42] I think [music]
[48:43] my desire I've said this for a couple of
[48:46] years now. Maybe just the Lord just put
[48:47] it on my heart, but my entire intention
[48:50] for coming to church is to [music] leave
[48:52] one just to leave loving him more. Like
[48:55] if I feel like the through the ministry
[48:57] of the word, [music]
[48:58] &gt;&gt; through the gathering together, that
[49:00] that's how I leave. I believe the Lord's
[49:02] pleased for me. I need to leave here
[49:05] loving [music] him more. Trust you do as
[49:07] well. That's what he desires. He's a
[49:09] He's a He's an incredible husband. Just
[49:11] so incredible in every way. It's us that
[49:14] fail, but he never holds us down. He's
[49:16] not that kind of husband. He's not an
[49:17] abusive father. He's [music] none of
[49:19] that. He's loving. He's encouraging. And
[49:22] here we are this morning. We're here to
[49:24] receive from him.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; And boy, when the word comes forth,
[49:27] let's just pull on it because it's trans
[49:30] it's transforming. It will literally
[49:32] transform each of us. Let's sing it this
[49:33] morning.
[49:35] Lord, Lord, [singing and music] I want
[49:37] to love you more.
[49:42] [singing]
[49:42] [music] More than I ever have before.
[49:48] [music]
[49:50] You're so easy to adore.
[49:55] Is that the truth?
[49:57] Lord, I want to love you more. [music]
[50:02] I just want to serve you. Lord, I want
[50:06] to serve you more. [music and singing]
[50:11] More than I [music] ever have before.
[50:18] [music] You're so easy [singing] to
[50:21] adore.
[50:25] Lord, [music]
[50:26] I want to serve you. I want to know you
[50:29] more. [music]
[50:32] And I want [singing] to know you more.
[50:38] More than [music] I ever have before.
[50:44] [music]
[50:46] You're so easy to adore.
[50:50] [music]
[50:52] Oh Lord, I want to know you more.
[50:56] [music]
[50:58] I want to know you more. Lord, I want to
[51:01] know you more.
[51:04] [music]
[51:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[51:14] &gt;&gt; So easy to adore.
[51:20] Lord, I [music] want to [singing] know
[51:22] you more. I want to love you more. You
[51:25] want to love him more. Lord, I want
[51:28] [music] to love you more
[51:34] than [music] I ever have before.
[51:40] [music]
[51:41] You're so easy to adore,
[51:48] Lord. I want to [music] love you.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning.
[51:56] Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Is it on?
[52:01] Sometimes I can hear it, sometimes I
[52:03] can't. We're certainly thankful to be
[52:05] gathered together one more time in the
[52:07] name above every name.
[52:09] That is our provided place of worship.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; We certainly are thankful for our
[52:14] visitors in our midst. Uh God richly
[52:17] bless you. Um our friends from Texas.
[52:21] God bless you.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; We uh it's sorry it's uh I think it's is
[52:26] it brother op your brother right? And
[52:29] his wife his family.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Welcome. Um yeah,
[52:35] [applause]
[52:40] visiting from the Lone Star State. Um
[52:43] we'd also just like to warmly welcome
[52:47] uh the Kikuis in our midst um after the
[52:51] passing of their mama and grandma. You
[52:54] know, it's just been a week since she
[52:57] crossed over into glory and certainly
[53:00] thankful for her testimony and the life
[53:03] that she lived and
[53:04] &gt;&gt; the word says to train the children up
[53:07] in the way they should go.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; And it won't depart from them. And
[53:11] &gt;&gt; certainly thankful to see you here today
[53:13] and we trust
[53:14] &gt;&gt; that you want to love the Lord more
[53:17] through it.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; We know that the the trials of this life
[53:22] are not easy.
[53:24] And when we lose a loved one, that's a
[53:26] hole that can never be filled on this
[53:28] side of eternity.
[53:30] There's no getting over it. There's not
[53:33] even really getting used to it. It's
[53:34] just learning how to live with the new
[53:37] normal. And uh we certainly already miss
[53:42] Sister Gmaine, but we know she's in
[53:44] glory.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And you know, we have the promise that
[53:47] we'll see her again. Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; So, we just want to hold that promise
[53:52] close to our hearts for every one of our
[53:55] lives. We all [music] have loved ones
[53:57] that have gone on and uh we just
[53:59] certainly trust the Lord. If you have a
[54:01] need this morning, maybe just make it
[54:03] known unto him by way of an uplift hand
[54:05] as we go to him in prayer.
[54:09] Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[54:10] thank you for this another opportunity,
[54:12] Lord, to worship in your provided space,
[54:15] Lord, in the age in which we live.
[54:18] Father, we don't take it for granted or
[54:20] count it lightly. We know that you're
[54:23] here in our midst, Father. And this is
[54:25] another opportunity, Lord, to worship
[54:27] you
[54:28] &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Like never before,
[54:33] Lord Jesus. We've been given the whole
[54:36] entire book open to us. And if we would
[54:39] just be willing to allow you to reveal
[54:41] it to us, Father, it would become a new
[54:44] book to our lives. it would change our
[54:48] bodies from the inside out. And Father,
[54:52] this morning, one more time, we just
[54:54] invite you, Lord, to have the
[54:55] preeminence in the words that are
[54:57] spoken. Lord, we already know you're
[54:59] here according to your word because
[55:01] that's your will. And Father, we just
[55:04] esteem that greater than any thought or
[55:07] any tradition or any idea. We esteem
[55:10] your will greater than anything we could
[55:13] imagine. And Lord Jesus, we just accept
[55:16] it the way that you've given it to us.
[55:18] Lord,
[55:19] &gt;&gt; and Father, we pray that your will would
[55:21] be done even in this service this
[55:23] morning, Lord.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Father, that hearts would be changed.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, that we none of us, myself
[55:30] included, Lord, that we wouldn't leave
[55:32] this building the same way that we came
[55:34] in.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Father, that you would draw us closer
[55:37] unto you.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Father, our desire is to hear from you.
[55:41] And Lord, I pray that you would just
[55:43] help every one of us to get out of the
[55:45] way and just give you the preeminence,
[55:48] give you the leadership, give you the
[55:50] headship as our husband, Lord, as a
[55:52] husband desires.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; That when you speak, Father, we would
[55:57] hear it. Not just with our ears, but
[55:59] with our heart.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you and we thank you.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; We pray that you would meet each and
[56:06] every need, Lord, that was made known
[56:07] unto you today by the way of an uplift
[56:09] hand. Father, maybe some that weren't
[56:11] even mentioned, Father, that weren't
[56:14] even acknowledged. Lord, we pray that
[56:16] you would sovereignly meet the needs in
[56:18] the hearts of your children.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; We pray, Lord, that you would be with
[56:21] all those who are traveling, Lord Jesus.
[56:24] Some in Ireland, Father, some in
[56:26] Nigeria, Lord Jesus. Oh, maybe some
[56:29] locally around here, Father. Lord Jesus,
[56:32] we also want to remember the the
[56:34] persecution of your Christians, Lord
[56:36] Jesus, all around the world, Father, to
[56:39] think that, Lord, they're persecuted
[56:43] because of your name's sake. We know
[56:44] that that is what you said in your word.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; But, Father, to think that they are
[56:49] giving their lives even still today. We
[56:51] pray for those families. We pray for the
[56:53] congregations, Lord, that are enduring
[56:56] those dark trials. Father, we don't know
[56:59] what tomorrow holds, but we know that
[57:01] you have it in your complete control,
[57:03] Lord Jesus. And we trust you like that.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to remember each
[57:09] and every person here this morning,
[57:11] Father. Those that might be in person,
[57:14] maybe some are tuning in, Father, and
[57:16] maybe some would watch afterwards.
[57:18] Father,
[57:19] &gt;&gt; whatever your will is, Lord, we pray
[57:21] that you would sovereignly speak to our
[57:23] hearts today, Father.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we love you and we
[57:27] thank you. We just ask all these things
[57:30] in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you musicians.
[57:36] Thank you so much once again for putting
[57:39] your shoulders to the wheel.
[57:41] If you have your Bibles, I'd like to
[57:43] read from St. John chapter 4.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 4 today.
[57:50] We'll just start with uh
[57:54] start with the verse
[58:02] verse 21 of St. John chapter 4.
[58:14] Jesus saith unto her,"Woman,
[58:17] believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
[58:20] shall neither in this mountain, nor yet
[58:24] at Jerusalem worship the Father."
[58:28] Ye worship, ye know not what
[58:32] we wor, sorry, ye worship, ye know not
[58:36] what
[58:37] we know what we worship,
[58:40] &gt;&gt; for salvation is of the Jews.
[58:43] But the hour cometh, and now is, when
[58:46] the true worshippers shall worship the
[58:49] Father in spirit and in truth.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; For the Father seeketh such to worship
[58:56] him. And God is a spirit. And they that
[59:01] worship him must worship him in spirit
[59:06] and in truth.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] The woman saith unto him, I know that
[59:11] Messiah cometh, which is called Christ.
[59:15] When he has come, he will tell us all
[59:18] things.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto
[59:24] thee am he.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Turn over into the book of Revelations
[59:30] with me.
[59:32] Revelation chapter 10.
[59:43] What we would call a very familiar
[59:46] scripture
[59:48] I believe dovetales with what we just
[59:50] read. Revelations 10 verse 7.
[59:56] But in the days of the voice of the
[59:58] seventh angel,
[1:00:01] when he shall begin to sound,
[1:00:04] the mystery of God
[1:00:07] should be finished.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; As he hath declared to his servants, the
[1:00:14] prophets.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly
[1:00:18] Father, we're so thankful that the
[1:00:21] mystery
[1:00:22] about you is finished.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we know that it's just a
[1:00:28] gleaning time.
[1:00:30] Father, your prophet said that he
[1:00:32] doesn't see anything left for the
[1:00:34] gentile church except for the rapture
[1:00:37] back in 1965.
[1:00:40] And here we are, Lord Jesus, this many
[1:00:43] years down the road. We know that the
[1:00:46] days are coming very, very short. And
[1:00:49] that's why the devil is going about as a
[1:00:51] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.
[1:00:55] Oh Lord Jesus, beguiling
[1:00:57] silly women. Oh father, help us to just
[1:01:00] be obedient sons and daughters. Help us
[1:01:04] to take your word into our heart.
[1:01:06] Father, that Lord Jesus, we could hide
[1:01:08] it there that we might not sin against
[1:01:11] you.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; We just ask all these things in Jesus
[1:01:14] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You may be
[1:01:18] seated.
[1:01:21] Just uh want to announce brother Cadre
[1:01:24] Diggs will be here November the 22nd at
[1:01:26] 6 PM
[1:01:28] and uh November the 23rd at 10:00 a.m.
[1:01:33] And I would just like to kindly remind
[1:01:36] everyone if you don't mind just hit that
[1:01:38] mute button on your phone.
[1:01:40] Let's not have them ringing and
[1:01:43] distracting while we're in the presence
[1:01:45] of the King.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:49] It's easy to happen and uh to be honest,
[1:01:53] I've I've had it happen. So, just a
[1:01:55] friendly reminder. But the cadre digs
[1:01:57] will be here Saturday, November the 22nd
[1:01:59] at 6:00 p.m. and uh Sunday, November the
[1:02:03] 23rd at 10:00 a.m.
[1:02:05] And uh we've got the graduation
[1:02:07] celebration coming up. That's going to
[1:02:10] be in uh June, Saturday, June 27th,
[1:02:14] 2026. That'll be at 6 PM at the Glenmore
[1:02:17] Inn and uh we're starting to firm up
[1:02:19] details which is really nice. Uh we have
[1:02:22] the graduate dinners will be covered by
[1:02:24] the church. We're happy to do that in
[1:02:26] celebration of the graduates. And as
[1:02:29] we've mentioned in the past, we'll
[1:02:31] continue to mention it. It's for the
[1:02:33] people who have graduated high school
[1:02:35] and those people who have a post-secary
[1:02:37] degree or diploma that did not celebrate
[1:02:41] with the church. We certainly would like
[1:02:43] to uh appreciate you. So, um anyone else
[1:02:47] who would like to attend, it's looking
[1:02:49] like the tickets will likely be $30 each
[1:02:52] and we'll have a banquet. It'll be at
[1:02:54] the Glenmore Inn, Lord willing. Are you
[1:02:57] happy this morning?
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; We uh we have uh a pretty amazing time
[1:03:02] that we live in looking at what's going
[1:03:04] on in this world. And you know um just
[1:03:08] so you kind of know my direction today.
[1:03:10] I plan to get into some questions and
[1:03:12] answers. We had mentioned this in the
[1:03:15] past and uh it the offer is always open.
[1:03:18] If anybody has a question, there has to
[1:03:20] be an answer to the question and we
[1:03:23] certainly would like to to bring that
[1:03:26] opportunity to you. If you do have a
[1:03:28] question, if there's a spiritual
[1:03:30] question, there has to be a spiritual
[1:03:31] answer.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; That's that's the way we believe. That's
[1:03:34] what we believe. and we're certainly
[1:03:36] thankful for that. So, we have had uh
[1:03:38] probably six or seven questions come in
[1:03:41] and I don't want to just flippantly try
[1:03:43] and answer them. I want to meditate on
[1:03:46] them and think about them and see what
[1:03:48] the prophet said about them and see what
[1:03:50] the word says about them because if
[1:03:52] there is a scriptural question, there
[1:03:54] has to be a scriptural answer. So, we're
[1:03:55] talking about scriptural questions is
[1:03:57] what we want to answer this way. If if
[1:04:00] it's maybe just a church matter, uh we
[1:04:02] can have a conversation about it. if
[1:04:04] it's the functionality of the church,
[1:04:06] but if it's a scriptural question, by
[1:04:08] all means, we want to have uh uh uh just
[1:04:12] submit it. And I've had some come in the
[1:04:14] form of text messages, and some are
[1:04:16] written on the offering or not the
[1:04:18] offering, the prayer request um sheets.
[1:04:21] So, you could just drop those in the
[1:04:23] offering uh bag if you wanted to. But
[1:04:26] where there's a a question, there has to
[1:04:28] be an answer. And uh so, anyways, that's
[1:04:31] kind of where we're going to go today. I
[1:04:33] just want to uh I guess maybe start out
[1:04:36] with just making it perfectly clear.
[1:04:38] Really what we're after as the bride of
[1:04:40] Jesus Christ, as the the church in the
[1:04:43] day in which we live, is to understand
[1:04:45] that the mystery of God is finished
[1:04:49] according to Revelation chapter 10.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, when we have a
[1:04:53] mystery still around, when you hear
[1:04:56] people talking about mysterious things
[1:04:59] around this message, I want to say that
[1:05:02] the devil's not afraid to come to
[1:05:04] church. The devil is not afraid to
[1:05:06] actually come right inside the framework
[1:05:09] of the message because we know that
[1:05:12] brother Random said it very clearly that
[1:05:13] the the Antichrist spirit, what's the
[1:05:15] antichrist spirit?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; It's not just a human. It's the devil.
[1:05:20] Yes,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; just call it what it is. It's the devil.
[1:05:23] And that's the most religious spirit
[1:05:24] that there is. The Antichrist spirit is
[1:05:26] going to get in to the framework of the
[1:05:28] Christian church. And it's going to
[1:05:30] cause it to become lukewarm, formal, and
[1:05:32] powerless. And we read the church age
[1:05:34] book as a church. And if you have any
[1:05:36] questions about how that will happen,
[1:05:38] I'll tell you, we'll summarize it in a
[1:05:40] real easy format. It's going to happen.
[1:05:43] It is happening all around the world.
[1:05:45] Even while we speak right now, that's
[1:05:47] happening. The Antichrist spirit is
[1:05:49] creeping its way into the Christian
[1:05:51] church, causing it to become lukewarm,
[1:05:52] formal empowers. And the way it's doing
[1:05:54] it is through politics,
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; politics,
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; men in the church trying to dictate the
[1:06:03] way the church should be run.
[1:06:05] Maybe it's women in the church, and
[1:06:07] we're going to get into that in the
[1:06:08] future.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; The dominating female spirit, the
[1:06:13] Thotyan spirit is alive and well. That's
[1:06:16] the age we live in. And you know, many
[1:06:17] times that happens. And I I heard a
[1:06:19] brother preaching and I was just saying,
[1:06:21] "Amen. Lay it down, brother. Lay it
[1:06:23] down." Because, you know, it can it's
[1:06:25] not just women. It's a spirit.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; It's a dominating female spirit. Let's
[1:06:30] be real clear about that. The Thotyan
[1:06:32] spirit. The the Leodysian church age is
[1:06:35] a culmination of all of the ages, and
[1:06:38] that was one of the ages. But that
[1:06:40] dominating female spirit, it can be in
[1:06:43] women. Oh my. It can be in men.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; I feel like if I was Brother Codre, I'd
[1:06:49] be going like this. It could be in men.
[1:06:52] The dominating female spirit can be in
[1:06:54] men. It can be in organizations. And you
[1:06:57] know the worst thing, brothers and
[1:06:58] sisters, is if the dominating female
[1:07:01] spirit gets into a pastor, gets into a
[1:07:03] preacher. Because when that happens, I
[1:07:06] guarantee you that church will become
[1:07:08] lukewarm, formal, and powerless. either
[1:07:11] that or a pastor is going to have some
[1:07:13] big cleanup on aisle number one after
[1:07:17] that minister leaves, right? Because
[1:07:20] words travel, spirits travel in words.
[1:07:22] Sorry. That's how spirits travel in
[1:07:25] words. And if you wonder how that works,
[1:07:27] if you talk about the meal time
[1:07:28] conversations where maybe a husband and
[1:07:31] a wife will have a conversation and say
[1:07:32] that nobody, nobody from the church is
[1:07:34] here. We can just destroy
[1:07:38] that brother from the sound booth
[1:07:40] because he should have turned that song
[1:07:42] quicker. If I was in the sound booth, I
[1:07:45] would have done it whatever and go on
[1:07:48] and on and on. And maybe that brother, I
[1:07:50] tried to correct him and he just
[1:07:51] wouldn't listen to me. He's got a
[1:07:53] defiant spirit. Maybe he's got a a
[1:07:55] thotiry and dominating female spirit in
[1:07:57] him because he can't be corrected
[1:07:58] because true sons and daughters will
[1:08:00] always be corrected, right? The
[1:08:02] chastisement of the Lord.
[1:08:06] But you know what happens is now the
[1:08:09] husband and the wife are having that
[1:08:10] conversation and there's a spirit
[1:08:12] associated with that conversation. Don't
[1:08:14] think there isn't because there is. That
[1:08:16] spirit goes back and forth and
[1:08:17] unfortunately the little ears hear it.
[1:08:20] And the troubling part is now those ears
[1:08:23] are subject to that spirit because the
[1:08:25] parents are the Holy Ghost. They're the
[1:08:27] gatekeepers to the family. And when they
[1:08:29] allow those conversations to happen when
[1:08:32] no one else is listening,
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; it's not hurting anyone else. It's
[1:08:35] hurting their family.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; How is it hurting their family? Because
[1:08:39] now that child or wife or husband is
[1:08:42] going to have this opinion formed.
[1:08:45] They're going to have an opinion formed.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, if we have an
[1:08:49] opinion formed and it's outside of the
[1:08:51] word of God, it's a spirit.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Spirits love to just sit anchored as an
[1:08:57] opinion in our brains.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Love it.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Let it be the Holy Spirit, brothers and
[1:09:03] sisters,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; because that Holy Spirit is going to
[1:09:05] kick out any other spirit.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; And Lord, forgive us if we've ever had a
[1:09:09] conversation like that. I'm I'm so glad
[1:09:11] that I can say that. I'm not going to
[1:09:14] say it because I'd be lying if I said
[1:09:16] that. I wish I could say that. I've
[1:09:18] never had a conversation like that. I'm
[1:09:20] a human. And you know, there was a time
[1:09:23] in my life where I thought I was I was
[1:09:25] just smarter than every other human.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; And you know what? We all go through it.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And Lord willing, we'll all grow out of
[1:09:35] that and recognize that we're all
[1:09:37] sinners just saved by grace. And if we
[1:09:39] have a word of wisdom in our lives, it's
[1:09:42] only because he gave it to us.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; We're flesh and blood.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; We're bags of bones and skin. THERE'S
[1:09:50] NOTHING GOOD INSIDE OF US outside of
[1:09:52] him.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we get that air about
[1:09:56] ourselves. We're just smarter than
[1:09:58] everybody else.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; And you know what happens is people
[1:10:01] don't like hanging out with people like
[1:10:02] that.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; But you know, Brother Brandham says it
[1:10:05] that birds of a feather, they flock
[1:10:06] together. Many times you'll get the
[1:10:08] people that are just smarter than
[1:10:09] everyone else. They'll just hang
[1:10:10] together with everyone else. And
[1:10:12] sometimes you'll get the people that are
[1:10:14] the most religious ones, more religious
[1:10:16] than anyone else. They'll just be
[1:10:17] religious with everyone else. Who is
[1:10:19] like that, right? Birds of a feather
[1:10:21] flock together. But I want to encourage
[1:10:23] us, brothers and sisters. Let's just
[1:10:24] dress ourselves down, not in a perverted
[1:10:27] way, but in a Christian way, and allow
[1:10:29] the washing of the water of the word to
[1:10:31] come over our hearts and our minds
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; and our souls
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; so that the word can change us today.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; You know, this woman at the well,
[1:10:42] she was taught she she wasn't ignorant.
[1:10:45] She wasn't an ignorant woman. Let's go
[1:10:47] back to John St. John chapter 4.
[1:10:53] St. John chapter 4.
[1:10:58] We're going to get to questions and
[1:10:59] answers. Not just questions, but
[1:11:01] answers, too. We're going to get there.
[1:11:04] I just felt to
[1:11:06] get into this a little bit because this
[1:11:09] woman had a question, but I think it's
[1:11:12] awesome because she didn't really come
[1:11:13] out and ask it. She didn't seek Jesus,
[1:11:16] did she? And that's the way it is,
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Many times as believers, we don't seek
[1:11:21] the Lord. The Lord seeks us
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; and I apologize. Welcome back, brother
[1:11:27] Stephen and Sister Judith.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; We missed you. It's good to see you
[1:11:31] again. Hope you had a wonderful time.
[1:11:33] St. John chapter 4 verse 1.
[1:11:37] When therefore the Lord knew how the
[1:11:39] Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and
[1:11:42] baptized more disciples than John,
[1:11:45] though Jesus himself [snorts] baptized
[1:11:47] not, but his disciples. He left Judea
[1:11:50] and departed again into Galilee. Isn't
[1:11:52] that interesting that he would just put
[1:11:54] that in the scripture there because
[1:11:55] these Pharisees must have been just in a
[1:11:57] flat because now this is all getting out
[1:11:59] of hand. Everybody's got this new
[1:12:00] doctrine of water baptism. It's amazing
[1:12:03] to see it.
[1:12:06] Verse three says, "He left Judea and
[1:12:07] departed into Galilee and he must needs
[1:12:11] go through Samaria."
[1:12:13] You can imagine that his disciples were
[1:12:15] like, "Why do you want to go through
[1:12:17] Samaria? Why do you want to do that?
[1:12:20] Because it wasn't where they really
[1:12:21] wanted to be as Jews.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Verse five. Then cometh he to a city of
[1:12:28] Samaria which is called Saikar near the
[1:12:31] parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his
[1:12:34] son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there.
[1:12:38] Jesus therefore being wearied with his
[1:12:41] journey sat thus on the well and it was
[1:12:44] about the sixth hour.
[1:12:47] Isn't it beautiful to think that
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; he is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:12:51] forever.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; We all have our lives to live. We all
[1:12:55] have our regular duties that we have to
[1:12:57] do. We have all of the things that just
[1:13:00] need to be done. And in the midst of all
[1:13:03] of that, Jesus himself, he knows where
[1:13:07] his children are. He knows when his
[1:13:10] children need to be spoken to and he
[1:13:13] will come and put himself right in our
[1:13:16] path.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Himself right in our path.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Just like this woman.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Verse seven. No coincidence for those
[1:13:26] people who are into the sevens. There
[1:13:29] cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water.
[1:13:32] Jesus saith unto her, "Give me to
[1:13:35] drink." Yes.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; For his disciples were gone away unto
[1:13:39] the city to buy meat. Then saith the
[1:13:41] woman of Samaria unto him, How is it
[1:13:43] that thou being a Jew askest, drink of
[1:13:48] me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the
[1:13:52] Jews have no dealings with the
[1:13:54] Samaritans. No doubt they thought they
[1:13:57] were filthy people.
[1:13:59] Verse 10. Jesus answered and said unto
[1:14:02] her, If thou kneest the gift of God, and
[1:14:07] who it is that saith to thee, Give me to
[1:14:10] drink, thou would have wouldest have
[1:14:13] asked of him, and he would have given
[1:14:16] thee living water.
[1:14:19] And we know what's going on here. He's
[1:14:22] actually taking some time with her.
[1:14:24] Isn't it wonderful that he's that kind
[1:14:26] of a God? Yes,
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; he's willing to take his time with us.
[1:14:30] And sometimes it's in just a couple of
[1:14:33] words just like this. And sometimes it's
[1:14:36] in just a couple of services. And
[1:14:38] sometimes it's in just a couple of
[1:14:40] decades,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; But he always puts himself in front of
[1:14:45] us and makes sure that he is a gentleman
[1:14:48] to us.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; The woman saith unto him, "Sir,
[1:14:53] we know we've gone over this in the
[1:14:55] past. The natural circumstances now are
[1:14:57] just everywhere. They're just all
[1:14:59] natural circumstances. The woman saith
[1:15:01] unto him, "Sir, thou hast nothing to
[1:15:03] draw with, and the well is deep, from
[1:15:06] whence thou hast that living water.
[1:15:09] Art thou greater than our father Jacob,
[1:15:12] which gave us the well, and drank
[1:15:14] thereof himself, and his children, and
[1:15:17] his cattle?" So, she knew, right? She
[1:15:20] had been taught. She had religion.
[1:15:24] Jesus answered and said unto her,
[1:15:28] "Whosoever drinkketh of this water
[1:15:31] shall thirst again."
[1:15:34] He takes her right into the natural
[1:15:36] circumstances. I agree. We're living in
[1:15:38] a natural world. And that's why I came
[1:15:40] and planted myself right in front of you
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; because I understand your circumstances.
[1:15:45] I understand your need. There's nothing
[1:15:48] happening that I'm surprised by.
[1:15:50] Whosoever drinkkeeth of this water shall
[1:15:52] thirst again. Verse 14. But whosoever
[1:15:55] drinkketh of the water that I shall give
[1:15:58] him shall never thirst. But the water
[1:16:02] that I shall give him shall be in him a
[1:16:05] well of water springing up into
[1:16:08] everlasting life.
[1:16:11] The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me
[1:16:14] this water that I thirst not, neither
[1:16:16] come hither to draw. And we know at one
[1:16:20] time I believe I said that that that she
[1:16:22] said this in a sarcastic fashion. Sure,
[1:16:25] give me that water. I would love to have
[1:16:26] that water. Like who's got that water?
[1:16:29] Nobody in this world has that water.
[1:16:31] Without recognizing who she really was
[1:16:34] speaking to.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto her, "Go call thy
[1:16:38] husband." Now he's contacted her spirit,
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; and now he's going to speak to her
[1:16:45] spirit. He's going to speak to the
[1:16:46] innermost part of her being. And that is
[1:16:49] exactly the way Jesus is. That's exactly
[1:16:52] the way God is. That's exactly the way
[1:16:54] the Holy Ghost is. That's exactly why we
[1:16:56] come to church because he wants to
[1:16:58] contact us on a natural level. He wants
[1:17:01] us to open up our minds, our hearts, and
[1:17:04] our souls so that he can actually
[1:17:06] contact us and change us. But the
[1:17:10] beautiful part is I'm going to get to
[1:17:11] it. I always jump ahead like this is he
[1:17:13] doesn't force us.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; He doesn't correct us. He doesn't
[1:17:19] chastise us and shake us down. What he
[1:17:21] does is acts like a gentleman. And he
[1:17:25] loves us.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; He doesn't hurt us. He doesn't slap us
[1:17:29] around. He's not that kind of a husband.
[1:17:32] He's not berating.
[1:17:35] Jesus saith unto her, "Go call thy
[1:17:37] husband and come hither."
[1:17:40] The woman answered and said,"I have no
[1:17:42] husband."
[1:17:44] Can you imagine that? She's just being
[1:17:46] herself.
[1:17:48] I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her,
[1:17:51] "Thou hast well said, I have no
[1:17:53] husband."
[1:17:54] Discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:17:56] intents of the heart.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Thou hast well said, I have no husband.
[1:18:02] For thou hast had five husbands, and he
[1:18:06] whom thou hast is not thy husband,
[1:18:10] and that saidest thou truly,
[1:18:13] totally discerning her heart.
[1:18:16] But not so that he could beat her up,
[1:18:18] not so that he could condemn her, so
[1:18:21] that he could reveal who he was to her.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. I believe this is such
[1:18:29] an example of a true Christian's
[1:18:31] testimony. Someone who has really gone
[1:18:33] on to being positionally placed in the
[1:18:36] land, who has gone on to adoption. I
[1:18:38] know there's many people here that would
[1:18:40] say, "I'm an adopted son and daughter of
[1:18:41] God." Amen. But my life just doesn't
[1:18:44] quite line up. There's just a little bit
[1:18:45] of an inongruity there. We're going to
[1:18:47] get into that later. But you know,
[1:18:49] someone who is truly adopted, they
[1:18:51] actually live the life.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Period. You don't even have to ask them,
[1:18:56] "Are you a Christian?" They don't have
[1:18:58] to say, "I'm a Christian." They exude
[1:19:01] Christianity. And what is Christianity?
[1:19:04] It's not church membership. It's the
[1:19:05] literal life of Jesus Christ living out
[1:19:08] through his bride because she has
[1:19:10] accepted that word into her heart just
[1:19:12] like Mary did from the angel messenger.
[1:19:14] And we're no different in the day in
[1:19:16] which we live, brothers and sisters.
[1:19:17] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:19:18] forever. He has a program and he always
[1:19:20] conducts himself exactly according to
[1:19:22] the program. When we hear that word from
[1:19:24] a vindicated prophet in the day in which
[1:19:26] we live, he is the messenger to this
[1:19:28] age. When we take that word and say amen
[1:19:31] to that word, it causes a life to come
[1:19:34] forward inside of us. Just like Mary had
[1:19:36] a womb and naturally gave birth, we know
[1:19:39] that brother Brandham, he said it that
[1:19:40] the natural type's the spiritual, that
[1:19:42] natural birth of Jesus Christ is the
[1:19:44] spiritual birth of the bride of Jesus
[1:19:46] Christ.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing, but it's just a
[1:19:49] spiritual birth that happens. Now, I say
[1:19:51] just a spiritual birth. There's nothing
[1:19:54] greater on earth that could take place,
[1:19:55] brothers and sisters. Many people would
[1:19:56] say, "Well, the literal life of Jesus,
[1:19:58] Christ on earth was good." But what
[1:20:00] about now? That was 2,000 years ago, but
[1:20:02] what about now? What about now being the
[1:20:04] literal life of Jesus Christ happening
[1:20:06] to people? And that's literally what's
[1:20:08] happening in this world. And we know,
[1:20:10] Brother Brandham said it under the
[1:20:12] uncction of the Holy Ghost. When the
[1:20:14] church recognizes what it is, what is
[1:20:16] it? What's the church? What's the true
[1:20:18] church of the living God? What is going
[1:20:21] to cause the rapture to go forward? It's
[1:20:24] not going to be because I'm a good
[1:20:26] person. It's not going to be because I
[1:20:29] pay so many tithes. Oh, and I've got so
[1:20:32] much offering and I come and do all
[1:20:34] these things for the church. It's not
[1:20:36] going to be any of that.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; It's going to be because the death
[1:20:40] angels flying over the land looking for
[1:20:42] the token.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Who's got the token? Only the adopted
[1:20:45] sons and daughters are going to have the
[1:20:47] token. And many many people will claim
[1:20:50] to have the token but very few will have
[1:20:53] it.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; But here in the story the woman said
[1:20:56] saith unto him this is verse 19. Sir I
[1:21:01] perceive I I can see something is
[1:21:04] different. Not with my eyes but with my
[1:21:07] ears and not with my eyes and my ears
[1:21:08] but with my heart. I perceive that thou
[1:21:12] art a prophet.
[1:21:15] Our fathers worshiped in this mountain,
[1:21:18] and ye say that in Jerusalem is the
[1:21:21] place where men ought to worship.
[1:21:25] Jesus saith unto her,"Woman,
[1:21:28] believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
[1:21:32] shall neither worship in this mountain,
[1:21:34] nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
[1:21:37] Father.
[1:21:39] ye worship ye know not what
[1:21:42] we know what we worship for salvation is
[1:21:45] of the Jews
[1:21:48] and we know that he met another woman I
[1:21:49] thought it was so good the other woman
[1:21:53] she came behind him and she just wanted
[1:21:56] something from him and what did she want
[1:21:58] she wanted the healing of her daughter
[1:22:00] and he said you know what it's not meat
[1:22:01] for me to cast the children's bread to
[1:22:03] dogs how many of us could tolerate
[1:22:05] something like that if we got into
[1:22:08] church And we heard Jesus say that to
[1:22:10] us. If a pastor said something, if a
[1:22:12] preacher said something that maybe just
[1:22:14] didn't tickle our ears the right way, oh
[1:22:16] my, we might just get offended and run
[1:22:18] away and go and find another church that
[1:22:19] would just tickle our ears.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; But here we got a a a messiah that would
[1:22:24] call a woman a dog.
[1:22:27] And she said, "Yay, Lord.
[1:22:30] Even the dogs, they get to eat the
[1:22:32] crumbs that fall from the master's
[1:22:35] table." Amen.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; A true son and daughter of God, they're
[1:22:39] not going to get offended.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; It just it shocks me when you start to
[1:22:44] hear how many people they're offended.
[1:22:46] So many people get offended. They're
[1:22:47] offended. You know what the word says
[1:22:49] that offenses must come.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; That's a scripture. So I I I say maybe
[1:22:54] we ought to get over it and be rugged
[1:22:56] sons and daughters of God, not house
[1:22:58] flowers,
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; right? something that's maybe what we
[1:23:02] would call a native plant. When when all
[1:23:04] of the bugs and the temperatures and
[1:23:06] everything would happen around us, the
[1:23:08] environment would get rough,
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; we still flourish.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; And you know what's beautiful, brothers
[1:23:13] and sisters? We might have a smaller
[1:23:15] flower, but it's more beautiful.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; We might have a smaller fruit, but it's
[1:23:20] sweeter.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; If you look at the hot house flowers and
[1:23:24] and fruits, great fruits, but not nearly
[1:23:27] as sweet as something that's grown
[1:23:29] naturally.
[1:23:31] But this woman here, let's go back to
[1:23:32] our scripture. Verse 22. Ye worship, ye
[1:23:35] know not what. We know what we worship.
[1:23:38] For salvation is of the Jews. And we
[1:23:40] know that Jesus was identifying himself
[1:23:42] as a Jew in that moment. We know that he
[1:23:45] was neither Jew or Gentile. To be clear,
[1:23:49] verse 23 says, "But the hour cometh, and
[1:23:51] now is."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; How could it be now then? Because God
[1:23:57] was manifest in flesh. Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; When the true worshippers shall worship
[1:24:02] the Father in spirit and in truth. For
[1:24:06] the Father seeketh such to worship him,
[1:24:08] and God is his spirit, and they that
[1:24:10] worship him must worship him in spirit
[1:24:13] and in truth. Do you ever think about
[1:24:15] that verse 24
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; of St. John chapter 4? Just a
[1:24:20] conversation happening between Jesus,
[1:24:22] the Messiah, and and the woman at the
[1:24:25] well. Just that happening. and and and
[1:24:27] sometimes it can actually be that way.
[1:24:29] But I think let's let's maybe zoom in a
[1:24:31] little bit and and talk about it in the
[1:24:33] way that, you know, it's not just about
[1:24:35] them. Let's let's take that and make it
[1:24:36] right personal and make it about us. We
[1:24:39] need to recognize that the only way
[1:24:42] we're going to worship him is in spirit
[1:24:44] and in truth. Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it very clearly.
[1:24:48] Just like all the people are reveling in
[1:24:50] in in World Series game seven,
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; six, whatever the World Series game is
[1:24:57] into overtime innings. Everybody
[1:25:01] was sitting there just saying, "Yeah,
[1:25:03] good. Go team. Someone's gonna win."
[1:25:05] Yeah.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Those people were
[1:25:10] probably screaming. Many people probably
[1:25:11] don't even have a voice today because
[1:25:13] they wanted their team to win so bad.
[1:25:15] Brother Bradom said it very clearly that
[1:25:17] we ought to get in the spirit just as
[1:25:19] much as they do.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; In fact, the Christian ought to be just
[1:25:24] as exuberant
[1:25:27] and
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; more
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; is what he said.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Don't be bashful. This is the house of
[1:25:32] the Lord. This is the place where we can
[1:25:34] let our hair down. We can let the
[1:25:35] pressure off. We can take our coats off.
[1:25:37] We can roll up our sleeves. WE CAN JUST
[1:25:39] BE OURSELVES. AMEN.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; We've come to worship. Did you come to
[1:25:42] WORSHIP TODAY? IF WE'VE COME TO WORSHIP,
[1:25:44] WE'VE COME TO worship in spirit and in
[1:25:46] truth.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't come to worship in
[1:25:49] spirit and in truth, guess what? You are
[1:25:52] not worshiping the way that he wants to
[1:25:54] be worshiped.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; But you know,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; the only way that we can do that is to
[1:26:00] have faith.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; And faith cometh by hearing.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Hearing of the word of God.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know, brothers and
[1:26:07] sisters, it's impossible to please him
[1:26:09] without faith.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Verse 25 says, "The woman saith unto
[1:26:13] him, I know that Messiah has cometh,
[1:26:15] which is called Christ,
[1:26:19] when he has come, when he has come, he
[1:26:21] will tell us all things."
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; And Jesus saith unto her, I that speak
[1:26:25] unto thee am he.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; And we know the rest of the story. I'm
[1:26:29] not going to go through the rest of it.
[1:26:31] I just wanted to get to that place there
[1:26:34] by reading the rest of it from verse one
[1:26:37] onwards just just to show that when when
[1:26:40] we have a question in our heart, this
[1:26:41] woman had a question in her heart. And
[1:26:44] God knew it. God knew that she would
[1:26:46] have that question in her heart that day
[1:26:49] before the foundation of the world. He
[1:26:51] knew that she would be there. He knew
[1:26:54] they would have that conversation. He
[1:26:56] knew all about it. But he also knew what
[1:26:59] she would choose. And that's what the
[1:27:02] difference between election is. Election
[1:27:04] and unelection. The people that aren't
[1:27:06] elected,
[1:27:08] he knows what choice they'll make, but
[1:27:10] he doesn't make their choice for them.
[1:27:13] And the people who are elected, he knows
[1:27:15] what choice they'll make, but he doesn't
[1:27:17] make the choice for them. He's God. He's
[1:27:19] sovereign. And what he does is allows us
[1:27:22] to be free moral agents. Now, I could
[1:27:24] bring out a quote for that, and I'm not
[1:27:26] going to do it. That's just uh for free,
[1:27:28] a sidebar. That's just the anointing of
[1:27:30] the Holy Ghost. And I think it's
[1:27:32] beautiful when that happens because he
[1:27:34] wants us to know these things. Brothers
[1:27:36] and sisters, there's no more mystery
[1:27:37] with this message of the hour. There's
[1:27:39] no more mystery with the word of God.
[1:27:41] You know, if there is, then it's just
[1:27:44] because maybe we're ignorant. Not in a
[1:27:46] bad way. We just don't know. We're not
[1:27:47] aware. He hasn't revealed it to us. And
[1:27:50] all we have to do is ask him, just
[1:27:51] reveal it to me. Because, you know, if
[1:27:53] we turn back over to Revelation, let's
[1:27:55] do that. Let's turn over to Revelation
[1:27:56] chapter 4.
[1:27:58] Let's let's go over to Revelation
[1:28:00] chapter 4. We celebrate Revelation
[1:28:02] chapter 10.
[1:28:06] Excuse me. I hope I got that mic off for
[1:28:09] that. That's terrible if I sneezed in
[1:28:11] your ear like that. Oh, [snorts]
[1:28:14] Revelation chapter 4. When we read
[1:28:18] Revelation chapter 10, to know that that
[1:28:20] mystery is is is revealed,
[1:28:24] let's take a look at the way it actually
[1:28:26] unfolded.
[1:28:28] We know that the church ages were laid
[1:28:30] out in Revelations chapter 2 and chapter
[1:28:32] 3. The last church age being the
[1:28:35] Leodysian church. But in chapter 4, John
[1:28:40] after this I looked and behold a door
[1:28:42] was open in heaven. The first voice
[1:28:45] which I heard was as it were of a
[1:28:47] trumpet talking with me, which said,
[1:28:49] "Come up hither, and I will show thee
[1:28:52] things which much must be hereafter." So
[1:28:56] there was the invitation to John and
[1:28:59] verse two says it immediately I was in
[1:29:03] the spirit.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; If we try and understand these things
[1:29:07] outside of the spirit, we're not going
[1:29:09] to understand them. It is going to be
[1:29:12] mysterious. It will be mysterious. There
[1:29:15] will still be mysteries outside of the
[1:29:17] spirit because we know that we could
[1:29:19] talk about the the the scroll the
[1:29:21] scrolls the seals. When when the seals
[1:29:24] are open, there was a seal on on the
[1:29:27] back side and on the front and the seal
[1:29:31] on the inside was written, but there was
[1:29:33] a seal on the backside that wasn't
[1:29:35] written. The written word that we have
[1:29:38] is the seal that was written. And the
[1:29:41] seal that wasn't written, no, I'm not
[1:29:43] taking and making a a a 14 seals
[1:29:46] doctrine, just for the record. We're not
[1:29:47] going there. Not doing that. Some people
[1:29:49] have and and we know it happens. But the
[1:29:53] seal on the back side, brothers and
[1:29:55] sisters, is the revelation of the seal
[1:29:57] on the front side.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of that word that's
[1:30:01] been given to us freely. We know that
[1:30:03] John once he was in the spirit. What did
[1:30:06] he see? He saw in verse chapter 5 verse
[1:30:09] one says, "And I saw in the right hand
[1:30:11] of him that sat on the throne a book
[1:30:13] written within and on the backside
[1:30:16] sealed with seven seals." Amen.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; And we know the story full well. If you
[1:30:20] don't, I would say go read it. I'm just
[1:30:22] going to talk a little bit about it. We
[1:30:24] know that he heard the voice in heaven
[1:30:26] say, "Who is worthy to go and take the
[1:30:27] book out of him that sits on the
[1:30:29] throne?" And nobody was worthy found in
[1:30:31] heaven, under heaven, in the earth,
[1:30:33] under the earth. Nobody was worthy. And
[1:30:35] John, being a type of the bride, wept
[1:30:37] much because he recognized that his name
[1:30:39] was in that book. That was the book of
[1:30:40] redemption.
[1:30:44] But we know that he heard that voice say
[1:30:46] to him, "John, weep not. The lion of the
[1:30:50] tribe of Judah hath prevailed."
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; He's worthy
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; to take the book
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; and to loose the seals thereof.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; So when we read Revelations chapter 10,
[1:31:06] we can read verse one. And I saw another
[1:31:09] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:31:11] clothed in a cloud.
[1:31:14] I think it's so beautiful. In like
[1:31:17] manner as you see him go is what the
[1:31:19] disciples saw when Jesus was received up
[1:31:22] to heaven in a cloud.
[1:31:26] In like manner as you see him go.
[1:31:29] I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:31:32] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:31:36] rainbow was upon his head. And I
[1:31:39] probably didn't read that in Revelation
[1:31:41] in the beginning of Revelation. The one
[1:31:43] that was sitting on the throne, he had a
[1:31:45] rainbow round about. We know that.
[1:31:49] And his feet his face as was as it were
[1:31:53] the sun and his feet as pillars of fire.
[1:31:56] And he had in his hand a little book
[1:31:59] open.
[1:32:01] [clears throat]
[1:32:02] So when we read this word of God, when
[1:32:05] we read this message of the hour,
[1:32:07] brothers and sisters, the book is open.
[1:32:10] All seven seals are open.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet says it. All seven seals are
[1:32:15] open. Some people want to take and
[1:32:17] double down on certain quotes and say
[1:32:19] that there's really only six seals open.
[1:32:21] In the seventh seal, he says he has to
[1:32:23] stop. And sure enough, he does has to
[1:32:25] stop in in in 1963 in in the preaching
[1:32:28] of that and he even goes into a hotel
[1:32:30] room and does an altered version, an
[1:32:32] edit to that tape, the last 20 minutes
[1:32:35] of the seventh seal. If you ever listen
[1:32:36] to it, you'll hear that there's an
[1:32:38] amendment to it. It wasn't the time.
[1:32:40] Brother Brandham felt really checked
[1:32:41] about it in his life. But if you just
[1:32:43] stop there, you're going to say, "Sure
[1:32:45] enough, all six seals are open." But
[1:32:46] that seventh one, he stopped. He didn't
[1:32:48] open it. And sure enough, he didn't.
[1:32:51] according to the word of God, according
[1:32:53] to what was recorded. But if you go from
[1:32:55] 1963 onwards, 1964, especially in 1964,
[1:33:01] 1965, 1964,
[1:33:04] what happens is he just shows the
[1:33:06] discernment.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; God standing there discerning the hearts
[1:33:10] of the people.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Who can actually do that? Nobody could
[1:33:14] do that but God.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Over and over and over and over without
[1:33:18] one time missing. We get a lot of people
[1:33:21] in the day in which we live which maybe
[1:33:23] have prophetic gifts and prophetic
[1:33:25] insight and maybe some of the gifts in
[1:33:27] the spirit like we were talking about
[1:33:28] and they're able to say things about
[1:33:30] people and say things and discern things
[1:33:32] and bring things. Maybe they have dreams
[1:33:34] and and and visions even they could have
[1:33:37] them because that's what the word of God
[1:33:39] says, right? We're not ignorant of that.
[1:33:43] But if they miss one time,
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; it's wrong.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; The word of God says to not hear them.
[1:33:50] Unfortunately, that's what it says.
[1:33:53] I just want to say today, the revelation
[1:33:56] of God is no longer a mystery.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Who God is and where he is at is no
[1:34:02] longer a mystery. And if it is, it still
[1:34:04] needs to be revealed to you. Just ask
[1:34:06] him and see if he won't reveal it. See
[1:34:09] if he won't show us exactly who we are
[1:34:13] and what we're raised up for. Because
[1:34:14] you know, Revelations 10:1-7 is kind of
[1:34:17] like the buzz message scripture.
[1:34:21] Revelations 10:7 in the days of the
[1:34:24] voice. We we know that it's in in in
[1:34:27] excuse me, even in in Jeffersonville, so
[1:34:29] much is in and around Revelation 10. And
[1:34:32] we know it's the identification of
[1:34:35] Malachi 4 5 and 6. We know that it's
[1:34:37] actually all one and the same. We're not
[1:34:40] going to confuse them. And and I'm not
[1:34:43] going to try and belittle it either. I
[1:34:44] want to just point out that there's no
[1:34:46] longer any mystery. And if we take it a
[1:34:48] little bit further, it doesn't stop at
[1:34:50] verse seven. It's most important for the
[1:34:53] day in which we live, brothers and
[1:34:54] sisters, as adopted sons and daughters
[1:34:56] of God, which is what I believe we all
[1:34:58] want to be.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I I trust that we can all say that we
[1:35:03] are. And if not, let's ask the Lord to
[1:35:06] show us.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; But there's a little bit of work for us
[1:35:10] to do. Verse eight.
[1:35:12] And the voice, this is out of Revelation
[1:35:14] 10:8.
[1:35:16] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:35:18] spake unto me again, John being a type
[1:35:20] of the bride, remember this, and said,
[1:35:22] "Go and take the little book which is
[1:35:24] open in the hand of the angel which
[1:35:26] standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:35:29] earth. Go and get that little book. Go
[1:35:31] take it out of his hand." So the book
[1:35:33] was in the hand of him that was on the
[1:35:34] throne. Then it was in the hand of the
[1:35:36] lamb. Then it was in the hand of that
[1:35:38] mighty angel that came down from heaven.
[1:35:40] Now it's going from the hand of that
[1:35:42] mighty angel right into the hand of man.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Take that book. Go and get that book
[1:35:48] yourself. Go take the little book which
[1:35:51] is open, not closed, in the hand of the
[1:35:54] angel which standeth upon this upon the
[1:35:57] sea and upon the earth. And we know the
[1:35:58] sea is the people. The earth is actually
[1:36:00] the world. And I went unto the angel and
[1:36:04] said unto him, give me the little book.
[1:36:06] How many people have done that today?
[1:36:09] Amen.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Gone to that angel and said, "Give to me
[1:36:12] that little book that's open. REVEAL TO
[1:36:14] ME IN MY HEART THIS mystery that I keep
[1:36:17] hearing about."
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Take it and eat it up.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:36:29] Verse nine says, "And I went unto the
[1:36:31] angel and said unto him, Give me the
[1:36:33] little book." And he said unto me, Take
[1:36:35] it and eat it up, and it shall make thy
[1:36:38] belly bitter,
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:36:42] honey. And I took the little book out of
[1:36:43] the angel's hand and ate it up. And it
[1:36:46] was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as
[1:36:49] soon as I had eaten it, my belly was
[1:36:51] bitter. We We know this scripture very
[1:36:54] well. Perhaps there's somebody here
[1:36:56] today that doesn't really understand it.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; It's going to increase our spirit.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Actually, our spirit's going to decrease
[1:37:03] and his spirit will increase in our life
[1:37:04] when we eat this book. But if we don't
[1:37:07] eat this book, it's not going to change
[1:37:08] our bodies.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Now, you don't have to be a scholar of
[1:37:13] the word of God. You don't have to
[1:37:14] memorize all the scripture. Just take it
[1:37:16] and eat it. It didn't say take the book
[1:37:18] and memorize it, John. It said take the
[1:37:20] book and eat it up.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; That's all we need to do. I heard an
[1:37:25] elder minister, someone asking him
[1:37:27] saying, you know, what would what would
[1:37:28] be your advice for uh young ministers in
[1:37:32] the church today? What would be your
[1:37:35] advice? And and he said two things. This
[1:37:37] is an elder minister, someone that's
[1:37:39] been around and seen it all. And what
[1:37:41] did he say? He said two things. One of
[1:37:43] them, know your Bible. And the other
[1:37:45] one, pray.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; And the rest of it will all fall in
[1:37:49] line.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you don't pray and you
[1:37:52] don't read your Bible, how can you
[1:37:54] preach?
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; How can you actually go and do what the
[1:37:58] word says in verse 10? And I took the
[1:38:00] little book out of the angel's hand. I
[1:38:02] ate it up. It was in my mouth sweet as
[1:38:04] honey. And as soon as I had eaten it up,
[1:38:05] it made my belly bitter. And he said
[1:38:07] unto me, thou must prophesy again before
[1:38:10] many peoples, nations, tongues, and
[1:38:11] kings.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And we know that word prophesy is the
[1:38:15] same as preach. We have to be able to
[1:38:17] preach. My
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; I just love the word of God. Don't you?
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, man.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Aside from the scripture, I haven't even
[1:38:25] touched the notes today.
[1:38:29] This woman, she had religion, didn't
[1:38:31] she? And she believed something, which I
[1:38:35] think is so beautiful. As I was studying
[1:38:36] this, it came to me. She believed
[1:38:38] something that she didn't even know.
[1:38:42] And I just think that's exactly the life
[1:38:44] of a Christian. There's something in our
[1:38:46] heart that we believe. We just don't
[1:38:48] even know it,
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; There's a hunger and a thirst for
[1:38:51] something. There's a hunger and thirst
[1:38:53] for more, but we just don't even know
[1:38:54] what it is. But there comes a day where
[1:38:57] we actually get to meet him face to face
[1:38:58] when we have that hunger. He will never
[1:39:00] ever leave us or forsake us.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; She did not know what it was that she
[1:39:06] was believing in. Because Jesus even
[1:39:08] said to them, you're worshiping in in in
[1:39:11] in a way that you don't even know. You
[1:39:14] don't even know what you're worshiping.
[1:39:17] Is it warm in here?
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; It feels really warm in here. When that
[1:39:22] happens, I have to wonder. I'm just
[1:39:24] going to be honest with you. I wonder if
[1:39:25] I'm actually going off and and there's
[1:39:28] sort of a spiritual battle going on or
[1:39:30] if maybe it is really warm in here. And
[1:39:33] I I just don't know. Uh sometimes I
[1:39:36] heard brother Toby say it. Sometimes we
[1:39:38] just need to jump up and shout
[1:39:39] hallelujah.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; If we're starting to get sleepy,
[1:39:43] brothers and sisters, let's just praise
[1:39:44] the Lord for a minute. Let's not
[1:39:46] tolerate it. The devil wants us to go to
[1:39:48] sleep. [applause]
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; If we have to, we can turn the fans on
[1:39:55] and open the door.
[1:39:57] I'm not throwing off on anyone. I just
[1:40:00] feel like it's hot in here. You know,
[1:40:02] I'm serious about that. But I know what
[1:40:04] it's like to work and I know what it's
[1:40:05] like to work hard and I know what it's
[1:40:07] like to come to church and to be tired.
[1:40:10] When you've worked all week long and you
[1:40:12] come and you sit down and you start to
[1:40:13] get in the presence of the Lord and that
[1:40:16] washing of the water of the word starts
[1:40:17] to happen, it can become very soothing.
[1:40:20] When you come into a place like this,
[1:40:22] which is a place of rest,
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; You come out of the world of of darkness
[1:40:28] and you get into a place like this. This
[1:40:30] is the place that we desire to be.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily the devil that's
[1:40:35] trying to make us go to sleep.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's just natural
[1:40:39] circumstances. It's just warm in here.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; But praise the Lord, we're here.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; This woman, she didn't even know what
[1:40:48] she believed.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; But she believed.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; I think it's such a beautiful thing
[1:40:53] because it's really a type of a believer
[1:40:55] in the day in which we live.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; But like I said, there came a day where
[1:40:59] she came face to face. And that thing
[1:41:02] that she believed revealed itself
[1:41:05] himself directly to her.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; And he is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:41:10] forever. And he wants to reveal himself
[1:41:12] today
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; in the fullness of this revelation and
[1:41:15] the fullness of this mystery causing it
[1:41:18] to no longer be mysterious.
[1:41:22] But I think it's so beautiful. Don't
[1:41:23] you? Jesus didn't scold her.
[1:41:26] He never once scolded her, did he?
[1:41:29] He didn't tell her, "You're a filthy
[1:41:31] sinner.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; You've had five husbands and the one
[1:41:35] that you're with isn't yours either.
[1:41:37] You're a whore."
[1:41:39] He never said that, did he? But you
[1:41:42] know, many times Christian people can
[1:41:45] start to get a little bit of an air
[1:41:47] about themselves and say, "Look at that
[1:41:49] woman. She's ill- famed."
[1:41:52] I say, "Lord, help us."
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? Spiritually
[1:41:58] speaking, invisible union of the BRIDE
[1:41:59] OF JESUS CHRIST. ANYBODY THAT'S GOT ANY
[1:42:02] OTHER thought or any other worldly
[1:42:03] attraction besides the word of God, they
[1:42:06] shall be called an adulteress according
[1:42:09] to the word of God.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we'll just take that and put
[1:42:13] it off naturally and say, "Well, you
[1:42:14] know what? If a a woman has a living
[1:42:16] husband and she gets married again, then
[1:42:17] she shall be called an adulteress."
[1:42:19] That's not what the invisible union of
[1:42:20] the bride is talking about, brothers and
[1:42:22] sisters. He's talking about a spiritual
[1:42:24] union of the bride on earth with the
[1:42:26] heavenly bridegroom.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; And what happens? There's a new birth.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about that very
[1:42:34] clearly in the invisible union of the
[1:42:36] bride of Jesus Christ. But we can begin
[1:42:37] to get a little bit of an air in our
[1:42:38] lives if we're not careful. And if we do
[1:42:40] get that air in our lives, it's not his
[1:42:42] spirit. I'll tell you, we're not adopted
[1:42:45] yet. That's
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Because there is a crossing over. I keep
[1:42:49] going back to it. I can't get away from
[1:42:51] adoption. I was talking to the deacons
[1:42:53] about it. It's just so beautiful. I I
[1:42:54] can't get away from adoption, brothers
[1:42:56] and sisters. I believe full well that's
[1:42:58] the age in which we live. The mysteries
[1:43:00] have been revealed. The seals have been
[1:43:02] open. We know all of those things and
[1:43:04] and all the signs and wonders have
[1:43:06] happened in the message and around the
[1:43:08] world. Seven times it's happened. We've
[1:43:10] got all the books and tapes. We've got
[1:43:12] all THE APPS. BUT DO WE HAVE THE LIFE?
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what's happening now. We're
[1:43:18] talking about adoption being
[1:43:19] positionally placed in the land. And if
[1:43:21] you listen to what Brother Brandham says
[1:43:22] in adoption, he says, "We're talking to
[1:43:24] mature Christians now.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; We're not talking to babies anymore.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; We're talking TO MATURE SONS AND
[1:43:31] DAUGHTERS that need to be positionally
[1:43:33] placed into their inheritance."
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; And boy, I got a quote that's a zinger
[1:43:38] today. I'm going to bring it later.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; But you know, we're talking about
[1:43:41] questions and answers.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; But the questions and answers are what's
[1:43:46] going to take us and positionally place
[1:43:47] us.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we can get a spiritual
[1:43:50] question in our life, we can have a
[1:43:51] spiritual answer. Don't think for a
[1:43:53] second that God wants to leave us or
[1:43:55] forsake us. That he just won't tell us
[1:43:57] when we have a question in our hearts.
[1:44:00] There comes a day where we will be face
[1:44:01] to face with the question that we have
[1:44:04] in our hearts. So I want to say what's
[1:44:06] what's the question that we have in our
[1:44:08] hearts? Because if we have a question,
[1:44:10] he's got an answer and he'll give it to
[1:44:12] us. But Jesus didn't scold this woman,
[1:44:16] this ill-famed woman. She was an
[1:44:17] ill-famed woman. So the prophet called
[1:44:19] her. What did he do? He contacted her
[1:44:21] spirit.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; To contact people's spirit. To take the
[1:44:26] time to talk to people. Many times I
[1:44:29] want to just scoot past people holding
[1:44:31] those signs. You know the ones on the
[1:44:33] side of the road. Those ones, some of
[1:44:35] them are needy and some of them aren't.
[1:44:37] Some of them are just pretending. But
[1:44:39] you know, they're out there and they're
[1:44:40] doing that. And you can tell some of
[1:44:41] them are really rough individuals. Do we
[1:44:44] look them in the eye and and pray for
[1:44:46] them or do we just look the other way
[1:44:48] and hope that quickly that light changes
[1:44:50] so we don't have to contend with them?
[1:44:51] Those are the people that need it.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Preaching to myself here now. [laughter]
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; That wasn't for you. That was for me.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; But you know what Jesus did? He
[1:45:01] contacted her spirit.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell her she was ill famed to
[1:45:06] get away from me, you Samaritan. It's
[1:45:08] not meat for us to to throw the
[1:45:10] children's bread to dogs. No, he never
[1:45:13] said that.
[1:45:15] This woman, she had this question in her
[1:45:17] heart. And you know, let's just bring it
[1:45:19] forward now. From then to now, we'll say
[1:45:22] now, "Brother Brown, I'm a 1960 uh 53,
[1:45:25] sorry, 1953. Questions and answers. If
[1:45:28] you type in now, if anyone's got
[1:45:31] questions and I'll let you bring it up.
[1:45:33] I didn't send it to the boys this
[1:45:34] morning. I apologize. It's not on them.
[1:45:37] It's on me." So, when you have the
[1:45:38] conversations about the sound booth,
[1:45:39] it's it's it's right here.
[1:45:44] But don't say anything too bad about the
[1:45:45] pastor.
[1:45:48] Questions and answers in 1953. Now, if
[1:45:51] anyone's got any questions that they
[1:45:54] want to hand in, why just push them
[1:45:56] right on up? Let some child bring them
[1:45:59] or whatever you want to do. Why would he
[1:46:01] say that? Just so they would be
[1:46:02] anonymous, right? Cuz you don't want to
[1:46:05] actually single people out and and say,
[1:46:08] you know, you don't want that. He says,
[1:46:10] just push them right on up. let some
[1:46:11] child bring them or whatever you want to
[1:46:12] do. Or maybe if we get through I I got
[1:46:14] about six here on one page and then over
[1:46:17] here then we got two over there. Now we
[1:46:20] want to find out. The reason we do this
[1:46:23] is to find out what's on the people's
[1:46:26] mind.
[1:46:28] We want to contact your spirit. I want
[1:46:30] to contact your spirit. Now, brother
[1:46:32] Brandon wanted to contact people's
[1:46:34] spirits. Tell us what's on your mind.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; We want to be able to help. tell us
[1:46:40] what's on the people's mind, what
[1:46:42] they're thinking about. See, and that's
[1:46:44] what makes a good, strong church. So,
[1:46:47] this is where my ears perk up because I
[1:46:50] want to see a good, strong church. I
[1:46:52] want to see a good praying church. I
[1:46:54] want to see a body of believers that are
[1:46:56] strong in the faith, a good, strong
[1:46:58] church. He says, you've got to have the
[1:47:00] times just like you got to comb the
[1:47:03] cuckle out. Did you ever get a cucklebur
[1:47:06] in your jacket or on on your hair even?
[1:47:10] You ever get those little burrs?
[1:47:11] Sometimes you just have to walk through
[1:47:13] something and then you've got like a
[1:47:15] hundred burrs down your legs. Sometimes
[1:47:17] you got to just comb them out. Sometimes
[1:47:19] we just walk through some traditions.
[1:47:21] Sometimes we have some ideas that are
[1:47:23] planted in our lives and you know,
[1:47:25] brother Bradom talks about it here. You
[1:47:27] just need to comb them out. That's all.
[1:47:30] We just need to comb out the cuckle
[1:47:32] birds, you know, and and everything and
[1:47:34] get all the things out of the way so
[1:47:36] that you can move steadily. Because
[1:47:38] remember, brothers and sisters, we're
[1:47:40] talking about adoption.
[1:47:42] That is my theme, I think, in terms of
[1:47:44] ministry. I can't get away from it. I
[1:47:46] know we're in a one room schoolhouse.
[1:47:48] Some people don't even have uh have
[1:47:50] never taken water baptism in the name of
[1:47:52] Jesus Christ. Some people have done that
[1:47:54] and they've never actually been able to
[1:47:57] identify that they truly have the
[1:47:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost in their life.
[1:48:01] That's that's the reality of where we're
[1:48:03] at. I understand that fully.
[1:48:06] But we're not actually preaching and
[1:48:08] stopping there.
[1:48:10] Where we're stopping is rapture.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Because once we make it in the rapture,
[1:48:16] our job's over.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; We just want to see people get in the
[1:48:20] rapture. That's where it's at.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; You know, there's people that are going
[1:48:23] to go into the tribulation. I don't want
[1:48:24] to preach people into the tribulation.
[1:48:26] Why would I do that? Why would any
[1:48:28] minister want to do that?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; We want to preach people into the
[1:48:32] rapture. And the thing that's going to
[1:48:33] do that is for them to recognize who
[1:48:35] they are.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; And I'm so very, very, very thankful the
[1:48:39] more that I think about it that I was
[1:48:41] introduced to this message through a
[1:48:43] pastor that preached the truth for our
[1:48:46] day.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; That he preached adoption. He preached
[1:48:50] being positionally placed. I t talked
[1:48:52] about a little while ago, you know, on
[1:48:54] July 27th, 2005 was my very first
[1:48:57] service ever hearing that, you know,
[1:48:59] there was a a a prophet being preached
[1:49:02] about and and so on and so forth. But,
[1:49:04] you know, Brother Ken didn't even really
[1:49:05] preach too much about the prophet. But
[1:49:07] in that service is where I got
[1:49:09] converted. That's where I actually got
[1:49:11] in in love with Jesus Christ again in my
[1:49:14] life because I was like the woman at the
[1:49:15] well. I was a spiritual adulterer. I I
[1:49:19] truly was completely out there. But he
[1:49:21] came and he positionally placed himself
[1:49:23] right in my pathway.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm a living witness of it the same
[1:49:27] way. Brothers and sisters, he doesn't
[1:49:29] change his ways. He's as immutable in
[1:49:32] his nature as he is in his ways.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; So for people to maybe think that I just
[1:49:38] don't know whether I've got the Holy
[1:49:39] Ghost. I want to tell you, ask him and
[1:49:42] he will show you.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; It's not a mystery.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; That's why his prophets SAID IT'S LIKE
[1:49:49] HAVING A BABY. If you have a baby, you
[1:49:51] don't forget that you had a baby. And
[1:49:53] anybody that's ever experienced what
[1:49:54] it's like to see a birth coming forth,
[1:49:57] let alone feeling what it means to have
[1:49:59] a baby, you can't forget that.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; It's awfully quiet.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; But it's true.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; So if you have a question, he's got an
[1:50:11] answer. If there's a question about
[1:50:12] whether I'm saved, he's going to answer
[1:50:14] it. He'll tell you how you know that
[1:50:16] you're saved. If we've got a question on
[1:50:17] whether I'm on the right track with his
[1:50:19] word, he will give us an answer to show
[1:50:21] us that we're on the right track with
[1:50:22] his word. If he's we got a question in
[1:50:24] our marriage, he'll show us. If we've
[1:50:26] got a question in how we're rearing our
[1:50:28] children, he'll show us. He's not going
[1:50:30] to leave us and and and leave us in a
[1:50:33] abandoned state where we're questioning,
[1:50:35] wondering what's going on.
[1:50:37] But what I wanted to say was that
[1:50:39] service, I actually found it on the
[1:50:42] computer years ago and I thought, you
[1:50:43] know, one day I'm going to go back and
[1:50:44] listen to it. and I never did. I just
[1:50:46] burned it on a CD and took it home and I
[1:50:49] cleaning stuff up the other day. I came
[1:50:50] across it and I thought, man, I want to
[1:50:53] listen to this. And I don't know, it
[1:50:55] just did something for me. And uh so I
[1:50:57] asked brother Josh if he would take it
[1:50:58] and just save it on the computer here.
[1:51:00] So if anybody's interested, we could
[1:51:02] share the link and you'll probably
[1:51:03] listen to it and think, I don't even
[1:51:05] know what happened there. [laughter]
[1:51:08] But it was my appointed time. That's all
[1:51:09] I can say.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; God used brother Ken to speak to me. God
[1:51:15] used brother Ken to discern my heart at
[1:51:17] the well.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; And I just think it's so beautiful
[1:51:20] because I had a question. Is there a
[1:51:22] God? And if there is a God, where is the
[1:51:23] God? How could I ever find that guy? I
[1:51:26] would just love to know where that God
[1:51:28] is. But I have no idea where because I
[1:51:31] can see the false over here and I can
[1:51:32] see the false over there and everything
[1:51:34] in between. And I'm not interested in
[1:51:37] finding the false. I want to do it
[1:51:39] right. If I'm ever going to do it, I
[1:51:40] want to do it right. Isn't it wonderful
[1:51:42] how he answers his questions? I'm not
[1:51:45] saying that I'm anything. I'm saying
[1:51:46] that he's everything. And when I
[1:51:49] actually had that question, he brought
[1:51:51] me to it. It took me years. It took me
[1:51:54] years, but I got there. He took me and
[1:51:57] actually showed me.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brad, I'm going on this quote
[1:52:01] here. He says, "So now, now that's the
[1:52:03] reason we have question night once in a
[1:52:05] while is to find out." And it's so
[1:52:09] beautiful. We have these question
[1:52:10] nights. They're actually documented for
[1:52:12] anybody that wants it. It's called Cood.
[1:52:14] It's on the church app or the the sorry,
[1:52:17] the the
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; table the table app. If you go into the
[1:52:22] volumes section and you look it up,
[1:52:25] there's adoption is at the top of it, by
[1:52:27] the way. I don't think that's any
[1:52:29] accident that it's called adoption. A
[1:52:32] it's a great series.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Adoption number one through four. But
[1:52:36] that's not what I wanted to point out.
[1:52:38] The one that I wanted to point out is
[1:52:39] the volume of questions and answers. And
[1:52:42] uh there's a whole bunch of questions
[1:52:43] and answers. And if you don't read, if
[1:52:45] you can't read, if you just are busy and
[1:52:47] you can only listen, you can listen to
[1:52:49] how brother Brandham actually answers.
[1:52:51] And the voice inflection and the
[1:52:52] discernment is so wonderful. But if you
[1:52:55] could ever just listen and then read at
[1:52:57] the same time, there is volumes of books
[1:53:00] called COD, conduct, order, and doctrine
[1:53:02] they're called. And uh it's just
[1:53:04] questions and answers. people asking
[1:53:06] questions, looking for answers. And this
[1:53:09] is brother Brandham setting the church
[1:53:11] back in order. This is the Holy Ghost
[1:53:13] setting the church back in order just
[1:53:15] like Paul in the first church age.
[1:53:17] Brother Bradam says, "So now that's the
[1:53:20] question. We have question night once in
[1:53:22] a while. Now if there's any questions
[1:53:24] now this time I kind of opened it up way
[1:53:27] wide and I say now
[1:53:30] used to be I'd say now if anybody just
[1:53:33] anything pertaining to scripture answer
[1:53:35] ask it says thank you brother and I said
[1:53:38] just anything pertaining to a scripture
[1:53:41] answer see and we would answer it and
[1:53:43] and that's my desire brothers and
[1:53:45] sisters for this local church or even
[1:53:48] people maybe who are sort of associated
[1:53:50] with the local church if you got a
[1:53:51] question, bring it forward. If you
[1:53:53] associate with us, by all means, bring
[1:53:55] it forward and and let's see what the
[1:53:57] Lord will do. Now, I hope we don't get a
[1:53:59] whole bunch of online questions. I just
[1:54:01] want to say this to the brothers. I
[1:54:03] don't monitor the the YouTube feed, so
[1:54:06] if if if questions do come up, if you
[1:54:08] could forward them to me, that would be
[1:54:10] tremendous. I would just hate for them
[1:54:12] to linger there.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; But the first question that was brought
[1:54:15] up, and uh is it really 10 to 12
[1:54:19] already? Is that right?
[1:54:23] We sure that it's not 10 to 11
[1:54:26] cuz I haven't even gotten into the
[1:54:28] question yet.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; You know, it's just setting. Yeah, maybe
[1:54:33] it's a new clock. It's just a little
[1:54:35] fast. It's about 40 45 minutes fast.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; 49 minutes fast.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; I don't even know if I can do this
[1:54:46] justice at this point. My
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; can we stay till two
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; or one
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; ignore the clock
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; you know yeah I will
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; I just want to be respectful you know
[1:55:00] people have commitments and I don't know
[1:55:03] I just love the inspiration of the
[1:55:05] spirit maybe a little too much I guess
[1:55:08] um it's a question that came forward I
[1:55:11] don't know who wrote it and I don't want
[1:55:13] to
[1:55:14] and uh I I think that it should be that
[1:55:16] way we don't want to know who has
[1:55:18] written the question. We just want to
[1:55:19] know that the question's on someone's
[1:55:20] heart. So the question is, can girls
[1:55:23] shave?
[1:55:27] Can girls shave?
[1:55:29] And it says, this is part of the
[1:55:31] question. Can girls shave?
[1:55:33] I cannot find anything about that in the
[1:55:36] message.
[1:55:38] So I want to say this, there actually is
[1:55:43] an answer directly about that in the
[1:55:45] message. And if whoever wrote this
[1:55:49] either looked on conduct, order, and
[1:55:51] doctrine, questions and answers, or just
[1:55:53] typed it in as a table app search, it
[1:55:56] would come up with the answer. But this
[1:55:59] took me in a direction that I think is
[1:56:01] really good. And I maybe I'll just set
[1:56:02] the background for it and and not keep
[1:56:05] us too long. But, you know, I think
[1:56:07] there's there's a scriptural question.
[1:56:09] There's got to be a scriptural answer,
[1:56:10] right? And uh we know that there was a
[1:56:13] time in in the Levitical priesthood
[1:56:15] where people shaved their heads and that
[1:56:18] was typically when they were either in
[1:56:19] mourning or when they actually had
[1:56:21] leprosy. They would have to shave their
[1:56:24] bodies entirely if they had leprosy. But
[1:56:28] the question that we have here in our
[1:56:30] local church is can girls shave? I
[1:56:33] cannot find anything about that in the
[1:56:35] message. So
[1:56:38] maybe I'll jump to the quote. I I kind
[1:56:40] of put it as the the last thing because
[1:56:41] I wanted to go into uh uh bear with me
[1:56:45] for a second here. There it is. So, this
[1:56:50] is in questions and answers in 1964.
[1:56:53] Questions and answers number four 0830.
[1:57:01] Brother Brham,
[1:57:03] is it wrong for a woman to shave her
[1:57:07] legs?
[1:57:09] So, this is a question that's being
[1:57:11] asked directly to the prophet. This
[1:57:13] isn't the question that's local to here,
[1:57:15] but I just have to bring it together and
[1:57:17] say it's about shaving. Now, does a
[1:57:20] woman shave whatever? I don't know. I'm
[1:57:23] not interested. The fact is, some people
[1:57:27] might shave their face. Some people
[1:57:29] might shave their legs. I don't know and
[1:57:32] it doesn't matter. But listen to what
[1:57:34] brother Brandham says about shaving for
[1:57:36] a woman.
[1:57:38] Brother [snorts] Brandham, is it wrong
[1:57:39] for a woman to shave her legs? This is
[1:57:41] what brother Brandham says. Am I seeing
[1:57:43] things? [laughter]
[1:57:46] He talks about it. It's it's mentioned
[1:57:48] here. Am I seeing things? Is this right?
[1:57:50] Does that say that? He says, I can't. He
[1:57:55] says, I don't know.
[1:57:57] I'm going to leave that with you.
[1:58:00] Isn't that beautiful?
[1:58:03] Now, I want to say this because it's
[1:58:05] important. I don't want to actually make
[1:58:07] humor or light of the legitimate
[1:58:10] question that came. And if it's somebody
[1:58:11] just messing around to try and mess with
[1:58:13] me, it's okay. I'm okay with that, too.
[1:58:15] I believe me, I think about all of the
[1:58:17] different things and and I trust that
[1:58:19] nobody would do that. I would trust that
[1:58:22] it would be a genuine, honest question.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; And I want to bring a genuine honest
[1:58:26] answer. Right.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't say that it was
[1:58:30] wrong.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; So if it's something that you do,
[1:58:35] okay,
[1:58:37] I'm not going to say one way or the
[1:58:39] other. I I just think it takes me right
[1:58:41] back to the way my pastor taught me
[1:58:44] where I'm not going to tell you.
[1:58:47] [laughter]
[1:58:48] Why would he say that? He wouldn't come
[1:58:50] right out and say it. And I'm so
[1:58:51] thankful that he wouldn't come right out
[1:58:52] and say it that way,
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; but he would say, "You know what? God
[1:58:55] needs to reveal that to you.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And if we ask him, he'll show you.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; And I believe if God's prophet saw
[1:59:04] something wrong with that, do you not
[1:59:06] think that he would have said, "Nope.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Don't you dare do that."
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; And this is where I haven't even started
[1:59:13] to really answer this question the way
[1:59:16] that I wanted to. Let's just do this for
[1:59:19] the sake of discussion because I really
[1:59:20] don't want to keep everyone here. But uh
[1:59:24] where is it? Bear with me. Okay. Can
[1:59:27] girls shave? I cannot find anything
[1:59:29] about that in the message. Brother
[1:59:30] Bradom, first he was shocked to see it.
[1:59:32] Then he said, "Is this real?" Then he
[1:59:34] said, "I'm going to leave that to you."
[1:59:36] If it was wrong, he would have said,
[1:59:38] "Don't do it."
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; And we'll give you an example for that.
[1:59:41] Let's turn over to First Corinthians.
[1:59:45] First Corinthians, chapter 11. All you
[1:59:49] veterans out there, you know exactly
[1:59:51] where I'm going right now.
[1:59:56] 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:59:59] And we'll probably have a part two on
[2:00:01] this uh just because I want to be
[2:00:03] respectful.
[2:00:05] But we'll see what the Lord will do
[2:00:06] here. 1 Corinthians chap 11. Be ye
[2:00:10] followers of me even as I also am of
[2:00:13] Christ. Now I praise you, brethren, that
[2:00:15] you remember me in all things and keep
[2:00:17] the ordinances as I delivered them to
[2:00:20] you.
[2:00:25] Isn't that beautiful?
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; If we ever wonder,
[2:00:30] I wanted to get into it and uh I think I
[2:00:33] will. We'll we'll do it. Verse three.
[2:00:35] But I would have you to know that the
[2:00:37] head of every man is Christ, and the
[2:00:40] head of every woman is the man, and the
[2:00:44] head of Christ is God.
[2:00:46] Every man praying or prophesying having
[2:00:50] his head covered dishonorth his head.
[2:00:53] And that's this is exactly why brothers
[2:00:55] and sisters if somebody comes into the
[2:00:57] congregation wearing a hat who is a man
[2:01:00] we're going to say please remove that
[2:01:02] because really you are actually
[2:01:04] dishonoring God by wearing a covering on
[2:01:07] your head when you come into the
[2:01:08] presence of God if you're praying. Some
[2:01:11] people aren't praying and you know maybe
[2:01:13] it just is the way it is for them. But
[2:01:15] every man, verse four, every man praying
[2:01:17] or prophesying, having his head coverth,
[2:01:20] dishonorth his head. So what's his head?
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; He's dishonoring Christ by doing that.
[2:01:28] And you know what? We can put any excuse
[2:01:29] behind that if we want to. It's not
[2:01:32] going to be relevant. He's going to say,
[2:01:33] "My word said that you don't." Verse 5
[2:01:36] says, "But every woman that prayth or
[2:01:38] prophesieth with her head uncovered
[2:01:43] dishonereth her head, for that is even
[2:01:47] all one
[2:01:50] as if she were shaven."
[2:01:54] For if the woman be not covered, let her
[2:01:56] also be shorn.
[2:01:59] So that that speaks specifically to if a
[2:02:02] woman's going to cut her hair, she has
[2:02:03] hair, but if she's going to cut her
[2:02:05] head, the word says that it would be
[2:02:07] better if she actually had her head
[2:02:08] shaved. But if she be if it sorry, but
[2:02:12] if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn
[2:02:14] or shaven, let her be covered, let her
[2:02:18] have her hair. For a man indeed ought
[2:02:22] not to cover his head. For as much as he
[2:02:26] is the image and glory of God,
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; but the woman is the glory of the man.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; That to me is just wow.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for a wife that can be
[2:02:42] the glory of the man.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Because really, [laughter]
[2:02:47] men aren't nothing to look at, are they?
[2:02:52] My when we get the man that says, "I'm
[2:02:55] pretty good to look at." There's
[2:02:56] something wrong there.
[2:02:58] Maybe his head's covered.
[2:03:01] Verse eight says, "For the man is not of
[2:03:03] the woman,
[2:03:05] but the woman of the man.
[2:03:10] Neither was the man created for the
[2:03:12] woman, but the woman for the man. The
[2:03:15] woman was created for the man.
[2:03:19] For this cause ought the woman to have
[2:03:21] power on her head because of the angels.
[2:03:26] Nevertheless, neither is the man without
[2:03:28] the woman, neither the woman without the
[2:03:31] man in the Lord. For as the woman is of
[2:03:35] the man, even so is the man also
[2:03:40] by the woman,
[2:03:42] but all things of God. So this verse 12,
[2:03:45] I believe, could be uh a sermon all to
[2:03:49] itself because the woman is of the man.
[2:03:54] She was taken out of his side, right? So
[2:03:57] that she could be his bride. That's why
[2:04:00] she was taken out of his he took a rib
[2:04:02] was the very first surgery that
[2:04:04] happened. It was the very first marriage
[2:04:05] that took place. The woman was of the
[2:04:09] man, but the man also by the woman
[2:04:14] born in sin, shaped in iniquity,
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; come into the world, speaking lies. The
[2:04:19] man is of the woman. The man comes
[2:04:21] through this earth through the woman.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; But isn't it wonderful? All things, all
[2:04:27] things of God.
[2:04:30] I just got into this a little bit and I
[2:04:32] started looking at, you know, in verse
[2:04:33] five, every woman that prayth or
[2:04:37] prophesieth with her head uncovered
[2:04:40] dishonorth her head,
[2:04:43] for that is even all
[2:04:46] for her head. For that is even all one
[2:04:50] as if she were shaven.
[2:04:54] And we know that that is what would
[2:04:56] actually save her in her praying or
[2:04:58] prophesying.
[2:04:59] anyone that that do it publicly.
[2:05:05] So I got into this and I started looking
[2:05:07] at this. What what is it that if she
[2:05:09] does it's actually incorrect?
[2:05:12] Every woman that prayth or prophesieth
[2:05:15] with her head uncovered dishonereth her
[2:05:17] head. Now I said that publicly
[2:05:22] but uh I think it's interesting as I was
[2:05:25] studying this here.
[2:05:28] Oh my,
[2:05:30] I mix myself up sometimes. It happens so
[2:05:33] easy. I got into the Amplified Bible
[2:05:36] with this.
[2:05:39] Uh, bear with me for a second. It's
[2:05:42] verse five. Now, I'm sorry, but I have
[2:05:46] to do this.
[2:05:49] In in the Amplified Bible, it says, "And
[2:05:53] any woman," this is verse 5, "any who
[2:05:55] publicly prays
[2:05:57] or prophesies,
[2:05:59] teaches, refutes, reproves, reproves,
[2:06:03] sorry, admonishes, or comforts when she
[2:06:07] is bareheaded, dishonors her head, her
[2:06:10] husband." It is the same as if her head
[2:06:14] were shaved. it it's the same as if she
[2:06:18] didn't even have a head is what the word
[2:06:20] is saying with that.
[2:06:23] But looking at this discussion about is
[2:06:26] it okay for someone to shave,
[2:06:31] I trust with all my heart that we're not
[2:06:33] talking about a woman shaving her head
[2:06:35] because the hair of the woman is the
[2:06:38] glory of the woman which is the glory of
[2:06:41] the man. And to shave one's head is a
[2:06:46] sign of something. And and I would say
[2:06:48] that it's it's a pretty significant
[2:06:50] sign. And I'm not going to go too far
[2:06:52] down that road, but I I just wanted to
[2:06:54] talk about these two things in verse 5.
[2:06:56] Prayeth or prophesieth. Going into the
[2:06:59] the Greek lexicon and G3
[2:07:02] G4336.
[2:07:04] The word prayeth is to pray to God, to
[2:07:08] supplicate, to worship, pray earnestly,
[2:07:10] or make prayer or prophesieth is G4395
[2:07:15] to foretell events divine, speak under
[2:07:18] inspiration, exercise the prophetic
[2:07:20] office or prophesy. And and some might
[2:07:23] say that's pretty crazy. But I'll tell
[2:07:24] you what, even in and around the message
[2:07:26] of the hour, I have heard of many, not
[2:07:29] just a couple, but a few women who fit
[2:07:33] this description. They like to foretell
[2:07:35] events divine. They speak under
[2:07:38] inspiration and exercise a prophetic
[2:07:41] office.
[2:07:44] Now, this is what the word says. A woman
[2:07:46] that does that, that cuts her hair,
[2:07:48] dishonereth her head.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; And and what's that going to do? do
[2:07:52] that's going to embarrass her husband.
[2:07:54] And if she doesn't have a husband,
[2:07:55] what's that going to do? It's going to
[2:07:56] embarrass her dad. And if she doesn't
[2:07:57] have a husband or a dad, what's that
[2:07:59] going to do? It's going to embarrass
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; I think it's wonderful how, brother
[2:08:07] Brandham, he says this, you know, it it
[2:08:09] it just I'm going to leave it with you.
[2:08:12] Let the Holy Ghost reveal it.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Let let him, the person of Jesus Christ,
[2:08:17] come into your life and reveal it to
[2:08:19] you.
[2:08:21] So, whoever had that question today,
[2:08:22] don't worry. The prophet never spoke out
[2:08:25] against it. And if it was wrong, I
[2:08:26] guarantee you he would have said, "No,
[2:08:28] don't do it."
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; But what he did talk about very very
[2:08:32] in-depth and and I'll probably not get
[2:08:34] too far into it. Next time I'm going to
[2:08:36] pick it up. We're going to talk about
[2:08:37] this because I am going to get into the
[2:08:39] Thotyan spirit and and their hand in a
[2:08:42] glove. Where's Christopher? Their hand
[2:08:44] in a glove. For those people that missed
[2:08:47] the service on Friday, that was a pretty
[2:08:49] powerful little service from a pretty
[2:08:50] powerful little fella.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; We actually put the stool here so he
[2:08:54] could stand on it. And he preached a
[2:08:55] sermon about a hand to a glove and how a
[2:08:57] glove is basically nothing without a
[2:09:00] hand to fit inside it. But when it fits
[2:09:02] inside it, oh boy, I could preach it,
[2:09:04] brother,
[2:09:05] but I'm not going to. But he talked
[2:09:07] about it and that's what it is. When a
[2:09:09] woman dishonors her head by cutting her
[2:09:11] hair, what's she saying?
[2:09:14] She's saying, "I don't need leadership.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; I don't need leadership. I can dishonor
[2:09:20] my head."
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; But you know what she's going to say in
[2:09:22] the world is, "I don't have to dishonor
[2:09:24] my head by cutting my hair. I'm not
[2:09:27] doing that. I still love Jesus Christ.
[2:09:29] If you loved him, you would keep his
[2:09:32] commandments." That's what he said.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; If you love me, keep my commandments.
[2:09:37] Amen.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; But you know, many people are really
[2:09:41] close to them with their lips, but
[2:09:43] they're miles and miles away with their
[2:09:45] heart.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; It's because the knowledge hasn't made
[2:09:49] it all the way down that longest journey
[2:09:51] that has to happen right down into the
[2:09:53] heart. And like we're talking about,
[2:09:55] brothers and sisters, there's only one
[2:09:56] thing that that that's going to change
[2:09:58] our bodies in the day in which we live.
[2:10:00] And and that is the faith of Jesus
[2:10:02] Christ living out through us. And the
[2:10:04] only way that's going to happen is to
[2:10:06] humble ourselves in the sight of the
[2:10:07] Lord. How is that going to happen? Is to
[2:10:09] just say, "Be it unto me according to
[2:10:10] thy word, according to thy messenger."
[2:10:13] Because that's the way he chose to do
[2:10:15] things.
[2:10:17] You know, some would say that brother
[2:10:18] Brandham was really hard on women about
[2:10:20] cutting hair.
[2:10:22] He would people would say that brother
[2:10:24] Brandham was really hard about women
[2:10:27] wearing a garment that pertained to a
[2:10:29] man.
[2:10:32] That's what that's what people will say.
[2:10:34] But you know, let's just be clear,
[2:10:36] brothers and sisters. It's not brother
[2:10:38] Brandham that said that.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Alls he did is what prophets do.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Prophets only say what's already been
[2:10:47] said.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; If you want to say it, who humanly said
[2:10:53] it first? Paul said it first.
[2:10:58] But yet somehow someway we can just take
[2:11:00] out the the words of Paul to suit our
[2:11:03] life and say, "Well, this is our
[2:11:04] tradition. This is the way we've done
[2:11:06] it." I mean, I grew up with that. I grew
[2:11:10] up with that with shorts and
[2:11:14] bikinis and all of it in the world. I I
[2:11:18] never wore a bikini for the record.
[2:11:21] Strike that from the record. But it was
[2:11:24] normal for women to wear slacks and
[2:11:27] pants. It was normal for women to have
[2:11:31] short hair, permed hair. It was just
[2:11:34] normal for that to be. Women could wear
[2:11:36] garments that pertain to a man. And and
[2:11:39] you know, I think it's so important for
[2:11:41] us to re recognize that this wasn't some
[2:11:44] some some crazy doctrine that William
[2:11:46] Brham brought. All he did was point back
[2:11:48] to the scripture
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; and said, you know what? We got to let
[2:11:51] the scripture be our absolute. Amen.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; And I think it's so beautiful because
[2:11:55] when the ministerial association decided
[2:11:57] they were going to challenge God's
[2:11:59] prophet about this about the word of God
[2:12:01] on water baptism and they set a trap for
[2:12:04] him, but the spirit of God came around
[2:12:06] and told them a couple days before the
[2:12:08] day before, you know what? You're trying
[2:12:10] to set a trap and it ain't going to
[2:12:11] work. You're going to lose your deposit.
[2:12:13] The building that you had rented isn't
[2:12:15] going to work out. And we know they got
[2:12:17] all upset because he started to discern
[2:12:19] their heart, the spirit of God and the
[2:12:20] prophet. But what he said to them when
[2:12:22] he got on stage there for that meeting,
[2:12:25] he told them, "I challenge any one of
[2:12:27] you that wants to challenge me in the
[2:12:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ about
[2:12:31] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[2:12:33] Jesus Christ. Get your Bible, put it
[2:12:35] under your arm, and come and stand on
[2:12:36] the platform right beside me and let's
[2:12:38] talk about it."
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; And I heard it said recently, and I just
[2:12:42] think, man, amen. And I believe that
[2:12:44] with all my heart that you know what?
[2:12:46] The reason men didn't come up there was
[2:12:48] the spirits inside of them recognized
[2:12:50] they would probably fall dead at the
[2:12:52] presence of the angel of the Lord.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Because God will not be mocked.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; God won't be mocked.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; This wasn't some crazy doctrine that
[2:13:03] some crazy crank from the back woods of
[2:13:06] Kentucky brought to the world. THIS WAS
[2:13:08] WHAT PAUL PREACHED. AMEN.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; And you know, just for the sake of it,
[2:13:14] I'm going to clench the nail here,
[2:13:15] brothers and sisters, and then I'll call
[2:13:18] the musicians.
[2:13:20] I'm going to clench the nail here.
[2:13:22] Deuteronomy chapter 22:5.
[2:13:26] Deuteronomy 22:5.
[2:13:31] Brother Brham was hard on women about
[2:13:34] cutting hair,
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; which we read out of 1 Corinthians
[2:13:37] chapter 11. We know Paul was setting the
[2:13:40] Corinthian church in order. He was the
[2:13:43] pattern that all of the other church
[2:13:45] ages were to follow after. He was the
[2:13:48] pioneer, so to speak, for the gentile
[2:13:50] church.
[2:13:52] But you know, in Deuteronomy chapter 22,
[2:13:54] alls that Paul did was say what what
[2:13:58] excuse me, God said to his prophet
[2:14:00] Moses. He didn't bring a new doctrine.
[2:14:02] What he said was out of Deuteronomy
[2:14:04] chapter 22, excuse me, verse 5, the
[2:14:07] woman shall not wear that which
[2:14:08] pertainth unto a man.
[2:14:11] And we hear that all the time, but I
[2:14:13] think it's important to actually read
[2:14:14] the whole verse. Don't you? Especially
[2:14:16] in the day in which we live.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; The woman shall not wear that which
[2:14:20] pertainth unto a man, neither shall a
[2:14:23] man put on a woman's garment, for all
[2:14:26] that do so are abomination unto the Lord
[2:14:30] thy God.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if the Lord isn't your God,
[2:14:33] then I guess it's not an abomination, is
[2:14:35] it?
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Now, I think it's important to say this.
[2:14:41] Really important to say this.
[2:14:43] Deuteronomy 22:5, there's a word in
[2:14:46] there, for all that do so are
[2:14:49] abomination unto the Lord thy God.
[2:14:53] Let's go over to Leviticus.
[2:14:56] Leviticus chapter 20. I'm sorry we're
[2:14:58] going a little bit longer, but I just I
[2:14:59] felt like I had to go here and I didn't
[2:15:01] get too much push back about it.
[2:15:03] Leviticus 20:3, especially in the day in
[2:15:06] which we live, if a man lie also lie
[2:15:09] with mankind, as he lith with a woman,
[2:15:13] both of them have committed an
[2:15:16] abomination.
[2:15:18] They shall surely be put to death. Their
[2:15:20] blood shall be upon them. Amen.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Now, in the day in which we live, this
[2:15:25] doesn't really apply because people
[2:15:27] aren't going to be put to death for some
[2:15:29] countries maybe they will be. And maybe
[2:15:31] some people out there will try and do
[2:15:33] that. But, you know, back in this day,
[2:15:36] it was the law and they lived according
[2:15:39] to this law. So, as I read these words,
[2:15:42] I want you to understand full well that
[2:15:44] brother Barry isn't saying that we need
[2:15:46] to go and put people to death because
[2:15:48] that's not up to us to do. Some people
[2:15:51] believe that we need to get so fanatical
[2:15:53] about Christianity that we're going to
[2:15:55] have to go and put people to DEATH AND
[2:15:56] EVEN BELIEVE THAT WE'RE SERVING GOD
[2:15:58] DOING IT. That's the influence of an
[2:16:00] evil spirit.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; What we're talking about here is a
[2:16:04] spiritual death.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; The day in which we live, those people
[2:16:08] that conduct themselves in this
[2:16:12] unorderly fashion, I'll say they're
[2:16:15] committing exactly what the word says,
[2:16:17] abomination before God. and they're
[2:16:20] going to actually perish.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; But you know, they have the opportunity
[2:16:24] to repent just like anybody else does.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; What would HAPPEN IF SOMEBODY LIVED that
[2:16:31] life and came into the framework of the
[2:16:34] Christian church here, Calvary Living
[2:16:35] Word? Would we be able to say, "WELCOME,
[2:16:37] BROTHER. GET WASHED BY the water of the
[2:16:39] word." Or would we say, "OH, LOOK AT
[2:16:42] THAT."
[2:16:45] because they are looking for the exact
[2:16:47] same grace that we are thriving on.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; It's not different grace.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; But this this word I want to talk about
[2:16:58] abomination. I heard brother Aaron
[2:17:00] McGiri say it the first time and it's
[2:17:01] just resonated with me and I've gone
[2:17:03] over it and over it and over it and it
[2:17:05] just means so much. If you ever have
[2:17:07] anybody saying anything to you about
[2:17:08] this, you can remind them of what the
[2:17:10] lexicon says. H8441
[2:17:15] abomination in the word of God. It says
[2:17:18] properly something disgusting morally
[2:17:21] that is as noun an
[2:17:25] abborance especially idolatry or
[2:17:28] concretely an idol abominal custom thing
[2:17:31] abomination. It's exactly the same word
[2:17:36] for someone that wears a garment that
[2:17:38] pertains to a man or if a mankind or a
[2:17:41] woman kind lays with the same kind. It's
[2:17:44] the same word.
[2:17:46] But we have so many times people in
[2:17:49] Christianity, Christianity would say,
[2:17:51] good Christian people would say THIS IS
[2:17:53] A CULT. WHAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING IS IS WHAT
[2:17:55] YOU'RE FOLLOWING IS ABOMINATION.
[2:17:59] But it ain't. the commandment of God
[2:18:02] through his servant, the prophets.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; We know that in the days of the voice of
[2:18:07] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[2:18:09] to sound, the mystery of God should be
[2:18:11] finished. Where's that mystery going to
[2:18:12] be hit? Brothers and sisters, this is
[2:18:14] one of the greatest revelations that
[2:18:15] came through the ministry of William,
[2:18:17] Mary, and Brandham is that there isn't
[2:18:18] going to be something new added to the
[2:18:21] word to open those seals. It's already
[2:18:23] in the word. It just takes the
[2:18:25] revelation by THE SPIRIT TO REVEAL IT to
[2:18:28] us.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:31] So if anybody wonders why we don't cut
[2:18:33] our hair, because the word says so,
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; not because Brandham said so.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; If anybody wonders why the women, they
[2:18:41] wear skirts all the time. They don't
[2:18:42] wear garments that pertain to a man. If
[2:18:44] anybody wonders why men don't wear
[2:18:47] dresses that pertain TO A WOMAN, BECAUSE
[2:18:50] THE WORD SAYS SO.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; It's not because any man said so.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; God said so first. Paul said so second.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; Brandom said so third. And I could say,
[2:19:02] hey, we say so fourth. Hallelujah.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; WE JUST BELIEVE WHAT [screaming] PAUL
[2:19:07] PREACHED. THAT'S ALL. [applause]
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; So to summarize this question ever who
[2:19:15] it was, just like brother Brandham would
[2:19:16] say, you know, it's up to you. Just ask
[2:19:20] the Lord.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; But the prophet didn't come out and say
[2:19:23] it's wrong for a woman to shave. So God
[2:19:26] bless you. go on your way. I would say
[2:19:28] just remain exactly the way you are.
[2:19:31] [laughter]
[2:19:32] Don't try and be something one way or
[2:19:34] something the other way. Just don't wear
[2:19:35] a garment that pertains to a man and
[2:19:37] don't do the other thing and I think
[2:19:39] we'll be okay. Most of all, GET THE HOLY
[2:19:42] GHOST AND LET HIM REVEAL IT TO you
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; and we'll all be good. I'll call the
[2:19:47] musicians. Sorry we went a little bit
[2:19:49] long today.
[2:19:52] I just think it's such encouragement to
[2:19:54] know that once upon a time I had a a
[2:19:57] Christian fellow
[2:19:59] have us over for dinner, my wife and I,
[2:20:01] and
[2:20:02] him and his wife were very involved in
[2:20:04] their church and they're wonderful
[2:20:06] people.
[2:20:09] But he actually singled out my wife
[2:20:11] after supper,
[2:20:13] after dessert,
[2:20:15] when everyone was happy and relaxed. And
[2:20:19] he said, "So, what is it about the
[2:20:20] skirts? What is it about the hair? Why
[2:20:24] is it that you do that? And and you're
[2:20:28] Christians, but yet we're Christians and
[2:20:31] my wife wears jeans."
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; He really tried to nail it down. And I
[2:20:36] felt like he was actually attacking my
[2:20:38] wife. And unfortunately, I got a little
[2:20:40] bit in the flesh.
[2:20:43] But too bad for him. I actually had
[2:20:45] already heard this from brother Aaron.
[2:20:47] And I believe it was from the Lord
[2:20:48] because it gave me such a courage to
[2:20:50] simply say, "Listen, man. It is exactly
[2:20:52] the same word. Do you believe in
[2:20:54] homosexuality?"
[2:20:55] No. Why certainly not?
[2:20:59] Well, shockingly, it's exactly the same
[2:21:01] word that's used in God's eyes.
[2:21:05] The one that commits that act in God's
[2:21:08] eyes is doing the same thing by wearing
[2:21:10] garments that pertain to a man. Now, I'm
[2:21:12] not saying this. The word is saying
[2:21:14] this.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; How can WE REFUTE THAT THE WORD SAYS
[2:21:17] THIS?
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you how.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Start getting into different versions of
[2:21:23] the Bible.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Just get into different versions of the
[2:21:28] Bible. I really started to study this
[2:21:30] recently and you know it's shocking to
[2:21:33] me.
[2:21:34] You take the NIV.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; There's verses that are just missing.
[2:21:39] Just like an elevator will go the first
[2:21:42] floor all the way up to the 10th floor,
[2:21:44] the 11th floor, the 12th floor, then
[2:21:47] it's the 14th floor and the 15th floor.
[2:21:49] Where'd the 13th go? How could you just
[2:21:52] skip a floor?
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; They do it in the NIV Bible. They just
[2:21:58] skip verses. I'm not going to try and go
[2:22:00] into them right now. I will eventually.
[2:22:02] If you want to do a quick search, just
[2:22:03] go and ask chat GPT, give me a detailed
[2:22:07] summary of the difference between the
[2:22:10] NIV Bible and the King James Version
[2:22:12] Bible, and you'll be surprised to see,
[2:22:16] but some of the verses are actually key
[2:22:18] verses,
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; very important verses. And people will
[2:22:22] say, scholars will say, well, you know,
[2:22:24] it it actually is just duplicate uh uh
[2:22:26] translation. And and the reason why
[2:22:28] we've taken it out is because it just
[2:22:29] says it twice. And it doesn't need to
[2:22:31] say it twice. The verse before and the
[2:22:32] verse after they just pick it up. Why
[2:22:34] would God give his prophet that little
[2:22:36] book that was open, the King James
[2:22:38] version, to actually give to the people?
[2:22:41] Why would he do that? I guess first you
[2:22:43] have to believe that God uses prophets.
[2:22:47] But, you know, the actual translations
[2:22:50] have a lot to do with it. I was looking
[2:22:52] at one recently from Brother Jeff. He
[2:22:55] was in Arizona and he gave me a copy. I
[2:22:57] actually paid for it, but I got a copy
[2:22:59] of the I think it's the 1611 Bible. And
[2:23:03] and I was talking to brother John
[2:23:05] Panicker about this. When you look at
[2:23:07] where the Old Testament ends, maybe
[2:23:09] other Bibles say this, I haven't seen
[2:23:11] it. Where the Old Testament ends and the
[2:23:13] New Testament begins. the Old Testament,
[2:23:15] Malachi, right below Malachi on the
[2:23:17] page, it says the end of the prophets.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; I was surprised to see that because
[2:23:23] that's exactly where a lot of people
[2:23:25] lie. They say there's no such thing as
[2:23:26] prophets. Now,
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; maybe there's a gift of prophecy in the
[2:23:29] church, but there's no major prophets.
[2:23:31] But yet, it's interesting because
[2:23:33] Malachi 4:5 and 6, what does it say
[2:23:35] there?
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send who? YOU, ELIJAH, THE
[2:23:43] prophet before the great and terrible
[2:23:45] day of the Lord.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; So, there's still one more prophet.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad today that you know
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; that you know what you know?
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; And if you don't know, if you have a
[2:23:59] mystery, I trust that God will reveal it
[2:24:01] to you. Maybe stand with me as we close
[2:24:02] today.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:05] Gracious heavenly father, we're so
[2:24:07] thankful, Lord,
[2:24:09] for the word that you have handed down
[2:24:11] through the ages, Lord. [music] That
[2:24:13] ancient word, Father. It's it's been
[2:24:15] given to change our bodies, Lord. And
[2:24:18] Father, we know that it's not just to
[2:24:20] give us a body change, and that will
[2:24:22] create a character change. It's the
[2:24:25] other way around. It's given to create a
[2:24:27] character change. Oh, Father, to change
[2:24:30] our characters into your very image.
[2:24:32] That's the way you created man.
[2:24:34] Help us, Lord Jesus, to take the book
[2:24:37] and eat it up and to change our
[2:24:39] character to be after yours, Lord Jesus.
[2:24:42] Because once our characters all come in
[2:24:44] line with yours, oh, then you're going
[2:24:47] to take your bride home. We which are
[2:24:50] alive and remain will not hinder those
[2:24:52] who sleep. Oh, Father, we long to see
[2:24:54] those who have fallen before us, Lord,
[2:24:57] who sleep in the dust of the earth. We
[2:24:59] know they're in paradise waiting.
[2:25:01] They're never been more alive, Father.
[2:25:04] But Lord, we long for them. And Lord
[2:25:07] Jesus, we pray that you would just allow
[2:25:09] this word that was spoken today to
[2:25:12] resonate in our hearts, Lord. That we
[2:25:13] would consider these thoughts, Father.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, that if we have a question in our
[2:25:19] heart, that we would be able to have
[2:25:20] courage enough to ask you to answer it
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; in our church, Lord. Not in a vague way,
[2:25:26] but in a very specific fashion, that we
[2:25:29] could just have peace in our heart,
[2:25:31] Lord. If the devil troubles us and makes
[2:25:33] us feel like we're doing something wrong
[2:25:35] or out of order, maybe it's not and it's
[2:25:38] just the devil.
[2:25:40] Father, I thank you for whoever wrote
[2:25:42] that question. I pray that you would
[2:25:43] bless their heart, Lord.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; And Father, if there's any other
[2:25:47] questions, I pray that you would just
[2:25:48] allow them to be manifest as we read
[2:25:50] about, Lord, if we have to get a little
[2:25:52] child to bring them up, Lord, so nobody
[2:25:54] knows who it's from,
[2:25:56] let it be so. Father, I pray that you
[2:25:59] would just keep your hand upon us now as
[2:26:00] we go our separate ways. That Lord, we
[2:26:03] would esteem you greater than our our
[2:26:05] thoughts and than our ideas. And oh,
[2:26:08] Father, we know that the children of
[2:26:10] Israel in the in Gan, they esteemed the
[2:26:13] token greater than all of their thoughts
[2:26:15] and all of their traditions because they
[2:26:17] knew the death angel was coming. And how
[2:26:20] did they know? It's because your prophet
[2:26:22] told them.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for letting us know
[2:26:27] that we can take the token, too. We can
[2:26:29] take the token and apply it in our
[2:26:31] lives.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that you would just keep
[2:26:34] your hand upon each one of us. Lord, be
[2:26:35] with those who are traveling. Lord,
[2:26:38] those who are away, maybe some sick in
[2:26:41] their bodies, maybe some are just
[2:26:42] traveling, visiting, wherever they are.
[2:26:45] Father, we just thank you for them and
[2:26:46] we pray that you would bless them
[2:26:48] abundantly.
[2:26:49] as we go our separate ways. Father, just
[2:26:51] receive some worship now in Jesus
[2:26:55] Christ's name we pray.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that song? Word of God ever
[2:27:02] true.
[2:27:11] Holy word
[2:27:14] long preserved
[2:27:16] for our walk
[2:27:19] in this world.
[2:27:22] They resound
[2:27:24] with [music and singing] God's own
[2:27:26] heart.
[2:27:28] Let the ancient words impart.
[2:27:33] Word of God
[2:27:36] ever true,
[2:27:38] changing [singing and music] me,
[2:27:41] changing you.
[2:27:44] We have come with [music] hope.
[2:27:47] [singing]
[2:27:49] Oh, let the word of God depart.
[2:27:53] [music and singing]
[2:27:55] Words of life,
[2:27:57] words of hope,
[2:28:00] give us strength,
[2:28:03] help us
[2:28:06] in this [singing and music] world
[2:28:08] where we roam. The word of God will
[2:28:13] [singing and music] guide us home.
[2:28:16] Word of God
[2:28:19] ever [music]
[2:28:20] true.
[2:28:22] Changing me, [singing]
[2:28:24] changing. [music]
[2:28:27] We have [singing] come with hope and
[2:28:30] heart. Oh, let the word of God be
[2:28:35] impart. [music]
[2:28:38] Holy words
[2:28:40] of our faith [singing and music]
[2:28:43] handed down
[2:28:45] to this age
[2:28:48] gave to [music and singing] us through
[2:28:51] sacriice.
[2:28:53] Oh he the faithful words of Christ.
[2:28:57] [music]
[2:29:04] changing.
[2:29:06] [music]
[2:29:09] We have come [music] with open hearts.
[2:29:14] Oh, let the word of God.
[2:29:19] [music]
[2:29:21] Can we sing 611?
[2:29:23] I hope that we could just sing this
[2:29:26] today, but take it with us and sing it
[2:29:28] all week long, remembering this is about
[2:29:31] us.
[2:29:33] Redeemed how I love to proclaim
[2:29:36] [singing and music]
[2:29:37] it. Oh, redeemed by the blood of the
[2:29:40] lamb.
[2:29:43] Redeemed through [music] his [singing]
[2:29:44] infinite mercy,
[2:29:47] his child. And forever I am adopted.
[2:29:52] [music] Redee,
[2:29:55] redeemed,
[2:29:57] redeemed [singing] by the blood of the
[2:29:59] lamb.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; his child and forever [music]
[2:30:12] I am
[2:30:15] so happy in Jesus.
[2:30:19] No language [music]
[2:30:20] my rapture can tell. [singing]
[2:30:24] Heat. Heat.
[2:30:28] [music]
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; My [music]
[2:30:46] [music]
[2:30:50] child and [singing] forever I am.
[2:30:55] I think of my city. [music]
[2:31:00] Oh, I think of [singing] him all the day
[2:31:02] long.
[2:31:05] I see I [singing and music] cannot
[2:31:07] decide
[2:31:10] is the name of my soul.
[2:31:13] [music and singing]
[2:31:20] [music and singing]
[2:31:30] [music]
[2:31:32] [singing] And forever I am.
[2:31:36] I know [music] I shall see his music.
[2:31:42] [music]

[2:32:17] Oh, think of [music] my blessing
