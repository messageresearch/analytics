great songs on the uh uh the concert night and the history behind and I just want to give you a little bit of my history of why little Bethlehem and it's the first the first stanza says Oh Come Ye to Bethlehem why Bethlehem I've been listening to all the prophet sermons on Christmas is kind of my you call it my tradition and uh I heard why little Bethlehem and brother Ram gives all the history of why I think salon and and Rahab settled in in Bethlehem then then Jesse then then all the way down David was anointed in Bethlehem and then we called for that drink they ran to Bethlehem to The Well of Jacob to bring that that water to him so Bethlehem is very very very significant we we were taught by the prophet why it was significant the world's got the dates wrong but they've got the event right I mean he was born Jesus Christ came to this earth I just love this this stanza and just the understanding sing it with understanding this morning just going to sing the first and last verse and
