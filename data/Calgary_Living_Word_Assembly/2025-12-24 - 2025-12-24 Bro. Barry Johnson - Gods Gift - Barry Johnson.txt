========================================
[music] [music] [music] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hey, may God bless each one of you once again this evening. Good to have each one out, visitors alike. Each one good to be in the house of the Lord once again tonight. Let's [music] start this evening service with your awesome in this place as a confession to the Lord tonight. As I come into your presence, past the gates of praise, though we're standing face to face. As I come into your presence, pass the gates of praise, into your sanctuary, till we're standing face [singing] to face. I look upon your countenance. I see the fullness of your grace. I can only [singing] bow down and say, [music and singing] "Oh, you are awesome in this place, mighty God. Oh, you are awesome in this place. Heaven Father, you are worthy of all praise. [music and singing] To you our lives be. You are awesome in this [singing and music] place, mighty God. Oh, you are awesome in this place, mighty God. Oh, you are awesome in this place. Heaven Father, you [singing] are worthy of all praise. To you [music and singing] our lives we raise. You are awesome in [music and singing] this place, mighty God. Maybe stand with me if you would. Ephesians speaks of open the eyes of our hearts being enlightened. Let's just sing this as a prayer to the Lord [music] tonight. Lord, would you open the eyes of my heart tonight? &gt;&gt; Well, open the eyes of my heart, Lord. [singing] Open the eyes of my heart. [singing] I want to see [music] you. I want to see you, oh [music and singing] Lord. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open [singing] the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. I want to [singing] see you, [music] oh Lord. Open the eyes [singing] of my heart, Lord. [music] Open [singing] the eyes of my heart. I want to see [music] you. I [music] want to [singing] see you, oh Lord. [singing] Open the [music] eyes of my heart, Lord. [music] Open [singing] the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. I [music] want to see you. To see you. High [singing] lifted up. Shining [music and singing] in the light of your glory. Pour out [music and singing] your power and love as we sing. Holy, holy, [music and singing] holy to see you high and lifted up. Oh, shining in [music] the light of [singing] your glory. Oh, pour out your power [singing] and love as we [music] sing holy, holy, holy. [singing] As we sing holy, holy, holy. I want to [singing and music] see you. I want to see you. Der with me if you would this evening. Lord, I believe that's the desire of each heart this this evening. Lord, we just want to see you see you more alive in our midst. Lord, see you more alive in our our our [music] own lives. Father, we've come here this evening to be washed by the water of your word, Lord. Not come to stir up an emotion that's that's outside of your word, but Lord, we know that stimulation comes with revelation. Father, if there's something that stimulates us, we can't help but say yes, Lord. That's nothing but the truth. Amen to that word. Lord, help us, Lord, just to have the freedom here tonight. Lord, if there's any place a believer should be able to feel relaxed and at home and free as amongst brothers and sisters in a in a in a church assembly like this, help us, Lord. Forgive us, Lord, of [music] of lukewarmness that might creep in, Lord, or s spirit of this world that may be attached itself to us. Lord, we just come against every unclean spirit tonight and cast it away in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you may have liberty that you may have freedom here tonight. Lord, we've come to be changed from glory to glory. May your word have that effect on us. Lord, we've come here for correction. We've come for here for encouragement. [music] Lord, whatever it is, Lord, that you would have for each individual, Lord. We say it often, Lord. It's like a one room schoolhouse, but Lord, you're the great God of the universe. You know what every need is and you can take one man, one ministry, one pastor and and meet the needs of every single sheep here just with a nugget here, a thought there, a quote here, Lord, that would just encourage every one of us wherever we are in our journey, Lord. We know that. We we love you for that, Lord. We love you, Lord, for how you talk to us individually like that. And we ask you, Lord, tonight, would you come by our way, Lord? Would you walk every aisle, Lord? Would you sit beside us in our seats, Lord? Would you put your arm around us, Lord, and commune and fellowship with us? We desire to serve you, [music] Lord, more than in 2026 than we did this year, Lord. As we we we come to the end of this year, Lord, we just want to love you more, Lord. We want you to open the eyes of our hearts to understanding, Lord. Father, to be more mature, adopted sons and daughters of God. Lord, we know that when that bride finally realizes who she is and what it is, we'll be we'll be taken from this earth. We'll we'll be caught up together with those that have come forth from the grave, we'll we'll we'll meet you in the clouds, Lord. We'll crown you the King of Kings. Lord, what a glorious day awaits us. But Lord, as we gather here tonight, may we just remind one another [music] of how great you are through our singing. May we just raise the worship before you, May, and may we receive the word as it comes forth. We pray tonight. Grant these mercies we ask in the precious name of the Lord Jesus. We ask these mercies. Amen. Amen. We ever cease tonight. Marvelous, marvelous grace. We were talking around the dinner table about the grace of God. Our pastor brought that that question and the answer about why the Jews are blinded. And we said it's grace. That's what [music] he brought to us. And we know it's grace this evening. This song kind of sums it up. first, third, and fourth verse of that tonight. Oh, marvelous grace of our loveing [singing and music] Lord. Oh, grace that exceeds [music] our sin and our guilt.

[music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I [music] [singing] amen. God bless you tonight. Welcome to the house of the Lord. If you have a need tonight, maybe just make it [music] known unto him by way of an uplift hand as we go to him in prayer. Just like to remember Sister Tina. She's requested prayer. [music] She has the flu. She didn't actually request prayer, but she told me that she has the flu. And I told her we'd pray for her. I also like to remember my nephew Zach Natarak. He's got pneumonia in the hospital and his [music] family also. Let's just bow. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, there's no greater privilege on this side of eternity than to exalt you, [music] Lord. And Father, what an honor and a privilege it is to [music] be able to gather together in your name to do so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray that we could just strip off all of our humanity, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, that we could get beside ourselves tonight, Lord, &gt;&gt; and just invite you, Father, to minister to us in a way maybe like you never have before. Father, we have many needs in our [music] lives, many situations, Lord, that we cannot even understand. &gt;&gt; But Father, we know that you're in control or you're not God. &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that you are. You are seated on your throne. &gt;&gt; And nothing can move that. &gt;&gt; And Father, we know that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Father, we just invite you to meet each and every need that was made known unto you tonight, Lord, by the way of an uplift hand. Father, whether it's someone present with us here in this building with you, or Father, someone tuning in somewhere [music] else, we pray that you would minister to that need, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sovereignly, Lord, and we'll be careful to give you the praise, Lord. We will not be like the other nine lepers running away with our healing. we will come back and thank you, Father, specifically for that request. Oh, heavenly father, tonight we want to remember Sister [music] Tina, Lord, who's down with the flu. We pray that you would touch her, that you would raise her up in the name of Jesus. [music] Father, one more time, we ask that you would come on the scene for Zach Natarak, Lord, in the hospital, the Foothills Hospital, Lord, with pneumonia. Father, we know that you're more than able. We pray that you would be with my sister Kelly [music] and her husband Brad. Oh, and his mom Betty. Oh, father and my mom. Lord, all these people affected by this devil called musculardrophe. Father, we just rebuke [music] it in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; I pray that you would just bring peace and comfort to each one. Lord, we just ask Lord now that you would be glorified in the rest of this service, Father. and every word that's spoken, Father, and every heart that's receives it, Lord. Father, that you would just be glorified now. We love you and we thank you. We ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Thank you, musicians. If you have your Bibles tonight, I'd like to read from a few places, but I'll start with Luke chapter 2. Luke chapter 2. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; like to thank each and everyone for coming out on a wintry Christmas Eve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's a kind of a neat thing that we're actually able to gather together this way &gt;&gt; on Christmas Eve because we don't gather like a [snorts] lot of Christians do around this time where it's only Christmas or Easter. Tonight, I just would like to read the story of the birth of Jesus because &gt;&gt; it is Christmas and we're [snorts] certainly thankful for Christmas. &gt;&gt; In the book of Luke, chapter 2 verse 1. And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing was f first made when Sirenius was governor of Syria. And all went to be taxed, everyone into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea into the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child. We were talking about this earlier today and how they weren't yet married. They were engaged. His espoused wife being great with child. And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in their field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you. Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace and good will toward men." And it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us." And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; That you're not a babe lying in a manger. &gt;&gt; Father, we're not making a nativity scene that we can try and replicate that time. We know that that time came for a purpose, Lord. And many people want to look at it and think that it was simply the purpose of having Christmas and having gifts. But we know that purpose, Father, was to save mankind from himself. And we thank you for that gift that you sent, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that's the greatest gift. And that's the reason that there is a Christmas season. We thank you for it, Lord. Now we just ask that you would take the words that were spoken that you would break them open to us fresh once again. Lord, as we turn to your word, we give you all the praise and glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Certainly appreciate that scripture. love the reading of the birth of Jesus and the story of it and [snorts] really enjoy Christmas in general. The Christmas season is such a wonderful time. It's people tend to get nice nicer around the Christmas season and it's uh it's just a neat thing to see, you know, and I believe Brother Brandham even talks about it. If if the world would just stay that way, it would be such a a wonderful place to live in. But we know this world is not our home. Just like to welcome all of our visitors tonight. God bless you. Certainly appreciate having you here. And uh certainly miss those that couldn't come today. We know it's not always easy. And even with the Christmas season, there's commitments. There's things that we have going and we certainly love and appreciate each one. you know, uh, merry Christmas, I think, is such a wonderful thing and, uh, even the saying, Merry Christmas, I think it's, uh, a beautiful thing. We could say that and, uh, unabashedly mean it. &gt;&gt; Whereas many people can say it in this world and they only say it because they're actually under the anointing of the spirit of Christmas. But as believers, I think to say Merry Christmas, it shouldn't make us nervous. It shouldn't scare us. But I know some people get upset if you say merry Christmas. And I wonder where that comes from. I really do. I know in the message, brother Brandham, he says in one place that we should say, you know, God bless you. God be with you instead of Merry Christmas. But I know he didn't say don't say Merry Christmas. That's a bad thing to do. He never said that. So where did it come in and around the message that we should be nervous about saying Merry Christmas? I don't think it's something that we should be afraid of because we know who we are, don't we? &gt;&gt; We realize who we are and and what we're raised up for. We're not raised up to fall under the spirit of every single season that comes around. We don't fall under the same spirit of of Christmas that we fall under for Halloween, that we fall under for Easter. We fall under one spirit, and that's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; But we don't fall under it. We're raised up to it. Right. &gt;&gt; And I think it's such a wonderful thing. But you know, the spirit of Christmas is one thing, but to say Merry Christmas is kindness. It's human kindness. If we could say Merry Christmas as a believer to people in this world that aren't even Christian, we can say something to them that they don't even understand. Because what we're talking about, Merry Christmas, is the gift that God gave to this world of eternal life that we read about in this in this chapter here. I think it's so beautiful. But we're not caught up in the Christmas spirit just because we say, "Merry Christmas." Maybe we have a Christmas card and we give it to someone and it says, "Merry Christmas." It shouldn't be offensive to us as a believer, should it? Why would it be? It doesn't make any sense to me at all. Right. &gt;&gt; The only thing that it would do to me if someone would get upset by that, it would show me that there's something a little bit pious going on. &gt;&gt; Why would we get upset by the words Merry Christmas? Especially because if you search it out in the message, Brother Brham said it 16 times. He said those words, "Merry Christmas." And he said it in a way that was just like this. Merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; I want to wish you a merry Christmas. Yes. &gt;&gt; Shocking that we would even talk that way, isn't it? &gt;&gt; But I know people that have been upset because they've heard Merry Christmas. What a strange thing. I'll tell you what it is. It's teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's what that is. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But tonight, I don't want to go that way. I want to bring you greetings from brother Ed Hammermeister and the saints at End Time Message Tabernacle. I want to bring you greetings from uh from the uh brother Jonah Mi in Colona [snorts] and the saints there as well. Certainly wonderful to talk to the brothers and just stay in contact with them. And we're uh just want to remember that we have a a service coming up on the 31st and I'm hoping that we don't have a lot of preaching that we just have a lot of rejoicing and uh testimonies and specials and we'll have a communion service as well. We're not aiming for it to be a watch night service where we wait till 12 midnight to have communion. We just don't do that necessarily and some people do, but I I just don't really think it's necessary. Um I know my pastor didn't either. And so I kind of I like that. We'll just get together and have a good time for those people that can. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking about it. This this service tonight is the first service that I can remember um that we've had actually on Christmas Eve and I was looking back in the calendar and the last one that happened was in 2019 and I can't remember if we had a service on Wednesday night. Does anybody remember whether we did? I don't think so. I think we uh we shut it down. I know a lot of churches did shut it down tonight and I do apologize if anybody is upset or or uncomfortable because we came to church on Wednesday, which is actually Christmas Eve. But like we said before, what else are we going to do on Christmas Eve? We'd be coming to church anyways. It's Wednesday night. I I don't know. I just thought, let's go for it. Let's have a a time of celebration, a celebration about the season. We can look at it through different lenses, through a totally different eye when we know exactly who we are according to the message of the hour. Tonight, I'm going to minister out of the message God's gifts always find their places, but I've got a few scriptures that I want to talk about as well, but I didn't send it to the brothers. Uh, so don't get nervous. It's it's out of 1963 12 uh 22. God's gifts always find their places. just talking about brother Brandham and and how he was involved with Christmas in his life and some might say well he came from the unbelievers and you know sure enough but Christmas was around in his world as well and you know in this one little quote he says see and I I know but looking back on my life and I wonder where it happened from them first little Christmases when we hang up our stockings and and mama would get we'd probably get an orange and two or three little pieces of striped candy and that was a great Christmas to us. But [clears throat] you know, kids, they look forward to them gifts and they do. That's the world that we live in. The kids do look forward to the gifts. And I know some parents probably flatly refuse to give their children gifts because that's a a pagan tradition or whatever. But you know, Brother Brandham did say it as as a believer. He said, "Don't don't don't be weird. Don't be strange in this world, right? &gt;&gt; We don't want to make our children feel uncomfortable in this world, do we? &gt;&gt; I don't think that's that's myself, my own opinion, but you know, even brother Brandham, he had gifts as a child, and brother Brandham gave his children gifts. Now, we'll go a little further and and say it this way. Brother Brandham even had a Christmas tree, but he had it for the kiddos. That's what he said. It's for the kids. Now, I'm not saying you should or you shouldn't, but what I am saying is who are you worshiping? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Who's who who who's the God that you serve? Are we are we conforming to the image of this world? Or are we actually living according to the light that we've been shown in the day in which we live? But it can be very easy to set standards and say that unless we do it this way, we're actually doing it wrong. And that is what my pastor used to call a denomination of one. We can set a standard and say that it has to be this way. And if it's not this way, then it's wrong. That's such a terrible thing to do. Just simply trust the Lord. And if somebody's doing something that makes you feel uncomfortable, maybe just go to praying for them. &gt;&gt; Just ask the Lord to either open your eyes or to open their eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you something will happen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham, he says, you know, kids, they look forward to them gifts. we find out that Christmas is mainly to the children and and they look forward to that nowadays. He says it's turned off to the children, but it really should be adults should be teaching their children what real Christmas is. And I do not believe that Christ could be born on the 25th day of de December in Judea because it's colder than it is here now. See, you know, I when I first came into the message, I started to hear this and I thought, "This is weird just hearing it carnally, &gt;&gt; but then I started to think about it. Think about the words that he's saying and and really take a look at it." And I started to say, "Wow, there could be something to this. I think it's interesting." He says, "Oh, and and how could the shepherds be keeping their flocks by night? How many sheep herders do you know around here that are out with their shepherds at night in this weather? I know guys that raise sheep. I don't know them, but I know where they are west of Claire's home where we would go and hunt. And they have sheep. And I'm pretty sure they're not out there with a staff and a and a a hoodie and a a parka and their gloves hurting their sheep in this weather. Nobody's doing that. But how could they shepherds be keeping their flocks by night? And then the taxation and everything and Mary having to come that far from way down in Bethlehem up into Judea up into Jerusalem rather for the taxation. I could hardly believe that come up I believe she come to Nazareth and so and how that could be done. It could not be done. But I believe that Christ was born in a spring because every way he was a lamb. He says, you notice he was born in a barn and not in a house. &gt;&gt; He was a lamb and born in the springtime. It's interesting to think about this. You know, I'm just going to digress a little bit. I went and did a a little uh little 10-minute study at the Trinity Lodge here right at the beginning of December. They invited me to come and so I did and I just felt led to bring this scripture here. And uh you know the what verse is it here? How the shepherds were there and the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, this is verse 10 of Luke 2. I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people. And we talked a little bit further about the scripture here, but I just thought it was wonderful because you know the angel messenger always says the same thing, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; Fear not &gt;&gt; because I bring you good tidings of great joy. And and you know, I I brought it from this context that it was it was just that it shall be to all people. And you know what that all people means? Us today even because we still fit in that category of all people. But you know I I started to talk about the birth of Jesus and how he would be wrapped in swaddling cloth and lying in a manger. And you know who talks like this now? We had a bunch of elderly people really elderly people. And there would happen to be a a a Catholic priest who was a bishop at one time and he isn't any longer. he's and uh you know the the other chaplain for the church was there and so I'm talking and of course I'm starting to feel a little bit nervous as I'm talking because I realize people are really wondering what I'm saying because I started to talk about what we know about the swaddling cloth. What is that? It's not the the fluffy kind soft nativity picture that you get painted so many times when people reenact it. The way our prophet said was that swaddling cloth was that nasty piece of material that went between the ox's yolk and the hide of the ox as he plowed the field or pulled the wagon and the sweat got absorbed into that cloth. And that was all they had in that barn to wrap that lamb. And then they took him and put him in in in the manger. The manger sounds so nice and so sweet, doesn't it? Many times you see the nativity scene and it's all so beautiful. Everyone's standing around and sure enough there's baby Jesus. He's in a soft soft manger. It was a feed trough. &gt;&gt; A trough that you would put feed in for animals. Stinking animals with flies and slobber coming off them and who knows what other bugs would be falling in there. That's what they had to put baby Jesus in. &gt;&gt; But that was our king. Amen. &gt;&gt; And no wonder Satan couldn't believe the king of glory &gt;&gt; would come down and manifest himself in a human body in a stable in a manger of hay wrapped in a swaddling cloth. But he he decided, you know what we need to do is we need to try and paint the picture in such a way that it was so beautiful. It was so soft and so kind just like the kind old priest. The picture that we're talking about tonight is the birth of Jesus. Um the shepherds, how wonderful it is to know that that everything that happens, it doesn't happen by accident. Everything happens according to God's plan. It's his business. It's his way of doing things. And uh you know another another quote out of this message, God's gifts always find their places. He says, "Now watch the gift that the wise men brought that these wise men brought or brought him." Today we find that we're swapping gifts. Everybody has to get a gift and try to figure out what the next fellow's going to give him so he can give him something comparing that much. And if it isn't, well, on the New Year's he feels he has to make it up. and everyone studying and worrying and walking the floor, the millionaires, how they're going to get by. They give so much to this one and that when it's all together wrong. It's altogether Christmas here. There's only one gift that you can give. And you know, if I had nothing else to say tonight, this would be it. There's only one gift you have to give that you can give. Excuse me. And that's yourself. &gt;&gt; Give yourself to God because God's already give to you his gift. &gt;&gt; That one lying in a manger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know for sure that we're all pretty much there. I'm sure we've we've all given ourselves to God. It's a wonderful thing to know that we've done that. But I think that sometimes we can do it even just a little more. Just a little more dedication. You know, I was thinking about the the last year, 2025, and if you look back at maybe what happened in the year and and what we've done with our life, have we have we grown or have we shrank? &gt;&gt; Have we increased or decreased? And I'm not talking about money. Don't think about money. That's got nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; This is all about the word. We're in church now. We're talking spirit. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Have we got a better relationship with God now than when we started in 2025? &gt;&gt; Because if we don't, something's wrong. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; We're either growing or we're dying. &gt;&gt; Growing or shrinking. That's the the universal law here. But there's only one gift that you can give and that is yourself. Give yourself to God because God's already given to you his gift. Just like we could say, "Lord, heal me." And he'll say, "I've already done it. &gt;&gt; I've already healed you when I took those 39 stripes. You already are healed. You just need to accept it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just need to accept the gift the way that he's given it. &gt;&gt; God's already give to you his gift. Now, there's only one thing you owe back to him. That's yourself to him. And you know, in the day in which we live, we're not just talking about saying that I believe in Jesus Christ. We cannot negate the word of a vindicated prophet and think that we're going to get the right results. &gt;&gt; We have got to come God's provided way. And if we're willing to do that, then we will get that result. And we know the the the scripture says that if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet, you will receive the prophet's reward. And what's that reward? It is to be the prophet's friend. That's what he said. And to be his friend means that we're going to be actually accounted with him as his converts when he's over there because he's going to be judged just like Paul's going to be judged and we're going to be there with him. But you know what we're talking about is this gift. The greatest gift that could ever happen was God giving himself as a human being to be sacrificed for all of our transgressions. God's greatest gift to man. What a tremendous thing it is. Let's turn over to Matthew. Matthew chapter 1. Matthew chapter 1. God's greatest gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 1. Start with verse 18. We're talking about the the greatest gift, the the reason for Christmas, the purpose of us being here even tonight. Verse 18 says, "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise, when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's so beautiful. As I was studying this, I was just having a little jubilee. Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privy. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. Now, all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord &gt;&gt; by the prophet. See, I just love that it was spoken of the Lord, was it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; By the prophet. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us." Then Joseph being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife, and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son. And they called his name Jesus. I think it's just such a beautiful thing this this whole story. I I just wanted to go through it tonight just for the sake of, you know, discussion and and celebration really. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's just such a a wonderful thing, you know, over in the uh in the book of Luke. Luke chapter 1, all about Jesus tonight. All about the story, that nativity scene. Let's paint that picture tonight. Let's let's remember what gift we've been given. Luke ver 1 verse 26. I think it's so beautiful. Why did Mary actually have Jesus? There's a reason for it. There's a reason for it. Verse 26 of Luke 1. and the sixth month. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth. I I just think it's so beautiful when you think about this. When you just stop and and think about this this there was a specific time. There was a month, a day, and a year where an angel messenger was sent from God into a city on earth. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's entirely possible that he could choose to do the exact same thing again. Isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's God. 27. To a virgin espoused to a man, whose name was Joseph of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that are highly favored, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind, what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. For thou hast found favor with God, and behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. And we know we've preached on this many, many times. That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's just as powerful tonight. I just want to have a fit when I start talking about this, when I start thinking about this because this is exactly the same thing for every single believer of the word of God for the day in which they live. Doesn't matter what day. When we can realize that an angel messenger brings a message saying you are highly favored among women. Remember women is the feminine. The feminine is the church. If you are a part of the church, you fit that feminine. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. This is the exact same formula that happens in the life of a believer. You hear the word of an angel messenger and something happens. You can choose to say, "Be it unto me according to thy word." Or you can say, "I think I'm hearing things. I think I'm thinking things." Things are just a little bit weird. We'll carry on here. Verse 32. He shall be great, and he shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end. Can you imagine that? &gt;&gt; Having an angel messenger telling you that that is who your son is going to be. Then said Mary unto the angel, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? There's no natural connection. How can this possibly happen?" And the angel answered and said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. &gt;&gt; Didn't we just say that it was the Holy Ghost that was going to overshadow her? How could it be the son of God? Wouldn't Wouldn't God be the father then? We all know this. I think it's so beautiful. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; And you know, this is the key to it all right here, brothers and sisters, even in the day in which we live. Verse 38. And Mary said, and we could just take Mary's name out without adding to or taking away. I don't want to do that. But for the sake of illustration tonight about this baby in a manger, let's talk about it and maybe just try and put your name in there when you can read this. And I like to say, "And Barry said, behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy what?" &gt;&gt; Not church, right? Not denomination, &gt;&gt; thy word. &gt;&gt; And the angel departed from her. And we know in the day in which we live, it's no different. It was the word of a prophet. &gt;&gt; God spoke through the prophet and he still does. &gt;&gt; But look at this scripture here. It's just so beautiful because we can look over go a little bit further. Uh 41 and 44. Jump down to 41. And it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, what? The babe leapt in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost and spake out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come unto me. For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leapt in my womb for joy." &gt;&gt; Speak the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see what happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. say the name Jesus and devils flee. &gt;&gt; They have got to go. &gt;&gt; And you know, I I I'm just going to jump around a little bit tonight. I hope it's okay. I don't want to keep us late, but I just wanted to try and illustrate the picture of Jesus coming to this earth, knowing that Jesus coming to this earth was nothing other than the word of a vindicated prophet. because it was the word of a prophet. A human being heard that word and knew somewhere somehow there had to be a fulfillment of that word. And there was a time that came by an angel messenger that said, "You're the one." And it's no different to every single human being that lives on earth. There comes a time where we reach that crossroad like we've talked about where we've got to say that's either going to be me or it's not going to be me. But when it is me, I give myself wholly over to it just like Mary did. And then there's something holy that comes to life inside of me. &gt;&gt; There's a babe that comes to life that leaps in the womb of my heart in my soul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; At the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the scripture is always based on something already spoken by a prophet. And we could turn over to Isaiah 7, but we don't need to. For the sake of discussion tonight, I'll just read it. Isaiah 7. Isaiah was around about 700 years prior to this. Sometimes in our lives, we can think about the scriptures and the and the prophecies and how things can be spoken by a vindicated prophet and maybe they just haven't happened in a timely fashion. Well, what's a timely fashion? &gt;&gt; We're talking about God's timetable here. 700 years it took for Isaiah's words. We heard I don't know who it was that said it. The words keep going around and around and around and around the earth, right? Keep traveling around the earth. The words don't stop. They keep going around and around and around looking for that one person, for that one womb to land on. And boy, when that womb comes up in the age in which they live, something takes place. And we know that's what happened in the case of Mary. She was the one that was to catch that word in her day. 700 years later after the prophet Isaiah in chapter 7:14, therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign, behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and call his name Emmanuel, being interpreted, God with us, &gt;&gt; as we just heard. So, you know, brothers and sisters, what I want to get to today is just jump right into the punchline and just maybe punch at it a few times if that's okay. The manger today, it's not at the Catholic church down on the corner. It's not on the little display that we might set up in the corner of our house. It's not somewhere out there that we can possibly put together. That manger is right here. It's that little tiny spot that God made in the heart of every single human being that no other creature on earth has. That little spot that he created for himself. And you know, many times I can't I can't I can't I can't dispute it. Looking at it the way it was in my life, I'll just use my life for an example. It was no different than that stinky barn. It was no different than that that swaddling cloth or that that manger. It was absolutely no different than all that dung manure that was all over the floor. The smells that must have been in that barn. That was what this was right here. But it doesn't matter. He knows exactly where he wants to go. And he's going to go where he wants to go. All he's going to do is invite. He's going to give the invitation. And if we're like Mary and say, "Behold, &gt;&gt; the handmade of the Lord, just be it unto me according to thy word." And that's the critical factor I believe. I'm sure we all do. It's got to be according to the word, right? And if we can accept that gift today, then we have a nativity scene in our life every day we live because it's not actually looking back. It's looking right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not looking back. We're not looking forward. Even though we like to do both, we're not ignoring what's taking place right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that's why all of us have the desire to gather together in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; But you know, his gift today is wrapped in his word. &gt;&gt; And if we want to see where it's at, we just got to open it up. We've got to pull back the pages. We've got to pull back the wrapping of the word and see if he won't reveal himself to us. &gt;&gt; And I want to encourage us tonight, brothers and sisters. Maybe let's unwrap that present. Let's unwrap that gift just a little more than we ever have. You know how kids get excited about presents. Even adults do sometimes. If you've ever had a present for your birthday or or for Christmas or for whatever, we get excited about tearing that paper off so we can get in there, dig in there, and see what's there. It's the same thing for the word in the day in which we live. If we can do that, you know, I can testify that when we do that, there's so much in there that that will change our life forever. &gt;&gt; You know, many times we can think if I could just open up a box and and have a million dollars inside of it, it would change my life forever. It would just change my life. And you know, maybe it would, but likely what it would do is change our life for the worse, &gt;&gt; not the better. Sometimes you can actually take money and think you're going to help people &gt;&gt; and it doesn't help them. It hurts them. &gt;&gt; It's shocking, but it's true. &gt;&gt; Money is not always a blessing. It's not a way to measure. It's not the measuring stick of God's blessing in our lives. &gt;&gt; Because the love of money is the root of all evil. &gt;&gt; And it's weird because there's no other love of anything else that has to do with evil. It's the love of money. &gt;&gt; But if we got a box with a million dollars in it, I'll tell you what, if I knew that's what was in there and somebody gave it to me, I would tear that paper off. I would rip it off and I would dig in and I would get that million dollars out. And I would take some time and think about what I was going to do with it. But you know, that million dollars would just in this world would just be gone. Some people would invest it. You could invest it and maybe make 2 million. But then what what happens with money is it's never enough. &gt;&gt; You always want more. &gt;&gt; But I think it's beautiful because the same the same I'll say curse the opposite to it is the blessing of the desire of the word of God. When we dig into the word of God, we can't get enough. We desire more and more. And that's the gift that he's given to us in the day in which we live. It's not just a book. And you know, when we look at the message, it's not just books and tapes. It's not just an MP3 player. It's not just an app on our phone. It's literally the life of Jesus Christ revealing himself to us in the age in which we live. &gt;&gt; And the more we listen, the more we become just like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage us, brothers and sisters, to unwrap this present tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just unwrap it maybe in a little a little different way than maybe we ever have. Maybe just look at it from a little bit of a different perspective. Remember we were talking about perspective. My there's so much that we could get into about perspective. &gt;&gt; Another quote out of this message, God's gifts always find their places. He says, "Now how fitting these gifts was to Christ's journey on earth, a baby born here on earth." And you know, we talked briefly. I apologize. I jump around sometimes about the the the wise men coming in and I think it's such an amazing thing. I remember brother Ken said this and I had never heard it before and I thought, "Are you sure?" I had to go back and fact check. Go f Go fact check. I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Fact check by the word. By the word. Don't fact check by Google, Chat GPT, or Grock. They're liars. How are they liars? They're not from God, are they? &gt;&gt; They're from the tree of knowledge of what? &gt;&gt; Good and evil. They're not from the tree of life. There's only one tree of life, and this is it right here. Fact check it right here. But, Brother Ken, he said it the first time I heard it. I know, brother says it, too. There wasn't three wise men. Was there three wise men? The Bible doesn't say there was three wise men. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Bible doesn't say that. The Bible says that there was three gifts, &gt;&gt; but not that there was three wise men. But when you talk about all of the stuff, Brother Brandham, in this message, he really nails it. They say that the the wise men came and found them with the baby in the manger and they found him wrapped in swaddling clothes just after he was born. But if you look at the scripture, if you really look at the scripture and fact check that, you'll see that that baby was 2 years and under because Herod found out that there was a promise according to prophecy that was going to happen in this land. there was going to be a Messiah, a deliverer, a king. And Herod in all of his insecurities couldn't stand that. So what did he do? He did the same thing. The same spirit anointed him that anointed Pharaoh back in Egypt and said, "All the children, boys two years and under, slaughter them." &gt;&gt; And we know, brother Bradom, he says it in this message, too, that uh that was the scripture that was fulfilled about how the children were taken and and Rachel just couldn't be comforted. She couldn't be comforted from the the weeping. But you know the wise men, there was wise men. They came, but it wasn't exactly the way the world portrays it. They weren't there standing there in the manger in the manure. They came two years later. And we know that story talks about the wise men coming to Herod saying, "Where's this king?" Can you imagine how Herod must have been upset? He was so insecure. What? You're the magi? You came and now you're saying, "Where's the king? I'm the king." Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And [clears throat] they realized, man, this is weird. So then he said, "You know what? Just relax. If you go find him, come back and tell me. I'd like to come worship him, too." And they were like, "Yeah, okay. You're weird. See you." And they left, right? And they never went back to him. They went and found him. They presented their gifts, three gifts. And boy, we could talk about those and and maybe we will a little bit, but you know, the the way the story is construed by the world today, and we know it's the devil that does it, but the way it's done isn't necessarily according to the word. And that's why we have got to be willing to fact check ourselves in the word. And even myself, if I'm wrong, I'm going to say, "Amen. I'm wrong." It's got to be according to the word of God. That's our absolute. That's our benchmark. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says here how fitting these gifts was to Christ's journey on earth. A baby born here on earth. And these gifts that the wise men brought him fitted just exactly his commission from God and his journey on earth. Now the first thing, God. This was God. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; This was God. This isn't the second or third person in some Godhead. This was God. Jesus was God in the form of man. &gt;&gt; That's hard for people to swallow that even today. How can you get around the word of a vindicated prophet saying that &gt;&gt; is beyond me. Then he was God. He says and that's what he was. He wasn't nothing less than God. He was God manifested in the flesh. And we could jump over for the sake of time. We won't tonight. But if we read John, St. John chapter 1, he explains who this was. He was the creator in his own creation. I love this. This is why I'm saying it because this is where I I live. I love to preach. This is what I believe for all of us brothers and sisters. He was God manifested in the flesh. The more we take this word of the vindicated prophet and we eat it, the more we eat it, the more we learn it, the more we study it, the more we become it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The more we become God manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; But it takes a sacrifice. It takes a commitment. It takes a willingness to die out to ourselves. &gt;&gt; He was the creator in his own creation. He was the creator in his creation. By the creation for the creation. He was the creator in his creation by his creation for his creation. I just think it sounds so simple and sometimes it is. It's God. He hides himself in simplicity &gt;&gt; and he reveals himself in what? &gt;&gt; In the same. &gt;&gt; It's exactly the way he is. Exactly how he does it. &gt;&gt; There were so many places I wanted to get into tonight. jumping around all over the place. I'm just going to stick with the quotes here and we'll just see what the Lord will do. The next one is notice when Jesus created bread, he took a piece of bread and he created bread that had already been bred. When he created fish, he took a fish that was first created a fish and put another fish out of it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? What I want to do tonight, brothers and sisters, is take Jesus Christ, who was born in a manger 2,000 years ago, and let's bring him right up out of all of the history and make him Jesus Christ born in 2025 in the hearts of his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He took a fish that was created a fish and put another fish out of it. Is that right? He took water, which potentially would have become wine, and made wine out of it. Is that right? It's interesting how he says that which potentially would have become wine. How would that have happened? That would have been a long process, wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; That water would have to go maybe into the clouds, maybe from the clouds in rain into the dirt to hit a seed to actually cause the seed to come to life. and and then that water would get inside that seed and the life would start to absorb the water every time it came and then it would go into grapes and those grapes would have to be matured and picked. It would take a long time. I love how he says this. He took water which potentially would have become wine and made wine out of it. Is that right? &gt;&gt; The creator creating himself in his own creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just magnificent when you think about it. He goes on to say, "But we've seen him in our midst in this last days create things right out without anything standing there." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, some people will say, "Well, it gets a bit crazy when you start talking like this." And I'll tell you what, I I bet you every single person that left that wedding that night that talked about how the governor saved the best wine for the last and then they find out, wait a second, he ran out of wine. They didn't even have wine. &gt;&gt; They were out of wine. But this one man, &gt;&gt; somehow he actually was able to change these water buckets into wine. The best wine they've ever tasted. &gt;&gt; They'll probably say, "Yeah, right. You're crazy. Sure. And what significance would that have anyways? They just needed more wine. Somebody probably paid somebody to come in and they did a some sort of a thing, right? You know, people will talk that way when you start talking squirrels. &gt;&gt; Why would God create a squirrel? &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want nothing to do with that. WHY WOULD WHY WOULD GOD create a squirrel? What significance does it have? Just just enough significance so that it would happen. And then we would say, "Wow, I have an opportunity to either say I believe that or I don't." &gt;&gt; That's why &gt;&gt; because you know the third pull isn't going to be a public show. &gt;&gt; It's only going to be for a very select group of people which is going to be the greatest gift that we could ever see in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; But I love how he says this. He created the the bread and he created the fish and he created the wine. He says, "Is that right to create a squirrel where there is no squirrels?" Right? Oh, he remains God. And you know, brothers and sisters, I want to say this. I've been pondering this for a long time. And I think it was exactly for this one purpose. And and just to start the purpose, not for that individual purpose, but to actually start the purpose and show how real it actually is for those people that can believe. That is the squirrels. God maybe took the squirrels and used the squirrels for the purpose of this one conversation sitting around eating cherry cobbler drinking coffee acting like human beings maybe after a group of services just some poor regular folks right talking about squirrels being created AND ONE PERSON ONE PERSON HAD the audacity to say brother Brandham I think that's exactly right &gt;&gt; then what happened &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said you never pleased me He said, "You pleased the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; YOU SAID THE RIGHT THING." &gt;&gt; I want to say this. In the day in which we live, brothers and sisters, what do we say? &gt;&gt; What do we say when we think squirrels? &gt;&gt; We don't have to understand it. We don't have to explain it. We just either HAVE TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT believe it. And we have that choice. &gt;&gt; But if it worked for Hadtie, right? &gt;&gt; What ought it to do for us? Where are we with that tonight? &gt;&gt; If we want to see if God is God, ask him. &gt;&gt; If you're God, make yourself God to me. Let me see you in this day in which we live. Oh, I don't want to hear about my dad. I don't want to hear about my mom. I don't want to hear about all the other people's experiences. Make it real to me. Come and be alive. Take up your boat in the manger in my heart and show me that you're God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he says, "Is that right to create a squirrel where there is no squirrels?" Oh my. He remains God. He's just as much deity today as he was then and ever was or ever will be. Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Either he is or he isn't. &gt;&gt; He's still God. &gt;&gt; And challenging hearts to believe it. greater things than this. &gt;&gt; Without anything to hold and break off, speak it and it'll be so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, we're living in a different age than any other age. We're living in the culmination of all the ages. Just like the children of Israel coming to that promised land, camped on this side Jordan, they knew that one of these days we're going to have to cross over and we're going to be in our promised land. Now, some are saying, "Well, Brother Barry, we're already in our promised land. We got the Holy Ghost." That Holy Ghost is going to take you to another land. And without that Holy Ghost, you ain't going. You got to make sure that you're ready to go. And that's the day in which we live. Say the right thing, brothers and sisters. Even if you don't understand it, say the right thing, brothers and sisters. Even if your brother or sister upsets you, say the right things, brothers and sisters, and please the Holy Ghost. Don't worry about pleasing anybody else. &gt;&gt; Carrying on in this message, he says, notice now we find that he identified the works that he did. Identified that he was deity. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you that he will identify himself as deity in your life, in your home if you ask him. &gt;&gt; He was deity. Showed that he was. For he said, "If I do not the works of my father, then don't believe me." But goodness sakes, how many people in this building here tonight and and you can show with hands or not or whether you're watching or not, but how many people have asked God to express himself as deity to to show yourself that you're God in our life because of whatever our need is and he hasn't come on the scene. &gt;&gt; Anybody can say God has not been deity. He hasn't actually shown himself to be deity. My but the problem is I think many people just don't ask them. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I think it's a little bit like this. You know, we've heard it said in the past and I I I believe it myself. I wouldn't mess with it. You got two people kind of like the women. One woman lost her baby. The other one had her baby. the one who lost her baby stole the other woman's baby. Remember, they went to Solomon and said, "You know, she stole my baby." And he said, "Don't worry about it. Just bring me a sword. We'll just cut the two cut the baby in half and we'll just give each a half." And you know that wisdom, I I think it's on the same wise. You get two people that are at odds and one person's lying and you know, one person's lying. Let's come and stand before God. No, better yet. Let's kneel before God right before the altar and ask him as deity, as God, &gt;&gt; strike the liar dead, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If I'm lying before you, God, then strike me dead. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If he's God, I I wouldn't fool with that. &gt;&gt; Just like the brothers that wanted to challenge Brother Brandham, on the on the doctrine of water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the city of Chicago, &gt;&gt; right? nobody would COME AND GET BESIDE HIM. We heard this said recently. The reason for it is because the spirits that were anointing those boys knew that they were coming in the spirit. They were coming in the atmosphere in the presence of deity. Not just with William Brham. But the angel, the presence of the Lord meant death. And some people would say, well, how can you prove it? Nope, I can't. &gt;&gt; I just believe it, that's all. &gt;&gt; He was deity. showed that he was for he said if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me and and could not the Christian say today if I do not the works of my savior believe me not see I'll call the musicians saying this for a reason brothers and sisters I believe he's calling us to the highest level a Christian has ever been called to on this earth &gt;&gt; if we've been given the entire open book &gt;&gt; all of the seals open the fullness of the word in the day in which we live. Could not the Christian say today, if I do not the works of my savior, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Believe me not. &gt;&gt; I believe this with all my heart, brothers and sisters. If we can't say that, then we're just we're just acting Christian. &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying that in a way that I want to try and and scare us or scold us and make us feel like we're not doing anything right. I want to say just keep going, just keep pressing on, but remember there's something greater in store for you if you're willing to surrender fully to the word of God. He goes on to say, as the father sent me, so send I you. And if you do the works, creation works of the father that sent him, then it's a creation. The Christ, the creator that sends us does the works of Christ the creator. See, now I'm not saying let's go out and create. Let's go out and and do some funny business. Let's go and show. Remember, there's there's accounts of it in in the New Testament. People wanting to make a show of the of the spirit of Christ, of of the living God. People wanting to actually do that. I'm not saying that at all. But what I am saying is get yourself into a position where you know that you know where you can actually take the mantle of this word when you need it and you can strike the waters that are in your way and say, "Where is the God of Elijah for me?" &gt;&gt; We need to know where we're at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the Christian today has got to do the life that Christ did or we have the right to say it's not so. I'll tell you, when you have the hour of need, put it to the test and see if he's not God. &gt;&gt; We could go on and on. If you want to stand with me, we'll close tonight. I just want to say, brothers and sisters, God bless you. Merry Christmas. I think it's a wonderful thing. I had someone send me this quote today. And and in closing, [music] I I just thought it was so beautiful. She had no idea that I was studying from this message. This is from this message 63 12:22. God's gifts always find their places. [music] This is brother Brandham here and and I just want to say it exactly the same way that he said it. I'm not going to change one word. He says, "Now, if you'll bow your heads again, I want to wish each one of you a very merry Christmas. May the great Christmas present, the first one and the only and the original and the only one there is, Jesus Christ, be areshed in your heart tonight. May the Holy Spirit come to you and bring you ministering gifts and things from God that you a gift that you might live a better life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can testify brothers and sisters just by accepting this word in its fullness and saying I don't understand it. I can't I can't explain it. I don't understand why people behave the way they behave, but there's something about it that just attracts me. &gt;&gt; It will change your life. You live a better life. May the Holy Spirit come to you and bring you ministering gifts and things from God. A gift that you might live a better life. He says, "That's what I want. I would rather have the life of Christ in me to live sweet and victorious. Remember, we've been talking about gifts on Wednesdays. Sweet [snorts] and victorious than I would all the gifts of healing, the gifts of prophecies, all them other gifts. Just give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let me live the life. The life is what I want to live. I want to live so others will know. [music] &gt;&gt; And you know, brothers and sisters, that is the testimony of Jesus Christ, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The life that we live every single day that we interact in this world. That is the spirit of prophecy. That's that's prophetic utterance coming from our lives, not even our words. He says, "I want to live so others will know." That's my desire at Christmas. And I pray that's your desire. And I pray that God will give us his desire. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow. [music] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word. We thank you, Lord, that you chose to express yourself the way you did to this world. Father, we thank you that Lord 2,000 years ago, the manifestation of the prophetic utterance that came 700 years earlier manifested. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And there's still a prophecy that's coming to this world that in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, oh Father, there's going to be a rapture. There's going to be a change of our bodies. There's going to be those that come out of the grave. Oh, Father, we're going to meet with them as we meet with you in the clouds. We know that prophecy is imminent. That has to come to pass. And we are that generation that you've chosen, Lord. Father, if we can't be in it, we can see that it is so close. Either way, we thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you for the gift wrapped word that you've given us in the day in which we live. Help us, Lord, to unwrap it and to take [music] it into our lives, into our hearts, Father, that it would be the greatest gift that we could ever have, but Lord, not just keep for ourselves, but that we could share it with others, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we could give this gift to the rest of the people that we know in this world, that they would see you alive and well again. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray for each one who's come to service tonight that you would bless them abundantly, Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that you would just, Lord, bless them so well. Father, those who are tuning in wherever they are, Father, minister to them even now. Lord, let your spirit just stick with us tonight as we go our separate ways. Father, help us to consider all that you've done for us. All that you're going to do, but Lord, most of all, that which you are doing right now. Help us to see it. Help us to perceive what you're doing in our lives. And Father, we'll be careful to give you the praise. We pray that you would be with those who are traveling, Father, wherever they are, whatever they're doing. Lord, keep your hand upon them. Keep them safe. Give them traveling mercies. We ask. And if it be your will for us to gather again on Sunday, Lord, [music] we will. We'll bring a song in our heart. Father, we'll bring a shout in the camp. We love you and we thank you for all that you've done for us, Lord. [music] We just ask all these things. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that song? I love him. I love him. Oh, I love him. [singing] him. I love him [music] because [singing] he first loved me [singing] and purchase my salvation. on Calary [singing and music] tree. I love him. Do you love him tonight? Oh, I love [singing] him.
