[0:00] Amen. Beautiful.
[0:04] After Friday night's service, I was just
[0:06] so inspired and so encouraged that on my
[0:09] way home, I messaged brother Paul. I'm
[0:11] like, "Brother Paul, I have to do a
[0:12] special on Sunday." So, this is a word
[0:14] of encouragement for you.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; This poem is called Born to Overcome.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; I think this is something that we always
[0:24] need to remember and focus on. Before
[0:27] the dawn had kissed the world, before
[0:30] the stars took flame, he knew your
[0:32] heart. He called your soul. He spoke and
[0:36] wrote your name.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; His word was planted deep within
[0:41] his life. Your living some. You always
[0:44] was. You always are. A child born to
[0:48] overcome.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; It's to overcome all of the struggles
[0:54] and trials of this life. Amen.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; And you can do it.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; Just surrender to him.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; When you first breathed that newborn air
[1:03] and learned to walk and fall, his hand
[1:06] was near.
[1:08] Though you knew not the one who guided
[1:11] all through childhood dreams and
[1:14] wandering steps, his light would softly
[1:16] come. For deep within, the seed
[1:19] declared,
[1:21] "You're born to overcome.
[1:24] You chased the world. You played its
[1:27] games. You sought its fleeting prize.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; But mercy found you
[1:33] &gt;&gt; where you fell and opened up your eyes.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Though you were lost in shadows hold,
[1:41] his purpose still would run. For what
[1:43] was swn before all time must rise to
[1:46] overcome.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; In youth you stumbled, failed, and wept.
[1:52] Your pride would rise and fade.
[1:55] Yet every fall just proved again the
[1:58] work his hand has made.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; For even when you turned away and
[2:03] doubted what he done, the seed of God
[2:05] within your soul was growing to
[2:08] overcome.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Then grace revealed the cross to you.
[2:13] Our savior's crimson plan. The word made
[2:16] flesh the spotless lamb. The sun became
[2:19] your stand.
[2:20] And when you saw his victory through
[2:23] blood and spirit won, you knew
[2:26] &gt;&gt; that you're chosen by him
[2:28] &gt;&gt; and born to overcome.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; Now daily life becomes our ground where
[2:34] faith and patience grow and quiet work
[2:37] in simple ways. This kingdom starts to
[2:40] show. Each choice we make, each word we
[2:44] speak, each battle faced and won reveals
[2:48] the life that's in the seed.
[2:50] The life that overcomes.
[2:54] No storm can shake what God has swn. No
[2:57] trial turns us back. For every test just
[3:01] proves his strength and keeps us on the
[3:04] tracks. The spirit leads through calm
[3:07] and flame till all his will be done. And
[3:10] we reflect our father's life. His nature
[3:14] overcomes.
[3:16] So we will praise him all our days
[3:18] &gt;&gt; through fire, joy, and rain.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; For we were his before the world
[3:23] &gt;&gt; and ever shall remain.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; The seed he spoke before all time
[3:30] will shine like morning sun. For we are
[3:33] born of God himself
[3:35] &gt;&gt; and here to overcome.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Lord bless you all.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; [applause]
