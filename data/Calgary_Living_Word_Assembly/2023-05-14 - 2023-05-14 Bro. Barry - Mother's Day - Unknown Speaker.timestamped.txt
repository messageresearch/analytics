[1:02:02] God bless you this morning thank you
[1:02:04] musicians
[1:02:05] do you have your Bibles this morning
[1:02:07] I would just like to read a
[1:02:10] couple of scriptures
[1:02:14] started in Matthew chapter 6.
[1:02:23] Matthew chapter 6.
[1:02:45] you have it say Amen this morning
[1:02:53] and I'd like to read from First
[1:02:55] Corinthians
[1:03:00] First Corinthians chapter 2.
[1:03:03] Matthew chapter 6 verse 43.
[1:03:11] says ye have heard
[1:03:13] that it hath been said Thou shalt Love
[1:03:15] Thy Neighbor
[1:03:16] and hate thine enemy
[1:03:19] but I say unto you love your enemies
[1:03:20] bless them that curse you
[1:03:22] do good to them that hate you
[1:03:25] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:03:27] you and persecute you
[1:03:30] that you might be the children of your
[1:03:32] father which is in heaven
[1:03:34] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[1:03:37] evil and on the good
[1:03:40] and sendeth rain on the just and the
[1:03:42] unjust
[1:03:43] for if you love them which love you
[1:03:46] what reward have you
[1:03:48] you're not even Republicans the same
[1:03:53] and if ye salute your brethren only
[1:03:56] what do ye more than others
[1:03:59] do not even the public and so
[1:04:03] be ye therefore perfect
[1:04:05] even as your father in Heaven which is
[1:04:08] in heaven is perfect
[1:04:10] turn over to
[1:04:13] First Corinthians chapter 2.
[1:04:23] very familiar scripture
[1:04:27] First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 9.
[1:04:33] but as it is written
[1:04:35] I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[1:04:39] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:04:40] man
[1:04:42] the thing things which God hath prepared
[1:04:45] for them that love him
[1:04:49] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[1:04:52] his spirit
[1:04:54] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[1:04:57] the Deep things of God
[1:05:00] is bow in prayer one more time
[1:05:02] Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you
[1:05:04] for your word
[1:05:06] thank you for the opportunity to gather
[1:05:08] together again one more time lord around

[1:05:14] on print
[1:05:15] but we want the word father that's been
[1:05:17] revealed to us Lord by your spirit
[1:05:20] and we know that it will be your word
[1:05:22] revealed by the spirit because it will
[1:05:25] always point to your word father it
[1:05:27] won't lead us in another Direction so
[1:05:30] father this morning we pray that you
[1:05:31] would just break this bread of life to
[1:05:33] us fresh once again Lord
[1:05:35] revealed to us father a little more
[1:05:38] about ourselves father and thereby

[1:05:46] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:05:49] God bless you this morning you may be
[1:05:51] seated
[1:05:55] it's uh a wonderful time here and
[1:06:00] a wonderful day
[1:06:01] it's nice to see the Green Grass and the
[1:06:04] birds
[1:06:05] certainly
[1:06:06] plan to wish the mothers a happy
[1:06:09] Mother's Day I just wanted to wait till
[1:06:11] we got a little ways into the service
[1:06:12] for that
[1:06:14] just want to say God bless you mothers
[1:06:16] amen don't be bashful
[1:06:21] give them a hand
[1:06:24] they have done something Wonderful by
[1:06:26] giving birth to children
[1:06:29] and not just giving birth to children
[1:06:30] but by raising children by encouraging
[1:06:33] children by training them up in the way
[1:06:35] they should go
[1:06:37] by being the pastors of the home
[1:06:40] by being the ones that pick up the slack
[1:06:43] they fill in the blanks they do all the
[1:06:47] little things that the dads don't
[1:06:49] many times the kids don't
[1:06:52] so many things the moms do and you know
[1:06:56] many times there isn't a big thank you
[1:06:58] for it
[1:06:59] and uh the world has it such that
[1:07:02] there's many different Mother's Days
[1:07:03] around the world in many different
[1:07:05] countries and you know this is just sort
[1:07:09] of the country that we live in North
[1:07:10] America celebrates this day and we know
[1:07:14] that it's not really a religious holiday
[1:07:16] it's not a religious day that's
[1:07:18] recognized that way and we don't want to
[1:07:21] make it anything other than it is just a
[1:07:23] day that we can say thank you to our
[1:07:25] moms but I I want to say this just like
[1:07:29] uh birthdays or or
[1:07:32] special days in our lives we don't want
[1:07:35] to wait for one day out of the year to
[1:07:37] say thank you for things that are done
[1:07:38] for us we want to remember our moms
[1:07:41] every single day we want to remember our
[1:07:43] wives every single day our husbands our
[1:07:46] parents we want to give thanks to the
[1:07:48] Lord every single day of Our Lives if we
[1:07:51] just waited for one day out of the year
[1:07:53] to do that it wouldn't be much of a
[1:07:55] relationship so God bless you moms
[1:07:58] certainly hope that Lord the Lord
[1:08:00] blesses you today and every day
[1:08:02] and uh
[1:08:04] yeah I hope you have a wonderful day
[1:08:06] today
[1:08:07] a little bit of a
[1:08:09] a break from our traditional I guess
[1:08:11] teaching today I just wanted to go a
[1:08:13] little bit of a different direction I
[1:08:15] believe
[1:08:16] the Lord led me down a road here before
[1:08:18] we get too far with that we just have a
[1:08:19] few announcements
[1:08:21] um we had the gym night on Friday night
[1:08:22] it was such a wonderful time thank you
[1:08:25] sister Shelly for putting that together
[1:08:26] for us initially we had thought that Jim
[1:08:29] was a little bit small because it was
[1:08:30] the auxiliary gym but it turned out to
[1:08:32] be just perfect because that gym was
[1:08:34] right beside the field and it was one of
[1:08:36] the most beautiful evenings that I think
[1:08:39] we've had so far this year and we played
[1:08:41] in the gym and we played outside of the
[1:08:43] gym and it was just a wonderful time for
[1:08:45] all so
[1:08:46] thank you
[1:08:48] I guess the ladies brunch yesterday was
[1:08:50] good that's the report I I had and we're
[1:08:53] certainly thankful for that
[1:08:55] um just want to make it very clear to
[1:08:57] anyone who maybe wasn't a part of it or
[1:08:59] even those who were a part of it if
[1:09:00] there's any question about it it's all
[1:09:02] based on scripture it's not a tradition
[1:09:05] we're not trying to bring something
[1:09:06] funny around the message of the hour
[1:09:08] we're not trying to bring in a program
[1:09:09] or something where we're going to be
[1:09:11] trading our power for a program that's
[1:09:14] that's rubbish if that's what somebody
[1:09:16] is thinking or if somebody has said that
[1:09:18] that's not at all what it is it's
[1:09:19] according to scripture and if you would
[1:09:20] like to talk about it we certainly could
[1:09:22] but I believe it was a wonderful time
[1:09:24] and uh you know it's just going to help
[1:09:26] the body and I think that this body that
[1:09:30] we live in the body that we have of
[1:09:31] Believers we we need each other that's
[1:09:34] why we gather together and and sometimes
[1:09:37] one part of the body has a little bit
[1:09:38] more information about another part of
[1:09:40] the body and we can share that
[1:09:42] information to the other part of the
[1:09:43] body and thereby help that part of the
[1:09:45] body if if we just Reserve information
[1:09:48] and and everything is fine for us but
[1:09:51] our brother is suffering what good are
[1:09:53] we for the body we need to be able to
[1:09:55] help one another
[1:09:56] and the word is very clear on the
[1:09:58] sisters doing so so God bless you each
[1:10:00] one for taking part in that
[1:10:03] um we just wanted to mention that we're
[1:10:04] going to have the vote for the church
[1:10:05] offices it will be the week of the 21st
[1:10:07] to the 22nd and announced on the 28th
[1:10:11] um again the requirements for voting uh

[1:10:54] um certainly thank each one for your
[1:10:56] efforts again there's a lot of things
[1:10:58] that happen behind the scenes that we
[1:11:00] don't see that we're not aware of that
[1:11:02] just get looked after and we certainly
[1:11:05] are thankful for each one being in their

[1:11:14] coming up we have a potluck at our house

[1:11:43] established just yet but once we do we
[1:11:46] will confirm the dates with you we have

[1:12:04] have brother James new Vanda Bandy
[1:12:06] coming September 27th he's going to do
[1:12:09] kind of a Western Canadian visitation so
[1:12:13] we had uh had the occasion to have him
[1:12:16] here so that's a Wednesday night as well
[1:12:18] are you happy this morning
[1:12:22] this morning in our scripture we uh we
[1:12:24] talked about from
[1:12:27] from Matthew chapter six I think it's
[1:12:31] such a beautiful topic and uh certainly
[1:12:35] wonderful to just see the word of the
[1:12:37] Lord and and how he he talks to his
[1:12:40] disciples and and explains to the people
[1:12:43] when when Jesus I just can't help but
[1:12:45] think this is Jesus having a church
[1:12:47] service and explaining to the people in
[1:12:50] verse 43 of Matthew chapter 5.
[1:12:53] you know he says have you heard that
[1:12:56] they that it hath been said Thou shalt
[1:12:59] love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy
[1:13:01] but I say unto you love your enemies
[1:13:03] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:13:06] them that hate you
[1:13:07] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:13:10] you and persecute you
[1:13:12] why would we do that in in verse 45 he
[1:13:16] explains that answer he answers that
[1:13:18] question that you may be the children of
[1:13:20] your father which is in heaven
[1:13:24] so how do we be our the children of Our
[1:13:27] Father which is in heaven how do we
[1:13:28] express that life
[1:13:31] we forgive those
[1:13:33] we don't we don't hold things against
[1:13:35] people
[1:13:36] we understand that our enemies are our
[1:13:38] people that you know brother Branham
[1:13:40] said it very clearly we would never we
[1:13:41] wouldn't wish it on our worst enemy to
[1:13:43] go to that place called hell
[1:13:45] and you know that's one of the things
[1:13:46] that just flies off the lips of people
[1:13:48] they just tell people to go there
[1:13:50] it just is commonplace in the world they
[1:13:53] say it all the time
[1:13:54] just like they take the name of our dear
[1:13:56] Lord in vain all the time
[1:13:59] what a tremendous thing that is terrible
[1:14:02] thing but people do it all of the time
[1:14:04] and they don't recognize that it's not
[1:14:05] the people doing it it's the evil spirit
[1:14:07] that's in them or the evil spirits
[1:14:10] sometimes it's a plethora of evil that's
[1:14:12] inside people and they'll put on a tie
[1:14:14] in a suit and and be polished up as as
[1:14:17] all get out but just as insane and crazy
[1:14:19] as maybe a Madman in another continent
[1:14:22] and you know I remember it with brother
[1:14:24] Gilbert when we were there in Kenya and
[1:14:26] and one time after a service we were
[1:14:28] driving down the road and he pointed out
[1:14:30] a man I didn't even see him because
[1:14:32] there's so many people everywhere but I
[1:14:33] didn't see this one in particular man
[1:14:35] and brother Gilbert said see that that's
[1:14:37] a Madman right there and and and he was
[1:14:39] you could tell just by seeing when I was
[1:14:42] able to perceive this man he had
[1:14:45] all the signs of someone that was
[1:14:47] completely out of his mind
[1:14:49] and you know we can see it here in
[1:14:50] Calgary too
[1:14:52] um doesn't take long yesterday we were
[1:14:54] up in the area where I was raised and
[1:14:57] there was people that were just like
[1:14:59] that right there and I thought my
[1:15:00] goodness look at these people but these
[1:15:03] are the ones that we're supposed to love
[1:15:04] brothers and sisters
[1:15:06] these are the ones that would
[1:15:08] despitefully use us if they could and
[1:15:11] what does the word say we're supposed to
[1:15:12] bless those people
[1:15:14] how much more are brothers and our
[1:15:16] sisters
[1:15:17] I don't think this gives us any room to
[1:15:19] say oh I don't believe the way they
[1:15:21] I don't I can't go to that church
[1:15:23] because of the way they do whatever they
[1:15:24] do that that is that anything to do with
[1:15:27] this
[1:15:29] I don't know
[1:15:30] verse 45 that you may be the children of
[1:15:32] your father which is in heaven for we
[1:15:34] maketh the sun to rise on the evil they
[1:15:37] get the sunshine too they get the
[1:15:38] nutrients of the sun they get the
[1:15:40] vitamin D
[1:15:41] they get the blessing of the age
[1:15:45] but they also get the curse of the age
[1:15:47] too if they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:49] Inside of them if they don't have that
[1:15:51] sea Gene of God inside of them that same
[1:15:53] Sun is going to rise on them is going to
[1:15:55] cause that seed to actually come to life
[1:15:58] and they're going to manifest the life
[1:16:00] that's inside of them
[1:16:02] because of the anointing of this age
[1:16:04] they don't recognize it that it's not
[1:16:06] just the s-u-n that Rose in this age
[1:16:08] it's the s-o-n and this word is going to
[1:16:12] cause people to behave in a certain way
[1:16:14] but it will rise on the evil and the
[1:16:17] good
[1:16:18] both of them get it they get the benefit
[1:16:20] of it and sendeth the Reign on the just
[1:16:22] and the unjust
[1:16:24] my goodness so many times in my life I
[1:16:27] would look at people who would just do
[1:16:29] things to me terrible things to me in
[1:16:31] particular and say Lord curse them I I
[1:16:34] would just like to see something happen
[1:16:36] in their life
[1:16:37] oh my now I can step back with a little
[1:16:40] tiny bit more maturity I wouldn't say a
[1:16:42] lot because I'm still a child here on
[1:16:45] Earth and I got a long ways to go to be
[1:16:47] perfect as the word says in my own mind
[1:16:52] but I'm so thankful that the Lord hadn't
[1:16:54] cursed those people that I had said that
[1:16:56] imagine in our lives if we did live in
[1:17:00] that emotional realm where our emotions
[1:17:01] could just take control and if we got
[1:17:04] angry one day upset with someone they're
[1:17:06] our friend one day and they said
[1:17:07] something to hurt us and now they're our
[1:17:09] enemy the next day we're blessed them
[1:17:11] today and cursing them tomorrow
[1:17:14] it'd be a terrible place
[1:17:17] but here we have Jesus
[1:17:19] God in flesh
[1:17:21] speaking to mankind saying you know what
[1:17:25] it's okay don't worry about it you just
[1:17:27] be you you just worry about yourself get
[1:17:30] into your own position make sure that
[1:17:34] you're perfect as your father in Heaven
[1:17:36] is perfect don't look at your enemies
[1:17:37] don't try and perfect yourself with your
[1:17:39] enemies or those who persecute you or
[1:17:42] despitefully use you don't don't worry
[1:17:44] about trying to see that contrast just
[1:17:45] look at the Lord in heaven and make
[1:17:48] yourself perfect like he is
[1:17:51] where I'm going with this I'll just tell
[1:17:53] you honestly I've been real touched by
[1:17:55] the life of Lori Wilson I was able to
[1:17:57] meet this man a little while ago and met
[1:18:00] him a few times and had some
[1:18:02] conversations with him a few times and
[1:18:04] you know it was so amazing for me
[1:18:08] because we we the last time I talked to
[1:18:11] him he had called me that week and said
[1:18:13] you know come and see me Barry come and
[1:18:15] see me and you could tell he was afraid
[1:18:19] he wanted to be baptized and he was in a
[1:18:21] position where he couldn't be baptized
[1:18:23] now he was laying in a bed and the only
[1:18:25] thing he could move was his head
[1:18:27] but he was gasping for air a little bit
[1:18:29] he couldn't catch his breath and and
[1:18:31] then he would be fine for a few hours
[1:18:33] and then he couldn't catch his breath
[1:18:35] and for those people that don't know
[1:18:36] this is a man that was suffering from
[1:18:37] ALS he was in the final stages of of Lou
[1:18:40] Gehrig's disease ALS and he was laying
[1:18:43] in the bed and only thing he could do is
[1:18:44] move his head and he he talked about how
[1:18:47] frustrating it was to be in that
[1:18:48] position and how how he suffered with
[1:18:51] with wondering what kind of a day he was
[1:18:54] going to have it depended on the type of
[1:18:56] people that were going to come through
[1:18:57] his door because the room that he was in
[1:18:59] in the hospice that he was in he
[1:19:02] couldn't do anything for himself he
[1:19:04] could do nothing for himself actually
[1:19:06] there was one thing he could do and he
[1:19:08] did it he he had like a jacket that was
[1:19:11] here and and he would grab it with his
[1:19:13] teeth and he would lift it up when he
[1:19:15] felt a little chilly on his throat and
[1:19:17] that was the only thing he could do for
[1:19:19] himself
[1:19:20] everything else was completely dependent
[1:19:22] on someone else and and he said my day
[1:19:24] depends on the person that they send
[1:19:26] through that door I I have no idea who
[1:19:28] it's going to be and whether they're
[1:19:30] going to be rough to me they don't he
[1:19:31] said I had to explain to them every
[1:19:33] single day how I need to be taken out
[1:19:35] because rarely did he get the same
[1:19:37] person the next day it was always
[1:19:40] someone different
[1:19:41] but just talking to him he he was
[1:19:44] expressing that he knows that he is
[1:19:46] going that the Lord is going to take him
[1:19:48] and he doesn't know what it's going to
[1:19:50] be like and he's wondering what the last
[1:19:52] few moments of his life are going to be
[1:19:53] like the final stages of Lou Gehrig's
[1:19:56] Disease they they they they
[1:19:58] basically your your body stops and and
[1:20:01] he was not looking forward to those last
[1:20:03] few moments and I'll spare you the
[1:20:04] details but but what I said to him was
[1:20:07] brother if you can't be baptized and you
[1:20:10] desire to be baptized God knows your
[1:20:13] heart he's greater than our hearts
[1:20:15] you don't have to worry about whether
[1:20:18] you will actually be there or not if
[1:20:20] that's your desire and I said to him
[1:20:22] Rory what do you want to do with your
[1:20:25] life if you could be healed why would
[1:20:27] you want to be healed what would you
[1:20:28] want to do with it and and I probably
[1:20:30] told some of the people this but his
[1:20:32] eyes flashed and I could tell he was
[1:20:35] excited about that thought because he
[1:20:37] said to me I've thought about that and
[1:20:40] if I could be healed what I would do is
[1:20:42] I would I would live my life for other
[1:20:43] people I would go to church and I would
[1:20:45] get baptized and I would help as many
[1:20:47] people as I could in my life and I
[1:20:49] thought here we have a man that's dying
[1:20:51] but but but I'm living and I think many
[1:20:54] times oh no that brother wants help with
[1:20:57] this or I gotta go and do that or he
[1:20:59] would never do that for me who am I what
[1:21:01] kind of a person a human being am I
[1:21:05] so encouraging to think that a man the
[1:21:08] only thing he could do is speak with his
[1:21:09] mouth and and move a jacket up or down
[1:21:12] he has the desire to do all he can my
[1:21:15] goodness one of the things he said to me
[1:21:17] was if I could do anything I would just
[1:21:19] get to living as hard as I could and I
[1:21:21] can't help but think brothers and
[1:21:22] sisters I just want to encourage us to
[1:21:25] just get living as hard as we can help
[1:21:27] as many people as you can in your life
[1:21:29] brother Branham said that's that's what
[1:21:31] eternal life is it's living for others
[1:21:32] it's not seeing how much I can get how
[1:21:35] much I can amass how much I can save no
[1:21:38] it's not about that at all it's about
[1:21:40] helping other people
[1:21:41] the end of the day we're only going to
[1:21:43] have our name
[1:21:45] and when we live our lives for others
[1:21:47] it's not even going to be our name it's
[1:21:48] going to be his name right we're going
[1:21:50] to be we're going to be living for
[1:21:52] Christ
[1:21:53] I just have been so inspired by this
[1:21:55] this experience that I had with with
[1:21:57] brother Rory and I just out of the
[1:22:00] beyond the curtain of time if if you
[1:22:03] don't mind bringing it up Brothers
[1:22:04] there's just uh
[1:22:06] just a quote
[1:22:10] it's uh paragraph 38.
[1:22:15] brother brother Neville he reads this in
[1:22:17] this message it's out of
[1:22:20] 1961.0305 if you wanna
[1:22:22] listen to this later look it up but
[1:22:27] brother Branham he's given this
[1:22:29] opportunity
[1:22:31] this opportunity to go to the other side
[1:22:33] I probably won't be able to do this
[1:22:35] without getting emotional it's just such
[1:22:37] a a wonderful thing
[1:22:39] sometimes it's not tears of of sadness
[1:22:42] it's tears of joy
[1:22:44] and that's what this is today if you see
[1:22:46] me emotional
[1:22:50] are you able to find it paragraph
[1:22:53] 38
[1:22:57] brother Neville reads from February 1961
[1:22:59] Full Gospel men's
[1:23:01] voice
[1:23:03] he uh
[1:23:07] I'm not sure why I'll just go ahead
[1:23:09] though
[1:23:10] but the novel reads this this is what
[1:23:12] brother Brown I'm expressing what he
[1:23:14] experienced
[1:23:15] the other morning I was laying on my bed
[1:23:17] I had just awoke from sleep
[1:23:20] and I place my hands behind my head
[1:23:22] and relaxed with my head on the pillow
[1:23:27] that I began to wonder what it will be
[1:23:29] like on the other side I realized
[1:23:32] I had lived more than half my life
[1:23:34] if I live to be as old as my people and
[1:23:38] I wanted to do more for the Lord before
[1:23:40] I left this life it's pretty amazing
[1:23:42] here in 1961 he started preaching in 48
[1:23:45] and he wanted to do something for the
[1:23:47] Lord my
[1:23:49] brother goes on to say I Heard a Voice
[1:23:52] saying
[1:23:53] you're just starting
[1:23:55] press the battle keep pressing
[1:23:58] as I lay there pondering the words I
[1:24:01] thought that I had just imagined that I
[1:24:03] had excuse me heard a voice again the
[1:24:06] voice said keep press the battle keep
[1:24:09] going keep going
[1:24:10] still unbelieving
[1:24:13] I thought that possibly I had spoken the
[1:24:15] words myself
[1:24:17] I placed the Lips My Lips between my
[1:24:20] teeth and held my hand over my mouth and
[1:24:23] listened The Voice spoke again just keep
[1:24:26] pressing
[1:24:27] if you only knew what was what is at the
[1:24:31] end of the road I seem to hear the music
[1:24:33] and the words of an old familiar song
[1:24:36] I'm homesick and blue I want to see
[1:24:38] Jesus
[1:24:39] I would like to hear those Harbor bells
[1:24:41] chime
[1:24:43] it would brighten my path and banish all
[1:24:45] fears
[1:24:46] Lord let me look past the curtain of
[1:24:49] time
[1:24:51] I just want to mention this as well you
[1:24:54] can probably find it on YouTube if you
[1:24:56] type in those Harbor bells chime I think
[1:24:59] it comes up with that somebody did a
[1:25:01] little collage with brother Branham
[1:25:03] speaking those words singing those words
[1:25:05] and uh it's just a wonderful
[1:25:08] visualization of of looking past the
[1:25:11] curtain of time
[1:25:13] goes on to say
[1:25:15] then the voice asked would you like to
[1:25:18] see just beyond the curtain
[1:25:20] I answered it would help me so much
[1:25:24] what happened I cannot say whether I was
[1:25:27] in the body or out or whether I was it
[1:25:29] was a translation I I do not know
[1:25:33] but it was unlike any Vision I had ever
[1:25:35] had I could see the place to which I was
[1:25:39] taken and I could see myself lying back
[1:25:42] there upon my bed
[1:25:44] I said this is a strange thing
[1:25:49] there were great numbers of people and
[1:25:51] they came running to greet me saying oh
[1:25:53] our precious brother
[1:25:56] first came young women apparently in
[1:25:58] their 20s
[1:26:00] and they would embrace me
[1:26:02] they said our precious brother young men
[1:26:04] and the Brilliance of Young Manhood with
[1:26:07] eyes glistening like stars on a darkened
[1:26:10] night with teeth as white as pearls
[1:26:12] embraced me saying our precious brother
[1:26:17] then I noticed that I too had become
[1:26:19] young again
[1:26:21] I looked at myself there and turned and
[1:26:24] looked back at my old body lying on the
[1:26:27] bed with my hands behind my head
[1:26:30] I said I don't understand this
[1:26:33] I just want to remind everyone don't be
[1:26:35] looking for elderly people
[1:26:38] we're not going to see old people
[1:26:41] we're going to see young people
[1:26:43] and many times the people that we love
[1:26:45] are elderly when they pass on
[1:26:48] but they're not going to be when they
[1:26:49] come back they're going to be young
[1:26:51] people when we come back and I think
[1:26:53] it's beautiful because we're going to
[1:26:54] have the ability to recognize them
[1:26:58] goes on to say as I began to try
[1:27:01] to comprehend the place where I was I
[1:27:05] began to realize that there was no
[1:27:07] yesterday and no tomorrow there
[1:27:10] can you just imagine that thought
[1:27:13] there's no sense of urgency there's no
[1:27:15] schedule there's no pressure there's no
[1:27:18] sense of time there's there's nothing
[1:27:20] other than perfect love which is what
[1:27:23] we're getting to with this and I'm
[1:27:25] probably just going to keep sprinkling
[1:27:26] this in because I don't want to wait
[1:27:27] till the end until we start talking
[1:27:29] about that brothers and sisters this is
[1:27:30] what he's talking about is perfect love
[1:27:32] this is perfection that he's talking
[1:27:34] about there's no time there's no
[1:27:36] yesterday or tomorrow what a beautiful
[1:27:38] thought as I try as I began to try to
[1:27:41] comprehend a place where I was I began
[1:27:43] to realize that there was no yesterday
[1:27:44] and no tomorrow there no one seemed to
[1:27:47] get tired
[1:27:48] I just love that thought as a multitude
[1:27:51] of the most beautiful young woman I have
[1:27:54] ever seen through their arms around me I
[1:27:56] discovered there was only a great love
[1:27:58] that overwhelmed me and no physical
[1:28:00] attraction as in the human behavior
[1:28:03] wouldn't that be nice Brothers
[1:28:06] I noticed these young women all wore
[1:28:08] their hair down to their waistline and
[1:28:10] their skirts went down to their feet
[1:28:13] after this hope my first wife hugged me
[1:28:15] and said my precious brother then
[1:28:17] another young woman hugged me and hope
[1:28:19] turned and hugged the young woman said I
[1:28:22] don't understand this this is something
[1:28:24] entirely different from our human love
[1:28:27] I don't want to go back to that old body
[1:28:29] in bed
[1:28:34] did you ever hear that voice
[1:28:37] some people might say no you can't hear
[1:28:39] a voice there's no way that you can
[1:28:40] audibly hear a voice you know what that
[1:28:43] might be for some people but there's
[1:28:44] others that say Amen I've heard a voice
[1:28:46] I hear that voice speak to me all the
[1:28:49] time but the random says then a voice
[1:28:51] spoke to me this is what you preached
[1:28:54] the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:56] this is perfect love
[1:28:59] nothing can enter here without it
[1:29:05] so I just want to pause there and just
[1:29:07] say brothers and sisters if there's
[1:29:09] anything in our lives if there's any
[1:29:10] residue if there's any hurts if there's
[1:29:12] any pains if there's any any grudges if
[1:29:15] there's any problems or situations or
[1:29:17] things in our lives we're not going to
[1:29:19] take them there
[1:29:20] so you might as well get rid of them
[1:29:22] here
[1:29:23] this is why we get the word of God so
[1:29:25] that we can wash that stuff out of our
[1:29:27] Lives not so that we can say I amen God
[1:29:31] sent a prophet but I've still got this
[1:29:33] Grudge in my life I can't get rid of
[1:29:35] we've got to be willing to wash it out
[1:29:37] because that's the only thing that's
[1:29:39] going to make it there is perfect love
[1:29:43] remember we've said it I think brother
[1:29:45] Branham has said it you probably heard
[1:29:47] other ministers say it it's one of the
[1:29:48] biggest tricks of the devil for the
[1:29:49] people that have the Holy Ghost for him
[1:29:51] to trick them out of thinking they've
[1:29:52] got it and the people that think they've
[1:29:54] got it to be tricked into thinking
[1:29:55] they've got it when they really don't
[1:29:57] there's only one true evidence of of the
[1:30:00] Holy Ghost in our lives and that's the
[1:30:01] ability to receive the word for our day
[1:30:03] and you know what it's not saying Amen
[1:30:05] to the word what it is is living the
[1:30:06] word when we can live the word that the
[1:30:08] prophet brought To Us by every letter
[1:30:10] that demonstrates the life of Jesus
[1:30:13] Christ
[1:30:15] that's perfect love
[1:30:18] then a voice spoke to me this is what
[1:30:20] you preached that the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:23] this is perfect love nothing can enter
[1:30:25] here with it without it next I was taken
[1:30:28] up and seated on a high place all around
[1:30:31] me were great numbers of men and women
[1:30:33] in the bloom of Youth they were crying
[1:30:36] with joy oh our precious brother we are
[1:30:38] so happy to see you here I thought I I'm
[1:30:41] not dreaming for I can see these people
[1:30:43] and and I can see my body lying back
[1:30:46] there on the bed
[1:30:47] and some people might say this is just a
[1:30:49] crazy stretch of the imagination this is
[1:30:51] just some man hallucinating some some
[1:30:53] might say maybe he had a hot pepper
[1:30:55] salad that night before he went to bed
[1:30:57] right we know that that's the way it is
[1:30:59] the devil will be that way but you know
[1:31:01] there's some people also that will say
[1:31:02] amen that's that's that's more than life
[1:31:04] to me I can understand that this is for
[1:31:06] a purpose this is for an encouragement
[1:31:09] to a certain group of people The Voice
[1:31:11] spoke to me you know it's written in the
[1:31:13] Bible that the prophets were gathered
[1:31:15] with their people I said yes I remember
[1:31:18] that in the scriptures but there are not
[1:31:20] this many branhams The Voice replied
[1:31:22] these are not branhams these are your
[1:31:25] converts the ones you have led to the
[1:31:28] Lord and some of these women you think
[1:31:30] are are so young and beautiful were more
[1:31:33] than 90 years old when you led them to
[1:31:35] the Lord
[1:31:37] no wonder they are crying out my
[1:31:39] precious brother
[1:31:40] then the multitude cried together if you
[1:31:43] hadn't gone forth with the gospel we
[1:31:47] wouldn't be here
[1:31:49] brothers and sisters I want to say
[1:31:51] that's not just a group of people and I
[1:31:53] know we've heard it all before that's
[1:31:54] not just a group of people somewhere out
[1:31:56] there in a different dimension beyond
[1:31:59] the curtain of time that that we can say
[1:32:01] one of these days we'll see that group
[1:32:03] of people I want to say this he was in a
[1:32:05] different dimension that was called
[1:32:06] eternity before the foundation of the
[1:32:08] world right there
[1:32:10] he wasn't in space or time
[1:32:12] he was in Perfection there's only one
[1:32:15] thing that's perfect and that's Eternal
[1:32:16] that's God's own life
[1:32:19] he was beyond the curtain of time and
[1:32:21] you know he was talking to us I want to
[1:32:23] say that some of these young sisters
[1:32:26] here some of these elderly sisters here
[1:32:28] maybe you were there speaking to him
[1:32:32] before the foundation of the world these
[1:32:35] are the people that were his converts
[1:32:37] he goes on to say I asked oh where's
[1:32:39] Jesus I want to see him can you imagine
[1:32:42] having that realization recognizing this
[1:32:44] is it man I'm I'm beyond the curtain of
[1:32:47] time and and now I know where I'm at I
[1:32:49] recognize this I'm starting to get the
[1:32:51] gist of what's going on now where's
[1:32:53] Jesus I really want to see him because
[1:32:54] he's the one that got me here my
[1:32:57] goodness
[1:32:58] where's Jesus I want to see him the
[1:33:00] people who replied he's he's just a
[1:33:02] little higher someday he'll come to you
[1:33:04] you were sent as a leader and when God
[1:33:07] comes he will judge you according to
[1:33:09] your teaching
[1:33:11] but Toby brought this and I just I just
[1:33:14] think it's so magnificent to read this
[1:33:17] and to recognize our position he I asked
[1:33:21] does does Paul and Peter have to stand
[1:33:24] this judgment also the answer was yes
[1:33:28] I can just imagine yes in in the soul of
[1:33:32] William Mary and Bradham when he was
[1:33:34] there to think the gravity of that
[1:33:35] situation are they going to be judged he
[1:33:38] could just say yes I
[1:33:41] could you imagine if you had mingled
[1:33:43] something with it and you were standing
[1:33:45] there and they have to be judged and the
[1:33:47] only thing that's going to be accepted
[1:33:49] is the word of God and to stand there
[1:33:51] and think uh oh I'm in the position now
[1:33:53] where maybe I had just a little bit of
[1:33:55] something sprinkled in there something
[1:33:57] that just kept a little bit of residue
[1:33:58] of Grudge or a problem or something that
[1:34:00] was unresolved in my life there's just
[1:34:02] that thing there
[1:34:04] my
[1:34:05] but here he is yes the answer was yes I
[1:34:09] said I have preached what they preached
[1:34:11] I did not divert from it to one side or
[1:34:15] the other were they baptized in the name
[1:34:17] of Jesus I did too where they taught the
[1:34:19] baptism in the Holy Spirit I did too
[1:34:22] whatever they taught I taught also
[1:34:25] didn't say it was some other culture it
[1:34:27] was from some other time it was the
[1:34:29] olden days that was the word of God
[1:34:31] revealed to me in my day and I said amen
[1:34:34] to it
[1:34:37] we know that the people cried and we're
[1:34:39] know that we're going to back to Earth
[1:34:41] with you sometime Jesus will come and
[1:34:45] judge you according to the word you
[1:34:47] preached us then you will present us to
[1:34:50] him and all together we will go back to
[1:34:53] Earth and live forever
[1:34:55] I asked do I have to go back to Earth
[1:34:57] now
[1:34:58] they answered yes but keep pressing on
[1:35:05] just can't imagine what that would be
[1:35:06] like
[1:35:07] it sure is nice to try
[1:35:10] as I began to move from that beautiful
[1:35:13] joyful place as far as my eyes could see
[1:35:16] people were coming towards me to embrace
[1:35:19] me crying my precious brother
[1:35:22] suddenly I was back on my bed again I
[1:35:24] said oh God help me never let me
[1:35:27] compromise with the word
[1:35:30] let me stay straight on that word
[1:35:33] I want to say it brothers and sisters
[1:35:35] let us stay straight on that word
[1:35:37] don't don't have any room for any
[1:35:40] deviation from that word don't let
[1:35:42] anything get between you and that word
[1:35:44] Satan's gonna do everything that he can
[1:35:46] to try and destroy your faith in that
[1:35:48] word and if he can do it he he'll
[1:35:51] destroy your opportunity to see this
[1:35:53] land but we're so thankful that if you
[1:35:55] have been called if you have been chosen
[1:35:57] if you are one of them then you won't
[1:36:00] miss it
[1:36:01] and and will always line up with the
[1:36:03] word of God it's such a wonderful thing
[1:36:05] that was what I was trying to express to
[1:36:07] to Rory you know what's going to happen
[1:36:10] is you're just going to breathe out
[1:36:11] brother you're just going to take your
[1:36:13] last breath here and then you're just
[1:36:15] going to take in your next breath there
[1:36:16] it's just going to be stepping from one
[1:36:18] dimension to the other you don't have to
[1:36:20] worry you don't have to be afraid if the
[1:36:23] desire in your heart is to serve God
[1:36:24] then he knows it because he's greater
[1:36:27] than our heart brother you don't have to
[1:36:28] worry it was such a wonderful time to
[1:36:31] just talk to him and I I personally I
[1:36:33] guess why I'm so moved by it I didn't
[1:36:34] recognize that that last Wednesday would
[1:36:37] be the last time I'd speak to him on
[1:36:38] this side of Eternity we went to visit
[1:36:40] him again on uh Thursday
[1:36:43] thinking that he'd be there and and what
[1:36:45] we got to see was a memorial sign on the
[1:36:48] wall saying in memory of Rory Wilson
[1:36:49] that was it he was gone and he passed
[1:36:53] quickly it was such a a kind of a sad
[1:36:56] thing to hear about but at the same time
[1:36:58] what a tremendous thought to be able to
[1:37:01] express what it would be like to go
[1:37:03] beyond the curtain of time with someone
[1:37:05] who was just about to take that step it
[1:37:08] just really did something to me why
[1:37:11] brother Adam goes on to say I'm more
[1:37:13] convinced than ever in my life that it
[1:37:16] will take perfect love to enter that
[1:37:18] place
[1:37:22] there was no jealousy
[1:37:24] no tiredness
[1:37:26] no sickness
[1:37:28] no old age no death
[1:37:30] only Supreme Beauty and joy
[1:37:36] I I just
[1:37:38] can't help but be encouraged by this and
[1:37:41] and think you know sometimes I don't
[1:37:42] even know why the Lord wants to go a
[1:37:44] certain direction but I usually find out
[1:37:46] afterwards that someone was having a
[1:37:47] conversation someone had a prayer
[1:37:49] something was going on and so here we
[1:37:52] are brothers and sisters it's kind of a
[1:37:53] different direction but you know in this
[1:37:55] message beyond the curtain of time in
[1:37:57] 1961 zero three zero five brother
[1:37:59] Branham he gives instructions as he goes
[1:38:02] on he says whatever you do lay aside
[1:38:04] everything else until you get perfect
[1:38:06] love how many people here today have
[1:38:08] perfect love I don't want to put anybody
[1:38:10] on the spot but what I do want to say
[1:38:11] brothers and sisters if we've got
[1:38:12] anything getting in the way from us
[1:38:14] getting that perfect love then we need
[1:38:16] to do something about it we have to take
[1:38:18] the steps to get rid of whatever is
[1:38:20] hindering us from receiving that perfect
[1:38:21] love and what that perfect love is quite
[1:38:24] simply is the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:38:25] and we need to know that we know that we
[1:38:28] know that we've got the Holy Ghost in
[1:38:29] our lives and I want to say it this way
[1:38:30] if you don't know that you got the Holy
[1:38:31] Ghost brothers and sisters ask him to
[1:38:34] give you the Holy Ghost and he will give
[1:38:35] you the Holy Ghost and if you don't have
[1:38:37] a confirmation in your life that you've
[1:38:39] got the Holy Ghost ask him to give you a
[1:38:41] confirmation that you've got the holy
[1:38:42] ghost in your life and I promise you
[1:38:44] he'll give it to you
[1:38:45] he will give it to you
[1:38:47] and if we need to have a prayer meeting
[1:38:49] Brothers and Sisters Let's have a prayer
[1:38:51] meeting that you'll get the Holy Ghost
[1:38:52] in your life I remember my former Pastor
[1:38:54] he said if you ever need to pray through
[1:38:56] just call me and we'll pray through and
[1:38:59] you know what we did that we took the
[1:39:01] opportunity to pray through sometimes we
[1:39:04] need that in our lives sometimes there's
[1:39:05] things that just aren't resolved we
[1:39:07] don't understand we can't comprehend
[1:39:09] just by prayer and supplication God will
[1:39:12] come on the scene and minister to us
[1:39:15] but if we never give them the
[1:39:16] opportunity and we just say no you know
[1:39:18] it's good I've got it it's everything is
[1:39:20] fine in my life everything is okay we
[1:39:22] talked about it on Wednesday there's two
[1:39:24] classes of people those ones that will
[1:39:25] say Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[1:39:27] word I just want to make it right with
[1:39:29] you I don't ever want to have anything
[1:39:30] in the way just be it unto me and
[1:39:32] there'll be other ones that will say no
[1:39:33] I'm good I got it got the message 1970.
[1:39:37] I had it for years brother it's all fine
[1:39:39] I know I got the holy ghost in my life
[1:39:43] we got to be careful
[1:39:46] my goodness
[1:39:49] I want to say this if you've been
[1:39:51] baptized in titles have you really
[1:39:52] received the Holy Ghost
[1:39:56] whatever you do brothers and sisters lay
[1:39:58] aside everything else until you get
[1:40:00] perfect love
[1:40:02] get to where you can love everybody
[1:40:05] even your enemy
[1:40:07] no matter if the plane is rocking the
[1:40:09] lightning is flashing or The Guns of the
[1:40:11] enemy are upon you
[1:40:14] remember these are the words I believe
[1:40:16] of God through the prophet
[1:40:20] it's not just a man speaking
[1:40:23] this is God speaking
[1:40:25] no matter if the plane is rocking the
[1:40:28] lightning is flashing of the guns of the
[1:40:29] enemy are upon you these things do not
[1:40:32] matter
[1:40:33] perfect love
[1:40:36] perfect love so you can love your
[1:40:37] enemies the people that despitefully use
[1:40:40] you if you see someone willfully doing
[1:40:44] you wrong
[1:40:46] does that change your relationship with
[1:40:48] God
[1:40:51] whether Branham goes on to say if you're
[1:40:52] not saved except Jesus Christ as your
[1:40:55] savior now
[1:40:57] if you have not been baptized in water
[1:40:59] be baptized now
[1:41:02] if you have not received the baptism in
[1:41:05] the Holy Spirit receive it now press on
[1:41:08] to that perfect love which will take you
[1:41:11] to that beautiful and joyful place
[1:41:12] beyond the curtain of time
[1:41:14] brothers and sisters we've got a
[1:41:16] baptismal tank in the basement if you
[1:41:18] want to get baptized you can do it
[1:41:21] all you have to do is say the word
[1:41:24] I want to say it this way sometimes
[1:41:26] there's people that have been baptized
[1:41:28] but they don't really recognize why or
[1:41:31] the Devil comes around and tries to beat
[1:41:33] them up over it I'm not saying that we
[1:41:35] should get baptized every week or every
[1:41:36] year or every month but sometimes in our
[1:41:39] lives we need to drive down a stake I
[1:41:41] would say into the heart of our enemy
[1:41:43] and say hey you know what maybe I was
[1:41:44] baptized when I was 11 and I just never
[1:41:46] really realized what it meant but the
[1:41:49] devil has badgered me for years over it
[1:41:51] and I want to drive down a stake and say
[1:41:53] hey I know that I know and I want to
[1:41:55] point Satan to that time or that time
[1:41:56] you choose which time Satan but I've
[1:41:58] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:42:00] Jesus Christ and that means that I shall
[1:42:01] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:03] because that's the promise unto me and
[1:42:05] my children and as many as it are far
[1:42:07] off even as many as the Lord shall call
[1:42:09] in my day
[1:42:11] brothers and sisters I want to say it
[1:42:13] today where are we positionally what's
[1:42:16] our position are we in Christ or or are
[1:42:19] we around Christ are are we beside
[1:42:21] Christ are are we close to Christ
[1:42:23] because if we're close it's not going to
[1:42:26] be close enough we've got to be in
[1:42:27] Christ he has to be in us we have to be
[1:42:30] in him
[1:42:34] where are we personally
[1:42:37] personally
[1:42:38] where is our position with him
[1:42:41] we have to know that
[1:42:44] talking about this out of beyond the
[1:42:46] curtain of time paragraph 43.
[1:42:52] the Branham talks about love and faith
[1:42:55] he says because of this
[1:42:57] that we might know that our efforts are
[1:42:59] not in vain see
[1:43:02] we must approach God through that
[1:43:04] channel of love and faith
[1:43:07] Faith takes us
[1:43:10] to the channel
[1:43:13] love is the one that takes us in
[1:43:17] I I'm pausing with this and you might be
[1:43:20] thinking it's such a simple thing why
[1:43:21] are you reading it like that brother
[1:43:22] Barry maybe I'm I'm a little sleepy
[1:43:23] today I'm trying to emphasize it I want
[1:43:25] to make it real clear it's not just uh
[1:43:28] it's not just love that gets us there
[1:43:30] and it's not just faith that gets us
[1:43:32] there here we have the prophet of God
[1:43:33] saying it's faith and love and it's not
[1:43:36] having faith that gives us the ability
[1:43:38] to have love in fact I think he's saying
[1:43:40] it the other way around it's that love
[1:43:42] that gets inside of us that causes us to
[1:43:44] have faith and I think it's so important
[1:43:46] for us to get that point across in our
[1:43:49] lives that you know what we're not going
[1:43:50] to have perfect Faith unless we get
[1:43:52] perfect love
[1:43:54] and perfect love is going to demonstrate
[1:43:56] that perfect faith in our lives and I
[1:43:58] know I've been talking about the third
[1:44:00] poll brothers and sisters but I want to
[1:44:02] make sure that we're crystal clear you
[1:44:04] understand my position on it having
[1:44:06] great signs and wonders being able to
[1:44:08] say that we said the right thing for the
[1:44:09] Holy Ghost and now the Holy Ghost is
[1:44:11] going to move on the scene we're going
[1:44:12] to see a great sign and wonder that
[1:44:13] isn't going to do it for us that won't
[1:44:15] get us into that perfect place that
[1:44:17] could heal our body here
[1:44:19] that could fill our bank account
[1:44:22] but will it give us salvation that's the
[1:44:25] key that's the critical Factor here we
[1:44:27] want to get salvation we want to know
[1:44:29] that we know where we stand but it's
[1:44:31] it's faith God's faith in us that we
[1:44:35] need and the only way we're going to
[1:44:36] have that is to have his love love is
[1:44:39] the one that takes us in
[1:44:42] that's what's going to do it for us
[1:44:45] we have the ability to get to that place
[1:44:48] and we we I I don't know I guess the
[1:44:52] inspiration for me is just to cry out
[1:44:54] brothers and sisters once again just to
[1:44:56] say that make sure you got the holy
[1:44:57] ghost in your lives maybe we could just
[1:44:59] end the service now and go home and and
[1:45:01] have Mother's Day but I know we got a
[1:45:03] whole lot more but if I had to end it
[1:45:05] right now I would say just get baptized
[1:45:07] by the Holy Ghost and know that you are
[1:45:09] saved know that you've got the holy
[1:45:11] ghost in your life no you've got the
[1:45:13] token the Seal of God that you can say
[1:45:15] amen I know that if I walk out of here
[1:45:17] and get hit by a bus I'm going to this
[1:45:20] place that brother Bradham was talking
[1:45:21] about I'm not going to be afraid so many
[1:45:24] people you see they're afraid they're
[1:45:27] afraid to die brothers and sisters even
[1:45:29] in the message of the hour it's
[1:45:31] staggering to think what are we afraid
[1:45:34] of
[1:45:35] what's the fear
[1:45:37] Satan plays on that Satan loves that
[1:45:40] when we're afraid when we start to get
[1:45:41] afraid oh no I'm gonna die I'm gonna get
[1:45:43] a sickness and die I'm gonna get an
[1:45:45] illness and and pass away you can never
[1:45:48] die
[1:45:49] if you believe this word of God you're
[1:45:51] as Eternal as he is eternal he will not
[1:45:54] lose one part of himself
[1:45:56] get the Holy Ghost in your life and then
[1:45:59] whatever happens happens
[1:46:03] here I'm talking like someone with
[1:46:04] authority I feel like I sound like a
[1:46:06] madman forgive me but you know brothers
[1:46:08] and sisters there's only one thing that
[1:46:10] we have for us in our day get the Holy
[1:46:13] Ghost and you know when he lives out
[1:46:15] we're going to demonstrate a different
[1:46:17] life we're not going to be what's in it
[1:46:19] for me in every situation that we're
[1:46:21] living we're going to say what's in it
[1:46:23] for them because I recognize that I've
[1:46:25] got the pearl of great price I own all
[1:46:28] of this I don't have to fight for it
[1:46:33] out of this message be on the curtain of
[1:46:35] time brother Bradham says could you
[1:46:36] imagine an artist painting this is
[1:46:37] paragraph 45 could you imagine an artist
[1:46:39] painting a great picture beautiful till
[1:46:42] it's Sublime
[1:46:44] and then just tearing it up
[1:46:46] could you imagine that
[1:46:48] taken maybe months to paint a picture
[1:46:51] and get it just exactly right and then
[1:46:53] just tear it up at the end ah
[1:46:56] I don't like it
[1:46:58] brother says there would be something
[1:47:00] wrong with the artist
[1:47:02] could you imagine a composer writing a
[1:47:04] song Until It's Sublime and then just
[1:47:07] tear up his music sheet tear up his
[1:47:09] music up
[1:47:10] says there would be something wrong with
[1:47:12] the composer see
[1:47:14] there's nothing wrong with God
[1:47:17] don't make a thing like this
[1:47:19] just to tear it up and throw it away
[1:47:22] I want to say brothers and sisters
[1:47:23] that's a denominational teaching
[1:47:25] that's that's a doctrine of a devil that
[1:47:28] says you're saved today and that you're
[1:47:30] lost tomorrow and then you can go and
[1:47:32] come and get saved maybe you can do a
[1:47:34] little bit of service for the church or
[1:47:36] a little bit of service for your family
[1:47:38] or the community or maybe tie the little
[1:47:40] extra and God will bless you and bring
[1:47:42] you back into the fold you're either
[1:47:44] saved or you're not and if you're saved
[1:47:47] you're saved until your day of
[1:47:48] redemption
[1:47:50] if you've got the token it's over
[1:47:56] brother Branham says there'd be
[1:47:57] something wrong with the composer see if
[1:47:59] he's just going to tear up his music
[1:48:00] there's nothing wrong with God God Don't
[1:48:02] Make a thing like this and just tear it
[1:48:04] up and throw it away he's not going to
[1:48:06] save you today to lose you tomorrow
[1:48:09] I'm just throwing my words in there I'll
[1:48:10] go back to it he says it is it's for his
[1:48:13] kingdom it's for his glory and he's
[1:48:16] speaking about each one of us he says
[1:48:18] each one of us has a part in this
[1:48:20] picture and in this song we are parts of
[1:48:23] the kingdom of God and that is that we
[1:48:26] can play our parts as long as we realize
[1:48:29] Where We Are positionally
[1:48:32] belong in this place and then stay right
[1:48:35] there in that place
[1:48:38] and one place we know it's in love
[1:48:42] because that's what makes up the picture
[1:48:44] so brothers and sisters I just want to
[1:48:46] say it today
[1:48:47] and I know maybe people might get upset
[1:48:51] at me for saying it but just stay in
[1:48:53] your lane
[1:48:54] let's just stay in our lane let's find
[1:48:57] out what our lane is in the word of God
[1:48:59] and just stay in our Lane
[1:49:01] and if something happens if the plane
[1:49:03] starts rocking and the enemy's guns are
[1:49:05] trained upon us and and people are
[1:49:07] despitefully using us and maybe we see
[1:49:10] someone doing something that's totally
[1:49:11] wrong according to the word is that
[1:49:13] going to change our ability to worship
[1:49:15] him is that going to change our ability
[1:49:17] to go to church
[1:49:19] is it going to change our ability to
[1:49:21] know that we know that we know
[1:49:24] what happens when that happens is we
[1:49:26] give Satan the occasion to change our
[1:49:28] experience
[1:49:29] and of course we live in a world where
[1:49:31] we have emotions and and and and that's
[1:49:34] the biggest battle that's the greatest
[1:49:35] battle ever fought it's in the mind
[1:49:36] right that's the greatest battle ever
[1:49:39] fought is to be able to subdue the
[1:49:41] emotions the mind game that happens and
[1:49:44] and to be able to Just Surrender
[1:49:46] ourselves to the word of God to the
[1:49:48] spirit of the Lord in our lives and
[1:49:50] that's why I say we have many times we
[1:49:52] can look at at the lives of people and
[1:49:54] say there's so many people that are
[1:49:56] afflicted in our flesh and you know I
[1:49:58] have ailments now I've got this and that
[1:50:00] and the other I could go on and on write
[1:50:02] you a list a laundry list of things
[1:50:03] that's wrong with this flesh this flesh
[1:50:05] is going to perish I'm not worried about
[1:50:07] this flesh I'm worried about this inner
[1:50:09] man I'm worried about the soul that's
[1:50:11] inside that's the one that I'm worried
[1:50:13] about brothers and sisters and all the
[1:50:15] rest of it will just follow if this
[1:50:17] flesh has to fall apart so be it it
[1:50:19] ain't going to change the soul that's
[1:50:20] inside of me
[1:50:22] but we have a great problem I believe in
[1:50:25] this world in general I'm not saying in
[1:50:27] this church or congregation but in this
[1:50:29] world in general with a mental illness
[1:50:32] and it's hidden we can't see it so many
[1:50:35] people are afflicted
[1:50:38] and they can't help it because they
[1:50:40] don't understand it but there is a
[1:50:42] delivering power and the delivering
[1:50:44] power is the old Backwoods Blue Sky Holy
[1:50:47] Ghost preacher and that's what's going
[1:50:49] to change people that's what will help
[1:50:51] people it's not going to join a church
[1:50:53] and and living a better life that's
[1:50:55] going to help us
[1:50:56] sure we might feel better for a day but
[1:50:59] then tomorrow is going to come
[1:51:02] brother Adam he says this each one of us
[1:51:03] play a part in this picture in this song
[1:51:05] where parts of the kingdom of God and
[1:51:07] that is we can play our parts as long as
[1:51:09] we realize where we are positionally if
[1:51:12] we can recognize a husband this is the
[1:51:15] husband's job description all we have to
[1:51:18] do is live that
[1:51:20] this is a father's job description this
[1:51:22] is a mother's job description these are
[1:51:24] the descriptions this is the position
[1:51:26] that we have been given
[1:51:28] I personally believe it with all my
[1:51:30] heart that is the manifestation of God's
[1:51:33] word in our lives
[1:51:34] because how many people can say amen God
[1:51:36] sent a prophet and and you have a
[1:51:38] problem in the home maybe the husband
[1:51:41] and the wife they separate how many
[1:51:43] times have we seen that in and around
[1:51:44] the message of the hour how many times
[1:51:46] the devil isn't restricted to any group
[1:51:49] just because we say that we belong to
[1:51:51] something doesn't mean a thing but boy
[1:51:53] oh boy when you pull it out and you say
[1:51:55] no no no no no you know what I'm not a
[1:51:57] part of any association but you see this
[1:51:58] here this here's the token this here's
[1:52:00] the Holy Ghost and I'm going to take it
[1:52:01] and do what the prophet of God said I'm
[1:52:03] going to hold that over top of my prayer
[1:52:04] and I'm going to say hey God you know
[1:52:06] what you said that I've got a promise if
[1:52:08] I can hold that token over my prayer
[1:52:10] that you'll come and honor my prayer nor
[1:52:12] to even be my prayer that will come
[1:52:13] forward it will be you praying through
[1:52:15] me uttering groanings that I can't even
[1:52:17] comprehend and so I want to invite you
[1:52:19] to come on the scene when we do that
[1:52:20] brothers and sisters that's when the
[1:52:22] devils are going to step back and say uh
[1:52:23] oh we don't want nothing to do with this
[1:52:25] one this one's a problem we need to
[1:52:27] actually just move around him and go
[1:52:29] after the other people
[1:52:31] but each one of us play a part in this
[1:52:33] picture don't be afraid brothers and
[1:52:34] sisters to play your part don't be
[1:52:36] afraid to find out what your job
[1:52:38] description is what is your role
[1:52:40] everyone has a role we've been talking
[1:52:42] about it and talking about it and now I
[1:52:44] want to talk about how we get into our
[1:52:46] role with Christ how we get into that
[1:52:48] position in Christ because that's going
[1:52:50] to take us to that place beyond the
[1:52:52] curtain of time that's our goal that's
[1:52:54] the end game brothers and sisters is to
[1:52:56] get beyond the curtain of time to know
[1:52:57] that's where we're going to go but to
[1:52:59] not be afraid Don't Be Afraid what do we
[1:53:02] have to fear
[1:53:03] what what what what really do we have to
[1:53:05] fear but fear itself sure we've got
[1:53:07] bills and and maybe we've got taxes and
[1:53:09] maybe we've got different things going
[1:53:11] on in this world but brother Branham
[1:53:13] says oh those things don't matter none
[1:53:15] of those things matter just get perfect
[1:53:16] love and you know what I want to say
[1:53:18] brothers and sisters if we have all
[1:53:20] those other things happening the guns
[1:53:21] are trained upon us and the plane is
[1:53:23] rocking and and you've got all these
[1:53:25] problems in your life just try getting
[1:53:27] perfect love when you get perfect love
[1:53:29] even though you still have all those
[1:53:31] problems something's going to change on
[1:53:33] the inside of you in that nervous
[1:53:34] condition that you're contending with
[1:53:36] because of all of that is going to start
[1:53:37] to settle down and then you're going to
[1:53:39] have Clarity of mind and then you'll be
[1:53:41] able to feed upon the word then you'll
[1:53:43] be able to press play then you'll be
[1:53:44] able to go to church then you'll be a
[1:53:45] part of the body then everything will
[1:53:47] start to come in line and then you'll
[1:53:48] watch God come on the scene and change
[1:53:50] the circumstances
[1:53:56] it's faith and love that's going to do
[1:53:58] it as we read in that quote you know
[1:54:00] just thinking about faith a little bit
[1:54:01] this morning out of First Peter 1 verse
[1:54:03] 6 he says Where and ye greatly Rejoice
[1:54:05] so now for a season if need be sometimes
[1:54:08] it needs to be some sometimes we have to
[1:54:11] be if need be ye are in heaviness
[1:54:13] through manifold temptations that the
[1:54:15] trial of your faith it's not the trial
[1:54:18] of your health it's not the trial of
[1:54:20] your mind it's not the trial of your
[1:54:21] family it's the trial of your faith
[1:54:24] the trial of your faith being much more
[1:54:26] precious than of gold that perisheth
[1:54:29] this world though it be tried with fire
[1:54:31] might be found unto praise and honor and
[1:54:34] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:54:36] whom having not seen ye love in whom
[1:54:39] though now ye see him
[1:54:42] not
[1:54:43] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[1:54:46] unspeakable and full of glory and I just
[1:54:48] think this is so important for us to
[1:54:50] recognize verse 9 here we talk about it
[1:54:52] we refer to it all the time but I want
[1:54:53] to read it in the scripture verse 9 says
[1:54:56] receiving the end of your faith
[1:54:59] even the salvation of your souls it's
[1:55:02] not you having the ability to work up a
[1:55:05] certain amount of Faith to get God to
[1:55:06] move on the situation it's having
[1:55:08] perfect love perfect love is going to
[1:55:10] lead you into this position where it's
[1:55:12] no longer even your faith your faith is
[1:55:13] going to take a step back and say whoa I
[1:55:16] don't even know what this is this is
[1:55:17] totally different and outside of what I
[1:55:19] even comprehend
[1:55:21] in First Peter 1 10 of which salvation
[1:55:24] the prophets have inquired and searched
[1:55:26] diligently who prophesied of the grace
[1:55:29] that should come unto who unto you
[1:55:32] that Grace the the the grace of the
[1:55:36] Salvation the the the faith the
[1:55:39] salvation of our souls
[1:55:42] that's the Salvation we're talking about
[1:55:44] and where did it come from that word
[1:55:46] came from the prophets to the people
[1:55:49] oh my in love first John 4 there's so
[1:55:53] much in the Bible for both of these
[1:55:56] um faith and love and there's no way
[1:55:57] that we could ever get all of it in one
[1:56:00] service but I just wanted to try and
[1:56:01] maybe skip across the pond today just
[1:56:04] like a rock and see how many of these
[1:56:07] points we could hit on love first John 4
[1:56:10] verse 17 here in is our love made
[1:56:13] perfect
[1:56:14] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:56:16] judgment
[1:56:18] you know what we don't have to wait till
[1:56:19] that day of judgment
[1:56:21] because we accept it right now
[1:56:23] we judge ourselves according to the word
[1:56:25] today right and that judgment that we
[1:56:28] judge ourselves by it's not our word and
[1:56:30] it's not our Creed or our Dogma it's the
[1:56:33] word of God that was once delivered to
[1:56:35] the Saints through the prophets and that
[1:56:38] is according to the word of God herein
[1:56:41] is our love made perfect that we may
[1:56:42] have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:56:44] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:56:48] it's such a profound verse
[1:56:51] but the Ken used to reference it a lot
[1:56:54] excuse me
[1:56:57] before he was promoted
[1:57:00] because he didn't die
[1:57:04] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:57:07] and what what I want to get to with that
[1:57:10] brothers and sisters what we started out
[1:57:11] with is be therefore perfect in this
[1:57:15] world as your father in Heaven is
[1:57:16] perfect and and that's what we're
[1:57:18] talking about here as he is in this
[1:57:20] world he's perfect in this world Jesus
[1:57:23] instructions God standing in flesh
[1:57:26] instructing mankind so man could
[1:57:28] comprehend God he spoke those words be
[1:57:31] ye therefore perfect even as your father
[1:57:34] in Heaven is perfect and you know what
[1:57:36] when we are perfect when we show that
[1:57:38] perfect love in our lives that perfect
[1:57:41] ability to receive the word for our day
[1:57:43] as he is so are we in this world we're
[1:57:47] here but you know what verse 18 I think
[1:57:50] demonstrates the life this is where it's
[1:57:52] the Rubber meeting the road we can talk
[1:57:54] about the the high level things as we
[1:57:56] have be therefore perfect even as your
[1:57:58] father and it can almost sound like a
[1:58:00] Pollyanna gospel like we're saying
[1:58:02] something that everyone should get
[1:58:03] everyone's perfect not everyone is able
[1:58:05] to receive this word and we know that
[1:58:07] very clear but verse 8 18 is where the
[1:58:10] rubber actually connects the road and
[1:58:11] starts to squeal it says there is
[1:58:13] therefore there is no fear in love
[1:58:18] so if we're afraid brothers and sisters
[1:58:20] if we've got fear about something
[1:58:21] brothers and sisters we need to get that
[1:58:23] perfect love in our lives because we're
[1:58:26] afraid Satan is the one that's giving us
[1:58:29] fear he's the one that's causing us to
[1:58:31] be afraid afraid of what I mean maybe
[1:58:33] it's afraid of a church maybe it's
[1:58:34] afraid of a pastoral leadership maybe
[1:58:37] it's afraid of a relationship maybe it's
[1:58:39] afraid of going to make something right
[1:58:41] that was wrong maybe it's whatever it is
[1:58:43] if we've got fear in our lives that's
[1:58:45] not the spirit of Christ there is no
[1:58:48] fear in love but perfect love the love
[1:58:52] we're talking about that's going to be
[1:58:53] over there on beyond the curtain of time
[1:58:55] perfect love casteth out fear
[1:58:59] because fear has torment there's no
[1:59:01] torment there
[1:59:03] why should there be torment here
[1:59:07] fear hath torment
[1:59:09] he that feareth
[1:59:11] is not made perfect in love
[1:59:15] what have we got to fear
[1:59:17] you know maybe I'm crazy I know I am
[1:59:21] I'll give my testimony one day my life
[1:59:24] is upside down totally from the way it
[1:59:26] was actually it's right side up it was
[1:59:27] upside down forgive me
[1:59:29] it truly was totally upside down
[1:59:32] but now it's right side up
[1:59:34] you know brothers and sisters whether we
[1:59:37] live or we die we're Christ if we can
[1:59:39] get the Holy Ghost in our life it
[1:59:40] doesn't matter what we feel it doesn't
[1:59:41] matter whether I Stumble and fall today
[1:59:43] doesn't matter whether I Stumble and
[1:59:45] fall tomorrow I'm going to we all are
[1:59:49] because we're caught in this condition
[1:59:50] but we've got something on the inside of
[1:59:53] the inside that's going to cause us to
[1:59:54] get back up again we're not going to
[1:59:56] stay down because we know where we're
[1:59:58] going and you know as dark and as dismal
[2:00:01] as it gets sometimes we can be so
[2:00:04] burdened by the cares of this life by
[2:00:06] the troubles that we contend with
[2:00:08] whether it's physical or mental or both
[2:00:10] sometimes it's both whatever it is
[2:00:12] brothers and sisters don't be afraid
[2:00:14] it's just a trial of your faith and you
[2:00:16] know what he'll never touch your faith
[2:00:18] you can come to the place where you
[2:00:19] can't even move nothing but your eyes
[2:00:22] you might not even recognize who you are
[2:00:24] but brother Branham says it I don't have
[2:00:26] the quote in front of you but he says it
[2:00:27] you can lose your mind completely but
[2:00:29] still be safe still have the baptism of
[2:00:31] the Holy Ghost Satan can have this flesh
[2:00:34] Canty
[2:00:35] job was told or Satan was told with job
[2:00:37] you can do whatever you want to him but
[2:00:39] don't take his life isn't it interesting
[2:00:41] that he didn't take his mind he just
[2:00:43] Afflicted his body he'd killed all the
[2:00:45] people around him took his family took
[2:00:47] all of his his business took all of his
[2:00:49] finances took him and flipped him inside
[2:00:51] out basically just about literally right
[2:00:54] where he was sitting on that on that
[2:00:56] sacrifice the only thing he could do was
[2:00:57] sit on the ash Heap and say Lord I don't
[2:00:59] know what to do I I feel like I wish I
[2:01:02] wasn't even born but I know you're God
[2:01:04] it doesn't matter what anybody tells me
[2:01:05] my wife says that I should just go ahead
[2:01:07] and curse you and die and I say that
[2:01:09] she's not a foolish woman I say she
[2:01:11] speaks like a foolish woman
[2:01:14] but something on the inside of the
[2:01:16] inside showed him it was just a trial of
[2:01:18] his faith and you know what God knew it
[2:01:19] from the beginning God knew it God said
[2:01:21] have you considered my servant I had
[2:01:23] this conversation with Rory and I said
[2:01:25] to him have you considered my servant
[2:01:28] Rory and he'd never heard that before
[2:01:30] and he marveled at that thought to think
[2:01:33] wow maybe that's what's going on here
[2:01:35] and I said hey he hasn't changed you yet
[2:01:38] in fact when he started to slam you to
[2:01:40] the ground what happened you started to
[2:01:43] serve God I asked him how did you hear
[2:01:44] about the gospel and he said I had this
[2:01:46] Bible I just had this Bible I don't know
[2:01:48] where I got it from I just had this
[2:01:49] Bible
[2:01:50] and once upon a time he got into a uh he
[2:01:53] got hit by a car
[2:01:54] he got hit by a car and flipped up in
[2:01:56] the air and just a terrible thing
[2:01:58] terrible situation on the cloud trail
[2:02:00] and he almost died because of it but
[2:02:03] afterwards when he was recuperating from
[2:02:05] it he was stuck in his room in a
[2:02:07] basement Suite that he was living in he
[2:02:09] said something spoke to him and said go
[2:02:11] pick up that bible
[2:02:13] and he said I don't even know where it
[2:02:14] came from why do I have a bible let
[2:02:17] alone something's speaking to me go pick
[2:02:19] up a Bible
[2:02:20] so he said he went and picked it up and
[2:02:22] and that's where it all started for him
[2:02:24] but isn't that wonderful brothers and
[2:02:25] sisters you see someone that's just
[2:02:26] totally stomped on by this world by
[2:02:29] Satan and the more that it happens the
[2:02:32] the more tremendous their love is for
[2:02:33] the Lord
[2:02:35] God knows exactly what we need he'll let
[2:02:38] us go through exactly what we need to to
[2:02:40] get into our position my goodness you
[2:02:43] know
[2:02:43] um I feel like I'm just gonna have to
[2:02:46] fly I'm getting into my notes now we're
[2:02:48] getting into them
[2:02:50] um
[2:02:50] are we okay
[2:02:52] for a few more minutes
[2:02:54] if we go a little bit over 12 o'clock I
[2:02:56] don't want to keep us too long I know
[2:02:58] it's Mother's Day and we have things to
[2:02:59] get to but
[2:03:02] I don't know
[2:03:04] we'll see how it goes
[2:03:05] Adam he knew his position didn't he
[2:03:08] and out of Genesis chapter 1 verses 26
[2:03:11] to 31 maybe let's just turn there
[2:03:13] still have a few minutes
[2:03:16] let's just go there quick
[2:03:19] I just love it the way the Lord
[2:03:20] expresses stuff
[2:03:23] and uh like I said many times I wonder
[2:03:26] why why that way
[2:03:29] once we have service then I can
[2:03:31] understand it
[2:03:32] Genesis chapter one
[2:03:40] right at the beginning
[2:03:48] verse 26
[2:03:51] and God said let us make man in our own
[2:03:53] image after our likeness
[2:03:56] and let them have dominion over the fish
[2:03:58] of the sea
[2:03:59] and over the fowl of the air and over
[2:04:01] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[2:04:03] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[2:04:05] upon the Earth
[2:04:06] so God created man in his own image in
[2:04:09] the image of God created he him male and
[2:04:11] female created he them
[2:04:14] and God blessed them and God said unto
[2:04:16] them be fruitful and multiply and
[2:04:19] replenish the Earth and subdue it
[2:04:21] and have dominion over the fish of the
[2:04:23] Sea and the fowl of the air and over
[2:04:24] every living thing that moveth upon the
[2:04:27] Earth
[2:04:28] Adam knew his position
[2:04:31] Adam knew exactly where he was and isn't
[2:04:35] it interesting if we were to just go
[2:04:36] back and and look at this this scripture
[2:04:39] that we were just reading
[2:04:42] uh Kieran is our love made perfect that
[2:04:45] we may have boldness in the day of
[2:04:46] judgment because as he is
[2:04:48] so are we in this world as
[2:04:52] he was
[2:04:54] so was Adam in this world Adam was
[2:04:57] created in his own image and he was
[2:04:59] given dominion over the entire Earth and
[2:05:02] he knew exactly what his position was
[2:05:04] and I just think it's such a beautiful
[2:05:06] thing brothers and sisters when we can
[2:05:08] recognize our position and we know that
[2:05:10] in this in this scripture here God he
[2:05:14] looked at it and recognized that this
[2:05:16] was the sixth day that that man was
[2:05:19] created and he said you know it is good
[2:05:21] it's a very good he looked at his
[2:05:23] creation he looked at all that he made
[2:05:25] and there was no mistakes he had no
[2:05:28] errors to correct because that's the way
[2:05:30] God does stuff isn't it he knew that it
[2:05:32] was good and he said it it was very good
[2:05:35] and he was given man was given Dominion
[2:05:38] To Tread down
[2:05:40] and I looked up this you know uh this
[2:05:43] word dominion what does it mean Dominion
[2:05:46] according to the word of God and out of
[2:05:48] strongs it means to tread down that is
[2:05:50] to subjugate specifically to crumble off
[2:05:53] to make to have dominion Prevail against
[2:05:56] rain bear make rule over to rain and
[2:06:00] that word subjugate is to bring under
[2:06:02] Dominion or control especially by
[2:06:04] Conquest
[2:06:06] Adam man was given the Earth we know
[2:06:09] that brother Branham said that Adam was
[2:06:11] God on Earth God was God in heaven Adam
[2:06:14] was God on Earth Adam had the creative
[2:06:16] ability to Simply say oh my that Sun's a
[2:06:19] little bit too hot so let's just get
[2:06:21] that tree over there to move over here
[2:06:23] and just block that sun for a little
[2:06:24] while and then maybe we'll get that tree
[2:06:26] to move over here and block that sun
[2:06:28] when the sun gets over there and maybe
[2:06:30] it's just a little bit too hot and moist
[2:06:31] in the air you know what we just need a
[2:06:33] little bit of a West Wind to just a
[2:06:35] little breeze not too much just to come
[2:06:37] through and just maybe cool it off just
[2:06:39] right and he had that creative ability
[2:06:41] he was able to do that that was the
[2:06:44] power the position that he had and and
[2:06:48] you know how did Adam know about his
[2:06:51] position
[2:06:53] was because God told him so
[2:06:56] and I want to talk about that today
[2:06:57] brothers and sisters you know that for
[2:06:59] sure you know where I'm going with it
[2:07:00] God Has Told You So about your position
[2:07:02] where is your position our position
[2:07:05] isn't in this building and our position
[2:07:06] isn't in our career don't worry about
[2:07:08] the building don't worry about your
[2:07:10] career all those things have to be there
[2:07:12] but where's your position in Christ in
[2:07:13] the day-to-day matters in the situations
[2:07:15] that arise in our lives where are you
[2:07:18] are you in your position according to
[2:07:20] the word of God when your boss tells you
[2:07:22] the wrong thing when when your neighbor
[2:07:23] throws something over your fence that
[2:07:25] you don't like or parks in your parking
[2:07:27] spot out front or you you encounter
[2:07:29] different things in your lives that just
[2:07:31] make you upset where is your position in
[2:07:33] those moments brothers and sisters
[2:07:35] because that's what counts that's where
[2:07:37] the rubber meets the road in our lives
[2:07:39] because as he was in this world so are
[2:07:42] we as he is in this world so are we we
[2:07:46] are one with him just like Adam was with
[2:07:48] his wife there because you know it just
[2:07:51] just as well as I do we we all know it
[2:07:53] it's preaching to the choir I get it but
[2:07:55] we know that all that Adam lost
[2:07:57] we just read it that's what Adam had all
[2:08:00] that he lost has been restored unto man
[2:08:02] again is what brother Branham said and
[2:08:04] you know it's that perfect condition
[2:08:06] it's that perfect love in that perfect
[2:08:08] place and you know
[2:08:10] in this message uh brother Brown I'm
[2:08:13] talking about this beyond the curtain of
[2:08:15] time paragraph 48 he says now friends I
[2:08:18] wasn't asleep
[2:08:19] and and I here we have a prophet of God
[2:08:21] who had encountered so many different
[2:08:23] things in his life right so many
[2:08:25] different Visions so many different
[2:08:26] different experiences Supernatural
[2:08:29] experiences but he's clarifying this for
[2:08:31] a reason for a purpose I believe he says
[2:08:33] now friends I wasn't asleep and I I just
[2:08:35] between you and I and the church here I
[2:08:37] wasn't in a vision
[2:08:39] I know what a vision is some here just
[2:08:41] last week some was many 30 as many as 30
[2:08:44] times a night it would happen you can
[2:08:47] imagine the weight that's on you it
[2:08:49] makes you nervous of course he he
[2:08:51] understood where where he was he
[2:08:54] understood what was happening in in
[2:08:56] terms of it not being a vision and that
[2:08:57] he hadn't fallen asleep and that it
[2:09:00] wasn't just a discernment it wasn't just
[2:09:01] one of the supernatural experiences that
[2:09:03] he's ever had this was a really really
[2:09:05] really special experience that he had
[2:09:09] and you know I just can't help but think
[2:09:10] maybe it is a little bit crazy when you
[2:09:12] go down this road if there's maybe
[2:09:13] somebody that doesn't know about God
[2:09:15] setting a prophet the 20th century
[2:09:16] Prophet William Mary and Bradham maybe
[2:09:18] somebody's watching it on YouTube or
[2:09:19] they watch it later on if you want to
[2:09:22] see whether this lines up with a
[2:09:23] scripture just turn with me over to
[2:09:25] Second Corinthians chapter 12. and we
[2:09:28] can do that we'll just take a moment I
[2:09:29] want to make sure that we do what
[2:09:30] brother Toby did and we we identify a
[2:09:33] scriptural identity to this this is not
[2:09:35] outside of the word in fact this is
[2:09:37] exactly according to the word
[2:09:41] Paul the one who is going to have to be
[2:09:44] judged as well the first church age
[2:09:46] messenger the the messenger to the
[2:09:49] Ephesian Church the one that set the
[2:09:51] pattern the one that laid the foundation
[2:09:54] for the church to be built on
[2:09:57] we still preach what Paul preached and
[2:10:00] anybody that preaches differently than
[2:10:02] what Paul preached I want to say that's
[2:10:04] heresy that's getting outside of the
[2:10:06] word of God
[2:10:11] second Corinthians
[2:10:14] chapter 12 verse 1 Paul speaking he says
[2:10:16] it's not expedient for me doubtless to
[2:10:18] Glory
[2:10:19] I will come to visions and Revelations
[2:10:21] of the Lord we'll get into the deep
[2:10:23] things he says
[2:10:24] I knew a man in Christ above 14 years
[2:10:27] ago whether in the body I cannot tell
[2:10:29] whether out of the body I cannot tell
[2:10:31] God knoweth
[2:10:32] such and one caught up to the third
[2:10:35] heaven and I knew such a man whether in
[2:10:38] the body or out of the body I cannot
[2:10:40] tell God knoweth
[2:10:42] how that he was caught up into Paradise
[2:10:46] and heard unspeakable Words which is not
[2:10:49] lawful for man to utter
[2:10:51] this is exactly according to the
[2:10:53] scripture brothers and sisters but only
[2:10:57] Paul was shown the vision Paul was shown
[2:11:00] the experience Paul was shown the the
[2:11:03] discernment Paul was shown the dream
[2:11:05] whatever we want to call it I'm not
[2:11:07] going to get into that what I want to
[2:11:08] say is that Paul was not allowed to talk
[2:11:11] about it
[2:11:12] boy but we've had a prophet in our day
[2:11:15] that was allowed to talk about it
[2:11:20] Daniel was forbidden to understand it
[2:11:23] Daniel desired to understand it remember
[2:11:26] Daniel was one who was a prophet and he
[2:11:29] desired to know these things he was a
[2:11:32] good man wasn't he a good man he prayed
[2:11:35] and 21 days later the prophet the angel
[2:11:38] came to him and said you know what we
[2:11:40] were just busy fighting the the Prince
[2:11:42] of Persia and we we heard your prayer
[2:11:44] God heard your prayer the moment you
[2:11:46] said it Daniel oh beloved but you know
[2:11:48] we were just busy fighting our way
[2:11:50] through to get to you
[2:11:52] Daniel was one that God loved in Daniel
[2:11:55] 9 verse 2 in the first year of his Reign
[2:11:57] I Daniel understood by books the number
[2:12:00] of the years wherefore the word of the
[2:12:02] Lord came to
[2:12:03] Jeremiah the prophet
[2:12:07] that he would accomplish 70 years in
[2:12:10] desolations of Jerusalem
[2:12:13] and what does he say he says I set my
[2:12:15] face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer
[2:12:19] and supplications with fasting and
[2:12:20] sackcloth and Ashes and I prayed unto
[2:12:23] the Lord my God and made my confession
[2:12:25] and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful
[2:12:27] God keeping the Covenant and mercy to
[2:12:29] them that love him and to them that keep
[2:12:32] his Commandments we have sinned and
[2:12:34] committed iniquity and have done
[2:12:35] wickedly and have rebelled even by
[2:12:37] departing from thy precepts and from thy
[2:12:39] judgments neither have we hearken unto
[2:12:42] thy servants the prophets which spake in
[2:12:45] thy name to Kings and princes and our
[2:12:48] fathers and to all the people of the
[2:12:51] land oh Lord righteousness belongeth
[2:12:54] unto thee but unto us confusion of faces
[2:12:57] as at this day to the men of Judah to
[2:12:59] the inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto
[2:13:01] all Israel that are near and afar off
[2:13:03] throughout all the countries whether
[2:13:05] thou has driven them because their
[2:13:07] trespass that they have trespassed
[2:13:09] against thee O Lord to us belongeth
[2:13:12] confusion of faith to our face to our
[2:13:15] Kings to our princes and to our fathers
[2:13:17] because we have sinned against thee
[2:13:20] to the Lord Our God belong mercies and
[2:13:24] forgiveness though we have rebelled
[2:13:26] against him neither have we obeyed the
[2:13:28] voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his
[2:13:31] laws which he set before us by his
[2:13:33] servants the prophets
[2:13:35] here we have Daniel this righteous man
[2:13:38] pouring his heart out to God he was
[2:13:41] righteous but what was he doing brothers
[2:13:43] and sisters was he scorning his brothers
[2:13:45] and sisters saying oh they don't believe
[2:13:47] the word that I believe they they don't
[2:13:49] worship the way that I worship they just
[2:13:51] don't do things the way that we do
[2:13:52] things so we just can't fellowship with
[2:13:54] them here we have the prophet of God
[2:13:55] making intercession for his brothers and
[2:13:58] sisters knowing that they had willfully
[2:14:00] betrayed God willfully walked away from
[2:14:03] the Commandments of God what a
[2:14:05] tremendous thing it is I just think that
[2:14:07] says that example right there of what
[2:14:09] perfect love is having the ability to
[2:14:11] intercede for our brother and our sister
[2:14:13] and not just say look at them
[2:14:17] Daniel chapter 12.
[2:14:21] this man he says and I heard but then I
[2:14:24] understood not and we know this is the
[2:14:26] the story of Daniel where he's with the
[2:14:28] angel the the one whose countenance was
[2:14:31] just like lightning
[2:14:32] his face Shone like the sun he couldn't
[2:14:35] even stand in his presence he had to
[2:14:38] fall flat on his face as dead and that
[2:14:40] angel of the Lord he put his hand upon
[2:14:42] him and said Daniel oh Daniel though
[2:14:45] thou beloved of the Lord just don't fear
[2:14:47] Daniel come on Daniel just get some
[2:14:49] strength in you and Daniel could only go
[2:14:52] to his hands and knees and gasp for air
[2:14:55] as this Angel stood before him and we
[2:14:57] know it was a covenant Angel it was the
[2:14:58] Lord Jesus Christ himself saying you
[2:15:00] know what Daniel it's just not for you
[2:15:02] Daniel in 12 8 he says and I heard but
[2:15:05] then I understood not then I said oh my
[2:15:07] Lord what shall thee be the end of these
[2:15:10] things and he said go thy Way Daniel for
[2:15:13] the words are closed up and sealed till
[2:15:15] the time of the end
[2:15:17] and brothers and sisters how did he
[2:15:19] understand we read it right at the
[2:15:20] beginning he understood by the reading
[2:15:22] of the books
[2:15:23] he had an understanding and we know that
[2:15:27] he only understood part of it but
[2:15:30] brothers and sisters how much do you
[2:15:31] understand today how much do we have the
[2:15:34] ability to understand today
[2:15:36] to think that Malachi 3 for I am the
[2:15:39] Lord I change not
[2:15:42] therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
[2:15:44] consumed brothers and sisters if we
[2:15:46] think he's got a different program than
[2:15:48] bringing the word of God by the prophet
[2:15:50] to the people were mistaken someone
[2:15:54] somewhere along the way has gotten off
[2:15:56] the the the the main road they're taking
[2:15:58] the the back road trying to get in and
[2:16:01] we know what happens when that happens
[2:16:02] when someone tries to slip in with their
[2:16:04] own wedding garment he's gonna go
[2:16:06] through everyone and greet everyone
[2:16:08] that's there at the wedding Feast but
[2:16:10] there's going to be people that aren't
[2:16:11] wearing the wedding garment he's going
[2:16:13] to say friend how'd you get in here
[2:16:15] and you know what's astounding with that
[2:16:17] is that people are going to be there
[2:16:20] but he's going to go through and he's
[2:16:21] going to count them and he's going to
[2:16:23] see who has his wedding garment and who
[2:16:25] doesn't have his wedding garment and
[2:16:27] that's why I say brothers and sisters
[2:16:29] the only wedding garment that we can
[2:16:30] have is the Holy Ghost in our lives and
[2:16:32] if we try and get into that wedding
[2:16:34] Feast any other way than the way that he
[2:16:36] provides according to the word for our
[2:16:38] day through a prophet just like he did
[2:16:40] through all those other men we're not
[2:16:42] going to get there
[2:16:44] Hosea
[2:16:46] another prophet
[2:16:47] talking about what what what God Said to
[2:16:50] the people through Hosea come and let us
[2:16:52] see return unto the Lord if you want to
[2:16:54] read this at home just for time's sake
[2:16:55] it's Jose Jose 6 come let us see return
[2:16:59] unto the Lord for he hath torn he will
[2:17:01] heal us he has smitten he will bind us
[2:17:03] up after two days he will revive us the
[2:17:06] third day he will raise us up and we
[2:17:07] shall live in his sight then we shall
[2:17:10] know if we follow on to know the Lord
[2:17:12] his going forth is prepared as the
[2:17:15] morning he shall come unto us as the
[2:17:17] rain as the latter and former rain unto
[2:17:19] the Earth
[2:17:21] we read this earlier in our scripture
[2:17:22] here that he pours his his Reign out on
[2:17:24] the just and the unjust brothers and
[2:17:26] sisters he says oh Ephraim what shall I
[2:17:29] do unto thee o Judah what shall I do
[2:17:30] unto thee for your goodness is as a
[2:17:33] morning cloud and as the early do it
[2:17:34] goeth away therefore have I hewed them
[2:17:37] by the prophets I have slain them by the
[2:17:40] words of my mouth and thy judgments are
[2:17:43] gone as the light that goeth forth I
[2:17:46] desired mercy and not sacrifice the
[2:17:49] knowledge of God more than burnt
[2:17:52] offerings
[2:17:55] the only way we're going to get the
[2:17:56] knowledge of God is to have perfect
[2:17:57] faith in the way we're going to get
[2:17:59] perfect faith is to have perfect love
[2:18:00] the only way we're going to get either
[2:18:01] one of those is to have the Holy Ghost
[2:18:03] the only way we're going to get the Holy
[2:18:04] Ghost is to come according to the word
[2:18:06] for our day the only way we're going to
[2:18:08] come according to the word for our day
[2:18:09] is to be baptized in the name of the
[2:18:10] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[2:18:12] our sins then we shall receive the gift
[2:18:14] of the Holy Ghost and to think that we
[2:18:16] could come according to titles that's
[2:18:17] not going to happen it's not going to
[2:18:18] work for us and you know what if we have
[2:18:20] any doubts in our lives all we need to
[2:18:22] do is go forwards and just ask the Lord
[2:18:23] to give us the confidence that we need
[2:18:25] and it might be like I said to just go
[2:18:27] on and get baptized again if that's what
[2:18:29] you need to do then go ahead and do it
[2:18:30] but it's not going to do you any good to
[2:18:32] do it over and over and over again
[2:18:36] just just I guess going forwards with
[2:18:38] the thought about profits it has to be a
[2:18:40] prophet the prophet Joel we know that
[2:18:42] the acts Acts 2 30
[2:18:46] they stumbled as drunk people as they
[2:18:48] came out of the upper room and and what
[2:18:50] did they say what did Peter say he said
[2:18:53] this you know what it's not as you
[2:18:54] suppose we're not stumbling as drunk
[2:18:56] people this is that which the brother
[2:18:58] Joel he prophesied years ago this this
[2:19:01] is what he said would come to pass and
[2:19:04] it's in Joel 2 28-32 it says and and it
[2:19:08] shall come to pass afterward that I'll
[2:19:10] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[2:19:12] your sons and your daughters shall
[2:19:13] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[2:19:15] your young men shall see visions and
[2:19:17] also upon the servants and upon the
[2:19:19] handmaidens in those days I will pour
[2:19:20] out my spirit and I will show wonders in
[2:19:23] the heavens and in the earth Blood Fire
[2:19:25] pillars of smoke and the sun shall be
[2:19:27] turned to Darkness and the moon into
[2:19:28] blood before the Great and the terrible
[2:19:30] day of the Lord till to come
[2:19:33] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[2:19:35] shall call on the name of the Lord shall
[2:19:38] be delivered
[2:19:40] for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall
[2:19:42] be Deliverance as the Lord hath said and
[2:19:45] in the remnant whom the Lord shall call
[2:19:48] and whomsoever shall call upon the name
[2:19:51] of the Lord shall be saved you know
[2:19:53] brothers and sisters we have been given
[2:19:55] such a tremendous thing
[2:19:57] Revelations 10
[2:19:59] verse 7.
[2:20:01] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:20:03] angel
[2:20:05] when he shall begin to sound
[2:20:07] he's already sounded
[2:20:09] he's already sounded brothers and
[2:20:11] sisters the mystery of God is finished
[2:20:15] the the thing that Daniel desired to
[2:20:17] look upon that he he understood by the
[2:20:20] reading of the books but this one thing
[2:20:22] at the end of his ministry he just
[2:20:24] didn't understand it and he desired it
[2:20:26] and we know that the Lord told him
[2:20:28] Daniel it's just not for you you've done
[2:20:30] your prophecy you've done your part
[2:20:32] Daniel just go your way it's for another
[2:20:34] group of people down at the end of time
[2:20:36] they're going to be the ones that
[2:20:38] receive this word they're going to be
[2:20:39] the ones that say oh oh my precious
[2:20:42] brother we're so thankful that you
[2:20:44] stayed true with the word that you
[2:20:46] didn't deviate one iota you didn't go
[2:20:48] one way for money and another way for
[2:20:50] popularity or get mixed up with women
[2:20:52] you stayed right down the middle of the
[2:20:54] road preaching the truth for our day
[2:20:58] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[2:20:59] of God shall be finished as he hath
[2:21:01] declared to his servants the theologians
[2:21:06] the clergyman
[2:21:09] the church
[2:21:10] as he hath declared to the prophets
[2:21:13] right as he hath declared To His
[2:21:15] prophets which means there's coming a
[2:21:17] Time according to the word of God from
[2:21:20] the history books that there's coming a
[2:21:22] time where he's going to bring this word
[2:21:23] to pass
[2:21:25] just makes me think of the one going
[2:21:27] through the the city with the incorn we
[2:21:29] talked about this out of Ezekiel chapter
[2:21:31] 9 and the glory of God of Israel was
[2:21:33] gone up from the Cherub wherever he was
[2:21:35] to the threshold of the house and he
[2:21:37] called to the man clothed with linen
[2:21:39] which had the writer's incorn in his
[2:21:41] side and the Lord said unto him go
[2:21:43] through the midst of the city through
[2:21:44] the midst of Jerusalem instead of Mark
[2:21:46] on the foreheads of the man that sigh
[2:21:48] and cry for the Abominations that be
[2:21:51] done in the midst thereof
[2:21:52] remember we brought this quote brother
[2:21:54] Branham said That's you want an Evidence
[2:21:56] of the Holy Ghost in your life you want
[2:21:57] the evidence are you sighing and crying
[2:21:59] for the Abominations in the land are you
[2:22:01] sighing and crying for our brothers and
[2:22:03] our sisters who maybe just don't have
[2:22:05] the same Revelation are we sighing and
[2:22:07] crying for this world that we live in
[2:22:09] sighing and crying that we could see
[2:22:11] Deliverance for it is that what we're
[2:22:13] doing I'll call the musicians because
[2:22:15] I'll probably easily be able to keep
[2:22:17] going and I know I won't stop if I don't
[2:22:19] so you know what are you crying and
[2:22:21] sighing for the Abominations that are in
[2:22:23] the land and and the others he said
[2:22:27] in mind hearing
[2:22:29] remember he called the one
[2:22:32] who had the ink horn by his side and he
[2:22:33] said set a mark on all those other ones
[2:22:35] now the others he called and he said in
[2:22:38] my hearing go ye after him
[2:22:40] through the city and smite
[2:22:43] and let your eye let not your eyes spare
[2:22:45] neither have ye pity
[2:22:47] slay utterly old and young both maids
[2:22:50] and little children and women
[2:22:53] but come not near any man
[2:22:56] with whom is my mark
[2:22:59] and you know we we can look at this
[2:23:01] brothers and sisters and we know this is
[2:23:02] a spiritual type
[2:23:05] it's happened physically and it will
[2:23:06] happen again
[2:23:08] not the way it did before
[2:23:10] but it's going to happen
[2:23:12] we know that it's going to happen in
[2:23:13] such a way that it will cause the blood
[2:23:15] to flow five feet deep
[2:23:17] as wide as the valley
[2:23:19] it's going to happen there's going to be
[2:23:21] sparing Without Pity and we'll say well
[2:23:24] maybe it's men the world will say well
[2:23:25] it's men fighting men the word of God
[2:23:28] says no it ain't it's Angels slaying men
[2:23:31] but you know it says slay utterly old
[2:23:34] and young both maids and little children
[2:23:36] and women but come not near any man upon
[2:23:40] whom is the mark That's why I want to
[2:23:42] say brothers and sisters get that Mark
[2:23:44] get that Mark that Mark is the token
[2:23:46] that Mark is the holy ghost that Mark is
[2:23:48] Christ Jesus himself in the day in which
[2:23:50] we live and then the next word the next
[2:23:52] sentence of this verse it says and begin
[2:23:54] at My Sanctuary brothers and sisters
[2:23:58] we've got to be willing to surrender
[2:23:59] ourselves to this man with the incored
[2:24:02] we got to be willing to surrender
[2:24:03] ourselves to this word for our day
[2:24:05] otherwise we are going to be slayed it's
[2:24:08] not an option we cannot prevent it
[2:24:10] there's no way that we're going to be
[2:24:11] able to make a way for ourselves to get
[2:24:13] past it you know we know another one
[2:24:16] Saint John was told to seal it up he was
[2:24:19] told go ahead and write John the things
[2:24:21] which you hear and then he was told seal
[2:24:23] up those things which the seventh unders
[2:24:25] uttered and write them not can you
[2:24:27] imagine that
[2:24:28] here we have the prophet of God he was
[2:24:30] there for all of it but he was also
[2:24:31] instructed don't do it because there's a
[2:24:33] group of people there's people that are
[2:24:36] given to know this mystery maybe stand
[2:24:39] with me this morning as we close John
[2:24:41] was given that
[2:24:42] [Music]
[2:24:45] hi yeah I apologize I just got so
[2:24:49] excited about this thinking that you
[2:24:51] know we have the ability to receive the
[2:24:53] word for our day if we do have the
[2:24:54] ability to receive the word for our day
[2:24:56] then we've got every single reason
[2:24:58] shout every single reason to get excited
[2:25:00] and to thank the lord we we are truly
[2:25:05] blessed people not because of anything
[2:25:07] we've done and I would say that anybody
[2:25:10] that can receive the word for this day
[2:25:12] is truly blessed people it's not just
[2:25:14] Calgary Living Word if you can say Amen
[2:25:16] to the word for your day you are truly
[2:25:18] blessed let's just bow in prayer

[2:25:24] thank you for your goodness to us Lord
[2:25:27] we thank you for your Tender Mercies
[2:25:30] Lord for your long-suffering
[2:25:32] Lord Jesus to know that you have given
[2:25:35] us the ability Lord in the day in which
[2:25:37] we live to receive the word that you
[2:25:39] have sent to this age we know that every
[2:25:42] single age was sent a messenger Lord you
[2:25:45] you sent a word to to all of the
[2:25:47] different ages father and there was
[2:25:49] always a group of people willing to
[2:25:51] receive that word and and that word
[2:25:53] through every single age was always
[2:25:55] partial but father at the End of Time
[2:25:58] Lord you you made the word entire it
[2:26:01] wasn't partial and you created a people
[2:26:04] to be willing to receive that word and
[2:26:07] father we thank you for that ability
[2:26:08] because if we have that ability it's
[2:26:10] only because you chose us to be able to
[2:26:13] receive it father Lord I just want to
[2:26:15] ask that we could just examine Our Lives
[2:26:18] Lord Jesus as we go forwards and father
[2:26:20] that we can maybe just think about not
[2:26:22] what's in it for me but what's in it for
[2:26:24] the other person father let us turn the
[2:26:26] tables in this world and think about how
[2:26:28] we can live our lives for other people
[2:26:30] Lord and to not have fear in our lives
[2:26:33] to think that somehow some way we're
[2:26:35] just going to get taken out of here Lord
[2:26:36] we know that you're not just painting a
[2:26:38] picture that you're going to tear up and
[2:26:40] throw on the garbage father we know that
[2:26:42] you're not just creating a song that
[2:26:43] you're just gonna sing sometime and then
[2:26:46] just throw it away father you didn't
[2:26:47] create a people to be on the earth to
[2:26:49] receive your word to just do away with
[2:26:52] them because they've made a mistake in
[2:26:53] this flesh father we thank you that you
[2:26:56] have given us Lord the seal in our lives
[2:26:59] father till the day of our Redemption
[2:27:02] help us Lord not to grieve you help us
[2:27:05] to have the words that we should have
[2:27:06] father that we can speak good words that
[2:27:09] we could recognize the power of our
[2:27:11] voices Lord Jesus father whether we're
[2:27:13] in a group of people or whether we're in
[2:27:15] a car where nobody else is at nobody can
[2:27:18] hear us Lord you can hear us we know
[2:27:21] that you can and father we just pray
[2:27:22] that you would give us the ability to
[2:27:24] just temper our words Lord let our
[2:27:27] thoughts that are expressed father be
[2:27:29] according to your word let them be your
[2:27:32] words father your thoughts being
[2:27:34] expressed through US Lord Jesus as we go
