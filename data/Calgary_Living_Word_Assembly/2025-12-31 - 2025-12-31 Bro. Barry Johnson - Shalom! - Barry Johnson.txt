Id like us to read Psalm 103. Psalm 103 before we start. Um, if you can project it so we can all read together. Uh, it's a bit lengthy, but it's the last service of the year. We're going nowhere. Psalm 103. We can read together from verse one. You good? Just give them a minute. [Music] [Music] Guess we have our Bibles, right? All right, we'll start. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who health all thy diseases, who redeemth thy life from destruction, who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfyth thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles. The Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and pen us in mercy. He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever. He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far as he removed our transgressions from us. Like as a father pityth his children, so the Lord pityth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame. He rememberth that we are dust. As for man's days are as grass, as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children. to such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments, to do them. The Lord had prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over all. Bless the Lord, ye his angels that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts, ye ministers of his that do his pleasure. Bless the Lord, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Amen. Amen. That's our prayer. It's become our song. Amen. Let's go to 721. Start with chorus. When he reached down, he stand for me. When he reached down, he said for me I was lost and ungone without God. Glory when he reach down his hands for me. Oh, once my son was free from the heaven and was wretched and I still [Music] my s your he gave me peace. joy and love when he said for me. Let's go to the second verse. And I was there when he came to me there and he showed me that I will be free. [Applause] [Music] He t my feet and gave me complete [Music] when he reach out his hand for me. How my heart rejoice and how my heart does rejoice. My choice from the tempest to him. Now I [Music] am secure from my heart since he reach out for the course when he reach out. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I was lost and I'm [Music] reaching down his hand for Sees the Lord and sees the Lord [Music] ever [Music] [Applause] to thee [Music] and my all my hand and runs with me.

See, as we read in Psalm 103, is a father that pityth his children, doesn't deal with us after our sins. If he dealt with us after our sins, we won't be here. &gt;&gt; He deserves all the glory. Let's sing that song before we pray. You deserve the glory. You deserve the glory. [Music] Let's lift our hands in worship to worship. As we praise your name, you deserve the glory.

We're maring upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God. And let our song let us down. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] One more time we watching. [Music] [Applause] [Music] We're watching what Jesus [Music] &gt;&gt; once again after sister Amber, sister Stella, brother Mario, myself. [Music] Good evening saints and uh God bless and happy new year to everyone. Um, I'm going to sing the goodness of God and I wish I had all your sisters back up here to help me sing it out. Um, but I wanted to sing the song because it's meaningful to me. Um, one of the lines is all my days have been held in your hands. And, um, when I think back, even the days when I had turned away from God, he still held me in his hands. I know when I look at my career choice, my education, even my divorce through the positive things and maybe those negative things still, you know, he held he held my hand. &gt;&gt; And now as a Christian, you know, I give him thanks for having healed me from my fish allergy and for providing a $20,000 for a car. Um, he's been good to me. He's been so so good and I'm believing now as I move forward for the salvation of my my family. Right. So, um, another line here is, "With every breath that I'm able, I will sing of the goodness of God." And when it came on my heart to sing this song that night, I woke up with a sore throat. But I'm I'm going to sing the song anyways because I'm here to show Satan that he's not the boss. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I'll give this a try. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord, for your mercy never ends. All my days have been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up till I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire in darkest night. You are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. I have lived in the goodness of God. [Music] All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. [Music] Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now. I give you everything. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. [Music] All my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. All my life you have been the faithful. And all my life you've been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. I will sing of the goodness of God. I will sing of the goodness of God. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Come on now. [Music] You always [Applause] my [Music] side. &gt;&gt; By my side, by my side. I have a very big God. He is always by my side. A very big God. By my side. By my side. God bless you church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like brother Daniel, I am over joyous. I'm over happy. &gt;&gt; I've been woriing since morning &gt;&gt; from back home. They have celebrated their new year. &gt;&gt; I am supposed to work today 12 hours and it will be double. My manager will be surprised why I rejected the job today. I said I'm not coming. I just want to use today to say God to say thank you to to my God. &gt;&gt; And the song I sang, braon can interpret to you. I am so happy. I am so glad. This year was so hard for me. Started from January. I was just crying and crying. But at every point, God will faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is faithful. I just want to thank God. And this is my other Jesus. I just want her to come and help me sing a song. Um is a common song. Uh [Music] God bless you church. As you listen, may you be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are all soldiers. &gt;&gt; We are marching to Zion. I have found a friend in Jesus. He's everything to me. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. Glory of the valley. In him alone I sing. All I need to bless and make me fully whole. Sorrow is my comfort. His trouble is my soul. Hallelujah. is the living of the mighty bright soul. All my grief has taken and all my soul is baptis [Music] from my heart and now he gives my love. Oh, all the world forsake me as Satan tells me so. Jesus, I shall reach the glory. Hallelujah. is the really the brightest star. He's the exalt. [Music] He will never never leave me nor yet forsake me. I live my faith and you bless me. Oh my go my holy soul shall be oh sweet to glory blessed graal [Music] is the living the might [Music] of my soul. He's the living the bright and morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. God bless you. Amen. with the Mario. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think I'm the only one alive in here. Say, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So &gt;&gt; I think not I think I believe that I am the spitten image of who he is this tonight. Right. So um I just want to read 2 Corinthians chapter 2 chap chapter 10 sorry from verse 4 through 5. And it says, "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, &gt;&gt; but mighty through God &gt;&gt; to the pulling down of strongholds, &gt;&gt; casting down imaginations and every high things that exalted itself higher, or against the knowledge of God. &gt;&gt; Here is the part that I love. Bringing down, bringing into captivity every thought &gt;&gt; to the obedience of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I it is my routine every morning before I wake up just read a portion of the scripture before I do my devotion. And then this morning this is the chapter that came into my mind and then I read it &gt;&gt; and then I said as a church I I said to me would it be like glorious to live in a church where everybody can be vulnerable to each other and that we'll have nobody will have a problem with that. So and then uh it comes to my mind that as the prophet said the toughest battleground is in our mind and then sometime just one line somebody says and then because we resonate to it and sometime we see that individual as not the person God say he is or she is but what you say he is &gt;&gt; and then I say, "Wow." And then brother brother Paul said it last Sunday. When someone says something maybe it doesn't make sense, maybe you should take time to see that is my that is not my brother, that is not my sister. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit that is behind the statement. And then if you can cast down every bad imagination that you have, &gt;&gt; then maybe you can merge with the Holy Spirit and pray for that individual. &gt;&gt; So it's a song that you you know it's a song that you know. And then brother Fer just uh in Christ alone I want to make a shout for the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. In Christ alone will I glory. Though I could pride myself in battle's war. For I've been blessed beyond measure and by his strength alone I overcome. [Music] Oh, I could stop count successes like diamond in my hand. But those trophies could not equal to the grace by which I stand in Christ alone. I place my trust and find my glory through the power of the cross. In every victory let be said of me, my source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone. [Music] In Christ alone will I glory. For only by his grace I am redeemed. [Music] &gt;&gt; Tender mercy could reach beyond my weakness to my needs. And now I seek no greater honor than just to know you. Hallelujah. To count again but loses to the glory of the Lord. Come on somebody say oh in Christ the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Not somebody &gt;&gt; not to Mohamad &gt;&gt; not to Buddha. not to anybody else. In every victory, let be [Music] my source of hope is my Can I get you please again? In Christ alone will I glory for only by his grace. I can hear you say that &gt;&gt; could reach beyond my weakness to my need. [Music] And now I seek no greater honor than just to know you more. [Music] to the glory. Pray of the Lord. In Christ the Lord I place my trust and find my glory to the power [Applause] in every victory that be said. Hallelujah. My source of hope in Christ Lord. My source of strength. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My source of hope. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is Christ the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Just one more song. Brother Josh, the backing track.

Isn't it wonderful to praise him? &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for this opportunity, Lord. &gt;&gt; One more time to come and exalt your name. &gt;&gt; Father, we know the world is busy running to and fro. So many different things happening and places to go, but Lord, there's something on the inside of the inside that wants to be a part of worshiping you tonight. Father, we recognize what you've done for us. And we thank you, Lord. We can't even contain the praise and the worship that's inside of us, Lord, because of what you've done for us. We're so thankful that you are God, that you are seated on the throne, that you have brought redemption to your bride. And Father, we just want to say thank you. Thank you, Lord, for all that you've done, all that you're going to do. But Lord Jesus, right now in this moment, what you're doing, Father, we give you praise and honor and glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Father, we just want to ask that you would continue to be glorified in our midst tonight, Lord, in all that's said and done as we change the order of the service, Father. Lord, we know we don't want to diminish the the the worship. We don't want to diminish the word. It's all about you, Father. And we thank you for this time that we can have, Lord. We just pray that you would just continue to be glorified now as we turn our eyes upon you in word form. We just ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to keep on singing, but we'll have a little bit of word and then we'll get into some testimony. So, thank you musicians, &gt;&gt; each and everyone for taking the time to come and worship tonight, to come and bring a song special. It really does something. If you have your Bibles, I'd like to read a couple of scriptures. The first one in Psalm chapter 62. Psalm chapter 62. And then Isaiah chapter 60, Psalm chapter 62. Thank you, brother Faren, for taking the service tonight. The song service is tremendous. &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalm 62:1, truly my soul waiteth upon God. &gt;&gt; From him cometh my salvation. &gt;&gt; He only is my rock and my salvation. &gt;&gt; He is my defense. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I shall not be greatly moved. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; How long will ye imagine mischief? mischief against a man. &gt;&gt; Ye shall be slain all of you. As a boowing whale, ye as a boowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence. They only consult to cast him down from his excellency. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Sa my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He only is my rock &gt;&gt; and my salvation. &gt;&gt; He is my defense. &gt;&gt; I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; In God is my salvation and my glory. The rock of my strength and my refuge &gt;&gt; is in God. &gt;&gt; Trust in him at all times, ye people. Pour out your heart before him. &gt;&gt; God is a refuge for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sa, &gt;&gt; let's turn over to Isaiah chapter 60. Isn't that what we did tonight? Poured out our heart before him. My &gt;&gt; what a blessing. Isaiah chapter 60 verse 1. Arise, shine, for thy light is come, &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people. But the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow one more time. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this word. Thank you for this opportunity, Lord, to read it, &gt;&gt; to hear it, and Father, for you to break it open fresh to us once again. We just invite you, Lord, to have the preeminence that you desire in our service, Lord. We pray that you would be glorified now in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. You may be seated. Welcome all of our visitors. Certainly good to have you here with us. It's been a while since we've seen some of you and I know there's folks probably tuned in online. We certainly welcome you as well. We wish everyone a happy new year. We're certainly excited at a time of uh time of reflection when we enter into a a new year. We can look back on the prior year and uh reflect upon the things that have happened to us and we can also look forward to a time of anticipation for what might actually take place in the coming year. And uh you know many times people will look at it from a goal setting perspective. What goals did I accomplish from last year? And other folks will want to look at maybe the the goals that they want to set for the coming year. But tonight, I just want to encourage us to reflect upon the spiritual blessings that the Lord has done for us &gt;&gt; and then look forwards to the anticipation of what the spiritual blessings will be. But most of all, encourage us to remember what the spiritual blessings that are even right now tonight while we're here. You know, brother Brandham talks about it many times in the message about how we can so be so busy focused on what has happened in the past looking backwards and anticipating the future looking forwards but ignoring or missing what's actually taking place right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh you know I was I was just excited talking to a brother about the Lord and how the word can be manifesting even while we yet speak because of the desire of one's heart and how fantastic it is when we have a heart that changes towards the word. It is not something that man can do. And I guarantee you, it's nothing that the devil can do because the devil's never going to lead us to the word. &gt;&gt; The devil's going to take us away from the word. &gt;&gt; And we know that that can simply be by one word off. &gt;&gt; That's why we need to know the word. But I just want to bring you greetings tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And uh certainly thankful to be able to gather together here at the end of the year, the end of 2025. The Lord has done so very very much for us and and I'm excited to get into testimonies. I I really am torn tonight because I want to preach. I really feel inspired after a song service like that. But I'm just going to bring a couple of quotes and a couple of thoughts and then we're just going to get right into testimonies talking about what the Lord has done for us. And uh I want to make sure that we have a little bit of time for that. And um then we'll just have communion and uh see what the Lord will do. It's so amazing when you can actually start preaching at just about 10:00 at night. So, I hope we're all okay. If anybody does feel uncomfortable and you feel like it's getting too late, you're more than welcome to leave. We'll still love you tomorrow. Um, but I think it's wonderful because many times in the world, we'll get together and party like it's 1999. Hey, if you know, you know what I'm saying? Now, I'm not saying that uh because I want to bring that into the church. So, forgive me for that. But what I am saying is that if you know what it's like to party worldly, it don't matter what time it is &gt;&gt; and it don't matter where you're at. &gt;&gt; And it don't matter who is there. And I just couldn't help it earlier in the service. I had to stop being in the back. I had to come out and participate because I I said it even maybe a little bit loud. And I apologize if it was a little bit loud, but we ought to be just as exuberant as everyone else in the world. &gt;&gt; When we get into a situation like this, we're worshiping before the throne of the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; My, if there's a time or a place to get out of order, it's right here &gt;&gt; and right now. And I think it's just so beautiful. So, God bless you all for entering in. It really makes a difference. Tonight, I just want to say one word. I could sum up the whole entire service in one word right now and and I will but I'm going to preach a little bit and and it's this shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. If you know, you know. &gt;&gt; 19640119. Brother Brandham, he says, now my subject this afternoon is in one word. Shalom in Hebrew means peace. Peace or it's a greeting. It's a peace be unto you or welcome, good morning, any kind of a greeting. But the main word I found in the Hebrew here, there is many things it means, but all pertaining to the same thing, &gt;&gt; peace. &gt;&gt; That's why I just I'm I'm so encouraged and I want to just remind us that is what the angel messengers always said, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Many different ways, but mostly fear not. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. What do we have to be afraid of? &gt;&gt; We don't need to be afraid. &gt;&gt; Christ brings peace. &gt;&gt; The devil brings turmoil. &gt;&gt; The devil brings controversy. The devil brings criticism. The devil brings particular problems. But Christ, he brings peace. &gt;&gt; Because it's a message of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not interested in preaching legalism. Legalism is only going to hold us for a little while. And legalism will actually gobble up our children. &gt;&gt; But grace or peace is what will give us the staying power to believe this message. Not just believe it, but actually live it. And you know, if you listen to this message when brother Graham talks about it, I've got a few notable quotes that I'm going to bring about it. But basically in a nutshell, what he talks about in this message is living it. Not just living it through your own power, through a legalistic perspective. Because if we do it through our own power, that's all it is, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's my dos and my don'ts. And and aren't I a good person, especially a Christian. We're all sinners saved by grace. &gt;&gt; And if there's any good thing in us, all that is is Christ. &gt;&gt; Because unfortunately, we all suffer from the same condition. We're stuck in this pest house. And this pest house has Cain's DNA inside of it. &gt;&gt; That's why this flesh will never ever inherit incorruption. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "So we we face this year like we do all years." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a regret of our mistakes in the past. I I would hope that we have a regret for our mistakes in the past. &gt;&gt; Some people will say, "Well, I don't have any regrets." Well, Okay, good for you. It's good to not have any regrets. I think that's a worldly statement though &gt;&gt; because the prophet says that we look back on our regrets. We we we regret the mistakes of our past and looking forward for a future of the glorious light of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He goes on to say, "When we are willing to admit our mistakes that we have done wrong, then he forgives them. &gt;&gt; He is full of grace and mercy to forgive us &gt;&gt; for those mistakes." &gt;&gt; You know, as I read this and and I was listening and studying on this, I just thought, you know, where do we stand with one another? Do we have this level of grace for one another? &gt;&gt; Because remember, Brother Brandham talks about in this message, it's all about Christ living through us. &gt;&gt; Our words are cheap, but our actions, our lives preach the message. And you know, it's very easy to get caught up in this world, brothers and sisters, because there's a darkness in this world. Brother Random talks about in this message, there's a gross darkness upon the people. And you know, we we we read that verse two of of Isaiah chapter 60, it says, "For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and a gross darkness the people, &gt;&gt; but the Lord shall arise upon thee." Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; The Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen where? Upon thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where I think it's just so absolutely amazing. We can we can look at this message and see that his glory is going to be seen upon us. &gt;&gt; And this gross gross gross darkness, Brother Brandham talks about in this message and and you have to go and listen to it. I'm not going to spend a lot of time preaching tonight, but this gross darkness, the meaning of it is an intense or oppressive spiritual or moral darkness. That's what this means in this scripture out of the Amplified Bible. It says, "For behold, darkness shall cover the earth and dense darkness, all peoples, but the Lord shall arise upon you, oh Jerusalem, and his glory shall be seen on you." &gt;&gt; It's a tremendous thing. &gt;&gt; You know, we can't stop prophetic utterance. And and I think that's why we're here tonight because we believe the message of the hour. We believe the word, the prophetic utterance that was brought by the seventh angel messenger. And that's what constrains us to attend a church like this and not the hundreds of other churches in the city. There's so many other churches that we could choose, but something constrains us to come and hear this word because there's a prophetic utterance that came through the seventh angel messenger. And you know, our words are great, but they don't mean anything unless they're saying what the prophet said. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have got to be saying what the prophet said. It was the same thing in the days of Jeremiah. If you look at the story of Jeremiah, there were people that were actually preaching while Jeremiah was locked up. And they were preaching the prophetic utterance that Jeremiah preached. And those people were saved. &gt;&gt; But everybody else perished. &gt;&gt; And it's tough, but it's true because the only word that he brought was get back to God. get back in line with the word. That's how we get back to God. We don't get back to God through a denomination. We get back to God through the word. &gt;&gt; But anything will do when you really don't want to. Any excuse will do when you really don't want to do something. You can say it's a cultural thing. I I've got my former or prior teaching. Whatever it is, I'm just going to stick with that and and we'll just try and see if it works out. But it won't work out. The only way it will work is to actually follow the word. In this message, I was going to bring it, but I I didn't bring the quote. Brother Brandham, he talks about how sometimes people feel like when they die that that somehow God is just going to turn a key in a lock. He's just going to twist that key and our spirit is going to actually change through that turning. And he says very clearly that's not going to happen. The only thing that's going to happen is we're going to change our location. Who we are here is who we will BE THERE. THAT'S WHY we need a body change, brothers and sisters. It's not just a body change. More than a body change. It's a character change. &gt;&gt; It's got to be the life of Christ living out through us. So, if you wonder where I'm going with all this tonight, I want to say, let's get in line with the word maybe more than we ever have in 2026 and see if God won't bless us in a way like maybe we never could have imagined. Amen. &gt;&gt; The wealth and and health is all good, but let's put the word first. &gt;&gt; Let's put the word first and we can say shalom. Peace. God's peace be upon you. &gt;&gt; You know this uh this prophetic utterance doesn't matter how many years go by. Amos 8:11 says, "Behold, the days come, sayaeth the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, and not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but for for for but of hearing the words of the Lord." &gt;&gt; People won't want to hear the words of the Lord. But it it actually goes on to say in verse 12, "And they shall wander from sea to sea and from north, even to the east, they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it." &gt;&gt; That's incredible, isn't it? To think &gt;&gt; many of us just have a Bible on our shelf. We could go and find the Bible, get the Bible out, and read the Bible. But unless we have the spiritual anointing for the age, it's just head knowledge. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's just knowledge. And anybody can go and get knowledge. But we don't want knowledge, do we? &gt;&gt; We want life. &gt;&gt; We want the literal life of Jesus Christ. But the prophecy is that there will be a time where there will be a famine in the land and and so much of a famine, a spiritual famine that people will look for the word of the Lord and they won't be able to find it. &gt;&gt; And you know, it's terrible to say this, but there is a prophet that rose in the United States of America and called people back to the word. &gt;&gt; And as soon as he called them back to the word, what did they do do? They rejected him. &gt;&gt; So he had to preach the indictment and he said, "I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; And how did they do it? How did they crucify him? By ignoring his word. Why? Because it wasn't coming the way they thought it should. Exactly the same way it came originally. That's right. &gt;&gt; Tonight we're talking about his life &gt;&gt; being alive manifest in the flesh living out through each and every one of us. And I want to say we should see his life living out through us. &gt;&gt; Many times it can be many different ways. We've been talking on Wednesdays about gifts and the gifts, the fruits of the spirit. Sure enough, it should be that way. But really, first and foremost, it's got to be the word of God. We've got to have something in us that drives us, constrains us to be in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To take the book and eat it up. There's also a prophecy of light. Even though there's a prophecy of darkness, there's a prophecy of light. In Isaiah 60, verse one says, "Arise, shine. Don't sit down and be dull. Don't run and hide &gt;&gt; because we believe the message of the hour. We don't want to interact with the world. &gt;&gt; We don't want to have friends that are in the world that we talk to because they don't believe the way that we do. So, we can't associate with that. Brother Brandham said, "Don't be strange. &gt;&gt; Just be a good Christian. &gt;&gt; Go be a good human being. Let the world around you see what it is you believe." &gt;&gt; He even talked about it. I thought it was so good. and and we'll bring it, Lord willing, in the future. He talks about, you know, wanting to get out of the mission field and and go and travel to foreign lands to preach the gospel. And sure enough, sometimes we want to do that. But does the mailman know what we believe? Or does the milkman, I think he even says, does the neighbor know what we believe? If those people don't know what we believe, we really ought to be out trying to minister the gospel in a foreign land, should we? But this word says, "Arise and shine, for thy light is come, &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon me." &gt;&gt; I I just think that's so beautiful. As I was reading this and listening to the the the specials and the song tonight being sung, the worship, that's exactly what was happening. A we arose and we're shining because the light has come into our lives. We've got reason to shout &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's such an amazing thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, out of the Amplified Bible, I just wanted to bring this out of the Amplified Bible just for the sake of discussion tonight. Arise from the Amplified Bible, the same verse. from depression, &gt;&gt; from the depression and the prostration &gt;&gt; in which circumstances have kept you. &gt;&gt; Rise to a new life. &gt;&gt; As I was thinking about this and meditating on this, I thought about David, the man who was after God's own heart and how he got with Ba Sheeba &gt;&gt; and he he was an adulterer and he was a murderer. And that baby that they had, God required it of them, didn't he? &gt;&gt; But David was on his face before the Lord. How many of us have ever gone on our face before the Lord with no food and no drink and having people saying, "Come on, just just relax. You know, it's going to get better." &gt;&gt; I know I never have like that. And maybe I'm the only one. I don't know. But the fact is, I just think it's so beautiful thinking about this, how there came a time where the Lord said to David, "Arise from the depression and the prostration in which circumstances have kept you. Rise to a new life." &gt;&gt; And we know that's what David did, didn't he? &gt;&gt; He rose to a new life with a new wife. But we know that in the word, God never called Ba Sheeba David's wife. He always referred to her as the wife of Uriah. &gt;&gt; But we have the ability to rise to a new life, too. And all we got to do is simply follow the word for our day, right? Take the book and eat it up. Revelations 10:1-7, the prophet has come. That's been fulfilled. What about 8 to11? Take the book and eat it up. Give ourselves something to share with this world. It says in here, I'll just read it again. I won't stop this time. Arise from the depression and frustration in which circumstances have kept you. Rise to a new life. Exclamation. &gt;&gt; Shine. Be radiant with the glory of the Lord. For your light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. &gt;&gt; Such a beautiful thing. Unfortunately, I have a history. I've I've I've spent time in the world. New Year's Eve, there's so many different things happening and and so many different ways of participating in in what's going on around the world. But it's just such a wonderful thing to think that we have the desire to gather together in the name above every name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Because we know when we do that, it's not only us just gathering and hoping. He is there in our midst &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. What a powerful thing that is. It is so amazing to think that so many people in this world tonight are groping in darkness, starving for the true word and not even knowing what they're starving for. &gt;&gt; Sure, there's Christians maybe running to and fro looking for the word in different churches and never being able to fall under the leadership, the headship of of the five-fold ministry the way that God has designed it for the people to be perfected, for the saints to be perfected. Maybe there's people like that, but there's also other people that don't even know that there is a word of God, a word from the Lord. They don't even know there is a a a Lord, but there's a knowledge of the word in many cases. But then this is where it gets good for us, brothers and sisters, because we don't worship under just the knowledge of the word. And I know I'm preaching to the choir here now, but what do we do? We actually participate in the knowledge of the anointed spiritual word for our day. And we know that's the true evidence of the Holy Ghost for the believer because it is only a divinely revealed word. Now, some people will say, "Well, Brother Barry, every word of God is divinely revealed." Well, I would say that sure enough, it is, but it's not divinely received. And that's the critical factor. &gt;&gt; I would challenge anybody to go all the way to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and tell me that the message of the hour is false. &gt;&gt; You won't be able to do it. &gt;&gt; That will be impossible. But I guarantee you, you will never be able to say that you accept and receive the message of the hour without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's a paradox. &gt;&gt; You know, I I just want to read what Brother Bradom said. Now, I'm going to rattle off some quotes and and then we'll just change the order of the service if it's okay. I I don't want to be stealing the the whole entire thing tonight, but I just wanted to encourage us, brothers and sisters, to recognize that, you know what? If there ever was a time where we can stand up and say that our light shines, it is today because there is a darkness in the land. It's a gross, gross darkness in the land. It's so dark. Brother Brandham, in this message, I didn't bring the quote. Maybe I'll have to preach shalom. I'll have to do that in the future. I I just want to encourage you. Maybe go listen to it. 1964 0119 Shalom. Brother Random talks about it how how confusing time will be that it will be so dark in the land that men will want to behave like women &gt;&gt; and women will want to behave like men. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't just throw one comment out there. It's a whole paragraph. He talks about it and and brings it right back around and says that this is just the anointing of the age that you know the more you preach it, you go from coast to coast preaching it, you come back and you think that maybe they would get something out of it. It would change. But it doesn't change. &gt;&gt; It gets worse. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't help but think about what would he say if he could see today. &gt;&gt; How gross is the darkness in the land in which we live today? They're changing laws to support that behavior. Right. &gt;&gt; For the Bammy, he says, "But to those who will turn on this New Year's to the light, then you'll get brighter and brighter until that perfect day that we look for is appearing where all darkness will fade faded away. I I personally believe this with all my heart. The more that we look towards the word of God, not just as a knowledge of the word of God, but the anointed, divinely revealed word of God, the word for our day through a vindicated prophet. The more that we do that, the more we don't see the darkness, &gt;&gt; the more that we see the light. &gt;&gt; Let's not give all the credit to Satan in Satan's Eden and say Satan's Eden is so dark and it's so terrible and so depressive. You know what? That's true. But think about the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; They are getting brighter and brighter, brighter than they've ever been. Do you do you do we realize that? This is coming fresh tonight. I think it's so good. The sons and daughters of God have never walked on the face of the earth and shone so bright as they do today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because of this divinely revealed anointed word that we've been given. Isn't that a wonderful thing to think about? &gt;&gt; And it doesn't take gross darkness to actually show it. Alls it takes is a complete submission to the word to be able to show it because we know that we are not ourselves when that happens. When we take the book and eat it up, which is the word for our day, the message for the Leodysian church age. When we're willing to repent when we're willing to be zealous and repent, then we know that his appearing is where all this darkness fades away. We don't see darkness anymore. We see light. We see word. I know. I'll tell you because when I was living in the world, I remember thinking I'm never going to get married and I'll never ever have children because this world is not fit to even rear children in. &gt;&gt; But not for the believer. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Not for the true believers, the believers of this word. They recognize that there is a keeping power. There is a light. There is a life. Something that will sustain them and watch over their children. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We're looking for that day, his appearing, where all this darkness will fade away. And the reason of that is why I say to the church of the living God today, shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Because we are his lights. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Jesus said, "Ye are the light of the world." Brother Brandham talks in his message about how how first there has to be a heavenly sign that takes place first and then the earth earthly vindicates that heavenly sign. I I want to say you know we we can say this we know it. Don't we know it &gt;&gt; that there was a heavenly sign that happened right &gt;&gt; now? Where is the earthly sign? Where is the earthly vindication of that heavenly sign? It's not just don't put it just put it off on brother Brandham and say well he had a tremendous ministry. The whole purpose of his ministry was so that we could be those lights shining in the day in which we live. &gt;&gt; I'll say this, there was a heavenly sign that manifested through William, Mary, and Brandham. But there was a purpose for that. And that purpose, brothers and sisters, is so that tonight we could be the earthly vindication of that heavenly sign. &gt;&gt; And if that's not happening, we've missed the point of the message of the hour. We have missed it. You know, in the beginning, God separated the light from the darkness, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Naturally speaking, let's think about that spiritually. My goodness. Spiritually speaking, we are the separators &gt;&gt; of the darkness in this world. &gt;&gt; Isn't that an amazing thought? You are the separator of the darkness in the world in which you live. That's why people, they apologize when they swear in your presence and they've never even met you. &gt;&gt; They recognize there's something different here. &gt;&gt; I don't know what's taking place. That's why people feel uncomfortable sometimes. That's why people sometimes have absolute rage for no reason in our presence &gt;&gt; because they don't recognize what's going on. But it's not flesh and blood that we're wrestling against, is it? &gt;&gt; But we are the spiritual separator. &gt;&gt; And it's not us. It's God in us. &gt;&gt; Let's be clear. It's his life. It's his light living out, shining out through us. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham Shalom. He says, "And so it is today that gross darkness is coming upon the people. And here we are. God has lauded his word to be manifested this day. And it's the only light we have. And God is going to let somebody manifest that word. &gt;&gt; Who wants to manifest that word tonight? &gt;&gt; Shalom, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Shalom. God has loted his word to be manifest this day. And it's the only light we have. And God is going to let somebody manifest that word. Somebody is going to do it. Right. &gt;&gt; I think that song Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; my &gt;&gt; someone's going to do it. He promised it and he works just exactly like he always did by it. &gt;&gt; He has never changed his pattern of work. If we could just take this into our lives and recognize that he doesn't change. He's never changed. He can never change. He prophesies what will happen. &gt;&gt; Then he sends somebody down and vindicates that. Like I said, don't don't don't take it as brother Brand Brother Barry is saying that God prophesied, brother Brandham, Malachi, and and and and Revelation. We're not doing that tonight. We're talking about us. This is about the church of the living God, not about a prophet. We're not going backwards. We're going forwards. &gt;&gt; I want us to recognize what we are doing here. He has never changed his pattern. He prophesies what will happen. There's going to be someone that will manifest this word. That's what he said. He sends somebody down and vindicates that. &gt;&gt; So, I want to say tonight, brothers and sisters, each and every one of you are a vindication of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here tonight, ain't it? Yes, &gt;&gt; we came to manifest that word because we believe it &gt;&gt; and it goes over the head of millions &gt;&gt; because darkness covers the earth at that time. So, if you catch kind of where brother Barry is at tonight, I'm I'm just celebrating this word. Shalom, peace to the church of the living God. If we have this word, we are the living manifestation of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. It's so much more than books and tapes. It's so much more than quoting quotes. It's the literal living Jesus Christ on earth again manifesting in flesh. And it goes over the head of millions because darkness covers the earth at that time. And people love darkness better than they do light &gt;&gt; because darkness has a lot of pleasure. And you know, there's many people that understand that darkness has a lot of pleasure. The devil always tries to make it look appealing and attractive and and and and and and once you actually taste of this heavenly gift, brothers and sisters, it's impossible, impossible for you to turn away. &gt;&gt; We talked about that before. Brother Brandham doesn't say that it's impossible for you to ever be restored again. He says that it's impossible for you to ever turn away from it if you ever taste of this heavenly gift. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says your life proves whether Jesus is with you or not. Your words don't prove it. Our words don't prove whether Jesus is with us or not. Otherwise, he would have said that. He would have said your words prove whether Jesus is with you or not. Your life proves whether Jesus is with you or not. Your life shows whether he is occupied here or whether he's still in his heavens or not. I think that's powerful. &gt;&gt; I think it's encouraging because brothers and sisters, we don't want to just quote quotes. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just say we believe God sent a prophet. What good is that? &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil believes that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But the devil can't contend when we say, "Be it unto me according to thy word." And it's literally the literal life of Jesus Christ via the Holy Spirit living out through us. The devil can't contend with that. &gt;&gt; The devil has to flee. Your life proves whether Jesus is with you or not. Your life shows whether he is occupied here or whether he is still in his heavens or not. Whatever you are, the works that I do shall you do also. &gt;&gt; How could you have Christ in you and then the very spirit in you deny his word? &gt;&gt; Take up a creed instead. &gt;&gt; And I'll say take up a tradition instead &gt;&gt; or take up a teaching instead or take up a substitute instead. &gt;&gt; Say, well, I I'll just do this instead. I'll just do that instead. How could it literally be the same spirit? It can't be the same spirit. He's not going to deny his own word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He'll never deny his own word. And you know what's so good? I want to say this, brothers and sisters, just to be clear because I can feel it. Even though we fall, it doesn't mean that we don't believe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're not struggling, the devil's got you. If you're fighting, keep fighting. &gt;&gt; If you're fighting, keep surrendering to the Lord. Keep surrendering to the word. Keep dying to yourself daily so that he can live. And I want to SAY IN 2026, DO IT MORE. I WANT TO DO IT MORE. I want to see more of God in my life. &gt;&gt; But some might say, well, oh my, it's so hard. I don't see Christ. Many times I see my flesh. I see problems. I see circumstances and situations. &gt;&gt; Just get back up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't stay down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just get back up and get going. &gt;&gt; Get back up and trust the Lord. If you're not fighting, if you're not tripping, if you're not falling, the devil's got you. &gt;&gt; He's got you right where he wants you. Because you know what the devil will do? He'll put a religious spirit on you and make you feel like everything in my life is perfect. &gt;&gt; I saw something recently and I thought, "Wow." You know, when you see someone that's perfect in their life, they work so hard to polish their image and have just a perfect image in their life. Watch that guy. &gt;&gt; Watch that guy &gt;&gt; because there's something wrong &gt;&gt; somewhere. Every human has a fault. We've all got a punch coming is what the prophet said from the devil. But we've got to be willing to accept that and just trust the Lord with it. &gt;&gt; I just love how brother Bannam being the mouthpiece for the Lord, the the voice box to the age, if you will. But to the elected, precious and called saints of God, I say to you this coming year, shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I ain't trying to scold us tonight. I'm trying to encourage us to recognize our position. We are the slicers of the darkness. We're the separators of this gross darkness that's on the land that's upon the land. And it's so beautiful because brothers and sisters, even though we can't see it, I guarantee you the devils can see it. &gt;&gt; And every once in a while, we might be able to get a little glimpse of it. You might have seen it once in a while. We hear stories. Anybody ever heard a story about someone seeing the pillar of fire? someone seeing just a little bit of something that's just a little different, a little supernatural. Don't think that's crazy or superstitious. &gt;&gt; Believe it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it in every one of his meetings. There it is. And it's over top of that person. And we know that that's exactly what it is. Let's not take and make that picture of William Mary and Brandham and and just hang it into our own hall of fame and say that picture is great. Let's put it on the wall and keep it there. Let's say that picture was an example for me. Even though I can't see it or necessarily feel it, that pillar of fire is resting above me. That pillar of fire is actually resting in me. But think about it, how amazing it is when we live in the city of Calgary, how we can just slice through all the darkness in this world that we're living in. But then when we bring all of those little pillars of fire together, what happens here is we have one ginormous pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; whether we can see it or not. There is a spirit of God here. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandaman says, he goes on to say, "And there is a light of the hour today." That's Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection, his word that's promised for this day. And we are the literal vindication of that word. It's just so beautiful. Just so beautiful. My I just I just got into this and I was just like a kid in a candy shop. I apologize with so many quotes tonight. It's just so so beautiful. Brother Badami says, "And all all the New Testament speaks of this." I'm I'm going to wrap up here with this these these these last two quotes here. I'm going to end with this. Shalom 1964. All the New Testament speaks of this hour. Jesus Christ speaks of this hour. &gt;&gt; We know that John spoke of this hour and Daniel spoke of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the New Testament speaks of this hour. Jesus Christ speaks of this hour. Who is it then? Some man. It's Jesus Christ, the son of God, manifesting, reflecting the light on the word that he promised for this day. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Again, let's not put it off on Brother Brandham and say, "Well, this was him, the prophetic office, 1964." No, no. Let's bring this right up here to today. This this was food stored up for a time when there would be a famine in the land. &gt;&gt; Don't think that God is any different. Just like he was manifesting in the days of Joseph when there was the the dirt upon the land, seven years of good and seven years of bad. Don't don't think that the spiritual famine we would have no no ability to actually feed upon this word. This is a feast spiritually speaking, brothers and sisters, for the day in which we live. When a man see you living like him, when he sees your your what? &gt;&gt; Character and your conduct with the word just exactly like he was the word being manifested. Then man will see Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now we can go back to the discussion we had a couple minutes ago where I said, you know, what about when we fall? What about when we make mistakes? What about when we're human? He knew exactly who we would be, exactly where we would be at, and exactly all of the genetic predispositions that would be manifesting in our life that the devil is going to try and play on because he knows exactly where we came from, all of our parents and grandparents and great-grandparents and all of the history, all the darkness that's upon the land, especially in this flesh. That's why we need a new birth. We have to have a new birth. There's no no exemptions, no exceptions. There's no other way or truth or life. We have to be born again. But you know, when we do fall, when we do say those things, when we do spit that venom with our mouths, when we do actually make mistakes, what do we do? That's the difference maker. Because the believer is going to go make it right. &gt;&gt; The believer is going to look back and say, "Uhoh." because I hear the Holy Ghost telling me, "You did that wrong. You got to make that right. I'm going to go make that right." That's what the believer is going to do. And that's the difference maker. The ones that say, "No, no, no. I'm just going to sweep it under the blood. Lord, please forgive me for my sin and, you know, have a nice day and we'll just get on with life." Those are the ones that are dragging around condemnation. Those are the ones that are holding on to things that they don't even know they're holding on to. But sooner or later, it's all coming to the surface. It's all going to boil over one of these days. And God will not will not allow a son or daughter of God to continue on that path. &gt;&gt; He will always make sure that we make it right. But here we are talking about the word being manifested. This is such an extreme level, an extreme level of belief. We are the word made flesh today. That is what the scriptures say. We sing that song all the time. Do we believe that with all of our hearts? &gt;&gt; We are the generation, the final voice to the final age. Not the ministry, not the five-fold ministry, but each and every one of us. Those those those separators of darkness. I think that's so beautiful. I'm going to continue with that. That's so amazing to think about. But it's about the word being manifested and then man will see Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; because they'll see a man that has faults and failures, that has trials and tribulations, that has shortcomings and failures, &gt;&gt; but is willing to admit them. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; To look themselves squarely in the mirror and admit them. &gt;&gt; Without that admitting, there's no hope. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right. &gt;&gt; But it first takes that surrender to oneself will to say, "Hey, I know I'm a skunk. I know I'm a scoundrel. I know that I did this and I did that &gt;&gt; and I'm going to make it right. &gt;&gt; Even if it embarrasses me. Oh my. Even if it tarnishes my image, my self-image. Oh no." That's exactly what Christ wants &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want us to have our image. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we are the word, &gt;&gt; he wants us to have his image &gt;&gt; ambassadors for him, &gt;&gt; the word being manifested, then then man will see Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They won't have to look around anywhere else and say, "What what does this creed teach? What does that creed teach?" They'll they'll know exactly what God is when they see &gt;&gt; you. Woo! &gt;&gt; What a powerful message this is. Final quote here. Brother Brandham says, "Shalom, God's peace and light be upon you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when God's word is vindicated in this age completely and you see it and believe it, shalom to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Face the new year with this. put him as David said, I'll put him always before me. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Farah, for reading the Psalms. I think that's so beautiful. &gt;&gt; I'll put him always before me because he is on my right hand. I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; If you meet death this year, what difference does it make? Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's such a heavy thing to say, &gt;&gt; but really, what difference does it make? &gt;&gt; God promised he would raise you up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If an accident kills you, what difference does it make? &gt;&gt; You have eternal life. &gt;&gt; I'll raise him up at the last days. Amen. &gt;&gt; What if anything happens? No matter what it is, nothing can separate us from the love of God &gt;&gt; that's in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hunger, peril, nakedness, no matter what it is, nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ. &gt;&gt; And he is the word. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say tonight, brothers and sisters, shalom. &gt;&gt; God's peace. &gt;&gt; Let it be upon you in 2026. And I pray that when we do this next year, if the Lord should terry, that we'll just have way more testimonies &gt;&gt; than we'll even know what to do with. &gt;&gt; I know the Lord has been so good to us in 2025. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm I'm excited to celebrate that tonight. We're going to we're going to change the order again. We'll just open it up to testimonies. I want to take a few minutes and just give us an opportunity to testify about what the Lord has done for us just so we have an idea for time. I'll give us I'll give us 40 minutes. We'll do 40 minutes and uh then we'll actually change the order and we'll go into a communion service at that point. So instead of saying a number of testimonies, we'll simply say we've got 40 minutes. So, if you have a testimony that you would like to bring about what the Lord has done for you in your life, I just would like to request that you do it timely. Please don't preach a sermon. Just simply say what the Lord has done for you and then give someone else an opportunity because there's many, many testimonies in our midst here. Somebody tonight have a testimony they'd like to share about what the Lord has done for them in 25. I I know. Brother Aiden, brother Joel, we got two. Sister Stella. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh, God bless you all. I never take for granted the health of my family. So, I'm just extremely grateful that my children are doing well in school. Elias skipped a grade and he's doing excellent in the next grade, which I we were praying about for a long time. um many many many things God has done for us uh even with our our acreage and challenges we had there &gt;&gt; and he's always provided a way of escape and um also Uh,
