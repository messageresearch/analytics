[34:48] study and the exposition of the seven
[34:50] Church
[34:51] ages Revelations chapter
[34:54] 3 we're dealing with the Philadelphian
[34:57] Church age and it's amazing to me
[35:00] because the Philadelphia Church age
[35:02] according to this book is almost
[35:04] finished and then we move on to the
[35:06] leoan church and then we're done I mean
[35:10] we have the resume of the ages one of
[35:12] the best parts of it but you know it
[35:15] it's just amazing to me what I'm getting
[35:16] at is how quickly it's gone by how it
[35:19] seems quick many people are probably
[35:21] groaning saying brother Barry it's over
[35:24] a year can we just get on to something
[35:26] else and maybe that's the case but this
[35:30] has just a been a wonderful study just a
[35:32] wonderful
[35:33] study Revelations chapter 3 verse
[35:38] 7 and to the angel of the church in
[35:41] Philadelphia write these things saith he
[35:44] that is Holy he that is true he that
[35:47] hath the Key of David he that openeth
[35:50] and no man shutteth and shutteth and no
[35:53] man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I
[35:57] have set be before thee an open door and
[36:00] no man can shut it for thou Hast a
[36:02] little strength and Hast kept my word
[36:06] and Hast not denied my
[36:09] name behold I will make them of the
[36:12] synagogue of Satan which say they are
[36:15] Jews and are not but do lie behold I
[36:19] will make them to come and worship
[36:22] before thy feet and to know that I have
[36:25] loved thee because thou Hast kept the
[36:29] word of my patience I also will keep
[36:32] thee from the hour of Temptation which
[36:35] shall come upon all the world to try
[36:37] them that dwell upon the Earth behold I
[36:42] come quickly
[36:44] whoops sorry about that hold that fast
[36:48] which thou Hast that no man take thy
[36:51] crown him that overcometh will I make a
[36:54] pillar in the temple of my God and he
[36:57] shall go no more out and I will write
[37:00] upon him the name of my God and the name
[37:04] of the city of my God which is New
[37:08] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[37:10] Heaven from my God and I will write upon
[37:14] him my new name he that hath an ear let
[37:19] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[37:23] churches let's just bow one more time
[37:25] heavenly father thank you for Lord ears
[37:28] to hear what your spirit says thank you
[37:30] for the open door Lord Jesus that you've
[37:32] placed before us knowing Lord that's
[37:35] Revelation that we have father and we
[37:38] can walk through that door and we thank
[37:40] you for it Lord Jesus no man can shut
[37:43] that door or open it because you are the
[37:45] one that placed it before us help us
[37:48] Lord to just step through that door one
[37:50] more time tonight father we love you and
[37:53] we thank you we commit this word into
[37:55] your hand in Jesus Christ name we pray
[37:58] amen God bless you tonight you may be
[38:03] seated just uh couple of announcements
[38:07] before we get going we have the Youth
[38:08] Event on the 15th I believe that's this
[38:12] Sunday and uh December the 22nd we have
[38:17] a special guest speaker and uh we're
[38:20] certainly excited to hear what the Lord
[38:21] has placed upon his heart and uh it's
[38:24] awfully quiet I love the suspense
[38:27] brother John panicker is actually gonna
[38:29] take the service our brother's a
[38:31] minister and uh he's kept it under wraps
[38:34] but you don't have to guess very much
[38:37] when you spend some time in fellowship
[38:38] with our brother to know that he knows
[38:40] the word really well and what's even
[38:44] more I think is wonderful is that the
[38:46] word knows him just like every one of us
[38:49] so um he's expressed a desire and uh I
[38:53] could sense it and so I invited him to
[38:55] take a service and uh yeah I trust it'll
[38:57] be a real blessing we've talked a little
[38:59] bit about what the Lord's placed on his
[39:00] heart and I'm just going to leave it at
[39:03] that so pray for Brother John panicker
[39:05] and his family and uh we'll certainly
[39:07] trust the Lord will speak to us we have
[39:10] the communion service coming up on the
[39:12] 31st it's a communion testimony service
[39:14] so it could be a little bit longer we
[39:16] just want to give room for the spirit um
[39:18] if people want to bring specials uh
[39:20] we're more than welcome to do that we
[39:22] don't want to put a rush on things we
[39:24] just want to have a little bit of time
[39:27] uh for our communion and testimony
[39:28] service maybe a few specials some praise
[39:31] whatever um let's just get together and
[39:34] fellowship around the Lord while the
[39:36] rest of the world goes out and parties
[39:39] in a new year and uh parties away their
[39:42] life and celebrates uh false sense of
[39:46] security because we know this world is
[39:49] fit for judgment so the 31st we'll have
[39:51] a community testimony service and there
[39:52] will be no service on January the 1st
[39:56] because the 31st is just before that and
[39:58] I'm sure if things go well we'll wake up
[40:00] hung
[40:02] over but hung over in the
[40:05] spirit that's how preachers feel Monday
[40:09] morning it's uh yeah we're just going to
[40:11] cancel the service on on the first I
[40:13] hope that's okay with everyone and uh
[40:16] that might give us time to go and
[40:17] fellowship after the service if we don't
[40:18] go till midnight we just want to make it
[40:21] as uh easy as possible for everyone to
[40:23] just have a good time so God bless you
[40:26] tonight um remember Cadre Diggs he says
[40:29] hello and uh he has has us on his radar
[40:33] for some time in February so we trust
[40:35] the Lord will open up the door for him
[40:37] to come there's something else that I
[40:39] wanted to mention I've kind of had it on
[40:41] my heart and uh I trust it will be okay
[40:44] as well um if you have any questions
[40:47] about what we've preached what we've
[40:50] talked about out of the exposition of
[40:51] the seven Church ages what I want to do
[40:54] is open up an opportunity for questions
[40:57] and answers on the seven Church ages so
[41:01] if you have questions please by all
[41:04] means write them down put them in the
[41:06] offering put them in the offering when
[41:08] it's handed around put it in an offering
[41:10] box just write your question down on the
[41:12] prayer request sheets or if you have
[41:14] your own sheet put it in the offering
[41:16] box and the deacons will give it to me
[41:18] you can make it Anonymous or not um we
[41:22] don't want to have contentious problems
[41:25] but if you have issues that you just
[41:27] don't understand something that maybe
[41:29] just isn't clear just put it in there
[41:31] and we'll pray about it and we'll
[41:33] actually have a questions and answers
[41:35] service or services on this book I
[41:39] believe there's so much in here
[41:40] personally I believe we should have a
[41:42] series of Services of questions from
[41:45] this book I know there's things in there
[41:46] that I might have a question on and I
[41:49] might actually throw my question into
[41:51] the offering box just for fun just
[41:54] because there's things that I think
[41:55] really um they really worth taking some
[41:59] time to explain so um if you have
[42:01] questions already write them down if not
[42:03] um if it comes up by all means write it
[42:06] down I'm going to take some time it's
[42:09] not going to be a rush uh it'll come up
[42:11] after we finish this book just so we can
[42:13] take some time and study and accurately
[42:15] answer to the best of our ability
[42:18] according to the word and the spirit so
[42:20] God bless you tonight I trust everyone
[42:23] is doing well by God's grace we know
[42:26] we've had some illnesses going around
[42:28] and it's kind of the season for it
[42:31] unfortunately it's not a pleasant thing
[42:33] but um we know we have a Healer
[42:37] certainly
[42:38] tremendous tonight I just want to carry
[42:40] on where we left off I'm going to go
[42:42] back just a little bit from where we
[42:44] left off um in the exposition of the
[42:47] seven Church ages the Philadelphian
[42:48] Church age we got into the age of the
[42:51] open door and I just believe we could
[42:54] preach a series on that the age of the
[42:56] open door and that Open Door brothers
[42:58] and sisters we've been given sunset
[43:00] Mountain a door was open In Heaven There
[43:03] was a revelation John was called a
[43:05] little higher and we know it was through
[43:07] the opening of them Seven Seals when
[43:09] those seven angels met him and told him
[43:12] come up higher now go back and get into
[43:15] your position because there's going to
[43:17] be an open door for a bunch of people to
[43:19] come in for the bride to come in we are
[43:22] in the age of the open door and we know
[43:24] brother bradam is talking about the
[43:25] Philadelphia and church age but he also
[43:27] says every single Church age applies
[43:30] consecutively to Future Church ages so
[43:33] we can take this word and apply it to
[43:35] our very lives I think it's so
[43:37] beautiful where we left off last time um
[43:41] so we can see by the comparison of
[43:43] scriptures that this Open Door signified
[43:47] the greatest spreading of the Gospel
[43:49] that the world has ever seen and it's
[43:53] just a tremendous thought what really
[43:55] happened in the Philadelphian Church age
[43:57] the Bram gets into it a little bit later
[43:58] we'll get there um carrying on though he
[44:01] says I want you to see something here
[44:03] God works in
[44:05] threes doesn't
[44:07] he it was in the third or pergami and
[44:10] age that the church was married to the
[44:13] state the Deeds of the nicotin had
[44:17] become the doctrine of the
[44:19] nicotin that age was the open door for
[44:23] the false Vine once it was backed up by
[44:26] the power of the state it became
[44:30] actually a word system even though it
[44:34] bore the name
[44:35] Christian thus it spread like wildfire
[44:39] but now Three Ages later after a long
[44:42] and hard struggle of Faith here comes
[44:45] the open door to the
[44:47] truth the word of the Lord now has its
[44:51] day of course the fifth age had set the
[44:55] stage for this Mighty move
[44:57] as that age give us exploration
[45:00] colonization the printing of books
[45:04] Etc it would have been wonderful if this
[45:06] Open Door had followed the Divine
[45:09] pattern of Pentecost which was set forth
[45:12] in Hebrews chapter
[45:14] 2 therefore we ought to give the more
[45:17] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[45:19] heard lest at any time we should let
[45:22] them slip for if the word spoken by
[45:24] Angels was steadfast and every trans
[45:26] transgression and Disobedience received
[45:29] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[45:33] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[45:38] which at the first began to be spoken by
[45:40] the Lord and was confirmed unto us by
[45:42] them that heard him God also bearing
[45:45] them witness both with signs and wonders
[45:49] and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of
[45:52] the Holy Ghost according to his own
[45:55] will now you know that this is the
[45:58] pattern for Jesus himself said
[46:02] so Mark 16:15 to20 and he said unto them
[46:06] go ye into all the world and preach the
[46:08] gospel to Every Creature he that
[46:11] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[46:14] but he that believeth not shall be
[46:18] damned and these signs shall follow them
[46:21] that believe in my name they shall cast
[46:23] out Devils they shall speak with new
[46:26] tongues
[46:27] they shall take up serpents and if they
[46:30] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[46:32] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[46:35] and they shall
[46:37] recover so then after the Lord had
[46:40] spoken unto them he was received up into
[46:44] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[46:48] and they went forth and preached
[46:51] everywhere the Lord working with them
[46:54] and confirming the word
[46:57] with signs
[46:58] following I think it's beautiful thought
[47:01] here how when we look at this it just
[47:04] really stood out to me how did the Lord
[47:07] work with them they went forth and
[47:09] preached everywhere the Lord working
[47:12] with them and confirming the
[47:15] word he was confirming the word he
[47:18] wasn't confirming the signs and wonders
[47:20] he wasn't confirming the the ministry of
[47:23] the of the hierarchy of the Bishops and
[47:26] the Elders right he confirmed the
[47:30] word and when we can put the word first
[47:33] brothers and sisters that's the critical
[47:35] factor to our existence as Believers of
[47:38] this message when we put the word first
[47:41] that's what he will
[47:43] confirm the signs and wonders will
[47:45] follow they actually have to follow it's
[47:48] not like an option it's not even
[47:50] optional that's the pattern that he set
[47:52] forward I think it's just such a
[47:54] beautiful thing
[47:57] they went forth preaching everywhere the
[47:59] Lord working with them and confirming
[48:02] the word with signs following
[48:05] amen he never told them to go into all
[48:08] the world and establish Bible
[48:11] colleges nor did he tell them to pass
[48:14] out
[48:16] literature now those things are fine but
[48:20] what Jesus told them to do was to preach
[48:23] the gospel stick with the word
[48:27] and then the signs would follow the very
[48:30] first introduction we have in the way
[48:33] the kingdom of God was to be preached
[48:35] was when he sent out the 12 in Matthew
[48:39] 10 1-8 he commissioned and instructed
[48:42] them on this wise and when he had called
[48:46] unto him his 12 disciples he gave them
[48:49] power against unclean spirits to cast
[48:51] them out to heal all manner of sickness
[48:54] and all manner of disease
[48:58] now the names of the twel Apostles are
[49:00] these the first Simon who was called
[49:03] Peter and Andrew his brother James the
[49:05] son of Zebedee and John his brother
[49:08] philli and Bartholomew Thomas and
[49:10] Matthew the Publican James the son of
[49:14] alfus and lius whose na surname was
[49:18] tatus Simon the Canaanite and Judas es
[49:22] scariot were who also betrayed him these
[49:26] 12
[49:27] Jesus sent forth and commanded them
[49:30] saying go not into the way of the
[49:32] Gentiles and into any city of the
[49:35] Samaritans enter ye not but go rather to
[49:39] the lost sheep of the House of Israel
[49:43] and as ye go preach saying the Kingdom
[49:46] of Heaven is at hand heal the sick
[49:48] cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast
[49:50] out Devils freely ye have received
[49:54] freely give and we know that they were
[49:58] called to the lost sheep of the House of
[50:00] Israel and Paul was sent to the
[50:04] Gentiles he goes on to say this ministry
[50:06] that he gave them was actually the
[50:08] sharing of his own Ministry with
[50:12] them and Jesus went about all the cities
[50:16] and Villages teaching in their
[50:17] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[50:19] the kingdom and healing every sickness
[50:22] and every disease among the people but
[50:25] when he saw the multi dudes he was moved
[50:27] with compassion on them because they
[50:29] fainted and were scattered abroad as
[50:31] sheep having no Shepherd then saith he
[50:34] to his disciples the Harvest truly is
[50:37] plenteous but the laborers are few pray
[50:40] ye therefore the lord of the Harvest
[50:42] that he will send forth laborers into
[50:45] his Harvest Matthew 9:35 to
[50:50] 38 now many people have the idea that
[50:53] just the apostles had this ministry
[50:55] given to them by our our lord Jesus and
[50:58] so when they died the ministry was
[51:02] over that's not so here in Luke 10 veres
[51:06] 1-9 we find that in the days of his
[51:08] Earthly sojourn he had already started
[51:12] to give ministries of power to his own
[51:16] Luke 10 1-9 after these things the Lord
[51:20] appointed other 70 also and sent them
[51:24] two and two before his face into every
[51:26] city and place whether himself would go
[51:31] therefore said he unto them the Harvest
[51:33] truly is great but the laborers are few
[51:35] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[51:37] Harvest that he would send forth
[51:39] laborers into his
[51:42] Harvest go your ways behold I send you
[51:45] forth as Lambs Among Wolves carry
[51:49] neither purse nor script nor shoes and
[51:53] salute no man by the way and enter
[51:57] whatsoever house ye enter first say
[52:00] peace be to this house and if the son of
[52:03] peace be there your peace shall rest
[52:06] upon it if not it shall turn to you
[52:09] again and in the same house remain
[52:12] eating and drinking such things as they
[52:15] give for the laborer is worthy of his
[52:17] hire go not from house to house and into
[52:21] whatsoever City ye enter and they
[52:23] receive you eat such things as are set
[52:26] before you and heal the sick that are
[52:29] therein and say unto them the kingdom of
[52:33] God is come nigh unto you and we know
[52:37] that's Luke 10 veres 1-9 I can't help
[52:40] but that think that scripture is just
[52:42] such a perfect depiction of an
[52:44] evangelist's
[52:46] role to go from City to
[52:51] city and to just spend time with the
[52:54] people carrying on he says who would
[52:56] dare deny the mighty Ministry of Phillip
[52:59] who would dare deny the mighty
[53:02] ministries of arenus Martin Columba
[53:05] Patrick and countless scores of others
[53:08] who have had God's anointing upon them
[53:11] yes the Bible is the real way of the
[53:15] open door and I want to add my testimony
[53:19] to
[53:20] that the reason I have to do that is
[53:23] because I can only speak with assurance
[53:26] concerning what God has done in my own
[53:29] life and isn't it wonderful brothers and
[53:32] sisters because that's exactly the
[53:34] testimony of every one of us as
[53:36] Believers we can talk about what's
[53:38] happened to other people and it's
[53:40] wonderful I've got many experiences I'm
[53:43] sure you do as well we all do about what
[53:45] God's done for other people but people
[53:47] want to hear what's God doing for
[53:49] you when we can talk about it as a
[53:52] firstperson experience that makes all
[53:55] the difference we become living
[53:57] Witnesses I think it's beautiful how he
[53:59] says this I want to add my testimony to
[54:01] that the reason I have to do that is
[54:02] because I can only speak with Assurance
[54:04] concerning what God has done in my own
[54:06] life so if you'll excuse a personal note
[54:09] here I'll tell you how I know for
[54:12] assurity that Jesus is the same
[54:15] yesterday and today and forever and that
[54:19] the power of God is still available to
[54:21] those who will believe and receive the
[54:25] apostolic Age Ain't Over
[54:27] he said that I can show you in the Bible
[54:29] where it started now you show me where
[54:31] it ended in the Bible such a beautiful
[54:34] thought he says during my missionary
[54:37] trip to South Africa God so blessed that
[54:40] when I came to Durban the only place
[54:43] that could begin to accommodate the
[54:45] people was the huge racetrack which is
[54:48] in the second largest in the world the
[54:50] crowd was well over 100,000 people what
[54:54] a meeting that would be in order to keep
[54:57] Law and Order they had to put up fences
[55:00] to separate the various tribes they
[55:02] posted hundreds of policemen to keep the
[55:05] throngs quieted down those hungry Souls
[55:08] had come for many miles a queen from
[55:11] rhasia had come with a train of 27
[55:15] coaches loaded with African
[55:18] natives they struggled in across the
[55:21] fields and mountains bearing on their
[55:23] backs for many and many a mile some
[55:26] loved one that needed help the whole
[55:29] country was stirred by the mighty works
[55:32] that had been manifested by the Holy
[55:34] Spirit isn't that
[55:36] beautiful not by my Ministry not by the
[55:41] ministry simply put by the Holy
[55:44] Spirit one afternoon as I began to
[55:47] minister one of the thousands of
[55:50] mohammadans came up to the
[55:53] platform as she stood before for me a
[55:58] missionary to the muhammadans began to
[56:01] softly implore the
[56:04] Lord oh for that precious Soul oh for
[56:08] that precious Soul he had been over
[56:11] there for years and years and according
[56:13] to his own
[56:15] testimony he had seen only one
[56:18] muhammadin come to receive Jesus Christ
[56:21] as
[56:22] Savior they originally were the MEO
[56:25] Persians whose laws change not so once a
[56:30] Muhammad in always a muhammadin and we
[56:33] know that's the Islamic
[56:36] faith they are so hard to win it seems
[56:40] that once a Muhammad and always a
[56:41] Muhammad and is the law amongst them
[56:44] well as she stood before me I G began to
[56:47] speak to her and to all those thousands
[56:51] through the
[56:52] interpreters I said is it not is it not
[56:56] not so that the missionaries have told
[56:58] you of a Jesus who came to save you you
[57:02] should have seen the people look at each
[57:04] other when I said that then when they
[57:07] had answered that I was correct I went
[57:10] on and said but did the missionaries
[57:13] read to you out of this book I held my
[57:15] Bible aoft for them to see that this
[57:19] same Jesus was a mighty healer and that
[57:23] he would live in his people down Through
[57:26] the Ages until he came again to receive
[57:30] them unto
[57:32] himself just makes it
[57:35] real so beautiful did they tell you that
[57:39] because of the Same Spirit in them that
[57:42] was in Jesus that they would be able to
[57:45] do the mighty works even as Jesus
[57:48] did I think this is something that we
[57:51] definitely need to study and highlight
[57:53] and remember because what he's talking
[57:56] about is the life of a Believer when we
[57:58] meet people that are struggling in their
[58:00] lives they need something we have
[58:03] something Jesus is more than just a
[58:06] tradition he's more than just a a church
[58:09] affiliation amen he's the living Christ
[58:12] inside of us people need to see
[58:15] this he says did they tell you that you
[58:18] can be healed even as you can be
[58:23] saved many people can believe for
[58:25] salvation but healing is just a little
[58:27] bit difficult because doctors don't talk
[58:30] about salvation doctors don't want
[58:32] nothing to do with that but they want
[58:34] everything to do with the body and the
[58:36] healing and and sickness and all of the
[58:38] symptoms in our lives and we know that
[58:40] the devil will speak through doctors but
[58:43] I want to say this brothers and sisters
[58:45] I'm not going to be a fool I'm not going
[58:46] to act like a fool the devil will speak
[58:49] through preachers
[58:51] too this is where we have to know where
[58:53] we stand as Believers is the word coming
[58:56] from the pulpit truth because if it's
[59:00] not truth the signs and wonders aren't
[59:02] going to
[59:05] follow did they tell you that you can be
[59:07] healed even as you can be saved how many
[59:11] of you would like to see this same Jesus
[59:13] come down amongst us and do the same
[59:16] things that he did when he was here on
[59:18] Earth long ago I could just imagine if I
[59:20] was there I'd be going amen I'd be
[59:22] jumping up and down see me I want to see
[59:26] see it I want to see it he's the same
[59:28] yesterday today and forever brothers and
[59:33] sisters
[59:35] my sorry I get a little excited over
[59:38] this it's just beautiful how many of you
[59:40] would like to see this same Jesus come
[59:43] down amongst us and do the same things
[59:45] that he did when he was here on Earth
[59:48] long ago they all wanted that that is
[59:51] one thing they surely agreed on now
[59:54] remember this is $100,000 people many
[59:56] different tribes fences between
[59:58] policemen to keep the order what a a
[1:00:00] meeting this must have been he said I I
[1:00:03] then went on if Jesus by his spirit will
[1:00:06] do what he did when upon the Earth will
[1:00:09] you believe his word
[1:00:11] then and here was that muhammadan woman
[1:00:15] in front of me the spirit began to move
[1:00:19] through
[1:00:20] me I said to her now you know that I
[1:00:23] don't know you I can't even speak your
[1:00:27] language she admitted
[1:00:29] that I said as for healing you you know
[1:00:33] I
[1:00:34] cannot but you heard the message this
[1:00:37] afternoon and UND excuse me understood
[1:00:40] me her Indian interpreter answered back
[1:00:44] for her that she understood for she had
[1:00:47] read the New
[1:00:49] Testament now the muhammadans are
[1:00:52] descendants of
[1:00:54] Abraham they believe in one God but they
[1:00:57] reject Jesus as the Son of God and
[1:01:00] instead they take Muhammad as his
[1:01:03] Prophet they say that Jesus never died
[1:01:06] and rose again they are taught that by
[1:01:09] their priests and they believe
[1:01:12] it I said but Jesus did die and raise
[1:01:16] again he sent his Spirit back upon the
[1:01:21] church that spirit that was in him is
[1:01:24] the very same spirit spirit in the
[1:01:26] church now and it can and will produce
[1:01:30] what Jesus
[1:01:32] produced that's a pretty strong
[1:01:34] statement to
[1:01:36] say but you know I think brothers and
[1:01:38] sisters once in a while it won't hurt us
[1:01:41] to be able to say that
[1:01:43] statement I think it takes a bit of
[1:01:45] courage to do it though because when we
[1:01:48] start talking like that the devil's
[1:01:50] going to be right there on your shoulder
[1:01:51] saying really when was the last time you
[1:01:52] saw it really you remember what you said
[1:01:54] really remember what you did remember
[1:01:56] what you thought etc etc etc don't
[1:01:59] listen to it just speak the word and let
[1:02:02] God back it up we can't back up the word
[1:02:04] that's the whole thing the devil wants
[1:02:06] us to back up the word with our
[1:02:07] experience with our thoughts with our
[1:02:09] failures or our successes they have
[1:02:11] nothing to do with it it's all Jesus
[1:02:16] Christ he said in John 5:19 the son can
[1:02:19] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[1:02:22] the father do for what things soever he
[1:02:25] doeth these also doeth the son likewise
[1:02:29] now then if Jesus will come and reveal
[1:02:31] to me what your trouble is or what you
[1:02:35] are here for if he can tell me what your
[1:02:38] past is surely you can believe for the
[1:02:41] future she said to her interpreter yes I
[1:02:44] can I said all right may he do
[1:02:49] it those muhammadans were watching
[1:02:52] intently they were all leaning forward
[1:02:55] to see what would happen can you imagine
[1:02:57] the
[1:02:58] tension the
[1:03:01] anticipation then the Holy Spirit spoke
[1:03:04] your husband is a short heavy set man
[1:03:06] with a black mustache you have two
[1:03:09] children you were at the doctor's about
[1:03:11] three days ago and he gave you an
[1:03:13] examination you have a cyst on the womb
[1:03:16] she bowed her head and said that's true
[1:03:19] I asked her how is it you came to me a
[1:03:23] Christian why didn't you go to your
[1:03:25] Muhammad and
[1:03:27] Prophet she said I think you can help
[1:03:31] me isn't that wonderful just like hadie
[1:03:35] R to speak the word I said I can't help
[1:03:40] you but if you receive Jesus Christ as
[1:03:43] your
[1:03:44] savior he who is here now and knows all
[1:03:49] about you he will help
[1:03:53] you he's the same yesterday today and
[1:03:56] forever when we see people that have
[1:03:59] great needs in their lives brothers and
[1:04:00] sisters he's ready and able more than
[1:04:02] willing and able to deliver those people
[1:04:05] I just can't help but think about it
[1:04:07] we're living in an age like that dream
[1:04:09] that that that Vision that brother
[1:04:10] brandham had remember what he talked
[1:04:13] about where he saw those those people
[1:04:14] tra behind the bars in a cave and he saw
[1:04:18] them and they were in there and they
[1:04:19] were struggling and they didn't know
[1:04:21] what to do and and we know that brother
[1:04:24] bradam he wanted to watch them he wanted
[1:04:26] to see what was going on in the end the
[1:04:28] Lord just said to them deliver those
[1:04:31] people and what did he say House of Hell
[1:04:34] give way to the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:37] Christ I believe brothers and sisters
[1:04:38] that wasn't just exclusive for the
[1:04:40] prophet now it's get me fired up that's
[1:04:42] for the Bride of Jesus Christ we see
[1:04:44] people trapped in cages all over the
[1:04:46] place we have the ability to give them
[1:04:49] Freedom Liberty by the spirit because
[1:04:53] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:04:56] it's not just to dance and run up and
[1:04:58] down the aisles it's to be free to live
[1:05:00] free to recognize you don't have to live
[1:05:02] in the bondage that you live
[1:05:05] in I said I can't help you but if you
[1:05:08] receive Jesus Christ as your savior we
[1:05:11] got to get the right step
[1:05:13] right he'll
[1:05:15] heal but why would we want to be healed
[1:05:18] to
[1:05:21] die I said I can't help you but if you
[1:05:23] receive Jesus Christ as your savior he
[1:05:27] who is here now and knows all about you
[1:05:30] he will help you she said I accept Jesus
[1:05:33] as my savior and that did it she was
[1:05:36] healed and about 10,000 muhammadans came
[1:05:40] to Christ that day because the gospel
[1:05:42] was preached in both word and
[1:05:47] power God never told a man to labor 30
[1:05:51] years and harvest
[1:05:53] nothing he gave us an Open Door door of
[1:05:56] word and power and that is what we are
[1:06:00] supposed to
[1:06:01] use that is what gave Paul his great and
[1:06:05] effective Ministry in 1 Corinthians 2:4
[1:06:08] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:06:11] with enticing words of man's Wisdom but
[1:06:14] in demonstration of the spirit and power
[1:06:17] and I can tell you right now as I speak
[1:06:19] these words I hear the devil trying to
[1:06:21] chirp me off saying where's the
[1:06:23] demonstration of spirit and power in
[1:06:25] your life brother Barry I'm not looking
[1:06:27] for that I'm looking for the word I'm
[1:06:29] putting the word first and he'll do the
[1:06:32] rest I don't have to do it it's not my
[1:06:35] responsibility that's his my
[1:06:38] responsibility is to put the word
[1:06:40] first listen to me now he says it was a
[1:06:44] while on this same trip that as I was
[1:06:46] boarding a plane at new Salsbury
[1:06:48] Rhodesia that I saw a party of four with
[1:06:50] American passports I went over to them
[1:06:53] and said hello there I see you have
[1:06:55] American passports are you traveling
[1:06:57] somewhere the young man answered me no
[1:07:00] we are all missionaries here how nice I
[1:07:03] replied are you on your own or do you
[1:07:06] work with some organization we are
[1:07:08] methodists we come from Wilmore Kentucky
[1:07:11] he said well that's almost in my
[1:07:13] backyard I replied you wouldn't be that
[1:07:17] brother brandom that comes from up that
[1:07:19] way would you I said yes that's right
[1:07:23] that cured him he wouldn't say say
[1:07:25] another thing and the way he and those
[1:07:29] three girls just looked back and forth
[1:07:31] at each other so I said just a minute
[1:07:34] son I'd like to speak to all of you
[1:07:37] about some principles seeing we are all
[1:07:40] Christians and here for a great
[1:07:43] purpose now you say you have all been
[1:07:48] here for two
[1:07:50] years this is just stunning can you say
[1:07:54] in the name of Jesus that you can put
[1:07:57] your finger on one soul that you know
[1:08:00] you have one to the
[1:08:01] Lord they could not do
[1:08:04] it I don't want to hurt your feelings
[1:08:07] girls I said but you all ought to be
[1:08:09] home helping your mothers with the
[1:08:12] dishes scathing words today with all the
[1:08:16] liberal theologians all of the liberal
[1:08:18] thinking scathing words today h he says
[1:08:22] you haven't any business out on the
[1:08:23] field unless you are filled with the
[1:08:25] Holy Ghost I love how he says this this
[1:08:29] applies not just to women this applies
[1:08:31] to men you haven't got any business out
[1:08:34] on the field unless you are filled with
[1:08:36] the Holy Ghost and preaching the true
[1:08:39] gospel in the demonstration of the power
[1:08:43] of the Holy Ghost if you are not seeing
[1:08:47] the results that Jesus said you would
[1:08:50] see it's because you are not preaching
[1:08:54] the true gospel
[1:08:58] Let Me Go a step further and show you
[1:09:01] just how things can be on the mission
[1:09:03] field I don't say it's all this way but
[1:09:07] I am afraid too much of it
[1:09:10] is well I was on the same trip and
[1:09:12] touring around Durban with the mayor
[1:09:15] that I saw a native with a tag around
[1:09:18] his
[1:09:19] neck just check for time and he was
[1:09:23] packing an idol
[1:09:25] I asked my friend what that tag was for
[1:09:29] and he said that was when a native
[1:09:30] embraced Christianity they put a tag on
[1:09:33] him that sure surprised me for here was
[1:09:37] a man calling himself a Christian and
[1:09:40] carrying that
[1:09:41] Idol this just got me wondering brothers
[1:09:44] and sisters how many of us call
[1:09:45] ourselves Christians but we pack an
[1:09:48] idol there's many different Idols
[1:09:51] sometimes it's a job sometimes it's a
[1:09:53] career sometimes it's maybe even a
[1:09:56] Ministry sometimes maybe it can be it
[1:10:00] could be anything tradition something
[1:10:02] from our family I I come from a
[1:10:04] Pentecostal background so I can I can
[1:10:07] have a little bit of a Pentecostal slant
[1:10:09] maybe a Pentecostal Idol and say that we
[1:10:11] should do things this way but you know
[1:10:13] what we have to do we got to cast down
[1:10:15] all reasoning Paul the Apostle to the
[1:10:18] Gentile Church said he had to take all
[1:10:21] of his
[1:10:22] idols and count them as dung
[1:10:26] and accept Jesus Christ to be his Lord
[1:10:30] but here was a man calling himself a
[1:10:32] Christian and carrying that Idol so I
[1:10:34] asked him asked how that could be he
[1:10:37] said I can speak his language let's go
[1:10:39] over and talk to him so we went over and
[1:10:43] the mayor acted as my
[1:10:45] interpreter I asked the native if he was
[1:10:47] a Christian he affirmed that surely he
[1:10:50] was a Christian I then asked why he
[1:10:52] carried the idol if he was a Christian
[1:10:55] he answered that it was an idol his
[1:10:57] father had carried and left it to
[1:11:01] him I just can't help but think
[1:11:03] sometimes our parents can leave us idols
[1:11:07] and you know sometimes it's not an idol
[1:11:09] that's
[1:11:11] perceivable sometimes there's
[1:11:12] generational curses they're real but
[1:11:16] when you come to know Jesus Christ the
[1:11:19] person of Jesus Christ and the power of
[1:11:21] his resurrection there ain't not one
[1:11:24] curse from any generation past or future
[1:11:27] that has any power over you brothers and
[1:11:30] sisters the devil's going to say oh no
[1:11:32] you do no no no you've got that genetic
[1:11:34] that's from before and as long as you
[1:11:36] say I've got that genetic you're packing
[1:11:38] an
[1:11:40] idol take that Idol and throw it down
[1:11:43] and smash it to
[1:11:45] bits you're never going to live above
[1:11:47] your confession he answered that it was
[1:11:49] an idol his father had carried and left
[1:11:52] to him when I told him that no Christian
[1:11:55] CHR ought to carry Idols he replied that
[1:11:58] this Idol had been of great use to his
[1:12:02] father I was curious to know how and he
[1:12:05] said that one day his father was being
[1:12:07] stalked by a lion so he built a fire and
[1:12:11] spoke to the idol the way he had been
[1:12:15] taught by the witch
[1:12:17] doctor the lion left I informed him that
[1:12:21] it was the fire that sent the lion off
[1:12:23] as fire scared s all wild
[1:12:26] animals I will never forget his reply he
[1:12:30] said well if it is this way if amoya the
[1:12:34] spirit fails then this Idol
[1:12:37] won't can you
[1:12:39] imagine a detailed account of the
[1:12:42] African campaign may be found in the
[1:12:44] book a prophet visits South
[1:12:47] Africa that is just about all the
[1:12:50] strength the Christian multitudes have
[1:12:53] because the word was not brought to them
[1:12:56] by the original Open Door of
[1:12:59] Pentecost I think it's such a beautiful
[1:13:01] thing I'm probably going to preach on it
[1:13:03] for a while we we we're we've been given
[1:13:06] the openest of doors the culmination of
[1:13:09] seven Church ages all the Revelation all
[1:13:12] the loose ends tied up in the Bible all
[1:13:14] that Adam had lost has been restored
[1:13:18] back back to
[1:13:20] who some people want to say William
[1:13:23] marry and bradam it was wasn't William
[1:13:25] Mary and bradam he never came and died
[1:13:27] on the
[1:13:28] cross he doesn't Deliver us from our sin
[1:13:32] he came to introduce a bride of his own
[1:13:35] choosing Christ's own
[1:13:41] choosing this is just about all the
[1:13:43] strength the Christian multitudes have
[1:13:44] because the word has not brought them
[1:13:47] brought to them by the original Open
[1:13:49] Door Pentecost now getting back to the
[1:13:51] open Mission door of the Philadelphian
[1:13:53] age
[1:13:55] it did not have the open door of power
[1:13:58] it ought to have had notice in the same
[1:14:01] verse where he mentions this open door
[1:14:03] he says Thou Hast little strength that
[1:14:06] is right the power of the spirit was
[1:14:08] missing in that age the word was well
[1:14:12] preached it was well able to make Souls
[1:14:14] wise unto salvation but the great power
[1:14:18] of God that showed forth his mighty
[1:14:20] works that made bear his arm in behalf
[1:14:24] of his
[1:14:25] own was missing except amongst the
[1:14:29] scattered
[1:14:30] groups yet praise God it was growing and
[1:14:33] had increased over what they had in the
[1:14:36] Reformation it was in this
[1:14:39] age that the man we often call the
[1:14:41] father of missions went oute William
[1:14:44] kery a village Shoemaker who pastored
[1:14:49] the particular Baptist Church at Molton
[1:14:51] England mightily aroused by the People
[1:14:54] by preaching on whether the command
[1:14:56] given to the apostles to teach All
[1:14:58] Nations was not obligatory on all
[1:15:02] succeeding ministers to the end of the
[1:15:04] world seeing that the accompanying
[1:15:07] promise was of equal extent now that's a
[1:15:12] mouthful he was fought by the Calvinists
[1:15:16] who had gone to the extreme of the
[1:15:18] doctrine of election believing that all
[1:15:21] who will be saved will be saved and
[1:15:24] missionar work would be against the work
[1:15:27] of the
[1:15:28] spirit but Andrew Fuller helped Mr Cary
[1:15:32] by his preaching and fundraising such
[1:15:35] was their effect that a society was
[1:15:37] formed to spread the gospel to all
[1:15:39] nations in
[1:15:42] 1792 this Society sent out Carrie who
[1:15:45] was signally blessed of God in winning
[1:15:48] souls in India in
[1:15:51] 1795 an aroused Christianity formed in
[1:15:55] the London missionary society which we
[1:15:58] well know raised millions of pounds and
[1:16:01] sent thousands of missionaries over the
[1:16:03] years to accomplish the desires of the
[1:16:06] Lord the spirit of God was moving and
[1:16:09] other sheep might well have been the Cry
[1:16:12] of the heart of those Earnest
[1:16:15] Believers I have set before thee an open
[1:16:18] door I want to look at these words again
[1:16:21] this time though I am not going to
[1:16:23] disassociate them from missions I'm
[1:16:26] going to bring you a thought which
[1:16:28] carries deep into the last age as I have
[1:16:32] already stated this age melts into the
[1:16:35] last age it was in this age Jesus said I
[1:16:40] come quickly verse 11 and of the last
[1:16:43] age he was going to finish the work and
[1:16:47] to cut it short in righteousness because
[1:16:50] a short work will the Lord make upon the
[1:16:53] Earth that's Romans
[1:16:56] 9:28 notice how this verse of how this
[1:17:00] verse of Revelations 3:8 goes Open Door
[1:17:03] little strength word name that open door
[1:17:07] has to do with all three now what does
[1:17:11] the door
[1:17:13] signify John 10:7 then Jesus said unto
[1:17:17] them again verily verily I say unto you
[1:17:22] I am the door of the
[1:17:26] sheep that is right I
[1:17:29] am present tense I am is the door of the
[1:17:34] sheep now this is not just a quaint
[1:17:38] expression this is actually
[1:17:41] so notice in John 10 when Jesus is
[1:17:44] giving this Parable he calls himself the
[1:17:48] shepherd then he calls himself the
[1:17:51] door and that is what the shepherd is to
[1:17:54] the Sheep
[1:17:55] he is actually the
[1:17:57] door and as I study that and read that I
[1:17:59] think that's a pretty heavy sentence
[1:18:01] right there it's a lot of
[1:18:04] responsibility when I was over in the
[1:18:07] East I saw that at night time the
[1:18:10] shepherd would gather all his sheep
[1:18:13] together he would put them in the fold
[1:18:16] then he would count them when he was
[1:18:18] sure they were all in he would lie down
[1:18:21] in the open door of the fold and
[1:18:23] literally become the the door to the
[1:18:26] fold no one could get in or out except
[1:18:30] by him he was the
[1:18:34] door it's just I'm sorry when I pause
[1:18:37] like that sometimes it just makes my
[1:18:39] brain go off like fireworks I just want
[1:18:41] to start preaching and I have to
[1:18:43] just no one could get in or out except
[1:18:47] by him he was the door the next day as I
[1:18:51] was went riding with a friend in a jeep
[1:18:53] I noticed that a Shepherd began to lead
[1:18:55] his flock into the city right away all
[1:18:58] traffic came to a stop so the Sheep
[1:19:00] could go through now the cities over in
[1:19:03] the East aren't like they are here we
[1:19:06] keep all our merchandise inside but
[1:19:09] there it is like a big farmers market
[1:19:12] with all the produce on the pavement for
[1:19:14] passer by passers by to go see and buy I
[1:19:18] thought oh my here is where the riot
[1:19:20] begins wait till those sheep see all
[1:19:23] that food out there
[1:19:26] but as the shepherd went ahead those
[1:19:28] sheep just followed right along exactly
[1:19:31] in each
[1:19:32] step they would look they would look at
[1:19:36] all those goodies but not a sheep
[1:19:39] touched a
[1:19:40] thing oh if I could only have known
[1:19:44] their language I would have stopped
[1:19:47] traffic myself and preach them a sermon
[1:19:50] on what I had just
[1:19:53] seen when you you are sheep that belong
[1:19:56] to the great Shepherd you follow right
[1:19:59] along in each of his
[1:20:01] steps just as those sheep did you won't
[1:20:05] be tempted to turn aside for some big
[1:20:07] flower of a church or listen to the
[1:20:10] voice of some DD or PhD or lld but
[1:20:15] you'll stay with the
[1:20:17] shepherd the Bible says that the Sheep
[1:20:20] know his voice and they follow him but a
[1:20:23] stranger's voice will only cause them to
[1:20:26] flee and run after their true Shepherd
[1:20:29] praise
[1:20:30] God but that was not all I saw and
[1:20:33] learned over there one day I got to
[1:20:35] thinking about having seen men out in
[1:20:38] the fields hurting different kinds of
[1:20:40] animals one fellow would be tending some
[1:20:42] pigs another some goats another some
[1:20:45] camels another some mules Etc so I asked
[1:20:50] a friend who lived there what they
[1:20:52] called those men oh he replied they are
[1:20:56] Shepherds I couldn't take that I said
[1:20:59] you don't mean to say they are all
[1:21:01] Shepherds Shepherds only her sheep don't
[1:21:05] they no he said a Shepherd is a herder
[1:21:09] or
[1:21:10] Grazer so anyone who grazes animals is a
[1:21:14] Shepherd well that did not surprise well
[1:21:17] that did surprise me but I noticed a
[1:21:20] difference between those herders and the
[1:21:23] ones who took care of the sheep come
[1:21:25] night time all the others but The
[1:21:27] Shepherd of the sheep left his animals
[1:21:29] in the field and went home the shepherd
[1:21:32] took his sheep with him and put them
[1:21:34] into the fold and then lay down and
[1:21:37] became the door of the sheep oh praise
[1:21:40] God Our Shepherd never leaves us or
[1:21:43] forsakes US when night time comes I want
[1:21:47] to be in his
[1:21:48] fold I want to be in his
[1:21:52] care now then
[1:21:55] we can see that Jesus is the
[1:21:58] door he is the door of the sheep and
[1:22:02] notice that it speaks now of the door
[1:22:06] opening what is that but a revelation of
[1:22:11] him so brothers and sisters when we talk
[1:22:14] about Revelation we're talking about an
[1:22:16] Open Door an Open Door into the sheep
[1:22:20] fold and we have the opportunity to get
[1:22:22] in before that she Shepherd closes the
[1:22:25] door just like Noah got into the ark
[1:22:28] Noah never closed the door the shepherd
[1:22:31] closed the door and it's the same thing
[1:22:33] today brothers and sisters we can get
[1:22:34] into that Sheepfold through the
[1:22:36] Revelation that we're getting that we
[1:22:39] have and you know what one day God's
[1:22:41] going to close that door and the weird
[1:22:43] thing is nothing's going to
[1:22:45] change we might set for 40 days we might
[1:22:48] set for seven days Noah sat for seven
[1:22:50] days it might be exactly the
[1:22:53] same but one day our bodies will change
[1:22:57] that's what this Open Door will bring to
[1:22:59] the believer what is it but the
[1:23:02] revelation of him and that Revelation is
[1:23:05] opening up to bring us strength to
[1:23:08] eliminate the word and glorify his name
[1:23:13] such a beautiful statement to open the
[1:23:17] word and to glorify his name not not to
[1:23:20] see Mighty signs and wonders not to
[1:23:22] create great Miracles and open schools
[1:23:24] and and go out and and preach the gospel
[1:23:27] no no no it's a totally different time
[1:23:30] now it's a gleaning time it was in the
[1:23:34] midst of the last two ages that the
[1:23:36] revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:23:40] blossomed out before us yes we knew he
[1:23:43] was God how else could he be our
[1:23:47] savior but to know that he was only God
[1:23:52] or God alone and that he was the Alpha
[1:23:56] and
[1:23:57] Omega and this Jesus was both Lord and
[1:24:02] Christ making him Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:24:06] Father the Son and Holy Ghost all one
[1:24:11] person that had been lost since the
[1:24:14] first church age but now we are seeing
[1:24:17] it again the revelation of who he was
[1:24:21] had come
[1:24:23] back my
[1:24:25] now this is where I want to
[1:24:27] start but I can see we're running out of
[1:24:29] time quickly this brothers and sisters
[1:24:32] is the Crux of the message to understand
[1:24:34] what we just read this paragraph to
[1:24:37] understand godhead it's not to explain
[1:24:39] it away to say well the the father is
[1:24:42] here and the son is here and the Holy
[1:24:44] Ghost is there and you know and and go
[1:24:47] on and on like some liberal theologians
[1:24:49] of this message can do what it is is to
[1:24:52] bring us to the realization that God is
[1:24:55] God Jesus Christ is God Jesus Christ is
[1:24:58] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost spirit is
[1:25:00] the spirit of Jesus Christ the traits
[1:25:04] the actions the behavior that we're
[1:25:06] going to see in people that have the
[1:25:07] Holy Ghost is going to be just like
[1:25:09] Jesus Christ if it's not like Jesus
[1:25:12] Christ it's not the Holy
[1:25:14] Ghost he says indeed the godhead is not
[1:25:17] a three person God with one personality
[1:25:21] for it takes personality to make a
[1:25:23] person
[1:25:24] if there is one personality there is but
[1:25:28] one person now they'll just take us and
[1:25:31] pigeon hole us and say well you're
[1:25:33] Oneness you're just Oneness that's all
[1:25:35] it is right right let's just keep
[1:25:37] reading here but they who believe in
[1:25:40] three persons have a three good godhead
[1:25:43] and are guilty of breaking the first
[1:25:47] commandment but the revelation of the
[1:25:49] godhead is back now the true church can
[1:25:52] build in strength again again after all
[1:25:55] this time she finally knows who her Lord
[1:25:58] is once again we are baptizing in the
[1:26:01] name of the Lord Jesus Christ just like
[1:26:04] they did at
[1:26:06] Pentecost I don't know I feel like I
[1:26:08] should quit because I think I will I'll
[1:26:10] call the
[1:26:12] musicians I don't want to rush through
[1:26:14] this next
[1:26:16] part I'll just read a little bit to get
[1:26:18] into it we'll come back and pick it up
[1:26:20] next week Lord willing he says let me
[1:26:23] tell you of of a god-given dream I had
[1:26:27] about Triune
[1:26:29] baptism this was not a vision but a
[1:26:32] dream you know I am sure that one of the
[1:26:36] blessings of the church Ages was to
[1:26:39] receive Dreams by the Holy Ghost just
[1:26:42] the same as one can receive
[1:26:44] Visions it was about 3:00 a.m. on a
[1:26:47] Saturday morning I had just gotten up to
[1:26:49] get Joseph a drink of water when I lay
[1:26:52] down I fell asleep and and instantly
[1:26:55] dreamed this
[1:26:59] dream I saw a man that I supposed was my
[1:27:03] father he was a great big Burly man I
[1:27:07] also saw a woman who was supposed to be
[1:27:10] my mother but she didn't look like her
[1:27:14] even as the man did not look like my
[1:27:16] father this man was very mean to his
[1:27:20] wife he had a large club with three
[1:27:24] corners on it you know when you take a
[1:27:27] log and you set set it up on end and hit
[1:27:30] it with an axe it makes a three cornered
[1:27:33] wedg like piece of
[1:27:35] firewood it was like
[1:27:38] that he would take this club and hit her
[1:27:41] with
[1:27:42] it and knock her
[1:27:45] down as she would lie there crying she
[1:27:49] would walk around he would walk around
[1:27:51] with his chest stuck out and on his face
[1:27:55] was such a proud boastful look that he
[1:27:59] appeared to take great pride and
[1:28:01] satisfaction in beating up a poor little
[1:28:04] woman every time time she tried to get
[1:28:08] up he would hit
[1:28:10] her I did not like what he was doing but
[1:28:14] as I considered stopping him I thought I
[1:28:16] can't tackle the man he's too
[1:28:19] big then he's supposed to be my father
[1:28:23] but down inside side I knew he wasn't my
[1:28:26] father and I knew that no man had the
[1:28:29] right to treat a woman like
[1:28:31] that I went over and grabbed him by the
[1:28:34] collar and turned him around and said
[1:28:37] you have no right to strike her and when
[1:28:40] I said that my muscles grew and I looked
[1:28:43] like a giant the man saw them and he was
[1:28:47] scared of me I said you strike her again
[1:28:50] and you'll deal with me he hesitated to
[1:28:52] strike her again
[1:28:55] and then the dream Left Me Maybe stand
[1:28:57] with me as we close
[1:29:00] tonight I'm going to leave off
[1:29:05] there I think it's just uh a
[1:29:09] tremendous segue into a very important
[1:29:13] part of the
[1:29:14] message to
[1:29:16] recognize the Triune
[1:29:19] gospel to recognize that sometimes we
[1:29:22] can cause hurt hurt in
[1:29:26] spouses by the idols that we
[1:29:29] pack and not even realize
[1:29:32] it but we've been given an Open Door
[1:29:35] brothers and sisters we've been given
[1:29:37] Deliverance let's just bow in prayer
[1:29:40] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank
