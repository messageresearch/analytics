love you and we thank you we commit the service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians tonight you have your Bibles tonight I just would like to read two scriptures I'd like to read from Revelations chapter 1 as we continue our study in the exposition of the seven Church age book Revelation 1 verse 1 and then I'd like to read over in Hebrews chapter 12 Revelations chapter 1 verse one says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen over in Hebrews chapter 12 just like to read verse one and verse two very familiar scripture just hope tonight that we can stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance Hebrews 12:1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith amen who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen let's just go on to him in prayer one more time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your word just pray that you would anoint it father and that you would Quicken it to us by your spirit tonight we know that man's words will fail we know that this whole world around us is falling apart and Lord Jesus there's one thing that will remain and that's your word and we pray that father tonight you would just Quicken this word and that it would find its Mark in our hearts tonight Lord Jesus in that place that you've made for us that place that you've made in US father for you rather just love you and we thank you we commit this service now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated did you ever think about Hebrews chapter 12 the second verse it says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith so he created our faith and he finishes our faith as well yes but did you ever think of the the second part there the second sentence who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross how could enduring the cross be Joy what part of that would have joy but I just want to say tonight I I think it's so beautiful because tonight we can look at ourselves and we can look at our brothers and our sisters and our families and our friends and we can recognize that you and we are that joy we are the jewels in his crown that's why he went to the Cross so that we could be here tonight and talk about him we just have a couple of uh sorry announcements um we have the ladies brunch coming up and uh that's this Saturday we have a communion service this Sunday uh the communion service will be at 6: pm and uh we'll probably have a few testimonies in that service as well we have the prayer meeting coming up this Thursday on the 16th that's at 7:30 p.m. and that wasn't on the calendar I just put it in and uh I apologize if that makes anybody uneasy you don't have to feel the pressure but I strongly recommend if you want to see things happen if you want to see God move in your life it's uh well worth looking at anyways uh so the prayer meeting will be this Thursday at 7:30 p.m. we have a youth gathering on the 19th and uh I just want to bring you greetings from Brother Paul halet in NAA Idaho he said to greet the Saints in Calgary at Calgary Living Word we had a just a beautiful conversation it's amazing when you talk to some folks there's just never ever enough time you can just talk on and on and you say you know well I think it's probably time to go and then something else comes up and you keep talking and before long it's not minutes it's hours that you're on the phone and you're like my goodness it's just not enough time so I bring you greetings from Brother Paul halit and I also bring you greetings from Brother codre digs and it looks like brother Cadre uh will be coming through here in December likely towards the middle of December we're certainly excited to see what will happen he's working out his itinerary and I said to him We're flexible here it's okay just uh let us know what works for you and and we'll make it work so he'll be coming through in December you're happy tonight amen certainly Odd as we were driving into service tonight just when we Crest the hill coming in from the south end of the city you know to see all of the city in in in darkness the sky is completely dark now with the time change uh I I said to Lisa you know it wasn't very long ago that you know this time of night the sun was really high in the sky and you know it was beautifully bright out until about 10:30 at night and here we are now uh early in the day in darkness I don't know how people could live in Alaska where it's 6 months of darkness I I can't handle the darkness or clouds but you know tonight just looking at our scripture in uh in Hebrews chapter 12 wherefore seeing we are also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses isn't that beautiful brothers and sisters if we could just have that anointing that Elisha had when his servant came to him aesia and said you know what master master we perish when they got up in the morning and saw all the syrians surrounding their Camp you know if we could just have that isav tonight to say you know what if we could just see that there's more for us than there are against us just because we can't see them brothers and sisters you are compassed about with a great host of witness a tremendous cloud of witness and I think it's beautiful we could even tie that back into the cloud we saw in 1963 for some folks that is just a cloud that's just a picture that's just something a token that goes on the wall that is associated somehow with the ministry and and it's just a a supernatural event maybe and other people will have the explanation to say that maybe was a rocket or some sort of scientific explanation but the others will have the ability to say that's a a compassing cloud of witness of the life that we believe we understand what happened there and that was a blending of the ages we can see that you know what there's time was running out there and and we are now in a different age and at the end of brother bram's Ministry he said it very clearly that we're not in the leoan church age some folks will remain there but there's others that have gone into the bride age and what is it that does that brothers and sisters it's not greater preaching it's not uh uh fantastic Ministries it's not tenure in the message of of the hour it's truly having revelation of the word for our day that's what put people in the boat there was only eight Souls that were saved that got into the boat when Noah was around preaching his message and we know there's not very many people that are going to get in the boat so to speak in this age but there is a blending of the ages and we're so for to be able to be a part of it but tonight I just wanted to say to us brothers and sisters you know if we could just see this great this great cloud of witnesses that's around us let's just lay aside every weight let's just take the pressure off let's stop worrying about the problems and start focusing on the promise because if we could do that brothers and sisters our lives would become a little softer a little easier a little more more more able to be to Bear Our Lives and the troubles and the and the trials that we go through the devil wants us to believe that we're defeated but you know what we're preaching about we have been and we will continue to is that he is defeated he's the one that's defeated he knows it better than most theologians better than 90% of the theologians in this world Satan knows it assuredly that he is defeated and that if the true church can catch a revelation a true revelation of the word for their day then Satan will be powerless before her and we're going to read that tonight I think it's so beautiful we're just going to maybe do a little teeny recap and and then go forwards in our in our study of this book The the exposition of the seven Church ages um you know we we got into some real good stuff last time we just left off with paragraph 17 now remember this Christ in the true true church is a continuation of the book of Acts you know some people are saying that there's a real push to go back to Pentecost and truly I believe that some people are are doing that some people are real trying to to do that to say that if there's a manifestation of of one of the gifts of the Spirit we know there's there's many different gifts of the Spirit but if we can see a manifestation of the gift of the spirit then we'll know that we actually got it but that's what brother bradam preached against that's what the Holy Ghost in brother bradam preached against you know having an identification of a speaking in tongues doesn't mean that we're any closer to the Living God than any other gift and you know brother bradam says it in in his way you know why would you want to just have the tongue when you could have the whole shoe right if you've ever had a shoe you know there's a tongue inside the shoe why would you want to just have speaking in tongues when you could have a true revelation of the word for your day amen yes Hallelujah remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formula powerless I think we talked about this last week and how you know many times we can look around and and say well this church and and that church and you know maybe even in our church well this brother he comes from that background and that brother comes from that background and you know I'll say it for me people might look at me and say well brother Barry comes from a Pentecostal background so he's got a little bit of a Pentecostal slant you know maybe maybe we all have our stories we all have our testimonies we all have our our history that that makes us up makes us who we are but you know I think that we can just rest assured that God who is rich in Mercy made certain that we came from exactly where we came from exactly how we came from where we came from and we had to go through all of the experiences that we've gone through to be exactly who we are in the day in which we live that gives us the ability to receive the word for our day but I think it's just beautiful because you know we can look at other people and say oh look at them they're lukewarm and oh look at them they're formal and Powerless you know what brothers and sisters if we do any of that then we need to stop I would say this and get to the Altar and get a real experience because we need to make sure that we're going inward this has to be an inward experience we got look inside and make sure that I'm not getting lukewarm formal and Powerless because as soon as we're starting to look outward and see other people doing that that's that Antichrist Spirit creeping into that church don't look at a church building don't look at an association look at your heart that's the church that's the building that God's Building remember brother Bram said it in the Rapture message he's not building a wall he's not going down through the centuries doing the same thing over and over again right now he's building a house and this house that he's building is a temple up of the Holy Ghost and you know Paul said it that we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost we don't have to go too far into that tonight but you know I I just think it's beautiful brother Bram a little further back in in this message just a little bit of a recap you know brother Bram he talks about how the devil actually gets a little uneasy in in his his meetings and and and how you see the most peculiar Expressions come over the faces of people when Satan knows he's just about to be exposed and and I'm not saying tonight I know I said it in the past that you can see it you can notice it in in preaching and you can when you hit on certain things you can see that people's countenances change and it's just the way it is you can see that in an in an experience when you're just having a conversation with somebody I'll give you an example of myself when you can see someone's countenance change you pick it up when brother Wayne Lawson was here last time I was sitting right about there uh uh he was preaching and the Lord was dealing with me with me in something real specific and and I had gone to a different planet in my mind and he perceived it while he was ministering he could see something was going on and and if you were to go back and listen to the recording you would hear Brother Wayne's voice say brother Barry is everything okay because he saw something happening my countenance changed it happens brothers and sisters you know when the word is coming forth God is dealing with us and and we're either actually having our heart touched like we sang or we're not but I think it's beautiful brother Bram he says it here he says you can see the faces of people when Satan knows he's going to be exposed now it isn't the people that I'm talking about isn't that beautiful it's important for us to recognize it we're talking about God or the devil right but the devil wants us to say no I'm talking about brother Henry no I'm talking about brother Daniel I'm talking about brother Joel brother dawn oh have you seen those Brothers no way as soon as we start doing that then we're giving the devil a day off we're playing right into his trap of deception I think that's the only way he's got a a a road in with us I mean I I think truly as Believers of this word we're too far down the road to be deceived by some sort of weird false Doctrine aren't we the Revelation is way too expansive this great cloud of witness that we are a part of is way too too bright and and clear to the Bride of Jesus Christ there's some people maybe in the world who would be truly elect seed of God that maybe haven't heard about the message of the hour that God sent a prophet and truly they will have the ability to hear it but we're not going to be deceived by that but I just think it's interesting he says now it isn't the people that I'm talking about it's that Satan has got a hold in their lives Satan can get a hold in our lives brothers and sisters through sin indifference and disease Satan will come and knock on our door he'll come and try and and shake the door he'll try that lock and see if that door is is shut and locked if it's sealed if it's got the token and you know he'll try us and God will allow it God will allow it just to see what we'll do I just think it's interesting you know if we talk about Sin you know sin is unbelief we know what that is it's not drinking it's not smoking it's not going out to the bar it's not looking at the wrong things it's not listening to the wrong things it's not even doing the wrong things even even though we know those are all attributes of sin but what is sin it took a prophet in our day to bring the true Clarity to this sin is unbelief unbelief in the word of God Amen yes amen the devil gets a hold of people's lives through sin and indifference and I think this one is real interesting it's always intrigued me and you know I'll probably harp on this for a while but I think it's real important for us as the Church of the Living God to recognize Satan's tactics and how he likes to get a hold of people's lives it's no accident that the prophet of God took and wrote this down the way that he did it gives us the ability to recognize his tactics and when we can recognize the enemy's tactics we can actually block them before he even gets in yes but indifference what's indifference the the definition of IND indifference is a lack of Interest concern or sympathy does anybody have indifference tonight there's times in my life where I've had indifference oh that brother's got a big problem in his life well you know what he actually walked into that and he pretty much deserves it so you know hey or that sister that that that thing that happens you know we can get indifference we we can look at it and say there's a prayer meeting coming up on Thursday night I just have a lack of interest in that you know we've prayed many times we haven't seen much happen you know maybe the way brother Barry does it or whatever it is you know it's just a lack of Interest or you know going to church on a Wednesday night it's just it's just a lack of Interest a communion service I just don't have the interest in that you know I I I believe I don't have to do that you know maybe but I would say this if it's in the word of God if the prophet of God brought it and said these are the things we need to do these are the ordinances that are going to change your life as a believer of this word uh do we have a lack of Interest or concern about it or even have sympathy for it or is it something that's the top of mind that's like we just can't wait to do it yes sir right that's how the devil gets in our lives through sin unbelief in the word indifference just having a lack of concern for the generality of what happens in the church maybe or or even in our families I've just got a lack of concern for my marriage I I've just got a lack of concern for my children because I'm busy man I've got a lot to do I got so much on my plate I've never had this much pressure in my life that's exactly where the devil wants us he wants us to get there so we're so busy we are indifferent about our marriage or about our family or about our church we don't have concern or sympathy for it because we've got so much problem take a step backwards brothers and sisters and say whoa what's going on in my life is this indifference do I have indifference because if I've got indifference the prophet of God said that's how Satan gets a hold in our lives man wow sometimes we just need to be shaken a little bit we need to look at this and say wow do I have IND and then disease we get illness in our bodies Satan will come around and God will allow it God will allow it and that's just to see what we'll do amen just to prove us a little bit I I think it's just beautiful because we will have a testimony if we're son and daughter of God if any one of those things gets a hold in our lives you know what we'll be delivered from it promise you you'll be delivered from it it won't stay it can't stay but remember brothers and sisters when when we feel like we're isolated and we feel like we're alone and and we just want to crawl under a rock because we feel like we're overwhelmed in a situation just go and read Hebrews 12:1 wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let's just lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that's set before us to me this describes a marathon there's a few people I know that maybe have run in here tonight but you know a marathon you're not actually sprinting and running with all your energy you're just putting one foot in front of the other and sometimes it's almost like you're walking you're not even trying to run with all of your energy you're just putting one foot in front of the others and that's what we're doing we're running a marathon brothers and sisters all we've got to do is cross the finish line it's not a race against anybody else we're all at different Paces we just need to keep going we just need to keep running we just need to keep encouraging one another by the word of God when the devil comes around and says you're defeated you're alone you've got no hope you might as well give up and pack it in you might as well do exactly whatever it is that the word of God would say you shouldn't do just remember there is more surrounding you even in that moment than you can see with your eyes there's more for you than there are against you just start to speak the word start to remind Satan you know when he would come around and try and make us feel defeated when he would try and make us feel like we've made too great of an error all of that is the devil when he would try and make us afraid try and remind the devil of his future he I I just thought about it today I was having a conversation with him because he is just battling me just coming at me with my own stuff continually badgering me and I finally stopped I put down my tool I was in the shop where I actually study the most probably I just listen to the message and I absorb it and I'm pray and anyways I just stopped for a second and I said you know what Satan I I just I'm SI sick and tired of hearing you I just rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I don't have to tolerate you but you know what I just want to remind you of your future you're trying to work me over here continually with these thoughts that are just ridiculous I just want to remind you about the Lake of Fire remember that you're you're going to be cast into a lake of fire but I also want to remind you of something else you know how smart you are you know many people would say brother Barry you're going a little bit too far with this but I just it just hit me and I think the Lord allowed me to see it today and maybe someone wants to dispute it but that's okay we can but isn't it interesting that it was the most religious people that put Jesus on the cross why did they do that they were influenced by someone and that's what I reminded Satan remember how smart you are you're the one that actually got Jesus put on that cross which was my Redemption thank you Satan thank you devil because of that because of what you did you actually bought my Redemption you actually pushed that down the road a little further we know that Jesus bought my Redemption Jesus bought your Redemption don't get me wrong but he could not see that Jesus was actually God the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man and what he did was he actually caused that to happen yes so I actually was thanking the devil today I said Thank You Satan for doing that for actually fulfilling Your Role because you were created to be destroyed you were created to be defeated but you know what I was created to sit and Rule and reign with him in his throne because I know that I'm going to overcome only because I believe in the word of God not because of anything that I could do because he is already overcome and I believe that's the only reason sometimes we just need to have a conversation with the devil when he comes around just try and remind him of his future he doesn't want to hear that very much brothers and sisters when you start talking about the Lake of Fire that he's going to be cast into it Revelations 20:10 and you just continually remind him of that and and how you are an overcome you can just continually Give Him scripture after scripture after scripture eventually he's going to leave yes sir and tonight I just want to maybe turn with me to to Luke chapter 4 just talk about this a little bit here um as we're getting going uh seems to be the way it is it's beautiful though Luke chapter 4 we'll just start reading with verse one the devil's coming around he's going to come around and come around and come around we're going to read it in this uh exposition of the seven Church ages Lord willing if we can get that far tonight uh but he's going to come around and Badger us right up until the time that he is going to be cast into the Lake of Fire he's not going to give up not one bit but what's going to happen is we're going to get stronger and stronger and we're going to become less and less tolerant to all of his tactics and the way that he operates and we're just going to put him on the run to the place where he's not even going to want to deal with us re uh sorry Luke 4 verse 1 and Jesus being being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he didn't eat he did in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that it be made bread so remember brothers and sisters he was tempted in all manners just like we are the devil spoke to Jesus yes sir and Jesus answered him saying it's written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God Amen and the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will give it if therefore Wilt worship if thou therefore Wilt worship me all shall be thine and Jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve amen and he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against a stone and Jesus answering said unto him it is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God Amen and when the devil had ended all the Temptation he departed from him for a season I just wanted to highlight that part there brothers and sisters two parts one is when did this happen this happened once Jesus was filled with the Holy Ghost so you know we could say it sadly the battle really starts when we truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you know what we're still going to fight we're still going to battle even without the Holy Ghost in our lives and the only way we're going to overcome is with the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost we're defeated we're defeated before we even start doesn't matter whether we try or whether we don't try without the Holy Ghost we're defeated so we have got to go forwards as Believers in our day and get the Holy Ghost in our lives but that's when the battle's going to come but brothers and sisters you don't have to take a thought for what you'll say because when you eat the book when you feed on the message of the hour when you read the Bible and pray you know what's going to happen when Satan comes around we're going to start to identify him we're going to start to see when we become a little bit indifferent we're going to start to see when we get an illness in our body we're going to start to see when unbelief comes around and starts to say maybe it isn't true that God sent a prophet or maybe there is an eighth messenger or maybe we could just stay home and listen to tapes all these different things are going to come around but we're going to have the ability to say you know what no way that's not what the word of God says I'm going to follow the word of God and that's what Jesus did here for it is also written but you know verse 13 says and when the devil had ended all the Temptation he wasn't getting anywhere with them what did he do it says the devil departed no different for us brothers and sisters just be steadfast stay in the word of God and don't give up when the Devil comes around and tempts us sore speak the word am speak back to the devil and tell him you don't don't say boo devil if you want to go ahead and do it but but just simply say you know what get lost I don't have to tolerate you get away from me in the name of Jesus Christ and he has to go and you know for those people that don't know maybe it'll take five minutes it's not like an app on our phone or or or maybe skip the dishes we can just dial and it just comes at a certain time it's going to take a little bit of time sometimes it'll be instantaneous and other times he'll linger but don't worry just speak the word and start to think about good thoughts start to think about the things that are lovely and the things that are pure and the things that are true and the things that are holy start to meditate on those things brothers and sisters because if they be in you you shall not fall amen Hallelujah but you know the devil came after him once he had the Holy Ghost but then there was a time where the devil departed but only for a season yes only for a season he he comes around and he comes around and he's going to shake us down and try and and Bug us and do as much as he can but just make sure you got the token once you got the token you got the best deadbolt system that there ever is there's no way that he can get through if you got the token he's just going to pass right past because he doesn't want nothing to do with that token brothers and sisters right but just remember there's there's ways that the devil gets into our lives it's through sin indifference and disease but you know what Satan will be exposed and and what is it it's a revelation by the Holy Ghost brother brandham says a little further down you know some people would say that maybe it's it's Witchcraft and and it's mind reading or telepathy but it's a revelation by the holy ghost that he has the ability to see that and there's only one way that we can see what we see in our day it's a revelation by the Holy Ghost it's just so important for us to remember remember that paragraph 18 further down just carrying on with what we're we're saying and where we're going it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he he won't give up he's always going to battle us brothers and sisters and the worst thing that he's going to do is try and dis credit God's word he's going to say that we can do it another way there's something else that we can do there's an alternative way maybe around the message of the hour something different we can do uh look at our brother look at our sister look at the ministry look at the pastor look at the deacons say this is wrong that's wrong the other thing is wrong what about the inward work you know one of the things that's the worst thing that can happen is to have a critical spirit and come into the church with it and then start to criticize when we're doing that brothers and sisters something's wrong inside something's wrong right here when we're doing that Jesus never criticized amen the Sinners the most puffed up religious ones he did yeah but he just brought the word to them he just brought the correction to them amen paragraph 19 says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army so he's not talking about some other future age and someone else somewhere in a different dimension he's talking about you tonight amen you call yourself the Bride of Jesus Christ yes you're the she if she gets the revelation the true revelation of the true church if she gets that and and what she is what is she the Bride of Jesus Christ M Jesus Christ her word is his word if she doesn't like it then then you can take it up with him but he's going to say hey she said it that's her word and her word is my word so you better deal with her right she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army says if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her you he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert just like we read about in Luke chter 4 by speaking the word the devil's going to talk to you he's going to shake you down but when you can speak the word back to him and recognize his tactics that he's going to come around and try and give us unbelief he's going to whisper in our ears oh that's a mistake and that's wrong oh maybe we should do something a little different maybe we know a little better or or a little less or whatever whatever it is sin indifference and disease if I could just have those three words remain with us tonight as we go forwards this week remember sin indifference and disease if we can see those we can recognize how he's coming around to try and get us paragraph 20 says yes yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them this is what we've been saying on Sundays you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we'll fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters like I said before I'll say it again tonight I believe he's speaking about the word of God as well as this book that he has put together it's not just this book that he's put together even though it is but this book that he put together is the word of God I'm not saying we read this and say that this is going to be our Salvation right here what this book does is points back to the word of God yes and every every sentence in here every paragraph references the word of God but you know the only way that we're going to get it we're going to understand it is by Revelation by the spirit just like when we read the word of God the only way that can actually have Success reading the word of God is to have Revelation by the spirit that's why we continually say it you got to have Revelation Revelation Revelation but you got to have the Holy Spirit you've got to get baptized you got to repent and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to acts 238 not entitles to actually get the Holy Ghost in your life and if you don't do that then how can you ever see the true Revelation the true meaning of the word but you know going on in what he says here it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost it's got to be revealed to us that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people now that there I think is a real strong statement many people could look at that and say whoa hold on a second what makes anyone a special class we're talking about a country in the world and how that country really looks down on o other people other races and and according to your passports and I thought my is that even still around but I guess it is it's it's very much around but you know we're not talking about the literal skin color or or country of origin in this book that's not what we're saying about a special class of people it's not about how someone was taught manners at home it's not how maybe somebody had tenure in the message of the hour they were raised in the message of the hour and that causes them to be a special class of person we're not talking about that either we're talking about people who have the Holy Ghost in their lives people who have the operation of the Holy Ghost in their lives and what that means what is Operation of the Holy Ghost that's discernment yes sir when you hear something that comes into you there's something inside of us that filters that that shakes it down that pulls it apart that puts it back together again and says it's correct or it's incorrect discernment isn't just for the prophet discernment isn't just for evangelists or teachers or pastors discernment is for the children of God am discernment is by the Holy Ghost that's the operation of the Holy Ghost amen we've got to have that and that's what creates a special class of people to think that anybody else is a special class of person because of anything else is not understanding what this is saying here what what this special class of people are it's people that have the operation of the Holy Ghost in their lives amen and if we want to see where they got the operation of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives just take a look at the fruits of the spirit take a look at the Statue of the perfect man take a look at at Corinthians when when we can see where where love doesn't fail where we can see what charity actually is if we have those those attributes living out through our lives brothers and sisters then we'll know we've got the operation of the Holy Ghost because it's always going to point back to the word of God Amen it says that this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight you've got to be a prophet you've got to have prophetic Insight how you going to do that outside of the Holy Ghost in your life it's not going to happen it will require the ability to hear from god wow and I think that's so so important for us brothers and sisters it's not coming to church it's not just what the preacher is going to preach has he heard from God well I I would certainly hope so I hope that he's heard from God but what about you have you heard from God anybody here heard from God this week I'm not looking for a show of hands but I'm just saying it brothers and sisters it's that important it's that pertinent it's that vital we have got to have our own relationship with God in our lives if we don't have that relationship then we're missing the point right amen it's not an association that's going to get us there it's got to be one with prophetic Insight it requires the ability to hear from God amen sometimes maybe pastors or preachers can fit the description I shouldn't say pastors I should just say preachers sometimes people just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and they don't ever take the time to listen but you know brothers and sisters I I've heard it said from a worldly man he said my dad taught me something and he always said Son there's a reason why you've got two of these and one of these we should be listening more than we should be talking and we know that the word of God says that we should be quick to listen quick to hear and slow to speak and if we're doing anything else something's wrong we need to make sure that we're actually following the word of God that we've got his life living out through us that we have Supernatural instruction and and brother bham says it will require Supernatural instruction it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that's good we cannot study the word of God we cannot enter into the exposition of the seven Church ages and think that we're going to learn it just by going verse by verse by by paragraph by paragraph by Page by Page studying it like a student like we would at University that we were taught to do or in school like we were taught to do it's going to require prophetic Insight super natural instruction the ability to hear from God he says but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know you know brothers and sisters I can't help but think that if we never ever go on from just learning just studying verse to verse if we never go on to getting the token in our lives you know what will happen is we will actually become indifferent to the word of God right it will become something that's just you know whatever I know it I've heard it you know there's nothing that anybody's going to teach me we're not actually getting Supernatural instruction by the spirit and that's what happens when we come to church we want Supernatural instruction by the spirit amen that song that we sang no one else can touch my heart like you do is that true in our lives nobody else the Lord Jesus Christ when we come to church and we worship him can he touch his can he touch our heart paragraph 22 says as I have already said the Book of Revelation is a consummation of the scriptures that means it's coming together and making it one it's even placed exactly right in the cannon of scripture at the end now you can know why it says that Anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed amen amen it's the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil Hallelujah the revelation of God and and I just think it this way I want to say it this way tonight I just want to try and make it relevant to us in our day it's not just a book from 1965 or maybe even a 1960 when he preached these these messages but brothers and sisters it it it will it will take the revelation of God that will give you the authority over the devil do we have the revelation of God for us in our lives that's the Holy Ghost the only way we get the Holy Ghost is to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I know that we're there I I I just want to encourage anyone that maybe hasn't been able to do that to take a look at that brother Ram goes on to say and you see why they who would add to or take from would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it's it is that simple we cannot add to it or take away from it we can't say that the the exposition of the word the revelation of Jesus Christ through the Vindicated prophet in our day I can just take and and make the the message something else I I I can just study it and and maybe do something different than what the prophet said if we're doing anything different than what William Mary and brandham said then brothers and sisters leave it alone leave it alone if you see people trying to influence you to do something different than what William Mar and bradam said leave it alone amen it's not going to do anything for you it will take you away from the word brother bam says it's that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word verse or or paragraph 23 see in verse three a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book I think this refers to the Old Testament custom of the priests reading the word to the congregation in the morning you see many could not read so the priest had to read to them as long as it was the word the blessing was there it didn't matter if it was read or heard and tonight brothers and sisters we've all been given the ability we have the blessing of being able to read and if anybody here doesn't have the ability to read I do apologize but I think for the most part most of us uh have the ability to read the word so we can hear it spoken but we also need to eat it we need to read it and that's how we eat the book John was instructed in Revelations chap 4 to take the book and eat eat it up and and you know sorry it might be a little further in Revelations but he was instructed to take the book and eat it and that's how we eat it today that's by reading it paragraph 24 says the time is at hand the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom and economy of God this Mighty Revelation though fully known to God could not come forth hither to thus we immediately learn a principle the revelation of God for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time I think we could just dwell on that for a while you know looking at where we're at we look back and we can see the first and second polls we can see the justification the sanctification but then there's the baptism of the Holy Ghost where it's a spoken word condition where we have the ability to speak the word and know that God's going to back it up for us we don't have to to try and back it up we don't have anything to try and perform we just need to know that we're going to speak the word according to the word when we do that brothers and sisters that's when the devil trembles that's when the devil ain't going to have no part of you when you can speak the word according to the word not be like James when we speak the word when we go to him in prayer and you know many times our prayers aren't answered the way that we want it to happen it's because we want to consume it upon our lust we're asking about our our carnality and and maybe spirituality but you know we got to go further than that we got to get into our soul ality we got to get into that Soul realm and we've said it I don't know when but when we're praying from our souls brothers and sisters it's a different realm it's a different conversation Al together than than when we're dealing with the the the things that we deal with in our world in our jobs in our schools or badgering us in our mind when we're trying to pray and breakr and then we've got our own natural abilities and disabilities that get in the way of our prayers but when we just break through that's breaking through into that place where it's no longer us praying where it's the Lord praying through US brothers and sisters that's a a totally different conversation but brother banam he says it thus we immediately learn a principle the revelation of God for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time and isn't it wonderful to think that we have been called in this very specific time to be recipients of this message of the hour in its fullness amen there's no more mystery if there's a mystery according to the message of the hour then there's a problem brothers and sisters the the Mysteries have all been explained and unraveled and tied up again there's no more mystery paragraph 25 says look at the history of Israel the revelation of God to Moses came only at a specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people Cried unto God Jesus himself self came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead and in this age leoan the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think on this and heed it well for we are in the end time today think on this and heed it well isn't it wonderful to think that that we have been called we we don't even have anything that we've got to do we just have to believe it we just have to accept it and believe it ask the Lord for that Supernatural instruction ask for the true Revelation according to the word brothers and sisters when we get into that prayer and you know the Bible will become a new book to us amen the salutation he says John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen now brother Bram he goes into to explain in a bit about this here he says in paragraph 26 the word Asia is actually Asia Minor it's a small parcel of land about the size of Indiana the seven churches there were Especial excuse me especially picked from all other churches for their characteristics which same characteristics would be found in the successive ages centuries later the seven spirits Before the Throne is the spirit that was in each of the seven Messengers given giving them their Ministries for the age in which they lived now all these Expressions him which is and which was and which is to come and faithful witness and the earth and the alpha and sorry faithful witness and the firstborn from among the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth and the Alpha and Omega and the almighty are titles and description to descriptions of the one and same person who is the Lord Jesus Christ who washed us from our sins in his own blood it's so easy when you look at that and you start to read it it sounds so busy and we know that's where the devil gets in is where we have so many details and and the way the descriptive words are verse or chapter 29 the spirit of God in John Expresses thusly in order to set forth the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ and to reveal the godhead as one God today there is a gross error it is that there are three Gods instead of one amen this Revelation is given to John by Jesus himself corrects that error it's not that there are three Gods but one God in three offices there is one God with three titles Father Son and Holy Ghost this Mighty Revelation is what the early church had and it must be restored in this last day along with the correct formula of water baptism amen now modern theologians won't agree with me for here is what is written in a great Christian magazine that teaching on the Trinity is at the very heart and core of the Old Testament it is every wit as much at the heart and core of the New Testament the New Testament is just as much opposed as the Old Testament is to the thought that there are more Gods than one yet the New Testament with equal clearness teaches that the father is God the son is God the holy spirit is God and these three are not three aspects of the same person but are three persons standing in a truly personal relationship to one another there we have the great doctrine of the three persons but one God I never really experienced this myself until just the other day I had someone try and and and find out what I believe and and they wound up actually calibrating me into a Oneness Doctrine that's that's where they were able to comprehend me to be living pigeon hold me into there but I just said what brother bradam said in here and you know it's not the trinitarian doctrine that there's three persons there's three attributes there's three characteristics there's three offices there's three manifestations of The Same Spirit in three different offices and there's one God and you know people want to try and and pinpoint where you're at with that and so does the devil because the devil can get you off from actually being where you need to be then that's okay it doesn't care what side of the road you are what ditch you fall into so long as you get into a ditch but I said to him you know I I understand that and I understand that but you know where we're at where I'm at is right down the middle I believe that there's three manifestations in one God he is a father and he is a son and he does have the Holy Spirit and and we were in a a group of people and I had to say it to him I couldn't believe the way he kind of came at me guns blazing we were at a school event and I had to say to him you know what if we said if I said it right now how many fathers are there here in the midst and there was a whole bunch of parents with their children you know many people would have to raise their hands and say I'm a father so how can you say someone's name by saying father and just the same with the son how could you say Sons how many sons are here how many kids would put up their hands the devil has this made so completely clear and the reason it's so strong in people's lives is because they've gone and they've paid good money for an education that's taught them this is the way it is this is what we believe this is the curriculum this is everything that we've believed this is what we've been taught this is what the fathers were taught this is the way it is eat it it's good but you know what it is you're scratching around like chickens in a chicken yard not recognizing that this isn't really the truth but there's something in the heart of a True Believer that can say I could just never understand that I can never comprehend how that would work because the spirit is trying to operate through our lives and you know eventually we hear that scream of the eagle and we look up and we say wow I can I can see with both of my eyes up do you know that chickens specifically have the ability to see the ground with one eye and the sky or anything else with the other eye that's why they Bob their heads around so much but eagles they can see with both their eyes they've got tremendous Vision they can look up and they can see Mama eagle flying in the sky and hear that sound recognize that sound just jump just take one jump that's what brother brandham says Holy Ghost is screaming to us just take one jump towards him and I want to say it tonight brothers and sisters maybe if we've had an experience and it's just growing a little bit cold don't stay there just take one jump to him just jump to him tonight and say Lord F me let me lift my cup unto you and just top me up Lord we know that there was one difference between the 10 virgins right the five wise and the five unwise they both had oil they both slumbered and slept they both were virgins but only one had enough oil amen that's why we come to church that's why we feed on the word of God so that we can get enough oil in our cup brothers and sisters we might not even make it till tomorrow make sure we've got enough oil in our cup but it's beautiful how this is we've been given the ability to see this by the revelation of the spirit in our lives modern theologians won't agree with me paragraph 30 for here is what is written in a great Christian magazine that teaching on Trinity is at the very heart and core of the Old Testament it's not at the very heart and core of the Old Testament it's at the very heart and core of the curriculum that's given through theologians in the theological study books that's what it is and it comes from the nian council we'll get into that and and we'll actually pull up some actual documentation from the nian council and will show that that's exactly where it came brother bradam says that there was a two-way split split and one was actually the the Oneness Doctrine and the other one was the the trinitarian doctrine and that's where it happened in 320 ad the nian council that happened and you know what brothers and sisters it's beautiful because brother bradam he says it that there is going to be another nian Council there is going to be another one and he even says so far I pretty sure he says thus sayith the Lord it will happen and you know what's going to happen when that happens I I trust that we won't even be here for it but you never know what could happen there's already a a church in Saudi Arabia I believe it is that's called the abrahamic house and it has the blessing of the Pope and it's got the the I don't know what it is from Islam all of them are coming together in one the Protestant churches as well brothers and sisters one Church One Roof a one universal church imagine that yeah and back in the 60s we had a prophet declaring that there's going to be another nyine Council they're going to come together and they're going to unite together under one banner and you know they're going to think they're actually worshiping God and who are they going to be worshiping the God of this evil age they're not even going to recognize that God's not even going to hear their prayer he's not even going to be interested in what's going on but Blessed Be Your Eyes brothers and sisters because you can see the things of God you can hear the revelation of the spirit when when the spirit speaks expressly unto his bride we have been given the ability to hear it it's the greatest thing that we could ever get in our lives and and you know the next best thing is our our our our marriages the Lord to give us our salvation but then to give us our marriages to give us our our wives our beautiful brides and to recognize that that's the greatest thing that he could give us outside of our Salvation my goodness how much we have to be thankful for and for all those people who are looking for brides you know what God has one in store for you you don't have to worry there's no need to panic and get excited and go and do anything too rash too irrational just trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding but let the operation of the Spirit come through you and happen in your life and you know how can you how could you ever do that if you didn't have the Holy Ghost in your life if you didn't have the token applied to your your your your lentil and and your doorposts it's just impossible that's why I don't think that we could ever overemphasize Revelation by the spirit it's not Revelation by the church or or by the pastor it's Revelation by the spirit the only way you're going to get the spirit is to actually follow the word for your day and everything will work out right once you get the Holy Ghost in your life brothers and sisters I I promise it will it it's just it's it's not easy it's not easy the Holy Ghost isn't just a a ticket to paradise and and there's no more problems in your life we read about it earlier that's where it actually gets hard but that's going to give you the overcoming power amen every single one of us in this flesh we've got a date with Destiny we're going to go into the grave unless the Lord takes us in the Rapture and you know brother Bram talks about having life Assurance a and many people are talking about life insurance but life Assurance it means that even though this body will get into the graveyard there's one thing that assurance that Blessed assurance that Jesus is mine that will get us out of the graveyard and that's what we're looking for we're not looking for a an easy excuse to get out of our our problems in our lives but we

we thank you for the mighty Revelations that you've given to us thank you for this word Lord that we've read tonight father as we read read the the the Book of Revelation and we study the exposition of the seven Church ages and we know that there was a man on Earth that he he heard you T say to him pick up your pen and write father we know that that's part of what's in this book Lord we pray that we could just have the operation of the spirit in our lives Lord that we could understand these Revelations that they would become clear to us that we would recognize that it's not a man saying that he was given a special pair of glasses and and some other Revelation came down and now we're mixing anything different with the word of God we're not hybridizing your word it's truly your word father what an honor and and a blessing it is a privilege father to to get Revelation by the spirit what greater thing could you have a a man on this side of Eternity encourage other men and women to do than to get the Holy Ghost in their lives father I don't know anything and I thank you for that I thank you for the desire that you've given me Lord to preach the Holy Ghost father to see that Lord it takes the operation of the spirit and that's not something that we can do we can't just wave our wand and say it's time for the spirit to move we need to yield ourselves and and make ourselves yielded
