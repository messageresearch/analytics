and thirsts after righteousness and we know what the word says about that they shall be filled we just want to remember Wilson Rory he's requested visitation I believe and wants to know more about the word so we will look forward to connecting with him and just seeing what the what the Lord has in store for this man the doctors say that he has a limited time on this side of Eternity but we know the Lord might have a different story so Wilson Rory we want to remember him we want to remember those who are traveling Andrew and Grace they're in Connecticut for Thanksgiving and if you have a need just make it nonan to him tonight our gracious Heavenly Father tonight we thank you for your goodness Lord Jesus it's so easy to worship you father when we just step back and think about what you've

angel messenger would say to the church Lord in this age father we don't have words to thank you but Lord Jesus tonight we're so thankful that we can gather together assemble ourselves the way that you've instructed us to father that we can show whose side we are on Father Lord that we don't have to wonder what we know father we just thank you for your goodness to us tonight Lord thank you how faithful you are to us Lord oh Lord Jesus so many times you'll allow a little trial to come our way just to see how we will react father just to see if the Tudor really got that lesson through to us

and sisters God bless you it's been a pleasure and privilege to speak before you you know your family therefore I don't want to get nervous so that at least God can use me but sometimes under pressure there's some squeeze in you that will come out that is the best in you so may the Lord squeeze me and pour out the goodness in me use that he will use me amen maybe if we can check the the projectory if it works uh okay that's good I'll I'll just check whether if it will work thank you musician musicians call Musicians amen just wanna be relaxed tonight and I hope you will also relax and that God will be on the scene and we'll all be blessed tonight amen maybe as a start let's read Genesis 1 11-12 as you can see I have a title here preserving the seed for God's purpose I I did a little bit of this in the men's breakfast so it's just 15 minutes there so it ended up 30 minutes so this is the full version this is our home church so I will put all the effort the one that I had before it's 50 pages and then in the immense breakfast I cut it but this one will be the full version but you know we don't have any new message it's just reminding us uh uh you know by way of remembrance right so uh Genesis 1 11-12 so that at least we can have we'll try to finish by a little bit uh past nine o'clock okay Genesis 1 11 to 12 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb building seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the three yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good let us bow our hearts this evening oh Lord Jesus we know it's not easy to speak before your people Lord and behind this Pulpit everything that will be said Lord will be accounted Lord if if I will say something that will not be according to your word Lord forgive me I will ask for forgiveness right now but I don't intend that Lord because my basis is your word and your message and the Fulfillment of your message through US O Lord Jesus and we know everything has a purpose everything that is coming out from us Lord everything is the fruit of of who we are all our Jesus that's why Lord anything that will be manifested from us Lord will be your word because your word is in US oh God as we as we start this uh service our lord Jesus by the opening of your word O Lord Jesus may you anoint my lips Lord It's a lip my lips of clay lord it's not worthy it's dirty but Lord by the power of your word Lord it can be cleansed and be used Lord as long as As I will surrender myself and keep out of the way oh Lord may you be the one who will speak Lord before your people may you be may you have preeminence Lord from start to finish Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated so uh preserving the seed for God's purpose if you can see it everything that we see has a purpose everything that God allows has a purpose so I'll give a background of what the uh what this topic is all about is uh if I will start with the story of Joseph and Judah just for for a background Joseph we always say is a type of Christ amen but then the thing is when you check his uh story there's a deeper thing in it because it is me it is said in the scripture uh all all of his ordeals he became uh slaves he was sold to Egypt and so on and so forth for a purpose the purpose is to preserve life amen and whose life was he preserving just a question there I know this is a it's a big topic but then just a just a background for this topic he preserved the seed of Judah why because Judah Jesus Christ came from the uh from the tribe of Judah amen so it means it's not actually Joseph that uh that we we see him as the hero there is a purpose why he became a hero so that he can preserve the life of Judah so that Jesus Christ can be manifested later on amen and and you can see also the Egyptians they were in Goshen before right I think Emmanuel preached on Goshen but I'll take it on a different level Goshen when when when the the Sarai lights went to Goshen they have fruits they are they are fruitful in that land but then if you check about it Goshen is not the right land so they have to come out of Goshen right if you type it to our day this world is not our home right so we can redemption you know two parts brother uh many brothers already preach on it coming out and getting in right you have to come out of gaussian and go to where Canaan which is the promised land so there's a lot of process there right same for us we have to come out of our denomination so that we can go to the full word of the hour amen which is the message of the hour so just a background on that you you can see that everything that happens there is always a purpose amen so it's a and it's for God's uh you know he's uh uh his uh uh purpose stands in election amen so I will start with a lot of scriptures and messages and then some graphics here so that at least we can we can enjoy amen very familiar scripture I put all things I know it's better to check with the Bible but then with limited time I'll I just put it I hope it's legible I think it is so Romans 8 20 30 which is very familiar scripture and we know that all things as I mentioned work together for good amen to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose I recalled hey man are we special people amen for whom he did for no for knowledge right he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he called he also called whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so you can see all the all the process here he because of his poor knowledge he predestinated us then he called us and then he justified we know the meaning of justification we never did it in the first place he destroyed all evidence though we did it but he didn't we didn't do it it's a paradox right so so that's a privilege for having a prophet of this day to to remind us of Who We Are it's it's a blessing it's it's glorification it's Rapture it's everything uh there is no purpose of coming to church if we will just stay here and then come back and uh get out of here and then be the same it's always being reminded that we must know who we are right and and that knowing who we are means we are uh being healed of our spiritual amnesia amen so you see when we are Justified we will be glorified meaning we will be ruptured amen glorified in our glorified bodies oh brothers and sisters so so important so you can see in Sumerian Church AIDS here John 6 37 and 44 it says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I shall in no wise cast out but you can see here there's something in between here that these are two different classes of people the first one is all that the father giveth me shall come to me that's the bride amen but the second one in him that cometh to me I shall in always cast out so it means these are this could be the foolish virgins amen that they come and and and any person that gives us a cup of cold water right they will not be cast out because they did good to the bride we will talk anymore no man can come to me except the Father which had sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day imagine he will be raised at the last day but this last day is not our day uh because for us first resurrection we will be there this is the the second Resurrection John 1 12 13 but as many as received him to them gave him power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God amen you can see here Ephesians 1 4-5 it's been preached by Briar very many times but uh also it's good when there's visual because they said when you see something you will remember more right according as he had chosen us chosen we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us and to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now without getting too involved in the subject of sovereignty of God because sovereignty of God it will take a lot of booking itself he's saying let me point out that according to these verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their Brides today so it's his choice if he chose you you should must be thankful you didn't do anything amen so that is a very important foundation that uh it's not because of our works it's always being told to us that it's by his grace alone we didn't do anything anything that we do as as a product of being a bride is just the manifestation because we are bright in the first place amen so let's continue the bride today does not simply decide she's going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it is the groom amen who decides which is Christ amen and chooses a certain woman for his bride so in John 15 16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world amen this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself Ephesians 1 9 and in Romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand you can't read it any other way amen the hard purpose you see the main purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world so it's already done brothers and sisters we it's just a drama that we're trying to fulfill right now right reminding each and everyone who we are so we just have to to live the life according to the word feed the word amen pray we know we need to work man right that's our curse so we have to do it but then the things that's that's just to earn a living amen it's not to to gain the whole world and lose our souls amen I have I have this I know it's a it's so hard to get out of the notes when because the message is already there just put them together and then you will read it as long as it's it's within the within the parameters of the word and the message I will not worry at all I'll just read it because I don't have the right to correct the prophet or or correct the word it's just we we're thankful that's why we have the fivefold ministry building on each other not not distracting each other right it's it's building each other because Paul planted the seed Apollos watered but who does the increase it's the lord always amen so we that's why it's so important we're thankful we we can practice the the Ephesians 4 11. but then the thing is every message that we will preach out of this must be under the message of the hour because that is the major prophet we could be Prophets because the word of God is in us we are not God but the word of God comes through us and as I'm repeating what the word says it is that's it the Lord because it came it comes from the Bible it didn't come from my own intellectual conception right so so let's do it for the children this is again election you can see for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it who's calling brothers and sisters amen it's always God who's calling amen it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the anger as it is written Jacob have I loved but he so have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid amen because he has sovereignty he can do whatever he wants right so so now as we will read this the purpose we mentioned everything has a purpose so let's check the purpose of the prophet of this age amen and and we know Malachi 4 1-6 there are two two uh uh two comings of Elijah that we can read here let's read it because we know we have John the Baptist and we have uh Branham here but let's let's uh dissect it for behold that they cometh that shall burn us an oven and all the proud day and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up said the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch did this happen already not yet right the Earth didn't burn yet amen but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of our of your feet in the day that I shall do this said the Lord this is a warning amen because this this haven't happened so remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments this is a very familiar scripture behold I will send you Elijah amen the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord I underlined and put in red great and Dreadful right because if you check about it for us it's the Great coming of the Lord but for the unbelievers is the Dreadful day of the Lord but then when you check again great because the thing is in in in in in verse 6 and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that's John the Baptist amen and turn the hearts of the children to the fathers that's right Branham lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so you can see great the coming of the Lord is great amen him physically in in Galilee in in in Jerusalem in where you know uh in in Nazareth wherever he preached the gospel right that's a great coming but then the Dreadful day of the Lord is the one that is for the second coming of uh basically for for reserved for Branham here which is the forthcoming of Elijah amen so you can see in this Malachi for for one to six here for for five and six their support for support Branham to look for for a bride for Jesus Christ he's the leader amen and and that's his purpose because it's to declare the word so that our hearts will be turned back to the fate of the Pentecostal fathers the original Faith amen so so since we're talking about Branham let's continue with the with the five comings of Elijah just for a presentation here I know I I I I did this in the Sunday school and also in Lethbridge and let's let's do it the first coming there are five comings of Elijah you can see the first one is Elijah himself so it's in 910 BC right First Kings 17 Second Kings 1 uh verses one to eight we will not read those okay the second one is Elisha Second Kings 2 8 to 15 that's in 896 BC where did I get those dates so this this Bible from uh by Schofield sober Branham or I mean voice of God have been uh uh selling this basically they are available and then there are dates so you can see where these dates are so that at least you know where you are we are anti-message believers therefore it's important to know the time we're living in and it's important to know if you can put it in a timeline you will see where you are right so it's the based on dates so this is the second coming which is I mean second coming of Elijah but that brother Gilbert mentioned right the voice of Elijah and Elisha all right let's continue I don't wanna uh go ahead myself the third coming is Janda Baptist himself approximately 26 A.D there are so many scriptures Matt Matthew 3 Mark 1 Luke 3 John 1 15 34 Malachi 3 Isaiah 40 and 3. so this is just a background for what we will preach but then the thing is at least you will see there is a purpose for for the prophet right and then it's better to see where where he is located in the timeline amen so that's John the Baptist that's the third and the fourth is the prophet for the Gentiles which is Branham himself that is in 1909 to 1965 that is his whole life basically so it's in Malachi 456 Revelations 3 14 and Revelations 10 7. so and then we have the fifth coming of Elijah which is Moses and Elijah after the Rapture for three and a half years after we're gone then the the message which is the message of the hour which is the Gospel of Jesus Christ will be turned to to the juice because then Gentiles days is over at that time no more grace for us right but then for us because we're the bride we were chosen before the foundation of the world we don't need to worry about that it's just nice to know that after Rapture there's three and a half years of of tribulation where Jesus Christ will rebuild himself to the Jews they are special people amen but they are not the bride amen so that's why it's so important to know that uh this message of the hour is so rich and so uh clear to tie the Loose Ends amen so let's continue so you you can see the the seven Church ages is within this 2000 years here but if I'll go back here you can see between John the Baptist and and Branham it's about 2 000 years of difference but then if we read if we read the Malachi 456 we thought it's just one scripture but it's actually two thousand years Gap between the two so imagine we we must read between the lines the way the way Branham preach it because it's only through the prophet that we can read between the lines amen that Revelation is already there it's not of course it's for us it's Progressive even for Branham is Progressive but anything that we need to be raptured is already there in the message that's why he says the rupturing faith lies on the message of the hour which which are you know recorded in the tapes it's not new message amen it's just fulfilling you can see he preached two hours three hours here and there because he's trying to save the food for us and that is for a purpose so that we can be here November 23rd Wednesday uh 2022 we will be here listening to all this amen praise the Lord so you can see between here and the Baptist he's a forerunner of the first coming right and Brian Branham is a foreigner Forerunner of the second coming but Brian Branham already left the scene we can see John the Baptist he foreign the person and the person was there so Brian Branham was here so what do you expect the pattern is he must also be there where is he now amen that's why it's in you and me amen it's it's a little bit different because for gender Baptist it's physical but for us it's spiritual so the second coming we've been very thought talked about it there's so many appearings but there are three comings right so we will not tackle that because it it's in the timeline for from eternity to Eternity but uh you know for for for this second coming is also a Time timeline and it happened in 1963 in the cloud amen February 28 when he he was taken out up by the seven angels message uh the seven angels amen so going back to our topic here so you can see the church ages here it's two thousand years and we're only waiting for the Rapture right that's why by this timeline here you will see there is always a pattern every time I I preached this before you can see Before the Flood there was a message through Noah and it's a prophet amen what is this warning there will be flood there will be rain and the coming of Jesus Christ there will be a messiah right he's the word for the day amen but they didn't accept him but who who for run his first coming it's gender Baptist so is it different from this day that we're waiting for his second coming so there there must be a forerunner as well and he must be a prophet amen so you can see here the pattern that that the uh we we call it bright age right 1963 February 28th that's the start of the third pool Ministry and and that's the opening of the word amen so let's let's continue so you can see these seven Church ages we have all the time here I discussed before so uh Brian Branham is saying it's a quick work for laodicea and then you can see it's uh one year so 2023 they will be equal with Ephesus here right so it's a warning only for us but we don't want to to base Our Fate on that but we know we already came right he's already living in US therefore we're living in the eighth day because whether we live or die we already manifested Christ in us so we don't need to worry at all amen so so you can see here 117 years Ephesus is 118 so because today is 2022 right so doing a little bit of mathematics here right 20 to 22 minus 1906 that's 116 plus one you should include the first number or first year those uh who loves mathematics they would know that for example one to ten ten minus one is nine right but actually the numbers are 10 so 10 minus one is nine plus one so ten so that's how I I came up with all this right but then simplify they just uh the duck 170 by 53 so they end up with 117 but the actual mathematics in it is 1 70 minus 53 plus one right because you have to include the first year amen so in accounting you will it will not be a zero zero if uh if you will do it right right so and uh just a side note there so not now anyone knows that Amos 37 said that God promised that he would never do nothing until first he revealed it to his prophet amen through the church ages we've had reformers but promised by Malachi for that there would be a prophet in the land in the last days because it has to fit that pattern you see that pattern that I mentioned see before the end time come so there's always a pattern we must recognize the pattern and how can you recognize it by the message of the hour by the Vindicated prophet and then the Fulfillment of such uh prophecy by the prophet if it doesn't come to pass then it's not a Vindicated the word amen but it came to pass that's why we're so we're resting on it amen so you can see here before Jesus come the first Elijah come Elijah Malachi 3 amen that's John the Baptist Matthew 11 says so if you can understand it this is who was spoken of behold I send my messenger before me now he's prophesied all theologians believe that in the last day the spirit of Elijah is to come to we just read it right behold I send you Elijah but whose Elijah is the spirit of Elijah amen because Spirits never die they just you know come from one person to another person even even the evil spirit they went to to the swine in gadara so it's both sides but let's talk about the good ones right so now he's prophesied all theologians believe that that in the last day the spirit of Elijah is to come too it has to come five times God uses that spirit amen Elijah John the Baptist Elisha and for the Gentile Church which is Barbara Branham and then for the Jews in Revelation the 11th chapter that's God's grace g-r-a-c-e Faith f-i-t-h Jesus j-e-s-u-s Jesus the letter five can't stop at four it has to go five amen so you see numerology Branham is so so uh Keen in in telling us about numerology amen the numbers this one is a good one actually trying to do get the service now he promised that so that sets the Bible just exactly to this day and the Sodom and Gomorrah and Elijah that wasn't Elijah that was the spirit of God on Elijah Elijah was just a man amen now we have Elijah's Elijah's coats and Elijah's mantles and Elijah's everything but the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ so why do we need to worry because it's Jesus Christ in you and me so so it means the spirit of Elijah is also in you because that spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ amen he is to come according to Luke 17 30. the son of man is to reveal himself among his people not a man God but I'll come through a prophet that's why we have this prophetic Ministry and it's through the bride now because the the messenger are already gone right so what are we preaching we're preaching the word so the word of God is in us that's why it's prophetic right because we have blessed the Lord amen we're not adding anything to the Bible we're just repeating amen we're just rehearsing you can say now he had he never had two Major Prophets at the same time never in the world so there will not be any eight messenger per se because the bride is the eighth messenger amen because there will be no two Prophet except for for the Jews because they have Moses and Elijah there are two prophets there amen so it has to be one head God has to get one man under his control see there's one God there was Father Son and Holy Ghost but one God over it all notice and just use them offices so he has with Elijah the spirit of Elijah he used that Spirit but the same God controlling it all the time to fulfill his word amen so to fulfill his word it has he has to go through a prophet amen and and now it's through us so we we have this before but I added the scriptures here and the Very God of Peace in first Thessalonians 5 23 sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and Hebrews 4 12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul spirit and of the joints and Marrow Johnson marrow that's the flesh amen so you can see Body Soul spirit and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so this is a very good presentation because the thing is we discussed the first pull second pull and the third pull the first pull up first and second pull of brother Branham first pull is to contact the body which is to hold the the hand from his left right and then he can discern uh and and then he would know because of the movements of uh office veins and everything right he will see the Demonic life that will flow through his body so the first pull is to contact the body right that is sign in the hand that's healing and the second pull is to contact the spirit prophesying discernment right so his first two pulls also it is encompassed with healing Divine Healing but the third pool is the most important because the first two poles will give way to the third pool and man and that is to contact what the soul and the soul is where the word Lays and that seed right it needs to be quickened by the same material which is the word the word will Quicken the word inside us that's why it will Quicken from the inside going out and you can see it's the word of God that will that is quick which is alive powerful right sharper than 28 jet sword it will cut Pierce even to the dividing asunder of the soul from the inside and the spirit outer and joints and Marrow so you can see the third police opening of the word is very important to understand that that is for us that's the ministry of Branham since 1963 to 1965 and then it is being continued by us right now amen so you can see there there are dates here in the first pool you can see because before the first pull there are some preparations it's in 1946 to 1948 second pool is 1940 to 1963 and then the third pool is 1963 to 65 but then to the present also which is us we're continuing the voice ministry right now that's why the voice is in the bride right and what voice are we saying what that that's the voice of God in us amen we're manifesting so we're just waiting actually for the Trump because that trumpet which is the marriage supper of the lamb in the sky amen I I know I I did this before but then again it's another Foundation so it's the same uh how it is from latency to ripen seed from death you will have life and then you'll be dead again meaning you're dead to yourself when you're ripened because you're baked by the sun s-o-n right you're baked by the word there's no more greenness in US therefore we are perfect in in in his Gardener right to be harvested so you see from that to set to death but you cannot grow without being rotten right without being dead to ourselves we cannot live so now we grow until we become mature and then when we mature we will be dead again and then God can take us fully fully surrendered vessel is omnipotent right when we're fully surrendered we don't need our own intellectual understanding and whatnot right amen so so you can see here Dark Ages rotten right there's so 68 million Protestants or or you can say Christians were martyred here that's why Tyrant church is Dark Ages and then comes justification by Luther which is the stock so little little life there and then the tassel sanctification AIDS by Wesley and then the shock Pentecostal age that's why we're living in Pentecostal AIDS we're living in the bright age which is this guy here messenger is Jesus Christ through brother Branham and then the bride amen third pool just putting it there it's good to repeat because it's so so yummy so so rich so it's just good to to understand it okay let's let's read this Christ is rebuilding his own word see down through the age we started off from the foundation of course we have to start with Foundation right Faith uh and so on and so forth when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it come out through the feet Luther you see from the bottom it goes up based on this Luther come back out then through Wesley then into Pentecostals the tongues in the lip see now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself which is the Capstone amen once we already understood who we are then the Capstone will come and and we know 1963 that's the tapping amen the third pool he will come himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no sight of Our Own how can a man foresee those things he can do it it's God himself see it's becoming to a place and it's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of what of a bride that was taken out of his side same material brothers and sisters like at like Adam was rather at the beginning so you see it's a masterpiece right it's a anything that came out of Adam is Adam it's the same material same for for the Masterpiece uh uh Moses stat uh statue the one that was hit that little piece is the same material as the as the big piece so it's just a measure of what it is so if if God is in US right so what are we then so we are Messiah it's saying right so let's continue these are very good nuggets that I I just wanted to share you can see with your hands yet it's part of the body you can see with you cannot see with your ears yet it can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can see with the lips though it speaks see that was the Pentecostal age that with the tongues but now it's in the eye time the seeing prophetic now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye there is not one moving faculty being die it means anything let's continue the next is the intelligence because it's in the mind which is Christ itself who controls the whole body he's the head amen no moving motion beyond that see everything else has moved see move your feet move your muscles in your legs Mo move everything move your ears your ears can move your nose your lips and so forth but after your eyes there's nothing moves that's why they claim that men get bald-headed quick is because see there's no exercise to develop the muscles in in the hair the skull but I'm just wondering here how come it's only men that got belt-headed maybe the the women use their muscles in the head because they think so much right and it's a I know the one of the seminars that we went with bar Paul and the rest for for men maybe there's only two boxes but with women there are so many things they they want to solve the whole world whole wide world right so they think so much that's why they don't get bald headed I guess because they practice that muscle but anyway so you can see here and it's not got a question that they get blood up in there so there's no blood that comes out that's why there's no more moving far uh part the blood won't pump through see won't go up and furnish blood because the hair root lives by Blood and we find out that that part you see there's nothing beyond the eye so it's already the head so beyond the prophetic there's no more so are we waiting for another messenger are we waiting for another Prophet I don't think so amen it's it's very clear here that so you can see here the next so I put the colors here red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet and let's read the I will just read the a message here related to it it's in uh this one is in the original title here is 24 elders but uh actually right now the the the new the new title is Revelation chapter four number two it's in paragraph 176. it says Noah's rainbow composed primarily of seven colors red orange yellow G green blue indigos and violet that meant seven bows seven both seven churches reflecting seven lights it's light wrapped into the other one don't you see Guardian is seven colored rainbow his Covenant that he made a covenant that proved seven Church ages the seven colors he would save the Earth and if if we read Revelations 10 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel which is Christ himself Revelation 10 1 and and that is uh we know that's the seventh seal amen when he when he came down cloth with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head so it means it's together with the seven Spirit seven Messengers amen when Barbara Branham was caught up it's together with the other Messengers that's why it's a complete thing amen with Jesus Christ amen because uh uh let's continue here now if you notice seven rainbow seven colors I mean seven color rainbow that meant seven bows uh seven both seven churches reflecting the seven lights each light wrapped into the other one wrapped into the other one because uh you can see the church ages they are overlapping until we come to laodicea and then later on it will be the fullness of the word which is Christ himself that's why you were living in the bright age amen so you can see here the bride AIDS so so you uh these are the church ages episode and then these are the messengers and this is uh the typing rotten seed to matured seed rotten seed to stock tassel shop and then mature which is the rapture and the Harvest and this is the bright AIDs that we're living in and we're living now in the fullness of this nature of a perfect man because Christ already kept this Holy Spirit sealed us from inside and outside so we have the same shape as Jesus Christ right now he is the head and we are the body amen and you can see all these seven Church ages seven Messengers we they were used for because every age has a bride right but then the Bride of cloud is here which is us we we came through the next age which is the bright age we we that is on top uh I'll I'll just go quickly here so that at least we will read it you can see here we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age we're not living in the method this age we're living in another age we're living on up here because what we see over there is laodicea right you know it's uh the AIDS of Rights people's rights you see protests everywhere right especially here right everyone wants to exercise his rights it's people's rights but then you can see we're living on up here to the bright age what's the bride it's the calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture amen if you if if you see that one and then we don't even need to worry at all amen so let's continue uh it says here in the face of the trumpet scripture is part of God reveals to us that we're in the last day we saw the timeline we're at the last day because all the patterns we're in 2022 right now it's almost 2 000 years since since Jesus Christ amen now if I come this is Barbara Branham speaking he's the laodicean church messenger we know that now if I come with the message of Pentecost I would be in the loudest loudest in church age and it wouldn't be right so that's why we we're harping on on the bride age because we're living in another age amen that's the reason that Wesley could not take Luther's message Luther was in one age Church age and Wesley was in another church age if Jesus would have come with the message of Moses it would not have worked if Moses would have come with the message of Noah it would not have worked that's why what is the evidence of having the the Holy Ghost is the ability to receive the word for what for this day we cannot have the Pentecostal message amen we need the message of the hour which is the bride H amen which is the message for this hour amen so so just these are not new I I believe so so we'll we're in the bright age so just a summary for this one the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost you see after the Pentecost there was no rapture right but before Pentecost after Jesus Christ gave up the ghost right the the sleeping Old Testament Saints woke up right because they were under the law the the blood of uh bulls and goats will not make them perfect so they need to wait for the perfect sacrifice amen so that's why that's the Rapture there in for the Old Testament so right now we've got something different the Pentecostals represent that again we're in the bright age the word of Noah would not work in in the days of Moses no more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here he tried to tell them you are dead to that you cannot have that amen so let let's have a parallel because we're thinking of the the ministry of Jesus Christ and Barbara Branham so that we know that there's always a pattern amen the ministry of Jesus Christ and the end time there is a parallel if you check Jesus Christ Ministry first and second pulls we talked about it it's healing and prophesying amen and then there's a quiet time for Jesus Christ because they forsake Him except some only the 12 apostles stayed with him and one is a Judas Iscariot right he's a traitor right and then his crucifixion if if you can see here and then the third pull he preached to the souls in prison and then the resurrection after uh when he was uh down there in the in the souls in prison three days and then when he came back and then they all resurrected that's the Old Testament rupture the third and the fourth rupture I'll put the timeline after and then if we put this end time parallel and time ministry first and second pulls up brother Branham healing prophesying again 1946 to 1963 but then there's quiet time for him as well because everyone was forsaking the word if you if you read the present the stage of my Ministry in 1962 August 8th you will see that he he he's actually uh uh you you can say disappointed already right because uh no one is hitting his uh his message no one is receiving his message right and and it and there's a parallel there there's always a purpose and there's always a pattern and then the crucify the crucifixion of Jesus Christ the indictment he preached in that man in 1963 July 7th and then the third pull itself opening of the word which is preaching to the law so you can see Jesus Christ went to the souls in prison right but that is in parallel with the third pool because the opening of the word is preaching to the lost but the bride will accept the message only the bride amen and then the resurrection which is the rapture which is for the New Testament rupture New Testament Saints amen let's continue with this you can see you might have seen this in the voice of God but I put some some notes on it the seven pics of Brian Branham this is in Madison actually Madison County in Montana so it's related to his name William Marion Branham right so br7 right and and before his first pool there are little picks here and then between the first and second pool and then this is the second pull it's he he rested a bit because he got sick he got sick there when he he was having a lot of Healing Ministry he rested but then before before the third pool he also went down and then he was about to go and be a bum he said he doesn't want to to proceed but then on the way back from Canada going going back there I think it's in uh standing on the Gap I I think that's the message when when Barbara Branham showed him this picks which is an everlasting sign right so so you can see the the pattern here with this name and also his three pools right and then that's the time he said that I will preach the gospel with all my heart whether I live or die or something he will preach it so these are uh uh you can say draw uh they're just drawings but this is the actual picture I think of that Madison County so if you checking Google is Brandon picks so you this might be good good to see and then Branham is uh in one of the pictures is behind it as well so you know God met him there right so so and that's why it was an everlasting sign for him that's why and there's a purpose for it so that you can be all manifested I can be manifested here amen otherwise we will not have the third pool amen so there's always a purpose amen so there are six raptures I I mentioned before I I might have preach this but then the thing is the first is Enoch second is Elijah then Jesus and the Old Testament Saints because when he preached uh the souls in prison for three days and then when he came back and then together with the Old Testament since they all went up so that's the third and fourth Rapture I mentioned in that table and then for here this is the fifth rupture which is the New Testament Saints which is us all the church ages all the seven Church ages New Testament Saints and then later on after three and a half years Moses and Elijah right will be raptured that's in uh after the end of the three and a half years tribulation that's before Millennium and then you can see the Millennium here is another one thousand years here that's not eternity yet that's a span of time right because 1 000 years so it means you can count it but then for us we have already our glorified body we already cross over here right that's why you can see it's very important to know that they were living in because every time two thousand years two thousand years two thousand years what are we waiting for we're in 2022 right now brothers and sisters it's later than we think oh we know Branham is always harping us it's later than you think later go and repent but he already got his glory he's already there with the uh you know in the sixth Dimension you can say which is the paradise of God but it's not yet in the Throne of God because they're waiting for us they cannot be perfected without us amen so that's why everything is resting on us amen so you can see this uh six raptures in the Bible and you can find this in the message uh the rapture so let's continue here uh all that the father giveth me shall come to me semicolon and then in him that cometh to me I will in no ice cast out so it means for us the bride and then the other one is anyone that wanted to come to him they might not have the Holy Ghost the foolish virgins didn't have the Holy Ghost but they will come to him they will look for the Holy Ghost it might be too late but for us we were so blessed that we we are elected before the foundation of the world without doing anything he just elected us amen so and also you can see John 16 12 here I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now so it means it's Progressive also right but for us it's Progressive but Brian Branham everything is already really revealed to him but for us we're progressing as we feed on the word amen we're not adding any more Revelations everything is there to be raptured it's already in this message amen so let's continue a very I I read this before now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos was manifest in the Sun and Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead badly and that Eternal one was the father manifesting flesh and thereby gained the title of sun even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn become became the main membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the river we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in Nancy there's nothing to Quicken I mentioned when we were having the breakfast I let's rephrase it if we can rephrase this we did not become seed by believing this message we believe this message because we were seed in the first place so it's not the other way around we we cannot we cannot sugar coat everything oh I I know all the coats ins and outs right no it is election we were elected we the seed was placed in us before the foundation of the world we we we cannot Merit it by our own righteousness so it's not like that the seed is there that's why so that's why we we pray for our children we pray for our loved ones because the seed will bring forth its own kind what kind of seed we are will our children be if they are not like us right we were Sinners Say by but by his grace we were saved amen we amen so we worshiped that's why that's why we work weekend it's not the other way around we cannot we cannot we cannot falsify or or make things work by our own Works basically amen so let me continue this one is very good also all the codes that are referring to us because the thing is the message of the hour is Christ and as the hope of glory and it's the word and if we read this look at the last days it'd be so close it deceived the very elected if it was possible but it's not possible right why the reason the elected won't be deceived you know why it's because they are the word oh brothers and sisters check check what we are right we are the word see just like the life isn't the life that's in the root I said a while ago it can't deny itself see it is the word and in the season of the word that's right the reason they elected Jesus said won't be deceived because they are that word they can't be nothing else they can't hear nothing else they don't know nothing else is that your sincere prayer brothers and sisters to be the word to be conformed to His Image amen we will have the mind of Christ amen so I will not read this but then we always take this this is related to Ezekiel because he talked to the dry bones fate comment by hearing but these are very dry they don't have ears right so it means what does what does that thing do it's it's the faith of the one speaking so brother Henry gave a good testimony he claimed it the power of the spoken word amen so if if we have that power you see the dry bones became alive it's as already the one that's speaking it's not the one that's hearing because these bones will not hear at all because they don't have any ears amen so yeah let's continue here I'm about to close maybe you'll wake up now so so now Brethren and sisters I want to ask you something then if we are born again of the spirit of God don't God don't have little weak parts and big strong parts he's all together God and if you had enough of God in you till it was just barely a shadow just a shadow that's enough power to make a new Earth brothers and sisters that's enough power to make a new moon and a new system it's God and it's strong and right now every believer in here where here we're repeating it has what it turned a life which is God's spirit in you and that power that will raise up the Dead that will heal the sick that will set orbits and conditions but you it's controlled by law that's that Spirit that's in you you are Sons and Daughters of God that same spirit that you've got in you will raise yourself up at the day of Resurrection that same spirit if that same Spirit dwells in you it will Quicken the Mortal our mortal body amen Jesus when he was here on Earth when he died his soul descended into hell and preach to the spirits that were in prison the souls in prison that repented not in the long suffering of the days of Noah his body went into the grave but before he died he commanded the spirit into the hands of God his Spirit went to God his soul went to hell and his body went to the Grave different locations and Jesus was barred out from Resurrection until the scripture could be fulfilled he could not come back because he had to stay in the grave for three days and nights because that's prophesied but when the scripture was all fulfilled this bar was taken away his Spirit descended to his soul his soul to his body and he rose again amen so you and when we die this is for us our souls will go under the altar of God where I was privileged to see yeah that's the beyond the curtain of time amen a few mornings ago as you know in the vision where the Bible speaks of our spirits will go to God who give it amen and our bodies shall return to dust of the earth 16 elements amen but someday when the scripture is fulfilled which is being fulfilled day by day amen our spirits will be released from God we'll pick up the soul and the soul to the body and I under I highlighted this and the power that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection oh brothers and sisters if there was a law there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it you have the power to do it oh brother the power of the spoken word isn't that wonderful whether we have money for payment or whatever forget about it right I mean God will take care of it anything between us and God is our God so that we should remove every that mortar there between between the Capstone and the body that should never be any Gap because the fullness of the world right we are he's the head we are the body we're just following him and if you got a shadow of the power of God in you you got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live in it Hallelujah isn't that beautiful if we can make a world and go live in it of course we we don't want all these things right especially like I forgot to mention we see the seven colors of the rainbow but you know the bright color right there are only six it's the number of men but the seven is the number of God right it's completion so you can see the numbers there's power in numbers amen so apply it I have a couple more apply it what this is the token apply the token and create that atmosphere we can create something if we can create the world into existence why not create atmosphere right create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it he's talking whoever we talk to right see oh you are you are if you get that token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a Christian they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold on to it see that's it so it's very important on what we speak because to get that power of the spoken word we must be speaking the word because if it's just by our own intellectual conception then it doesn't mean anything you can be a denomination of oneself right because that's you and and your mind and your spirit and your body but the soul belongs to God Amen so there's a power there's a power to create uh things into existence amen and we know that's that's the third pool amen oh that's that's so wonderful if you are a true seed if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will esteem this word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and this is the ending of this million churches actually this is my Earnest prayer for all of us may we hear what the spirit is bringing from the word for us today and uh let's read this one also because of election because of sovereignty of God it's good to to know uh our position amen thus if God has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that if it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of book of life but in the foreknowledge of God they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that and if there are those whose names were never placed upon a record of life we must accept that also look at the sovereignty of God right and if there are those who will enter into eternal life they didn't have eternal life but they will enter into eternal life after the white Throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind to and just to the elect of God who are his Brethren then we cannot but accept that so you see this message is so inclusive we think that we we are oh we are bright that's why you we will shun everyone that doesn't believe the message no this is very inclusive because you see because of us they will be able to enter into eternal life that's why with the hope of this generation every time that we preach behind this we're just so uh blessed that God gave us this grace and understanding and and who who can say two people will read the same Bible but for us it's it's it's alive it's quickened but but for them it's just a normal book they put the Bible in in the section of fiction when you go to Value Village or or to other bookstores they put it under fiction for them it's not true but for us it's a Living Word if there are those who will enter into a life eternal after the white Throne as a sheep as a Shepherd will uh divide the sheep from the goat but those sheep are not the bride those are it's it's a it's a type as a ship dividing as a Shepherd dividing the ship from the goat right being good and kind and just to the lack of God who are his Brethren then we cannot but accept that for who know it the mind of the Lord that he should instruct him rather let us be subject in faith to him who is our father and live so you see the sovereignty of God he we're just Clays right Clays we he's the Potter whatever he he designed us but we're so glad glory to God he made us bright he chose us he we didn't choose him he chose us amen so so now our topic is preserving uh God seed for a purpose and what is our purpose now to conclude right our purpose we must know our purpose so it's we read it it's to manifest Christ in this day we will be the living Bible walking Bible living Epistles red of all man amen and and and by doing that we will be imparting eternal life to others eternal life doesn't mean it's only for the bride there are other classes of people amen so we're so thankful that uh he gave us this election he adopted us as Sons and Daughters he he chose us as the bride right so what else can we ask for amen whether we live whether we die we're Christ that's why we're living in the in the bright age now it's the eighth day for us although eight days Beyond Millennium right Beyond Millennium that's the day it will go back from eternity to Eternity again but for us we're already living in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and what is Heavenly places it's the position in Christ we know our position oh brothers and sisters I hope I hope this is a blessing to you because it's a blessing to me I just want to thank you for listening I know it's a Wednesday pray for me as well and uh [Applause] there's a lot this message says 1237 messages so if you but uh the thing that we need to be ruptured is already in there so we just have to dig on it and the fivefold Ministries is required for the perfecting of the Saints amen that's why he uh praise the lord we we have such and we just want to impart our our little gifts maybe so if uh yeah if if the Lord Paris because the bread needs to be perfected needs to be matured and how can he be matured under the presence of the son which is the word made flesh today through US amen God doesn't speak directly to us because uh but he does that in a prophetic way one of the fivefold ministry is a prophet right but that's not the major prophet all the fivefold in Ephesians 4 11 will fall under the under this message of the hour and we're clear with that that the rapturing faith lies in this message and we're thankful amen we have the the Vindicated Prophet we can see we have the written word we have the message of the hour which is the spoken word right and we have the manifestation vindicate to vindicate that the spoken word and the written word are correct right and we're so thankful because the thing is uh even by science how can you even by time you will see where what day we are living in amen we are the end time brothers and sisters and and we're so thankful I'll invite the musicians and uh and brother Berry so I hope it's a blessing to you brothers and sisters and uh pray for me as well this Sunday I'll be in Spruce Grove so yeah for two Services brother Jerry invited me to speak for him I might expound a little bit also but this is burberry is saying this will be your warm-up but uh but uh yeah God bless you amen [Applause] did you enjoy that tonight maybe stand with me certainly love the thought you know there's so much there but it all comes down to one thing and that is recognizing who we are and I'm looking for a visual of that triangle like he said with no mortar in it nothing between seeing that Capstone come right down on top of it and I was just thinking about it when we were looking at it tonight you know it shows the the seven Church ages and then it shows Christ and in the middle I believe it shows love in between the two and I think it's still depicting that there's a space between the two and I think there's coming a day where there isn't going to be a space between the two where we're going to start talking about it being one triangle the only thing that's missing is two little lines to make it one complete triangle that's the only thing that would change it I think it's a wonderful wonderful depiction that we saw tonight let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness to us Lord we thank you for the reassuring Lord Jesus to know that you have already chosen us way before we were even formed in our mother's womb Lord Jesus before there was even a speck of Stardust you had us in your mind Lord Jesus and father to to try and even comprehend that you being the great creator you you you condescended into the the body of human flesh Lord Jesus to try and reveal yourself to mankind and Lord Jesus tonight we recognize that you have done that once again but not the way you did the First Time Lord the way you chose to the second time and that's by your spirit and we know that the true identification of having that spirit in US is the ability to receive all of the word for our day not everyone can do that and if we can do that we have reason to rejoice father we love you and we thank you tonight for your goodness to us thank you for revealing yourself to us just a little further Lord for speaking to us about election Lord Jesus recognizing there's nothing that we've ever done in our lives there's nothing that we could ever do the only thing we could do is just Express that life that's within us and Lord we know that it's such a beautiful thing to look at the life of the the the the plant the the wheat knowing that there's a seed and it goes back to a seed but it's not even the the plant that we're interested in it's the life that's in the plant and father we pray that that life that very life would just live out through your children as we leave here tonight father we pray that that life would just Lord live out in a greater way in each one of our lives that it would be less of us father and more of you and if it Be Your Will for us to meet again on Sunday Lord we just ask that you would just take that life and just increase it to us Lord father let us begin to recognize what we truly are here in this day not just Sons and Daughters of God going to and fro and getting getting more in this world but father we're we're looking to that great day of resurrection and Rapture Lord as we heard about there had to be a fulfillment of scripture that had to be an amount of time that went by and father who knows maybe we won't even meet here on Sunday morning you know and we trust that you will take us with you when you go father Lord we just ask that you would keep your hand upon each one of us tonight Lord be with those who couldn't make it tonight for whatever reason wherever they are whatever they're doing father we pray that you would just continue to to watch over us to brood over each one of us father Lord we love you and we
