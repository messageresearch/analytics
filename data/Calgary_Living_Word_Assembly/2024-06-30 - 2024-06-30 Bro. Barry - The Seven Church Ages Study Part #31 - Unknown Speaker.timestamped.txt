[37:51] Revelations chapter 2
[38:00] chapter 2 verse2 amen we're in the
[38:03] pergami and church
[38:05] age and the word tonight is to the the
[38:09] church in
[38:15] pergamus Revelations 2:12 it says and to
[38:18] the angel of the church in pergamus WR
[38:21] these things saith he which hath the
[38:24] sharp sword with two edges
[38:27] I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest
[38:30] even where Satan's seat is and thou
[38:34] holdest fast my name and H has not
[38:37] denied my faith even in those days
[38:39] wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr
[38:42] who was slain among you where Satan
[38:45] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[38:48] thee because thou Hast there them that
[38:52] hold the doctrine of balum who taught
[38:56] bailo to cast a stumbling block before
[38:59] the children of Israel to eat things
[39:02] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[39:06] fornication so hast thou also them that
[39:10] hold the doctrine of the
[39:12] nicians which thing I hate repent or
[39:16] else I will come unto thee quickly and
[39:19] will fight against them with the sword
[39:22] of my
[39:23] mouth he that hath an ear let him hear
[39:27] what the Spirit saith unto the churches
[39:29] to him that overcometh will I give to
[39:31] eat of the Hidden mana and will give him
[39:34] a white
[39:35] stone and in the stone a new name
[39:39] written which no man knoweth saving he
[39:43] that receiveth it amen let's just turn
[39:47] over
[39:48] to St
[39:50] John chapter 15
[40:04] many verses in here I'd like to read but
[40:05] for time's sake we'll just read verse 7
[40:08] amen of St John chapter 15 very familiar
[40:12] scripture but I believe the more we read
[40:15] it the more it becomes revealed to
[40:18] us if ye abide in
[40:21] me and my words abide in you you shall
[40:26] ask what what you will and it shall be
[40:29] done unto you amen let's just bow one
[40:32] more
[40:33] time Heavenly Father tonight Lord Jesus
[40:37] my desire is that Lord your words would
[40:41] abide in us and father we know that your
[40:44] will is your word and father the Bible
[40:47] in entirely is your word and the message
[40:50] of the hour Lord Jesus is a is a an
[40:55] expounding of your word a magnification
[40:58] of your word a tying up of all the Loose
[41:01] Ends the Mysteries being revealed in
[41:03] your word but father we know there's
[41:05] something in this word that we've read
[41:07] tonight father that says not word but
[41:11] words a plurality and father tonight I
[41:14] pray that your words would be in the
[41:18] mouths and hearts of all of your
[41:20] children here tonight father that Lord
[41:22] Jesus you would have control of Our
[41:25] Lives that you would have control of our
[41:28] minds Lord that you would have control
[41:30] of our mouths Lord Jesus that you would
[41:32] have control of our arms and our feet
[41:35] Lord Jesus father that we could
[41:37] surrender ourselves entirely unto you
[41:40] father Lord Jesus that you would abide
[41:43] within we just commit each life into
[41:46] your hands now we pray that you would
[41:48] just be glorified in all that's said and
[41:49] done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen

[43:13] just getting into our scripture tonight
[43:14] I think it's just a beautiful thing if
[43:16] ye abide in me and my words abide in you
[43:19] ye shall ask what you will and it shall
[43:21] be done unto you and you know when we
[43:23] have his spirit in US brothers and
[43:25] sisters we can ask whatever we will and
[43:27] we'll never ask a Miss we don't need to
[43:30] worry about asking incorrectly and
[43:32] that's why it's so important to have his
[43:34] Spirit leading and guiding us we want to
[43:36] make sure that uh we actually have his
[43:40] Spirit that's the only Spirit that's the
[43:42] only thing that will help us in the day
[43:45] in which we live I just wanted to ask
[43:48] did Sister Amy make it to service
[43:49] tonight you're here God bless you Sister
[43:52] Sister Amy is here from Halifax and uh
[43:55] she's living in Calgary now and wanted
[43:56] to be in service so God bless you Sister
[43:59] I'm so glad you could make it to
[44:01] fellowship with us tonight I trust you
[44:03] feel right at
[44:04] home um I I got uh looking at the uh the
[44:10] placemark where we left off last time
[44:12] and I just thought my goodness this is
[44:14] so rich it's so good I have just about
[44:17] all of the pages highlighted in my book
[44:19] here and I just I think it's such a
[44:21] wonderful thing this part where we
[44:23] stopped in the pergami and church age is
[44:26] probably I would say one of the most
[44:28] profound parts of the message of the
[44:30] hour brother Brandon preached the uh
[44:33] seals uh sorry he preached the church
[44:36] ages in
[44:37] 1960 and uh you know I don't think he
[44:40] changed a lot there was some grammar
[44:42] isation that happened there was some
[44:45] probably editing and and polishing maybe
[44:47] but the same thoughts apply in the
[44:50] exposition of the seven Church ages that
[44:51] was released in 1965 I think it was the
[44:54] book was it was being published all the
[44:57] way up until then but released in
[45:00] 1965 and uh you know some would say that
[45:03] brother L Veil uh it was his book and
[45:06] others would say well he did a bunch of
[45:08] it and and brother bradam did a bunch of
[45:10] it but this was the inspiration of the
[45:12] Holy Ghost to a Vindicated Prophet
[45:14] that's what this book was and I think
[45:16] that's what we all believe and if it's
[45:17] not I truly hope it is what we will
[45:20] believe because uh this isn't uh about a
[45:23] Teaching Ministry we know that Jesus
[45:25] said go ye into all the world world and
[45:27] preach the gospel not teach the gospel
[45:30] Teaching Ministry brother bradam says it
[45:32] an adoption is what actually
[45:35] positionally places Us in the promised
[45:37] land it gives us the ability to go from
[45:39] being saved to recognizing who we are
[45:42] there's no doing away with the Teaching
[45:43] Ministry but the Teaching Ministry is
[45:45] not what we're after we're after the
[45:47] Vindicated prophet's message the tying
[45:50] up of all the Loose Ends and that's
[45:52] really what I'm getting at the five-fold
[45:53] ministry is a vital component it's the
[45:55] only way in the day which we live for
[45:57] the Saints to be perfected just playing
[46:00] tapes is not enough Ephesians 4 is
[46:04] enough where we left off last time uh in
[46:07] my book is Page 188 uh paragraph 55 of
[46:11] the pgam and church age I'm just going
[46:13] to go back a little bit and and try and
[46:17] refresh it's been so long since we were
[46:20] uh doing this I trust that we could just
[46:22] sort of pick up and and capture the
[46:24] thought tonight brother bradam he said
[46:26] now we ask what is the will of God there
[46:30] is only one way to know his will and
[46:34] that is by the word of God it's such a
[46:37] beautiful thing it just it just it just
[46:40] dovetails it just meshes it's just a
[46:41] hand to a glove for what we've been
[46:43] studying I just love it Lamentations
[46:47] 3:37 is is who is he that saith and it
[46:51] cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth
[46:54] it not he says there it is if it isn't
[46:58] in the word you can't have it so we
[47:01] can't ask unless it's in the word and we
[47:05] can't petition or ask unless it's in his
[47:09] name there it is again Jesus the name is
[47:13] the word will you can't separate God and
[47:18] the word amen they are one but we know
[47:24] that's the trick of the devil to get
[47:26] right in the middle middle of the church
[47:28] right into the framework of the
[47:30] Christian church and try and defile it
[47:33] and cause it to become lukewarm and
[47:36] Powerless simply by changing that one
[47:40] thought separation of those well maybe
[47:42] the word isn't exactly inspired by God
[47:45] maybe it's not exactly God in print form
[47:47] maybe it's just not exactly when we
[47:49] start to do that brothers and sisters
[47:51] what we do is we fall for the trick of
[47:54] the devil the Trap Of The Devil to try
[47:56] and separate them as soon as we do that
[47:58] then we find ourselves in that position
[48:01] we don't want to be there carrying on 57
[48:04] now then this word he has left behind on
[48:07] the printed page is a part of him when
[48:10] you accept it by faith into a spirit
[48:14] filled
[48:16] life I think that's just I don't know my
[48:21] he said that his word was life John
[48:25] 663b but that is exactly what he is I am
[48:29] the way the truth and the life John 14:6
[48:32] If any man have not the spirit of Christ
[48:34] he is none of his Romans 89b there it is
[48:39] he is he is spirit and he is life that
[48:43] is exactly what the word is that is
[48:44] exactly what Jesus is he is the word
[48:48] amen so when a spirit
[48:52] born spirit filled man
[48:56] I'm going to say or woman in
[49:00] faith takes the word in his heart and
[49:04] places it upon his lips or her
[49:08] lips why that is the same as deity
[49:13] speaking amen but if you take the trick
[49:15] of the devil and you start to dissect
[49:18] and say well the word maybe it's not all
[49:20] the way God maybe that interpretation
[49:22] maybe this maybe that that's why I say
[49:24] brothers and sisters why would anybody
[49:26] want to try and accept a different
[49:28] version of the Bible than what the
[49:29] Vindicated Prophet taught
[49:32] from some people do they truly want to
[49:35] do something different than that it
[49:37] doesn't make any sense God tied up all
[49:40] the loose ends in the Bible through the
[49:42] King James
[49:43] version so if we can have faith in that
[49:47] that God sent a prophet we could have
[49:48] faith that God sent that Prophet with a
[49:51] word fitly spoken for our day so we
[49:53] could take that King James version bring
[49:55] it into our our our lives and take it by
[49:59] faith when we take that by faith and we
[50:01] begin to speak that word we have a
[50:03] Vindicated Prophet speaking these words
[50:05] but it goes further than that that's God
[50:07] speaking through that Prophet to a
[50:09] people saying why that's the same as me
[50:13] speaking and what that speaks to
[50:14] brothers and sisters this is where it
[50:16] gets real good this speaks to adoption
[50:18] you're not just becoming a child you're
[50:21] not just becoming a son or a daughter
[50:23] you always were but you're just coming
[50:26] into your position now where you have
[50:28] not only the checkbook but you have all
[50:31] of the bank account to back it up and
[50:33] whatever you say
[50:36] goes that is such a powerful thought
[50:39] when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in
[50:42] faith takes the word into his heart and
[50:44] places it upon his lips why that's the
[50:47] same as deity speaking I think that's so
[50:49] beautiful if we are willing to just
[50:51] simply follow the word of God follow the
[50:53] word of God given to us by a Vindicated
[50:55] Prophet every single letter of it not be
[50:57] willing to try and dissect it and just
[50:59] kick out the devil when he comes around
[51:01] and tries to get us to dissect it and
[51:02] say well I think it should be this way I
[51:04] want to do it that way whatever the
[51:05] tradition is the other way when we're
[51:07] willing to push all of that aside and
[51:09] say just be it unto me just like Mary
[51:11] according to Thy word Angel messenger
[51:14] said this is the instruction hey I'll
[51:16] take that instruction and I'll take it
[51:18] by faith amen and I'll begin to live it
[51:21] by
[51:22] faith then when I speak God speaks amen
[51:29] but you know we're not going to do it
[51:32] with our
[51:33] spirit when he's talking about Spirit
[51:36] born and spirit filled there's many
[51:38] spirits in the
[51:40] world and there's a lot of religious
[51:42] spirits in the world and when we try to
[51:46] use a religious spirit to speak the word
[51:48] of God and activate God by faith
[51:51] brothers and sisters we're not going to
[51:53] get the right results but remember It's
[51:56] Tricky because Satan can impersonate any
[51:58] gift H and Satan's really religious he's
[52:01] the most religious of them all isn't he
[52:04] fundamental is what we heard last
[52:06] Wednesday
[52:08] fundamentalist Cain his son was
[52:11] fundamental he knew how to
[52:14] worship he went to the same
[52:17] church but he didn't have the right
[52:19] Spirit he could never have the right
[52:21] spirit because he was of his father the
[52:25] devil
[52:26] but boy when we're willing to just say
[52:28] Amen to the word and and and become Holy
[52:32] Spirit born holy spirit filled according
[52:35] to the message of the hour in our day
[52:38] brothers and sisters just go
[52:41] forwards you're going to push back all
[52:43] the devils in front of you Satan doesn't
[52:45] even have a foothold to stand on when a
[52:47] person comes to that place
[52:50] am brother Bram says it here every
[52:53] Mountain has to
[52:54] go I just love the next sentence Satan
[52:57] cannot stand before that man not just
[53:00] brother Barry saying it Satan cannot
[53:03] stand before that woman Satan cannot
[53:05] stand before that child when you take a
[53:07] little child that's willing to take the
[53:09] word that God gave to this age through a
[53:11] Vindicated Prophet where that little
[53:13] child says Amen to that word gets that
[53:16] inspiration gets baptized receives the
[53:18] baptism of the Holy Spirit still lives
[53:20] in the flesh still makes mistakes still
[53:22] gets in trouble by parents still gets
[53:24] scolded but that doesn't change the fact
[53:26] that they take the entire word and make
[53:28] that their absolute in their life and
[53:31] sometimes even preach to Mommy and Daddy
[53:34] when that child speaks brothers and
[53:36] sisters it's the same as God speaking
[53:39] and you know what Satan cannot stand
[53:41] before that
[53:42] child Satan cannot stand before that
[53:45] husband or that wife ever who it is
[53:50] Satan cannot stand before that man isn't
[53:52] that wonderful to think about brothers
[53:54] and sisters get the Holy Ghost
[53:57] when you speak God
[54:01] speaks if the church way back there in
[54:04] that third age had only held on to the
[54:05] revelation of the Living Word in their
[54:07] midst power of God would not have faded
[54:10] as it did in those Dark Ages can you
[54:13] believe
[54:14] that and right today when the church
[54:17] returns to the word in faith doesn't
[54:21] return to to to a Creed doesn't return
[54:24] to a Dogma doesn't return to an assembly
[54:28] doesn't return to a tradition when the
[54:31] when the church returns to the word in
[54:34] faith we can say without doubt that the
[54:37] glory of
[54:39] God and the wonderful acts of God will
[54:42] be in our midst
[54:43] again it's the word first brothers and
[54:46] sisters let everything else go second
[54:50] third forth first is the word first is
[54:54] the word
[54:58] now we're going to
[55:01] begin one night as I was seeking the
[55:04] Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up
[55:06] my pen and
[55:09] write as I grasp the pen to write see
[55:12] this is real good now at this point at
[55:14] this particular point when we read this
[55:16] when we hear this we've got the
[55:18] opportunity to say Amen that man was
[55:21] inspired by the Holy Ghost himself Jesus
[55:24] Christ what some people would consider
[55:26] to be one part of the Trinity one of
[55:28] those
[55:29] people it was either God or it was just
[55:33] a
[55:34] man and right here when you read these
[55:36] words when you hear these words spoken
[55:38] you've got that that that opportunity to
[55:41] accept it or to reject it right amen one
[55:44] night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy
[55:47] Spirit told me to pick up my pen and
[55:48] right I know every one of us here
[55:50] believes this with all their heart don't
[55:52] get me wrong this just gets me excited
[55:54] because I think it's so good there could
[55:56] be somebody that's never heard this
[55:57] before and I think it's important for
[55:59] them to to realize it he says as I grasp
[56:02] the pen to write his Spirit gave me a
[56:06] message for the
[56:07] church and I just think goodness sakes
[56:10] if there was a prophet in the land
[56:11] wouldn't you want to hear what that
[56:12] message
[56:14] is wow his Spirit gave me a message for
[56:18] the church I want to bring it to you he
[56:21] could have just said I got it I got that
[56:24] message and you know be the odd person
[56:27] I'll led into my inner circle a and
[56:29] we'll have a club it'll just be the
[56:31] exclusive ones we we'll be the the
[56:34] exclusive
[56:35] Brethren I'm sorry if somebody is the
[56:38] exclusive Brethren there is actually a
[56:39] denomination called that but you know I
[56:41] I heard a brother say that one time I I
[56:43] was raised in the exclusive breth and I
[56:45] said well isn't that
[56:46] us is isn't that what who who we are I
[56:50] thought we
[56:51] were says I want to bring it to you it
[56:53] has to do with the word and the brother
[56:57] there's nobody
[56:59] exclusive and a prophet of God wants to
[57:01] bring it to his bride he doesn't want to
[57:03] keep it for himself he wants to Simply
[57:05] do the introduction just like Ellie eer
[57:07] did with Isaac and
[57:10] Rebecca so he brings it here's what I'm
[57:13] trying to say to
[57:15] you now this is in yeah
[57:19] italicized go back a little bit can you
[57:22] go back a little
[57:23] bit yes so you can see that it goes into
[57:26] a italicized words it's for a
[57:29] reason and that reason is somebody else
[57:32] is being quoted
[57:34] here this is not just William Mary and
[57:37] bradam saying these words this is not
[57:40] this is where it changes gears brothers
[57:41] and sisters this is where it makes my
[57:43] hair stand up on end when I look at this
[57:45] here is what I
[57:48] am trying to say to you to me that says
[57:52] volumes right there here's what I am
[57:56] trying to say to you the law of
[57:58] reproduction is that each species brings
[58:02] forth after its own kind even according
[58:04] to Genesis 1:1 and God said let the
[58:08] Earth bring forth grass the herb
[58:11] yielding seed and the fruit yielding
[58:13] tree tree yielding fruit after his kind
[58:17] whose seed is in itself upon the Earth
[58:20] and it was
[58:23] so now we go on with this in the
[58:26] italicized words knowing that this is
[58:29] not just William Mary and Bram speaking
[58:31] here this is the Holy Ghost speaking to
[58:35] his bride through William Mary and
[58:37] bradam now there's a group of people
[58:39] that will say Amen to this word I accept
[58:42] it
[58:43] unequivocally all of it and there's
[58:45] other people that will say well I'll
[58:46] take some of it and I'll leave some of
[58:48] it and and brother Bram talks about
[58:50] those people a little further down when
[58:51] we get going in here but isn't it
[58:53] wonderful to think that this is not just
[58:55] a speaking this this is not just some
[58:59] strange random Spirit coming around and
[59:01] maybe just anointing him with a little
[59:02] bit of
[59:03] religiosity uh this is the Holy Ghost
[59:06] this is God himself in spirit form
[59:09] coming down and ministering this so that
[59:12] we could hear it I I think this is just
[59:15] fascinating paragraph 61 he says
[59:17] whatever life was in the seed came forth
[59:20] into a plant and then into fruit now I
[59:26] just want to come
[59:27] back and read St John 15 verse 5 maybe
[59:33] four maybe three let's start with St
[59:38] John 15 verse one if you don't mind are
[59:42] you able to bring that up brother
[59:44] Logan just for time sake we'll just
[59:47] bring it up here St John chapter 15
[59:50] verse one what does he say Here I
[59:54] Am The True Vine
[59:57] and my father is the
[59:58] husbandman every branch in me that
[1:00:02] beareth not fruit he taketh
[1:00:04] away and every branch that beareth fruit
[1:00:07] he purgeth it that it may bring forth
[1:00:12] more
[1:00:14] fruit now ye are clean through the word
[1:00:18] which I have spoken unto
[1:00:22] you abide in me and I you as I read this
[1:00:25] brothers and sisters I hope my desire is
[1:00:26] that we would just want to abide in him
[1:00:28] and that he would abide in us the more
[1:00:30] that we would just abide in him that we
[1:00:32] would just keep falling in love with him
[1:00:34] over and over again not just sometimes
[1:00:38] it's just one and done that we would
[1:00:40] recognize this the word that we're
[1:00:41] speaking here he's talking about the
[1:00:44] tree yielding fruit after his kind going
[1:00:47] right back to the scripture saying that
[1:00:50] abide in me and I in you as the branch
[1:00:52] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:00:55] abide in the Vine
[1:00:56] no more can ye except ye abide in me I
[1:00:59] am the vine ye are the branches he that
[1:01:02] abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:01:04] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[1:01:08] you can do
[1:01:10] nothing the same bringeth forth much
[1:01:13] fruit and much fruit isn't just bringing
[1:01:16] forth fruit that we can eat and fruit
[1:01:18] maybe of the spirit that we can look
[1:01:19] around and see we got goodness and
[1:01:20] gentleness and meekness and and and and
[1:01:22] joy and longsuffering not just that
[1:01:24] brothers and sisters that we could
[1:01:26] actually see those seeds in the fruit
[1:01:30] and those seeds would actually burst and
[1:01:32] come to life when this word hits that
[1:01:36] seed it's just beautiful whatever life
[1:01:40] was in the seed came forth into a plant
[1:01:42] and then into Fruit the very same law
[1:01:46] applies to the church
[1:01:48] today whatever seed started the church
[1:01:52] will come forth and be like the Original
[1:01:54] Seed because it is the same
[1:01:59] seed in these last days the true bride
[1:02:02] Church Christ seed will come to The
[1:02:07] Headstone amen brothers and sisters I
[1:02:10] still haven't done that graphic yet we
[1:02:12] still show it as the Pyramid of the
[1:02:14] stature of the perfect man but it it
[1:02:16] comes to a flat spot and then there's a
[1:02:19] space between and then there's another
[1:02:21] pyramid on top of that you know where
[1:02:23] we're at brothers and sisters I want to
[1:02:24] say this again tonight we're at one
[1:02:26] pyramid The Headstone is nearing it's
[1:02:29] not separation there I remember there's
[1:02:32] no you've heard it too there's no Mor
[1:02:34] between those two brother bradam says it
[1:02:36] I believe the Lord says it through
[1:02:37] brother bradam you look at the pyramid
[1:02:39] they made those stones so clean and so
[1:02:41] tight together there's no mortar between
[1:02:43] them you can't even fit a razor blade
[1:02:45] between those stones it's for a purpose
[1:02:48] but the pyramid wasn't capped off
[1:02:49] brother Bram talks about it in the
[1:02:51] message and the spoken word is the
[1:02:52] Original Seed if you listen to that part
[1:02:55] where he talks about pick up your pen
[1:02:57] and write he speaks about this in that
[1:02:58] message very clearly amen
[1:03:03] my that headstone brothers and sisters I
[1:03:06] believe has come down that's that's my
[1:03:09] own personal belief and I think maybe
[1:03:11] some might not believe it but something
[1:03:13] really different happened at sunset
[1:03:15] Mountain it wasn't just a an opportunity
[1:03:18] to snap a picture to say something
[1:03:20] Supernatural happen in the sky over
[1:03:22] Arizona
[1:03:24] sometime that was the headstone coming
[1:03:27] down go brother Bram goes on to say here
[1:03:31] and she will be the Super Church a super
[1:03:34] race as she nears
[1:03:38] him it's just so beautiful they and the
[1:03:41] bride will be so much like him they will
[1:03:44] even be in his very
[1:03:46] image this is in order to be United with
[1:03:49] him they will be
[1:03:52] one and this is really my heart brothers
[1:03:55] and sisters where I'm going just maybe
[1:03:58] with Ministry and everything this next
[1:04:00] sentence they will be the very
[1:04:03] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:04:05] God Amen how many very manifestations of
[1:04:09] the word of the Living God do we have
[1:04:12] here tonight I I believe every single
[1:04:14] one represented here that believes that
[1:04:16] God sent a prophet that believes in this
[1:04:18] book that we're reading here that
[1:04:20] believes in this word is truly the
[1:04:23] literal manifestation of the word of the
[1:04:25] living Living God denominations cannot
[1:04:28] produce this is what this word says here
[1:04:31] denominations cannot produce this
[1:04:34] because it's wrong
[1:04:36] seed now they can have a lot of
[1:04:38] manifestation but don't look for
[1:04:40] manifestation we covered that already in
[1:04:42] this book he said away with
[1:04:44] manifestation away with experience
[1:04:47] making the plum line of our Christian
[1:04:49] experience that whether we've got the
[1:04:51] Holy Ghost in our life or not whether we
[1:04:53] see many signs and wonders whether our
[1:04:55] bank account are full whether all these
[1:04:57] different things are happening in our
[1:04:58] lives don't look at those look at your
[1:05:00] ability to say Amen to the word when
[1:05:02] it's preached because it shouldn't
[1:05:04] matter who preaches it if it's truth
[1:05:07] something inside you is going to be
[1:05:08] going
[1:05:10] amen and and we heard it we heard it uh
[1:05:13] through the fivefold ministry I believe
[1:05:15] it was four or five ministers that have
[1:05:18] come through here recently isn't it you
[1:05:20] know what the the resounding theme is
[1:05:22] say Amen to the word every time you say
[1:05:24] Amen to the word you're not amening the
[1:05:25] Minister you're amening God you're
[1:05:27] saying be it unto me according to Thy
[1:05:28] word and when we do that God blesses
[1:05:32] us denominations can't produce this
[1:05:35] wrong seed they will produce their
[1:05:37] Creeds and their dogmas mixed with the
[1:05:40] word they'll they'll mix it up a little
[1:05:42] bit they'll try and separate God they'll
[1:05:44] say the word is you know maybe it's just
[1:05:46] not the pure interpretation or you know
[1:05:48] Jesus maybe wasn't exactly God he was
[1:05:51] you know he he he didn't receive the
[1:05:53] spirit until a certain point and you
[1:05:55] know in another point in his life in his
[1:05:57] ministry the spirit left him so he maybe
[1:05:59] wasn't truly God you know no he was God
[1:06:05] Jesus Christ was God and he came down
[1:06:08] and and experienced the full measure of
[1:06:10] all of the pain in flesh and he did that
[1:06:14] so that he could pay the price for us so
[1:06:16] that we could be the recipients of this
[1:06:18] word in our
[1:06:22] day I just can't help but go back to it
[1:06:24] they will be the very manifestation of
[1:06:26] the word of the Living God just like
[1:06:28] Jesus was the very manifestation of the
[1:06:31] word of the Living God we're going to be
[1:06:33] the same way brothers and
[1:06:37] sisters he says they will produce their
[1:06:39] Creeds their dogmas mixed with the word
[1:06:41] this mongrelize brings forth a hybrid
[1:06:44] product what happens when you have a
[1:06:46] hybrid product it can't reproduce the
[1:06:49] word it can reproduce itself again you
[1:06:52] can have a hybridization that will
[1:06:54] create high hybridized people hybridized
[1:06:58] Believers with hybridized worship and
[1:07:00] and they'll have hybridized
[1:07:03] experiences hybridization will be the
[1:07:05] theme and that's what will happen and
[1:07:07] everyone will be doing it but just
[1:07:09] because everyone's doing something does
[1:07:11] that make it
[1:07:12] correct it doesn't it's got to be
[1:07:16] according to the plum line the word of
[1:07:20] God you know they've even tried
[1:07:22] mongrelize in the message people have
[1:07:25] tried to bring
[1:07:27] in
[1:07:29] Psychology we'll try and hybridize the
[1:07:31] way to to make a man love his wife
[1:07:34] better and to make a wife love her
[1:07:36] husband better and to to to maybe raise
[1:07:40] children God's way to do things
[1:07:43] differently try and hybridize it with
[1:07:44] the message of the hour there ain't no
[1:07:46] hybridization with the message of the
[1:07:48] hour brothers and sisters and you know
[1:07:49] what interesting because you can take
[1:07:51] water and and oil or oil and vinegar
[1:07:54] everyone here knows about emulsification
[1:07:57] I think that's what you call it you can
[1:07:58] take it and Shake It Up and mix it up
[1:08:00] and it will actually get really mixed up
[1:08:02] there'll be lots of little bubbles you
[1:08:03] could even take a a hand mixer and just
[1:08:05] really crank on it and make it foamy
[1:08:07] frothy it'll look like it's all one but
[1:08:10] take it and just set it there for a
[1:08:11] little while give it some time and just
[1:08:13] see what happens to it because it will
[1:08:15] not mix you cannot mix it is that right
[1:08:19] brother to be so you cannot mix it he's
[1:08:22] a chemist he knows but you don't have to
[1:08:25] be a to do that you just have to make
[1:08:26] salad dressing sometime in your kitchen
[1:08:29] try and mix oil and water it doesn't
[1:08:33] work try and mix something in with the
[1:08:36] message it's been tried in the message
[1:08:38] the other thing that's happened that's
[1:08:39] so apparent we're all familiar with it
[1:08:41] is
[1:08:42] legalization to say that we do this this
[1:08:44] way and we do that that way and you're
[1:08:47] not doing it that way so we need to
[1:08:49] scold you and remind you you need to do
[1:08:51] it there our way or you're out no
[1:08:55] right get people to Christ and let
[1:08:58] Christ show them what needs to happen
[1:09:00] from the inside
[1:09:03] outen legalization it's mongrelize with
[1:09:07] the word trying to make it something
[1:09:11] else what happens in time you just leave
[1:09:13] it like that that that oil and the and
[1:09:15] the water or the oil and the vinegar in
[1:09:17] time it will actually
[1:09:19] show but you can't separate them God
[1:09:22] said don't try and separate the the
[1:09:24] wheat from the tears or or you'll mess
[1:09:26] up the wheat just let them all grow
[1:09:28] together and the word will do the
[1:09:32] separating that's why I think it's so
[1:09:34] good and I just love it whenever I hear
[1:09:36] people get upset or maybe fussy about
[1:09:39] preaching about the Holy Ghost I'm just
[1:09:41] going to preach it more because that's
[1:09:43] the only way brothers and sisters
[1:09:45] anything other than the Holy Ghost is
[1:09:46] going to be destruction in the age in
[1:09:48] which we live just like in Noah's day
[1:09:50] the only way was to get in the boat and
[1:09:53] they had how many years of that 25 years
[1:09:56] of getting the boat the old old bald
[1:09:59] fella he must have had sunstroke beating
[1:10:01] on the wood up there isn't that what the
[1:10:02] prophet said and they mocked him they
[1:10:04] laughed at him everyone in his church o
[1:10:07] only people that went in was his family
[1:10:09] and that might have been just because
[1:10:10] they felt guilty for him they felt sorry
[1:10:12] for the old guy who knows brother Bram
[1:10:16] in in this book here anyways in
[1:10:18] paragraph 62 he says the first son Adam
[1:10:20] was the spoken seed word of God he was
[1:10:25] given a bride to reproduce
[1:10:28] himself that's why the bride was given
[1:10:30] to him to reproduce himself to produce
[1:10:33] another Son of God and we know I I think
[1:10:37] that we could take a whole entire Sermon
[1:10:38] Just on that couple of sentences right
[1:10:41] there brothers and sisters he was given
[1:10:43] a bride to reproduce himself but he was
[1:10:45] given a bride to reproduce himself with
[1:10:47] the spoken word being the Original
[1:10:49] Seed and she wanted to choose to
[1:10:52] actually go with what the devil said the
[1:10:54] devil said no no no you can do an act
[1:10:56] and you can make it happen yourself you
[1:10:59] don't have to wait for God to do it
[1:11:00] after you speak it you can just make it
[1:11:02] happen yourself you can actually be
[1:11:04] independent you can be a strong woman
[1:11:07] and and just do it your way and she took
[1:11:10] that to her husband and he realized what
[1:11:12] had already happened and the only
[1:11:14] salvation for her was for him to step
[1:11:16] out of his position as an eternal being
[1:11:19] at that point and he saved his wife but
[1:11:22] we know that Adam he was given that
[1:11:24] bride to reproduce himself and that's is
[1:11:28] why the bride was given to him to
[1:11:30] reproduce himself to produce another Son
[1:11:32] of God but she fell she fell by
[1:11:37] hybridization and she caused him to
[1:11:40] die brothers and sisters in our day
[1:11:42] we're not going to die we can go and and
[1:11:45] and hybridize right and and sometimes
[1:11:48] when we hybridize religion hybridize the
[1:11:50] word hybridize our ideas in our church
[1:11:52] and and mix it and mongrelize it and
[1:11:54] make it our our way we've got a church
[1:11:56] and that's vibrant look at all the
[1:11:58] people that come and and we get more and
[1:11:59] more people and we make it so amazing
[1:12:02] because we get results people want to
[1:12:04] come and attend but if it's not
[1:12:06] according to the word it's a
[1:12:07] hybridization and what it's going to do
[1:12:09] is cause death we're going to have a
[1:12:12] church full of people that are going to
[1:12:13] say and brother Barry the rapture's gone
[1:12:17] I've been trying to text my friends and
[1:12:19] they're just
[1:12:21] gone where did you lead us
[1:12:24] to and I'll have to say destruction
[1:12:26] because we just hybridized we we made it
[1:12:28] good and we made it fun and we made it
[1:12:30] whatever it's supposed to be to keep
[1:12:32] everyone excited and coming brothers and
[1:12:34] sisters this isn't supposed to to to
[1:12:36] make us comfortable and excited to come
[1:12:38] this is supposed to correct us to bring
[1:12:40] correction to our lives so that we will
[1:12:43] actually be coming into our positions
[1:12:46] but then when we get in our positions
[1:12:48] Satan cannot stand before
[1:12:52] you but until that time he's going to do
[1:12:54] every sing single thing he can I heard
[1:12:56] somebody say and I thought it was so
[1:12:58] good this was a denominational Minister
[1:13:00] he said that the closer we get to
[1:13:03] Christ the closer we get to Christ the
[1:13:05] more sinful we are going to
[1:13:09] feel the more sinful we are going to
[1:13:12] feel the closer we get to Christ and you
[1:13:15] know I I thought it was so good because
[1:13:17] our feelings have nothing to do with it
[1:13:18] do
[1:13:19] they if we're going on a Feeling then
[1:13:23] brothers and sisters we're over
[1:13:26] it's just about done isn't it but you
[1:13:29] know we don't go by feeling we simply go
[1:13:32] by
[1:13:32] word God said it sounds like a cliche do
[1:13:37] you believe it if you do then that
[1:13:39] settles
[1:13:41] it nobody can take that away from us but
[1:13:44] the closer we get to God the closer we
[1:13:46] get to that headstone the more
[1:13:49] inadequate I believe in this flesh and
[1:13:51] these bodies we're going to feel but the
[1:13:54] more we're going to be able to say Amen
[1:13:57] to that word because that's the only
[1:13:59] thing we're going to have we're going to
[1:14:01] recognize this flesh is nothing this
[1:14:03] flesh can't stand the word of
[1:14:06] God the second son Jesus also a spoken
[1:14:10] seed word of
[1:14:12] God isn't that beautiful he was a spoken
[1:14:15] seed word of God and we know that he was
[1:14:18] a spoken seed word of God in Isaiah we
[1:14:21] know that he was a spoken seed word of
[1:14:23] God In the Garden of Eden we know that
[1:14:26] he was a spoken seed word of God in
[1:14:28] multiple places even right up to Mary
[1:14:31] when Gabriel the Angel messenger for
[1:14:33] that age brought her that word saying
[1:14:36] that you will have a son the second son
[1:14:39] Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was
[1:14:42] given a bride like was Adam but before
[1:14:45] he could marry her she had she also had
[1:14:48] fallen she like Adam's wife was put to
[1:14:51] the test whether she would believe the
[1:14:54] word of God and live or doubt the word
[1:14:57] and
[1:14:59] die and and this makes me real real sad
[1:15:03] this gives me a burden this makes me
[1:15:04] sigh and cry for the Abominations that
[1:15:07] we see in and around the message of the
[1:15:09] hour because there's so many people
[1:15:10] they're just on the edges they're just
[1:15:12] on the
[1:15:14] edges you can see in their lives they're
[1:15:16] not willing to apply the full word of
[1:15:18] the message of the hour it's only just a
[1:15:21] fringe event for them and and it's so
[1:15:24] sad because it's no different than this
[1:15:26] if we doubt the word of God given to us
[1:15:29] in this age by a Vindicated Prophet then
[1:15:32] brothers and sisters it's no different
[1:15:33] than every single other age if we doubt
[1:15:36] that word we will
[1:15:40] die from a little group of the true seed
[1:15:44] of the
[1:15:45] word not of a mongrelization not of a
[1:15:48] tradition not of a Creed or a
[1:15:51] Dogma the true seed of the word
[1:15:55] God isn't this just about made me do uh
[1:15:59] uh I don't know a backflip this just got
[1:16:01] me so excited and I like how brother
[1:16:03] bradam describes just having a shouting
[1:16:05] fit running around a tree just drop all
[1:16:07] your stuff and just start running around
[1:16:09] a tree because you can see it when when
[1:16:11] you can see this I think it just does
[1:16:12] something to a an individual God will
[1:16:15] present Christ with a beloved bride it's
[1:16:18] not us presenting Christ with a beloved
[1:16:22] bride amen God presents Christ with him
[1:16:27] his beloved bride all we do is say Amen
[1:16:31] to the word but God does it
[1:16:36] all if we struggle if we have faults and
[1:16:39] failures if we have things in our lives
[1:16:41] that don't add up and we just can't
[1:16:44] explain they frustrate us brothers and
[1:16:47] sisters don't look at those things look
[1:16:49] at the word of
[1:16:51] God God will present Christ
[1:16:55] with his beloved bride and if you're a
[1:16:58] beloved bride you'll just simply follow
[1:17:01] the word and if you have the ability to
[1:17:02] follow the word doesn't matter what you
[1:17:03] see in your way doesn't matter what you
[1:17:05] feel doesn't matter what you've
[1:17:06] experienced doesn't matter what you're
[1:17:08] going to experience if you have the
[1:17:10] ability to receive the word then you are
[1:17:12] that bride that God is going to present
[1:17:14] to
[1:17:16] Christ I think it's just so beautiful
[1:17:18] God will present Christ with a beloved
[1:17:21] bride she is a virgin of his word
[1:17:26] not a virgin of his flesh not a virgin
[1:17:28] of of the church not a virgin of all of
[1:17:31] our different traditions and teachings
[1:17:33] just simply a virgin of the word just
[1:17:36] able to say be it unto me according to
[1:17:37] Thy word just like Mary I can't explain
[1:17:40] it or understand it but I believe it
[1:17:42] just be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:17:45] that's the
[1:17:46] difference she is a virgin because she
[1:17:50] knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas
[1:17:55] and I I just think sometimes we can
[1:17:57] carry man-made Creeds or dogmas a and we
[1:18:01] can drag them around with us and what
[1:18:04] happens when we do that is we try and
[1:18:06] hybridize what we're doing is we're
[1:18:08] shaking up that oil and that water or
[1:18:10] that oil and that vinegar we're trying
[1:18:12] to mix those two together and they don't
[1:18:14] work brothers and sisters and and my
[1:18:16] passion my true passion is to say that
[1:18:19] if we try and do that what happens is in
[1:18:22] the end we're going to turn people away
[1:18:24] from Christ because it's only going to
[1:18:25] be a matter of time where they're seeing
[1:18:27] us Shake It Up and we've got so much
[1:18:29] excitement and so much energy so on fire
[1:18:31] for Christ but one day they're going to
[1:18:33] see that little vial completely
[1:18:35] separated and they're going to say
[1:18:37] there's something wrong with
[1:18:42] that but when it's all him when it's all
[1:18:47] oil when all the water and all the
[1:18:49] vinegar just evaporates out brothers and
[1:18:51] sisters and it's all oil you can shake
[1:18:54] it you can mix it you can stir it you
[1:18:57] can do whatever you want and it will
[1:18:58] always remain the same won't it there's
[1:19:01] no no accident why the word talks about
[1:19:04] oil the way it did why the prophet came
[1:19:07] and actually showed that blessing to
[1:19:08] that woman with the sick son who who had
[1:19:11] no food no oil had no money in her life
[1:19:14] and the prophet was able to say go and
[1:19:16] get some vessels because I got a
[1:19:18] blessing coming your way God's got a
[1:19:20] blessing for you sister and what was it
[1:19:22] it was oil we know brother brandham says
[1:19:24] the oil and the wine out of the Book of
[1:19:25] Revelation oil represents the holy
[1:19:28] spirit and wine represents the
[1:19:31] stimulation of this
[1:19:34] Revelation my
[1:19:36] goodness from a little group of the true
[1:19:38] seed word of God God will present Christ
[1:19:41] with a beloved bride that's you she is a
[1:19:44] virgin of his word that's you she is a
[1:19:47] virgin because she knows no man man-made
[1:19:50] Creeds or dogmas that's You by and
[1:19:54] through the members of the Bride will be
[1:19:57] fulfilled all that was promised of God
[1:20:00] to be made manifest in the
[1:20:03] virgin that's a heavy statement right
[1:20:07] there but remember God is doing this God
[1:20:11] is going to present Christ with a bride
[1:20:15] it's not going to be man presenting
[1:20:17] Christ The Word of Promise came to the
[1:20:20] Virgin Mary but that Word of Promise was
[1:20:25] he himself to be made manifest my
[1:20:29] goodness God was made
[1:20:34] manifest remember he's the same
[1:20:36] yesterday today and forever there's
[1:20:38] people out there that say that you could
[1:20:39] never be God and you know what we don't
[1:20:42] go and make ourselves God he made us God
[1:20:46] I am said I am
[1:20:49] amen he himself to be made manifest God
[1:20:52] was made manifest he himself acted at
[1:20:56] that time and fulfilled his own Word of
[1:21:00] Promise in the Virgin brothers and
[1:21:04] sisters if you are a virgin to his word
[1:21:08] he will come just like he did there and
[1:21:10] fulfill his Word of Promise not a man's
[1:21:13] Word of Promise his Word of Promise in
[1:21:16] you the
[1:21:18] Virgin it was
[1:21:22] an it was an angel
[1:21:25] that brought her the
[1:21:28] message did you ever think of that it's
[1:21:30] just so beautiful it was an angel
[1:21:31] messenger that brought her the
[1:21:34] message that thing that's going to grow
[1:21:36] inside of you is going to be none other
[1:21:38] than Jesus
[1:21:40] Christ only because the power of the
[1:21:43] highest overshadowed
[1:21:46] you and oh my the power of the highest
[1:21:49] will overshadow you it will overshadow
[1:21:52] each and every one of us if we're
[1:21:53] willing to Just Surrender ourselves to
[1:21:55] him it was an angel that brought her the
[1:21:59] message and that is where she had that
[1:22:01] moment like we talked about a little
[1:22:03] earlier where we could say either this
[1:22:04] is a man talking or this is God talking
[1:22:06] she had that moment in her mind how
[1:22:08] should I answer him how should I
[1:22:10] actually address this fellow that I see
[1:22:13] before me and she said you know just be
[1:22:15] it unto me according to Thy word I I
[1:22:17] can't explain it but hey Amen to the
[1:22:19] word and what happened she got pregnant
[1:22:22] yes right but the Angel's message was
[1:22:27] the word of God it wasn't something else
[1:22:29] and this is where I think it's so
[1:22:31] incredibly Rich if we could just take
[1:22:33] the time to look at the message of the
[1:22:35] hour sometimes I think even as Believers
[1:22:37] of the message of the hour it's good for
[1:22:39] us to go back and just read these words
[1:22:42] just see what it says Isaiah 9:6 he
[1:22:46] fulfilled at that time all that was
[1:22:48] written of him because she accepted his
[1:22:52] word to her
[1:22:55] Isaiah 9
[1:22:57] and6 I thought I had that here yes I do
[1:23:00] for unto us a child is born unto us a
[1:23:02] son is
[1:23:03] given and the government shall be upon
[1:23:06] his
[1:23:07] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[1:23:09] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[1:23:12] Everlasting father the prince of peace
[1:23:14] and we know that that is exactly what
[1:23:16] the wedding ceremony is all about where
[1:23:19] the the bride takes the veil and gives
[1:23:22] it to the groom and the groom takes it
[1:23:24] and puts that Veil upon his shoulder
[1:23:28] what that shows is he's taking sole
[1:23:31] responsibility for every single aspect
[1:23:33] of her life now everything that happens
[1:23:36] in her life he is responsible for if
[1:23:40] she's good if she's bad everything in
[1:23:43] between everything about her now is his
[1:23:46] responsibility and that's the same way
[1:23:48] for us brothers and sisters that's why
[1:23:50] that's in here right here we have God
[1:23:52] speaking this it's still italis words
[1:23:55] Isaiah 9 and6 he fulfilled at that time
[1:23:57] all that was written of him because she
[1:24:00] accepted his word to her if you have
[1:24:04] accepted his word to you then you are
[1:24:09] that
[1:24:10] her and he's accepted all of the
[1:24:14] responsibility thank you Lord the
[1:24:16] members of the Virgin bride will love
[1:24:18] him and they will have his
[1:24:22] potentials we know that because
[1:24:25] if she is actually Spirit born and
[1:24:29] Spirit-filled when she speaks the word
[1:24:33] is not going to be her
[1:24:35] speaking the members of the Virgin bride
[1:24:38] will love him and they will have his
[1:24:40] potentials for he is their head and all
[1:24:44] power belongs to him they are subject to
[1:24:48] him as members of our bodies are subject
[1:24:51] to our heads this is where I think it's
[1:24:54] so important I've been preaching his
[1:24:55] will is his word if we've got his word
[1:24:57] then we have his will it's important for
[1:24:58] us to recognize that we're not just
[1:25:00] going to go and launch out on our own
[1:25:02] and say I'm just going to go and do this
[1:25:03] I'm going to go and do that we're going
[1:25:04] to actually consult with our husband
[1:25:06] before we do it aren't we but we're
[1:25:08] never going to ask for something that's
[1:25:10] a Miss we're never going to ask for
[1:25:11] something that's out of line because we
[1:25:13] know what his word is we know what his
[1:25:15] will is as wives we're never going to
[1:25:17] come to our husbands with really wacky
[1:25:19] ideas that we know our husbands will
[1:25:21] just never go for something that's just
[1:25:23] absolutely a absurd that doesn't fit our
[1:25:26] family we're not going to do that we're
[1:25:28] going to come to our husband with
[1:25:29] something that he's interested in that
[1:25:32] he wants to do something that would be
[1:25:35] an encouragement to him that's what
[1:25:37] we're going to
[1:25:39] do I think it's the same way with our
[1:25:41] heavenly father Amen brother Bram goes
[1:25:46] on to quote the Holy
[1:25:49] Ghost notice the harmony of the father
[1:25:51] and the son Jesus never did anything
[1:25:54] until it was first showed him by the
[1:25:57] Father John
[1:26:00] 519 I I think it's just so
[1:26:03] beautiful isn't it we don't want to do
[1:26:05] anything without being in harmony with
[1:26:08] our husband without being in harmony
[1:26:10] with the Lord we know that when we do
[1:26:12] that many times we can find ourselves in
[1:26:14] what we call the permissive will of God
[1:26:16] we haven't actually taken the time to
[1:26:18] ask the Lord he's allowed things to get
[1:26:20] bumpy for us so that we'll actually just
[1:26:22] step back and correct our ction and then
[1:26:25] go forward brother bradam said just go
[1:26:26] back to where you got off if we ever
[1:26:27] find ourselves in that situation that's
[1:26:29] all we have to do it's a very simple
[1:26:30] thing but usually what happens is that
[1:26:32] thing called pride gets in the way we
[1:26:34] don't want to Humble ourselves we want
[1:26:36] to say oh no no no no everything's good
[1:26:37] it's all going to be fine and it will be
[1:26:39] fine if you're truly a son and daughter
[1:26:41] of God it'll just get a little more
[1:26:42] bumpy until you actually do go back to
[1:26:45] where you got off that's all but notice
[1:26:48] the harmony of the father and the son
[1:26:49] Jesus never did anything until it was
[1:26:51] first showed him by the Father John 5:19
[1:26:54] this harmony is now to exist between the
[1:26:57] groom and his bride I would never say
[1:27:01] just go and do something because you
[1:27:02] have the word of God in you you got it
[1:27:04] in your pocket you can just go and do
[1:27:05] whatever you want to do I would never
[1:27:07] say that I would never ever imply that
[1:27:10] what I would say and imply is that if
[1:27:12] you've taken the time to study the word
[1:27:14] of God and to study the message of the
[1:27:16] hour you know that you want to actually
[1:27:19] have that tight-knit relationship with
[1:27:21] your heavenly
[1:27:22] father and you're never going to go and
[1:27:24] do something a Miss because you always
[1:27:26] want to have that that closeness that
[1:27:29] that relationship you're going to do
[1:27:31] exactly what the word says here this
[1:27:34] harmony is now to exist between the
[1:27:36] groom and his bride she he shows her his
[1:27:40] Word of Life she receives it she never
[1:27:44] doubts
[1:27:45] it but isn't that the way the devil is
[1:27:48] he's the king of doubts oh my that's
[1:27:51] what God's telling me because remember
[1:27:54] he speaks to us I say Lord help me he
[1:27:57] speaks to me and brothers and sisters he
[1:28:00] should speak to you and I want to say
[1:28:03] tonight if he doesn't speak to you if
[1:28:04] you can't say for sure that God speaks
[1:28:06] to you I want to pray that God will make
[1:28:09] himself so known to you that you'll be
[1:28:10] able to say amen God speaks to me too
[1:28:14] because this harmony is supposed to
[1:28:16] exist between him and his bride today
[1:28:19] that's what he said here I'm not just
[1:28:21] making this up he shows her his word of
[1:28:24] of life she receives it she never doubts
[1:28:27] it so doubt your doubts when the Devil
[1:28:30] comes around and says Oh Brother Barry
[1:28:32] he should never be that Pastor there
[1:28:34] doubt your
[1:28:35] doubts right when you have a song leader
[1:28:37] worshiping and you don't like the way he
[1:28:39] worships doubt your
[1:28:41] doubts when you can't see that God is
[1:28:44] moving in your midst in your life and
[1:28:45] you're in the midst of a storm doubt
[1:28:47] your doubts every time you have a doubt
[1:28:49] brothers and sisters it's the devil it's
[1:28:52] not God
[1:28:56] she receives it she never doubts
[1:28:59] it therefore nothing can harm her not
[1:29:03] even death and brothers and sisters when
[1:29:05] we come to that place in our lives and I
[1:29:07] believe every single one of that true
[1:29:09] virgin word born Spirit born spirit
[1:29:14] filled bride virgin bride of Jesus
[1:29:17] Christ when she comes to that position
[1:29:19] in her life of full adoption Authority
[1:29:22] and power recognizing exactly where she
[1:29:25] stands and who she is she will be there
[1:29:28] and not be afraid of death just like the
[1:29:31] Saints in the old old old Dark Ages
[1:29:34] where they said you know what like
[1:29:36] polycarp you don't even have to bind my
[1:29:37] hands just go ahead and light the fire
[1:29:39] just spark it up because I know where
[1:29:42] I'm going and I know who's in control
[1:29:43] and you can't kill me I I I can only go
[1:29:46] when he says it's time to go but if we
[1:29:49] can come to that place where we're not
[1:29:50] fearing death understanding that nothing
[1:29:53] can harm us us Satan will be powerless
[1:29:56] before
[1:29:58] you because you know how it is when you
[1:30:00] got a
[1:30:01] bully if a bully can come around and
[1:30:04] bully you and make you scared that bully
[1:30:07] is going to come around and bully you
[1:30:08] and try and make you scared he's going
[1:30:10] to try and eat your lunch he's going to
[1:30:12] try and take your lunch money he's going
[1:30:13] to try and do whatever he can over and
[1:30:15] over again to try and make you scared
[1:30:17] but when you square up your shoulders
[1:30:19] and you say nope I'm not doing this
[1:30:21] anymore I'm a son or a daughter of the
[1:30:23] most high God and I know where I stand I
[1:30:25] don't have any strength on my own but
[1:30:27] you know what when he comes to town he's
[1:30:29] got all Heaven behind him and you know
[1:30:31] what one word from him and actually that
[1:30:34] will change everything with you when we
[1:30:36] can come to that place brothers and
[1:30:38] sisters there's nothing the devil can do
[1:30:40] to
[1:30:41] us I just think it's so beautiful so
[1:30:44] beautiful so incredibly beautiful
[1:30:48] my she receives it she never doubts it
[1:30:51] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:30:53] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:30:56] water will raise it up
[1:30:58] again and you know what some people they
[1:31:02] have to be planted that's the way it is
[1:31:05] that's the law of reproduction that's
[1:31:07] that's God's chosen way and it's not
[1:31:11] easy it's not easy for a moment but if
[1:31:14] that seed be planted the water will
[1:31:16] raise it up again and I think it's
[1:31:18] beautiful because it's the washing of
[1:31:20] the Water by the word that word will
[1:31:23] raise it up up again there's coming a
[1:31:25] day I was just thinking about it today
[1:31:27] when I was listening when I was
[1:31:28] meditating trying to just get get
[1:31:31] focused on this brothers and sisters I
[1:31:33] was just thinking there's coming a day
[1:31:35] where that General Resurrection is going
[1:31:36] to happen and and that General
[1:31:38] Resurrection I personally believe this
[1:31:40] as well is going to happen through the
[1:31:42] voice of the
[1:31:44] Bride she's going to recognize her
[1:31:46] position and when she does she's going
[1:31:48] to say come forth and you know what's
[1:31:51] going to happen all the graves are going
[1:31:53] to turn loose
[1:31:54] everything is going to change she is
[1:31:57] going to do it and he's going to do it
[1:31:59] through her it's not going to be her
[1:32:01] choosing now it's time to do it we're
[1:32:04] we're probably running out of time we
[1:32:05] won't be able to get into it but if you
[1:32:06] want to study up for the next time we
[1:32:07] talk about it you know there was a time
[1:32:09] in Joshua's day where they said Joshua
[1:32:11] you must have lost your commission
[1:32:12] because everything is kind of stalled
[1:32:13] and you're not really doing anything
[1:32:15] extraordinary now we need to go and get
[1:32:17] our land we need to go and actually
[1:32:19] conquer the land maybe God's done with
[1:32:21] you we know that Joshua he waited for
[1:32:23] the land the the timing of God he waited
[1:32:25] for the instruction of the Lord he
[1:32:27] didn't just go forwards boldly trying to
[1:32:29] do things on his
[1:32:31] own this harmony is now to exist between
[1:32:34] the groom and his bride he shows her his
[1:32:36] Word of Life she receives it and never
[1:32:38] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[1:32:40] not even death for if the seed be
[1:32:42] planted the water will raise it up
[1:32:44] again here is the secret of
[1:32:48] this the word is in the
[1:32:51] bride as it was in Mary
[1:32:55] I I just think this is so fantastic
[1:32:57] brothers and sisters I I for me this is
[1:33:00] probably one of my all-time favorite
[1:33:02] positions in the message of the hour
[1:33:04] here is the secret of this the Holy
[1:33:06] Spirit comes down and ministers to his
[1:33:09] prophet and says pick up your pen
[1:33:11] whatever you're doing I want you to pick
[1:33:12] up your pen I've got a message for the
[1:33:14] Believers in the coming days and I want
[1:33:16] them to know this I want them to hear
[1:33:18] this I want them to read these words and
[1:33:20] actually understand this I want them to
[1:33:23] comprehend what my mind is for
[1:33:28] them the secret is this the word is in
[1:33:32] the bride as it was in Mary the bride
[1:33:35] has the mind of Christ for she knows
[1:33:39] what he wants done with the
[1:33:42] word just like a husband and a wife when
[1:33:45] you see a really mature
[1:33:47] relationship Believers together the wife
[1:33:51] does what the husband wants and doesn't
[1:33:54] argue doesn't fuss doesn't stew there's
[1:33:57] no real issues she knows what the
[1:34:00] husband wants done with his
[1:34:03] word now this really got me here she
[1:34:06] performs the command of the word in his
[1:34:10] name for she has thus sayeth the
[1:34:13] Lord then the word is quickened by the
[1:34:16] spirit and it comes to pass like a seed
[1:34:20] that is planted and watered it comes to
[1:34:21] full Harvest serving its purpose
[1:34:25] I think this is so
[1:34:27] beautiful for a long time I thought that
[1:34:30] she has the mind of Christ and and she
[1:34:32] is just able to speak the word what's
[1:34:34] the third poll isn't it after all it's
[1:34:36] the third poll we should be able to
[1:34:37] speak the word I I want to speak the
[1:34:39] word for this need and it should just
[1:34:41] come to pass right because we have the
[1:34:43] third poll and what happens when it
[1:34:44] doesn't come to pass brothers and
[1:34:45] sisters then we have a a disappointing
[1:34:48] time and we say well maybe that word
[1:34:50] just isn't with me maybe I'm just not
[1:34:51] that bright maybe maybe maybe what
[1:34:53] happens is the floodgates of doubts
[1:34:55] start to roll into the life of the
[1:34:57] believer but don't listen to those
[1:35:00] doubts don't look at it that way what I
[1:35:02] believe the Lord showed me is something
[1:35:04] really important here she performs what
[1:35:07] not the command of her word she performs
[1:35:09] the command of the
[1:35:12] word that's what she does she performs
[1:35:15] the command of the
[1:35:19] word the word is his will she commands
[1:35:24] the word she does she performs the
[1:35:28] command of the word I just had this jump
[1:35:30] off the page at me the command of the
[1:35:32] word not the command of the
[1:35:35] Bride many times I think we could do it
[1:35:37] though I'm guilty I want to say I've got
[1:35:40] the mind of Christ in me I've got thus
[1:35:43] sayeth the
[1:35:44] Lord we got to be careful because we can
[1:35:47] start waving our own little wand
[1:35:49] thinking that we're going to try and
[1:35:50] make it happen that's not way the way
[1:35:53] God wants it to to happen that's not the
[1:35:54] way he's saying it in the word here she
[1:35:56] performs the command of the word in his
[1:36:00] name for she has thus sayeth the Lord
[1:36:02] not everyone can do this brothers and
[1:36:04] sisters not everyone can perform the
[1:36:06] command of the word clearly otherwise
[1:36:09] this building would be full otherwise
[1:36:11] all of the message churches all around
[1:36:13] the world would be full otherwise
[1:36:14] everyone who is a Christian around the
[1:36:16] world would believe the message of the
[1:36:19] hour not everyone can perform the
[1:36:23] command of the
[1:36:25] word but those who can Will those who
[1:36:29] can will say Amen to the word because
[1:36:32] they're a virgin not to their own
[1:36:33] thinking they're a virgin to his word
[1:36:35] they're not letting any man-made Creeds
[1:36:37] or any dogmas or any Traditions capture
[1:36:40] them and drag them down what they're
[1:36:42] willing to do is shake them all off and
[1:36:44] say just be it unto me according to Thy
[1:36:46] word maybe I don't understand it maybe
[1:36:49] this is all new to me and I I've never
[1:36:51] heard it this way or maybe I've heard it
[1:36:52] this way but I've just never been able
[1:36:54] to receive it I don't know but just like
[1:36:57] Mary said just be it unto me according
[1:36:59] to Thy word and what happened she
[1:37:01] actually got pregnated and brothers and
[1:37:02] sisters the only way we're getting out
[1:37:04] of here is to have an impregnation by
[1:37:06] the spirit in our lives we have to have
[1:37:09] that without that we are just church
[1:37:13] members boy oh boy she performs the
[1:37:17] command of the word in his name for she
[1:37:19] has thus sayith the Lord then the word
[1:37:21] is quickened by the spirit and it comes
[1:37:24] to
[1:37:25] pass like a seed that is planted and
[1:37:28] watered it comes to full Harvest serving
[1:37:30] its purpose many times in our lives
[1:37:32] we'll have prayers brothers and sisters
[1:37:34] we're going to have a a a service coming
[1:37:36] up and and we're going to start going
[1:37:38] through very specific prayer
[1:37:40] requests because I think it's so easy to
[1:37:43] forget we have a prayer request we pray
[1:37:46] and then we plant that seed and and you
[1:37:48] know what it gets watered and sometimes
[1:37:51] we forget about those requests but they
[1:37:53] get answered and you know what they
[1:37:55] always get answered God never ever
[1:37:59] doesn't answer a request it's either the
[1:38:02] way we want it to or not the way we want
[1:38:05] it to but he always answers but the
[1:38:07] thing I think is so good I I don't know
[1:38:09] if anybody ever saw it one time there
[1:38:11] was a a video that was put out I don't
[1:38:12] know who put it out exactly but there
[1:38:14] was a video that was put out of of this
[1:38:16] very thought where there's someone that
[1:38:18] can go and plant a seed a farmer can
[1:38:20] plant a seed and when you plant the seed
[1:38:23] you need to know how many days it takes
[1:38:26] for that seed to germinate it's
[1:38:28] important to know that so that you can
[1:38:30] have a realistic
[1:38:32] expectation but sometimes you'll have a
[1:38:35] seed and you won't know how many days it
[1:38:37] is until that seed germinates and and
[1:38:40] you plant that seed in the ground and
[1:38:42] you water that seed and you you give it
[1:38:45] sunshine you give it warmth and you
[1:38:47] water that seed and you give it sunshine
[1:38:49] you give it warmth and you continually
[1:38:50] go through that cycle and hope that that
[1:38:52] seed will start to germinate and if you
[1:38:54] don't see it germinate in the time frame
[1:38:56] you think about sometimes what we do is
[1:38:59] be be desirous to go and dig up that
[1:39:02] seed and see is it living is there life
[1:39:05] there but if we do that we kill that
[1:39:09] seed we need to leave that
[1:39:11] seed we need to plant that seed and we
[1:39:14] need to trust by faith that that seed is
[1:39:18] actually going to
[1:39:20] grow and you know what it will we just
[1:39:23] have to have patience we just have to
[1:39:25] remember that even a seed is such a
[1:39:27] perfect example because the seed is
[1:39:30] created to be in God's timeline isn't
[1:39:33] it I don't know maybe there's smarter
[1:39:36] people here but I don't think you could
[1:39:37] actually maybe you could create
[1:39:39] genetically a seed that would germinate
[1:39:42] faster but it's still got to go through
[1:39:44] the process of being planted rotting
[1:39:46] dying out and then actually resurrecting
[1:39:49] again it all has to happen according to
[1:39:51] God's law
[1:39:54] but sometimes when the seed is
[1:39:58] planted and
[1:40:01] watered it comes to full Harvest but
[1:40:03] it's not actually in the time frame in
[1:40:05] which we think it should we need to be
[1:40:07] patient and give God the opportunity to
[1:40:10] bring it to manifest brothers and
[1:40:12] sisters it will come to full Harvest
[1:40:15] serving its purpose according to what
[1:40:16] the word says here tonight I'll call the
[1:40:18] musicians I I'm I I I want to continue
[1:40:21] on with this I'll pick it up we'll come
[1:40:23] come back to the very beginning of this
[1:40:25] I think maybe not the very beginning but
[1:40:27] uh maybe a couple paragraphs back when
[1:40:30] we get back together again I think this
[1:40:31] is just so good it's so important I I
[1:40:34] don't think we could ever ever ever o
[1:40:36] overestimate the importance of this
[1:40:38] portion of the word because it has to do
[1:40:41] with us the
[1:40:42] bride those in the bride do only his
[1:40:46] will no one can make them do otherwise
[1:40:49] isn't that
[1:40:50] beautiful they have thus sayith the Lord
[1:40:52] or they keep still they know that it has
[1:40:55] to be God in them doing the works
[1:40:57] fulfilling his own
[1:41:00] word we can't fulfill his word we can't
[1:41:03] grow and dig up that seed and and pour
[1:41:05] more water on it and give it more heat
[1:41:07] and maybe more light and make that seed
[1:41:09] do anything more than it's supposed to
[1:41:10] do according to the law of God it's
[1:41:13] going to do what it's going to do in his
[1:41:16] time but I just love how he says this
[1:41:19] here he did not complete all his Works
[1:41:22] while in his Earth
[1:41:24] Ministry so now he works in and through
[1:41:27] the bride she knows that for it was not
[1:41:32] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:41:34] that he must now
[1:41:36] do but he will now fulfill through the
[1:41:39] bride that work what she left for this
[1:41:44] specific time brothers and sisters this
[1:41:46] is just so rich maybe stand with me as
[1:41:49] we close tonight am
[1:41:53] just remember brothers and sisters if I
[1:41:55] could just impress upon us one thing she
[1:41:57] performs the command of the word not the
[1:42:02] command of her word the command of the
[1:42:04] word his word we need to know where we
[1:42:06] stand and we need to make sure that
[1:42:08] we're speaking his word when we do that
[1:42:11] all Heaven is there to back us up and we
[1:42:13] just need to allow our praise to water
[1:42:17] that seed that gets planted through a
[1:42:19] prayer and when we do that God will come
[1:42:22] around and he will bring it to a full
[1:42:24] Harvest God richly bless you tonight
[1:42:26] let's just bow in prayer gracious
