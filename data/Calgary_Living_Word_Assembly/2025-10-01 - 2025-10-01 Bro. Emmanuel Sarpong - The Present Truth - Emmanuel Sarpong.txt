Um, yes, we have a couple of prayer requests here. Um there's a prayer request for sister Ne. Um she's not feeling well, low energy, difficulty breathing. Let's see the Lord's intervention for her. And then there is another prayer request from sister Judith, brother Steven for traveling mercies going to Arizona. so that the Lord will lead them and bring them home safely. &gt;&gt; Now, if you have a request, please let's make it known with an uplifted hand as we go before him. &gt;&gt; Our dear Lord and King, you mean everything to us. &gt;&gt; Father, every time we come before you, we know we in the presence of the king &gt;&gt; and we know, Father, that all our worries &gt;&gt; are gone. And that is our faith. That is what we believe. &gt;&gt; And that is why, Father, we keep coming for more testimonies. Lord, we are gathered here this evening, Father, to worship you. We are gathered to praise you. We are gathered to enjoy that privilege that is uniquely ours. We have gathered to use that name that is given exclusively to humanity. Father, we pray, oh Lord, that you not leave us, that you not forsake us, oh Lord. Father that you be pleased with our gathering oh Lord and Father that you will come among us oh Lord that you share of yourself of your very life with your children oh Lord that you have permanence in every aspect of your service oh Lord oh precious Lord we pray that you bless the way that is going forth oh Lord that you bless the people that are guided here listening oh Lord that you bless the vessel that you've chosen to use oh Lord that you take preminence over everything oh Lord &gt;&gt; oh Lord have your way. Father, &gt;&gt; Father, I remember our sister Dave who is at home. Father, we pray that your presence will be with her, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; that you confirm to her again that you are that prayer answering God, that you are that healer, that you are that one true and living God who has visited his children once more in the same time. Oh Lord, touch her, oh Lord, and give her a testimony, Father. We pray merciful father that you be with us sister Judith that you be with our brother Steven as they travel father let your presence go with them may you prosper their way oh lord and let them return with a testimony oh lord praising your name father we pray father that all the hands that are lifted up father you know the needs that are behind those arms father &gt;&gt; lord may you answer it oh lord that it will be made manifest that Every time we come before you, we receive an answer. Oh Lord, make us sensitive to your direction, oh Lord, that we'll know what you're doing this evening. Father, even as your word goes forth, we pray that you'll bless it all to the hearts of your children, oh Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; help me, Lord. Don't let my weakness limit you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't let my shortfall limit you, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All that matters here is that we do what is your purpose and what pleases you. And so I surrender, oh Lord, to your call. Have your way for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whilst you're standing, we'll turn to first Peter. Sorry to have kept you standing for a little bit. Going to read from first Peter chapter 1. Sorry. Sorry. Forgive me. Let's turn to second Peter chapter one. Second Peter chapter 1 and um I'll be reading from verse 10. Second Peter chapter 1:10. Wherefore the rather brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. For if ye do these things, ye shall never fail. &gt;&gt; For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. Yay. I think it meets as long as I am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me. Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able after my disease to have these things always in remembrance. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we're eyewitnesses of his majesty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think I'll stop here. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his word. You may be seated. So um this evening will be a bit of uh I'm not sure how to call it but just going over a few um quotes some of which I've shared here right here before but I I witnessed an event within this p these past two years in sorry these past two weeks in an environment that to me uh I've always known to be like it is it's an environment where people actually uh believe this message of the hour and the more I watched these events the more I I got convinced that if for any reason at all we sideline this message If we replace it a little bit with the thoughts of that inspiring ministry, that that great preacher, that wonderful brother, the revelations of this group and that person, everything will come down to just a lodge. We will just be a group of people gathering together to feel good about ourselves. &gt;&gt; Maybe help one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; The moment this message loses its position, &gt;&gt; in the hearts of the believer first, but in the midst of the congregation too, &gt;&gt; that is it. &gt;&gt; Yes, we can say still make the claim we are message believers. Yes, we are the bride. Yes, we are going to the rapture. We can say all of that. After all, we're in Laia, right? This is where we make the claims. This I sit as a queen and I'm no widow and have need of nothing when we actually blind, miserable, wretched, naked and not even know it. And so this is a time of claim. &gt;&gt; Let's be watchful. Let's ignore the claim and cling to the substance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so um for those of you who have been around for a while, this may be like preaching to the choir. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I I really felt pressed that this is what I have to do. So I'm going to share a few quotes, quite a few. And I want to title it the present truth. The present truth. Now the scripture we read speaks about it says give diligence to make your calling and election sh. So it doesn't just say make your calling and lection sh it says give diligence meaning pay attention be careful be serious stay focused hallelujah &gt;&gt; and we will see why that is important but in doing so he says we shall never fall it means if we are not careful if we are not focused if we don't give attention we shall fall. &gt;&gt; So let's take it this way. But then if we are if we are very careful then he continues to says an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now of course we all know that the kingdom of the Lord is the Holy Spirit. But then when he says it shall have an everlasting kingdom that that means not just an influence of the Holy Spirit not just an indwelling but a sealing. It means that it is done for good. That is the only way it can be everlasting. Now you know Barraham says you can be filled with the Holy Ghost every day of your life and still end up in hell because the anointing is on the flesh. Right? But now for it here is saying that when you are seeking to make your uh calling and election sure an entrance shall be ministered unto you so that we can have this everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Then he says I will not be negligent. Now look at it this way that the man is saying that even failing to tell you is negligence. &gt;&gt; Failing to tell. Now it's not as if he's bringing a new information. It's not as if he's bringing a new message, something unheard of. No, it's the same old thing. If you watch it says it's something that they are established in it. It says you know it and you are established in it and still coming to remind you if he fails to do it he's been negligent. I want to believe that that's what I'm going to do this evening that you don't feel that I'm I'm bringing those same things but the thought is important and and for us to understand why if for the whole of this this uh second epistle of Peter was actually written and he uses the word to stir up our me uh faith by way of remembrance. Why? because he says there will be some gone out scoffers who will come among us. So he the idea is that he says he wants us to remember the things that the prophets have told us and then remember the things that the apostles have told us. So it's very important. That's why it says give diligence. But the way to do it is to be reminding yourself constantly about these things. And to remember what he's telling them, they established in it and to know it. He said, I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle. Imagine a man who has been shown by the Lord Jesus Christ that he's going to die very soon. Do you have that linker here? No, I don't think that's it. A man who has been shown by the Lord Jesus Christ that he's going to pass away very soon. And then he's talking to his loved ones. He's addressing the people that he loves. That's it. Okay, thank you. He's addressing the people that he loves. Now, in our normal lives, you know, when somebody is going to pass away, you are thinking of, you know, the the the title to that property, maybe the house, maybe the car, maybe the bank account, something precious, something important. Now, this man Peter is about to pass away. And the most important and the treasure that he wants to pass along is to remind them constantly. &gt;&gt; So just know that he understands the times in which they were living and he knows the importance of what they have heard. And yes, they've heard it to the extent that they established in it. But they could slip away easily. They could listen even the word of God the word of God that created heaven and earth it could be established in you and by men's tradition you can make it of non effect and so don't underestimate the need to focus on the word of God day in and day out constantly reading constantly meditating because that's what makes us who we are that is our identity that is our Paul that is our purpose in life. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And so Peter is about to pass away and his purpose is to con start reminding them and then continue reminding them. And then he says that even after my disease, he says in 15 says, "Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able after my disease to have these things always in remembrance." That is why we have it written now. So that we will have it always in remembrance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine how vital this is? Praise the name of the Lord. And then it comes to that part that I love. Uh I I was watching some something about it and said we have not followed cunningly devised fables. &gt;&gt; So we have not followed the story of some smart guy. &gt;&gt; No, not some eloquent guy told the stories and we believed it. No. &gt;&gt; No. But we were eyewitnesses. &gt;&gt; This is the powerful part of it. Eyewitnesses. &gt;&gt; They have the testimony. And that is the most important thing and the most difficult thing for people who oppose the the gospel because when they come they have to be able to disprove the resurrection. But as far as normal human life now you can talk of logic, psychology, whatever. But for the normal human life, it's impossible to disprove the the the resurrection because the records are not just in Bible. They're in secular literature, secular history. But above that, the people claiming to be witnesses and this is what I what got me. I never heard of that before. That the people followed the Lord Jesus Christ. If there is a gain in whatever they are doing, they could tell a lie. But now when the Lord Jesus Christ has been crucified, actually treated like a criminal and killed and gone, who are they seeking to please when they continue to hold on that they are eyewitnesses of the resurrection? &gt;&gt; But it goes on more. When they catch you, not so like the apostles, but even some of the disciples, they catch you, they're going to kill you. If what you believe is a lie and they said recant and we'll spare your life. Won't you recant? Who will say I'm defending the lie with my life? How does that happen? What is the gain? So in the normal course of human life, the proof of the resurrection can never be denied. &gt;&gt; Brother, we can say just like Peter, we have not believed cunningly devised fables. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I want us to go on and look at this present truth. What is the present truth? Now um we know the Bible is there the word of God and is a God's word of truth. Right? Now, all right. In the second coming, brother Ram says, "The Bible is God's infallible, eternal, everpresent word." And frankly, it's God himself in there living in word form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so we start by understanding that the Bible is the very basis of every truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now the truth that we are talking of in this h this evening you will accept and understand that it's not the opposite of lies. &gt;&gt; The truth that we are talking of is not an ideology. &gt;&gt; It's not some doctrine or philosophy. &gt;&gt; No. Because none of these can minister, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; An entrance into the everlasting kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Theories have come, theories have gone, they have been good, they have been bad, they've met situations fine, but none ministers an entrance into the everlasting kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ. And so, where do I go from here? The truth is a man. The truth is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the only person who stood and said, "I'm the way, the truth, and the life." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's no one beside him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now the question is, if that is so, why the present truth? Why is there a present truth and a past truth and a future truth? Shouldn't truth be objective? Shouldn't truth be once and the same? &gt;&gt; And that is true. &gt;&gt; So in a sense that it's worth asking why the present truth and the reason is that the truth is once it's just one is the man the Lord the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. But you see, where we find oursself in history is what determines what we see of the present truth. &gt;&gt; Where we find ourselves in history determines how it is revealed to us. &gt;&gt; Like as I was I'm standing here right now, you see a very different part of the pulpit from what I see. And I'm glad you see this way. You don't see me shaking or any wobbly, right? So it helps. Now if I should stand here there's a part of the public that I see and it will be different from if I'm standing this way and it will be different from if I'm standing this way and this is what I'm saying that depending on where you're standing in history that determines what you see of the truth &gt;&gt; but it's the same Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was a time, there was a season when God's wrath was coming on earth. A man received the word of God. It now for those who say, "Oh yeah, and how come you think you alone have the truth?" Noah alone had the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Noah alone had the truth. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. And so he received the truth. He believed the truth. But because it was the truth of the hour, it quickened him into action. &gt;&gt; Now he received the word, believe it and the action was the product of the word. What is it? The word made flesh. &gt;&gt; So the act was Jesus Christ again in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What happened? You get in, not a drop of the flood will touch you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is how it was and that is how it has always been. Another instant, the wrath of God is coming. People he listen to their prophet and they slaughter a lamp. What was it? The Lord Jesus Christ again. And then they put the the the blood on the lent. And so once they are under it, it doesn't matter whether they kill somebody yesterday. They are safe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It doesn't matter. Oh, you are not from this family. It doesn't matter. I am in the blood. &gt;&gt; I am under the talking. Praise the name of the living God. And so all every time, every season, everywhere, God has manifested himself in a way. And when people hear it and they believe it and they live it, it produces Jesus Christ again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so this is where I want us to start talking about this. Now referring to the Bible in the message Joseph meeting his brothers, brother Ram says that it is given to the human race and for all times and for all ages because it is a written word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's for all times and for all ages. That is the Bible. &gt;&gt; But now not all of the Bible is the word for today. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. I have a daughter. I can shut her in the room and repeat thousand to thousand times to her. A virgin shall conceive. A virgin shall conceive a thousand times every day. For the rest of her life, she's not going to conceive. &gt;&gt; But it's still the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Understand it. It has already been lived. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; And so all of the Bible is all of the word of God for all the time, but not all of the Bible is the word of God for today. And so the allotted word for your day &gt;&gt; when it is quickened to you &gt;&gt; and you live it that is the present truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so this is what we are stepping we are setting off to to to um talk about that. Oh you can take Noah's word you can go and build an ark for Moses. It'll be the word of God but it won't save the people. Praise the name of the Lord because that was not the word for that time. &gt;&gt; That was not the word for that season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, Brother Abraham tells us in convinced and then concerned 196 says, I'm convinced in the ministry and the message I'm preaching. I'm convinced that it's the truth. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced that these visions come from God. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced we are living in the last days. I'm convinced that in this I'm convinced that this very spirit that is on me now is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Glory. I'm thoroughly convinced. I'm convinced that the Holy Ghost way is right. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced that the Bible is the truth. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; And so that is it. The Bible is the truth. And then he says the message is the truth. &gt;&gt; Where is the link? one explains the other. One is a part of the Bible that is quickened for us today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I understand that we live in a time, we live in a season where this word of God, this revealed word of the Lord, especially sent to this special woman, this bride has been attacked, continuously attacked, has been misrepresented. the the the the the messenger has been attacked and it's gone on so much so if the Lord does not prove it to you, if he does not reveal it to you and I personally in our hearts, &gt;&gt; we we will also walk away &gt;&gt; the same way many people have walked away. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; But you see, Abraham tells us that God interprets his own word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not subject to another eloquent man's interpretation. No, God fulfills and confirms his word in the heart of his children. Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; And so this is it. Some will say, "Well, I don't need to go. I I'll just stay, but you know, I can read. I have the Holy Spirit. So maybe I can look and see which one." So then they start picking and choosing. And when they meet you and you say you believe all the word, you believe everything the prophet preached, then they start labeling you. Maybe you are blind, maybe you are cult. Maybe you follow a man. Last time I checked, every single time that God manifested himself in the life of a man, that man had the following. &gt;&gt; People followed Noah into the ark. &gt;&gt; People followed Moses out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; People followed Joshua into the promised land. And we can keep going, right? When God calls a people, Jesus when he was on earth, he had followers. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist had followers. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. And so then they start calling you names. And what they're doing is trying to waken and discourage people from believing the present truth. And why do I say that? Because it's the only answer to all what the devil is doing in this end time. not just an answer, it's the only answer. Praise the name of the Lord. And then my favorite one is, oh well, you can, it doesn't matter as long as the person is preaching the Bible, right? As long as he's preaching the Bible, there is more to it than just preaching the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People have preached the Bible. with good intentions. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But they have ended up in denominations. &gt;&gt; We have so I don't know no hundreds or thousands of denominations precisely because people with good intentions ignored God's provided explanation. They ignore God's provided way for their age and went on their own. And what we have are all these denominations. So somebody comes and says, "No, you have to say Hail Mary." The other one says, "No, you have to worship on the Sabbath." This one says, "No, you don't have to beat any drum in the church." I can keep going on, but you know them. Hallelujah. And so it's something very important that look if somebody writes a poem I believe that he understands it better than all the people on earth. And if somebody writes this book and brings it to us I believe he can explain it better than anybody else. &gt;&gt; And so when he brings you the explanation you thank the Lord and continue in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. So when you say, "Oh yeah, as long as they're preaching the Bible," it sounds pious. It sounds even serious. But you just have to understand that there are distinction. There are differences in people and there are differences in the messages that come. Hallelujah. So there's a there has to be a difference between one who believes the message because he has heard from a man like right now yeah there are all of us are here we are talking but when we finish I'm going home with one person only one lady and nobody else no matter how nice I speak to any sister here that is fine it's for here it's done but what is between myself and that lady is it stands out it's And God is doing the same right now. He has chosen a lady and he has come to her and spoken to her just like he sent Eleaza to uh Rebecca. Ela spoke to Rebecca directly. The the other attendants did not hear what was said. Yes, they followed through. Glory to God. They were blessed. And they were way more than Rebecca. Rebecca was just one person. But still the word of God had gone forth to Rebecca. So Rebecca was walking as a possessor of a promise. The others were going but they didn't have that promise. But Rebecca did. What if Rebecca had triv trivialized that? Oh yeah, it's just something you told me. That's it. So let's understand it. It's important that we know and understand what we have received. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you will realize that when the word was made fleshed here on earth in its fullness, it did not stop the Pharisees from going to the Lord with the written word. The Bible says this. The Bible says that why do you do this? Why do your disciples do that? It did not s stop the Sadducees from going to do that. But the difference was that they had the written word &gt;&gt; but the Lord Jesus Christ was the revealed word made flesh &gt;&gt; and so they were no match for him. &gt;&gt; Where is the revealed word today? Where is the word made flesh today? When the scripture says as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Lord when it says in the name in the in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound. Who is he sing to when he says they that for they that fear my name the son of righteousness shall rise? Who are these people who fear his name? When he says I will send you Elijah the prophet. Who is you? Where is the revealed word today? Is it not in you and I? &gt;&gt; Now will that stop the devil from coming to you with the written word? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. And how do we stand against it? How do we answer unless we are immersed in the revealed word? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so this is where I'm going with this. Praise the name of the Lord. in God identified by his characteristics. Brother Abraham says, "Now watch, now watch that 12 year old boy being the word for that hour. He was the promised word for the hour, the anointed Messiah." Now when you reach such places, people begin to shake and think, where are you going with this? Hallelujah. If the promised word for that hour was the anointed Messiah, what will the promised word for this hour be? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And yet the devil went to him. The devil tempted him and his people also tempted him. Now this is what I'm saying that for us to stand &gt;&gt; because we have a position. Oh, we believe the Bible. Yes. But for us to stand firm, we need to be in the revealed word and we need to be firmly immersed. Praise the name of the Lord. Otherwise, how do we stand? We do. So, we have to get to the point where we say, "No matter what, this is our life. No matter what, this is our choice." We have to get a point like Peter said, "To whom shall we go to? You alone have the words of eternal life. You alone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not you and other people. Not yours is eternal life, but ours is also good. No, you alone. &gt;&gt; That is where we have to get to. Hallelujah. And until we get there, the devil can come to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's not going to announce, "Hey, look at me. I'm the devil." No. He's coming to you more sounding and seeming more spiritual than you and I are. and he's coming with the scripture. Now, where what will be your stand? Praise the name of the Lord. Now, um I the times past when I I share these um quotes, I spoke of um a a very interesting uh experiment that uh Jacob Dor did. Now, this Jacob Defor is an actor, but he's also a movie producer, and he's looking to um he's looking to sort of advertise his work. And so, he finds a Christian uh platform online and he sees thousands of Christians and people are writing, "Hallelujah. Glory to God. Praise God. He's a living. God is true. God is good." all the time and he's excited and this is going on and he's thinking is this all true? Okay, let's see what happens. And so he writes Luke 4:7. If you believe say amen and then he starts getting amen, glory to God, praise God, hallelujah, God is good. And on and on. He see somebody whose name is pastor something. He also responds and he says, "Are you a pastor?" The guy says, "Yes." He says, "Do you realize who he's talking?" Say, "Yes, our Lord Jesus Christ." I don't think I have it here. Luke 4:7. Yes. If thou therefore will worship me, all shall be dying. That is the devil speaking. And this is where I'm coming in that the man quoted the Bible, but he was quoting the devil. Is it enough to say, "Oh, yeah. As long as you're preaching the Bible," the people said amen to the Bible, but they were saying amen to the words of the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, he said 96% of the people said amen to it. He said only 3% realized, "No, this is the devil. And so what am I saying? That the word for us that is brought to us, if we really know what it means, if we really know how much we need it, if we really understand how much we should depend on it, we will be devouring it left and right, &gt;&gt; we will be we wouldn't be waiting for somebody to tell us about it. Especially if you're a parent and you're a father, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper of your house. If you're a pastor, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper of the congregation. But every single one of us, if we really know what it means, we won't wait for somebody to tell us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Is it enough that we're preaching the Bible? Some of the greatest opposition brother Abraham received on earth were from ministers &gt;&gt; and church leaders. &gt;&gt; Some of us a picture some of us have a picture of brother Abraham with a halo over his head. How did that come by? A very well-arned minister Dr. best stood against him. That is how the Lord permitted that picture to be taken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So is it enough that we are quoting the Bible? So we are right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now there was a time when a man received the word Paul. He was Saul. He graduated from a prestigious college and the gamal. But when he got the written word without the revealed word, what did that do to him? He persecuted the Christians. He persecuted the very Lord he thought he was worshiping. He persecuted the one he thought he was serving. He was an important man. Does that matter? No. But when he got the revealed word, then things began to change. &gt;&gt; Then the people he was persecuting, he turned around and followed them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay. In the message when their eyes were opened, they knew him. Brother Brian says that they failed to know him by the written word. Think of that. He was talking about Jesus when he come and revealed himself by the word to them and they still failed to see it. If that ain't a picture of today, I don't know what is still failing when the scriptures say these things. Now, I'm going to go a little quick. I'm going to skip Abraham calls a few scriptures here and it continues and still many that love him don't see it. They still grope on into darkness. Still they fail to know him by the written word. Brothers and sisters, no revelation should contradict the Bible. &gt;&gt; But the life of the word is in the scripture quickened for this hour. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Rab says the Bible is Christ. The Bible is the written word which he is the word. Its manifestation is the evidence of the life coming into the flesh of the word to manifest it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we are in a world today where even unbelievers will be happy to have some some sort of a shelter, a break with all the political turmoil and the tensions and the wars. Now people don't even talk about natural diseases and they're happening everywhere. Things are going bad over and over and over again. And there is just one escape route and that has been provided to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People see the papacy, oh maybe as the leaders of of Christianity and what they're doing is embracing evil, embracing abomination. &gt;&gt; Why the Bible calls abomination. God has only one answer and that's just for you and I. He says he's giving us himself. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that is the present truth. The word quickened for today. So that is more than a written word. Hallelujah. Now in the spoken word is the original seed. Brother says I believe the Bible is the word the whole truth and Jesus is the word made manifest. He and his word is one and the same. Hallelujah. Now what I say is have you received God's answer to this all the problems going on and if you have what are you doing with it praise the name of the Lord in revelation of Jesus uh in God's only provided place of worship says what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God I'm trying to hurry up quickly Okay. And so the simple thing is this. &gt;&gt; Without the revelation of the word, we can never face the challenges of today. Oh yeah, we may face it and we may come out in a way that the world approves of it. But going scripturally, there's just one way and that is what has been provided for us. Hallelujah. Yeah, we may be inspired and quote scriptures and that happens a lot in the Bible. We may have zeal like Paul had zeal but that zeal led him to persecute Christians. You know in the time of um Micaiah the the most outstanding story of Micaiah all the prophets were quoting the Bible. Yes. I think in is it first kings or 2 kings chapter 4 the bible speaks of Solomon giving the the the the place to to to to Gerba one of the 70 princes. So scripturally it was this but the word for that day said that God the dogs were going to lick the blood of h Jezebel and the husband and that was the word to be fulfilled then it doesn't know what is written already eventually they got it is theirs yes but for that time and that season there was a particular word and when you fail it you may coach it all you want like I tell you the prophets where inspired and they all prophesied wrong and they prophesied a lie even though they could point it to the scripture. Hallelujah. Now talking about the mighty works of uh Jesus Christ in the sadistician age, brother Abraham says that this age does not have those works. Oh, they had the written word but not the revealed word. This was the reformation period. But fear not little flock. God said I will restore. But I my my emphasis was just getting the understanding that having the written word is not enough. &gt;&gt; And to live it to see it manifest it has to be revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Now, I hope I'm not the only one who is alarmed by all what is going on. We live in a country where practically uh uh certain uh do I say drugs? Well, pot is legal on the streets. It's something that some years back you would be arrested for it. Now is sold in shops, legitimate license shops. Disobedience from kids. Pornography in schools. Nobody can stop it because they are not carrying papers and books. No, it's on simple devices. The technology is available. The gospel is presented in all forms of v unashamedly in all forms of variance. But you see, yeah, just think of all of that and then think of yourself. God chose you to live in this age. &gt;&gt; He chose you to overcome these conditions &gt;&gt; and he gave you what it takes to overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The question is, are we going to take what he gave us and add something else that we trust will help us or are we going to take just what he gave us? That is where we have to come to. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Now, Brother Ram says in the that the end time message, I don't know if I had it. Yes. End time evangelism. But Ram says end time messenger and message should meet end time conditions. We are here now. The conditions are here now. You know that God has given what it takes to overcome them. Are we going to take them? Are we going to dilute them? Are we going to polish it? Are we going to make it better, improve it? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so these are the things that we have to sort of understand and deal with that what we have received is answer. If somebody is sick today, they are going to the doctor to get well. But seeing the doctor does not make you well. Oh, the doctor can get a diagnosis. Oh, they can give you a prescription. That does not make you well. You can fill the prescription. Sometimes you may even take it and you won't be well. But here's the difference. If you don't take it as prescribed, you are underdosing yourself. If you take it more than it was prescribed, you are overdosing yourself. Both of which are dangerous to your health. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But if you take it as prescribed, even if you are not healed, you make the doctor responsible for your health. This is where we've gotten to. There is a condition. God says these conditions are dangerous. Now we know and we see it and we live it. And he has given us what it takes to overcome them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only thing is are we going to stick strictly to it so that God becomes responsible for us or are we going to say the way we deem fit and appropriate? You know, let's do it this way. Maybe let's show a little bit of grace here. The last time I checked, grace was what God has given us to recognize the revealed word for the day. &gt;&gt; Grace never meant, oh, leave the way you are and nobody talks about it and that is grace. No. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So God has said in his word that there's going to be a bride in this age. He knew this age. He knew that there will be a people who will fall in love with this revealed word and they'll be willing to take it as is. They will be willing to live it, eat it. They will be willing to prophesy again as it has been given to us. Hallelujah. So the proof of the fact that you are in lect is in the fact that you are able to recognize the word for your day. Hallelujah. It's not how many scriptures we can quote, how many scriptures we can. No, by the fact that we can recognize the word for our day. Praise the name of the Lord. Now brother Abraham in the spoken word is original seed. It says didn't Jesus say of the prophets who the word of God came to who did the word of God came to prophets. Didn't Jesus call them gods? Why God was manifest in them? What was it? The spoken word manifested. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the prophets themselves were the manifestation of the spoken word. But yet even in Acts 7 stated that the Jews had persecuted and murdered the prophets. So here we are the most religious people in some of the most religious places on earth and cities but they were killing the very people that were sent to them. &gt;&gt; And they were people of God. They knew the written word. But they always missed it when it was manifested. Hallelujah. And when you miss the present truth, you may labor, but it'll be in vain. &gt;&gt; Now, as we talk about these examples, the important thing is for us to remember that they are written as an example for us so that we don't follow the same things. Praise the name of the Lord. I wanted to see what brother Abraham says about the unpardonable sin. He says sin is rejecting the revealed will of God. Sin in its initial form is to reject the revealed word of God. What God or the will of God? When God has revealed something as his will and to reject it is to blaspheme and to reject God. Hallelujah. And so this is where we are now. I had marked here because I thought I some I often over talk and then I I I go overboard. So I had marked here. But right now we have a few a few minutes to go. Don't worry, I'll finish very soon. And so I just want to draw attention to something very important. And we all know that that the human body or or or for life to manifest in the natural sense, the seed has to come through the body into the bride for there to be life. Correct? &gt;&gt; The seed has to come through the body. It's the same with God. It has not changed. Now uh I know there are doctrines and things and everything but I just want to tell you something. There is no other way scientific or otherwise for there to be life unless the seed comes through the body. Now in Acts chapter 8 we find out that there was a man supposedly a black man from Ethiopia from the court of Candice. He had gone to Jerusalem. He's returning a devout man, a man of authority. He has the scriptures. He's learned enough. He can even read it. But he couldn't understand it. And this is what is good about the word. Even when he couldn't understand it, the Lord manifested in his favor. The word that he couldn't understand, still God came in his favor. Don't stop feeding on the word, brother. &gt;&gt; Don't stop feeding on the word, my sister. And so he's reading the word and then God sends his man. He calls Philillip say go there go and join the guy. And so he joins him. What was God doing at this point? He was sending a man who has re received a revealed word so that through the body seed could be deed in the bride. So he looks at him he's reading. Now the Bible doesn't say he was reading loud but I can tell you that Philip heard him reading &gt;&gt; and so he heard he hears him reading and says do you understand what you are reading say how can I if nobody explains to me come come and sit by me and so he goes and sits by him and then they start reading and then as he was reading as is the prophet talking about himself or another and that's the opening for Philillip and the Bible says he preached Jesus unto him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now you know the book of the acts was written as an example for us. He preached Jesus unto him. What it doesn't say is that he preached baptism in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ too. Because after he preached and he preached and he preached and the man got convinced the moment they saw water, the man says, "This is water. What stops me from getting baptized?" &gt;&gt; Right? Meanwhile, in the Old Testament, and that's all the Bible they had. There was no New Testament. They were the New Testament in writing. And in the Old Testament, the word baptism even doesn't appear. The word baptized does not even appear. So, Philillip preached baptism to him. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Here is the water. What stops you?" Why? A child of God, a part of the body of Christ that has the seed is being deposited. for life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is what happened. And we see it repeated again in chapter nine where Paul is going. Saul is going to cut the Christians. He's going to put them to jail and things like that. And then he meets the Lord Jesus Christ. He's smitten blind. Jesus does not talk to him. Jesus does not say, "Okay, here the scripture says this, that and preach to him." No. Why? He was no longer in the flesh. But he sent him to part of his body that has the seed. And so he goes into h Damascus and then he sends Ananas to his house. Go to him. Ananas goes, speaks to him, prays for him. He gets healed of his blindness and the word says he got baptized right away. So Ananas also preached Jesus and baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to him &gt;&gt; and when he obeyed the Bible says straight away he started preaching that Jesus is the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Acts chapter 10. I know we have a little time. Acts chapter 10. Cornelius, an angel appears to him. He's a devout man. He has given arms. He's risen up to the Lord. Everybody knows that this a good man. An angel appears to him. The angel that don't say, "Okay, here is the Bible. This is why Jesus did do this, do that." In my own sense, I was think that if an angel is speaking to you, maybe it'll be more believable. But that is not God's way. God says, "No, send and call one of my children &gt;&gt; who has a seed. Praise the name of the Lord." And so Peter comes there and speaks to him and the Bible says even while he was speaking they received the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So this is what I'm saying and I'm trying to draw attention to that for the gospel to go forth and I hope you don't think I'm doing any criticism here. It takes more than tapes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I listen to tapes. I love tapes. I would want them played here. I would want everybody to listen to them. But a man has to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; More than that, a man has to live the gospel. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not sure why. Anyway, I'll just keep through some of the the next quote is uh from Smeirnan church age. Brother Ram says in every age we have exactly the same pattern. That is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger they express the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully thought. I like the fact that I underlined it, faithfully thought and it is intentional. Because you see, to be faithfully thought, you have to be willing to learn. A lot of times to we we go through a lot of things and learn this theology and listen to the great preacher and great minister and on and on and on. And then if the Lord shows us grace, we pounce upon the message and then we hold on to what we have and we think it's something and yes, it's something out there. It's not wrong. It's something out there and it was the word for another age. It's it's good. It's great. But to have life today, this is it. &gt;&gt; And so we hold on. We hold on. And then we are losing something. We need to be faithfully taught. That's what the scripture says. But of course, all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken. &gt;&gt; And for this, I want the believers to say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Remember Paul warned the people to say only what he said." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now what the difference and what the distinction here think of Apollos great powerful minister calls him a baptist preacher and he says at that place calls him a lawyer he received something he call some revelation went all the way up to John's baptism that's it and he's powerful and he's preaching and he's doing things and he passes through Ephesus and he preaches and people get converted. But you see by the time Paul got to those people they had not received the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It takes a person who has received the revealed word who has the seed to deposit the seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So he preached to them. They have believed. The Bible calls them disciples. But when they asked them say we we don't even know that there is holy spirit you know Apollos himself was lacking but when he went elsewhere to preach and he met a prisoner they went to his meeting he is the man preaching they listen to him they didn't challenge him and then they invited him and the bible says they revealed to him the more perfect way &gt;&gt; and because he was a seed he did not move his head and say no no no I'm the preacher I'm the no he accepted head it now understand it though that getting into the body is not the same as depositing seed like I'm saying I have a head I have a hands I have legs they are all good for me but those don't deposit seed I can't go further than that but that is the the reality of things praise the name of the living God so the word is still the same today and men who have received the revealed word still have a duty to preach the word. Glory to God. I'm getting to a place where I can stop. So from the beginning of the church ages, God has had different promises to different ages. Now for of all the ages, we are the only age that has the promise not just of resurrection but rapture too. We are the only age that has the promise of a body change. Now the age that receives a promise also receives an allorted word to fulfill the promise. So the message of Luther completely scriptural but it not produce a body change in this age. Westless message completely scriptural will not produce the promise for today. The message in every age met the conditions of the age. Now we are in the final age. Hallelujah. It will take the message of the hour &gt;&gt; to produce the promise of this hour. &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Now in identifying Christ of all ages, Abraham says all what those prophets were that was God in those prophets. Jesus said, "So you called them God so the word of God came to and here I am the son of God. How do you condemn me, oh vine? The same thing is today. It's God manifested in flesh. Watch this carefully. He said the same is today. The same thing that was happening then is today. But now what the three things that he used to reference to the message is God manifested in flesh. The message of the hour, the light of the day. &gt;&gt; Then he says we can't have them other messages back there. They have done been lived up. We live in a glare of light. Hallelujah. I I I'll just finish now. Praise the name of the Lord. So I just want to draw attention to this that there are many things that Jesus did and he did them as a unique sign that identifies him to the extent that he said even the things that I'm telling you if you don't believe it believe me for the signs sake. So the signs were unique to convince. Now you can go through those signs and see if there is any of them that has not been revealed today. That has not been revealed in this ministry. Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when God does it and only he does what he does and when he does it, it is to tell us something. And I believe personally that only the bride will recognize it. Anyway, let me go quickly. The anointed ones at the end time. Brother says, "Now I want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape talking to us. You might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message. I am no I have no more to do with it than nothing. No more than just a voice. And my voice even against my better judgment. I wanted to be a trapper, but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and determined to do. I wasn't the one that appeared down at the river." You all know what he's referring to. &gt;&gt; I was only standing there when he appeared. I'm not the one that performs these things and for tells these things that happens as perfect as they are. I I'm only the one that is near when he does it. Can it be more sincere than this? I was only a voice that he used to say it. It wasn't what I knew. It's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel. These two things are saying the same thing. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel. Oh no. It was the manifestation of the son of man. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel his message. It was the mystery that God unfolded. It's not a man. It's God. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So this is what is happening. Those signs are there to convince us. But I believe that most of us never witness any of those signs. At least not in the ministry of Abraham with either not alive or too little and yet we are here. What does that tell you? That you have believed the sign. Oh rather you believe the voice of the sign. And that is more important. If what called you is the voice, praise the name of the Lord, then it's a greater uh level of grace than the sign. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Try this. Yes. Now, everyone, Reverend, this is our hope is in God. I want everyone to be aware that the things that I speak is not myself. That's not my voice. It's my voice but not me using it. Hallelujah. So who is using that voice? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; This is a God who does not do anything by chance. He never does any. No, he means what he is doing and it's for a purpose. And you and I are the purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. gifts and callings are without repentance. Arab says he told me if I get the people to believe me said that seems strange for me to have to say this you believe in me said aren't you supposed to believe God you must believe that you must believe God and believe Christ and believe the Holy Ghost then after believing all of them God wants you to believe me &gt;&gt; when it gets to this point we have to make a choice whether we are believers or not. Hallelujah. If you believe the man, then this is what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. And believe me goes beyond, oh, it's reasonable. Oh, I agree. &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if I'm supposed to believe it, then how do I prove it? Hallelujah. So it's by the scripture first of all because every revelation no revelation should go contrary to this word but after that it's also by vindication. Hallelujah. Because there is something that moves God. Complete obedience will always move him. Praise the name of the living God. Let me go to this quickly. I said therefore speaking face speaking face to face with this supernatural being that is brother Abraham I believe it with all my heart I was talking about his experience and if I can get you to believe me with all your heart that's what moves Godmen so it's not just oh okay I believe him with all my but this guy is also good and oh this person and this one and this I got a dream and this I got this revelation okay we've tried that for many years. Can we now focus on this one and see what the Lord does? Praise the name of the living God. Hallelujah. I'll skip some of these. And so I'll call the musicians. It's 9:00. I don't want to take too much time. And um I'll read this last one. This is God's power to transform. Now, it's hard. It's hard to say this. It's very hard because speaking to the people who feel the same way I do and the way I have been for many years. But since the opening of those seven seals and of them angels just behind the mountain yonder, this has become a new book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is something that we have to take very seriously &gt;&gt; because this Bible has been there for 2,000 years &gt;&gt; and it has done what it was meant to do and we have to just be careful about it because it's the new book that sets us apart. is the new book that you read and you know that you are the bride. It's this new book that will tell you not just that you are forgiven but you never did it in the first place. It's this new book that tells you about your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. It is this new book that will tell you about your future home. Hallelujah. And so when you miss the new book, you are reading from the same old book and many a times this old book has a lot of condemnation. Praise the name of the Lord. But God has given us a new book. Not another this same book. Praise the name of the Lord. But through the lenses of the message, you get a new book. Praise the name of the Lord. Let's not reject it. &gt;&gt; Let's not underestimate it. It is meant for our salvation. It is meant for our healing. It is meant for our deliverance. It is meant for every aspect of all we are. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God be with us all. May we may he strengthen us to live the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. I was going to mention but I forgot that we have visitors among us. Brother Boss, God bless you. And I think it's the brother-in-law, brother Sam. God bless you. We hope you're feel welcomed. Shall we be on our feet? So you think uh keep me true. [Music] Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. There's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour to be true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Give me true. There's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power. Every hour be true. [Music] Amen. Let's bow down our hearts. Precious Lord, we thank you for this time of refreshing in your presence. We thank you for your love. We thank you for your provision. We thank you that you chose to present this present truth to us. &gt;&gt; We thank you that you gave us what it takes to embrace it. Father, we pray that you help us to focus on it, that you help us to feed on it, that you help us to live by it, that you help us to see it manifested in flesh, Lord, &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord, and we desire more of you, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, in all this chopped up way that I presented this, may the Holy Ghost take it and interpret it to the hearts of your children. Lord, bless us, Lord. Oh Lord, as we come to the end of this uh service, lead a sly home. Be with every one of us, oh God. And help us, oh Lord, to be mindful of what you've done for us. &gt;&gt; Help us to be reminded constantly, Lord. Make a way for us to set a time to set time aside with you that we can always be in your presence regardless of where we are, Lord. Because this is a time and season that the bride must stay close to its groom and the groom is the revealed word Lord.
