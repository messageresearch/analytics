wonderful song service it's wonderful when you come in here and he's here you just feel it you know brother random said it so many times you you have a Congregation of people together in one mind and one Accord singing you're bound to hear from heaven when the minister walks in and that's what's going on it's tremendous I just would like to invite you tonight to turn with me in the Book of Revelation we're going to begin our study in uh the exposition of the seven Church ages so just a couple of scriptures before we get too far Revelations chapter 1 verse 1. and then Malachi 4. Revelations 1 verse 1. the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand let's just turn over to Malachi for we'll just read the very familiar scripture of verse 5 and 6. Malachi chapter 4. verse 5. says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word amen thank you Lord that you've given us Revelation Lord as we've read about him revelation father we never ever want to take it for granted or take it lightly father when we read your word we know that it's actually not us speaking it's you speaking through us and father we're so thankful for this word we just cherish it and we just ask that Lord you would take us by the hand tonight father and walk with us along the way and that you would speak to us father and through us that we would hear from you tonight we just ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I just wanted to announce remind us that we have brother Danny del mundo who will be here this weekend and uh we'll have two Services Saturday night six o'clock Sunday morning regular time 10 o'clock and I'm sure it will be a wonderful time around the things of the lord we do have a new schedule for October events uh we'll have it up on the website and uh sorry I just feel a little nervous tonight it's kind of a strange thing but I'm certainly thankful to be uh doing this I know what's going on it's a spiritual battle and it's it's a good thing because I don't think the devil wants us doing this and that's a good thing because that's exactly what we're going to do exactly what the devil doesn't want us to do we're going to get right into this book there's so much in here that I think is so pertinent for a Believer and we'll just see what the Lord will do as I mentioned before um we have more books I think I said they were coming but for anybody who needs one there are more seven Church age books the exposition of the seven Church ages it's the one that's produced uh produced by brother George Smith Believers International is who it's produced by and he has inserted the actual Bible verses where brother Branham in the original version The Blue Book he actually just made reference to the scripture and this book actually contains the printed scriptures so it's it's actually quite handy because you don't have to get a Bible and go on reference you can actually see the scripture right there so if anybody has a desire for one of those books we certainly have more just let me know um I think it's a I think it's an amazing book I could give you a little bit of a testimony myself my first introduction to the message of the hour was actually uh exposition of the seven Church ages that that was my very first introduction um of any sort of what we would call message material and uh I I mean I was 100 in the world and had a desire for God but didn't really understand very much about God I just felt like church was a business and people treated it that way and it was just a money-making scheme and that was my idea of Christianity and probably it was formed by what I saw on TV because of course I watched TV when I was in the world and saw all of the mainstream what do you call them the the maybe the mega preachers the TV Ministries and it seemed like the only thing they did was call on money they didn't actually preach any word and I I would just say yeah that's Christianity but I had the uh I had the ability to meet someone who was a real believer and uh through that experience was able to get my hands on a seven Church age book an exposition of the seven Church ages and I would like to say that that actually was the opportunity for the Heavens to open and the angels to sing and uh me to have a conversion in my life because I read that book but that wasn't the case I opened it up and I read the first few words of the first chapter and I just be honest with you I I thought this is weird man I don't know what to make of this and I put it down and didn't look at it for years later for years I uh it was it was an interesting thing but I think the Lord just knows exactly what we need and he knows exactly when we need it and uh he he allows things to happen very specifically in our lives we can feel like we're hiccuping along and stumbling along and some people maybe feel like they're very driven and and very deliberate about every single maneuver they make but just be clear about one thing we're only doing what the father wants done we're only living Our Lives the way that he wants us to live them even if we're 100 calculated or we're stumbling and groping in darkness we're doing exactly what the Lord wants us to do and we won't do anything else his will will be accomplished in our lives but I know I was stumbling around and groping in darkness there and that was my first introduction to this book and it's a very uh maybe call it a difficult read if you're not a reader and it can be really uh almost burdensome for some people it was for me when I first started looking at it but when you actually start to understand about the message of the hour and you start to understand who this prophet in our day is and the word that is actually brought to us you you you start to realize there's a lot that's inside this book that that really does something to the believer now I'm probably preaching to the choir but I'm just going to take my time with this book I'm not going to rush it and we might spend a couple of services just on the introduction and if you were to read the introduction you could probably read it if you're a good reader you'd probably read it in about a minute and a half and you'd be done I think when you listen to it on on the message app it's roughly two minutes and that's all there is for that but there's so much that said just even in the introduction that is uh so pertinent um just the overview of it um pertaining to the the the Revelation or the exposition of the seven Church ages it's actually it's not just something that brother Branham came up with um he was inspired to preach it and it's all out of the word it's pertaining to Revelations chapter one up to Revelations chapter three um just before John gets invited to come up to heaven while he's on the Isle of Patmos for the testimony of Jesus and uh there is actually the explanation of of what John is going through in there and I'm sure we're all familiar with this but just to sort of do a really slow overview of of what what is actually in here brother Bradham he preached this series of the church ages in 196 d and I believe this book wasn't released until 1965 until the year that he actually went on to his reward but you could listen to all of the messages and if you've read the church age book if you've listened to the church age book how many knows that there is actually an audio version of the church age book that you can listen to does everybody know that if everybody doesn't know that I want to make sure that everybody does know that because you don't necessarily have to just read it you can put in headphones and press play and listen to someone narrate the the exposition of the seven Church ages and and the way the man reads it is very very clear and concise and some might even say it's a little bit dry but the word is there and and when you hear that word and you recognize that word it does something on the inside of the inside you can actually listen to it um the exposition of the seven Church ages read by someone it's narrated it's a narrated version but you can also listen to brother Branham preach the exposition of the seven Church ages in 1960 and when you know the exposition of the seven shirts is the book printed and you go back and you listen to the messages that he preaches you could just say Amen because it's exactly what is in there he just says it in different ways and and it's clarified uh a bit it's grammaratized brother Branham called it um when he actually put it into print when he put the book into print but speaking of this book specifically there's some people who would question the validity of this book and I I don't want to get into a debate with anyone about it whether they they believe it or not um I can only go off of what I've seen and what I've heard and I'm sure every one of us would be able to say the same thing and I think it's super important for us to know where we stand because if we're going to pick up some material and read a book we need to know exactly that we have the Holy Ghost and we can put it through the filter of the Holy Ghost when we read a book Satan is really Sly he's going to come to us in a present that's beautifully wrapped with a bow tie that's very sparkly he's going to come to us in Flowery things in really good ideas and theories but you know what if it doesn't line up with the word how will we know if it lines up with the word if we don't know the word that's the important thing and you know I believe it this way and maybe it would be debatable but I just think it's it's like this if if you haven't read the entire Bible I don't know how many people have or haven't I'm not going to ask the question you don't necessarily have to read the entire Bible you don't necessarily have to memorize good portions of the Bible it's very good to do the word of God says to eat the book but what my point is is the word of God also says that when he the spirit of truth comes he will lead you and guide you into all truth when you have the Holy Ghost in your life you can pick up anything and you will have the Holy Spirit tell you stop reading it or keep reading it Amen to it or no that's wrong there will be something inside of you that will resonate with what it is you're reading or whatever you're listening to so I'm not saying don't read your Bible I'm going to say eat the book and I would say eat every single bit of it every crumb of the Bible eat it all it'll do you good you might not get it the genealogy might just about kill you but just do it anyway it'll do something for you I was just saying mentally I was referring to mentally it will only give you life the word of God will only give you life forgive me for saying kill you the genealogy is very difficult that's the way to say it it's very difficult thing to get through but some people question the validity of this book The the exposition of the seven Church ages um the reason for it I believe is because one of the reasons maybe is because uh he had brother Branham had someone help him grammatize the book help him do all of the proper spelling and pronunciation and and setting it out properly so that it would be in a readable version um I know brother Brown was challenged many times in his ministry about how he would say things whether he would say Pulpit or pulpit and and different things and people go to theology school and they're taught all of these different things there's choruses that are are specializing in in being polished and acting a certain way and brother Branham he wasn't that way and so he had help putting it all together so that it would you know come together in in a book form that would be acceptable maybe by the masses but so some people would say that brother Lee Vale who was the teacher closest to brother Bradham at the time he was the one that actually put the book together that it wasn't brother Branham that did it and uh you know I think you have to draw your own conclusion with that whether it was another man that that did it or whether it was brother Bradham that did it see what that book says take a look at what that book says does it actually point to the word of God and if it does then just say Amen to it but if it doesn't then I think there's cause for concern maybe there's cause for a question or or maybe we can take away and say you know maybe I need to put it on the back burner and just leave it alone but if it actually refers to the word of God then say Amen to it I don't think you can actually refuse it if you have the Holy Ghost in your life there's something in there that drives you towards the word of God but whether some people question the validity of it or not is basically irrelevant to me and that's just my view but I would say if you have a question about it read it see if it resonates with the word of God so I'm sorry I'm I'm really taking my time with this I know there's some people maybe that don't have this book that could look at this online just for those people who are wondering in the audience I do get questions from people who are absolutely random individuals because we stream on YouTube there's other people that see it and there's people that have questions and it's interesting so as we go as we're recording I want to make sure that I'm I'm dealing with a one-room schoolhouse for the people that have never heard about it and and the people that could probably quote it or or preach it better than I could you know um for the people that say this wasn't brother bradham's book that uh you know this other brother grammaratized it and maybe changed the words and everything there's a brother that actually has the manuscript that was actually used to create this book and he has brother branham's uh writing in this book The manuscript that they use to actually edit this this book before they went to print and he said you know his family had it his family was really good friends with brotherly Vale and uh he said that brotherly Vale gave that book to his dad when he was young when they went to publishing because he didn't need it anymore he thought it would be a nice gift and so he has this book the transcripts of of the exposition of the seven Church ages that he said as a family we would have devotions and go through and see where brother Branham actually corrected and said no change this and alter that and he says every single page in there is edited by hand by the prophet so it's not something that's just one-sided about it being one man some other people would say you know this is Brother branham's book this is kind of where I went with it initially when I saw and I put it down I saw the there's a picture of the man inside with the with the halo over his head and we'd call it the pillar of fire and that's just what I saw it as when I I first saw it and I thought yeah this is another man's book and he's got a book and she's got a book and everybody's got a book in this world and and once you're published you're something right but you know it's not that case in in this book it's a different case this book is actually referring to the word of God this book is referring to the word of God for our day not just any day but but for our day and if again if there's any questions about whether this is valid according to the word of God just go ahead and read the book and see if it actually refers to scripture or if it's just a man's idea just slipped in the pages and and somehow now there's this strange thing going on but you know I just love how brother Branham he he explains it from the very beginning but all we have to do is read it we know that it points to the Bible and here's the thing that really I think is probably the most critical part we need to establish whether the Bible is the absolute or not and if the Bible is the absolute then we have a conversation but if we come to a place where we say you know maybe the Bible is just a a debatable book it's not necessarily the absolute then I don't know if we have a whole lot to talk about because we could be talking about different things right we could be speaking absolutely different languages but if we can agree that the Bible is actually valid that it is the absolute then we we've got somewhere to go we've got a our very first foothold maybe on the ladder going upwards with this with this word so tonight I just want to take a real slow look at the uh the beginning of this book and I just want to take these scriptures and just sort of set the the the base for it out of Revelations chapter one this is the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signify it by his Angel unto his servant John I think it's so beautiful we talked about this a little while ago how we have had it sent and signified To Us by an Angel this message of the hour this book that we're looking at is actually speaking about Revelation this book is based on the exposition of the seven Church ages so this is very relevant to the Book of Revelation I just think it's it's amazing you know uh we could just go on and read verse two here who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw this is where we come into play in in verse three blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand it's such a beautiful thing we don't even have to read it ourselves all we have to do is listen to it brother Branham talks about it in the book we'll get into it eventually but he talks about how you know there was a time where it was just a priest that read the book because most people were illiterate they didn't have the ability to read so the priest would open the book and he would read the book and precious words would come forth out of their mouths and it would actually do something for them but let's just take take and look at the introduction here we'll we'll start with this um out of the exposition of the seven Church ages this is the part that I was talking about that's really uh like a minute and a half of reading and uh Lord willing will take an hour and some and actually talk about it maybe 45 minutes I don't want to keep us late um do we have it up there there we go so brother Bradham he says here in in the first paragraph though this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as the godhead water baptism Etc found in Revelation chapters one through three its main theme is the setting forth of a detailed study of the seven Church ages I myself when I first heard about this had no idea there was even seven Church ages I didn't realize that there was seven churches and I didn't even realize there was a need for the seven Church ages are we having troubles bringing that up sorry technical difficulties it happens there we go thanks guys brother random says this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of Revelation myself when I was growing up I was drawn to the Book of Revelation I thought it was a an intriguing book there's so much in there the the last book of the Bible how does all of the Bible culminate in that last book and and I'm so I was so thrilled when I finally started to dig into the this book The the seven Church ages to hear Brother Branham say that it's necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the Revelation for out of the ages comes the seals and out of the seals comes the trumpets and out of the trumpets come the vials and so what he's talking about in there is further on from Revelations 4 5 6 and 7. that's that's what he's referring to there that's pretty much jam-packed in just a couple of words there's so much in there but out of out of the what's going on here out of the ages comes the seals out of the seals comes the trumpets out of the trumpets come the files like the first burst of a Roman Candle the church Ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light but once the Brilliance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the Revelation opens up wide before our wandering eyes I just love how brother Branham sets it out here and he says like the first burst of a Roman Candle the church Ages come forth with a mighty illumination how does this happen brothers and sisters the only way it happens is in the next paragraph we sought once the Brilliance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation and you know the only way that we're going to get divine revelation in our lives is to get the Holy Ghost and that's the critical Factor without the Holy Ghost this book isn't going to mean very much to us but I believe that we could read this book and it could Inspire us to say wait a second there's something to this maybe I don't fully understand what's going on but it's pointing to the word of God and and even though this man's picture is in there and it could look like a man's idea of everything that's going on he's talking about these doctrines and things maybe there's something in here that could really be of value to me and once it happens brothers and sisters once there is a divine revelation given to the believer It Goes Forth like the burst of a Roman Candle are we familiar with Roman candles we know what they are brother Bradham refers to them everyone knows what they are they're like a stick and they have the balls of fire inside there and when you light one you light the end of it and it shoots a ball and then it shoots another ball and then it shoots another ball and it just keeps doing that and it's usually done at night and when you're not expecting it it's quite surprising when it happens but it's important to recognize that you can be in complete darkness and as you're reading this in scriptural terms spiritual terms in complete darkness suddenly what happens is there's a burst that goes forth and it's a bright light and it illuminates it it shines like a flare and you can see suddenly you can see so much that you couldn't see before that's what brother Branham is referring to here like the burst of a Roman Candle the first burst the church Ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light I think that's amazing if we look at the message of the hour how how could that apply to this he says without understanding this there could be no further light but once the Brilliance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of Revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes when I read that the first time I thought wow I I've always been fascinated with the Book of Revelation and and all the Mysteries and the Book of symbols that we're familiar with but when I heard that I thought wow there's an opportunity to actually understand this and we know that in the denominational World many times people shy away from this they say no we're not qualified to talk about this nobody has the interpretation of it but you know if you can actually believe if you if you have the ability to receive the word if you have ears to hear what the spirit saith unto the church you can receive the idea that God sent a prophet and when that happens that changes everything because the word that he speaks is in his own when you hear thus saith the Lord It's not a man speaking that's God speaking through a man to all men and when that happens when we can get that initial Revelation light upon light follows until the whole of Revelation opens up why before warning us no we're not talking about the Roman Candle even though we use that as an example we're not talking about that we're talking about the illumination by the spirit of the word of God in our lives and and specifically in important doctrinal things like the godhead like water baptism to understand that if you get baptized in in a trinitarian baptism you're just coming according to another recipe you're not coming according to the recipe of the word of God that says that if you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost how can you go contrary to the recipe and get the right results we've talked about this in the past we've all probably heard it for those people who cook or bake if you've ever made anything in your life you cannot take sugar out of a recipe and just throw salt in in its place and say it'll be okay it will not be okay sometimes it'll cook exactly the same but other times it won't even cook the same but goodness sakes if it cooked the same and you tasted it it would just about put you on the floor if you're expecting sweet and you get that much salt it would be terrible if you don't cook according to the recipe it can look exactly right but you won't get the right results but if you cook according to the recipe even the first time Trier the so long as you follow it to the letter you can get the right results and some people would call it beginner's luck isn't it amazing with the word of God you don't have to worry about beginner's luck all you have to do is come as a little child and unless you do come as a little child you will have no part in the Kingdom but light upon light follows elimination of the word upon elimination of the word the revelation of the word you know talking about revelation we can talk about the the the very specific story where Jesus said to his disciples you know who do men say that I am what's going on what's the word on the street guys who who does man say that I am and some said you know John or some said Elias and some said the prophets and and we know that Jesus he said okay that's fine that's what they're saying out there but what do you say who do you say that I the son of man am you know I I know that there is no time frame in there is there it doesn't say they waited for 15 minutes or they went away and prayed about it or had a study they didn't do any of that it just says that Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and what did Jesus say light upon light came forward and showed you that John that that wasn't that wasn't something that man taught you you didn't learn that in school it wasn't something that you pulled out of your pocket as a handbook to say what's what what do we do in this case here what what does the denomination say we should do no it was a divine revelation and we know that brother Bradham says here but once the Brilliance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the Revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes I want to say this too brothers and sisters every scripture is is is is is I I uh maybe I'll stop I don't want to refer to this as scripture it can sound like I am let's just be clear I would never want to say that what brother Bradham says is scripture his words here what I what I wanted to say was every scripture can have a compound meaning and compound Revelation what I want to say is what brother Branham is saying here can have a compound meaning and a compound Revelation because I believe he's speaking directly about the Book of Revelation but I also believe he's speaking directly about Revelation divine revelation from God the interpretation of the word to the believer individually and we know that's the new birth but light upon life follows until the whole of the Revelation opens wide before I wanting ice and I want to say this the whole of the Revelation the whole of the word of God the whole understanding comes to us by revelation after revelation after wave of understanding we start to understand all these different things and people might say like what I would say like serpent seed I know myself when I first started to really engage the word of God engage God as God just to say to him okay if you're a God maybe through this message of the hour then just be God to me show me that you're God and you know what he will if you want him to he will and he'll do it in such a way that you will know if it's not for the public masses we know that we live in the in in the mysterious time of the third poll and we can get into the deep doctrinal stuff I don't want I don't want to do that tonight we can do it it's easy to do if we really want to but but I think we need to know our ABCs and the ABCs are understanding where we stand who we are getting the fact that if we've got the Holy Ghost then we'll get this Revelation and the Revelation when it comes in our lives it'll just keep compounding in our lives and I don't think we ever stop learning by revelation some people might say I know the the scripture I remember brother Ken teaching it very clearly he said that the Pharisees and the Sadducees they would have Scrolls that would be the Bible that would be their book and they knew it so well they probably even do today that they could take a pin and stick it through that role that scroll and they would be able to unroll it and tell you before they unroll it or as they unroll it exactly what scriptures that pin pierced those guys knew their scripture we know our scripture I would say I know my scripture to an extent but not like that but I rely on the Lord I rely on him we we suffer from a condition called Soft living here and I know that we all do because we all eat the same food some people can go and get the the organic stuff but you know what brother batam talked about it very clearly back in the in the 60s and the 50s about how the food is Tainted the food that we eat is not normal food this is not the food that we're going to have in the Millennium but we have the word of God that's why we pray for our food when we eat our food if we pray for our food God will bless it to our bodies but let's get back to talking about Revelation that's where we're at tonight talking about the exposition of the seven Church ages the introduction of it brother Branham saying that light upon light follows until the whole of the Revelation opens up wide before our wandering eyes not just the Book of Revelation but the entire Revelation the entire divine revelation about there being a prophet in our day about there being a message of the hour and what that message of the hour is just repent and just come unto the the Lord according to the word for our day get back to the word is what brother Bradham talks about in the church age book just get back in line and he goes on to say and we edified and purified by its Spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing how many want to be ready for his glorious appearing I think I I just yeah does something to me I think yeah man I want to be ready for his glorious appearing and we know that even looking at the message of the hour brother Branham said his appearing is now the coming is yet but his appearing is now but he also went on to say you know what he's here so I'm not going to get into all of that tonight I just want to just really focus on this I can I can go a hundred ways with this but I I apologize if it seems like I am a little maybe unsettled with it because I do feel a bit like a kid in a candy shop I don't know if I'm a teacher per se but just to look at this introduction it's so amazing and it can be so easy to just turn it on and just let it play and a minute and a half later it's over and now you want to get into something else but if we can just take some time and really think about what he's saying in this introduction what this book really has inside of it I'm not trying to glorify the book and say it's as fantastic as the word of God because this is the absolute right here brothers and sisters this is the absolute the word of God is what we stake it all on brother Branham I was looking for the quote in the back I'll bring it he says that if you can't take my word for it take the word of God some people would say no no you got to take the word of the prophet but that's actually wrong that's an error because no man will ever be able to share his glory he won't share it God will not share Jesus Christ who is God will not share his glory with any human being ever and we know that because John you know in the Book of Revelation later on two times tried to Bow Down and Worship an angel and the angel said nope don't worship me worship God I'm I'm of your fellow brethren prophets I think it's interesting because some people have said that you know one of those was actually brother Branham has anybody ever heard that before it's an interesting discussion and uh there's another one in there in Revelation we'll get into where uh brother brownie actually has a quote that says he was there and uh I'll get into it later but there's some super fascinating stuff with this and tonight we're just laying in the background setting the foundation for this study as we go it's going to be a long one I hope that we can uh endure we'll maybe take some breaks along the way but we'll continue on with it you know um brother bradhamy says here and we edified and purified by its Spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our Lord and savior the one true God Jesus Christ he says this composition is set forth in the first person as it is a message from my heart to the hearts of the people I think that's beautiful as well he's saying that that's from him his heart directly to anyone that would read it particular pains have been taken to capitalize all names and titles and nouns and pronouns Etc I could probably preach a sermon right there it's interesting though because this is such a vital word these are vital words Even in our day to understand that so many people understand nouns and pronouns and and how important it is how big of a deal are they making of nouns and pronouns in this world today brothers and sisters right and so many times in the denominational World it doesn't matter we can have three it's fine we'll just be plural but what we have here is a prophet of God saying no no no no no we need to be very absolutely specific with this and know that we've got the right pronunciation for the nouns and the pronouns and I'm sure we all know what those are many people will know better than I will I I don't claim to be an expert in that at all brother Tom Ernest was very clear with me on that one time God bless him particular pains have been taken to capitalize all names and titles nouns pronouns Etc that relate to godhead and also the words Bible scripture and the word as we hold this only proper in speaking of the majesty and person of God and His holy word I think that's just magnificent right there he he makes it very clear that this is about the Lord Jesus Christ this is about God this is pointing directly to the word of God this is not just a man's Revelation where it's something that we're going to try and say that you know he gave me some glasses and I can see something a little bit differently or maybe I ate something and had a dream and it gave me an opportunity to see something different we know that brother Branham said that dreams are secondary they're not primary the the prophet's word the prophetic utterance the word of God is primary dreams are always secondary but you know um I just think it's amazing how he just makes this exactly about the Lord Jesus Christ the the the the the god that we serve the one and only Elohim he goes on to say I pray this blessing of God upon each reader is beautiful and may elimination by the spirit of God be each one special portion I think we go to the end of the church age book and and read the very last part of it because he says in there that he's not interested in trying to create a following he's not interested in trying to set up a denomination I'm just paraphrasing it what he wants is for everyone to have their own relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ he starts the book with it and and ends the book with it and you know it's right in line with the word of God I pray a blessing of God upon each reader you know verse 3 we we read in Revelations chapter one blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy here we have brother Bradham saying I pray the blessing of God upon each reader and may elimination by what elimination by William Branham elimination by the message of the hour elimination by a church or a group or some minister elimination by the spirit of God be each one special portion brothers and sisters that is the critical Factor right there with the each each and every every individual we have got to have our own spiritual walk with the Lord we have to have the spirit of God be each one special portion and it's not just a special portion of the of the spirit of God that we get even though it is a special portion of God himself the Lord Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost if we repent and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the mission of our sins then we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost or our special portion each one special portion that's how we get it but the only way we're going to get the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is to come according to the word of God it's got to be according to the word of God it cannot be according to uh a man's interpretation from Nyasia Rome it can't be if we do that we're actually putting salt in in the cake instead of sugar and it's going to look exactly the same it's going to be just for all intents and purposes it's going to look great and you might even have it smell good when it bakes but boy as soon as you taste it it's going to be nasty you know uh talking about the scripture tonight in in Malachi 4 verse 5 and and Revelations 1 1-3 I really wanted to just take from Malachi 4 verse 5 with our last few minutes tonight and just remind us and and and underline and bold it for everyone behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord So In This Book of Malachi we know this I know I'm preaching to the choir tonight but just bear with me it's Wednesday night I know I'll I'll try not to keep us long but here we have a promise in this book and if we can establish the word of God to be the absolute there's coming a time where this Elijah is going to come there's going to be a prophet named Elijah with an Elijah anointing that comes before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and it's interesting because we know that we've seen many false prophets go out that's the word of God and even this one Tony Palmer he said I come to you in the spirit of Elijah I don't know if everyone has seen that video before but if you look at that video If You typed in Tony Palmer um Church in the U.S I can't remember what it's called exactly I can actually find it and send it out on the WhatsApp if you're interested send me a text if you are well what he says is he comes in the spirit of reconciliation in the anointing of Elijah and so if we are wondering where we are today brothers and sisters they have no idea though most of the world has no idea that Elijah's already come right and here we have this guy saying this and now everyone's going whoo ah wow really and really what he was saying to the people The ecumenical council in the United States this is modern history he was saying that the petition the the protest is over Luther's protest is over and if anybody has any questions about it the Catholic church has assigned documents saying that the protest is over and he said so now what are you protesting this was to The ecumenical leaders in the United States of America in in modern history like 10 years ago maybe 15 years ago he was telling him this false prophet I don't know I I think it's amazing when we can look at this because we look at it and understand where we stand we understand exactly the anointings of Elijah but just for the sake of discussion tonight I wanted to point out verse 5 Malachi 4 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord if we just stopped there we would be able to say for sure there is a promise in the Bible that there's coming a time where that Elijah will come now we have to look at the Elijah's that come in the world or the eliases that come in the world what do they do what is their Hallmark what are they talking about are they pointing to the word of God the truth for the hour or are they pointing to a group or a movement or or a denomination and you know many people would say the Catholic Church oh the Catholic Church isn't good I remember growing up in the Pentecostal Realms and they said the Catholic church is the devil but they would also say the Baptists have got it wrong and and the Presbyterians have got it wrong and were the only ones that have it right how can that be isn't it wonderful to think that the Elijah that we know that we have heard that we have been given ears to hear for our day he said you know what's God going to judge the World by he's going to judge it by his word he's not going to judge it by a a an ecumenical movement he's not going to judge it by a theological school by the teaching by the degree that we get from there he's not going to judge it by a denomination he's going to judge it by his word that's why it's so important for us to eat the book get every word in in you just get it down make sure you get it in you you know turn with me quickly while we still have a few minutes over to Matthew chapter 11. talking about Elijah this was something I guess for me that was one of the greatest divinely inspired Revelations for me personally pertaining to the message of the hour and it gave me the ability to say wait a second I need to see what this book has to say what what really is inside this book when I heard this because I had heard Malachi 4 5 um many times but I just couldn't connect the dots I know that you know so here we go in in Matthew chapter 11. let's just jump down to verse 12. Matthew chapter 11 verse 12. and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied unto John this is Jesus speaking here and if ye will receive it this is Elias which was for to come and here we have Jesus saying to the people saying to the disciples saying to everyone that's listening to him he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear let them hear what I would say this let them hear what the spirit saith unto the church because we know that's the exact same verbiage that we find over in the Book of Revelations isn't it interesting to see that it's not a different word it's the same word and and here we have Jesus saying it in the flesh when he's alive on Earth with his feet on the ground but John sees him as the son of man standing in the midst of the candlesticks with the white hair and the eyes of fire and the feet of brass he sees him in his divine nature but here we have Jesus saying if ye will receive it this is Elias which was to come all the prophets and the law prophesied until John turn over to Matthew chapter 17. Jesus was preaching to them he was trying to eliminate this he was trying to shine it on them but we know that they were documenting it for a purpose they were sharing it for the future Generations but there is also a thing for them to to be able to understand we know they had Revelation in their days we've already gone over that tonight but in Matthew chapter 17 verse 9 this is the story of of Mount Transfiguration by the way they just went up and and and they they they had the tremendous experience Jesus hand-picked the brothers that he wanted to go with them up to the top of the mountain it was where Jesus was transfigured before their eyes we've talked about this scripture quite a bit in the past but we know that even in the midst of it there was a human nature that got in the way Peter didn't know what to do he he was awkward and uneasy and brother Brad I mean we brought that quote a while ago he didn't know what to say and he always had to say something and so he said well well why don't we just build an altar what one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias and and and it'll be good and what happened was a bright Cloud overshadowed them and they heard one voice speaking out of that bright Cloud didn't they this is my beloved Son hear ye him and we know that voice was must have been like thunder because they all fell on their face as dead they all became very very afraid in that that moment but then when they opened their eyes when that voice stopped and they looked to see if they were still alive they saw Jesus only that's what the scripture says and we just carry on now after all of that verse 9 and as they came down from the mountain this is Matthew 17 verse 9 and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying television to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come he had already preached to them that Elias was coming and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things according to Malachi he knew that they were all talking about this but Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall they also the son of man suffer of them verse 13 is what I wanted to get to tonight then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of who of John the Baptist so I thought he was talking about Elias wasn't he talking about Elijah he was referring to Elijah Elias in those scriptures but now he's saying John the Baptist so this is where it became crystal clear for me this is where it became that elimination of the of the Roman Candle where it started to really make sense to me and shine a light all around and that's when I started to realize there's way more to this book than what I thought from the beginning and and what it is is that there is five comings of the spirit of Elijah and and we can get into this we don't have time to tonight maybe we will just a little bit we'll touch on it there's five comings documented in the Bible of the spirit of Elijah and four have already happened and we know that we know that there was Elijah there was Elisha and and those stories are just fantastic I just want to preach on those now that we're talking about it there was Elijah there was Elisha there was John the Baptist there was William Branham and there's one more coming and that one more that's coming I wonder was that the one that was standing there with Jesus just to throw it in there just as a thought which one was it that was there with Jesus and and Moses it's an interesting thing but there's another one coming and we know that that's one of the two witnesses the prophet in our day William Bradham he said it that Moses and Elijah will actually be the two witnesses that are mentioned in the Book of Revelations over in Israel and you know I I think it's interesting topic too because some people say that those witnesses will be here when the bride is still here just before the Rapture goes and some say brother Bradham says it he says it that way and he also says that the bride will be gone when they're there so what will it be who knows whether we're here or whether we're not I I think it's interesting because there will be two witnesses in the land of Israel and one of them will have the anointing of Elijah it might not be Elijah himself in the flesh one of them will have the anointing of Elijah so tonight brothers and sisters I just wanted to set the initial background for this for the the the church age book the exposition of the seven Church ages and uh I'm actually going to call the musicians I don't want to keep us long tonight we're going to have two services on the weekend and we went a little bit over last week so I'll try and balance it out a little bit for us so we can maybe go home a little bit early tonight but I just want to encourage us to pray about this pray about the leadership of the Lord in in studying this book there's so much in here that we're going to get into and I purposely didn't get into it very far tonight because there's so much to get into when we get into the revelation of Jesus Christ chapter one there's so much in there I I'm going to find it difficult to stop but I just want to make sure that we take our time we don't rush through this there's so very much in here and just like brother Branham said he prays the blessing of God upon each reader I think that we have the ability as Sons and Daughters of God as Believers of this message of the hour to say hey I want that blessing I want that kind of blessing he's actually prayed the prophet of God prayed for so many people to be healed for so many good things to happen to people in their lives what about saying Hey I want that blessing I want that that special blessing that he said I pray the blessing of God upon each reader and may illumination by the spirit of God be each one special portion I just think Lord let that be me let that Spirit uh elimination by the spirit just be my special portion and I think that he'll Grant it to us I really believe that maybe stand with me tonight as we close let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness to each and every one of us thank you Father for the desire of your children to bring of their licks of Fire Lord to bring of their portion of your spirit to gather together in your name father we thank you for this body of Believers here in Calgary thank you for your goodness to each and every one of us Lord father we thank you that you've given us ears to hear
