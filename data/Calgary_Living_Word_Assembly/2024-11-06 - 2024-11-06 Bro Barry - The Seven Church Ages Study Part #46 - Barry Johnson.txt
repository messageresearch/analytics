powerful father Lord these are not our words these are the words that you gave to a Vindicated Prophet Lord Jesus your very words and we're so thankful Lord that we have a desire to hear these words and to study these words Lord we know that not everyone can take these words father Lord It's like a a medication Lord that only a certain amount at a certain time will work and if we take too much it

we have the Youth Event coming up on the 17th and that will actually not be a youth event per se it will be uh a session on finance by Brother Joel and originally we had announced that we will hold it in the sanctuary here we did the last time but I believe it would be better if we held it in the basement so we will hold it in the basement here of the church after service I believe we're going to start at 2 o' so like we did before if you want to come and attend by all means make arrangements for your lunch lunch will not be served so bring a picnic or run out and grab something quick and come and bring your pen pen and paper and we trust the Lord will add a blessing we also have something special happening that weekend and the next weekend November the 17th and the 24th brother mvin Panetta is going to take the services he's going to speak to us on uh what the Lord has placed on his heart as the treasur of the assembly and I believe it will be a real blessing we've talked about it for uh probably well over a year maybe even two years and uh we just decided the Lord's leadership is now so we're going to go forwards with that on November the 17th as well so we'll have brother mvin take the morning service and then brother Joel will take the info session in the afternoon um we're certainly thankful to be here one more time if you have your Bibles we will just continue on with uh our study in the exposition of the seven Church ages and we' like to read from Revelations chapter 3 Revelations chap 3:1 talking about the sardan church age just a tremendous study I uh I believe I got into the weeds today with uh with the message just it it is so uh amazing Revelations chapter 3: one and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write these things saith he that ha the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's just bow one more time Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that every single Church age father you've given a space to repent and father tonight we just ask Lord that you would forgive us for every single sin and iniquity in our lives Lord father we cannot live in this world and not sin and we know that you know that father but Lord Jesus you have placed something on the inside of the inside that cannot be touched not even by sin and we thank you for that Lord and tonight we pray that you would just Quicken that Gene we pray that you would Quicken that seed that you've placed in your children one more time father that when we leave here tonight we would say that truly you have spoken to us Lord we just love you and we thank you we commit all that's said and done tonight for you and for your glor glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight you may be seated I see I got ahead of myself I typically would do announcements after we seat but I guess maybe a little bit of standing tonight isn't a bad thing last week we uh talked about how the different Church ages the lutherans were the reformation and how brother Bram had that discussion about how in the Reformation age uh they were like the wheat that was um not quite formed yet there hadn't been enough life given through the chaff to Quicken the life into the seed and we know that that's the final part of the cycle the life cycle of a plant that brother branam used which is just a tremendous example he makes it so easy to understand that you have to have a seed and then it actually grows a chute and then you actually have the tassels and then you have the Shu and then you have the seed again and we know that he actually preaches a message the seed shall not be air with the shack and Lord willing will maybe get into that a little bit ways down the road here but you know just sort of recapping on what we were talking about last week brother branam talked about there was a time where you could go out in the field and you could could see the field full of Wheat and you could pick the wheat and you could you could say I've got wheat and you could take it and you could rub it in your hands when it's nice and dry and before the wheat had formed when you do that you would see that it's just chaff there's no actual seed there but at the right time at the right time after being dried after ripening in the sun after enough Life coming from the Shu into this seed that seed formed a life and at the right time the farmer can go out and do it again and he can see the seeds are there and when the temperature is right and the humidity is Right everything is right then he can go and harvest and that's exactly the age in which we're living in that's why I'm going on about it it's actually a pretty amazing comparison and we talked about it last time brother Bram said it in the message the invisible Union of the Bride I can hear the sound of the combine it's coming and that's what's happening it's a amazing when we look at the world around us we can see so much happening where we left off was the reading in Ezekiel 47 verses 2 to5 and uh maybe I'll just read that then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that lookth Eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side and when the man had that had the line in his hand went forth Eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the ankles again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters and the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loins afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that I could not pass over for the waters were risen Waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over that's Ezekiel 47: 2-5 brother bam he goes on to say here and the way that it was done was by God's perfect will and programming the Lutheran had the Holy Ghost potentially just like we were talking about the wheat had the seed potentially under justification the Methodist had it potentially under sanctification and today it is brought back a restoration the Holy Ghost is here Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die now the ideas expressed in the two words watchful and strengthen are these to watch contains not only the idea of being awake but to be alert to be otherwise insinuates danger and loss to strengthen means more than just to give strength it means to fix and establish for permanency these two commands refer to what is left of the truth which itself is ready or about to die this expression of the spirit comes before me as an illustration a group of slaves in total bondage physically and morally have risen up and escaped from their captors indeed that is what Sardis means the escaped ones they are pursued and their great and glorious gains are all but lost they have not been retaken but about all that can be said is that they have escaped but not clean escaped as some were according to the word they had lost much of their Liberties now the Lord says you are potentially back in captivity see that you don't go back to keep from going back become alert and remain ever watchful concerning the things of your captivity or you will lose all strengthen yourself now in what you have left in such a manner as to permanently establish what you have and thus ensure against future loss this will be your opportunity to fulfill what you have not fulfilled but did they go on no sir they did not heed the voice of the spirit and another age went into captivity and so God raised up others who would carry out carry out his will God bypassed the Lutheran denomination as he has all others and they will never come back God had to go on in a new age bring forth further truth and a little more restoration isn't it beautiful that's what every single Church age did restored just a little further right up until the last Church age where there's a Total Restoration Revelations 3:3 the Judgment remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know the hour which I will come upon thee I want to read another translation W of this verse be remembering therefore in what way you have received the truth as a permanent deposit and what way you heard it and be safeguarding it and have a change of mind at once I just want to point this out here the truth as a permanent deposit that is what we have brothers and sisters the truth is a permanent deposit it's not something that's given today and taken away tomorrow if we have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost if we have that desire in our hearts you are safe Saed until the day of your Redemption you're not saved today and lost tomorrow because you trip and fall this isn't about the way we live in our flesh even though our flesh follows the way that we live it's an interesting comparison Works in our lives is Faith expressed The Works that we do Express the faith that we have it's very evident brother Bram says from this verse that God had given them truth as a permanent deposit it was received and is irrevocably theirs and ours it now remains to be seen what they will do with it whether they will regard it or not I say Lord help us to regard it and that is true they had been given the basic truth of the whole gospel the just shall live by faith salvation is of the Lord they had heard the truth of the Bible which cast down the doctrines of Rome and set at not all papal Authority they knew the truth that the church does not save they understood the Lord's Supper they had light on water baptism they put out the images TR truth why there was never an age with any more men with so much light to shed they had enough illumination to completely overhaul the old system or start out fresh and let God lead them line upon line and precept upon precept they received the truth they wanted it and heard it but the question was how did they hear it how did they hear it to build upon or was it with the same attitude that many Greeks had something to discuss and theorize over evidently the rich word of Truth was being heard in an academic manner rather than for practical outworking for God was demanding a change of mind concerning it if this is the word of God which indeed it is then it must be obeyed amen failure to obey would bring judgment when the guards of the Sacred Temple were found sleeping they were beaten and their garments burned what shall the Lord do to those who in this age have relaxed their guard I will come on thee as a thief ancient sard was constantly harassed by Bandits that swooped down from the hills and pillaged the people thus they knew only too well that the spirit was saying that in the coming of the Lord is as a thief vigilance and preparation alone will suffice to be ready for his coming now we know that this is a message for the false Vine for the coming of the Lord will be as it was in the days of Noah the eight saved were well aware of the impending flood and being aware they were prepared and saved but the word the world sorry of the ungodly was swept away though they daily were in contact with the righteous and heard the truth they turned it aside until it was too late say Lord help me those completely carnal people in that ancient period type out today the nominal Christians whose lives are full of Earthly things and take pleasure in them to such extent that they have no desire for the spiritual and are not at all aware of nor ready for his appearing just makes me think about the times we get together with Believers and what's our conversations like how long does it take for us to actually get into talking about the things of the Lord or is it about the presidential election or is it about sports or is it about you name it what do we talk about when we get together is it the things of the Lord or is it the things of this world the eulogy out of Revelations 3:4 thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy my of course the word names means people as it says in Acts 1:15 concerning those in the upper room the number of names together were about 120 but to me it goes far beyond just signifying people it brings out the truth that is set forth in every age which was spok spoken to us by our Lord with great emphasis it is this the church system of these ages is made up of two Vines true and false god in his own Sovereign purpose has put them all together calling them the church see in this age how he has rebuked them saying unto the church which is not churches are in Sardis but rather lumping them together the church which is I Know Thy works you are dead your works are unfulfilled and then he goes on thou this church in Sardis has a few people in you that are right and not wrong like the majority these people walk in clean garments and they are worthy of me now these people that were the true saints of God were walking all pleasing unto the Lord their garments were clean you see in those days the garments would sweep along the road and pick up dirt and defilement and I just can't help but think you know I I heard a minister say it one time in this world that we live in it is no different spiritually speaking than it was Naturally Speaking there we cannot walk in this world and not become defiled by this world it's just the way it's set up but it's not about these garments on the outside these were watching how they walked so that they were not corrupted by the world they were in the spirit and walking in the spirit and they were holy and Without Blame before him thus they were fulfilling their purpose for that is what Ephesians 1:4 says is the purpose of God for us that we should be holy and with Without Blame before him now from this verse which shows the elect of God to be a few names you can see clearly what we have been teaching about this age it was chaotic it was unfulfilled it was split scores of ways and God rebuked it almost in its entirety my it was weak and sickly and ready to die it was not the Glorious era that carnal-minded Protestant historians have tried to make it one quick look at that tree saw it was cankered and blighted de nuded of leaf and Barren of fruit except for some deformed and wormy fruit that was fast dropping to the ground but hold a moment look closer there at the top in the light of the sun were some first fruit fruits a few names perfect in him for they were born of him filled with him and walking with him by his word thank God for those few and isn't that wonderful because that's exactly where we find ourselves not because of anything that we've done we just recognize what he's done not just at Calvary either we recognize that he sent us a Perfection to his word to tie up all of the Loose Ends that were not explained and were untied throughout all the ages so we can say that clearly the first futs a few names perfect in him how can we be perfect in this world who can be perfect in this world I know there's some people that really truly believe they're perfect in this world they look in the mirror and they think my it's just a perfect example of perfection I'm not one of them but there's people that actually literally do that and we know that's not what we're talking about we're talking about being able to perfectly receive the word that's the Perfection we're talking about when we can receive this word that makes us perfect there's no way in this world we're ever going to be perfect at sport we're never going to be perfect at music we're never going to be perfect at speech we're never going to be perfect at investing we're never going to be perfect at anything in this World there will always be someone better than what we are the only Perfection we have to look forwards to is his word inside of us that's the Perfection we're speaking of tonight and they shall walk with me that is what God says he will bestow upon them for this upright walk that is their part of their inheritance that he has reserved for them and I want to say it tonight there is an inheritance that is in heaven uncorruptible undefiled reserved there for each and every one of us who walk before him perfect in the age in which we live but he has reserved it for them if they were willing to walk with him through the toils and snares of life and be an honor to him he was going to reward them he's not forgetful of our labor of love God will always recompense us for our efforts to please him and you know brothers and sisters remember it might not be a simple exchange from one hand to the other I did something for God today tomorrow he's going to reward me it's not the way God works it's not at all the way God works God just might honor our work today two generations down the line but he does not forget our works and he's not unwilling to actually recompense us for our work Works in in a rather immediate fashion either don't get me wrong he he he comes on the scene many many times in our lives carrying on he says yes they had walked through the world and had not partaken of it they had not let the World Systems become them when the illustrious names of that age had yielded to the blandishment of the state and chosen political mindedness rather than spiritual mindedness and were on their way back back into the world these few stood for the word of God and thereby honored the Lord that's what we need to do today brothers and sisters not to get political mindedness not to get political mindedness but remember spiritual mindedness is what's going to do it amen now he would honor them in return for they shall walk with him in white they had identified themselves with him on Earth and now he would identify himself with them in the New Jerusalem how marvelous will be that identification just tremendous it makes me rejoice and yet it makes me weep to think of his condescension for you will note that he is not dressed in another color different from the Saints his Earthly leaders would so do no they are like him he is like them they are like him even as John said for they see him as he is for they are worthy do you realize who is saying this do we realize who is saying this it's Jesus the worthy one himself this is the only one who is accounted worthy to take the book out of the hand of him who sits upon the throne and now this worthy one is saying to his Saints you are worthy here is this one the only one qualified to judge and indeed all judgment is committed unto him and the words in Romans 833b God says I am righteous way translation there in the white light of God's righteousness hear the sweet voice of Jesus as he says oh my these are mine they are righteous they are worthy they shall walk with me in white my the promise to the Overcomer how are we doing for time we're doing pretty good the promise to the Overcomer Revelations 3:5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and his holy angels He that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rayment this is exactly a repetition of verse 4 wherein is made reference to the few who have not defiled their garments we used to have a saying years ago that no doubt was taken from this verse it was keep your skirts clean it meant don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved or someone might even try to involve you but stay clear of it all by steering A Chorus away from it we all have that ability in our lives the devil's going to bring us temptation but we can steer clear of it now God is going to reward those who follow this advice they are going to be clothed in white even as he is clothed in white Peter James and John saw him on Mount Transfiguration and his clothes were as white as light that is how the Saints are going to be clothed their garments will be shining exceedingly white isn't that beautiful brothers and sisters we're going to be clothed we're going to have a garment we're not going to have to try and find that garment we're not going to have to try and tailor it it's going to be given to us exactly the way it's supposed to be you know we are living in the end time it is in in this age that the churches are going to come together and as they are even now controlling World politics they will soon control the finances of the world then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy or sell you will lose it all those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world's system of church orders will be physically bereft there will be present presented to them a great temptation to give in my just take away the food just take away gas just take away the ability to pay our mortgages things could get really really tough the Temptation could be strong to give in Preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve serve God within the framework of the Antichrist Beast system we'll just keep the doors open we'll say it's okay if you need us to sign a declaration to say that you know same-sex marriage is actually appropriate according to the word of God we we're willing to just say okay to that yep just keep the doors open and uh otherwise we lose our status they take our building you know what that could happen just like that lose our status take our building but you can't touch this message he's already declared me perfect you can't take that from a real believer but preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist Beast system my goodness they will give in to the flatteries and blandishments of the hierarchy and all the people will follow these false Shepherds right into the slaughter but in the Judgment they will all be found naked yes they will not be given those white robes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in the spotted garments of the world holding your holding hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God am that is strong but it's brother and sister true as true can be there's no way that we can hold the hands with the devil anything in this world is of the devil devil the only thing that we want to do is hold to his unchanging hand I can't help but think of this story that Jesus brought he said there was a wedding Feast wasn't there and someone got in with a different garment on they never had the wedding garments and he said friend how did you get in and we know the man had nothing to say he was speechless and brother bradam I think says it maybe he came popped in through a window he he he found a way got a ladder and and and took a back door somehow worked his way into it there will be people that try and do that there's only one way one truth and one life we talked about it on Sunday we need to be justified we need to be Sanctified we need to be filled with the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ himself that's the only way we will be clothed in white that's the only way there's no other way I think it's so good that's why I keep saying it it's so easy it's such a simple formula don't get caught up and defiled in this World brothers and sisters they will not be given those white robes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in the spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God it is time to wake up and hear the voice of God crying come out of her organized religion my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues and here's the thing with that we can look at many different churches and many different people and many different denominations and you know at our level on the ground maybe just in Calgary Alberta Canada we have churches where people are fantastic people they're great citizens they truly love the Lord and they serve the Lord to the capacity of the light that they've been shown and I believe there's Believers there real genuine Believers there according to what we're going to get into here when we go a little bit further but you know brothers and sisters when we talk about that we're not saying that you can just go backwards once you've heard about this truth you can only go forwards there's no reversing there's no backing up and saying well I don't I don't think that's good enough I I I just don't think I can do it or whatever but where where I want to get to with this is to recognize that it is very important for us to recognize these people in the organized religions are good people they are not Sinners they're not terrible people there's people that are going to be in in in glory eternal life because of their actions towards the bride there's going to be people there that do that they they never were baptized they never were even saved but somehow they're going to be there in eternal life and we're going to I'm jumping way ahead of myself here but you know brother bam he says that they need to come out from her plagues and and when we look at these churches and we we look at these people we can say very easily there's no plagues I could look at that church I could look at name a couple of churches in the city I don't see any plagues and we all went through covid but that's not what he's talking about we we can look at the sins you don't want to get partakers be partakers of their sins what sins you can look at the people and say they're great people and their churches are fantastic they help the needy they they have soup kitchens they do all the things that that that help Society what he's talking about is the organized ation of religion and how we have the Harlot the Harlot out of Revelations I believe Revelations 1314 even later on Revelations 19 there's the Harlot the Scarlet colored woman the Harlot she has a bunch of daughters we could get into this and we're not going to go too far with it tonight but she had a bunch of daughters that were harlots and and and uh anyways what I'm getting at is the way these churches sign up underneath the authority of that spiritual headship causes all of those other churches even here on the ground to be partakers of the sin of the great Harlot and you know we we talked about it many times there's a a movement that happened in the states a while ago when brother Ken was still alive he played the video of it Tony Palmer he he actually said you know what the protest with Luther is over the lutherans have already signed up under the headship of Rome and they've said the protest is over we've got a brand new document which brings all of the Lutheran churches around the world under the headship of Rome and now all of the other Protestants that were present there at that meeting he said now what's what's your protest you still have a protest and we know there's no protest anymore everyone has signed up under it but we're certainly thankful that there is a few that are willing to walk with the Lord even when it gets as dark as it as it was here in Sardis even as it gets as dark as it is here today on the earth we look around and we might not see people who are partakers of of the sins but just the association under the spiritual headship does it that's why we have every single reason to Rejoice brothers and sisters when we gather together oh my sometimes alls we have is a Hallelujah but what a tremendous thing it is just to say praise our God just to give him worship from our very Souls what a tremendous thing it is here he says my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues amen God is speaking shun the religions of this world like you shun the plague leave off walking with the world and make your garments white by repentance and the blood of the Lamb but do it now for tomorrow may be too late and he that overcometh I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life once again we come to a most difficult portion of the word this is what I was referring to when I said I got into the weeds we're going to have to talk about this for a little while I know it this verse superficially regarded will be used by both Armenians and and calvinist to suit their purposes the Armenians will declare that this verse assuredly anuls John 6 37-44 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me this is the Father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day the Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith he came down from heaven just getting right into the natural of course Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not amongst yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day what a tremendous statement that must have been for them to hear who will raise them up at the last day I will raise them up my Armenian ISM makes the will of the father not a sovereign purpose but merely a complacent desire as he stands back to see what all men do with his good and gracious gifts and even life eternal the Calvinists do not see that they see in this verse strong consolation given to the suffering burdened saints that no matter how evil are the times how terrible the persecution because the Overcomer is one who believeth that Jesus is the Christ then he will not have his name removed from that book some also say that this book of life is not the Lamb's Book of Life but as usual when one regards a verse superficially he comes up with a superficial understanding and you know it just makes me think of the idea where we're sometimes looking to solve a spiritual problem with a natural solution there's no way that's ever going to happen the devil loves it when we try and do that the only way we can solve a spiritual problem is with a spiritual solution I think it's just an amazing part of the actual study of the exposition of the seven Church ages because when we recognize this what we're going to start talking about tonight it can change everything about how we believe when we really can understand it and if any of us doesn't understand it I strongly recommend seek the Lord for Revelation ask God to give you Revelation about this and if you do it earnestly he will give it he will he will not leave us in the weeds as I have said today some also say that this book of life is not the Lamb's Book of Life but as usual when one regards a verse superficially he comes up with a superficial understanding the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of God deserves more than a casual study for up until now most students have merely drawn a conclusion that God places the names of those Born Again within the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of their rebirth so for me brother Barry I don't know everyone has their own walk with the Lord I can say very clearly that in 2005 July 27th if I believed this way there would have been a recording angel in heaven and he would have been documenting brother Barry came into Calgary Living Word assembly in the upper room had an upper room experience at about maybe 7:30 8:00 in the evening and gave his heart completely to the Lord July 27th 2005 and that would be the record and now I would actually have my name put on The Book of Life but that's not what the prophet is saying here and I want to say this I want to really emphasize this that's not what God is saying through the prophet the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of God is is more than a casual study for up until now most students have merely drawn a conclusion that God places the names of those Born Again within the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of their rebirth and if for any reason that name must be removed the space on the record will simply be a blank as it was before the name had been placed there here we have these words and I'm just going to put it out there now and let us decide whose words these are this is 100% opposite to what the word actually teaches amen at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names do you remember when we read that there is no compilation of a record of names presently this was all done before the foundation of the world Amen now this takes us to another level this takes us to a place brothers and sisters where we've got to have faith and not our own faith this needs to be the faith of God living out through us our own faith will come to an end our own faith will lead us astray our own faith will actually lie to us but it's got to be his faith living out through us that we could even begin to understand begin to even speak these words and think about it how someone's name could be on the book of life before the foundation of the world brother bam says as we will point out shortly also it is not a question of Simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had an opportunity to receive eternal life wherein one group received it and had their names placed on the record while the others who refused it refused did not have their names so placed he says we will actually show by scripture that multitudes who were not even born again will go into eternal life multitudes who were not even born again one example would be the thief on the cross he didn't ask him when he got saved he didn't say what church did you attend where did you get baptized he didn't ask him any of that did you know any of the Apostles any of the disciples he didn't ask him any of that all he said to him was you'll be with me in Paradise today that's what he said to him am what a tremendous thing yes we will actually show by scripture that the multitudes were not even born again will go into eternal life as strange as this may sound it is certainly true we will also show that there is a group of people whose names having been placed on that record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstances this that's Capitals in there too cannot under any circumstances have those names removed brothers and sisters tonight I just want to say I believe that's where we are that's our position those people who have taken the the fullness of the word in our day and said be it unto me according to Thy word just like Mary did those who have received this message of the hour who have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins who have gone through justification sanctification all the way up to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the infilling the indwelling of Jesus Christ cannot under any circumstances have your name removed but we'll also show that another group whose names were on that record before the foundation of the world will have their names removed this gets heavy this takes reading and rereading and I just can't help but say I'll warn you I'm I'm actually inspired by this I'm going to preach on this now we're going to we're going to really dig into this I think it's really important to recognize it if you have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you have given your whole entire heart to Jesus Christ maybe you haven't really en enjoyed the maybe the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life maybe you can't say that I don't I just don't know for sure whether I've got the Holy Ghost if you have met all of the requirements brothers and sisters that's all you have to do is meet the requirements it's up to him to do the rest of it and alls you've got to do is stay put meeting him and the requirements the position that he's placed Us in and he will do all of it and if you have that desire you will never have your name removed it's impossible for you to have your name removed now brother Bram I've only got a couple minutes left here tonight so we'll we'll definitely dwell here for a bit I hope it's okay this is this is really important stuff to begin with there is no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the book of life I remember talking to someone once upon a time and they said no they're two separate books totally two separate books and I I I thought my that's interesting what an interesting thought two separate books there's one book that just holds the names of those people who are going to be in heaven and that's it they're the bride the elect and there's the other book with all the people that can be put on or taken off that's not what the prophet's saying here to begin with there's no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the Book of Life The Book of Life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's Book of Life or even thy book and book of the living only names are written in it Revelations 138 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him the Beast whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world Revelation 178 the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they beheld the Beast that was and is not and yet is we have Revelations 20:2 to 15 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of these things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire I remember hearing about this when I was a kid and they had a real push in in the denomination I think it was actually even through my cousins we went to a they went to a Baptist Church church when I was growing up and in the summertime they had events programs for kids and stuff and we went and we watched a a movie and I think it was the original version of Left Behind and uh they they had a lot of tracks and different things that they were really putting forward and one of them was a depiction of this the white Throne judgment and I remember as a kid being terrified looking at it and thinking that there must be a God but everyone's going to have to go and stand before the Throne of the the great judge and hopefully there's something good in our lives that's going to be enough to save us from having to go down the conveyor belt into the Lake of Fire where we're just dismissed and I remember just being absolutely terrified by it and you know having that in my life sort of in the background my whole entire life right up until that that fateful day where I actually heard the prophet's voice where I was able to hear him say it that you know know what if we judge ourselves here then we won't be judged there in fact if we truly are the Bride of Jesus Christ we our promise from the leodan church age is to sit with him in his throne we're not even going to have the perspective that everyone else in the entire world is going to have we're going to be looking out from the throne judging with the one the one who's sitting on the throne it's just just an amazing depiction I I think it's wonderful it totally changed it for me to realize of course he's not going to judge his bride she's already judged why would he want to other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book containing names in the Revelation it's called the Lamb's Book of Life or The Book of Life Now where is this book located I better call the musicians or I'll keep going I'm I'm just getting started with this I think this is so good where is this book located and this is Luke 101 17 to 24 and the 70 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject to us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and Hast revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them brother Bram he says this sentence maybe stand with me as we close the Book of Life is definitely located in heaven it's not in Rome it's not in North America it's not in South America it's not even on this Earth it's just a little bit higher than us it's in heaven in that Dimension let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this word that you've given to us Lord thank you for a a Vindicated Prophet Lord Jesus a man that would humble himself to your word Lord Jesus from an early age Lord we thank you that through that prophetic office Lord your five-fold ministry that we are able Lord Jesus to be perfected by this word and Lord Jesus thereby be able to be clothed in white be able to be that group of people that we know our names are written and they can never be removed because they weren't written with pencil and they weren't written with pen they were written with your blood before the foundation of the world father Lord I pray that this would become so real to your children father that Lord when the devil would come around and try and tempt us that we would be able to just point to that word that we would be able to point to that position that we could say in our flesh indeed there's nothing good but that soul that you placed in us before the foundation of the world Lord we thank you for that Revelation Lord we pray that tonight you would go with us father that you would help this word to become real in our lives father in such a way that we would recognize there is no way that we could ever fall we love you father and we thank you Lord I pray also that as we read these words and we recognize what's happening father that we would recognize how we have the ability to give people to impart to other humans eternal life by our actions oh Lord the gravity of Our Lives is heavy but we know it's no more than father way less even than what you had you had the sin of the entire world upon your shoulders father we have many Sinners potentially Upon Our shoulders help us to do the right thing with your word in the age in which we live father we love you and we thank you we just want to commit each word that was spoken into your hands now each and every life that's come out to hear you father maybe those who are streaming live tonight or those who would listen after father Lord Quicken this word to our souls we pray keep your hand upon each one as we go our separate ways and if
