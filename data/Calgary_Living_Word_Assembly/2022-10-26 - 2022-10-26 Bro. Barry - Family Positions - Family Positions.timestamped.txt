[35:28] father we know that Lord many times the

[37:03] now and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[37:06] amen God bless you tonight
[37:09] thank you musicians
[37:11] if you have your Bibles I'd like to read
[37:13] from Ephesians chapter 5.
[37:15] certainly like to welcome our visitor
[37:17] tonight Brother Don Snow's mother God
[37:20] bless you Sister
[37:21] ly a pleasure to have you here
[37:24] forward to maybe some fellowship
[37:26] sometime if possible
[37:29] amen Ephesians chapter 5
[37:33] we'll start with verse 21.
[37:35] I believe we're getting very familiar
[37:37] with this now
[37:38] but there's still so much more
[37:41] verse 21 of Ephesians chapter 5 says
[37:44] submitting yourselves one to another in
[37:46] the fear of God
[37:49] why submit yourselves unto your own
[37:50] husbands as unto the Lord
[37:53] the husband is the head of the wife even
[37:55] as Christ is the head of the church and
[37:57] he is the savior of the body
[38:00] therefore as the church is subject unto
[38:02] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[38:05] husbands in everything
[38:08] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[38:11] also loved the church and gave himself
[38:13] for it
[38:15] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[38:17] with the washing of the Water by the
[38:19] word
[38:20] amen that he might present it to himself
[38:22] a glorious church not having spot or
[38:25] wrinkle or any such thing
[38:28] but that it should be holy and without
[38:30] blemish
[38:31] so ought men to love their wives as
[38:34] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[38:36] loveth himself for no man ever yet hated
[38:40] his own flesh but nourisheth and
[38:42] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[38:45] church
[38:46] for we are members of his body of his
[38:48] flesh and of his bones
[38:50] for this cause shall a man leave his
[38:53] father and mother and shall be joined
[38:56] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[38:58] flesh
[39:00] this is a great mystery but I speak
[39:02] concerning Christ and the church
[39:06] nevertheless let every one of you in
[39:09] particular so love his wife even as
[39:11] himself and the wife see that she
[39:14] reverence her husband
[39:16] chapter 6 verse 1 children obey your
[39:19] parents in the Lord for this is right
[39:23] honor thy father and mother which is the
[39:25] first commandment with promise that it
[39:28] may be well with thee and thou mayest
[39:30] live long on the Earth
[39:33] and ye fathers provoke not your children
[39:35] to Wrath but bring them up in the
[39:38] nurture and admonition of the Lord
[39:41] let's just bow in prayer one more time
[39:44] our heavenly father Lord we thank you
[39:46] for your word thank you for your
[39:50] oh Lord Jesus for your grace and your
[39:52] mercy to each one of us
[39:54] Lord we just pray that you would bless
[39:56] the reading of your word now father that
[39:58] you would just break the bread of life
[40:00] open to us fresh once again we just ask
[40:02] all these things now in Jesus Christ
[40:04] made me pray amen
[40:06] bless you tonight you may be seated
[40:09] for a few minutes
[40:12] certainly hope that we can not keep us
[40:14] long here tonight
[40:16] I'd like to continue on with our
[40:19] discussion about the families
[40:22] maybe from a little bit of a different
[40:23] perspective tonight I trust it's okay if
[40:27] you could turn over into the book of
[40:28] Titus
[40:30] I'd like to read Titus Chapter 2.
[40:33] as we get going
[40:37] certainly uh
[40:40] wonderful to be in the house of the Lord
[40:45] maybe before I get going too far I'll
[40:47] just have a couple of announcements here
[40:48] we've got the Men's breakfast coming up
[40:50] on Saturday we have four brothers uh
[40:53] that are going with me and uh so that's
[40:56] a total of five people should be a
[40:58] wonderful time
[41:00] um we have a communion service Sunday
[41:02] evening
[41:03] and we have a fellowship planned for
[41:05] Monday evening as well
[41:07] but as we've been saying all along
[41:09] there's no pressure
[41:11] for any of it you have to do what you
[41:14] feel led to do
[41:15] just because we're getting together
[41:16] doesn't mean that you have to be there
[41:18] and we certainly would love to have you
[41:21] but if you're busy or you feel too much
[41:23] pressure then by all means don't don't
[41:26] feel too much pressure we just want
[41:27] everyone to be comfortable that's our
[41:30] desire
[41:31] so if anybody else desires to go to
[41:34] Edmonton for the breakfast we certainly
[41:35] have room for more it will be a bit of a
[41:38] tight ride but I think the fellowship
[41:39] would be wonderful and I think we could
[41:42] probably squeeze one or two more in our
[41:44] vehicle
[41:45] and if you desire to go by all means let
[41:49] me know we're going to leave early
[41:49] Saturday morning and come back Saturday
[41:51] afternoon
[41:52] so
[41:54] um Titus Chapter 2.
[41:57] but speak thou the things which become
[42:00] sound Doctrine
[42:02] that the Aged men be sober grave
[42:06] temperate sound in faith in charity in
[42:10] patience
[42:12] the Aged woman likewise that they be in
[42:15] Behavior as becometh Holiness not false
[42:19] accusers
[42:20] not given too much wine
[42:22] teachers of good things
[42:25] that they may teach the young women to
[42:28] be sober
[42:29] to love their husbands to love their
[42:32] children
[42:34] to be discreet chaste keepers at home
[42:37] good obedient to their own husbands that
[42:40] the word of God be not blasphemed
[42:44] young men likewise exhort to be sober
[42:47] minded
[42:49] in all things showing thyself a pattern
[42:52] of good works in Doctrine showing
[42:55] uncorruptness gravity sincerity
[43:00] sound speech that cannot be condemned
[43:03] that he that is of the contrary part may
[43:07] be ashamed having no evil thing to say
[43:11] of you
[43:12] exhort servants to be obedient unto
[43:15] their own masters and to please them
[43:18] well in all things not answering again
[43:22] not per loining but showing all good
[43:25] fidelity
[43:27] that they may Adorn the doctrine of God
[43:30] our savior in all things
[43:33] for the grace of God that bringeth
[43:35] salvation hath appeared to all men
[43:39] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[43:43] worldly lusts we should live soberly
[43:46] righteously and godly in this present
[43:49] world
[43:50] looking for that blessed hope
[43:52] and the Glorious appearing of the great
[43:54] God and our Savior Jesus Christ
[43:57] who gave himself for us that he might
[44:00] redeem us from all iniquity and purify
[44:03] unto himself a peculiar people zealous
[44:07] of good works
[44:09] these things speak and exhort and rebuke
[44:12] with all authority let no man despise
[44:15] thee
[44:16] I just thought it would be good to take
[44:19] a step back maybe and
[44:22] talk about marriages talk about the the
[44:25] importance of marriages
[44:27] as believers
[44:29] we've been talking about the family
[44:30] roles and and it's such a a wonderful
[44:33] Direction I think it's really been uh
[44:37] a learning experience for me it's opened
[44:39] my eyes to much
[44:40] about the message and and about the
[44:42] Bible and how much there really is in
[44:44] there
[44:46] um the key to it all though I'll say it
[44:49] at the beginning of the service tonight
[44:50] is just simply get the Holy Ghost
[44:52] and and I say it simply get the Holy
[44:55] Ghost it's not a simple thing the Holy
[44:57] Ghost is the deepest mystery that there
[44:59] is because we read in Ephesians tonight
[45:02] at the end of Ephesians chapter five
[45:04] Paul says I speak concerning a mystery
[45:08] I'm talking about the mystery of Christ
[45:11] and his church I'm outlining that the
[45:14] roles in the family the wife to the
[45:16] husband the husband to the wife is a
[45:18] natural occurrence and that's the way
[45:20] that we are given instruction to live
[45:22] our lives according to the word in our
[45:24] families but I'm also speaking about the
[45:28] bride and Christ that mystery the
[45:31] deepest mystery that we could ever get
[45:32] is the Christ in you the hope of glory
[45:35] thought having that god-consciousness in
[45:38] every situation of our lives in every
[45:40] conversation of Our Lives
[45:43] the Holy Ghost will lead us into all
[45:45] truth
[45:46] um you know I've got some quotes that I
[45:48] want to read tonight and and just some
[45:50] thoughts that I want to bring out
[45:52] um just maybe a little bit of a
[45:54] correction from last week I was speaking
[45:56] and and talking about the book of Titus
[45:58] and I know last week I did say that the
[46:01] word says to instruct the young men but
[46:03] it doesn't say it verbatim to instruct
[46:06] the young men it's kind of part of the
[46:08] whole picture
[46:09] to instruct the young man but it doesn't
[46:11] say it verbatim I I understand that and
[46:13] I just like to correct that it doesn't
[46:14] say it that way it says to teach the
[46:17] young women that's what the book of
[46:19] Titus says and it says to exhort the
[46:22] young man that's what it says and and
[46:24] that word exhort is an encouragement
[46:26] it's it's a direction it's it's a
[46:29] leading out of out of Strong's I I just
[46:32] wanted to look it up and make sure that
[46:33] I'm heading the right way with this I
[46:35] would never want to go the wrong way I
[46:37] would never want to say something out of
[46:38] order that might
[46:40] um cause strange thoughts like I'm
[46:42] bringing a strange Doctrine or anything
[46:44] like that I would just like to make sure
[46:46] that I'm on the word and and when we
[46:49] talk about these things that it actually
[46:50] gives us the right direction because if
[46:52] I get off on the word and I bring
[46:54] something that's not correct then it's
[46:57] not going to do the right thing and the
[46:59] right thing is to encourage us to exhort
[47:01] us so that we can actually have that
[47:04] Supernatural effect of the word so I
[47:07] just wanted to look it up you know to
[47:09] exhort out of Strong's
[47:12] g3870 the exhort word is to call near
[47:16] that is to invite
[47:17] invoke by imploration
[47:20] hortation or consolation
[47:24] beseech call for be of good Comfort
[47:27] desire give exhort and treat pray
[47:31] that's the Strong's definition of the
[47:34] word exhort and and I think it's just
[47:37] it's a beautiful thing when we can look
[47:39] at it because the the scripture here is
[47:42] is it's about encouraging it's not about
[47:44] discouraging it's not even though it
[47:47] says at the very end of it don't don't
[47:48] be worried don't be afraid to to teach
[47:52] all things to be sound Doctrine and and
[47:54] don't be worried about what men say if
[47:57] you speak this word according to the way
[47:59] it's written and let no man despise thee
[48:02] but but exhort and rebuke with all
[48:04] authority
[48:06] so I just think it's important to to
[48:08] make sure that if I'm going to speak I
[48:11] want to make sure that I'm speaking
[48:12] correctly according to the word so I
[48:14] think last week I might have implied
[48:17] that it says something that it doesn't
[48:18] say and I just want to make sure that I
[48:20] get that and you know I apologize for
[48:22] that
[48:23] um so we want to exhort the young men we
[48:26] want to teach the young women
[48:28] and personally I believe that it's it's
[48:32] it's kind of both we want to exhort the
[48:34] young women
[48:36] to teach them
[48:37] and we want to teach the young men
[48:40] by exhorting them it's kind of the same
[48:43] thing now I don't want to upset anybody
[48:46] by saying it that way but I I just feel
[48:48] like it's kind of the same thing we want
[48:51] to teach the young men we have to teach
[48:52] our children the word of God says to
[48:54] train up our children in the way they
[48:56] should go so that it will not depart
[48:58] from them so they won't depart from it
[49:00] we have to make sure that we're training
[49:02] and teaching but what better way to do
[49:04] it than to exhort
[49:06] than to encourage than to reward for
[49:10] good behavior and and maybe not reward
[49:14] for bad behavior but sometimes it can be
[49:16] easy to exhort or to teach with an Iron
[49:20] Fist and what that does is it repels and
[49:22] it pushes people away it doesn't
[49:24] encourage
[49:27] um we can come to a place where people
[49:28] can speak if we don't do it correctly we
[49:31] can speak a husband can actually speak
[49:34] to the wife and the wife will just
[49:35] completely tune the husband out doesn't
[49:37] even hear the husband's voice it's just
[49:39] maybe static maybe at best in the
[49:41] background same thing with a wife to a
[49:43] husband she can speak and and the
[49:45] husband won't even hear her it'll just
[49:47] be like a static noise it'll just be her
[49:49] again talking you'll hear something in
[49:50] the background and the reason I'm saying
[49:53] that brothers and sisters and I
[49:54] apologize
[49:55] to my wife but we got to that place in
[49:58] our marriage there was a point in time
[50:00] where it was the strangest thing we were
[50:02] sitting at the table and we had friends
[50:04] over we were having dinner and and I had
[50:06] a friend say to me Barry didn't you hear
[50:09] your wife ask you two or three times for
[50:11] it to pass please pass the butter and I
[50:14] was no completely out to lunch with it
[50:18] but you know what it was it was an
[50:19] illness that I was suffering and and I'm
[50:22] sorry to say that that's the way it was
[50:24] for us in our marriage and and the
[50:26] reason for it I'll I'll say it openly is
[50:28] because I was out of my position
[50:30] wasn't because she was out of her
[50:32] position I was out of my spot
[50:34] anyways um
[50:36] yeah we can actually if we're not doing
[50:39] things correctly if we're not doing
[50:40] things kindly if we're not doing things
[50:42] with love then we're not going to get
[50:43] the results that we want if we're not
[50:45] according to First Corinthians chapter
[50:47] 13 the statue of a perfect man in our
[50:50] lives then we're not going to get the
[50:51] results that we're looking for
[50:53] we can actually be applying all of the
[50:55] word but not have First Corinthians
[50:57] chapter 13 functioning in our actions
[51:00] and even though we've got all the word
[51:02] we've got all the Cure everything is
[51:04] right there
[51:05] it's just going to be maybe not
[51:07] encouraged and it might not be received
[51:11] you know in Titus Chapter 2 Verse 6 in
[51:13] the Amplified Bible we'll read it first
[51:16] in in it just got me thinking about this
[51:18] I'm not trying to bring a correction or
[51:20] trying to argue my point or anything
[51:22] like that it just made me look at this
[51:24] and think about it you know in in Titus
[51:26] Chapter 2 Verse 6 it says young man
[51:28] likewise exhort to be sober minded I I
[51:32] just found it interesting the word
[51:34] exhort and and so I looked at this sort
[51:36] of the Amplified Bible it says in a
[51:38] similar way urge the younger men to be
[51:41] self-restrained and to behave prudently
[51:43] taking life seriously but in a similar
[51:48] way is what it says here in the
[51:49] Amplified Bible after the instruction
[51:52] teaching the woman to behave a certain
[51:54] way in a similar way urge the younger
[51:57] men to be self-restrained and to behave
[52:00] prudently taking life seriously but you
[52:03] know in all of these things we want to
[52:05] speak and exhort and rebuke with all
[52:07] authority and let no man despisely
[52:09] because why it says verse 1 that's verse
[52:12] 15 the end of it but verse 1 says speak
[52:15] thou the things which become sound
[52:16] Doctrine we have to do that in our our
[52:19] church and we have to do that in our
[52:20] homes in our families in our
[52:22] relationships we have to do that
[52:24] we want to make sure that we're speaking
[52:25] the word of God that's the only thing
[52:27] that's going to bring results that we
[52:29] want to see as Believers the word of God
[52:31] is the only thing that's going to do it
[52:33] if we get into some self-help thing some
[52:35] marital counseling from maybe a
[52:39] denominational perspective there might
[52:41] be things that will be helpful but there
[52:42] might be things that will be detrimental
[52:44] to our marriage as well I believe
[52:46] personally with all of my heart there's
[52:48] enough information in the message of the
[52:50] hour and there's enough information in
[52:52] the word of God and if you take those
[52:53] two and you bring them before the Lord
[52:55] Jesus Christ and you say reveal unto me
[52:58] what needs to happen he's not going to
[53:01] leave us out to pasture he's not going
[53:03] to leave us wondering and guessing he's
[53:05] actually going to tell us very clearly
[53:07] because that's the God we serve that's
[53:09] how he operates
[53:11] If we're honest if we're genuine if
[53:13] we're completely surrendered unto him
[53:16] you know marriage is God's masterpiece
[53:20] that's what brother Branham said out of
[53:22] the Masterpiece in 1964 brother Branham
[53:24] says notice the Great Masterpiece of the
[53:27] family
[53:28] the husband and the wife cannot truly be
[53:31] a family unless they are one
[53:35] they have to be
[53:36] if they're not
[53:38] they're not a good family
[53:41] a wife pulling one way and the husband
[53:44] pulling another
[53:46] he says that would make an awful family
[53:49] but in agreement with love
[53:52] one to the other that's a family
[53:55] I love how he says that
[53:57] love one to another
[54:00] because in the word of God we can say
[54:02] husbands love your wives wives reverence
[54:03] your husband's end of the end of
[54:05] discussion children obey your parents
[54:06] have a nice day go home right
[54:08] here we have the prophet of God saying
[54:10] we need to love one another
[54:12] and the word of God in Ephesians before
[54:14] you get into the family roles the
[54:16] husbands the wives the children it says
[54:18] submit yourselves one to the other in
[54:20] the fear of God understanding that God
[54:23] he's the ultimate Authority
[54:26] he says that would make an awful family
[54:28] but in agreement with love one to the
[54:30] other that's a family
[54:33] now that was God's masterpiece and now
[54:36] all the true family here portrays that
[54:38] see
[54:39] and I just look at the congregation I go
[54:42] to the pr the Lord in prayer and I start
[54:44] to list off all of the families I list
[54:47] off all the people here all the children
[54:49] here and I think about the families and
[54:52] how many there are there's so many
[54:54] families here that's what the church is
[54:57] made up of is families and potential
[54:59] families there's brothers that have the
[55:01] desire to get married they're sisters
[55:03] that have the desire to get married it's
[55:05] it's in the heart of a Believer because
[55:07] that's the great mystery that that Paul
[55:09] was talking about that was God's plan
[55:11] from the very beginning was to have a
[55:13] bride of his own choosing we know
[55:14] brother Branham says that in the in the
[55:16] in the spoken word is the original seed
[55:18] that was one of the things that God had
[55:20] in his mind before the foundation of the
[55:22] world
[55:23] you know I just can't help but think
[55:25] about this this this we were even
[55:28] talking about it but you know the roles
[55:30] that we have laid out in the word of God
[55:31] here in in Ephesians and and we've
[55:33] talked about the husbands and we've
[55:35] talked about the wives and we've talked
[55:36] about the children sometimes it's really
[55:38] good just to stir up our Pure Minds by
[55:40] way of remembrance
[55:42] and and to recognize that we have a job
[55:45] description we have a role description
[55:48] you know brothers and sisters thinking
[55:49] about the families and and the family
[55:52] situations in this world
[55:56] Satan has his guns trained on the
[55:58] families if you wonder why we're talking
[56:01] about the family so strongly and so
[56:03] muchly even if that's a word so
[56:05] continuously it's because Satan wants to
[56:08] get our families Satan wants to ruin the
[56:10] marriages and because we're in a message
[56:12] Church we're not exclusive to that we
[56:14] don't have some invisible barrier around
[56:16] us that says that our marriages can
[56:18] never be affected by Satan's tactics we
[56:22] are all subject to it it's the world in
[56:24] which we live in and and if he can get
[56:26] in our minds and get us thinking
[56:28] something that's incorrect according to
[56:30] the word then what's going to happen is
[56:31] we're going to have troubles in our
[56:33] marriage and just because we say we
[56:35] believe the message of of the hour and
[56:36] and God sent a prophet that don't mean
[56:38] nothing to Satan that's why the only way
[56:41] we're going to succeed in our marriage
[56:42] or as a husband or as a wife or as a
[56:45] mother or as a father is to have the
[56:47] Holy Ghost In Our Lives then we can
[56:48] actually have the Holy Ghost water this
[56:50] word and help us understand what our job
[56:53] description is because every one of us
[56:55] have parameters we all have instructions
[56:57] but if we don't get our minds stirred up
[57:00] our our remembrance about these
[57:03] descriptions then maybe we we could
[57:04] forget a little bit you know we all have
[57:07] jobs in our lives we all have jobs that
[57:09] we need to do sometimes it's just doing
[57:12] chores at home as children sometimes
[57:14] it's going to school and being on time
[57:16] and doing our homework and and just
[57:19] being quiet and listening in class
[57:21] sometimes it's it's being a husband and
[57:24] going to work and having a job and
[57:26] providing because if we don't provide
[57:27] for our family then we're worse than an
[57:29] infidel
[57:31] we all have jobs in our lives wives
[57:35] look after the homes they look after the
[57:37] children they look after their husbands
[57:39] the children obey their parents
[57:42] all of those are descriptions call them
[57:44] job descriptions
[57:46] and and you know in life we all need
[57:49] clear job descriptions imagine what it
[57:51] was like I was thinking about this
[57:52] imagine what it was like if if we simply
[57:55] assumed that everybody just knew their
[57:58] jobs and nobody ever said you know what
[58:00] we need to do this this way and we need
[58:02] to do that that way and and if we don't
[58:04] do it the other way that we're going to
[58:05] get this result if we didn't have
[58:07] discussions about about our jobs and and
[58:09] the requirements for them
[58:12] it could be really confusing
[58:14] but there needs to be a discussion an
[58:16] understanding for employees
[58:18] as a job and the same thing from
[58:21] employers so the employers know what to
[58:24] expect from the employee
[58:26] right
[58:27] and and both of those need to happen so
[58:30] that the customers can understand what
[58:32] what what to expect from the product
[58:34] that they're going to get
[58:36] but if everyone is just assuming that
[58:38] everybody understands everything
[58:40] there's probably going to be problems
[58:42] there's probably going to be confusion
[58:43] and assumptions and and it becomes
[58:46] frustrating and and and it makes people
[58:48] angry and maybe upset
[58:51] you know when when you're looking for a
[58:53] job
[58:54] employers they post a job description
[58:58] for the job
[59:00] they say what the job entails these are
[59:02] the things that we're looking for in an
[59:04] employee for this job and they say this
[59:07] is the remuneration the number of
[59:10] dollars they're going to give for that
[59:12] position so there's a clear expectation
[59:15] this is the job this is the pay it's
[59:17] pretty clearly laid out and and it's for
[59:21] the employers so that the employees come
[59:24] into it with eyes open they understand
[59:26] what's going on the employees have a
[59:29] clear understanding of what that job
[59:30] description is
[59:32] and sometimes when we get into a job we
[59:35] find ourselves doing just a little bit
[59:37] more than what was on that description
[59:40] it's just the way it works and you know
[59:43] when we can take the scripture here in
[59:46] in Titus if anybody ever wonders I don't
[59:49] know why I guess it's just the way it
[59:50] goes if you ever wonder about is there
[59:53] any instruction about being an employee
[59:55] in the Bible take a look at what it says
[59:58] about servants because we don't have
[1:00:00] slaves we don't have servants now that's
[1:00:01] not the life that we live in
[1:00:03] but it's speaking to something greater
[1:00:06] when we're a servant we're an employee
[1:00:08] we're going to work for somebody so take
[1:00:11] a look at what this job description is
[1:00:12] in verse verse 9 of Titus Chapter 2
[1:00:15] exhort servants to be obedient unto
[1:00:18] their own masters employees
[1:00:21] be obedient unto your employer
[1:00:25] and to please them well in all things
[1:00:27] not answering again not chirping off
[1:00:30] not talking about it behind their back
[1:00:33] to other employees and the worst thing
[1:00:36] is as Believers is to have other
[1:00:38] employees chirping off about the
[1:00:40] employer because you have to stand up
[1:00:43] and say I'm not interested I don't want
[1:00:45] to hear it he's the boss he's the owner
[1:00:47] he's the one that put everything on the
[1:00:49] line so that we could have a job
[1:00:52] we don't do that we just take our money
[1:00:54] and we go exhort servants to be obedient
[1:00:57] unto their own masters and to please
[1:00:59] them well in all things not answering
[1:01:01] again not perlointing but showing all
[1:01:03] good Fidelity that they may Adorn the
[1:01:06] doctrine of God our savior in all things
[1:01:11] to be able to show the grace of God that
[1:01:13] he bringeth salvation he that bringeth
[1:01:16] salvation hath appeared to all men that
[1:01:18] there's actually a God in flesh again
[1:01:22] employers need to show employees what
[1:01:25] needs to happen and when employees
[1:01:27] understand what that description is when
[1:01:28] they have a clear understanding of the
[1:01:30] job then they can actually do the job
[1:01:33] well
[1:01:34] and they don't need to worry about what
[1:01:36] else somebody else's job description is
[1:01:38] right
[1:01:39] If an employer or somebody else in the
[1:01:41] company were to say you need to do this
[1:01:42] and you need to do that
[1:01:44] well hold on a second you can say look
[1:01:46] my my job description says this you know
[1:01:48] I I understand that you want more and I
[1:01:51] could probably do more but maybe we
[1:01:54] should have a conversation about that
[1:01:55] maybe there's a need maybe an employee
[1:01:58] had to be let go maybe times are tough
[1:02:00] and we just need everybody to to batten
[1:02:02] down the hatches as it were and and just
[1:02:04] dig in and and everybody pitches in and
[1:02:06] does that extra job
[1:02:09] but sometimes an employer can actually
[1:02:12] just add things a little bit by a little
[1:02:14] bit by little bit and eventually that
[1:02:16] employee is overwhelmed and they don't
[1:02:18] know what way to turn but there needs to
[1:02:20] be a communication there needs to be a
[1:02:22] conversation to say hold on a second I'm
[1:02:24] actually overwhelmed in this position my
[1:02:26] job description says this
[1:02:28] but you're asking me to do that
[1:02:30] it's wonderful to look at it because the
[1:02:33] job descriptions that I'm referring to
[1:02:35] Loosely calling them job descriptions
[1:02:37] God gives us he'll never give us more
[1:02:40] than we can bear and the remuneration is
[1:02:43] eternal it's Eternal it's not just
[1:02:45] getting a reward here it's actually
[1:02:47] Eternal it's getting our children to see
[1:02:50] the life of Jesus Christ in us because
[1:02:53] when the children see the life of Jesus
[1:02:54] Christ in us then they're going to want
[1:02:56] a part of it they're going to want to
[1:02:58] get that life inside of themselves but
[1:03:00] if it's just something we talk about as
[1:03:01] lip service we say we go to church we
[1:03:03] believe God said a prophet we know the
[1:03:05] message of the hour We're Christians but
[1:03:07] then we live a life that's different and
[1:03:09] the children see it
[1:03:11] it's not a congruent message is what
[1:03:13] I've been saying that's kind of my word
[1:03:14] I guess congruent it has to be congruent
[1:03:17] got to be the same people outside that
[1:03:19] we are inside same people in the church
[1:03:21] that we are at home were at work
[1:03:24] sometimes we wind up doing more than our
[1:03:26] job descriptions show and it can be
[1:03:28] helpful just to reflect on our
[1:03:29] description so that we understand what's
[1:03:31] expected of us and that's kind of what I
[1:03:34] I feel like we're doing here is just
[1:03:36] sort of reflecting on our our job
[1:03:38] descriptions when we understand what the
[1:03:39] parameters are what the word of God
[1:03:41] expects it gives us all an understanding
[1:03:43] that the husbands are supposed to love
[1:03:45] the wives we're supposed to First submit
[1:03:48] ourselves one to another in the fear of
[1:03:50] God and I believe that lines up directly
[1:03:52] with what we read already out of the
[1:03:53] Masterpiece where brother Branham said
[1:03:55] to love one another if we can love one
[1:03:58] another then we've got the basis to go
[1:04:00] forwards
[1:04:04] but there's all to all all of these
[1:04:05] types are in our relationships but I'll
[1:04:08] just say this here just just for the
[1:04:11] sake of it for the record if anybody is
[1:04:14] maybe taking it out of proportion or has
[1:04:16] it out of proportion there's no
[1:04:18] employees in a marriage
[1:04:21] none
[1:04:23] no husbands no wives
[1:04:26] none and if that's the case someone
[1:04:29] needs to maybe stop and and
[1:04:31] take a step backwards and just maybe
[1:04:33] think about it and see if it lines up
[1:04:35] with the word of God but I'm not saying
[1:04:37] there's an employee in a marriage and
[1:04:38] there better not be an employee in a
[1:04:40] marriage if there is it's not scriptural
[1:04:43] everyone is to love one another and to
[1:04:46] submit themselves one to another firstly
[1:04:49] in the fear of God to understand that
[1:04:52] when we're doing this this isn't a game
[1:04:54] that we're playing this isn't something
[1:04:55] that we're just hoping is going to turn
[1:04:57] out right and we know that it's going to
[1:04:58] turn out right it has to turn out right
[1:05:00] because it's according to God's word
[1:05:02] you know if we need to have the fear of
[1:05:06] the Lord in our lives and the Strong's
[1:05:07] word fear
[1:05:09] g5401 to be put in fear
[1:05:12] alarm or fright be afraid exceedingly
[1:05:16] fear or Terror
[1:05:18] remember Abraham he fell into a deep
[1:05:21] sleep one night and he had a deep Terror
[1:05:24] a fear a fright
[1:05:27] he had the fear of the Lord it was in a
[1:05:30] thick darkness that he fell into in his
[1:05:32] dream and we know that's where God gave
[1:05:34] him the Covenant that's where the
[1:05:35] Covenant came to him
[1:05:38] but you know we're talking about
[1:05:39] marriages we're talking about
[1:05:41] relationships tonight I feel impressed
[1:05:43] just to talk about marriages uh together
[1:05:45] in general
[1:05:47] um the families but more so the marriage
[1:05:49] we had uh marriage
[1:05:52] um banquet this summer it was it was a
[1:05:54] wonderful event and you know brother
[1:05:56] Wayne covered some things and and one of
[1:05:59] the things that just it resounds in in
[1:06:01] my heart is that in a marriage there's
[1:06:04] only a certain amount of love and and if
[1:06:07] you can Envision a vial of Love Inside
[1:06:09] the heart if if we don't treat that
[1:06:12] heart correctly that vial can break it
[1:06:16] can get broken and and the love that's
[1:06:18] inside that vial can leak out slowly
[1:06:20] over time and and if we're not careful
[1:06:23] we can find out that there's no more
[1:06:25] love in that vial and and then what is
[1:06:28] there left over
[1:06:29] you know what's interesting brother
[1:06:31] Wayne he said this that there was a
[1:06:33] counseling session between a brother and
[1:06:35] a wife and and there was a situation
[1:06:37] where she was upset because he did this
[1:06:39] and he did that and he did the other
[1:06:41] thing and then the the husband he turned
[1:06:44] and said I never did anything
[1:06:46] brother Wayne said that's your problem
[1:06:49] a marriage is just like a bank account
[1:06:51] if you're not going to put anything into
[1:06:52] it how do you ever expect to take
[1:06:54] anything out how could you ever expect
[1:06:57] to take any money out of the bank if
[1:06:58] you've never deposited anything into it
[1:07:02] and sometimes you can put a whole bunch
[1:07:04] into it at one point
[1:07:05] but then stop depositing and just
[1:07:07] withdrawing continually withdrawing
[1:07:10] eventually that bank account goes to
[1:07:12] empty and then you go into your
[1:07:13] overdraft and and you have a problem
[1:07:16] you know the greatest thing that God
[1:07:18] gave man out of thirsting for life in
[1:07:20] 1960 brother Branham says this is this
[1:07:24] is just it's so interesting because it
[1:07:26] speaks to the time in which we live in
[1:07:28] but this is even in 1960. you can
[1:07:30] imagine how far it's gone to where we're
[1:07:32] at now he says and then when we stopped
[1:07:34] upstairs
[1:07:36] and and where my room I got off
[1:07:38] he's on an elevator
[1:07:40] my you could hear up and down through
[1:07:42] here all the cigarette smoke and boiling
[1:07:45] and the dirty jokes everywhere and I
[1:07:47] started to walk up through the hall and
[1:07:49] I I heard somebody around the corner and
[1:07:52] it was too young American women both of
[1:07:55] them wearing wedding bands with just
[1:07:57] their underneath garment on
[1:07:59] here they come with a bottle of whiskey
[1:08:01] staggering over one another having a
[1:08:03] little clean fun
[1:08:05] hubby home babysitting
[1:08:08] he says that's where you get it just a
[1:08:10] little clean fun that's what we call it
[1:08:13] that's what all this is here a popular
[1:08:15] television screens and all this
[1:08:18] advertisement out here of whiskey and
[1:08:20] beer and smoking and stuff
[1:08:24] think about the advertising they had
[1:08:26] back then
[1:08:27] brother Branham says it's the Gate of
[1:08:29] Hell
[1:08:31] think about the advertising we have
[1:08:33] right now
[1:08:33] every one of us has a television in our
[1:08:35] pocket
[1:08:37] with way more information coming to it
[1:08:39] way more advertising coming to it he
[1:08:42] says it's the Gate of Hell
[1:08:44] I may sound old-fashioned but my young
[1:08:47] sister my young brother remember that is
[1:08:50] the Gate of Hell
[1:08:53] I'll tell you honestly when you start to
[1:08:55] read this and you really take it in it
[1:08:56] makes me want to just not have a phone
[1:08:59] really the prophet's saying it's the
[1:09:01] Gate of Hell you could say brother Barry
[1:09:04] he says it's a television but you know
[1:09:05] what that Vision has gone to our pockets
[1:09:07] we all know that right
[1:09:09] even televisions if you buy a television
[1:09:11] it's just like a phone it's the same
[1:09:14] technology all through it
[1:09:18] he that loves that thing shall die
[1:09:20] eternally that's true the soul that
[1:09:22] sinneth shall die the woman that lives
[1:09:24] in pleasure is dead yet while she's
[1:09:26] alive says the Bible that's the truth
[1:09:29] how the Womanhood that's sweet
[1:09:31] greatest thing God gave men outside of
[1:09:35] Salvation was a wife she was to comfort
[1:09:37] him to help him to bless him and to
[1:09:40] console him and to be a real companion
[1:09:43] to him
[1:09:44] and today
[1:09:46] it's so degraded and demoralized 1960 so
[1:09:50] degraded and demoralized till it's why
[1:09:54] the hot and thoughts of Africa could
[1:09:55] come here and teach our women how to
[1:09:57] live moral that's right
[1:10:00] goes on to say in the Africa there's a
[1:10:03] tribe of them back there that if a woman
[1:10:05] isn't married by a certain time she has
[1:10:07] to get out of the tribe and if she is
[1:10:08] married and before she is married she
[1:10:11] has to be a test for her virginity if
[1:10:14] she be found guilty she has to tell the
[1:10:16] man that's done it and they kill them
[1:10:18] both together
[1:10:21] brother Branham in 1960 here saying be a
[1:10:24] lot of killing around the United States
[1:10:25] if that took place wouldn't it
[1:10:28] think of it Heathen it's a disgrace it's
[1:10:32] a stain on that flag that our
[1:10:33] forefathers fought for they fought for
[1:10:36] the freedom of religion the the freedom
[1:10:38] to be able to go on worship according to
[1:10:40] the the way they felt led to by the
[1:10:43] Revelation that was given to them
[1:10:45] Heathen it's a disgrace it's a stain on
[1:10:47] the flag that our forefathers fought for
[1:10:49] it's a disgrace to our nation
[1:10:53] and when the Womanhood is broke and
[1:10:55] motherhood
[1:10:57] in any Nation
[1:10:59] the backbones broke
[1:11:02] God give us old-fashioned mothers again
[1:11:05] that's one of the probably the main
[1:11:07] reason the biggest reason brothers and
[1:11:09] sisters that I want to do this on
[1:11:11] Wednesday nights is to talk about this
[1:11:13] if our marriages get upset if the devil
[1:11:17] gets in and gets in our marriages and
[1:11:18] gets them all upset then then we've got
[1:11:20] a problem
[1:11:22] brother Branham says it right here if
[1:11:23] Womanhood is broke and motherhood in any
[1:11:26] Nation the backbone's broken
[1:11:28] mother give us good Lord give us good
[1:11:30] mothers
[1:11:31] you know um
[1:11:34] when motherhood's broken brother Brown
[1:11:36] I'm out of the flashing red light taking
[1:11:37] that thought motherhood's broken
[1:11:39] motherhood's broke nations are breaking
[1:11:42] now if you want to see where Jesus said
[1:11:44] that read Matthew 5 28 that's where it
[1:11:46] was at let's let's go and read Matthew 5
[1:11:49] 28.
[1:11:52] it's interesting when we look at this
[1:11:54] I'm fascinated by it myself because he's
[1:11:57] talking about Womanhood
[1:12:00] Womanhood
[1:12:06] start with verse 27.
[1:12:10] you have heard that it was said by them
[1:12:12] of old time Thou shalt not commit
[1:12:14] adultery but I say unto you that
[1:12:16] whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust
[1:12:19] after her have committed adultery with
[1:12:21] her already in his heart
[1:12:24] how is motherhood being broken
[1:12:27] the women presenting themselves in such
[1:12:29] a way
[1:12:31] but also
[1:12:32] men looking upon them
[1:12:35] and you know it's it's it's a it's a
[1:12:38] frightening thing Matthew 24 12 and
[1:12:41] because iniquity shall abound the love
[1:12:43] of many shall wax cold
[1:12:46] but he that shall endure to the end the
[1:12:49] same shall be saved
[1:12:50] it's an endurance race brothers and
[1:12:52] sisters we're running a marathon Race
[1:12:54] and it's all about making sure that we
[1:12:56] Pace ourselves properly that we make
[1:12:58] sure we have the right nutrients that we
[1:13:01] breathe right that we do everything that
[1:13:03] we're supposed to do because quitting is
[1:13:05] not an option
[1:13:07] but Satan wants to make it as convenient
[1:13:09] as possible for us to quit for us to
[1:13:11] just simply say you know I just can't
[1:13:13] stand that person anymore I don't know
[1:13:15] what's going on but I just can't live
[1:13:17] with that person anymore I want to say
[1:13:19] this very clearly because I've
[1:13:21] experienced it myself Satan wants to
[1:13:23] take the marriages even of Believers he
[1:13:26] wants to get in the marriages and he
[1:13:28] wants to destroy the marriages and why
[1:13:29] does he want to do it he wants to do it
[1:13:31] so he can devour your children
[1:13:33] he wants to get your children that's
[1:13:35] what Satan's after if he can split the
[1:13:38] parents up especially the ones who are
[1:13:40] message Believers the ones who claim to
[1:13:42] believe that God sent a prophet if he
[1:13:44] can get in there and split those up then
[1:13:46] he's actually got trophies on his wall
[1:13:48] right there because the children are
[1:13:49] going to say they never believed
[1:13:50] anything it's not real
[1:13:52] what are they doing
[1:13:54] brothers and sisters think about it
[1:13:56] Satan's coming for your children
[1:13:59] and you can choose to get together and
[1:14:01] be strong husbands and strong wives
[1:14:03] according to the word according to the
[1:14:05] job description that we've been given or
[1:14:07] we can actually become weak in the knees
[1:14:09] and say I don't know if I can do it
[1:14:12] but I guarantee you if you get the Holy
[1:14:14] Ghost in your life if you get the Holy
[1:14:16] Ghost in your marriage that you can do
[1:14:18] it and I'm not doubting for a second
[1:14:19] that nobody does somebody doesn't have
[1:14:21] the Holy Ghost in their marriage and
[1:14:23] that somebody is at the place where
[1:14:25] maybe it's a terrible situation I'm not
[1:14:27] saying that at all but what I am saying
[1:14:29] is I know that the devil is roaming back
[1:14:33] and forth like a roaring lion seeking
[1:14:35] whom he may devour and he loves to get
[1:14:38] his hands on children I come from a
[1:14:40] broken home brothers and sisters if my
[1:14:42] parents would have believed this message
[1:14:44] of the hour I probably never would have
[1:14:46] ever accepted it I ran from the
[1:14:49] Pentecostal church that we were a part
[1:14:51] of because of it because I could see
[1:14:53] that it was false it was fake how could
[1:14:56] I ever follow something that would be
[1:14:57] that way where marriage it was
[1:14:59] acceptable first of all to be divorced
[1:15:02] second of all
[1:15:04] divorce happened again
[1:15:06] it was terrible I thought there's no no
[1:15:09] goodness there's no truth in in life
[1:15:12] one of these days I'll give my full
[1:15:13] testimony but you know what I want to
[1:15:16] say this because iniquity shall abound
[1:15:18] the love of many shall wax cold and and
[1:15:21] you know when we get into looking at
[1:15:23] iniquity
[1:15:24] it's doing something that we know we
[1:15:27] shouldn't do
[1:15:28] and it's not doing something that we
[1:15:30] know we should do it's it's maybe
[1:15:32] getting on our phones brothers and
[1:15:34] looking at things that we shouldn't look
[1:15:36] at and and instead of going on our knees
[1:15:38] and praying like we should do we waste
[1:15:41] our time looking at things that we
[1:15:43] shouldn't and and maybe it's not on our
[1:15:45] phones maybe it's in other avenues doing
[1:15:46] things that we probably shouldn't do
[1:15:48] that aren't edifying to the spirit in
[1:15:50] our lives which is taking our lives away
[1:15:53] from our families taking our lives away
[1:15:55] from our prayer lives causing us to have
[1:15:57] iniquity in our hearts and when we have
[1:15:59] iniquity in our hearts guess what you
[1:16:01] might think nobody else can tell but I
[1:16:04] promise you that your family knows it
[1:16:06] they might not know what it is but they
[1:16:08] know something's wrong and when they
[1:16:10] know something's wrong that's when
[1:16:12] things start to stir up that's when the
[1:16:13] devil gets in that's when he gets in our
[1:16:15] heads that's when he makes us think
[1:16:16] she's thinking that or she said that she
[1:16:18] said something that she would say
[1:16:19] normally every single time but because
[1:16:21] she said it today and I've got iniquity
[1:16:23] in my heart I'm going to say she said it
[1:16:25] in a way that's not right
[1:16:27] and because I'm the husband she should
[1:16:29] submit to me then we go and try and pull
[1:16:32] out the job descriptions and we actually
[1:16:34] make a mess of things the only way we're
[1:16:36] going to be able to do it brothers and
[1:16:37] sisters is to make sure that we're in
[1:16:39] our positions and you know Brothers I'm
[1:16:41] just going to say it plainly Redemption
[1:16:43] only comes through the mail only
[1:16:47] gosh God didn't come down in the Garden
[1:16:49] of Eden and say Eve
[1:16:51] where are you
[1:16:52] came down and said Adam what's your
[1:16:55] problem Adam
[1:16:56] you know what your problem is but
[1:16:59] remember brothers that Adam he knew full
[1:17:02] well Eve was deceived Adam knew full
[1:17:04] well that his wife was out of order Adam
[1:17:07] knew full well that she cheated on him
[1:17:09] with another animal Adam nufo well what
[1:17:12] the implications was to redeem her but
[1:17:14] Adam still said I'm willing to give it
[1:17:16] all for my wife because she's my wife I
[1:17:21] don't care what she's done I'm going to
[1:17:23] redeem her myself
[1:17:27] to have the attitude and I'm saying this
[1:17:30] because I've heard it said Brothers say
[1:17:32] that they want to put their wives away
[1:17:33] because their wives have cheated on them
[1:17:35] maybe you've got all the Liberty in the
[1:17:38] in the world to do it according to the
[1:17:40] word but would you would you really do
[1:17:42] it what about the grace that God has
[1:17:44] bestowed upon you goodness sakes
[1:17:49] it's shocking
[1:17:52] I know in the Scripture it says
[1:17:53] somewhere that we've just forgotten
[1:17:55] about the grace for of God in our lives
[1:17:58] we've just forgotten about the the love
[1:18:00] that God has for us out of the flashing
[1:18:02] red light brother Branham goes on to say
[1:18:04] female life has been the cause and form
[1:18:07] of falling upon that sexual power that
[1:18:10] has been the ruin if you want to trace
[1:18:13] back there's some Nations that I trace
[1:18:15] back to their fall one was Egypt
[1:18:18] Assyria Rome and what more fell by the
[1:18:21] power of woman
[1:18:23] and what is it it's it's the degradation
[1:18:25] of morals
[1:18:27] that's what it is when all morality just
[1:18:29] goes out the window and it turns into
[1:18:31] sexual sin that's what the nation is as
[1:18:33] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[1:18:36] be at the coming of the son of man right
[1:18:38] that's where we live today he goes on to
[1:18:40] say notice there is nothing that God
[1:18:42] could do could there was notice there is
[1:18:45] nothing that God could give a man
[1:18:47] outside of Salvation better than a nice
[1:18:49] wife
[1:18:51] better than a nice wife
[1:18:53] there's no man can console no person can
[1:18:57] console a person when they're tired they
[1:18:59] they won't confide in anyone like they
[1:19:02] do their own wife
[1:19:03] and what a fortunate thing you brothers
[1:19:06] are
[1:19:07] when you've got a nice little wife
[1:19:09] that's clean and upright and moral and
[1:19:12] you can come in when you're tired and
[1:19:14] weary and set down and she can talk to
[1:19:17] you
[1:19:17] she can do more with you than anybody
[1:19:20] else that's right she's a jewel she's a
[1:19:23] queen you know brothers and sisters as
[1:19:25] Believers of this message of the hour I
[1:19:27] want to say this if we're not treating
[1:19:28] our wives exactly like the prophet said
[1:19:30] here then we're out of order
[1:19:32] there's something wrong
[1:19:34] something's wrong with our experience if
[1:19:37] we're not treating her like she's a
[1:19:38] jewel and we're not treating her like a
[1:19:40] queen
[1:19:41] I say Lord help me
[1:19:43] what this is for me what I'm looking at
[1:19:45] tonight brothers and sisters it seems
[1:19:47] like I'm coming heavy on the on the
[1:19:48] husbands and I don't mean to be but you
[1:19:50] know we need to look at our job
[1:19:51] descriptions we need to make sure that
[1:19:52] we understand the parameters of of where
[1:19:55] our jobs are and you know the husband's
[1:19:57] parameters are over all of it
[1:19:59] because God's not going to come and ask
[1:20:01] the wife why did your family mess up why
[1:20:03] is there a problem in your home he's
[1:20:05] gonna come and ask the husband husband
[1:20:07] what's going on just like he did with
[1:20:10] Adam but Redemption comes to the man if
[1:20:12] we've got problems in our homes Brothers
[1:20:14] It's Time to Get On Our Knees and find
[1:20:16] out what that problem is we need to be
[1:20:19] the ones doing the work to find that
[1:20:21] problem we can't be pointing the finger
[1:20:23] and saying the children or the wife or
[1:20:25] the neighbor or whatever else it's got
[1:20:26] to be ourselves looking at ourselves in
[1:20:29] the mirror saying what's going on what's
[1:20:31] the problem because clearly there's a
[1:20:33] problem someone needs to find the
[1:20:35] solution
[1:20:36] Redemption comes through the mail
[1:20:39] out of the world is falling apart
[1:20:40] brother Branham says it's just a shame
[1:20:42] that the enemy has taken our American
[1:20:44] woman and stripped them down out there
[1:20:46] on the streets and why it's a disgrace
[1:20:48] no wonder the little boys and little
[1:20:51] girls and things are in such a shape as
[1:20:54] they are today they're always trying to
[1:20:56] pattern after some woman out here in
[1:20:58] Hollywood
[1:20:59] married four or five times
[1:21:02] and what year is this 1963
[1:21:07] oh
[1:21:09] did they even have a computer then
[1:21:12] I think the Saturn V program was well
[1:21:15] underway
[1:21:16] they had what they called a super
[1:21:17] computer didn't they and it would be a
[1:21:20] room probably as big as this they would
[1:21:22] be all computers and and real tapes and
[1:21:25] all of that
[1:21:26] but now brothers and sisters we've got
[1:21:28] all of that information on a teeny
[1:21:30] little microscopic chip that fits in our
[1:21:32] pockets that's already in our phones
[1:21:35] that already influences our children
[1:21:38] that already influences the husbands
[1:21:41] that already influences the wives and
[1:21:44] it's through social media is probably
[1:21:45] the biggest opportunity for that and and
[1:21:48] through social media through news
[1:21:50] through the advertisements all of that
[1:21:53] that brother Branham just talked about
[1:21:55] is just streaming it's no wonder they
[1:21:57] call it streaming it's streaming right
[1:21:59] into our minds and if we're not careful
[1:22:03] we can pattern ourselves we can begin to
[1:22:06] pattern ourselves brothers and sisters
[1:22:08] what we need to be doing is streaming
[1:22:10] the word of God streaming the message of
[1:22:12] the hour into our lives into our homes
[1:22:14] and continually doing that making sure
[1:22:17] that that's what we're streaming and
[1:22:19] what we're doing brother Branham goes on
[1:22:21] to say and she'll come out with some
[1:22:23] sort of a nude clothes on and all the
[1:22:24] little girls in the country will pattern
[1:22:26] after that what a Pity that's too bad
[1:22:28] yes sir it's too bad and it's got into
[1:22:31] the church I just want to say this you
[1:22:33] know we look at it and he's talking
[1:22:34] about Hollywood and the picture show
[1:22:36] that you would have to go and spend
[1:22:37] money and go down and buy a ticket and
[1:22:39] go and sit there and watch and then
[1:22:41] actually maybe a television two or three
[1:22:44] channels in your house but here we are
[1:22:46] now with what they call influencers
[1:22:48] Right YouTube influencers Facebook
[1:22:50] influencers Tick Tock is probably the
[1:22:53] biggest one all of that is influence of
[1:22:55] the devil that wants to get into your
[1:22:57] children's Minds get into your husband's
[1:23:00] Minds get into your wives mind it's the
[1:23:02] devil it's not something good and
[1:23:04] wholesome brothers and sisters she'll
[1:23:06] come out with some sort of new clothes
[1:23:07] on and all the little girls in the
[1:23:09] country will pattern after that
[1:23:11] once upon a time it was a movie star now
[1:23:13] it's influencers now it's it's all of
[1:23:15] this that we just talked about he goes
[1:23:17] on to say the beautiful virtue that God
[1:23:19] gave a woman to be a mother has been
[1:23:21] marred and that's the backbone of the
[1:23:23] nation you break the motherhood and
[1:23:25] you've broke the nation right then
[1:23:26] that's the one thing that helps hold it
[1:23:29] together real genuine Parenthood and how
[1:23:31] do you get Parenthood he doesn't say
[1:23:34] real genuine motherhood he says real
[1:23:36] genuine Parenthood anybody can just
[1:23:39] almost anybody could be
[1:23:42] a father
[1:23:44] but to be to be a dad someone could
[1:23:47] actually have a child but to be able to
[1:23:50] actually be a father to be that
[1:23:52] influence to be that parent it's a
[1:23:54] totally different thing it's not
[1:23:56] something that's just for the faint of
[1:23:58] heart it's a lifelong commitment and and
[1:24:01] as Sons and Daughters of God we've been
[1:24:03] given all the tools I think that we need
[1:24:05] to be able to succeed in the position
[1:24:07] but I I just think it's amazing to look
[1:24:09] at it
[1:24:10] the devil is coming for us he wants our
[1:24:13] children but I'm just so glad that we
[1:24:16] can all just Rejoice that he can't have
[1:24:18] him
[1:24:19] he can't have them because the prophet
[1:24:21] said we can apply the token to our
[1:24:23] families
[1:24:24] not just to our homes not just to our
[1:24:27] own lives and say that we're okay we can
[1:24:29] apply the token to our very families and
[1:24:32] because the word of God it says it in in
[1:24:34] a is it Ephesians yeah even while we
[1:24:37] were yet dead in sins and trespasses
[1:24:40] right he hath quickened us so he doesn't
[1:24:43] come for us when we're the most polished
[1:24:45] cleaned up individuals that have been
[1:24:47] going to church for a few weeks and
[1:24:49] that's when we can actually be saved no
[1:24:51] no he doesn't Quicken us then we have
[1:24:54] the ability to apply that token to our
[1:24:55] children to our homes and Satan can't
[1:24:58] have them I I just think it's beautiful
[1:25:00] thought to recognize that we have a job
[1:25:03] description we have parameters for our
[1:25:06] lives we've gone over them and over them
[1:25:07] and I know I could be saying more about
[1:25:09] that I think it's probably a discussion
[1:25:11] maybe for a later time
[1:25:13] just for the sake of time I don't want
[1:25:15] to go too far into it but we we know
[1:25:18] that the husbands are supposed to love
[1:25:20] their wives and the wives are supposed
[1:25:21] to reverence their husbands and the
[1:25:23] children are supposed to obey the
[1:25:24] parents
[1:25:26] because that's right in the Lord
[1:25:29] but
[1:25:30] if the devil can get into our lives
[1:25:33] and mix us up
[1:25:35] then he can cause us to maybe doubt and
[1:25:37] maybe question
[1:25:39] and that's exactly what he did from the
[1:25:41] very beginning Satan got in the Garden
[1:25:42] of Eden and he said to Eve everything
[1:25:44] was built this way God created you this
[1:25:47] way Eve so that you could actually bring
[1:25:49] to pass the word of God
[1:25:51] and and she was truly deceived into it
[1:25:54] but remember we've said it Adam wasn't
[1:25:57] she was deceived to believe that she was
[1:26:00] doing good when she actually was sinning
[1:26:03] and that's what deceit is is thinking
[1:26:05] that we're doing things right
[1:26:07] but we're still not quite doing it a
[1:26:10] hundred percent right and one percent
[1:26:12] not right is it's wrong
[1:26:15] one word off is Satan's kingdom we've
[1:26:17] heard that said so many times we can
[1:26:20] have the whole word of God we can have
[1:26:21] the Cure we can have the entire word of
[1:26:24] God we can have all the message of the
[1:26:26] hour
[1:26:27] we can say that God sent a prophet we
[1:26:29] can go to church all the time we can
[1:26:31] tithe we can be faithful in every single
[1:26:34] thing but if we're off in the way that
[1:26:36] we treat our families brothers and
[1:26:39] sisters we're not going to see the
[1:26:40] results we're looking for we're not
[1:26:42] going to have the the marriage that
[1:26:44] we're after I'm not trying to give us
[1:26:46] the self-help thing other than there's a
[1:26:49] possibility that if like brother Wayne
[1:26:51] said if we're going to be married
[1:26:52] brothers and sisters why not be happily
[1:26:54] married
[1:26:55] why not have the joy of the Lord in our
[1:26:58] marriage why not be happy to come home
[1:27:01] and to see our wives why not be happy
[1:27:03] that our husbands are coming home to see
[1:27:06] them
[1:27:07] if we're not in that position if that's
[1:27:09] not the way it's going on then something
[1:27:11] is out of kilter and I want to say
[1:27:13] there's a cure for that in the word of
[1:27:15] God
[1:27:16] it's not in some psychological realm
[1:27:19] some doctor somewhere that's going to
[1:27:21] prescribe something so he's going to
[1:27:23] give you the the checklist of things
[1:27:26] that you need to do to have a better
[1:27:28] life it's actually the word of God it's
[1:27:30] understanding what his job description
[1:27:32] is for us in our positions
[1:27:36] you know I'm
[1:27:37] fixing to close here
[1:27:39] just like brother Branham says out of
[1:27:41] the masterpiece
[1:27:43] in just about five minutes or ten
[1:27:46] and I'd say probably 12.
[1:27:49] I'm fixing to close here he says notice
[1:27:51] the Great Masterpiece of the family the
[1:27:53] husband and the wife cannot truly be a
[1:27:55] family unless they're one
[1:27:57] they have to be if they're not they're
[1:28:00] not a good family
[1:28:01] and I would say this I'm not saying this
[1:28:04] is what the prophet said this is what
[1:28:05] I'm said I'm sad that's not good English
[1:28:08] but you know what I mean right
[1:28:11] um
[1:28:12] they're not a good family I want to say
[1:28:14] this they're not a healthy family
[1:28:16] they're a sick family
[1:28:18] and you know what there's a cure for it
[1:28:20] and it has to be applied the right way
[1:28:22] we can go and get a medication from a
[1:28:24] doctor for an illness
[1:28:26] and we can have the Cure right in our
[1:28:28] very hands
[1:28:30] there's the Cure maybe it's a bottle of
[1:28:32] pills whatever you want to call it it's
[1:28:34] a vial of something we can drink we have
[1:28:35] the whole cure right here but if we
[1:28:37] drink it all at one time
[1:28:40] it could kill us
[1:28:42] if we don't drink it at the right time
[1:28:44] or or don't do it according to what the
[1:28:46] prescription says it's going to hurt us
[1:28:48] it's not going to help us we can take
[1:28:50] the word of God and do the same things
[1:28:52] brothers and sisters it's got to be the
[1:28:54] way it's prescribed to us we've got to
[1:28:56] apply it the way that the word says to
[1:28:59] brother Bradham says they have to be
[1:29:02] if they're not they're not a good family
[1:29:04] wife pulling One Way husband the other
[1:29:06] that'll make an awful family
[1:29:09] but in agreement with love one to the
[1:29:11] other
[1:29:13] that's a family
[1:29:15] he goes on to say and now that was God's
[1:29:18] Masterpiece and all the true family here
[1:29:21] portrays that see and now the
[1:29:23] Masterpiece family has come again
[1:29:27] this is where we live brothers and
[1:29:28] sisters Christ and his bride ready to
[1:29:31] come second Adam second Eve ready now to
[1:29:34] return back to their home
[1:29:36] the whole picture has been Redemption
[1:29:38] from where it was bringing it back see
[1:29:40] just exactly bringing it back again and
[1:29:43] this is the part that Thrills me with
[1:29:45] this whole study because we can look at
[1:29:46] it naturally and talk about the husband
[1:29:48] and the wife and the children but we all
[1:29:50] fit those descriptions because we're all
[1:29:53] the Bride of Jesus Christ and we're all
[1:29:55] Sons and Daughters of the most high God
[1:29:57] maybe we're not all husbands but that's
[1:30:00] okay we don't all have to be husbands
[1:30:02] but this is what we're talking about
[1:30:04] this great mystery that Paul was talking
[1:30:06] about in Ephesians is is Christ in you
[1:30:09] the hope of glory it's really
[1:30:11] understanding that we are the Bride of
[1:30:14] Jesus Christ and we have been given a
[1:30:16] very specific role description in the
[1:30:19] word of God and even according to the
[1:30:21] message of the hour the one who is
[1:30:23] actually the jewel the one who is
[1:30:25] actually the queen imagine that that's
[1:30:27] the way God sees us even in the midst of
[1:30:29] all of our Humanity what a tremendous
[1:30:32] thing
[1:30:33] remember that Redemption always comes
[1:30:35] from the male
[1:30:37] even when maybe this flesh just doesn't
[1:30:40] feel like it maybe even just when our
[1:30:43] spirit doesn't feel like it remember the
[1:30:45] word of God says to not let a root of
[1:30:47] bitterness husbands
[1:30:49] to get in there if a root of bitterness
[1:30:51] gets in that Redemption isn't going to
[1:30:54] come and it takes I want to say this and
[1:30:56] maybe it sounds crazy but it takes a lot
[1:30:59] of courage to set aside all of your
[1:31:01] humanity and all of your feelings and
[1:31:04] emotions and Wade through and say I know
[1:31:07] that even though maybe I feel like I'm
[1:31:09] right and I know that I'm right and
[1:31:11] she's wrong
[1:31:12] I'm gonna be Redemption for her I'm
[1:31:15] gonna be Redemption for my children I'm
[1:31:18] going to be Redemption for my entire
[1:31:20] family because that's the way God set
[1:31:23] things up imagine if he said oh I can't
[1:31:27] believe that they were going to behave
[1:31:28] that way I knew they were going to
[1:31:29] behave that way so I'll just strike them
[1:31:30] all off the Record forget about them
[1:31:33] imagine if Jesus spoke when they put the
[1:31:35] bag over his head and they smote him on
[1:31:37] the head and said speak and prophesy and
[1:31:39] say who it was that hit you or imagine
[1:31:41] if he actually shouted out and said this
[1:31:44] is just more than I can bear forget
[1:31:45] about all those people that live in the
[1:31:47] age of laodicea forget about them you're
[1:31:49] not putting that crown of thorns on my
[1:31:51] head imagine if he just didn't actually
[1:31:53] after he stumbled and fell bearing the
[1:31:56] cross walking up the street with bloody
[1:31:58] Footprints thinking that I'm just going
[1:32:00] to pick up that cross and go all the way
[1:32:02] with it because nobody else in this
[1:32:04] world is ever going to be able to
[1:32:06] imagine if he didn't do that imagine if
[1:32:09] he just snapped his fingers and called
[1:32:11] the legions of angels when he was tied
[1:32:13] to that whipping post imagine back in
[1:32:15] the garden he said oh the disciples all
[1:32:17] they do is sleep why on Earth would I be
[1:32:19] the Redemption for them
[1:32:21] because that was his plan all along and
[1:32:24] you know I just think it's so beautiful
[1:32:25] it's so fascinating to recognize that
[1:32:28] the Redemption comes to the husband the
[1:32:30] Redemption comes through the Dead the
[1:32:32] Redemption comes from the Lord Adam
[1:32:35] brought Redemption to Eve and he knew
[1:32:37] the full cost of it he knew what was
[1:32:40] going to happen he knew that meant death
[1:32:42] because that's what God said because
[1:32:43] remember God didn't tell Eve
[1:32:46] that if you eat off that tree that you
[1:32:48] shall surely die he said it to Adam
[1:32:51] when she was in him
[1:32:54] when they were still one he said it to
[1:32:56] Adam
[1:32:57] Abraham brought Redemption to Sarah
[1:33:01] she tried to do it her own way
[1:33:03] she tried to say take Hagar we'll make
[1:33:06] this promise come to pass don't worry
[1:33:07] God's probably did sleep and he's not
[1:33:09] going to make it happen we'll just make
[1:33:11] this happen don't worry about it and
[1:33:12] what happened made a mess
[1:33:14] we can still see it today Boaz brought
[1:33:18] Redemption to Ruth
[1:33:20] the male brings Redemption to the female
[1:33:23] Brothers
[1:33:25] ahazirus brought Redemption to Esther
[1:33:29] the female doesn't bring Redemption to
[1:33:31] the man
[1:33:32] the female stands and loves her husband
[1:33:35] reverences her husband submits herself
[1:33:37] to her husband waiting for the husband
[1:33:39] to bring Redemption to the wife
[1:33:42] David brought Redemption to Abigail
[1:33:45] Jesus Christ he brought Redemption to
[1:33:47] his bride
[1:33:48] how much more brothers and sisters do we
[1:33:51] ought to bring Redemption to our homes
[1:33:55] when we can see things going wrong do we
[1:33:57] get upset and point the fingers or do we
[1:33:59] get on our knees and pray do we embrace
[1:34:01] our family and love them do we display
[1:34:04] First Corinthians chapter 13 charity
[1:34:07] Divine love the Capstone Ministry that
[1:34:10] we so love the message of the hour do we
[1:34:13] live it or do we just preach it it's got
[1:34:16] to be lived brothers and sisters if
[1:34:18] we're just preaching it Satan knows it
[1:34:20] and he's going to come around he's going
[1:34:21] to get in your marriage and he's going
[1:34:23] to try and get your children but you
[1:34:25] know we have the opportunity to be the
[1:34:26] Shepherds of our own flocks to be the
[1:34:28] Shepherds of our homes and what does
[1:34:30] brother Bradham say when he describes
[1:34:31] the shepherd the shepherd all of the
[1:34:33] animals all the animals can go out and
[1:34:35] live in the field but those sheep
[1:34:37] they're the ones that come back at night
[1:34:39] and they go into the Sheepfold and what
[1:34:41] happens the shepherd lays down in the
[1:34:43] doorway of that Sheepfold the shepherd
[1:34:46] smells like those sheep the shepherd is
[1:34:48] the one that guards those sheep to make
[1:34:50] sure ain't no wolves getting in here
[1:34:51] ain't no thieves breaking through to try
[1:34:53] and steal these sheep and ain't no devil
[1:34:55] getting in to steal my children no way
[1:34:57] brothers and sisters we have that
[1:34:59] responsibility to make sure that we're
[1:35:01] guarding our families that way that
[1:35:03] regarding our wives our Jewels our
[1:35:05] queens that way
[1:35:07] we've got to be doing that
[1:35:10] how much more now
[1:35:12] than 1960 when brother Branham was
[1:35:14] talking about that the picture shows the
[1:35:16] movies and the and and the TV when
[1:35:18] there's maybe two channels to watch how
[1:35:21] much more with the information Super
[1:35:23] Highway you know what Satan's not going
[1:35:25] to come to our houses brothers and
[1:35:26] sisters as a roaring lion knocking on
[1:35:29] the door or or pawing at the door
[1:35:31] scratching our screen door to bits he's
[1:35:33] not going to do that he's going to come
[1:35:34] through the devices into our homes he's
[1:35:37] going to come and and get into our wives
[1:35:40] Minds through the things that she
[1:35:42] watches to the people that she listens
[1:35:44] to he's going to try and do everything
[1:35:47] that he can to upset the families he's
[1:35:49] going to try and do everything that he
[1:35:51] can to upset the church but you know one
[1:35:53] thing I can say on a Wednesday evening
[1:35:55] we can look at this and we can say
[1:35:57] praise be to God because he's coming
[1:35:59] he's tried to upset the church but we've
[1:36:02] stuck together we have to endure
[1:36:04] brothers and sisters the same thing in
[1:36:06] our marriage we've got to be willing to
[1:36:08] fight for our children we've got to
[1:36:10] fight for our our marriage it's not
[1:36:12] something that it's just given to us for
[1:36:14] free even though God did give it to us
[1:36:16] it's up to us what we do with it because
[1:36:18] one day Brothers we're going to answer
[1:36:20] for it we're going to stand before God
[1:36:22] and he's going to say Well done thou
[1:36:24] good and faithful servant enter ye into
[1:36:26] the joys of the Lord or he's going to
[1:36:28] say why did you do that I gave you all
[1:36:31] those talents I gave you so many
[1:36:32] warnings I gave you so many
[1:36:33] encouragements all these things we gave
[1:36:36] you over and over and over again all
[1:36:37] these things to help you and you just
[1:36:39] rejected it
[1:36:42] we're gonna answer
[1:36:45] devil wants to get inside your marriage
[1:36:48] if there's one marriage he wants to
[1:36:50] upset he wants to mess with every single
[1:36:52] marriage we know that he's trying to
[1:36:53] redefine the definition of marriage but
[1:36:55] if there's one marriage he wants to get
[1:36:56] inside brothers and sisters it's the
[1:36:58] people who claim to believe the word of
[1:37:00] God for their day because I promise you
[1:37:02] he doesn't believe that you believe
[1:37:03] Satan does not believe that you believe
[1:37:06] Satan did not believe that Jesus
[1:37:08] believed because if he believed that
[1:37:10] Jesus believed he never would have put
[1:37:12] him on a cross and that's why you have
[1:37:14] pressure in your marriage brothers and
[1:37:15] sisters because Satan wants to get you
[1:37:18] he doesn't believe that you're a
[1:37:20] Believer he doesn't believe that you're
[1:37:21] a son or daughter of God but you know
[1:37:23] what when you actually take this word
[1:37:24] and apply it then you will be able to
[1:37:26] prove that you are a son and daughter of
[1:37:28] God you will be able to prove that Satan
[1:37:30] has no power over you or your wife or
[1:37:32] your children there will be no way for
[1:37:35] him to get in and mess with you
[1:37:37] and even if he does
[1:37:39] because he will even if he does you're
[1:37:43] going to be able to take the word and
[1:37:44] apply the word
[1:37:46] you're going to be able to come together
[1:37:47] in love and and reason together and say
[1:37:50] let's just let's just get together and
[1:37:52] reason around the word and go on our
[1:37:53] knees together and pray and you know
[1:37:55] what we'll cast Satan out we'll get him
[1:37:57] out because he's not allowed to stay he
[1:38:00] can't stay the word of God says to
[1:38:02] submit yourselves therefore unto God
[1:38:04] then resist the devil and he will flee
[1:38:06] from you
[1:38:09] Redemption comes through the mail it's
[1:38:11] up to the husbands to make sure that
[1:38:13] this is working that this is happening
[1:38:15] and you know uh an iron fist with the
[1:38:18] Cure
[1:38:19] taking the word of God with an iron fist
[1:38:21] that's not going to work
[1:38:23] we've got to display love love is the
[1:38:25] only thing brother Branham says it very
[1:38:27] clearly for a purpose brothers and
[1:38:28] sisters love is the strongest force in
[1:38:31] the universe
[1:38:32] if we want to see our marriages fixed if
[1:38:35] we need to there's only one thing that's
[1:38:37] going to do it it's not it's not saying
[1:38:39] the word of God says you need to do this
[1:38:40] and you better get in line
[1:38:42] that's going to be that static we were
[1:38:44] talking about earlier our wives are just
[1:38:45] going to be like
[1:38:46] tune us out
[1:38:49] right
[1:38:50] but if we come to her and we grab her by
[1:38:52] the hand and we tell her honey I love
[1:38:53] you and I love you and I love you and I
[1:38:56] want to keep you and I want to encourage
[1:38:58] you I want to see you as my queen maybe
[1:39:01] I haven't treated you that well maybe I
[1:39:03] haven't been that way I know how God has
[1:39:05] been to me I know he's taken my hand
[1:39:07] when I've been a sinner when I was yet
[1:39:10] dead in sin and trespass and he came
[1:39:12] around and told me that you are not who
[1:39:14] you think you are you are my sinless
[1:39:16] spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ
[1:39:18] you're the one that I want to take for
[1:39:21] eternity to be my bride so honey I love
[1:39:24] you and I want you to be my bride and
[1:39:26] whatever I need to do to fix it I want
[1:39:28] to do that I want to fix it brothers and
[1:39:30] sisters There's Hope if we need hope and
[1:39:32] that hope is only going to come through
[1:39:34] Divine love that's all no other way by
[1:39:38] trying to take the word and slam it down
[1:39:39] is only going to push it farther apart I
[1:39:42] can promise you maybe stand with me
[1:39:44] tonight I'll call the musicians you know
[1:39:46] what brothers and sisters what is
[1:39:48] redemption it's love love love covers a
[1:39:51] multitude of sin First Corinthians
[1:39:54] chapter 13.
[1:39:56] Satan wants to destroy us Satan's coming
[1:39:59] for our marriages Satan's coming for our
[1:40:02] children and we have the opportunity to
[1:40:05] actually gather together and surround
[1:40:08] batten down the hatches as it were
[1:40:11] or maybe straighten up our ties and and
[1:40:15] and and flick our lapels and say that
[1:40:17] we're just a little bit self-righteous
[1:40:18] and we can just take the word and stand
[1:40:20] in our position and say you know what
[1:40:22] it's just going to be the way it's going
[1:40:23] to be
[1:40:25] we don't I don't think any one of us
[1:40:28] wants to be that way I I'm sorry I I
[1:40:30] don't even know what I'm talking the way
[1:40:32] I am I just know that Satan's coming for
[1:40:34] marriages brothers and sisters and I
[1:40:36] want to plead with us tonight to just
[1:40:38] take the word and apply the word the way
[1:40:40] the word says to the way the prophet
[1:40:42] says to not according to some tradition
[1:40:45] or or something that makes us feel like
[1:40:47] we're in a position that puts us
[1:40:49] somewhere that we're not all of us are
[1:40:52] sinners saved by grace it's only by
[1:40:55] grace that we're saved through faith
[1:40:57] lest any man should boast
[1:40:59] oh my let's just go to him in prayer
[1:41:01] gracious Heavenly Father tonight Lord we
[1:41:04] just thank you for your goodness unto us
[1:41:06] Lord father I pray Lord Jesus for a
[1:41:09] special measure of Grace father for our
[1:41:12] families Lord Jesus for our marriages
[1:41:15] Lord I know that Satan is roaming about
[1:41:17] like a roaring lion he wants to devour
[1:41:20] our children and he wants to devour our
[1:41:22] marriages Lord he wants us as Believers
[1:41:25] of this message to redefine the the
[1:41:29] definition of marriage but Lord Jesus
[1:41:31] tonight I pray that we could just go
[1:41:34] right back to the very beginning and
[1:41:35] recognize that you put us together from
[1:41:38] before the foundation of the world Lord
[1:41:40] Jesus and Lord you can yourself to make
[1:41:43] sure that when when it was going to
[1:41:45] happen Lord Jesus that it would be you
[1:41:47] doing it and father you took us from
[1:41:49] your side just like you took Eve from
[1:41:52] Adam's side you took us from your side
[1:41:54] at Calvary and you said oh just rest
[1:41:57] little bride rest all is well you don't
[1:42:00] have to worry about a thing because I've
[1:42:02] done it all and then you went right down
[1:42:04] to Hell and you took the keys of death
[1:42:06] and Hell from Satan right off of his
[1:42:09] belt
[1:42:10] oh Lord Jesus and then you took and you
[1:42:12] led mankind oh father from the regions
[1:42:15] of the lost from Paradise father from
[1:42:18] everywhere they were locked up Lord
[1:42:19] Jesus you took them and you led them oh
[1:42:22] Father when you gave gifts unto men
[1:42:24] father we pray that we could just see
[1:42:26] that that happen in our lives Lord Jesus
[1:42:28] that we wouldn't look to the Rapture as
[1:42:30] an event Lord Jesus but that we would
[1:42:32] look at it as a as An Occurrence every
[1:42:35] single day in our lives father that we
[1:42:37] would see it as An Occurrence every day
[1:42:39] in our marriages Lord Jesus father with
[1:42:42] our children and our husbands and wives
[1:42:44] we would see the Rapture happening every
[1:42:46] day father as we go closer unto you
[1:42:49] father we just love you and we thank you
[1:42:51] we pray Lord Jesus that you would help
[1:42:53] us Lord to draw closer unto you father
[1:42:55] Lord to not think that any one of us has
[1:42:58] a special position Lord Jesus father
[1:43:01] help us all to recognize that each one
[1:43:03] of us is a sinner saved by grace father
[1:43:06] we love you we thank you we ask all
[1:43:08] these things now in Jesus Christ's name
