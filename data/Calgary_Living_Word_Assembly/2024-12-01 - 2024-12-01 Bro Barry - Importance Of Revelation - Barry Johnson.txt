what a wonderful thing it is to be able to come unto you with our needs there're many Lord Jesus and we just commit each need Lord Jesus unto you now in the name of Jesus Christ father we just thank you for all of the rest of the needs that that you've met in our lives the provisions that you've made father financially Lord in relationships in our minds father for healing our souls Lord we we could just go on and on father for the many blessings that you've done for us Lord that you've given us now father this morning we just want to commit this little time that we have together into your

with them Father amen and keep them we love you and we thank you you we ask all these things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray am amen amen amen God bless you this morning thank you musicians if you have your Bibles this morning I'd like to read from John chapter 6 it's kind of an interesting scripture I guess um the direction that I I felt led to go we'll just see what the Lord will do sometimes I get confused and I know it's obvious but I uh it's tough to understand what the Lord wants to do we just want to trust him and and step forward according to what he leads so in John chapter 6 verse 25 a very familiar story as a starting place for us today and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi when camest thou hither Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you you seek me not because ye saw the Miracles but because ye did eat of the Loaves and were filled amen labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed let's just bow in prayer one more time Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you have given us bread to eat father that we could be filled and Lord that we know as Believers of this word that we don't labor for the things of this world but we labor for that Revelation father that word that you have given given us and father I believe that's why the building has all of your children in it today so that Lord Jesus we could be filled with that meat that we could be filled with that bread Lord that father our spiritual appetites would be satisfied father that we would have sustenance that would carry us through until the next time father until you feed us again Lord Jesus our desire is to be ready and ready and waiting and watching for that hour because we know Lord Jesus not what time you will come you will come upon this world as a thief in the night and there will be a secret sudden going away of your bride father help us to be ready for that time we just want to commit all the words that are spoken Lord each one who is here today gathered together in your name amen father we want to commit them unto you now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you this morning you may be seated good to see brother Willie Again God bless you brother we uh certainly thankful to be here today amen just a few announcements we have a prayer meeting coming up on the 5th which is Thursday we have brother GIF maruu here on Sunday from he is formerly from Saskatoon Tabernacle and uh he's visiting Canada again which is wonderful so we'll have a wonderful time of fellowship with him next Sunday Lord willing then on the 15th we'll have the Youth Event at the colossum and then uh on the 31st we'll have a communion service coming up communion SL testimony service not necessarily a watch Night Service um we'll just give the Spirit Room to move and see what happens if we're able to uh last until midnight then so be it but if we're not then that's just fine also I know some people have plans that they're going to travel or go do things and we certainly wish God's richest blessings upon you and we trust that the Lord will allow us if it's his will to have another prosperous year in his word in 2025 are you happy this morning today I want to talk about the importance of Revelation and uh I just think it's a wonderful story here talking about the uh the feeding of the multitudes and we we know this story is is very very familiar how um Jesus fed the people with this bread and maybe we can just go back a little bit in uh in the story here amen bear with me for a second there we go let's just go back in uh John chapter chapter 6 we know that the the people were there and maybe we'll just start reading with verse six of John verse one of chapter 6 in John see I wasn't lying I get confused sometimes it happens pretty easy John chapter 6 verse1 after these things Jesus Went Over the Sea of Galilee which is the Sea of Tiberius and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles and I like the way this is written here it says which he did on them he didn't just do he did them on them that were diseased and Jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples and the Passover a feast of the Jews was nigh when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto Phillip When shall we buy bread that these may eat just a a neat little story here and and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do Philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little one of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother saith unto him there is a lad here which hath five barley Loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many and Jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about 5,000 and remember he just mentions the men he doesn't mention the women nor the children and it wasn't just a men's meeting you can assume it was everyone right so how many people were there I don't think it was just 5,000 and Jesus Took the Loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would as much as they would they could just keep on eating and eating until they were done there was no limits to how much they could eat it was an all you can eat if you will when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost now therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that that had eaten then those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that Prophet should come into the world when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone now I'm just going to pause there and hopefully I don't make this so confusing for everyone um I just love this story bear with me here I want to bring up a quote from the church age book the importance of Revelation and we're not talking about the Book of Revelations although that's a a really good story a really good uh book of symbols a really good book to understand according to the the revelation of the messenger for our age out of the exposition of the seven Church ages brother bradam says the importance of Revelation by the spirit not just Revelation but Revelation by the spirit to the True Believer can never be overemphasized there Never Comes A Place In Time brothers and sisters where we're just revelated we're just got it and that's all it's a continual unfolding because brother badam says here no I I'll say it this way like I always do rather God says it through the prophet Revelation not to the unbeliever or the makeb believer he says it to the True Believer Revelation to the True Believer so this is someone who is actually saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost otherwise they wouldn't be a True Believer now would they but here we have Revelation the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelations Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize and I just felt led to get into this discussion today because you know I I I said it a little bit earlier we we can never be over revelated there's there's I believe two things that we will never be able to do too much brother Ram says we'll never pray too much and I would say we'll never have too much Revelation there will never be too much Revelation where we're just so saturated we just don't want anymore you can't tell us anymore we will continually be learning how God unfolds himself throughout eternity that's what the prophet said to us the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation and you I am talking about all Revelation it is tremendously important to the church do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this question whom do men say that I the son of man am and this is the the very familiar this is kind of trigger us to go into the discussion about Peter Simon Peter is really where I want to get into today talking about Revelation but I just felt led to start here I hope it's okay do you remember in Matthew 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this question whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some said Thou Art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he said unto them but who say ye that I am who do you say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it as message Believers that's just sort of the Hallmark the Keystone if you excuse me if you will the place that we we kind of Drive the stake down and say amen that's just a wonderful place to be that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it but not against that Peter is the rock that Jesus chose which is what the denominational World took and and made but but yet it is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen the revelation of who Jesus Christ Jesus the Christ actually is the Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter now that is really carnal how could God build the church Upon A man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it God can't build his church upon any man born in sin but there's billions of people that are traveling that way believing that with all their hearts willing to stake their lives on it why and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot but if you ever go to Rome and you ever go to Vatican City you can see St Peter's Basilica and that is where they claim that Peter was not only crucified upside down but they have buried him under the altar they've got a tremendous altar there in St Peter's Basilica where they say the bones of St Peter actually are but I think that is potentially not exactly what's happening is everything okay here are we okay we're okay okay yeah sorry I think there are some upgrades done I hope it's okay I just uh noticed something going on I just want to make sure everything's good we don't want to be nervous God can't build his church upon any man born in sin what a wonderful thing that is and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot and it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus my what is it built upon then as Believers we know it was built on Revelation read it the way it is written Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and Upon This Rock Revelation I will build my church the church is built on Revelation on thus sayith the Lord the importance of Revelation brothers and sisters we can never ever overemphasize the importance of Revelation I just think uh I got thinking about the the Flesh of the son of man you know how brother Bram he talks about that many times how Jesus said it unless you eat my flesh and you drink my blood you have no part with me you have no life in you he says it a couple different ways there's there's a real problem unless you do that and we know that he did that for a reason he did that to thin out the people that were following him to show who is who to to to manifest the seed that was inside of the people amen and they can't help it and I love that thought myself as we Minister the word as we hear the truth of the word of God in the day in which we live brothers and sisters only one thing is going to happen when we hear the pure word of God come forward according to the Vindicated messenger for our age the true seed that's inside of every single human being is going to come to life and there's no way that we can stop that and that is by revelation of the spirit amen the Father which is in heaven I think it's just so beautiful though when you think about the Flesh of the son of man unless you eat his flesh how much of an offensive statement that would have been to all of the religious zealots in the day all of the priests all of the Levites everyone who would ever hear those words would be mortified to hear that you could not even touch a dead body you could not have anything to do with blood we know the Old Testament law I'm not going to go too far into that but there was very specific instructions according to the law yeah and what was happening here was there was a corner being turned according to the scripture amen and without Revelation by the spirit people were missing it and it's no different today it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and what's going on is the whole world is going on the track that has been for years and years since the fathers fell asleep nothing else has changed my goodness we've got the Catholic Church we've got all the Protestant churches we've got the the the the great and we've got all of her daughters and everyone is a part of it they're all cruising along at the same speed they're good people yeah but something happened right something happened in North America there was something that took place there was a corner that was turned amen and it was according to the word of God but you had to have Revelation by the spirit to be able to understand what that corner was just like you had to have Revelation by the spirit to understand who the son of man was when he came amen but if you look up the Flesh of the son of man there's 29 results and and this really kind of got me excited it's just a quirky little thing sometimes I look at things this way but if you look at the Flesh of the son of man there's 29 results in the message of the hour if you type that in but 28 of them are from 1964 onwards there's 29 of them but all 28 beyond that are actually beyond the first one is in 1962 I believe but it just kind of just kind of made me think about it it's just right at the end of his ministry and we know that was a culmination of his ministry the culmination of saying what the message of the hour truly is because when the Church of God recognizes what it is yeah come on not who she is what it is when the church recognizes what it is hallelujah and I'm just going to throw in my interpretation the son of man once again on Earth in flesh if you listen to 1964 you hear brother bradam talk about Jesus Christ in Flesh on Earth again over and over again 1964 and then if you look at those messages you look at the end of every one of them there's a prayer line and sometimes there's people who don't have prayer cards and he just calls them out I keep saying it over and over what was that that was not a man that wasn't a microphone in the ear that wasn't prayer cards give us the information beforehand so Billy Paul can run around behind and actually give his daddy or whoever's talking into the microphone a list of information about the people it was it was God and it's just so fascinating how he did it because he would start with one person and he would go to the next person and the next person and the next person and just continually tell them what's wrong with them and that you're healed in the name of Jesus Christ who could do that the only one that could do that is the son of man in flesh once again but it takes Revelation by the spirit and many people are still confusing Revelations 19 where the saints come back with him and the corridors of Heaven open up and they all come back on white horses and there's a great cataclysmic event that takes place that's not what's going to happen the Revelation by the spirit is according to the message of the hour the son of man Ministry that we're encountering right now the tail end of it what's going to happen is that the the the bride is just going to secret secretly suddenly just go away amen she's just going to disappear right and the world's going to say where'd that weirdo go I haven't seen that person for a long time I haven't seen that that guy named Barry for a long time where is that guy where is that sister where is that brother there'll be a few people wondering potentially Lord willing not many but it's going to happen in such a way that we're not expecting it but many people are looking for a great man to come on the scene and we know that in America they've got their great man he's the president-elect and he's coming on the scene all right and I'm not trying to Mi mix politics with the pulpit but what I am saying is that there's a lot of people in the world looking for a great man someone to come and actually save the world but there's no saving of this world and we know that the USA has a judgment pronounced against it USA has thus sayith the Lord not in a good way but that same thus sayith the Lord applies to the entire world what a blessing and an honor and a privilege it is to have ears to hear what the son of man spirit said to the church in this age to know that we're not going to have to contend with all of that Hallelujah my goodness Maybe they're going to take away our bank accounts before we go may maybe they're going to take away our driver's licenses before we go maybe our bank cards won't work maybe our mortgage payments won't go through maybe all of our cryptocurrency will just burn maybe all of the things that we have maybe natural faith in we won't have any opportunity to use and that will be for a purpose that will be so that the son of man can show and demonstrate a quick powerful demonstration of the power of God by the spirit through his bride [Music] when we start seeing those things happen brothers and sisters maybe they will maybe they won't we don't know but if they do don't be afraid Don't Be Afraid take courage and say Amen because I know what's happening I know what's going to happen there's going to be a short powerful demonstration of the son of man's spirit I think it's beautiful in this story here it's it's I I don't know like I said I just have to trust the Lord perhaps it's for someone somehow talking about this story here and this little boy how how verse 9 says there is a lad here which hath five barley Loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many we know the story so well the points I want to get to here is that Jesus fed the people didn't he he took the the loaves from the boy and he fed the people what if that boy would have said no I don't got any loaves I got my Five Loaves of my fish and I'm going to eat and I'll just run around the corner behind the Rock and I'll get my sustenance and I'll come back and hang out and watch the party and I'll be good man I know I worked hard to get these and maybe mom or dad gave them the Loaves and the fish and you know what if he would have not actually volunteered what if he would have not given them but you know what he did give them he was willing to give them and isn't it interesting something came over him to say I I've got this I I want to try and help but isn't it interesting that at the very end of this story here God did not just take that that bread and fish and then leave him destitute what did he say he said very carefully gather up all of the rest of it make sure that there's nothing just wasted and put it all in baskets and what was there 12 baskets of leftovers so God took and took that that that offering we're going to call it of the little boy a and he fed everyone 5,000 men plus who knows however many others and then he still had some left over see if God won't bless your offerings is my point brothers and sisters he will not leave you destitute if you're willing to help him he will be more than willing to bless you abundantly I think it's just such a wonderful thing when you look at it that way you know I just can't help but but think about Peter and how he he actually began to get Revelation he started to to have this Revelation come into his heart and we know that there was a time where it really struck him and and I believe believe sorry it was in Luke 5 let's turn over to Luke Chapter 5 just for the sake of discussion this morning in Luke Luke chapter 5 just love how Jesus deals with us and it came to pass that as this verse one of chapter 5 and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of ganat and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's he entered into the ship first and then he asked him entered into the ship which was Simon's excuse me and prayed him that he would thrust him out a little bit from the land and he sat down and he taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drw and Simon answering said unto him Master we've toiled all night and have taken nothing but something inside of him something on the inside of him nevertheless at Thy word yeah now we know the story very well but but let's let's just go on and read it I I don't need to get in the way here verse six says and when they had this done they enclosed a great multitud ude of fishes and their net break and they beckoned unto their Partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink and when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at jesus' knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken I just think it's so beautiful he goes on to say and so was also James and John the sons of zebede which were partners with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not from henceforth Thou shalt catch men and we know that that's where they said this is the son of man this is the one that we've been looking for we need to follow this guy and so they they gave up fishing and away they went but once again isn't it interesting to see Jesus come on the scene God in flesh come on the scene have a need was he not God In the Flesh could he not have spoken in such a way that they all would have heard but isn't it interesting that he had to have a natural circumstance to bring to pass his word to bring to pass his his will in the situation and that was to actually have to borrow the ship and by borrowing the ship for a brief moment what happened God blessed him abundantly naturally he gave naturally to God and God gave way more naturally back to him it's just such a beautiful story I I think it's wonderful it's Revelation by the spirit brothers and sisters so what happened as soon as that happened the natural circumstances come on the scene he's like whatever I wasn't using my ship anyways it's good for nothing I can't catch any fish we fished all night whatever you might as well just use it and he heard the words of life and something transpired inside of him right it must have just started to ignite that seed that was inside of him and what happened was God blessed him abundantly we've read that I think it's just a beautiful thing it was it was the first time that Peter really experienced the supernatural with the son of man Ministry that was in front of him but the beautiful part about it is Peter said to him neverthe less at Thy word I'll follow your instruction and I just can't help but think brothers and sisters many times we don't need to understand we try to say we need to understand help me understand what's going on in this situation what if we said Lord nevertheless at Thy word let this situation unfold according to your will I don't have to understand it necessarily I just have to believe it but that's where we have to come to the place the crossroads every one of us in our lives we've got to come to the place where we say either God is God and he's in complete control of every single situation that we live and encounter or he's not because he's not in charge and in control of some and not others he's in control of every single one amen every single human being every single flee and every single bat of its eye and how much tall would come off it is what brother bradam said he's in control but this is the same one that Peter said nevertheless at Thy word I I just think it's such a beautiful story here this is the same one who in The Book of Malachi he said prove me in this and see if I won't pour out a blessing if I won't open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that you can't even contain that's not you don't even have room enough to contain the blessing that I've got to pour out upon you I just love it how he he he God sometimes I think we just I think brother mvin said it a couple times sometimes we want to overp spiritualize our lives right God he wants to deal with us in the natural realm yes but sometimes we want to hypers spiritualize things I think brothers and sisters just my opinion that's not really good for much but I just think God knows our natural circumstances he knows our natural situations we just read two stories to explain how he does and did he not come and bless them abundantly he knows exactly what we're going through he knows exactly what our issues and problems are all we need to do is commit our ways unto him amen we know the the scripture we say it many times trust in the Lord with all thine heart not most of it not part of it all thine heart and in all thy ways acknowledge Him every single way in our tithe in our offering in our school in our marriage in our relationships with our parents in our relationships as husband and wives in our relationships as brothers and sisters at deacons at the door as Ministers of this gospel in all of our ways acknowledge Him and He will direct our paths he knows what we need to go through he knows if we've toiled all night long and not caught any fish he knows if we've got Five Loaves in our back and nobody else has food that might just be enough to sustain everyone and if we're willing to say take it all here here's all of it I'm not going to hold nothing back see what he'll do give you 12 baskets back it just makes me think of the story we're not talking about the natural stuff so much now we're talking about Revelation by the spirit what it's going to take for us to get that Revelation by the spirit is for him to know there's no more doors indoors there's no more doors that we've got to try and open up and go inside and see is there another hidden door is there another passageway to something else that we're holding back and hiding many times we can have hurts and pains situations in our lives that we're just not willing to deal with because it hurts too much how much did Jesus hurt when he carried his cross up to Calvary for us yeah how much did he hurt when he actually was tied to that stump and had the catanine Tails tearing his body to bits so much so that they had to come and tell him stop you're not supposed to kill him yeah how much pain did he feel there the pains that we feel in this life brothers and sisters lay them down don't drag around a ball and chain and have a hidden passageway or Corridor of pain that we're holding on to amen but he knows our natural circumstances better than we do he knows them better than we do he knows exactly how to relate to us in our own situations anybody here ever had Revelation by the spirit in your natural circumstance and know that it's only God that could have done that anybody anybody experienced that only God would have known that only God could have done that sometimes we say wow only God could have heard that conversation that we just had right but see if he won't actually open up the windows of heaven and prove us on it a and today what I'm talking about isn't so much in giving giving the tithes and offerings I I just wanted to do those little comparisons because really it it's a it's it's a revelation brothers and sisters we can say it all we want you know give tithes give offerings it it's fine don't worry about it we're not pulling for money brother mvin said it loud and clear we're not pulling for money God supplies all of our needs amen according to his riches and Glory we're not worried about money here what we're worried about is Revelation by the spirit that's the critical Factor that's what we're getting at today that's what I want to try and and just just Hammer home is the importance of Revelation to us of the True Believer the Revelation by the spirit to the True Believer can never be overemphasized because it's Revelation by the spirit that will actually give us keys to the kingdom it will give us the ability to have trust that our prayers are actually being heard it'll give us the ability to understand that we don't have to have a prophet or a great minister to to to call and say oh I've got this great need in my life just like those two brothers that were wiring the trailer and their little son one of the of their sons got electrocuted they tried to call a prophet tried to call a prophet tried to call a prophet couldn't get them and they said you know we just need to pray and what happened they prayed for the dead son and he came to life Revelation by the spirit God wants to manifest in our lives more than we want to see him manifest in our lives brothers and sisters I think the prophet said a thousand times more than we want to see him manifest in our lives the importance of Revelation can never ever be overemphasized and I know there people in this room in this life that have experienced that level of revelation where you pray and God answers he comes on the scene this little boy though in our story he made an offering with the Loaves and and God my didn't God bless him didn't God bless that little boy way more isn't it wonderful to think that he chose a boy for the story too it wasn't an adult who was pushing a cart selling bread it was just a little boy that had some bread and some fish and God took that little boy and is it what Jesus said unless you come as a little child you'll in no wise see the kingdom if we come all puffed up in our our pride and say I know it all and I've had it all I've heard it all I got all the books I've read every message I've heard every you know if that's the attitude that we've got then we die right there brothers and sisters we've got to come as a little child trusting that he is going to lead us trusting that he will guide us yes because what we come to a place where we have enough food for ourselves we'll just word it that way because it's kind of our story I got enough I got a Subway Sub in my backpack I got enough food but you know what I only need one part of that Subway sub and I could share the rest of it with other people and save other people's lives think about this the word of God how much food sustenance is right here how many other people can we help with this word of God when we come to the place we recognize who we are amen when we are that mature Christian what we do is we pray for others yeah we don't scoff at the brother and scoff at the sister and say look at them and my they're just they've got this problem and I wish they would just get more mature no no we say that's God's grace in their life I heard brother Cadre Diggs preach a message at a church recently and and and a brother shared it with me and I just thought it was so good because really when we're going through a trial when a brother and sister's going through a trial that's God expressing his grace to them it's so true there's no way that we can say that it's any other way cuz God knows our natural circumstances amen yes and he allows us to go through trials he allows us to go through tribulation so that we can learn something from it amen not to be destroyed by it he's working on our character right in our scripture today in John chapter 6 when they were filled verse 12 he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost and I just can't help but think that's exactly just doveet tales with Malachi 3 if you'll turn there with me we'll we'll read that I'll just read these two verses here I just think it's so beautiful out of John 6 when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather the fragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of The Barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten just such a wonderful thing you know in uh in Malachi chapter 3 verse 7 even from the days of your fathers you are gone away away from my ordinances and have not kept them and you know brothers and sisters we could say well you know the children of Israel comeing out of Egypt and all the stuff they did in the wilderness and they got so far out there they were worshiping golden calfs and they were way out there weren't they and they were truly but you know one word off puts us in that category one word off puts us in that category and one word off of what one word off of the instruction given to us by a Vindicated messenger for the the age in which we live we're reading about the seven Church ages one word off puts us in that category but he says he gives us the space return unto me and I will return unto you that's all we need to do sayeth the Lord of hosts but you say wherein shall we return will a will a man rob God yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings yeah come on he says ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the Lord of hosts amen amen if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing pour you out of blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it amen you know brothers and sisters I just want to make sure we're real clear on this I'm not preaching about tithes and offerings I'm preaching about Revelation by the spirit today I'm talking about getting Revelation by the spirit and and you know sometimes the way that we get Revelation by the spirit is is by taking it we we say Amen to us when it comes to us but what are we giving out right what are we doing to Garner that Revelation by the spirit because we just read two stories God knows exactly our our natural circumstances and when he comes our way and actually asks us for a favor are we willing to give it to him when he comes by our way and asks us for a favor how does he do it how does he do it does he call us on the phone does he shoot us a text does he send us an email usually it's a brother or a sister right usually it's another human being in the world that's saying I got this thing can you help me right can you just give me a hand for a second brothers and sisters I want to say this loud and clear when that happens try God at it prove him on it don't worry about money I'm not talking about money I'm saying time and effort and prayers supplications for our brothers and our sisters when people need help are we willing to give it to them because sometimes we entertain Angels unawares sometimes it's a complete stranger but when how much more when we have a brother and sister who has a need amen my and that verse 11 I think is such a an amazing one and it's so important to remember this brothers and sisters because when we have a need in our families when we have a need in our marriage when we have a need in our children's lives who are sick when we have a husband that has to go to the ER my goodness by an ambulance we can read this verse here I will and I will rebuke the Devourer for whose sake s yeah and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field sayeth the Lord of hosts and All Nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be a delightsome land saith the Lord of hosts amen I just can't help but think how many doctors would fit that description All Nations how many nurses that have had to deal with Believers people getting prayed for by Believers how many doctors and nurses in the medical profession would just say wow there's something different about this person how come do they continually get sick so sick that we think they're going to die and then suddenly they just raise back up again how does that work it doesn't happen in other people's lives but yet somehow it does in these people's lives it's because they're a delightsome land it's because they other people can see it and I think it's beautiful because God makes sure that the other people around will bear witness of his life of his work of his answered prayers in the lives of Believers amen you know God he he reveals himself I think it was just such a a strong little thing that I was getting when I was studying this God reveals himself sometimes we want to reveal God don't we we want to have a prayer line and we want to start praying for someone we want to put hands on them and start jumping up and down and screaming at the top of our lungs to see God come on the scene but sometimes we just need to speak the word amen amen and say God said that he would do this and and I believe it with all my heart but I'm just going to let him do it God reveals himself brothers and sisters by by the spirit in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 he says but in in verse 9 he says but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of a man which things which things God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God Amen it's just I think such a beautiful thought we we don't need to really worry too much we don't need to really try too much we just need to trust a whole lot amen that's what we need to do and and really when we trust then we can obey we know that song trust and Obey for there's no other way right many times people will say well that's a pretty simple equation and it can sound that way but we're not supposed to understand it we talked about the beginning of the service today help me understand it we don't need to understand it we just need to believe it am that's the commission isn't it when the angel of the Lord met the messenger to this age what did he say to him if you can get the people to understand your prayers yeah if you can get the people to understand the message of the hour if you can get the people to understand the quotes if you can get people to understand the conduct order and Doctrine oh my then no devil will be able to stand in the way of your prayer no he said if you can get the people to believe that's why his theme song was only believe you cannot educate yourself into revelation God reveals himself I think it's so wonderful because there's a people that will be ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth in this age we need to be careful and allow the spirit to reveal it to us but it only comes by prayer brothers and sisters it only comes by relationship it only comes by having the intimacy that he's looking for and that only comes by sacrifice only comes by taking the loaves out of our own backpack and saying it's all I got how can I help what can I do amen your body Lord what can I do for my brothers and sisters and I'm not trying to pull on anything to to to anyone all I'm saying is God knows our situations brothers and sisters if we want to see blessings from God then be willing to take him at his word just be willing to trust him and see if he won't pour out a blessing upon you that you can't even contain and and and don't worry about financial blessing that will all follow I would say more than anything worry about the Revelation by the spirit that I'm saved that I know that I know I know if I were to die I don't have to be afraid yeah if death comes knocking at my door I can say hey if it's his will then have at her because when you're done doing what you're going to do only because he gave you permission to I'm going to be with him quicker than you can blink your eye to be able to have that level of confidence to know that we're able to hold the message of the hour the truth about Jesus Christ in the age in which we live before our families so that our children can have salvation the devour wants to devour our children the Devourer wants to keep us so busy that we cannot hold the word of God before our children and you know brothers and sisters sometimes we can get so busy not with worldly things we can get so busy with religion yeah with doing things for God Amen that our families suffer there's a balance you got to have Revelation by the spirit to know that your family is going to have that rooting and grounding that rudimentary understanding of the message of the hour amen it's a paradox isn't it something that's unbelievable but absolutely true something that's just so far out there that you just can't even really comprehend it but it's absolutely true yeah for there to be predestinated elected Sons and Daughters of God is is a paradox to have someone go brother Bram says it from being a cucker to being a seed of wheat it's a paradox to have a sinner which is the greatest Miracle of all brothers and sisters healings and and Revelations and all the different things that can happen manifestations all of the great wonders of miracles signs and wonders all of that is one thing but to have a sinner be able to come to the recognition that they too are saved by grace and to have a sinner go from being a sinner to becoming a saint to recognizing that they have a position in the economy of God that's the greatest Miracle of all but that's the Revelation that we're talking about today brothers and sisters the the the Revelation the importance of Revelation about who we are who we truly are because when we realize what we are and I'm going to say it this way the son of man Ministry because we're not living our lives for ourselves are we if we're just living our lives for ourselves then we're just like everyone else in the world but if we're living our lives for everyone else brother bradam said eternal life is what it's living for others when the church recognizes what it is I'll say it this way the son of man in flesh again if you've got his spirit inside of you who are you right people say now that's getting out there oh my now we going to pick up stones and we're going to Stone you because you're going to make yourself God hey he said it not me amen but it's the same thing now you're getting fanatical but we know it I I'll stand behind it I'll say it even from the pulpit in the way in which you call heresy how many people would raise their hand and say that's how I worship God according to the message of the hour the son of man Ministry the son of man in flesh once again don't look at signs and wonders to identify whether Jesus Christ is in your flesh brothers and sisters look at your ability to say hey do I believe the message of the hour or not not do I understand it so find yeah razor sharp brother bradam said razor thin people understand it and people believe it which one are you I say Lord help me there's things that I want to understand but you know by and by I'm sure he'll let us know Paradox 1964 brother bradam said who had the fruit of the spirit Jesus he said search the scriptures you think they in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me and I want to say today brothers and sisters they testify of you they testify of us they tell you who I am he never did come out and say who he was this is Brother Bram talking about Eat My Flesh and drink my blood the people were like like wow he's a vampire this guy's crazy this guy is we knew that he was off his rocker we knew that he's simply the son of a carpenter he's a scoundrel he's probably an illegitimate child we knew all about this guy before but now here he is in our church talking this way are you serious we better call the deacons and get him out of here because he's just going a little bit far right but here he is saying they they tell you who I am he never did come out and tell tell them he never did come out and say who he was did he that's right he never did that the people were able to identify that he didn't tell them and why he got his congregation he he said unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood as I said last night you have no life why my that congregation said that guy is crazy what would doctors and science be careful about doctors and science brothers and sisters God uses them but that's not where all of our faith lies I would say only a little tiny bit of our faith lies there all of our faith is weighted in Christ amen all of our weight why my that congregation said that guy is crazy what what with doctors in science well that man trying to make cannibals he never explained it either did he he just said it and why did he do it because there there was an importance of Revelation that had to manifest in the lives of the people that really believed not just understood oh my some of those people some of those 70 you could only imagine maybe they were Scholars maybe they understood the the word maybe they were studying the Old Testament Scrolls maybe they were looking at it to see the identification Isaiah said behold what a virgin shall conceive and maybe they were scratching their heads and saying well maybe she was a virgin and maybe she did conceive and maybe this is the one but boy when you start going this far now you're going crazy now now it's just too far now you're asking us to just actually go beyond what we understand and just believe by Revelation right why my my that congregation said that guy's crazy what doctors in science well well that man trying to make cannibals he never explained it he it was time for them to turn him down goes with what we're talking about on Wednesday There's a time where the seed will manifest what life is in it and you know there ain't nobody that's going to be able to hide that seed that's inside of them the anointing that's on this earth right now you look around you don't have to look very far and you can see all manner of seeds that are actually manifesting and I just can't help but think about it you know how we look at the the the ones who are ruling and governing in in in World governments they were participants in many times back in the 50s and the 60s when all of the things were starting to manifest when the prophet was out ministering the anointing was on Earth ministering the son of man Ministry once again the first and second polls were going on there was also a a Ministry of death through Satan and how incredible the music industry took off and how incredible it was that the drug industry took off and how many people took part in both of those and a lot of those people today are ruling in governments they were a part of that movement on the I would say the evil side but now they're the rulers now they're heads of state maybe even presidents Prime Ministers all around the world our leaders why brother bam goes on to say then he had a bunch of preachers hanging around him borderline Believers he said well what are you going to say when you see me upad up ascend from where I come from come from well we've seen the Cradle you were born in the city you were born in we fished with you we're here on the Hills you know it's interesting I'm sure we all know about it there's all these stories that are being told about the message of the hour in Arizona if you don't know there's uh columnists that are doing stories trying to do what they call an expose trying to tell all about the cult of the message of the hour in Arizona and what they're doing is they're they're taking people's stories from their perspectives and and they're implementing them into the papers and to be honest with you I haven't read them any of them I've only seen the headlines and I heard this was going to happen and now it's manifesting and I'm just looking at I know a couple of the names I've I've seen but it's happening and then they're trying to slander this message they're trying to pick up stones and and throw rocks at the son of man Ministry and they can do whatever they want to but what what what I want to say is really what they're doing is is unfortunately contending with people that learned the message of the hour these people that learned the message of the hour from being close to the prophet they did not actually go on to the true baptis ISM of the Holy Ghost because if they did they would not have behaved the way they did in manners that it would actually just destroy people's lives just destroy people's hearts destroy people's families all of the things that come out of those stories people had a head knowledge of the message of the hour they had a head knowledge of who the prophet of God was but they never got it all the way down to the heart and we know we've heard that said that's the longest journey that 16 in from the head down into the heart for this m message to take for the revelation of Jesus Christ to go but I just can't help but think there were people that were just like this the the the preachers right come in well we've seen you in the Cradle you were you were born in we we've seen the city you're you're born in we fish with you out here in the Hills we we we walked with you we talked with you you you come from oh my now we know you're crazy but real genuine Faith don't move doesn't matter how many news articles they come up with it doesn't matter how many Slanders they come out with it doesn't matter how many times people say anybody that follows the teachings of William Mariam brandham is a part of a cult doesn't matter because I never met William Mariam brandham I met Jesus Christ amen that was the purpose of him was to introduce the second coming of Jesus Christ now I want to ask this question brothers and sisters did he accomplish that amen yeah did he introduce the second coming of Jesus Christ or are we still looking for it is it out there somewhere we know we've heard it said many times we're not looking for the coming we're looking for the [Applause] going the real genuine Faith don't move them disciples couldn't explain it but they knowed there it was it has to be something that God planted had to be his thoughts before the foundation of the world by when he planted when he planned sorry the whole redeemed and we know we've read this Ephesians 1 1:5 he planned the whole thing before the foundation of the world his thoughts and this is the attributes of his thoughts he doesn't Force us he made us free moral agents just like Adam and Eve in the guard he gave them the choice we have the choice we can actually follow the message of the hour or not we can put our own spin on it and say hey I've got a tradition in my family that does it this way and God will say that's okay go ahead we can say oh my pastor when I grew up we did it that way and the only way that's going to be right is that way is it does that leave any room for Revelation by the spirit amen you know brother bradam he even said he he even reprimanded bradam Tabernacle he said no this isn't right either the only thing that's right is Christ amen there's a way that seeth right unto a man right oh my but it can be death right he planned the whole thing before the foundation of the world we don't have to be afraid of predestin a we don't have to be afraid of Revelation by the spirit I would say be afraid of not getting Revelation by the spirit I would say be afraid of not having time in prayer be afraid of not giving freely of yourself because of eternal life living for others be afraid of that brothers and sisters it takes Revelation by the spirit to be able to do it though amen it sounds like I'm just pulling for money or something but I'm not I'm I'm just trying to encourage us to maybe go a little farther maybe look at it just a little bit differently maybe not just be stuck in our ways so so far so rigid that this is as far as I'll go and I'll only do it this way because if that's what happens we're going to be just like those preachers that brother Bram just described and before long we're going to have a head knowledge and someone will be writing an article about us that's right but you know if we're willing to take him at his word he said he will rebuke the devour for our sakes when the Devil comes around and tries to Rattle our marriage we can say no but Lord don't you remember when he comes around and tries to give a box of rattlesnakes to our children we can say no no that's not what your word says your word says that you will rebuke the Devourer for our sakes amen I just think it's beautiful how the Lord used Peter and how he used him in the examples the natural examples in Peter's life isn't it wonderful how many there are there's so many I just have a few here you know you know in Matthew chapter 14 while while Peter and the disciples they were in the ship we know the story very well the storm came up and they didn't know what to do they Jesus told them just go go to the other side we had a tremendous meeting and I'm I'm done with everyone he sent the multitudes away he sent the disciples away he needed to just recharge his batteries for a bit and what happened well they were out on the middle of the lake we know that brother Brandon brings the illustration very well he says now the Devils they said now we got you and they toss the tip ship around like a bottle stopper and and we know that they saw Jesus walking on the water another example a natural experience we say that that it's very Supernatural because he went out walked on the water but what I'm saying is is God used the natural environment around them right he made a storm they were in the boat he let them see him they thought he was a spirit but there came a point where Peter spoke something to him nobody else said it but this Peter something about this Peter right he said what did he say in verse 28 of of Matthew chapter 14 and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water and we know full well what happened what happened for those who don't remember Peter walked on the water amen Jesus walked on the the water but so did Peter why did he do it because he said Lord I believe yeah in his heart he believed and we know that when he stopped believing and got caught up in the natural circumstances look at these waves how deep is this water oh my the wind's blowing I'm getting rain in my face oh no what's going to happen what happened he started to sink he got caught up too caught up looking at the natural trying to understand it don't try to understand God just trust him and say bid bid me Lord to come unto thee amen yes and he'll take you we know another one was Mount Transfiguration let's turn there over to Matthew chapter 17 while we still have a little bit of time Matthew chapter 17 are we okay this morning Matthew chapter 17 I just think it's so wonderful to to know that we have the ability and and not only the ability brothers and sisters we have the requirement amen yeah to get this level of revelation we're talking about it's not an option we have got to come there and and you know some people will have such great faith in Revelation they'll they'll be able to move mountains with their faith and other people they'll just have simple faith and they'll say I believe and what more is great which one is greater I would say neither just being able to believe is it yeah that's all it is that's the requirement Matthew 17:1 after 6 days Jesus taketh Peter James and John uh his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him I just think this is such an amazing story could you imagine that they recog ized him how did they know maybe he said their names we don't know verse four then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord oh lord it's good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias my the trinitarian doctrine started right there something was happening wasn't it yeah he was going natural again he was trying to recognize it by his own understanding he was he was not leaning unto the Lord he was leaning unto his own oh my I can I can see with my eyes there's there's there's Moses and I can see with my eyes there's Elias and I can can see with my eyes there's Jesus and and it's this heavenly moment we need to capture it now we need to to contain it in a book that's where brother Bram talks about it that's where the spirit of God departs and it was what while he yet spake these words Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and I just can't help but think that the same exact voice is what came and opened those seals in Jeffersonville the same exact voice is what the Bride of Jesus Christ hears when she listens to those seals that were open in Jeffersonville it wasn't William Mary and bradam that open any seal it was the angel of the Lord that met him amen from the presence of almighty God with a message to teach him what to say Behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid but what happened Again Naturally it goes from spiritual correction to Natural Jesus understanding where they were and Jesus came and he touched them and said arise be not afraid but just believe amen just believe Don't Be Afraid don't worry God knows exactly what we need he knows our situations he knows our concerns he knows our petitions we've just got to be willing to trust him we got to be willing to give him the time I think it's so beautiful we can look at uh Lord willing I'll probably get into it a little bit later but brother bradam talks about the in the message the trial in 1964 I don't have the quote here so don't worry just gonna talk a little bit about it he talks about different types of people in that message he talks about the witness of something that happened he talks about the witness the the one who actually made it happen he talks about the one who is actually on on trial he talks about the one who was just a a nonbeliever talks about the one who's a make believer talks about all the different types of people that are at the trial and and I just can't help but think when I listen to that message because I do a fair bit I just love it so much you know we're on trial right now because the Devil Is Right There Before the Throne accusing the Brethren day and night he doesn't rest he is continually trying to put something in our path so that he can accuse us properly according to the word but all we've got to do is believe that he has paid the price he's already done it when he bowed his head on the cross and gave up The Ghost and said it is finished what was he talking about brothers and sisters his life was not just finished he was saying that I have paid the price according to the word I am the kinsman redeemer and the cost that was required is completely met amen it's finished there's no more sin that can be held against them against them to their charge you know Peter another natural circumstance I'm not going to get through this all I'm not going to try and hold us here late today but Peter another natural circumstance was in Mark 8 you know Jesus was explaining to the disciples it was getting later in his ministry it it was probably I don't know maybe they had supper together and just while they were there fellowshipping in verse 31 for the sake of time in Mark chapter 8 and he began to teach them Jesus began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again he he their friend was telling them this is going to happen to him and and and how could that possibly be we know that Peter was a man of action yeah isn't it interesting The Man of Action I can only imagine he would be what we would classify as the the triple A+ type of personality and you know what they say if you want to get something done if you've got something you need to get done find someone busy and get them to do the job because they know how to get stuff done amen but you can try and hand a broom to someone who's lazy and they'll look at it and say what's that right but here we have Peter that guy who is the A+ personality that wants to get stuff done and he's always on guard for his brother his Lord and verse 32 and he spake that saying openly and Peter took him and began to rebuke him not on my watch ain't nobody going to kill you I see you as my Lord You're the Savior you're the one that everyone's been looking for and I can see you man you're not going to get hurt but what did Jesus say but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked Peter saying get thee behind me Satan for thou savest not the things that be of God but the things that be of man yes why did he do that why did he actually say that to Peter I was wondering this for a long long time and I believe the Lord just gave me an answer for it and I'm going to bring it it's not anything complicated why did he say that because he had the wrong revelation right exactly he didn't have the right Revelation the right Revelation was what Jesus Christ was telling them the word made flesh was explaining the right Revelation but he had his own natural Revelation no I'm going to be a defender of this Faith to the death I'm going to prevent you from being killed nobody's going to come upon you and fall upon you no way it ain't happening sometimes I think as as Believers of this message we can get so defensive about it we can actually start to hurt our brothers and our sisters we need to back off and just allow the Lord to have his way have Revelation if we can do anything for a brother or a sister pray that they would get Revelation especially if we're the the the mighty mature message Believers been in the message for decades oh my why don't those people behave the way that I do if that's how we are are we on our knees are we getting that that that that muscular identific ification that brother bradam talked about how the true sign of a man is the bags in his knees from going in prayer for his brothers and his sisters are we busy doing that or are we just busy beating our chest [Music] amen when he turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked Peter saying get the behind me Satan why here we have his disciple the one that the Catholic church is saying they built the church on this is what the church is built on this guy he had Satan talking through him wow makes me wonder brothers and sisters how many times have we got the devil talking through US amen this is one of the 12 one of the Apostles but you know what's Wild is he is just like you you are just like him every one of us has to go into that upper room and get that baptism of the Holy Ghost that's our only hope to be sealed amen that's the formula that's the greatest Revelation that we're ever going to get is that if I get repent and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of my sins some people would say well I've never sinned I'm a good person you weren't born right unfortunately before you were ever expressed in this world it was wrong amen that's just the way God made it and he made it that way because Adam and Eve chose that way amen it's such a beautiful thought isn't it to recognize through the revelation of the message of the hour that there was a time where births they were supposed to go forth and and and multiply through the spoken word amen not through a sexual experience amen yeah my we could go a long ways down that road but I'm not going to today but I'll say it this way maybe for someone that's listening or someone that's never heard it before what really happened in the Garden of Eden the entire fall of mankind is because of fruit yeah come on right right Peter he said those words to Jesus he tried to correct Jesus because he had the wrong Revelation all he had to do was listen and believe amen amen if he listened and believed do you ever think it's an accident that God gave us two ears and one mouth if he listened and just believed he would have had the right Revelation and another one Jesus told them this would happen too we know this all too well I better call the musicians but we know this one all too well Peter denied him three times didn't he right but Jesus told him he would and can you imagine what it must have been like for this guy he's had a a multitude uh these are the documented cases too by the way that are in the word how many happened that weren't documented I have to wonder how many things did Jesus say that actually came to pass in Peter's life in in the disciples lives in order for them to say wow this is truly the son of man this truly is way more than any man we've ever met in our lives Peter had Den item three times exactly how Jesus told him amen before the crows you will deny me three times and and we know that he told them that everyone's going to leave me everyone's going to abandon me Peter's like not me man I'm going to die for you and and here we have him warming himself by a fire while Jesus is getting punched in the face by the most religious preachers yeah he's getting beat up mocked spit on all this is happening this one that he's ready to die for he's warming himself by the fire outside the court the high priest and what happens little Maiden says hey you sound like him you got the same accent you must be from the Bronx I can tell the sound of your voice and what did he do he said no I'm not one of them no no no no no and what did he do he cursed while doing it and that's what brother bradam said in the first quote that we read Revelation true Revelation to the True Believer can never be overemphasized the importance of that brothers and sisters the importance of that today I believe is the greatest thing that we need we need the importance of Revelation by the spirit and the importance of Revelation by the spirit about the message of the hour but importance of Revelation by the spirit about truly Who We Are are amen amen because when that happens when when the church realizes what it is then the Rapture is going to go and and I know it's not going to happen one moment too soon it's not going to happen one moment too late it's going to be in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I had the discussion with brother Aaron mcgi one time how quickly that will be you can actually work out a mathematical formula I'm not too smart I'm not smart enough to do that someone here probably is but you can actually realize how quickly light travels and how quickly it flashes off of someone's eyeball and then reflects back to you that's pretty fast that's how quick the Rapture is going to go that's how quickly our bodies are going to be changed that's how quickly they're going to come out of the graves and be in the sky waiting for us my to meet him in the air maybe stand with me as we close today brothers and sisters I got one maybe two more here three more more I don't know couple more if it's okay when their eyes were open 1964 brother Bram said don't stand and look at it and try and figure it out like the Pharisees said they stood and looked at him there and said this man is Beelzebub they couldn't figure it out they had to give it a name they said this man does this by the spirit of the devil my he's beel abub a fortune teller and we know that Jesus said today I'll forgive you of this but when the true Holy Spirit comes if you say one word against him one word against him it won't be forgiven here or over there amen we got to be very careful how we speak why don't have nothing to do with this fellow he was born in in sin weren't we all he don't have our fellowship cards he doesn't belong to us and oh my they don't even know where he went to school at he has no education why well where did this man come from now he says the son of man says the son of man that's going to ascend up descended down he was born right here he's crazy unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he's a cannibal and he did that just to make them say those things can you imagine that he knew what they were going to say he knew who they were he says they had to do it talking about election my and so is the Holy Ghost today putting forth his word in manifestation yeah that men might condemn it so when we look at these things like Arizona news articles brothers and sisters he's done it for a purpose there's no accidents amen those people weren't acting out by accident those people were fulfilling the life that was inside of them the anointing struck that seed and they had to manifest the life that was in them just like those reporters who are coming against the message just like those other people who are coming against the message they have to they can't not do it and so is the Holy Ghost today putting forth his word in manifestation that men might condemn it that God might put his judgment upon the Earth as he promised he would do he hardened the heart of pharaoh Hallelujah he is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not he's God his systems of doing things shows himself Mighty with his word to manifest it he don't have to tell you all about it you don't have to figure out you can't figure it out you got to accept it just invite him in and see what happens anybody here ever done that you ever invite him in just to see what happens I guarantee you you will never ever be the same just invite him in and see what happens Brothers and Sisters Let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful that we still have the ability to invite
