we know we are gathered here this evening because you went to Calvary you chose to pay the price you walk the lonely way so that when your bride will walk they'll be accompanied by you and that is what brought us together this evening father we are here to honor you we are here to exalt your name we are here to say thank you we are here to commemorate that event we are here oh God to celebrate our freedom we are here to yield to you and say Lord have your way in our lives father we thank you for all these meetings O Lord we thank you for the way that you've manifested yourself in our midst oh Lord and this evening precious Lord we have just requests Lord let every purpose for which you started these meetings be fulfilled and as our children we say help us to only believe we appreciate you master thank you oh Lord for all that you have done for us be with us for the rest of the service in Jesus Christ name amen thank you to the Musicians um in order to keep you stand in we will go straight into the scriptures and I just want to say thank you very much for coming out on a Saturday evening knowing that there is services on Sunday and after three continuous services I believe you're already blessed by being here amen uh I want us to turn to mark 16. we believe it is inspired right because all scripture is inspired the School of Theology cannot tell us anything so the Lord has spoken in this end time so I'm reading Mark 16 and I'm reading from verse 9. um I'll go from 9 to 15. Mark 16 verse 9. now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils and she went and told them that had been with him as demand and went and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen Affair believed not after that he appeared in another form that's a lot right there he appeared in another form onto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it onto the residue neither believed the them afterward he appeared onto the 11 as they started meet and I braided them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him appear which has seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go into all the world and pray the gospel to every creature amen so he's holding them for their own belief and right away he's sending them that is scolding in family praise the name of the Lord and so let's read first Thessalonians 4. just one verse 16. very familiar verse first Thessalonians 4 16. for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first may the Lord had his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah so this is the fourth day of feasting in family feasting together as a family and I think a lot has been brought in very simple yet profound ways about the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ and this day and I for one I want to say like John of old you know on on Peter on Mount Transfiguration it is good to be here praise the name of the Lord it has been really really good I fed and I'm glad that I just took the time to to be a part of this and I say this if you missed what has gone on so far and even if you've been here but you've been distracted maybe you've been here but something just find time and listen to these things again because I believe they are spiritual food in due season is the Lord himself descended to commune with his children amen and I I see this that is what happens when leadership submits to headship praise the name of the Lord now the theme of these meetings was is he is risen he is risen and the hope is that something will be said something will be will be done here that'll point or at least remind us of the Risen Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah because there is no way for us to achieve that aim that purpose okay to get to that position that the Lord wants us if we don't meet the Risen Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and so yes um it started on Wednesday I think brother Gilbert brought the question and I believe everybody who was here at least since then has asked himself that question or attempted to answer what does the resurrection mean praise the name of the Lord now we know that we can never answer that question if we don't know where the victory was won Hallelujah and so then for the Toby brought it very beautifully the victory is not a Calvary but didn't get so many praise the name of the Lord now the thoughts of Gethsemane always brings something to to heart and it brings something to bite and that is the fact that Jesus prayed and he had a preference ultimately he surrendered his will to the father but he had a preference that preference was not answered or rather the answer was not what he preferred and I think that it puts our Christian Life in in such perspective that we don't get it because we want it we get it because it's his will and it's part of his plan and purpose for us Hallelujah and so I I really enjoyed that coming from Gethsemane and then brother Murphy came to tell Lucius all of that has been done but the resurrection was actually a victory it was a declaration of victory the Bible had already been fought but that picture was you and I praise the name of the Lord the motivation that led the Lord to the Cross was you and I I hope we don't take these things for granted and this evening what I'm trying to do right now is for the first time I'm trying to use the slides and so please bear with me Hallelujah and my topic as you can see there is identified by his deeds amen identified by his deeds now um I think Thursday started hitting some things and and and I loved it but you know I'm always mindful of the the young guys who spend time with me downstairs and I was thinking if only they catch it because it was a Thursday evening and he was saying it was a Night Like This when the crucifixion happened Hallelujah and and you know there is a question that I I didn't have it growing up but it has come up and for most people I would say it's difficult to answer and that is how to fit three days into Friday night to Sunday morning 15 three full days into sun Friday evening to Sunday morning and actually the the the the doors I'll see the critics actually quote the statement of Jesus when he said as the son of man was in the belly of the will for three days and three nights so shall as Jonah was in the belly of the wheel for three days and three nights so shall the son of man be and so the question has a reason and I've looked at it and there's no way I can fit three days and three nights into Friday evening to Sunday morning unless we go by the scriptural way Hallelujah because you see if and please all those people come along with me let me just talk to my young people for a little bit Hallelujah because you see when you take the scriptural way when you take God's definition then everything rounds perfect that's why I always say if there's a Bible question there has to be a Bible outside praise the name of the Lord but when you use this Roman Calendar that we have in which the day starts at 12 midnight so all the darkness into six o'clock all of that is still morning and then it goes on it doesn't fit but you see God defined a day and since the time God defined it there has not changed his mind we may be civilized and we have a system that works for us and there are all the good reasons and praise God for all of that but God has to change his mind and that is what we have to understand that when you have a Bible question there is a Bible answer in Genesis chapter one without exaggerating I think God defines a day at least six times when God created heaven and there was Darkness and then he called light and the scripture says he separated the darkness from the light the darkness he called Knights and the light he called day and then in verse 5 he says in the evening and the morning was the first day Now that statement what that statement carefully because he was going to repeat it in Genesis chapter one alone he repeats this I've missed six times in verse 5 in verse 8 in verse 13 in verse 19 and verse 23 in verse 31 he repeats the sins in the evening and the morning was the day and so in God's definition of a day it starts from the evening and it ends in the morning so in essence from sunset to Sunrise is the evening from sunrise to sunset is the morning and then the day is complete now if you watch carefully and if you go to Israel today not years ago no today when they celebrate their Sabbath it starts from the day that we call Friday evening and then it ends on the day that we call Saturday evening now I don't like using these days when I'm discussing this the Thursday Friday and Monday I don't use it because the moment I mention it it brings back the the the Roman Calendar that we are using and that is not God's calendar but you see when you look at the Jews you'll find God's calendar but even Among Us Gentiles the people who are use um the people who worship on Saturday not like The Seventh-Day Adventists the reforming Adventists historic adventures all these people their Sabbath begins on a Friday evening and it ends on a Saturday evening and so when you look at it like that you'll understand perfectly that it works well for the three days under consideration now if you permit me I want to say this that the three days we are dealing with is the preparation I'm using Bible language their preparation their Sabbath and the first day of the week three days preparations now the preparation was the day before the Sabbath not half the inoculated the whole day so 24 hours before the Sabbath and so the preparation became the day of the crucifixion and then the Sabbath was the day of rest and the first of the week which I believe has started now was the day of the Resurrection praise the name of the Lord and so when you look at it like that he died on the evening of the preparation Now understand it carefully the next morning was the morning of the preparation it was not the next day right so it's tasked on the evening of the preparation to the morning and then the next evening is the evening of the Sabbath to the morning and then the next evening is the evening of the first day of the week and then the born in three days three nights praise the name of the Lord now take your time I don't assume they're just talking about this like that night clarify it for everybody but take your time and considerate that the moment you start a day any day the Bible has said the evening and the morning was the day so if he died in an evening they have to come the morning before you go to the next day if you go into the Sabbath evening it starts morning and on and on praise the name of the Lord and so anyway I thought that I had to just clarify this especially for the young people that I I spend time with and so what our focus is to this morning or this evening is the period from the very first day from the first day of the week practically up till now Hallelujah because once he was risen the grief had no use anymore longer praise the name of the Lord and more important than that we were risen with him Hallelujah and so I just want to start by pointing out that yes um the professor fiction must have been difficult from that time the the crucifixion that the yeah the crucifixion and the Sabbath whilst they were waiting for the first day it has probably must have been some of the saddest days in the lives of these people the apostles the disciples and especially think of it the women who followed him From Galilee the scripture says they they ministered unto him and now they come here and they witnessed their lord their savior Man full of so much love and then so much hatred directed at him now he has spoken to them about it but they were overwhelmed by events and practically everything that they heard from him was sort of not on their mind at that point and so they witnessed the man that even before their eyes brought a dead man from Death To Life and now he's been crucified he's placed in the Tomb and a big Stone has been rolled over it and the stone is so big that they as the women cannot roll it and not just that it had been sealed so even if men are going to move it it will be unlawful right and so it sounds like that that barrier had been placed between man and his Lord and there was no way that they could get into it praise the name of the Lord and so as if the barrier is meant to keep them there forever but what happened was that the crucifixion was still forever even the weights longer it might it might have been was not forever the morning came I praise the name of the Lord the day of the Resurrection came and it was evident that the grave cannot no longer hold him praise the name of the Lord now once he was alive he has spoken about his crucifixion his burial his resurrection and now the word that he has spoken to them the time had come for it to be made manifest there was no power in hell to stop it because he had spoken already and and when I get to Junctions like this I just want to pause and let you know that the Lord has spoken about you and that is why you are here and the fact that he spoke about you means no power can stop it from happening praise the name of the Lord [Music] there are so many scriptures we can refer to that tells us that he spoke about us he thought about us and he spoke about us praise the name of the Lord and so like I said there's no power absolutely that can stop it and so nothing stopped him he had to come out and that was the time for him to declare his victory specifically to the bride the Bible had already been won their Resurrection was a declaration of Victory Hallelujah now for God to manifest that Resurrection not to manifest but to show it to us the stone had to be moved now remember we cannot move the stone and so the Lord had to move the stone praise the name of the Lord now remember who placed the stone there man plays the stone man plugged the assets of man to the Lord praise the name of the Lord but the Lord the love he had for us was deep it was great and so he moved the stone praise the name of the Lord now we have to understand that in our lives the things the impediments the difficulties not for us to move it's not for us to do it's for us to trust him to do it for us Hallelujah and not just that he has promised praise the name of the Lord now I just want to point out this that this tool was not removed for him to come out it was not for him that the stone was removed now if you remember correctly in John 20 I think they were guided that the disciples were guarded in a room and for few of the Jews the doors were locked the windows were closed and he came there and so this was at a point where no physical barrier was an impediment and that is the law that we served today for the Risen Lord Jesus Christ no stone no wall no but just came can stop him praise the name of the Lord all he did he needs from us is our willingness to welcome him praise the name of the Lord a lot of times we come here and we extend invitations but we have to be willing to welcome him praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah now when the stone was removed for the first time it gave us access to an empty tomb it's for us it gave us access to an empty tomb now you see we were going to deal with the situation from that day and that time until now there is a situation we don't have the physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ and so we're going to deal with a situation where we'll have to look at the evidence and belief praise the name of the Lord that's why it says blessed is he that has not seen and yet believed and so there's a blessing for people who see that evidence and not have the physical body and yet believe Hallelujah I will start reading this uh quotes in Jesus Christ the same yesterday to them forever 58 but Ram says the only way he would be any different would be a Corporal body talking about the Lord Jesus Christ and his core probability is at the right hand of the father's Throne making intercession Upon Our confession Hallelujah now that was my purpose but I just loved all that it says in addition and anything that he died for any attribute that his atonement called for it's our personal property Hallelujah of every believer to accept it and confess it as a finished work and receive it How Great Thou Art Hallelujah so the empty tomb was proved that life does not end in the Tomb the empty tomb was proof that there is a resurrection in life Hallelujah and so if you have that quickening power that was in the Lord Jesus Christ in you then it means the tomb cannot hold you it means there is not an absolutely that can stop you praise the name of the Lord so ages when you have that in you that is when you can say because he lives I live also Hallelujah now what they didn't realize was that at this point the ministry of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ was turned in a corner that the ministry was moving to a new phase it was moving to a face where we will not have the need to go to him but he was going to come to us Hallelujah and not just that he was coming to those that he knew before the foundation of the Earth praise the name of the Lord and so for that no barrier was going to stop him praise the Lord now remember he told them everything before it happened but it's just that the people were overwhelmed right and so let's read something here and this is John 16. yeah this is John 16 6. and this is part of the times and the instances when he was telling them about what was happening he said but because I've said these things unto you sorrow has filled your heart nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go and these are some of the things that uh oftentimes I say difficult for the natural mind to understand or accept this is the Lord who has been with them the Lord who has healed their diseases the Lord who has brought food for them the Lord who has encouraged them who has strengthened them who has changed their life and now he's going to leave them and he says it is expedient means it's beneficial it is to your advantage that I live what was he talking about well he tries to explain this for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if but if I depart I'll send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the word of sin and of righteousness and of judgment Hallelujah so the Lord began to sort of signal the change in the ministry it was going from a Ministry of him being with them to a minister where he'll be in them praise the name of the Lord and so he was going to be with them in them so when he talks about reprove the world of sin how is it going to do if he's done with them through his Believers Hallelujah of and of righteousness how through his Believers of judgment how through his Believers and so the simplest thing is this if you have received the Holy Ghost there's an assignment for you if you have received the Holy Ghost there is a work for you to do Hallelujah if you received the resurrected the Lord Jesus Christ then you are to represent and present the Lord Jesus Christ unto everybody you come in touch with praise the name of the Lord I'm not saying everybody is a preacher or everybody is a man but by your speech by addressing by your behavior by your actions by all of your life listen this is a Saturday evening of a holiday weekend there are so many things you could be doing now if you choose to be here by your priorities alone you are declaring a Risen Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so it's by the things we do consciously unconsciously our prioritize our priorities are made known Hallelujah and so like everything else he told them many many things about himself and he explained it to them but it's that they did not really get it or if they believe it it just escaped them by events that was happening now John 12 24 this is Jesus speaking he says very rarely I say unto you except of corn a corn of wheat fall into the ground now I saw this scripture yesterday except a crown of which fall into the ground and die either by death alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit Alleluia and so God was signaling how things were going to happen that the fullness of the godhead which was dwelled in one entity one body called the Lord Jesus Christ that is Paul that's not me dwelling in one body now was going to fall it was going to die but it was going to come up in as many people as can receive it praise the name of the Lord you see how expedient it was that he had to die Hallelujah so with that in mind he went to the cross yes brother sister he was thinking about us praise the name of the Lord and so what I see now is that the pain their sorrow the disappointment the cross Calvary all of that was just on the way from his glory to your hearts Hallelujah and so this is what it was now we could not pass through that there's a show of sort of there's a share of pain for us there's a sort of Heartache for us but we could not pass through what he passed through and so because we couldn't go to him he came to us that's the love you remember the barrier the stone the seal we couldn't move it Hallelujah and so he came to us praise the name of the Lord now in the spoken word is the Original Seed program says Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right now we all believed the Bajaj key and does not limit his power right Hallelujah is that right congregation says amen so you all believe that that is why he was God's word that's why he was God's word we destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same amen praise the name of the Lord his body is to do the same because their body is head and body is together that's right if Christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same then as his head was so in essence when you witness the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ what you are doing is that you'll become a means of like a witness and I'll go a little further that their body that Witnesses the resurrection pacifies of the Resurrection through all their life they testify of their Resurrection but you see the best testimony is when you are manifesting the Living Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah now you see if if if I don't know if you get some of them the the door-to-door salesman come to you but whatever products that you have you could see the ad on the internet you can see it on the billboard they could talk about it on radio and you could see it in a brochure it could be on the television you know multimedia whatever means but when the people come to you to you a very efficient salesman why they do they bring their product itself to you they don't come and tell you about the product they give you the products so regardless of all that you've seen now here is the product you can look at it you can try it like the car dealerships when they know you're serious they give you the key go and try it praise the name of the Lord and this is what is happening that the people who saw him resurrecting they testified of it now it doesn't matter that people didn't believe they testified all the same but you see that was a Prelude to something else that was going to happen Hallelujah and so when you look for the Risen Lord Jesus Christ today there are two things you have to do first look to your life to see if you find him praise the name of the Lord and if you don't find him look for him in your life find him in your life praise the name and once you have him you can share because this is what the Lord Jesus Christ requires that he desires to live in US remember that was God's purpose all the way from the Garden of Eden praise the name of the Lord to the extent that he be created now he's not abandoned his purpose no I weakness does not stop him and that purpose will be fulfilled and it's in fulfillment right now so in that sense when you accept the revelation of his appearing you are accepting a battle because you are accepting a vessel through which the Lord resurrected Lord Jesus Christ will manifest himself to destroy the works of the devil now that sounds like a big thing are we going to battle no but you see every time that you live right everything that you do that is scriptural is a condemnation to deviance simple live your life the way you want to live it be who you want to be according to scripture and already you are destroying the works of the devil sister look at how you are dressed when you are coming here couldn't you find a nice tight pants that will show all your shape and leave nothing to imagination no you don't want it why if that is all that we have around us why would you do that this is the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ already manifesting himself praise the name of the Lord I have to say this all the same it doesn't matter it's not it's not it's not part of the I don't have it on my nose but listen brother sisters people in marriage have accepted that divorce is an option that is the LIE of the devil and I am saying this without sincerity in my heart it hurts what I'm saying is this when if somebody comes here and they have a testimony doesn't it energize you and when you sit here with somebody and they step out there and they start thinking that they can do whatever oh I have a coach that's a court nullify the vowel you went before the Lord and you spoke and you said I love you I'll protect you and on and on for better for word for good and bad until death the worst part whose file was that you gave that vow and suddenly I have a quote that nullifies all the vow I didn't plan it but it hurts me and I feel that if I talk about it maybe I'll be able to go on all right this is not right and and okay there's a part where the brown blames the ministers and I want to tell you this at least I've said it today and so have it regardless of who lives what and what happens the word of God is the same and in Ecclesiastes he actually says that he's not interested in the vows of fools that you are good if you don't vow you are free if you don't commit yourself forgive me for talking about extremes she has a gun pointing to my heart it's my head it's no reason for divorce he's going to punch me and beat me it's no reason for divorce it's absolute is the word of God and in Malacca he says he hates divorce that is the Lord we serve please understand this it's wrong don't I will be abusive and rude if I use the words that I really want to use I don't believe any preacher who tells you that Lord revealed to me this is one statement that I'm saying that I'm not ashamed and I'll be able and willing to repeat it for the rest of my life don't believe any preacher who tells you that it's not in this Bible from Genesis to revelation God never ever permitted one person to divorce oh Muslims permitted well one Moses permitted the Lord will not even hear their prayers read in Malachi is that because of that I will not hear the prayers you will bring all your everything I want to hear it and in the New Testament he says the same thing even that he says brother treat her well so that your prayers are not hindered and by the way the vow that we say this this is taking me time more than I thought The Vow that we say is not just to stay married it's deeper than that you actually commit yourself to a lot that's why I want Jesus prayed marriage and divorce I think in Matthew 19 ultimately when he preached married and divorced even the disciples had done it's not good to marry think of it yeah yeah think of it please we can stand here and talk about all the deepness and everything I also love them but let's do the simple things look not one not two people here that we know that I've sat here and then they get out there and and that's it it's as if nothing happened here forgive me I'll just keep going but this this thing really came came to me I I didn't know what to do Hallelujah so like I think a battle with the devil sounds serious but actually what is happening is that we are called to be there to commit to the devil and let the Lord fight the battle Hallelujah it does not depend on us and that is for us as long as we can accept what he does for us praise the name of the Lord a little bit because yesterday I saw that scripture and when I saw it right there I was sitting there it spoke to me and so I just want to uh look at it for now yes it says because you see Peter had a lot of zeal Peter had a lot that he was very determined and he had Zeal and he was committed to do it but Jesus also knew that all our Zeal doesn't do much if the spirit of the Lord is not in US and so brother sister when you meet a Ministry that is telling you get the Holy Ghost just listen and and it's not like you can do a great way to get the Holy Ghost no ask the Lord believe and the most important and let him feel welcomed Hallelujah because we pray and we invite him over and over and over again but will he be pleased with the life I live will he be pleased with all these naked women pictures on my wall will he be pleased with all the lies that I am I'm telling and I'm living will he be pleased when I'm deceiving somebody so over and over check your life and let him feel welcomed that is all it takes praise the name of the Lord now um and so watch this and I'm reading a Matthew 26 14. and he comes on to his disciples and finded them asleep and save unto Peter now watch this he came unto his disciples plural he found them Ashley plural and then he spoke to Peter Hallelujah because he knew the man he knew his Zeal and he knew what was going to happen very soon but he wanted to encourage him he wanted to strengthen him he wanted to keep him in the fault and so he said unto me that what Colina watch with me one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into that so he's beginning to give him tips for the life's journey right and so he speaks to them he speaks to him now elsewhere if you remember he speaks specifically to Peter and he says the devil has sought to have you and to sift you like weights Hallelujah and he says I have prayed for you praise the Lord as I'm thinking of it I'm thinking of the two programs right the devil has a program Jesus has a program and when I'm thinking that you are here right now because he has prayed for you Hallelujah now if you doubt it go back into the Old Testament the son of David Solomon when he dedicated the temple he prays for Israel and prays for this he gets to a point where he prays for us but that was only a Prelude to what Jesus was coming to do in John 17. he prayed for us and that is why we are here so regardless of what happens be conscious not because of your feeble effort but because of what he has done for us and take courage let's be confident praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah and so the Lord knew that what was ahead requires more than zeal praise the name of the Lord and so as time comes one is difficult the time for the crucifixion is closed and the Lord is speaking to them he says oh all of you shall be offended in me today and Peter says no way not be Lord I'll be with even my life I'll give it for you and Jesus says the cork will not Crow twice you'll deny me Thrice and it happened exactly as Jesus said and so what I'm saying is this that when he did that he lied his way out of being a disciple of Jesus Christ now they were all offended but he specifically denied three times in front of witnesses no I don't even know the man and so it wasn't that the Lord has pushed him out but he had lied his way out and the devil was right there to tell him no you're no more worthy you don't deserve anything look at what you've done The Man Who Loved You look at what you've done to him and on and on and on but you see when Jesus rose up Hallelujah he said go and tell my disciples and Peter [Applause] Drawing the Line bigger bringing Peter back into the phone Hallelujah that is the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord now one of the differences in the change of ministry was that at this point it was moving from a very public Ministry to a very personal Ministry it was moving from a point of big uh meetings and great healing campaigns and now it was coming to one or none individualized Hallelujah now the aspect of this individualized uh relationship also to speak a personalized Ministry was that you only recognizing fresh when it appears to you but more than that he has to reveal himself to you so he appears and he reveals himself to you Hallelujah and how does he do it he reveals by a sign he reveals by something that you know about him something that is very unique something that will make you recognize that is him and he does that to only the people of his own Chosen and I believe this is what brought us today you're here today because that is what we do here hallelujah now let's read this uh let's look at this uh quotes here when their eyes were opened they knew him that's 1964. now here is truth if he has risen from the dead then he promised that God will be made known in human flesh now think of it that is one thing that we have always rejected this is this one thing that Humanity has always rejected we are okay with a God who is spiritual we are okay with a God who is some but that human standing by me whose trust like the way I sweat who maybe as Jesus was working some of them could even run better than Jesus or do some heavier work than him and then to accept that that man is Jesus Christ it becomes difficult and so throughout history when God manifests in flesh only those who are ordained see it Hallelujah he said but watch brother Abraham and now I see why I he said now no matter how much he anoints me watch this now the God must investing in flesh is now happening he says no matter how much he anoints me you've got to be Anointed with faith to believe it and so this is where the problem comes a man with all his weaknesses and shortfalls and to say that God is manifesting through them then you are making the man God Hallelujah so he said it takes both of us the woman that touched His Garment she had to believe she would have went on by see he would have went on on by see she had to believe it see it's God then he goes into another Direction where he says now if somebody thinks a gift is a great big knife God gives you a gift you can take it and slice it and do what you've got the wrong conception of a gift a gift is knowing how to get yourself out of the way that is how he anoints you right you get yourself out of the way and let God do what he wants to do see is knowing how to relax yourself that God can use you in the way that he wants to just get yourself out of the way see and so what is happening when it comes to our Salvation our healing when it comes to the Lord's dealing with his bride he does not leave it to anybody it does not leave it to the great Angel whoever he does not give in to the Archangel and the terrorists know he does it himself praise the name of the Lord but then he uses humans for that purpose Hallelujah and so in that sense Jesus like the scripture we read he appeared to Mary first after the resurrection and he spoke to her but she didn't recognize him until he called her by name and once he called her by his name that opened her eyes praise the name of the Lord then he appeared to the two their way to uh emails and they did not recognize him until he broke the bread now what a man has been with you brother Brahms is for six hours he preached them and what I love about that story is that it says that beginning from Moses and the prophets Hallelujah now for the young people you know there is the law that is Moses and there's a Prophets now uh the Poetry or wisdom was not part of scripture and the history was also not part of so Kings and all those was not part of it so in essence he took the entire scripture because Old Testament is about to is not yet written and so scripture was the law and the prophets and so he took all of it and for six hours he tied all the Loose Ends Hallelujah he said oh the Loose Ends and he was talking to them about himself praise the name of the Lord now we say this so that when it happens again we know that is the Lord Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord now in Mark 16 he appeared onto the 11 apostles and most of whom had had the resurrection but they had not believed yet and that is key for us to know that just the fact that you testified somebody did not accept it does not mean they cannot accept it later just pray for them don't just throw them over their own Believers that they pray for them and believe Hallelujah but you see when they have received the testimony and they had not believed it what has happened is that they had missed that blessing because blessed is he who else believes who has and yet not seen Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and so I would say this that that blessing is still wait was still waiting right it was still waiting for a people who will believe even when they had not seen and if you if you're a Bible student you understand that I'm talking about Gentile Faith right now that is not for the Jews that is Gentile faith now I'm not going to go in today but we know that the ones that don't need the law to come to them the one that don't need hands laid on those are the Gentiles and that is the people that we are Hallelujah and so these things are in scripture for us to know and understand our call praise the name of the Lord man now when you see or when you believe even when you've not seen what you are saying is God is faithful because what you are holding on is this word that he has told you and the Lord laughs to be seen as faithful now go over all the messages anytime Abraham will discern and say this is it was that the truth you have to confirm and say that God is faithful and then you receive praise the name of the Lord now Mary became a witness now it's not as if she had not seen that they had brought back to life before Lazarus was her brother and so she has seen it before but when she experienced this Resurrection she became a witness but the people did not believe now why am I saying this I'm saying that sister you also have a role to play oh it's true and I believe with all my heart uh you you shouldn't be a preacher and all that but this message calls you the pastor of the house Hallelujah and there is nothing stopping you from sharing your testimony and sometimes some of these Testaments are more powerful than all the scriptures that we can read Hallelujah and so you also have a role to play now according to the story of the two people who were going to immerse is the same thing that Mary had witnessed to them and they had not believed yet And yet when their eyes was opened nobody could stop them from testifying Hallelujah and so this is what I'm saying that his works identify him because the people that he appeared to were people who had had an encounter with him there were people who had met him before and so they couldn't identify him by the way that he did by the distance I'm not talking about miracles here calling Mary by name is not a miracle or breaking bread is not a miracle but that experience with them that encounter with them is what brought these people to the recognition that here it is that is him Hallelujah so he identified himself by his worst Hallelujah and so his ethnic Ministry had become a testament of his presence Hallelujah and this is what I'm saying that when you witness it again you know and understand that he is here praise the name of the Lord so in Matthew 26 about sorry Matthew 11 2 and yes it talks about Elijah well John and this John is John the Baptist he says now when John had heard in prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples understand it what brought this encounter he sent two offices at he head of his works and so the works identify him and like I said The Works doesn't mean Miracles at least the ones we've seen so far of his appearing before people were not Miracles by the way unique they were distinctive it spoke about him Hallelujah and so John had heard in prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto them how thou he who should come or do we look for another Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which he do hear and see now watch this carefully Hallelujah because he was going to even to the prophet he was going to identify himself by his deeds he says the blind Sea and the lame walk and the lepers are cleansed and the death here and the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel pray to them and blessed is he who is not offended because of me Hallelujah in our generation have we witnessed a similar Ministry praise the name of the Lord remember the works identify him have we witnessed a ministering with their blind sea have we went with us a worldwide Ministry that you cannot fault and with the lame walk in with the death here in which the dead is raised back to life in this congregation in which the cancer is healed can we identify the Lord Jesus Christ now praise the name of the Lord because there has been a Ministry that is unparalleled in Christian history and we hear the stories and and a lot of times we hear from childhood and we get used to it we get almost desensitized praise the name of the Lord so can you identify him by his works praise the name of the Lord and that is what we are called to do we will see Jesus 1962. it says God and that is Barbara I'm praying God will you do it tonight again do something among us tonight Lord just like you did it before your crucifixion then we will have confidence and know that our Christ is not dead by his risen from the dead and it's alive here Among Us forevermore Hallelujah and so even brother Abraham was looking for that deed the Deeds that identify him praise the name of the Lord so those are things that you don't take for granted now as I'm saying this I'm sort of limiting myself because all of this were done before he came to live in them all the things that we are talking about where he's appearing it was not his coming yet his coming was when he came to live in them Hallelujah but why my question is has he appeared in this generation and that's what I want us to recognize praise the name of the Lord now Abraham comments on Luke 17 30. he comments on Luke 17 30 he says that is inconvinced and then consent he says I believe the Church of Jesus Christ is a called out group that's been Sanctified by the blood of Jesus and set aside for service I believe this thing that we as we see doing is the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ in our midst now take note is 1962 right and he said remember in the days of Sodom that was a man standing there that could eat and drink but it was God in the man showing that God would appear in the last days in the form of human flesh in his church which is his bride Madame this church has a capital letter all right praise the name of the Lord and they will do the same thing he did amen and so this is what has happened that when he comes he does the same thing my prayer is Lord let it be in me praise the name of the Lord let it be in my life Hallelujah now let's read this the end time evangelism 62. it says same thing today when you see his work now we've already seen and are witnessing the appearing of the Lord now remember appearing and coming is two different words to appear and then to come now is the appearance he's already appeared in these last days right here with us in the last few years now it's a sign of his coming right when you see the appearance is a sign of his coming now all the things that we've spoken of so far about his appearance it didn't take too much like within like at Pentecost he came and so the appearance is a sign of his coming his appearance in his church in the form of the Holy Spirit showing that it's him praise the name of the Living God when you say in the form of the Holy Spirit showing that it's him it could mean anything but he continues because people cannot do these things that you see the Holy Spirit doing so that's the appearing of the Lord so if you're somebody who follows this message you know exactly what he's talking about so now remember he spoke both places apparent and coming now he upgraded them because of their their Hardness of Heart because they didn't believe those who had seen it I believe he'll do the same today so yeah I just want to pause and say this there are two people there are those who witness the resurrection and there were those who were told but they were both supposed to believe and those who did not believe even though they were told they were upgraded which means they were scolded for it it doesn't mean that they were rejected no it's just a family thing right praise the name of the Lord and I said after they have they didn't believe the testimony of those people and he upgraded them for it and then he commissioned them to go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature and he would be with them to the consummation to the consummation the end of the world these signs shall followed them that believed Hallelujah and so what was happening is that he was going to come in them as they go and so the appearing in itself was not enough he had to come before they could do it now if you follow scripture correctly yes all this appearance happened but they both just to testify came after the day of Pentecost Hallelujah now um with some of the people that we spend I spent time with downstairs we've discussed the Messianic sign and we've discussed how it happens to the Jews well the Jews got their sign and the Samaritans got the assigned and the Gentiles did not get a sign until now and and it wasn't really a topic that I wanted to discuss but we We Came Upon it because we're just discussing the ministry of Elisha and in the ministry of Elijah there was such a manifestation that at some point the king of Syria had to pause his top brass military people and say enough no more military plans no more battle plants until I know who is leaking our information to the king of Israel because if there's no use planning when as soon as we are done you are going to go and tell that so who is in charge but you see there was a man there who knew a little more about life than Syria and so the man said oh relaxing there is no snitch Among Us that's the language of my boys and so I said oh there's no spy Among Us it's Elisha in Dothan who is telling you the things you are saying in your in your bed chamber Hallelujah in Damascus Hallelujah and so and and this I I just mentioned this for us to understand that that's Messianic sign has been associated with the ministry of the Elijah spirit now what happened is that all the previous comments had to do with Jews and so with Jews God is dealing with them as a nation and so maybe it happened once maybe it happened twice but with us Gentiles he's dealing with us as individuals and so over and over again it happened night after night place after place all around the world this mechanic sign was displayed everywhere and and I I I can spend the whole night talking about that but I just want us to read just one quote here now remember I have to turn it down I always forget now just let's consider this coach and see how it ends and that is what matters to me most and and will be closing very soon brother says he assists a man sitting here his head down crying praying for himself and also for his wife she isn't here hallelujah now you're talking to a man there first of all you know what the man is praying about and then you know where what is happening what I said she's not with you this afternoon She's suffering you think God could tell me what her trouble is and hair not here so it is diagnosing from far he said you believe it you do I'm a stranger to you is that right your wife has a female trouble if that's right raise up your hand say hi so they will see it and your name is Mr Smith so diagnose the wife and now come to talk to the man do you believe that God will make her well and if that's right wave your hand up and down like this and then look at Batman says I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body Hallelujah and says accept his call praise the name of the Lord now I accept that a lot of the course has to do with the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ that revelation of his appearance and that actually was my topic until the meeting started and that's that went on it changed and he changed until now we have identified by his deeds now I want us to read this because I once made a preacher and and and this was a Street Preacher and I met him I was I just believed the message and I met when this Street Preacher was saying that Jesus was God and for me who has who had just believed the message it was amazing this this was back in in Ghana it was amazing to hear that so I went to sit down and this is the scripture that he was using and so I'll just just go through quickly he says for he commanded this is Psalm 107 verse 25 to 29 and his emphasis was on 29 say for he come he commanded the he commanded and raises the storm the stormy wind which lifted up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the deaths their soul is melted because of trouble they are real to and fro and started like a drunken man and uh at the end of their way so this is a desperate situation when Sublime they don't know what to do and he says then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distress he make the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still and so this preacher mentions this and then he goes back to the story of the Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament and then he he preaches about the the disciples with the Lord in the boat and how the wind come and the Storm come and the waves and is and and they are desperate they don't know what to do and then they go and wake the Lord Jesus Christ and then he stands up and Rebrand says he pulls himself together and he speaks softly and say please be still and so he reads all this story and then he says you see that's the only one who can calm the storm and so I was so I was fascinated by just this man and what he was doing and I was really excited now that was then I didn't know that the Lord Jesus Christ identified himself like that again today and so when we talk of the Risen Lord Jesus Christ this is good to know what he did in history but what he has done today matters to us Hallelujah now in in testimony verbraham speaks of a situation I think he had been to Canada he had been to Canada he went hunting and then he's going back and he goes to Colorado and he takes some ministers and they go hunting and so uh it was announced that there was going to be a blizzard and Brown says this blizzard is it's powerful if if you are caught in it says in a matter of hours you could get up to 30 feet of snow and you perish in there he uses that word and so he see he they mentioned it and then all the people say we are not living so everybody is leaving but the people brother Abraham is working with Anna living and so he said okay then you can go out you are doing your hunting and everything he says this first sign of rain rushed back to the camp he said the first sign because in 15 minutes you won't know your way back to the camp and you'll perish and so he speaks he tells them this and he himself goes out but at some point he shoots a buck and it drops somewhere and by then it looks like the blizzard was starting so he goes in further to the top of the mountain he looks for the back he doesn't find the back and then he's leaving like all normal human beings do there's a blizzard coming it's going to kill you so you run away and so he's going he's going and and I'm trying to cut this shot so we'll finish very soon and then he hears a voice that says go back where you come from Hallelujah now what about Abraham says I says sometimes God makes us do things that seem very dangerous and out of line Hallelujah and so he trains he looks at the blizzard and everything and there is noise and everything maybe I just heard it he turns to go and then he cannot go and then he hears the voice again go back and so then he turns and he walks into the blizzard and so he goes into the blizzard and he goes right to where he was and then he fits down his drenching there is wind that it's cloudy it's gloomy there is sleet there is hail and he sits down he's thinking what am I doing here and as he thinks that the voice comes against I am the Lord God I've created the heavens and earth nature obeys me Hallelujah and so when he hears that he says he tries to find the pillar of Fire because every time that he's Heard a Voice like that Airness of the Lord he sees the pillow of fire with it and this is very notable that I found in that story so he looked for the for the pillar fire and he does not find it and he says Lord where are you and he gets no answer and then it says again I am the Lord God that had you speak to those squirrels into existence Hallelujah and so that is the part that when it says that it's gone from the the Lord who created heaven and earth to the Lord who made you speak those questions now I'm sure you all know the story of this squirrels hunting and wanting squirrels and it's it's not squirrel season and uh thinking about the scripture if you say to this mountain let it move and you don't doubt and then the angel coming to teach him the angel coming to tell him yeah it's part of the atonement that a man could be so surrendered that the Lord will use his lips to speak Hallelujah that the Lord will use his lips to speak and so the god that the angel teaches him a little bit of these things and then after a while he says speak whatever you want and Brian says he says there are no specific people here hallelujah sorry so there are no sick people here and doesn't know what and then the The Voice actually tells him you are hunting you want squirrels and so then he speaks and the way he said the spirit shall come and where they should go Weddle and he'll shoot them it happened exactly but the part that interests me is that in that at that time and this is what happens he looked for the pillar fire and he did not find it I'm I'm I'm just I'll just leave you to make your conclusions here I I won't speculate when I'm talking about these things but when on on on on in the storm he looked for the pillar of fire the Lord was speaking to him he looked for the pillow fight he did not find it now when he says I am the Lord that uh made you speak the screw us into existence that time acts well he looked for the pillar of fire he did not find it and then he spoke not the only other thing about it is this that when he spoke he did not say that says the Lord I'll just leave that to you when he spoke he did not say that says the Lord Hallelujah and so then and we're going on with with this story about the the other one is then on that very hour okay now okay then on that very hour it spoke again to that very same time sitting up there and he said I am the one that stood on the ship that night and made the winds and the waves to seize and said rise up on your feet and rebuke the storm and it will obey exactly what you say what am I saying is songs and then just has come to bring it to manifestation but all of that were to Jews and Samaritans and now there's a Ministry manifesting that same thing again [Music] [Applause] and it says it won't be revealed to everybody but it's people of his own chosen and this is why we are talking about the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ at this point Hallelujah and so I'll just let Abraham continues and standing there at that time I raised up and I and I said Lord God great creator of nature I believe that that's you speaking not one time have you ever showed me anything that was wrong and one not one time have you let me say anything but what's come to pass I said therefore I say to this storm that's a region go to your places go back leave this alone and I command that the sun will shine for the next four days so these men can dedicate their trophies and I can help them get them and get out of these mountains and the Lord God who is my Southern judge this morning that rain and things twisting within a moment time there wasn't a bit of it I looked and there was a wind come from the other way across the top of the mountain and lifted up those clouds like that within just a matter of a few minutes the sun was broke up right through the top shining right down just as pretty as it could be Hallelujah the hill stopped their sleeves their sleet stopped and so what I'm saying is that in this end time the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ has appeared in this ministry of Malachi 4. and not just appearing but he has revealed himself to his Gentile bride Hallelujah now um the unveiling of God this is 1964. he says and Jesus said to that and Jesus said that to weed down the crowd yeah yes and I and my father and one and that things that he says that anoints people and they leave him he says see till he could get their group together and out of those people they only 11 of them then understood actually who he was they know that he was God and God Alone and then he says now my subject this morning is to reveal and unveil that God Hallelujah so what God was that God was manifesting himself through the Lord Jesus Christ because that is the Lord Jesus Christ they were looking at and that's the largest person who stumbled many and they left and that's the Lord Jesus Christ at the 11 saw and recognized that he was God and here is a man a Malta man a sinner saved by grace standing and saying my Ministry of that's a different court it's not here since my Ministry is to declare that he is here praise the name of the Lord and so if you believe that you are a bread of the Lord Jesus Christ then I think that you are placing on you the duty to believe all of the message because listen the Bible mentions the bride it doesn't say it is you and I praise the name of the Lord but the Lord himself descends with a message and declares that you and I are the bride now if we can accept that do we have to ignore the other things that message says praise the name of the Lord because you see the moment you accept that you are right you are again admitting that God is faithful and so we all have a duty to believe everything he tells you drew through those same lips that declared as his bride Hallelujah I believe we are here because he called us and I believe that he's more aware of our weaknesses and shortfalls than we do and so he calls us in spite of our weaknesses Hallelujah is there anything that is going to stop him from fulfilling his purpose in our lives the stone didn't they feel they didn't what do you think what can you find that was stopping from fulfilling his purpose we just have to understand this that there are no circumstances in our life that he does not know things happen in our heart beats and we are afraid and we are scared and we don't know what to do yes those things are meant to have that effect on us but after all that if we look to him we are saying that you are greater than these things and the Lord laughed knowledge by his right this is the name of the Lord Hallelujah I will call the musicians now what I want to bring to your attention again is that these people and we read it who heard that he's risen and disbelieved he still sent them anyway but of course they were not going to go until he has come in them and to understand it that there is nothing that will stop him if he's revealed himself to you today if it's confirmed to you that he is the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ today yes it happened in Bible times we all agree but when he calls you and shows himself to you I'll tell you this 99 of the world don't know that so he's done that to a people of his own children and that people that great people that we are talking is you and I it's true we may not see it now but that is what is happening and so it's for us to embrace our call it's for us to accept our call because there's a private discussion going on between God and his pride that's a private interaction people don't know that is going on these things that I'm saying even talk about this like are you making him God I believe you understand that I'm talking about a sinner saved by grace but he was just God's choice to talk to me in essence he was a servant of my father it's not about making somebody or raising somebody no no no God decided to make a choice and all that he's done to us is explain the word and then reveal it to us hallelujah now I just want to talk to you about one final instant and I'm surprised I didn't mention it but I see it in my nose now and so I'll just mention this Jesus showed himself to his disciples in the sea of tiberias if if if you remember he went to them they are all given up hope they are gone fishing and Jesus comes and says oh children have you found anything and they said no he said drop your net on the right side now I'm not sure the responsive would have received today they've been prison all night you think they didn't drop that no and they obey it and then when they obeyed they got so much fish that they couldn't pull why am I saying this because when that happened among all the disciples there was one of them that was John and Barbara tells us he represents the bride correct when that happened John looked they did had happened he looked and he told the rest it's the Lord Hallelujah what I'm saying is we have a call to identify the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and we are to identify him by his teeth praise the name of the Lord and then we have to let it manifest in our own lives because that is what he says to do in US he rose to live in US he didn't sanctify a place where we can go to and find him maybe a Mecca that we could go to know he didn't get a temple where we could go to his desire from the foundation of the Earth has been to live in our hearts all we need to do is let him feel welcomed so I will be on our feet [Applause] he abides [Music] I'm rejoicing night and day [Music] and there is [Music] yeah bye foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] sins [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] all my night was [Music] goodbye [Music] [Music] to him Hallelujah what a tremendous message tonight that was not brother Emmanuel speaking to us tonight and you know many people would say well brother Berry how could that be anyone else but you know we just believe we believe the word of God for our day and that's the that's the identification of the comforter abiding in US many people will say well brother Barry hold on a second I've got the Holy Ghost but do you believe the entirety of the message of the hour that is the true identification it's not about the first puller the second pull it's not about seeing great signs and wonders and miracles that's not it at all it's all about the word the opening of the word my goodness what a tremendous what a tremendous lesson tonight he's identified by his deeds and you know brothers and sisters it's not about his deeds in church we're all perfect Christians right here who are we with our families and our homes have we got a temper like a buzz saw brother Bradham talks about that he says it many times do we look at the things we shouldn't look at do we say the things we shouldn't say my goodness we're identified by our Deeds we're identified by the life that we live I just uh I just so enjoyed that tonight I feel fired up and I I think I could preach right now but I don't want to do that we have a service tomorrow we don't want to keep you here I know brother Jerry he wants that three-hour service how many others want a three-hour service tonight my goodness oh my let's just bow in prayer as we close our gracious Heavenly Father we're so thankful we know that we've heard from you tonight Lord we could say that we've heard from a man but Lord Jesus we know that's your choice we know that that's your your your chosen Direction father many people would say that we follow a man William Mary and Branham but we follow you because he pointed to you and if anyone would ever take the time to listen to what that man said they would be forced to say that he pointed to you and father we're so thankful that we have been given the ability to listen to what he said not to just scoff it and say oh it's some man you're just following a man Lord Jesus we know that you have used a man in every single age and the entire scaffolding all of the church is resting on what you gave Paul to send to the church to the Gentile church it's all about speaking to man through man and we're so thankful father that you've given us years to hear Lord Jesus tonight we pray that you would just keep your hand upon each one of us as we go our separate ways we thank you for your traveling mercies upon us when we travel thank you for watching over those who are traveling Lord father we're just so thankful for your goodness to us Lord and we pray that you would just take us home Lord give us rest help us to ponder the things that were spoken tonight Lord Jesus wow there's so many so many things Lord Jesus I just pray that you would just help us Lord to consider what you've spoken we just asked now that you would go with us as we go our separate ways father bring us back in the morning once again father to sit at your feet to hear from you once again if it Be Your Will but even better than that father oh Lord Jesus we earnestly look for that day of the resurrection and Rapture father who knows what time that could happen we know that your Prophet told us you you spoke through your Prophet to us and you said there's nothing else left for the Gentile church but for a Rapture and Lord Jesus we look forward to that great day and we know it could be any moment now we just ask Lord that you would be glorified in all that said and done Lord Jesus in our thoughts in our speech father in everything that we do let it be glorifying to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we just sing The Potter's hand tonight as we dismiss I won't keep you long we'll just sing one song and pray that you
