[0:12] I was walking down New Cave N where the
[0:19] seed of Abraham
[0:22] poses that
[0:26] land. I saw old Caleb walking
[0:31] sweetly by when he spoke. This was a
[0:36] fate I like to
[0:39] serve. Give me this
[0:42] mountain. I come to take
[0:46] it. You see this mountain is my
[0:51] heritage.
[0:53] I heard God's
[0:55] prophet when he made that
[0:59] promise. When I said amen, that mountain
[1:03] became mine.
[1:08] Now we are living in the end of days. We
[1:14] will send the evening light to hide
[1:21] away. Just like old Caleb, let us walk
[1:26] by faith. Let us take your promises and

[2:49] unchanging word that I face the enemy to
[2:55] play
