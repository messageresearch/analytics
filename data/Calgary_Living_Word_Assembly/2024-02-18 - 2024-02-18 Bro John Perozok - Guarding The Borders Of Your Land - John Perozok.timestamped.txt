[55:16] the Lord in prayer Lord
[55:19] Jesus Lord You're our faithful heavenly
[55:23] father and you're the one that we look
[55:25] to Lord You're the the one that we can
[55:27] just if we can just turn our eyes on you
[55:29] Lord in this moment Lord look full in
[55:32] your wonderful face all the things Lord
[55:34] that's not a light that if we look at
[55:36] the sun it might blind us but if we look
[55:38] into you Lord all the things of the
[55:40] world grow dim Lord and and if we look
[55:43] and we keep on looking Lord the promises
[55:45] of God come to pass sometimes we have to
[55:47] hold on to it and keep looking but they
[55:50] come Lord Jesus Lord we come Lord be
[55:52] merciful heal the sick The Afflicted
[55:55] Lord Lord You've atoned for these things
[55:57] at Calvary and Lord we we know that our
[55:59] personal property our inheritance Lord
[56:01] we we're starting to walk in that more
[56:03] and more recognizing the place that we
[56:06] stand in the Holy Ghost Lord I pray we
[56:08] could come and explore the land a little
[56:10] bit more and find where we need to
[56:12] overcome find where we need to guard
[56:13] ourselves find where we can just buckle
[56:16] up a little more Lord be with us now may
[56:18] the Holy Spirit take the word and you'd
[56:20] pack the message get me out of the way
[56:22] Lord I can't but you can and pray take
[56:24] this speaker the hearer every single one
[56:26] Lord here in Jesus
[56:29] name
[56:30] amen well God bless you thank you to the
[56:33] Musicians the specials and brother Fen
[56:36] the sister that sang that's one of my
[56:38] that song where would I be I I I've
[56:40] loved that song in the last month or two
[56:42] where would we be if it wasn't for the
[56:44] grace of God Isaiah if we can turn to
[56:48] Isaiah chapter 60 we'll just read a
[56:51] couple different scriptures Isaiah
[56:53] second Timothy and then
[56:55] maybe we'll just sit and I'll I'll I'll
[56:57] read something from the Psalms and we'll
[56:58] start
[56:59] but Isaiah chapter 60 and I'll title
[57:02] this this morning guarding the borders
[57:05] of your
[57:07] land guarding the borders of it's your
[57:10] land so let's guard the borders that are
[57:13] around it I'll take some thoughts it's
[57:15] it's I've different things I've spoken
[57:18] and maybe this is coming together from
[57:19] different things that I've spoken in the
[57:21] last while and even some experiences we
[57:22] went through last year and we're in a
[57:25] great battle we're in a battle of where
[57:28] there's crisises around us more than
[57:30] ever before there's people that struggle
[57:32] there's people that strive the the Mind
[57:34] battles that we have even are greater
[57:36] than ever before and I believe that our
[57:38] mind is our inheritance even our bodies
[57:41] Our inheritance there's places that
[57:43] God's laid out in this great Promised
[57:44] Land There are our
[57:46] inheritance we want to overcome every
[57:48] part of it and we want to guard the
[57:50] borders of it keep all the Devils back
[57:53] no matter what would come amen amen
[57:55] Isaiah chapter 60 whe the brandom would
[57:58] take this and parts of this or maybe all
[58:00] of this in the message
[58:02] Shalom
[58:04] arise verse one Shine for thy light is
[58:07] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[58:10] upon thee Hallelujah for behold Darkness
[58:13] shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness
[58:16] the people but the Lord shall arise upon
[58:19] thee and His glory shall be seen upon
[58:21] thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy
[58:24] light and Kings to the brightness of thy
[58:27] Rising now I believe Jesus would say
[58:30] that I am the light of the world but
[58:31] then he would say ye are the light of
[58:33] the world Amen because if if his light
[58:36] is gone and he's not just gone he's he's
[58:38] in at the sitting at the right hand of
[58:39] the throne there's a place that light
[58:41] still has to be and that's in you and
[58:43] it's in me Hallelujah second
[58:46] Timothy 1 verse
[58:49] 7 a familiar scripture but I I think an
[58:52] ever important scripture in the day that
[58:54] we live in
[58:55] second Timothy
[59:04] 1 this is the great battle that we face
[59:07] in our
[59:08] day for God hath not given us the spirit
[59:12] of fear but of power and of love and of
[59:17] a sound
[59:19] mind God bless you you can have your
[59:21] seats guarding the borders of your land
[59:25] uh this scripture jumped out of me in
[59:26] Psalms CH 37:3 and it says trust in the
[59:30] Lord and do good amen so shalt thou
[59:33] dwell in the land and verily shalt thou
[59:36] be fed and this morning by God's grace
[59:39] I'd like to take this thought looking
[59:41] some pulling some thoughts brother
[59:42] Brandon would maybe bring from the
[59:43] adoption message or Paradox or or even
[59:46] Shalom and maybe some from the greatest
[59:48] battle ever fought but looking at as we
[59:50] come into the land that God's given us
[59:53] in this message of the hour
[59:55] there's places to overcome and there's a
[59:57] place that we begin to learn to walk in
[1:00:00] and we recognize that the battle that
[1:00:02] we're in is not so much natural anymore
[1:00:05] but it's
[1:00:06] spiritual and I'll leave it and we'll
[1:00:08] just begin but brother brother Joshua
[1:00:11] would say brother I keep saying brother
[1:00:13] bradam and then I I read someone else
[1:00:14] but in the Book of Joshua chapter 1 now
[1:00:17] after the death of Moses the servant of
[1:00:20] the Lord it came to pass that the Lord
[1:00:21] spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[1:00:24] Minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[1:00:28] now therefore arise and go over this
[1:00:30] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[1:00:33] land which I do give them when God gives
[1:00:36] you something oh it's it's it's yours
[1:00:39] which I do give them even to the
[1:00:41] children of Israel every place that the
[1:00:43] sole of your foot shall tread upon that
[1:00:47] have I given unto you amen as I said
[1:00:50] unto Moses then he begins to lay out the
[1:00:52] borders from the Wilderness and this
[1:00:54] Lebanon which we even see today missiles
[1:00:57] coming from Lebanon and these from this
[1:00:59] from the from the Wilderness in this
[1:01:00] Lebanon even unto the Great River the
[1:01:03] river Euphrates and all the land of the
[1:01:06] Hittites and unto the great sea going
[1:01:08] down Unto the Sun shall be your Coast
[1:01:11] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:01:14] before thee all the days of thy life
[1:01:16] where when you're in the
[1:01:19] land as I was with Moses so I will be
[1:01:23] with thee I will will not fail thee amen
[1:01:26] nor forsake thee Hallelujah be strong
[1:01:28] and of a good courage For unto this
[1:01:30] people Thou shalt divide for an
[1:01:32] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:01:35] their fathers to give them only be thou
[1:01:37] very strong or strong and very
[1:01:42] courageous this book of the law and I'll
[1:01:44] drop down this book of the law mostly
[1:01:46] because I lost my place this book of the
[1:01:48] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[1:01:50] but Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:01:53] night that thou mayest observe to do
[1:01:55] according to all that is written therein
[1:01:57] for then shalt thou make thy way
[1:01:58] prosperous and then shalt thou have good
[1:02:01] success the only time in the King James
[1:02:03] version of the Bible that the word
[1:02:05] success is mentioned here's the secret
[1:02:07] to your success you're looking for
[1:02:09] observe and meditate on the word of God
[1:02:12] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[1:02:14] of a good courage Be not
[1:02:16] Afraid neither be doubt dismayed no
[1:02:19] matter what we're up against no matter
[1:02:21] what crisis we're facing no matter what
[1:02:23] trial something that we up against that
[1:02:25] we we don't know what to do be not
[1:02:29] dismayed look up a little
[1:02:31] higher now today we live in a realm of
[1:02:34] five senses we know this well see taste
[1:02:37] feel smell hear and we bump into all
[1:02:39] these solid objects we have bump into
[1:02:42] things that smell we we we have to be
[1:02:44] able to see in this three-dimensional
[1:02:46] World in this place of time and space
[1:02:48] and matter we have to God gave us these
[1:02:50] senses to contact this realm now the
[1:02:53] children of Israel lived in this realm
[1:02:56] and they left Egypt naturally they went
[1:02:58] through a Wilderness naturally they came
[1:03:00] to Kadesh they even rejected the word
[1:03:02] for a while they went around the
[1:03:03] Wilderness then they came to a Promised
[1:03:05] Land naturally and they set out to
[1:03:08] overcome
[1:03:10] naturally we don't do that we live in a
[1:03:13] spiritual land we live as much as we
[1:03:16] live in a natural world we are learning
[1:03:19] and God is teaching us day by day by day
[1:03:21] to look to the Unseen to realize what
[1:03:24] we're faced with we ought to look for
[1:03:26] the spiritual context where's my
[1:03:29] spiritual battle where's the what's the
[1:03:31] atmosphere I'm faced with as much as we
[1:03:33] want to be healthy wealthy and wise in
[1:03:35] this world that's not the point it's
[1:03:38] good we have to have our jobs we have to
[1:03:40] have all these things laid out but
[1:03:42] there's something
[1:03:44] greater there's something greater God is
[1:03:47] focused on something deeper than just
[1:03:49] our fleshly
[1:03:50] Comforts go our Leo deia is focused on
[1:03:53] fleshly comfort Comforts but God is
[1:03:55] forming sometimes by allowing fleshly
[1:03:57] suffering a spiritual character
[1:04:01] something on the inside and I I
[1:04:02] recognize we're all in different places
[1:04:04] in our walks so I want to say this no
[1:04:06] matter what stage you're in whether the
[1:04:09] the promised land types the Holy Ghost
[1:04:11] they had to come out of Egypt and they
[1:04:13] had to go into the Holy Ghost through
[1:04:15] justification through baptism in the sea
[1:04:17] and in the cloud and they walked through
[1:04:19] the Wilderness they were Sanctified they
[1:04:21] stepped into the promised land and they
[1:04:23] were striving for finding their place
[1:04:25] the adoption but we're all in different
[1:04:27] places I want to say though tonight or
[1:04:29] I'm used to speaking in the night I want
[1:04:31] to say this morning you are
[1:04:35] predestinated unto right all the way to
[1:04:39] adoption so no matter where you're at
[1:04:42] and where you find yourself a young
[1:04:44] person you say I haven't been baptized
[1:04:46] or I haven't been filled or I'm still
[1:04:48] struggling or I don't even know if I
[1:04:49] believe any of this but if there's
[1:04:52] something on the inside if there's a
[1:04:54] little seed if there's a little twinge a
[1:04:56] little something that begins to speak to
[1:04:58] you and pull to you give way to that and
[1:05:01] it will bring you all the way to the
[1:05:02] land and it'll bring you all the way to
[1:05:05] your place you're predestinated not just
[1:05:07] to live a halfway life you're
[1:05:09] predestinated to adoption now we can say
[1:05:12] these words adoption and that sounds big
[1:05:14] and strange but it's finding your place
[1:05:17] it's finding that place where I'm
[1:05:18] overcoming I'm in my land and I've
[1:05:20] pushed back the enemies and I'm here and
[1:05:22] God is using me in this spot and God can
[1:05:24] say hear ye
[1:05:25] him it's not it's a big thing and yet
[1:05:28] maybe we make it too mysterious in our
[1:05:30] minds but God is focused on building a
[1:05:34] spiritual character now in this natural
[1:05:37] world that we live in we often focus on
[1:05:39] what we wear and how we look and getting
[1:05:42] our finances in order and getting our
[1:05:43] health in order and and focused on what
[1:05:45] we eat and what we intake and all of
[1:05:47] these different things and we even
[1:05:48] protect oursel we if we're if you're if
[1:05:50] you're if you're riding in a car you put
[1:05:52] your seat Bel on if you're if you're
[1:05:54] driving down the road or if you're
[1:05:55] you're going out you want to look your
[1:05:56] best you want to look the part and
[1:05:58] wherever you're going you want to do all
[1:05:59] of these things to protect yourself to
[1:06:01] look the part to to take care of your
[1:06:04] natural flesh but as much as we live
[1:06:07] we're only going to get older we're only
[1:06:09] going to have more ailments and sickness
[1:06:11] and trials and struggles and hurts and
[1:06:13] all of these things and eventually no
[1:06:16] matter how many times we're even healed
[1:06:18] divinely there'll be a day we'll pass to
[1:06:20] the other side that's just the laws of
[1:06:22] God but there's something that God's
[1:06:25] more focused on as much as the children
[1:06:26] of Israel had natural battles they had
[1:06:28] to take fleshly swords and Spears and
[1:06:31] all these things to fight and as long as
[1:06:33] there wasn't sin in the camp they never
[1:06:34] lost a
[1:06:36] man we're focused a different way God's
[1:06:39] perfecting not so much our natural
[1:06:42] bodies anymore not so much training for
[1:06:44] physical War but our spirit realm yes
[1:06:47] amen this body will be changed in the
[1:06:49] moment and the twinkling of an eye when
[1:06:52] the spirit is right because the soul was
[1:06:55] right it comes from the inside of the
[1:06:58] inside and it works its way out until
[1:07:00] this natural body that we spend too much
[1:07:02] time worried about changes in a moment
[1:07:05] so what we ought to focus on is God this
[1:07:08] land is a land of love and joy and peace
[1:07:11] and longsuffering and meekness and
[1:07:12] gentleness it's not so much a land of
[1:07:14] physical wealth and jobs and these
[1:07:16] things where am I
[1:07:19] focused and where it comes into my land
[1:07:21] where where what this natural world is
[1:07:23] affecting my love and joy and peace and
[1:07:26] anxiety
[1:07:27] and push it
[1:07:29] out push out the intakes build up the
[1:07:32] walls again guard yourself
[1:07:36] amen the children of Israel fought
[1:07:38] natural battles the bride fights
[1:07:40] spiritual battles we wrestle not against
[1:07:43] Ephesians 6 vers2 we wrestle not against
[1:07:46] flesh and blood but against
[1:07:48] principalities against Powers against
[1:07:51] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:07:54] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:07:57] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[1:07:59] armor of God hallelujah so we have
[1:08:03] temptations lusts Prides these different
[1:08:05] things there's three great temptations
[1:08:07] that are given to any human the lust of
[1:08:09] the flesh the lust of the eye the pride
[1:08:11] of life you can even follow that through
[1:08:13] the Temptations that Jesus went in the
[1:08:15] wilderness now these are the things that
[1:08:18] come at us these fleshly things these
[1:08:21] Temptations in our eyes and the pride of
[1:08:23] life the way that we can feel about
[1:08:24] ourselves and the the the motives and
[1:08:26] intent sometimes the Unseen hidden part
[1:08:29] sometimes you could we we might look the
[1:08:31] part and we might look as humble as we
[1:08:32] can but where's our heart what what's
[1:08:35] our motive what was my intent behind
[1:08:36] that what why do I want that what God
[1:08:39] cleanse us completely cleanse us truly
[1:08:43] God is working on a we have physical
[1:08:45] promises for physical healing he said
[1:08:47] the righteous will never be left begging
[1:08:49] bread or forsaken we we're taken care of
[1:08:52] naturally but God's truly
[1:08:54] focused truly focused on developing a
[1:08:57] spiritual character that's fit to rule
[1:09:00] the only thing that will take with us to
[1:09:02] the other side is our character and I
[1:09:05] don't want to say this in the wrong way
[1:09:06] but I'll add this and the souls that we
[1:09:08] bring with us those that are connected
[1:09:11] with us because we had a part in
[1:09:13] influencing them to make a choice that
[1:09:16] was
[1:09:17] eternal but truly what the only thing we
[1:09:19] take is our character
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:25] brother brandham adoption number two and
[1:09:27] The Possession the promise that was
[1:09:29] given to the church is not a natural
[1:09:31] land but a spiritual land for we are a
[1:09:34] royal priesthood a holy nation then in
[1:09:38] this royal priesthood holy nation
[1:09:40] peculiar people called out elected
[1:09:41] chosen set aside all the world is dead
[1:09:44] on the outside we're led by the spirit
[1:09:47] Sons and Daughters of God are led by the
[1:09:49] spirit of God not just by what we see
[1:09:53] not just our circumstances not our
[1:09:55] sickness not our symptoms not our family
[1:09:57] condition we're looking to something
[1:09:59] else not by man but by spirit and then
[1:10:02] he says all in love all bundled up the
[1:10:05] whole thing is bundled up now I want to
[1:10:07] get this to you that a man that is in
[1:10:10] Christ with the Holy Spirit can bear
[1:10:13] with a man when he's wrong
[1:10:15] long-suffering gentle patient he's sweet
[1:10:19] humble faithful filled with the spirit
[1:10:21] never negative always POS positive he's
[1:10:24] a different person this is a man walking
[1:10:27] in the land this is a man that I'm not
[1:10:29] but I want to be I want to be that kind
[1:10:32] of man we want to be that kind of woman
[1:10:34] that kind of child that kind of I want
[1:10:36] to read this again I want to get this to
[1:10:38] you that a man that's in Christ with the
[1:10:40] Holy Ghost can bear with a man when he's
[1:10:43] wrong doesn't mean he accepts the wrong
[1:10:45] doesn't just pet it either but but he
[1:10:47] can bear with the man longsuffering he
[1:10:49] can go a mile with that man and try to
[1:10:51] work with him to to to to help his Soul
[1:10:54] bear with a man when he's wrong
[1:10:56] long-suffering gentle patient he's sweet
[1:10:59] humble faithful filled with the spirit
[1:11:02] never negative always positive he's a
[1:11:05] different person now I can't do this in
[1:11:07] my humanity and neither can you but we
[1:11:09] have a great God we have a great
[1:11:13] God so our land is a spiritual land now
[1:11:16] the land the promised land was not a
[1:11:18] type of Heaven brother brandham would
[1:11:20] lay this out the reason was there was a
[1:11:22] lot of fighting there
[1:11:24] they won't be fighting in
[1:11:25] heaven the land that we had to go to
[1:11:28] there they had to fight for every inch
[1:11:29] of ground the soles of their feet was
[1:11:31] possession but they had to go fight that
[1:11:33] amalekite and perizzite and and and and
[1:11:36] and hittite and Amorite they had to push
[1:11:38] back anxiety we have to and doubt and
[1:11:40] fear and cancer and sickness and all of
[1:11:43] these doubts and fears these are
[1:11:45] different names of enemies that are
[1:11:47] pushing back on our borders of the land
[1:11:50] but the reason it didn't type heaven was
[1:11:52] there was fighting there yeah so I'll
[1:11:53] say this if you want peace today you'll
[1:11:56] have to fight for it and if you want
[1:11:58] your joy back today you'll have to fight
[1:12:00] for it it's an odd concept I just want
[1:12:02] to relax and have no stress and I want
[1:12:04] to have peace no no no you have to get
[1:12:06] into Christ but then begin to turn your
[1:12:08] eyes to the word of God not to the
[1:12:10] Comforts of this day and you'll find
[1:12:12] perfect peace brother Brandon would talk
[1:12:15] about perfect Faith the Bible talk
[1:12:17] perfect love or brother Brandon and
[1:12:19] there's also perfect peace laid out in
[1:12:21] the B I want to live in all three
[1:12:23] perfect love perfect peace but if you
[1:12:25] want it you'll have to fight for it
[1:12:28] we'll have to pick up our sword and and
[1:12:29] begin to lay out and say I want that
[1:12:32] that's mine that's my inheritance amen
[1:12:35] now how do we get into that land brother
[1:12:37] Brandon would talk if you want to know
[1:12:39] how to get into Christ Jesus you'll have
[1:12:40] to turn to 1 Corinthians 12 for by one
[1:12:43] Spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:12:47] it's not a denomination we know these
[1:12:48] things it's not just a feeling or a
[1:12:50] sensation or or tongues or all of these
[1:12:52] things it's to be baptized in the body
[1:12:55] of Christ it isn't good enough to just
[1:12:57] listen to the tapes it isn't good enough
[1:12:59] just to come to church and hear a
[1:13:00] preacher it isn't good enough just to be
[1:13:02] raised in the message you have to be
[1:13:05] born again by one Spirit we're all
[1:13:08] baptized into one body our possession
[1:13:11] our land that God give us to live in the
[1:13:14] Holy
[1:13:17] Ghost now we have different needs that
[1:13:20] can come this morning and I'll dwell in
[1:13:23] and there's different things that we've
[1:13:24] seen last year that just have led me or
[1:13:28] brought me to some of these thoughts I
[1:13:29] guess and different things I guess as
[1:13:31] you study too but we can have health
[1:13:33] conditions we can have Financial
[1:13:35] conditions we can have great family
[1:13:38] needs it seems that there's crisis at
[1:13:41] all levels more and more and more we can
[1:13:45] have a battle in our mind and perhaps
[1:13:47] that's the greatest battle of our day
[1:13:49] even mental health conditions and
[1:13:51] different things that come now the the
[1:13:53] greatest battle ever fought is in our
[1:13:55] mind so if something goes there we
[1:13:57] shouldn't be surprised but that's where
[1:14:00] the battle is fought so when weakness
[1:14:03] comes and When Trials come and even when
[1:14:05] it's just you can't even you wouldn't
[1:14:06] even know it to look at someone but
[1:14:07] they're going through a raging battle or
[1:14:09] we are crowd of people and you can be
[1:14:11] going through a mind battle like nothing
[1:14:13] else you're not insane you're not crazy
[1:14:16] you're not different you're you're just
[1:14:18] human the devil has every right to send
[1:14:21] every thought he sends your way
[1:14:24] he's on base he's allowed whatever wacky
[1:14:27] thought you get perverse wild negative
[1:14:29] down this that the other fearful he has
[1:14:32] every right God allowed him to it and
[1:14:34] you have every right to kick him out
[1:14:37] again and say that's my
[1:14:39] land he has every right to do we
[1:14:42] shouldn't think it's strange we're we're
[1:14:43] just human he has every right to see
[1:14:45] what sticks he doesn't know even what
[1:14:47] you thought for sure B until he sees
[1:14:48] your reaction which way you choose which
[1:14:50] way you go kick him out again oh learn
[1:14:53] to smile through your fears that song
[1:14:56] would say learn to smile through your
[1:14:58] fears no matter what the devil throws
[1:15:01] push him back again we're not made to be
[1:15:03] a punching bag for the devil where he
[1:15:05] just comes and beats and beats and we
[1:15:07] just take it for an hour and no we're
[1:15:12] Christians we're Christians we're coming
[1:15:14] into the land we're learning that this
[1:15:16] is a spiritual battle not just the
[1:15:18] natural battle and we're learning how to
[1:15:20] fight I I believe that now I want say
[1:15:23] this I believe that our mind is a part
[1:15:26] of our Christian inheritance as a part
[1:15:29] of the land of the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:15:31] that we can have apart from fear we can
[1:15:33] have a sound mind Timothy would say
[1:15:36] that's our
[1:15:37] inheritance in our mind so many things
[1:15:39] build up there's complexes they take a
[1:15:41] while to tear down but they can be torn
[1:15:43] down complexes fears anxieties lusts
[1:15:47] depressions condemnation I believe that
[1:15:50] a name of a devil of today is called
[1:15:52] condemnation
[1:15:54] God uses conviction to bring you to him
[1:15:57] the devil sends out a devil named
[1:15:59] condemnation to slow you down and to
[1:16:01] feel like you're worthless and you're
[1:16:03] nothing it's a devil that heavy
[1:16:05] oppressive feeling of gross worthless
[1:16:08] that is only a devil if we could see
[1:16:10] into the spirit realm it's something
[1:16:11] hanging over you telling you things that
[1:16:13] are
[1:16:14] lies it's not real tempers different
[1:16:17] things Satan spends a lot of time
[1:16:19] flinging thoughts at us just to see what
[1:16:21] will stick and stay and what will mature
[1:16:23] into something else now the reason why
[1:16:26] it's important to guard our borders at
[1:16:28] the edges is because when you let a
[1:16:30] little Amorite in and it grows up for a
[1:16:33] while it becomes a great big ugly sin in
[1:16:36] short you take go to the go to your
[1:16:38] nearest jail picked the worst guy there
[1:16:41] the worst girl there it what they did
[1:16:43] whatever horrific thing was
[1:16:45] done started with a thought somewhere
[1:16:49] and it probably looked Innocent but they
[1:16:51] dwelt on it and they worked worshiped it
[1:16:53] and they went a little farther and a
[1:16:55] little sin will take you farther and
[1:16:56] then farther the maturing of a thought
[1:17:00] can be an ugly thing but what about the
[1:17:03] maturing of the thoughts of God we're
[1:17:06] facing a year with Darkness and Light
[1:17:08] brother bradam would say the new year
[1:17:10] but what about the light let the light
[1:17:13] shine in our lives let those little
[1:17:14] thoughts let the meditations of my mind
[1:17:16] and the thoughts of my heart be
[1:17:18] acceptable in thy sight oh God let it be
[1:17:20] that I would turn my eyes turn my mind
[1:17:23] when the negative comes I turn to the
[1:17:24] positive begin to let that grow what
[1:17:27] happens when you have a fully adopted
[1:17:29] son of God not some man in a jail cell
[1:17:32] but a fully adopted son of God speaking
[1:17:34] the word of God oh
[1:17:37] my our mind is our inheritance now
[1:17:40] brother brandham says You must first
[1:17:41] find the will of God before you can do
[1:17:43] the will of God you must know what the
[1:17:45] will of God is in the matter then don't
[1:17:47] turn it loose perseverance so our mind
[1:17:50] is it the will of God to have a sound
[1:17:52] mind that's it's a good question CU if
[1:17:54] it is in the word we can stand on
[1:17:57] it first 2 Timothy 1:7 I'll move through
[1:18:00] these quick for God has not given us the
[1:18:01] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[1:18:04] and of a sound mind Romans 8:15 you have
[1:18:08] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:18:10] to fear but you've received the spirit
[1:18:12] of adoption whereby you cry ABA father 1
[1:18:16] Corinthians 10:13 there hath no
[1:18:18] temptation taken you but such as is
[1:18:21] common to man you're not the only one
[1:18:24] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[1:18:26] you to be tempted above that which you
[1:18:28] are able but with Will with the
[1:18:30] Temptation also make a way of Escape
[1:18:33] that you may be able to Bear It 2
[1:18:35] Corinthians 10:5 casting down
[1:18:38] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:18:41] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:18:43] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:18:46] thought Hall every thought amen oh but I
[1:18:49] just have this one little thought that I
[1:18:51] dwell every thought
[1:18:54] greatest battle ever fought Satan's Army
[1:18:56] brings diseases and God's Army is
[1:18:59] commissioned to cast them out amen that
[1:19:02] covers the mind the soul the disease of
[1:19:05] the soul the spirit every part of our
[1:19:07] body not just our physical body but all
[1:19:10] the way through we can have a sinick
[1:19:12] soul full of unbelief the chiefest of
[1:19:14] devils brother Brandon would say the
[1:19:16] worst devil was unbelief the one that
[1:19:18] would directly combat with
[1:19:19] faith every part of our bod Satan's Army
[1:19:22] brings diseases God's Army is
[1:19:24] commissioned to cast them out again
[1:19:27] there you are every time Satan throws
[1:19:28] anything Onto You God's Army is to cast
[1:19:31] them out God's method is to cast out the
[1:19:34] devil cast down reasoning cast down
[1:19:36] superstitions cast down worry cast down
[1:19:39] diseases cast down sin you're above it
[1:19:42] amen resurrected in Christ Jesus setting
[1:19:45] in Heavenly places with every devil
[1:19:48] under your
[1:19:50] foot now I'll slow down in for a moment
[1:19:53] but brother Brandon would say in Satan's
[1:19:55] Eden but I thought I would try to bring
[1:19:56] something to your mind in these
[1:19:59] scriptures I've got written here that
[1:20:00] would Enlighten you to know how to make
[1:20:02] you a better soldier in the field that
[1:20:04] you're fighting in now to learn the
[1:20:07] tactics of the enemies so that you can
[1:20:10] block everything before it gets to you
[1:20:13] that's the main thing is to learn to
[1:20:16] keep the punches off of you as much as
[1:20:19] you can
[1:20:20] amen it's not so much if if if I was a
[1:20:23] boxer and I wouldn't maybe make a very
[1:20:25] good one but if I was a boxer the best
[1:20:27] technique would not be to learn how to
[1:20:29] take as many hits as you could and be
[1:20:31] able to keep getting up it'd be learn
[1:20:34] how to duck how to block how to stop it
[1:20:37] so that it wouldn't hold your strength
[1:20:38] back so that you could come with as much
[1:20:40] strength as you'd always have when
[1:20:41] you're coming in for that punch brother
[1:20:44] Brandon was saying this the main thing
[1:20:46] is to learn to keep the punches off of
[1:20:48] you in another place he would say it's
[1:20:50] not how long you can make the battle
[1:20:52] link linger kick him out immediately
[1:20:55] amen when that first thought
[1:20:58] comes cast it down right there amen
[1:21:01] don't let it linger it only gets harder
[1:21:04] to kick out that's right so we have to
[1:21:06] learn but we learn our own Humanity we
[1:21:09] have to learn how we're wired and the
[1:21:10] way that God made us in our own
[1:21:12] wonderful way and sometimes our worst
[1:21:14] enemy well it is ourself we learn that's
[1:21:18] my weakness there's my strength that
[1:21:20] doesn't bother me so much but that
[1:21:21] bothers me and this area bothers me and
[1:21:24] this sometimes when this happens and
[1:21:25] then this and then that I go into this
[1:21:27] downward spiral of anxiety or fear or
[1:21:30] depression or it's something that'll
[1:21:32] start and then we go down down and but
[1:21:35] if we can learn that moment that trigger
[1:21:38] that something and say I want to keep
[1:21:40] the punches off of me now we can look I
[1:21:42] want to make a statement I hope this is
[1:21:43] okay we could look to
[1:21:45] psychology but I want to say this the
[1:21:48] greatest thing that we ever need is the
[1:21:50] Bible now I want to make that clear how
[1:21:53] I could say this brother brandham gave
[1:21:56] us the best psychology lessons we could
[1:21:58] ask for what do you mean by that have
[1:22:01] you ever had a scientist or psychologist
[1:22:03] or someone tell us that the spirit realm
[1:22:05] included memory imagination conscience
[1:22:08] affections and reasons psychology goes
[1:22:11] down their path brother Bram went to the
[1:22:13] word of God and by divine inspiration
[1:22:16] brought what we needed to overcome in
[1:22:18] the mental Realms today I believe that
[1:22:21] now he was I I'll say the greatest
[1:22:24] psychologist because I I would say I
[1:22:25] would want to take someone that's of the
[1:22:27] word of God and of the Lord now what he
[1:22:30] laid out was not just psychology what he
[1:22:34] laid out was this is the channels of
[1:22:36] influence that we can
[1:22:39] be overcome or or or taken by in the
[1:22:42] message of the greatest battle ever
[1:22:43] fought and he laid out these Spirit
[1:22:46] realm things these channels and these
[1:22:49] inlets now some some ideas some
[1:22:51] scientists they might have good ideas
[1:22:52] and that's fine but where ultimate truth
[1:22:55] lies will go back to the prophet and the
[1:22:57] message in the Bible and he laid out
[1:23:00] these things in the Bible so we don't
[1:23:02] have to look to these other places so
[1:23:04] much there can be a place for medical
[1:23:05] help even there can be a place for God
[1:23:07] to use doctors at all levels I do
[1:23:09] believe that I do believe that but truth
[1:23:11] comes from this when a devil's cast out
[1:23:15] we're good to go when a devil comes now
[1:23:18] there could be a place where God uses
[1:23:19] different channels don't get me wrong
[1:23:21] but God's laid out these truths in the
[1:23:23] message of the hour by a prophet that
[1:23:27] said your memory your imagination your
[1:23:29] conscience your affections your reasons
[1:23:31] is the realm that psychological realm
[1:23:35] that Satan will even try to get to how
[1:23:38] do we keep him out how do we keep him
[1:23:41] out the battles that we Face they go
[1:23:44] beyond just our Physical Realm but
[1:23:46] they're going into our spirit realm more
[1:23:48] and more and they're trying to get to
[1:23:51] the soul that's the goal now let us look
[1:23:55] for a few minutes this great sinful day
[1:23:57] that we're now living in I don't believe
[1:23:59] still Satan's Eden there was ever a day
[1:24:01] that I've ever read in history there's
[1:24:02] been greater days of persecution with
[1:24:04] the children of God was put to death on
[1:24:05] every hand but to see the deceitfulness
[1:24:08] of the
[1:24:09] enemy we've never had a day like we're
[1:24:11] living in now it's the most cunning
[1:24:14] deceitful day and when I see that it
[1:24:16] brings this that the Christian has to be
[1:24:19] more on his toe than in any age amen
[1:24:24] yes now our borders are important the
[1:24:28] place that when Israel had their land
[1:24:31] they were given these borders from from
[1:24:33] the Great River to the river Euphrates
[1:24:35] and the or for the river Euphrates I
[1:24:36] think it was the Great River but Genesis
[1:24:38] chapter 15 18 would say in the same day
[1:24:41] that the Lord made a covenant with Abram
[1:24:43] saying unto thy seed have I given this
[1:24:45] land he gave the border from the river
[1:24:47] of Egypt I believe the Nile unto the
[1:24:49] Great River the river Euphrates in
[1:24:52] Exodus 23:31 and I will set thy bounds
[1:24:55] from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of
[1:24:57] the Philistines and from the desert unto
[1:24:59] the river for I will deliver the
[1:25:02] inhabitants of the land into your hand
[1:25:04] and you shall drive them out from before
[1:25:05] thee and he began to talk about this
[1:25:08] land there's other scriptures that he
[1:25:10] would lay out the borders of the land
[1:25:11] from this River to the sea to the
[1:25:12] different places this is your land now
[1:25:14] to go outside of it I'm not there with
[1:25:16] you that that's not that's not but but
[1:25:19] to be in the land now part of it was
[1:25:21] even Egypt the Egyptian border and then
[1:25:23] the Euphrates which was kind of in and
[1:25:24] around Babylon and I'll say many times
[1:25:26] we're in between what feels like the
[1:25:28] world and the world the world and babyon
[1:25:30] and we're surrounded by these things
[1:25:32] that are pressing in on us all the time
[1:25:34] on all levels on all fronts Even in our
[1:25:37] spirit realm the thoughts and things
[1:25:39] that come at
[1:25:40] us but we're given our land peace is Our
[1:25:46] Land Joy Is Our Land the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:50] Our
[1:25:51] Land now now the fog of War and the
[1:25:53] press that we feel the darkness that
[1:25:56] comes we we we the enemy will try to do
[1:25:59] one of two things it feels like often
[1:26:01] and brother Ed would say this back home
[1:26:03] but either he'll either get us so I I'll
[1:26:05] say condemned and beaten up but he'll
[1:26:07] get us so slowed down and stopped and
[1:26:09] too afraid to move or he'll get us
[1:26:13] moving too fast too quick and that we
[1:26:16] get out of position and that we run run
[1:26:18] ahead running so fast that we're running
[1:26:20] tripping over oursel there's a place in
[1:26:23] the
[1:26:24] middle how many's ever had that where
[1:26:26] you're pushed you realize oh I got out
[1:26:27] of the will of God I got moving too fast
[1:26:29] I didn't pray I didn't do my part or I
[1:26:31] got so condemned and so fear and so
[1:26:33] everything that that I couldn't move at
[1:26:35] all and that wasn't right either one way
[1:26:38] or another he's trying to knock us off
[1:26:42] balance brother Brandon would say just
[1:26:46] following down this thought God says
[1:26:48] this church of the leodan age is
[1:26:50] wretched I believe this is leodan in
[1:26:52] church age that word comes from two
[1:26:54] Greek words which means endure and trial
[1:26:57] and it has nothing to do with the trials
[1:26:58] of a true Christian for the trials that
[1:27:01] God describes that come to a true
[1:27:03] Christian that God describes a Christian
[1:27:05] in trial as blessed but this is wretched
[1:27:09] it's a different kind of
[1:27:10] trial his attitude is one of Joy the
[1:27:14] Christian whereas this description is
[1:27:15] wretched and miserable the leoan age how
[1:27:19] strange he says in this age of plenty in
[1:27:22] this age of progress in this age of
[1:27:25] abundance How can there be
[1:27:27] trials well now it is strange but in
[1:27:29] this age of Plenty and opportunity when
[1:27:31] everyone has so much and there's so much
[1:27:34] more to be had when all the inventions
[1:27:36] to do our work and so much should give
[1:27:38] us pleasure suddenly he says we find
[1:27:40] mental illness taking such a toll as to
[1:27:43] alarm the nation now I don't know when
[1:27:46] this book was released in 1965 that the
[1:27:48] words mental illness have the same
[1:27:51] impact in weight that they do in
[1:27:54] 2024 but a prophet is a
[1:27:56] prophet and he used those words I'll say
[1:28:00] even in a prophetic form because in 1965
[1:28:03] life was pretty easy still comparatively
[1:28:06] but the world was to get so dark and
[1:28:08] this message was to get only more true
[1:28:10] and more dialed into the truth he would
[1:28:12] say this suddenly in this age there's
[1:28:14] mental illness there's God's Prophet
[1:28:17] telling us a little bit of what we need
[1:28:18] to know for that realm he would say
[1:28:21] mental illness taking such a toll as to
[1:28:23] alarm the nation when everybody ought to
[1:28:25] be happy with really nothing to be
[1:28:27] unhappy about millions are taking
[1:28:29] sedatives at night pet pills in the
[1:28:31] morning rushing to doctors entering
[1:28:34] institutions and trying to drown out
[1:28:36] unknown fears by
[1:28:38] alcohol and now we faced some of these
[1:28:40] things I can think of just different
[1:28:42] things other
[1:28:43] places the things that are faced in the
[1:28:46] crisis and the trial among Christians
[1:28:48] that want to serve God the Battle Is
[1:28:51] Real
[1:28:53] but God's more
[1:28:54] real yet this yes this age boasts of its
[1:28:57] tremendous stores of worldly Goods but
[1:29:00] the people are less happy than ever this
[1:29:02] age boasts of its spiritual attainments
[1:29:04] but the people are less sure of
[1:29:06] themselves than ever this age boasts of
[1:29:08] better moral values and it's more
[1:29:09] corrupt than any age since the flood it
[1:29:12] talks about its science and knowledge
[1:29:14] and science but it's fighting a losing
[1:29:15] battle on all all fields for the human
[1:29:18] mind and soul and not and spirit cannot
[1:29:21] keep a breath cannot comprehend or keep
[1:29:23] a breast with all the changes that have
[1:29:25] come upon the Earth in one generation
[1:29:28] we've gone all the way from the horse
[1:29:29] and buggy to the space age and now we've
[1:29:31] gone all the way from a space age to
[1:29:33] even they call it space Warfare where
[1:29:35] there was a missile shot way above an
[1:29:37] outer space above Israel from Yemen and
[1:29:39] the first time that something had
[1:29:41] happened all the way to Ai and all these
[1:29:43] things that we can't stay on top
[1:29:46] of it boasts about it in we are proud
[1:29:48] and boastful about it but inside is a
[1:29:50] Dark Void C
[1:29:52] that is crying out in torment and
[1:29:54] without a known reason men's hearts are
[1:29:56] failing for fear and the world is so
[1:29:59] darkened that this age could well be
[1:30:00] called the age of neurotics so if we see
[1:30:03] it it's not strange it's all in the
[1:30:06] message it boasts but it cannot back up
[1:30:08] this age it cries peace and there is no
[1:30:11] peace it cries that it has a multitude
[1:30:13] an amplitude of all things but it keeps
[1:30:15] burning with desire like an unsatisfied
[1:30:17] fire there is no peace saith my God to
[1:30:21] the wicked
[1:30:22] but I'm so glad in Isaiah chapter 9:6 it
[1:30:25] says unto us a child is born unto us a
[1:30:28] son is given the government shall be
[1:30:29] upon his shoulders his name Shall be
[1:30:31] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[1:30:33] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[1:30:37] Peace our Prince of Peace amen oh he's
[1:30:41] the dissolver all
[1:30:43] doubts this is another realm that we we
[1:30:46] often don't recognize that other realm
[1:30:47] until we're right in the middle of it
[1:30:49] but we're fighting a spiritual battle
[1:30:52] but we've got a sword we've got a spear
[1:30:54] we've got faith we've got our helmet of
[1:30:56] salvation we've got what we need to take
[1:30:58] to overcome so let's take the word of
[1:31:00] God all the things that we've been
[1:31:02] taught all of our lives and begin to
[1:31:04] pick up the sword and say I want to go
[1:31:06] slay a giant and I want to go take my
[1:31:09] land I want to guard my borders I don't
[1:31:12] want to go
[1:31:14] and now we'll turn it around the message
[1:31:17] Shalom he says let's turn it back around
[1:31:19] gross darkness is upon the people but
[1:31:22] what about the light he says gross
[1:31:24] Darkness would be upon the people but
[1:31:26] there would be light Rise and Shine for
[1:31:29] the light has come How can there be
[1:31:32] Darkness and Light he says it's got to
[1:31:34] be separated and the only one thing that
[1:31:37] separates it manifested separates it it
[1:31:40] presses it to the other side now when
[1:31:42] you've got a dark room and the lights
[1:31:44] are out and if we blacked out all the
[1:31:45] windows as soon as you turn on a light
[1:31:48] that Darkness has to start to scatter it
[1:31:51] is not powerful enough for the smallest
[1:31:54] candle
[1:31:55] light it is not powerful enough the the
[1:31:58] gates of hell are not powerful enough
[1:31:59] for just that little bit of God's light
[1:32:01] that would shine in your heart and begin
[1:32:03] to send out and press the darkness back
[1:32:06] it presses it back to the other side I
[1:32:09] say to the church brother Brandon would
[1:32:10] say that's what the that's what's taking
[1:32:12] place darkness is separating itself from
[1:32:14] the light now to the elected Church in
[1:32:17] this Dark Hour which we could stay on
[1:32:18] that for hours he says but you
[1:32:20] understand what that I trust have said
[1:32:21] enough to understand what that means
[1:32:23] gross Darkness upon the people now I say
[1:32:25] to the church he says
[1:32:27] Shalom God's peace every true Hebrew
[1:32:31] when he meets another one
[1:32:33] Shalom good morning God be with you
[1:32:35] God's peace go with you it's a good
[1:32:37] morning it's a breaking day Christ is
[1:32:40] appearing among us and then he would he
[1:32:42] would say in that in those messages
[1:32:43] we're facing the new year with Darkness
[1:32:46] and
[1:32:47] Light but there's
[1:32:49] light now the land that were in in I
[1:32:52] hope this is okay am the land that we're
[1:32:54] in that we're possessing is a land of it
[1:32:57] is a land as much as there's fighting
[1:32:58] and fighting for your peace it's a land
[1:33:00] of rest it was the land of Sabbath you
[1:33:03] could say Shabbat it was a land of rest
[1:33:05] it was the type that we have of rest in
[1:33:07] the Holy Ghost because we're living out
[1:33:09] the antitype now it's not just a day
[1:33:12] it's not just a holy day it's a land of
[1:33:14] rest in the Holy
[1:33:16] Ghost now that word shalom means peace
[1:33:20] and I I love the meaning of the word
[1:33:22] Shalom it means peace completeness think
[1:33:26] about the mental battles and mind and
[1:33:29] even Health even physical health what is
[1:33:31] it when you're complete that you're at
[1:33:33] peace there's nothing lacking you're
[1:33:36] healed you're whole it says Shalom peace
[1:33:40] completeness welfare Health it's a
[1:33:44] common semetic root with the meaning
[1:33:46] peace and in these different languages
[1:33:48] it was an important term in the Old
[1:33:49] Testament this is just from kind of a
[1:33:51] dictionary type thing and has maintained
[1:33:53] its place in different places in Israel
[1:33:55] today people greet the newcomer and each
[1:33:57] other with the words M Shalom or what is
[1:34:01] your peace how are you doing how are you
[1:34:03] doing they ask about the peace or
[1:34:05] well-being of one's family now I would
[1:34:07] ask who is your peace this
[1:34:09] morning the word Shalom is derived from
[1:34:12] the the root derived from a root meaning
[1:34:16] wholeness oh that's a beautiful word
[1:34:19] made perfect now the word even in the
[1:34:21] new test often that we'd have we must
[1:34:23] come to Perfection what that means is
[1:34:24] not sinless Perfection it means
[1:34:26] completeness
[1:34:28] maturity a place of wholeness a place
[1:34:31] that we're there to be complete sound
[1:34:33] shalam a version of the word Shalom to
[1:34:36] be complete
[1:34:38] sound Gideon would would come and be
[1:34:40] hiding from the from the Philistines
[1:34:43] maybe it was and he would be hiding
[1:34:44] under that wine press making whatever he
[1:34:47] was all doing threshing wheat is what he
[1:34:48] was doing all of that situation would
[1:34:51] happen when that that angel would meet
[1:34:52] him and they would touch the sacrifice
[1:34:54] that whole interaction he'd be sent out
[1:34:55] to go fight and he would call that place
[1:34:58] even though he'd need a fleece even
[1:35:00] though he'd need another fleece even
[1:35:01] though he'd need a dream even though all
[1:35:03] of these things would come and he would
[1:35:04] seem to have a lot of fear that starting
[1:35:06] place he would called Jehovah
[1:35:09] Shalom God sent him out Jehovah
[1:35:13] Shalom now the earliest references to
[1:35:16] Jerusalem the name Jerusalem are found
[1:35:19] in the ancient Egyptian texts from such
[1:35:21] and such BC their names their name
[1:35:23] appears as
[1:35:26] Ral and the Egyptian it goes on there's
[1:35:29] there in an Egyptian vessel in Jerusalem
[1:35:32] sent a letter of allegiance to Pharaoh
[1:35:33] so and so from Jerusalem it was the
[1:35:36] other word another word for Jerusalem
[1:35:38] these older times now it's possible it
[1:35:41] would say that the name had a compound
[1:35:42] name derived from proper name I I'm I'm
[1:35:45] reading this too quick but
[1:35:48] Jerusalem Jerusalem it's derived iived
[1:35:51] from that word shalom jerus shalom
[1:35:55] Jerusalem brother brandham would say
[1:35:57] brother I'll take what a prophet says in
[1:35:59] thirst notice Jerusalem the word
[1:36:01] Jerusalem is from above the Bible said
[1:36:03] the mother of us all Christ is our
[1:36:04] mother we realize that God as our mother
[1:36:07] we're born of him the word simply means
[1:36:10] peace Jerusalem Shalom or Shalom which
[1:36:13] means jerus then he says
[1:36:16] Jerusalem who was the king mzc he was
[1:36:18] the king of Salem the king of peace king
[1:36:22] of Shalom he was the king of this
[1:36:26] city who's that City tonight or this
[1:36:29] morning Solomon I'll just point out a
[1:36:32] couple of things but Solomon David
[1:36:34] couldn't build the city that that great
[1:36:37] Tabernacle that he was supposed to build
[1:36:39] but Solomon could Solomon's name was
[1:36:43] even
[1:36:44] derived Solomon peaceful the builder of
[1:36:47] the temple it was it was very much
[1:36:49] derived from the Solomon's name is said
[1:36:52] to have derived from Shalom translated
[1:36:55] as P shomon Solomon he could build the
[1:36:58] city David couldn't he was the right
[1:37:00] kind of man he was a peaceful man a man
[1:37:03] that could come brother bradam would say
[1:37:06] shalom peace don't be weary Jesus is
[1:37:09] here amen his great light has come to us
[1:37:12] and we're thankful for it yes his word
[1:37:14] the great mystery here he is today
[1:37:16] manifesting himself doing the same thing
[1:37:19] as he did then just the same doing the
[1:37:21] very same thing we're creatures of time
[1:37:24] he's God of Eternity we're trying to
[1:37:26] press oursel to make oursel do something
[1:37:28] oh this has got to be done remember he
[1:37:31] knows all about it it's going to happen
[1:37:32] it's going to happen
[1:37:34] anyhow we try to get in our own Humanity
[1:37:37] what we need to do in different things
[1:37:39] that come get into Christ let him lead
[1:37:42] the way our own self will make the
[1:37:45] biggest mess out of any situation but
[1:37:47] when God comes and leads us to the path
[1:37:50] leads us to the answer leads us to uh to
[1:37:53] whatever would be uncovered or whatever
[1:37:55] would need to be done now God can
[1:38:00] move brother brandham Ephesian Church
[1:38:02] age have you ever studied the history of
[1:38:05] revivals now a Revival signifies a move
[1:38:08] of God in power and every time God moves
[1:38:13] Satan is there to move also he says it
[1:38:16] never fails in the days of the great
[1:38:19] Welsh Revival he said says in the days
[1:38:21] of the great Welsh Revival and most
[1:38:23] people don't know us the insane asylums
[1:38:25] filled up quickly and there was a great
[1:38:28] display of devil power to take away the
[1:38:30] attention from God to try to turn your
[1:38:33] eyes to the symptoms the struggles he
[1:38:35] says to take your eyes away from God
[1:38:37] it's written that in Wesley's day the
[1:38:39] people would do the most peculiar things
[1:38:41] that were definitely of Satan to try to
[1:38:43] mock the goodness and power of God in
[1:38:46] Luther's day it was said that the
[1:38:47] miracle of his ministry did not lie in
[1:38:49] the fact that he successfully protested
[1:38:51] Ed the Roman Catholic church but the
[1:38:53] miracle lay in the fact that he could
[1:38:55] and did stay sound and sane amidst the
[1:38:58] Fanatics who are often filled and guided
[1:39:00] by wrong Spirits oh my if you have been
[1:39:03] aware of this last day Ministry you'll
[1:39:05] have noted the same invasion of false
[1:39:07] and wicked Spirits it has to be that way
[1:39:11] I hope and trust you're spiritual minded
[1:39:13] enough to get that and capitalize on it
[1:39:17] when it
[1:39:18] comes let God move it's not he pointed
[1:39:22] it out years ago it happened in the
[1:39:23] Welsh Revival it happened all around but
[1:39:25] now as the Press comes let's keep moving
[1:39:28] forward and look to what God can have
[1:39:30] for freedom amen the battles we're
[1:39:32] seeing should not be a surprise but
[1:39:34] we're meant to fight for our peace to
[1:39:36] fight for our
[1:39:41] land I'm going to drop down to a thought
[1:39:44] but now I'm going to drop in on the
[1:39:46] thought that I've had the borders the
[1:39:49] place that we have to protect now the
[1:39:53] Bible would say this in Proverbs I'm
[1:39:55] dropping down I probably past some
[1:39:57] scriptures that I've given but Proverbs
[1:39:58] chapter 25 verse 28 a a really
[1:40:02] interesting scripture I'll just say
[1:40:04] maybe I get interested by things but it
[1:40:06] says something that is quite striking
[1:40:08] now we know that we have a soul then a
[1:40:10] spirit then a body and and and so the
[1:40:14] spirit realm is that that mind realm
[1:40:16] it's the channel that passes through the
[1:40:17] word of God has to come through our
[1:40:19] flesh and then we we begin to receive it
[1:40:21] through our memory or different through
[1:40:23] the channels you could say you want to
[1:40:24] open channels for God and close channels
[1:40:25] for the devil and then the Soul now
[1:40:28] Proverbs chapter 25:
[1:40:31] 28 he that hath no rule over his own
[1:40:36] spirit is like a city that is broken
[1:40:38] down and without
[1:40:40] walls so I'll say no Borders or a city
[1:40:44] now a
[1:40:45] city a city in the Old Testament or in
[1:40:48] old times if a city didn't have great
[1:40:51] big walls it wasn't much of a city cuz
[1:40:53] anyone could walk in and they could take
[1:40:55] it over they said that when when cities
[1:40:57] were built there was people a Jour
[1:40:59] journalist or something talking about
[1:41:00] when cities were built that was when
[1:41:02] actually men were not only ever fighting
[1:41:05] only for war all the time but because
[1:41:08] walls started to be built they could
[1:41:10] focus on like arts and culture and all
[1:41:11] these other intellectual things because
[1:41:13] they weren't all day every day training
[1:41:16] for someone to come out of the bushes
[1:41:17] into their City when the walls were put
[1:41:19] up they could relax a little bit and
[1:41:21] they could focus and come to a higher
[1:41:22] level of human if you want to say it
[1:41:24] that way walls are so
[1:41:27] important in the in in in history they
[1:41:29] would talk walls have traditionally been
[1:41:31] built for defense privacy to protect the
[1:41:33] people from a certain region or
[1:41:35] influence even protect perceived danger
[1:41:38] posed by Outsiders walls of different
[1:41:40] cultures serve this primary purpose all
[1:41:43] serve this primary purpose but were
[1:41:44] constructed in various ways different
[1:41:46] diverse materials the oldest walls found
[1:41:48] in existence so far are those of the
[1:41:50] Temple of the gockley temple Tempe in
[1:41:53] Ura Southeast turkey dating back 11,500
[1:41:56] years they say but they're wrong City
[1:41:58] walls we only we know the world's not
[1:42:00] that old city walls which become common
[1:42:02] for per purposes of Defense are first
[1:42:04] seen around the walls of the city of
[1:42:05] Jericho they say this is history even
[1:42:07] now in the West Bank around the 10th C
[1:42:10] Century BCE in the Sumerian city they go
[1:42:12] on in history walls they even talk about
[1:42:15] um they talk about uh the credit of
[1:42:18] transforming the city they would talk
[1:42:20] about even and Nebuchadnezzar and
[1:42:22] different things the impressive walls um
[1:42:25] walls are so
[1:42:26] important when when a city was built you
[1:42:29] needed a good set of walls Jericho's
[1:42:31] walls were thick and they were big and
[1:42:33] there was walls that you could race
[1:42:34] chariots around I think it was in
[1:42:35] Babylon walls were key and I'll say in
[1:42:39] our land the borders and the border
[1:42:41] security that we put up is key to what
[1:42:44] comes in and out some things are good to
[1:42:46] come in the word of God the promises of
[1:42:48] God but he that that's without the Bible
[1:42:52] says he that hath no rule over his own
[1:42:55] spirit is like a city that's broken down
[1:42:58] and Without
[1:43:00] Walls brother brandom greatest battle
[1:43:03] ever fought when the great battle
[1:43:04] started on Earth there had to be a
[1:43:06] mutual meeting place there had to be a
[1:43:09] place selected for the battle to begin
[1:43:11] and the battle to rage uh paragraph 68
[1:43:14] and that Battlegrounds begins in the
[1:43:16] human mind there is where the battle
[1:43:19] starts the human mind was chosen for the
[1:43:21] place of the battle where it begin
[1:43:23] because decisions are made from the mind
[1:43:26] the head never started with some
[1:43:28] organization mechanical Affair will go
[1:43:30] on but you've got to make your choice it
[1:43:32] meets
[1:43:34] you this morning the walls that we
[1:43:37] construct the walls that we have what
[1:43:40] breaches our walls what do we find in
[1:43:43] our Christian walk that comes against us
[1:43:45] and in our spirit realm it leeches in it
[1:43:48] sneaks through a crack in the wall or it
[1:43:50] it comes through a spot that would that
[1:43:52] would allow the enemy to come in I
[1:43:55] believe in in Daniel's time I believe it
[1:43:57] was uh I can't remember which king it
[1:43:59] was but the handwriting was put on the
[1:44:02] wall and then the enemies had come and
[1:44:04] they actually stopped the flow of the
[1:44:05] river that was going underneath the wall
[1:44:07] and they slipped under the wall and they
[1:44:09] took over Babylon at the time or the mes
[1:44:10] and Persians whatever it was with that
[1:44:12] handwriting that story they stopped it
[1:44:13] up and they slipped under the
[1:44:15] walls where's that place that we have to
[1:44:19] keep guarded
[1:44:21] walls they all have that that walls as
[1:44:24] noted have always served the same basic
[1:44:25] purpose this is just history or
[1:44:27] something and and at the same time have
[1:44:29] always shared the same weakness anyone
[1:44:31] who really wants to get around a wall
[1:44:33] will find a way to tunnel under go over
[1:44:35] or walk around one the Great Wall of
[1:44:38] China was initially useless in stopping
[1:44:40] the NAD nomadic Calvary of this area
[1:44:42] only became a formidable structure it is
[1:44:44] today many centuries lat later but they
[1:44:46] could walk around it basically if I
[1:44:48] understand it right although there there
[1:44:50] was a wall in ER that was easily
[1:44:52] breached by the elamites by simply
[1:44:54] walking around it and Hadrian's Wall did
[1:44:56] little to stop illegal immigration as im
[1:44:59] as evidenced by such and such walls are
[1:45:02] as good as we allow them to be the walls
[1:45:04] that we put up even in terms of every
[1:45:07] wall around the city of say Jerusalem
[1:45:09] there was different Gates the Sheep gate
[1:45:10] the Water Gate these different Gates
[1:45:12] these were the entry and exit places see
[1:45:14] taste feel smell hear memory imagination
[1:45:16] conscience these were the places that
[1:45:19] things could come in and things could go
[1:45:21] out and the choice that you make allowed
[1:45:23] what was your border
[1:45:25] security now I'll say this we get so
[1:45:28] concerned about our natural diet what we
[1:45:31] eat and what we don't eat what we're
[1:45:33] allergic to what we're not allergic to
[1:45:35] what will be good the supplements all
[1:45:37] the things if we spent the same amount
[1:45:39] of time on our spiritual diets on what
[1:45:42] we allow in and what we don't allow in
[1:45:45] and what we feeds us and what doesn't
[1:45:47] what we learn is we're allergic to and
[1:45:48] it causes a sinful reaction or or
[1:45:50] something wrong reaction if we had that
[1:45:53] same attention to our spiritual diet oh
[1:45:56] what a different people we ought to be
[1:45:58] our our bodily exercise bodily things
[1:46:00] profit a bit that's good but there's
[1:46:02] something that's deeper because we're
[1:46:03] not in a natural battle we're in a
[1:46:06] spiritual
[1:46:07] battle what we eat what we avoid eating
[1:46:10] what gives us a spiritual stomach ache
[1:46:12] what what leads us to be a deeper
[1:46:14] stronger
[1:46:15] Christian let's close up the gates and
[1:46:18] look for the holes in our walls yes
[1:46:22] now the Berlin Wall I don't know I I
[1:46:25] wasn't old enough to quite remember it
[1:46:26] but the Berlin Wall came down in
[1:46:28] something like 1991 and it was a symbol
[1:46:30] of the Cold War and it was in Germany it
[1:46:32] separated East from West and it was kind
[1:46:34] of the Soviet Union controlled the one
[1:46:37] side and the American whatever group
[1:46:38] controlled the other side and it was
[1:46:39] this symbol of the communism of the day
[1:46:42] on that side and Western democracy on
[1:46:44] the other side and you know we could go
[1:46:45] into all that but that doesn't matter a
[1:46:47] whole lot other than to say this a wall
[1:46:49] in the middle of a city is really
[1:46:52] useless a wall around a city is great
[1:46:55] but a wall in the middle of the city
[1:46:56] kept families apart kept friends apart
[1:47:00] kept kin apart kept the natural
[1:47:02] connections that were supposed to be
[1:47:04] made in the confines of a city apart
[1:47:07] because of this ugly wall and we can
[1:47:09] have them in our minds as well we want
[1:47:12] walls around our minds but we don't want
[1:47:14] the complexes and fears and walls in our
[1:47:17] minds that stop us from living in
[1:47:19] Liberty stop us from living in peace
[1:47:21] stop us from our family or negative
[1:47:23] thoughts or things that come there was
[1:47:25] that time that wall came down it was it
[1:47:27] was a strange series of events but there
[1:47:29] was a time where that wall was breached
[1:47:31] and even at there was a New Year's
[1:47:32] concert that was sung in that place and
[1:47:35] some guy was up in a crane singing
[1:47:36] Looking For Freedom and the song was
[1:47:38] saying but he couldn't find it but I can
[1:47:40] say this morning that wall can come down
[1:47:43] in your mind in your heart whatever
[1:47:45] would be that something that holds you
[1:47:47] back that you bump up against that fear
[1:47:49] that temper anxiety whatever ever would
[1:47:50] be you can say that wall is coming down
[1:47:53] the president of the United States tried
[1:47:55] to tell the president of Russia Mr
[1:47:56] gorbachov tear down the wall but but we
[1:47:59] can say House of Hell give way in the
[1:48:01] name of Jesus Christ to the walls that
[1:48:04] hold us back we have no place to to be
[1:48:07] beaten down by the devil this is my land
[1:48:10] am I have a I have a right to live above
[1:48:13] anxiety and and fear and torment I have
[1:48:16] a right to live in a place of perfect
[1:48:18] peace with God I have a right to be sane
[1:48:20] and sound I have a right to overcome all
[1:48:23] sin all fear and every part of us
[1:48:27] hallelujah oh there's Freedom
[1:48:30] hereen the reality is now I'll just
[1:48:33] change gears the reality is though many
[1:48:36] times we find ourselves with broken
[1:48:38] walls on the outside or maybe a wall
[1:48:40] built up on the
[1:48:42] inside but that's not the end all we
[1:48:45] need to do is begin to rebuild the
[1:48:48] walls Nehemiah and erra were a part of
[1:48:51] building the Tabernacle or Temple and
[1:48:53] building the walls of Jerusalem again
[1:48:55] and it was a whole process they had to
[1:48:57] fight for it there was a whole study you
[1:48:59] could take in and Nehemiah and all the
[1:49:01] different things that were done but they
[1:49:02] had to rebuild the walls to make it a
[1:49:04] city again to make it a viable place to
[1:49:06] inhabit to make it a good mind to stay
[1:49:08] in again to make it a good mind to think
[1:49:10] in again to make it a good body to live
[1:49:12] in again to have joy and peace and that
[1:49:14] bright clear look in your eyes that
[1:49:16] Christian look in your
[1:49:18] eyes David
[1:49:20] I hope I'm not jumping around too much
[1:49:22] but David had a great sin he had let
[1:49:26] something come in the walls of his mind
[1:49:27] and he looked and he saw Beth Sheeba and
[1:49:30] he had done something wrong and Nathan
[1:49:33] comes and presents the case and and
[1:49:35] David prays this prayer in Psalms
[1:49:37] chapter 51 amen and he says something
[1:49:41] that's fascinating at the end that I
[1:49:42] don't know if I ever noticed until I'd
[1:49:44] started to look at these things I hadn't
[1:49:46] until I started to look at these things
[1:49:47] but a while ago but he he would say we
[1:49:50] know this prayer well have mercy upon me
[1:49:52] oh God according to thy loving kindness
[1:49:55] according to the multitude of thy Tender
[1:49:56] Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash
[1:49:59] Me thoroughly from my iniquity there's a
[1:50:01] man needing to rebuild the walls cleanse
[1:50:04] me from my sin I acknowledge my
[1:50:06] transgressions my sin is ever before oh
[1:50:08] just confess it if it's wrong just
[1:50:10] confess it I acknowledge it my sin is
[1:50:12] ever before me against thee and thee
[1:50:14] only have I sinned and done this evil in
[1:50:16] thy sight verse 10 create in me a clean
[1:50:19] heart oh God renew a right Spirit Within
[1:50:22] Me cast me not away from thy presence
[1:50:24] take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore
[1:50:28] unto me the joy of thy salvation uphold
[1:50:31] thee me with thy free spirit verse 17
[1:50:35] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[1:50:38] spirit and a broken and a contrite heart
[1:50:41] oh God thou Wilt not despise then he
[1:50:43] changes gears and an anointing must have
[1:50:45] struck him because he says this in that
[1:50:47] same chapter do good and thy good
[1:50:49] pleasure unto Zion build thou the walls
[1:50:52] of
[1:50:53] Jerusalem he says at the end of that
[1:50:55] prayer as he's winding down the prayer
[1:50:57] he says now do good and and thy great
[1:50:59] pleasure unto Zion build these walls
[1:51:01] back up again he says build thou the
[1:51:03] walls of Jerusalem I've had something
[1:51:06] torn down created in me a clean heart
[1:51:08] but now I need to rebuild I need
[1:51:10] something that'll be real and I need
[1:51:12] something that'll build up again a great
[1:51:14] wall oh I want that may that be our
[1:51:17] thing build thou the walls of Jerusalem
[1:51:21] amen now brother brandham there's your
[1:51:24] battle kill him at the beginning stop
[1:51:26] him dead in his tracks it ain't how long
[1:51:28] you can make the war linger it's
[1:51:29] stopping it right now build the walls
[1:51:32] set them up put at border security and
[1:51:34] he says God let none of them miss it
[1:51:36] it's your mind that opens the door or
[1:51:39] closes the door listens to your
[1:51:40] conscience affections reasons paragraph
[1:51:42] 111 greatest battle ever fought but when
[1:51:44] your mind closes itself to these things
[1:51:46] and let God the spirit of his word come
[1:51:48] in it blows the rest of the stuff out
[1:51:51] every doubt is gone every fear is gone
[1:51:54] every sensation of Doubt is gone every
[1:51:57] feeling is gone there's nothing standing
[1:51:59] there but the word of God and Satan
[1:52:02] cannot battle against that he can't
[1:52:05] battle against that we know that that's
[1:52:08] true now how many remembers we'll turn
[1:52:11] to Isaiah just for the back Isaiah 26
[1:52:13] verse one to three but how many
[1:52:15] remembers that song keep your mind State
[1:52:17] on me and I'll give you perfect peace
[1:52:20] how many knows that's a verse in Isaiah
[1:52:22] I'll keep him in perfect peace whose
[1:52:24] mind is stayed on thee because he
[1:52:26] trusteth in thee now it says that in
[1:52:29] verse three it says Thou wil keep him in
[1:52:31] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:52:34] thee because he trusteth in me but
[1:52:37] there's two verses in front that are
[1:52:39] beautiful that build the picture it says
[1:52:42] this Isaiah chapter 26 verse one in that
[1:52:45] day shall this song Be Sung in the land
[1:52:47] of Judah we have a strong City
[1:52:50] salvation will God appoint for walls and
[1:52:54] bullworks open ye the gates that the
[1:52:56] righteous nation which keepeth the truth
[1:52:58] maner in so point the walls the
[1:53:00] bullworks thou Wilt keep him in perfect
[1:53:03] peace because a city that's broken down
[1:53:06] without walls is like a man that has no
[1:53:09] rule over his Spirit but when a man has
[1:53:11] rule over his spirit it's like a city
[1:53:12] with walls and bullworks and it's a
[1:53:15] place where God can dwell because God
[1:53:17] wants to dwell in Zion God wants to
[1:53:19] dwell in us where his habitation it's a
[1:53:22] place that God can be comfortable and
[1:53:24] rest and we can rest with
[1:53:27] him Revelations 21 says and I saw a new
[1:53:30] Heaven and a new Earth who is that
[1:53:32] Jerusalem I'll ask who is that city of
[1:53:35] God where's that city that is and and
[1:53:37] I'll ask this who is the city and who's
[1:53:39] the walls of of your mind who's the
[1:53:42] walls who are the borders of your land
[1:53:46] who when you put the borders down and
[1:53:48] God said from this River to that River
[1:53:50] and and it's a land that we inhabit all
[1:53:52] the feet that we' every soul that we'
[1:53:54] I'm not saying it well but where the
[1:53:55] souls of our feet would tread would be
[1:53:57] our land and we begin to walk in love
[1:53:59] and in joy and in peace and in healing
[1:54:02] and in total victory over sin and in a
[1:54:04] place of perfect peace and perfect love
[1:54:06] perfect faith I know these are far off I
[1:54:09] I in some ways I need these I don't I
[1:54:11] want to live higher and higher and
[1:54:13] higher but we're striving predestinated
[1:54:15] to the adoption these are what we're
[1:54:17] predestinated to live in so we're aiming
[1:54:20] for it we're looking to it we're walking
[1:54:21] towards it now these borders these walls
[1:54:24] who's the city and and and who are the
[1:54:27] walls where can that be Revelations 21:1
[1:54:31] it says and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[1:54:32] Earth for the first heaven and first
[1:54:34] Earth were passed away and there was no
[1:54:36] more sea and I John saw the holy city
[1:54:38] New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[1:54:40] of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[1:54:44] for her husband how many knows that Zion
[1:54:46] types the bride that's us I believe I
[1:54:49] can say Jerusalem there's our part is
[1:54:51] there we we're represented there if I
[1:54:53] could say it that way and I heard a
[1:54:54] great voice out of Heaven saying behold
[1:54:56] the Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[1:54:59] will dwell with him and they shall be
[1:55:00] his people and God himself shall be with
[1:55:03] them and be their God now I'll also say
[1:55:04] she is him so we're all together in this
[1:55:07] beautiful something that we have in this
[1:55:11] city but I can't keep my borders well
[1:55:15] you can't keep your borders well we're
[1:55:17] only human amen we can in our own best
[1:55:20] efforts we can try to protect ourselves
[1:55:22] and try to keep ourselves in the right
[1:55:23] thought and the right mindset and we can
[1:55:25] try to to fight and push and strive so
[1:55:28] often but so often we fall flat on our
[1:55:30] face and we let the wrong thing in or
[1:55:32] we're deceived or it comes underneath or
[1:55:34] we didn't notice it flying over top or
[1:55:36] or somehow it gets in any thought there
[1:55:39] Devil's allowed to fire any thought he
[1:55:41] he wants that that God allows him to at
[1:55:43] you that's his right but don't let it
[1:55:45] build a
[1:55:47] nesten how do I hold these borders how
[1:55:51] do I hold these walls I see that David
[1:55:53] said build the walls of Jerusalem I see
[1:55:55] that there's a place where from the sea
[1:55:57] to the river and all these things that
[1:55:58] are they're my land I see that these
[1:56:00] things are my land even a sound mind is
[1:56:02] my land but how do I keep the walls how
[1:56:06] do I keep the walls I wonder this will
[1:56:08] be our closing scripture if we could
[1:56:10] turn to the book of
[1:56:12] Zechariah I wonder if we could all turn
[1:56:14] to Zechariah 2: 1 how do I have walls
[1:56:19] that will hold back the enemy how do I
[1:56:21] stand there and say that I this is this
[1:56:24] is what I this is this is my land and
[1:56:26] it'll go no further where do I find the
[1:56:28] strength where do I find that something
[1:56:30] that will hold me and keep me and and
[1:56:32] and and and and let me walk in a place
[1:56:34] of freedom and
[1:56:37] liberty I Zechariah Chapter
[1:56:40] 2 now these walls are so important but
[1:56:44] this is fascinating Z Zechariah 2 vers1
[1:56:49] I lifted up mine eyes again and looked
[1:56:51] and behold a man with a measuring line
[1:56:53] in his hand then said I with goest thou
[1:56:56] and he said unto me to measure Jerusalem
[1:56:59] to see what the breadth thereof and the
[1:57:01] length there I want to see what the
[1:57:02] borders of Jerusalem are he sent him out
[1:57:04] to measure the borders of Jerusalem and
[1:57:06] and behold the angel that talked with me
[1:57:08] went forth and another Angel went out to
[1:57:10] meet him and said unto him run speak to
[1:57:13] this young man saying Jerusalem shall be
[1:57:15] inhabited as towns Without Walls for the

[1:59:43] was there was seven sabbaths seven
[1:59:44] sabbaths of Jubilee and on the 50th year
[1:59:46] they were free and those things but you
[1:59:48] could be sold into slavery and if you
[1:59:50] had the money you could buy yourself out
[1:59:52] of slavery or in the 50th year you could
[1:59:54] go free but it also says if your brother
[1:59:57] was sold into slavery and you were a
[2:00:00] near Kinsman a brother an uncle a near
[2:00:01] Kinsman how many's are part of the
[2:00:02] family of God
[2:00:03] today how many he's part of the family

[2:00:08] your brother is sold into slavery and
[2:00:10] you have the money to redeem him you can
[2:00:13] pay for his freedom you could
[2:00:15] appropriate the faith to add to his yes
[2:00:17] he had to accept his freedom or he'd be
[2:00:19] drilled through there's different parts
[2:00:20] to it but you can appropriate your faith
[2:00:23] for situations that are just beyond not
[2:00:25] just you eternal life is living for
[2:00:27] others dying for others going forward
[2:00:30] for others no matter what the crisis

[2:01:47] be a Vindicated when the son of
[2:01:49] righteousness shall rise with healing in
[2:01:51] his wings and he says this he says and
[2:01:53] that healing part will not be a physical
[2:01:55] healing as you think as saying
[2:01:58] somebody's got a sickness and it'll be
[2:01:59] taken away from them that's what he's
[2:02:01] doing now in tight but the whole
[2:02:03] creature will be changed oh in Mother's
[2:02:05] Day in the message Mother's Day he says

[2:02:08] marriage supper of the Lamb reaching in
[2:02:09] in his fingers into your mind and just
[2:02:11] untangling all the knots of why did this
[2:02:13] happen and why did that happen and why
[2:02:15] could this but he'll just reach in and
[2:02:17] begin to take away all fear and all
[2:02:19] those tensions and things that we hold
[2:02:20] why would this have been and why did
[2:02:22] that be it'll be peace and clear on that

[2:02:49] hectic day that we're living in what are

[2:02:55] salvation look unto me all ye ends of
[2:02:58] the Earth and be ye saved sayeth the
[2:03:00] Lord if we can look we can live if we
[2:03:04] can look we can live the troubling of
[2:03:06] the water in Bethesda they kept looking
[2:03:08] and they kept looking and what maybe the
[2:03:10] first day wasn't their day but then
[2:03:11] their day came and sister hadri might
[2:03:14] have said that's nothing but the truth
[2:03:15] many times amen but there was a day
[2:03:18] Hallelujah was a day that was her day oh
[2:03:21] don't look at what you see how bad I'm
[2:03:23] crippled how sick I am what the doctor
[2:03:25] said now I'm going to change that don't
[2:03:27] look at what you see how bad they're
[2:03:28] crippled how sick they are or what the
[2:03:31] doctor said about them don't look at
[2:03:33] that look at the Unseen what God said
[2:03:37] before you feel any different before
[2:03:40] they look any different before the pain
[2:03:42] leaves before the hand moves before the
[2:03:44] eye can see one sight yet make ready for
[2:03:46] it's going to come it's going to come oh
[2:03:49] he says in your bosom it's going to come
[2:03:51] in your heart when God sets on the
[2:03:53] control Power now I get
[2:03:56] religious no matter how long it takes
[2:03:59] you keep on looking Gesa went out to
[2:04:01] look for that rain that they had no rain
[2:04:03] for three and a half years as we'd wi
[2:04:05] down they had no rain for three year
[2:04:07] three and a half years there was a curse
[2:04:08] on the land how many we've I wouldn't
[2:04:11] want to have no spiritual rain for three
[2:04:12] and a half years but we can live in
[2:04:14] those places of dry dry dry sometimes
[2:04:17] it's not even it's just a trial God even
[2:04:19] allows but there's a day when the rain
[2:04:21] is supposed to come there's a day when
[2:04:23] rain when day will break again there's
[2:04:26] the Night Comes but the morning comes
[2:04:28] also as much as there's Darkness there
[2:04:30] it only gets darkest until there's light
[2:04:33] and it only maybe you could say get the
[2:04:34] driest and then the rain's going to come
[2:04:36] too the spiritual rain of God but Elijah
[2:04:38] went up the mountain after that Mount
[2:04:40] Carmel show down and he sent gahaz up
[2:04:42] even higher whatever it would be to look
[2:04:45] keep looking and he would say do you see
[2:04:47] any sign of rain I God told me there'll
[2:04:49] be rain God told me I'll say God told us
[2:04:51] there'd be freedom God told us there'd
[2:04:53] be peace do you see any sign of it you
[2:04:55] see any he said I don't I I don't see he
[2:04:57] said go look again he said go look again
[2:04:59] he went back and looked and he looked
[2:05:01] and he saw he didn't see anything and so
[2:05:03] he went back and and Elijah said well go
[2:05:05] up there and look another time and he
[2:05:06] looked it says he looked seven times and
[2:05:09] then he went and looked on that seventh
[2:05:11] time and he saw a cloud the size of a
[2:05:13] man's hand and what if if if if Elijah
[2:05:16] would have been full of Doubt all he
[2:05:18] would have been like go that's it that's
[2:05:19] all after all this time that's it but he
[2:05:21] knew that was God he took God took the
[2:05:25] first move towards him and he took the
[2:05:26] first move right back towards God and
[2:05:29] what did he say he said I hear the sound
[2:05:30] of an abundance of rain oh he saw
[2:05:33] something now we've had Messengers that
[2:05:35] have gone out and looked we had a Paul
[2:05:38] went out and arenius went out these
[2:05:40] different Messengers have gone out take
[2:05:41] you to this day for a moment have went
[2:05:43] out and looked and they went and Paul
[2:05:45] had to go out and look and it wasn't the
[2:05:47] time yet for the this great reain that
[2:05:49] was to come and he went back and irenius
[2:05:51] went out and looked and these different
[2:05:52] ones went out Martin and Luther and all
[2:05:55] these ones went out and looked but there
[2:05:57] was a day when a messenger went forth
[2:05:59] and looked he stepped out and looked and
[2:06:01] what did he see oh he saw cloud in the
[2:06:04] sky that that said that there was an
[2:06:05] abundance of rain coming oh what we're
[2:06:08] looking for today I want to see the
[2:06:10] coming of the Lord in my flesh I want to
[2:06:12] see the coming of the Lord in my
[2:06:13] brother's flesh I want to see God move
[2:06:16] in ways he's never moved we're in the
[2:06:18] time and we're in the season Gesa went
[2:06:21] out he looked he saw the size of a man's
[2:06:23] hand I can say can can we can we say do
[2:06:25] we want to see an evidence that God's
[2:06:27] moving among us we can raise our hand
[2:06:29] you can look at it gravity would hold
[2:06:31] that hand down but if you just hold that
[2:06:33] hand up and say I've got needs I've got
[2:06:35] circumstances but I believe God I I see
[2:06:38] the size of a man's hand that's that's
[2:06:40] coming there's the faith that I need to
[2:06:41] say that little Grand feeling that comes
[2:06:44] up and says am I believe God I believe
[2:06:47] his word amen I believe that he's with
[2:06:49] us today musicians can
[2:06:52] come no matter how long it is keep on
[2:06:56] looking
[2:07:00] Hallelujah if the musicians would come
[2:07:03] if we can focus ourselves to the plan of
[2:07:05] God to what God wants for us and what
[2:07:08] God promised for us and let nothing else
[2:07:11] no matter how long it is go back and
[2:07:13] look again no matter how long it takes
[2:07:17] no matter how ugly it looks go back and
[2:07:19] look again God made the promise God made
[2:07:22] the word he said these things I didn't
[2:07:25] say it he said it I didn't say that I'm
[2:07:27] the Lord God that Health all thy
[2:07:29] diseases he said it I didn't say that
[2:07:32] that if the sun will make you free you
[2:07:34] shall be free indeed he said it that
[2:07:36] that that you have the power of over
[2:07:38] fear and of a sound mind he said it so I
[2:07:42] believe it and I believe it this morning
