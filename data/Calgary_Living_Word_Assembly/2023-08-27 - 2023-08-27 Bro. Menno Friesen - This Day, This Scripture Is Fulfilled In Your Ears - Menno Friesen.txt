that you would not reject any kind of worship that's genuine and pure by Your Word how you love to hear the Praises of your people the joy that runs deep within us that we have not of this Earth we pass from death into life art is written he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has already passed from death into life and shall not even come unto the condemnation our blessed we are this morning Lord and we're grateful to be in this presence in your presence make us mindful of the hour that we're in the time the season and that we would understand clearly by revelation the hour that we're now facing and living in for the greatest joy of all immortality we thank you for the years and the thinking now as we look down through the history and here we are at the consummation of time itself just at the brink now before the Millennium to setium oh how Hearts trembled with joy to think that you've been mindful of us and called us out of sin to walk with you take these songs that were sung this morning into worship the song leader and the musicians and all the the saints that have worshiped you this way father blessed brother Barry this morning where you sat Lord I'm grateful Lord is standing here in his place I pray that you would guide my mouth and my lips that I might say those things that are pleasing to you father thank you now for your grace would you bless us around your word we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen thank you God bless you you can be seated thank you to the music and uh I'm glad to be in this house this morning I kind of uh not do this too much anymore I'm kind of slowing down a little bit and and maybe quite a bit but brother uh uh Barry sent his greetings he preached Wednesday night in the Tabernacle in Saskatoon and and went out uh fishing of course and I certainly I was kind of planning to go with him but uh but we kind of had a special time so but he did send his greeting he says say hello to the church Sunday morning oh I say hello to you and God bless you and of course the reason we're we're really you know not just for here but uh you know with Shelley's kind of a special birthday I don't know if anyone's special but uh you know it kind of has taken us down a memory lane and you know how this family every once in a while we get to places where we we kind of uh walk back and say you know how far we've come and and every once in a while it's kind of like to not that we measure or compare but I I do believe hindsight is only to see how far we've come and uh it makes us hard makes our makes us glad yet sad but what would we be Joy of if there'd be no uh you know the negative it takes the two together I've uh in all of life if you ever noticed there's no such of things just all joy just all Victory just thought for our victories born out of a great trial and uh to be an overcomer you've got a whole lot to overcome and to be a special Overcomer of course the man won that that overcomes all things for Christ it takes much much anti-force and we know that the whole world is kind of like sometimes we feel like the whole world is against us and it isn't rightfully saying because this is something that's happened in us the love of the world has left us we're in a world we just don't feel at home I don't mean that we that that I'm complaining I thank the Lord for the the good years and the grace but uh this world is not a home we're just passing through our Treasures are laid up and just think no matter what you what treasure you have today I know there's no greater pressure that I know of than have a home a wife a family where there's real genuine Holy Ghost love and where they're born again with the spirit of God you couldn't get it much better than that and uh but even that is just a foretaste of Glory Divine it's just the time where we're kind of uh working through and before you know it all of a sudden you look at your your years they said where did they go the morning before I came here I was I was uh we're getting ready and I was a little ready before Irene and I just took a little walk around the yard and walked out to the front and and the driving looked down the beautiful morning and and uh yes you know kind of dropped her and said just think minnow you're 81 years old oh my goodness I always kept thinking well one day I'll be 50 and then I'll be 60 and I'll be 70. and all of a sudden it's stuck right up and here I'm into the 80s and I'm thinking Lord um and that is just a little down payment of Glory divine they just think of just just a little part some go early and uh I can't help but think this morning brother Kim uh you know I never we we try to run along mom and I and Irene and I would say wonder why God took him and uh coming especially since Sally was 60 years old down thinking what Glory that would have been but but who's there to question the mind of God I don't I don't question I don't understand it but then if I understood it I wouldn't need Faith but I do believe that to all things there's a purpose and a reason behind it the the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord I want my steps to be ordered of the Lord whether we like it or think not even the times when we think we maybe we've been out of the place and you know the old song we used to sing when one time I looked back and I saw only if one foot one set of footprints I said Lord I thought you said you'd never leave me what am I doing walking alone I said that's not you walking he said that's me carrying you during that time there's a many Good Times there's been single Prince behind me a great many times in fact this morning is one of them it always is that way and I want to thank uh you know the the folks especially for giving Shelly such a great time and and just the boys are all here this morning the family's all here good to see you and we we love the family but of all the things this is an international family when I look at here you're from every race Kindred people in tongue kind of a good representation of the elect lady around the world they come from the east and west they come from the land so far to Feast with our King to dine as his guest how blessed these pilgrims are and just by way of just I'm not sure I'm going to read a scripture and try to take a few thoughts from the scripture but I'd just like to talk to you a little bit this morning concerning these this glorious age what I do believe we're in I am not I'm not a master and teachers of these things but some of the things that that has unfolded in this age where we can sincerely say from the bottom of our heart that this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears there are so many of the scriptures that have all folded together here at the end and you know how when the prophet was here he talked concerning the the history and the six thousand years but when he got to the last he said you know how Jesus's Life Ministry for 30 years he was just there and he was he was Christ the same one but he's a carpenter he worked a normal job he just went through not much different now but for about three and a half years and suddenly said scriptures just begin to fulfill just begin to fulfill our short three and a half year Ministry really and he and he lived for that 33 and a half years expressing most of what the prophets had spoken concerning his first coming and they prophesied and spoke with hope and in a matter of three and a half years all of those scriptures begin to fit together quickly but it blinded the eyes of the people but opened the eyes to some there's always that way and I'm I'm looking at the scripture and the the time that we're in these things that's happened we have we have thought of course and I'm I'm confessing I'm I'm in the age bracket now where uh we had expected the Lord to come a long time ago in physical rapture uh well I I never thought I'd get to see great grandchildren my goodness I didn't even think our children would go to school be quite honest when we first when I was I was 20 years older 19 years old when when uh the Lord saved me and my wife and and so I know when we heard the message first time we get to hear the prophet speak we we realized once he was who he was as a prophet we knew it would be long until we'd be gone but you know he's never in a hurry but he's never late I don't believe he's in a hurry I think of all the precious Saints on the Earth right now you know this message after the Testament died after the angel died it became more powerful than when he was living men got behind the message and printed it and sent it out to around the world into every country everywhere and it had Revival after Revival not just a natural talk about stirring up but talk about calling out an elect lady out of every tongue and Kindred people this morning we could say they're they're from everywhere now where it's closing off now you're seeing even the brothers that been on the mission field now they come back and say it's there now but now all kinds of doctrines are starting to weave in and trying to assure us all that but one of these mornings it'll be the last one they'll be sealing and there's a ceiling going on right now and I I know that we know that but we're we're waiting now with all that lays within us I believe we're waiting now not because I'm old I might still go by the way the grave I don't know that we don't know that but I've seen a lot younger people go by the way the grave and I know this if we live through this day we'll outlive a many a 15 year old child 15 year old boy or girl but there's one thing sure eventually one time one day every scripture must be fulfilled it must be fulfilled and here we are enjoying the part that we recognize that we're in now living Epistles rid of all men I'm glad to be read as being a part of the word of God I want to take in just a little time and you know every time we uh I've always believed this when we get together we love to polish the jewels and turn over the gold and and go through all the the as brother Bob said we're we're Prospectors we we go to dig in a little bit further and then we blow a little bit and then we siphon a little bit and then we blow again and and we maybe go through the waters and the trials and the test but but every time we gather we we find we're coming be purified a little more he loves to let his children go through trials and said oh lord I can't make this one he said that's all that's good that's good I'm going to take you through it I'm going to get victory in you for his whole purpose is I know there's been in many times when in your life probably where you've sat there and maybe prayed at night and and before the morning said Lord I don't know how am I going to make this one those are the times he really enjoys he said that's good then I'll do it for you then I'll do it in you born that day you'll know when I think of the prophet he said now watching this they said in that day this day and that day you'll know that I'm in the father and the father is in me I and you and you and me the prophet said this is the day that it becomes the divine revelation to the elect lady that that is the truth that God had resolved all the mystery of God unfolded not two or three beings but one true Living God manifested in different manifestations so much more that you can't you can't even put them all together but he's everything but his father son Holy Ghost he's the first he's Alpha he's the Omega he's all those things but he changed his form to hide himself to some and reveal himself to others look at this day when everybody's worshiping Jesus Christ so to say he comes as Son of God he turns the turns the message around and prophesies that he'll come as son of man and while he comes the son of man Prophet they go right on saying oh we believe in Jesus we believe in Jesus Jesus is the word and when he come inside of man prophecy and begin to fulfill the scripture they said all away with him away with him we'll we'll stay with Jesus oh we love Jesus but Jesus is the word he is Son of Man Son of God Son of David but he's all the same but just a short little space of time well actually like the prophet said about three and a half years Thirty did you know said it's his Minister was 33 and a half years when brother Brown from the time that he started his ministry time he finished was 33 and a half years just right about fulfilling exactly the scripture not the man and I like that about the prophet he said it's not me I'm not the one that does these things it's Christ in me the hope of glory amen I've got to little let's read a little scripture in the Book of Luke and because I've been on that uh I'm good to yeah stand with me if you would please I'm going to just be on a little part that blessed me some time ago I was reading a part of the message and I you know how you you've got most of the messages underlined so heavily but but then every once in a while a new thing you missed a little partner you underline it again say oh that sounds good and dumb I'm going to polish one of those nuggets this morning that I that I just enjoyed again when I read it and it's found here in this scripture which is very familiar I'm sure Luke the fourth chapter and let's start about the 14th verse and uh this is a familiar scripture but I think anytime you read the word of God you're in the will of God I do believe that I'm going to read the 14th verse and we'll just drop in around the 14th verse of Luke the fourth chapter and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and they went out of Fame of him through all the reasons round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he was brought up that's usually the place where you're not very popular you'll find in a little reading as we go down and as this custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read and that was delivered unto him the book of Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written brother Brown says in one place said he found the place where it was written of him he was going to declare him and he opened the book and he's found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind and a set of Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and we always wondered at the time of course we didn't know but how the prophet so beautifully brought it he closed the book why did he close it there that was the last part of his Earthly Ministry at that time the rest of it if we're going to read Isaiah the last part in a little bit and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and they began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bore him witnessed and wondered at the gracious words was proceeded out of his mouth and they said it's not this Joseph's son and he said unto them ye will well surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever We Have Heard done in Capernaum do also hear in thy own country let me just hold your finger here for a minute did you know brother Branham when he came to the latter part of the third pool of his ministry he said in the Tabernacle said I'm not going to have any more discernment in my own Tabernacle he said it's the hardest place so much unbelief because they knew him personally they knew him personally how much easier it is to take take something from somebody that would be a little hearted that you don't really know but when you really know them said well I know he's just this and he's human and I know that and they were seeing the human part they already said physician heal thyself didn't know he was the Healer and he said verily I say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country and that what brother Brown said he said just think this morning he said when I went down what is the attraction on the mountain he said I come walking I came driving he didn't I drove by the church this morning and he said I saw license place from everywhere from Mexico to Canada all through the United States and he said as I drove by and saw the little church something said what is the attraction why is not all Jeffersonville out he said hardly want to cross the street would cross the streets why does he do that that's his choice he has ways because it's only known listen God is only known by revelation not by human inspiration or by Humanity he is only known by revelation Isaiah to you no Prophet is accept in his own country but I tell you of the truth many widows were in the in Israel during days of Elias when the heavens were shut up three years and six months with Great Famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Isaiah's sent save unto Sarepta the city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in Israel in the time of Isaiah the prophet and none of them was cleansed same name the Syrian and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with Wrath and Rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him to the bow of the Hill wherein the city was built that they might cast him down headlong but he passing through the midst of them went his way I want to turn into back to Isaiah 61. which of course is what all of us I'm sure you know this so but let's read that familiar scripture as well Isaiah 61. and one and the spirit of God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings to the meek and he had sent me to bind up the broken heart to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and to open the prisons of them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord now that's where Jesus stopped reading and the day of Vengeance of our God and to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that more in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes and oil of joy for mourning and garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified let's just pray one more time father we thank you for this glorious planting of the Lord the Glorious water that Reigns upon the planting of your word bringing forth Sons and Daughters of God immortality bless the word reading of your word now and the few things that we we polish from there Lord to increase our faith this morning raise us just a little higher make us love you more and see how you've you've led us by your spirit and opened our understanding that we might know the day and the time we're in thank you for your word bless it now to our hearts we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated if you would this scripture always means a little to me and I'll give you a little testimony because all of our our lives are born out of testimony things we go through in 1965 when um I was a man of 23 years of age married with the two children for sure was it three Shelly was born I know that there was three or two my wife's the truth okay I believe it jelly and Connie you know I get those days dicks make up but I know when they're born if you really sit down okay I know the date not quite that bad but but I was 23 years old and we had heard that brother Brown was going to preach the message called marriage and divorce and at that time it was quite a quite an important message because you remember now folks not all of you Generations that your younger generation you were all born after all these Mysteries were revealed but where we were born we were hearing them one at a time we were growing with it every time we heard a message from 61 62 63 we grew and we grew with them so when a great message like marriage divorced at that time was a great message because the question wasn't every pastor's mind and every congregation was looking for answers and I myself I remember so clearly not having understood the deeper things because I was just a young Christian at the time and we were sitting there with five of us Brothers we we jumped in our car we we put a pulled our money together you know we didn't have money to stay in a motel we were just poor folks living our Rich folks world and uh and I had a car and I bought a newer car and the uh the other brother said look you take your car and we'll pay the fuel and away we go so we jumped in the car and drove 36 hours straight through stopped for fuel and washrooms and washed claimed our face a little bit same clothes uh slept in them in the car and went all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana never been there before it's one of those Adventures never been across the border period and uh we found our way Maps were around and they were poor we got stuck in Minneapolis and middle of the night and uh 12 o'clock in the morning we're right downtown Minneapolis lost because the detour that took us there and uh and we're sitting there now what to do and we pulled over it and a policeman pulled over and come to our concert uh you fellas lost you've seen our Saskatchewan plate he said yes I was driving I said yes I said I think we must have taken the wrong road he said follow me so I said uh I'll lead you out you wanted to go to back on 94 right yes 94. so he got back in the car and away he went led us all the way through Minneapolis down Highway 12 where detoured in the back into and finally blinked and said when I blinked my lights and said you just keep going straight so away we went we got to Jeffersonville you don't mind if I just relax myself a bit we got to Jeffersonville and we were we said now the first thing all we know that there's a place called New Albany there's a place called Jeffersonville because we heard brother Adam on the tapes so we said let's find the place in New Albany New Albany and sounded familiar so we found the place of New Albany and and we went in there and got a room and is uh in the middle of the afternoon and uh and we had we'd had a little bite to eat and said uh well before we uh you know uh close for the night uh let's go find the the place on 8th and Penn uh the brown Tabernacle so uh we got the map and one was navigating I was driving and we found the place also here this Eighth Street and then Penn we got down there and there's cars everywhere uh you couldn't even get close to the building and we thought the service doesn't start till tomorrow and that wasn't even at the church it was at a high school and uh so we went in and uh well we went to find out and uh one of the brothers went in and said the place was full it said the Deacon said there's no room there's no room there's not even standing room and all we felt so bad so here brother Branham had come the Wednesday night and was speaking to the congregation and uh so finally the deacons had just a minute said I'll go in so he went in and has anybody ever been in the Brahm Tabernacle all right for quite a few well they got the two doors you know how it is the two doors there the two side doors and uh they had little like this and have a look always going that that way and uh they're about about a five or six seated Highway like that and uh so the Deacon said I'll tell you what uh I'll set five chairs in the in the aisle way and you come on in and sit down and then when the service uh closing time comes that you have to get up and leave first because we can't block the action they said oh that's good that's good we'll go in and you know what you know we were we had the same clothes and there was wrinkled as can be and uh I don't know four Trail wasn't in those days I don't think it was before I I don't know but they were wrinkled we've been sleeping and we'd been driving never changed shirts or nothing like that but frankly we didn't care uh we we were we weren't going to leave were those meetings there and uh we we went in we just sat down and brother Brown was standing already behind the pulpit the song service was over and uh he took a text and his text was running from the presence of the Lord how many heard the message I don't know you've heard it um I my My Confession publicly is that's the end of my running I didn't run after that message but I had already quit running before that but it was a confirmation and uh I think I I sat there and I cried right through the message just the anointing that was on his servant and the respect that we had for this servant of God but during these meetings he preached marriage and divorces but he preached one night this day is this scripture fulfilling the Earth and he took this scripture and it began to declare what was happening in this age and begin to unfold the scripture you know Jesus here when uh when he was preaching he started he opened the Bible says he opened the book and he began to read the place and uh says precious words came out of his mouth let me just let me show you what what I was talking about one of the Nuggets that I turned over and the little message called why the people are so tossed about and brother Ram talks a little about the anointing and he said um you know he makes it like this now some people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever given to anyone and what did they do when they had that anointing and here's the here's the Nugget the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the measure we have the spirit by measure but he has it without measure and one day when he entered into the temple he picked up the scroll and read the spirit of God is upon me for he hath anointed me now he's preaching that personal now Jesus is standing there before these great teachers of the law and of the word the spirit of God is upon me for he hath anointed me to preach the acceptable year and bind up the Brokenhearted heal the sick and give sight to the poor and now you would think if such an anointing was in him he had prophesied 800 years before this I just think it was this morning if you knew that a prophecy 800 years have been prophesied beforehand and this morning that scripture was going to become alive they've been laying there for all those years under the anointing of God's word God never changes his mind about his word he's never late he's right on time and Jesus opened the Bible and began to speak concerning himself and said this day is this scripture now here it is 2 000 years later here's the prophet standing and he's beginning to point and take the same scripture said and this day is this scripture fulfilled in your eyes a brother I came alive we all came alive said oh what a glorious day to be living in to recognize that the word of God is being fulfilled this day what was what laid dormant for all these two thousand years in the six Church ages now in the seventh we're not only in the last of the church age but we're past the first poll the second poll and going into the third poll now this was the third poll 1965. and he said if and he continues to polish this nugget like this and he said and now we would think it's such an anointing such a prophecy of 800 years before that that it would come and here would be the type of the anointing and full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to take and run all over the building scream and holler foreign we would probably have to confess that a little bit wouldn't we I don't think anybody's ever again screaming or hollering or not or shouting in fact it feels good when somebody shouts and says Amen to the word of God brother Brian said that's good that you know a good hearty amen is more powerful than anything you could say to the word of God because he is the god of the amen you know that So when you say Amen to the word of God you're not saying Amen to the preacher if I read the scripture here this morning as I did and you said amen you're a Manning the god of the amen now you could get excited you can run a shout and that's all good too you know sometimes we think oh we got to kick the devil we got to do that it's all good too but that's not here he is the fullness of the godhead bodily let's just see what he did now they've got a pretty good example of what he how he acted when this fullness of the scripture was upon him and he said now this morning you are seeing what Isaiah prophesied way back there 800 years ago and I am the Fulfillment and to begin to no doubt he begin to elaborate about Isaiah and the Virgin shall conceive it all and that's why they said they got angry they got angry about something as he kept speaking because he was telling them that the word is living now and I am the expression of that word foreign all over the building screaming hollering but the Bible said he laid down the scroll sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what done that's what he'd done under the anointing the anointing is not emotion said oh that was so anointed I got so emotional well that's just a follow-up of the anointing the anointing is not emotion emotion is what follows the anointing that oh we shout and we prayed that's wonderful but that's just the anointing of the emotion that's just the emotion that follows the anointing but listen to what he said over here that's not what's done under the anointing the anointing is not emotion here it is the anointing is supreme power in control let's just take a little time of that let's Digest the anointing of God is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how to use the word the anointing is the supreme power of God that's the reason why you would hear prophets many times when they should have or felt like speaking they spake not when they did not feel like speaking they spoke when they did not know what to say they let God say it that's why Jesus was being the fullest about the godhead bodily didn't call for justice or or judgment he couldn't finish the last part and the judgments of the hand of the Lord because he was there as a supreme sacrifice his ministry that same Ministry was to resume again six or two thousand years later and come to fulfillment and to comfort them that mourn look at the age that we're in now there's only one real group of people that knows how to mourn truly over sin of this age even brother Ram said to talking about people he said what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost what I said them that sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the cities now that's just not crying not just weeping and emotional that's a revelation you knowing the Abomination that this world is an adulterous unclean situation is fit for judgment think of how horrible it is to think that this age even before this this service could be finished the dead in Christ could have risen this morning we are there now that made me Irene and I were talking a little bit coming in and said just think we just talked about Ken a little bit and said you know I got I never take the picture off my fridge I got his face all the time to me he's still living he's living more than we are living so are all the saints I look at my mom and dad many of the Saints you know you go we all love pictures don't we you don't usually the first one you see is yourself oh how skinny I was back there oh look at black hair then I said oh I'm so glad I'm going back to that that's the third thing we're saying I'm glad to go back the anointing is the supreme power of God in control knowing exactly what to do it is so precious I've taken you know you've had you've had many things in in life and and one of things come to my mind where brother Graham talks about the anointing and he's in the prayer line and of course always we we love those parts but let me tell you something just by way of strength and comfort do you know practically everyone that went to the prayer lines during the time when brother Brown was alive are dead by now do you see why he made said about Divine Healing as being not uh the main part is that because you're going to have to die anyhow see we we don't measure things by by signs and wonders and miracles necessarily because of all the people that were healed and delivered and miraculously Supernatural delivered raised from the dead brother Edwin way I knew him personally had much fellowship with him after he died right there in the Tabernacle later on he became his wife became a good friend of ours and we went to frequently visit her before they passed away before she passed away and Edwin Wade died just like anyone else Lazarus died like anyone else all of them are passed away we are a living generation and we're all passing away but to have eternal life you can never pass away that's why it's a primary thing you know when the disciples over there in Luke the 10th chapter they they were excited when Jesus sent them out with the power and the anointing on them now to heal the sick cast out devil and they had the anointing on them now watch the anointing it was they they when they come back oh why they Rejoice they said and they come back with shouting with emotions and they're excited he said oh the devils are subject to us and Jesus said I seem Satan like lightning fall from Heaven what he should have shouted and danced he said oh oh the devil was subject oh that's wonderful when you have eternal life all hell is subject to you there is nothing can separate you from God when you have eternal life if you're born of the spirit of God there's nothing can separate us there's no famine what if God chose you to go through that trial and even give your life it can't separate you from God but you could be healed and and delivered and go back and again be delivered again and still die so you see that's why he said I don't make it a primary it's brother Adam says it's not not the one the main thing that we preach it's just a part of the promise your healing's been around all through every Covenant first and second covening but the covenants changed in Deliverance from the blood of animals of bulls and goats but healing was even there the same way we'll look at look at the brass servant got to the place to where God said just put a uh the serpent on a on a pole and and every time you look at it look and live he said don't have to say a word sometimes I think well we got to get hands laid on that's good but you ever notice when the prophet comes toward the end he said you know I've waited for the time I might be a little bit doctored here but Barry can straighten it out if I'm out of the way but I'm pretty confident right because I heard the prophet say it and I know it's in line he said you know I have longs for the time well I would see the people just say God said it I believe it he looked at the he looked at the three class of people the Jews the Samaritans and the Gentiles and he told us how the Jews like to have hands laid on see Samaritans Jews wisdom then knowledge but the Gentiles when he come to the last part here's one Gentile that caught the true Revelation that made our lord Jesus say something that he said about no one else when the Centurion servant was sick and you know the story real well he simply asked for one thing Lord I Know I Know Who You Are I know what you are you just speak the word he probably had a message on the spoken words original seat already he said you just speak the word that's the way it's going to be and Jesus turned and said I have not found some kind of faith that kind of faith in all of Israel brother Adam said I have waited just for the for the church to see but I said we Americans I talked about his own Nation we are part of Americans he said we want hands laid on and you know what it's scriptural can't condemn it at all and we never want to start condemning anything like that but greater see that just hears the word and say God you said it I believe it that settlement well I didn't feel any different what's that got to do with it said I didn't feel it I believe it I think of the woman one time when Jesus was was uh in whose house was he in again when he was uh when he's called to the supper and the woman the adulterous woman there sat Jesus on washed unanited with dirty feet and she walked in and started washing Jesus feet dramatized a little bit said the scribes oh oh if he knew if he knew who she is and you know the truth it was she was the only one that knew who he really was they didn't know and she was the worst she was an adulterous woman we don't glorify adultery there will be no adulterers in the Kingdom of Heaven but she had more Revelation than all those put together and she was and he knew that she knew who he was in that little bit because the father no doubted showed him away who would come he said for the son can do nothing but what he sees the father do first and anything there's a real Christian that's scripture and when you look at this these these promises the the scripture when brother Bram then preached when I was sitting there that night and he preached this day is this scripture fulfilling your ears my spiritual understanding began to change so tremendously it became so real to all of us that were there we realized that for the first time we were sitting in the presence of God in the time of dispensational change they begin to take us to that place and said now remember church when this message is finished there will never be another rise up always said you'll see protractive meetings you'll hear all kinds of these all kinds of things prophesied even now that's happening but remember don't get Israel's anointing don't get that mixed up with a bride's anointing because the bride's anointing has been centered around one thing speak the word on I do believe there's people on the Earth right now that hear the word and take God in his word and that settles it there The Emotions Don't even pay any attention to emotion be whatever your RB is never feel condemned to say drive one person you know sometimes somebody feels like getting up shouting getting up and running that's fine that's just the anointing but Jesus never Jesus knew who he was he didn't have to do anything to prove anything neither do you when you're a Son of God you don't have to prove anything just speak God's word and stay right with it and you will because you're anointed to do it you're anointed to stay right with the word a little part here if I can just change this part just a little nuggets here I want to just the beautiful type of today he said unworthy worthy of death when we see him sometimes the question comes up among people and pastors we we deal with people that uh but they asked brother Brahms can a Christian sin they said oh yes he said a sinner can't sin oh I thought he committed adultery he steals he Elijah cheats that's what he is that's what she is so they don't sin they are a sinner but when you're born of the spirit of God you can sin disbelieve it's not one of the the only real Sin is the unbelief the only real thing is when you're if you're a Believer to say and you read something they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover oh well I wonder if that'll work what if I what if I just believe the word yeah oh but could that then when that's the real Sin the real truth of it is when you see God say something say Lord God that's nothing but the truth I'm not even without seeing me but that's one thing through it's the truth I might not have faith to make it all live I've been there many times I've not had the faith to make it all live but I sure wouldn't understand the way of someone that's got that faith if somebody's got that Faith sitting right next to me said oh amen stay right with it stay right with it but here's a little question brother Brian says you don't talk about what to do when we sin that's a good one we got to do all kinds of things but I like the way the prophet said it and I'll read it for you he said uh oh a beautiful type he's just talking about Abraham and Sarah how Sarah had just just did exactly that God told Abraham you're going to have that son and she just kind of went you know behind the curtain me an old woman you know she I don't think oh she didn't say oh he's a liar she didn't do that she just couldn't like but he knew what she had in her heart I said why did Sarah laugh is ain't your heart for God now the prophet said now let's be honest sometimes we went like no and I wouldn't say oh the prophet's wrong there oh no but is it for me I don't know it's written for the believer you know the unbeliever has no part in that it's written to a believer and when she did that the prophet said she laughed said right there God should have taken her life and friends we know that but for the grace of God which is not just a hit and miss thing Grace is our merited favor given to unmerited people without payment if we had one thing to do with being saved then we have a part in it but we don't every part that God's done in life is by the grace of God has done forth and he goes on to say and God could have taken or should have taken her life right there saying a beautiful type of us today unworthy worthy of death when we sin but God cannot kill us now now listen I'm not trying to comfort you in your sin if you do wrong don't stay wrong I think the answer is so beautiful you know uh we are not here to we are not here to condemn the people we're here to build up you in the Most Holy Faith Now call Sin what sin call black black white white but that's not to condemn it's to deliver to make free to get you out of the place so don't stay there just because your sin and backslide doesn't mean you're not a Christian July I repented on my sins I've been a Christian I was baptized anything but I've slid away you're still a Christian but you're away from the word get back to God with Factor's word quickly make it right listen how he says what a beautiful type he said we're worthy of death but God cannot kill us because he would if he would we are part of Christ it's our Grace because we are in the union with Christ isn't that wonderful tonight Union with Christ so therefore our sins when we do them we ought to quickly confess them that they're wrong because God would take our life but the blood answers in our place amen let me let me raise a little higher level and the token for it's not the chemistry of the blood or even the blood alone for you to claim the blood without the token when brother Brown preached the token message he said no longer does the old Covenant stand it's been risen higher now now to go in it takes the token life justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost himself is being impersonated impersonated in people in bodies that'll literally walk off the earth that God did in Jesus Christ just think of it as you're sitting here I trust every one of you but that's up to you between you and God but it's been ordained to live in this age to see the Fulfillment where this day one of these days when we lose gravitation we're going to scream said this day is this scripture fulfilling all yours I was a young lad it you know after we came back from Jeffersonville and you know how somebody said brother man what kind of Revival did you have during those times they were tremendous revivals in this the Revival is not not more of God just stirring up of God oh we had a great Revival that's good you had stirred up right and brother bam says what does the stirring up do washes the trash to shore is that when it's comets no more water in it then when it's six foot tall but it just washes the trash the unbelief the feelings oh I had this against I felt this funny about so-and-so oh the pastor he said this and and I I just I've been battling and you got to go to a little Revival for a second oh my the pastor looks different this morning everything he got on my skin but but uh oh I've been revived he looks good now and it's the same person attitude attitude brother said what kind of Revival did you had I said you know all about praying when I remember my mom and dad they were Christians in Pentecostal ranks I remember prayer meeting after prayer meeting there was nice when they would pray into the middle of the night I remember going going home already falling asleep I was eight to ten years old in that just a young lad and we were at my uncles and the ones in the village we were raised in a small village but there's a Revival moving there and they prayed they did not afford what they were praying for but they knew there was something something on its way and they prayed and they fasted they prayed and they believed and they fasted and signs and miracles wonders were in our home all the time because they didn't have anything they couldn't just go to the bank they couldn't destroy this they had they lived off of the land off what we had cows chickens pigs hogs you know almost everything made your own butter that'll do everything on our own but they they there's no hospitals or doctors to go to if you couldn't you can't get a get on a train to go there and find a way to the to the train depot and when the cars come and started coming back in the late 40s and early 50s but but they prayed and sometimes when we look back said oh the People Prayed and brother Brian said what were they praying for he said the anointing of God was beginning to press on the earth there was a move coming he started preparing the people the people started getting ready they started praying they started praying and I remember I remember my uncle one time and he'd been part of the Revival and then they they did like you know we've done some of you people here you got up to see the focuses got moved away you know that's all right that's a plug for you go wherever the Holy Spirit leads I would say that and my uncle and aunt had moved away after the Pentecostal Revival died before they heard anything about the message and they'd moved to British Columbia and the whole family moved with him got married over there married into the sinful Sinners they all went backs and went away but the mom and dad kept going to Pentecostal church but they they had not seen what they'd longed to hear and when the message came by our way in greeked all there and my dad and we had heard the first great Revelation that struck us was that this was a prophet of God and water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it shall be light about the evening time in the Waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus Christ when that Revelation struck my dad's heart and struck our hearts now I'm gonna go through the details my dad after a while he said you know what I'd like to go visit my brother-in-law and my sister so Mom and Dad packed up the car and drove all the way to Vancouver uh Suri where they lived and uh first night they got together and they were all happy and talking about old times in your old village and how's the village the house of people said and then my towards it was the evening war on my dad said uh John said I I want to tell you something you remember that baptism we used to talk about they used to pray it was always independent oh there's a baptism coming there's a baptism coming oh it's going to be oh it's a great Revival some said is this spiritual is it natural oh we don't know but there's a baptism coming and my dad said you know and he took the scripture Acts and went back to Matthew 28 19 and said baptizing the name of the father son Holy Ghost and so Dad explained said you know what that what the truth of it is it's being baptized in the name not the titles but in the name of the Father Son and Holy Spirit which is the Lord Jesus Christ and by Uncle John said that's the truth he said that's what we've been waiting for all those prayers led to that well you know what it didn't take very long everyone head for the water they were so critical you're out there in the village everybody sorry choose to hear the message and the baptism said why I said those people said as soon as they see a puddle in they go it's a bit like if you open uh eunuch you know he's out there and uh traveling right along and said uh here's water Wonder me to be baptized didn't wait till they got home he's on his way home but it struck him he said oh that's what the prophet's talking about not about himself he's talking about Christ he said well here's water what hinders me to be after I said if thou believer said I believe in the water he went and it was the light today you can't start Beyond you've got to start right there at that baptism and when that strikes you the reality of that then you're gone he's not going to give you any more than what what you've already believed I got to come to a close here but let me just finish this so therefore when we sin when we want to we ought to quickly confess it that they're wrong because God will take our life but the blood answers and stands in our place and God just can't cross the blood oh I like that see he just can't do it because it's a promise that he wouldn't do it so he can't break his own promise here's what I love and I I let me leave you with this in your mouth and and you just turn this over into your heart always when you think about it he can't break his promise he promised it through the blood whatsoever whosoever believeth hath eternal life and you cannot break the promise so we find out that Abram in obedience left his home left his land and separated from everything all his Earthly possessions to travel in a strange rat surge soldierning through the land a type of the church we're asked to forsake everything that's in this world in order to follow him I live in a house and I drive a car no that's not worth talking about they said brother Ash brother Brian will Christians work he said you know because it kind of got well we're waiting for the Rapture so why work you'd be surprised how many strange doctrines has been there under the water of this message for the last 50 years people would sell all the ham and said get raised Jesus come and said no sense let's spend our money quickly I know Great Men wonderful people I've seen them take their pensions spend it all said well we won't be past 77 oh the Lord will come before 77. but he didn't say that in fact said the only way you'll know is when you see your Dead begin to appear you'll know then but he can't because it's a promise that he won't do it so he can't break his own promise so it's God himself as it were has got himself sewed up God has actually put himself at a spot that he can't cross because he said so that I cannot step over top the blood that I laid down or their sins I love this see it breaks if he did if he could if if you're born of the spirit of God said well I repented but if you're filled with the spirit of God and you're a member you're part of the body of Christ God cannot step over that blood do you realize he could even take your life out of the way so he won't lose you well sure Paul and the Ephesians of Corinthians that she even told us how to deal with it sometimes an unrepentive spirit will write get on a person so much so they're just bitter and won't repent yet they're a seed of God might lose their Joy won't listen to the correction of the of the word and the passion of the church even the way you tell the whole church the congregation that turn him loose but he said if that man's born of God it's the seed of God he'll either come back or God will take him off the Earth and if you pray and nothing happens she says there was nothing there you can't be more than what it is if the seed lays there God can't break his promise he won't do it so he can't break his own promise so God's got himself as the word showed up he can't break his promise he promised it through the blood whosoever believeth and hath eternal life he cannot break that promise oh I like that I love that when I see the blood I'll pass over you [Music] this day is this scripture fulfilled how they got angry because he no doubt you know how it is you know how many angry people got I remember when we first heard this message people would get so angry was telling the truth on such simple things as for one not to cut her hair oh my you know why that's a law that was a simple scripture I remember my mother coming to this church wearing a hat all the ladies wore hats one day the pastor took the message from the prophet and he went to the scripture in Corinthians began to teach the truth well that was the end of the hatch they had a hat say last word sure walked in and began to let the hair grow so it's all so simple that's it it's all that simple no it's obedience to the word amen its obedience to the word I love that we're we're in our most glorious age I know that you're you're if you're in this message you're walking you understand the one little thing brother bam says and blesses me always and and all of us it's something that we keep thinking about and we are we're born into a kingdom that all of these benefits are there that we can we can hardly we could hardly attain unto them we know that so many times we live under the how we feel underprivileged we could have so much more of the joy but remember but but Mark this you are in a world that all that it sees is just this life and everything you go wherever you go every day you bump into these unbelieving Spirits wherever you go and and don't think it's strange when they try to get on you the devil you know and and we don't feel we don't think it's strange at all when you go to work and you're you may be down there welding or maybe restoring something or pulling out it might be a mechanic or get all dirty or your sister's work in the house and by the end of the day you look a mess I said oh I guess I'm a mess now what can I do you ever hear of water yeah okay one good bath one good shot oh I feel like a new person that's it that's in Christ you might get dragged down you that's the reason why when you go to work it's good to be prayed up but sometimes you're not prayed up sometimes you go go go and you're not prayed up and all how that's Satan tries to get to you but remember that's his job he's got all the time there is he's never going to leave now if you say God said I'll never leave you but that's different because I'll be in you but now Satan's not in you just because he gives your thought and runs flies over top of you and says some thought that doesn't make it you just don't speak it he comes over and some things and even sometimes it maybe should be spoken but you better speak it rightly in prayer first of all you all brother by him said if you get something against Somebody Pray up first go with the right attitude and straighten it out so we're we're we're trying to to increase and to lead them ever higher in Christ not to get away from it but brother Brian said you know sometimes we think about our life and and if you're like like I am and I know it but it's a little I closed you with this and I honestly will did you ever think I said when you leave here I'd say if you would go into the gas chamber and they or they'd throw you in the bottom of a whale or the bottom of the sea whatever it might be when your spirit leaves you water fire nothing can hold it it moves right through the building it's like a vapor I just love this part because you know brother bam says sometimes your loved ones yeah you ever notice how you talk about someone also and you feel there's a Nearness of something I've been there where we've talked about maybe got a conversation about mom and dads remember how mom used to pray and I remember you know we'd talk about her and say how we'd come in from the work and and Mama would come out of the bedroom and middle of the day all eyes were all tear stained and you could tell she'd had a real priority you know and we didn't know but she's praying for us we were just living our life but there's a prayer Warrior when we talk about it now oh it means so much more I said oh I'd love to hug you right now and say oh mama thanks for praying not that God wouldn't have done it but God uses the body that you know pray one for the other and even the spirit and but this is about the spirit world he says a little message called yeah again why do are the people so tossed about he said now when your spirit goes here when you leave here you die it becomes it hangs it it's alive it can't die it's got eternal life it can't perish then when you die and your loved ones are Weeping and then they they think you're dead you're not dead you're still up here the old body has faded away and it's put down on the ground and all the atoms that was once there it's all broken but gone back to Cosmic light and petroleum whatever it was gone back into the Earth and someday here's where we that's where we and this day let me let me not re change what the prophet said but and someday the great king of these spirits will come Jesus coming from glory in his body in his holy body and he'll turn those turn loose the power of God and every person that's in him their bodies them atoms will start going again they'll start coming together Cosmic light will start making them up in a moment's time every person that's in Christ will be changed and made young and man and a young woman again standing on the earth think of it never to get old never to get sick never to have a heartache or worry what have we got to worry about we just walk in the light or the light is gone don't don't worry isn't he wonderful I like that just even you our loved ones sometimes you you talk you know they're they're Spears here just hanging waiting to pick up one day is a given order and all those if you're if you're burned and your ashes nothing left where were you to begin with sometimes you talk about the conception of life be it animal be it human rights but how miraculous one germ and one egg and just just melt together and and something starts growing where'd it come from a spoken word is the Original Seed he said let there be light when he looked down on his Earth he saw it was it was uh void and undone but he knew that he had a seed under all that Darkness and one day he looked down and said let there be and the sun began that to be light and the sun began to shine and just as soon as the sun began to shine the seeds begin to quiver on the Earth they had to come up because there's moisture there but now took the S took the s-o-n to draw the seed back to him Come All Ye Saints of light Proclaim Jesus the light of the world truth and mercy is in his name Jesus the lighter the world will walk in this light it's such a beautiful light we'll walk where the Dew drops of his mercies are bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the lighter the world will walk in that make that your promise this Beauty full life we'll walk where the Dew drops of mercies are bright shines all around us

to save the whole world no Lord just let us be a light that wherever the sea Lays when we cross in our spirit crosses it it could be quickened that our life within us would Quicken the seed as we
