be glorified in our service tonight that every aspect of it would be pleasing unto you father as our brother Toby already prayed that we would just hear from you Lord Jesus just one word from the

know every single part of this Lord from the here the speaker and everything in between we just pray that you would be glorified that your will would be done now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Hallelujah welcome to the house of the Lord tonight on Wednesday once again the middle of the week battery recharge we have a few prayer requests we would definitely like to remember before the church I have two of them and both of them are mine but I'm sure that one of them we all share in common the first one I would like to ask the Lord for coved to go away we know that the word says to ask abundantly that our Joys might be full I say let's ask abundantly that our church might be full let's ask the Lord to remember just that we could remember Jim Miller in the hospital our employee faithful friend someone who has really helped us along the way just want to ask the Lord to remember those two requests and if you have a request let's just make it known unto him tonight with an uplifted hand gracious Heavenly Father Lord we have so many needs that we would like to bring before your throne tonight Lord Jesus we don't want to just be negligent and and accept things in this world as though they just have to be the way they are we know that we could never do one thing too much and that's to pray father we just ask tonight that we could bring all of our needs unto you Lord Jesus not because we want to treat you like a vending machine not because we want to ask you to do something outside of your word but Lord that we want to come according to your word because we know that's the only thing that you're obligated to so tonight we just want to continue to remember to uplift Jim Miller before you're thrown tonight Lord he's been good to us father we pray that you would just touch him that your will would be done in this situation father that you would just be with his family strengthen them as well Lord Jesus father that through this whole thing that there would be a testimony that there is truly a living God that there is a bomb in Gilead father we pray that you would just make covet go away maybe that sounds like a child's prayer but Lord I know that I am your son and father I just want to bring that request unto you Lord father meeting this way where it's all broken up and we're all so separated that's not your will father we just pray that we could gather together again in Your Name Lord Jesus Where Your Children could come together and we could Rejoice knowing that we are the sons of God father we pray that you would just hear these requests tonight and that you would honor them Father Lord we just ask for every other request that's made known unto you father by an uplifted hand every need Lord Jesus we know that you have allowed them to come to us for a purpose so that your will could be accomplished in our lives Lord we're so thankful for that we know that our trials are are more precious than gold father we just want to thank you for the trials thank you for the valleys because it gives us the ability to look up Lord Jesus and see the mountaintops and to see you to have the right perspective Lord we just ask that you would meet all these needs in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Hallelujah you have your Bibles tonight the Lord has given me a different direction pray that his will be done here thank you musicians once again Faithfully coming and offering your gifts if you could turn to Acts chapter 19. Acts chapter 19. I'd just like to read from verse 11. to verse 20. and God wrought specials wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them then certain of the Vagabond Jews Exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits in the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth and there were seven sons of one Siva a Jew a chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are ye and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded and this was known to all the Jews and the Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds and many of them also which used curious Arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver so mightily grew the word of God and prevailed it's just bow Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we pray that your word would just grow mightily and prevail lord it's our prayer that we would see you working mightily in me father it's one thing to look at other people and see the joy of the Lord it's one thing to look at other people and to see great miracles in their lives it's another thing to look at a prophet and to see you living out through him but oh Lord Jesus what about me father I pray that tonight this would become the prayer of your children that we would begin to call upon the name of the Lord and and not in a way that is a traditional way but maybe a little bit untraditional Lord Jesus that we could cry out to you that we could look to you for judgment that you would judge us now that we would judge ourselves Lord Jesus that we wouldn't come into the judgment father we pray that you would just bless the reading of your word that you would speak to us one more time softly Lord Jesus as we close the door as we enter into that chamber father that we would just have that invisible Union one more time that you would just have your way we just ask all these things lowered in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you tonight you may be seated we had a wonderful services on Sunday the morning service and then the communion service it was certainly amazing to just have people here to just be around people we had a little uh impromptu surprise birthday cake for brother Paul it was his 60th birthday just this last week and just to have all the people around and I apologize for those people if anybody was potentially offended that we wound up having a bunch of people gathered together outside that was not the intention but it's the way it happened and we certainly don't want to do anything outside of the laws of the land so if anybody is upset or offended please come and talk to me about it don't just bear it and be upset and offended um but we just wanted to wish brother Paul happy birthday with a few people so anyways um we certainly had some good services on Sunday we're thankful that we can at least hold a communion service looking forward to the days where we can have real service and a communion service and a foot Washing Service and a testimony service and just a real worship service where we hear the sons of God shouting for Joy once again all together um the question was raised are we planning on aiming for every third Sunday for uh communion service and yes indeed we are it looks like it falls perfectly in between the Left Bridge services so Lord willing will aim for every third Sunday to have a communion service so we can just have that on our calendars and know that's sort of the direction that we're going we have a new addition to the congregation yesterday brother Samuel and sister Faith have a new son called Benjamin igmana lest it be the name of the Lord [Applause] everyone is happy and healthy and the family has gone from two children to three the five-person family we can relate to that God bless you brother and sister you're in our prayers we'll be leaving on Tuesday May 25th that's next Tuesday and we'll be returning again Tuesday June the first but the Phil will take the service on Wednesday the 26th brother Mervin the Sunday service on the 30th and Lord willing will be back to take the service on Wednesday June 2nd so we'll just trust the Lord that we'll have a little time away some fellowship um I think True Fellowship according to the prophet there will be at least a couple of fellows in a boat and we'll be fishing it'll be amazing we'll have some some time travel time stand Stills when you're fishing so we're certainly look forward to that as well out of uh out of Acts chapter 19 our scripture tonight I remember when I first started coming to church and back in the upper room I'll never forget this uh here in brother Ken preach on this topic on this very uh this very thing but tonight I believe the Lord just spoke to me about this that that this is where we should go and uh I'm I I can't even remember if brother Ken went this way with it but I know he he talked about this and uh I can only imagine if we had that recording that it would be just exactly like we're going to talk about tonight in in understanding who you are we could just summarize it tonight these these certain Vagabond Jews these exorcists they took upon themselves to call over them which had evil spirits they saw what was happening by the True Vine they saw the life of Jesus Christ back upon his church again and while that was happening these fellows and remember they were actual priests they decided they were going to try and have a healing campaign as well you can only imagine that these were the ones that were probably murmuring a little bit about the campaign that was going on maybe those guys were having a little bit of a Ruckus down there and and they were murmuring about it you know the spirits don't die they don't die at all those Spirits came back upon those men we know it wasn't Jesus spirit because he would never do that and if it was Jesus Spirit those Spirits would have Departed they would have left because they would have been Paul's brother but those those Vagabond Jews those exorcists they took upon them to just try and act this way and you know they called these people over it's interesting when you look at the scripture they they called the people over that had the evil spirits it says then certain of the Vagabond Jews The Exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth so they weren't even like they just didn't believe these were unbelievers they just wanted to create a show they were trying to get God to clown and they had no idea what they were up against but these men realized very quickly that they were dealing with real spirits and we know brothers and sisters that today we deal with real spirits they don't die but you know compared to them versus now then they knew in part and they prophesied in part but today that which is perfect has come we have the entire word at our disposal and you know I just believe this with all my heart and I'm just going to preach it this way tonight I'm just going to preach a little bit all Heaven is waiting to see what we're going to confess do we believe that we have the open word or do we not believe we have the open Word if we believe we have the open word when we actually confess the word is open then Heaven's listening all Heavens listening but you know I believe it goes a little bit further than that it's one thing to say that the word is all open and we can say it as a church the word is all open in the message of the hour the word is all open but what is that to you remember Jesus asked them what are people who do people say that I am but then after they gave their answers it was a generalized thing then he said who do you say that I am brothers and sisters tonight I believe that's where we are who do we say that he is is he a God that's just out there in some other dimension that one day we're just going to see him it's just going to happen or is he right here with us now because if he's right here with us now then we have authority there's so many parallels and types that comes out of this this scripture that we read tonight you know um we know and there were seven sons of Siva a Jew and a chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know on Paul I know but who are ye who are ye and the man in whom the evil spirit was leapt on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded it can be real easy to look at this and think why there's an evil spirit and if I ever come in contact with the real evil spirit I better be careful because he could leap on me and cause me to leave the house wounded and naked and you know what brothers and sisters it's true if you do that on your own accord that's exactly what could happen or worse but what about when you have gone and you have met the requirements when you've heard the message of the hour and you've met the requirements and and you might not feel like you do but you can look back and say well I know that there was a time where it was just a boring Wednesday old night service and and I got the Revelation that I just need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because there is an actual gift there's there's something in it for me if I'm baptized I'm entitled to the Token I get the Holy Ghost in my life and and when I get that holy ghost in my life then I have some Authority then there's some special gifts that actually come along with that when that happens brothers and sisters it changes things things are no longer the same then the word starts to open to us then we start to see Jesus Christ in every single scripture that we read we start to see that the seventh seal is open in every single scripture that we read we don't look at the scriptures and say oh it's only six it's only six seals that are open even though that's what the word says if you look at it if you listen to The Prophet The Prophet says only six seals in the seals but if you go just a little bit further even the splice past the splice in the seventh seal but if you get into Christ is the mystery of God reveal you get into some of the other messages later on he says it very clearly that all the seals are open every all of them every single one of them Satan doesn't want us to believe they are if he can get us to believe anything different than what the word says then what was delivered by the prophet in our day then he's got us beat and he will be as religious as can be he'll come polished up the church and he'll go toe-to-toe and and argue quotes and and be able to quote scripture and be able to do it all except for take all of the word that's the true test the ability to take all of the word I just want to encourage us tonight and and I could probably just summarize it right here is that brothers and sisters if we've got the token in our lives if we've met the requirements we might not feel like it and we never I don't think we'll ever really feel like it because when we actually truly get that revelation it doesn't puff us up we don't get puffed up we get humble because we really recognize that God did it all there's nothing I could put on myself in terms of clothing garments there's nothing that I could say there's nothing that I could do he did it all from before the foundation of the world we were in his mind before there was even a molecule is what the prophet said before there was even angels to worship him before there was a world before Adam and Eve before all the prophets before all the Old Testament Saints before all the New Testament all of it we were in him all the way through out of here recognize Act on Word 1960. I'm just going to read a little bit kind of pertains to this tonight we'll just see what the Lord will do he says as I would speak if I had time on the squirrels the other day about turn me around I never seen it before and and I couldn't do it Hattie sitting back there looking at me how could that ever happen how could it ever happen it couldn't have done it but it was inspired it was quickened the word was spoke and it was made so Hallelujah where was that word spoke there was a voice that spoke to the prophet but then the prophet actually spoke the word so brothers and sisters tonight I want to just say that there has to be a revelation that comes to you but when it comes to you speak it don't be afraid of it don't be afraid to speak the word it's Satan that wants us to be afraid to speak the word and you know the only thing that really holds back the defeat of Satan in our day brothers and sisters I just feel so inspired to speak this tonight is US speaking the word we don't have to understand it and we don't have to explain it and Satan's going to come around and say well I want you to explain that or how could you understand that I need to understand that a little more the doctor said this and you're going to tell me that I don't understand how those two dots connect you don't have to understand Satan wants you to understand God said just believe the prophet said only believe all things are possible brothers and sisters how could it ever have happened it couldn't have done it but it was inspired it was quickened the word was spoke and it was made so Hallelujah Paul could you imagine him saying I've been out on this sea 14 days and nights and no stars are moon nor the Sun or nothing guess I'll just go up and tell them be of good courage because God will take care of us anyhow he says oh God don't work like that God doesn't do that your faith is all right brother your faith is wonderful but until the thing is inspired I just love how the prophet takes this and he just lays it out and I'm saying it real slow I'm just trying to make it real clear I just want to really try and and and and and get this point tonight just hit on this real good tonight he says oh here's a red light hanging here and and if I see I say well I've got my foot on the accelerator I've got a car I can go through that light Yonder making 120 miles an hour that's true I can feel the power under my foot but you'd better wait till the go sign Hallelujah some of us here tonight we've got cars that have lots of power and and you can step on the accelerator and you can really feel the power go so you could probably relate to what the prophet is saying here says I can feel the power under my foot but you better wait till the go sign Hallelujah so we're just building this here brothers and sisters we're taking our time and just talking slowly we've got to be careful to make sure that what we're talking about is inspired he says do you get what I'm meaning when the go sign comes on all right when the things inspired to you and God makes it known like he did back there all right but until he does it we got a bunch of juditarians impersonating walking along like saying well I'm just the same as they are I'm a Christian too he goes on to say oh don't you remember the sons of Siva Siva went out and said we adjure you ajure you in the name of Jesus who Paul preaches come out he said Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are you who are you brother Branham says the hour is coming when right and Wrongs made manifest it shows in the Christian today it shows in the churches today it shows and the people today I'm holding you along I want I want this to get to you Paul never said I believe I'll just go and say well be of a good courage no what did he do remember when he was on the ship maybe we should be reading that tonight but I just didn't feel inspired to it just came out on the quote but remember when he was on the ship what did he do brother Bradham says he heard an angel I'm just going to pause there for a second Paul heard an angel he know that was the same angel that always spoke to him he recognized it so now I'm gonna just change gears a little bit I'm going to step on the accelerator and I'm going to drop the clutch let's just flip over in our minds to Revelations 10. let's just turn there for a second Revelations 10 verse 1. Revelations 10 verse 1 very familiar scripture the Hallmark of the message believer today Revelations 10. verse 1. and I saw another Mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was in his was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the seat his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders had uttered their voices when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and right them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven the things therein are and the earth and the things that there and are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh what when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now maybe I'm stretching this a little bit but let's just go back and hear this Paul never said I believe I'll just go up and say well be of a good courage no what did he do he heard an angel brothers and sisters have you heard an angel if we've heard an angel do we not have the authority to stand upon the word for our day we don't have to give Satan any ground he is an absolute Thief a liar and a squatter and he has no Authority even though he'll present us with symptoms in our lives or circumstances it's irrelevant he has no Authority and we need to continue to confess that he's a liar and he has no Authority there's no ground for him to stand on there's no grounds for him to stand on as an accuser of the Brethren he can go and stand in front of the Lord Jesus Christ day and night but that lamb has already gone and taken the book he's already taken the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne it's over Satan has no grounds to stand upon he can try and accuse us all he wants to Paul never said I believe I'll just go up and say well be of a good courage no what did he do he heard an angel and what did that angel say I bet you that angel said you know what Paul you recognize my voice if you recognize my voice I want you to hear this I want you to hear that you have thus saith the Lord and what you say is the same thing as me saying it and when you say it under that Authority the authority of the angel that was leading him when you speak it under that Authority all Heaven has to back up your your word not my word your word I bet that angel told him you know what Paul you follow me the way that I've instructed you then you have thus saith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with that word you'll never ask amiss but look at this situation here if if you compare that quote out of pick your propane and write in our scripture that we read earlier over in Acts 19. there were some people that never had thus saith the Lord the seven sons of Siva and they should have kept still because it wasn't made known to them personally they didn't recognize that Angel's voice but here in this quote he says Paul never said I believe I'll just go up and say well be of a good courage no what did he do he heard an angel he knowed that was the same angel that always spoke to him he recognized it brothers and sisters we're not going to hear William Miriam Branham come to us maybe we would see him in a dream or a vision or something like that but we know what what he even said about it that that's what we will hear though and what we will recognize is that that angel spoke the same word that Paul spoke the same word that's in the word it's the same thing it won't be a different word so we have the ability to know that it's the same thing that it's the Lord Jesus Christ speaking to us it's what Paul preached is what brother Branham preached when we hear Brother Branham as an angel speaking to us we begin to actually recognize it just like Paul said I recognize Brother Brad I'm saying I recognize that voice when you turn on a tape and you hear good evening friends is that brother Brad I'm speaking to you or is that the angel of the Lord speaking to you I believe once those seals are completely open it's not Brother Brad I'm speaking to you it's the Lord Jesus Christ speaking to you saying good evening friend do you know who's here it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's that one that descended from heaven with the Shout with the rainbow around his head and put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and declared that there will be time no more because it's finished that book of redemption is now back on Earth in the hands of man again Revelations 10 1-7 that angel that that voice that he heard he always recognized it he recognized it because he was the one that spoke to him all the time it's no different for us brothers and sisters I believe that we have authority and I know that we all have heard it uh probably till the cows come home but I just want to try and encourage us don't look for something else we have it all in our hands right now it's not going to get any better than this maybe we'll be able to gather together maybe we'll have be able to have a few more people or maybe some better instruments but the word isn't going to get any better we have the perfect word it's completely open and we can see our names inside and outside of the word brother Branham says then he acted Paul acted he went up and said be of a good courage for the angel of the Lord whose servant I am stood by me last night showing me a vision that there will be nothing lost on this ship be of a good courage go eat your dinner now everything's all right amen when it's inspired to you when God makes it right so looking at the scripture tonight brothers and sisters to look at this evil spirit and think about our lives and all the different circumstances and situations that we encounter in our lives to think that we we have the authority in our lives but Satan will come around and and he'll say the same thing that he said to the seven sons of Siva brother Branham I know and and and Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are you and don't think for a second that he won't say the exact same thing to you and I because he will but remember the prophet for our day said she has thus saith the Lord and the mind of Christ to know what to do with that and she has thus saith the Lord if she keeps still so where are you tonight I want to ask that question are you just going to keep still brothers and sisters don't keep still speak the word speak the word with authority who are we tonight Paul I know brother Bradham I know but who are you so maybe I would just title that tonight this little message who are you so tonight I just want to say this maybe as a bit of a rhetorical question Satan asking me asking you who are you to think that you have authority to cast out someone to to come and stand toe-to-toe with me when when I was created co-equal with God except for the ability to create nobody has the ability to match wits I know all about history I know all about everything about everything how dare you come and stand toe-to-toe with Satan and try and have any Authority that's what he's gonna do he's going to resist it with all of his might brothers and sisters and you know the only ones on Earth right now that have authority to stand up to Satan are the sons of God the Sons and Daughters of God they're the only ones nobody else has the ability to stand up to Satan so you know I would say this well Satan and I just want to encourage us any time we encounter these situations in our lives and and it feels like we have a little bit of Courage coming up to us we remember that voice that angel that's saying Speak the word and then you'll hear a louder voice saying oh look at those people over there they're going to look at you and think you're crazy if you're going to speak the word something weird is going to happen I wouldn't do it if I were you because Paul I know and brother Branham I knew they were both prophets they were both Mighty Men of God but who are you who are you you pity little human well I'll tell you who I am Satan I want to tell you I believe that I'll just step back and I'll tell you exactly who I am not according to me but according to what my father says about me remember Satan back in Job 1 there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord remember that he remembers that brothers and sisters I think I'm out of batteries bear with me for a second this is just about to get fun I'm sorry I should have done this before much brother I'll be good now okay now Hallelujah Satan remember in job one there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and and you came also among them remember that and the Lord said unto you once cometh thou and you answered that I just I just came from going to and fro in the earth walking up and down in it he remembers that that was a very specific time this wasn't something made up or a vision there was a very specific account and Satan remembers it and and I think it's good to just go back and remind him of that show him that there's an identification in the word job 2 remember this Satan again there was a day where the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and you came also to present yourself with them remember that that's why brothers and sisters it's important it's the word it's scriptural there's a day where the sons of God present themselves before the Lord we don't stay at home if we've got the opportunity to the prophet said that every time the doors are open right but Satan he doesn't want us to remember this he doesn't want us to speak this word this way he wants us to keep quiet he wants us to just be still because maybe we just don't have the saith the Lord remember if you've met the requirements according to the prophet of Malachi 4 you have all of the authority you're a son of God that's all you have to realize is that you're a son or a daughter of God and and all authority in heaven is given unto you when you speak he speaks in job 2 remember Satan there was a day where the sons of God presented himself and you remember it you remember it well Job 38 whereupon the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone whereof thereof when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy I just can't help but imagine Satan remembers that vividly he understands this language he knows it better than most theologians do but brothers and sisters think about that when the morning star sang together when all of the Heavenly hosts all of the Angels sang together and and you and I shouted for Joy we're not talking about some time that's that's going to be in the future we're talking about eternity here there's no time here this this is a a space this is a place where Satan remembers vividly we just have a little spiritual Amnesia because we just bypassed our theophany and we just came here through through through natural birth through the natural cause but you know when that when that sea Gene of God has that blood token applied it's it's not a literal blood but it's a spiritual blood when that blood is applied then we have the token in our lives and full obedience to the word entitles us to the what to the Token in our lives and when we have the token in our lives then we begin to see this the spiritual Amnesia that we've been given by bypassing our theophany it begins to fade and every once in a while we just get a glimpse of remembering what it was like to shout for joy where the sons of God sang together take them to to John one and just read some of this that we've been reading right remember John 1 the first first first book of John the first chapter of John that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world life the ability to have breath in our nostrils that that life that God gave adam when he formed him out of the Dust of the earth that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not the world doesn't recognize us because he's in the world today but the world knows him not but the Sons and Daughters of God that's a different story brothers and sisters and I'll tell you what Satan he knows it too and every time we talk like this I believe his knees knocked together his Devils don't know what to do when we start to talk like this because they have no Authority and the more we speak this way the more we will come to the recognition that we don't have to tolerate Satan and his antics he came unto his own in his own received him not but as many as received him have you received him tonight as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name Glory what a tremendous thing it is to believe on his name tonight those which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh not talking about natural birth here we're talking about bypassing our theophanes and coming from him from before the foundation of the world those which were born not of blood not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Born Again Sons and Daughters of God those that have had the new birth they recognize who they are and brothers and sisters just like then so it is today and the Word was made flesh I would say and the word is made flesh and dwelling among us and we behold his glory the Glorious of only the begotten of the father I'm sorry I just get carried away with this because I love talking like this to Satan so he can hear my voice I want him to know where I stand brothers and sisters I want them to know that I'm recognizing my position I want Satan and all of his cronies to hear it loud and clear I don't have to tolerate his garbage in my life and neither do you remind him Romans chapter 8 verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth where in you amen therefore brethren we are not debtors we are debtors I mean not to the flesh to live after the flesh we don't have to say that we're captive to the Flesh and we have to accept everything the way it is and it's just the way it is and that's all it is Satan's going to do his thing we live in Satan's Eden so it has to be that way no no I believe there's been generations of people that have been that way generations of people that have said unless you have thus saith the Lord you just keep still I don't want to act I don't want to get crazy I don't want to dance in the spirit I don't want to shout if if I feel inspired to just do something wild like maybe speak in tongues people might look down on me brothers and sisters the spirit of God where the spirit of God is there's liberty that's what the word says brother Branham says people in the world will get right into whatever it is they're into they'll go to a hockey game and when someone scores they'll jump up and scream yeah oh isn't it good isn't it good brothers and sisters we don't want to sit around like we're a bunch of dried up sticks we want to say that we're Sons and Daughters of the most high god with full Authority and power we know why we're here therefore brethren we are not debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die we don't live after the flesh but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live not just live in this world not just have breath in your lungs but have eternal life not Eternal separation from God but this is where it gets good this is where the rubber meets the road Mr Satan when you want to ask me who are ye I'll tell you I'll tell you for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and you know what I hang out with a bunch of people that are led by the spirit of God I don't hang out with people that are debtors to the flesh that are afraid to speak the word that aren't interested in actually standing up and having full Authority and power understanding that all Heaven is just waiting just just waiting for Sons and Daughters of God to speak the word so they can come and back it up brother Branham said that he wants to bless us a thousand times more than we're willing how far below our privilege do we live brothers and sisters if we've got the seventh Angels message if we've truly received the message of Malachi 4 then what do we have to fear what do we have to just accept and tolerate you know what did David accept and tolerate he said you know I can't believe that everyone has this this lack of Revelation here that we are the chosen we have followed the word of the lord we are in our inheritance we are in the promised land the word says that when we're here that nothing can actually stand before us but we're afraid of this giant what's going on it's hysteria everyone is saying they're afraid of it so everyone's becoming afraid of it but you know the spirit of God it only takes one man is what brother Bradham said just let the spirit of God hit one man and watch out that's where the revival can happen and you know brothers and sisters I just want to encourage one person tonight to get that revival going in your life don't allow Satan to come around and make you feel like you don't have it feelings have nothing to do with it speak the word speak the word Empower God to move in your life not a self-help thing brothers and sisters this is the original life for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God if you're led by the spirit of God brothers and sisters you might get into your life and you might have situations where things become Troublesome Things become weary in your life you might become confused but remember when you start to feel a certain way there's always something that comes back remember you hear that voice you hear that Angel's voice it comes back to you and and and you just hear it say something it just Rings true and maybe you'll just say maybe I just need to listen to the word maybe I just need to push push play on a message and just something happens you know what that is that's the spirit of God leading you brothers and sisters remember when that happens that happens because you are a son and a daughter of God if you didn't have his spirit in you you wouldn't care don't worry about your feelings just remember recognize those little cues when you have that desire in your heart it's it's the Lord Jesus Christ knocking saying hey hey buddy don't forget about me don't don't worry about all the stuff going on in your life just look to me just look at me and and everything will work out for ye have not received received the spirit of bondage again to fear brothers and sisters if you've received the message of the hour if you've got the token in your life you haven't received the spirit of bondage again to fear we're not going back to fear if we go backwards to fear then we're actually going backwards in the message we're going back decades in the message is that what we're doing we don't want to do that let's go forwards let's call out kovid let's call out diseases let's see the Lord move in our lives don't be afraid to speak the word be afraid not to for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father because we know who we are we know that we're children Sons and Daughters of the most high God Satan hates hearing this brothers and sisters he hates it because he wishes he was a son because his son receives the full inheritance of the father why do they receive it why does the son receive it just because they're a part of the father it's really hit me so hard recently how important it is to just tell our children that we're proud of them why because there are children not because they accomplish stuff sure it's nice and it makes us proud when we see our children Excel and do well but don't let that be the Hallmark of why you're proud of them brothers and sisters let them know that you're proud of them because they're yours your pride and joy imagine that if it was that way with God then that would mean there would have to be something that we could do in order for him to be proud of us what could we ever do to to measure up to God there's nothing it's only because we recognize who we are brothers and sisters that's the only thing because it's Spirit Bears witness with our spirit that we are sons of God oh my and if we're children then we're heirs and heirs with God and and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffered with him that we may be also glorified together I just love how he says this for I reckon the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in who think about David when he was running down screaming this out probably to all the people around him who cares what everyone else thinks look at the glory that's going to be revealed in US let's take these little five rocks of faith and go and slay this giant in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ The Mighty Jehovah the one that delivered us into the land I reckon the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US brothers and sisters what I would say is when we have a trial in our life run to it don't run from it run to it Satan wants us to run from it he wants to put us on the run but when we stop and we turn around and say uh you're a bluff you have no Authority you have no power and you know as far as I can tell the prophet of Malachi 4 said that I have it and I accept it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that means that you are now powerless before me because that's what the prophet said what happened he prophesied that and nothing can stop a prophecy from a prophet of God hallelujah someone has to be the one who is going to have that Glory revealed in them Romans chapter 8 verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature it waiteth for the manifestation of what the sons of God brothers and sisters if we have the ability to receive the word for our day that's our identification that we are the sons of God and it doesn't matter what we feel Satan says who are ye I'll tell you who I am I'm a son of the most high God and there ain't nothing you can do to change that you you can even try try to take my life but you can never take my life because I am a part of him and I was in him before the foundation of the world before you were even created Satan I was in him you can't kill me because you can't kill him Philippians 2 satan wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not in my PR as in my presence only but now much more in my absence we work out you said Paul's saying here to the Philippians work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world don't want to be disputing and murmuring brothers and sisters again that's just playing into Satan's trap Satan's Eden he wants us to be disputing he wants us to be murmuring he wants us to be in that situation but when we start to recognize who we are and and we can see that we're not doing that we're able to to present ourselves blameless and harmless because we come according to the word we know who's in control we don't have to get upset what is there to get upset about what is there to worry about either God is in control or he's not and you know brothers and sisters when we start getting upset and making fusses and start murmuring and complaining about whatever it is we're doing that about you know what happens is we start to actually take away the credibility of God being God what we're doing is giving credibility to Satan and we're taking away from being Sons and Daughters of God the power of the most high in our lives and we're just handing it over to Satan we're saying that's okay I'd rather just complain and murmur go ahead you know have my power and authority but when we say no I don't like what's happening but hey you know what the Lord he's got it all under control and I know that he's brought us this far and he'll continue to take us all the way through I know whom I have believed and that he is able to deliver me he's able to give me he's able to bring me he's able to show me whatever it is I need he's able to because he's God do all things without murmurings and disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights in this world as Sons and Daughters of God when we just live our lives it's just what we do we see a situation come along and we want to get upset by it we want to get flustered by it maybe we want to have a temper maybe we want to say things or do things but the word says to take every thought into captivity filter it see whose voice we're going to give credit to who who are we going to give power to in our lives because we're going to give power to one or the other it's either God or it's Satan there's no in betweens there's no gray area it's one of the other I just like verse 16 here of this this chapter in Philippians holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain to think this is Paul talking about this trying to encourage the children of God that you are Sons and Daughters of God so take that Word of Promise and run with it don't don't neglect the great salvation that was given to you don't don't neglect all of this ability to understand that you're you're a light shining in this evil World in this dark world that you have the ability to be a son and a daughter of God without rebuke blameless in this world Before the Throne might not feel like it don't look at feelings we don't want to look at our feelings Satan wants us to look at our feelings we want to look to the word we just want to completely repeat the word back to Satan no the word says that I'm a son of God that I don't I don't have to go back to the spirit of bondage again to fear no no no no no no I've met the requirements and I know that I've been given the Holy Ghost and and maybe my flesh gets a little bit scared every once in a while but that's just Satan coming around and trying to see if he's got any action here you know what the word says that when when the spirit is cast out of a man and it's garnished it's all swept out the man is in great shape you have to have that token you better have it because if you don't that spirit's going to come back around and see if there's any action there at that house if there's a party going on and if that door is open if we don't have the token there brothers and sisters he's going to bring seven more worse Devils with them into our lives and they're going to have a party in US we need to make sure we got that token and when we do he's going to come around and he's going to try he's going to knock on our door Satan's gonna do that he's going to be a box of rattlesnakes plopped on our step and and maybe like I said before the Box might break open and little snakes will go everywhere but if we've got the token they can't touch us we can push that box back and say uh I don't care what the doctor says you know I honestly believe that's what that's what all Heaven is just waiting for us to say in our lives and you know maybe someone's saying to me tonight that's easy for you to say maybe one day I'll have to say it but what did Brother Branham say don't accept it that's what the prophet of Malachi 4 said don't accept it he's the one that said you can actually get the Holy Ghost if you actually get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so which one of those statements Bears more gravity which one is is greater having the understanding that we can get the Holy Ghost in our life is the greatest for sure but to think about it brothers and sisters whether we live or whether we die we're christs it doesn't matter Satan whatever you want to do you can't touch this life this is Zoe God's own life right here talking to you right now in first John first John chapter 3. as we close I'll call the musicians behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us this is probably my my favorite verse in the Bible behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us to think about it brothers and sisters 7.8 billion people and and some people can say that that that the Lord the father hath bestowed just a certain love upon us that we should be called the sons of God how can that possibly be how could it be that we would be called the sons of God his choice the only thing that we can do is just thank him for it just Rejoice remember this is the quietest place that we're ever going to live it's going to be pretty loud over there and I'm just going to blow my voice out over there on that side but you know what I won't be able to because it's going to be a perfect voice box and here maybe here I'll have to have a little bit of laryngitis for a while because I'll blow my voice out here who cares it'll be for the right cause the word says to make a Joyful Noise behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us Satan he's bestowed it upon us not you you only wish you only wish but you'll never have it and there's a day coming in in Revelations 20 verse 10 or written sorry yeah 20 verse 10 where you'll be cast alive into the Lake of Fire and and your smoke will go up forever and ever before the Saints that's the same Lake that the false prophet and and what the the Beast yeah they are that's that's where you'll go and you know what we'll go and sit with him in his throne because that's where he's ordained us for behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not I just believe brothers and sisters we've got a reason to Rejoice we don't need to worry we don't need to fear all we need to do is remind Satan when he comes around and tries to give us all these troubles and trials in our lives just remind them it's only for God's perfecting us it's only for my benefit it's only so that he can express himself through my life he's only going to get Glory out of this situation that's the only thing that's going to happen there's some people that would say dumb devil you know he's not dumb he's pretty smart he's got all of the cunningness he's a he's a worthy adversary but you know what he'll never ever ever ever be able to compete with God's word on your lips ever Prophet for our day said that God's word will defeat Satan any place any time in any situation brothers and sisters beloved [Music] are we the sons of God I just believe we could just have a shouting fit right there beloved now are we the sons of God so everyone who is beloved of the father now where are we the sons of God and and Satan I know you're listening and and I hope that my voice chases you to the ends of the Earth listen to this behold beloved now are we the sons of God it's not going to be some time it's not a a pipe dream it's not a fictitious tale it's the word of God and you know it better than most theologians but when this word is actually spoken on the lips of a Son of God oh my goodness gracious beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not appear yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him like he is how are we going to see him brothers and sisters how are we going to recognize him when we we recognize what's going on inside us but when we have that that song in our lives listen to our hearts when we say that word is working mightily in me it doesn't matter what I I see or feel it doesn't matter that word is just is doing it but I just I just love saying this it just rings so true on the hearts on the on the on the lips of a Believer a son and daughter of God but love now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is remember that we were created in His image he chose exactly us for a purpose and as we look at one another brothers and sisters don't look at one another and say oh that's for the justice and and and that's brother Toby and that's brother miles don't do that say look at my precious brother look at my my precious sister look at this precious life that the Lord has brought together here to be with us to Fellowship to think that God's spirit dwells in them oh my goodness we need to be careful when we talk about our brothers and our sisters because I'll tell you you know it but I'm just gonna say it that's deity Tabernacle didn't flesh right there and our brothers and our sisters and you know what it's up to God to discern that it's not up to us we don't ever want to be the one doing that just allow God to do it just just speak good speak positive speak the word give God the opportunity to shine in our lives brothers and sisters don't get caught up in the in the in the fusses of the day don't do that don't get caught up in that just speak the word behold now are we the sons of God we know that we're the sons of God don't worry about what it feels like don't worry about what it looks like in anybody else just speak the word and go forwards speak the word and go forwards just believe because all things are possible stand with me tonight [Music] beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is you know I keep saying that over and over for a reason because the prophet for our day of Malachi 4 Revelations 10 7 brother Branham he said that he's appearing now his appearing is now how many years ago was that I'm sure someone out there knows 50 years ago probably 40 60 many years ago was his appearing and we know that we shall be like him brothers and sisters I just wanted to try to encourage you speak the word tonight don't be afraid don't let fear come on we haven't been given that Spirit of bondage again back to fear we've been given the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father because we know who we are let's just bow in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful for your word we're so thankful for your grace and your mercy Lord we're so thankful for the position that you have chosen each one of us Lord to be here to represent in this Dying World father Lord we know that the the last Ministry is to the total lost and father this is the darkest of all the ages Lord It's Satan's Eden this is the only age that your Prophet said that Satan was declared the God of this age and father we know that just like Satan crept into the garden and and he beguiled Adam's wife oh Father this age you have come down and you have also taken a wife of your own choosing but Lord we know that you didn't have to beguile her all you had to do is speak to her gently and she recognized that voice and Lord Jesus when your voice when your sweet voice spoke to that seed Gene in your Eve in this evil age oh Father this it's just a life came to her father and Lord tonight here we are understanding that we truly are now the sons of God that we are truly now seated together in Heavenly places with you in Christ Jesus father I pray the words were spoken tonight Lord would just be an encouragement to your children Lord that we wouldn't live in in the in the in the spirit of bondage to fear oh Lord but that we would have authority in our lives that we would recognize Who We Are that we would have your word on our lips and that we would be able to recognize Satan every time that he speaks and father that we would just put him down and cast him out in the name of Jesus Christ because when we speak we know that it's not just us speaking it's you speaking so father we just want to give you the full preeminence in every one of our Lives Lord Jesus if there's anything in our lives that we need to correct we pray that you would just give us the strength to do it father Lord that you would just Lord hear our hearts father our hearts desire is to serve you with all of our might father we just long to be more like you we pray that you would just go with us as we go our separate ways father and that if it Be Your Will for us to meet again on Sunday that you would just Lord come and dwell with us again come and fellowship with us again come and speak to us again Lord Jesus one more time just tell us a little bit more about who we are oh father that we could come to that recognition about about what we are in this age because we know when that happens your your Prophet said the Rapture will go on father that's our desire is to see that Rapture go but until then father we just want to be about your business we want to do exactly your will father we just want to be ready to listen to your voice to hear and recognize and act upon your voice father we just love you tonight we thank you for your grace and your mercy and we pray now that you would just be glorified in a couple songs as we go our separate ways keep your hand upon each one of us we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen oh how do you explain how do you describe a love that flows from east to west and runs as deep as it is why oh you know all our homes you know all our fears and words could not express the love we feel but we long for you to hear if you listen to our hearts hear our Spirits say a song of Praise that flows those you have redeemed [Music] use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are but words are not enough to tell you of our love so listen to our hearts words could fall like rage from these lips of mine and if I had a thousand years I would still run out of time so if you listen to our hearts Hearts Every Beat will say oh thank you for the life thank you for the truth Lord thank you for the way listen to our hearts hear our spirit says a song of Praise that flow s from those you have redeemed we will use the words we know to tell you what an awesome God you are but words are not enough to tell you of our love so listen to our hearts Hallelujah can we sing 287 Jehovah Jireh Jehovah lie providers you are more than enough for me [Music] You're My Healer by your stripes I am set free Jehovah [Music] thank you you are with new Supply
