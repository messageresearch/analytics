[42:15] that's all the thing it will do thank
[42:17] you very much uh
[42:20] I would like us to
[42:22] maybe save whatever minutes we can get
[42:26] and I intend not to take too much time
[42:28] today
[42:30] so with the help of God um
[42:33] I'm not sure if the clicker is there
[42:36] I have all the quotes here though but
[42:39] they are always helpful
[42:51] praise the name of the Lord all right so
[42:53] we'll go into the scripture
[42:56] um
[42:58] there are quite a few uh prayer requests
[43:02] here
[43:04] um first of all sister Marion has a
[43:06] praise report I think she brought a
[43:08] prayer request for her mom and her
[43:11] testimonies that the mom is feeling well
[43:13] right now so may the name of the Lord be
[43:16] praised
[43:19] um yes I got a text from Brother Berry
[43:22] thank you my brother I got a text from
[43:25] Brother Berry and uh
[43:28] he sends his regards and
[43:32] apparently the time where he could just
[43:34] fly under the radar is done
[43:36] so they are putting him to work in
[43:38] Saskatoon
[43:43] he might be the pulpit by now
[43:46] yes but he sent around a request for a
[43:51] brother Caleb
[43:53] from Bible Believers assembly in New
[43:55] York I think he's a minister there and
[43:59] he's been diagnosed with the brain tumor
[44:02] and I think it is to be operated
[44:04] tomorrow morning
[44:06] and so let's pray for the large will to
[44:09] be done especially that like the wife
[44:14] says that this could be benign which is
[44:18] the best case scenario that we could
[44:20] wish for in such a situation
[44:23] yeah again we remember Zach brother
[44:26] Berry's nephew and the family as well so
[44:30] if you have any requests
[44:33] uplifted hand and let's go before him
[44:37] our precious Heavenly Father we thank

[47:18] let's put that aside and let you take
[47:21] control in Jesus Christ name do we pray
[47:24] amen
[47:26] thank you very much uh let's go to
[47:29] Revelations 13.
[47:40] Revelations 13.
[47:42] um
[47:55] so Revelations 13 8.
[48:01] maybe I'll just read seven and eight
[48:07] all right Revelations 13 7 it says and
[48:12] it was given unto him to make war with
[48:15] the Saints
[48:16] and to overcome them
[48:18] and power was giving him over all
[48:20] kindreds and tongues and Nations
[48:23] and all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[48:26] worship Him whose names are not written
[48:28] in the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[48:30] from the foundation of the world
[48:33] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[48:35] reading of his word you may be seated
[48:41] Hallelujah
[48:43] and so just before I care my I got this
[48:47] text from a friend
[48:52] and he's talking about all the disasters
[48:55] that are happening and
[48:57] like in the Pacific there is fire and
[49:00] then in the Atlantic there's rain like
[49:02] you have Maui and Kelowna and other
[49:06] parts of BC and Yellow knife and people
[49:09] are displaced and
[49:10] thousands are moved
[49:13] and then you go to the Atlantic and rain
[49:17] and floods and hurricane
[49:21] and Southern California there's an
[49:22] earthquake
[49:24] and so ah
[49:26] matters every time I think of these
[49:29] things or when these things happen I
[49:31] always think
[49:32] Lord be with the Believers there
[49:35] but
[49:37] it's always a confirmation of the fact
[49:39] that the word of God is true
[49:42] that the only shelter is in the Lord
[49:44] Jesus Christ that outside of that there
[49:47] is no hope anyway
[49:50] and so what we see an increase in the
[49:52] birth pains
[49:53] praise the name of the Lord
[49:56] aren't you glad that we have a shelter
[49:58] Hallelujah
[50:01] anyway it's great to worship a living
[50:04] God
[50:05] it has to come before him in sincerity
[50:07] just to come before him in humility just
[50:11] think of his greatness and his goodness
[50:13] and maybe our littleness before him and
[50:16] yet he cares for us and I I believe when
[50:19] you allow yourself without any
[50:21] inhibition and you contemplate on most
[50:24] of these things you end up really giving
[50:28] him back
[50:29] our gratitude
[50:31] because that is what it is there is
[50:34] nobody that we could go to and demand
[50:36] why didn't God do this or that and yet
[50:39] he cares for us he cares for every
[50:41] detail of our life
[50:43] praise the name of the Lord I know it
[50:46] sounds strange to begin with someone
[50:47] this way but that is what it is that he
[50:50] really cares
[50:52] Hallelujah and so every time we
[50:55] contemplate on him like this he
[50:58] responds He makes himself known when we
[51:02] are able to seal out the world and focus
[51:05] on him you will always meet him you will
[51:08] always see him why because he loves
[51:10] Fellowship praise the name of the Lord
[51:12] and that is how I want to start that the
[51:15] lord loves Fellowship I'm talking about
[51:18] ordained to stand
[51:21] or then to stand in this end time
[51:24] and the scripture says that the Lord
[51:26] laughs he dwells in the Praises of his
[51:29] people praise the name of the Lord and
[51:32] so even when they are not coming out of
[51:34] your lips even as you are meditating on
[51:37] him he still draws near praise the name
[51:40] of the Lord now I'm starting with this
[51:42] quote from says we will see Jesus
[51:45] all right
[51:47] says we will see Jesus brother Ram says
[51:49] the very word god means object of
[51:52] worship
[51:53] so God likes to be worshiped by his
[51:56] children
[51:57] that we can be free and not bound down
[51:59] in Yorks but we can exercise our faith
[52:03] in him and believe it and not be ashamed
[52:06] to tell the world about it that Jesus
[52:09] Christ raised from the dead lives and
[52:12] Reigns in our hearts and we are not
[52:14] ashamed of it
[52:15] doesn't make our face red to testify of
[52:19] the glory of Jesus Christ for he is
[52:21] worthy of all praise don't you believe
[52:24] that
[52:26] Hallelujah and so worship and tells far
[52:30] more than just singing in church right
[52:32] if you're looking through it exercising
[52:34] our faith believing him testifying not
[52:37] ashamed to to to talk about him all of
[52:41] that is part of worship and I believe
[52:44] everything we do in life that is
[52:46] consistent with scripture is part of
[52:48] worship
[52:49] praise the name of the Lord and so when
[52:53] you walk with people
[52:55] oh this is I believe in brother this is
[52:57] a sister we are all believers
[52:59] and they live a life as if they never
[53:02] had what the word said about what is
[53:04] going on
[53:05] what do you do you take a stand
[53:07] and you let it be known that for you
[53:10] that word means everything and when you
[53:12] do that what are you doing you are
[53:13] worshiping the Lord praise the name of
[53:16] the Lord halleluia
[53:19] every time we live according to our
[53:21] scriptural expectations what we are
[53:24] saying is the word means more to us than
[53:26] everything else when you live when you
[53:29] think when you say when you do and all
[53:32] is according to scripture you are
[53:34] worshiping
[53:35] but the other side of it is that when
[53:37] you know when they go on scriptural
[53:39] then you are also acknowledging the
[53:42] source of that influence and that
[53:44] influences not from God
[53:46] and so these are the things that we have
[53:47] to know because the devil is also
[53:49] actively seeking worship from us and
[53:52] that is precisely what I'm going to talk
[53:54] about today praise the name of the Lord
[53:57] now in Isaiah 14
[54:00] the scripture says in Acts 14 13 it says
[54:04] for thou has said in thine heart I will
[54:06] Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my
[54:09] throne above the Stars praise the name
[54:11] of the Lord and that is the devil
[54:13] speaking right there but Abraham picks
[54:16] this up in the message uh the God of
[54:19] this evil age and then he says
[54:28] okay
[54:30] and then he says it was Satan's ambition
[54:32] to be worshiped like God
[54:35] he took two thirds two-thirds of the
[54:38] stars of Heaven ascended himself above
[54:41] those stars and preached them and
[54:43] deceived two-thirds of them you see it
[54:46] all right notice that's his ambition
[54:50] now it you see that it says it was
[54:53] Satan's ambition now he says that's his
[54:56] ambition now when we say ambition
[54:59] it's a strong desire
[55:01] and oftentimes you work to achieve it
[55:03] and the devil has not yet achieved that
[55:06] why worship entails
[55:11] um how would I say willingly and
[55:14] knowingly
[55:15] giving that worship but every time he
[55:18] has achieved worship it has been through
[55:21] deception and so he's never had true
[55:23] worship praise the name of the Lord and
[55:26] so that is now if you watch this it says
[55:29] for God it says he loves to be worshiped
[55:32] but for Satan says it's his ambition
[55:36] Hallelujah
[55:37] and so those are the differences that
[55:40] it's never a true worship Hallelujah and
[55:44] so we found out that the devil though
[55:46] has always thought
[55:48] our worship
[55:50] now I'm just
[55:51] sort of going on along those lines now
[55:54] in the handwriting on the wall program
[55:57] says everything that Satan has here on
[56:00] Earth is something that is perverted
[56:02] from God
[56:04] now even if you watch the previous uh
[56:08] code when it says it was Satan's
[56:11] ambition to be worshiped it's not the
[56:14] worship so much but to be worshiped like
[56:16] God
[56:17] that is the desire to be like God
[56:20] and so if God is worshiped then
[56:23] then they
[56:25] the devil
[56:32] the devil will also
[56:36] like
[56:38] to be worshiped
[56:42] not sure why I'm going this way
[56:56] um anyway
[56:58] I'll keep going the way I can
[57:00] okay yeah it's happening
[57:04] thank you
[57:11] yes
[57:13] this is everything Satan has on Earth
[57:15] it's something that is prevented from
[57:17] God
[57:18] God creates and Satan makes an imitation
[57:21] to race
[57:23] there is churches today on Earth great
[57:26] churches that's controlled by the devil
[57:28] it's a progression from the true church
[57:32] and so that is where we are now that if
[57:36] God has something if you see something
[57:38] genuine understand that the devil also
[57:41] has a counterfeit or sometimes in a lot
[57:44] of times the devil tries to present his
[57:46] counterfeit to us even before we meet
[57:49] the reality and so whatever you meet the
[57:53] basis of understanding and knowing what
[57:55] it is whether it's God seeking your
[57:57] worship or is the devil seeking your
[57:59] worship is to know how scriptural it is
[58:02] praise the name of the Lord
[58:04] and so
[58:07] angels
[58:09] of which the devil is
[58:12] part of
[58:13] were created by God
[58:15] and the express purpose was for worship
[58:19] Angels were created to be worshiped to
[58:22] worship God what happens the devil was
[58:25] able to prevent that worship and once he
[58:28] prevented that worship he diverted it
[58:31] into himself
[58:32] and so the Isaiah 14 that we read
[58:41] the scripture says
[58:44] that he raised his throne above the
[58:47] Stars now if you go into the Book of
[58:50] Genesis apart from the first uh chapter
[58:54] when the stars were created every
[58:56] reference to stars in Genesis is a
[58:59] reference to the descendants of Abraham
[59:02] Alleluia every reference is a reference
[59:06] to the descendants of Genesis and why am
[59:08] I saying all that the devil had two
[59:10] thirst of the angels and yet he was not
[59:11] satisfied he wanted more and so he
[59:15] raises thrown above the Earth
[59:19] all that is worshiped and that is uh the
[59:23] stress of Heaven now in Daniel and that
[59:27] is what we have there it says
[59:29] shine as the brightness of the firmament
[59:31] and did that turned many to
[59:33] righteousness as the Stars forever now
[59:37] I'm bringing these scriptures just to
[59:38] draw our attention who the focus of the
[59:41] devil's Pursuit is and that is you and I
[59:45] because everybody here who sees himself
[59:48] as a as a Seed of Abraham anybody here
[59:52] who has desired to see somebody see the
[59:54] light anybody who knows his day and his
[59:57] message anybody who is praying for
[59:59] somebody else to be saved is part of
[1:00:02] this group
[1:00:03] Hallelujah and this special group is
[1:00:06] what they want from the people from
[1:00:08] which the devil is seeking worship now
[1:00:11] it's easy for us to say well
[1:00:14] maybe we're not going to give it
[1:00:17] but it's not that easy
[1:00:19] it's easy to say that but it's not easy
[1:00:21] to do it why the devil will not come and
[1:00:23] say hey I'm a devil can you worship me
[1:00:25] yeah but it has happened before but
[1:00:27] that's not that the approach is always
[1:00:30] very deceptive
[1:00:32] and so that is where we have to Be
[1:00:34] watchful praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:36] because he's desperate for your worship
[1:00:41] and until he gets that he doesn't have
[1:00:43] true worship Hallelujah because we are
[1:00:46] the people giving willingly giving
[1:00:48] through worship
[1:00:50] Hallelujah now how does that happen
[1:00:53] every time the things that are very
[1:00:57] important to you those are the things
[1:00:59] that the devil will use
[1:01:01] and so that's why we have to be careful
[1:01:03] in our work in life we have to be
[1:01:07] careful in the things that we treasure
[1:01:09] and the things that we show to Value
[1:01:11] because there is where the devil will
[1:01:14] try to
[1:01:15] attack and I'm always a little unease
[1:01:18] when I use the word attack because yes
[1:01:20] that is what it is but it doesn't come
[1:01:22] out like that because a lot of times
[1:01:24] when you hear attack you're thinking of
[1:01:25] something active but no this is very
[1:01:28] subtle this is very smooth and still he
[1:01:31] desires that worship the Bible speaks of
[1:01:34] uh Lord's wife he says remember Lord's
[1:01:37] wife right while she was living
[1:01:40] what are the things that she treasure
[1:01:43] all her life was back there in Sodom her
[1:01:47] house was in flames
[1:01:48] her friends were inflamed
[1:01:52] her sons-in-laws were in Flames every
[1:01:55] property that she had in life was
[1:01:57] inflamed and all she did was turned once
[1:02:00] to look at it
[1:02:02] and that was all her Escape ended right
[1:02:05] there what am I saying when God calls
[1:02:09] you out of the bondage of sin what you
[1:02:11] realize is that you have to abandon
[1:02:13] every achievement that you get in the
[1:02:16] bondage of sin it's not worth hanging
[1:02:19] onto it it'll be a drug on you
[1:02:21] eventually if you're not careful that is
[1:02:24] what won't do you
[1:02:25] praise the name of the Lord
[1:02:27] now last time I stood here we're talking
[1:02:30] about Exodus 21 and in Exodus 21 we're
[1:02:34] talking about the Year of Jubilee
[1:02:36] and the fact that when uh
[1:02:40] uh you go into slavery and you are
[1:02:43] married you're going to slavery
[1:02:46] when you hear the Jubilee trumpet you
[1:02:48] are going out with your wife
[1:02:50] now when you go into slavery
[1:02:52] and your master gives you a wife
[1:02:55] when you hear the Jubilee trumpet you're
[1:02:59] going by your wife's teeth with your
[1:03:02] master
[1:03:03] now what happens if you have had
[1:03:04] children with your wife they also stay
[1:03:07] with the master now can you imagine the
[1:03:09] difficulty of the choice of either going
[1:03:12] free or staying a slave with all that
[1:03:16] you have
[1:03:17] now a lot of times most of us those are
[1:03:19] the choices that we face and that is
[1:03:21] what the devil does and so watch what he
[1:03:24] gives you in bondage
[1:03:27] because it will be a drag on you and if
[1:03:30] you are not careful that is how it is
[1:03:32] going to tie you down praise the name of
[1:03:35] the Lord
[1:03:36] now if we are not able to
[1:03:39] esteem
[1:03:41] the Lord and his Provisions above
[1:03:44] everything else we are not even free to
[1:03:47] begin with
[1:03:48] because freedom is when you've taken the
[1:03:51] word of God above everything else above
[1:03:53] logic
[1:03:54] because it doesn't make sense therefore
[1:03:57] for all that you have done the things
[1:03:59] that even you know are wrong to get to a
[1:04:02] point to say
[1:04:04] I'm forgiven
[1:04:06] how do you get there to say I'm forgiven
[1:04:09] unless the word of God means more to you
[1:04:12] than every logic then every reason
[1:04:15] praise the name of the Lord
[1:04:17] and so anyway the other side of it is if
[1:04:20] we assume God's riches above everything
[1:04:23] else then he rewards you
[1:04:26] Hallelujah and so I'm going to Mark 10
[1:04:29] and I'm reading this to you
[1:04:32] I'm reading from 29. he says and Jesus
[1:04:36] answered and said verily verily I say
[1:04:39] unto you there is no man that has left
[1:04:42] left house or Brethren or sisters or
[1:04:46] fathers or mothers or wife or children
[1:04:49] or lands for my sake and the Gospels
[1:04:53] but he shall receive a hundredfold now
[1:04:56] in this time houses and Brethren and
[1:05:00] mothers mothers is plural
[1:05:03] and children and lands with persecutions
[1:05:06] I'm glad I underlined that
[1:05:10] in the world to come and in the world to
[1:05:12] come
[1:05:13] eternal life
[1:05:15] praise the name of the Lord now with
[1:05:17] persecutions a lot of times
[1:05:20] we ignore it
[1:05:22] but it's part of the scripture it's part
[1:05:25] of the life it's part of the Gospel it's
[1:05:28] part of the call you cannot give any
[1:05:31] great thing in Scripture
[1:05:34] we just don't have an adversity attach
[1:05:36] to it
[1:05:37] actually is the adversity that brings
[1:05:39] out the goodness of God
[1:05:42] now we can talk of Israel
[1:05:46] they hear the gospel they believe it
[1:05:49] they all come under the blood in Goshen
[1:05:52] and then they walk out in Freedom
[1:05:54] and then they go on
[1:05:56] and then they get to a place
[1:05:59] they get to the Red Sea
[1:06:01] now man is not made to walk on sin
[1:06:04] and man is not work to walk on dry land
[1:06:08] through sea so that initial was a bigger
[1:06:11] problem than everything
[1:06:13] but on top of that your Pharaoh's Army
[1:06:15] coming behind
[1:06:18] and imagine you have a process of a
[1:06:21] promise of God
[1:06:23] you are taking stuff and this is what
[1:06:24] you face where is the god
[1:06:27] right so it becomes very difficult that
[1:06:29] we have to understand this and this is
[1:06:32] something that I've just I'm looking at
[1:06:34] that that seed that sea was necessary
[1:06:39] for Israel
[1:06:41] why God had already done something to
[1:06:44] them from the moment they believed the
[1:06:46] word God had done something to them they
[1:06:48] cannot be drowned there is no record of
[1:06:51] anybody drowning no not once so they
[1:06:54] cannot be drawn but how would you know
[1:06:56] it unless you are face with a C but why
[1:07:01] the sea was necessary is this a just God
[1:07:03] wants to pass Israel through the sea
[1:07:06] and then pass their enemies
[1:07:08] and show them what he has made of them
[1:07:11] so they passed through it God delivers
[1:07:14] them the enemy passes through them the
[1:07:16] devil cannot deliver them
[1:07:18] what happened to the Hebrew children is
[1:07:21] it not the same they have to go into the
[1:07:23] fire the Lord permitted it you could
[1:07:25] have doubt the fire before they go in
[1:07:27] but he permitted for them to go in
[1:07:29] and then through that he destroys their
[1:07:31] enemies with the same fire
[1:07:34] Daniel wasn't that the same he had to go
[1:07:37] in first
[1:07:38] and then the enemies were put in to
[1:07:41] prove that yes this is what it is but
[1:07:43] I've changed you
[1:07:45] praise the name of the Lord when you
[1:07:47] receive God he changes you he has
[1:07:50] strengthens you he gives you the
[1:07:52] anointing to face the adversity at hand
[1:07:54] praise the name of the Living God
[1:07:56] and so this is what we are we are going
[1:07:59] on
[1:08:02] and so when I read this scripture
[1:08:05] what I thought was that there cannot be
[1:08:07] a better investment than this
[1:08:11] because the reward is twofold
[1:08:14] fresh right here on Earth a hundredfold
[1:08:18] and then
[1:08:19] eternal life
[1:08:21] praise the name of the Lord I say don't
[1:08:24] be worrying well doing
[1:08:26] don't despair when you do what even if
[1:08:29] you are not acknowledged glorify God
[1:08:31] because you did it for the sake of the
[1:08:33] Lord
[1:08:34] praise the name of the Lord and you see
[1:08:36] it's a God who will not ignore his word
[1:08:39] he will stand by it and he'll confirm it
[1:08:43] Hallelujah
[1:08:46] now um let's read a little further
[1:08:51] um I'll go to Second Thessalonians
[1:08:54] 2.
[1:08:56] a very popular scripture that we all
[1:08:58] know
[1:09:00] it says let no man deceive You by
[1:09:03] enemies for that they shall not come
[1:09:05] except they come a falling away first
[1:09:08] and that man of sin be revealed the Son
[1:09:10] of Perdition who opposite and the
[1:09:12] soldiers himself above all that is
[1:09:15] called God all that is worshiped so that
[1:09:18] he as God seated in the temple of God
[1:09:21] showing himself that he is God
[1:09:26] this is the devil Desiring worship
[1:09:30] why would the devil sit in the temple
[1:09:33] and show himself as God
[1:09:35] of course the obvious we all know
[1:09:38] first of all he desires your worship
[1:09:40] otherwise he could also get a sample but
[1:09:43] no he wants to show himself that he is
[1:09:45] God he desires your worship that's why
[1:09:48] he's coming after but the second factor
[1:09:50] is the deception
[1:09:52] because if he comes as the devil he will
[1:09:54] never be accepted but you see I thank
[1:09:57] God so much that he raised a standard
[1:09:59] for his children Hallelujah
[1:10:01] so God in his fort by his foreign
[1:10:08] against the devil and all his devices
[1:10:10] not some not proud all
[1:10:13] the question is will the children take
[1:10:16] the standard will we adopt the standard
[1:10:20] praise the name of the Lord
[1:10:23] we know the devil has gone even before
[1:10:25] the Lord Jesus Christ to seek worship
[1:10:28] Hallelujah
[1:10:29] so nothing stops him from seeking your
[1:10:32] worship
[1:10:33] praise the name of the Lord and these
[1:10:35] are things that we have to always have
[1:10:37] in mind
[1:10:40] scared of you
[1:10:42] now
[1:10:44] he's not even scared of God just that
[1:10:47] he's been defeated Hallelujah
[1:10:49] praise the name of the Lord now you know
[1:10:53] he's seeking your worship Julio gave it
[1:10:55] to him
[1:10:57] are you going to give it to him that's
[1:10:59] the next question that we have to follow
[1:11:00] praise the name of the Lord now I will
[1:11:04] go on to something that brother Brown
[1:11:07] said about Saint Martin
[1:11:10] and I'm saying all of this to show you
[1:11:12] that there is a desperation in the
[1:11:15] Kingdom of the devil there's a
[1:11:17] desperation for worship
[1:11:19] he was created to worship
[1:11:21] he failed in his duty and now he decides
[1:11:24] to worship
[1:11:25] but now Saint Martin I think two
[1:11:28] outstanding things that Abraham says
[1:11:29] about Saint Martin that I thought it
[1:11:32] really caught my attention the first
[1:11:35] thing was Rebrand says he's a prophet
[1:11:39] now I've never heard him say that for
[1:11:41] all the reformers from the second to the
[1:11:43] sixth age before
[1:11:44] but the next thing he says is that since
[1:11:47] Jesus Christ he's not found a greater
[1:11:50] man dancing Martin
[1:11:52] and so that sort of got me really
[1:11:54] interested but then in the anointed ones
[1:11:58] at the end time
[1:12:00] anointed once at the end time he says
[1:12:03] this about Saint Martin
[1:12:07] he says I want to show you how deceiving
[1:12:09] the devil is
[1:12:11] one day he was sitting in a study
[1:12:13] talking about Saint Martin now upcoming
[1:12:15] a mighty Angel crowned on his head
[1:12:17] golden shoes on lays around his garments
[1:12:20] of gold and said Martin do you know me
[1:12:25] he said I'm your lord and savior I'm the
[1:12:29] one that saved you worship me Martin
[1:12:31] but that Prophet knowing there was a
[1:12:34] little something strange there he kept
[1:12:36] looking at him he said Martin I'm your
[1:12:38] savior Jesus Christ worship me don't you
[1:12:41] know me Martin
[1:12:42] Martin kept looking at him the scripture
[1:12:45] running through his mind he said Satan
[1:12:47] get away from me
[1:12:49] he said you got a crown on your head
[1:12:52] and the word of God says his sins will
[1:12:55] crown him at the End of the Age
[1:12:58] praise the name of the Lord now you can
[1:13:01] read this and think oh yeah as long as
[1:13:03] you know the scripture you are fine no
[1:13:05] you have to know the scripture for your
[1:13:07] day
[1:13:08] the reason is this in Revelations 14 the
[1:13:12] son of man has a crown of gold where he
[1:13:15] had been crowned already so you could
[1:13:17] read that and look and say oh yeah I've
[1:13:19] seen it in the Bible it's not enough
[1:13:21] praise the name of the Lord understand
[1:13:23] the scripture that is fulfilling in your
[1:13:26] day
[1:13:27] that is what matters praise the name of
[1:13:30] the Lord
[1:13:31] and so anyway now
[1:13:34] in the time of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:37] we all know that the Sadducees were
[1:13:40] worshiping
[1:13:42] the Pharisees were worshiping
[1:13:45] and if you ask them they'll tell you
[1:13:46] they are worshiping God
[1:13:49] by the god they are worshiping was
[1:13:50] manifested in flesh and right in their
[1:13:53] midst and they were zealously
[1:13:55] persecuting him they were opposing him
[1:13:58] so the question is who were they
[1:14:00] worshiping
[1:14:02] now I'm I'm not going to try to answer
[1:14:05] but I know you know the answer
[1:14:08] but the god that claimed to be
[1:14:09] worshiping was right in front of them
[1:14:12] and when it comes to singing they could
[1:14:15] probably sing better than the apostles
[1:14:17] they had better buildings they were
[1:14:19] better dressed the high press was in the
[1:14:21] temple with them
[1:14:24] and yet
[1:14:25] they missed the gods that they claim to
[1:14:27] be worshiping think of it because asses
[1:14:30] happened then it's not very different
[1:14:31] from today
[1:14:33] and so you just take the scripture use
[1:14:37] it
[1:14:37] praise the name of the Lord because if
[1:14:40] all these denominations were not
[1:14:41] worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ even
[1:14:44] though they were more religious
[1:14:46] think of it what they were doing praise
[1:14:48] the name of the Lord now the devil had
[1:14:51] majority of the religious groups
[1:14:53] and yet he was not satisfied after he
[1:14:57] gets the chosen of God
[1:15:00] and that is why brother Brahm says
[1:15:02] something here in this position of the
[1:15:05] seven churches the pardonian church as
[1:15:07] he said
[1:15:09] but the devil
[1:15:12] is not content
[1:15:14] he hasn't achieved worship of himself
[1:15:16] yet
[1:15:18] except in an indirect way
[1:15:21] why indirect because it's true
[1:15:24] misrepresentation
[1:15:25] his post as God
[1:15:28] to deceive people and get worship our
[1:15:31] even when it's not true representation
[1:15:33] is true creation
[1:15:35] and so then it's not true worship and so
[1:15:38] he's still looking for it and he's
[1:15:40] looking for it from you and I
[1:15:44] now the scripture we research
[1:15:47] all World worship
[1:15:50] all will worship ah will bow down it
[1:15:55] means the man will worship and the women
[1:15:57] will worship
[1:15:58] it means the African would worship and
[1:16:01] the Caucasian will worship it means the
[1:16:03] Pentecostal will worship and the
[1:16:05] Cadillac will worship and the message
[1:16:07] believe I will worship
[1:16:09] but in all that the devil is not
[1:16:11] satisfied
[1:16:16] so the battle is for your worship
[1:16:18] and you are I are the target
[1:16:21] but as Jesus said to Peter once
[1:16:26] when he said uh the devil has such a 50
[1:16:29] you like wheat but I said I have prayed
[1:16:32] for you
[1:16:33] halleluia and I believe today that what
[1:16:36] the Lord Jesus Christ has done for us is
[1:16:38] even more than what he did for Peter
[1:16:41] because what he's done for us is he
[1:16:44] secured our destiny
[1:16:46] Hallelujah
[1:16:48] from the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:50] where Abraham says for the gospel is
[1:16:53] delivered is good news
[1:16:56] and this morning
[1:16:58] or if you love me I'll say this evening
[1:17:00] the Holy Spirit through the word is
[1:17:03] bringing you the good news that from
[1:17:05] before the foundation of the world God
[1:17:07] wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:17:09] Life
[1:17:10] Hallelujah all the Devils out of hell
[1:17:13] can't erase it out of there
[1:17:16] God's word has done spockets
[1:17:19] just as sure as it are just as sure to
[1:17:23] happen as God wrote it in there before
[1:17:25] the foundation of the world Amen how
[1:17:28] glorious our heavenly father is in his
[1:17:31] infinite love and his Mercy to do this
[1:17:35] for us praise the name of the Lord
[1:17:38] and so in a world where the devil has
[1:17:42] practically taken over
[1:17:44] through all the devices his seeking
[1:17:48] attention and when he gets attention
[1:17:50] he's seeking worship it could be through
[1:17:52] music it's a true fasciness through
[1:17:54] Sports through entertainment through the
[1:17:57] last whatever it is that he can
[1:18:01] when he's dominated everything God first
[1:18:04] made an exception
[1:18:06] Hallelujah and he made that exception
[1:18:09] from before the foundation of the world
[1:18:11] Hallelujah and not just that he's
[1:18:13] declared to us today praise the name of
[1:18:16] the Lord that we were elected to
[1:18:18] overcome Hallelujah that we were chosen
[1:18:22] not to be deceived praise the name of
[1:18:24] the Lord and he says God's word has done
[1:18:27] spoken
[1:18:29] Hallelujah now in the message power
[1:18:32] transformation
[1:18:35] says that God speaks into existence
[1:18:39] Hallelujah and so when you hear him the
[1:18:42] God who speaks into existence when you
[1:18:45] hear him say
[1:18:46] the things that he said to us hallelujah
[1:18:49] then you have to understand that it must
[1:18:51] of necessity come to pass
[1:18:54] you and I were spoken not to fall
[1:18:56] you and I were spoken in Victory praise
[1:19:00] the name of the Lord the Almighty has
[1:19:02] spoken Hallelujah and so it shall be
[1:19:05] even as he has declared
[1:19:07] and I like it when brother says nothing
[1:19:10] can stop it
[1:19:11] [Laughter]
[1:19:13] but Abraham says God's word has dance
[1:19:15] pockets
[1:19:17] now there was a time in the Bible
[1:19:20] and I often like to reference this that
[1:19:23] there was a time in the Bible when God
[1:19:25] called an 80 year young man
[1:19:29] Called Moses
[1:19:32] now this man
[1:19:36] was a measurer
[1:19:39] he had killed somebody
[1:19:41] in the most powerful country on Earth at
[1:19:43] that time and he was on the Run
[1:19:46] and then God's word comes to him
[1:19:48] now when God was God's word came to him
[1:19:51] it said Moses you are going back to that
[1:19:54] country
[1:19:55] think of it
[1:19:56] but
[1:19:57] you are not going to sneak in
[1:20:01] no you are actually going to go boldly
[1:20:04] to the Palace
[1:20:05] you are going before pharaoh
[1:20:08] and not just that you are going to tell
[1:20:10] him that the source of your riches the
[1:20:13] source of the two million
[1:20:16] cheap or free labor that you have
[1:20:19] the people that used to build Ramses and
[1:20:21] all these big cities and all these great
[1:20:23] projects
[1:20:24] they have a God he desires worship and
[1:20:28] so I'm taking all of them to go and
[1:20:29] worship him
[1:20:31] that's what you're going to do
[1:20:34] and yet Moses obeyed why
[1:20:37] oh thank God for a a religious mother
[1:20:40] praise the name of the Lord the word was
[1:20:43] in him already but look at this that
[1:20:45] when God spoke these words God did not
[1:20:48] have any doubt
[1:20:49] God has never doubted his own word and
[1:20:52] so when he spoke to him he said when you
[1:20:55] go after you've brought them out he said
[1:20:58] when you bring them out
[1:21:00] so God knew that he was going and he was
[1:21:03] going to bring them out and that nothing
[1:21:05] was going to stand in the way so he says
[1:21:08] when you bring them out let them worship
[1:21:11] me here on this mountain
[1:21:13] not because God had faith in his word as
[1:21:16] he spoke to Moses that same Faith came
[1:21:19] on Moses and so Moses also had
[1:21:21] absolutely no doubt that he was going in
[1:21:24] and he was coming out
[1:21:26] praise the name of the Lord
[1:21:28] Hallelujah
[1:21:30] and so that is that when God speaks it
[1:21:33] it has to happen
[1:21:36] brother sister he has spoken about us
[1:21:39] he spoke about a bride
[1:21:41] we are here
[1:21:43] Hallelujah
[1:21:45] now many instances
[1:21:50] speaks about an event in California
[1:21:52] where he went to preach and he preached
[1:21:54] hard and
[1:21:55] after he finished a brother put his
[1:21:58] hands around him and prayed for him
[1:22:02] and so as he tried to pray for brother
[1:22:06] Abraham
[1:22:08] he spoke in French you've all heard of
[1:22:11] it and so
[1:22:13] a man who has never spoken in French
[1:22:16] spoken French
[1:22:18] and just for us to know that it was God
[1:22:21] there happens to be adaptation
[1:22:24] three people
[1:22:26] of very varied backgrounds who didn't
[1:22:29] know each other one was the French
[1:22:31] translator in the White House the other
[1:22:34] was a French translator for the United
[1:22:35] Nations the other was just a French
[1:22:37] person
[1:22:38] and then they all had it and not just
[1:22:41] that if somebody is praying what makes
[1:22:43] it come to your mind to take a pen and
[1:22:45] paper and translate it
[1:22:47] but three different people right at that
[1:22:49] instant translated it
[1:22:51] and when they presented it as exactly
[1:22:54] word by word
[1:22:55] and but Abraham kept the original copy
[1:22:58] and that is what I want to read to you
[1:23:00] here
[1:23:01] he says oh
[1:23:08] this is because that has chosen the
[1:23:10] Narrow Path
[1:23:11] the Hardaway thou has walked in your own
[1:23:15] chosen
[1:23:17] that has picked the correct and precise
[1:23:19] decision
[1:23:20] it is my way
[1:23:22] because of this momentous decision a
[1:23:26] huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what
[1:23:28] a glorious decision thou has made this
[1:23:31] in itself is that which will give and
[1:23:34] make to come to pass that tremendous
[1:23:36] victory in love divine
[1:23:40] now every time brother Abraham mentions
[1:23:42] this and it speaks about thou has worked
[1:23:44] in your own chosen he points out that he
[1:23:47] could have chosen a different path
[1:23:51] so God does not ignore his word
[1:23:56] the free moral agency is an early level
[1:23:59] of life and that is why we need to
[1:24:01] always constantly keep talking and keep
[1:24:04] strengthening ourselves and keep
[1:24:06] encouraging ourselves and keep on
[1:24:07] because you every step of the way your
[1:24:10] free moral agency so we have to get used
[1:24:13] to choosing God's way
[1:24:15] Hallelujah and so it's his own chosen
[1:24:18] then he says it is my way
[1:24:21] and that's what I want us to understand
[1:24:23] when you listen to this message it is
[1:24:26] God's way when you believe and leave
[1:24:29] this message it is God's way
[1:24:33] Hallelujah and especially for you and I
[1:24:36] he sent a messenger to tell us that it
[1:24:38] is his way
[1:24:40] why we are his choice
[1:24:43] praise the name of the Lord
[1:24:46] so yes it is the harder way
[1:24:49] it is the narrow way
[1:24:51] it is the proven way but it is the
[1:24:54] Vindicated way
[1:24:56] and it is God's word hallelujah and so
[1:24:59] when the Devil comes in like a flood
[1:25:02] well we have been ordained to stand
[1:25:06] where is everybody's bowing to the devil
[1:25:08] in the world whether they know it or not
[1:25:10] we have been called to stand
[1:25:13] Hallelujah and this is what I want us to
[1:25:16] focus on
[1:25:18] I can mentioned at time
[1:25:20] that the Lord Jesus Christ is with the
[1:25:23] disciples
[1:25:25] and a big campaign is over
[1:25:29] and then Jesus speaks to them
[1:25:31] says let us go over to the other side
[1:25:34] Hallelujah let us go over to the other
[1:25:36] side and so they're going
[1:25:39] and then the winds come
[1:25:42] and the storm comes and the waves come
[1:25:46] and this little Versace all over and
[1:25:50] then fear sets in
[1:25:52] that is human reaction
[1:25:55] but the truth of the matter is the Lord
[1:25:56] has already spoken
[1:25:58] praise the name of the Lord it was not a
[1:26:00] prediction it was not a suggestion when
[1:26:03] God speaks it has to happen that is why
[1:26:06] I'm saying he has spoken about us praise
[1:26:08] the name of the Lord so it's for us
[1:26:10] still we have three more Legacy but we
[1:26:13] for us to step into our calling
[1:26:15] Hallelujah
[1:26:17] praise the name of the Lord
[1:26:21] Malachi 4 spoke about us
[1:26:24] Revelations 10 1 7 spoke about us
[1:26:28] Luke 17 30 speaks about us
[1:26:30] it is still speaking what am I saying
[1:26:33] you are here as the Fulfillment of the
[1:26:36] spoken word
[1:26:37] praise the name of the Lord that's why I
[1:26:39] take the Liberty to mention these things
[1:26:42] Hallelujah let's keep focused Hallelujah
[1:26:47] the Rapture is already spoken
[1:26:51] the marriage supplies already spoken
[1:26:55] the Millennium is already spoken
[1:26:58] the white strong judgment is already
[1:27:00] spoken
[1:27:01] New Jerusalem is already spoken
[1:27:04] praise the name of the Lord
[1:27:07] and so
[1:27:08] nothing's going to change it we can
[1:27:11] debate it oh yeah the Rapture is not in
[1:27:13] the Bible and all that the word is not
[1:27:14] all right God has already spoken
[1:27:19] our faith only makes it inherited
[1:27:23] but that is not needed for it to happen
[1:27:25] the only necessary condition is God has
[1:27:28] already spoken
[1:27:31] now I want to share this
[1:27:33] quote
[1:27:35] we're just from the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:27:37] says
[1:27:39] the same time that Christ
[1:27:41] that God said Christ will be slain he
[1:27:45] wrote your name with his
[1:27:48] and says hallelujah
[1:27:50] there you are
[1:27:52] the day I read this I thought isn't that
[1:27:55] a way to frustrate the devil
[1:27:57] Hallelujah because you see when he says
[1:28:00] he wrote your name with his his that is
[1:28:02] God's that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:04] isn't he the Rock of Ages
[1:28:07] his friend is a movable he's
[1:28:10] unchangeable but remember it's not that
[1:28:12] just that it's in eternity
[1:28:15] praise the name of the Lord so in the
[1:28:18] circle of Eternity there is a blip
[1:28:20] called time but just before that God
[1:28:25] makes sure
[1:28:26] that his own will not be lost he writes
[1:28:29] your name with his at the beginning
[1:28:31] and then he writes your name with his at
[1:28:34] the end
[1:28:35] so regardless of what happens in between
[1:28:38] we know your future is secured
[1:28:43] and we have the added benefit that he
[1:28:45] sends the prophet to tell us
[1:28:47] so now we recognize who we are
[1:28:49] Hallelujah
[1:28:52] you know
[1:28:53] um
[1:28:55] we went to uh I think Sunday evening at
[1:28:59] home
[1:29:01] we
[1:29:02] the children brought this book know that
[1:29:05] they
[1:29:07] ten years ago when but I can took all of
[1:29:10] us to rafter six that that result
[1:29:14] it was a nice time and there were some
[1:29:17] good stories there
[1:29:19] but
[1:29:20] um so we watched and we're looking at
[1:29:22] the children and how much they've grown
[1:29:24] and all that
[1:29:26] but for me one of the greatest tourists
[1:29:29] from after six was the zipline
[1:29:33] um well when they were doing it I was on
[1:29:35] frame ground so I I could see things
[1:29:38] right
[1:29:40] but I
[1:29:42] there are people who went on there which
[1:29:46] if if they had been given the
[1:29:47] possibility
[1:29:49] Midway through they would have gone back
[1:29:51] they would have easily given their money
[1:29:53] and just gone back
[1:29:54] but they didn't allow them so they kept
[1:29:57] going
[1:29:58] because it was scary
[1:30:00] and it was wobbly and all that but you
[1:30:03] see for the guides
[1:30:05] they were not bothered they were not
[1:30:08] worried because they knew that they hold
[1:30:10] the entire thing has been tested
[1:30:13] Hallelujah and it has been uncut
[1:30:16] and so though it will be wobbly in the
[1:30:18] middle it's bound to end
[1:30:20] Hallelujah I understand the brother and
[1:30:23] sister the Lord has anchored and secured
[1:30:26] our future
[1:30:28] praise the name of the Lord
[1:30:32] so the moment God speaks your name or
[1:30:36] the moment you recognize yourself in the
[1:30:38] scripture you understand that the bride
[1:30:41] is part of the written word
[1:30:43] and when we recognize our position and
[1:30:46] we take it now for the bride the only
[1:30:49] position is in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:51] now what is the position of the devil in
[1:30:54] reference to the Lord Jesus Christ under
[1:30:56] his feet
[1:30:58] so whatever the position you have in the
[1:31:01] Lord Jesus Christ if you recognize it
[1:31:03] and you take it the devil is under your
[1:31:05] feet
[1:31:06] and that is what he hates that's why
[1:31:09] he'll do everything possible to distract
[1:31:12] you from recognizing Who You Are
[1:31:14] and that's what God has also taken it
[1:31:17] upon himself to manifest in this time to
[1:31:20] tell you that you are his
[1:31:22] praise the name of the Lord
[1:31:25] so regardless of what Miracles
[1:31:27] regardless of what Vindication yes we
[1:31:29] love the Miracles they are part of the
[1:31:30] scripture without the supernatural the
[1:31:32] scripture is just anything else
[1:31:34] and so yes the Supernatural is part of
[1:31:37] the scripture but
[1:31:38] our joy the source of our joy the course
[1:31:41] of our joy it's not all the Vindication
[1:31:44] that we can see in terms of Miracles
[1:31:46] it's in the fact that there is a word
[1:31:48] written about us
[1:31:49] and that word is written in eternity and
[1:31:52] so there's nothing the devil can do in
[1:31:54] time to undo what was written in
[1:31:57] eternity praise the name of the Lord
[1:32:00] before the foundation of the world
[1:32:03] halleluia
[1:32:05] now if there is a man in Scripture that
[1:32:09] I always like to liken to the devil
[1:32:13] it is human in the Book of Esther
[1:32:18] for me he he represents the essence of
[1:32:22] everything that the devil is
[1:32:24] and time wouldn't permit us to go
[1:32:27] through it all
[1:32:29] hey man was a man who had the worship of
[1:32:32] everybody
[1:32:35] apart from one person
[1:32:38] now if you have the worship of everybody
[1:32:40] in the Kingdom shouldn't you be
[1:32:42] satisfied no not hey man
[1:32:46] and that's the situation of the devil
[1:32:50] and so he'll fight it and we'll fight it
[1:32:53] until it ends he himself
[1:32:56] and we know that there was end praise
[1:32:59] the name of the Lord
[1:33:00] and so Mordecai
[1:33:03] wouldn't worship
[1:33:05] not because he dislikes him and no
[1:33:08] not because he wants to challenge the
[1:33:10] Lord no
[1:33:11] not because he wants to disobey no
[1:33:14] but because he understood that he has a
[1:33:17] role to play in the plan of God for that
[1:33:20] moment
[1:33:21] and brother sister we have a role to
[1:33:23] play
[1:33:24] praise the name of the Lord we have been
[1:33:27] called to be his bride we have been
[1:33:29] called to be his representative we have
[1:33:31] been called to be his ambassadors we
[1:33:33] have been called to be his lips and
[1:33:35] hands and feet right here on Earth right
[1:33:37] now we have a role to play and when we
[1:33:40] recognize to around Europe you recognize
[1:33:43] how important it is
[1:33:47] then everything else will lose its value
[1:33:51] and you focus on who you are that's why
[1:33:54] the program says when the right
[1:33:55] remembers uh recognizes who she is then
[1:33:59] the Rapture will happen
[1:34:01] Hallelujah
[1:34:03] and so he recognized his position in the
[1:34:06] grand scheme of things and you see God
[1:34:10] always reserves a people
[1:34:12] for himself as a witness Hallelujah and
[1:34:16] we are that people tonight
[1:34:19] yes Hallelujah
[1:34:21] so in a world where people are busy
[1:34:22] worshiping riches
[1:34:25] where these people are busy seeking
[1:34:28] power
[1:34:28] worshiping
[1:34:30] fashion and lust and seeking popularity
[1:34:34] you are called to take a stand
[1:34:37] but you are not just called to take it
[1:34:39] and you were ordained for that
[1:34:42] Hallelujah
[1:34:44] praise the name of the Lord
[1:34:49] now
[1:34:51] because we're ordained for that
[1:34:53] when you take your position
[1:34:55] when you take a stand
[1:34:57] as a young man at school and you'll be
[1:35:01] going very soon
[1:35:02] when you take a stand
[1:35:06] you become annoying to the devil
[1:35:09] you become an irritant to the devil but
[1:35:12] it's all right continue take the stand
[1:35:15] face the obstacle
[1:35:17] because there is a testimony right at
[1:35:19] the corner
[1:35:21] listen the God you are taking the
[1:35:23] Stanford will never leave you
[1:35:25] he'll never leave you
[1:35:28] yes we have a fast food mentality we
[1:35:30] want Justice now that is not God's way
[1:35:34] but if you are patient
[1:35:36] and if we stand on the scripture
[1:35:39] then God will always prove himself
[1:35:41] faithful to you
[1:35:43] Hallelujah and so it's up to
[1:35:46] our position and take it and use it
[1:35:49] Hallelujah because every time that the
[1:35:52] devil sees you it reminds him that he
[1:35:55] has failed
[1:35:56] right
[1:35:59] that's why the fight of Mordecai did to
[1:36:01] himan
[1:36:02] it reminded him of his ambition
[1:36:05] and the fact that he has failed
[1:36:08] and so he kept at it and kept at it
[1:36:10] until it destroyed him
[1:36:12] Hallelujah so our position right now is
[1:36:16] not because we are wise it's not because
[1:36:18] we are smart it's not because we have
[1:36:21] put in so much effort it's not none of
[1:36:23] that
[1:36:24] but it's because God has done pockets to
[1:36:27] use brother Abraham's language yes so
[1:36:29] it's something that is already atone for
[1:36:31] hallelujah it's something that's already
[1:36:34] paid for it's a finished work
[1:36:37] praise the name of the Lord and the
[1:36:39] worst for the devil right now in this
[1:36:41] age is that we know it
[1:36:43] we recognize it because God has taken it
[1:36:47] upon himself to declare it to us
[1:36:50] praise the name of the Lord
[1:36:54] I'm reading this
[1:37:09] oh how did it go that far
[1:37:18] all right I'll just read it for you
[1:37:22] this is the infallible proof of
[1:37:24] Resurrection
[1:37:29] program says and when God wants thought
[1:37:33] of how he would make the Plan of
[1:37:36] Redemption and how he'll redeem months
[1:37:39] by far knowledge knowing that someone
[1:37:41] desire it and some will be redeemed he
[1:37:44] thought of the plan and then he spoke
[1:37:46] the word it was already a finished work
[1:37:49] in heaven when God spoke it
[1:37:53] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:37:57] and so I I had little references to
[1:38:00] Daniel and to the Hebrews remember we
[1:38:04] all know that Hallelujah we all know
[1:38:06] that and so I'll just keep going that
[1:38:09] all these were just how would I say a
[1:38:13] shadow of our reality
[1:38:15] all of that spoke of us today praise the
[1:38:19] name of the Lord and so that is what we
[1:38:21] have to understand that when we see them
[1:38:25] and they're making laws because that's
[1:38:26] what they did
[1:38:28] to Daniel and so when we see them and
[1:38:31] they are making laws and they're doing
[1:38:32] this and and and it's all targeting us
[1:38:36] there used to be a time when people had
[1:38:38] real opinion
[1:38:40] and they could express whether good or
[1:38:42] bad
[1:38:43] it's not there anymore
[1:38:45] there used to be a time where you could
[1:38:46] meet a person and you see the person you
[1:38:49] see how they're dressed you hear their
[1:38:51] voice you can say fair and you will be
[1:38:54] right
[1:38:56] to then I have to teach around and say
[1:38:58] how would you want to be called
[1:39:01] and sometimes some will say they
[1:39:04] like
[1:39:06] one person is standing there and they
[1:39:08] are plural
[1:39:10] and you better not complain
[1:39:13] so understand that these things are
[1:39:15] targeting us it was to get us to to
[1:39:19] violate the loss of our God is to get us
[1:39:21] to disobey God what they don't realize
[1:39:24] is that the relationship between God and
[1:39:26] his bride is a relationship of love it's
[1:39:29] a relationship of trust
[1:39:31] praise the name of the Lord It's a
[1:39:33] relationship it's the product of a
[1:39:34] finished work
[1:39:36] Hallelujah it has already been spoken
[1:39:39] and we are stepping into it
[1:39:41] praise the name of the Lord
[1:39:43] and so this is what I came to say
[1:39:46] hallelujah
[1:39:48] praise the name of the Lord
[1:39:52] there will it's not going to get any
[1:39:55] better
[1:39:57] as we see it now the laws they come one
[1:40:00] by one and so it's as if you you don't
[1:40:02] really see it
[1:40:04] body keeps on and on and on
[1:40:07] and then very soon we find ourselves
[1:40:10] completely isolated we'll find ourselves
[1:40:12] completely surrendered but we have a
[1:40:15] word for that is the name of the Lord
[1:40:17] the Lord says when it comes to that it
[1:40:20] says look up for your Redemption is not
[1:40:22] Hallelujah
[1:40:25] praise the name of the Lord
[1:40:30] now the other thing I just want to bring
[1:40:32] to attention as I'm getting ready to
[1:40:34] close is that
[1:40:36] God has called you and I and he has
[1:40:39] entrusted us with his own weapons of
[1:40:42] warfare
[1:40:44] and it is designed to overcome the
[1:40:47] conditions of today
[1:40:49] now we all know the devil had the
[1:40:52] opportunity to to to tempt the Lord
[1:40:55] Jesus Christ
[1:40:56] our Lord came in flesh he was tempted so
[1:40:59] the word point he's given us which is
[1:41:02] the revealed word of the hour that
[1:41:05] weapon is tried
[1:41:07] and it's already proven it's already
[1:41:09] defeated the devil and that's what is
[1:41:12] handed to us factors do we recognize the
[1:41:15] value of what we have
[1:41:17] because if we recognize it we will
[1:41:20] constantly and continuously use it
[1:41:23] I liked the brother making that
[1:41:25] reference that there is probably a
[1:41:27] problem there in the church it says read
[1:41:29] the message
[1:41:30] Hallelujah because the answers are there
[1:41:32] if God calls you and you find your place
[1:41:37] whatever problem you have the answer is
[1:41:39] right there at that position
[1:41:42] already just assuming your position in
[1:41:44] the day in in Jesus places the devil
[1:41:48] under you which means it places lust
[1:41:50] under you he places All the gossip under
[1:41:52] you he places lies under you he places
[1:41:55] cheating under you it places all every
[1:41:58] device under you
[1:42:00] all we need to accept that this is us
[1:42:04] so we go beyond confessing it and
[1:42:06] actually live it
[1:42:08] praise the name of the Lord
[1:42:15] and so uh
[1:42:19] okay
[1:42:21] the evening messenger brother says here
[1:42:23] we are end time
[1:42:25] red light down flashing
[1:42:28] coming of the Lord is Satan yes sir
[1:42:31] listen the end time message should meet
[1:42:33] end time conditions
[1:42:36] where they've got off the message ought
[1:42:39] to bring it back
[1:42:42] where they go off what brings it back
[1:42:44] the message
[1:42:47] Believers will say Amen where their
[1:42:50] lives
[1:42:52] well he said that but let's no no he
[1:42:55] says the message
[1:42:57] ought to bring it back
[1:43:00] praise the name of the Lord always end
[1:43:03] time message means end time condition
[1:43:07] praise the name of the Lord
[1:43:10] and so there's an anointing on the
[1:43:12] message for the conditions of today
[1:43:15] Hallelujah and it's ensure that the
[1:43:18] bride overcomes the professions of today
[1:43:21] Hallelujah now that anointing on the
[1:43:24] message will not lose its power
[1:43:27] that anointing will not fail
[1:43:30] the revealed word of Malachi 4 will
[1:43:32] fulfill the purpose for which it was
[1:43:34] sent
[1:43:35] because it's God's word
[1:43:37] and God speaks into existence Hallelujah
[1:43:40] and so
[1:43:42] first of all it was sent to Equippers to
[1:43:46] overcome loudisha
[1:43:47] second it is to prepare us for the
[1:43:49] rapture
[1:43:50] and it shall not fail Hallelujah I'll
[1:43:55] call the musicians as I read this last
[1:43:57] quote
[1:44:06] because understand it when you recognize
[1:44:08] your position what the devil does is
[1:44:13] to get you to look at yourself
[1:44:15] instead of the word
[1:44:18] but we have nothing to do with it
[1:44:21] the Lord already
[1:44:23] Blaze the path and invited us into reach
[1:44:29] look at something
[1:44:31] the word was spoken about him before he
[1:44:33] was born
[1:44:35] he has so many weaknesses he has short
[1:44:37] for us he'll fall in love with the wrong
[1:44:39] woman and say what he's not supposed to
[1:44:41] say it didn't stop him from fulfilling
[1:44:44] the purpose for which he was called
[1:44:46] it was you see when God speaks and we
[1:44:49] say oh man was too weak or this and so
[1:44:52] man failed it means God has failed
[1:44:54] and God does not fail
[1:44:56] God does not repent God does not change
[1:44:59] his mind and so what God has said he
[1:45:03] will watch over it to fulfill it
[1:45:05] so you and I are then to stand today
[1:45:10] praise the name of the Lord
[1:45:12] let me just read this last one and then
[1:45:14] we are done
[1:45:17] and God never did deal with Israel oh
[1:45:20] yes I like this
[1:45:21] because it appears that Abraham sort of
[1:45:24] took out the gloves a little bit
[1:45:27] God never did deal with Israel until she
[1:45:29] come to her Homeland hear me that says
[1:45:32] the Lord God will not deal with his
[1:45:35] chair till she comes back to the
[1:45:36] Homeland the message of the hour
[1:45:41] Hallelujah where is the Homeland the
[1:45:44] message of the hour praise the name of
[1:45:46] the Lord
[1:45:47] and they say come back to the original

[1:46:13] denominations who Do You Think You Are

[1:46:21] this strikes the world all wrong all of
[1:46:24] the devil oh my there's Godly men in
[1:46:28] every one of them there's godly people
[1:46:30] in every one of their movements but the
[1:46:32] organization in itself is not of God and
[1:46:35] God will never bless us
[1:46:37] he never has done it
[1:46:40] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:46:42] let's stand on our feet
